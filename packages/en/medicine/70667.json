Of the revisions made, the most\r\nimportant deal with advances in the study of food deficiency\r\ndiseases, as will be noted under beriberi and pellagra.\r\n\r\nI have enlarged various paragraphs on treatment, the additions\r\nincluding descriptions of the treatment of hookworm disease by carbon\r\ntetrachloride and of the methods of administering arsphenamine and\r\nantimony.\r\n\r\nSix new chapters have been added to the book, viz. Epidemic jaundice,\r\nrat bite fever, tularaemia, tables of helminthic and arthropodan\r\ndiseases, trench fever, in Part I, and, in Part II, a chapter on the\r\ndiagnostics of tropical joint, muscle and bone lesions.\r\n\r\nExtensive additions have been made to Chapter XLIII, “Diagnostic\r\nproblems and procedures, together with cosmopolitan diseases in the\r\ntropics”; and in the chapter on blood examinations will be found a\r\npresentation of our latest views as to acidosis as well as a table\r\ngiving the significance of the findings in blood chemistry.\r\n\r\nMany new illustrations have been added and some of the older ones\r\nreplaced by others of greater teaching value.\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made to retain the feature of a pocket manual\r\nbut it has been necessary to increase the number of pages from 524\r\nto 610. The illustrations in the third edition numbered 119; in this\r\nedition, 159.\r\n\r\nIn particular I have to express my indebtedness to Commanders C. S.\r\nButler and H. W. Smith of the Naval Medical Corps for advice and\r\nassistance in the preparation of this edition. Dr. G. W. McCoy,\r\nDirector of the Hygienic Laboratory, has given me valued suggestions\r\nas to changes in some of the old chapters and in the preparation of\r\nthe new chapter on Tularaemia.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Commander Bunker, the head of the Chemical Laboratory of\r\nthe Naval Medical School, has made the revisions of the subjects\r\ndealing with physiological chemistry. Others, who have given me\r\nadvice and suggestions, have been Lieutenant Commander Reed and\r\nLieutenants Harper and Chambers of the Naval Medical School.\r\n\r\nTo Lieutenant Peterson I am indebted for assistance in the\r\nproofreading and preparation of the index as well as in going over\r\nthe recent literature of tropical diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more striking evidence of advance in general medicine\r\nthan the present attitude of the physician or rather internist in the\r\ndiagnosis of the cases met with in a modern hospital ward. Instead\r\nof first considering the evidence obtainable at the bedside and\r\nthen noting the laboratory findings as something apart and entirely\r\nsubordinate, we now find the two aids to diagnosis so correlated\r\nthat it is as difficult to note one kind of information as bedside\r\nand other as laboratory as it formerly was to separate signs from\r\nsymptoms in the study of a case.\r\n\r\nIn tropical medicine, however, we have for many years made our\r\ndiagnosis in the laboratory, the bedside playing a subsidiary\r\npart—the laboratory diagnosis is controlled by the bedside findings.\r\n\r\nIt was originally my idea to prepare a book which would enable\r\nstudents to have presented to them in intimate relation the\r\nlaboratory and clinical aids to the diagnosis of tropical diseases. I\r\nwas forced to abandon this plan as it did not seem possible to take\r\nup clinical diagnosis prior to the obtaining by the student of a\r\ncomprehensive knowledge of the facts in connection with each separate\r\ntropical disease. There was not the same difficulty attaching to a\r\nbook exclusively devoted to the diagnostic methods of the laboratory\r\nso that in 1908 a laboratory manual was published. More recently it\r\nhas occurred to me that my methods in teaching tropical medicine\r\nfrom the clinical rather than the laboratory standpoint might be of\r\nassistance to those who are interested in this very important branch\r\nof medicine.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that a knowledge of malaria, blackwater fever,\r\namoebic dysentery, bacillary dysentery, liver abscess, pellagra and\r\nhookworm disease is just as important for the medical man in the\r\nSouthern States of the United States as for the physician in tropical\r\ncolonial possessions, it will be realized that there is more of a\r\npractical side to tropical medicine than is usually admitted.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is intended as a companion volume to the one on\r\nlaboratory methods yet, in order to make it complete in itself, there\r\nhas been prepared under each disease a paragraph dealing with the\r\nlaboratory diagnosis of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, under the sections on the blood, faeces and urine in the\r\ndiagnosis of tropical diseases, the laboratory methods which are of\r\npractical application have been given.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature of the book is in presenting in Part II the\r\nclinical side of tropical diseases from a standpoint of the signs\r\nand symptoms of these diseases which are connected with anatomical\r\nor clinical groupings rather than from the side of the individual\r\ndisease. Thus in Chapter XLIV the diagnostic points which may be\r\nobtained from a study of the temperature chart are given while in\r\nChapter LII the neurological manifestations, which may be noted in\r\nvarious tropical diseases, are presented.\r\n\r\nIn Part I each individual tropical disease is treated as taken up\r\nin any of the well-known books on tropical medicine. It has seemed\r\nto me, however, that the paragraphs on epidemiology and prophylaxis\r\nshould receive especial attention. Again, in order to bring out\r\nmore strongly the symptomatology of each disease, I have followed\r\nthe paragraph on symptomatology in general with a section dealing\r\nwith the symptoms in detail, as shown in a consideration of the\r\ncirculatory, respiratory, digestive, nervous and other systems.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph devoted to the definition of each important disease has\r\nbeen prepared with a view to giving the reader a brief description of\r\nthe disease in its clinical and etiological aspects.\r\n\r\nSmall type has been used rather to supply headings than for the\r\npurpose of indicating less important matter because in a book so\r\ncondensed it has not seemed advisable to present any subject not of\r\npractical value.\r\n\r\nThis book is written from the standpoint of the teacher who aims not\r\nonly to give the essential points but to present them in a manner so\r\ncross-referenced that the student has the subject presented to him\r\nfrom every angle.\r\n\r\nIt has been my custom in preparing my lectures to abstract the\r\nvarious works on tropical medicine in order that special points in\r\none book, not noted in the others, would stand out prominently.\r\nIn this connection I am deeply indebted to the manuals of Manson,\r\nScheube, Castellani and Chalmers, LeDantec, Jeanselme and Rist as\r\nwell as to the monographs in Maladies Exotiques, Albutt’s System of\r\nMedicine, Osler’s System of Medicine, Mense’s Tropenkrankheiten and\r\nTraite Pratique de Pathologie Exotique.\r\n\r\nIn particular I am indebted to Ruge and zurVerth’s\r\nTropenkrankheiten, to Brumpt’s Precis de Parasitologie and to the\r\nonly work in the diagnosis of tropical diseases I have been able to\r\nobtain, that of Wurtz and Thiroux, entitled Maladies Tropicales.\r\n\r\nIn the section on blood examination I have advocated the adoption of\r\nthe scheme of differential counting brought out in Schilling-Torgau’s\r\nwork on the blood in tropical diseases.\r\n\r\nI have freely consulted the various journals dealing with the subject\r\nof tropical medicine as to recent advances in this branch of medicine\r\nand I would particularly express my indebtedness to the Tropical\r\nDiseases Bulletin which should be in the hands of every student of\r\ntropical medicine, not only as an index to original papers but as\r\na guide as to the advisability of consulting such papers. These\r\nabstracts are prepared by authorities in the different tropical\r\ndiseases and many of the abstracts indicate the value or lack of\r\nvalue of the paper abstracted.\r\n\r\nThe tropical diseases are classified under those due to protozoa,\r\nthose due to bacteria, those due to filterable viruses, infectious\r\ngranulomata and tropical skin diseases. Sprue is classified as a food\r\ndeficiency disease for the reason that the cure seems to rest solely\r\nin dietary treatment. Certain diseases which did not definitely\r\nbelong to any of the above-named sections were taken up under\r\ndiseases of disputed nature or minor importance. The second part of\r\nthe book deals with the clinical diagnosis of tropical diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n\r\n  TROPICAL DISEASES AND THEIR TREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISEASES DUE TO PROTOZOA\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.—Malaria, 1.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.—Blackwater fever, 55.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.—The trypanosomiases, 66; African trypanosomiasis, 66;\r\n      Brazilian trypanosomiasis, 80; Animal trypanosomiases, 84.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.—The tropical relapsing fevers, 86.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.—Yellow fever, 97.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.—Infectious jaundice, 114.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.—Rat bite fever, 118.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.—The leishmaniases, 121; Visceral leishmaniasis, 127;\r\n      Cutaneous leishmaniasis, 135.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX.—General considerations of dysentery, 141.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X.—Amoebic dysentery, 147.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XI.—Liver abscess, 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DISEASES DUE TO BACTERIA\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XII.—Bacillary dysentery, 174.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIII.—Plague, 188.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIV.—Tularaemia, 213.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XV.—Cholera, 218.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVI.—Malta fever, 237.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVII.—Leprosy, 246.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOD DEFICIENCY DISEASES\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVIII.—Beriberi, 268; Rice and beriberi, 272; Ship\r\n      beriberi, 285; Scurvy, 286; War oedema, 287.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIX.—Pellagra, 291; The diagnostic triad, 302.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XX.—Sprue, 313; Hill diarrhoea, 316.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXI.—Ancylostomiasis, 319.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXII.—Filarial infections, 336; Filaria bancrofti, 341;\r\n      Loa loa, 352; Onchocerca volvulus, 354; Dracunculus medinensis,\r\n      355.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXIII.—The schistosomiases, 357; Japanese schistosomiasis,\r\n      364.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXIV.—Minor helminthic infections, 368; Paragonimiasis,\r\n      368; Clonorchiosis, 371; Intestinal distomiasis, 373;\r\n      Strongyloides stercoralis, 374.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXV.—Table of important animal parasite diseases, 377;\r\n      Protozoal diseases, 377; Trematodes, 379; Nematodes, 380;\r\n      Cestodes, 381; Arthropodan diseases, 382.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INFECTIOUS GRANULOMATA OF THE TROPICS\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXVI.—Yaws, 384.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXVII.—Gangosa, 395.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXVIII.—Mycetoma, 399.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXIX.—Granuloma venereum, 404.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TROPICAL SKIN DISEASES\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXX.—Tropical ulcer, 407.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXI.—Tinea imbricata, 411.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXII.—Tinea cruris, 414.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXIII.—Pinta, 416.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXIV.—Minor tropical affections of the skin, 418;\r\n      Dermatophiliasis, 418; Tropical impetigo, 419; Piedra, 420;\r\n      Cutaneous myiasis, 421; Creeping eruption, 422; Craw-craw, 424.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TROPICAL DISEASES OF DISPUTED NATURE OR MINOR IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXV.—Verruga peruviana and Oroya fever, 425; Oroya fever,\r\n      425; Verruga peruviana, 428.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXVI.—Dengue, 431; Dengue-like fevers, 438; Phlebotomus\r\n      or Pappataci fever, 438; Seven-day fever, 440; Sand-fly and\r\n      three-day fever, 441; Six-day fever, 441.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXVII.—Tsutsugamushi or Japanese River fever, 442.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXVIII.—Spotted fever of the Rocky Mountains, 446.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXIX.—Typhus fever, 451.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XL.—Trench fever, 460.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLI.—Heat stroke and heat prostration, 464.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLII.—Climatic bubo, ainhum, goundou, juxta-articular\r\n      nodules and visceral mycoses, 469; Climatic bubo, 469; Ainhum,\r\n      471; Goundou, 472; Juxta-articular nodules, 472; Visceral\r\n      mycoses, 474.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II\r\n\r\n  DIAGNOSTICS OF TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLIII.—Diagnostic problems and procedures, together with\r\n      cosmopolitan diseases in the tropics, 477.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLIV.—Onset and the temperature chart in the diagnosis of\r\n      tropical diseases, 491.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLV.—Blood examinations in the diagnosis of tropical\r\n      diseases, 504.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLVI.—The circulatory, respiratory and lymphatic systems\r\n      together with anaemia, haemorrhages and oedema in tropical\r\n      diseases, 547.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLVII.—Jaundice and the liver and spleen in tropical\r\n      diseases, 557.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLVIII.—The cutaneous system and the organs of the special\r\n      senses, 561.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XLIX.—The urine and the genito-urinary apparatus in the\r\n      diagnosis of tropical diseases, 570.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER L.—The faeces and the alimentary tract in tropical\r\n      diseases, 581.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER LI.—The joints, bones and muscles in tropical diagnosis,\r\n      592.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER LII.—Neurological considerations in tropical diseases, 598.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nTROPICAL DISEASES AND THEIR TREATMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE OF MALARIAL PARASITES\r\n\r\nBenign Tertian Parasites\r\n\r\n  A1. _Schizonts._ 1.

In the clinically benign types of malaria we have\r\nthat of benign tertian, due to _P. vivax_, with a tertian periodicity\r\nand that of quartan, due to _P. malariae_ and showing a quartan\r\nor seventy-two hour periodicity. The clinically malignant type of\r\nmalaria is due to _P. falciparum_, the parasite of malignant tertian\r\nor aestivo-autumnal malaria.\r\n\r\n  The benign malarial fevers are characterized by a frank chill\r\n  and well marked distinctions of cold, hot and sweating stages.\r\n  In malignant tertian there is an indefinite or dumb chill with\r\n  prolonged hot stage. Diagnostic of malaria are periodicity,\r\n  parasites and splenic enlargement. The malignant tertian parasite\r\n  is the one responsible for the so-called cerebral and algid\r\n  manifestations of perniciousness. Man is the intermediate host of\r\n  the parasite while the sexual cycle or sporogony goes on in some\r\n  species of mosquito of the anopheline subfamily, the definitive\r\n  host.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Remittent Fever, Intermittent Fever, Ague, Marsh Fever,\r\nPaludism, Jungle Fever.\r\n\r\nFrench: Paludisme. German: Wechselfieber.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—Hippocrates, who considered malaria as intimately\r\n  connected with bile, divided the disease into quotidian, tertian\r\n  and quartan, differentiating such types of fever from continuous\r\n  fevers. It is interesting to note that Celsus recognized two types\r\n  of tertian fever, the one benign and similar to quartan fever, the\r\n  other far more dangerous, with a fever occupying thirty-six of the\r\n  forty-eight hours, not entirely subsiding in the remission, but\r\n  being only mitigated.\r\n\r\n  In the time of Caesar views were expressed by Varro that swamp air\r\n  might be the cause of malaria and furthermore that animals, so\r\n  small that the eye could not follow them, might transmit diseases\r\n  by way of the mouth or nose.\r\n\r\n  In the view of our present knowledge it is remarkable that Lancisi,\r\n  in 1718, should have associated marshes with the development of\r\n  gnats, which insects he thought could not only introduce with\r\n  their proboscides the putrefying organic matter of such swamps but\r\n  animalcules as well.\r\n\r\n  In 1638 Countess del Chinchon, the wife of the Viceroy of Peru, was\r\n  cured of an intermittent fever by the employment of the bark of\r\n  certain trees which bark was introduced into Europe in 1640. The\r\n  origin of the name cinchona is thus explained.\r\n\r\n  While Morton and Sydenham in 1666 noted the specific action of\r\n  cinchona in certain fevers it remained for Torti, in 1753, by the\r\n  use of cinchona, clinically to differentiate those fevers which\r\n  were cured by cinchona from those which failed to yield to this\r\n  specific. Quinine was not introduced until after 1820. Audouard, in\r\n  1803, was the first to draw attention to the splenic enlargement of\r\n  malaria.\r\n\r\n  The views of Nott and Beauperthuis as to transmission of malaria\r\n  and yellow fever by insects are considered under the latter disease.\r\n\r\n  In 1847 Meckel announced that the dark color of malarial organs\r\n  was due to a pigment and in 1848 Virchow noted that this pigment\r\n  was contained in cells. In 1875, Kelsch observed pigmented bodies\r\n  in malarial blood and in 1880 came to the conclusion that these\r\n  pigmented cells were diagnostic of malaria.\r\n\r\n  The year 1880 is the most important one in the history of malaria\r\n  for on November 6, 1880, Laveran, at Constantine, first saw the\r\n  parasites of malaria while carrying on investigations as to the\r\n  origin of the pigmented bodies and melaniferous leucocytes. He not\r\n  only noted the findings of spherical pigmented bodies but also of\r\n  crescents and in particular the flagellation of the male gamete\r\n  which demonstrated to him that these were living bodies.\r\n\r\n  The name _Oscillaria malariae_ was proposed on account of the\r\n  movements of the flagellate body, but had to be dropped as not\r\n  valid, the generic name _Oscillaria_ having been previously applied.\r\n\r\n  When these bodies were demonstrated to various Italian authorities,\r\n  in 1882, they were thought by them to be degenerated red cells.\r\n\r\n  It may be stated that at this time the Italians, influenced by\r\n  the work of Pasteur, were convinced that an organism, _Bacillus\r\n  malariae_, reported by Klebs and Crudeli (1879) to have been\r\n  isolated from water and soil of malarious districts, was the cause\r\n  of malaria. This bacillus was said to be cultivable on ordinary\r\n  media and to be capable, when injected into man, of producing\r\n  malaria.\r\n\r\n  By 1885 the Italians were convinced that the bodies discovered by\r\n  Laveran were the cause of malaria and Marchiafava, by staining with\r\n  methylene blue, noted the ring forms and the increase in size up\r\n  to that of the sporulating parasites. To Golgi we not only owe the\r\n  discovery that the malarial paroxysm coincides with the period when\r\n  the sporulating forms (merocytes) simultaneously reach maturity\r\n  but also the exact working out of the cycle of quartan malaria.\r\n  He even showed three stages of development of the parasites in a\r\n  triple quartan. It may be stated that Golgi, Marchiafava and Celli\r\n  are the ones to whom we owe our first knowledge of the existence\r\n  of different species of parasites for different kinds of malaria.\r\n  In these investigations they showed that as a rule they could\r\n  reproduce a certain type of malaria by injecting the blood of\r\n  such a case of malaria into a well man. Gerhardt, in 1884, was\r\n  the first to produce malaria by the injection of malarial blood.\r\n  Laveran insisted all this time that there was but a single species\r\n  of malaria. About this period a great deal of research was carried\r\n  on as to the origin of malarial parasites and it was found that\r\n  many animals harbored parasites similar to the malarial parasites\r\n  of man. In 1891 the chromatin staining method of Romanowsky was\r\n  introduced which by bringing out the variations in chromatin\r\n  distribution led to more accurate study of species and cycles.\r\n\r\n  Our present exact knowledge as to the existence of 3 species of\r\n  malaria is largely due to the careful examinations made by Koch of\r\n  fresh and stained malarial blood preparations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Geographical distribution of malaria.]\r\n\r\n  In 1894 Manson formulated the hypothesis of the mosquito\r\n  transmission of malaria. He based this upon the fact that the\r\n  flagellation of the male gamete does not take place for several\r\n  minutes after the removal of the blood from the peripheral\r\n  circulation. He also suggested that larvae might feed upon infected\r\n  mosquitoes dying upon the water and thus acquire the disease.\r\n\r\n  Ross for two years had mosquitoes feed upon the blood of malarial\r\n  patients which contained crescents but as he used insects of the\r\n  genera _Culex_ and _Stegomyia_ he failed to observe development\r\n  in the tissues of the mosquitoes. In 1897 he used 8 dappled-wing\r\n  mosquitoes (Anopheline) and in two of these, upon dissection, he\r\n  noted pigmentary bodies different from anything he had observed in\r\n  hundreds of dissections of other mosquitoes. At this time he was\r\n  forced to discontinue this work for about six months.\r\n\r\n  In 1886 Metschnikoff from observation of sporulating parasites in\r\n  the brain capillaries at the autopsy of a malarial case considered\r\n  them to be coccidial in nature. In 1892 Pfeiffer, studying the\r\n  Coccidia showed that there was an endogenous cycle going on in\r\n  the epithelial cells as well as the long known exogenous cycle\r\n  connected with the ingestion of oocysts passing out in the feces\r\n  of an animal infected with coccidiosis. He suggested that malaria\r\n  might similarly have an exogenous cycle as well as the well-known\r\n  endogenous one. Opie noted hyaline and granular forms of parasites\r\n  in the blood of crows and MacCallum, working with this malaria-like\r\n  disease of birds (_Halteridium_), observed the fecundation of a\r\n  granular female parasite by the flagellum-like process of the\r\n  hyaline male cell.\r\n\r\n  In 1898, in India, working with a malarial disease of sparrows\r\n  (_Proteosoma_), Ross infected 22 out of 28 healthy sparrows by\r\n  mosquitoes which had previously fed on sick sparrows. He noted in\r\n  the culicine mosquito employed for transmission the same cycle of\r\n  development as that subsequently worked out for human malaria, in\r\n  anopheline mosquitoes, by Grassi and Bignami, in Italy.\r\n\r\n  Koch’s great work in connection with malaria was to demonstrate\r\n  that the malaria-like infections of other animals had no part in\r\n  the causation of human malaria and that the malarial parasite could\r\n  only circulate between man and certain mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n  In order to demonstrate conclusively the connection between\r\n  infected mosquitoes and malaria Sambon and Low lived for three of\r\n  the most malarious months of 1900, in one of the most malarious\r\n  sections of the Roman Campagna, in a mosquito screened hut and did\r\n  not contract malaria.\r\n\r\n  Infected mosquitoes were also sent to London from Italy and allowed\r\n  to feed upon Doctor P. T. Manson and Mr. George Warren. After\r\n  a period of incubation these volunteers came down with typical\r\n  malaria with parasites in the blood.\r\n\r\n  In 1911 Bass first cultivated the parasites of malaria.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Malaria is so widely distributed\r\n  over all parts of the tropical and subtropical world that it would\r\n  require too much space to give its geographical distribution other\r\n  than as given in the accompanying chart. The malaria belt may be\r\n  said to extend from 60° N. to 40° S. Many of the islands of the\r\n  Pacific are exempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—There are at least three species of animal parasites\r\nwhich produce human malaria, _Plasmodium vivax_, the cause of\r\nbenign tertian, _P. malariae_ of quartan and _P. falciparum_ of\r\naestivo-autumnal. These parasites belong to the haemamoeba type of\r\nthe order Haemosporidia, of the class Sporozoa and of the phylum\r\nProtozoa.\r\n\r\n  This type of Haemosporidia is characterized by invasion of red\r\n  cells, amoeboid movement, pigment production and the extrusion of\r\n  flagellum-like processes from the male sporont after the blood is\r\n  taken from the animal and allowed to cool.\r\n\r\n  Other Haemosporidia which are very important in diseases of\r\n  domesticated animals, but not for man, are those of the piroplasm\r\n  type.\r\n\r\n  These parasites of the red cells do not produce pigment and do\r\n  not “exflagellate.” It is to parasites of this type that some\r\n  authorities have ascribed the cause of blackwater fever, a\r\n  condition undoubtedly connected with malaria.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought proper by some to consider the malarial parasites\r\nas belonging to two genera, the genus _Plasmodium_, characterized\r\nby round sexual forms and including _P. vivax_ and _P. malariae_ and\r\nthe genus _Laverania_, characterized by crescent-shaped sexual forms\r\nand including but one species _L. malariae_, that of aestivo-autumnal\r\nmalaria.\r\n\r\n  Craig recognizes a quotidian form and a tertian form for the\r\n  aestivo-autumnal parasite. Manson formerly held the view that three\r\n  different species of crescent-bearing parasites were concerned\r\n  in malignant infections; one, of tertian periodicity, _Laverania\r\n  malariae_, and two, of quotidian periodicity, _L. praecox_, a\r\n  pigmented form, and _L. immaculata_, a form in which pigment is\r\n  only observed in the crescent formation and does not exist in the\r\n  ring form schizonts. He has abandoned this view. Stephens has noted\r\n  a parasite which has more nuclear material than _P. falciparum_\r\n  (_P. tenue_).\r\n\r\n  _Malaria of Animals_.—Other Haemosporidia of the haemamoeba type\r\n  are found in birds, monkeys, bats, squirrels and possibly in\r\n  reptiles (the parasites of reptiles, while intracorpuscular and\r\n  pigment producing, do not exflagellate). Of particular interest is\r\n  the so-called bird malaria or _Proteosoma_, a parasite very similar\r\n  to the human malarial ones.\r\n\r\n  The life cycle of this parasite was demonstrated before that of the\r\n  malarial parasites of man.\r\n\r\n  Although Koch in his work showed that these malaria-like parasites\r\n  of other animals were not infectious for man, Fermi has recently\r\n  carried out well-controlled experiments, by feeding laboratory\r\n  bred anophelines on the blood of various animals showing such\r\n  infections, and subsequently on men, with invariably negative\r\n  results.\r\n\r\nAccumulated experience shows that man is not susceptible to any of\r\nthe animal malarias and that the three human species can only exist\r\nin man as an intermediate host and in certain species of anopheline\r\nmosquitoes as definitive hosts. Culicine mosquitoes never transmit\r\nmalaria.\r\n\r\n  _Malaria-Transmitting Mosquitoes_.—In the United States,\r\n  _Cellia albimana_, _C. argyrotarsis_, _Anopheles crucians_,\r\n  _A. quadrimaculatus_ and _A. pseudopunctipennis_ are efficient\r\n  transmitters of malaria. Rather remarkable is the experience of\r\n  Beyer in New Orleans that _A. crucians_ will only transmit _P.\r\n  falciparum_ while _A. quadrimaculatus_ will transmit _P. vivax_ and\r\n  _P. malariae_, but not _P. falciparum_. Further experiments have\r\n  shown that _A. crucians_ will transmit _P. vivax_ as well as _P.\r\n  falciparum_.\r\n\r\n  As showing the uncertainty attaching to the question of a certain\r\n  anopheline species being efficient hosts for malaria may be cited\r\n  the case of _A. punctipennis._ This species has been frequently\r\n  reported as incapable of transmitting malaria and quite recently\r\n  Mitzmain reported experiments on 219 females of the species which\r\n  had fed on crescent containing blood and which were dissected\r\n  from three to thirty-eight days after such feedings with negative\r\n  findings in stomach and salivary glands. Furthermore, these\r\n  mosquitoes failed to transmit malaria to healthy persons. Control\r\n  experiments with _A. quadrimaculatus_ and _A. crucians_ were\r\n  successful. In June, 1916, Dr. King reported 33% of positive\r\n  findings after dissection of _A. punctipennis_ which had fed on\r\n  malignant tertian cases and 85% of success where the man bitten\r\n  had benign tertian malaria. These results showed as high a degree\r\n  of success as that obtained with the control _A. crucians_ and _A.\r\n  quadrimaculatus_.\r\n\r\n  From the above it must be evident that there are other factors\r\n  involved besides that of the host species as both Mitzmain and King\r\n  are expert epidemiologists.\r\n\r\n  A species which may be the chief transmitter in one country may\r\n  be unimportant, though present, in another country. Thus _Cellia\r\n  albimana_ is the chief malarial transmitter of Panama although _C.\r\n  argyrotarsis_ is present. In Brazil the conditions are reversed,\r\n  probably due to _C. albimana_ thriving best where slightly brackish\r\n  pools of standing water abound, as in Panama.\r\n\r\n  In the Philipines _A. febrifer_ seems the important transmitter. It\r\n  freely enters houses and is a vicious biter.\r\n\r\n  In India the species which seem most active in transmitting malaria\r\n  are _Myzomyia culicifacies_ and _M. listoni_; while in Africa, _M.\r\n  funesta_ is very efficient.\r\n\r\n  In Europe _A. maculipennis_ and _A. bifurcatus_ are important.\r\n\r\nThe following species of anophelines selected from the different\r\ngenera are important transmitters of malaria.\r\n\r\n  _Anopheles maculipennis_.—Wings with four spots located at bases\r\n  of both forked cells and of second and third longitudinal veins. No\r\n  costal spots. Palpi yellowish brown and unbanded. Legs unbanded.\r\n\r\n  _Anopheles punctipennis_.—Wings with black costa showing yellow\r\n  spots at apical third and at apex. The apical spot involves the\r\n  first long vein and upper branch of first fork cell. The larger\r\n  spot at the apical third passes through the first long vein and to\r\n  the second vein just before it branches. In _A. pseudopunctipennis_\r\n  the markings are as above but the fringe has yellow spots.\r\n\r\n  _Myzomyia funesta_.—Wings with four yellow spots on a black costa\r\n  and two black line spots on third longitudinal vein. Palps with\r\n  three white rings. Proboscis unbanded. Legs with faint apical bands.\r\n\r\n  _Pyretophorus costalis_.—Costa black with five or six small yellow\r\n  spots. Palps with two narrow white bands and white tip. Femora and\r\n  tibiae with yellow spots. Apical tarsal bands.\r\n\r\n  _Myzorhynchus pseudopictus_.—Black costa with two pale yellow\r\n  spots. Wing fringe unspotted. Black palps with four pale bands.\r\n  Apex of palps white.\r\n\r\n  _Nyssorhynchus fuliginosus_.—Black costa with three large yellow\r\n  spots. Numerous black dots on the longitudinal veins. Palpi black\r\n  with white tip and two narrow white bands. Last three hind tarsal\r\n  segments white.\r\n\r\n  _Cellia argyrotarsis_.—Black costa with two distinct and several\r\n  smaller white spots.\r\n\r\nWhile anophelines are usually rural or at any rate preferring the\r\nsuburbs of cities yet we can differentiate between domesticated and\r\nwild anophelines, these latter keeping away from man and consequently\r\nnot playing a transmitting rôle.\r\n\r\n  Another factor in their becoming an efficient host appears to rest\r\n  in the feeding habits of such anophelines, one which is voracious\r\n  and fills and then ejects by rectum the blood taken from the\r\n  malarial patient is more apt to be a transmitter than a species\r\n  less greedy.\r\n\r\nBy an _efficient host_ is meant a species in which full development\r\nof the parasite takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORY OF THE MALARIAL PARASITE\r\n\r\nMalaria can be transmitted by subcutaneous or intravenous injection\r\nof the blood of a patient with the disease into a well person, the\r\nsame type being reproduced.\r\n\r\n=Transmission of Malaria.=—Such a method of transmission is only of\r\nscientific interest and the regular method is as follows: An infected\r\nanopheline at the time of feeding on the human blood introduces\r\nthrough a minute channel in the hypopharynx the infecting sporozoite\r\nof the sexual cycle.\r\n\r\n  When man is first infected by sporozoites we have starting up a\r\n  nonsexual cycle (schizogony) which is completed in from forty-eight\r\n  to seventy-two hours, according to the species of the parasite.\r\n  The falciform sporozite bores into a red cell, assumes a round\r\n  shape and continues to enlarge (schizont). Approaching maturity,\r\n  it shows division into a varying number of spore-like bodies. At\r\n  this stage the parasite is termed a merocyte. When the merocyte\r\n  ruptures, these spore-like bodies or merozoites enter a fresh cell\r\n  and develop as before.\r\n\r\n=Malarial Toxin.=—At the time that the merocyte ruptures it is\r\nsupposed that a toxin is given off which causes the malarial paroxysm.\r\n\r\n  Rosenau, by injecting, intravenously, filtered blood, taken from\r\n  a patient at the time of sporulation of the parasites caused a\r\n  malarial paroxysm. No parasites developed later. Another man who\r\n  received a small amount of unfiltered blood allowed a slight\r\n  paroxysm and four days later showed parasites in his blood. Hence\r\n  the parasite will not pass through the pores of a Berkefeld filter.\r\n\r\n=Schizogony.=—The nonsexual cycle goes on by geometric progression\r\nfrom the first introduction of the sporozoite, but it is usually\r\nabout two weeks before a sufficient number of merocytes rupture\r\nsimultaneously to produce sufficient toxin for symptoms (period of\r\nincubation). This cycle is termed _schizogony_. It is considered\r\nthat there must be several hundred parasites per cubic millimeter\r\nsporulating to be capable of producing symptoms.\r\n\r\n  =Gametes.=—After a varying time, whether by reason of necessity\r\n  for renewal of vigor of the parasite by a respite from sporulation,\r\n  or whether from a standpoint of survival of the species, sexual\r\n  forms (gametes) develop. Some think that sporozoites of sexual and\r\n  nonsexual character are injected at the same time. It is usually\r\n  considered, however, that sexual forms develop from preexisting\r\n  nonsexual parasites. The developing gametes are often termed\r\n  sporonts. Strictly, the sexual parasites in the blood should be\r\n  called gametocytes. The gametes take about twice as long to reach\r\n  maturity as schizonts. The life of a crescent has been estimated\r\n  as about ten days and that of the gametes of benign tertian and\r\n  quartan about one-half this period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Sexual (sporogony in mosquito) and nonsexual\r\n(schizogony in man) cycle of the malarial parasite. The sporogony\r\ndiagram to the left shows in lower portion the fertilization of the\r\nfemale gamete by the microgamete. The vermiculus stage of the zygote\r\nis shown boring into the walls of the mosquito’s stomach to later\r\nbecome the more mature zygote packed with sporozoites as shown in\r\nthe upper diagram of the developmental processes in the mosquito’s\r\nstomach.]\r\n\r\n  =Sporogony.=—The gametes show two types the one which contains\r\n  more pigment, has less chromatin, and stains more deeply blue is\r\n  the female—a macrogametocyte; the other with more chromatin, less\r\n  pigment, and staining grayish green or light blue is the male—a\r\n  microgametocyte. When the gametes are taken into the stomach of the\r\n  Anophelinae, the male cell throws off spermatozoa-like projections,\r\n  which have an active lashing movement and break off from the now\r\n  useless cell carrier and are thereafter termed microgametes.\r\n  These fertilize the macrogametes and this body now becomes a\r\n  zygote. (Following nuclear reduction with formation of polar\r\n  bodies the macrogametocyte becomes a macrogamete). This process\r\n  of exflagellation can be observed in a wet preparation under the\r\n  microscope. There is first seen a very active movement of the\r\n  pigment of the male gamete and finally long delicate bulbous-tipped\r\n  flagellum-like processes are thrown off (exflagellated) and push\r\n  aside the red cells by their progressive motion. MacCallum saw a\r\n  female _Halteridium_ fertilized by the microgamete, after which it\r\n  was capable of a worm-like motion (vermiculus or ookinete).\r\n\r\n  By a boring-like movement the vermiculus stage of the zygote goes\r\n  through the walls of the mosquito’s stomach, stopping just under\r\n  the delicate outer layer of the stomach or mid-gut. In three or\r\n  four days after fertilization the zygote becomes encapsulated and\r\n  is then often called an oocyst. It continues to enlarge until about\r\n  the end of one week it has grown to be about 50µ in diameter and\r\n  has become packed with hundreds of delicate falciform bodies. Some\r\n  only contain a few hundred, others several thousand.\r\n\r\n  =Zygotes.=—In some of his observations Darling has noted that the\r\n  zygote of benign tertian malaria grows larger and more rapidly\r\n  than that of aestivo-autumnal and that the pigment is clumped\r\n  rather than in belts or lines as with aestivo-autumnal. Darling has\r\n  also noted that mosquitoes do not tend to become infected unless\r\n  the gamete carrying man has more than 12 gametes to the cubic\r\n  millimeter of blood. Rouband notes that the oocysts of _P. vivax_\r\n  are feebly refractile with fine granules of gray pigment in loose\r\n  chains while _P. falciparum_ ones are highly refractile with large\r\n  grains of black pigment. At a temperature of 25°C. vivax completes\r\n  its cycle in 11 days while the zygote of the crescent requires 14\r\n  days. Apparently it is possible for a mosquito to carry both types\r\n  of parasites.\r\n\r\n  The capsule of the mature zygote ruptures about the tenth day\r\n  and the sporozoites are thrown off into the body cavity. They\r\n  make their way to the salivary glands and thence, by way of the\r\n  veneno-salivary duct, in the hypopharynx, they are introduced into\r\n  the circulation of the person bitten by the mosquito, and start a\r\n  nonsexual cycle. As the sexual life takes place in the mosquito,\r\n  this insect is the definitive host and man only the intermediate\r\n  host. The sexual cycle or _sporogony_ in the mosquito takes about\r\n  ten to twelve days.\r\n\r\n=Efficient Mosquito Hosts.=—It must be remembered that only certain\r\ngenera and species of Anophelinae are known malaria transmitters;\r\nthus Stephens and Christophers, in dissecting 496 mosquitoes of\r\nthe species _M. rossi_, did not find a single gland infected with\r\nsporozoites.\r\n\r\n  With _M. culicifacies_, however, 12 in 259 showed infection. A\r\n  mosquito which is capable of carrying out the complete sporogonous\r\n  cycle is an efficient host and in the case of malaria the mosquito\r\n  is the definitive host (sexual life of parasite).\r\n\r\n=Malarial Index.=—Mosquito dissection is one method of determining\r\nthe endemicity of malaria or the _malarial index_. There are two\r\nother methods: 1. by noting the prevalence of enlarged spleens,\r\nand 2. by determining the number of inhabitants showing malarial\r\nparasites in the blood. This index is best determined from children\r\nbetween two and ten years of age, as children under two show for a\r\ngeneral average too high a proportion of parasites in the peripheral\r\nblood while those over ten years of age show too great an incidence\r\nof enlarged spleens.\r\n\r\n  Barber working in the Philippines with children from five to ten\r\n  years of age obtained a spleen index of 13.3 and a parasitic index\r\n  of 11.\r\n\r\n=As Before Stated there are Three Species of Malarial Parasites:= 1.\r\n_Plasmodium vivax_, that of benign tertian—cycle, forty-eight hours;\r\n2. _Plasmodium malariae_, that of quartan—cycle, seventy-two hours;\r\nand 3. _Plasmodium falciparum_, that of aestivo-autumnal or malignant\r\ntertian—cycle of forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n  =Multiple Infections.=—Variations in cycles may be produced by\r\n  infected mosquitoes biting on successive nights, so that one crop\r\n  will mature and sporulate twenty-four hours before the second.\r\n  This would give a quotidian type of fever. In aestivo-autumnal\r\n  infections anticipation and retardation in the sporulation cause\r\n  a very protracted paroxysm, lasting eighteen to thirty-six hours;\r\n  this tends to give a continued or remittent fever instead of the\r\n  characteristic intermittent type.\r\n\r\n  =Plasmodium Vivax.=—In fresh, unstained preparations, taken at\r\n  the time of the paroxysm or shortly afterward, the benign tertian\r\n  schizont, or nonsexual parasite, is seen as a grayish white, round\r\n  or oval body, whose outlines cannot be distinctly differentiated\r\n  from the infected red cell. They are about one-fifth of the\r\n  diameter of the red cell and are best picked up by noting their\r\n  amoeboid activity. In about eighteen hours fine pigment particles\r\n  appear and make them more distinct. After twenty-four hours the\r\n  lively motion of the pigment and the projection of pseudopod-like\r\n  processes, in a pale and swollen red cell, make their recognition\r\n  very easy. When about thirty to thirty-six hours old the amoeboid\r\n  movement ceases. Approaching the merocyte stage the pigment tends\r\n  to clump into one or two pigment masses and one can recognize\r\n  small, oval, highly refractile bodies within the sporulating\r\n  parasite.\r\n\r\n  The gametes or sexual forms do not show amoeboid movement, but\r\n  the fully developed gamete, which is generally larger than the\r\n  red cells, has abundant pigment, which is actively motile in\r\n  the male gamete and nonmotile in the female. The male gamete\r\n  is more refractile, is rarely larger than a red cell and shows\r\n  yellow-brown, short rod-like particles of pigment. About fifteen\r\n  minutes after the making of a fresh preparation these male gametes\r\n  throw out four to eight long, slender, lashing processes, which\r\n  are about 15 to 20 microns long. These spermatozoon-like bodies\r\n  now break off from the useless parent cell and with a serpent-like\r\n  motion glide away in search of a female gamete, knocking the red\r\n  cells about in their passage through the blood plasma.\r\n\r\n  The female gamete is larger than a red cell, is rather granular and\r\n  has more abundant dark-brown pigment than the male.\r\n\r\n  =Stained Smears.=—In dried smears, stained by some Romanowsky\r\n  method, as that of Wright, Leishman or Giemsa, we note small\r\n  oval blue rings, about one-fifth of the diameter of the infected\r\n  yellowish-pink erythrocyte. One side of the ring is distinctly\r\n  broader than the rather fine opposite end, which seems to hold\r\n  a round, yellowish-brown dot, the chromatin dot, and has a\r\n  resemblance to a signet ring. These small tertian rings of the\r\n  nonsexual parasites (schizont) are seen about the time of the\r\n  commencement of the sweating stage of the paroxysm. Two chromatin\r\n  dots in the line of the ring are rare as is also true of more than\r\n  one ring in a red cell.\r\n\r\n  When the parasite is about twenty-four hours old we note that\r\n  it contains much pigment and has an amoeboid or multiple\r\n  figure-of-eight contour, is about three-fourths the size of a red\r\n  cell and that the infected red cell is about one and one-half times\r\n  as large as in the beginning and presents a washed-out appearance.\r\n  It is an anaemic-looking cell. We also note, as characteristic of\r\n  a benign tertian infection, reddish-yellow dots in the pale red\r\n  cell, which are known as Schüffner’s dots. These, practically, are\r\n  characteristic for benign tertian.\r\n\r\n  A few hours before the completion of its forty-eight-hour cycle the\r\n  contained pigment begins to clump, the chromatin to divide and,\r\n  finally, we have a sporulating parasite, in which the 16 to 20\r\n  small, round, bluish bodies, with chromatin dots, are irregularly\r\n  distributed over the area of the merocyte.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—_Plasmodium vivax._ (Benign tertian)\r\nDevelopment of schizonts of nonsexual cycle in peripheral blood of\r\nman. Red cell swollen and stains feebly. Note Schüffner’s dots. X\r\n2200. (MacNeal after Doflein.)]\r\n\r\n  The gametes, or sexual parasites, show a thicker blue ring and have\r\n  the chromatin dot in the center of the ring. The pigmentation of\r\n  the half-grown gametes is more marked than that of schizonts of\r\n  equal size. The shape of the gametes is not amoeboid, as is that\r\n  of the twenty-four to thirty-six-hour-old schizont, but round or\r\n  oval. _The full-grown gametes have the pigment distributed and the\r\n  chromatin in a single aggregation—just the opposite of nonsexual\r\n  parasites._ The male gamete stains a light grayish blue and has\r\n  a very large amount of chromatin, usually centrally placed. The\r\n  female gamete stains a pure blue, has only about one-tenth as much\r\n  chromatin as plasma, with the chromatin often placed at one side.\r\n  The pigment of the female gamete is dark brown while that of the\r\n  male is yellowish brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—_Plasmodium vivax_.

(MacNeal after Doflein.)]\r\n\r\n  =Plasmodium Malariae.=—In fresh preparations the young quartan\r\n  schizont has only slight amoeboid movement and, as development\r\n  proceeds, the rather dark brown, coarse pigment tends to arrange\r\n  itself peripherally about the band-shaped or oval parasite.\r\n\r\n  The infected red cell shows but little change. At the end of\r\n  seventy-two hours the rather regular daisy form of the merocyte is\r\n  more distinct than that of the benign tertian merocyte.\r\n\r\n  The distinctions between the male and female gametes are similar to\r\n  those of the benign tertian gametes. In Romanowsky-stained smears\r\n  it is difficult to distinguish the young quartan schizont from\r\n  the benign tertian one but, after twenty-four hours, the tendency\r\n  of the quartan schizont to assume equatorial band forms across a\r\n  red cell of normal size and staining characteristics and without\r\n  Schüffner’s dots makes the differentiation easy. In the fully\r\n  developed sporulating parasite or merocyte the eight merozoites\r\n  assume a regular distribution, giving it a daisy appearance.\r\n\r\n  The gametes show practically the characteristics of the benign\r\n  tertian ones but are smaller.\r\n\r\n  =Plasmodium Falciparum.=—The young schizont of malignant tertian\r\n  is extremely difficult to detect in fresh preparations, there being\r\n  noted early in the rather long continued, hot stage, as small\r\n  crater-like dots, about one-sixth of the diameter of a red cell\r\n  which, however, show an active amoeboid movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—_Plasmodium vivax._  Mature schizont and\r\nmerocyte. Found in the blood just before and at onset of chill. X\r\n2200. (MacNeal after Doflein.)]\r\n\r\n  Malignant tertian blood tends to show rather marked vacuolation\r\n  of the red cells and these central vacuoles have a resemblance\r\n  to young ring forms. The malarial parasites are most often\r\n  peripherally placed and they do not enlarge and diminish in size on\r\n  focusing up and down as do the vacuoles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—_Plasmodium malariae._ (Quartan.) Development\r\nof nonsexual parasite in blood of man. X 2200. (From MacNeal after\r\nDoflein.)]\r\n\r\n  Later on in the hot stage these ring-like dots enlarge to become\r\n  about one-third of the diameter of a red cell, most often occupying\r\n  the periphery of the infected red cell. About this time, or at the\r\n  very commencement of the pigmentation, the schizont-containing red\r\n  cells disappear from the peripheral circulation so that the further\r\n  development is rarely observed in blood specimens.\r\n\r\n  The infected cell is brassy in color and shrunken in shape—it\r\n  shows evidences of degeneration. The gametes appear as\r\n  crescent-shaped bodies, which are absolutely characteristic of\r\n  malignant tertian, the male gamete being more hyaline and delicate\r\n  while the female one is more granular and larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—_Plasmodium falciparum._ (Malignant tertian)\r\nNonsexual cycle in blood and internal organs of man. Note multiple\r\ninfections of single red cell. (From MacNeal after Doflein.)]\r\n\r\n  In Romanowsky-stained preparations we see, while the fever is\r\n  sustained, small hair-like rings, with geometrical outline, with\r\n  frequently two chromatin dots in one end of the ring and a single\r\n  red cell often showing two or more of these young rings. The rings\r\n  are often seen as if plastered on the periphery of the red cells\r\n  or as if having destroyed a rounded section of the rim of the\r\n  red cell. As the fever declines the rings tend to disappear from\r\n  the peripheral circulation. The infected red cells often show\r\n  polychromatophilia and distortion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Tertian malarial parasite, one red cell\r\nshowing malarial stippling. (Todd.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 9.—Estivo-autumnal malarial parasites, and small\r\nring forms and crescents. (Todd.)]\r\n\r\n  In old aestivo-autumnal cases, or those with severe infection, we\r\n  may see adult rings and merocytes, which latter are smaller than\r\n  those of benign tertian, show from 10 to 12 irregularly placed\r\n  merozoites and a sharply clumped mass of pigment.\r\n\r\n  The gametes are the striking crescent-shaped bodies and these show\r\n  the distinctions of blue-staining for the female, with lighter\r\n  gray-blue to purplish staining and abundance of chromatin for\r\n  the male. The chromatin staining of crescents does not stand out\r\n  so well as that of the round form gametes of benign tertian and\r\n  quartan.\r\n\r\n  The black pigment of the female tends to be clumped toward the\r\n  center while the rather generally distributed pigment of the male\r\n  is reddish brown rather than black in a stained preparation.\r\n\r\n  This variation of pigment color may be due to the effect of\r\n  chromatin staining, as the black of the pigment is the same in male\r\n  and female gametes in fresh blood preparations.\r\n\r\n_Stained Smear Preferred._—As regards differentiation of species\r\nand cycle the examination of stained smears is more satisfactory and\r\ndefinite, as well as less time consuming. Still, one obtains many\r\npoints of differentiation in the fresh preparation and should study\r\nsuch a preparation while carrying out the staining of his dried smear.\r\n\r\n               UNSTAINED SPECIMEN (FRESH BLOOD)\r\n  --------------+-------------------+------------------+--------------------\r\n                |    P. vivax       |   P. malariae    |   P. falciparum\r\n                | (benign tertian)  |    (quartan)     |(malignant tertian)\r\n                |                   |                  | (aestivo-autumnal)\r\n  --------------+-------------------+------------------+--------------------\r\n  Character of  |Swollen and light  |About the size and|Tendency to distor-\r\n   the infected | in color after    | color of a normal| tion of red cell\r\n   red cell.    | eighteen  hours.  | red cell.        | rather than crena-\r\n                |                   |                  | tion.

Such parasites lack definiteness of\r\n  outline and show poor chromatin staining. The gametes do not seem\r\n  to show these effects from the drug.\r\n\r\n  =Certain questions connected with the life history of the malarial\r\n  parasite in man which are of interest.=\r\n\r\n  1. _Extracellular location._—It is usual to consider the parasite\r\n  as developing within a red cell and in this position to destroy the\r\n  red cell. Rowley-Lawson, however, thinks that the parasites are\r\n  exclusively extracellular and that they adhere to the red cells by\r\n  loop-like pseudopodia which encircle a portion of the red cell and\r\n  digest the haemoglobin of such an area.\r\n\r\n  2. _Relapses._—There are several views as to the etiology of\r\n  relapses in malaria. These views are taken up under relapses (see\r\n  page 35).\r\n\r\n  3. _Malarial toxin._—Nature of the toxic material thrown off by\r\n  the parasite at the time of simultaneous sporulation. Rosenau’s\r\n  experiments tend to show that there is a fever-producing toxin\r\n  thrown off at this time. Other authors have thought that a\r\n  haemolysin and an endotheliolysin were thrown off at the same\r\n  time. Brown considers that the pigment produced by the parasite,\r\n  in its metabolism of the haemoglobin of the red cell, may act as a\r\n  haemolysin, he having found that intravenous injections of haematin\r\n  were capable of producing marked anaemia. It is well known that\r\n  a far greater number of red cells are destroyed in a paroxysm\r\n  than would be accounted for by the actual percentage of red cells\r\n  destroyed by parasites. The endothelial cells take up actively this\r\n  malarial pigment or haemozoin and are damaged or destroyed thereby.\r\n  Haematin injections also tend to destroy leucocytes and platelets.\r\n\r\n  Rowley-Lawson is of the opinion that the greater red cell\r\n  destruction than would be represented by percentage of cells\r\n  showing parasites is explained by parasites migrating from cell to\r\n  cell so that many red cells may be destroyed by a single parasite.\r\n\r\n  4. _Transmission to larvae._—There has been an idea that\r\n  sporozoites might enter the ovaries and ova as well as the salivary\r\n  glands so that a second generation of mosquitoes might transmit\r\n  malaria. There is no proof that such a method is ever operative.\r\n\r\n  5. _Congenital malaria._—There has been some question as to the\r\n  possibility of congenital malaria. Heiser has recently reported the\r\n  case of an infant which showed crescents in its blood by the end of\r\n  one week from birth. The mother showed the same infection and the\r\n  child must have been infected through the placental circulation.\r\n\r\n  Clark in numerous examinations of the blood of the new-born\r\n  failed to find infection even when the mother’s blood teemed with\r\n  parasites. In one case where the child showed infection shortly\r\n  after birth there had been an accident to the placenta and he\r\n  believes that instances of so-called congenital malaria are to be\r\n  explained in this way.\r\n\r\n  6. _Cultivation of parasite._—As to cultivation of malarial\r\n  parasites. Bass takes from 10 to 20 cc. of blood from the malarial\r\n  patient’s vein in a centrifuge tube which contains 1/10 cc. of\r\n  50% glucose solution. A glass rod, or a piece of tubing extending\r\n  to the bottom of the centrifuge tube is used to defibrinate the\r\n  blood. After centrifugalizing there should be at least one inch\r\n  of serum above the cell sediment. The parasites develop in the\r\n  upper cell layer, about 1/50 to 1/20 inch from the top. All of the\r\n  parasites contained in the deeper-lying red cells die. To observe\r\n  the development, red cells from this upper 1/20 inch portion are\r\n  drawn up with a capillary bulb pipette.\r\n\r\n  Should the cultivation of more than one generation be desired,\r\n  the leucocyte upper layer must be carefully pipetted off, as the\r\n  leucocytes immediately destroy the merozoites. Only the parasites\r\n  within red cells escape phagocytosis. Sexual parasites are much\r\n  more resistant. Bass thinks he observed parthenogenesis. The\r\n  temperature should be from 40° to 41°C. and strict anaerobic\r\n  conditions observed. Aestivo-autumnal organisms are more resistant\r\n  than benign tertian ones. Dextrose seems to be an essential for the\r\n  development of the parasites.\r\n\r\n  Bass considers that _P. vivax_ has a disc-like structure which\r\n  enables it to squeeze through the brain capillaries while adult\r\n  schizonts of _P. falciparum_ have a solid oval form which causes\r\n  them to be caught in the capillaries.\r\n\r\n  The Thompsons have rather simplified the method of Bass. They draw\r\n  10 cc. of blood into a test tube containing the usual amount of\r\n  glucose solution. They then defibrinate the blood by stirring with\r\n  a thick wire for about five minutes and remove the wire with the\r\n  adhering clot. They then pour this defibrinated blood into several\r\n  small sterile test tubes, which should contain at least a one-inch\r\n  column. Rubber caps are adjusted over the cotton plugs and the\r\n  tubes placed in the incubator. They note the tendency of cultures\r\n  of _P. falciparum_ to agglutinate which is not true of _P. vivax_.\r\n\r\n  They think this agglutination the great cause of the plugging of\r\n  capillaries in pernicious malaria. They note 32 merozoites as\r\n  maximum number in sporulation of _P. falciparum_ while _P. vivax_\r\n  has usually 16 or more, but never as many as 32.\r\n\r\n  This would explain the shorter incubation period of malignant\r\n  tertian. The pigment of _P. falciparum_ clumps much earlier in the\r\n  developing schizont than that of _P. vivax_ and is much coarser and\r\n  more discrete.\r\n\r\n  While Bass thought he noted parthenogenesis in cultures others have\r\n  failed to observe any evidence of it.\r\n\r\n  7. _Immunity._—As to immunity. There is no real immunity to\r\n  malaria, it is a continuance of the infection, but the parasites\r\n  are not in sufficient numbers to give rise to fever. If, however,\r\n  the patient becomes chilled or fatigued or otherwise depressed,\r\n  fever results.\r\n\r\n  This apparent immunity is also kept up by reinfection, because\r\n  if natives leave the locality for a length of time they lose it.\r\n  Patients who show this apparent immunity to one form of malaria\r\n  have no such resistance to the other types. Bass states that immune\r\n  bodies are produced in malaria and that immune processes contribute\r\n  to control of the infection, but that it is not lasting and is not\r\n  effective against new infection.\r\n\r\n  8. _Perniciousness._—Causes of perniciousness. This is taken up\r\n  under perniciousness in malaria. (See page 31.)\r\n\r\n  9. _Quinine-affected parasite._—Effect of quinine on malarial\r\n  parasites. It is usually thought that the merozoites at the time\r\n  of being thrown off from the merocyte are most vulnerable, while\r\n  the gametes are only slightly affected, if at all. Still, the young\r\n  forms from which gametes develop are destroyed. Quinine causes\r\n  parasites to disappear from the peripheral circulation and produces\r\n  degenerative changes in such parasites as may remain. Bass thinks\r\n  that quinine makes the red cell permeable to the lytic action of\r\n  serum. Anaemia may cause degenerative changes in parasites similar\r\n  to that from quinine.\r\n\r\n  10. _Anaphylaxis and the paroxysm._—Abrami has brought forward\r\n  evidence in favor of the malarial paroxysm being due to the\r\n  outpouring of merozoites into the blood plasma which act as\r\n  foreign antigen. It is noted that the dissemination of merozoites\r\n  takes place some hours before the cold stage which is one of the\r\n  manifestations of anaphylactic shock. They note a leucopenia and\r\n  lowering of the blood pressure preceding the paroxysm as evidence\r\n  of a haemoclastic crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anopheline Mosquito\r\n\r\nThe ova of culicine mosquitoes are usually deposited in a scooped-out\r\nraft-like mass of about 250 eggs set vertically. The raft is easily\r\nseen with the eye, being about ⅕ inch long. The anopheline eggs are\r\noval in shape with pleated air cell projections laterally. They are\r\nlaid upon the surface of the water, to the number of about 100, in\r\nstar, triangle or ribbon patterns. The egg stage is two to four days\r\nbut shorter, however, in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  The larval stage is the most important one to be acquainted\r\n  with because in this stage one can most readily distinguish the\r\n  anopheline or possible malaria transmitter from a culicine species.\r\n  One can more readily and quickly make a survey for anophelines by\r\n  examining the collections of water for larvae than in any other\r\n  way. The anopheline larva seems to prefer the surface, on which\r\n  it lies flat and out of the water. To keep it from turning over\r\n  on its long axis, it has little rosette-like hair tufts on the\r\n  dorsal surface of the 5 or 6 middle abdominal segments (palmate\r\n  hairs). There are feathered lateral hairs projecting from thorax\r\n  and abdominal segments. The head is very small in comparison with\r\n  the thorax and can be rotated with lightning-like rapidity. There\r\n  is no projecting breathing tube or syphon from the next to the last\r\n  abdominal segment, as is characteristic of _Culex_, _Stegomyia_ or\r\n  any other culicine genus.\r\n\r\n  In addition, culicine larvae do not float parallel to the surface\r\n  of the water, but hang suspended at an angle, with only the tip\r\n  of the syphon pushed upward to the surface. The lateral hairs or\r\n  bristles are not feathered and the head is much larger than that of\r\n  the anopheline larvae. It is the fact of the surface position of\r\n  these anopheline larvae which enables them to worm their way over\r\n  film layers of water or between blades of grass, in grass or rush\r\n  studded pools or swamps.\r\n\r\n  In the pupal stage it is rather difficult to differentiate\r\n  species of mosquitoes from each other, so that, other than to\r\n  recognize that the bloated shrimp-like body is a mosquito pupa, is\r\n  unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—In the above figure note the culicine egg\r\nraft, 45° angle position of syphonate larva, parallel attitude of\r\nresting mosquito, nonbulbous palpi of male and short palpi of female\r\nas contrasted with the anopheline star or ribbon arrangement of eggs,\r\nhorizontal attitude of asiphonate larva, bradawl attitude of resting\r\nmosquito, spotted wings, bulbous palpi of male and long palpi of\r\nfemale mosquito. (From Jordan after Kolle and Hetsch.) MacNeal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIATION OF CULICINAE AND ANOPHELINAE\r\n\r\nIt is impossible even for an entomologist to determine the species\r\nof mosquitoes without recourse to elaborate keys and tables. It is\r\na comparatively easy matter, however, to decide as to whether the\r\nmosquito is a probable malaria transmitter or not.\r\n\r\n  _The male anopheline._—While certain characteristics of the male\r\n  are used to separate the Aedinae from other subfamilies, yet it is\r\n  only with the female that we concern ourselves in differentiating\r\n  the Culicinae from the Anophelinae. Therefore, it is first\r\n  necessary to distinguish the male from the female. If the antennae\r\n  have not been torn off, this can be decided by the highly adorned\r\n  plumose antennae of the male, those of the female being sparsely\r\n  decorated with short hairs. The palpi of the male _Anopheles_ tend\r\n  to be clubbed, while those of the _Culex_ are straight. If the\r\n  antennae have been broken off, look for the claspers at the end of\r\n  the abdomen.\r\n\r\nMale mosquitoes do not feed on blood but on fruits and flowers\r\ninstead. The puncturing parts of the male are not sufficiently\r\nresistant to penetrate the skin.\r\n\r\n  _The female anopheline._—Having determined that the insect is\r\n  a female, we then proceed to place it either in the subfamily\r\n  Culicinae or Anophelinae by a study of the relative length of the\r\n  palpi to the proboscis. If the palpi are much shorter than the\r\n  proboscis, it belongs to the Culicinae; if about as long or longer,\r\n  to the Anophelinae. The palpi of the female Megarhininae are also\r\n  long, but the proboscis is curved.\r\n\r\nHaving settled on the subfamily, we separate the genera by\r\nconsidering such points as character and distribution of scales on\r\nback of head, wings, thorax, and abdomen; banding of proboscis, legs,\r\nabdomen, and thorax, shape of scales on wings, and location of cross\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Resting posture of mosquitoes; 1 and 2,\r\n_Anopheles_; 3, _Culex pipienes_. (_After Sambon._) From P. H.\r\nReports.]\r\n\r\n  Anophelinae show abundant upright forked scales on occiput. The\r\n  mesothorax shows sparse hairs or scales with a smooth scutellum. As\r\n  a rule, the wings are spotted (dappled) and the location of these\r\n  spots gives the best clue to the different species of the genera.\r\n  With the exception of _Bironella_ the first submarginal cell is\r\n  large. This cell is longer than the second posterior one.\r\n\r\n  In the resting position _Culex_ allows the abdomen to droop, so\r\n  that it is parallel to the wall. The angle formed by the abdomen\r\n  with head and proboscis gives a hunchback appearance.\r\n\r\n  _Anopheles_ when resting on a wall goes out in a straight line at\r\n  an angle of about 45°. It resembles a bradawl.\r\n\r\n  The scutellum of _Anopheles_ is simple, that of _Culex_ trilobed.\r\n  _Anopheles_ has but one spermatheca; _Culex_ has three.\r\n\r\n                                 =Anophelinae=\r\n\r\n                          { 1.

Abdomen completely scaled. _Aldrichia._\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—Of the above genera only _Cycloleppteron_ and _Aldrichia_\r\n  are unproven malarial transmitters.\r\n\r\n  The female anopheline mosquito alone bites man, the male feeding\r\n  on fruits and flower juices. The female absolutely requires blood\r\n  for the development of her eggs after fertilization by the male\r\n  mosquito.\r\n\r\n  The anopheline mosquito bites at night or toward evening and\r\n  selects some dark place or dark colored wall to sleep against\r\n  during the day. Hence the advantage of a buff colored wall\r\n  interior. It is well to remember that the malarial incidence may be\r\n  kept down by killing the mosquitoes inside of a house by striking\r\n  them with a folded paper or piece of wire gauze on a handle (fly\r\n  swatter).\r\n\r\n  It is not a bad plan to have a dark colored surface in a room to\r\n  attract them and make their destruction easy.\r\n\r\n  Anophelines do not like wind and seek protection of underbrush.\r\n  As regards distance of flight from breeding places Metz has noted\r\n  that _A. crucians_ were not distributed generally over 7000 feet\r\n  and rarely were found between 7000 and 9000 feet beyond which\r\n  distance they were not found. Some anophelines get accustomed to\r\n  feeding exclusively on animals. Mosquitoes may hibernate through\r\n  the winter and possibly cause new infections the following spring.\r\n  Cases of malaria in the spring are however usually due to relapses.\r\n  Mitzmain’s negative experiments with hibernating mosquitoes _prove\r\n  man_ to be the _winter carrier_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Asiphonate (Anopheline) larva _Anopheles_. 2\r\nSiphonate (Culicine) larva _Stegomyia_]\r\n\r\nThe malarial zygote will not develop in the stomach of the mosquito\r\nif the temperature is below 16°C. (60°F.). It would seem that the\r\nzygote of _P. malariae_ will develop at a lower temperature than\r\nthat of the other two species, _P. falciparum_ requiring the highest\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur views as to temperature requirements for the development of\r\nzygotes in the mosquito must be changed as King has recently shown\r\nthat _P. vivax_ sporonts will survive exposure to temperatures of\r\n30°F. for two days and _P. falciparum_ temperatures of 35°F. for one\r\nday. This proves that temperatures approximating freezing ones will\r\nfail to destroy the parasites of hibernating mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n  Wenyon has found experimentally that mosquitoes which had fed on\r\n  malarial blood and kept at incubator temperatures for a week to\r\n  allow development of zygotes showed inhibition of development of\r\n  zygotes when kept at temperatures corresponding to hibernating\r\n  ones. This treatment did not kill the zygotes but complete\r\n  development took place when subsequently the mosquitoes were again\r\n  subjected to incubator temperatures. From this it would seem that\r\n  the zygotes remain viable during the winter hibernation. This is\r\n  at variance with Mitzmain’s views who regarded hibernation as\r\n  destructive to zygotes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Anatomy of the mosquito. No. 6 shows various\r\ntypes of scales.]\r\n\r\nThe mosquito does not seem to suffer from her malarial\r\ninfection—quite different from the serious affection that filariasis\r\ncauses in the mosquito.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—This matter has been considered rather extensively\r\nunder the historical and etiological discussions.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated however that the requirements for the spread of\r\nmalaria are: (1) Men who have sexual forms of the malarial parasite\r\nin their peripheral circulation; (2) efficient anopheline hosts, and\r\n(3) an atmospheric temperature above 60°F. (16°C.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—_Anopheles maculipennis (quadrimaculatus)_,\r\nfemale. (_Castellani and Chalmers, after Austen._) From P. H.\r\nReports.]\r\n\r\n  It is a well recognized fact in the tropics that the natives\r\n  seem to have an immunity to malaria yet may carry parasites in\r\n  their circulation and serve as carriers. The native children to\r\n  a striking degree harbour parasites and to them malaria is a\r\n  prime cause of death. After repeated infections, if not fatal, a\r\n  temporary immunity is acquired. Many localities in the tropics\r\n  owe freedom from malaria to an absence of anophelines, as for\r\n  instance Barbadoes. Again malaria-bearing mosquitoes may acquire\r\n  the habit of feeding on animal blood other than that of man. It is\r\n  well recognized that rural populations are more liable to malaria\r\n  than those of towns and as the population of a country moves to\r\n  the industrial centres human blood may become difficult to obtain\r\n  and the anophelines turn to other sources of blood supply. It has\r\n  been suggested that mosquitoes may suffer from other infections\r\n  which may be inimical to the development of malarial zygotes (black\r\n  spores of Ross). Anophelines bite chiefly at sunset and at night\r\n  from which fact there would seem to be some value in shutting the\r\n  windows towards nightfall as is the custom in many malarious parts\r\n  of the world.\r\n\r\n  Pools containing a border growth of grass or rushes are often\r\n  selected by anophelines for depositing eggs. The small fish\r\n  or tadpoles, which prey on the larvae, cannot work their way\r\n  through the obstacles and, again, petroleum oil cannot be easily\r\n  distributed in a network of grass. Anophelines of different species\r\n  and of different countries seem to vary in their selection of water\r\n  for depositing their eggs. We should not generalize but go out and\r\n  search for breeding places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—_Anopheles maculipennis (quadrimaculatus),\r\nmale._ (_After Castellani and Chalmers_.) From P. H. Reports.]\r\n\r\n  Anophelines seem to prefer small collections of water or sluggish\r\n  clear streams. The pools made by excavations following railway or\r\n  other similar construction are favorite breeding places. Proper\r\n  cultivation of rural districts makes the country more healthful and\r\n  Carter has stated that tile drainage is the key to rural malaria\r\n  control.\r\n\r\n  The most practical method for the identification of anopheline\r\n  species is to collect the larvae and later to study the adults\r\n  which develop from the pupae. On the whole culicines do not seem to\r\n  object to foul collections of water while anophelines avoid such\r\n  breeding places.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nThe pathological lesions are those connected with the destruction\r\nof enormous numbers of red cells, not only each infected red cell\r\nbeing destroyed but others not so parasitised. There has been an\r\nidea that at the time of sporulation and rupture of the merocyte a\r\npyrogenetic toxin was given off and along and with this there were\r\nhaemolysins and endotheliolysins. Following Brown we are justified in\r\nthinking that the malarial pigment (melanin or haemozoin) can act as\r\na haemolysin and by being taken up by endothelial cells bring about\r\ntheir degeneration with associated capillary haemorrhages. All three\r\nfactors—red-cell destruction by parasites, haemolytic action on red\r\ncells and capillary haemorrhages lead to anaemia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Digestive tract of _Anopheles_ the stomach\r\nof which is covered with numerous zygotes or oocysts of _Plasmodium\r\nfalciparum_. _c_, cloaca; _mt_, malpighian tubules; _o_, oocyst; _s_,\r\nstomach; _sb_, sucking bladders or pumping organ; _sg_, salivary\r\ngland. (MacNeal from Doflein, modified after Ross and Grassi.)]\r\n\r\n  The brain has a leaden hue caused by the black pigment. As\r\n  discussed under pernicious manifestations the blocking of the\r\n  capillaries may be explained in several ways. When examining\r\n  sections of a malarial brain one often encounters punctiform\r\n  haemorrhages.\r\n\r\n  The spleen is enlarged and the surface dark. In acute cases it may\r\n  be diffluent instead of hard, as in ague cake. Microscopic sections\r\n  show a striking absence of pigment in the Malpighian corpuscles,\r\n  the haemozoin being pushed off into the surrounding spleen pulp.\r\n  Bone marrow is dark from deposit of pigment. In the liver the\r\n  endothelial and Kupfer cells are packed with black pigment. The\r\n  parenchymatous cells do not contain this pigment but may show\r\n  grains of a yellow pigment, haemosiderin, which gives the iron\r\n  reaction. Haemozoin, although it contains iron, does not give this\r\n  reaction. Haemozoin is soluble in alkalis, but not in alcohol while\r\n  haemosiderin is soluble in alcohol but not in alkalis.\r\n\r\nThe splenic blood is more rich in haemozoin than that of the other\r\nvessels, this indicating the spleen as the place of destruction of\r\ninfected red cells or as the nursery for the development of malarial\r\nparasites. As a matter of fact splenectomy may cure an old malarial\r\ncachectic.\r\n\r\n  The finding of pigmented mononuclears or pigmented parasites in a\r\n  cross section of a blood vessel makes for a diagnosis of a malarial\r\n  infection.\r\n\r\n  Malarial manifestations are common in tropical autopsies and one\r\n  must be very chary about reporting malaria as the real rather than\r\n  contributing cause of death.\r\n\r\n  There is usually a marked increase in large mononuclears in malaria\r\n  and if this is noted along with a leucopenia it is very suggestive.\r\n  Melaniferous leucocytes occur in malaria only.\r\n\r\n  The kidneys may show degenerative changes and the presence of\r\n  urobilin in the urine is an important indication of latent malaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nCLINICALLY, WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF MALARIAL PAROXYSMS, (1) _Those\r\npresenting a cold stage, followed by a hot stage, with a terminal\r\nsweating stage_. Such attacks are brought about by the benign\r\ninfections which include the benign tertian and the quartan. Owing to\r\nthe fact that in such paroxysms the temperature makes a critical fall\r\nto normal or subnormal readings such fevers are frequently designated\r\n_intermittent fevers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Diagram of the temperature chart of a\r\ndouble tertian malarial fever showing the succeeding development of\r\ntwo generations of parasites, causing thereby a quotidian fever.\r\nThe solid line, _A_, shows the development of the generation of\r\nparasites first introduced and the dotted line, _B_, the cycle of the\r\ngeneration introduced later on.]\r\n\r\n  While these benign infections rarely or never exhibit pernicious\r\n  manifestations, they may, equally with the more dangerous\r\n  aestivo-autumnal parasite, lead to the production of malarial\r\n  cachexia, in which the clinical manifestations are similar whether\r\n  produced by a benign or malignant species.\r\n\r\n(2) _Those in which the succession of cold, hot and sweating stages\r\nis lacking._ There is not the frank well-defined chill of the former\r\ngroup, so that the term dumb chill is frequently applied. With\r\nthe possible exception of the first paroxysm the temperature tends\r\nto remain well above normal giving a continuous, or at any rate a\r\nremittent type of fever, instead of the intermittent temperature\r\ncurve of the benign infections. The designation _remittent fever_, is\r\noften applied to such fevers. Clinically there is a resemblance to\r\ntyphoid fever.\r\n\r\n  Such malarial fevers are caused by the small hair-like ring\r\n  parasite with its crescent sexual forms. There are many\r\n  designations for this type of malarial fever of which the\r\n  best recognized are: _malignant tertian_, _subtertian_,\r\n  _aestivo-autumnal_ and _tropical_. It is preëminently the malarial\r\n  fever of the tropics and, from its appearing in temperate climates\r\n  chiefly in the late summer and through the autumn months, received\r\n  from the Italians the designation aestivo-autumnal.\r\n\r\nSuch fevers were called subintrant by Torti because the succeeding\r\nparoxysm set in before the completion of the long-continued preceding\r\none. This type of fever was greatly dreaded. The designation\r\n_malignant tertian_ is to be preferred as indicating the greater\r\nseriousness of this type of malaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUBATION PERIOD\r\n\r\n  Depending in great part on the number of sporozoites introduced by\r\n  one or more infecting anophelines at the time of biting we have\r\n  with quartan fever (8-12 merozoites) a period of incubation of\r\n  approximately three weeks, for benign tertian (16-24 merozoites)\r\n  two weeks and for malignant tertian (32 merozoites in culture)\r\n  eight to twelve days. These periods however may be much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODROMATA\r\n\r\nThere may be prodromata of the nature of malaise, vague muscular\r\npains, headache and anorexia, possibly showing a periodicity in their\r\nappearance or intensity.\r\n\r\n  It is only when a sufficient number of parasites sporulate\r\n  simultaneously and pour out into the circulation sufficient toxic\r\n  material to cause a well-marked paroxysm that such occurs—with\r\n  less poison we may only have vague suggestions of an attack of ague.\r\n\r\nIn a large proportion of cases there are no prodromata, they begin\r\nwith a sudden onset.\r\n\r\nMalarial paroxysms show a preference for the forenoon or at any rate\r\ntend to occur in the early afternoon, rather than in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXED AND MULTIPLE INFECTIONS\r\n\r\n  When there are two generations of tertian parasites, each maturing\r\n  on successive days, we have a paroxysm every day—a quotidian\r\n  fever. Such a tertian infection is called a double tertian. In\r\n  quartan infections, with the seventy-two-hour cycle of development,\r\n  if we have two generations of parasites sporulating on succeeding\r\n  days, but with an apyretic day intervening, we have a double\r\n  quartan. If three generations of quartan parasites sporulate on\r\n  three successive days we have a triple quartan infection. When two\r\n  species of parasites are present in the same case we have a mixed\r\n  infection. Mixed infections of malignant tertian and benign tertian\r\n  are the most common, next, those of quartan and malignant tertian\r\n  and very rarely those showing quartan and benign tertian. All three\r\n  species have been found in a single individual.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINICAL TYPES\r\n\r\n_A Typical Benign Tertian or Quartan Paroxysm._—(Other than for\r\nthe difference in periodicity the paroxysms of these two malarial\r\ninfections are alike.)\r\n\r\nThe ague attack generally commences with malaise and slight headache,\r\nfrequently accompanied by yawning and stretching. Chilly sensations\r\nradiating from the spinal column to the extremities and the jaws give\r\nway to actual chill with shaking body and chattering teeth, face\r\npinched and bluish and cutis anserina.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is frequent, small and of rather high tension, there is\r\nincreased frequency of urination and nausea and vomiting may be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the fact that the rectal temperature is steadily\r\n  rising five or six degrees during this cold stage there is a desire\r\n  on the part of the patient to cover himself with all the wraps\r\n  obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe cold stage, which usually lasts from twenty to sixty minutes, is\r\nsucceeded by the hot stage.\r\n\r\n  At first there is a feeling of slight relief from the misery of the\r\n  chill but this is soon lost sight of in the increasing headache and\r\n  feeling of intense heat.\r\n\r\nThe previously welcome blankets are cast aside. The face now becomes\r\nflushed, the eyes shining, and the pulse more full. Epigastric\r\ndiscomfort, nausea and vomiting are apt to become more prominent in\r\nthis stage. The patient often complains of a throbbing headache. It\r\nis at this time that he may become slightly delirious. A sense of\r\ntension or even pain may be experienced in the region of the spleen,\r\nwhich organ will be found tender even if not already palpable. Herpes\r\nabout the nose and lips is almost as common as in lobar pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  An attending bronchitis is not uncommon.\r\n\r\n  The fever remains high, from 105° to 106°F., and continues so\r\n  elevated for from four to six hours to be succeeded by the sweating\r\n  stage. In this the dry skin becomes moist and perspiration breaks\r\n  out first on the forehead to be followed by a more or less marked\r\n  profuse sweating of the entire body. The pulse becomes slower, the\r\n  temperature falls rapidly and the patient falls asleep to awake\r\n  slightly exhausted but feeling well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Typical fever charts of the 3 types of\r\nmalaria.]\r\n\r\nThis feeling of well-being continues during the fever-free day which\r\nis often referred to by a patient as “my good day.”\r\n\r\n  The sweating stage lasts usually about four hours so that the\r\n  entire paroxysm of cold, hot and sweating stages occupies\r\n  approximately eight to twelve hours.\r\n\r\n  While most cases of the benign infections show the typical stages\r\n  yet we meet cases where the cold and sweating ones are absent or\r\n  but slightly marked.\r\n\r\n  Blood examination will show the parasites of the benign infections\r\n  to be in the peripheral circulation during the entire apyrexial\r\n  period. During the paroxysm we have a moderate leucocytosis\r\n  and during the afebrile period a leucopenia with an increased\r\n  percentage of large mononuclears.\r\n\r\n  Billet thinks that quartan paroxysms can be distinguished from\r\n  benign tertian ones by their showing a less abrupt fever rise and\r\n  a more rapid fall of temperature with a shorter duration of the\r\n  paroxysm, four or five hours as against eight to twelve hours for\r\n  benign tertian.\r\n\r\n_A Typical Malignant Tertian Paroxysm._—The characteristic features\r\nof the paroxysm are slight chilliness instead of a frank chill,\r\nprolonged and intensified hot stage, lack of marked terminal sweating\r\nand a tendency to exhibit a continuous or at least remittent fever\r\ncurve instead of the distinct intermittence, with an apyrexial\r\nperiod, of the benign infections.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the remittence the patient fails to experience a\r\nsense of well-being. He is sick and does not have a “well day.”\r\n\r\n  The temperature of a malignant tertian paroxysm may fall to\r\n  normal during the first attack but succeeding attacks only show\r\n  the tertian periodicity by an exacerbation of the more or less\r\n  continuous fever.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the temperature rise is gradual rather than abrupt and\r\nthe fall rather by lysis than crisis.\r\n\r\nThe paroxysm lasts from twenty to thirty-six hours instead of ten\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n  To explain the continuous type of fever it is often stated that\r\n  anticipation and retardation are characteristic of malignant\r\n  tertian infections. This simply means that the new paroxysm tends\r\n  to come on before the tertian periodicity of forty-eight hours\r\n  has expired and, having appeared, tends to delay its termination.\r\n  At any rate there is an extreme irregularity in the course of the\r\n  paroxysm. These attacks are often termed “dumb chills” and are\r\n  greatly dreaded.\r\n\r\nThe onset is insidious, occurring as a rule in the forenoon or early\r\nafternoon, with rarely a chill but only chilly sensations. The\r\nheadache and backache are severe, the face is flushed, the pulse\r\nquickened and the thirst urgent.\r\n\r\nThe patient feels more prostrated and ill than does one in a benign\r\nparoxysm and there is a distinct tendency to mental confusion or\r\ndelirium. Nausea and vomiting may be prominent features of an attack.\r\nAt times an apathetic state may suggest typhoid fever. In these\r\nmalignant malarial attacks the spleen is palpable and very tender.\r\nThere is also a sense of weight in the region of the liver.\r\n\r\n  In a blood examination one is not apt to find any other parasites\r\n  than the young hair-like ring forms which begin to appear a few\r\n  hours after the onset of the paroxysm. The rings may be observed\r\n  to broaden, but prior to that development in which pigment would\r\n  appear in the ring, the parasite-containing red cell is caught in\r\n  the capillaries of spleen or other organs. The finding of young\r\n  ring forms while fever continues is suggestive of a malignant\r\n  tertian infection.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of quinine administration the finding of parasites is\r\nto be expected in benign tertian and quartan infections, but with\r\nthe tropical parasite a smear may fail to show any organisms where\r\na few hours previously a blood examination would have shown a large\r\npercentage of infected red cells in every field of the microscope.\r\n\r\n=Pernicious Manifestations of Malaria.=—These grave manifestations\r\narise almost exclusively in the course of malignant tertian\r\ninfections. In his study of malaria Stott had about 1% of his cases\r\nshowing well-marked pernicious symptoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Temperature chart of malignant tertian fever\r\nshowing how readily one might confuse such a chart with that of\r\ntyphoid fever. (From Jackson’s Tropical Medicine.)]\r\n\r\n  As explanations of perniciousness are given: (1) the very large\r\n  number of red cells infected and destroyed by the malarial\r\n  parasites; (2) the throwing off at the time of sporulation of\r\n  the merocyte of a large amount of toxic material owing to the\r\n  presence of such a large number of disintegrating merocytes, and\r\n  (3) from the plugging of the capillaries of important internal\r\n  organs by adult parasites. This may arise as the result of (_a_)\r\n  the sporulating parasites acting as emboli, being too large to\r\n  pass the lumen of the capillary; (_b_) from degenerative changes\r\n  or distension with pigment of the endothelial cells lining the\r\n  capillaries, or (_c_) as the result of an ovoid shape on the part\r\n  of the malignant tertian parasite there is an inability to pass\r\n  through capillaries which the flattened benign parasites can do by\r\n  infolding (Bass), or (_d_) resulting from the tendency of malignant\r\n  tertian parasites to agglutinate.\r\n\r\n_Types of Pernicious Malaria._—It is customary to divide pernicious\r\nmalaria into the following divisions—(1) Cerebral, (2) Algid, (3)\r\nBilious Remittent and, possibly, also (4) Pneumonic and (5) Cardiac\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nBlackwater fever is often included in the grouping but would appear\r\nto be best considered as a separate disease although almost surely\r\nbrought about by malaria.\r\n\r\n  We do not understand why in one case sporulating parasites\r\n  should plug the capillaries of the central nervous system,\r\n  with the production of conditions resembling well-recognized\r\n  nervous diseases, while in another case the damage is done the\r\n  intestinal mucosa, pancreas or lungs. At any rate these pernicious\r\n  manifestations of malaria should always be kept in mind when a case\r\n  of sudden cerebral involvement or acute abdominal disease shows\r\n  itself in a patient in a malarious country and a blood examination\r\n  should be promptly made.\r\n\r\n_Cerebral Manifestations of Pernicious Malaria._—Various authorities\r\ngive different clinical pictures but the more commonly accepted types\r\nare:\r\n\r\n(1) The hyperpyrexial, when the symptoms are those of heat stroke,\r\nwith a temperature going up as high as 110°F. or even higher. Such\r\npatients rapidly become comatose and as a rule die.\r\n\r\n(2) The delirious and comatose forms are apt to be associated, the\r\ncomatose condition following a delirious state. Such manifestations\r\nmay or may not set in with a chill. Cases belonging to this group\r\nmay arise from a typical malignant tertian infection in which the\r\nheadache and restlessness have been unusually marked. The pulse is\r\nfull and fast with sighing respiration, hot dry skin and flushed\r\nface. There may be rigidity of the neck muscles.\r\n\r\n(3) Such terms as epileptiform, tetanic, aphasic, cerebellar\r\nand bulbar have been applied to malarial manifestations and are\r\nself-explanatory.\r\n\r\n  Cerebral malaria may give rise to a delusional insanity. Various\r\n  psychoses or amnesia at times follow cerebral types of pernicious\r\n  malaria.\r\n\r\n_Algid Manifestation of Pernicious Malaria._—In such cases we have\r\na small thread-like pulse and a cold clammy skin. There are signs of\r\ncollapse. The respiration is slow and shallow and the voice weak.\r\nIt is customary to consider some of these cases, when there is\r\nvomiting and diarrhoea, with painful cramps of the legs and scanty\r\nor suppressed urine, as of choleraic type, while other cases, with\r\nblood and mucus in the stools and marked abdominal pain are termed\r\ndysenteric. Most dysenteric types only show a diarrhoea with the\r\npresence of blood.\r\n\r\n  The dysenteric type is more common but the question always arises\r\n  whether the case may not have been really dysentery lighting up\r\n  a latent malaria or the lowering of resistance from the malaria\r\n  favoring a dysenteric infection. Stott had five algid cases of\r\n  dysenteric type but not one of choleraic. The choleraic types have\r\n  often been reported during outbreaks of cholera.\r\n\r\n  When epistaxis and haemorrhages from the intestines or stomach are\r\n  marked features of an attack the cases are termed haemorrhagic and,\r\n  if a prostrating, collapse-producing sweat be a characteristic\r\n  feature, they are called diaphoretic.\r\n\r\nCases have been observed when the excessive sporulation was\r\napparently taking place in the pancreas, giving the symptomatology of\r\nacute haemorrhagic pancreatitis.\r\n\r\n_Bilious Remittent Fever._—This is the most common and the least\r\ndangerous of the pernicious manifestations but tends rapidly to\r\nproduce malarial cachexia. Slight jaundice and bilious vomiting\r\nmay appear in the course of an ordinary malignant tertian paroxysm\r\nand only severe types, with fatal tendency, should be classed as\r\npernicious. It sets in with marked nausea followed by bilious\r\nvomiting and bile-rich stools. Jaundice shows itself by the second\r\nday; earlier than in yellow fever, but much later than the rapidly\r\nappearing jaundice of blackwater fever. The urine shows bile pigment\r\nand a yellow foam. Epigastric distress and liver tenderness are\r\nmarked features and there may even be gastric haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n  _Pneumonic and Cardiac Types._—Other recognized types are when,\r\n  with the symptoms of a broncho-pneumonia, we find an element of\r\n  periodicity and a response to quinine—the so-called pneumonic\r\n  type.\r\n\r\n  Again, usually in elevated regions, dilatation of the right\r\n  heart and death have been noted as occurring in cardiac types of\r\n  pernicious malaria.\r\n\r\n  Another type is one in which the sweating stage is excessive, the\r\n  so-called diaphoretic type. These cases may result in collapse and\r\n  such a termination may be syncopal in character.\r\n\r\n=Relapses.=—Relapses are distinct features of malarial diseases,\r\nthe tendency being most marked in quartan and least so in malignant\r\ntertian. A relapse after an interval of two years is very rare in\r\nmalignant tertian but periods as long as nine years may intervene\r\nbetween attacks of quartan fever.\r\n\r\n  Relapses are intimately associated with conditions which tend to\r\n  lower the body resistance, so that exposure to cold or wet or\r\n  hot sun may bring on an attack. Alcoholic or venereal excesses,\r\n  as well as errors of diet, may be provocative. Persons returning\r\n  home from the tropics often experience relapses as they approach\r\n  the cooler climate of the temperate zone. It has been well stated\r\n  that the old resident of the tropics owes his condition of health\r\n  rather to education than acclimatization—experience has taught him\r\n  discretion.\r\n\r\nThere are three explanations of relapses of which the one supported\r\nby Ross and Bignami seems more reasonable and is that the\r\ndisappearance of nonsexual parasites is only apparent and that they\r\ncontinue their cycle but in insufficient numbers to excite symptoms.\r\n\r\n  _Parthenogenesis._—Schaudinn thought that, either spontaneously\r\n  or as the result of treatment, there was a disappearance of the\r\n  nonsexual forms and the male gametes, the female gametes however\r\n  surviving and, eventually, through the process of parthenogenesis,\r\n  producing a set of spores or merozoites which set up a nonsexual\r\n  cycle. It would seem probable that Schaudinn saw red cells\r\n  containing a merozoite along with a female gamete and interpreted\r\n  his findings as a sporulating sexual form.\r\n\r\n  Craig thinks that as the result of the conjugation of two young\r\n  schizonts a more resisting parasite is evolved, which under\r\n  favorable circumstances for its development may start anew a\r\n  nonsexual cycle.\r\n\r\n=Latent Malaria.=—The persistence of a malarial infection, in\r\nthe absence of clinical and to a great extent of laboratory\r\nmanifestations, is shown by the occurrence of relapses, so that\r\nthe section treating of malarial relapses applies equally to this\r\nparagraph. In addition to the factors influencing relapses, such\r\nas exposure to sun, rain and excesses of various kinds, we note\r\na particular tendency for a latent malaria to develop activity\r\nfollowing surgical operations and childbirth. In untreated latent\r\ncases we may have delayed healing of surgical operations.\r\n\r\n  In another paragraph there is noted the importance of examining\r\n  placental smears for evidence of a latent malarial infection.\r\n  Persons returning to a cool climate from the tropics, who may not\r\n  have shown evidence of active malaria for months, may come down\r\n  with a paroxysm upon encountering cool weather (refrigeration).\r\n  Latency may be complete or there may be vague manifestations of ill\r\n  health such as anorexia, malaise, irritability, headaches, anaemia\r\n  and alimentary tract disturbances. Not infrequently tropical\r\n  residents without symptoms may show crescents in their blood and\r\n  such cases are of prime importance in connection with infection\r\n  of mosquitoes. To a certain extent they are the typical carriers\r\n  and should be actively treated from a standpoint of malarial\r\n  prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n=Masked Malaria.=—While as a rule one should not accept such a\r\ndiagnosis, unless the possibility of some other explanation than\r\nmalaria is excluded, yet there are manifestations, chiefly neuralgic,\r\ngastro-intestinal or in the form of varied skin eruptions which at\r\ntimes show periodicity and which respond to treatment with quinine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Abnormal malaria parasites. 1, Normal red\r\ncorpuscle; 2, gametocyte and schizont; 3, gametocyte and gametocyte;\r\n4, gametocyte and schizont; 5, schizont and schizont, both undergoing\r\nschizogony. (_After Dr. J. D. Thompson, “Jl. R. A. M. C.”_) By\r\npermission from Manson’s Tropical Diseases.]\r\n\r\n=Malarial Cachexia.=—As the result of repeated attacks of any type\r\nof malaria a condition of anaemia and physical and mental incapacity\r\nmay be produced. The skin has a dirty earthy hue, particularly of\r\nthe face, and the sclerae show a yellowish tinging. The patient\r\nis sensitive to the slightest cold and is the victim of mental\r\ndepression with deterioration of memory or at any rate lack of\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\n  There may be long periods in which the temperature is normal or\r\n  subnormal but slight febrile accessions may occur from time to time\r\n  and at such times the blood may show parasites.\r\n\r\nThe spleen is enlarged as may also be the liver. Twisting of the\r\npedicle of the spleen or its rupture from even slight blows may\r\nnecessitate surgical intervention.\r\n\r\n  There is anorexia and alimentary tract disturbances. A very\r\n  important feature of malarial cachexia may be the occurrence of\r\n  haemorrhages, particularly serious being those from the retinal\r\n  vessels.\r\n\r\n  It is probable that hookworm infection has frequently been\r\n  confused with the anaemia of malarial cachexia as in both of these\r\n  conditions we may have a high-grade anaemia with swelling about\r\n  the ankles, palpitation of the heart and shortness of breath. Some\r\n  authorities have recently called attention to splenic enlargement\r\n  in hookworm disease, but this is not generally accepted. There may\r\n  be also ascites in malaria. Urobilinuria is an important sign in\r\n  malaria where other causes for red cell destruction are excluded.\r\n\r\n=The Sequelae of Malaria.=—The anaemia and other manifestations of\r\nmalarial cachexia have been described above. The enlarged spleen not\r\nonly is a source of danger from rupture but it may cause sensations\r\nof pain or tension. The skin of those with chronic malaria tends to\r\nulcerate from slight wounds and phagedenic lesions may occur. There\r\nmay be various disorders of the nervous system varying from mental\r\nconfusion or lack of mental concentration to melancholia. Neuritis\r\nand possibly peripheral neuritis may have origin in repeated attacks\r\nof malignant tertian malaria. Ulceration of the cornea is the most\r\nfrequent of the ocular sequelae although even this is rare. It only\r\noccurs after many relapses. It is painful, heals slowly and tends to\r\nrecur with relapses. Iritis may accompany it. Abortions are frequent\r\nunless the malaria is adequately treated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _General Appearance._—In the cold stage of the benign infections\r\n  the face is pinched and blue to become decidedly flushed when the\r\n  hot stage sets in. In malarial cachexia there is an earthy color\r\n  with the pigmentation more marked about the face and knuckles. In\r\n  the algid forms of pernicious malaria the skin is pale, cold and\r\n  clammy, in a measure simulating cholera. Herpes labialis is very\r\n  common in the benign infections, but less so in the malignant\r\n  tertian ones. Jaundice is a feature of bilious remittent fever.\r\n\r\n  _The Temperature._—Even in the cold stage the temperature is\r\n  steadily rising and may have reached 105°F. or higher by the time\r\n  of onset of the hot stage. It remains elevated during the four to\r\n  six hours of the hot stage and then falls rapidly to normal during\r\n  the sweating stage. The paroxysm tends to occur in the forenoon or\r\n  early afternoon. In 793 typical paroxysms Stott found only 37% to\r\n  occur before noon. Intermittent fever curves are characteristic\r\n  of benign infections. In malignant tertian a prolonged hot stage\r\n  (fifteen to thirty-six hours) is a marked feature. The onset also\r\n  is more gradual and the fever tends only to remit or may remain\r\n  continuous over several days, but even with such a chart there are\r\n  apt to be indications of slight rises every other day.\r\n\r\n  In the hyperpyrexial form of cerebral perniciousness the\r\n  temperature may rise to 112°F. and the case resemble sun stroke. In\r\n  the algid forms the axillary and rectal temperatures are usually\r\n  elevated.\r\n\r\n  _The Circulatory System._—The pulse is small, rapid and of high\r\n  tension in the cold stage to become full and bounding in the hot\r\n  stage. A cardiac type of perniciousness in which the right heart\r\n  dilates has been referred to.\r\n\r\n  _The Alimentary Tract._—Nausea and vomiting are common\r\n  manifestations of malarial paroxysms and in bilious remittent fever\r\n  the bilious vomiting is an especially distressing feature.\r\n\r\n  So-called choleriform and dysenteric manifestations of\r\n  perniciousness of the algid type are rarely observed.\r\n\r\n  Cases with the clinical picture of acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis\r\n  have been reported as incident to excessive sporulation of malarial\r\n  parasites in the capillaries of the pancreas.\r\n\r\n  _The Respiratory System._—There may be a slight bronchitis\r\n  in ordinary types of malarial fever. In the cerebral types of\r\n  perniciousness the breathing may be markedly altered—even of\r\n  Cheyne-Stokes character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Malarial cachexia. (Deaderick.)]\r\n\r\n  A broncho-pneumonia which shows a periodicity and responds to\r\n  quinine is often considered as a pernicious type of malaria.\r\n\r\n  _The Skin._—Herpes labialis is a common manifestation of benign\r\n  tertian and not rarely of malignant tertian infection. Urticaria\r\n  may also be noted. The skin of malarial cachexia is earthy. Of\r\n  course, one must always keep in mind the skin eruptions due to\r\n  quinine administered in treatment, and of these urticaria is\r\n  probably the most frequent.\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—In both the benign and malignant infections\r\n  headache is a marked feature and is accentuated during the hot\r\n  stage. There may be a “flighty” condition in the hot stage of\r\n  benign tertian and quartan but in aestivo-autumnal infections there\r\n  may be actual delirium.\r\n\r\n  Delirious and comatose states are prominent features of cerebral\r\n  pernicious attacks. At times there may be an apathetic condition\r\n  suggesting typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n  Almost any type of central nervous system disease may be simulated\r\n  as the result of focal sporulation so that we have aphasic,\r\n  epileptiform, hemiplegic, bulbar and other clinical types.\r\n\r\n  Some authors have recorded cases of multiple neuritis of malarial\r\n  origin. Catto has recently examined the blood of a number of cases\r\n  of multiple neuritis in Jamaica and has obtained negative malarial\r\n  findings in every case. Neuralgic manifestations are features of\r\n  latent malaria. Some loss of memory may be apparent after severe\r\n  malaria.\r\n\r\n  _The Special Senses._—Plugging of the retinal arteries may lead to\r\n  blindness which may be either transient or lasting. The discs are\r\n  grayish red instead of white as is the case with quinine amblyopia.\r\n  The ringing in the ears is connected with the quinine treatment.\r\n\r\n  _The Genito-urinary System._—In the cold stage there is apt to be\r\n  frequent urination with increased secretion. Later on, there is a\r\n  scanty febrile urine.\r\n\r\n  Albuminuria is rather common in aestivo-autumnal attacks and true\r\n  nephritis occurs in about 2% of cases.\r\n\r\n  Plehn attaches great importance to the examination of the urine for\r\n  urobilin as showing malarial infection when parasites cannot be\r\n  found. The pigment particles in urinary sediment (Uriola) do not\r\n  give reliable information. Bile in the urine is an important sign\r\n  of bilious remittent fever.\r\n\r\n  Orchitis has been reported as a malarial complication.\r\n\r\n  _The Liver and Spleen._—There is very little of importance to note\r\n  in connection with the liver except tenderness and jaundice in\r\n  bilious remittent fever. The spleen, however, is the organ in which\r\n  centers the infection and its tenderness and enlargement are of\r\n  special diagnostic value in malaria.\r\n\r\n  Even in comatose conditions pressure on the spleen may bring about\r\n  indications of pain. The liability to rupture of the friable spleen\r\n  of aestivo-autumnal infections is a real danger and the patient\r\n  should not expose himself to injury.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood Examination._—This is of prime value in the recognition\r\n  of malaria, and one should examine both fresh blood preparations\r\n  and stained films as well. More information is gotten from the\r\n  stained films but we should also avail ourselves of the different\r\n  characteristics of the 3 malarial species, which can be noted in a\r\n  preparation made by taking up a small drop of exuding blood on a\r\n  cover-glass and allowing it to drop on a slide and run out without\r\n  any pressure on the cover-glass.\r\n\r\n  The crescents, when found, show a malignant tertian infection but\r\n  there may also be present one of the benign parasites. A stained\r\n  film should be used to identify malignant tertian young ring forms.\r\n\r\n  Pigmented rings are rarely observed in aestivo-autumnal fever,\r\n  such parasites being caught in the capillaries as they enlarge to\r\n  the stage where pigment begins to be present. Flagellated forms\r\n  only develop in fresh blood preparations, 15 to 20 minutes after\r\n  the taking of the blood. Of the greatest differential value is the\r\n  swollen pale infected red cell of benign tertian, the normal red\r\n  cell of quartan and the distorted shrunken red cell of malignant\r\n  tertian.\r\n\r\n  Quinine administration may cause parasites to disappear from the\r\n  peripheral circulation or it may so affect the parasite that the\r\n  staining would indicate a degenerated parasite—the so-called\r\n  quinine-affected parasite. It is difficult to diagnose the species\r\n  of malaria from such a parasite.\r\n\r\n  Large mononuclears and transitionals containing phagocytized\r\n  pigment (melaniferous leucocytes) are characteristic of\r\n  malaria—the pigment however must be in the leucocyte and not\r\n  free. There is a leucocytosis during the malarial paroxysm with\r\n  a leucopenia and increase in the large mononuclears during the\r\n  apyrexial period.\r\n\r\n  Among natives of India the large mononuclears and transitionals\r\n  averaged 21% in the apyrexial stage of malaria while healthy\r\n  natives rarely showed as much as a 10% count (Stott).\r\n\r\n  Some authorities have reported positive Wassermann reactions in\r\n  serum of malarial patients taken during a paroxysm. All agree,\r\n  however, that the serum of malarial patients at other times is\r\n  negative.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIn the diagnosis of malaria the special points to consider are:\r\n(1) presence of malarial parasites, (2) periodicity, (3) splenic\r\nenlargement, (4) response to quinine therapy, (5) the presence of\r\nmelaniferous leucocytes and (6) a high large mononuclear percentage\r\nwhen leucopenia is present. In the examination for parasites one\r\nshould not only consider the species of parasite present but, as\r\nwell, the stage of development and the presence of the sexual forms.\r\n\r\n  In an intensive investigation Bass has shown that 55.09% of those\r\n  showing parasites in the blood give a clinical history of malaria\r\n  while 44.91% of those with parasites in the blood fail to be\r\n  associated with clinical manifestations.\r\n\r\n  Blood platelets are the findings most frequently mistaken for\r\n  malarial parasites in stained blood, and the vacuoles in fresh\r\n  blood. Quartan and tertian periodicity is only found in malaria,\r\n  but quotidian periodicity is a feature of a host of diseases.\r\n\r\nThere are very few tropical diseases which have not been mistaken\r\nfor malaria and many of these have been considered as of malarial\r\netiology before the discovery of the real cause.\r\n\r\n  Of the cosmopolitan diseases, typhoid fever, septic conditions,\r\n  including malignant endocarditis, tuberculosis, influenza, pyelitis\r\n  and even syphilis are to be considered in a diagnosis of malaria.\r\n\r\nAs regards tropical diseases, kala-azar, Malta fever, liver abscess,\r\nfilariasis, trypanosomiasis, leprosy, relapsing fever and yellow\r\nfever are to be thought of in differential diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  As was noted under the discussion of the pernicious manifestations\r\n  of malaria, scores of diseases may be simulated by the sporulation\r\n  of the malarial parasite in certain organs or areas of organs. One\r\n  should always keep in mind the possibility of pain in the appendix\r\n  region or in the gall bladder area as connected with malaria if in\r\n  the tropics. A polynuclear increase negatives malaria and indicates\r\n  appendicitis or cholecystitis. Malarial pancreatitis has been\r\n  referred to before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—A cluster of blood-plaques and two plaques\r\nlying upon a red cell and simulating malarial parasites (× 1000).\r\n(Todd.)]\r\n\r\nWith malarial cachexia we must in particular keep from mistaking it\r\nfor hookworm disease or other secondary anaemias due to intestinal\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\n  _Provocative Measures._—Kohlbrugge’s recommendation to have\r\n  patients suspected of malaria climb mountains and drink copiously\r\n  of cold water, in order to bring on a relapse, is of value in the\r\n  diagnosis. (Effects of fatigue and refrigeration.) It must always\r\n  be borne in mind that quinine causes the parasites to disappear\r\n  from the peripheral circulation. It is interesting to note that\r\n  small doses of quinine given over ten days or two weeks may make\r\n  a latent case active. Other provocative agents are subcutaneous\r\n  injections of adrenalin (the best), or anti-typhoid inoculations.\r\n  Certain physical methods, as hot and cold douches or alternating\r\n  the hot air chamber at 55°C. for 10 minutes, followed by a cold\r\n  bath for 3 minutes have been recommended. After injection of\r\n  adrenalin the presence of parasites in the blood is at its height\r\n  at the end of an hour. Sunlight is a factor in relapse.\r\n\r\n_The laboratory diagnosis_ of malaria has already been fully gone\r\ninto in the section on etiology and that on blood examination under\r\nthe heading of symptoms in detail.\r\n\r\n  The evenly spread stained film undoubtedly gives more accurate\r\n  information as to species and stage of cycle than any other\r\n  method. Still one should always examine a fresh specimen and if\r\n  the parasites are very scarce, a thick film preparation. The thick\r\n  film methods of Ross, Ruge and James are given under the chapter on\r\n  the blood in tropical diseases. During winter parasites tend to\r\n  disappear from the circulation regardless of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe prognosis in benign tertian and quartan is most favorable when\r\nproper treatment is instituted, as such infections are never fatal in\r\nfirst attacks. Not only may malignant tertian kill in a first attack\r\nbut it leads rapidly to a cachexia while the cachexia following upon\r\nbenign infections is more gradual.\r\n\r\n  It is the tendency to perniciousness which makes us dread malignant\r\n  tertian as we can never be sure that a paroxysm may not develop\r\n  cerebral or algid manifestations and these show a very high death\r\n  rate, 25 to 50%, even when promptly treated.\r\n\r\n  As regards relapses quartan is the malarial fever which is most\r\n  apt to show this feature and aestivo-autumnal the least. Deaderick\r\n  gives the percentage of cases showing relapses in quartan, benign\r\n  tertian and aestivo-autumnal as 65, 55 and 45.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of malaria is rather its invaliding tendency and\r\nby thus reducing the powers of resistance it makes the death rate\r\nfrom intercurrent diseases higher. Tropical malaria does not seem to\r\naffect the native as it does the European but the high death rate of\r\ninfants among the natives is undoubtedly largely connected with this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n  Statistics vary greatly as to the percentage of fatal cases in\r\n  malaria. Certain figures from tropical countries give fatal results\r\n  as occurring in from 2 to 10% of cases, while statistics from\r\n  temperate climates show a death rate below 1%. The mortality from\r\n  pernicious types of malaria is about 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—There are three methods in the prevention of\r\nmalaria, all of which may be combined, as was the case in the Canal\r\nZone region of Panama. These are: (1) Destruction of anopheline\r\nmosquitoes; (2) protection of the individual from the bites of\r\nmosquitoes, and (3) quinine prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n  It may be stated that it is frequently advisable to carry on the\r\n  mosquito warfare without regard to the question of the kind of\r\n  mosquitoes destroyed. In general terms the malarial mosquito breeds\r\n  in the suburbs of towns or in districts more distinctly rural,\r\n  while the transmitter of the more dreaded yellow fever, prefers\r\n  breeding places in the immediate vicinity of city houses.\r\n\r\n  Bentley has recently noted that, with improvement in agricultural\r\n  methods and utilization of marshy lands, malaria tends to disappear\r\n  as much from the physical improvement and thereby greater\r\n  resistance of the people as from the destruction of mosquitoes by\r\n  the draining of the swamps. The resulting greater prosperity makes\r\n  better food and shelter obtainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Destruction of Mosquitoes._\r\n\r\nSuch measures may be directed either toward the larva or fully\r\ndeveloped insect.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Measures against larvae. When practicable permanent measures\r\nshould be preferred to temporary ones and when agricultural\r\ndevelopment goes along with drainage of swamps the cost is repaid.\r\n\r\n  The doing away with mosquito breeding places may be accomplished\r\n  by filling in pools or by making ditches with smooth sloping sides\r\n  to carry away the water. These ditches require a great deal of\r\n  attention to prevent their filling up with tropical vegetation and\r\n  thereby adding to breeding places. Subsoil drainage with tiled\r\n  drains is better. Care should be exercised that public works\r\n  operations do not raise the level of the subsoil water.\r\n\r\n  Anophelines tend to breed in sluggishly moving streams or in\r\n  stagnant pools especially where there is a luxuriant growth of\r\n  weeds or grass, and are not apt to be found in rapidly flowing\r\n  streams, hence the necessity for constant care of ditches and the\r\n  like to prevent their becoming obstructed by vegetation or silt.\r\n  When filling in or drainage is not practicable the method of oiling\r\n  the surface of the pool with crude petroleum is to be recommended.\r\n  One uses about ½ pint for every 100 square feet of surface and the\r\n  process should be repeated every two weeks.\r\n\r\n  In places where oil is not effective, Barber recommends Paris\r\n  green mixed with dust and so used as to form a scant surface\r\n  deposit. Anopheline larvae, being surface feeders, ingest it and\r\n  are killed. It does not affect Culex larvae. On account of its ease\r\n  of transportation, and adaptability to weedy places where oil does\r\n  not penetrate, Paris green dust will doubtless prove a valuable\r\n  selective larvicide. Mayne and Jackson recommend cresol as the best\r\n  larvicide. In 1 to 1,000,000 parts it is an effective larvicide,\r\n  and even in 1 to 1,000,000,000 it is destructive to young larvae.\r\n\r\n  Mixtures of soft soap and petroleum are better than petroleum alone.\r\n\r\n  Winds are apt to blow away the surface coating of oil and it is\r\n  difficult to oil the surface of a pool filled with grass. Wise\r\n  recommends crude carbolic acid, using 1 ounce to 16 cubic feet of\r\n  water.\r\n\r\n  In using any larvicide it is well to introduce it along the banks\r\n  of water collections with a long-spout can and mix it thoroughly\r\n  with a stiff reed broom.\r\n\r\n  There are many enemies of mosquito larvae, such as tadpoles,\r\n  water-beetle larvae and various small fish such as “millions.”\r\n\r\n  Terni suggests the using of such fish as carp and tench which have\r\n  a food value as well as a larvicidal one.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Measures against the mosquito. The clearing away of grass and\r\nbrush from around houses exposes the mosquitoes to the sun in which\r\nthey cannot live long.\r\n\r\nWhen inside the house they may be destroyed by sulphur fumigation, 1\r\nor 2 pounds of sulphur for each 1000 cubic feet and with an exposure\r\nof two hours.\r\n\r\n  It is usually stated that mosquitoes may hibernate during winter\r\n  following infection in the autumn and that cases of malaria in\r\n  early Spring may be explained by their bites. Examination of\r\n  hibernating mosquitoes for zygotes does not give strong proof to\r\n  this view but such mosquitoes, becoming active with a rise in\r\n  temperature, may bite gamete carriers in the house and thus spread\r\n  malaria.\r\n\r\n  Pyrethrum powder, which is set on fire with a little alcohol, may\r\n  be burned, using 2 pounds per 1000 cubic feet, and an exposure\r\n  of four hours. This does not certainly kill the insect and the\r\n  stupified mosquitoes should be swept up and burned.\r\n\r\n  Giemsa’s spray is now considered an excellent measure for killing\r\n  mosquitoes in rooms. The composition is as follows: Pyrethrum\r\n  tincture (20 parts powdered pyrethrum blossoms to 100 parts\r\n  alcohol), 480 grams; odorless potash soap, 180 grams; glycerine,\r\n  240 grams. Before using it dilute with 20 times its own weight of\r\n  water, and spray the walls of the room with a spray pump.\r\n\r\n  The use of a small square of wire gauze on a handle (fly swatter)\r\n  to kill mosquitoes as they rest on a wall is of great value in\r\n  keeping them down in a screened house.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Protection of the Individual._\r\n\r\nThe house should be thoroughly screened with copper-wire screens\r\nwhich should have 18 meshes to the inch. Mosquitoes can pass through\r\na 15 mesh screen. Screen doors should always open outward and close\r\nautomatically with spring hinges.\r\n\r\n  It is almost impossible to screen a ship’s hatches effectually.\r\n  Then too the screening of fan intakes and ports interferes with\r\n  free circulation of air, thus adding to the discomfort of the heat\r\n  of the tropics.\r\n\r\n  As malarial mosquitoes bite chiefly toward evening one should not\r\n  expose himself after sunset.\r\n\r\n  Houses should be far removed from native habitations.\r\n\r\n  Mosquitoes prefer the lower floors of a house so that the upper\r\n  stories are preferable for sleeping.\r\n\r\n  Mosquito nets at night, with protection by veils for the face or\r\n  coverings for the hands and ankles, when going out of the house,\r\n  are well-known measures.\r\n\r\n  It is stated that Emin Pascha always carried a mosquito net and\r\n  never suffered from malaria. He thought that the cause of malaria\r\n  was too large to go through the net.\r\n\r\n  Even when mosquito nets are intact and well tucked in there is the\r\n  weak point that a person sleeping on a narrow cot is apt to put his\r\n  arm or leg against the net, in which case the mosquitoes readily\r\n  bite the skin presenting at the open spaces.\r\n\r\n  Oil of citronella is often used to keep away mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n  Brooks recommends Neal’s method. In this daub a solution of 1 ounce\r\n  Epsom salts in 10 ounces of water on the exposed parts and allow to\r\n  dry.\r\n\r\nApplication of certain pine products used as mange cures will keep\r\naway mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Quinine Prophylaxis._\r\n\r\nThe ease of application of quinine prophylaxis, as compared with the\r\nmore permanent methods of mosquito destruction and screening, appeals\r\nto the sanitarian, especially in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  It is just as easy to give quinine to a man in the tropics as it is\r\n  in temperate climates, but when one considers the propositions of\r\n  draining tropical swamps and shutting off circulation of air on a\r\n  torrid night with fine wire gauze in the windows and closely woven\r\n  mosquito nets around the bed, the question is decidedly different.\r\n  In consequence, the tendency is for the average man to despair\r\n  of accomplishing anything in the way of mosquito destruction and\r\n  screening and to seize eagerly on the inferior alternative, that of\r\n  quinine prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n  Ronald Ross presents this matter concisely and to the point when\r\n  he states that it is not a good policy to substitute a measure\r\n  which does not exclude infection, but is merely extirpative in\r\n  some cases, for positive prevention. From this it will be seen\r\n  that unless it is clearly recognized that quinine prophylaxis may\r\n  in some cases extirpate, but does not prevent, there might be a\r\n  tendency to adopt this measure and neglect the two proper ones.\r\n\r\n  As regards the relative merits of quinine prophylaxis and\r\n  protection from mosquitoes Celli gives the following figures:\r\n\r\n     Treatment                                 Infected\r\n  Mosquito protection plus quinine prophylaxis     1.76 %\r\n  Mosquito protection alone                        2.5  %\r\n  Quinine prophylaxis alone                       20.0  %\r\n  No protection at all                            33.0  %\r\n\r\nWith quinine prophylaxis, there is the possibility of producing\r\nan immunity to quinine on the part of the parasites which have\r\nbeen introduced by infected mosquitoes and held in check by the\r\nprophylactic but not curative dose of quinine. Later on when the\r\nquinine prophylaxis is discontinued the parasites begin to multiply\r\nvigorously and seem to possess an immunity to quinine.\r\n\r\n  As an instance of this, 398 marines served in 1906 for about one\r\n  month on the Isthmus of Panama during which time they were given 9\r\n  grains of quinine daily as a prophylactic.\r\n\r\n  During this month there was only an occasional case of malaria\r\n  among the men. At the end of the month 298 of the original 398\r\n  returned aboard ship and sailed for the North. Two days later\r\n  20 cases of malaria developed, followed the next day by 53 and\r\n  the day following that by 45. The medical officer then resumed\r\n  10-grain prophylactic doses for those not down with malaria but\r\n  notwithstanding this there were 215 acute malarial paroxysms, some\r\n  of them of pernicious type, among the 298 men.\r\n\r\n  It was noted that these men did not respond satisfactorily\r\n  to quinine treatment even when the drug was administered\r\n  intramuscularly.\r\n\r\nOf the greatest value have been the observations of Stott. Using\r\nnative Indian troops he gave one group (3931) prophylactic quinine\r\nwhile the other (3906) did not take quinine prophylactically. He\r\ncontinued this experiment one year giving 15 grains 3 times weekly\r\nfor five months, and 10 grains 3 times weekly for the remaining seven\r\nmonths. Those taking quinine gave 170 primary admissions while those\r\nnot taking it gave 179 (43.2 per thousand strength for the former as\r\nagainst 45.8 per thousand for those not taking quinine prophylaxis).\r\nFurther observations were that those taking quinine prophylaxis\r\nshowed a greater tendency to relapse, had somewhat longer fever, and\r\nrequired more quinine for treatment.\r\n\r\n  Linnell states that he used quinine prophylaxis among 2000 coolies\r\n  for a year, giving 5 grains or more daily with most discouraging\r\n  results. It seemed to act as a slow poison and did not protect.\r\n\r\n_Quinine Immunity._—Bignami thinks that malarial relapses\r\nmay be connected with insufficient initial treatment so that\r\nquinine-resisting forms survive and later, when some factor lowers\r\nthe patient’s resistance, active multiplication of parasites, which\r\nare not readily destroyed by quinine, follows.\r\n\r\n  While quinine prophylaxis may not be desirable on board ship, where\r\n  one is in a position to readily recognize and treat the onset\r\n  of malaria and to more or less efficiently carry out mosquito\r\n  protection methods, or in a wealthy seaport, where sufficient\r\n  interest in and funds for draining and screening exist, yet on\r\n  military expeditions or exploring trips in tropical or subtropical\r\n  countries it is the only practical method of keeping a force\r\n  efficient.\r\n\r\n  Of course, one should also utilize mosquito nets as assisting in\r\n  protection from malaria, and as effective for yellow fever, dengue\r\n  and filariasis.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Prophylaxis._—There are innumerable methods of carrying\r\nout quinine prophylaxis among which may be noted.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Celli’s method. In this there is given 3 grains of quinine\r\n  each morning and 3 grains each night. Taken in this way Celli\r\n  thinks that harmful effects from quinine are avoided, that quinine\r\n  immunity does not occur and that there is no danger from quinine\r\n  haemoglobinuria. For children he recommends the tannate in\r\n  chocolate tablets.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) In 1909 Bertrand and other members of a French Commission\r\n  recommended two consecutive doses of 5 to 10 grains every\r\n  seventh and eighth day for benign infections and two consecutive\r\n  prophylactic doses of 10 to 15 grains every third and fourth days\r\n  where malignant tertian was prevalent.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Ziemann gives 15 grains every fourth day with the idea that\r\n  the quinine is entirely eliminated in four days. Nocht gives about\r\n  12 grains on two succeeding days of each week in divided doses of\r\n  2 or 3 grains instead of the entire amount in one dose.\r\n\r\n  Koch gave 15 grains on tenth and eleventh days.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Castellani’s method of 5 grains daily and a double dose once\r\n  a week is the one I recommend.\r\n\r\n_Sterilization of Carriers._—In addition to quinine prophylaxis for\r\nthose not infected we also have quinine disinfection for native or\r\nother carriers of malaria. For these infected persons Koch recommends\r\n15 grains on two to three successive days of each week, the course\r\nto be continued for three months. This plan of extirpation of the\r\nparasites of _malarial carriers_ is of great practical application.\r\nGill uses 10 grains of quinine daily for six months after discharge\r\nfrom hospital. The effect of tartar emetic on malarial gametes may\r\nprove of value.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—Cinchona bark was first introduced into Europe in\r\n1640 and has its name from Countess Chinchon, wife of the Peruvian\r\nViceroy, who was cured of a fever by this bark in 1638.\r\n\r\n  Much of our knowledge of the therapeutics of cinchona bark is due\r\n  to Torti. In giving the drug he used a large dose the first day and\r\n  the same for the subsequent two days. After that he administered\r\n  smaller doses for a week and then still smaller doses for two or\r\n  three weeks. Quinine was not introduced until 1820.\r\n\r\nAt present quinine or some salt of the alkaloid is used in malaria\r\ninstead of preparations of cinchona bark.\r\n\r\n  _Toxic Effects of Quinine._—The most important untoward\r\n  manifestations of cinchonism are the very common scarlatiniform,\r\n  eczematous or urticarial rashes, gastric disturbances and vertigo.\r\n  Impairment of vision may be brought about by quinine and quinine\r\n  haemoglobinuria is a recognized possibility. In quinine amblyopia\r\n  the pupils do not react to light and the optic disc is very pale,\r\n  thus distinguishing the impairment of vision due to the plugging of\r\n  the retinal vessels by the malarial parasite, in which condition\r\n  the pupils do react to light and the disc is a grayish red.\r\n\r\n  _Quinine Idiosyncrasy._—Fortunately the taking of quinine is well\r\n  borne by the great majority of persons but in exceptional cases\r\n  we may have developing, even after doses as small as one grain,\r\n  of (_a_) severe nausea vomiting or diarrhoea, (_b_) various skin\r\n  eruptions, usually of a scarlatiniform or urticarial type, (_c_)\r\n  marked ringing in the ears, dizziness or deafness, (_d_) impairment\r\n  of vision, (_e_) dyspnoea and (_f_) malarial haemoglobinuria. To\r\n  determine an idiosyncrasy make a scratch on the flexor surface of\r\n  the forearm and apply a drop of a 1 to 10 solution of quinine.\r\n  Oedema with a wide zone of erythema in about 5 minutes shows\r\n  idiosyncrasy. A control with normal saline should be made. It is\r\n  well to make this skin test before giving quinine intravenously.\r\n  For desensitization we give 1/10 grain of quinine combined with 5\r\n  grains of bicarbonate of soda and in about 1½ hours we give 1 grain\r\n  with 5 grains of bicarbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest and most generally obtainable salt is the sulphate. It\r\nis soluble in 720 parts of water and contains 74% of alkaloid. The\r\nopinion now prevails that this is one of the less desirable of forms\r\nfor the administration of quinine. It is frequently obtained in pill\r\nor tablet form and it must not be forgotten that such preparations\r\nmay be almost stone-like and pass through the alimentary tract\r\nwithout absorption. If used it is best to give it in acid solution\r\nmade by dissolving 5 grains of quinine sulphate in one teaspoonful (1\r\ndram) of water with one drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n  _Dosage of Quinine._—The ordinary full dose of quinine for an\r\n  adult is 10 grains repeated three times in a day or 30 grains\r\n  daily. Some authorities recommend 15 grains three times daily (45\r\n  grains) at the commencement of treatment and such dosage seems to\r\n  be just as efficient as the larger dose of 60 grains in a day.\r\n  In cinchonism we have ringing in the ears, fullness in the head,\r\n  deafness and dizziness. For children Bass recommends 1/20 of the\r\n  adult dose for each year of age so that a child of 5 years age\r\n  would receive ¼ of the adult dose. Beyond 15 years of age the dose\r\n  is that of an adult.\r\n\r\n  There now seems to be a tendency to use the alkaloid itself instead\r\n  of its salts, it having been found that the alkaloid and its very\r\n  insoluble tannate are absorbed from the digestive tract equally as\r\n  well as the soluble salts. Quinine is almost insoluble in water\r\n  (1-1560) and hence has less bitter taste than the soluble salts. It\r\n  is also less haemolytic so that it may be used with greater safety\r\n  where blackwater fever is feared.\r\n\r\n  Euquinine or ethylcarbonate of quinine contains 81% quinine, and\r\n  is only soluble in 1-12,000 parts of water, hence its comparative\r\n  tastelessness. It is expensive.\r\n\r\n  Quinine tannate contains only about 30% of quinine and is\r\n  practically insoluble in water. It is often given to children in\r\n  chocolate tablet form. It can often be taken by those who suffer\r\n  disagreeable effects from other salts. The dose should be 2½ times\r\n  that of quinine sulphate.\r\n\r\n  Until recently the bimuriate (72% of alkaloid and soluble in 1 part\r\n  of water) or the chlorhydrosulphate (74% of alkaloid and soluble\r\n  in 2 parts of water) have been considered the most desirable salts\r\n  for hypodermic injections or oral administration. At present,\r\n  owing to its extensive use in local anaesthesia and incident\r\n  availability, bimuriate of quinine and urea is to be recommended\r\n  for intramuscular use. It contains 60% of quinine and is soluble in\r\n  an equal amount of water.\r\n\r\n  It has been found to have a slightly greater tendency to produce\r\n  amblyopia than other quinine salts and should not be used\r\n  intravenously.\r\n\r\n  In a very important series of experiments on prisoners,\r\n  MacGilchrist found that hydroquinine (a synthetic product of\r\n  quinine) was about 20% more efficient than quinine. Cinchonine was\r\n  about the same as quinine while quinidine was about one-half as\r\n  potent as quinine.\r\n\r\n  Acton has praised the value of cinchona febrifuge (the combined\r\n  alkaloids of cinchona) given in daily doses of 21 grains for ten\r\n  days.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods of Administration\r\n\r\n_By Mouth._—This is the usual method and is the one to be preferred\r\nin all cases where other methods of administration are not\r\nnecessitated.\r\n\r\n  Golgi believes that quinine is most effective at the time of\r\n  liberation of merozoites from the bursting merocytes, hence he\r\n  administered quinine four hours before the attack with a view to\r\n  having it in its greatest concentration in the blood at such times.\r\n  When given intravenously the full concentration is obtained in a\r\n  very few minutes but with other methods this is a matter of great\r\n  variation.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to give the quinine in capsules or cachets, the pills\r\nand tablets being often so hard that they do not dissolve in the\r\nalimentary tract.\r\n\r\n  The method usually in vogue in military services is to give quinine\r\n  sulphate in acid solution. This method is trying to the stomach.\r\n\r\n_By Subcutaneous Injections._—This method is liable to be followed\r\nby necrosis and abscess formation or fibrous indurations. Quinine\r\nand urea hydrochloride is preferable either for subcutaneous or\r\nintramuscular injection.\r\n\r\n  Cohen holds that quinine and urea hydrochloride controls malarial\r\n  infection more rapidly and efficaciously than any other salt of\r\n  quinine when given intramuscularly. In order to prevent tetanus or\r\n  other infections he is very careful about asepsis. He recommends\r\n  that a 10 to 15-grain dose be injected every day for a week, then\r\n  once a week for a month, then once every two weeks for another\r\n  month. He considers a 33% solution as best, thus one could give 10\r\n  grains in the contents of an all-glass 2 cc. syringe.\r\n\r\n  James has recommended very dilute solutions for subcutaneous\r\n  injections (1-150). There are practical objections to this method.\r\n  It is usual to give about 1 gram (15 grains) of a soluble salt in\r\n  10 cc. of water. _The present view is that subcutaneous injections\r\n  deserve condemnation._\r\n\r\n_Intramuscular Injections._—It is now recognized that when quinine\r\nis not well borne when given by mouth the two modes of administration\r\nto be followed are either by intramuscular injection or introduction\r\nof the drug into a vein. For intramuscular use we dissolve a soluble\r\nsalt of quinine, as the bimuriate or chlorhydrosulphate, in distilled\r\nwater or sterile saline. A 50% solution is commonly used and from 6\r\nto 10 grains of quinine is injected into the gluteal muscles of one\r\nside about 3 inches below the iliac crest. Repeat the injection on\r\nthe other side. Repeat this daily dose of 12 to 20 grains for 3 or 4\r\ndays; then give quinine by mouth.\r\n\r\n  The solution should be autoclaved before use and the skin at the\r\n  site of injection painted with iodine. Dudgeon has called attention\r\n  to the constant production of oedema and necrosis in the area of\r\n  the injection. This tissue necrosis occurs immediately and persists\r\n  for a long time. If the injection is made in the neighborhood of an\r\n  important nerve, neuritis may ensue. Repeated injections should not\r\n  be given in the same area.\r\n\r\n  Of course in the use of quinine salts through the medium of the\r\n  hypodermic needle everything must be sterile.\r\n\r\n_Intravenous Injections._—Bass and many others think that when\r\nquinine cannot be administered by mouth it should be given\r\nintravenously. Not only is there the objection of inflammatory\r\nreactions or necrosis when the drug is given subcutaneously or\r\nintramuscularly but the absorption of the drug is so slow that the\r\npatient may die before we obtain the desired effect. Ross condemns\r\nthe subcutaneous method and recognizes the advantages of the\r\nintravenous method over the intramuscular one when rapidity of action\r\nis desirable.\r\n\r\n  In giving quinine intravenously Bass thinks that 10 grains at one\r\n  time is sufficient and that a 20-grain dose is not without danger.\r\n\r\n  He does not think it necessary to give more than 30 grains daily\r\n  in this way. Intravenous quinine seems to be entirely eliminated\r\n  within twenty-four hours and most of it within twelve hours.\r\n\r\n  When used in cerebral malaria he repeats the 10 grains\r\n  intravenously in eight hours if the drug cannot then be given by\r\n  mouth. Bass thinks that theoretically amyl nitrite might relax the\r\n  cerebral capillaries which are obstructed by parasite-infected red\r\n  cells and thus enable the quinine in the circulation to reach such\r\n  cells.\r\n\r\n  The best known method of administering quinine intravenously is\r\n  that of Bacelli. In this method 1 gram (15 grains) of a soluble\r\n  salt of quinine is given in 10 cc. of water.\r\n\r\n  MacGilchrist has shown experimentally that such a strength of\r\n  quinine (1-10) will coagulate blood serum.\r\n\r\n  In my opinion this is a dangerous method if the injection is made\r\n  rapidly. There is no doubt as to the necessity for using the\r\n  intravenous channel in cerebral or algid types of perniciousness\r\n  when intramuscular injections do not give results. The generally\r\n  accepted method is to use a salvarsan technique with a dilute\r\n  solution of quinine, giving 1 gram (15 grains) of some soluble\r\n  salt of quinine in 250 cc. salt solution. Such injections should\r\n  be given cautiously. Quinine hydrochloride, which is soluble in\r\n  40 parts of water, is the salt usually recommended. MacGilchrist\r\n  considers the very soluble acid salts as haemolytic and prefers\r\n  to give quinine base—3 pints of a solution of the alkaloid,\r\n  containing about 12 grains.\r\n\r\nMcLean has used concentrated solutions of quinine intravenously\r\nseveral hundred times in cases of malaria (6 being blackwater fever\r\nones) without any untoward results. He autoclaves his 10-grain\r\nsolution of hydrochlor-sulphate in 10 cc. of sterile water for\r\ntwenty minutes at 15 pounds, and injects it slowly into an arm vein,\r\nallowing about two minutes for the injection. The patients complain\r\nof a slight cough and hot feeling in the lungs with a succeeding\r\ndizziness which rapidly disappears. He is opposed to intramuscular\r\ninjections and found intravenous ones diluted 1 to 250 often to cause\r\nshock and collapse.\r\n\r\n  _Rectal Administration._—Some authorities recommend the\r\n  administration per rectum of a soluble salt of quinine in about 3\r\n  times the usual dose by mouth or hypodermically. It is considered\r\n  applicable in cases where there is marked vomiting. It certainly is\r\n  the least satisfactory way of giving quinine.\r\n\r\n_Dosage and Length of Treatment._—In Panama the standard preliminary\r\ntreatment is to give from 3 to 5 grains of calomel followed by 1 or 2\r\nounces of 50% magnesium sulphate.\r\n\r\n  Fayrer holds that a torpid liver interferes with the efficient\r\n  action of quinine, hence the value of calomel and salts. I prefer\r\n  to give 2 or 3 grains of calomel, in divided doses, followed by\r\n  sodium phosphate, 2 drams, every two hours, for three or four doses.\r\n\r\n_Standard Method._—The National Malaria Committee of the United\r\nStates recommends the following treatment: Give 30 grains of quinine\r\ndaily in three 10-grain doses. Keep this up for 4 days and follow\r\nby 10 grains every night for 8 weeks. Where the infection does not\r\npresent acute symptoms give the 10 grains daily for 8 weeks.\r\n\r\n_Canal Zone Treatment._—So soon as the diagnosis is made give 15\r\ngrains of quinine 3 times daily (45 grains in twenty-four hours) and\r\ncontinue such treatment for a week or until the temperature has been\r\nnormal for five or six days. Then give 10 grains 3 times daily for\r\nten or twelve days.\r\n\r\nIt is considered that by employing such thorough treatment from the\r\nbeginning the tendency to latency or relapse is prevented—in other\r\nwords the disease is really cured. It is interesting to note that\r\nTorti recommended large single doses at the commencement of treatment.\r\n\r\n  Espach has noted that he had frequent relapses in many cases\r\n  treated by this method. In my opinion the Canal Zone treatment\r\n  should be followed by 10 grain doses daily for 8 weeks.\r\n\r\n  Tonics of iron, arsenic and strychnine are valuable in treating the\r\n  anaemia, but it is not advisable to add small doses of quinine to\r\n  such tonic mixture.\r\n\r\n  _Repeated Small Doses._—In Nocht’s method we give the quinine in\r\n  small doses repeated several times in the day, as 3 or 4 grains\r\n  given 5 or 6 times daily. Such treatment is thought advisable when\r\n  there is a tendency to haemoglobinuria or when giving quinine to\r\n  pregnant women.\r\n\r\nIn giving the small doses one should see that they are given during\r\nthe night as well as the day.\r\n\r\n  _Quinine and Pregnancy._—There is frequently hesitancy in giving\r\n  quinine to a pregnant woman but unless the malaria is controlled\r\n  the patient will be apt to abort. Potassium bromide is thought to\r\n  control the ecbolic influences of quinine.\r\n\r\n  Clark states that the experience at Ancon Hospital would indicate\r\n  that quinine can be given with impunity to pregnant women. In\r\n  malarial subjects quinine after parturition is of value not only in\r\n  controlling a fever due to malaria but it also favors involution\r\n  and aids in the healing of perineal tears. The quinine also is\r\n  beneficial in improving the quality of the mother’s milk and does\r\n  no harm to the child.\r\n\r\n_Manson’s Method._—In a benign malarial infection Manson prefers to\r\nwait until the hot stage has been passed and the patient is beginning\r\nto perspire, this idea being that the headache and other symptoms\r\nare aggravated and that very little advantage is gained by treatment\r\nduring the early part of the paroxysm. He gives 10 grains at the\r\nonset of the sweating stage and afterward 5 grains, 3 or 4 times\r\ndaily, for the following week. He then gives a daily tonic containing\r\narsenic and iron, with a quinine treatment every seventh day for\r\nabout two months.\r\n\r\n  For regularity he advises the quinine treatment on Sunday giving a\r\n  dose of salts in the morning followed by three 5-grain doses during\r\n  the day.\r\n\r\n  Manson notes the danger of large doses of quinine as producing\r\n  not only serious disturbances of sight and hearing but pronounced\r\n  cardiac depression as well.\r\n\r\n  There are many who speak highly of Warburg’s tincture in treatment.\r\n  It is both laxative and sudorific. The dose is ½ ounce (15 cc.)\r\n  which contains about 5 grains of quinine sulphate and 4 grains of\r\n  extract of aloes. As a rule it is better to give the quinine and\r\n  the laxative separately.\r\n\r\n  More recently the tendency has been to give large doses of\r\n  quinine, not only for its greater curative value but, as well, for\r\n  the prevention of relapses. Craig, however, states that in his\r\n  experience with aestivo-autumnal infections he has yet to see a\r\n  single case, in which treatment was promptly instituted, that did\r\n  not recover with a daily treatment of 30 grains.\r\n\r\n_Koch’s Method._—Koch recommended 15 grains each day for a week,\r\nthen three days without quinine. Then three days with 15-grain doses\r\neach day. Then one week without quinine, followed by three days of\r\ntreatment. This plan of a weekly interval followed by three days of\r\ntreatment is continued until not fewer than 30 15-grain doses are\r\ngiven over nine or ten weeks.\r\n\r\n_Drugs Other than Quinine._—Salvarsan and neosalvarsan have been\r\nextensively used and with some success in benign infections but\r\nwithout material effect in malignant tertian ones.\r\n\r\n  _Intermittent Treatment._—There are those who consider a treatment\r\n  in which days of quinine administration are followed by days\r\n  without quinine as equally efficient and less trying on the\r\n  patient. Some of the experiences of Stephens and his colleagues\r\n  indicated that 45 grains on two consecutive days of each week and\r\n  continued for 8 weeks gave better results than 30 grains daily over\r\n  such a period. In their experiments a dosage above 45 grains in a\r\n  day did not seem any more efficient than 45 grains, so that this\r\n  may well be considered as a maximum dose. On the whole however\r\n  there seems to be a greater tendency to relapse following an\r\n  intermittent treatment and Acton, as a result of his comparison of\r\n  intermittent and continuous methods, deprecates the intermittent\r\n  one.\r\n\r\n  Some have thought that salvarsan aided the specific action of\r\n  quinine.\r\n\r\n  Many physicians recommend arsenic in the form of Fowler’s solution\r\n  or as sodium cacodylate. It is most useful in chronic cases. Some\r\n  preparation of iron is, of course, indicated in malarial anaemias.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that radium and X-ray treatment, when directed to\r\nthe spleen, assist the action of quinine.\r\n\r\nMethylene blue, next to quinine, has been considered as the most\r\nvaluable drug. It is given in 2-grain doses every four hours. It is\r\nalso given intravenously.\r\n\r\n  The form of methylene blue to use is that labelled “Medicinal.”\r\n\r\nIt is often stated that the opium fiends of the tropics are immune to\r\nmalaria and some physicians have claimed antiperiodic properties for\r\nthe drug. Dover’s powder is lauded by some as of value in symptomatic\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n  Surveyor has recommended picric acid in the treatment of malaria in\r\n  doses of 2 grains two or three times daily.\r\n\r\n  Recently hectine, a remedy somewhat similar to the cacodylates,\r\n  has been strongly recommended by the French. It is given\r\n  intramuscularly in 2-grain doses. It is said to be valuable when\r\n  there is a leucopenia as it has a tonic action. It has been\r\n  recommended to combine this treatment with quinine.\r\n\r\n  It is said to be a good substitute for quinine in blackwater fever.\r\n\r\nRogers has recently noted the value of tartar emetic injections in\r\neradicating the sexual parasites of carriers.\r\n\r\n  After rather extended trial of this drug for the above purpose and\r\n  as a method of treating ordinary infections the general opinion is\r\n  against its value.\r\n\r\n  _General and Symptomatic Treatment._—During the course of the\r\n  fever the patient should remain in bed and given only broths.\r\n  In the intermissions of the benign forms one may allow a more\r\n  generous diet. It is important that the patient be not allowed\r\n  to become constipated and as a laxative one grain of calomel in\r\n  divided doses followed by effervescing phosphate of soda is very\r\n  satisfactory.\r\n\r\n  For the nausea sips of an ice-cold alkaline mineral water or\r\n  cracked ice will generally prove effective. In more refractory\r\n  cases spirits of chloroform or even a hypodermic of morphine\r\n  may be necessary. Counterirritation to the epigastrium is often\r\n  a help. Phenacetine may be given for the headache although ice\r\n  water compresses are generally sufficient. In algid states hot\r\n  water bottles should be applied to the body. During convalescence\r\n  excesses in food or drink should be avoided as well as fatigue or\r\n  exposure to wet or cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBLACKWATER FEVER\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Blackwater fever is a disease of disputed etiology\r\nbut recently there has seemed to be rather general agreement that it\r\nis connected with repeated attacks of malaria. It is prone to affect\r\nthe old European residents of parts of the tropics where malignant\r\ntertian is rampant.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of lowered integrity of the red cells, by reason of\r\nrepeated attacks of malaria, we may have extensive lysis of the red\r\ncells following the administration of a dose of quinine or as the\r\nresult of refrigeration, excessive exposure to the sun or great\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nClinically we have a prostrating chill of asthenic type\r\nassociated with early jaundice and the passage of porter-colored\r\nurine—haemoglobinuria.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Haemoglobinuric Fever, Bilious Haemoglobinuric Fever,\r\nHaemorrhagic Malarial Fever.\r\n\r\nFrench: Fièvre Bilieuse Hemoglobinurique. German: Schwarzwasserfieber.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—There is no reasonable doubt that the explanation of\r\n  the fact that blackwater fever was first brought to the attention\r\n  of the medical world, by Lebeau and other French naval surgeons,\r\n  in Madagascar, in 1850-1853, was due to the confusion of this\r\n  disease with the bilious remittent type of pernicious malaria as\r\n  well as with yellow fever. Even after the clinical picture was well\r\n  recognized, disputes as to the nature of the coloring matter of\r\n  the characteristic urine were frequent, some considering that the\r\n  dark color, which we now know to be due to haemoglobinuria, was due\r\n  to haematuria or that the color was due to bile. Blackwater fever\r\n  must have been the condition referred to in medical literature\r\n  of the period, 1850 to 1870, under the names “Fièvre bilieuse\r\n  haematurique,” “haemorrhagic malarial fever” and “febris remittens\r\n  haemorrhagica.”\r\n\r\n  It was first described in the U. S. by Cummings of Louisiana\r\n  in 1859. Other American physicians during the next ten years,\r\n  described the disease from various other Southern states.\r\n\r\n  Veretas noted the presence of the disease in Greece, in 1858.\r\n\r\n  It is rather remarkable that the disease was not noted by so keen\r\n  an observer as Torti, if it existed in his time, and Manson states\r\n  that it is strange that it should not have been recognized in India\r\n  if it had existed there prior to recent times. Some think that its\r\n  introduction into Africa has been of recent occurrence. There are\r\n  two explanations of the recent greater prominence of the disease in\r\n  Africa and other tropical areas, where malignant malaria prevails\r\n  extensively, which are (1) that there has been a great influx of\r\n  susceptible Europeans into such areas during the past twenty or\r\n  thirty years and (2) that the more frequent and excessive dosing of\r\n  malarial patients with quinine is responsible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Geographical distribution of blackwater\r\nfever.]\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—It is in tropical Africa that the\r\n  disease is of prime importance as a cause of death and invaliding.\r\n  Here it prevails chiefly in West, Central and East Africa from\r\n  about 12° N. to 12° S. latitude. It is less frequent in Northern\r\n  Africa although a considerable number of cases have been reported\r\n  from Algeria. It is unknown in Egypt, a country where malaria is\r\n  very rare in Europeans.\r\n\r\n  In India it occurs in several districts and Stephens states that\r\n  in the Duars (Bengal) he saw more cases in a fortnight than he\r\n  had seen in the same time in Africa. In Europe it occurs chiefly\r\n  in Southern Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and Greece. Blackwater fever\r\n  was frequently noted among the British forces in Macedonia and\r\n  Palestine during the World War.\r\n\r\n  It is common in Central America and Northern South America,\r\n  especially in the regions of the Amazon basin, in Brazil.\r\n\r\n  In the U. S. it is chiefly found in the most malarious sections of\r\n  Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Florida\r\n  and South Carolina. It would seem that it is becoming more rare in\r\n  the Southern States.\r\n\r\n  As a result of malarial prophylaxis among the Americans working in\r\n  the Panama Canal Zone it has almost disappeared among them although\r\n  still common among the white Europeans in the same region who\r\n  neglect quinine prophylaxis and mosquito protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—There seem to be cases where from very heavy infection\r\nwith the malignant tertian parasite, as from 12 to 20% of the red\r\ncells, one can expect the appearance of a more or less dark urine,\r\nthe color of which is due to haemoglobinuria. Such cases give support\r\nto the old view that haemoglobinuric fever was simply a type of\r\npernicious malaria.\r\n\r\n  Brem has proposed for such cases the designation, pernicious\r\n  malarial fever with haemoglobinuria.\r\n\r\nThe idea as to etiology which now seems most generally accepted\r\nis that blackwater fever occurs almost solely in those who have\r\nresided for considerable periods of time in districts where malignant\r\ntertian malaria is very prevalent and intense and who have repeatedly\r\nsuffered from such malarial attacks. Rarely blackwater fever may\r\nbe connected with benign tertian infections or exceptionally with\r\nquartan ones. As a result of the damage done the patient by the\r\nmalarial attacks there is a tendency on the part of his red cells\r\nto haemolysis which may be due to the production of a hypothetical\r\nautolysin or to anaphylactic sensitizations, as has been suggested\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n  Malaria is the predisposing cause and the exciting cause may be\r\n  any of a number of different factors capable of lowering body\r\n  resistance such as the occurrence of another malarial attack,\r\n  the administration of quinine, particularly of the acid salts of\r\n  quinine in rather large doses, refrigeration, as brought about by\r\n  one’s clothes becoming wet and then later subjected to the chilling\r\n  influence of a sea breeze, to excessive fatigue or dietetic or\r\n  alcoholic excesses.\r\n\r\n  Quinine administration, particularly if associated with\r\n  refrigeration, is the most common exciting factor.\r\n\r\n  As regards the association of malaria and blackwater fever\r\n  Stephens, in a study of 390 cases of blackwater, found that 73%\r\n  of the cases showed malarial parasites on the day preceding the\r\n  haemoglobinuria, 47.5% on the day of the attack and 23% on the day\r\n  following the appearance of the dark urine. Other workers give\r\n  higher figures as 95, 70 and 20%.\r\n\r\n  Where one utilizes the methods of examining for increased\r\n  percentage of large mononuclears or for melaniferous leucocytes,\r\n  in those cases not showing malarial parasites, the percentage\r\n  of evidence of malaria is greatly increased. It is necessary to\r\n  understand that a small percentage of cases diagnosed as blackwater\r\n  fever do not show evidences of malaria at autopsy and cases are\r\n  recorded where blackwater has attacked persons who had never had\r\n  malarial fever, such instances, however being exceptional.\r\n\r\n  _The Quinine Theory._—This idea as to the causation of blackwater\r\n  fever first originated with Veretas, in Greece, in 1858. Later\r\n  Tomaselli supported this view in Italy and more recently it was\r\n  advocated by Koch. Just as in connection with the influence of\r\n  Koch’s great prestige much harm was done in prophylaxis against\r\n  bovine tuberculosis so in this matter of quinine in the causing of\r\n  blackwater the influence was unfortunate because many persons with\r\n  severe malaria now refuse to take the specific quinine for fear of\r\n  bringing on haemoglobinuria.\r\n\r\n  It may be stated that quinine alone, even in doses which are\r\n  capable of producing profound toxic effects such as disturbances\r\n  of sight and hearing, weak heart and collapse does not, other than\r\n  exceptionally, cause haemoglobinuria. It has even been stated\r\n  that quinine base and quinine tannate tend to prevent haemolysis,\r\n  haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria. Blackwater fever may develop\r\n  without the previous administration of quinine.\r\n\r\n  _Theory as to Acidosis with a Damaged Liver Plus Malaria and Acid\r\n  Salts of Quinine._\r\n\r\n  MacGilchrist has recently advanced the idea that blackwater fever\r\n  is brought about by an acidosis in one with a damaged liver plus\r\n  malaria and the administration of acid salts of quinine. He thinks\r\n  that one can safely give the quinine when alkalis are being given\r\n  and that quinine base is protective against haemolysis.\r\n\r\n  _Theory as to Its being Caused by a Piroplasm._\r\n\r\n  Sambon has thought by reason of the clinical resemblance of\r\n  blackwater to certain haemoglobinuric diseases in cattle, dogs and\r\n  sheep that such a cause might be operative. These parasites of the\r\n  red cells are easily discernible in the animal infections but have\r\n  never been seen in blackwater fever.\r\n\r\n  _The Chlamydozoal Hypothesis._\r\n\r\n  Leishman has recently noted appearances in the large mononuclear\r\n  cells of the blood of blackwater patients of certain cell\r\n  inclusions which he thought to be of chlamydozoal nature and that\r\n  these chlamydozoa might be etiological factors. Such appearances\r\n  may not only be absent in marked cases of blackwater but may be\r\n  seen in conditions other than blackwater fever.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—There seems to be a consensus of opinion that when\r\nmalaria is kept in check by proper and persistent quinine prophylaxis\r\nor by other antimalarial measures blackwater fever becomes mild in\r\ncharacter or even nonexistent. It is those who are careless about\r\nquinine prophylaxis or those who expose themselves to depressing\r\ninfluences as cold, wet, excessive fatigue or alcoholic debauches in\r\nwhom blackwater shows itself.\r\n\r\n  Overexertion leading to fatigue and chilling seem to be the most\r\n  common exciting factors. Those in bad health from disease or lack\r\n  of proper diet seem more susceptible. A peculiar feature of the\r\n  disease is that it may not be present in a district for a number\r\n  of years and then assume almost epidemic proportions. Europeans\r\n  are usually exempt from attacks during their first year in endemic\r\n  tropical areas. Dudgeon obtained a malarial history in every one of\r\n  a hundred cases observed by him in the Balkans.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nAs a result of the excessive destruction of red cells the liver\r\ncannot convert the great amount of haemoglobin outpouring into bile\r\npigment so that haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria result. It has\r\nbeen estimated by Ponfick that if ⅙ of the red cells are destroyed\r\nthe liver is unable to dispose of the liberated haemoglobin and\r\nhaemoglobinuria results. A damaged liver would be less competent.\r\nVarious discussions as to autolysins and complement content of serum\r\nhave arisen.\r\n\r\n  Dudgeon has demonstrated active haemolysins in the tissues and\r\n  urine of blackwater fever cases which bodies he was unable to note\r\n  in other conditions including malaria. There was no evidence of\r\n  increased fragility of the red cells. There was no evidence of\r\n  auto-haemolysis. Bile pigment in the plasma occurred in most of the\r\n  cases which ended fatally.\r\n\r\n  As a rule we have the pathological findings which go with malaria.\r\n  As peculiarities of blackwater noted by Whipple and others may\r\n  be mentioned congestion of the kidneys with purple-colored\r\n  pyramids. In the spleen the Malpighian bodies are prominent and\r\n  sharply outlined. Very striking are the necroses of the Malpighian\r\n  corpuscles of the spleen and focal necroses of the liver. Whipple\r\n  considers that this speaks for a powerful circulating toxin in\r\n  blackwater fever which is not present in malaria.\r\n\r\nThe liver cells in the area of the central veins show the most marked\r\ndestruction. The myocardium shows fatty change and the fat lipoid\r\ncontent of the adrenal is reduced.\r\n\r\n  The anuria is thought to be mechanical and due to the plugging up\r\n  of the tubules by haemoglobin casts.\r\n\r\n  The urine shows a reddish to black color and has a sediment made up\r\n  of granular débris with haematoidin crystals and only rarely a red\r\n  cell. It is not a haematuria.\r\n\r\n  The absorption bands of methaemoglobin are usually noted\r\n  spectroscopically.\r\n\r\n  Urobilin and albumin are present in large quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case.=—In a person who has lived in an intensely\r\nmalarious region for one or two years or even long after he has left\r\nsuch districts and who has had several malarial attacks, there comes\r\non what is considered as another malarial chill, which may or may not\r\ndefinitely be connected with some resistance-lowering influence, as\r\nexposure to tropical sun or rain, or indulgence in dietary or other\r\nexcesses, or following in one to six hours the accustomed dose of\r\nquinine. This chill, however, is more prostrating than those formerly\r\nexperienced and upon passing his urine the patient notes its reddish\r\nto black coffee color and himself makes the diagnosis of blackwater\r\nfever. The attack comes on suddenly with a very severe chill, marked\r\nprostration and pain over the region of the kidneys. The temperature\r\nin a typical case rapidly goes up to 104° to 105°F.\r\n\r\n  Rather profuse sweating accompanies the fall of the fever and the\r\n  patient is markedly debilitated after the subsidence of the fever.\r\n  There may be a recurrence of the paroxysm the following day. The\r\n  fever course, however, may be more or less continuous or remittent.\r\n  In other words it tends to be irregular and atypical.\r\n\r\nNausea and bilious vomiting come on early with epigastric distress.\r\nAlmost as pathognomonic as the haemoglobinuria is the early and\r\nintense jaundice. This comes on within a few hours or almost\r\nsimultaneously with the haemoglobinuria and usually lasts for two or\r\nthree days after the haemoglobinuria and fever have ceased. Itching\r\nof the skin of this jaundice is not noticeable.\r\n\r\n  The spleen and liver are enlarged and tender. Albuminuria comes\r\n  on with the haemoglobinuria and shows from 1/10 to 4/10 of 1% of\r\n  albumen by weight.\r\n\r\n  The pulse is rapid, 110 to 120, from the first but soon becomes\r\n  feeble and of low tension. In severe cases the very rapid almost\r\n  thready pulse, with pallor and cold extremities, may resemble a\r\n  severe haemorrhage. Epistaxis is not uncommon. A very unfavorable\r\n  symptom seems to be hiccough. Another frequent cause of death and\r\n  the one against which we chiefly direct our therapeutic measures\r\n  is anuria with subsequent uraemic symptoms, such as coma and\r\n  convulsions. At times a nephritis may develop in the course of a\r\n  blackwater attack and the case subsequently run as one of severe\r\n  nephritis.\r\n\r\nVery striking is the rapidly developing anaemia, some cases showing a\r\nloss of two million red cells in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe mind is usually clear throughout an attack, the patient showing\r\nrestlessness and marked anxiety.\r\n\r\n  In mild cases the fever course and haemoglobinuria is over within\r\n  twenty-four hours leaving the patient far more prostrated than\r\n  would a malarial paroxysm. In severe cases, however, the fever\r\n  runs a remittent course over several days, with more marked\r\n  haemoglobinuria and jaundice.\r\n\r\n  There may be cases which only show haemoglobinuria. These apyretic\r\n  cases have been considered by some as quinine haemoglobinuria.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _Fever Course._—This resembles that of a malarial paroxysm and may\r\n  be intermittent in character or last several days as a remittent\r\n  fever. The rigor which accompanies the febrile rise is intense.\r\n\r\n  _The Liver and Spleen._—As a result of the marked blood\r\n  destruction the liver is unable to dispose of the haemoglobin\r\n  outpouring and icterus, which usually comes on in a few hours and\r\n  is intense, is almost constant together with epigastric distress,\r\n  bilious vomiting and tenderness and slight enlargement of the\r\n  liver. The spleen is also somewhat enlarged and quite tender.\r\n\r\n  _The Circulatory System._—At first the pulse is rapid with tension\r\n  but soon it becomes weak, compressible and of low tension. In\r\n  severe cases it may have a rate of 150 or more or even become\r\n  thready.\r\n\r\n  _The Genito-urinary System._—The dark colored urine is\r\n  pathognomonic of the disease and gives it its name. The reddish\r\n  to almost black color is due to haemoglobin and not to bile.\r\n  Bile pigments do not appear in the urine. There is but rarely\r\n  a red cell to be found in the granular débris with occasional\r\n  haematoidin crystals which forms the urinary sediment, hence it is\r\n  haemoglobinuria and not haematuria.\r\n\r\n  The urine resists decomposition for a long time. Albumin is present\r\n  in large amount and comes on with the onset of haemoglobinuria.\r\n  Casts are abundant and urobilinuria is marked. As a result of the\r\n  blocking up of the renal tubules with haemoglobin casts pain over\r\n  the loins and anuria may occur. There may be vesical tenesmus.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—Cases have been reported where as many as 2,000,000\r\n  red cells have been destroyed within twenty-four hours, so that\r\n  rapid and marked anaemia characterizes the disease. The blood is\r\n  thin and the serum tinged. The degenerative changes of the red\r\n  cells are not as commonly seen as one would expect but this is\r\n  probably due to the fact that degenerated cells are first destroyed\r\n  in the excessive haemolysis. Hb percentage reduction generally\r\n  parallels the reduction in red cells. Melaniferous leucocytes may\r\n  be found and during the leucopenia, which follows the paroxysm, the\r\n  large mononuclears and transitionals may be increased to 20%. There\r\n  is a reduction in the alkalinity and coagulability of the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—An unusually asthenic prostrating paroxysm,\r\nsimilar to that of a malarial chill, but with more intense rigor,\r\nduring which haemoglobinuria, early jaundice and marked bilious\r\nvomiting are features, makes for a diagnosis of blackwater fever.\r\n\r\n  The two diseases which are most likely to be confused with\r\n  blackwater fever are yellow fever and bilious remittent malarial\r\n  fever.\r\n\r\n  In infectious jaundice the jaundice does not appear for 48 to 72\r\n  hours, the pulse is slow, there is no haemoglobinuria, although\r\n  there may be a haematuria, and we have a polynuclear leucocytosis.\r\n\r\n  A case of paroxysmal haemoglobinuria occurring in a blackwater\r\n  district would be impossible to differentiate from a very mild\r\n  case of blackwater fever. Chlorate of potash or carbolic-acid\r\n  poisoning, or snake bite, or severe burns, may produce\r\n  haemoglobinuria.\r\n\r\n  -----------+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------\r\n             | Blackwater fever  |   Yellow fever    | Bilious remittent\r\n  -----------+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------\r\n  Onset      |Sudden but asthenic|Sudden but asthenic|Comes  on  more\r\n             | with marked       | for two or        | slowly.\r\n             | rigor.            | three days.       |\r\n  -----------+-------------------+-------------------+--------------------\r\n  Urine      |Haemoglobinuria.   |No blood in urine  |Bile in urine.\r\n             | Pink foam to      | before 3d or 4th  | Yellow froth on\r\n             | urine.

It is difficult to\r\nmake good blood smears. In the urine we note the granular sediment of\r\ndébris of red-cell destruction with at times haematoidin crystals.\r\nSpectroscopically we get absorption bands of methaemoglobin and more\r\nrarely oxyhaemoglobin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—The most important clinical spectra.\r\n(_Monographic Medicine._ D. Appleton and Co., New York.)]\r\n\r\n  Albumin is present in quantity and urobilin is usually present in\r\n  large amount.\r\n\r\n  One can examine the urine for blood by the haemin-crystals, guaiac\r\n  or benzidin tests.\r\n\r\n  Burkitt has noted that his cases of blackwater have shown a very\r\n  acid urine with large amounts of acetone bodies.\r\n\r\n  The serum shows haemoglobinaemia and may show reduced alkalinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nSo far as statistics go the mortality rate would appear to be\r\ninfluenced by the delicateness of the tests used for determining the\r\npresence of haemoglobinuria. When a diagnosis is only made with the\r\npresence of marked haemoglobinuria, showing porter-colored urine, the\r\nmortality rate is, of course, higher than when slight haemoglobinuria\r\nis taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n  In cases treated with quinine, Deaderick, in statistics of various\r\n  authorities, gives a death rate of 25.9%; in cases not so treated,\r\n  of 11.1%.\r\n\r\n  Marked and persistent vomiting and hiccough are very unfavorable\r\n  signs. In particular, however, it is anuria that gives us our\r\n  greatest concern in the care of a case. A severe attack is followed\r\n  by a marked anaemia and convalescence is usually protracted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The view now generally entertained is that where\r\nmalarial prophylaxis is properly carried out there will not be any\r\nblackwater fever. In persons who have had a previous attack of\r\nblackwater fever quinine prophylaxis should be with quinine tannate\r\nor quinine base, avoiding the acid salts of quinine.\r\n\r\n  In particular any exposure to chilling influences or conditions\r\n  which lower resistance should be avoided. As blackwater fever is\r\n  more prevalent among those who have been for 2 or 3 years in highly\r\n  malarious, tropical regions than among recent arrivals, the former\r\n  should exercise the greater care as to errors in diet, alcoholic\r\n  excesses, exposure to wet and irregularity in quinine prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—There is less unanimity of opinion as to the\r\nadvisability of giving quinine during an attack of blackwater fever\r\nthan exists as to any other therapeutic measure.\r\n\r\n  Of course if it be true that quinine base is devoid of haemolytic\r\n  influence the fear of increasing haemolysis by giving quinine would\r\n  not have to be considered. At any rate any red cells containing\r\n  parasites will surely be destroyed in the general haemolysis and\r\n  with them their contained parasites, so that it does not seem\r\n  reasonable to give quinine during the first day or two of the\r\n  attack. Quinine, if given, should not be by mouth for fear of\r\n  increasing the nausea and vomiting. The majority of authorities\r\n  hold that if parasites persist after two or three days from the\r\n  onset quinine is indicated. Some give quinine during the first day\r\n  if parasites are present but otherwise they withhold quinine.\r\n\r\nAbsolute rest in bed, avoidance of chilling and good nursing are the\r\nprime considerations in treatment.\r\n\r\n  The patients should be given alkaline waters freely, as Vichy\r\n  or water containing 30 grains of bicarbonate of soda to the\r\n  pint. Cracked ice often tends to lessen the nausea and vomiting.\r\n  Albumin water or barley water may be retained better than milk or\r\n  broths. As the condition is so asthenic one cannot disregard the\r\n  nourishment of the patient during the first two or three days as is\r\n  true of the sthenic first stage of yellow fever. Hot fomentations\r\n  to the loins are indicated for relief of pain and the effect on the\r\n  renal congestion.\r\n\r\n  Saline enemata are of particular value and may suffice in mild\r\n  cases. In severe cases subcutaneous or intravenous saline\r\n  injections are necessary. Sorel recommends the intravenous\r\n  injection of lactose or glucose solutions in quantities of about\r\n  300 cc. (Crystallized glucose 47 grams, water 1000 cc. or C. P.\r\n  lactose 92.5 grams, water 1000 cc.) He also uses these sugar\r\n  solutions as enemata. Dry cupping or hot fomentations over the\r\n  loins are the usual remedies in threatened suppression of the\r\n  urine. If blackwater fever should be shown to be accompanied by\r\n  diminished alkalinity of the serum then the intravenous injection\r\n  of a 1 or 2% solution of bicarbonate of soda would be indicated.\r\n  Some have recommended calcium lactate in doses of 20 grains every\r\n  four hours. There is little evidence however to indicate that it\r\n  is of value. Transfusion of blood has been practised but reports\r\n  of such treatment indicate that while temporary improvement occurs\r\n  yet this is followed by a return of haemoglobinuria. From Dudgeon’s\r\n  work it would seem that the existing haemolysins would destroy the\r\n  foreign red cells.\r\n\r\n  Burkitt claims excellent results by intravenous injections of\r\n  alkaline solutions, similar to those recommended under “cholera.”\r\n  He also finds neosalvarsan of the greatest value in treatment, as\r\n  cases so treated convalesce most rapidly.\r\n\r\n  Hearsey advocates a mixture in which there is contained 10 grains\r\n  of bicarbonate of soda and 1/30 grain of bichloride of mercury in\r\n  each dose, to be given every two hours.\r\n\r\n  Cholesterin has been given in 15-grain doses in suspension in thick\r\n  milk every four hours with the idea that it is anti-haemolytic. The\r\n  dose is repeated 2 or 3 times.\r\n\r\n  Calomel in large doses has been recommended by some tropical\r\n  practitioners but it would seem advisable only to use calomel to\r\n  keep the bowels open and then in small divided doses.\r\n\r\n  Antipyretics should not be used from their depressing action on the\r\n  heart.\r\n\r\n  For the urinary suppression, Wallace recommends salines as hot\r\n  as can be borne, administered high in the colon by a double-flow\r\n  tube. Since he found this treatment effective after intravenous and\r\n  rectal injections had failed, it is to be inferred that the results\r\n  obtained were due not to the further administration of fluid but to\r\n  the action of heat applied directly to the splanchnic area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE TRYPANOSOMIASES\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—African trypanosomiasis is an important protozoal\r\ndisease of Central and West Africa, due to a flagellate, _Trypanosoma\r\ngambiense_, and transmitted by a tsetse fly, _Glossina palpalis_.\r\nThe trypanosome undergoes a developmental cycle in the fly which\r\ndoes not become infective until after about twenty days. The period\r\nof incubation is about two or three weeks, after which an irregular\r\nfever with approximately normal morning temperature and high evening\r\nrise appears, attended with a rapid pulse rate at all times. This is\r\ncalled the stage of trypanosome fever and may show trypanosomes in\r\nthe peripheral blood. Later on the glands enlarge and gland juice\r\nshows trypanosomes. With the appearance of a fine tremor of the\r\ntongue, a state of apathy or lethargy, known as sleeping sickness,\r\nsets in, attended with trypanosomes in the cerebro-spinal fluid.\r\nGradually increasing mental deterioration marks the almost invariable\r\ncourse to death. A more virulent type of trypanosomiasis is found in\r\nRhodesia.\r\n\r\n  In Brazil there is a disease caused by a flagellate,\r\n  _Schizotrypanum cruzi_, which resembles a trypanosome and is\r\n  transmitted by a bug, _Lamus megistus_. The disease runs an acute\r\n  course with a high fever and great mortality in infants showing\r\n  chiefly manifestations of involvement of brain or thyroid gland. In\r\n  adults it runs a chronic course showing neurological manifestations\r\n  or signs of myxoedema or even of Addison’s disease.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Sleeping sickness; Negro lethargy. French: Maladie du\r\nsommeil. German: Schlafkrankheit. For the Brazilian trypanosomiasis,\r\nSchizotrypanosomiasis; Chagas’ disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—In describing sleeping sickness, in 1803, Winterbottom\r\n  brought out the importance of enlargements of the posterior\r\n  cervical glands (Winterbottom’s sign).\r\n\r\n  In 1880 Evans had found a trypanosome in the blood of horses\r\n  affected with surra and several years afterward Bruce discovered\r\n  that nagana, a fatal disease of cattle, was due to a trypanosome,\r\n  _T. brucei_. In 1890 Nepveu found a trypanosome in the blood of a\r\n  man in Algeria but owing to vagueness of description the discovery\r\n  did not attract attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Geographical distribution of African\r\ntrypanosomiasis.]\r\n\r\n  In 1901, Forde found a parasite in the blood of a patient in the\r\n  River Gambia Colony who had a fever and in 1902 Dutton recognized\r\n  the parasite as a trypanosome and gave it the name _T. gambiense_.\r\n  In 1902, Castellani, finding a trypanosome in the cerebro-spinal\r\n  fluid of a patient with sleeping sickness, brought about the\r\n  establishment of the connection between the trypanosome in the\r\n  blood (trypanosome fever) and the trypanosome in the cerebro-spinal\r\n  fluid (sleeping sickness). In 1903, Bruce and Nabarro reported that\r\n  this disease was spread by a tsetse fly, _Glossina palpalis_.\r\n\r\n  In 1910 Stephens and Fantham brought forward the existence of a\r\n  more virulent trypanosome, _T. rhodesiense_.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The disease exists on the West Coast\r\n  of Africa, from Senegal to Mossamedes. It is also present in the\r\n  Congo basin and particularly in Uganda. The more virulent form is\r\n  found in Rhodesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The African trypanosomiases follow infection with two\r\nspecies of trypanosomes; the more virulent type of the disease,\r\noccurring in South Central Africa, being due to _Trypanosoma\r\nrhodesiense_, transmitted by _Glossina morsitans_ and that of\r\nless severe type, but of more general distribution, being due to\r\n_T. gambiense_ and transmitted by _Glossina palpalis_. The very\r\nimportant _Trypanosoma brucei_, which is the devastating agent in the\r\nAfrican horse, dog and cattle disease, nagana, is also transmitted\r\nby _Glossina morsitans_ and there exists the opinion that this\r\ntrypanosome is identical with _T. rhodesiense_.\r\n\r\nMacfie has reported a new trypanosome, _T. nigeriense_, from\r\nyoung persons in Nigeria. It is said to be less virulent than _T.\r\ngambiense_, and to be transmitted by _Glossina tachinoides_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—_Trypanosoma gambiense_ (slide presented by\r\nProfessor F. G. Novy) (From Todd.)]\r\n\r\n  Bruce considers _T. nigeriense_ as being _T. gambiense_. Macfie\r\n  noted many short stumpy forms in animals inoculated with _T.\r\n  nigeriense_.\r\n\r\n  These trypanosomes are blood flagellates and are typical of the\r\n  Binucleata in possessing two chromatin-staining areas, the larger\r\n  and more centrally situated mass being the tropho or macronucleus\r\n  and the smaller, but more deeply staining one, the kineto or\r\n  micronucleus (Blepharoplast). Trypanosomes have a fusiform or\r\n  fish-shaped body which stains blue. Near the less pointed,\r\n  nonflagellated end, usually called the posterior end, is the deeply\r\n  stained blepharoplast. Adjoining this is a vacuole and, taking\r\n  origin from this part of the trypanosome, is the flagellum. This\r\n  borders an undulating membrane attached to the body and then,\r\n  carried along to the other extremity, projects free as a long,\r\n  whip-like flagellum.\r\n\r\n  In fresh preparations the body of the trypanosome progresses in the\r\n  direction of its flagellated end, although occasionally it will be\r\n  observed to move in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nSome trypanosomes show granules at certain stages and it has been\r\nobserved that the extrusion of these granules precedes disintegration\r\nof the trypanosome. It has been suggested that such granules might\r\nbe infective, explaining the infectivity of blood from which\r\ntrypanosomes were absent. In the separation of trypanosomes into\r\ngroups and species Bruce relies upon morphology, action on animals,\r\nand manner of development in the tsetse fly. He does not consider\r\nserum diagnosis and cross inoculation methods as reliable for\r\ndifferentiation. The human trypanosomes are polymorphic.\r\n\r\n  _T. gambiense_ varies much in length and breadth. The normal\r\n  type, as found in the blood, varies from 14 to 20 microns, while\r\n  longer forms, 20 to 24 microns, are growth ones and, in the\r\n  longest ones (23 to 33 microns), we have those preparing to divide\r\n  longitudinally. The normal short forms are the ones from which\r\n  the development takes place in the tsetse fly. In width these\r\n  flagellates are from 1.5 to 2 microns. The blepharoplast is oval\r\n  and the nucleus situated about the center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—_Glossina palpalis_ in natural resting\r\nposition and with wings outstretched. (MacNeal after Doflein.)]\r\n\r\nWith _T. rhodesiense_ the nucleus is typically located almost\r\nadjacent to the blepharoplast. As a matter of fact it may require\r\nthe passage of this trypanosome through rats to bring out these\r\n“posterior nuclear forms,” the nuclear location being at times almost\r\nentirely that of _T. gambiense_. In addition to the characteristic\r\nof nucleus being near the blepharoplast, this trypanosome is more\r\nvirulent for laboratory animals than _T. gambiense_, agreeing in this\r\nrespect with the more severe clinical course in man.\r\n\r\n  When the tsetse fly, _Glossina palpalis_, feeds on a man in whose\r\n  peripheral circulation there are normal type trypanosomes we\r\n  have an accumulation of such forms in the middle and posterior\r\n  portions of the gut. From the eighth to the eighteenth day long,\r\n  slender forms develop and pass forward into the proventriculus.\r\n  None of the intestinal forms can cause infection when injected\r\n  into animals. These proventricular types work their way into the\r\n  salivary ducts and thence into the salivary glands, where further\r\n  development takes place. Here we have shorter forms developing,\r\n  which are similar in morphology to the normal blood type. It is at\r\n  this stage that the fly becomes infective by the passing of these\r\n  trypanosomes down the salivary ducts and through the channel in the\r\n  hypopharynx to the subcutaneous tissues of the person bitten. High\r\n  temperatures, 75 to 85°F., are favorable to development, while low\r\n  temperatures, 60 to 70°F., are inimical to development, but do not\r\n  kill the ingested trypanosomes. This explains the long period which\r\n  at times elapses before a fly becomes infective. Under favorable\r\n  conditions a fly becomes infective in twenty to thirty-four days\r\n  and remains infective the rest of its life, up to 185 days. The\r\n  infection is not transmitted to the pupa. This is an inoculative,\r\n  cyclical or indirect type of infection. It is usually considered\r\n  that a tsetse fly whose proboscis has just been contaminated with\r\n  trypanosome blood is capable of transferring the infection for a\r\n  few hours. This would be a mechanical or direct method of infection\r\n  and such power for infection only lasts for a few hours.\r\n\r\n  There are other groups of trypanosomes, not important for man,\r\n  in which the cyclical development does not include the salivary\r\n  glands. In the _T. pecorum_ group of small monomorphic trypanosomes\r\n  development takes place only in intestines and proboscis, while in\r\n  the _T. vivax_ group this occurs in the proboscis alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—_Glossina morsitans_ before and after\r\nfeeding. Lateral view. (From Doflein after Austin.) MacNeal.]\r\n\r\nWhen tsetse flies feed on animals infected with trypanosomes only\r\nfrom 2 to 6% become infective. Again, it has been shown that where\r\nthe wild animals on which tsetse flies feed may show an infection\r\nof from 16 to 50% yet not more than 2 out of every 1000 tsetse\r\nflies, caught and tried out on susceptible animals, show themselves\r\ninfective.\r\n\r\n  Both of the human trypanosomes of Africa have been cultured by\r\n  using the N.N.N. medium in which rat’s blood was substituted for\r\n  that of the rabbit. Human blood will also serve as a substitute.\r\n  Growth however is not constant.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—Practically the only method of transmission of the\r\ndisease is by the bite of infected tsetse flies. The female gives\r\nbirth to a single, yellowish brown, motile larva, which is almost as\r\nlarge as the mother and which, upon reaching the ground, bores its\r\nway into a coarse, sandy soil for a depth of about two inches and\r\nthen becomes a pupa. The larval stage in the mother lasts about two\r\nweeks and the pupal stage about a month.\r\n\r\n  The tsetse fly is much like _Stomoxys_, but has a branching of\r\n  the feathering of the arista, long palps, a bulb to the proboscis\r\n  and a characteristic upbending of the fourth longitudinal vein\r\n  to meet the mid-cross vein. The female deposits her larva near a\r\n  shady place upon loose, dry, sandy soil. Moisture and sunlight are\r\n  not favorable for pupal development, the sun being particularly\r\n  injurious, so that pupae, buried only an inch deep and away from\r\n  shade, are killed. This fact has been utilized in prophylaxis by\r\n  cutting down the trees. The trouble is that the bush growth which\r\n  soon follows is favorable as providing shade for the pupae.\r\n\r\n  Male and female flies bite and transmit the disease. They bite in\r\n  the daytime, usually from 9 A.M., to 4 P.M., and will bite in the\r\n  sunlight.\r\n\r\n  It has been stated that tsetse flies are attracted by persons\r\n  wearing khaki clothing.\r\n\r\nWith a view to eradication of the disease certain areas have been\r\ndepopulated, but upon examining the flies caught in the district a\r\nyear or more later, infected flies have been obtained. This would\r\nindicate some other reservoir than man. It is now generally conceded\r\nthat the trypanosome strain in the antelope is the same as _T.\r\nrhodesiense_, both being transmitted by _G. morsitans_.\r\n\r\n  Taute, however, believes them different as he not only injected\r\n  blood containing such trypanosomes into himself, with negative\r\n  result, but also allowed flies which had fed on antelopes, which\r\n  were infective for laboratory animals, to feed on himself, likewise\r\n  with negative result. It is a well-known fact that men in good\r\n  condition are refractory to trypanosome infection so that this\r\n  courageous experiment does not prove the antelope strain to be\r\n  different from the human one.\r\n\r\n  One measure that has been proposed is to kill off the big game from\r\n  a certain area with a view to depriving the flies of their main\r\n  source of infection.\r\n\r\n  The probabilities of an animal reservoir for _T. gambiense_ however\r\n  is not so well settled. Many think that we may have trypanosome\r\n  carriers and that such persons in the enjoyment of health may act\r\n  as reservoirs of the virus. Koch suggested that crocodiles were\r\n  important factors in the life of the tsetse flies and recommended\r\n  the destruction of the crocodile eggs.\r\n\r\nKoch noted the infection of 15 women in a fly-free district and\r\nconsidered their infection as coming from sexual intercourse with\r\ntheir husbands, who had returned home from fly districts where they\r\nhad contracted trypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\n  This same method of infection of prostitutes has quite recently\r\n  been brought to notice by Bernard.\r\n\r\n  It will be remembered that dourine, a trypanosome disease of\r\n  horses, caused by _T. equiperdum_, is transmitted by the sexual act.\r\n\r\n  All observations however indicate that the spread of the disease is\r\n  almost exclusively through the medium of the tsetse fly. Professor\r\n  Lanfranchini was infected in his laboratory by a strain which was\r\n  supposed to be _Trypanosoma brucei_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe chief pathological findings are the enlargements of the lymphatic\r\nglands. The dura mater may be adherent in places and the pia mater\r\nmay show areas of thickening. The cerebro-spinal fluid is increased\r\nin amount. The pathological process is a chronic polyadenitis which\r\nis followed by a chronic inflammation of lymphatics of brain and\r\nspinal cord.\r\n\r\n  We have a meningo-encephalitis in which the most characteristic\r\n  feature microscopically is a widespread perivascular infiltration\r\n  of small round cells surrounding the vessels of the pia-arachnoid\r\n  of both brain and cord. The process is most marked about vessels\r\n  of pons and medulla. The nerve cells are but little affected other\r\n  than those of the bulbar nuclei.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Temperature chart of trypanosome fever.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n_The Period of Invasion._—After an incubation period which may be\r\nas short as ten or twelve days, following the bite of an infective\r\ntsetse fly, the trypanosomes may be found in the blood or in gland\r\njuice. One case has been reported where an official of the Belgian\r\nCongo showed trypanosomes less than four weeks after his arrival in\r\nthe colony. His first symptoms were noted about ten days after his\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n  In natives, trypanosomes may be present in the blood for long\r\n  periods of time during which they may do heavy work; thus 7 of\r\n  Koch’s 52 native porters showed trypanosomes. In Europeans however\r\n  the course of the disease is rarely so insidious but rapidly enters\r\n  upon the stage of trypanosome fever.\r\n\r\n_The Stage of Trypanosome Fever._—Although fever may be absent in\r\nnatives until the onset of the period of sleeping sickness, yet in\r\nEuropeans there are usually noted febrile paroxysms, lasting for a\r\nfew days, and followed, by afebrile periods varying from a few days\r\nto two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n  The temperature curve is of a markedly remittent type, approaching\r\n  normal in the morning and going up to 103°F. or higher in the\r\n  evening—a wide daily range. Very characteristic is a low-tension\r\n  rapid pulse which often is as rapid when the temperature\r\n  approximates the normal as when it is higher. Early in the disease\r\n  there are evidences of involvement of the nervous system, as shown\r\n  by headache insomnia, difficulty of concentration for mental work\r\n  and cardiac instability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Rash of human trypanosomiasis. (Photo: R.\r\nMcKay.) By permission from Manson’s Tropical Diseases.]\r\n\r\n_Winterbottom Sign._—Very important are the glandular enlargements,\r\nparticularly of the glands of the posterior cervical triangle\r\n(Winterbottom’s sign), which upon puncture may show trypanosomes when\r\nthe blood examination fails to reveal them. The glands are discrete,\r\nsoft, usually painless and may show but very slight enlargement.\r\nOedematous swellings, especially about the eyes or joints or in\r\nlocalized areas upon the trunk, may be rather prominent in some\r\ncases. In Europeans pinkish erythematous rings appearing early in\r\nthe infection may make one think of syphilis. These erythematous\r\npatches are not visible on the skin of natives. A dryness of the skin\r\nis rather constant and, especially in natives, papules which itch\r\ngreatly may be present. Rarely such manifestations as orchitis or\r\nchoroiditis may be observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—Swelling of the glands of the posterior\r\ncervical triangle—Winterbottom’s sign. (Ruge and zur Verth after\r\nKoch.)]\r\n\r\n  _Kérandel Sign._—Recently great prominence has been given to a\r\n  deep hyperaesthesia, which shows itself as a lively pain, often\r\n  retarded, after some slight blow upon a bony projection of the\r\n  body. Kérandel, who suffered from trypanosomiasis, noted that\r\n  the fear of striking against objects became with him an absolute\r\n  obsession. It is called the Kérandel sign. It is during this first\r\n  stage, when the trypanosomes are to be found only in the blood or\r\n  gland juice that the disease would appear to be curable. Upon the\r\n  appearance of the trypanosomes in the cerebro-spinal fluid (second\r\n  stage) we have practically a hopeless prognosis.\r\n\r\n  There may be a latent period of several months in which health\r\n  seems normal, to be followed by the sleeping-sickness stage. It has\r\n  also been noted that untreated cases, as well as those receiving\r\n  more or less treatment, may remain in good health for periods up to\r\n  several years. There is therefore reason to believe that certain\r\n  cases may not enter upon the sleeping sickness stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—Cases of trypanosomiasis showing the edema\r\nespecially about eyes. (Ruge and zur Verth after Koch.)]\r\n\r\n_The Stage of Sleeping Sickness._—In this stage the mentality\r\nbecomes more weakened. The native from being happy and willing to\r\nwork becomes morose and apathetic. This change of disposition is\r\nfrequently the first thing to be noted in a patient by his family.\r\nThere is a tendency to gaze into the distance. The speech is rather\r\nlow and tremulous like that of a tired, sleepy child. The tongue\r\nespecially shows a decided tremor which may also be present in the\r\nlips and hands.\r\n\r\n  The gait is one of weakness and apathy—a shuffling gait. The\r\n  reflexes may be exaggerated. Romberg’s sign may be present but\r\n  the Argyll-Robertson pupil has not been noted. There may be an\r\n  alternation of periods of crying and laughing which with the\r\n  occasional exhibition of intention tremor and rarely nystagmus may\r\n  make one think of multiple sclerosis. The patient tends to sleep\r\n  even when lying in a bright sunlight. Again he may go to sleep\r\n  with a morsel of food in his mouth. Notwithstanding the apparent\r\n  stupid state of the patient, he will, when aroused, answer fairly\r\n  intelligently but with apathy and retardation. The hebephrenic and\r\n  catatonic manifestations of dementia praecox may be exhibited in\r\n  some cases.\r\n\r\n  Finally the patient becomes weaker and more emaciated. The pulse\r\n  becomes rapid and feeble, the blood pressure being extremely low.\r\n  The mouth becomes dry, the teeth covered with sordes and bed sores\r\n  develop. There may be convulsions. The coma and general weakness\r\n  become more marked and the patient dies. Frequently terminal\r\n  pneumonias or dysenteries bring about the end.\r\n\r\n  The sleeping sickness stage rarely lasts longer than a year and\r\n  even with treatment not more than two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Symptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—Headache and lack of mental concentration\r\n  may be early features of the disease. Deep hyperaesthesia, or\r\n  Kérandel’s sign, often present. Patients tend to be morose and\r\n  apathetic. Tremor of tongue and lips are rather constant signs\r\n  about the commencement of the stage of sleeping sickness. Early\r\n  insomnia gives way to the drowsiness that characterizes the second\r\n  stage. There is very little disturbance of sensory or motor\r\n  functions until near the end. Epileptiform convulsions may be late\r\n  manifestations. Coma deepens as the end approaches.\r\n\r\n  _The Temperature Curve._—The febrile paroxysms, which may not be\r\n  present in natives until the sleeping-sickness stage, show great\r\n  irregularity of course and a marked remission in the morning. The\r\n  fever may be absent for several weeks to return later. Trypanosomes\r\n  are more apt to be present in the peripheral circulation during the\r\n  fever than when the temperature is normal.\r\n\r\n  _The Circulatory System._—The pulse tends to run from 90 to 120\r\n  beats per minute and is fast even without fever. The tension is\r\n  low and the systolic pressure tends to be extremely low during the\r\n  later stages of the disease.\r\n\r\n  _The Lymphatic System._—Most important in diagnosis is the\r\n  enlargement of the lymphatic glands, especially those of the\r\n  posterior cervical triangle (Winterbottom’s sign). Other enlarged\r\n  glands may be the supraclavicular, epitrochlear and axillary\r\n  glands. The inguinal glands suffer enlargements so frequently\r\n  as the results of wounds and infections of the foot that their\r\n  enlargement is of less diagnostic value. The natives of certain\r\n  parts of Africa not only attach great diagnostic importance to\r\n  gland enlargement but they imagine they cure the disease by\r\n  removing the glands with various primitive cutting tools. The\r\n  glands are not painful, do not become matted together and rarely\r\n  suppurate. Our best means of diagnosing trypanosomiasis is by\r\n  withdrawing gland juice with a syringe and examining the smears.\r\n\r\n  _The Skin._—Erythematous areas may be present in Europeans.\r\n  Localized oedemas are rather marked features. The skin may be very\r\n  dry and itch markedly.\r\n\r\n  _Other Manifestations._—The spleen may be enlarged, the\r\n  respirations may be more rapid than normal and the blood show a\r\n  secondary anaemia. In a blood examination the large mononuclears\r\n  show an increase with a normal white count.\r\n\r\n  The eye may show keratitis or irido-cyclitis in trypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\n  Trypanosomiasis seems to favor abortion and still-births, in this\r\n  respect resembling syphilis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIn making a survey of a native population Schwetz considers gland\r\npalpation as almost as reliable as gland puncture and of course more\r\nexpeditious. The typical gland should be large and soft or elastic\r\nalthough he admits trypanosomes may be found in small hard glands.\r\n\r\nWhen the glandular enlargement is distinct, with the erythema and\r\nheadache, there is much that suggests syphilis. Another point of\r\nconfusion is that positive Wassermann tests are often obtained in\r\nsleeping sickness.\r\n\r\n  The increase in large mononuclears goes with malaria, kala-azar and\r\n  syphilis as well as with trypanosomiasis so that such findings are\r\n  of little assistance in differential diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  An early history of attacks of fever, with marked fluctuation of\r\n  temperature, associated with rapid pulse, even with the apyrexial\r\n  morning fall, is suggestive. Then with the glandular enlargements\r\n  we think immediately of laboratory examinations. As with pellagra\r\n  the history is very important in the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\n_For the laboratory diagnosis_ we may use peripheral blood with\r\nsome thick film method. The examination of preparations from the\r\nperipheral blood is usually very discouraging. Very much better\r\nresults (in fact some prefer this method to any other) can be\r\nobtained by taking 10 to 20 cc. of blood in about 25 cc. of citrated\r\nsalt solution, centrifuging 2 or 3 times and examining the sediment\r\nof the third centrifugalization. Dutton and Todd prefer to centrifuge\r\ncitrated blood and to collect the leucocyte layer for examination as\r\nis done in opsonic work.\r\n\r\n  _Gland Puncture._—The English workers usually prefer the gland\r\n  puncture method, using a sterile but dry hypodermic needle. Water\r\n  in the needle distorts both leishman bodies and trypanosomes.\r\n\r\n  In the sleeping-sickness stage trypanosomes can almost constantly\r\n  be found in the cerebro-spinal fluid.\r\n\r\n  In a diagnostic study of 336 cases Broden obtained 87% of positives\r\n  from gland puncture, 80% from centrifugalizing the supernatant\r\n  fluid left from the second centrifugalization of the blood and 4.5%\r\n  from spinal fluid examinations.\r\n\r\n  Some prefer to inoculate susceptible animals, particularly the\r\n  guinea pig or monkey, with blood or gland juice from the suspected\r\n  case. A very satisfactory material is an emulsion from an excised\r\n  gland which may be inoculated intraperitoneally into white rats.\r\n  The further course, after animal inoculation, is the examination of\r\n  the blood of these animals for trypanosomes. Usually at the time\r\n  the guinea pigs die we find numerous trypanosomes.\r\n\r\n  Other tests are: (1) Trypanolysis, when unheated suspected serum\r\n  and trypanosomes are incubated together for one hour. Normal serum\r\n  may occasionally cause disintegration and treated cases give it in\r\n  only about 45% of cases. Unfavorable untreated cases give it in\r\n  about 80% of cases.\r\n\r\n  (2) The so-called auto-agglutination test is not of much value.\r\n  In this the red cells of the blood of a trypanosomiasis case come\r\n  together in clumps when one makes a wet preparation. It is not\r\n  a rouleaux formation. (3) The attachment test is made by making\r\n  a mixture of inactivated serum, leucocytes and trypanosomes and\r\n  allowing them to be in contact for 20 minutes. A positive test\r\n  shows attachment of the trypanosomes to the leucocytes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIf the patient cannot be removed from the infected district or cannot\r\nreceive the atoxyl or atoxyl-tartar-emetic treatment the prognosis is\r\nalmost surely that of a prolonged but fatal end.\r\n\r\n  There is very little hope of cure if the disease has gone on to the\r\n  sleeping-sickness stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The question of depopulation of districts and\r\ndestruction of the big game therein, when the area is infected with\r\n_Glossina palpalis_, has been fully considered under epidemiology.\r\n\r\n  Isolation, in the fly-free districts, of infected natives has\r\n  not proven a very practical measure but that of rendering their\r\n  peripheral blood free of trypanosomes by atoxyl injections would\r\n  seem more desirable. In this we aim to cure the patient as well as\r\n  render him safe to others.\r\n\r\n  The most practical measure is that employed in Uganda of clearing\r\n  the plant and tree growth for at least fifteen feet from the\r\n  streams of water, it having been noted that the tsetse flies\r\n  confine themselves to a narrow strip not more than fifteen feet\r\n  from the water’s edge. The tsetse fly requires considerable\r\n  moisture for its existence.\r\n\r\n  The catching of flies in traps or with a sticky lime does not offer\r\n  much encouragement.\r\n\r\nAs regards personal prophylaxis, white clothes are to be worn as the\r\ntsetse fly, along with mosquitoes, prefers dark-colored garments.\r\nThe legs should be protected by leggings and possibly one could\r\nconsider the wearing of gloves or veils. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, the heat of the tropics precludes these latter measures. As\r\nthe fly only bites in the daytime one should choose the night for\r\ngoing about, if practicable.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—The general opinion is that trypanosomiasis is only\r\ncurable at a time prior to the appearance of trypanosomes in the\r\ncerebro-spinal fluid. Consequently, the stage of sleeping sickness\r\noffers little chance of cure by treatment.\r\n\r\n  Such cases have been treated with injections of 10 cc. of 1 to 1000\r\n  solution of neosalvarsan into the spinal canal, after withdrawing\r\n  about 15 cc. of spinal fluid, but without appreciable curative\r\n  effect. On the assumption that trypanosomes invading the central\r\n  nervous system are protected from drug action, Marshall proposed\r\n  the injection of salvarsanized serum intrathecally. Three hours\r\n  after the administration of 0.6 gm. of salvarsan enough blood is\r\n  withdrawn from a vein to give about 20 cc. of serum. Following\r\n  the withdrawal of a slightly greater amount of cerebro-spinal\r\n  fluid from 5 to 20 cc. of the serum is injected in its place.\r\n  Yorke in a critical article on the claims for this treatment is\r\n  of the opinion that there is no satisfactory evidence that such\r\n  a method sterilizes the infected cerebro-spinal fluid. He cites\r\n  cases where the trypanosomes disappeared from the spinal fluid\r\n  after ordinary treatment and where cases lived for extended periods\r\n  after trypanosomes were found in their spinal fluid. Corbus\r\n  and associates have described a new method of obtaining a high\r\n  medicinal content in the cerebro-spinal fluids. Their work was done\r\n  with neo-arsphenamine, but there seems to be no reason why other\r\n  drugs may not be similarly administered.\r\n\r\n  The basis of the method is the observation that hypertonic salt\r\n  solution, injected intravenously, will dehydrate the central\r\n  nervous system, and that restoration of fluid begins at about\r\n  the sixth hour. If a drug is injected into the circulation just\r\n  at the time when the restorative formation of spinal fluid is\r\n  taking place, it appears that a large quantity is carried into the\r\n  subarachnoid spaces with the fluid, as on a flood tide.\r\n\r\n  Method:\r\n\r\n  1. 8 A.M. Patient is put to bed.\r\n\r\n  2. 10 A.M. Intravenous injection of 100 cc. of 15% saline, warmed\r\n  and administered slowly by gravity. The symptoms produced by this\r\n  injection are mild and transitory.\r\n\r\n  3. No food is permitted at midday.\r\n\r\n  4. 4 P.M. Neo-arsphenamine is injected with the usual technic.\r\n\r\n  5. 8 P.M. Light nourishment is allowed. Patient is kept under\r\n  observation, preferably in bed, for the ensuing thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\n  _Atoxyl._—The first drug to offer hope of cure was sodium\r\n  arsanilate, atoxyl, which contains about 26% of As. This is best\r\n  given in doses of about 0.5 gram (7½ gr.) in about 15 cc. of\r\n  sterile distilled water intramuscularly. Several cases of optic\r\n  neuritis were reported but the drug is still a standard treatment.\r\n  We give the atoxyl at intervals of five days, Manson gives 3 grains\r\n  every third day.\r\n\r\nProbably the best treatment is one in which three doses of atoxyl\r\nare followed by from 10 to 15 daily or every other day injections\r\nof 0.1 gram (1½ gr.) of tartar emetic. The course is repeated after\r\nan interval of three weeks. It is advisable to give a hypodermic of\r\ncaffein a few minutes before the tartar emetic to lessen depression.\r\nKérandel received the atoxyl-tartar-emetic double treatment and\r\nascribed his cure to the tartar emetic. Tartar emetic is also given\r\nintravenously, 0.1 gram in 150 cc. water.\r\n\r\n  Intravenous injection of arsenophenylglycin, in doses of about\r\n  1.0 gram. (15 gr.) intravenously has been highly recommended.\r\n  Recent reports from German East Africa state that of 35 treated\r\n  with this drug six died of the effects of the drug. Salvarsan and\r\n  neosalvarsan have been used but apparently without particular\r\n  success.\r\n\r\n  A combination of treatments in which salvarsan, sodium salicylate\r\n  and ethyl-hydrocuprein (a quinine derivative) have been used has\r\n  been favorably reported by Morganroth where the action of a single\r\n  drug was of little value.\r\n\r\n  Very remarkable claims in experimental animals have been made for\r\n  “trixidin,” a preparation of antimony trioxide which is given\r\n  intramuscularly. Even inunctions with this preparation have been\r\n  quite successful in curing infected mice. In larger animals abscess\r\n  formation is an objection.\r\n\r\n  Daniels has reported good results from the injection of oxide of\r\n  antimony. The preparation used is Martindale’s injectio antimonii\r\n  oxidi given subcutaneously in 30 minim doses (1/20 grain of the\r\n  oxide). Masters gives this preparation intramuscularly and notes\r\n  its greater efficiency than any other drug or combination of drugs.\r\n  He gives 3/100 grain every other day until 40/100 grain has been\r\n  given. If trypanosomes continue present he gives a .77 gram dose\r\n  of soamin. Soamin is a drug similar to atoxyl but said to be less\r\n  toxic.\r\n\r\n  In the treatment of 18 cases of _T. rhodesiense_ infections Newham\r\n  notes that tartar emetic alone was as effective as the combined\r\n  treatment with atoxyl. He gave the tartar emetic injections twice\r\n  weekly intravenously commencing with 1 grain and going up to 3\r\n  grains. An organic antimony preparation, “Stibenyl,” has been\r\n  recommended. See kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  Very favorable reports have been made from the use of galyl and\r\n  ludyl, arsenical compounds.\r\n\r\n  A drug which is reported to have exceptional trypanocidal effect\r\n  on animals infected with both human trypanosomes is “Bayer 205.”\r\n  Dogs infected with the dourine parasite and showing oedema\r\n  and eye symptoms have been cured by the injection of the drug\r\n  intravenously. A dose of 0.5 mg. causes disappearance of parasites\r\n  in mice. It is stated that the drug produces a protection against\r\n  reinfection which lasts for months.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAZILIAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS\r\n\r\n=General Considerations.=—In 1909, Chagas reported the finding\r\nof a flagellate in the intestines of _Conorhinus megistus_ or,\r\nmore properly, _Lamus megistus_. He was also able to transmit the\r\nflagellate to laboratory animals and could culture it on blood agar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—_Schizotrypanum cruzi_ in blood of child\r\nwith acute type of Brazilian trypanosomiasis. (MacNeal from Doflein\r\nafter Chagas.)]\r\n\r\nIn investigating the matter of the importance of this flagellate,\r\n_Schizotrypanum cruzi_, in Minas Geraes, Brazil, where the\r\nabove-named bug was present in great numbers in the cracks of the\r\nhouses of the poor he associated this flagellate infection, which he\r\nat first considered trypanosomal, with a disease of the children of\r\nthat section.\r\n\r\n  The bug is a vicious feeder and, from its biting chiefly about the\r\n  face, has been called barbeiro or barber by the natives. Both the\r\n  male and female of _Lamus_ bite and can transmit the disease and\r\n  although the parasite is not transmitted hereditarily the nymph is\r\n  capable of sucking blood and becoming infected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—_Conorhinus megistus_, the insect carrier of\r\n_Schizotrypanum cruzi_. (From Doflein after Chagas.)]\r\n\r\n  It requires several months for the insect to go through the egg,\r\n  larval and pupal stage to maturity. Some consider this bug to\r\n  belong to the genus _Triatoma_. The insects may live for more than\r\n  a year and tend to remain in the same house where they may have\r\n  become infected but leave such house if it be abandoned by man.\r\n  Brumpt thinks that the bedbug may also transmit the disease. A\r\n  large proportion of armadillos in the endemic areas are infected\r\n  with _S. cruzi_ but do not seem to be affected thereby. It has been\r\n  suggested that this animal may be a reservoir of virus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—_Schizotrypanum cruzi_ developing in the\r\ntissues of the guinea pig. 1. Cross-section of a striated muscle\r\nfibre containing _Schizotrypanum cruzi_: Note dividing forms. 2.\r\nSection of brain showing a _Schizotrypanum_ cyst within a neuroglia\r\ncell, containing chiefly flagellated forms. 3. Section through the\r\nsupra-renal capsule, fascicular zone. 4. Section of brain showing a\r\nneuroglia cell filled with round forms of _Schizotrypanum_. (From\r\nLow, in Sleeping Sickness Bulletin, after Vianna.)]\r\n\r\n_S. cruzi_ is found in the blood of children during the acute febrile\r\nstage but at other times in children, and as a rule in adults, it is\r\nrarely present in the peripheral blood. The early blood forms are\r\nnarrow and very motile. They increase in size and slacken in motility\r\nwhen they become about 20 microns long. _S. cruzi_ is characterized\r\nby a very large blepharoplast. Dividing forms are never seen in the\r\nblood. The common site of multiplication is in the cells of the\r\nvoluntary muscles and heart and also in the cells of the central\r\nnervous system, adrenals, and bone marrow. In these tissues the\r\nflagellate takes on a rounded form and undergoes binary division.\r\nContinued division converts the infected cell into a cyst. It is this\r\nprocess going on in various important structures that accounts for\r\nthe extreme variation in symptomatology and pathology.\r\n\r\n  Chagas thinks that the gametes for the cycle in _Lamus_ arise\r\n  from parasites developing in the lungs of the vertebrate host.\r\n  Flagellated parasites enter the lungs, lose the flagellum and\r\n  become oval in shape, later on dividing into 8 parts. These assume\r\n  an elongated form and enter the red cells of the host. Against this\r\n  is the statement of various observers that the flagellates are only\r\n  to be found free in the plasma, never within red cells. The forms\r\n  taken up by _Lamus_ multiply in the intestine and then pass to the\r\n  salivary glands after about 8 days. The bug is then infectious when\r\n  it bites. Brumpt notes that infection may occur from inoculation of\r\n  the faeces passed by the bug, especially through the conjunctiva.\r\n\r\n=Symptomatology.= _Acute types._—This form of the disease usually\r\noccurs in children under one year of age. The period of incubation is\r\nabout ten days. It is attended by a high continued fever which may\r\nshow a slight morning drop. There is marked puffiness of the face and\r\nenlargement of the thyroid. The lymphatic glands and spleen are also\r\nenlarged. The case may give the picture of a meningitis in which form\r\nthe disease is exceedingly fatal. During the febrile period parasites\r\nare to be found in the blood but in the afebrile intervals which\r\nalternate with the febrile ones parasites are not present.\r\n\r\n_Chronic Types._—The type of the disease as seen in adults is\r\nmainly chronic. They often show enlargement of the thyroid and\r\nmanifestations of myxoedema. The lymphatic glands are enlarged. Where\r\nthe adrenal is attacked we have the syndrome of Addison’s disease.\r\n\r\nIn the cardiac types there are present various forms of cardiac\r\nirregularities.\r\n\r\nIn the cerebral types various neurological manifestations may be\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n  An irregular fever may accompany the signs of involvement of the\r\n  various important organs.\r\n\r\n  The disease is attended by a marked anaemia.\r\n\r\n=Diagnosis.=—In the laboratory diagnosis of those cases not showing\r\nthe flagellates in the blood the usual method is to inoculate a\r\nguinea pig with the blood and in about two weeks _S. cruzi_ may be\r\nfound in the blood of the animal. The parasites may not appear,\r\nhowever, in the blood, when one should resort to culturing the guinea\r\npig’s blood or more surely examine sections of muscle of the animal\r\nfor the forms in the muscle cells undergoing binary division.\r\n\r\n  Brumpt has recently advocated the xenodiagnostic method. Thus, in a\r\n  number of guinea pigs infected with _S. cruzi_, parasites could not\r\n  be found, but by having third stage larvae of _Conorhinus_ feed on\r\n  these animals the parasites developed in the bugs. He regards the\r\n  alimentary tract of these bugs as a most favorable culture medium.\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis and Treatment.=—Other than destroying the bugs by\r\nsulphur fumigation or whitewashing there is little to note. The bugs\r\nshow a liking for leather articles, as old harness.\r\n\r\n  The same plan of treatment as for African trypanosomiasis may be\r\n  tried but such treatment is not effective with infected animals.\r\n\r\n  In the myxoedema types thyroid extract is indicated.\r\n\r\n  NOTE: Escomel has reported the finding of a trypanosome 20 to 40\r\n  microns by 3 to 4 microns which had a flagellum as long as the\r\n  body and with a very small but distinct blepharoplast (unlike _S.\r\n  cruzi_) in the blood of a native of Peru. The patient at the time\r\n  of the blood examination was afebrile and showed a generalized firm\r\n  oedema. There was noted anaemia, prostration and somnolence. This\r\n  may be a new species.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYPANOSOMIASES OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n  =Trypanosoma brucei.=—This trypanosome causes a surely fatal\r\n  disease in horses and one from which few cattle recover. It is\r\n  called “nagana” or the fly disease, from being transmitted by\r\n  the tsetse fly, _Glossina morsitans_. All animals except man and\r\n  possibly the goat seem susceptible. The disease is characterized\r\n  by fever, oedematous areas about neck, abdomen and extremities,\r\n  progressive anaemia and emaciation. It is an important disease of\r\n  domesticated animals of many parts of Africa.\r\n\r\n  =Trypanosoma evansi.=—This is the cause of a very fatal disease\r\n  of horses in India and the Orient and known as “surra.” It also\r\n  affects camels and even cattle. It is thought to be transmitted\r\n  by biting flies (_Stomoxys_). The symptoms are fever, emaciation,\r\n  oedematous areas and great muscular weakness.\r\n\r\n  =Trypanosoma equinum.=—This trypanosome causes a fatal disease in\r\n  horses in South America. There is paralysis of the hind quarters of\r\n  the horse which gives the disease the name “mal de caderas.”\r\n\r\n  =Trypanosoma equiperdum.=—This trypanosome causes a disease of\r\n  horses in many parts of the world. It is known as “dourine” and is\r\n  transmitted by coitus. The genital organs show marked oedema which\r\n  is followed by anaemia and paralysis.\r\n\r\n  =Trypanosoma dimorphon.=—This trypanosome causes a disease of\r\n  horses in Gambia. It is also found in horses and cattle in other\r\n  parts of Africa. The parasite shows marked variation in morphology.\r\n\r\n  =Trypanosoma lewisi.=—Rats in many parts of the world show this\r\n  infection which is rarely fatal to them. It is transmitted by the\r\n  rat flea by a process of regurgitation. It can also be transmitted\r\n  by the rat louse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TROPICAL RELAPSING FEVERS\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—There is a group of tropical fevers more or less\r\nidentical clinically with European relapsing fever and caused by\r\nspirochaetes closely allied to _Spironema recurrentis (Spirillum\r\nobermeieri)_. It seems probable that the relapsing fevers of East\r\nand West Africa are caused by a single species, _S. duttoni_, which\r\nis transmitted by a tick, _Ornithodoros moubata_, while that of\r\nNorthern Africa is caused by another species, _S. berbera_, which\r\nis transmitted by lice, either _Pediculus vestimenti_ or _Pediculus\r\ncapitis_. Another species of spirochaete, _S. carteri_, is supposed\r\nto cause the relapsing fever of India and it seems probable that its\r\ntransmission is brought about by infected lice.\r\n\r\n  Besides the above species of spirochaetes others have been\r\n  reported, as _S. novyi_ for American and _S. persica_ for Persian\r\n  relapsing fever. The view taken by Nuttall, that these various\r\n  names may be of convenience in the study of relapsing fevers but\r\n  that there is no adequate morphological difference to justify them\r\n  as species, seems worthy of acceptance. It has been shown that the\r\n  separation of these spirochaetes on the basis of susceptibility\r\n  of laboratory animals and cross immunity reactions is untenable.\r\n  Agglutination of certain strains by their specific sera, however,\r\n  is a reliable means of separation. As with European relapsing\r\n  fever, these fevers are characterized by a sudden onset, intense\r\n  frontal headache, and pain of back and limbs. This fever remains\r\n  high for three to five days and falls by crisis, to be succeeded\r\n  by an apyrexial interval of approximately one week. There may be\r\n  several of these alternating febrile and afebrile periods. The\r\n  spirochaetes are in the peripheral circulation during the febrile\r\n  period but not in the afebrile one. The spleen is enlarged and\r\n  tender. Cases showing jaundice seem more grave.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Febris recurrens. Tick fever. French: Typhus recurrent.\r\nGerman: Rückfallfieber.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—Although Hippocrates described the clinical features of\r\n  relapsing fever quite accurately this knowledge seems to have been\r\n  lost until about the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n  The causative spirochaetes were first seen by Obermeier in the\r\n  blood of a patient in 1868 but he did not publish his discovery\r\n  until 1873.\r\n\r\n  Ross and Milne, in 1904, found that African tick fever was a\r\n  spirillar fever while Dutton and Todd established the fact of its\r\n  transmission by ticks.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Relapsing fever was epidemic in the\r\n  U. S. in 1869, since which time it has not reappeared. There have\r\n  been many epidemics in Ireland, Russia, Turkey and other parts\r\n  of Europe. It was a disease of importance during the Balkan War\r\n  of 1912-1913. China and India have frequently been visited by\r\n  epidemics as well as the Philippine Islands and the Dutch East\r\n  Indies. Uganda, Congo State and German East Africa, as well as\r\n  Egypt and Algeria, are important centers. There is also a relapsing\r\n  fever of Colombia and Central America.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—Relapsing fevers are caused by organisms generally\r\nconsidered as protozoal in their nature and belonging to the\r\nflagellates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—Spirochaetes of relapsing fever from blood\r\nof man. (Kolle and Wassermann.)]\r\n\r\n  _Transmission by the tick._—The generic name _Spiroschaudinnia_\r\n  is preferred by some to the more commonly accepted _Spirochaeta_.\r\n  Recently, authorities give these organisms the name _Spironema_.\r\n  East and West African relapsing fever, or tick fever, is caused\r\n  by _Spironema duttoni_ and the transmission is through the bite\r\n  of an argasine tick, _Ornithodoros moubata_. Not only does the\r\n  tick itself become infected by the taking in of blood-containing\r\n  spirochaetes but likewise transmits the infection to its progeny.\r\n  Leishman considers that when the spirochaetes are taken into\r\n  the alimentary tract of the tick there is a breaking up of the\r\n  spirochaetes into small granules which reach the Malpighian\r\n  tubules. They also invade the ovary and the ova. It was thought\r\n  that these granules were the infecting agents and that they were\r\n  excreted in the fluid of the coxal glands or passed out with the\r\n  faeces. More recently it has been claimed that these granules have\r\n  no relation to the infection, which is due to spirochaetes as such.\r\n\r\n  It may be stated that spirochaetes as such may be found in the\r\n  secretion of the coxal glands as well as in the faeces. This\r\n  coxal fluid dilutes the thick faeces and makes an emulsion which\r\n  is smeared out by the body of the tick in the area of the bite\r\n  puncture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—_Spirochaeta novyi._ (Todd.)]\r\n\r\n  At any rate this infection of man seems to be the contamination\r\n  method, the material from faeces and coxal glands being rubbed\r\n  into the wound made by the tick-bite. The ticks hide in the cracks\r\n  about the old native huts and bite the sleeping inmates. There\r\n  may be quite a local reaction at the site of the bite. _Spironema\r\n  duttoni_ has been cultured by Noguchi, by utilizing his methods\r\n  for culturing the organism of syphilis. In such cultures he has\r\n  noted longitudinal division rather than transverse, this fact\r\n  rather favoring a protozoal as against a bacterial nature. This\r\n  spirochaete is from 24-30 microns long, about 0.45 micron broad and\r\n  has a corkscrew motility. It is readily transmissible to a number\r\n  of laboratory animals, as monkeys, white rats, etc. The spirochaete\r\n  of Northern African relapsing fever, _S. berbera_, causes the\r\n  disease as seen in North Africa and Egypt. It is transmitted by\r\n  lice, Nicolle and others having shown that the spirochaetes make\r\n  their way from the alimentary tract to the body cavity of the\r\n  louse. They have shown that the bite alone of an infected louse is\r\n  innocuous and also that the faeces are non-infective, when injected\r\n  into monkeys. Emulsions of infected lice, however, when rubbed into\r\n  wounds, produce the disease in monkeys.\r\n\r\n  _Transmission by the Louse._—The spirochaetes taken in by a louse\r\n  disappear in a few hours and the insect remains harmless until\r\n  about the fifth day, when it becomes infectious, and so remains\r\n  until the twelfth to fifteenth day. Spirochaetes reappear in the\r\n  coelomic fluid of the louse about the sixth day and continue\r\n  present until about the twentieth day.\r\n\r\n  A striking fact is that infection can be brought about a day\r\n  before spirochaetes appear and that after a period of a few days\r\n  these spirochaete-containing lice lose their power to infect. It\r\n  would seem that the infecting stage was an invisible one. Have we\r\n  then a symbiosis between a spirochaete and an invisible virus,\r\n  possibly filterable? Wolbach has shown that certain spirochaetes\r\n  will pass through a Berkefeld filter as spirochaetes but this would\r\n  not affect the possibility of the existence of some granule or\r\n  chlamydozoal stage. It may be that the infecting stage is not an\r\n  invisible one but a granule one.\r\n\r\n  _Mode of Infection._—It is by crushing the louse, by scratching\r\n  or otherwise, that the spirochaetes contained in the coelomic\r\n  fluid reach and penetrate the wound of the bite. This is therefore\r\n  a contaminative method of infection. Mackie has shown that the\r\n  Indian relapsing fever, which is caused by _S. carteri_, is\r\n  probably transmitted by the louse, and it is probable that the\r\n  conditions under which the infection takes place are similar to\r\n  those occurring with _S. berbera_ infections. With the European\r\n  relapsing fever, bedbugs may possibly act as transmitting agents.\r\n  The probabilities however are that this infection is transmitted by\r\n  lice alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—_Ornithodoros moubata._ (Murray from\r\nDoflein.)]\r\n\r\n  A relapsing fever of Persia is transmitted by a tick of the\r\n  genus _Ornithodoros_, which is also true for the relapsing fever\r\n  of Panama. There is great variation in the description of the\r\n  different spirochaetes, and frequently measurements are given for\r\n  short forms and long forms. They also vary from wave-like lines to\r\n  corkscrew spirals. Again, different species have different types\r\n  and different activities of movement. As a rule they are about 20\r\n  × 0.4 microns. The spirochaetes of the relapsing fever of Panama\r\n  varied in length from 4.6µ to 22µ. Of these the most common were\r\n  those measuring 13µ. Transverse division of the longest forms was\r\n  seen in dark-field preparations. The monkey is susceptible to all\r\n  species of relapsing fever spirochaetes. White mice and white rats\r\n  are readily infected by _S. duttoni_ and the Panama spirochaete but\r\n  are refractory to _S. recurrentis_ except after passage through\r\n  monkeys. _S. carteri_ causes only a transient infection in these\r\n  small rodents.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—With tick fever the epidemiology rests upon the life\r\nhistory of the tick _O. moubata_. This tick infests the rest houses\r\nalong the route of travel, hiding in the crevices of floors and walls\r\nduring the day and coming out at night to bite the sleeping inmates.\r\nThe feeding occupies a long time, more than an hour. Both sexes bite\r\nman. The female lays about 100 eggs, from which nymphs emerge in\r\nabout twenty days. The larval stage takes place in the egg. Shortly\r\nafter emerging the nymphs suck blood. An important fact is that the\r\nfemale transmits the spirochaete to its ova, so that the ticks from\r\nsuch ova may transmit the disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—Siphunculata and Rhynchota. 1. _Pediculus\r\ncapitis._ 2. _Pediculus vestimenti._ 2_a_. Protruded rostrum of\r\n_Pediculus_. 3. _Phthirius pubis._ 4. _Acanthia lectularia._ 5. _A.\r\nrotundata._ 6. _Conorhinus megistus._]\r\n\r\n  Natives seem to suffer severely from tick fever in childhood but\r\n  in adult life possess a sufficient degree of immunity so that\r\n  the disease shows itself in a very mild form in those harboring\r\n  spirochaetes.\r\n\r\n  The immunity conferred by an attack is not lasting and a second\r\n  infection may occur within a year. Such second attacks, however,\r\n  do not present the relapses so important in a clinical diagnosis.\r\n  As a matter of fact there may be no symptoms and such cases with\r\n  spirochaetes in their blood make ideal carriers for the infection\r\n  of ticks or lice. Ticks can be infected by these carriers. In some\r\n  of the rest houses 50% of the ticks may be infected. While the\r\n  tick does not tend to leave its habitation it may be transported\r\n  in the bundles of native porters. The transmitting agent of the\r\n  North African relapsing fever and probably of the Indian type is\r\n  the louse. The body louse deposits about 75 eggs in the clothes of\r\n  the host, which hatch out in about four days and become adults in\r\n  about two weeks. The head louse deposits its eggs or nits on the\r\n  hair of the host’s head. Hagler has noted that, in Servia, typhus\r\n  fever disappeared when lice were gotten rid of but relapsing fever\r\n  continued to prevail until they also exterminated the bedbugs.\r\n\r\n  _The Relapsing Fever of Panama._—Bates, Dunn and St. John have\r\n  demonstrated that a tick, _Ornithodoros talaje_, transmits the\r\n  relapsing fever of Panama. This tick seems to prefer the crevices\r\n  and open joints of bamboo beds, laying its eggs and moulting in\r\n  the hiding places. It comes out at night to feed on the occupants\r\n  of the bed. Two white rats were inoculated with an emulsion made\r\n  from ticks taken from a suspected bed. Both rats developed a\r\n  spirochaete infection. A man inoculated with blood of one of these\r\n  rats developed relapsing fever on the sixth day. A second man was\r\n  inoculated subcutaneously with an emulsion of ticks collected from\r\n  a bed and showed spirochaetes in his blood on the eleventh day.\r\n\r\n  Another man was bitten by ticks from the same source and was\r\n  instructed not to scratch the bite. The ticks engorged in about 15\r\n  minutes, some of them secreting coxal fluid which mixed with blood\r\n  from the bite made a scab. This man was positive for spirochaetes\r\n  on the fifteenth day.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nThe spirochaetes disappear from the peripheral circulation during\r\nthe apyrexial period, notwithstanding which such spirochaete-free\r\nblood, when injected into monkeys, may bring about infection. Either\r\na granule stage or an invisible stage of the parasite may be present.\r\nThe relapse is probably due to the existence of resistant strains\r\nwhich are not destroyed by the lytic substances, developed during the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n  Agglutinating and lytic substances show themselves chiefly during\r\n  the apyretic intervals.\r\n\r\nThe spleen is enlarged and soft. There are frequent infarctions.\r\nThe spirochaetes are found phagocytized in the macrophages of the\r\nspleen and elsewhere. Parenchymatous degeneration of kidney and heart\r\nmuscle, and especially of liver, may be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n_East and West African Relapsing Fevers._—In African tick fever\r\nafter a period of incubation of from three to ten days the disease\r\nsets in rather suddenly with dizziness, marked headache and general\r\nbody pains. The temperature quickly rises to 104°-105°F. and remains\r\nelevated during this primary febrile period, except for slight\r\nmorning remissions. Vomiting is quite a feature of this disease and\r\nmay be bilious in character.\r\n\r\n  There may be rather marked praecordial oppression and a bronchial\r\n  catarrh. The pulse in particular and the respiration in less\r\n  degree are accelerated. Herpes and epistaxis may be noted. The\r\n  bronchial manifestations seem to occur chiefly in the first\r\n  febrile accession. The spleen is somewhat enlarged and tender\r\n  but in many cases this is not noted. Spirochaetes are found in\r\n  the peripheral circulation during the febrile accessions but not\r\n  during the apyrexial intervals. There is great variation as to the\r\n  abundance of spirochaetes. In some cases we may have to search\r\n  several hundred fields before finding a single spirochaete. Severe\r\n  cases may show them in abundance. A rather marked leucocytosis\r\n  may be present in cases showing high fever and bronchitis. After\r\n  about four days the fever falls by crisis, often below normal, and\r\n  possibly with great prostration and cardiac weakness.\r\n\r\nA critical sweat is a feature of this rapid fall of temperature.\r\nDuring the afebrile period, which lasts from three or four days to\r\neight to ten days, the patient feels much better and his appetite\r\nand strength return. With the onset of the second pyrexial wave the\r\nsevere symptoms of the first days are repeated, as with the first\r\nfebrile period. This second one terminates by crisis. Iritis is not\r\nuncommon. Manson and Thornton have reported transient cranial nerve\r\ninvolvements coming on late in the course of the disease.\r\n\r\n  In European relapsing fever the second febrile accession is usually\r\n  shorter and of less severity than the first. Furthermore there are\r\n  rarely more than 2 or 3 relapses. In tick fever, however, there may\r\n  be as many as 10 of these febrile recurrences, although there are\r\n  usually only 4 or 5. In natives there is usually only one febrile\r\n  period, this probably being due to an immunity resulting from\r\n  previous infections.\r\n\r\n  _North African Type._—In the relapsing fever of North Africa the\r\n  attacks are less severe and the number of relapses rarely exceeds\r\n  three. A fever of Egypt, generally known as the _bilious typhoid of\r\n  Griesinger_, is believed to have been a form of relapsing fever. In\r\n  this there was marked bilious vomiting with great tenderness of the\r\n  liver, late jaundice, albuminuria, bone pains, especially about the\r\n  knees, and a high death rate. The symptoms rather suggest yellow\r\n  fever but this disease has never been reported from Egypt.\r\n\r\n  _Indian Type._—In the relapsing fever of Asia there is a marked\r\n  tendency for the patient to collapse at the time of the crisis.\r\n  There are rarely more than two relapses and in probably 25% of\r\n  cases there is no relapse. There seems to be a greater tendency\r\n  to liver complications in the Asian types than elsewhere and such\r\n  cases form a large part of the death rate from this disease.\r\n  Bilious vomiting and jaundice, with a typhoid-like state and the\r\n  occurrence of various inflammatory complications, especially\r\n  parotiditis, are noted. The mind is usually clear, but delirium may\r\n  be present in severe cases.\r\n\r\n  _Relapsing Fever of Panama._—In three experimental cases the\r\n  temperature of the first accession varied from 102°F. to 104.5°F.\r\n  Frontal headache and general body aches were the chief symptoms.\r\n  Vomiting was noted in one case. The spleen was not enlarged. The\r\n  first relapse was cut short in each case by arsphenamine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Symptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _The Temperature Curve._—This is the chief point in the clinical\r\n  diagnosis of relapsing fever. The onset of the first febrile\r\n  accession is abrupt and the temperature rapidly rises to 104°F.\r\n  or higher. After a continued high temperature for three or four\r\n  days the fever drops by crisis, which is at times productive of\r\n  collapse. Following an apyrexial period of four to eight days we\r\n  have a second febrile accession, and there may be several of these\r\n  wave-like alternations of fever and apyrexia.\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—Very marked frontal headache is a striking\r\n  feature and the pains in back and limbs may be of great severity.\r\n  Cranial nerve involvement has been noted. There may be apathy, but\r\n  on the whole the mind is clear.\r\n\r\n  _The Digestive System._—Anorexia and vomiting are features of the\r\n  febrile periods to cease in the fever-free periods. In some types\r\n  bilious vomiting may be marked.\r\n\r\n  _The Circulatory and the Respiratory System._—The pulse rate is\r\n  much accelerated, and there may be some praecordial distress.\r\n  A bronchial catarrh is frequently present in the first febrile\r\n  paroxysm.\r\n\r\n  _The Liver and Spleen._—Splenic tenderness and moderate\r\n  enlargement are fairly constant features. The liver may suffer\r\n  severely in the so-called bilious typhoid and marked jaundice may\r\n  ensue with a typhoid state.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood Examination._—This is the most important point in\r\n  diagnosis. The spirochaetes, which are only found in the peripheral\r\n  circulation during fever periods, are not so numerous in tropical\r\n  relapsing fevers as in the European forms. When spirochaetes are\r\n  scarce it is more satisfactory to examine Romanowsky-stained\r\n  specimens, especially with the Giemsa staining. The spirochaetes\r\n  show a varying number of undulations. There is no chromatin\r\n  staining in the line of the spirochaetes. The disease when severe\r\n  shows a well-marked polymorphonuclear leucocytosis, with at times\r\n  an increase of large mononuclears. This latter, however, may be\r\n  connected with malaria or amoebiasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe disease most likely to be confused with relapsing fever is\r\nmalaria and for this differentiation the finding of the parasites of\r\neither disease is of first importance.\r\n\r\n  The blood of a suspected case even during the apyrexial period\r\n  should be injected into a mouse or white rat (guinea pigs are\r\n  refractory to infection). Spirochaetes should appear in the blood\r\n  of the mouse in about twenty-two hours and persist for about two\r\n  days. Relapses occur but recovery is the rule.\r\n\r\nDengue may be suspected, but the leucopenia, lack of splenic\r\ntenderness, lack of tendency to vomiting and presence of post-orbital\r\npains should differentiate. As there is a leucocytosis in both\r\nrelapsing fevers and smallpox, and similar headache and backache,\r\nconfusion might exist were the parasites not found.\r\n\r\n  Yellow fever has many features in common with the bilious type of\r\n  relapsing fever, but there is no leucocytosis in yellow fever, and\r\n  there is no characteristic albuminuria and slow pulse in relapsing\r\n  fever. Influenza has many points in common with relapsing fever.\r\n\r\nIn a case of relapsing fever with jaundice confusion might arise with\r\nWeil’s disease inasmuch as a blood smear might show spirochaete-like\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n  Typhus fever shows a less abrupt onset and the marked mental\r\n  symptoms (stupor) and dark macular eruptions about the trunk, on\r\n  the 4th to 6th day, should differentiate. If the case is first seen\r\n  in the apyrexial period one may take a drop of blood from a case\r\n  showing spirochaetes and one from the suspected patient. After\r\n  incubation for thirty minutes the spirochaetes should lose motility\r\n  and agglutinate if the case be one of relapsing fever (Lowenthal’s\r\n  Reaction).\r\n\r\n  In blood examinations we may use the dark-field illumination,\r\n  although the spirochaetes stain readily with Wright’s stain. The\r\n  India ink method is a good one. Hagler recommends smearing out a\r\n  mixture of one loopful of blood and a collargol preparation made\r\n  by diluting one part collargol with two parts water. The diluted\r\n  collargol should stand 24 hours and be filtered before use.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe mortality is usually given as about 2 to 5% with the exception\r\nof the very serious form in which jaundice is present when the death\r\nrate may exceed 50%.\r\n\r\n  A serious feature of the disease is the length of its course, this\r\n  often extending from six weeks to two months.\r\n\r\nSince salvarsan and neosalvarsan have been found to be practically\r\nspecifics in the treatment of the disease the mortality has been\r\nreduced to exceedingly low figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The sole question is the avoidance of places infested\r\nwith ticks, bedbugs and lice. In Africa, the habitations of the\r\nnatives, where infected ticks may hide themselves in cracks in floors\r\nand walls, are to be especially avoided. As the tick feeds at night a\r\nnight light is of value.\r\n\r\n  Destruction of the spirochaetes by salvarsan injection is important\r\n  prophylactically as well as therapeutically—the reservoir of\r\n  infection for lice or ticks being gotten rid of.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—We have in salvarsan, or neosalvarsan, a specific. The\r\ndrug should be given so soon as the spirochaetes are found—in the\r\nperiod of onset of the fever. If given at the end of the fever it may\r\nintensify the critical manifestations, especially collapse. Unless\r\ngiven early it does not abort the relapse. Neosalvarsan, being less\r\ntoxic, is better adapted to the treatment of the icteric type of the\r\ndisease. Atoxyl has practically no value in treatment and the same is\r\ntrue of antimony.\r\n\r\n  Conseil has treated cases with galyl and ludyl, in doses of 4 to\r\n  7 grains, with results as good or better than with salvarsan.\r\n  The pains in the head and back are relieved by aspirin, although\r\n  a hypodermic of morphine may be necessitated. Cool sponging and\r\n  fresh-air treatment are desirable. On the whole, treatment, other\r\n  than the specific one, is symptomatic.\r\n\r\n  _Administration of the Arsphenamines._—Although arsphenamine\r\n  (salvarsan) is probably the drug of choice when immediate\r\n  therapeutic effect is desired, neo-arsphenamine is more popular\r\n  because it is more simply prepared and administered, is tolerated\r\n  better by the patient and has a slightly higher therapeutic index.\r\n  It is, however, less stable, and both the powder and its solutions\r\n  should be inspected carefully for signs of decomposition, namely,\r\n  a darkening in color, a strong odor, and insolubility. Ampules\r\n  containing either drug should be immersed in 95% alcohol for 15\r\n  minutes in order to detect any crack. Should a breach be found, or\r\n  suspected, the ampule should be rejected.\r\n\r\n  Myocarditis, advanced non-syphilitic renal or hepatic disease,\r\n  advanced arteriosclerosis and Addison’s Disease are regarded as\r\n  generally contra-indicating the employment of these drugs. Cases in\r\n  which the syphilis is of long standing should receive mercurials\r\n  for at least a week prior to the first injection of arsenic, in\r\n  order to avoid the possibility of activating lesions in vital\r\n  organs (Herxheimer), and should be closely questioned regarding the\r\n  occurrence of symptoms following previous injections (idiosyncrasy).\r\n\r\n  Prior to each injection, a patient should have a complete\r\n  uranalysis, receive a cathartic on the evening preceding, and be\r\n  allowed only liquids for the meal preceding. Subsequently to the\r\n  injection, he should be allowed only liquids for the succeeding\r\n  meal, and be retained under observation for at least twelve hours.\r\n  Untoward symptoms following the injection are treated usually with\r\n  epinephrin solution (0.6 to 1.2 cc.) or atropin.\r\n\r\n  Arsphenamines are administered intravenously, usually in the median\r\n  cephalic or the median basilic vein at the bend of the elbow. This\r\n  method requires aseptic technic throughout. All apparatus should\r\n  be thoroughly washed before sterilization, since it is believed\r\n  that symptoms may arise from substances extracted from glassware\r\n  and rubber tubing. The water used must be distilled, preferably\r\n  twice, and freshly boiled. The dose of arsphenamine is 0.3 to 0.6\r\n  gm., that of neo-arsphenamine is 0.3 to 0.9 gm. Until tolerance is\r\n  ascertained, the dose should be small and not repeated in less than\r\n  a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEO-ARSPHENAMINE\r\n\r\n  1. Only a single ampule should be dissolved at a time. The powder\r\n  should be dusted over the surface of a small portion of the water\r\n  and permitted to dissolve without agitation. The solution is then\r\n  made up to bulk. Specimens which do not dissolve readily are to be\r\n  rejected.\r\n\r\n  2. Cold water only is to be used.\r\n\r\n  3. The solution should not be stronger than 0.1 gm. of the drug in\r\n  2 cc. of water.\r\n\r\n  4. A very small needle should be used, and the time of the\r\n  injection should not be less than five minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nARSPHENAMINE\r\n\r\n  1. _Cold Water Should be Used in all Cases._—(Exception.\r\n  “Arsenobenzol” requires hot water. Consult instructions issued\r\n  by individual manufacturers for possible departures from these\r\n  directions.)\r\n\r\n  2. _Neutralization and Alkalinization of the Solution._—With\r\n  a graduated pipette or burette add 0.9 cc. of normal NaOH,\r\n  standardized against normal acid, for each 0.1 gm. of the drug.\r\n  The alkali should be added all at once, the amount specified being\r\n  slightly in excess of that required to redissolve the flocculent\r\n  precipitate first formed.\r\n\r\n  3. _Concentration of the Drug._—It is important that the\r\n  concentration of the drug is not greater than 0.1 gm. to 30 cc.,\r\n  _i.e._, 180 cc. of water for the usual dose of 0.6 gm.\r\n\r\n  4. _Method of Injection._—The gravity method only should be\r\n  employed. When several patients are to be injected from the same\r\n  solution, the container for the solution should be graduated. A\r\n  glass stopcock is of value in controlling the flow of solution,\r\n  but in its absence the rate of injection can be governed by the\r\n  elevation of the fluid and by the size of the needle. A needle of\r\n  18 or 20 B. & S. gauge is best.\r\n\r\n  5. _Rate of Injection._—Operators should pay particular attention\r\n  to the rate of administration since it is believed that rapidity\r\n  of injection accounts for more unfavorable results in the use of\r\n  arsphenamine than any other one thing. In no case should the rate\r\n  exceed 0.1 gm. of drug (30 cc. of solution) in two minutes, _i.e._,\r\n  twelve minutes for the average dose of 0.6 gm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nYELLOW FEVER\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Yellow fever is an important epidemic disease of the\r\nWest Coast of Africa and tropical America caused by a spirochaetal\r\norganism, _Leptospira icteroides_. The spirochaete is contained\r\nin the peripheral blood only during the first three days of the\r\ndisease. A mosquito, _Stegomyia calopus_ (_Aedes calopus_), biting\r\na patient during this period of his illness, takes in the organism\r\nwhich undergoes some developmental cycle of the nature of which we\r\nare ignorant, but we do know experimentally that a minimum period of\r\ntwelve days is requisite for the completion of the cycle which makes\r\nthe mosquito infectious for man.\r\n\r\n  When a susceptible individual is bitten by an infected mosquito\r\n  there develops, after a period of incubation of from two to five\r\n  days, a rapid rise of fever, with markedly congested face and\r\n  severe pains of back and head. About the end of the third day the\r\n  sthenic manifestations are succeeded by asthenic ones in which\r\n  jaundice, haemorrhages, particularly black vomit, and anuria are\r\n  the important features.\r\n\r\n  Faget’s sign of a lack of accordance between pulse and temperature\r\n  is of great diagnostic importance.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Febris Flava, Typhus Icteroides. Spanish: Fiebre\r\nAmarilla, German: Gelbfieber, French: Fièvre Jaune.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory and Geographical Distribution\r\n\r\n  =History.=—It would seem probable that yellow fever was the\r\n  disease from which those of Columbus’ second expedition suffered\r\n  in San Domingo, in 1495. At the same time the first definite\r\n  description of the disease was that of Dutertre, in Guadaloupe, in\r\n  1635. There has been much discussion as to whether the West Coast\r\n  of Africa may not have been the original endemic centre and the\r\n  importation to the West Indies the result of the slave traffic.\r\n  While there is very little support given this view the recent\r\n  recognition of the extent and importance of the African endemic\r\n  area, as brought out by Boyce, is somewhat suggestive. Spinden\r\n  advances evidence to show that a devastating epidemic disease,\r\n  attended with bleeding from the mouth and nose, raged among the\r\n  Mayas and Aztecs in pre-Columbian periods. One such epidemic is\r\n  recorded as of 1454. There have been numerous severe outbreaks\r\n  in the United States, that occurring in Philadelphia, in 1793,\r\n  being the most celebrated and that centering in Memphis, in 1878,\r\n  probably the most terrible. Yellow fever has been a scourge in\r\n  Brazil since its introduction in 1849, until quite recently. Lisbon\r\n  experienced severe outbreaks of the disease in 1723 and in the next\r\n  century in 1850 and 1856. Many of the Spanish cities have also\r\n  suffered from time to time.\r\n\r\n  The history of the connection between yellow fever and the mosquito\r\n  is discussed under etiology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—Geographical distribution of yellow fever.]\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—As will be seen from the chart the\r\n  chief epidemic centers are the islands and coasts of the Gulf of\r\n  Mexico and the West Coast of Africa. The disease has at times\r\n  extended down the West Coast of South America and is now rather\r\n  prevalent in Ecuador. The last epidemic in the United States was\r\n  that in New Orleans.\r\n\r\n  The disease has never invaded Asia or Australia and there is fear\r\n  that the opening of the Panama canal may bring this about.\r\n\r\n  Guiteras, who has recently returned from an investigation of the\r\n  problem of yellow fever on the West Coast of Africa, was unable to\r\n  find evidence of its existence there at the present time. He notes\r\n  an absence of the extreme heat and abundance of mosquitoes which\r\n  are features of yellow fever ports of South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—It is now generally accepted that the cause of yellow\r\nfever is a spirochaete, _Leptospira icteroides_, which is very\r\nsimilar to but slightly smaller than _L. icterohaemorrhagiae_ of\r\ninfectious jaundice. Noguchi injected 74 guinea pigs with about\r\n5 cc. of blood from 27 cases of yellow fever. The blood from 6 of\r\nthese cases proved infectious, producing in 8 guinea pigs fever,\r\nconjunctival injection, albuminuria, a leucocytosis followed by\r\nleucopenia and, after a few days, a subsidence of the fever to normal\r\nor subnormal. At this time jaundice and haemorrhages occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—Dark-field view of _Leptospira icteroides_\r\nin a culture 16 days old. × 1000. (After Noguchi.)]\r\n\r\n  Autopsies of the guinea pigs showed a fatty and yellow liver with\r\n  nephritis. Some of the injected guinea pigs showed only fever\r\n  but seemed to have acquired an immunity to subsequent injections\r\n  of a virulent virus. In the blood, liver and kidneys of the\r\n  animals showing the jaundice and albuminuria Noguchi was able\r\n  to demonstrate spirochaetes by dark-field illumination. He also\r\n  obtained cultures from such animals. Leptospiras were demonstrated\r\n  in the blood of 3 out of 27 human cases but only after prolonged\r\n  search. Cultures have been obtained from human yellow fever\r\n  blood. For culturing, a medium is used consisting of 1 part of\r\n  serum and 3 parts of Ringer’s solution made semisolid with 0.3%\r\n  agar and contained in tall tubes. One cc. citrated yellow fever\r\n  blood is introduced into the lower part of the medium. A thin\r\n  layer of liquid petrolatum is poured on the top of the medium. We\r\n  need partial oxygen tension but not anaerobiasis. Optimum growth\r\n  temperature is 33°C. _L. icteroides_ is from 4 to 9 microns long\r\n  by 0.2 wide and tapers gradually to extremely thin sharp points.\r\n  These organisms will pass the pores of V and N Berkefeld filters\r\n  thus placing them in the group of filterable viruses. The virulence\r\n  of different strains varies, with some strains as little as 0.00001\r\n  cc. of culture proving fatal for guinea pigs. Monkeys, rabbits and\r\n  birds were not susceptible to infection but the marmoset and puppy\r\n  seemed to respond as did the guinea pig.\r\n\r\nBy having _Stegomyia_ (_Aedes calopus_) feed on infected guinea\r\npigs as well as the human case of yellow fever, and subsequently\r\nallowing these mosquitoes to bite normal guinea pigs, the disease was\r\ntransmitted in a few cases. In certain infected mosquitoes Noguchi\r\nfound leptospiral organisms with dark-field illumination. Mosquitoes\r\nfed on infected guinea pigs became infectious in 8 days, this shorter\r\nperiod over human feedings being due, probably, to the greater\r\nabundance of organisms in the blood of the infected guinea pigs over\r\nhuman yellow fever blood.\r\n\r\n  Guiteras doubts the etiological relation of Noguchi’s leptospira to\r\n  yellow fever on the ground that in view of the susceptibility of\r\n  animals to this organism the disease should exist as an epizootic,\r\n  which is improbable in view of the ease with which yellow fever is\r\n  eradicated when measures applied solely to man and the mosquito are\r\n  practiced. Among other points of objection he notes the recovery\r\n  of the spirochaete from the blood later than the third day of the\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—_Leptospira icteroides_ in blood of a guinea\r\npig inoculated with a culture × 1000. (After Noguchi.)]\r\n\r\n_Infection by Injection of Blood._—The subcutaneous injection of as\r\nlittle as 0.1 cc. of the blood of a yellow fever patient in the first\r\nthree or four days of the disease, or the serum of this blood, which\r\nhas passed through the pores of a Chamberland filter (F but not B\r\naccording to the French Commission), will bring about the infection\r\nof a susceptible person after an incubation period of from one day\r\nand fifteen hours to twelve days and eighteen hours.\r\n\r\n  In the natural method of transmission the mosquito, _Stegomyia\r\n  calopus_, is the intermediary. In order that the female of this\r\n  culicine species may transmit the disease it is necessary that\r\n  she bite a yellow fever patient in the first three days of his\r\n  illness, after which a period of approximately twelve days must\r\n  elapse before the mosquito can transmit the disease. In such case\r\n  the period of incubation varies from two days one hour to six days\r\n  two hours. Carroll was bitten by a mosquito which had fed on a\r\n  yellow fever patient twelve days previously, and four days later\r\n  experienced a very severe attack, this fact being against the views\r\n  of the French Commission that the disease shows a less severe form\r\n  in those who may be bitten in the first period of the infectivity\r\n  of the mosquito. A second case bitten five days later by the same\r\n  mosquito that infected Doctor Carroll had a mild attack. Persons\r\n  bitten by experimentally contaminated mosquitoes before an interval\r\n  of twelve days had elapsed escaped infection.\r\n\r\n  Prior to the investigations of the American Commission our views as\r\n  to the incidence and spread of yellow fever were chaotic.\r\n\r\n  Rush, in 1793, thought that the Philadelphia epidemic originated\r\n  from “damaged coffee which putrefied on a wharf near Arch Street.”\r\n\r\n  In 1883, Doctor Friere reported that yellow fever was caused by\r\n  a coccus, _Cryptococcus xanthogenicus_ and claimed that he could\r\n  confer immunity by vaccination with attenuated cultures. Carmona\r\n  y Valle of Mexico and Carlos Finlay of Havana considered that the\r\n  _Micrococcus tetragenus_ was the cause but Sternberg, investigating\r\n  these claims, showed that these cocci had nothing to do with\r\n  yellow fever. In his work Sternberg isolated an organism which he\r\n  designated “X.”\r\n\r\n=Bacillus Icteroides.=—In 1897, Sanarelli isolated an organism which\r\nhe named _Bacillus icteroides_. In investigating this organism Reed\r\nand Carroll found that it was closely related to the hog cholera\r\nbacillus. Certain American investigators substantiated the claims of\r\nSanarelli. Sternberg, however, doubted these findings.\r\n\r\nTo further investigate the relation of _B. icteroides_ to yellow\r\nfever Army surgeons were sent to Cuba in 1900.\r\n\r\n  =American Commission.=—In addition to Reed and Carroll, Lazear and\r\n  Agramonte were also members of the Commission.\r\n\r\n  The Commission first cultured the blood of 18 yellow fever patients\r\n  with negative results for _B. icteroides_ in every case.\r\n\r\n  _B. icteroides_ grows as readily on culture media as does the\r\n  typhoid organism.\r\n\r\n  It was also shown that yellow fever blood, which was negative\r\n  for _B. icteroides_, could produce yellow fever when injected\r\n  subcutaneously. In 11 autopsies made shortly after death cultures\r\n  from various viscera were negative for _B. icteroides_. It was\r\n  then decided to abandon, as fruitless, further investigations as\r\n  to Sanarelli’s organism, and to take up the mosquito transmission\r\n  theory.\r\n\r\n=Mosquito Transmission.=—In 1848, Doctor Nott, of Mobile,\r\nstrongly advocated the insect transmission of yellow fever but not\r\nspecifically incriminating the mosquito.\r\n\r\n  Riley from a study of Nott’s original paper, thinks that the author\r\n  had in mind invisible forms of insect life, which could act as\r\n  disease producers, and simply cited the mosquito to illustrate his\r\n  views. In 1853, Dr. Beauperthuis, in Guadeloupe, noted that malaria\r\n  and yellow fever ceased to exist in regions which from their\r\n  altitude fail to nourish “insectes tipulaires.”\r\n\r\n  He also thought that the virus of these diseases was introduced by\r\n  the channel of insect inoculation. Furthermore he stated that the\r\n  variety, zancudo bobo (_Stegomyia_), had white stripes on the legs\r\n  and was in a way the domestic species. However, there is a question\r\n  whether his zancudo bobo was _Stegomyia_ and furthermore if we\r\n  translate the expression _inoffensif_ as without result it would\r\n  negate the connection between this mosquito and disease production.\r\n\r\n  From 1881 Doctor Carlos Finlay had been advocating the transmission\r\n  of yellow fever by _Culex fasciatus_ (Synonym for _Stegomyia\r\n  calopus_).\r\n\r\n  In 100 experiments made by Finlay 13 cases of yellow fever\r\n  developed.\r\n\r\n  In no instance had these experimental mosquitoes fed on a yellow\r\n  fever patient more than six days previous to their biting and,\r\n  knowing that a period of at least twelve days must elapse, the\r\n  infections in the 13 cases could not have been brought about by\r\n  these experimental mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n=Extrinsic Incubation.=—An observation by Carter influenced the\r\nCommission in their investigations. Carter, in 1898, noted that a\r\nperiod of about two weeks generally elapsed between the appearance\r\nof the first case and the group of cases resulting from this first\r\ncase. He termed this period the “extrinsic incubation” and we now\r\nknow this as synonymous with the twelve-day period of incubation in\r\nthe mosquitoes infected by the first case plus the two to five days\r\nof the period of incubation in man.\r\n\r\n  The American Commission obtained ova from Doctor Finlay and from\r\n  these ova mosquitoes were hatched for the experimental work. Of 11\r\n  susceptible persons, bitten by contaminated mosquitoes, the first 9\r\n  remained uninfected while the two volunteers, bitten subsequently\r\n  (Aug. 27 and 31), developed the disease. One of these cases was\r\n  that of Doctor Carroll, whose infection was brought about by one\r\n  of these laboratory reared mosquitoes which had fed on 4 cases\r\n  of yellow fever, two of which were severe cases and two mild.\r\n  This mosquito had fed on one of the severe cases just twelve days\r\n  previously. The other case was bitten by 4 contaminated mosquitoes,\r\n  one of which was the one that had infected Doctor Carroll.\r\n\r\n  Of the 9 negative cases 6 were bitten by mosquitoes which had fed\r\n  on yellow fever patients from the fifth to the seventh day of\r\n  the disease and the remaining 3 failures were where the interval\r\n  between contamination and biting the volunteer was from two to six\r\n  days only.\r\n\r\n  At this time the medical mind was obsessed with the idea that\r\n  yellow fever was transmitted by fomites.\r\n\r\n  It had been forgotten that Cathrall, in 1800, had failed to infect\r\n  himself with black vomit and that Ffirth, in 1804, in order to\r\n  obtain material for a graduation thesis, swallowed black vomit\r\n  and smeared it, as well as blood, upon wounds he had made on\r\n  his skin with negative result. (It will be remembered that the\r\n  fourth proposition of the French Commission was that application\r\n  of infectious serum to the abraded skin would not produce the\r\n  disease—the hypodermic injection being required.)\r\n\r\n=Fomites.=—To settle the question of the relative importance of\r\nfomites and infected mosquitoes the Commission caused two houses,\r\n14 × 20 feet, to be erected, one well ventilated for the infected\r\nmosquitoes and the other poorly lighted and ill ventilated for the\r\nblack vomit contaminated clothes, sheets and blankets (fomites).\r\nA medical officer and two privates of the Hospital Corps slept in\r\nthis room for twenty days in most intimate contact with the infected\r\nmaterial. No infections resulted.\r\n\r\n  There were other experiments with similar results.\r\n\r\n  One of the occupants of the fomites building was afterward\r\n  inoculated subcutaneously with 2 cc. of blood taken from a patient\r\n  in the first day of the disease and developed yellow fever after\r\n  four days of incubation. This proved that he was susceptible to\r\n  yellow fever.\r\n\r\n  Blood from this patient, taken in the first three days of his\r\n  attack, was injected into a third man who also developed yellow\r\n  fever. This experiment was to prove that the production of the\r\n  disease was due to a virus capable of multiplying rather than to a\r\n  toxin. Of course, it would be impossible to conceive of a toxin so\r\n  potent that it could produce symptoms in a third man when diluted\r\n  in the circulation of the second man.\r\n\r\n  In the other building there was a screen partition dividing the\r\n  space into two compartments, one containing 15 contaminated\r\n  mosquitoes, the other with the same air but without mosquitoes.\r\n  Controls occupying the mosquito free section remained free\r\n  from yellow fever, while those exposing themselves in the\r\n  mosquito-containing compartment developed yellow fever. One of\r\n  these cases was bitten by mosquitoes contaminated thirty-nine days\r\n  previously, a second one with fifty-one day insects and a third,\r\n  who developed a severe case, was bitten by mosquitoes contaminated\r\n  fifty-seven days previously.\r\n\r\n  As above stated the Commission inoculated men subcutaneously with\r\n  blood, taken from yellow fever patients in the first three days of\r\n  the disease, with positive results. It was also found that if the\r\n  blood was heated to 55°C., for ten minutes the virus was destroyed\r\n  and, finally, it was found that the filtrate from a Berkefeld\r\n  filter was infectious, thus showing that the virus was so minute\r\n  as to pass through the pores of a filter which would hold back the\r\n  smallest known bacterium (_filterable virus_).\r\n\r\n  _Experiments of Guiteras._—During the summer of 1901 Doctor\r\n  Guiteras, with a view to immunity production, repeated the\r\n  experiments of the Army Commission and infected 8 persons, 3 of\r\n  whom died. Gorgas thinks the greater severity of these infections\r\n  may be explained by greater virulence of the virus developing\r\n  in the mosquito during the hot season. It is known that the\r\n  development of this virus requires fifteen to twenty days in winter\r\n  as against the twelve days for summer.\r\n\r\n  _Note._—Doctor Lazear, who had charge of the mosquito work of the\r\n  Commission, tried to infect himself with experimental insects prior\r\n  to his applying a twelve-day mosquito to Doctor Carroll. About\r\n  three weeks later he was bitten by a mosquito which he did not at\r\n  the time consider a _Stegomyia_. The attack of yellow fever which\r\n  resulted from this bite ended fatally.\r\n\r\n_To summarize, the American Commission found:_\r\n\r\n1. That _B. icteroides_ had nothing to do with yellow fever.\r\n\r\n2. That fomites was a negligible factor.\r\n\r\n3. That _Stegomyia calopus_, when fed on the blood of a yellow fever\r\npatient, in the first three days of the disease, became contaminated\r\nand, after a period of twelve days, but not before, was capable of\r\ntransmitting the disease to a susceptible person. Once infectious the\r\nmosquito so remained for the rest of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—_Aedes calopus_ (_Stegomyia calopus_),\r\nfemale. From P. H. Reports.\r\n\r\nFIG. 44.—_Aedes calopus_ (_Stegomyia calopus_), male.\r\nFrom P. H. Reports.]\r\n\r\n4. The blood of a yellow fever patient in the first three days, which\r\nwas sterile for _B. icteroides_, was capable of producing the disease\r\nwhen injected subcutaneously. If heated to 55°C. for ten minutes\r\nthe virus was destroyed however. Furthermore, infectious blood when\r\npassed through a Berkefeld filter remained infectious, thus showing\r\nthat the virus is a filterable virus.\r\n\r\n  The French Commission verified these findings and in addition\r\n  brought out the following points.\r\n\r\n  1. Cutaneous vaccination with infective serum is without result.\r\n\r\n  2. Infectious serum loses its yellow fever-producing power in\r\n  forty-eight hours unless preserved under liquid petrolatum when it\r\n  remains virulent for five days.\r\n\r\n  3. Infectious serum if heated for five minutes at 55°C. loses its\r\n  virulence but has prophylactic and curative power.\r\n\r\n  4. Besides the method of hypodermic inoculation yellow fever can\r\n  only be transmitted by the bite of a mosquito in which the virus\r\n  has remained for at least twelve days.\r\n\r\n  5. In one instance it was thought that the progeny of infected\r\n  mosquitoes transmitted the disease. Rosenau and Goldberger, in 38\r\n  experiments, failed to obtain such result.\r\n\r\n  _Paraplasma flavigenum._—In 1909, Seidelin reported certain minute\r\n  protozoa as existing in the red cells of yellow fever patients.\r\n  He considered them as related to the piroplasms and gave the name\r\n  _Paraplasma flavigenum_. It is stated that the parasite has been\r\n  found as late as the fourteenth day from the onset of the attack.\r\n  The idea is advanced that there may be carriers of yellow fever.\r\n  These claims are generally denied.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—There are numerous records which attest the almost\r\nuniversal susceptibility to yellow fever. In the Orwood epidemic,\r\nCarter has reported that of 46 persons entering an infected house,\r\n“Gray Mansion,” 45 contracted yellow fever.\r\n\r\nOn the “Lombardia,” with a complement of 249, there were 242 cases\r\nand 134 deaths. The 7, who escaped, were immunes.\r\n\r\n  The idea that the colored race possesses immunity is now thought\r\n  to be connected with the contraction of the disease in infancy\r\n  or childhood, attacks at this period of life being very mild and\r\n  difficult of diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Immunity._—As proof that such immunity is not racial we may note\r\nthat in Ecuador the natives of the endemic area about Guayaquil\r\npossess an immunity due to mild attacks in childhood, but the natives\r\nof Quito, 300 miles distant, where there is no yellow fever, do not\r\npossess it, and many residents of Quito have contracted the disease\r\nwhen passing through Guayaquil to take steamer to Europe.\r\n\r\n  There has been some inclination to question the immunity conferred\r\n  by an attack of yellow fever but Carter has shown that in\r\n  quarantine practice we can admit such immunes with perfect safety.\r\n  Thirty thousand such immunes were allowed to enter Key West and\r\n  Tampa from Havana between 1888 and 1898 and no case of yellow fever\r\n  developed from them. During the same period 450 non-immunes from\r\n  Havana gave 13 cases in the quarantine stations.\r\n\r\n  _The Yellow Fever Mosquito._—A knowledge of the life history of\r\n  _Stegomyia calopus_ explains the epidemiology of yellow fever.\r\n  This culicine species is widely distributed in the tropical\r\n  and subtropical world, extending from 38° north to 38° south\r\n  latitude. It is rarely found at a greater altitude than 3000 feet.\r\n  Petropolis, a railway-connected suburb of Rio, has an altitude of\r\n  2300 feet, with cool nights, at times about 9°C, and a freedom\r\n  from _Stegomyia_. Persons having occupation in Rio during the day\r\n  but returning to Petropolis in the afternoon escape yellow fever.\r\n  In this connection it is generally accepted that the female\r\n  _Stegomyia_ only bites between 5 o’clock P.M. and midnight. While\r\n  the first feeding may occur earlier in the day, all subsequent\r\n  feedings, which alone could be infectious, occur late in the\r\n  afternoon or at night. (Recent observations show _Stegomyia_ to\r\n  bite in daytime,—not at night.)\r\n\r\n  These views, which were advanced by Marchoux, would explain the\r\n  apparent freedom from infection of those leaving infected areas\r\n  by the early afternoon. Seidelin, however, claims that these\r\n  mosquitoes will continue to bite in the day after numerous feedings\r\n  of blood.\r\n\r\n  It is recognized that railways are unimportant factors in\r\n  transporting these mosquitoes, differing in this respect from ships\r\n  which offer better conditions.\r\n\r\nThe _Stegomyia_ is preëminently a house mosquito and a town mosquito.\r\nIt is the domesticated one, while the malaria-transmitting ones are\r\nrural and feed in natural plant-containing bodies of water instead of\r\nthe water in old tin cans, roof gutters, cisterns or other utensils\r\nsurrounding the house which are preferred by the yellow fever\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\n  _Stegomyia_ seem to prefer water for breeding that is slightly\r\n  tainted with sewage, although developing equally well in fresh\r\n  water. They will also develop in brackish water.\r\n\r\n  When once this mosquito takes up its residence in a certain room\r\n  of a house it rarely leaves it and thus is explained the danger of\r\n  occupying a room which has been occupied by a yellow fever patient.\r\n  Then too, the warning sound, so characteristic of the approach of\r\n  most mosquitoes, is not given by _Stegomyia_.\r\n\r\n  The female lays about 70 eggs in small groups and not in a compact\r\n  egg raft as with _Culex_. The eggs are therefore difficult of\r\n  detection. The eggs do not suffer after rather prolonged drying.\r\n  Even temperatures approximately 0°C. do not seem to destroy the\r\n  viability. It would seem probable that it is this stage in the\r\n  metamorphosis of _Stegomyia_ which is responsible for the survival\r\n  of the species under unfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\n  The eggs the American Commission received from Finley had been\r\n  deposited thirty days previously on the edge of some water in a\r\n  basin. The water had meanwhile evaporated and the eggs were dry.\r\n  Notwithstanding this the eggs promptly hatched out when water was\r\n  poured in the basin.\r\n\r\n  The most favorable temperatures for these mosquitoes range from 29°\r\n  to 31°C. Under 20°C. the eggs do not hatch out.\r\n\r\n  The larvae, which hatch out in about two days, develop into pupae\r\n  in approximately one week. In about two days the fully developed\r\n  insect breaks out of the pupal case. It will thus be seen that\r\n  a period of ten to fourteen days suffices for a generation. The\r\n  insect is almost black and has a silvery lyre or Jew’s harp pattern\r\n  marking on the thorax. The legs and abdomen also have silvery\r\n  bands. The female lays several batches of eggs and has been\r\n  observed in one instance to live 154 days. The French Commission\r\n  kept a female alive 106 days. They consider that life under normal\r\n  conditions is much shorter in duration than in captivity. If\r\n  deprived of water the adult insect only lives about five days. In a\r\n  refrigerator, Guiteras was able to keep mosquitoes alive, without\r\n  food or water, for eighty-seven days.\r\n\r\n  On fruit and sugar vessels the conditions for the development of\r\n  _Stegomyia_ are exceptionally favorable.\r\n\r\n  These mosquitoes are prone to remain in the same house where they\r\n  have been feeding. Carter has pointed out that yellow fever rarely\r\n  spreads more than 75 yards from an infected house so that it is\r\n  improbable that infected mosquitoes fly, or are carried by the\r\n  wind, any great distance.\r\n\r\n  The same authority has also noted that ships in Havana harbor lying\r\n  about 400 yards from shore never become infected when the crew have\r\n  not been ashore or where infected ships have not been anchored near\r\n  by.\r\n\r\n  It is probable that they are carried aboard ships in connection\r\n  with coaling or provisioning rather than blown aboard by prevailing\r\n  winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—Temperature chart of Yellow Fever. A,\r\nMild case with recovery. B, Severe case showing the saddle-back\r\ntemperature curve similar to that of dengue. C, Chart of fatal case\r\nof yellow fever.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nThe toxic effects are chiefly borne by the liver and endothelial\r\nlinings of the capillaries. The cloudy swelling of the liver cells\r\nobstructs the bile canaliculi, causing jaundice, and the more\r\nadvanced fatty degeneration of these cells brings about disturbances\r\ncaused by interference with the important liver functions. The\r\ndegenerative changes in the endothelial cells lining the capillaries\r\nbring about the haemorrhages so much a feature of yellow fever.\r\n\r\n  The icterus is apt to be more marked after death, and is especially\r\n  prominent about the neck and eyelids. Dutroulau considers the\r\n  absence of icterus in a cadaver as negativing yellow fever.\r\n\r\n  The liver is of a boxwood or chamois skin color and on section is\r\n  very oily. Haemorrhagic patches may be seen dotting the yellow cut\r\n  surface.\r\n\r\nA midzonal fatty degeneration of the liver cells may be noted in\r\ncases dying by the 4th and 5th day but later there is degeneration of\r\nthe entire lobule.\r\n\r\n  The stomach and intestines contain disintegrated blood. Petechiae\r\n  and erosions are common in the cardiac end of the stomach. The\r\n  upper part of the duodenum shows changes similar to those seen\r\n  in the stomach but the other portions of the intestines are\r\n  essentially negative.\r\n\r\n  The spleen does not show any particular change. The kidneys are\r\n  enlarged, congested and on microscopical examination show fatty\r\n  degeneration of the renal epithelium.\r\n\r\n  The adrenals often show fatty degeneration, especially of the\r\n  cortex.\r\n\r\n  Haemorrhagic infiltrations are marked features in skin and mucous\r\n  and serous membranes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case.= _Sthenic Stage._—With very slight or absent\r\nprodromata, often during the night, the disease sets in rather\r\nabruptly with chilly sensations and the temperature rapidly rises\r\nto about 104°F. The face is flushed, dusky and swollen, the eyes\r\ninjected. Very severe frontal and orbital headaches with marked\r\nrachialgia of the lumbo-dorsal region are peculiarly characteristic.\r\nThe pulse is of high tension and the rate from 90 to 110. The\r\nsystolic pressure is increased—at times as high as 175. These are\r\nthe early manifestations of the _first or sthenic period_ of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n  Vomiting, first of mucus and bile, comes on very early. About the\r\n  second day albumin appears in the urine and by the 3d or 4th day\r\n  this is present in large amount and is associated with the presence\r\n  of hyaline and granular casts. The temperature remains fairly\r\n  high for three or four days, with morning remissions and evening\r\n  exacerbations. Of great diagnostic value is _Faget’s law_ as to\r\n  lack of correlation of temperature and pulse, in that by the 2d\r\n  day, notwithstanding the high temperature, the pulse rate becomes\r\n  less and by the 3d or 4th day it has probably decreased 20 to 40\r\n  beats from its initial rate.\r\n\r\n  _Stage of Remission._—About the close of the 3rd day or upon the\r\n  4th day there may occur a fall in the temperature and a decided\r\n  amelioration of the symptoms. This however is frequently not\r\n  noted and even when present may last only for a few hours. It\r\n  is often called the _stage of remission or calm_. By the 3d day\r\n  the congestion of the facies and other sthenic manifestations\r\n  have disappeared and, possibly preceded by the short period of\r\n  remission, there is ushered in the _second or asthenic stage_.\r\n\r\n  _Asthenic Stage._—It is at this time that we have the appearance\r\n  of the most characteristic features of yellow fever—the jaundice\r\n  and the haemorrhages. The jaundice is first noted in the sclerotics\r\n  and rapidly spreads over the body as a lemon to orange yellow\r\n  tinging. Swelling and bleeding of the gums are the earliest signs\r\n  of the damage to the capillaries. This may go on to bleeding from\r\n  the nasal mucosa, the intestines and, best known and most dreaded,\r\n  the coffee ground vomiting or black vomit of gastric haemorrhage.\r\n  Epigastric tenderness is often marked. In very severe cases\r\n  haemorrhagic extravasation into the skin may appear. The mind\r\n  is peculiarly clear, the patient alert and suspicious. At times\r\n  patients may be delirious even to the extent of wild struggling to\r\n  throw themselves out of bed.\r\n\r\n  In favorable cases the temperature rapidly falls to normal,\r\n  associated with an unusually slow pulse rate, even below 45.\r\n\r\nIn the first few days there is a normal white count, with an increase\r\nin the percentage of the polymorphonuclears and later on an increase\r\nin the large mononuclears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—Temperature chart from one of the\r\nexperimental yellow fever cases reported by the U. S. Army Yellow\r\nFever Commission. A severe case with recovery.]\r\n\r\n  Besides the typical course we may have cases so mild that the\r\n  albuminuria is insignificant and the jaundice and haemorrhages\r\n  entirely absent. On the other hand we may have fulminating cases\r\n  with jaundice and black vomit setting in by the end of the 3rd day\r\n  and rapidly going on to a fatal termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Symptoms in Detail=\r\n\r\n  _The Temperature._—This rises abruptly, reaching its maximum by\r\n  the 1st day. Very high temperatures are not a feature of yellow\r\n  fever. There is nothing characteristic in the further course of\r\n  the fever chart and it should be borne in mind that the so-called\r\n  intermission is transient and deceitful.\r\n\r\n  _General Appearance._—On the 1st day the face is swollen and\r\n  congested. This florid congestion, which may extend down the neck\r\n  to the upper part of the chest, is more marked in yellow fever\r\n  than in any other disease. The eyes are shining, the conjunctivae\r\n  injected and there is photophobia.\r\n\r\n  About the end of the 2d day the facial congestion disappears to\r\n  be succeeded by an earthy tinging and subicteroid tinting of the\r\n  conjunctivae. The jaundice does not appear until about the fourth\r\n  day. This may be noted somewhat earlier if one blanches the skin by\r\n  pressure with a glass slide. Petechial eruptions may be prominent\r\n  in the later stages. The jaundice is best seen at a distance of 5\r\n  to 6 feet.\r\n\r\n  _The Circulatory System._—Of peculiar value in diagnosis is\r\n  _Faget’s law_—a falling pulse rate with constant temperature or a\r\n  constant pulse rate with a rising temperature.\r\n\r\n  A markedly slow pulse, between 40 and 50, is often recorded about\r\n  the time of the period of remission.\r\n\r\n  It is interesting to note that the pulse of yellow fever made\r\n  a great impression upon Benjamin Rush, who called it the\r\n  indescribable or sulky pulse. The systolic blood pressure is high\r\n  at first, but by the 2d day begins to fall, becoming quite low in\r\n  the asthenic stage (even below 70 mm.) due probably to supra-renal\r\n  involvement rather than to cardiac weakness.\r\n\r\n  Haemorrhages, especially from gums, nose and intestines, are\r\n  common. Black vomit is the best known of these haemorrhages.\r\n\r\n  _Blood Examination._—This has generally been considered as varying\r\n  but slightly from normal findings.\r\n\r\n  Noc states that in the first stages of the disease there is\r\n  an increase of the polymorphonuclear percentage with a marked\r\n  diminution or disappearance of eosinophiles while later on,\r\n  from the 3d to the 6th day, there is an increase in the large\r\n  mononuclears.\r\n\r\n  _The Alimentary Tract._—The tongue may be coated in the\r\n  center. Vomiting often appears early and consists of whitish or\r\n  bile-stained mucus. It must be remembered that if black vomit\r\n  should appear it almost never comes on before the 4th day. There is\r\n  usually marked epigastric tenderness. Bleeding from the gums and\r\n  intestinal canal are not rare.\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—The mind is unusually clear, the patient\r\n  often mentally alert and suspicious. There is often insomnia. The\r\n  severe cephalalgia, often frontal or supraorbital, as well as the\r\n  severe loin pains (_coup de barre_) are striking features. There\r\n  may be a marked hyperaesthesia. A delirious state may be present.\r\n\r\n  _The Liver and Spleen._—There is no special alteration in the\r\n  size of either liver or spleen. There may be tenderness about the\r\n  liver region. The jaundice of the asthenic stage is incident to\r\n  the pressure of the swollen degenerating liver cells on the bile\r\n  capillaries while the fatal issue is connected with the loss of the\r\n  urea formation function. It has been claimed that an acidosis may\r\n  occur. The spleen is not affected.\r\n\r\n  _The Genito-urinary System._—Albuminuria begins to appear about\r\n  the second day and tends steadily to increase in amount. Various\r\n  types of tube casts, often bile-stained, are abundant. The urine\r\n  shows neither bile nor blood cells except in the later stages\r\n  of the disease. The reaction is very acid. It is of the utmost\r\n  importance to note the quantity of urine voided, as scanty\r\n  secretion, leading to anuria, makes for a very grave prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe main points to consider in the diagnosis are: (1) the facies, (2)\r\nthe severe cephalalgia and rachialgia, (3) the early albuminuria, (4)\r\nthe epigastric tenderness, (5) Faget’s law of lack of correlation\r\nbetween pulse and temperature, (6) the absence of clouding of the\r\nconsciousness, and finally the late appearance of the jaundice and\r\nhaemorrhages.\r\n\r\nOf the greatest importance is the history of the case as to recent\r\nwhereabouts and associates. Also careful questioning as to prior\r\nattacks of jaundice or albuminuria related to hepatic or renal\r\ndiseases. Influenza in its sudden onset and fever and pains has much\r\nin common with yellow fever. Weil’s disease is much like yellow fever.\r\n\r\n  The diseases with which yellow fever is most apt to be confused are:\r\n\r\n  _Aestivo-autumnal Malaria._—In ordinary aestivo-autumnal malarial\r\n  paroxysms the search for the malarial parasite is of great\r\n  importance, although the finding of a malarial infection does not\r\n  exclude yellow fever. Albuminuria is not a feature of tropical\r\n  malaria.\r\n\r\n  In that type of tropical malaria known as bilious remittent fever\r\n  the clinical picture is rather asthenic and bile pigment in the\r\n  urine is an early feature. Again jaundice comes on fairly early and\r\n  the slow pulse is absent. The spleen is enlarged and tender.\r\n\r\n  _Blackwater Fever._—This is an asthenic disease with marked\r\n  and very early jaundice. The haemoglobinuria (Blackwater) is\r\n  pathognomonic. Splenic tenderness is marked.\r\n\r\n  _Smallpox._—The early headache, backache and vomiting of smallpox\r\n  may well confuse one before the eruption of variola appears.\r\n\r\n  _Dengue._—This is probably the most difficult disease to diagnose\r\n  from yellow fever. The facies, orbital pains and backache of yellow\r\n  fever and dengue are similar. Dengue also shows a slowing of the\r\n  pulse. The high blood pressure of the onset is not present in\r\n  dengue. There is no albuminuria in dengue and there is a marked\r\n  and early leukopenia with reduction of the polymorphonuclear\r\n  percentage, which does not exist in yellow fever. The jaundice of\r\n  yellow fever and the eruption of dengue do not show themselves\r\n  until after the first three days.\r\n\r\n  Relapsing fever, typhus fever and plague have been considered by\r\n  some authorities as possible of confusion with yellow fever.\r\n\r\n  _Bilious Typhoid of Egypt._—In 1851 Griesinger described a\r\n  disease he called bilious typhoid of Egypt in which there was a\r\n  sudden onset with marked chill and rise of temperature in four or\r\n  five hours to 103° or 104°F. Rachialgia and bilious vomiting were\r\n  marked. There was splenic enlargement. The temperature fell on\r\n  the fourth or fifth day with at about this time the appearance of\r\n  icterus. Relapses were the rule and the mortality was very high.\r\n\r\n  Bone pains, especially about the knee, were common and severe. This\r\n  disease is now considered a relapsing fever. It is this disease\r\n  which affected the troops of Napoleon in Egypt and which was\r\n  thought by some authorities to have been yellow fever. Others think\r\n  it may have been epidemic jaundice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThis is bad with advancing years and possible lesions of liver or\r\nkidneys. It is difficult to make a statement as to the average\r\nmortality. Thus, in the epidemic of 1853, one of the most virulent\r\nthat ever visited New Orleans, the mortality was estimated at 85%,\r\nwhile that of 1897, one of the mildest epidemics on record, only gave\r\na mortality of ½%.\r\n\r\n  As a general rule the earlier in the year an epidemic starts the\r\n  more virulent the disease; thus the 1853 epidemic, just referred\r\n  to, started in May.\r\n\r\n  High temperatures and excessive albuminuria, as well as early\r\n  appearance of jaundice, are bad signs. The mortality may be\r\n  considered as averaging about 20%.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—By screening a patient during the first three days of\r\nthe disease we prevent the infection of _Stegomyia_ (_Aedes_).\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that this mosquito not only breeds near human\r\n  habitations but that it tends to remain in the same room where it\r\n  has been feeding. Consequently we should use sulphur fumigations or\r\n  Giemsa’s spray or killing by hand to destroy insects. The larvae\r\n  breed by preference in old tin cans near the house door. To kill\r\n  these one should empty every old receptacle of water, and oil or\r\n  cover other collections of water.\r\n\r\n  All receptacles used for collecting and storing water draining from\r\n  roofs should be carefully screened with fine copper wire gauze. Of\r\n  particular importance is it to treat every suspicious case as it if\r\n  were one of yellow fever and screen the patient as well as destroy\r\n  any mosquitoes in the room or house occupied by such patient.\r\n\r\n  Noguchi reports success in prophylaxis by the injection of 2 cc.\r\n  of a killed culture of _Leptospira icteroides_. Immunity is not\r\n  conferred until after the tenth day. He notes that among 3607\r\n  persons vaccinated in Salvador there were no cases of yellow fever\r\n  while among the unvaccinated 181 cases occurred. Killed cultures of\r\n  _Leptospira icteroides_ were first used for protective inoculation\r\n  in 1918 when 427 vaccinations were carried out.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—At the onset one should give calomel in small doses,\r\nrepeated every twenty minutes, until about 2 grains are taken, as\r\n8 doses of ¼ grain calomel with soda. Magnesium citrate or sodium\r\nphosphate should follow the calomel. Some prefer castor oil in large\r\ndoses (2 ounces). This treatment should not be repeated, it is only\r\nindicated at the onset of the disease, so that if the case is not\r\nseen until after the second day the laxative or purgative measures\r\nshould be withheld.\r\n\r\n  During the first three days of the disease no nourishment whatever\r\n  should be given. The patient should be allowed an abundance of\r\n  fluid, of which the best is Vichy, of which may be given a couple\r\n  of ounces every twenty minutes or so, iced or just cool, as the\r\n  patient prefers. Water, to which 30 grains of bicarbonate of soda\r\n  to the pint has been added, makes a good substitute. It is of vital\r\n  importance to put the patient to bed and keep him quiet. When\r\n  vomiting is severe cracked ice or iced champagne may be of value.\r\n  Alkaline enemata are indicated when the patient cannot retain the\r\n  Vichy. There would seem to be an acidosis in yellow fever.\r\n\r\n  A mustard foot bath is best given in bed, the feet and legs of the\r\n  prone patient being immersed in a foot tub half full of warm water\r\n  into which a pound of freshly ground mustard has been stirred.\r\n  Every few minutes there should be added a quart of very hot water\r\n  so that the bath may be very hot—just short of burning the feet.\r\n  The blankets are kept over the patient and the foot tub, so that we\r\n  also give a vapor bath which causes free sweating. This treatment\r\n  relieves the headache and backache. This foot bath can be repeated\r\n  2 or 3 times in the first twenty-four hours. After the bath, the\r\n  sweating patient must be thoroughly dried. Cold spongings are\r\n  important means of keeping down fever. For anuria use dry cups\r\n  to the loins or hot fomentations. Strychnine may be indicated in\r\n  the asthenic stage and camphor in oil hypodermically for extreme\r\n  cardiac weakness. The Sternberg treatment is 150 grains of sodium\r\n  bicarbonate and ⅓ grain of bichloride of mercury in a quart of\r\n  water. The dose is 1½ ounces every hour.\r\n\r\n  Any exertion causing a rise in blood pressure may be fatal. It\r\n  is possible that the stimulation of the circulation incident to\r\n  the taking of food may explain the dangers of allowing food to a\r\n  patient. As before stated no food should be given for the first two\r\n  or three days. Then commence with albumin water and thin barley\r\n  gruel. Later on wine jelly and easily digestible broths. Even when\r\n  convalescence sets in we should be very careful as to diet.\r\n\r\n  Noguchi has produced an immune serum to his spirochaete by\r\n  injecting horses. He has records of 170 cases of yellow fever\r\n  treated with this serum with a mortality of 13.6%, while untreated\r\n  cases gave a death rate of 52%. He notes that the serum must be\r\n  given before the third day of the disease to be of any value—best\r\n  results in the first day. He believes also that though salvarsan\r\n  and neosalvarsan have some leptospiricidal action they are both too\r\n  damaging to the kidney to supplant serum in treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS JAUNDICE\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Infectious jaundice is a spirochaete infection, caused\r\nby _Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae_. This spirochaete is a common\r\nparasite of rats in various parts of the world and man possibly\r\nreceives his infection from this source. There is a sudden onset\r\nwith rather high fever, headache and vomiting. The jaundice appears\r\nabout the third or fourth day when the urine shows albumin and bile.\r\nHaemorrhages, especially epistaxis, are common and the liver rather\r\nthan the spleen shows enlargement. A polymorphonuclear increase is a\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Epidemic jaundice. Spirochaetosis icterohaemorrhagica.\r\nTyphus bilieux. Weil’s disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. FIG. 48.\r\n\r\nFIG. 47.—Showing _Leptospira_. (After Noguchi in Journal of\r\nExperimental Medicine.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 48.—A group of _Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae_ from a culture.\r\n(After Noguchi in Journal of Experimental Medicine.)]\r\n\r\n  =History.=—This disease was probably the form of jaundice noted in\r\n  the forces of Napoleon during the Egyptian campaign. It was first\r\n  recognized as a distinct disease by Weil, in 1886, who described\r\n  it as a peculiar form of acute infectious disease characterized by\r\n  jaundice, swelling of spleen and nephritis. Inada and his Japanese\r\n  colleagues discovered the causative spirochaete in 1915 and noted\r\n  the frequency of this parasite in rats. Infectious jaundice was an\r\n  important disease of the soldiers of the recent war.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Japan and Egypt may be considered as\r\n  the parts of the world in which the disease is most common. It is\r\n  endemic in West Africa and cases have frequently been reported from\r\n  the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n  During the Russo-Turkish war (1877) cases of jaundice seen in\r\n  the Balkans by Sandwith were probably infectious jaundice as the\r\n  disease was frequently noted in that region during the recent war.\r\n  Cases were noted in Flanders during the war. A few cases have been\r\n  reported from the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The spirochaete causing infectious jaundice, _Leptospira\r\nicterohaemorrhagiae_, is the type species of a genus described by\r\nNoguchi as having minute elementary spirals running throughout the\r\nbody and failing to show either flagella or undulating membrane. The\r\ncaudal portion of the spirochaete is remarkably flexible and when\r\nin motion the whole body seems drawn into a straight line except\r\nfor the hook formation of one or both terminal portions. Propulsion\r\nseems to occur by the rotary motion of the hook and progresses in the\r\ndirection of the straight end. If both ends become curved progression\r\nceases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—Four specimens of _Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae_. (After\r\nNoguchi in Journal of Experimental Medicine.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—A leptospira viewed under the dark-field microscope. (After\r\nNoguchi in Journal of Experimental Medicine.)]\r\n\r\n  It is insoluble in 10% saponin thus differing from the other\r\n  blood spirochaetes. The constituent spirals are closely placed\r\n  and the total length may reach 15 to 20 microns. The dark-field\r\n  illumination is preferable for its demonstration although it shows\r\n  up well by various staining methods. To culture use a medium of\r\n  one part of rabbit’s serum with three parts of Ringer’s solution\r\n  inoculating with citrated plasma. The organism is found in the\r\n  blood during the first three or four days of the disease. It is\r\n  also present in the urine. Young guinea pigs are particularly\r\n  susceptible and in them we have, following injection of the blood\r\n  of a case, jaundice, albuminuria and haemorrhages. At autopsy the\r\n  spirochaetes are best demonstrated in a liver emulsion. Infection\r\n  with this spirochaete is common among rats in various parts of the\r\n  world so that it may be considered a natural infection of rats, but\r\n  they do not seem to suffer from it.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—It is considered that the infection is transmitted\r\nthrough the urine of infected rats or men. The spirochaetes may\r\ngain entrance through the skin or by mouth. The fact that the\r\nspirochaetes seem to die in urine within 24 hours makes infection\r\nby the contaminated urine questionable but experiments with various\r\narthropods have failed to indicate their connection with the\r\ntransmission of the disease.\r\n\r\n  In Japan it has been noted that the disease is most common in wet\r\n  mines, disappearing when the mines are pumped dry. Before we knew\r\n  the cause of the disease attention was directed to the connection\r\n  between the infection and working about defective sewers. Trench\r\n  warfare, with the accompanying rats and wet conditions, seemed to\r\n  favor infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe liver shows enlargement and fatty degeneration, but less marked\r\nthan in yellow fever. The organisms are found in the liver and also\r\nin the kidneys, which latter show an intertubular congestion together\r\nwith haemorrhages in this region. Haemorrhagic areas may be present\r\nin various portions of the alimentary tract and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nAfter an incubation period of from 5 to 7 days the disease sets in\r\nabruptly with rigors, headache, muscular pains and vomiting. The\r\npatient is prostrated and has the appearance of extreme illness;\r\nthe face flushed and the conjunctivae injected. There is fever of\r\nan irregular type usually running between 102° to 104°F. for the\r\nfirst three or four days, when it begins to fall by lysis although\r\noccasionally by crisis about the fifth day. Following a few days\r\nof moderate fever or normal temperature there is a tendency for a\r\nsecond rise toward the end of the second week, which continues for\r\napproximately another week when a slow convalescence sets in in\r\nfavorable cases. The secondary fever shows rather marked oscillations.\r\n\r\n  Jaundice appears about the third or fourth day with marked\r\n  tenderness of the liver and slight or moderate enlargement of the\r\n  spleen. The urine is scanty and high colored showing albumin and\r\n  bile pigments. Early in the second week urine of a low specific\r\n  gravity is excreted in large amounts. The pulse is rapid at first\r\n  to become slow with the appearance of the jaundice. There is a\r\n  tendency to sleeplessness and nocturnal delirium and in unfavorable\r\n  cases the “typhoid state” comes on. Pains in the nape of the neck\r\n  and calf muscles are common features.\r\n\r\n  Haemorrhages, starting as epistaxis, are commonly observed.\r\n  Next to epistaxis intestinal haemorrhage is the most frequent.\r\n  Haematuria is rarely observed. The red cells and the haemoglobin\r\n  fall in percentage with an increase in the polymorphonuclears. The\r\n  leucocytosis runs about 15,000.\r\n\r\n  The spirochaetes may be found with the dark-field illumination\r\n  early in the disease in a blood examination and later on in the\r\n  urine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the causative spirochaete is very scarce\r\nin the blood of this disease which is usually not the case with\r\nrelapsing fever showing jaundice. It is best to inject 2 to 4 cc.\r\nof blood into young guinea pigs intraperitoneally and after the\r\ndevelopment of the infection in the animal we find the spirochaetes\r\nrather abundantly in preparations made from liver emulsions and\r\nexamined with dark-field illumination. Noguchi cultured the organism\r\nfrom the blood early in the disease but found it difficult. Wataguchi\r\nstates that when the blood is simply diluted with water and kept at a\r\ntemperature of about 25°C. growth may be obtained by the fourth day,\r\nreaching a maximum by the second week.\r\n\r\n  Agglutinins appear in the blood about the end of the first week and\r\n  cultures may be agglutinated by such serum diluted as high as 1 to\r\n  500.\r\n\r\n  Bilious remittent fever shows earlier jaundice, a more rapid pulse\r\n  rate and malarial parasites.\r\n\r\n  In yellow fever there is more marked rachialgia and earlier and\r\n  more marked albuminuria. The marked leucocytosis of Weil’s disease\r\n  should be of differentiating value.\r\n\r\n  The early jaundice and haemoglobinuria of blackwater fever should\r\n  distinguish this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis and Treatment\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—As the infection appears to be transmitted through\r\nthe medium of the urine and faeces, sterilization of these discharges\r\nfrom those sick with the disease should be practised. Extermination\r\nof the rat, the host of the parasite, is the important method of\r\neradication of the disease.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—This would appear to be solely symptomatic.\r\nArsphenamine has no effect on the infection. Hexamethylenamine has\r\nbeen recommended. A serum against the organism has been prepared and\r\nseems to show protective value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nRAT BITE FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION\r\n\r\nRat bite fever is a relapsing type of fever following the bite of\r\nrats infected with _Leptospira morsus-muris_, which brings about\r\nthe infection of man with this spirochaete. Following the healing\r\nof the wound we have developing in the cicatrix inflammatory signs\r\nwith lymphangitis and swelling of the tributary lymphatic glands. The\r\nonset is sudden with rigors and fever, which latter continues for\r\nseveral days to then fall to normal and after an apyrexial period to\r\nbe followed by relapse. Numerous relapses follow during the following\r\nweeks, months or even years of the disease. In Japan the disease is\r\nknown by the name of Sodoku.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—In a study of this disease Futaki and others discovered\r\na spirochaete in the tissues of the bite area and the adjacent\r\nlymphatic glands (1915). These spirochaetes were about 10 microns\r\nlong. In the blood of man and infected animals shorter and thicker\r\nspirochaetes are found (3 to 6 microns). When cultivated in the media\r\nused for other _Leptospira_ we have longer forms up to about 20\r\nmicrons. The shorter forms are considered as young organisms.\r\n\r\n  _Leptospira morsus-muris_ is found in the blood of infected\r\n  mice, rats or guinea pigs during the first two weeks and then\r\n  becomes distributed in the connective tissues especially that\r\n  of the lips, bridge of nose and tongue. They are not secreted\r\n  in the saliva but the transfer seems to occur by a break in the\r\n  spirochaete-containing tissues and thus inoculated into the bite\r\n  wound. The organism may possibly be excreted in the urine.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—It has been found that about 3% of house-rats in\r\nJapan are carriers of the disease. It is less frequent in other\r\ncountries although reported from various European countries, America\r\nand especially China. The disease has also been reported from\r\nAustralia. It seems probable that the construction of the Japanese\r\nhouses gives greater opportunity for the occurrence of bites of rats\r\nthan elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—_Spirochaeta (morsus) muris_ in lung of\r\nmouse inoculated with blood from human rat bite fever.

Giemsa’s stain. × 1250.\r\n(From MacNeal. After Futaki and associates.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn infected guinea pigs there is swelling of the lymphatic glands\r\nand the spleen with the presence of spirochaetes. The liver is\r\ncongested and may show a few spirochaetes. In human autopsies there\r\nare degenerative changes in the liver and kidneys. The infection is\r\nrarely fatal in experimental animals although it causes about a 10%\r\nmortality in man.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nFollowing a rather long incubation period of from six to eight weeks,\r\nalthough cases have been reported where not more than two weeks had\r\nelapsed from the time of injury, during which time the wound of\r\nthe rat bite heals, we have a rather sudden onset with headache,\r\nnausea and marked weakness. The cicatrix now becomes inflamed and\r\nthe surrounding tissues show oedema and at times vesicle formation.\r\nLeading from the inflamed areas is a line of tender lymphatics which\r\nextend to a group of swollen lymphatic glands.\r\n\r\n  The onset is often characterized by chills and malaise. A rapid\r\n  pulse and prostration are present during the pyrexial period.\r\n\r\nThe fever rises rapidly to 101°F. or 102°F. and within two or three\r\ndays has reached about 104°F. and remains high for two or three more\r\ndays. About this time it falls rapidly to normal, attended with\r\nprofuse sweating. The temperature remains normal for a few days,\r\nduring which time the local swelling and inflammation subside. An\r\neruption of purplish spots may accompany the fever, appearing chiefly\r\non chest and arms. There may be urticarial lesions. Joint pains,\r\ntogether with motor and sensory disturbances, may be noted.\r\n\r\n  Symptoms of nephritis may appear.\r\n\r\n  After the critical fall of temperature there is usually an\r\n  apyrexial period of several days during which time the local\r\n  manifestations about wound and glands subside. The fever again\r\n  comes on, to later disappear and reappear.\r\n\r\n  The successive paroxysms are usually of less severity.\r\n\r\n  The fever is suggestive of the relapsing fevers. The pulse is\r\n  rapid and weak. There may be as many as twelve of these febrile\r\n  accessions and the course of the disease may extend over several\r\n  months. There is an eosinophilia and during the febrile paroxysm\r\n  a leucocytosis of about 15,000. The spirochaetes should be looked\r\n  for in the blood during the early febrile periods. The dark-field\r\n  illumination is the best method for their demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nTreatment is entirely symptomatic. Some success seems to have\r\nfollowed the administration of salvarsan.\r\n\r\n  Strychnine for the heart weakness and tonics during convalescence\r\n  are recommended.\r\n\r\n  Aspirin is often necessary to relieve the headache and joint pains.\r\n\r\n  As prophylactic measures the same precaution should be taken as to\r\n  cauterization of the wound as one would observe in rabies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE LEISHMANIASES\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Under this designation we group three diseases, two\r\nof which are general infections and one a cutaneous affection. It\r\nis now thought that the visceral leishmaniasis of adults or Indian\r\nkala-azar and that of young children or infantile kala-azar are one\r\nand the same disease. The cutaneous leishmaniasis of the Near East\r\nor oriental sore and the various leishmania ulcerations of tropical\r\nAmerica are grouped with the others solely by reason of their cause,\r\nthis being a protozoon of the same genus, _Leishmania tropica_ for\r\nthe skin leishmaniases, and _L. donovani_ for the visceral ones. Most\r\nauthorities assign to infantile kala-azar a distinct species, _L.\r\ninfantum_.\r\n\r\n  The visceral leishmaniases are characterized by a chronic course,\r\n  marked splenic enlargement, progressive anaemia and emaciation\r\n  together with leucopenia. The cutaneous leishmaniases can only\r\n  surely be differentiated from other tropical sores by the finding\r\n  of the leishman bodies from smears made from the granulomatous\r\n  tissue of the sore.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Dum-Dum Fever, Tropical Splenomegaly (for Indian\r\nKala-azar), Splenic Anaemia of Infants, Ponos (for infantile\r\nkala-azar), Oriental Sore, Biskra Button, Bagdad Boil, Bouton\r\nd’Orient, Aleppo Boil, Granuloma Endemicum (for the Eastern cutaneous\r\nleishmaniasis), Espundia, Bubas Braziliana, Uta, Forest Yaws (for the\r\nAmerican cutaneous leishmaniasis).\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS OF HISTORY, ETIOLOGY AND RELATIONSHIP\r\n\r\n  =History.=—In 1869 the English medical authorities in India\r\n  became familiar with a very fatal disease among the natives of\r\n  Assam but regarded it as a very malignant form of malaria. The\r\n  native designation for the disease was kala-azar. In 1889 Giles\r\n  investigated this disease and finding hookworm ova in almost all of\r\n  the cases he came to the conclusion that it was ancylostomiasis.\r\n\r\n  Rogers (1896) and Ross (1898) after studying the disease were of\r\n  the opinion that it had to do with malaria, the former regarding it\r\n  as a malignant form of malaria and the latter that it was malaria\r\n  plus some secondary infection.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the very similar temperature charts and misled by\r\n  agglutination tests of the serum of kala-azar patients, which he\r\n  regarded as showing agglutinins for the _Micrococcus melitensis_,\r\n  Bently, in 1902, claimed that kala-azar was a malignant form of\r\n  Malta fever.\r\n\r\n  In 1903 Manson suggested that the disease might be caused by a\r\n  trypanosome, the absence of malarial parasites and non-response to\r\n  quinine being against the then usually accepted malarial etiology.\r\n\r\n  A few months later in the same year, May, 1903, Leishman reported\r\n  findings which he considered as degenerated trypanosomes in the\r\n  spleen pulp of a soldier who died in 1900 at Netley Hospital\r\n  of dum-dum fever. Although first noting the peculiar bodies\r\n  in 1900, at the time of making the autopsy, he was at a loss\r\n  to explain their significance but in 1903, while examining a\r\n  trypanosome-infected rat, he came to the conclusion that there was\r\n  a similarity in the parasites of the two infections and published\r\n  his paper entitled “On the possibility of the occurrence of\r\n  trypanosomiasis in India.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—_Leishmania donovani._ Smear from juice\r\nafter puncture of spleen of case of Indian Kala-azar. (MacNeal from\r\nDoflein after Donovan.)]\r\n\r\n  In July, 1903, Donovan reported the finding of similar parasites in\r\n  material from splenic puncture of cases of dum-dum fever and taken\r\n  during life.\r\n\r\n  There was much discussion as to the true nature of these leishman,\r\n  or leishman-donovan bodies, Laveran regarding them as piroplasms\r\n  while others thought them to be trypanosomes.\r\n\r\n  In 1904 Rogers succeeded in cultivating these parasites in citrated\r\n  salt solution and noted that the cultural forms were those of\r\n  flagellates. In 1903, Wright, of Boston, found similar parasites\r\n  in the granulation tissue of a tropical ulcer in a little Armenian\r\n  girl.\r\n\r\n  In 1905, Pianese found leishman bodies in smears from liver and\r\n  spleen of children dying with infantile splenic anaemia in Italy.\r\n  About the same time Laveran in examining spleen smears made by\r\n  Cathoire from an infant dying of an undetermined disease in Tunis\r\n  found these bodies. Later investigations have shown this infantile\r\n  leishmaniasis to be rather prevalent in the Northern part of Africa\r\n  and Southern part of Europe.\r\n\r\nQuite recently it has been determined that not only is the classical\r\noriental sore a form of leishmaniasis but, as well, certain skin\r\nulcerations found in South and Central America, such as espundia and\r\nuta in Peru, bubas in Brazil and forest yaws in the Guianas.\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The parasites which cause a general infection in\r\nkala-azar and leishmania infantile splenic anaemia but a local one in\r\noriental sore are usually separated as distinct species, _Leishmania\r\ndonovani_ for kala-azar, _L. infantum_ for infantile splenic anaemia\r\nand _L. tropica_ for oriental sore.\r\n\r\n  These parasites are grouped with the haemoflagellates and\r\n  occur in their vertebrate hosts exclusively as small, oval,\r\n  cockle-shell-shaped bodies, measuring 2.5 × 3.0 microns. The\r\n  protoplasm stains a faint blue and contains a rather large\r\n  trophonucleus which is peripherally placed and gives the appearance\r\n  of the hinge of the cockle shell. Besides this macronucleus we have\r\n  a second chromatin-staining body which is often rod-shaped and set\r\n  at a tangent to the larger nuclear structure. It is called the\r\n  blepharoplast or micronucleus and stains a more intense reddish\r\n  than the rather fainter stained pinkish macronucleus. One or more\r\n  vacuoles are common in the cytoplasm.\r\n\r\n  Some consider these nonflagellated bodies, which are usually found\r\n  packed in endothelial cells of spleen, liver, lymphatic glands and\r\n  bone marrow, as resting stages, the flagellate existence occurring\r\n  in some other host than its vertebrate one. Patton has carried on\r\n  an immense amount of experimental work with the bedbug and has\r\n  noted the development of flagellate forms from the 5th to the 8th\r\n  days in bugs which fed on kala-azar patients showing leishman\r\n  bodies in their peripheral circulation. If the bugs are allowed\r\n  a second feeding after the infecting blood meal the flagellates\r\n  disappear within twelve hours, so that for full development in the\r\n  bedbug a single feeding is requisite. He states that the flagellate\r\n  forms change to post-flagellate ones by the twelfth day. At the\r\n  same time, although much evidence exists in favor of the bedbug as\r\n  host for the flagellate forms, it has not been shown experimentally\r\n  that the bedbug is definitely connected with the transmission of\r\n  the disease.\r\n\r\n  Donovan is disposed to incriminate _Conorhinus rubrifasciatus_ as\r\n  the transmitting agent and furthermore he feels that there has not\r\n  been sufficient investigation of mosquitoes along this line.\r\n\r\n_Canine Leishmaniasis._—In the regions where leishmaniasis of\r\ninfants occurs there is also found a similar disease of dogs and\r\nBasile has claimed that the disease is transmitted from dog to dog by\r\nthe dog flea. As the dog has been regarded by some as the reservoir\r\nof the virus, so naturally the transmission of the disease from dog\r\nto child through the flea has been considered.\r\n\r\n  Wenyon, however, tried to infect two young dogs with great number\r\n  of fleas which had previously fed on dogs infected with canine\r\n  leishmaniasis and at autopsy, five or six weeks later, was unable\r\n  to find parasites in smears from spleen, liver or bone marrow and\r\n  did not succeed in obtaining cultures from this material inoculated\r\n  into tubes of N. N. N. medium.\r\n\r\n  Basile states that a temperature of 22°C. is necessary for\r\n  the development of the parasite in the flea and that negative\r\n  experiments have been due to their not having been conducted in\r\n  the winter. Patton has had fleas feed on a heavily infected dog,\r\n  whose peripheral blood showed hundreds of parasites per film. These\r\n  experiments were made in the winter and although examining 200 of\r\n  these fleas he failed to find any evidence of the flagellates after\r\n  eight hours.\r\n\r\n  Views have been entertained that the canine infection is one with\r\n  a flea herpetomonad distinct from _Leishmania_, but as dogs can be\r\n  infected with _L. infantum_ and then show manifestations similar to\r\n  canine leishmaniasis the parasites are probably the same.\r\n\r\n  Patton fed great numbers of fleas on a dog experimentally infected\r\n  with _L. donovani_ and found that the flagellates had entirely\r\n  disappeared from the alimentary tract of fleas dissected after\r\n  eight hours, although fleas dissected within four to six hours\r\n  showed degenerating _Leishmania_.\r\n\r\n  As regards oriental sore Wenyon has found that bedbugs and\r\n  _Stegomyia_ will feed from the sores and take up parasites which\r\n  develop into flagellate forms in the gut of the insects.\r\n\r\n  Proof of transmission by these agents however is lacking and others\r\n  are inclined to suspect the house fly or some species of moth midge.\r\n\r\n  In Brazil there exists some evidence that the cutaneous\r\n  leishmaniasis found there may be transmitted by species of the\r\n  tabanid family.\r\n\r\n  It must be understood that there is always a suspicion that the\r\n  flagellate forms noted in arthropod experiments may be those of\r\n  nonpathogenic herpetomonad or crithidial species as such forms are\r\n  common in arthropods and are difficult to distinguish from the\r\n  flagellate stage of leishman bodies.\r\n\r\n  _Cultural Forms._—Very definite is our knowledge of the cultural\r\n  forms of _Leishmania_. Rogers first cultured material from splenic\r\n  juice of kala-azar patients in 10% sodium citrate solution at a\r\n  temperature of 17° to 24°C. The medium was slightly acidulated\r\n  with citric acid. There was no satisfactory development at blood\r\n  temperature. In forty-eight hours the oval parasites have developed\r\n  into herpetomonad flagellates, from 20 to 22 microns long by 3½\r\n  microns broad, with a 20-micron flagellum which takes origin from\r\n  the blunt anterior end of the body near the blepharoplast. The\r\n  peripheral blepharoplast and centrally placed macronucleus are at\r\n  a distance from one another as opposed to the approximation of the\r\n  crithidial blepharoplast to the centrally placed nucleus in a body\r\n  with pointed anterior end.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was thought that there were differences in the three\r\nspecies of _Leishmania_ from the standpoint of growth on various\r\nculture media, _L. donovani_ not growing on N. N. N. medium while _L.\r\ninfantum_ grew well on N. N. N. medium but not in citrated blood. It\r\nis now known that both species will grow on these two media.\r\n\r\n  It is absolutely essential in culturing _L. donovani_ or _L.\r\n  infantum_ that the blood agar or citrated blood be sterile, as\r\n  any bacterial contamination prevents growth. With the parasite\r\n  _L. tropica_, however, bacterial contamination does not inhibit\r\n  development and statements have even been made that growth is\r\n  favored by a staphylococcal symbiosis. _L. tropica_, it would seem,\r\n  will develop into flagellated forms in cultures at 28°C. while it\r\n  will be remembered that Rogers in his original experiments failed\r\n  to obtain other than commencing signs of division at 27°C., 22°C.\r\n  being the temperature necessary for the development of flagellate\r\n  forms.\r\n\r\n  _L. tropica_ from South American cutaneous leishmaniases seems to\r\n  grow more luxuriantly on N. N. N. medium than does that of oriental\r\n  sore of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\n  Giugni tried N. N. N. media made with human, rabbit and dog blood,\r\n  respectively. The parasites grew well on dog and rabbit blood media\r\n  but not on that made with human blood. He found growth best when\r\n  he added salt in quantity from 5 to 9 grams per liter. When red\r\n  corpuscles are laked in a medium the growth is less favorable.\r\n\r\nWhile differences in development on different culture media may\r\nobtain not only with different species but with different strains\r\nof the same species, it would appear that such variations cannot be\r\nutilized as a means of separating the three species.\r\n\r\n  _Animal Inoculation._—With animal inoculations we formerly thought\r\n  that the parasite of kala-azar could be differentiated from that of\r\n  infantile leishmaniasis by the fact that dogs could not be infected\r\n  with _L. donovani_, while they were susceptible to infections\r\n  with _L. infantum_. Recently Donovan and Patton have successfully\r\n  inoculated dogs with kala-azar splenic material. Patton found the\r\n  parasites in the liver, spleen and lymphatic glands as well as bone\r\n  marrow of the inoculated dogs. Consequently we cannot separate the\r\n  two visceral leishmaniases from a standpoint of susceptibility\r\n  of the dog. Monkeys are susceptible to both diseases. It is\r\n  important to recognize the fact that animal inoculations, even with\r\n  spleen-juice, rarely give rise to infection.\r\n\r\n  As regards separating oriental sore from the visceral leishmaniases\r\n  Gonder has shown that white mice may be infected with both\r\n  kala-azar and oriental sore, there being produced in each case a\r\n  general infection with the presence of parasites in spleen and\r\n  liver. A point of difference, however, is that the oriental-sore\r\n  mice develop lesions on feet, tail and head which was not observed\r\n  with the kala-azar mice. There are some reasons for thinking that\r\n  in human cutaneous leishmaniasis a generalized infection may\r\n  precede the local manifestations.\r\n\r\n  Dogs and monkeys can be infected with _L. tropica_ as well as mice,\r\n  but in them we have only cutaneous lesions produced. Inoculation\r\n  should be made intraperitoneally.\r\n\r\nA very interesting point is that the dogs in India never show a\r\nnatural infection with _L. donovani_, while in the regions where _L.\r\ninfantum_ is responsible for human infections the natural infection\r\nof dogs is not uncommon, indeed many think the dog the reservoir of\r\nvirus for both _L. infantum_ and _L. tropica_. It has been suggested\r\nthat the dogs of India, where kala-azar prevails, may be immune.\r\n\r\n  _Morphology._—As regards morphology it is usually stated that the\r\n  parasites of the three species of _Leishmania_ are practically\r\n  identical. In cultures it has been noted that the flagella of _L.\r\n  tropica_ are longer and more twisted than those of _L. infantum_.\r\n  Again it has been observed that the parasites of the Oriental\r\n  and South American skin lesions may at times show a flattened or\r\n  band-like trophonucleus instead of the constant round or oval one\r\n  of the visceral leishmaniases.\r\n\r\n  Escomel has reported the finding of flagellated _Leishmania_ in the\r\n  South American sores.\r\n\r\n_Relationship._—Within the past year the view has been generally\r\naccepted that Indian kala-azar and infantile kala-azar are one and\r\nthe same disease, the points of difference between _L. donovani_\r\nand _L. infantum_ which had been advanced from cultural and animal\r\ninoculation standpoints having been disproved.\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested that the Mediterranean basin may have been\r\n  the original focus of visceral kala-azar and that it spread thence\r\n  to India by way of Greece and the Russian Caucasus, cases having\r\n  been reported from districts which would join the two foci.\r\n\r\n  Just as children bear the brunt of malaria in old malarious\r\n  districts and adults suffer in places in which the disease has been\r\n  more recently imported, so by analogy we may consider the disease\r\n  as of more recent introduction in India. We now know that visceral\r\n  leishmaniasis is widely distributed in China, north of Yangtse, as\r\n  well as in the Sudan, and quite recently a case of kala-azar has\r\n  been reported from South America, in an Italian, who had lived in\r\n  Brazil from 1897 to 1910.\r\n\r\n  In the Mediterranean basin there is a natural canine leishmaniasis\r\n  and some think the human form may be contracted from the dog\r\n  through the medium of the flea. This dog kala-azar exists in two\r\n  types, one acute and the other chronic.\r\n\r\nSome entertain the view that the virus of oriental sore is that of\r\na modified visceral leishmaniasis and there has been experimental\r\nwork along the line of determining whether the cutaneous infection\r\nimmunized against the visceral or vice versa as with vaccinia and\r\nsmall pox.\r\n\r\n  Manson has suggested that as oriental sore is common in camel-using\r\n  countries it might be that a passage through the camel lowered\r\n  the virulence of the parasite as passage through the bovines does\r\n  variola, so that such an infection was of a mild type.\r\n\r\n  More recently there has been some evidence to indicate that\r\n  oriental sore may simply be a manifestation of a visceral infection\r\n  as shown in Gonder’s work with mice and from the fact of the long\r\n  period of incubation in oriental sore with the appearance in some\r\n  cases of general symptoms as well as the cutaneous ones.\r\n\r\n  The South American leishmaniases differ clinically from oriental\r\n  sore in that, following the primary lesions, ulcerating\r\n  granulomatous processes of nasal and buccal cavities frequently set\r\n  in subsequently, at times even after the primary manifestations\r\n  have healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS\r\n\r\n=General Considerations.=—There are two types of kala-azar, as\r\nthe visceral leishmaniasis is termed, one the Indian kala-azar,\r\nwhich prevails in Assam, Madras, Indo-China, China and the Sudan\r\nand characterized by a subacute or chronic febrile course and\r\nsplenomegaly in older children or adults and the other, the infantile\r\ntype, which in over 90% of cases occurs in children under four years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n  In 195 cases reported from Assam, by Mackie, 100 were in children\r\n  between six and ten years of age so that it is hardly true to call\r\n  Indian kala-azar a disease of adults.\r\n\r\nThe infantile type, which occurs chiefly in the countries bordering\r\nthe Mediterranean, is usually stated to be caused by _Leishmania\r\ninfantum_ while the adult type is said to be caused by _L. donovani_.\r\nIf, as is now thought, the two parasites are identical it will be\r\nnecessary to drop the name _L. infantum_.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—Whether Indian kala-azar is transmitted by the\r\nbedbug or infantile kala-azar by the flea are points which have not\r\nbeen experimentally proven. It must be admitted that epidemiological\r\nevidence supports the bedbug transmission view for the former.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, Mackie dissected 322 bedbugs which he had fed on\r\n  kala-azar cases with practically negative results. He also injected\r\n  material from 588 bugs into two monkeys with negative results.\r\n  Mackie was likewise unsuccessful with lice, mosquitoes and sand\r\n  flies.\r\n\r\nRogers, investigating the disease in Assam, found that the usual\r\nhistory in the villages was that someone with the disease came to\r\na village and subsequently other cases appeared. It was shown that\r\nwhere a village escaped while others near at hand suffered there\r\nwas a history of nonintercourse with the infected villages. The\r\nnatives took extreme steps to eradicate the infection, it having been\r\nreported that the Garos even burned the patients as well as their\r\nhuts. All evidence shows that the infection is contracted by sleeping\r\nin an infected house. House epidemics and family epidemics are often\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n  At the same time various observers have frequently noted instances\r\n  where an advanced case may associate intimately with his relatives\r\n  for months or years and yet none of these develop the disease.\r\n\r\n  There is little to support the view that it is a contact infection,\r\n  as such does not occur in hospitals where verminous insects are\r\n  absent. By isolating the sick and moving the uninfected to new\r\n  houses, only a short distance away, there is no spread of the\r\n  disease. The disease practically appears only in those Europeans\r\n  who live with or among natives.\r\n\r\n  In view of the fact that _Leishmania_ may be found in the\r\n  intestinal ulcerations or in the kidneys there have been\r\n  suggestions that the disease may be spread through the medium of\r\n  faeces or urine. There is not the slightest evidence that the\r\n  parasites could live in water which they might contaminate and the\r\n  view that some sort of transmitting host might take up parasites\r\n  from the faeces or urine is improbable, as the parasites have never\r\n  been found in faeces or urine.\r\n\r\n  The fact that a distance of 300 yards seems to suffice for\r\n  permanent protection of the uninfected excludes from consideration\r\n  such transmitting agents as the mosquito or house fly.\r\n\r\n  The tendency of some to incriminate soil factors can be explained\r\n  by the well-known fact that bedbugs can live for months without\r\n  food, being ready to bite those entering an infected house even\r\n  after long disuse as a habitation of man.\r\n\r\n  Infantile kala-azar may possibly be connected with the disease in\r\n  dogs and may be transmitted by the agency of the flea but there is\r\n  nothing like the evidence for this view that obtains for the bedbug\r\n  theory in Indian kala-azar.\r\n\r\n=Pathology.=—At autopsy there is noted marked emaciation with\r\ngreatly enlarged spleen and liver, dropsical effusions and ulceration\r\nof the large intestine. The spleen is often enormously enlarged,\r\nrather firm but quite friable. The liver may at times show cirrhosis\r\nbut the usual change is a distention of the endothelial cells of the\r\nintralobular capillaries with great numbers of parasites, as many as\r\n100 or more parasites being at times found in a single cell. Not only\r\ndo the endothelial cells of the liver contain parasites but those of\r\nthe spleen, particularly the cells lining the venous sinuses as well\r\nas those of the pulp cords, the lymphatic glands and bone marrow.\r\nThe parasites are present in the intestinal ulcerations of the\r\nterminal stages. Less frequently they are found in kidneys, adrenals,\r\ntesticles, pancreas and lungs. Rarely, parasites may not be found\r\nat the autopsy of advanced cases. It is possible that the finding\r\nof coccus-like bodies in the cells of such cases may represent\r\ndegenerated leishman bodies. The mesenteric and prevertebral lymph\r\nglands are swollen. The bone marrow is red.\r\n\r\n  When the phagocytic endothelial cells rupture the parasites\r\n  are taken up by other cells and if by large mononuclear or\r\n  polymorphonuclear cells may appear in the peripheral circulation.\r\n  In possibly 80% of cases the parasites may be found after prolonged\r\n  search in smears of peripheral blood. The leucopenia and large\r\n  mononuclear increase are the blood features.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n_Indian kala-azar._—As with all diseases tending to a chronic course\r\nit is difficult to be sure of the length of the period of incubation\r\nof kala-azar and various authorities have given it as from two to\r\nthree weeks to several months. Manson states that one of his cases\r\ndeveloped the initial fever of the disease ten days after arriving in\r\nthe endemic area. As a rule the period of onset is rather indefinite.\r\nThere may be a history of daily rigors, so that malaria is suspected,\r\nbut it is found that the fever does not respond to quinine. The fever\r\nis usually of a low remittent type, rarely a low continued fever, in\r\nwhich the temperature does not exceed 101°F. At times however in the\r\nearly stage the remittent fever is of a high type, the temperature\r\nreaching 104°F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—Fever chart of a case of kala-azar reported\r\nby Bassett-Smith. This chart shows how easily one might confuse the\r\ntemperature curve of this disease with that of Malta fever.]\r\n\r\n  Rogers attaches particular importance to the fact that four-hour\r\n  charts will show a double or even triple rise of fever in the\r\n  twenty-four hours instead of the single one in typhoid fever.\r\n  The patients also show a striking absence of typhoid malaise and\r\n  apathy often stating that they feel well when the temperature may\r\n  approximate 104°F.\r\n\r\nThe febrile accessions last from two to six weeks to be followed by\r\nperiods of apyrexia and apparent improvement. Then follow further\r\nwaves of fever and apyrexia so that the fever chart may resemble that\r\nof Malta fever.\r\n\r\n  In the early stages of the disease the loss of weight is apt to be\r\n  marked. Later on, owing to improvement in appetite and increase in\r\n  spleen, this is not so manifest.\r\n\r\n  The spleen begins to enlarge early in the disease and has usually\r\n  reached the level of the umbilicus by the third month. In some\r\n  cases there is little if any enlargement of the spleen even in\r\n  the chronic stages. At times we note only an irregular fever with\r\n  weakness, anaemia and emaciation. The liver does not usually become\r\n  distinctly enlarged until about the sixth month.\r\n\r\n  The course of the disease in India is chronic often covering a\r\n  period of one or two years. In the Sudan, however, Bousfield noted\r\n  that the symptoms ran an acute course, the average duration being\r\n  only about 5 months. Rarely he encountered chronic cases with\r\n  greatly enlarged spleen.\r\n\r\n  As the disease progresses anaemia and emaciation become marked so\r\n  that the bulging spleen and liver in a dusky or earthy colored,\r\n  skeleton-like native (black fever) make a striking picture. The\r\n  lymphatic glands of cases in North China show enlargement.\r\n\r\n  Symptoms referable to intestinal ulcerations, such as diarrhoea or\r\n  dysentery, are often noted at the end. Bleeding from the gums and\r\n  nose is not infrequently noted.\r\n\r\nThe marked leucopenia, with accompanying decrease in the\r\npolymorphonuclears (the bacterial phagocytes), makes septic\r\ninfections and pneumonia especially common in the course of kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  These complications frequently bring about a fatal termination so\r\n  that we do not get the typical terminal cachexia with emaciation,\r\n  exhaustion, dry brittle hair, petechiae, oedema and ascites. On\r\n  the other hand the tendency of a bacterial infection to cause a\r\n  leucocytosis may bring about a cure.\r\n\r\n_Infantile kala-azar._—The symptoms on the whole are similar to\r\nthose of the adult type of kala-azar and differ only to the extent\r\nthat might be expected in a disease occurring in very young children\r\ninstead of in those older.\r\n\r\n  The onset is insidious with some fever and gastro-intestinal upset.\r\n  The spleen enlarges, the child becomes apathetic, anaemic and\r\n  emaciated. Irregular attacks of fever occur and the child often\r\n  suffers from epistaxis, bleeding from the gums or haemorrhages into\r\n  the skin. According to Nicolle a peculiar pallor of the skin is\r\n  characteristic. Ulcerations of the intestines and noma may bring\r\n  about a fatal termination. The liver does not enlarge to the extent\r\n  that the spleen does. The finding of the parasites is necessary for\r\n  the distinction of this infantile splenomegaly from those of other\r\n  origin. The lymphatic glands are not usually enlarged.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _Onset and Fever Chart._—The disease commences in a rather\r\n  indefinite manner, often with gastro-intestinal symptoms or\r\n  possibly daily rigors. The fever chart is that of a remittent\r\n  fever with rather marked oscillations and in particular a double\r\n  rise in the 24 hours, which Rogers regards as characteristic. The\r\n  absence of a high continued fever and this double daily rise assist\r\n  in differentiating typhoid. Waves of fever separated by apyrexial\r\n  periods often simulate the fever chart of Malta fever.\r\n\r\n  _The Spleen, Liver and Lymphatic Glands._—The splenic enlargement,\r\n  which may reach the umbilicus by the third month, is the most\r\n  characteristic clinical sign of kala-azar. The diagnosis was\r\n  formerly made by spleen puncture but owing to many fatalities\r\n  the liver puncture is to be preferred, although the results of\r\n  such exploratory examinations are often negative, the liver being\r\n  involved to a less extent than the spleen and rarely showing\r\n  appreciable enlargement before the third month. It is during the\r\n  pyrexial periods that the spleen and liver enlarge.\r\n\r\n  Cochran has brought forward the importance of examining smears from\r\n  excised lymph glands for the parasites and others have shown that\r\n  gland puncture is of value. The glands in the infantile type of the\r\n  disease often do not show enlargement.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—Marked anaemia is only found in the later stages and\r\n  the color index is about normal. The number of red cells rarely\r\n  falls below 2,000,000.\r\n\r\n  Leucopenia is characteristically marked, this having been below\r\n  2000 in 62% of Rogers’ cases. This authority considers the finding\r\n  of 1 white to 1000 red cells, in a case of fever, very significant\r\n  of kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  There is also an increase in the large mononuclear percentage which\r\n  would aid in differentiating typhoid.\r\n\r\n  The coagulability of the blood is decreased and this may be a\r\n  factor in the fatal results which at times follow spleen puncture.\r\n\r\n  Parasites are found in the peripheral circulation in about 80% of\r\n  cases, after prolonged search, and may be phagocytized by either\r\n  large mononuclears or polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n  Patton found parasites in the peripheral blood in the examination\r\n  of a single slide in 42 out of 84 cases and with three slides in 25\r\n  of those not showing parasites with the first slide. By repeated\r\n  examinations up to the seventeenth slide, he got positive results\r\n  in all 84 cases.\r\n\r\n  The Sudan commission found that the alkalinity of the serum of\r\n  their patients was diminished.\r\n\r\n  Rogers has noted an acidosis in unfavorable cases of kala-azar\r\n  while those showing improvement only showed slight or no acidosis.\r\n\r\n  _Respiratory and Circulatory Systems._—There is very little that\r\n  is constant, the lungs being quite normal in 90% of Rogers’ cases.\r\n  The pulse rate is rather variable, although usually accelerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosis\r\n\r\n_Clinical Diagnosis._—Cases of kala-azar are usually diagnosed as\r\nmalaria and it is in the lack of response to quinine that we have our\r\nbest point of differentiation.\r\n\r\n  In children showing splenomegaly the probability of the case being\r\n  kala-azar rather than malaria is indicated if the case has shown\r\n  progressive deterioration of health.\r\n\r\n  Malta fever shows a rather similar succession of febrile and\r\n  afebrile periods but the spleen of the former rarely shows marked\r\n  enlargement and the bronchial catarrh, sweatings, transient joint\r\n  swellings and neuralgic manifestations are characteristic of Malta\r\n  fever. Kala-azar may show muscular pains and slight sweatings and\r\n  the differentiation has at times only been made by the laboratory\r\n  diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  Typhoid and the paratyphoids are best differentiated clinically by\r\n  the presence of a continued fever, the absence of a double daily\r\n  rise and the existence of a more marked apathy.\r\n\r\n  The recent statements that hookworm disease may show enlargement of\r\n  the spleen would make this a condition to differentiate. Hookworm\r\n  ova and an eosinophilia indicate ancylostomiasis but there is\r\n  always the question here as with malaria as to the existence of\r\n  kala-azar and some other affection.\r\n\r\n_Laboratory Diagnosis._—The leukemias can be easily differentiated\r\nby the blood picture, an important matter because the spleen of\r\nspleno-myelogenous leukemia is very friable and the danger from\r\nsplenic puncture is far greater in this condition than in kala-azar.\r\nBanti’s disease with its leucopenia shows a rather similar blood\r\npicture and can only be surely differentiated by the finding of\r\nleishman bodies in kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  While malaria may at times show a leucopenia below 4000, a\r\n  polynuclear percentage below 50 and a large mononuclear one of 20\r\n  or more, yet the simultaneous appearance of all three is rare in\r\n  malaria while common in kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  Malta fever, typhoid and the paratyphoids are best differentiated\r\n  by blood cultures or agglutination tests.\r\n\r\n  Until recently it was recommended that for diagnosis our best\r\n  procedure was to make a splenic puncture. Manson and others have\r\n  pointed out the dangers from splenic puncture in kala-azar and have\r\n  rather preferred puncture of the liver, although recognizing that\r\n  the chances of obtaining parasites from a liver puncture, are less\r\n  than from a splenic one.\r\n\r\n  Statistics have been given where a mortality approximating 1% has\r\n  followed spleen puncture. Bousfield, however, using an all-glass\r\n  syringe with a 1½ inch needle did not have a fatality in 120 spleen\r\n  punctures.\r\n\r\nFor diagnosis the spleen or liver juice, rather than pure blood, is\r\nsmeared on a slide and stained by some Romanowsky method, preferably\r\nthat of Giemsa.\r\n\r\n  Cultures on N. N. N. medium can also be made.\r\n\r\n  Human blood seems to inhibit growth so that N. N. N. medium for\r\n  cultivating _Leishmania_ should be made from rabbit blood.\r\n\r\n  The culture should be kept at a temperature of about 22°C.\r\n\r\n  One should always first examine a smear of the peripheral blood for\r\n  parasites in polymorphonuclear or large mononuclear leucocytes. The\r\n  Sudan Commission found leishman bodies in the peripheral blood of\r\n  13 out of 15 cases so examined, but rarely did they find more than\r\n  one parasite-containing leucocyte to a slide.\r\n\r\n  It is well to select a time when some pyogenic infection causes a\r\n  leucocytosis.\r\n\r\nQuite recently Wenyon and others have noted the desirability of\r\nculturing the peripheral blood in N. N. N. medium. Diagnosis may be\r\nmade in this way, provided one wait from two to three weeks before\r\nreporting negatively as to the presence of flagellated _Leishmania_\r\nin the cultures. As before stated, strict asepsis and a room\r\ntemperature are requisite for flagellate development.\r\n\r\n  It has been noted that artificial pustulation might assist in\r\n  diagnosis by giving a multitude of polymorphonuclear leucocytes for\r\n  examination for phagocytized _Leishmania_.\r\n\r\n  Cochran has recently noted the advisability of excising a lymphatic\r\n  gland and making gland smears to examine for _Leishmania_. Others\r\n  have reported success with gland puncture as utilized in the gland\r\n  of trypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\n  Animal inoculation has no place in diagnosis as such a procedure is\r\n  but rarely successful. Ray has recently proposed a turbidity test\r\n  in which about 2 drops of blood are added to 20 drops of distilled\r\n  water. Instead of giving a clear solution of haemoglobin we have a\r\n  turbidity followed later by a white flocculent precipitate. It is\r\n  now thought that this turbidity is due to excess of serum globulin\r\n  in the blood of this disease and the test can be carried out with\r\n  serum instead of whole blood.\r\n\r\n=Prognosis.=—Kala-azar is a chronic disease in the great majority\r\nof cases although both the adult and infantile types may show cases\r\nrapidly running to a fatal termination. Marked intestinal disturbance\r\nmakes for a bad prognosis as does also a low large mononuclear\r\npercentage. A marked leucopenia is a bad sign particularly when\r\nassociated with such low polymorphonuclear percentages as ten to\r\ntwenty. Rogers notes that in children the polymorphonuclears several\r\ntimes did not give more than 5% of the total leucocyte percentage.\r\n\r\n  The mortality is usually given as about 95% although Rogers states\r\n  that he has reduced this to 75% by large doses of quinine. The\r\n  action of antimony is that of a specific. Patients often succumb to\r\n  complicating septic conditions or pneumonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphylaxis and Treatment\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis._—The best results in India have been obtained by\r\nabandoning infected houses and establishing new ones for the\r\nnon-infected villagers, which need not be more than 300 yards from\r\nthe old ones, thus showing that mosquitoes and flies are probably\r\nnot concerned in transmission. Measures directed against the bedbug\r\nseem to offer the best chance of success. Often, however, the bugs\r\nare so deeply located in cracks of thick-walled houses that they may\r\nnot be reached by sulphur fumigation. Flaming of such crevices with a\r\nplumber’s lamp has been recommended.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Rogers has recommended quinine in doses of 60 to 70\r\ngrains daily, claiming thereby to have reduced the mortality of the\r\ndisease to 75%.\r\n\r\n  Castellani recommends a combination of quinine and atoxyl, while\r\n  Manson has reported success with atoxyl in 2 cases, giving 3 grains\r\n  intramuscularly every other day.\r\n\r\n  Salvarsan has been tried, but without much success, as is also true\r\n  of X-rays.\r\n\r\n  Some have tried cinnamate of soda with the idea of increasing the\r\n  leucocytes.\r\n\r\n  With the purpose of increasing leucocytes Rogers has tried\r\n  hypodermic injections of sodium nucleate and killed staphylococcus\r\n  vaccines as well as splenic substance tablets. The sodium nucleate\r\n  injections were most painful and did not increase the leucocytes.\r\n  He had some success with tabloids of spleen substance.\r\n\r\n  If the blood serum shows a lessened alkalinity the intravenous\r\n  injection of solutions of bicarbonate of soda should be tried.\r\n\r\n  Rogers reports very favorable results from the administration of\r\n  alkalies by mouth.\r\n\r\n  Recently hectine has been recommended in infantile kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  Following the successful employment of intravenous injections of\r\n  antimony tartrate in American leishmaniasis it has been used in\r\n  Indian and infantile kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  Rogers has used the same treatment in Indian kala-azar with a\r\n  considerable degree of success. He has also used a 5% ointment of\r\n  finely divided antimony. The treatment should be continued until\r\n  the temperature has been normal several weeks and the leucocyte\r\n  count approach the normal.\r\n\r\nAntimony may now be considered as a specific in the treatment of the\r\nleishmaniases.\r\n\r\n  Knowles, at Shillong, has had long experience and striking success\r\n  with the intravenous administration of tartar emetic in kala-azar.\r\n  The heavy powder alone should be used—not the light powder. A 1%\r\n  solution is prepared in normal saline and the solution autoclaved\r\n  for 10 minutes at 110°C. If there is any opalescence or deposit\r\n  discard the solution. Knowles begins with the intravenous injection\r\n  of 3 to 4 cc. for an adult and gives the injections on alternate\r\n  days, increasing the dose until we are giving from 10 to 12 cc.,\r\n  the maximum dose. It will be noted that the dosage ranges from 3\r\n  to 10 centigrams (½ to 1½ grains). The amount of drug given for a\r\n  complete course of treatment is 200 cg. (33 grains). In the latter\r\n  part of the course of treatment the effects on the patient are more\r\n  marked so that caution must be observed, and it may be necessary\r\n  to lengthen the interval or reduce the dose. The injections\r\n  should not be given within two hours of a meal. Organic disease\r\n  of the heart or kidneys contraindicates the antimony treatment.\r\n  Coughing, a metallic taste in the mouth and constriction of the\r\n  chest are frequently noted following the injection. Nausea, colic\r\n  and diarrhoea show that the limit of the drug has been reached\r\n  and albuminuria and jaundice are signs of warning to decrease the\r\n  dose or stop the treatment. Christopherson considers that 5 to 8\r\n  grains will cure oriental sore, but for kala-azar 60 grains may be\r\n  necessary. This authority considers 3 grains of tartar emetic as\r\n  the maximum dose intravenously. For children under 1 year of age\r\n  the intravenous dose of the 1% solution is ¼ to 1 cc., from 1 to 5\r\n  years old 1 to 3 cc. and from 5 to 10 years of age 1 to 5 cc.\r\n\r\n  Manson-Bahr has reported the successful use of an\r\n  organic preparation of antimony, the sodium salt of\r\n  p-acetylaminophenylstibinic acid. It is a powder, readily soluble\r\n  in water and has the trade name of “stibenyl.” It can be injected\r\n  intravenously up to 0.8 gram. The drug contains 36% of antimony.\r\n  Knowles advises the use of tonics and, when indicated, of\r\n  anthelminthics. He also recommends cod liver oil to increase the\r\n  weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS\r\n\r\n=General Considerations.=—There is good reason to believe that much\r\nthat was written about oriental sore prior to our knowledge of its\r\netiology referred to tuberculous, syphilitic and other ulcerative\r\nskin lesions. As regards the work done in the investigations as to\r\netiology Cunningham, in 1885, described deeply staining bodies in\r\ncells which were larger than lymphocytes. Later, in 1901, Firth\r\nconfirmed the findings of Cunningham, but considered the bodies as\r\ndegenerative changes in the cells rather than entertaining the view\r\nof Cunningham that they were parasitic protozoa. The name _Sporozoa\r\nfurunculosa_ was given these parasites. As previously stated, Wright,\r\nin 1903, using his modification of the Romanowsky stain, found round\r\nor oval bodies, from 2 to 4µ in diameter, packed in the cytoplasm of\r\nendothelial cells, in smears from an oriental sore in a child from\r\nArmenia. He called the parasites _Helcosoma tropicum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—_Leishmania tropica._ Smear from granulation\r\ntissue of Delhi boil or oriental sore. (MacNeal from Doflein after J.\r\nH. Wright.)]\r\n\r\n  As the result of our knowledge that such lesions are caused by\r\n  leishman bodies, _Leishmania tropica_, we have been forced to\r\n  include among such sores clinical types entirely different from the\r\n  classical oriental sore of Fayrer or Tilbury Fox. Even a keloid\r\n  type of lesion described by the workers in the Sudan is known now\r\n  to be caused by leishman bodies. In 1909 leishman bodies were\r\n  demonstrated in ulcerative processes from Brazil and since that\r\n  time we have divided cutaneous leishmaniasis into two groups,\r\n  according to geographical distribution, that of the East, or\r\n  oriental sore, and that of the West, or American leishmaniasis.\r\n\r\n  Oriental sore is found chiefly in North Africa, Asia Minor, Syria,\r\n  Persia and India, and more recently cases have been reported from\r\n  Italy and Greece and New Caledonia. American leishmaniasis is found\r\n  chiefly in Central America, Brazil, Peru and the Guianas.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—There is nothing definite known as to the\r\nepidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The fact that oriental sore\r\nalmost always occurs on the uncovered parts of the body would suggest\r\ntransmission by some insect as the house fly or mosquito rather than\r\nby the body louse, flea or bedbug, these latter showing no special\r\npreference for the uncovered skin.\r\n\r\n  There has been a great deal written about the origin of the disease\r\n  in drinking water, various inorganic constituents having been\r\n  incriminated as factors. In certain places, as Delhi, oriental sore\r\n  has decreased among the British troops with the discontinuance of\r\n  the use of water from certain city wells. We know that oriental\r\n  sore is rather easily inoculable, it having been stated that\r\n  certain people of Bagdad inoculated their children in order to\r\n  insure against the possible appearance of the sore on the face with\r\n  the resulting scar disfiguration. Wenyon found that the virus would\r\n  not pass through the unabraded skin.\r\n\r\n  The disease is most prevalent about the end of summer and in the\r\n  autumn. It is a disease of towns. Some have thought that it might\r\n  be transmitted through the medium of the laundry. Not only can man\r\n  be infected by inoculation but this is also possible with monkeys\r\n  and dogs when a scarified area about nose or over eyebrows is\r\n  inoculated with virus from a sore.\r\n\r\n  The lesions are similar to those in man but last a shorter time.\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested that the dog may be the reservoir of this\r\n  virus as well as for that of infantile kala-azar. There is some\r\n  experimental evidence to show that an animal which has recovered\r\n  from a visceral leishmaniasis is immune to a cutaneous one.\r\n\r\n  There has been an idea that lizards or snakes might serve as\r\n  the reservoir of virus for oriental sore and that species of\r\n  _Phlebotomus_ feeding on these reptiles might take in the\r\n  flagellates and subsequently transmit them to man. Laveran,\r\n  however, has been unable to infect lizards with _L. tropica_.\r\n  Patton’s observations point to infection from the crushing of\r\n  infected sandflies when biting the exposed surfaces of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe natural infection of man with oriental sore produces a rather\r\nlasting immunity.\r\n\r\n  As regards the American sores there is a great deal of difference\r\n  of statement as to the probable transmitting agent. These sores\r\n  seem to occur in forest regions where clearing of the trees is\r\n  going on. Infections occur in late summer or autumn. Marshy\r\n  districts appear to favour infection. Brumpt thinks the fact that\r\n  dogs, which are susceptible as well as monkeys to inoculation with\r\n  the American leishmaniasis, are often bitten by ticks without\r\n  the production of the sore, is against the view that ticks act as\r\n  transmitting agents. He rather favors a tabanid fly and in a case\r\n  reported by Darling the patient incriminated a tabanid fly.\r\n\r\n  Five cases are reported by Cerqueira as following the bite of\r\n  _Phlebotomus lutzi_.\r\n\r\n  The disease seems to occur naturally in the dog in the infected\r\n  regions.\r\n\r\n=Pathology.=—In oriental sore there is an infiltration of the corium\r\nand its papillae with plasma and lymphoid cells as well as with large\r\nphagocytic cells packed with leishman bodies which cells Wright\r\nregards as endothelial cells. There is atrophy of the epidermis.\r\n\r\n  In the keloid type of leishmaniasis noted by the Sudan Commission\r\n  epithelial cell nests were characteristic although there was no\r\n  other evidence of epithelioma.\r\n\r\nIn the American leishmaniasis there is rather constant involvement\r\nof the lymphatic glands and often lymphangitis. Histologically the\r\nappearance is rather that of granulation tissue with occasionally\r\ngiant cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n_Oriental Sore._—Wenyon inoculated a scarified area on his arm which\r\nbecame infected with pyogenic organisms but eventually healed. It was\r\nthought that this inflammation would destroy any _Leishmania_ which\r\nmight have been present. About six months later he became ill and\r\nhad fever up to 103°F. for a week with malaise and gastro-intestinal\r\nupset. At this time a small red papule was noted upon the site of the\r\noriginal scarification which subsequently enlarged and was found to\r\ncontain leishman bodies.\r\n\r\n  The period of incubation is usually given as about two months,\r\n  although in some instances it may be as short as a week. Usually\r\n  the earliest appearance of the sore is similar to that of a\r\n  mosquito bite. The papule continues to enlarge, becoming purplish\r\n  in color with a glazed surface. It somewhat resembles an inflamed\r\n  acne lesion. Growing larger, the surface of the blind boil-like\r\n  lesions now becomes covered with brownish scales and, either from\r\n  scratching of the rather pruriginous spot or from the development\r\n  of vesicles, it becomes covered with a yellowish crust, beneath\r\n  which is an ulcer with raised edges and discharging a thin\r\n  offensive pus.\r\n\r\n  The ulceration does not generally occur before the third or\r\n  fourth month. The ulcer is painless and may be an inch or more\r\n  in diameter. Healing comes on in about seven to ten months, the\r\n  yellowish unhealthy granulations giving place to healthy pink ones.\r\n  The sore tends to run a course of about one year, hence the French\r\n  designation _bouton d’un an_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Weber’s statistics about 85% of the sores were located\r\non the upper or lower extremities and about 10% on the face, while\r\nthe trunk served as the location for only about 5% of the sores.\r\nThere are generally 2 or 3 sores.\r\n\r\n  According to Déperet and Boinet the number of sores to a case was\r\n  one sore in 30%, 2 to 4 sores in 50% and from 4 to 20 in about 20%\r\n  of cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—Oriental sore. (Ruge and zur Verth after\r\nCardamatis.)]\r\n\r\n_American Leishmaniasis._—Under a number of names such as\r\n_espundia_, _uta_, _bubas_ and _forest yaws_ there has been found in\r\nmany parts of Central and South America an ulcerating sore, more or\r\nless resembling oriental sore, but often associated with ulcerating\r\ngranulomatous lesions of nasal and buccal mucosae. Da Silveira\r\nstates that in Brazil about 20% of cases develop the mucous membrane\r\nlesions. He notes an incubation period of two to three months. In\r\nVenezuela the mucous membrane lesions are more rare.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic glands and lymphatics are commonly affected.\r\n\r\n  Just as with oriental sore one or more pruriginous papular lesions\r\n  appear on the uncovered parts of the body. In a few days it\r\n  develops a pustular summit. This undergoes ulceration and after\r\n  several months or even after the primary lesions have healed\r\n  nodules may make their appearance in nose and mouth.\r\n\r\n  These ulcerate and form fungoid granulations. Even the larynx may\r\n  be involved. The nasal septum and other cartilaginous portions\r\n  of the nose are often destroyed and the overlying tissues\r\n  become swollen and often eroded by ulceration, so that the\r\n  patients present the appearance of similar cases where syphilis,\r\n  tuberculosis or leprosy may be the cause.\r\n\r\n  A point of distinction between syphilitic and leishmaniasis lesions\r\n  of the nasal mucosa is that the latter do not involve the bony\r\n  structures.\r\n\r\n  Rabello noted that a positive Wassermann may be present in\r\n  cutaneous leishmaniasis which is in agreement with Sutherland’s\r\n  findings of 27% positives in cases of kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  The patients suffer from fever, joint pains, bronchitis and general\r\n  symptoms. After a long period of ten to twenty years, during which\r\n  they often die of some intercurrent affection, there may be a\r\n  terminal cachexia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—A case of _Leishmaniasis_ from Brazil\r\nshowing lesions in the mouth. (After Carini; from Mense.)]\r\n\r\n=Diagnosis.=—The diagnosis in either oriental sore or in\r\nAmerican leishmaniasis can only be made surely by the finding of\r\n_Leishmania_, either by scrapings from the edges of the ulcer or by\r\nculturing in N. N. N. medium the blood from the immediate site of the\r\nsore. Cultures were once obtained from the blood of a finger where\r\nthe sore was located on the arm of the same side but usually the\r\nparasites are absent from the peripheral circulation. Gland puncture\r\nin American leishmaniasis may give positive findings of parasites.\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis and Treatment.=—Knowing that the application of\r\nmaterial from a sore to a scarified surface will bring about\r\ninfection, it would seem advisable to cover any abrasions or open\r\nwounds with flexible collodion or other protectives so as to prevent\r\nflies, which may have fed on oriental sores, from having access to\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\n  It has been recommended to paint the spot of insect bites with\r\n  tincture of iodine.\r\n\r\n  Atoxyl and salvarsan have been tried in oriental sore and American\r\n  leishmaniasis without any particularly striking curative results.\r\n  Attempts have been made to excise the early lesions but unless one\r\n  goes well beyond the infected area, severe recurrences may result.\r\n  Bier’s passive congestion method has been tried without success.\r\n\r\n  An expectant treatment is usually resorted to, the crusts being\r\n  softened and removed with antiseptic fomentations with subsequent\r\n  disinfection of the ulcer with bichloride or potassium permanganate\r\n  solution and the application of some antiseptic ointment or powder.\r\n  Thorough cauterization with pure carbolic acid followed by rapid\r\n  neutralization with alcohol can be tried. The injection of killed\r\n  cultures of _Leishmania_ does not seem to have been effective.\r\n\r\n  Wenyon has had good results from an ointment of equal parts of\r\n  methylene blue, lanoline and vaseline in an American sore.\r\n\r\n  Carbon dioxide snow has been shown by Mitchell to be an efficient\r\n  local application for oriental sore.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable effect of antimony on the parasites of leishmaniasis\r\nwas first noted in the treatment of the cutaneous types. The\r\ntreatment is similar to that described under kala-azar. The effect of\r\nthe drug is less pronounced on the lesions of the mucous membranes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—The designation dysentery refers to a symptom-complex\r\nof (1) small, frequently passed mucous or muco-sanguinolent stools\r\nand (2) pains connected with spasm of the sphincter ani (tenesmus) or\r\nintestinal gripings (tormina).\r\n\r\nThe condition may be set up by numerous causes but of these two so\r\noutweigh the others that it is usual to have in mind either bacillary\r\nor amoebic dysentery when the term is employed.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—The Bloody Flux. French: Dysenterie. German: Ruhr.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nAs will be noted in the sections dealing with amoebic and bacillary\r\ndysentery our present knowledge of these conditions is of recent\r\ndate. There was so much that was etiologically, epidemiologically\r\nand clinically contradictory that the subject was impossible of\r\nelucidation until the existence of a group of dysentery bacilli was\r\ngenerally accepted, following the reporting, in 1898, by Shiga, of\r\nhis bacillus of dysentery.\r\n\r\n  Although Hippocrates was the first accurately to describe the\r\n  disease we now know as dysentery yet there is good ground for\r\n  believing that the disease existed in Egypt and India for centuries\r\n  before Christ.\r\n\r\n  Many of the older writers failed to differentiate conditions which\r\n  showed admixtures of mucus and blood in the stools from those with\r\n  blood alone.\r\n\r\n  Commencing with the last century, authorities have considered\r\n  the association of mucus with the blood as essential in clinical\r\n  diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  It is interesting that with a better knowledge of etiology we are\r\n  now recognizing as of dysenteric nature diarrhoeal conditions in\r\n  which there is an absence of the typical stool of dysentery.\r\n\r\n  Our views as to the etiology and epidemiology of bacillary\r\n  dysentery have been fairly definite for at least twenty years,\r\n  while those relating to amoebic dysentery, notwithstanding the\r\n  important researches of Kartulis, Councilman and Lafleur, Schaudinn\r\n  and others have remained rather chaotic until quite recently.\r\n\r\n_The Term Dysentery._—By the term dysentery we understand a\r\nsymptom-complex of more or less characteristic stools and more or\r\nless characteristic pains.\r\n\r\n  As a rule the stool is composed of one or more teaspoonfuls of\r\n  greenish yellow or dirty brown mucus, the altered blood being\r\n  intimately admixed with the mucus, or we may have a whitish to\r\n  grayish muco-purulent mass with streaks or flecks of blood on the\r\n  outside. These mucoid masses may be found suspended in serous,\r\n  sanguineous or more or less feculent discharges which are usually\r\n  small in amount and passed with much frequency.\r\n\r\n  The terms tormina and tenesmus are the ones used to designate the\r\n  characteristics of the pains of dysentery, tormina for the griping\r\n  colicky pains, which center about the umbilicus or run in the\r\n  direction of the large intestine, and tenesmus for the painful\r\n  spasmodic contractions of the sphincter ani to which is due the\r\n  sensation of lack of ability to complete the act of defecation\r\n  leading to straining and justifying Manson’s description “glued to\r\n  the commode.”\r\n\r\n  It is usually stated that the nearer the dysenteric process is to\r\n  the rectum, the greater the tenesmus and the nearer to the caecum,\r\n  the greater the tormina.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN CLASSIFICATION OF DYSENTERIES IS BASED ON ETIOLOGY RATHER\r\nTHAN UPON CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n  Owing to the great importance of the two main kinds of dysentery,\r\n  amoebic, or that caused by _Entamoeba histolytica_, and bacillary,\r\n  or that caused by some strain of _Bacillus dysenteriae_, we shall\r\n  consider them separately from the other causes of the dysenteric\r\n  symptom-complex.\r\n\r\n=A. Dysenteries caused by animal parasites.=\r\n\r\n_Protozoal dysenteries._\r\n\r\n1. Amoebic dysentery (_Entamoeba histolytica_).\r\n\r\n2. Flagellate dysenteries (_Lamblia intestinalis_, _Trichomonas\r\nintestinalis_ and _Chilomastix mesnili_).\r\n\r\n  While in adults these intestinal flagellates usually cause only\r\n  a diarrhoea, with at times marked nervousness, they may produce\r\n  dysenteric symptoms in young children. The onset in children under\r\n  three years of age may be insidious and attended with fever. The\r\n  stool contains much mucus with only a little blood.\r\n\r\nIn cases of amoebic dysentery, the diarrhoeal attacks, which at\r\ntimes occur, are often associated with an abundance of flagellates,\r\nwhich may well be the cause of the complication. Cases of dysenteric\r\ndiarrhoea have been reported from Gallipoli in which _Lamblia\r\n(Giardia)_ were apparently the only parasites involved. Such stools\r\nare often of a yellow ochre color. Relapses are common features\r\nof _Lamblia_ infections. _Lamblia_ is an inhabitant of the upper\r\nintestine while _Trichomonas_ and _Chilomastix_ belong to the\r\nlarge intestine, especially in the region of the caecum. While\r\nthese last named flagellates are often found in the stools of those\r\nconvalescent from dysentery there is a general opinion that they\r\nare nonpathogenic. These organisms may be present in diarrhoeal\r\nconditions in which case it is common to designate such diarrhoeas as\r\nflagellate diarrhoeas. Fantham and Porter have reported 187 cases of\r\npure lambliasis.\r\n\r\n  In diagnosis it is important to recognize the encysted _Lamblia_.\r\n  These are oval cysts, about 10 × 7µ and show a curved central line,\r\n  with two lateral dots. When stained these dots show as chromatin\r\n  areas. These cysts may be found in the faeces in great numbers. The\r\n  vegetative _Lamblia_ has 4 pairs of flagella, is about 15µ long and\r\n  has a tumbling motion. Calomel alone or calomel and ipecac give\r\n  good results at times. Enemata of organic silver salts may be of\r\n  benefit.\r\n\r\n  Porter recommends bismuth salicylate. Low has noted the tendency of\r\n  lambliasis to recur and thinks many of the reported cases of cures\r\n  are only temporary. His experience with bismuth, salol, thymol and\r\n  cyllin has not been encouraging.\r\n\r\n  It is well known that lambliasis is of rather frequent occurrence\r\n  in mice and rats so that these rodents may be factors in spreading\r\n  the infection through the agency of their faeces deposited about\r\n  human food.\r\n\r\n  Of other drugs recommended in treatment Dobell and Low have had no\r\n  success with methylene blue, turpentine or beta-naphthol. These\r\n  authors failed to find any increase in either large mononuclears or\r\n  eosinophiles in a case of the infection.\r\n\r\n  Since Lamblia inhabit the upper parts of the small intestine, it\r\n  may be that the administration of drugs by the duodenal tube will\r\n  prove an effective method of treatment. Owens reports successful\r\n  results in the treatment of amoebic dysentery from ipecac so\r\n  administered. Stiles has recommended sulphur in lambliasis.\r\n\r\n3. Ciliate dysenteries (_Balantidium coli_).\r\n\r\nWhile various ciliates may cause a severe type of dysentery it is\r\nvery exceptional that others than _Balantidium coli_ do so. This oval\r\nciliate is from 60 to 100 microns long by about 50 to 70 microns\r\nbroad. It is a commensal of hogs and the disease in man is usually\r\nfound in those having the care of hogs. Infections have been reported\r\nfrom various parts of the world, temperate as well as tropical\r\nregions. These ciliates may be found in the faeces of persons\r\napparently well but in such cases symptoms may eventually appear. The\r\nparasites multiply in the submucosa and the pathologic process is\r\nsimilar to that observed in the large intestine in amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  The parasite is so large and has such an active motility that\r\n  it would be impossible to fail to detect it in a microscopic\r\n  examination of the faeces. Encysted parasites are round. The\r\n  onset is rather insidious with diarrhoea which may be followed by\r\n  dysentery. A severe form of anemia may be noted.\r\n\r\n  Ipecac, emetine, arsenic and quinine appear to be of little\r\n  value in the treatment, but Walker considers the organic silver\r\n  compounds, as protargol, etc., of value. Methylene blue enemata\r\n  (1-3000) and 2-grain pills by mouth have been recommended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.—Important pathogenic Protozoa of the\r\nintestinal tract. (1a) Motile _E. coli_.

There are also dysenteric manifestations noted in the terminal\r\nstages of kala-azar (_Leishmania donovani_) and in algid pernicious\r\nmalaria (_Plasmodium falciparum_). These conditions are taken up\r\nunder the diseases kala-azar and malaria.\r\n\r\n  Wenyon noted a case of coccidial infection (_Isospora hominis_)\r\n  in which there was a dysenteric syndrome. There have been about\r\n  seventy cases of infection with this parasite reported, chiefly\r\n  from soldiers serving in Gallipoli. The usual opinion is that they\r\n  are nonpathogenic parasites. The oocysts are ovoid, with one end\r\n  narrowed, and measure 28 × 14 microns. There are two sporocysts,\r\n  each of which contains four sporozoites. The cyst when first passed\r\n  is unsegmented.\r\n\r\n_Helminthic dysenteries._—1. In addition to the protozoal causes\r\nabove noted we may have dysenteric symptoms following infections with\r\ntrematodes, especially _Schistosoma mansoni_ and _S. japonicum_. In\r\nthese cases we have mucus coating the stool with more or less clotted\r\nblood in which mucus we may find the diagnostic ova. A rather high\r\neosinophilia is present.\r\n\r\n  2. Infections with _Gastrodiscus hominis_ also give rise to\r\n  dysenteric manifestations.\r\n\r\n  3. A very small cestode, _Heterophyes heterophyes_, has been noted\r\n  to cause a condition suggestive of dysentery.\r\n\r\n  4. In 1902, Brumpt noted the finding of a nematode,\r\n  _Oesophagostomum brumpti_, in the large intestine of an African\r\n  native, which caused dysenteric symptoms and, more recently,\r\n  another species, _O. stephanostomum_, has been reported as causing\r\n  a fatal dysentery in a Brazilian at Manaos.\r\n\r\n  5. There have also been reported cases with dysenteric\r\n  manifestations which were apparently connected with intestinal\r\n  myiasis.\r\n\r\n=B. Dysenteries caused by bacteria.=\r\n\r\n1. Those caused by either the more toxic, nonacid mannite strain of\r\nShiga, or the less toxic, acid mannite strains of the Flexner group.\r\n\r\n2. Morgan has reported as the cause of certain bacillary dysenteries\r\na bacillus known as B. Morgan No. 1. It is motile, produces indol,\r\nand in glucose bouillon gives a very slight amount of gas. It does\r\nnot change mannite and does not produce a primary acidity in litmus\r\nmilk. This organism is a frequent cause of summer diarrhoea of\r\nchildren. Flies from houses with such cases often show Morgan’s\r\nbacillus.\r\n\r\n  Paratyphoid infections may give the clinical picture of a colitis\r\n  and such cases at times show a large amount of blood in the\r\n  dysenteric stools. Usually the symptoms are rather those of an\r\n  entero-colitis or a gastro-enteritis.\r\n\r\n3. In Japan, dysentery-like epidemics of a very fatal disease, termed\r\n_ekiri_, occur among young children. The organism is very motile,\r\nproducing gas and acid in glucose, but not in lactose media. It is\r\nreported at times to show indol production. Apparently a member of\r\nthe Gärtner group.\r\n\r\n4. Spirillar dysentery. LeDantec has reported a type of dysentery\r\nwhich shows the presence of great numbers of spiral forms. These\r\nare Gram negative and noncultivable. It is in question whether they\r\nbelong to the bacteria. There is no fever in this type of dysentery.\r\n\r\n5. Other bacterial causes. Cases of dysentery have been reported\r\nas caused by _B. pyocyaneus_, streptococci, atypical _B. coli_ and\r\norganisms of the Gärtner group.\r\n\r\n  In a _Pyocyaneus_ infection the color of the stools would be\r\n  suggestive. This cause should be borne in mind in the dysenteric\r\n  infections of debilitated children in the tropics. Some of the\r\n  cases of so-called ptomaine poisoning due to members of the Gärtner\r\n  group have clinical similarities to dysentery especially at the\r\n  commencement of the attack.\r\n\r\n=C. Dysenteries resulting from mechanical irritants or poisonous\r\nsubstances.=\r\n\r\n  A very interesting form of poisoning which gives rise to serious\r\n  illness or death and is attended with marked abdominal pain and\r\n  manifestations of dysentery is that reported from North China\r\n  through the use of short lengths of bristles which are given mixed\r\n  with the food.\r\n\r\n  Various irritant metallic poisons as arsenic, antimony and mercury\r\n  may give rise to dysenteric symptoms. In cancer and syphilis of the\r\n  rectum there may be a suspicion that the process is an ordinary\r\n  dysenteric one.\r\n\r\n  Intussusception shows marked tenesmus with bloody rather than\r\n  muco-sanguineous stools.\r\n\r\n  While dysenteric symptoms may be present in the terminal stages\r\n  of various chronic diseases, especially tuberculosis and cardiac\r\n  affections, yet it is in chronic nephritis, leading to uremia, that\r\n  we may see symptoms of a marked catarrhal or even diphtheritic\r\n  colitis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAMOEBIC DYSENTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—Lambl, in 1859, was the first one to note the presence of\r\namoebae in man, these being found in the stools of a child affected\r\nwith diarrhoea. It was Lösch, however, who, in 1875, first accurately\r\ndescribed the parasite which he found in the intestinal ulcerations\r\nas well as in the stool of a patient with chronic dysentery and was\r\nable to produce dysenteric ulcerations in the dog, by injecting\r\namoebae-containing faeces into the dog’s rectum.\r\n\r\n  In 1879 Grassi noted the encysted forms of amoebae, but as he\r\n  found them in well people, he denied their pathogenic importance.\r\n  Cunningham found amoebae in the stools of cholera patients and\r\n  Perroncito in those of typhoid cases, both of these authorities,\r\n  however, viewing the question of their pathogenicity as did Grassi.\r\n\r\n  This was the general attitude of the medical mind until Koch, in\r\n  1883, while investigating cholera in Egypt, was impressed with the\r\n  striking penetration of amoebae in the walls of intestinal ulcers\r\n  and considered that this fact favored the view that amoebae were\r\n  pathogenic.\r\n\r\n  Kartulis continued the work of Koch and in 1886 published his\r\n  findings in 150 cases of dysentery, noting the presence of amoebae\r\n  in the stools of all these cases. In 1887 he noted the presence\r\n  of amoebae in liver abscess. In 1891, Lutz noted that amoebae in\r\n  dysentery contained red cells. In the same year Councilman and\r\n  Lafleur came to the conclusion that there were two species of\r\n  amoebae in man, one harmless and the other, which was found in\r\n  the submucosa of intestinal ulcers, pathogenic, Casagrandi and\r\n  others put forward the view that amoebae only acted as carriers for\r\n  bacteria, but in 1893 Kruse and Pasquale injected all the bacterial\r\n  species isolated from a dysenteric stool into a cat’s rectum with\r\n  negative result. Hlava and Kartulis first produced dysenteric\r\n  lesions in cats by injecting per rectum, amoebic stools. Kruse\r\n  and Pasquale produced dysentery in cats by injecting per rectum\r\n  bacteria-free pus from a liver abscess which however contained\r\n  amoebae.\r\n\r\n  A stumbling block as to the connection between amoebae and\r\n  dysentery was the fact that many cases of typical dysentery failed\r\n  to show amoebae. In 1898 Shiga settled this matter by reporting\r\n  a group of bacilli which were concerned in the production of\r\n  dysentery. His findings were confirmed all over the world and the\r\n  distinction gradually obtained of cases of dysentery from bacillary\r\n  as well as from amoebic infections.\r\n\r\n  In 1903 Schaudinn reported the existence of two species of amoebae,\r\n  one harmless and named _Entamoeba coli_, the other pathogenic and\r\n  named _E. histolytica_. In 1907 Viereck described a pathogenic\r\n  amoeba which, by reason of its four nuclei in the encysted stage,\r\n  he called _E. tetragena_.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the work of Hartmann, Whitmore, Darling, Wenyon and\r\nthe recent conclusive findings of Walker we now hold the view that\r\nSchaudinn was working with _E. tetragena_ and not with a separate\r\nspecies, so that by the law of priority we must drop the name _E.\r\ntetragena_ and accept _E. histolytica_.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Amoebic dysentery seems to be\r\n  especially prevalent in Indo-China, China and the Philippines, as\r\n  well as in parts of India. It is also very common in Egypt and\r\n  Northern Africa. In South America, especially Brazil, it is common,\r\n  as is also true of the West Indies and Central America. It is an\r\n  important disease in the Southern States of the United States, as\r\n  well as in Italy and other parts of Southern Europe. On the whole\r\n  it is probable that it exists in greater or less degree in most of\r\n  the tropical and subtropical parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n  =Etiology.=—For a long time the authorities in Manila held that\r\n  it was impracticable to differentiate between a pathogenic and\r\n  nonpathogenic species, taking the view that the principal factor\r\n  in the production of dysentery was that of symbiosis between\r\n  amoebae and suitable bacteria, it having been thought that they\r\n  observed in cultures of amoebae evidences of both symbiosis and\r\n  antagonism on the part of amoebae to certain species of bacteria.\r\n  They furthermore were convinced that pathogenic amoebae could be\r\n  cultured on a medium of about 1/10th the strength of ordinary\r\n  nutrient bouillon or agar and that dysentery could be produced\r\n  by such cultural amoebae. Such views had an important bearing on\r\n  epidemiology as it was thought that where amoebae could be cultured\r\n  from green vegetables, fruit, or water supply there was positive\r\n  evidence of the possibility of infection with amoebic dysentery\r\n  from such a source.\r\n\r\nThe above views are no longer entertained and, due to Walker, working\r\nin Manila with experiments on man, we now know that cultural amoebae\r\nare without effect in the production of dysentery and that there are\r\ncertainly two well known species of amoebae having man for a host,\r\nthe one pathogenic, _Entamoeba histolytica_, and the other a harmless\r\ncommensal, _Entamoeba coli_. Two other species, _Endolimax nana_ and\r\n_Iodamoeba bütschlii_, have recently been described but are generally\r\nconsidered nonpathogenic.\r\n\r\nSome authorities prefer the generic names _Löschia_ and _Endamoeba_\r\nto _Entamoeba_.\r\n\r\nSchaudinn, in 1903, described the pathogenic amoeba, which he named\r\n_E. histolytica_, as follows: 1. Distinct, highly refractile and\r\ntenacious ectoplasm. He considered this tough external portion of\r\nthe cytoplasm as the explanation of the ability of the pathogenic\r\namoeba to bore its way into the intestinal submucosa. 2. Eccentric\r\nnucleus which was indistinct by reason of little chromatin. 3.\r\nReproduction by peripheral budding in which small aggregations of\r\nchromatin reached the periphery of the cytoplasm and, enclosed in a\r\nresistant capsule, broke off from the parent amoeba and constituted\r\nthe infecting stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.—_Entamoeba histolytica_. The same living\r\nindividual drawn at brief intervals while moving. (From Doflein after\r\nHartmann.)]\r\n\r\n  For the nonpathogenic _E. coli_ he noted: (1) No distinction\r\n  between a granular endoplasm and refractile ectoplasm; (2)\r\n  centrally placed and sharply outlined nucleus, rich in chromatin;\r\n  and (3) encystment with the formation of eight nuclei, which cysts\r\n  with their nuclei or amoebulae form the infecting stage.\r\n\r\n  The pseudopodia of _E. histolytica_ are actively projected as long\r\n  finger-like processes which show the ectoplasm quite distinctly,\r\n  while the pseudopodia of _E. coli_ are lobose and sluggishly\r\n  projected and show a uniformly opaque grayish color. In dysenteric\r\n  stools _E. histolytica_ tends to show contained red cells. _E.\r\n  coli_ never contains them but instead shows bacteria and food\r\n  particles.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Viereck and later Hartmann recognized a pathogenic amoeba\r\nwith four nuclei in its encysted form, to which was given the name\r\n_E. tetragena_.\r\n\r\n  All authorities now consider that Schaudinn made an error in\r\n  observation as to the existence of peripheral budding for _E.\r\n  histolytica_, so that we recognize but two types of encystment, one\r\n  with a larger cyst and thicker cyst wall, with eight nuclei and an\r\n  absence of chromidial bodies—_E. coli_—the other, smaller, with\r\n  a thin cyst wall one to four nuclei and chromidial bodies in the\r\n  encysted stage, the pathogenic amoeba, _E. histolytica_. Synonym,\r\n  _E. tetragena_.\r\n\r\n  In the vegetative stage the human amoebae are best differentiated\r\n  by the nuclear structure as shown in stained specimens. In _E.\r\n  coli_ the nucleus is vesicular with a thick nuclear membrane\r\n  and the chromatin chiefly deposited on the under surface of the\r\n  nuclear membrane. This chromatin often seems deposited in quadrant\r\n  aggregations. The karyosome is eccentric.\r\n\r\nFor the pathogenic amoeba we recognize a _histolytica_ type of\r\nnucleus, which is found in dysenteric stools, and a _tetragena_ type,\r\nwhich is found in diarrhoeal or more or less normal stools. Dobell\r\ndoes not recognize this differentiation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—The more important intestinal amoebae of man\r\nshowing nuclear structure when stained. 1. _E. histolytica._ 1(a).\r\n_E. histolytica_ cyst. 2. _E coli._ 2(a). _E. coli_ cyst. 3. _E.\r\nnana._ 3(a). _E. nana_ cyst. 4. _I. bütschlii._ 4(a). _I. bütschlii_\r\ncyst. (After Dobell.)]\r\n\r\n  The histolytica nucleus has a thin nuclear membrane and is poor in\r\n  chromatin while the tetragena nucleus has more chromatin, showing\r\n  radial projections from the inner surface of the nuclear membrane,\r\n  and a loose central spherical karyosome, which contains a central\r\n  chromatin dot or centriole, with a clear halo surrounding it.\r\n  Dobell states he has not been able to note this centriole.\r\n\r\nThe preëncysted _E. histolytica_ has a nucleus resembling that of _E.\r\ncoli_. The smaller size and chromidial bodies are differentiating.\r\n\r\n  Animal experimentation upon kittens with _E. coli_ by Schaudinn,\r\n  Craig and Wenyon have been unsuccessful as to production\r\n  of dysenteric manifestations. On the other hand all of\r\n  these experimenters produced typical lesions and dysenteric\r\n  manifestations in kittens injected rectally or fed with material\r\n  containing pathogenic amoebae.\r\n\r\n  Wenyon as previously stated produced a liver abscess in one of his\r\n  experiments.\r\n\r\n  Darling has been so successful in his experimental work with\r\n  kittens that he compares the colon of a kitten to a test tube and\r\n  suggests the procedure of rectal injections of material containing\r\n  amoebae as a means of differentiating the two human amoebae.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand Walker was unable to infect kittens and\r\n  monkeys with material containing pathogenic amoebae and he makes\r\n  the statement that such failures would indicate the greater\r\n  susceptibility of man to infection, as he was able to infect 17 out\r\n  of 20 men with one feeding of such material.\r\n\r\n  Sellards and Baetjer note that inoculation of kittens per rectum\r\n  or by feeding dysenteric stools rich in amoebae has resulted in\r\n  infection in about 50% of experiments.\r\n\r\n  By inoculating the material directly into the caecum they were\r\n  able to infect every one of their kittens. They were also able\r\n  to propagate a strain of amoebae through a series of animals for\r\n  several months.\r\n\r\n  The intracaecal inoculations yielded positive results in diagnosis\r\n  of human amoebiasis when the clinical manifestations were obscure\r\n  and the amoebae in the discharges so few and atypical as to make\r\n  such an examination unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n  _Other Intestinal Amoebae._—It is a remarkable fact that one of\r\n  the most common of the intestinal amoebae, _Endolimax nana_, has\r\n  only recently been reported (Wenyon and O’Conner in 1917). In the\r\n  examination of the stools of American soldiers Kofoid found it\r\n  present in 28% of his examinations while _E. coli_ was present\r\n  in 23% of cases and _E. histolytica_ in 9.3%. In examining 156\r\n  British soldiers Dobell noted its presence in 33% of them. The\r\n  general view is that it is not pathogenic but its great importance\r\n  is in the possibility of its being mistaken in its cyst form for\r\n  _E. histolytica_. The living amoeba averages about 8 microns but\r\n  in stained specimens it is somewhat smaller. In freshly passed\r\n  faeces the amoeboid motion is sluggish and the nucleus indistinct.\r\n  This amoeba is best identified by haematoxylin stained specimens\r\n  when the nucleus shows a measurement of about 2 microns with a\r\n  large eccentric karyosome which exhibits a variety of form. Unless\r\n  perfectly fresh material is stained the degenerative changes in the\r\n  amoebae may give a signet ring appearance of karyosome and ring\r\n  nucleus. Such an appearance may suggest the limax nucleus. The\r\n  mature cysts are usually oval, but sometimes round, and contain\r\n  4 nuclei, but when newly formed may only have one nucleus. The\r\n  nucleus is large in the uninucleate form (up to 3 microns) but\r\n  in the quadrinucleate forms it is about 1.2 microns with a large\r\n  eccentric mass of chromatin. Chromidial bodies are rarely, if ever,\r\n  present in these cysts.\r\n\r\n  _Iodine Cysts._—These bodies which stain a deep brown colour when\r\n  treated with iodine are now recognized as amoebae and have been\r\n  named _Iodamoeba bütschlii_. They are most probably nonpathogenic.\r\n  It is a small amoeba (9 to 13 microns, rarely up to 20 microns)\r\n  and shows the sluggish movements of _E. coli_. The nucleus is very\r\n  difficult to discern, thus differing from _E. coli_. In stained\r\n  specimens it has a vesicular nucleus about 2 microns in diameter\r\n  with a fairly large central karyosome. The cysts are spherical\r\n  or oval, often of irregular outline and are about 10 microns in\r\n  diameter. The nucleus is large and eccentrically placed and has a\r\n  karyosome which tends to show as a peripherally placed mass. There\r\n  is almost always present a large glycogen mass in the cyst which\r\n  stains intensely with iodine.\r\n\r\n  _Dientamoeba Fragilis_ (Jepps and Dobell 1918).—A rare binucleate\r\n  amoeba averaging 8-9 microns in size. Nuclei show a fairly large,\r\n  central granular karyosome and no peripheral chromatin. Strands\r\n  of linin may be seen radiating from karyosome to nuclear wall.\r\n  This organism is said to be frequently mistaken for Blastocystis\r\n  when the vacuoles coalesce leaving a thin ring of cytoplasm. Cysts\r\n  unknown. Considered nonpathogenic. Recently Kofoid and Swezy\r\n  reported another species of amoeba parasitic in man, _Councilmania\r\n  lafleuri_. The adult and cystic stages resemble in many respects\r\n  the _E. coli_. Adult said to ingest red blood cells. Stated to be\r\n  pathogenic but that more evidence is needed on this point.\r\n\r\n=Human Experiments.=—Recently Walker and Sellards have published a\r\nmost important paper.\r\n\r\nThe experiments were made in men who had been under observation\r\nfor years at Bilibid Prison, whose food was cooked and the water\r\nthey drank distilled. Moreover, there were complete records of\r\nexamination for intestinal parasites, including entamoebae. They were\r\nunder complete control and the existence or possibility of natural\r\ninfection with amoebae was reduced to a minimum. All the men fed\r\npathogenic amoebae were volunteers and each signed, in his native\r\ndialect, an agreement to the conditions of the experiment.\r\n\r\n  The first series of experiments was with cultural amoebae, in\r\n  order to refute statements that amoebae cultivated from water or\r\n  other nonparasitic sources, as well as from dysenteric stools, are\r\n  capable of living in man parasitically or of producing dysenteric\r\n  symptoms. Twenty feeding experiments on ten men were made by Walker\r\n  and Sellards with cultures of amoebae without the development in a\r\n  single instance of dysentery or the finding of such amoebae in the\r\n  stools upon microscopical examination. In 13 cases they recovered\r\n  the amoebae in cultures from the faeces from the first to the sixth\r\n  day, but never afterwards. They stated definitely that cultural\r\n  amoebae are nonpathogenic.\r\n\r\n  The next experiments were with _Entamoeba coli_. In the 20 cases\r\n  fed with material containing _Entamoeba coli_ there was a uniform\r\n  failure to recover them culturally and in no instance was dysentery\r\n  produced. Seventeen became parasitized as the result of a single\r\n  feeding in from one to eleven days, the entamoebae being found\r\n  in the stools and persisting in their appearance in the stools\r\n  for extended periods. They concluded that _Entamoeba coli_ is an\r\n  obligate parasite, nonpathogenic, and cannot be cultured.\r\n\r\n  The third series of 20 feedings, carried on by Walker alone, was\r\n  with _Entamoeba histolytica_. The material was mixed with powdered\r\n  starch or magnesium oxide and given in gelatin capsules. In these\r\n  experiments they obtained tetragena cysts in the stools of men\r\n  fed only motile _Entamoeba histolytica_, and motile _Entamoeba\r\n  histolytica_ in the stools of men who were fed only tetragena\r\n  cysts and, finally, an alternation of motile _E. histolytica_ and\r\n  tetragena cysts in the stools of a man having a recurrent attack of\r\n  amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  =Results.=—Seventeen of the men became parasitized after the first\r\n  feeding; 1 required three feedings, and 2, who did not become\r\n  parasitized at the first feeding, were held as controls. The\r\n  average time for parasitization was nine days. Only 4 of the 18\r\n  parasitized men developed dysentery, which came on after twenty,\r\n  fifty-seven, eighty-seven, and ninety-five days, respectively,\r\n  after the ingestion of the infecting material.\r\n\r\n  In 4 cases fed with material from acute dysenteric stools or\r\n  from amoebae-containing pus from liver abscess, and containing\r\n  motile amoebae, there was no resulting dysentery, the 4 cases of\r\n  experimental dysentery resulting from feeding of material from\r\n  normal stools of carriers.\r\n\r\n  As regards the cases which became parasitized, but did not develop\r\n  dysentery, it is suggested that the amoebae live as commensals in\r\n  the intestine of the host and only penetrate the intestinal mucosa\r\n  and become tissue parasites when there occurs depression of the\r\n  natural resistance of the host or as the result of some lesion of\r\n  the intestine. That the pathogenic amoebae are more than harmless\r\n  commensals, however, is shown by the fact that they alone, and not\r\n  the nonpathogenic _Entamoeba coli_, are capable of penetrating a\r\n  possibly damaged intestinal mucosa.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—The chief factor in the spread of amoebic dysentery\r\nwould seem to be the encysted amoebae in the stools of convalescents,\r\nor symptomless carriers, rather than the motile amoebae in dysenteric\r\nstools. When such carrier has to do with the preparation of food, he\r\nbecomes a particular source of danger.\r\n\r\n  This probably explains the endemic rather than the epidemic\r\n  characteristics of the spread of amoebic dysentery because, if the\r\n  innumerable vegetative amoebae in dysenteric stools were equally\r\n  operative with the more sparsely eliminated cysts, there would\r\n  be epidemics of amoebic dysentery similar to those of bacillary\r\n  dysentery. The old idea that water, fruit or vegetables, from\r\n  which one can isolate amoebae on culture, are sources of infection\r\n  must be abandoned, as such cultural amoebae are known to have no\r\n  pathogenic relation to man.\r\n\r\n  Vegetative amoebae undergo disintegration in a short time after\r\n  the stool is passed, so that they are probably rarely concerned in\r\n  amoebic infections but the resisting cysts may be washed from a\r\n  dried stool into a water supply or even be transported in dust to\r\n  lodge on unprotected foodstuffs.\r\n\r\n  Flies may possibly act as transmitting agents. As bearing on the\r\n  probable importance of such flies as _Musca domestica_ and _Fannia\r\n  canalicularis_ in transmitting amoebic infections may be noted\r\n  the findings of Wenyon that the faeces of such flies, as well as\r\n  _Lucilia_ and _Calliphora_, after feeding on cyst-containing human\r\n  faeces, teem with such cysts. In a dissection of 1027 house flies\r\n  caught in Mesopotamia Buxton found ova of parasites of man in\r\n  4.09%. The percentage of infection with _E. histolytica_ cysts was\r\n  O.3%.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nWenyon thinks that the pathogenic amoebae work their way into the\r\ntubular glands of the intestines and multiply and subsequently,\r\neither by pressure of their pseudopodia or through the disintegrating\r\naction of some toxic substance elaborated by them, they force their\r\nway into the underlying submucosa. In this location they produce a\r\ngelatinous, oedematous necrosis, which shows a marked absence of\r\npolymorphonuclears, but a proliferation of connective tissue cells.\r\nThe process is regenerative rather than inflammatory.\r\n\r\n  Small hemispherical elevations of the overlying mucosa mark\r\n  the location of the deeper-lying necrotic process. With the\r\n  multiplication of the amoebae and the extension of the necrotic\r\n  process in the submucosa we have thrombi formed in the terminals of\r\n  the portal vein and possibly in those of the mesenteric arteries,\r\n  which in the former case may result in emboli being swept up the\r\n  portal vein to lodge in the liver and form a starting point for a\r\n  similar necrosing process there or, as the result of interference\r\n  with the blood supply of the overlying mucosa, cause this to\r\n  undergo necrosis and be cast off as a slough, leaving an oval or\r\n  irregular ulcer with deeply undermined edges and a floor formed by\r\n  the muscular coat. The ulcers may be no larger than a pin’s head or\r\n  they may be 1 or 2 inches in diameter or by coalescence be still\r\n  larger. The gelatinous necrosis in the submucosa always extends\r\n  beyond the limits of the necrosis of the mucosa, thus explaining\r\n  the undermining. At times the muscular coats of the intestines are\r\n  involved thus leading to a slough which involves all coats except\r\n  the serous one. Bacterial infection, with coagulation necrosis of\r\n  the mucosa overlying the amoebic process, is also responsible for\r\n  some of the tissue destruction.\r\n\r\nThe amoebic ulcerations rarely extend above the ileo-caecal valve but\r\nmay involve the entire large intestine. Rogers and Lafleur found the\r\nlesions most often in the caecum and ascending colon, often limited\r\nto this area.\r\n\r\n  The appendix was involved in 7% of the Manila autopsies. Often mild\r\n  cases may only show lesions in the caecum. When there is a tendency\r\n  to perforation the omentum will often be drawn over to the location\r\n  of the threatened perforation. There is often thickening of the\r\n  intestine in one place with cicatricial contraction of the lumen\r\n  and thinning in another, so that there is an appearance of great\r\n  irregularity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe great majority of cases of amoebic dysentery run a chronic course\r\nwith periods of improvement alternating with recurrences of pains and\r\ndysenteric stools. From Walker’s experiments the period of incubation\r\nwould appear to be from one to three months. The onset in such cases\r\nis very insidious and the patient may complain more of diarrhoeal\r\nthan dysenteric manifestations. Such patients often give a history\r\nof passing three or four pultaceous stools daily and complain of\r\ntenderness in the region of the caecum or along the course of the\r\nlarge intestine. One may determine some thickening of the colon in a\r\nthin subject.\r\n\r\n  Fever is absent and there are very few of the toxic manifestations\r\n  which often accompany bacillary dysentery, such as headache, nausea\r\n  and a mildly delirious state. There is progressive loss of weight\r\n  and strength with the development of neurasthenic symptoms. The\r\n  skin becomes dry and earthy and we have the picture of a more or\r\n  less marked secondary anaemia. It is in these cases that we should\r\n  be on the lookout for grayish green or grayish brown mucoid masses\r\n  which can usually be found during an exacerbation. Sloughs of the\r\n  gelatinous-like necrosis in the submucosa usually contain amoebae.\r\n\r\nThe X-ray has been utilized to give location of amoebic ulcerations.\r\nBismuth is used for several days prior to taking the photograph and\r\nfills the sites of ulceration.\r\n\r\n  Such cases usually show a moderate leucocytosis in which the\r\n  percentage of large mononuclears is increased and a very\r\n  important point is that with tenderness about the caecum, plus a\r\n  leucocytosis, one may diagnose appendicitis and operate on a normal\r\n  appendix. Autopsy records however have shown that the appendix is\r\n  not infrequently invaded by amoebae but in some of these cases,\r\n  other than finding amoebae in the lumen of the appendix, I have\r\n  been unable to note any change. Cases of amoebiasis confined to\r\n  caecum and ascending colon may only show symptoms of slight anaemia.\r\n\r\nBesides the more common insidious chronic type we may have amoebic\r\ndysentery setting in quite acutely with severe griping and frequent\r\nscanty grayish green to reddish brown mucoid stools.\r\n\r\nSuch cases may show anorexia and nausea with some fever but there\r\nis not present the manifestations of toxemia one associates with a\r\nsevere case of bacillary dysentery in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  Very confusing cases are those in which a bacillary dysentery\r\n  sets in upon an amoebic one and this possibility should always be\r\n  thought of when a severe bacillary dysentery does not respond to\r\n  serum therapy or an amoebic one to emetine.\r\n\r\n  Gangrenous lesions may occur in amoebic dysentery although more\r\n  common in bacillary infections. Such cases will show extreme\r\n  prostration and even give the clinical picture of cholera.\r\n\r\n=Complications.=—By far the most important and serious complication\r\nof amoebic dysentery is liver abscess, which occurs in about 20%\r\nof cases. This condition is treated of separately. Besides liver\r\nabscess quite a number of cases of amoebic abscess of the brain\r\nhave been reported, 26 such cases occurring in Egypt alone. These\r\nabscesses almost always occur in those cases which have developed\r\nliver abscess and may appear after the liver abscess has healed.\r\n\r\n  The pus of such abscesses is viscid and blood-tinged, resembling\r\n  liver abscess pus. The amoebae are found in the abscess wall.\r\n  The symptoms are those of brain tumor, meningitis not occurring.\r\n  Necrotic processes of skin and muscles have also been reported in\r\n  which amoebae have been found.\r\n\r\n  Perforation of the large intestine is not rare, Strong having noted\r\n  12 perforations in 77 autopsies. These usually occur in the region\r\n  of the sigmoid flexure.\r\n\r\n  Adhesions are common complications of amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—In the clinical diagnosis it is well to\r\nremember that many cases of chronic tropical diarrhoeas are really\r\ndue to amoebic ulcerations of the intestines.\r\n\r\n  We can as a rule differentiate bacillary from amoebic dysentery by\r\n  the more sudden and acute onset of the former together with fever\r\n  and other evidences of toxaemia. The pulse rate is more rapid in\r\n  bacillary than amoebic dysentery. Again the number of stools in\r\n  bacillary dysentery is usually greater and the amount of each\r\n  stool less in quantity. The stool of bacillary dysentery is of a\r\n  milky whiteness from the large number of pus cells or composed\r\n  of gelatinous, reddish mucus, while that of amoebic dysentery is\r\n  tinged with disintegrated blood giving it a grayish-green or brown\r\n  color. The mucopurulent mass in bacillary dysentery may be flecked\r\n  or streaked with blood. The therapeutic results following emetine\r\n  injections are of value in diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  Gangrenous types of dysentery are similar whether due to bacillary\r\n  or amoebic infection. Chronic dysentery of bacillary origin is much\r\n  like amoebic dysentery clinically.\r\n\r\n  Manson-Bahr and Gregg recommend the use of the sigmoidoscope in\r\n  the diagnosis of chronic amoebic ulcerations. In the evening the\r\n  patient takes ½ ounce of castor oil and the next morning a soap and\r\n  water enema is given followed by 15 minims of laudanum. The patient\r\n  is put in the lithotomy position. No anaesthetic is used. The pain\r\n  in introducing the instrument is greater in chronic bacillary\r\n  ulceration cases than in amoebic ones. Scrapings can be made for\r\n  microscopic examinations. Nisbet has reported the diagnosis of a\r\n  case of balantidial ulceration by use of the sigmoidoscope.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—The mucoid mass of amoebic dysentery is\r\noften brownish. The pathogenic amoeba shows active finger-like\r\nprocesses and in acute attacks often shows contained red cells.\r\nIn the fresh specimen of the milky mucopurulent mass of bacillary\r\ndysentery one observes large numbers of pus cells and particularly\r\nvery large phagocytic cells which greatly resemble amoebae. Upon\r\nstaining with Gram’s stain one may find numerous Gram-negative\r\nbacilli in the cytoplasm of this cell.\r\n\r\n  These large cells which resemble amoebae are often vacuolated, thus\r\n  intensifying the similarity. They are nonmotile, however, and do\r\n  not show the small ring nucleus which is so characteristic of the\r\n  vegetative human amoebae. The nucleus of the confusing cells is\r\n  also larger, approximating one-fourth the size of the cell.\r\n\r\n  Bacillary dysentery stools show an absence of Charcot-Leyden\r\n  crystals which are often present with amoebic stools.\r\n\r\n  For bringing out the nuclear characteristics of human amoebae\r\n  Walker recommends fixation of thin moist smears in Giemsa’s\r\n  sublimate alcohol (absolute alcohol 1 part, sat. aq. sol.\r\n  bichloride 2 parts) for 10 to 15 minutes. These smears are then\r\n  well washed with water and stained with alum haematoxylin for five\r\n  minutes. The nuclear characteristics are noted under etiology. In\r\n  such staining the preparations, which are best made on cover-slips,\r\n  should never be allowed to become dry.\r\n\r\nAn excellent iron haematoxylin method is that of Rosenbusch:\r\n\r\n  Rapidly smear out with a toothpick a small particle of faeces or\r\n  other material containing protozoa and, while still moist, fix by\r\n  Giemsa’s method and, after getting rid of the mercury with iodine\r\n  solution followed by 95% alcohol, treat smears with a 3.5% solution\r\n  of iron-alum in distilled water for one-half hour or overnight,\r\n  then wash thoroughly in distilled water.\r\n\r\n  Then stain from five to twenty minutes in the following\r\n  haematoxylin stain: (1) 1% solution of haematoxylin in 95% alcohol.\r\n  It takes at least ten days to ripen. (2) A saturated solution of\r\n  lithium carbonate. Add to 10 cc. of the haematoxylin solution\r\n  5 to 6 drops of the lithium carbonate one. Next wash well and\r\n  differentiate with about 1% solution of the iron-alum. Again wash\r\n  in water, pass through alcohols to xylol and mount in balsam. With\r\n  vegetative amoebae I have obtained beautiful results with vital\r\n  staining which can best be done by tinging the faeces emulsion with\r\n  a 1% aqueous solution of neutral red. I have also had good results\r\n  by emulsifying the faeces in a drop of 1 or 2% formalin and then\r\n  adding a drop of 2% acetic acid. The mixture is then tinged with\r\n  either neutral red or methyl green.\r\n\r\n  For distinguishing the encysted form of _Entamoeba coli_ one can\r\n  obtain excellent results by emulsifying the faeces in Gram’s iodine\r\n  solution. Owing to the glycogenic reaction given by _E. coli_, the\r\n  round amoeba, with its 8 nuclei stands out very distinctly.\r\n\r\nFor diagnosing the 4-nucleated cyst of the pathogenic amoeba one\r\ngets better results with haematoxylin as this brings out not only\r\nthe 4 nuclei but the chromidial bodies as well. It was formerly\r\ncustomary to recommend the administration of salts prior to examining\r\nfor amoebae. Walker warns that such a procedure gives us amoebae\r\nwhich are difficult to differentiate, the nuclear characteristics of\r\n_E. coli_ and the tetragena nucleus of _E. histolytica_ being much\r\nalike as they both contain much chromatin. In a dysenteric stool the\r\nhistolytica type of nucleus, containing but little chromatin, does\r\nnot resemble the nucleus of _E. coli_.\r\n\r\nHe prefers the examination of formed stools obtained without a\r\npurgative.\r\n\r\n  DIFFERENTIATING CHARACTERISTICS OF PATHOGENIC AMOEBAE\r\n  (AFTER DOBELL AND O’CONNOR).

In\r\n  opposition to the usual recommendation of text-books to report\r\n  only on motile amoebae, he recommends the making of a differential\r\n  diagnosis on nonmotile encysted forms. This however is now\r\n  generally accepted by experienced workers as true.\r\n\r\nThe preëncysted _E. histolytica_ has a nucleus much resembling that\r\nof _E. coli_. The presence of the same chromidial bodies one notes\r\nin the cysts is an aid in recognizing this stage. The 4 nuclei of\r\nthe cysts are much smaller than the nucleus of the preëncysted or\r\nvegetative stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The main consideration is a knowledge of the\r\nimportance of the carrier problem. The stools of all persons\r\npreparing food in localities where amoebic dysentery is prevalent\r\nshould therefore be examined for the 4-nucleated cyst of the\r\npathogenic amoeba. It must be remembered that while emetine controls\r\nthe dysenteric manifestations of amoebiasis it does not seem to cause\r\nthe disappearance of the parasite, so that patients who have had\r\namoebic dysentery tend to become carriers.\r\n\r\n  As a matter of fact there is a question as to the possibility\r\n  of the emetine treatment acting as a factor for the increase of\r\n  carriers.\r\n\r\n  Vedder considers that while emetine will kill the amoebae deeply\r\n  placed in the submucosa it has no effect on the more superficially\r\n  located cysts and suggests that it may be possible to treat\r\n  carriers by colonic irrigations with quinine or silver salts.\r\n\r\n  Emetine bismuth iodide has recently been highly recommended as our\r\n  best agent for eradication of _E. histolytica_ cysts of carriers.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—The emetine treatment may now be considered as the\r\nspecific one for amoebic dysentery. In Brazilian ipecac about\r\n72% of the total alkaloids is emetine, so that it is better than\r\nCarthagena ipecac which contains only about 40% of emetine. Emetine\r\nwas recommended for dysentery as long ago as 1817, but owing to\r\nthe impossibility of differentiating between bacillary and amoebic\r\ndysentery, until recently, this method of treatment was little\r\nadvocated.\r\n\r\n  In 1910 Vedder found that emetine was practically without power in\r\n  its action on dysentery bacilli but that it would kill amoebae,\r\n  even in dilutions of 1 to 100,000. He also found that deëmetized\r\n  ipecac was quite inert in its action on amoebae.\r\n\r\n  In 1912, Rogers, who had for years been an ardent advocate of\r\n  the ipecac treatment of amoebiasis, took up the treatment of\r\n  amoebic dysentery and its liver complications with emetine.\r\n  Reports from all over the world now attest the value of this drug\r\n  in the treatment of the acute manifestations of amoebiasis but\r\n  unfortunately note the inefficacy of this treatment on the encysted\r\n  forms of amoebae.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to give from ⅓ to ⅔ grain of emetine hydrochloride,\r\ndissolved in sterile saline, by hypodermic injection into the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues. Some now give as high as 1 grain daily for\r\nabout ten days, but Vedder prefers ⅓ grain repeated 3 times daily. In\r\nthese doses there is practically no nausea.\r\n\r\n  It was found by Baermann and Heinemann that subcutaneous injections\r\n  of from 2 to 2½ grains daily caused indisposition and anorexia. The\r\n  subcutaneous injections are less painful than the intramuscular\r\n  ones.\r\n\r\n  Rogers has used emetine intravenously in doses of 1 grain without\r\n  bad effect.\r\n\r\n  Vedder calls attention to the fact that the minimal fatal dose\r\n  of emetine is several times less when administered to rabbits\r\n  intravenously than when given subcutaneously, so that after seeing\r\n  rabbits die with what was apparently centric paralysis immediately\r\n  after intravenous doses of comparatively small amounts of emetine\r\n  hydrochloride he would hesitate before administering 1 grain\r\n  intravenously in a human case.\r\n\r\n  Levy and Rowntree think emetine should not be given intravenously\r\n  except in extreme cases. Among ill effects of emetine they note\r\n  peripheral neuritis. Kilgore has reported such cases where even\r\n  wrist-drop was seen.\r\n\r\n  Low has treated cases successfully with keratin-coated tabloids of\r\n  emetine hydrochloride, giving ½ grain every night. Vedder has not\r\n  obtained satisfactory results with the drug by mouth.\r\n\r\nRogers considers that 15 grains of emetine is the fatal dose for\r\nan adult man and as there is possibly a cumulative action it would\r\nseem safer to continue the drug only for ten days and then later\r\nrepeat the course of hypodermics. Of course emetine cannot cure the\r\nulcerative lesions of amoebic colitis and as bacillary infections\r\nare apt to set in when damaged tissues are present and, as such\r\ninfections do not yield to emetine, one must be prepared for failure\r\nin treatment of symptoms in such cases.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the great importance of immediate treatment to prevent\r\nextension of the ulcerative process, as well as against abscess, the\r\nrule was adopted in the medical care of the English forces, in the\r\nMediterranean, to give emetine so soon as a case of dysentery was\r\nseen, not waiting for a determination of etiology. The treatment\r\nordered was 1 grain of emetine, hypodermically, every day for ten\r\ndays, or ½ grain morning and evening for ten days. There must not be\r\nany intermission of a single day.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of emetine the usual treatment was with\r\nipecac.\r\n\r\n  It was customary to give 20 to 50 grains of powdered ipecac in\r\n  capsule, cachet or keratin-coated pills to a patient with an empty\r\n  stomach and who had had a dose of morphine or laudanum about 20\r\n  minutes before the time for giving the ipecac. The salol-coated\r\n  ipecac pills are generally used in America. The patient should be\r\n  in bed and should try to yield to the soporific influences of the\r\n  opiate. Any flow of saliva should be removed with gauze as its\r\n  swallowing would provoke nausea. Some use a mustard poultice to the\r\n  epigastrium. It is remarkable the change which this treatment will\r\n  effect in the number and character of the stools.\r\n\r\n  Many now think it advisable to give emetine hypodermically to reach\r\n  the amoebae deeply seated and, at the same time, to give ipecac by\r\n  mouth to destroy more superficially situated ones, or those in the\r\n  lumen of the gut. Alcresta ipecac has been recommended as a good\r\n  method of giving ipecac by mouth.\r\n\r\n  We do not have now the same confidence in emetine injections that\r\n  we formerly entertained. In Egypt the combination of emetine\r\n  injections with ½ grain keratin coated tablets of emetine by\r\n  mouth seemed to give better results in the more chronic stages of\r\n  amoebiasis.\r\n\r\nVery favorable reports have come from the use of emetine bismuthous\r\niodide. This drug is given by mouth in doses not exceeding 3 grains\r\nin a day. It is put up in gelatine capsules and a course of treatment\r\nis one 3 grain capsule each night for 12 nights. It is supposed that\r\nthere is no action on the drug in the stomach as it is insoluble in\r\ndilute acid but as a matter of fact nausea and vomiting frequently\r\noccur and slight purging is common after its administration. During\r\nthe twelve-day course of treatment the patient should remain in bed\r\nand be given a milk diet.\r\n\r\nWe have recently had success with the administration of ipecac by the\r\nduodenal tube and it might be that bismuthous emetine iodide could be\r\ngiven in the same way.\r\n\r\nRoss thinks that the flushing action of salines, thus washing away\r\namoebae and necrotic material, is of advantage in amoebic as well as\r\nin bacillary dysentery. He also thinks liquid petrolatum of value.\r\nSome advise the bismuth treatment recommended by Deeks of giving a\r\nlarge teaspoonful of bismuth subnitrate, in a glass of water, 3 or 4\r\ntimes during the day.\r\n\r\nA decoction made by boiling for 15 minutes one teaspoonful of\r\npowdered chaparro in 8 ounces of water and given one-half hour before\r\neach meal has been reported on favorably. The powdered roots, stems\r\nand leaves of “Chaparro amargosa” are used. This is a plant of Texas\r\nand is named _Castela nicholsoni_. A decoction of about one-half\r\nstrength of that taken by mouth is recommended for enemata. Simaruba\r\nbark is recommended by some practitioners. Its action is similar to\r\nchaparro. Benzyl benzoate is recommended for the pains and tenesmus\r\nof amoebic dysentery as well as bacillary dysentery. Twenty drops of\r\nthe 20% alcoholic solution are given three times daily.\r\n\r\n  Many drugs have been recommended for colon irrigation of which the\r\n  favorite is probably quinine muriate in dilution of 1 to 1000 or 1\r\n  to 2500. Inject 2 or 3 pints slowly by gravity. Protargol in 1 to\r\n  500 solution is better than silver nitrate in 1 to 2000. Emetine\r\n  enemata do not seem to be of much value.\r\n\r\nIn very serious cases, particularly when gangrenous change in\r\nthe mucosa may be present, the operation of appendicostomy seems\r\nindicated, following which a catheter is inserted and the large\r\nintestine irrigated with a 1% solution of bicarbonate of soda to wash\r\naway the mucus and later with a boracic acid solution of 1 to 125 or\r\n1 to 10,000 of potassium permanganate.\r\n\r\n  In a discussion as to certain surgical considerations in connection\r\n  with appendicostomy Muller notes that the right rectus incision\r\n  is to be avoided on account of danger of gangrene from pressure\r\n  of rectus on the stitched-up appendix. He also thinks that\r\n  appendicostomy is much safer than caecostomy on account of the\r\n  frequent thinning of the walls of the caecum. For irrigation he\r\n  prefers a 1 to 500 solution of collargol.\r\n\r\n  In treating dysentery cases rest in bed and the use of a\r\n  nonirritating diet are advisable.\r\n\r\n  The return of the increase of large mononuclears to normal may be\r\n  used as an index to cure.\r\n\r\nWalker and Emrich have recently reported success in treatment of cyst\r\ncarriers by giving oil of chenopodium in 3 hourly doses of 16 minims,\r\nfollowed by castor oil and preceded by a dose of magnesium sulphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLIVER ABSCESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—Although Hippocrates noted the method of evacuating\r\nabscess of the liver by caustics there was very little known about\r\nthe condition until during the last century.\r\n\r\nThe history in connection with the finding of amoebae in liver\r\nabscesses is of very recent date (1887) and is taken up under the\r\nhistory of amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n=Geographical Distribution.=—Concisely one may state that the\r\ndistribution of liver abscess is in relation to the existence of\r\namoebic dysentery. It is particularly prevalent in those centers\r\nof amoebic infection where there are many white men having little\r\nknowledge of the conditions necessary for the maintenance of health\r\nin the tropics.\r\n\r\n  In liver abscess, as with blackwater fever, it is education rather\r\n  than acclimatization that brings about a diminution of these\r\n  tropical diseases.\r\n\r\n  For several years subsequent to the American occupation of the\r\n  Philippines amoebic dysentery and liver abscess were common but in\r\n  more recent years liver abscess has become rare in Americans and\r\n  amoebic dysentery much reduced in prevalence.\r\n\r\n  More temperate living results in less storing up of fat in the\r\n  liver and an organ more resistant to infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The dislodgment of amoebae-containing material from\r\namoebic intestinal ulcerations and the plugging of the portal\r\ncapillaries by such emboli give us the starting point of a liver\r\nabscess. The exciting cause is _Entamoeba histolytica_ which in the\r\nliver continues the same production of a gelatinous necrosis as is\r\ncarried on in the submucosa of the large intestine or appendix.\r\n\r\nThis pathogenic amoeba is fully described under amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  As to obtaining a history of amoebic dysentery in liver abscess\r\n  cases we have the following statistics:\r\n\r\n  500 cases with dysentery findings in 60%   (Kartulis).\r\n  444 cases with dysentery findings in 59%   (Zancarol).\r\n  500 cases with dysentery findings in 85%   (Kelsch and Kiener).\r\n   63 cases with dysentery findings in 90.5% (Rogers).\r\n   38 cases with dysentery findings in 85%   (Seamen’s hospital\r\n                                                autopsies).\r\n\r\n  Amoebic liver abscess is exceedingly rare among children and\r\n  probably 10 times less common among women than men.\r\n\r\nOf 40 cases of liver abscess Waring noted intemperance in 67.5% and\r\nauthorities generally insist upon the importance of the abuse of\r\nalcohol as a predisposing factor.\r\n\r\n  Natives of India very rarely develop liver abscess but it has been\r\n  noted that when they begin to follow the customs of Europeans, as\r\n  to eating and drinking, such lesions become more common in them.\r\n\r\n  As to the proportion of cases of amoebic dysentery which give\r\n  rise to liver abscess only the statistics of those who have\r\n  differentiated between bacillary and amoebic dysentery are of any\r\n  value. Such statistics would indicate that about 20% of the cases\r\n  of amoebic dysentery are complicated by liver abscess.\r\n\r\n  Liver abscess may be present without demonstrable lesions in the\r\n  large intestines, such lesions having healed or the intestinal\r\n  involvement having been so slight as not to have caused other than\r\n  microscopic changes.\r\n\r\n  It is a well-known fact that liver abscess may set in years after a\r\n  patient has left the tropics and years after the occurrence of any\r\n  dysenteric manifestations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThere seems little doubt but that the amoebae in the thrombosed\r\nterminals of the portal vein are carried by way of the upward current\r\ninto the liver where they lodge in the liver capillaries, Councilman\r\nand Lafleur having found amoebae in such emboli.\r\n\r\n  Another view is that the amoebae may wander across the abdominal\r\n  cavity and enter the liver in this way. This seems as improbable as\r\n  that view which considers a possible entrance by way of the bile\r\n  duct. Bile is toxic to amoebae and it would be difficult to explain\r\n  their presence in the small intestines.\r\n\r\n  In 639 cases Roux found the abscess in the right lobe in 70% of the\r\n  cases.\r\n\r\n  Other statistics give about 75% for the right lobe, 10% for the\r\n  left lobe, 4% for the lobus Spigelii and in about 10% of cases\r\n  abscesses are found in both right and left lobes.\r\n\r\nIn 562 cases Zancarol found a single abscess in 60% of the cases.\r\n\r\nIn 288 cases Waring found a single abscess in 61.5%, double abscesses\r\nin 11.5% and multiple abscesses in 27%. The favorite site of liver\r\nabscess is the superior and posterior part of the right lobe and near\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\n  The abscesses vary enormously in size, some being no larger\r\n  than a walnut while others may contain a quart or more of pus,\r\n  exceptionally as much as a gallon. The pus is typically of a\r\n  chocolate color and contains degenerated liver cells, granular\r\n  débris and often haematoidin and Charcot-Leyden crystals. There is\r\n  an absence of polymorphonuclears. It may however be creamy in color.\r\n\r\n  In Strong’s cases about 50% of the abscesses showed bacteria upon\r\n  culturing, the organisms noted being staphylococci, streptococci,\r\n  _B. coli_ and _B. pyocyaneus_.\r\n\r\n  The walls of liver abscesses are rather shaggy and the amoebae are\r\n  found deeply located.\r\n\r\n  It is probable that the necrotic process, set up by the amoebae,\r\n  begins in the interlobular capillaries although it may at times\r\n  begin within the lobule.\r\n\r\nMicroscopically, the necrotic abscess wall shows amoebae in its\r\ndepths but necrosis of the surrounding tissue beyond the zone of\r\nthe amoebae is noticeable which would suggest the elimination\r\nby the amoebae of some toxic substance. There is an absence of\r\npolymorphonuclear infiltration around the abscess.\r\n\r\n  Surrounding the abscess wall there is a zone of marked hyperaemia.\r\n  Amoebae may be found in this area as well as in the abscess wall.\r\n\r\n  If the liver abscess is not treated by emetine or with this drug\r\n  and some surgical procedure the tendency is for rupture to occur\r\n  and Cyr’s statistics show that of 159 cases rupture occurred\r\n  as follows: lungs 59, pleural cavity 31, peritoneal cavity 39,\r\n  intestines 8, stomach 8, vena cava 3, kidneys 2, bile ducts 4,\r\n  pericardium 1 and externally 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nAlthough the statistics would indicate that a history of amoebic\r\ndysentery has been obtained in only from 60 to 90% of cases of liver\r\nabscess, yet, when we consider that amoebic lesions of the large\r\nintestines have been frequently noted at autopsy in those who had\r\nnever shown symptoms of dysentery during life, we are forced to\r\nbelieve that amoebic lesions of the appendix or large intestines are\r\nnecessary factors in the production of liver abscess. Consequently, a\r\nhistory of amoebic dysentery is one of the most important points to\r\nconsider in the making of a diagnosis of tropical liver abscess.\r\n\r\n  =Tropical Liver.=—There is also much evidence to be obtained from\r\n  statistics and otherwise to support the view that the amoebic\r\n  infection of the liver is only possible in a person whose liver\r\n  has been functionally impaired. To this condition the designation\r\n  tropical congestion of the liver or simply tropical liver has been\r\n  applied. There is much to support the view that, in the tropics,\r\n  the intestines and liver take the place of the thoracic organs\r\n  in being subject to congestion. In temperate climates excesses\r\n  and exposure to debilitating influences result in coryza or\r\n  pneumonia. In the tropics we have diarrhoea and congestion of the\r\n  liver. Tropical liver is recognized by vague digestive troubles,\r\n  high-colored urine, loss of energy, irritability, with a sensation\r\n  of fullness in the region of the liver which is generally described\r\n  by the patient’s statement that he feels his liver. There may be\r\n  pain referred to the right shoulder and the liver may be tender on\r\n  palpation.\r\n\r\nBy the discontinuance of alcohol and highly spiced foods, with\r\ntreatment by phosphate of soda or sodium sulphate, together with\r\ngeneral care of the health, the patient may recover completely.\r\n\r\n  Rogers recognizes a condition which he terms the _pre-suppurative\r\n  stage of amoebic hepatitis_ in which the amoebae from dysenteric\r\n  lesions have lodged in the portal terminals of the liver but in\r\n  which abscess formation has not taken place.\r\n\r\n  At this stage we have a leucocytosis in which the\r\n  polymorphonuclears are but little increased in percentage with a\r\n  low remittent fever. At this time Rogers considers that the disease\r\n  may be cured by emetine or ipecac and liver abscess avoided.\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case of Liver Abscess.=—Following a case of amoebic\r\ndysentery, during the period of convalescence or subsequently, a\r\nrather irregular type of fever is noted, which shows an evening rise\r\nwith sweatings which tend to become colliquative. From a marked\r\nfeeling of weight in the region of the liver there may later develop\r\ntenderness or pain upon palpation of the liver. Of importance is\r\nthe fact that there is no associated splenic enlargement. In the\r\nmajority of cases the right side of the liver enlarges in an upward\r\ndirection. A tape-measure will often show enlargement of the right\r\nside. Pain referred to the right shoulder is often complained of when\r\nthe abscess is located in the upper convex part of the liver but,\r\nwhen nearer the inferior concave surface, there may be pain referred\r\nto the region of the appendix. When located in the left lobe the\r\nsymptoms may be considered as of gastric origin.\r\n\r\nThe upward enlargement of the liver as shown by X-rays is of great\r\nvalue in diagnosis, but an abscess located in the center of the liver\r\nis not indicated by such rays.\r\n\r\nThere is a marked tendency to splint the liver so that the patient\r\ntends to lie towards the right side and when walking applies his\r\nright arm and forearm to his side, which led Koch to remark, “It is\r\nas if he carried his abscess under his arm.” The right rectus often\r\nshows rigidity.\r\n\r\nAuscultation of the base of the right lung reveals a moist\r\ncrepitation which, together with a dry cough (tussis hepatica),\r\nthe fever, evening sweats, anaemia and emaciation, may suggest\r\ntuberculosis. The respirations are shallow as deep inspiration tends\r\nto cause pain. It must be remembered that cases of liver abscess\r\nhave been reported where there were practically no symptoms.\r\n\r\n  Insomnia is a marked feature in many cases. Jaundice is rare,\r\n  but an earthy color or subicteroid tinging is often noted. The\r\n  superficial veins may be enlarged.\r\n\r\n  The urine is scanty and high-coloured, frequently with a marked\r\n  increase in the ammonia nitrogen. Urobilin may be present in\r\n  considerable amount.\r\n\r\nThere is a rather constant but low leucocytosis of from 12 to 20\r\nthousand, which shows only about 70% of polymorphonuclears with an\r\nincrease in large mononuclears up to 10 to 15%.\r\n\r\nThe final proof is the obtaining of the chocolate-coloured or anchovy\r\nsauce-like pus by exploratory puncture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—Temperature chart of liver abscess.]\r\n\r\n  This pus does not contain pus cells but only granular débris,\r\n  cholesterin crystals and is often bacteriologically sterile. The\r\n  amoebae, being in the abscess wall, are not apt to be found when\r\n  pus is at first withdrawn. Owing to the tendency of liver abscess\r\n  to rupture into the lungs the first indication of the true nature\r\n  of a prolonged hectic fever may be obtained when the characteristic\r\n  pus is expectorated by the patient.\r\n\r\n  Attended with progressive emaciation and exhaustion the patient,\r\n  as a rule, after a prolonged illness, dies, unless operative\r\n  procedures cure him or some intercurrent disease brings about his\r\n  death.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _Onset and the Fever Chart._—The onset is at times so insidious\r\n  that there may be no symptoms and yet a liver abscess be found at\r\n  autopsy. Usually following convalescence after amoebic dysentery an\r\n  irregular fever sets in which becomes hectic in character. Profuse\r\n  sweats accompany the evening rise. The morning temperature is\r\n  frequently normal and there may be frequent apyretic intervals.\r\n\r\n  _The Respiratory System._—Crepitation at the right base, a dry\r\n  cough (tussis hepatica) and shallow respirations are features of\r\n  the disease.\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—Pains in the right shoulder are connected\r\n  with irritation of the branches of the phrenic nerve.\r\n\r\n  The patient is irritable and often complains of insomnia.\r\n\r\n  The right rectus tends to be somewhat rigid and decubitus is dorsal\r\n  or toward the right side.\r\n\r\n  _The Liver and Spleen._—The liver is tender and as the abscess in\r\n  nine-tenths of the cases is located in the right lobe and generally\r\n  toward the upper convex surface we have an enlargement upward.\r\n  There is very rarely any jaundice.\r\n\r\n  The urine shows an excess of urobilin and of nitrogen eliminated\r\n  as ammonia. When the abscess is in the left lobe the condition is\r\n  apt to be considered as some gastric disturbance. The spleen, as a\r\n  rule, shows no enlargement.\r\n\r\n  _Examination of the Blood._—There is usually a moderate\r\n  leucocytosis with normal polymorphonuclear percentage and increase\r\n  in the large mononuclears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—Liver abscess. X-ray photograph taken from\r\nthe side and showing upward enlargement of liver. (Ruge and zur Verth\r\nafter Béclére.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—Of greatest importance is a history of a\r\nprevious dysentery although it must be remembered that liver abscess\r\nmay appear in one who has never had dysenteric symptoms. Fever\r\nof a hectic type with crepitation at right base, pain and upward\r\nenlargement of the liver are most significant.\r\n\r\n  The X-ray may confirm the diagnosis of upward enlargement which may\r\n  be as high as the angle of the scapula. The majority of conditions\r\n  causing enlargement of the liver give a downward enlargement.\r\n\r\nThe amelioration of symptoms by giving emetine hypodermically for two\r\nor three days is diagnostically exceedingly important.\r\n\r\n  Syphilitic gummata may give the picture of liver abscess,\r\n  especially as regards the fever and loss of weight. Iodide of\r\n  potash is said to be of use in differentiating, as it controls the\r\n  fever of syphilis. The gummatous enlargement, however, is irregular\r\n  and projects downward.\r\n\r\n  Suppurative pylephlebitis generally arises from infections of the\r\n  colon or appendix. This condition as well as pyaemic (multiple)\r\n  abscesses of the liver is apt to show jaundice.\r\n\r\n  In suppurative cholangitis and cholecystitis we get a history of\r\n  biliary colic, jaundice and usually a marked point of tenderness\r\n  at the tip of the ninth rib and a tumor in the region of the gall\r\n  bladder. Abscess of the left lobe may give the symptoms of gastric\r\n  trouble.\r\n\r\n  In differentiating empyema we usually have a history of pleurisy or\r\n  pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  Suppurating hydatid cyst which may be confused with liver abscess\r\n  is most surely differentiated by finding echinococcus hooklets.\r\n\r\n  Then too the complement fixation test for hydatid disease will\r\n  differentiate.\r\n\r\n  Tuberculosis is often thought of, particularly when a liver\r\n  abscess ruptures through the lungs. Malaria is also usually\r\n  suspected. Abscess in the kidney or perinephritic region may be\r\n  very confusing. In an abscess of the abdominal wall an exploring\r\n  needle does not move up and down with respiration as it does when\r\n  penetrating a liver abscess cavity.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—The chocolate-colored pus of a liver\r\nabscess, when there has been no bacterial contamination, shows an\r\nabsence of polymorphonuclears and does not at first show amoebae.\r\nThese appear in the pus coming from the drainage tube about the\r\nthird day. Cholesterin and haematoidin crystals may be found in the\r\ngranular débris of a fresh drop of pus used for examination for\r\namoebae.\r\n\r\nLiver abscess usually shows a moderate leucocytosis with a normal\r\npolymorphonuclear percentage and an increase of large mononuclears\r\nand transitionals to about 12 to 20%.\r\n\r\n  According to Schilling-Torgau we may have a perfectly normal white\r\n  count and polymorphonuclear percentage and yet have evidence of the\r\n  presence of liver abscess in his modification of Arneth’s index, so\r\n  that in an apparently normal differential count we may find that\r\n  ½ or more of the polymorphonuclears are of a less mature type and\r\n  in cases where there are many immature polymorphonuclears we have\r\n  indications which force a very cautious or unfavorable prognosis.\r\n\r\n  Thus a differential count of 33% band-form polymorphonuclears\r\n  and 39% of normal nucleated ones would make us give a cautious\r\n  prognosis, while one with 1% myelocytes, 22.5% immature\r\n  polymorphonuclears, 21% band-form nucleated ones and 30% of normal\r\n  ones would make for a very bad prognosis. We have a displacement to\r\n  the left. Normally there are 63% of normal polymorphonuclears, 4%\r\n  of band-form and no immature ones or myelocytes.\r\n\r\n  One may find an iodophilia in liver abscess.\r\n\r\n  Of the functional liver tests we may determine the ammonia\r\n  quotient, the percentage of N eliminated as ammonia being increased\r\n  in abscess of the liver. The same is true of the lipase test.\r\n  Probably the most specific test for disturbances of the hepatic\r\n  function is that for urobilinogen. The test is made by adding 5 to\r\n  10 drops of Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagent to 5 cc. of perfectly fresh\r\n  urine when a positive reaction gives a fine cherry-red color.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The prophylaxis is the same as that for amoebic\r\ndysentery plus avoidance of anything which reduces the functional\r\npower of the liver, such as overfeeding, alcoholic excesses, etc.\r\n\r\n  It is well to remember that abscesses may occur months or even two\r\n  or three years after an attack of amoebic dysentery, consequently\r\n  it is well to give a grain of emetine on two or three successive\r\n  days of each month following an acute attack.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—Leaving out of consideration the pre-suppurative stage\r\nof amoebic hepatitis which, according to many authorities, responds\r\nto injections of emetine, it may be stated that the treatment of\r\nliver abscess is entirely surgical and such treatment should be\r\ninstituted the moment the diagnosis is made. The earlier a liver\r\nabscess is drained the less run down will be the patient, the more\r\nrapid the convalescence and the better the prognosis.\r\n\r\n  Until recently surgical authorities condemned severely the trocar\r\n  and cannula method of operation, but with the introduction of\r\n  emetine there are now those who believe that such a procedure may\r\n  suffice and a more radical operation not be necessitated.\r\n\r\n  Prior to introducing the trocar and cannula the usual procedure\r\n  is to use an aspirating needle of about ⅛ inch bore and 3½ inch\r\n  length. If the needle happens to be longer it should not be passed\r\n  deeper than 3½ inches, in a person with a 32-inch chest, in order\r\n  surely to avoid the vena cava. If there are no distinct localizing\r\n  signs the needle should first be introduced in the eighth or ninth\r\n  interspaces in the anterior axillary line and pushed backward,\r\n  inward and slightly upward. Manson recommends at least 6 punctures\r\n  before abandoning exploration. Cantlie does not think that a\r\n  moderate degree of haemorrhage from the puncture of the liver will\r\n  do harm in a case which is simply a liver congestion. One should\r\n  always be ready to operate in case pus be found in the exploring\r\n  needle. Leaving the needle in situ a small skin incision is made\r\n  and a 4 or 5 inch by ⅜ inch trocar and cannula introduced along\r\n  the line of the needle. Withdrawing the trocar some of the pus is\r\n  allowed to escape through the cannula and there is then introduced\r\n  a 6 × ½ inch piece of strong rubber drainage tubing, one end of\r\n  which has lateral fenestrations but a closed tip in order that a\r\n  long steel pin may put the tubing on the stretch so that it passes\r\n  the smaller lumen of the cannula.\r\n\r\n  The cannula is then slipped out over the tubing and the external\r\n  stretched end of the tubing released so that the contracting rubber\r\n  fills the puncture. The steel pin used for introducing the rubber\r\n  tube is then withdrawn and the tubing transfixed close to the skin\r\n  with a safety pin.\r\n\r\n  After the cavity has drained of pus a dressing is applied. There\r\n  are some who advocate aspiration alone without subsequent drainage.\r\n  The dressing should be changed frequently and a connecting tube,\r\n  draining into an antiseptic-containing bottle, should be attached\r\n  to the tube in the cavity in order to obtain a syphoning action.\r\n  Some aspirate and inject into the cavity about 2 ounces of 1 to\r\n  1000 emetine solution.\r\n\r\n  Some report favorably from the use of 1 to 1000 quinine\r\n  irrigations. At present the hypodermic use of emetine will probably\r\n  obviate the necessity of any irrigation.\r\n\r\n  There are those who think that a preliminary aspiration, followed\r\n  by incision, after a few days of improvement in general condition,\r\n  is the best method in serious cases.\r\n\r\n  It is usual to recommend a general anaesthetic when introducing the\r\n  aspirating syringe or trocar and cannula. Local anaesthesia with\r\n  quinine and urea hydrochloride, however, will usually suffice and\r\n  lessen the dangers of shock in bad cases. Rib resections and even\r\n  intra-abdominal procedures are best done under local anaesthesia\r\n  provided the operator is familiar with the technic.\r\n\r\n  Newman has recently warned against the use of the small aspirator\r\n  for diagnosis, pointing out that it is unreliable and that the\r\n  diagnosis should be made by other diagnostic aids, including\r\n  hypodermic use of emetine. He notes the occurrence of death from\r\n  internal haemorrhage, the interference of the needle with the\r\n  surgical incision and, further, the obscuration of the field of\r\n  operation by pus where no adhesions exist and, finally, the danger\r\n  of general peritoneal infection from a leak. He notes that the\r\n  cavity may be under tension and that the pus may force itself along\r\n  the track of the needle. He recommends incision and packing with\r\n  gauze where adhesions do not exist and the exploration of the liver\r\n  with dressing forceps instead of cutting into the liver with the\r\n  knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSUAL OPERATION FOR LIVER ABSCESS\r\n\r\nEither a vertical incision about the middle of the right rectus\r\n(Bevan) or a Kocher incision, parallel with the costal margin, may\r\nbe used. The latter incision favors hernia if prolonged drainage is\r\nrequired. The hand is introduced into the abdominal cavity and the\r\nliver palpated. Often the borders of the site of a liver abscess give\r\na hard feeling on palpation. If adhesions are not present the area\r\nshould be packed off with gauze and the cavity opened by a dressing\r\nforceps, haemostat or thermo-cautery. It is often advisable to\r\nintroduce a trocar and cannula and to drain off the excess of pus.\r\n\r\n  Where the abscess is situated far back or high up in the liver\r\n  the transpleural route is to be preferred to the abdominal one.\r\n  Make a 3 or 4 inch incision over the 9th rib with its center in\r\n  the line of the angle of the scapula. Excise about 2 inches of\r\n  rib subperiosteally. An assistant presses a roll of gauze against\r\n  the tissues above the line of incision to prevent air entering\r\n  the pleural cavity. Later the upper flap may be sutured to the\r\n  endothoracic fascia. Even if the pleural cavity should be opened\r\n  and air enter no serious result will follow although it is an\r\n  accident to be avoided if possible. The diaphragm is now cut\r\n  through and the liver exposed and after packing gauze around the\r\n  area to be opened, the abscess cavity is entered and drained as\r\n  previously described.\r\n\r\n  McDill prefers to resect 2 or 3 inches of both 9th and 10th ribs\r\n  in the midaxillary line. The muscle wounds made in resection are\r\n  then closed by catgut. This movable wall is now forced against the\r\n  diaphragm with a roll of gauze pressed inward by an assistant.\r\n  A 3-inch incision is now made through this bone-free wall near\r\n  the upper border of the 11th rib, going through diaphragm and\r\n  exposing the liver. The edges of the wound in the thoracic wall\r\n  and diaphragm are now clamped together by haemostats to close off\r\n  the pleural cavity. Later catgut sutures are substituted for the\r\n  forceps. The liver often bulges into the wound. Finding the abscess\r\n  by a palpating finger as a rather firm area in a less resistant\r\n  liver surface we introduce a forceps or aspirating needle or trocar\r\n  and proceed as above noted.\r\n\r\n  There are indications that the use of emetine subcutaneously may\r\n  make the more radical operations unnecessary. In a recent symposium\r\n  on liver abscess many of the papers would indicate a preference for\r\n  aspiration without drainage coupled with emetine subcutaneously.\r\n\r\n  Rogers, in a recent article, notes that a case of liver abscess was\r\n  cured by emetine without any form of operation. Recent experience,\r\n  however, would indicate that it is necessary to evacuate the pus to\r\n  effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II\r\n\r\nDISEASES DUE TO BACTERIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBACILLARY DYSENTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—Epidemics of dysentery have been noted since ancient\r\ntimes, the widespread and fulminating nature of such outbreaks in\r\ntimes of war and famine having impressed observers in all ages. The\r\ndisease is mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus (1600 B. C.).\r\n\r\n  Herodotus referred to an epidemic of dysenteric nature in the\r\n  Persian Army and Hippocrates described the dysenteric syndrome. It\r\n  has been known in India since remote times.\r\n\r\n  While the etiology of amoebic dysentery was thoroughly investigated\r\n  and its connection with amoebae fairly well established during the\r\n  decade from 1880 to 1890 it was not until 1898 that Shiga isolated\r\n  the causative organism of bacillary dysentery. It is true that\r\n  Chantamesse and Widal drew attention to a bacillus isolated from\r\n  large intestines, mesenteric glands and spleen of cases of tropical\r\n  dysentery but the organism was not clearly differentiated from\r\n  _Bacillus coli_. Celli isolated an organism which coagulated milk\r\n  and produced gas in glucose media. This organism which Celli called\r\n  _B. coli dysentericus_, differs culturally from _B. dysenteriae_.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Bacillary dysentery differs from the\r\n  amoebic form in that it tends to appear in extensive epidemics\r\n  spreading over temperate as well as tropical and subtropical parts\r\n  of the world.\r\n\r\n  It is peculiarly liable to follow the movements of armies in any\r\n  part of the world and like typhoid fever its distribution is one of\r\n  hygienic rather than geographical influence.\r\n\r\n  Infections with various strains of dysentery bacilli are important\r\n  factors in morbidity among infants and young children in whatever\r\n  part of the world the question has been investigated. The disease\r\n  is prone to prevail in lunatic asylums whether in temperate or\r\n  tropical parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—During a very fatal epidemic of dysentery in Japan\r\nShiga isolated an organism, _Bacillus dysenteriae_, from dysenteric\r\nstools of 36 cases, which bacillus he found to be agglutinated by the\r\nserum of the patients. He reported this work in 1898. In 1900, Kruse\r\nisolated an organism from patients in an epidemic of dysentery in\r\nGermany which corresponded to that of Shiga. In 1900, Flexner, Strong\r\nand Musgrave, working in Manila, not only encountered an organism\r\nsimilar to that of Shiga but also an organism of wider fermentative\r\naction. Dysentery has resulted from accidental laboratory infections\r\nand Strong produced dysentery in a prisoner condemned to death\r\nthrough ingestion of cultures.\r\n\r\n  In 1903, Hiss and Russell isolated an organism from a fatal case of\r\n  diarrhoea in a child to which they gave the name “Y”.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, dysentery bacilli correspond culturally with the\r\ntyphoid bacillus except in showing slightly weaker fermentative\r\naction on carbohydrates. The main point of difference however is\r\ntheir absolute nonmotility.\r\n\r\n  The characteristic of nonmotility is of greatest differentiating\r\n  value and the reports of slight motility are probably from\r\n  misinterpretation of molecular movement as motility. The dysentery\r\n  bacilli do not form those thread or whip-like filaments so\r\n  characteristic of typhoid cultures and are somewhat plumper. The\r\n  dysentery bacillus is not found in the blood and hence is not\r\n  eliminated in the urine, although recently there have been reported\r\n  rare cases where dysentery bacilli were isolated from the blood. It\r\n  is found in mesenteric glands. In dysentery patients agglutination\r\n  phenomena do not show themselves until about the tenth day from\r\n  the onset. Hence, this procedure is of no particular value in\r\n  diagnosis. It is of value, however, to identify an organism\r\n  isolated from the stools at the commencement of the attack, using\r\n  serum from an immunized animal or a human convalescent for the\r\n  agglutination test.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be only moderate agglutination power in the serum\r\nof convalescents from Shiga strains. Flexner strains give higher\r\nagglutinations, but early in convalescence the serum is not apt to\r\nhave a titre of more than 1-150.\r\n\r\n  Dysentery bacilli produce a coagulation necrosis of the mucous\r\n  membrane of the large intestine and occasionally of the lower\r\n  part of the ileum. Polymorphonuclears are contained in the fibrin\r\n  exudate.\r\n\r\n  It was formerly thought that these lesions were of local origin,\r\n  but the present view is that toxins are produced which, being\r\n  absorbed, are eliminated by the large intestine with resulting\r\n  necrosis. Flexner, by injecting rabbits intravenously with a toxic\r\n  autolysate, produced characteristic intestinal lesions. The toxin\r\n  withstands a temperature of 70°C. without being destroyed. The\r\n  toxin may cause joint trouble.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of dysentery bacilli:\r\n\r\n1. Those producing acid in mannite media—the acid strains\r\n(Flexner-Strong types).\r\n\r\n2. Those not developing acid in mannite (Shiga-Kruse types). The\r\nShiga type is very toxic in cultures, while the Flexner type seems to\r\nbe less so. An organism resembling the Shiga bacillus but producing\r\nindol is the Schmitz bacillus. It does not appear to be pathogenic.\r\n\r\n  In immunizing horses for the production of antidysenteric serum it\r\n  is customary to use both Flexner and Shiga strains, thus producing\r\n  a polyvalent serum.\r\n\r\n  Lentz recognizes 4 types of dysentery bacilli for the\r\n  differentiation of which he uses mannite, maltose and saccharose\r\n  bouillon with litmus as an indicator.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------------+---------+--------+-------\r\n              | Shiga-Kruse | Flexner | Strong | “Y”\r\n  ------------+-------------+---------+--------+-------\r\n  Mannite     | Blue        | Red     | Red    | Red\r\n  Maltose     | Blue        | Red     | Blue   | Blue\r\n  Saccharose  | Blue        | Blue    | Red    | Blue\r\n  ------------+-------------+---------+--------+-------\r\n\r\n  The following table gives the more important cultural\r\n  characteristics of the intestinal bacilli which might be confused\r\n  with the various strains of dysentery bacilli.\r\n\r\n              Key for column headings:\r\n                A - Motility\r\n                B - Milk coagulation\r\n                C - Glucose\r\n                D - Maltose\r\n                E - Lactose\r\n                F - Mannite\r\n                G - Saccharose\r\n                H - Glucose neutral red bouillon\r\n                I - Butt\r\n                J - Slant\r\n                K - Indol\r\n  ------------------+---+---+-------+---+---+---+---+---+----+--------+---\r\n                    |   |   |Litmus |   |   |   |   |   |    |Russel’s|\r\n                    |   |   | Milk  |   |   |   |   |   |    | Medium |\r\n                    |   |   |-------|   |   |   |   |   |    |--------|\r\n                    |   |   |1st|3d |   |   |   |   |   |    |        |\r\n                    | A | B |day|day| C | D | E | F | G | H  | I | J  | K\r\n  ------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+---+----+---\r\n  B. faecalis       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |   |    |\r\n   alkaligines      | + | - |Alk|Alk| O | O | O | O | O | O  | O | O  | -\r\n  ------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+---+----+---\r\n  B. typhosus       | + | - | A | A | A | A | O | A | O |  O | A |Alk | -\r\n  ------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+---+----+---\r\n  B. dysenteriae    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |   |    |\r\n   (Shiga-Kruse)    | - | - | A |Alk| A | O | O | O | O | O  | A |Alk | -\r\n  ------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+---+----+---\r\n  B. dysenteriae    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |   |    |\r\n   (Flexner-Strong) | - | - | A |Alk| A | A | O | A | O | O  | A |Alk | -\r\n  ------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+---+----+---\r\n  B. dysenteriae    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |   |    |\r\n   “Y”              | - | - | A |Alk| A | O | O | A | O | O  | A |Alk | +\r\n  ------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+---+----+---\r\n  B.

In a family, where the mother\r\nmay have to care for a sick child, and prepare food for the other\r\nchildren and herself, the opportunities for the spread of the\r\ninfection in the family are great. In military barracks, as well\r\nas in other institutions where large numbers make use of the same\r\nwater-closet accommodations, the chances of contamination of the seat\r\nby a patient responding to the frequent and imperious demands for\r\nevacuation are most probable, with subsequent transference of the\r\ninfectious material to others. Bacillary dysentery is peculiarly an\r\ninstitutional disease and tends to spread in jails, orphan asylums\r\nand the like. A carrier is a particular source of danger in such an\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n  Not only is there the danger from a patient ill with bacillary\r\n  dysentery but as well that from the convalescent or chronic\r\n  carrier. Such carriers are particular sources of danger where they\r\n  take part in the preparation of food for others. It is now thought\r\n  that the striking prevalence of the disease in insane asylums is\r\n  associated with the difficulty of making such patients observe the\r\n  proper care of their hands as well as their persons.\r\n\r\n  Friedmann has recently noted an outbreak of dysentery due to the\r\n  Shiga type of bacillus which was instituted by a soldier returning\r\n  to the barracks from a furlough.\r\n\r\n  There resulted 86 cases in the man’s regiment of which 49 belonged\r\n  to his own squadron. The spread of the disease was traced to the\r\n  latrines. The epidemic was suppressed by the enforcement of the\r\n  most rigid rules of cleanliness especially as regarding washing of\r\n  the hands after leaving the latrines.\r\n\r\n  The stools of the convalescents were examined and no man was\r\n  discharged from hospital until his stools were negative for\r\n  dysentery bacilli upon 3 successive tests in fourteen days.\r\n\r\n  Isolation of the bacilli from convalescents was obtained in 40\r\n  patients only for periods under fourteen days while with 27 others\r\n  such carrying of bacilli lasted from two weeks to one month.\r\n\r\nAs the dysentery bacillus does not invade the blood stream we do\r\nnot find it in the urine so that to a certain extent the dysentery\r\nbacillus carrier is less dangerous than the typhoid one.\r\n\r\n  There have been reports of isolation of Flexner and “Y” type\r\n  bacilli from monkeys and rabbits but there is nothing to indicate\r\n  that any other host than man is of importance.\r\n\r\nFlies are undoubtedly of as much importance in the spread of\r\nbacillary dysentery as of typhoid.\r\n\r\n  The possibility of infection through the medium of soiled clothes,\r\n  sent out for washing, is to be thought of.\r\n\r\n  There have been several instances of transference of the disease by\r\n  the water supply.\r\n\r\nIn times of war, with large forces of soldiers, bacillary dysentery\r\ntends to become the most important disease encountered by military\r\nsurgeons. During the Civil War there were 285,000 cases of dysentery\r\nin the Federal army.\r\n\r\n  It is possible that infectious material may be disseminated as dust\r\n  and thus contaminate food.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nInjection of dysentery bacilli into the peritoneal cavity of guinea\r\npigs causes a muco-sanguinolent diarrhoea with congestion of and\r\nhaemorrhage into the caecum. There is also a haemorrhagic peritoneal\r\nexudate.\r\n\r\n  In the rabbit lesions similar to those in man are obtained as well\r\n  as paralysis of the limbs.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore thought that there are two toxins concerned in the\r\npathology of bacillary dysentery, one a neurotoxin which may cause a\r\nperipheral neuritis or joint trouble and the other a toxin which acts\r\non the lower bowel, especially the caecum, with the production of\r\ncongestion and coagulation necrosis of the mucosa.\r\n\r\n  Cases have been reported where the adrenals showed congestion and\r\n  necroses, as if subjected to the action of a toxin.\r\n\r\n  In man we have an acute inflammation of the mucosa of the large\r\n  intestines and, in the tropics, we frequently find the lower\r\n  third of the ileum involved as well. In amoebic dysentery the\r\n  process rarely extends beyond the ileo-caecal valve. A catarrhal\r\n  process with hyperaemia and sero-purulent exudate is first noted,\r\n  to be succeeded by fibrin formation in the mucosa, a process of\r\n  coagulation necrosis. When the process invades the ileum there\r\n  is no involvement of Peyer’s patches. Virchow noted the greater\r\n  intensity of the process in the region of the rectum, sigmoid\r\n  flexure and ileo-caecal valve.\r\n\r\n  As a rule, however, the entire large intestine is grayish red,\r\n  looking like lustreless red velvet. Later on we may have irregular\r\n  islands of grayish membrane formation surrounded by the red swollen\r\n  congested gut. The solitary glands are usually swollen and may\r\n  soften and ulcerate, having the submucosa as a base. Ulceration in\r\n  bacillary dysentery is superficial rather than deep as with amoebic\r\n  dysentery. The ulcers of bacillary dysentery involve the free folds\r\n  of the intestine and extend transversely while amoebic ulcers run\r\n  longitudinally. The intervening mucosa is unaffected in amoebic\r\n  ulcerations while in bacillary ones it is inflamed.\r\n\r\nMicroscopically we note marked congestion of the blood vessels\r\nof the mucosa and submucosa with dilated lymph spaces full of\r\npolymorphonuclear cells.\r\n\r\n  In the mucosa we find an outpouring of pus cells which are\r\n  entangled, along with the glandular structures of the mucosa, in a\r\n  fibrinous exudate which causes necrosis of the mucosa (coagulation\r\n  necrosis).\r\n\r\n  In chronic bacillary dysentery, according to Rogers, the lesions\r\n  are limited to the lower portion of the large gut and rarely extend\r\n  above the descending colon.\r\n\r\n  In this region one finds serpiginous ulcerations separated by\r\n  islands of mucosa. Willmore and Savage have noted autopsy findings\r\n  of what was practically a large granulating surface over the whole\r\n  large intestine, in cases which had apparently recovered, with the\r\n  exception of a prolonged convalescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nBacillary dysentery usually runs an acute course, rarely relapsing\r\nand but occasionally going on to a chronic condition. The period of\r\nincubation is usually from two to seven days although accidental\r\ninfection with bacilli in the laboratory has given an incubation\r\nperiod approximating twenty-four hours. Periods of incubation longer\r\nthan a week can probably be explained as for cholera, such cases\r\nbeing in those who are healthy carriers, but by reason of some\r\ngastro-intestinal upset the quiescent bacilli take on pathogenic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n  In temperate climates and in particular when the infecting organism\r\n  is a Flexner type the case may appear as a watery diarrhoea\r\n  associated with colicky pains and anorexia. The stools soon become\r\n  more scanty in amount, frequent in number and associated with\r\n  straining. This is followed by mucous stools more or less tinged\r\n  with blood. The temperature is normal or but slightly elevated and\r\n  the patient does not seem ill.\r\n\r\n  In the tropics and in temperate climates where the Shiga type\r\n  bacillus is the infecting organism the onset is usually rather\r\n  sudden with malaise, abdominal pain and a diarrhoea, which only\r\n  temporarily relieves such pain. This initial diarrhoea is soon\r\n  followed by the characteristic dysentery stool and the pains, which\r\n  latter tend to centre about the umbilicus and to become continuous.\r\n  There is usually loss of appetite and slight nausea and the patient\r\n  may at times show a very slight tendency to flightiness. The mind\r\n  however is usually clear. Fever of moderate degree is not uncommon\r\n  and it may be quite marked,—up to 104°F. Ingestion of food or\r\n  drink or any movement of the body brings on a desire for defecation.\r\n\r\nThe number of stools, which in mild cases number 15 to 30, may become\r\nexcessive, even more than one hundred in twenty-four hours, and the\r\ntenesmus most torturing, so that excoriations around the anus and\r\nat times prolapse of the bowel intensify the distressing clinical\r\npicture. In acute cases the stool may be almost pure blood with only\r\nan admixture of mucus.\r\n\r\n  Vesical tenesmus may be present and the urine may be diminished in\r\n  amount.\r\n\r\nThere is a toxic effect on the heart so that the pulse tends to\r\nbecome accelerated and weak. Bacillary dysentery may show a moderate\r\nleucocytosis with increased polymorphonuclear percentage instead of a\r\nlarge mononuclear one as with amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  At times, however, the lymphocytes may be the leucocytes showing\r\n  the greatest relative increase.\r\n\r\n_Collapse Types._—In the most severe types of dysentery we may have\r\nan abrupt onset with rigors and vomiting and a high fever. This fever\r\ngives way to a subnormal temperature and the patient shows signs of\r\ncollapse and such a case may die without having passed dysenteric\r\nstools. The abdomen is rigid and very tender on palpation.\r\n\r\n_Entero-dysentery._—In those cases where the process extends to\r\nthe lower portion of the small intestine the general symptoms are\r\nmuch more severe although the tenesmus is less and the stools less\r\nfrequent and more voluminous. They contain much blood and mucus mixed\r\nwith feculent material. Shiga calls such cases entero-dysentery.\r\n\r\n  In severe cases of the more typical dysentery or colodysentery, as\r\n  designated by Shiga, the stools may change from the mucopurulent\r\n  mass to a serous discharge which is very rich in albumin and of an\r\n  albuminous odor. In such cases emaciation of the patient is very\r\n  rapid. Such cases may show signs of collapse with cold clammy skin\r\n  and the clinical picture one associates with cholera.\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested that such cases may be due to action of the\r\n  dysentery toxins on the adrenal.\r\n\r\nThis serous fluid may contain the flesh-like particles which the\r\nFrench liken to gut scrapings. During convalescence there may be an\r\narthritis, which however does not impair the function of the joint.\r\n\r\n=Complications.=—In addition to the arthritis there may be neuritis,\r\nwhich, in severe cases, may go on to muscular atrophy. In the\r\narthritis the knee joint is that most frequently involved. This\r\ncomplication appears late in the course of the attack. Arthritis may\r\nbe frequent in one epidemic and absent in another. The joint swelling\r\nusually clears up completely. Some of the reported joint involvements\r\nare undoubtedly serum reactions from antidysenteric serum treatment.\r\nRarely in Shiga infections we may have an irido-cyclitis. Subnormal\r\ntemperature may follow severe attacks.\r\n\r\n  In some epidemics of dysentery gangrenous manifestations have been\r\n  common. This is a very fatal type and is recognized by the passage\r\n  of dark-brown serous discharges containing ashy gray to black\r\n  sloughs or even tubules of gangrenous mucosa, the stool having a\r\n  putrid odor. The general symptoms are pronounced, there being a dry\r\n  glazed tongue, and low muttering delirium with a thready pulse. It\r\n  is the typhoid state.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to consider bacillary dysentery as a self-limited\r\ndisease, running on to convalescence within ten days or two weeks.\r\n\r\n  Rogers has called attention to the importance of bearing in mind\r\n  a chronic condition as well as the acute one. In these chronic\r\n  cases the ulcerations are usually located in the descending\r\n  colon, sigmoid flexure or rectum and give rise to frequent stools\r\n  containing blood and mucus and causing a progressive loss of\r\n  strength and weight. There is marked digestive disorder and the\r\n  patient becomes weak, anaemic and neurasthenic.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the dysenteric syndrome of tormina, tenesmus,\r\nfrequent scanty stools of muco-purulent or muco-sanguinolent\r\ncharacter, one must keep in mind the various conditions which may\r\ngive rise to such manifestations of dysentery and not diagnose a\r\nbacillary dysentery until we have excluded tuberculous, cancerous and\r\nsyphilitic processes as well as those connected with schistosome or\r\nother helminthic infections.\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—Amoebic dysentery is differentiated clinically\r\nfrom bacillary dysentery by the usual absence of manifestations of\r\ntoxaemia and by its insidious onset and chronic course.\r\n\r\n  It is important however to remember that either bacillary or\r\n  amoebic dysentery may show gangrenous manifestations and in such\r\n  cases the clinical picture of the typhoid state is the same\r\n  whether the process is amoebic or bacillary. Fulminant bacillary\r\n  dysenteries may greatly resemble cholera in its algid stage.\r\n\r\nTropical liver abscess is a complication exclusively occurring in the\r\namoebic form of dysentery while joint manifestations and evidences\r\nof multiple neuritis may be noted in some epidemics of bacillary\r\ndysentery. Again, the toxins of the dysentery bacilli have a tendency\r\nto damage the myocardium. At present we consider the good effects\r\nof the administration of emetine as important in the diagnosis of\r\namoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  It is important to remember that chronic dysentery may result from\r\n  bacillary as well as amoebic infections, although a chronic process\r\n  is more a feature of amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe muco-purulent stool of bacillary dysentery is more of a milky\r\nwhiteness and flecked or streaked with blood or a very viscous bright\r\nblood-tinged mucus rather than the homogeneous, grayish brown,\r\ngelatinous mixture of disintegrated blood and mucus of the amoebic\r\none. The odour is apt to be foetid in amoebic stools but rather\r\nalbuminous with bacillary dysentery ones.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—The chief point is to determine whether we\r\nare dealing with an amoebic or bacillary infection. While these two\r\nkinds of dysentery may coexist it is practical to consider a case in\r\nwhich amoebae with long, rapidly extruded, finger-like pseudopodia\r\nand containing red blood cells are found, as one of amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  A fresh specimen of the muco-purulent stool of bacillary dysentery\r\n  shows, in addition to pus cells, numerous large, phagocytic\r\n  cells, which may show vacuolation and strikingly resemble\r\n  amoebae. Such cells never show motility but, under conditions of\r\n  lowered temperature of specimen or from prolonged standing and\r\n  beginning disintegration, the amoebae too fail to show motility.\r\n  If mounted in Gram’s iodine solution these large cells show a\r\n  much larger nucleus than that of amoebae and take the yellow\r\n  staining of iodine more intensely. The best method, however, is\r\n  to make a smear, fix it by heat and stain by Gram’s method or\r\n  with Loeffler’s blue or dilute carbol fuchsin. These confusing\r\n  cells stain easily and perfectly and in the Gram specimen we note\r\n  the Gram-negative bacilli in the cytoplasm. Giemsa’s stain, with\r\n  methyl alcohol fixation, or the usual Wright or Leishman technique\r\n  answer equally well. On the other hand it is rather difficult to\r\n  obtain satisfactorily stained amoebae in this way, it usually\r\n  being necessary to fix moist thin smears of the stool with some\r\n  bichloride fixative, as Zenker’s fluid, and then carry out the\r\n  staining with haematoxylin.\r\n\r\n  _The Stained Smear._—The presence of pus cells as well as\r\n  endothelial cells in a stained smear of material from a bacillary\r\n  dysentery stool is of value in differentiating from an amoebic\r\n  stool smear in which pus cells are rarely seen. The amoebic\r\n  dysentery smear gives more the picture of granular débris.\r\n\r\nWe should always examine a stool as soon after it is passed as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n  If the microscopical examination indicates a bacillary infection\r\n  we should take a small mass of the stool, wash it in sterile\r\n  water and then drop it in a tube of sterile bouillon or salt\r\n  solution. After emulsifying in this tube of bouillon we take up 2\r\n  or 3 loopfuls of the emulsion and deposit them on a poured plate,\r\n  later smearing out with a glass rod, either by successive parallel\r\n  strokes or by revolving the plate while smearing the surface with\r\n  the glass rod. It is in the first two or three days of an attack\r\n  of acute dysentery that we obtain the best cultural results, often\r\n  noting a pure culture of dysentery bacilli from proper material\r\n  taken at the onset. Manson-Bahr states that he has never recovered\r\n  true dysentery bacilli from a purely faecal stool. Even faecal\r\n  contamination of the mucoid mass makes it difficult to recover the\r\n  organism. Dysentery bacilli rapidly die out if the stool is acid so\r\n  that it has been recommended to make the stool strongly alkaline\r\n  where it has to be sent to a laboratory from a distance.\r\n\r\n  It has seemed to me that litmus lactose agar gives results more\r\n  surely than the more restraining faeces-plating media. Still I\r\n  generally use Endo’s fuchsin agar because it is always at hand\r\n  for typhoid or paratyphoid culturing and gives good results. The\r\n  dysentery bacillus colonies on this medium are like those of\r\n  typhoid—grayish white. In England they prefer MacConkey’s neutral\r\n  red bile salt agar while others use the Conradi-Drigalski medium.\r\n  We are now using the Teague medium, which is taken up in the\r\n  chapter on Faeces. On all these media the colonies resemble those\r\n  of typhoid and the differentiation is most easily made by examining\r\n  for motility. At the same time one not infrequently finds lack of\r\n  motility in bacilli from colonies just isolated on Endo’s medium\r\n  which later on in subculture show motility and are found to belong\r\n  to the typhoid or paratyphoid group. For the sure determination\r\n  of dysentery bacilli or for differentiating the Flexner and Shiga\r\n  strains one should carry out agglutination tests.\r\n\r\nThe isolation of dysentery bacilli from chronic cases or from\r\nconvalescents is more difficult as a rule and agglutination tests may\r\nbe more practical. A trouble is that an agglutinating effect may be\r\nconnected with a prior infection.\r\n\r\n  Although some observers have noted the appearance of agglutinins\r\n  in the serum of cases of acute bacillary dysentery within three or\r\n  four days from the onset of the disease, yet it is usual not to\r\n  obtain agglutination with the patient’s serum before the tenth day.\r\n  With the Shiga strains agglutinating power in 1 to 50 is usually\r\n  accepted as evidence of specificity but for Flexner strains we\r\n  generally have a higher titre so that a dilution of 1 to 150 should\r\n  be required for the test.\r\n\r\nRitchie has recently tested the sera of 792 normal persons and found\r\nthat 30% of these individuals agglutinated Shiga bacilli in 1 to 32,\r\nwhile with Flexner strains 41% agglutinated in 1 to 64 and 30% in 1\r\nto 128. For comparison Ritchie’s results with typhoid showed that\r\nonly 6% agglutinated such bacilli in 1 to 16. There is some evidence\r\nthat typhoid vaccination increases the agglutinating power of the\r\nserum against dysentery organisms. These findings are remarkable, as\r\nthe usual advice is to consider an agglutination of 1 to 30 as fairly\r\nspecific for Shiga infections and 1 to 100 for Flexner ones.\r\n\r\n  Willmore and Savage tried heating serum to 56°C. for thirty\r\n  minutes, but found that such a procedure was of no practical\r\n  value with dysentery, thus differing from Malta fever serum where\r\n  such a procedure is of value in destroying coagglutinins and thus\r\n  increasing the specific action. The work of Ohno would indicate\r\n  that we should trust to the acid-producing effect on mannite\r\n  for differentiating Flexner and Shiga strains rather than on\r\n  agglutination because it was found that agglutinins for an acid\r\n  strain were not always more specific for such strains than for\r\n  nonacid ones.\r\n\r\n  At the same time it is the rule for a Flexner type bacillus to\r\n  show specificity for its serum and the Shiga type for the serum of\r\n  the more toxic, nonacid-fast Shiga strain cases. The statement of\r\n  Willmore and Savage that the differentiation of bacillary dysentery\r\n  infections is a refinement of technique seems a proper view because\r\n  with a polyvalent serum for treatment one only needs to know that\r\n  the case is one of bacillary dysentery for proper treatment. Of\r\n  course with a monovalent serum, effective only for the Shiga\r\n  bacillus, one would have to determine whether the organism\r\n  producing the dysentery was of that strain.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact it takes considerable time and laboratory skill\r\nto carry out reliable cultural and serological tests.\r\n\r\n  From a practical standpoint we can use the therapeutic polyvalent\r\n  serum for agglutination and any organism recovered on the plate\r\n  made from the faeces which agglutinates in 1 to 50 or 1 to 100\r\n  may be considered as diagnostic of bacillary as against amoebic\r\n  dysentery. Often one does not see a case of dysentery until late\r\n  in the disease and then, provided the condition is serious and the\r\n  diagnosis points to a bacillary infection it would be better to\r\n  inject the curative serum rather than await laboratory confirmation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The ease with which water-closet seats may be\r\ncontaminated should make us pay great attention to their disinfection\r\nduring an outbreak of bacillary dysentery. The same applies to the\r\nbedclothes of such patients sent out for laundering.\r\n\r\n  Great care should be given to the washing of one’s hands prior to\r\n  eating. The greatest care must be taken with rectal tubes when\r\n  used for treatment. It is better to make an invariable rule to\r\n  confine the use of a single tube to a single patient, as the rubber\r\n  tubes are difficult to disinfect other than by boiling and such\r\n  treatment, especially in the tropics, soon ruins the tube. For\r\n  disinfecting tubes a 5% solution of liquor cresolis compositus is\r\n  good. The tubes should be thoroughly washed of the disinfectant\r\n  before using again. For disinfection of faeces one can use an\r\n  equal portion of the above disinfectant to a similar amount of\r\n  stool leaving the disinfectant to act on the stool at least one\r\n  hour before emptying the receptacle. Soiled clothes should be\r\n  disinfected in a 2½% solution of the compound cresol solution.\r\n  Flies must be kept in mind and water and milk supplies boiled. The\r\n  carrier is of as great importance here as in typhoid or cholera,\r\n  especially when assisting in preparing food.\r\n\r\n=Vaccination.=—Vaccination against dysentery does not seem to have\r\nmade much headway owing to the very severe reactions following\r\ninjections of killed cultures of the Shiga bacillus. By injecting\r\nsuch bacilli treated with an immune serum (sensitized) the reaction\r\nis less severe.\r\n\r\n  Dean reports the value of treating the emulsion of organisms with\r\n  an equal amount of 1 to 1000 eusol. Gibson treated a suspension of\r\n  dead organisms with an equal amount of serum, mixing in the syringe\r\n  at the time of injection. Although this method was used during the\r\n  war its immunizing value was not settled.\r\n\r\n  The question of the best method of preparing vaccines for\r\n  prophylactic use is still unsettled. The greatest difficulty has\r\n  been experienced in making vaccines of the Shiga bacillus on\r\n  account of the great toxicity of such preparations.\r\n\r\n  The serum alone is used almost exclusively for curative rather than\r\n  prophylactic purposes.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—In the treatment of bacillary dysentery absolute rest\r\nin bed is important to keep up the strength of the patient and also\r\nto protect the heart which tends to be more or less damaged by the\r\ntoxic action of the Shiga bacillus. Some prefer to prop up the\r\npatient in bed, considering a strict dorsal decubitus as undesirable.\r\nIt is important to use sufficient covering on the patient to avoid\r\nchilling. A light wool blanket spread over the abdomen is often all\r\nthat is needed in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  Some authorities deal with the subject of treatment without\r\n  referring to any other means than the administration of serum.\r\n  This probably is the proper attitude when the very fatal Shiga\r\n  type infections are encountered. It must be remembered that\r\n  certain epidemics, which as a rule are associated with the Shiga\r\n  type bacillus, give a very high mortality (20 to 40%) while other\r\n  epidemics seem associated with a less virulent strain of this\r\n  bacillus.\r\n\r\n  At any rate when a case is seen early it would seem advisable\r\n  to give about 2 grains of calomel in divided doses of ¼ grain\r\n  every half hour and then follow it up with saline treatment. Most\r\n  authorities recommend a preliminary dose of castor oil. During\r\n  the first day or two enemata of normal saline, boric acid or 1½%\r\n  sodium bicarbonate solution in 2 pint amounts would seem indicated\r\n  as assisting the salines in the elimination of toxic material.\r\n  After that time the tenesmus and rectal irritation make the use of\r\n  the rectal tube too trying to the patient. I have used the Murphy\r\n  protoclysis method with a certain degree of success, but this\r\n  procedure cannot be kept up long. Hot fomentations to the belly\r\n  relieve the griping pains.\r\n\r\nThe saline treatment is highly recommended by Buchanan who gives\r\n60 grains of sodium sulphate every two or three hours until the\r\ndysenteric character of the stool disappears.\r\n\r\n  Bahr in the Fiji islands treated 53 consecutive cases, of which\r\n  41% had marked constitutional symptoms, with a mortality of 13.2%.\r\n  He gave 1 dram of sodium sulphate every hour for the first day and\r\n  subsequently the same dose every four hours.\r\n\r\n  In a second series of 106 cases, of which 42% had marked\r\n  constitutional symptoms, he treated 34 with salines plus the\r\n  administration of capsules of cyllin. The remaining 72 cases\r\n  received in addition to this treatment injections of a polyvalent\r\n  serum obtained from the Lister Institute. The mortality in this\r\n  series was 1.8%. He notes that 5 of the cases in this second series\r\n  were of the severest type as evidenced by the gangrenous stools\r\n  and toxic condition and yet not one of these five serum-treated\r\n  cases died. He notes that the stools of those who received serum\r\n  injections became normal in five days for an average while for\r\n  those treated with saline alone the average period was eight days.\r\n\r\n  Bahr strongly recommends the combined treatment of salines and\r\n  serum. In very severe cases Bahr used 50 to 70 cc. of the serum but\r\n  ordinarily 20 cc. for adults and 10 cc. or less for children.\r\n\r\nWillmore and Savage think one obtains the best results by injecting\r\nfrom 80 to 120 cc. of a polyvalent serum into the subcutaneous\r\ntissues of the flank or abdomen or intravenously. They think that\r\nanaphylaxis is less liable to follow a massive initial dose of serum.\r\n\r\n  In the use of serum Shiga recommends a dose of 10 cc. for a mild\r\n  case or two injections of 10 cc. at intervals of ten hours for\r\n  cases of medium severity, while in very toxic cases he uses 60 cc.\r\n  in 3 daily doses of 20 cc. each. It is important to use serum early\r\n  as it has little or no effect if used after the 7th day (Klein).\r\n\r\n  The best known sera are those of Shiga, Dopter and that prepared by\r\n  the Lister Institute.\r\n\r\n  Animal charcoal and bolus alba are considered of value by some\r\n  physicians. Opium should be avoided. Intravenous saline injections\r\n  are of value in cases showing collapse signs. Again, such cases,\r\n  from the standpoint of possible adrenal insufficiency, may be\r\n  helped by adrenalin. Where there is a very small rapid pulse with\r\n  marked cardiac weakness injections of camphor in oil may be of\r\n  value.\r\n\r\nSubcutaneous injections of ordinary or hypertonic saline containing\r\nabout 10 drops of 1 to 1000 adrenalin solution is of value in\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n  Ross considers opium as of value in dysentery and states that he\r\n  regards ipecac as of value not only in amoebic but in bacillary\r\n  dysentery as well. I have often given salol-coated pills containing\r\n  1 grain of ipecac and ⅙ grain of calomel every two hours to cases\r\n  of bacillary dysentery with apparent benefit.\r\n\r\nFor the diet of cases of acute bacillary dysentery albumin water\r\nor barley water sweetened with lactose is to be preferred to milk,\r\nwhich is usually not well borne by such patients. Kendall has noted\r\nthe value of sugar of milk in lessening the toxicity of various\r\norganisms. Tea sweetened with lactose is usually well borne. Meat\r\njuice expressed from a piece of lightly broiled steak is good.\r\nVarious jellies or sago pudding are of value. Willmore and Savage\r\npraise yoghurt.\r\n\r\n  Unless given in small amounts liquid diet is apt to increase\r\n  evacuations and some cases seem to do better on ordinary diet.\r\n\r\n  In the tropics there are many brands of sterilized natural milk and\r\n  these can be inoculated with a culture of _B. bulgaricus_.\r\n\r\n  In chronic bacillary dysentery Rogers recommends 1 to 1½ pint\r\n  enemata of albargin in strength of 1 to 500. Protargol seems to\r\n  be equally efficient in the same strength. Owing to the effect\r\n  of organic material on silver nitrate this salt does not seem\r\n  so reliable as the organic silver compounds. It has also been\r\n  recommended to flush the colon with warm boric acid solution.\r\n  Another recommendation is to use milk for this purpose. Vaccine\r\n  treatment has been employed, in cases of chronic bacillary\r\n  dysentery. Either eusol-treated organisms or those sterilized by\r\n  0.25% trikresol are to be preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPLAGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Plague is primarily a disease of rats or other\r\nrodents and is caused by a bacterium of the haemorrhagic septicaemia\r\ngroup, _Bacillus pestis_. The disease exists in the rodent in both\r\nan acute and chronic form. Acute plague of the rat is apt to be\r\nsepticaemic, so that when certain species of fleas which infest the\r\nrat feed on the blood of their host they ingest plague bacilli.\r\nThese seem to multiply in the region of the proventriculus and cause\r\nthereby an obstruction to the stomach. As a result the flea makes\r\nvigorous and repeated but ineffectual efforts to feed. Regurgitation\r\nof the contents of the oesophagus occurs, thereby inoculating\r\nplague bacilli. When the rats die these fleas will attack man and\r\ncause human plague. The ordinary type in man is bubonic plague,\r\ncharacterized by extremely tender glandular enlargements. This form\r\nof the disease is thought to be exclusively transmitted from man to\r\nman by fleas or possibly bedbugs. A second type is pneumonic plague\r\nwhich is a surely fatal pneumonia which is transmitted from man to\r\nman by droplets of sputum expelled in coughing. Either the bubonic or\r\npneumonic types may become septicaemic or this form may exist from\r\nthe start.\r\n\r\nPlague shows a marked clouding of the consciousness from the onset\r\nand is characterized by toxic action on the heart and endothelial\r\nlining of capillaries.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Oriental Plague, Black Death, Pestis. French: La Peste.\r\nGerman: Die Peste.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—Ancient writers were accustomed to apply the\r\n  designation “plague” to any disease which was epidemic in character\r\n  and attended with great mortality. This explains why the plague of\r\n  Athens and that of Marcus Aurelius, which epidemics did not possess\r\n  the characteristics of oriental plague, were so designated. There\r\n  exist however writings which show that fatal epidemic diseases\r\n  attended with buboes and prostration were noted prior to the\r\n  Christian era.\r\n\r\n  It is probable that the biblical description of a disease among the\r\n  Philistines which was attended with buboes and killed the mice of\r\n  the field referred to plague.\r\n\r\n  In the 6th century, during the reign of Justinian, a disease\r\n  which was unmistakably plague started from Egypt and reaching\r\n  Constantinople caused the death of 10,000 persons in one day. It\r\n  spread throughout the entire Roman empire.\r\n\r\n  _The “Black Death.”_—The most noted epidemic of plague was that of\r\n  the “Black Death” of the 14th century. The disease seems to have\r\n  originated in the East, possibly in China, and eventually invaded\r\n  Asia Minor, Egypt and Europe. The disease was called “Black Death”\r\n  in Germany, on account of the petechial spots or “tokens” and in\r\n  Italy, the “Great Mortality.”\r\n\r\n  In the records of the epidemic we note that it was attended with\r\n  great stupefaction, the sick losing their speech from palsy of the\r\n  tongue. Others noted buboes of groins and arms while some noted a\r\n  putrid inflammation of the lungs with the expectoration of blood.\r\n  In the plague at Avignon it was noted that at first, for six or\r\n  eight weeks, the sick expectorated blood and that to come near them\r\n  was certain death. Afterwards buboes appeared in groin and axilla\r\n  and some of the sick recovered.\r\n\r\n  _Quarantine._—It was during this epidemic that quarantine became\r\n  a recognized procedure in Europe. The adoption of a period of\r\n  detention of forty days probably originated in the medical idea\r\n  that the 40th day was the last day of ardent diseases, this being\r\n  one of the critical days. The lazarettos, where strangers were held\r\n  in quarantine, appear to have first been established on some island\r\n  near Venice, in 1485.\r\n\r\n  It has been estimated that one-fourth of the population of Europe\r\n  succumbed to the “Black Death,” but estimates in certain parts\r\n  of Europe would indicate a mortality approaching 70% of the\r\n  inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  In 1665 occurred the Great Plague of London, during which year it\r\n  was estimated that approximately 60,000 out of a population of\r\n  450,000 died. It was thought that this epidemic was introduced from\r\n  the Levant by way of Holland.\r\n\r\n  There was much plague in Europe in the 18th century but it would\r\n  seem to have completely disappeared by 1841 and only to have\r\n  returned with the present pandemic.\r\n\r\n  _The Present Pandemic._—The plague epidemic with which all parts\r\n  of the world are now so concerned is supposed to have originated\r\n  in China, in the province of Yunnan, and from that center to have\r\n  reached Canton, in 1894, causing the death of 60,000 people in a\r\n  population of 1,500,000. In the same year it extended to Hong Kong\r\n  and from that great seaport has spread over the entire world. India\r\n  has suffered more than any other country, there having been years\r\n  when the plague deaths exceeded 1,000,000.\r\n\r\n  In a recent article by Low it is noted that the highest death rate\r\n  was reached in 1907 when 1,315,892 persons died. From the time of\r\n  the introduction of plague into India to the end of 1917 there were\r\n  9,841,396 deaths from this disease.\r\n\r\n  In its spread it has invaded Europe, Egypt, South Africa,\r\n  Australia, Japan, Philippine Islands, California and parts of\r\n  Central and South America. It has recently made its appearance in\r\n  New Orleans.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—At present there are only two\r\n  important foci of endemicity, one Mesopotamia and another in the\r\n  region of the Himalayas (India, Thibet and Yunnan). There also\r\n  seem to be less important centers in Uganda, in Africa, and in the\r\n  trans-Baikal region of Siberia. In view of the rather widespread\r\n  infection of the California ground squirrels, from which rodents\r\n  the disease has from time to time spread to man, it would seem\r\n  probable that California might be considered another focus of\r\n  plague.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The bacillus of plague was first isolated by Yersin\r\nfrom a plague bubo, in 1894, at Hong Kong. It is true that Kitasato\r\nreported a bacillus which he had isolated from the blood of a plague\r\npatient, on July 7, 1894 (Yersin’s report was made July 30, 1894).\r\nKitasato’s bacillus was motile, Gram-positive, coagulated milk and\r\ngave a turbidity in bouillon, characteristics which were just the\r\nopposite of those of the organism reported by Yersin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—Pest bacilli from spleen of rat. (Kolle and\r\nWassermann.)]\r\n\r\n  As now recognized the plague bacillus, when in smears from\r\n  pathological material, shows the form of an oval bacillus, the ends\r\n  of which stain more intensely than the central portion (bipolar\r\n  staining). When cultured on ordinary agar, the morphology is more\r\n  rod-shaped with a tendency to pleomorphism.\r\n\r\n  These agar cultures are very sticky and mucilaginous. If 3% of\r\n  NaCl is added to the agar, this pleomorphism is exaggerated, there\r\n  occurring coccoid, root-shaped and various bizarre involution forms.\r\n\r\nFor obtaining the involution-form appearance on 3% salt agar one\r\nshould transfer liberally from the ordinary agar growth to the salt\r\nagar rather than planting direct from the pathological material.\r\n\r\n  A bouillon culture, upon the surface of which there has been\r\n  deposited drops of oil or melted butter, shows a string-like\r\n  downward growth from the under surface of the oil globules. This\r\n  “stalactite” growth is very fragile and is difficult to obtain.\r\n\r\n  Ordinary bouillon cultures show a rather powdery deposit at the\r\n  bottom and a hanging-drop preparation from such a culture shows\r\n  chains of plague organisms resembling streptococci. Gelatine is not\r\n  liquefied. _Bacillus pestis_ grows readily at room temperature as\r\n  well as at 37°C, and one may be struck with the fact that colonies\r\n  on agar plates may show variations in degree of development so\r\n  that the suspicion of a contaminated culture may arise. Human\r\n  plague material for cultures or smears is best obtained from the\r\n  bubo prior to suppuration in bubonic plague, from the blood in\r\n  septicaemic plague and from the watery sputum in pneumonic plague.\r\n\r\n_Plague in the Rat._—With acute plague in the rat one finds marked\r\ninjection of the subcuticular surface of an exposed abdominal flap;\r\ncertain glands, especially the neck ones, show marked congestion,\r\nhaemorrhagic necrosis and periglandular infiltration; the pleural\r\ncavity contains much fluid; the liver has a yellow mottled appearance\r\nliberally sprinkled with discrete, yellowish-white granules about\r\nthe size of a pin’s head, while the spleen is enlarged. Smears from\r\nthe spleen or affected glands, as a rule, show the bacilli in great\r\nnumbers. The San Francisco findings in plague rat autopsies varied\r\nsomewhat from those noted above, which held for Indian plague rats.\r\n\r\n  _Confusing Organisms._—Other organisms which may be obtained\r\n  from plague-suspected material are those of the proteus or colon\r\n  group, which may show bipolar staining, but culturally are quite\r\n  different. Klein has noted that a nonmotile rod, which gives a\r\n  striking bipolar staining and named _Bacillus bristolensis_, may be\r\n  mistaken for the plague bacillus. Its growth in bouillon is similar\r\n  to that of _B. coli_ and it coagulates milk.\r\n\r\n  An organism, _B. pseudotuberculosis rodentium_, resembles the\r\n  plague bacillus in a striking manner but is without virulence for\r\n  rats. It is virulent however for guinea pigs and these animals can\r\n  be immunized against plague with this closely related organism.\r\n  Litmus milk cultures of plague show a very slight acidity while\r\n  with _B. pseudotuberculosis rodentium_ there is a high degree of\r\n  alkalinity produced.\r\n\r\n  Wherry has reported two cases of ulcerative conjunctivitis with\r\n  lymphadenitis of cervical glands, fever and marked prostration,\r\n  due to infection with _B. tularense_, occurring in persons who had\r\n  handled rabbits which had died of this plague-like infection. The\r\n  organism was first noted by McCoy in squirrels in California. The\r\n  symptoms and lesions in these animals are those of plague. Guinea\r\n  pigs succumb after the cutaneous inoculation of material and show\r\n  lesions markedly resembling plague. The organism, however, will\r\n  not grow on ordinary simple media as does the plague bacillus. As\r\n  will be noted in the chapter on Tularaemia the disease has a very\r\n  limited geographical distribution.\r\n\r\nThe _crucial test_ for any plague material is the power of the plague\r\nbacillus to infect a rat or guinea pig, when the material is rubbed\r\non the shaven skin of the animal. _B. tularense_ will also pass\r\nthrough intact shaven skin and it produces lesions in the guinea\r\npig similar to those of plague. Other organisms, however which might\r\ninfect through intact skin produce lesions unlike those of plague. As\r\na practical point it may be stated that cases showing a profusion of\r\noval, bipolarly staining bacilli, in smears from glands or sputum,\r\nand with clinical manifestations of plague, are not likely to be\r\nother than plague; still, to be conservative, one should always\r\ninoculate animals cutaneously or subcutaneously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—Plague bacillus involution forms produced by\r\ngrowing on 3% salt agar. (Kolle and Wasserman.)]\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—Plague is primarily a disease of rodents, usually\r\nrats, and man contracts his infection from these animals. With the\r\nexception of pneumonic plague which, under certain circumstances, is\r\ntransmitted directly from man to man, plague infections originate\r\nfrom the bite of fleas which have become infected from feeding on the\r\nblood of plague rats. Infected fleas act as intermediaries in plague\r\nepizootics among rats. It is true that a rat might become infected\r\nfrom bites received in a fight with an infected rat, or man might be\r\ninfected through a cut on a finger while handling plague material,\r\nbut such methods play but a small part in plague epidemiology.\r\n\r\n  _Fleas and Plague._—In 1897, Ogata infected mice by inoculating\r\n  them with an emulsion of crushed fleas taken from plague rats. In\r\n  1898 Simond showed that if a rat, dead of plague, were placed in a\r\n  large bottle and a healthy rat confined in a small cage introduced\r\n  into the bottle and suspended above the dead rat, so that there\r\n  could be no contact between the dead and the living animal, the\r\n  well rat would contract the disease. If however the fleas were\r\n  removed from the dead rat, before the introduction of the caged\r\n  rat, no infection took place.\r\n\r\nBy reason of claims that the rat flea would not bite man these\r\nconvincing experiments were in a measure disregarded. The complete\r\nconfirmation of the correctness of this view, as to transmission of\r\nbubonic plague, was brought about by the Indian Plague Commission.\r\nIn a large number of experiments it was shown that when healthy and\r\nplague-infected guinea pigs were confined together in spaces where\r\nthere were no fleas, there were no plague infections of any of these\r\nwell animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—1 and 2, male and female _Xenopsylla\r\ncheopis_. 3, Head of _Ceratophyllus_. 4 and 5, male and egg-distended\r\nfemale of _Sarcopsylla penetrans_.\r\n\r\n_Xenopsylla cheopis_ is the most important plague transmitter of the\r\nflea family as it is the common rat flea of India where there is so\r\nmuch plague.\r\n\r\n_Sarcopsylla_ or _Dermatophilus penetrans_ is an important factor in\r\na disabling skin disease, especially of the feet, in many parts of\r\nthe tropics.]\r\n\r\n  On the other hand in 35 experiments, when fleas had access to\r\n  the spaces, plague infections were the rule. Again, guinea pigs\r\n  in cages which were suspended only two inches above a plague\r\n  flea infected floor, became infected, but other animals, which\r\n  were suspended so high that the fleas could not jump up to them,\r\n  remained well. Two cages, each containing a monkey, were placed in\r\n  a plague flea infected room. One was surrounded with a protecting\r\n  zone of 6 inches of “tanglefoot” fly paper, this being the limit\r\n  of the distance a flea can jump, while the other cage was not\r\n  so protected. The monkey in the cage without the sticky paper\r\n  contracted plague while the second monkey remained well. It is\r\n  only when there is a great incidence of plague among rats that\r\n  we have outbreaks of bubonic plague in man, and it has been noted\r\n  that the greater the epizootic, the more heavily infected was the\r\n  blood of the sick rats with the plague bacilli. A flea with a\r\n  stomach capacity of about ½ c.mm. could take in several thousand\r\n  plague bacilli in a feeding on a rat whose blood was teeming with\r\n  bacilli. The blood of a rat dying with plague may contain as many\r\n  as fifty million bacilli to the cc. Human blood rarely contains\r\n  more than a million to the cc. There is a multiplication of the\r\n  organisms in the flea, so that when it defecates, thousands of\r\n  plague bacilli are deposited near the puncture wound made by the\r\n  flea when subsequently feeding on a man. The infected faeces are\r\n  rubbed into the wound by the man in scratching the site of the\r\n  bite, so that we have here an instance of a contaminative method of\r\n  infection as contrasted with the inoculative method by the mosquito\r\n  in malaria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—1, _Ctenocephalus felis_. 2, _Ceratophyllus\r\nfasciatus_. 3, _Hoplopsyllus anomalus_. 4, _Ctenopsylla musculi_.\r\n5, _Xenopsylla cheopis_. 6, _Pulex irritans_. 7, Internal anatomy\r\nof flea.

This makes an obstruction to the entrance of the\r\n  stomach resulting in starvation of the flea. This naturally makes\r\n  the flea more voracious and in the ineffectual muscular efforts\r\n  to take in blood, regurgitation of the contents of the oesophagus\r\n  occurs, thereby infecting the person upon whom the flea is trying\r\n  to feed. This obstruction apparently may be overcome in some way as\r\n  the plague-infected flea does not necessarily die. Still from lack\r\n  of sufficient fluid such fleas are liable to be killed off if the\r\n  relative humidity is low, as in dry weather. Further investigations\r\n  have shown that the proventricular plug may be channeled, but in\r\n  such case valve action is lost and the contents of the stomach are\r\n  regurgitated, thus making such a flea more dangerous than one with\r\n  an obstructed proventriculus. Such fleas may continue infectious\r\n  for 67 days.\r\n\r\n  Very interesting in this connection is the fact that Heiser found\r\n  plague-infected fleas in the desk of a European at Manila who died\r\n  of plague. A mummified rat was found in one of the drawers of\r\n  this desk, from which successful animal inoculations for plague\r\n  were made. Heiser notes that data would indicate that these fleas\r\n  probably remained alive 2 weeks after the death of the rat which\r\n  brought about their infection. Another very striking finding during\r\n  the same Manila plague outbreak (1912-1913) was that bedbugs found\r\n  on the sleeping mat of a human victim of plague showed bipolarly\r\n  staining bacilli.\r\n\r\n  Bacot has carried on experiments in which fleas infected two months\r\n  previously and kept in a cool place could transmit plague. This\r\n  would indicate the danger from plague-infected fleas which had been\r\n  held in material packed away in boxes.\r\n\r\n_Method of Spread._—The spread of plague epizootics among rats seems\r\nto be rather by the fierce brown sewer rat, _Mus norvegicus_. The\r\nmore delicate black house rat, _Mus rattus_, usually receives its\r\ninfection from the sewer rat. When the rat dies the fleas leave the\r\ndead body and seek a new host, preferably one similar to the one just\r\nabandoned. The sewer rat reaching the basement of houses and dying\r\nof plague is deserted by his fleas. These will attach themselves to\r\nthe house rats which go from basement to roof of the house and later\r\nthese dying are abandoned by the fleas which, in the absence of a\r\nrodent host, will feed on man and infect him.\r\n\r\n  The house rat is rarely found in Europe while in many parts of the\r\n  tropics it is common and in close association with man. The fact\r\n  that the sewer rat avoids the upper portions of houses probably\r\n  explains the greater infrequency of plague epidemics in Europe\r\n  where this rodent is common. In former ages when the house rat was\r\n  prevalent in Europe we had great epidemics there. _Mus (Rattus)\r\n  norvegicus_ is of stout build with a blunt nose and small opaque\r\n  ears which barely reach the eyes when laid forward. The tail is\r\n  shorter than the length of the head and body together (89% of such\r\n  length). With _Mus rattus_ we have a delicately built rat with a\r\n  slender head and sharp nose. The ears are translucent and large\r\n  and reach beyond the middle of the eye when extended. The rather\r\n  delicate tail is about 25% longer than the length of the head and\r\n  body taken together.\r\n\r\n  Recently it has been found that a guinea pig set free in a house\r\n  suspected of having plague fleas becomes infected if such fleas are\r\n  present. The fleas would probably prefer the guinea pig to man and\r\n  such a measure would in some degree be protective to man. It is\r\n  however for the detection of plague infection that the measure is\r\n  employed and the guinea pig is termed the “Plague barometer.” In\r\n  Madras there is practically an absence of _Mus norvegicus_ although\r\n  _Mus rattus_ is present in numbers and the comparative freedom of\r\n  the city from plague is striking.\r\n\r\n  The principal rat flea of the Orient is _Xenopsylla cheopis_. This\r\n  flea is without combs like _Pulex irritans_, the human flea, but\r\n  is of a lighter color and has an ocular bristle near the upper\r\n  margin of eye and two bristles posterior to the antennae. In Europe\r\n  and the United States _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_ is the common rat\r\n  flea. Many other species of fleas transmit plague and it is also\r\n  possible that the bedbug may play a part in spreading infections\r\n  from man to man. Vergbitski has transmitted plague from man to the\r\n  rat by infected bedbugs. In Siberia, a marmot, the tarabagan, is\r\n  supposed to play the part of the rat in plague transmission. In\r\n  California, the ground squirrel, _Citellus beecheyi_, has become\r\n  infected and may transmit the disease by its flea, _Ceratophyllus\r\n  acutus_. In the Tropics plague tends to prevail only at times when\r\n  the temperature is between 10° and 30°C. It is the effect on the\r\n  flea of cold weather which causes the disappearance of bubonic\r\n  plague at such times. The bacillus of plague can withstand freezing\r\n  temperatures. Sunlight and drying are the especially inimical\r\n  factors for _B. pestis_. Dry seasons are inimical to the spread of\r\n  plague and it is especially in very rainy seasons that epidemics\r\n  rage.\r\n\r\n_Chronic Plague in Rats._—The Indian investigators have called\r\nattention to the existence of a chronic plague in rats. In this we\r\nhave chronic buboes, areas of necrosis in spleen and abscesses of\r\nthe spleen. It is chiefly in the spleen that the lesions occur, thus\r\ndiffering from the acute plague in rats above described. Of 27,699\r\n_M. norvegicus_, examined in Bombay, O.57% showed signs of chronic\r\nplague.\r\n\r\n  In the necrotic material plague bacilli can be found in\r\n  approximately one-half of these rats although frequently the\r\n  bacilli are nonvirulent. It is possible that this chronic plague\r\n  in rats may serve as the reservoir of infection which keeps up\r\n  plague epizootics from year to year. Plague in India, according to\r\n  White is less virulent now than formerly and this is attributed to\r\n  a greater immunity of the rats.\r\n\r\n_As regards pneumonic plague_ the origin of such epidemics is\r\nprobably from pneumonia occurring secondarily in cases of bubonic\r\nplague. Provided the conditions are favorable, particularly as to\r\nmoisture in the air of the room, the infection spreads directly from\r\nman to man as a result of the droplets of heavily infected sputum\r\nbeing sprayed into the air in the act of coughing on the part of the\r\npatient. It is an instance of _Flügge’s droplet method of infection_.\r\n\r\n  In the recent epidemic of pneumonic plague in North China, it was\r\n  at first thought that the hunting of the tarabagan for its valuable\r\n  skin, which led some of the Chinese to even capture tarabagans,\r\n  possibly sick with plague, was the origin of the epidemic. This\r\n  view is no longer held and we now know that the outbreak was\r\n  independent of any disease in rats, tarabagans or other animals.\r\n  Strong has shown that the bacillus which was isolated from these\r\n  cases of pneumonic plague was identical with that isolated from\r\n  cases of bubonic plague; its virulence was no greater and animals\r\n  infected cutaneously or subcutaneously died of bubonic plague.\r\n  Experiments by Teague and Barber, with emulsions of plague bacilli,\r\n  showed that with a room temperature of 32°C. plague bacilli were\r\n  quickly destroyed when the air was comparatively dry. In such an\r\n  atmosphere, saturated with moisture, the viability would be greatly\r\n  prolonged. In the plague wards in Manchuria the extreme cold which\r\n  prevailed, together with the saturation of the atmosphere of the\r\n  unventilated rooms by the moisture of the breath of the patients,\r\n  made conditions most favorable for the viability of the plague\r\n  bacillus. They note that in the plains of India, although about 3%\r\n  of bubonic cases assume a pneumonic type, yet epidemics of plague\r\n  pneumonia do not occur; this is probably due to the fact that\r\n  the higher temperatures and open rooms make evaporation occur 30\r\n  times more rapidly there than was the case in the plague wards in\r\n  the bitter cold weather of the Manchurian winter. The possibility\r\n  of carriers of plague bacilli in those who might go on to\r\n  convalescence need not be considered, as practically all cases of\r\n  plague pneumonia die. Other material from the patient than sputum\r\n  does not seem to be a source of danger in the spread of plague,\r\n  so that there is no need for the disinfection of urine and feces.\r\n  There has recently been an outbreak of septicaemic plague in Ceylon\r\n  in which there was an absence of plague in the rats. The infection\r\n  was possibly transferred directly through bedbugs or human fleas.\r\n  As a matter of experience the transference of plague from place to\r\n  place generally occurs from infected rats or infected fleas which\r\n  have been transported by ships. A case of bubonic plague in a ward\r\n  with other patients would not be a source of danger provided there\r\n  was freedom from fleas and a lack of development of secondary\r\n  pneumonias. It is very doubtful as to infection ever taking place\r\n  by way of the alimentary canal, although there is some evidence\r\n  that rarely the tonsil may be primarily involved. Monkeys are very\r\n  susceptible to plague and the possibility of an epizootic among\r\n  them should be thought of during plague epidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nIt is rare that one finds the primary vesicle marking the site of\r\nentrance of the plague material. Thus in 13 cases where plague was\r\ncontracted by direct cutaneous inoculation of those performing\r\nautopsies on plague victims only two showed evidences of local\r\nreaction as shown by the formation of a primary vesicle.\r\n\r\n  The chief points noted in a plague autopsy are: (1) The marked\r\n  involvement of the lymphatic system as shown by intense congestion\r\n  and haemorrhagic oedema of the lymphatic glands. Not only are\r\n  the glands tributary to the site of inoculation involved, thus\r\n  forming the primary bubo, but there is secondarily more or less\r\n  inflammatory change in all the lymphatic glands of the body.\r\n  There is also a marked periglandular oedema, with haemorrhagic\r\n  extravasations of the connective tissue surrounding the primary\r\n  bubo, this mass being made up of a group of glands matted together\r\n  by this periglandular exudate.\r\n\r\n  (2) The destructive effect of a toxic product of the plague\r\n  bacillus, which may be designated an endotheliolysin, upon the\r\n  endothelial cell lining of blood vessels as well as lymphatic ones.\r\n  This causes the extensive blood extravasations so characteristic of\r\n  plague as shown by petechial spots, not only of the skin but of the\r\n  serous and mucous membranes as well.\r\n\r\nThere is a general congestion of all organs of the body.\r\n\r\n  The meninges of the brain are deeply congested and there may be\r\n  haemorrhagic extravasations in the brain substance itself. Crowell\r\n  has reported two cases of plague meningitis in which plague bacilli\r\n  were found in the ventricular pus. The spleen is generally markedly\r\n  congested and enlarged to 2 or 3 times its normal size.\r\n\r\n  There may be haemorrhagic extravasations throughout the spleen\r\n  pulp. The bacilli are chiefly scattered throughout the venous\r\n  sinuses.\r\n\r\n  There is also active congestion of the liver. The kidneys are\r\n  intensely congested and we often find fibrin thrombi in the tufts\r\n  of the Malpighian bodies.\r\n\r\nThe plague toxin has a marked effect on the cardiac muscle so that\r\nwe usually find dilatation of the right side of the heart with fatty\r\ndegeneration of the muscle fibers.\r\n\r\n  In a study of the pathology of primary pneumonic plague Strong\r\n  noted pericardial and pleural ecchymoses with fibrinous pleurisy\r\n  over the affected lung areas.\r\n\r\n  The process was at first lobular but later involved the entire lobe.\r\n\r\n  There was marked congestion of the bronchial mucosa with\r\n  involvement of the bronchial glands. The larynx and trachea are\r\n  also intensely congested. Microscopically there is a distension of\r\n  the alveoli and bronchial passages with a haemorrhagic exudate.\r\n  There is practically no fibrin in the alveolar exudate. The process\r\n  seems to extend by continuity along the bronchi and bronchioles.\r\n\r\n  Plague bacilli pack the exudate found in the bronchi and\r\n  bronchioles.\r\n\r\n  In a report on the autopsy findings of septicaemic plague in Ceylon\r\n  in cases where plague bacilli were demonstrated in smears and\r\n  cultures from spleen and blood, Castellani noted that other than\r\n  meningeal congestion and some splenic enlargement there was nothing\r\n  abnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn a clinical study of plague it is customary to consider the disease\r\nas manifesting itself in a mild form (Pestis minor) and a severe form\r\n(Pestis major).\r\n\r\n=Pestis Minor.=—Pestis minor, which is sometimes termed pestis\r\nambulans, is that form of plague in which there is only slight fever\r\nand comparatively little physical prostration or mental hebetude.\r\nThese cases usually show moderate enlargement and tenderness of some\r\ngroup of lymphatic glands. It is in this mild form of plague that we\r\nare most apt to find the primary vesicle or phlyctenule at the site\r\nof the flea bite.\r\n\r\n  Ordinarily, man is so susceptible to plague that there is no\r\n  reaction at the site of inoculation but in these mild cases there\r\n  is an inflammatory reaction resulting in a vesicle or pustule,\r\n  which may teem with plague bacilli. In such cases it is extremely\r\n  important to search for such primary vesicles and examine for\r\n  plague bacilli. It is usually stated that only about 5% of cases of\r\n  bubonic plague show these vesicles.\r\n\r\n=Pestis Major.=—Pestis major can certainly be divided clinically\r\nand epidemiologically into two types, pestis bubonica, or bubonic\r\nplague, which is the common type of plague, and pestis pneumonica,\r\nor pneumonic plague, the contagiousness of which is extreme and the\r\nmortality practically 100%.\r\n\r\n  Both of these types of plague tend finally to show an invasion\r\n  of the blood stream with plague bacilli, the case then becoming\r\n  one of septicaemic plague. Many authors, however, recognize an\r\n  overwhelming plague septicaemia in which the manifestations of\r\n  buboes or pneumonia are absent and such cases are designated\r\n  septicaemic plague, or _pestis siderans_.\r\n\r\nIn all forms of pestis major there stand out the characteristics of\r\nrather sudden onset, rigors or chilly sensations, rapidly rising but\r\nirregular fever, marked giddiness, great prostration, the mental\r\nstate and speech of an intoxicated person and extreme weakness of the\r\nheart with a rapid weak pulse.\r\n\r\n  Typhus fever alone shows an equal degree of early mental hebetude,\r\n  so that it is stated that Clot Bey, who had seen much plague\r\n  in Egypt, when elsewhere shown cases of typhus with parotid\r\n  involvement, remarked “In Egypt one would call such cases plague.”\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case of Bubonic Plague.=—After a period of incubation\r\nof from three to seven days the disease may set in quite abruptly,\r\nor after a prodromal stage, in which malaise, giddiness, mental\r\nhebetude and pains in the back and limbs may be present. With the\r\nonset of the attack the effects of the toxaemia upon the nervous\r\nsystem are the most striking. The patient has a pale, drawn, anxious\r\ncountenance, with injection of the conjunctivae toward the inner\r\ncanthus.\r\n\r\n  The speech is thick and difficult, the gait is staggering, so that,\r\n  with the stupid mental state and tendency to wander aimlessly\r\n  about, one has the symptom-complex of an alcoholic intoxication. In\r\n  some cases a delirious tendency may be marked, especially as the\r\n  disease develops. After a few hours, or within a day, the fever\r\n  begins to rise rapidly and is often associated with shivering\r\n  attacks. The face now becomes hot and flushed, the conjunctivae\r\n  markedly injected, the pupils dilated, and the eyes rather staring.\r\n  The temperature is as a rule from 102° to 104°F., occasionally\r\n  higher, with a tendency to rather marked remissions and, on the\r\n  whole, of great irregularity of the fever curve. The pulse is rapid\r\n  and shows early indications of the extreme toxic effect exercised\r\n  upon the heart. Cardiac weakness is a marked feature of plague.\r\n\r\n  The urinary secretion is diminished but there is rarely more than a\r\n  slight amount of albumin.\r\n\r\n  _The Pathognomonic Bubo._—About the second or third day the\r\n  development of an extremely painful bubo practically gives the\r\n  diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAbout 70% of these buboes are of the inguinal region, the femoral\r\nglands being more frequently invaded than those above Poupart’s\r\nligament. The axillary glands are involved in about 20% and the\r\nsubmaxillary and cervical ones in from 5 to 10% of cases.\r\n\r\n  There is a question whether the tonsil ever serves as the site of\r\n  infection from which cervical buboes result. It would seem that\r\n  the greater frequency of inguinal buboes is because a greater area\r\n  of skin drains into these glands. There may be multiple buboes\r\n  and it must not be forgotten that the lymphatic glands of any\r\n  region may become enlarged. There may also be lymphangitis. Only\r\n  one gland of a group may be involved or the whole group may show\r\n  enlargement. Very characteristic for plague buboes is the oedema\r\n  of the periglandular tissues, which is largely responsible for the\r\n  great size of some of these buboes; they may vary from the size of\r\n  an almond or walnut to that of a child’s head. The patient tends to\r\n  assume an attitude to relieve any tension on the very painful bubo.\r\n  Particularly over these buboes, but at times elsewhere, the skin\r\n  may show areas of inflammation, often several inches in diameter.\r\n  Necrosis of this area occurs and a slough separates. These lesions\r\n  are often termed carbuncles but are really not such, but only\r\n  gangrenous patches of skin.\r\n\r\nWhen these areas of cutaneous necrosis are a marked feature the\r\ndesignation of _cellulo-cutaneous plague_ is at times given.\r\n\r\n  Petechiae or large purpuric spots may be conspicuous in some\r\n  epidemics and it was from these “tokens,” as they were called, that\r\n  plague received the designation “black death.”\r\n\r\nAs the case progresses, the anxious countenance gives way to one of\r\napathy, the control of speech and cerebration become more and more\r\nimpaired and the patient may go into a typhoid state.\r\n\r\n  Cases with buboes in the axillae give the gravest prognosis, as\r\n  for example, 80% mortality for axillary, and 70% for inguinal.\r\n  The buboes may suppurate towards the end of a week or they may\r\n  undergo a slow resolution. Secondary broncho-pneumonia may develop\r\n  in the course of bubonic plague. Pulmonary congestion is however\r\n  not infrequent and may cause dyspnoea, accelerated respiration and\r\n  cough. Owing to the tendency to degeneration of the endothelial\r\n  lining of capillaries, various haemorrhagic manifestations, other\r\n  than those of the skin, may be observed, such as epistaxis,\r\n  haematuria, etc. There is usually a rather marked leucocytosis in\r\n  which the increase is chiefly of the polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—A, Temperature chart of fatal case of\r\nbubonic plague. B, Chart of case of bubonic plague going on to\r\nrecovery but with suppuration of plague bubo. C, Chart of fatal case\r\nof pneumonic plague.]\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case of Pneumonic Plague.=—Besides those cases where\r\npulmonary involvement sets in during the course of an attack\r\nof bubonic plague and which are classified as secondary plague\r\npneumonias we have sporadic cases and epidemics when the clinical\r\ncourse of the disease is predominantly and primarily pulmonary.\r\n\r\n  Although the characteristics of pulmonary involvement, with\r\n  expectoration of blood, were noted by many observers of the\r\n  14th century and later as manifestations of plague, yet in the\r\n  present pandemic, which started in 1894, such cases were at first\r\n  overlooked as being plague. The recognition of a primary pneumonic\r\n  plague was made by Childe in 1897. The onset is sudden, with a\r\n  rise of temperature to 103°F., or higher, during the first day.\r\n  The marked physical exhaustion and clouding of the consciousness,\r\n  characteristic of any type of pestis major, are intensified in\r\n  pneumonic plague. In fact the occurrence of manifestations of such\r\n  profound toxaemia in the presence of only slight physical signs,\r\n  should make one suspicious. Crepitation over small areas, without\r\n  demonstrable dulness on percussion, may be the only sign. There is\r\n  often early dyspnoea and rapid shallow respiration. Cough, with the\r\n  expectoration of rather abundant watery sputum, which soon becomes\r\n  blood-stained or absolutely sanguineous, may be present by the\r\n  second day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—Axillary Bubo. (Reproduced from Simpson’s\r\nTreatise on Plague, 1905.) From Jackson’s Tropical Medicine.]\r\n\r\nThere is never the rusty, tenacious sputum of lobar pneumonia. Herpes\r\nnever appears, according to Childe. Heart failure is a very prominent\r\nfeature of plague pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  It is fortunate that this watery sputum teems with bacilli early\r\n  in the disease as smears from such sputum give an early and sure\r\n  diagnosis of this terribly contagious and fatal malady. The\r\n  knowledge that this infection is transmitted from man to man by\r\n  the droplets of sputum expelled in coughing demands the protection\r\n  by some form of mask of anyone coming near such a patient. Some\r\n  observers noted splenic enlargement and tenderness over the\r\n  superficial lymphatic glands. Strong has noted that the course of\r\n  the disease rarely extends beyond the fourth day and that death is\r\n  the invariable termination.\r\n\r\n  In 1919 thirteen cases of plague pneumonia occurred in California\r\n  starting from an at first unrecognized case of bubonic plague of\r\n  squirrel origin. These pneumonias were diagnosed as influenza\r\n  pneumonias but later the true diagnosis was determined. McCoy notes\r\n  in this connection that there is a strong tendency to pulmonary\r\n  localization of plague in the squirrel which is not true of the rat.\r\n\r\n=Septicaemic Plague.=—As regards the clinical manifestations of\r\nsepticaemic plague, if such be considered as a separate type, Choksy\r\nstates that there is no clinical sign by which such a septicaemia\r\ncan be recognized without the help of the laboratory, although the\r\npresence of a thready or imperceptible pulse, in one showing the\r\ncharacteristic toxaemia of plague, should cause suspicion.\r\n\r\n  The patient may be so overwhelmed from the start that there may be\r\n  only a slight rise of temperature. Occasionally, plague bacilli may\r\n  be recognized in blood smears, a finding that practically never\r\n  obtains in any other bacterial disease. At the same time blood\r\n  cultures are solely to be depended upon in diagnosis and even such\r\n  examinations may be negative. Liston has noted that plague patients\r\n  always die if more than 40 bacilli per cc. are present in the\r\n  blood. In a recent outbreak of septicaemic plague in Ceylon the\r\n  only clinical manifestations were intense headache, and fever. The\r\n  patients died within forty-eight hours. Until properly diagnosed\r\n  bacteriologically the disease was thought to be pernicious malaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Symptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _General Appearance._—The face is at first drawn and pallid, the\r\n  eyes injected and the expression one of fear or anxiety. As the\r\n  temperature rises the pallor is succeeded by a flushed and dry hot\r\n  skin. Later on in the disease the expression is more one of apathy.\r\n  The staggering gait and the tendency to wander give the impression\r\n  of alcoholic intoxication.\r\n\r\n  _Temperature Curve._—The fever course of plague is very irregular.\r\n  The temperature usually rises rapidly to 103° to 104°F., but tends\r\n  to exhibit marked remissions by the third day. After a fall, it may\r\n  rise to a very high degree just before death. Cases which recover\r\n  often show a fall by lysis.\r\n\r\n  _Nervous System._—Very characteristic for plague is the intense\r\n  and early disturbance of the mental condition. The patient presents\r\n  the characteristics of alcoholic intoxication, thick speech, lack\r\n  of mental concentration and giddiness which causes a staggering\r\n  gait. Later on an apathetic or stuporous stage may ensue or there\r\n  may be delirium.\r\n\r\n  Rarely a case of bubonic plague may show marked involvement of the\r\n  meninges, giving the clinical picture of meningitis.\r\n\r\n  _Circulatory System._—The pulse is at first soft, dicrotic and\r\n  rapid, 110 to 120 beats per minute. Later on, as the heart begins\r\n  to show the toxic effects of the disease, the pulse becomes thready\r\n  and irregular, to be followed by cardiac failure. There is a\r\n  marked tendency to congestion of various internal organs and to\r\n  haemorrhages from the capillaries.\r\n\r\n  _Respiratory System._—Pulmonary congestion and even\r\n  broncho-pneumonia may supervene in bubonic plague. In pneumonic\r\n  plague, however, the lungs seem to be the primary seat of the\r\n  bacterial development. Plague pneumonia is characterized by intense\r\n  toxaemia and few physical signs. The abundant, watery sanguineous\r\n  sputum is loaded with plague bacilli. Dyspnoea and cyanosis appear\r\n  early.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.—Plague Carbuncle. (Reproduced from Simpson’s\r\nTreatise on Plague 1905.) From Jackson’s Tropical Medicine.]\r\n\r\n  _The Lymphatic System._—It is the presence of the plague bubo\r\n  which differentiates bubonic plague. There is no relation between\r\n  the size of the bubo and the severity of the attack. Axillary\r\n  buboes are the most fatal. A characteristic of these buboes is\r\n  their extreme tenderness, the pain causing the patient to draw up\r\n  the legs or assume any attitude which will relieve tension upon the\r\n  bubo. The size is mainly due to the periglandular infiltration or\r\n  oedema, which causes the glands of a group to be matted together.\r\n\r\n  The elevation of a plague bubo is rather diffuse, not pointed as\r\n  with venereal buboes. Femoro-inguinal buboes are about 6 times as\r\n  frequent as cervico-maxillary ones. There may be lymphangitis as\r\n  well as lymphadenitis.\r\n\r\n  _Cutaneous System._—The skin over the buboes often tends to become\r\n  necrotic and slough off. This however may occur elsewhere and\r\n  such lesions are termed “carbuncles.” Capillary haemorrhages of\r\n  the skin may cause petechiae and when the area is large they have\r\n  been designated “tokens.” In about 5% of cases there is a small\r\n  vesicle or pustule at the site of the flea bite as an indication of\r\n  reaction. The contents teem with plague bacilli. It is often termed\r\n  the primary lesion.\r\n\r\n  _The Liver, Spleen and Alimentary Tract._—The spleen may show\r\n  enlargement and tenderness on deep pressure, as may also the liver,\r\n  these organs being markedly congested. The tongue at first is\r\n  coated, with clean tip and sides. Nausea and vomiting frequently\r\n  occur and, as a rule, there is constipation. Haemorrhages from the\r\n  bowel may occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—It is well to remember that we have a sure and\r\nsimple means of diagnosis by bacteriological means so that in the\r\nfirst cases during an epidemic we should rest the determination of\r\nthe case as one of plague solely upon such methods.\r\n\r\n  One should be suspicious of any case of fever of rapid onset\r\n  in which there is marked dulling of intellect and impairment\r\n  of speech, as of one intoxicated, together with evidences of\r\n  rapidly developing heart weakness. In septicaemic plague we\r\n  practically have no other symptoms to guide us—there is not the\r\n  exquisitely tender bubo of bubonic plague nor the abundant, watery,\r\n  sanguinolent sputum of pneumonic plague.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever probably more nearly resembles plague at its onset than\r\nany other disease. There is marked clouding of the consciousness and\r\nintense prostration as with plague and the eruption does not appear\r\nbefore about the fourth day.\r\n\r\n  An influenza pneumonia may show the general prostration and cardiac\r\n  weakness of plague. In influenza pneumonia we have an onset\r\n  with the features of ordinary influenza, which, however, in the\r\n  influenza epidemic in 1918 was often short. In plague pneumonia\r\n  we have pneumonia from the start. The pulse in plague is early\r\n  weak and rapid and the tendency to a stuporous state more marked.\r\n  The early appearance of thin watery sputum, which quickly becomes\r\n  blood-tinged and always contains plague bacilli is noted in plague\r\n  pneumonia. Only a few hours elapse before we have bloody sputum\r\n  which in influenza is a later and not constant sign. The dyspnoea\r\n  is earlier and much more pronounced in the pneumonic plague. At\r\n  autopsy Crowell notes the almost invariable presence of pleural\r\n  exudates in plague while an acute vesicular emphysema is a feature\r\n  of influenza pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  Malaria and septicaemic conditions may be confused with septicaemic\r\n  plague. The sudden onset and prostration of relapsing fever may\r\n  make one think of plague.\r\n\r\n  Many have thought climatic bubo a form of ambulant plague but the\r\n  gradual onset, only slight tenderness of the swollen glands and\r\n  slight prostration should differentiate. Venereal bubo cases are\r\n  apt to be regarded with suspicion during epidemics.\r\n\r\n  Markedly toxic cases of typhoid fever with an exceptionally rapid\r\n  onset may give rise to confusion.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—If the patient has a bubo we should\r\nintroduce a hypodermic syringe needle into the swollen, oedematous\r\nglandular mass in order to obtain some of the gland juice. Smear a\r\ndrop of this on a slide, stain with Loeffler’s blue or dilute carbol\r\nfuchsin and examine for bipolarly stained oval bacilli. When the bubo\r\nbegins to soften we may not obtain plague bacilli.\r\n\r\nProbably the best stain for plague bacilli is that recommended by\r\nArchibald. There are two solutions, one made by dissolving 0.5 gram\r\nof thionin and 2.5 grams phenol crystals in a 1% aqueous solution of\r\nformalin; the other solution is made by dissolving 0.5 gram methylene\r\nblue and 2.5 grams phenol crystals in a 1% formalin solution. Let\r\nthese stock solutions stand 24 hours before using and then mix equal\r\nparts of each solution; filter, and stain smear for 10 seconds. Wash\r\nand dry.\r\n\r\n  In a case of suspected pneumonic plague we stain the smear of\r\n  watery or thin blood-tinged sputum as above.\r\n\r\nThe same procedure may be followed with a rather heavy blood smear of\r\na drop of the 5 or 10 cc. taken from a vein for culturing in a case\r\nsuspected of septicaemic plague.\r\n\r\n  Plague is practically the only bacterial disease where there\r\n  is likelihood of finding the causative organism in smears. In\r\n  septicaemic plague the blood culture is the proper procedure and\r\n  one should take 5 to 15 cc. of blood in 15 to 25 cc. of normal\r\n  saline containing 1% of sodium citrate. This prevents coagulation\r\n  and at one’s leisure 1 or 2 cc. can be added to tubes of melted\r\n  agar and plates poured or other portions added to bouillon or 3%\r\n  salt agar. This same blood emulsion can be used to infect guinea\r\n  pigs subcutaneously or to infect them cutaneously by rubbing on the\r\n  shaven surface.\r\n\r\n  In smears from material from buboes, from sputum, or in blood\r\n  smears, as well as from blood or spleen smears from experimental\r\n  animals, we obtain the typical morphology of a cocco-bacillus (1.5\r\n  × 0.5 microns) with very characteristic bipolar staining, there\r\n  being an intermediate, unstained area. Very characteristic also\r\n  is the appearance in these smears of degenerate types which stain\r\n  feebly and show coccoid and inflated oval types. The presence\r\n  of these involution forms associated with typical bacilli is\r\n  almost diagnostic for one with experience. Inoculating tubes of\r\n  plain agar and 3% salt agar with this same material, we obtain\r\n  in plain agar cultures organisms which are, typically, small,\r\n  fairly slender rods, which do not stain characteristically at\r\n  each end and are not oval. The smear obtained from the salt agar\r\n  presents most remarkable involution forms—coccoid, root-shaped,\r\n  sausage-shaped forms, ranging from three to twelve microns in\r\n  length, more resembling cultures of moulds than bacteria. Another\r\n  point is that on the inoculated plain agar we are in doubt at the\r\n  end of twenty-four hours whether the dew-drop colonies are really\r\n  bacterial colonies or only condensation particles. By the second\r\n  day, however, these colonies have an opaque grayish appearance,\r\n  so that now, instead of questioning the presence of a culture, we\r\n  consider the possibility of contamination.\r\n\r\nBlood cultures in septicaemic plague may show from 5 to 500,000\r\nbacilli per cc. Smears from the blood in such cases are positive in\r\nonly about 17%.\r\n\r\n  The plague bacillus grows well at room temperature—its optimum\r\n  temperature being 30° instead of 37°C., as is usual with pathogens.\r\n  Next to the salt agar culture, the most characteristic one is\r\n  the stalactite growth in bouillon containing oil drops on its\r\n  surface. The culture grows downward from the under surface of the\r\n  oil drops as a powdery thread. These are very fragile, and as the\r\n  slightest jar breaks them, it is difficult to obtain this cultural\r\n  characteristic.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht and Ghon have shown that by smearing material upon the\r\nintact, shaven skin of a guinea pig, infection occurs. This is the\r\ncrucial test. Smear the material on a shaven surface about 1 inch\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n  A pocket made by cutting the skin of a guinea pig with scissors\r\n  and extended subcutaneously with scissors or forceps, into which\r\n  a piece of the suspected plague tissue is thrust with forceps, is\r\n  more practical than injecting an emulsion with hypodermic syringe.\r\n\r\n  Mice inoculated at the root of the tail succumb quickly. Rats, this\r\n  being primarily a disease of rats, are of course susceptible.\r\n\r\n  When a guinea pig is inoculated with plague material the animal\r\n  should be placed in a galvanized iron garbage can or other similar\r\n  container and the opening covered with cheese cloth to prevent the\r\n  fleas or other vermin which it might harbor from escaping. Again a\r\n  6-inch band of tanglefoot fly paper should be attached around the\r\n  interior of the upper part of the can to further prevent escape of\r\n  fleas. It must be remembered that every precaution must be taken\r\n  in the laboratory to prevent the escape of plague-infected fleas.\r\n  The guinea pig usually dies in from two to five days and shows\r\n  glandular enlargements, and marked congestion of viscera with a\r\n  swollen spleen, smears from which may show a profusion of plague\r\n  bacilli.\r\n\r\nThe subcutaneous tissues about the site of inoculation show a\r\nhaemorrhagic oedema.\r\n\r\n  If guinea pigs are not available one may use white mice which die\r\n  within forty-eight hours or white rats which live about as long as\r\n  guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n  One of the most important points in fighting plague is the\r\n  detection of plague in the rats and, from noting the locality in\r\n  which such plague-infected rats were caught, to direct our rat\r\n  destruction efforts to that particular section of the city. These\r\n  dead rats should be dropped into a bichloride solution or petroleum\r\n  preparation in order to destroy the rat fleas. In the laboratory\r\n  they are dissected and plague-infected ones most easily recognized\r\n  by the marked subcutaneous injection of the widely reflected\r\n  skin flap. Oedematous or haemorrhagic glandular swellings are\r\n  characteristic. The liver shows a yellowish appearance, and as\r\n  if sprinkled with small whitish dots and the spleen is swollen\r\n  and congested. There may be effusion into the pleural cavities.\r\n  Material from the swollen glands or spleen should be stained,\r\n  cultured and inoculated into animals as for a human case.\r\n\r\nIf glandular, splenic or other material from human or rat autopsies\r\nhas to be sent to a distant laboratory the specimen should be placed\r\nin a strong salt mouth bottle containing 20% glycerine in water with\r\n2% calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n  Agglutination is not very practical owing to the frequent absence\r\n  of agglutinins from the serum of plague patients. Then, too, there\r\n  is a marked tendency to spontaneous agglutination on the part of\r\n  the plague bacilli. Strong states that culturing at 37°C. lessens\r\n  this tendency to spontaneous agglutination. Again, even when\r\n  present, the titre of plague-agglutinating sera is usually quite\r\n  low so that one must work with dilutions of from 1 to 10 or 1 to 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nPneumonic and septicaemic plague give an almost absolutely\r\nunfavorable prognosis, many stating that every such case dies.\r\n\r\n  As regards bubonic plague the mortality averages 75%. The Egyptian\r\n  epidemic of 1900 gave an average mortality of 50%. The mortality\r\n  in natives is much higher than that among Europeans, these latter\r\n  often showing death rates under 25% while in the same epidemic\r\n  natives show from 75% to 95% mortality. Plague pneumonia, however,\r\n  is absolutely fatal for Europeans as well as natives.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—In pneumonic plague it is the human patient and not\r\nthe rat which has to be considered. The infection is spread by means\r\nof droplets of plague bacilli-laden sputum which are sprayed from the\r\nmouth of the patient in the act of coughing. As a result any person\r\nentering a ward containing plague pneumonia cases is extremely liable\r\nto contract the pneumonic form of plague.\r\n\r\n  The attendants are protected by bag-like masks or successive layers\r\n  of gauze and cotton wool applied as bandages over face and neck.\r\n  Motoring goggles make a good protection for the eyes and small\r\n  rolls of cotton should be placed along the sides of the nose to\r\n  absolutely prevent the possibility of bacilli being drawn down to\r\n  the entrance of nose or mouth. These masks should not have any weak\r\n  spot in their armor.\r\n\r\n  _Spread of plague pneumonia_.—It has been noted that when\r\n  secondary pneumonia develops in the course of bubonic plague in\r\n  India, the Philippines, or other hot countries, it is not followed\r\n  by primary plague pneumonia outbreaks. This is thought to be due to\r\n  the fact that the windows are wide open and the relative humidity\r\n  low, conditions which are the opposite of those which existed\r\n  in Manchuria where the intense cold made the closing of windows\r\n  necessary and where the air of rooms or wards was saturated with\r\n  the moisture from the occupants. As the main consideration for the\r\n  spread of pneumonic plague seems to be high relative humidity it\r\n  would seem that hospital wards could be constructed so that the air\r\n  supplied by artificial ventilation would be very dry.\r\n\r\nThe recent outbreak of septicaemic plague in Ceylon at a time\r\nwhen there was no plague noted in rats would indicate that other\r\ntransmitting agents than infected rat fleas were operative. The most\r\nprobable transmitting insects to be suspected would be the bedbug and\r\nhuman flea.\r\n\r\n  _Spread of bubonic plague_.—With bubonic plague, unless it should\r\n  in its course become pneumonic or septicaemic, there is almost\r\n  solely the question of the rat and its fleas. Many authorities\r\n  consider that pure bubonic plague can be treated safely in a\r\n  general ward of a hospital provided there is sure freedom from\r\n  bedbugs or other verminous insects.\r\n\r\n  The various species of fleas which the rat may harbor may be\r\n  attacked by the use of various petroleum preparations containing\r\n  naphthalene. One preparation known as pesterine, which consists of\r\n  kerosene 20 parts, soft soap 1 part and water 5 parts, the soap\r\n  being dissolved in the water and the oil being gradually stirred\r\n  into the hot mixture, is often recommended as a flea insecticide. A\r\n  5% solution of compound cresol to which naphthalene has been added\r\n  is also of value.\r\n\r\nIt is always well to combine flea destruction with rat extermination\r\nbecause, as rats are reduced in numbers, there are fewer hosts,\r\nso that man is more liable to infection with fleas deprived of a\r\nsufficient number of rat hosts.\r\n\r\n  This may explain why a high death rate among rats, as the result of\r\n  a plague epizootic, may act as a factor in the outbreak of human\r\n  plague.\r\n\r\n_Rat destruction_.—As a matter of fact, however, it is best to\r\nattack the problem from the side of rat extermination which, it\r\nmust be understood, is most difficult owing to the highly developed\r\nsuspicious nature of the rat. A successful rat catcher or rat\r\nexterminator must have the mind of a detective.\r\n\r\n  The first measure in rat extermination is the regulation of the\r\n  disposal of garbage. It is most important that only cans with\r\n  securely fitting tops be used so that rats cannot secure any food\r\n  from the contents of the can. Again no particle of food should be\r\n  left accessible to the rat. Unless the ordinary food supply of the\r\n  rat is denied him he will not eat poisoned bait or bait in traps.\r\n  Again rats are not only carnivorous but will eat any kind of cereal\r\n  or vegetable, in fact they will eat almost anything and in addition\r\n  are cannibals. In a plague outbreak especial attention should be\r\n  directed to flooring in stables, under surfaces of board walks,\r\n  sealed-in attics of houses, wharves and sewers. Where sewers have\r\n  catch-basins at street openings the rat has a means of egress from\r\n  the sewer. These sedimenting catch-basins also serve as a breeding\r\n  place for mosquitoes. It has been estimated that a sewer rat can\r\n  jump 2 feet but not 3 feet.\r\n\r\n  In rat-proofing houses, double walls should be eliminated and\r\n  houses raised well from the ground—at least 18 inches. In\r\n  plugging up rat holes with concrete we should add broken glass to\r\n  the concrete. Sheets of galvanized iron driven down several feet\r\n  have been used as a protecting barrier around grain elevators or\r\n  warehouses. Concrete is the proper material to use in rat proofing.\r\n\r\nWhere rats are on board ship fumigations with sulphur dioxide, carbon\r\nmonoxide or funnel gases are usually employed.\r\n\r\n  Hydrocyanic acid gas is a most efficient destroyer of rat and flea\r\n  life. The great objection to its use is its danger to those using\r\n  it in fumigation. Liston allows this gas, developed from ½ ounce\r\n  KCN, to act for four hours in a space of 100 cubic feet. The great\r\n  danger from the use of this gas in holds of ships is that it tends\r\n  to collect in detached spaces or pockets and remains following\r\n  ventilation of the hold so that persons entering such spaces\r\n  suffer the poisonous effects of the gas. Some cargo ships have a\r\n  rat-run built to extend fore and aft and leading to a receptacle\r\n  in which the rats are caught. Rats naturally choose a tube or\r\n  similar opening so they get into this little passageway which is so\r\n  constructed that their return is obstructed. This scheme is used\r\n  in setting traps, either covering the traps with hay and leaving\r\n  a small opening or placing the trap under an inclined plank or\r\n  placing it at the end of an iron or terracotta pipe. There is not\r\n  much danger of rats getting aboard a ship lying out from the dock.\r\n  It is when a ship goes alongside a dock that we can expect rats to\r\n  come aboard.\r\n\r\n  Phosphorus paste made up with a glucose base and containing about\r\n  4% of phosphorus is spread on pieces of stale bread, 1 inch square\r\n  and ¾ inch thick. Whatever poison is used, whether strychnine,\r\n  arsenic or phosphorus, it should be placed in boxes which have\r\n  openings large enough to let the rats in but too small for\r\n  domesticated animals. Barium carbonate is a useful rat poison.\r\n\r\n  Cats will very rarely attack the fierce sewer rat.\r\n\r\n  _Danysz virus._—Many workers, during plague outbreaks, have tried\r\n  to exterminate rats by impregnating bread or other bait with\r\n  bacterial cultures. The best known of these viruses, as they are\r\n  called, is that of Danysz. The organism is closely related to _B.\r\n  enteriditis_ of Gaertner and is supposed to bring about a fatal\r\n  infection in the rats. As a matter of fact the cultures quickly\r\n  cease to be virulent and their use has been generally abandoned.\r\n  Simpson, however, thinks well of this measure and employed it with\r\n  success in South Africa. He kept up the virulence of his cultures\r\n  by frequent passage through animals.\r\n\r\nIn rat extermination it is advisable to employ Heiser’s Manila plan.\r\nIn this, the location in the city of the plague rats brought into\r\nthe laboratory is noted and radiating lines made from such foci.\r\nPlague-infected rats are rarely found more than a few squares from\r\nthe focus. The periphery of the infected area is then considered as\r\nan outer zone for the fight and the house-to-house extermination is\r\ncarried on toward the center of the area. If, on the other hand, one\r\nshould start at the center and work peripherally the infected rats\r\nmight be spread all over the city.\r\n\r\n_Prophylaxis by Immunization._—The best-known bacterial prophylactic\r\nis that of Haffkine. Stalactite bouillon cultures are grown in flasks\r\nfor five to six weeks. The organisms are then killed by heat at\r\n65°C. for one hour. Phenol (½%) is then added and from 0.5 to 4 cc.\r\ninjected according to the age and size of the individual. Ten days\r\nlater a still larger amount is injected. The reaction following these\r\ninjections is apt to be quite severe.\r\n\r\n  Recent reports show that of 118,148 inoculated persons the plague\r\n  incidence was approximately 8 per 1000 while among 321,621\r\n  noninoculated the incidence was 34 per 1000.\r\n\r\n  Statistics from Sagaing show 19 cases with 7 deaths among 4284\r\n  inoculated persons while there were 134 cases and 128 deaths among\r\n  4467 not inoculated.\r\n\r\n  The plague mortality in cases which had previously been inoculated\r\n  was 40% while that among the noninoculated was 78%.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen that incidence is reduced to about\r\none-fourth and mortality about one-half as the result of the use of\r\nHaffkine’s prophylactic.\r\n\r\n  Besides this killed culture other material has been used. Lustig\r\n  and Galleotti used the nucleo-proteid from plague bacilli for\r\n  subcutaneous injection. Kolle and Strong have recommended a vaccine\r\n  of living but nonvirulent plague bacilli. A higher degree of\r\n  immunity seems to be conferred by this living vaccine but there are\r\n  certain dangers in the use of living organisms which outweigh the\r\n  advantage noted above.\r\n\r\n  Yersin’s antiplague serum, which is prepared by injecting horses at\r\n  first with killed cultures and later with living plague bacilli,\r\n  may be used as a prophylactic as well as in treatment. One point\r\n  to consider is that such serum, if used immediately after taking\r\n  from the horse, might contain living plague bacilli. The phenol\r\n  preservative prevents this. It must be remembered that this is a\r\n  passive immunization as against the active one with Haffkine’s\r\n  prophylactic, hence the protection is very short, only ten days\r\n  or two weeks as against the more enduring immunity of a year or\r\n  so following Haffkine’s prophylactic. It must be remembered that\r\n  anaphylactic manifestations may follow the repeating of the dose\r\n  of Yersin’s serum. It is probably advisable for one who is to be\r\n  exposed to plague for a short time only to receive an injection of\r\n  the serum. As regards pneumonic plague there seemed to be little\r\n  protection attaching to either active or passive immunization.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—It may be stated that the only treatment which has any\r\ncurative value is that with antiplague serum. This would appear\r\nto be of considerable value in bubonic plague provided it is\r\nadministered in the first day or two of the disease. It must be given\r\nin large amounts, from 50 to 100 cc. or even to the extent of 250\r\ncc. Then too such enormous doses apparently require to be repeated.\r\nIntravenous administration gives a better chance for success in\r\ndesperate cases. In septicaemic and pneumonic plague the use of serum\r\nhas been without result.\r\n\r\n  Salvarsan, as might be expected, has been tried but did not prove\r\n  of any value.\r\n\r\n  Connor has reported success with the intravenous injection of one\r\n  dram of a dilution of 1 part of tincture of iodine in 10 parts of\r\n  sterile water. He gave 6 such injections to a severe case with good\r\n  result.\r\n\r\n  In the way of symptomatic treatment one should use ice-bags to head\r\n  and cold sponging to the body.\r\n\r\n  Morphine seems to be the best drug to calm the patient. Cardiac\r\n  stimulants, especially strychnine, are indicated for the heart\r\n  weakness so much a feature of plague. Some consider incision or\r\n  enucleation of the bubo of value in treatment but it has always\r\n  seemed to me that the going into the periglandular exudate might\r\n  serve to set up a septicaemic condition when otherwise it might not\r\n  supervene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTULARAEMIA\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—This is a plague-like disease of various rodents,\r\ntransmissible to man, caused by an organism _Bacterium tularense_,\r\nwhich is not closely allied to any other species. A number of human\r\ncases have been reported from Utah, where the disease is prevalent\r\namong the jack rabbits, and the transmission to man is through the\r\nbite of a horsefly, _Chrysops discalis_, which has previously sucked\r\nthe blood of infected jack rabbits.\r\n\r\n  The site of the bite in man is usually marked by a punched-out\r\n  ulcer, which is associated with swelling and suppuration of the\r\n  glands draining the area. The general symptoms are sudden onset,\r\n  with rigors, followed by an irregular fever of three or four weeks’\r\n  duration and by a prolonged convalescence. Several cases have been\r\n  reported in the middle west due to handling infected rabbits. There\r\n  have been a number of infections in laboratory workers where the\r\n  local signs have been absent. In man death rarely results from the\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Deer-fly fever (in man). Plague-like disease (in\r\nrodents).\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—In 1911 McCoy and Chapin discovered the _B. tularense_\r\n  in a plague-like disease, first described by McCoy in the\r\n  California ground squirrel. They described the organism, succeeded\r\n  in cultivating it on special media, transmitted the infection to\r\n  various rodents by feeding, nasal inoculation and injection of\r\n  infected blood, and demonstrated the probable natural mode of\r\n  transmission by the squirrel flea.\r\n\r\n  In recent publications, Francis, Lake and Mayne, and Wayson have\r\n  recorded the transmission of the disease experimentally by the\r\n  house fly (_Musca domestica_), the horsefly (_Chrysops discalis_),\r\n  the stable fly (_Stomoxys calcitrans_), the rabbit louse, the mouse\r\n  louse and the bedbug, and have shown that the freshly recovered\r\n  organism can be grown on other than the special media previously\r\n  recommended.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The first case of infection occurring\r\n  in man was reported from Ohio by Wherry and Lamb in 1914. Since\r\n  then a number of cases have been reported by Francis among rural\r\n  residents of Utah and by Francis and Lake among laboratory workers\r\n  handling animals infected with _B. tularense_.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—_Bacterium tularense_ is a small nonmotile Gram-negative\r\ncocco-bacillus, from 0.3 to 0.7µ long and gives the appearance in\r\nstained preparations of being surrounded by capsular material. It is\r\nvery difficult to cultivate and until recently it has been grown only\r\non coagulated egg yolk as used by McCoy and Chapin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—_Chrysops discalis._ The transmitting agent\r\nof tularaemia.]\r\n\r\n  Recently Francis has shown that the organism will grow scantily on\r\n  serum or blood agar. However, by adding a piece of fresh sterile\r\n  spleen to such media he has obtained a more satisfactory culture\r\n  medium, although for routine work the egg yolk medium is preferred.\r\n  The organism refuses to grow on ordinary media such as nutrient\r\n  broth or agar. Material from a culture, or pus from bubo, or an\r\n  emulsion of the spleen of an infected guinea pig, when rubbed into\r\n  the abraded skin of an experimental animal brings about infection,\r\n  in this respect showing a similarity to plague infection. Upon\r\n  autopsy of such an experimentally infected guinea pig we find\r\n  haemorrhagic oedema at the site of inoculation with caseation of\r\n  lymph glands and small necrotic foci in spleen and liver. Smears\r\n  from the spleen show the organism in varying numbers. In infected\r\n  rodents the organism is often found abundantly in the blood and in\r\n  man a bacteriaemia may occur.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—The infection of ground squirrels with this\r\norganism was noted by McCoy in his plague work in California.\r\nFrancis in studying the disease in man in Utah found infection of\r\nthe jack rabbits and ground squirrels of the region and showed that\r\nthe transmission of the disease could be carried out by a biting\r\nfly (_Chrysops discalis_) and reported this fly as the common\r\ntransmitting agent of the human infection. He regarded the sick and\r\ndying jack rabbits as the reservoir of virus. Tularaemia is chiefly a\r\ndisease of the rural population attacking those at work in the fields.\r\n\r\n  As a result of accidental laboratory infections it would seem that\r\n  almost 100% of those carrying on extensive animal experimentation\r\n  with this organism become infected.\r\n\r\n  The louse infesting jack rabbits _Haemodipsus ventricosus_, can\r\n  transmit the infection from rabbit to rabbit so that the infection\r\n  in the jack rabbits is probably kept up by this agency. Recent\r\n  experiments have shown that the infection in white mice can be\r\n  transferred by the bites of the mouse louse and also by bedbugs.\r\n  Again if the mice are fed on infected bedbugs transmission is found\r\n  to take place by such feeding experiments. The faeces of such\r\n  bedbugs prove infectious. Guinea pigs injected subcutaneously with\r\n  the urine of white mice suffering from the disease die acutely with\r\n  typical lesions of tularaemia.\r\n\r\n  Mice fed on the liver of a rabbit dying of the disease succumbed to\r\n  the infection within five days.\r\n\r\nAs noted under etiology the most important method of spread of the\r\ndisease to man is by the bite of an infected horsefly (_Chrysops\r\ndiscalis_). From experimental studies it would seem that any biting\r\narthropod might prove a transmitting agent. In view of the fact that\r\nthe infected deer fly tends to lose its infectivity after about five\r\ndays Francis is of the opinion that the fly is only a mechanical\r\ntransmitter of the organism.\r\n\r\n  Wherry reported the infection as manifested by conjunctivitis with\r\n  glandular involvement and due to handling infected wild rabbits.\r\n\r\n  Lake and Francis have reported that of six investigators from\r\n  the Hygienic Laboratory working with this infection all have\r\n  contracted the disease. There were fortunately no fatalities. Such\r\n  an experience demonstrates the great infectivity of this virus and\r\n  must lead to the conclusion that the few cases so far reported of\r\n  the disease do not represent the importance of tularaemia in man.\r\n  With a knowledge of the existence of such an infection and with\r\n  satisfactory methods of laboratory diagnosis we shall probably\r\n  have other reports of the infection. We now know that the ground\r\n  squirrels of California and Utah, the jack rabbits of Utah and the\r\n  wild rabbits of the middle west furnish important reservoirs of\r\n  virus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn experimental animals we have lesions which cannot well be\r\ndifferentiated from those of plague. There is not sufficient data for\r\na statement as to the pathology in man.\r\n\r\n  In experimental animals we have a definite bacteriaemia but in man\r\n  the organism has only in rare instances been obtained from the\r\n  blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nIt has been difficult to determine the period of incubation but in\r\none laboratory infection the disease set in seven days after the\r\npatient began tularaemia work. There do not seem to be any prodromata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—Temperature chart of a case of laboratory\r\ninfection (tularaemia.)]\r\n\r\nIn Utah most of the cases showed local lesions at the site of the\r\nfly-bite and subsequent swelling and suppuration of adjoining lymph\r\nglands. The local lesions were generally observed about the head or\r\non parts of the body not covered by the clothing. There is a rather\r\nsudden onset with chilliness or rigors, generally associated with\r\ndizziness, prostration and malaise. Headache is usually present\r\nand there may be complaints of pains in the back and limbs. The\r\ntemperature rises rapidly and when first taken during the rigors may\r\nreach 103° or 104°F. An irregular fever course follows for two or\r\nthree weeks. There is practically no apathy, thus differentiating\r\nthe mental state of typhoid fever or the marked clouding of the\r\nconsciousness of plague. At times we may have rhinitis and epistaxis.\r\n\r\n  Physical examination is almost invariably negative. The spleen is\r\n  not palpable. The pulse is rather rapid and the blood pressure\r\n  uninfluenced.\r\n\r\n  The white and differential counts vary but little from normal.\r\n\r\n  The main feature of the disease, aside from local lesions when\r\n  these are present, is prostration and this continues marked during\r\n  the several weeks or months of convalescence.\r\n\r\nIt is a disabling illness rather than a dangerous one though a fatal\r\ncase is recorded.\r\n\r\n  In the six laboratory infections above referred to, there were no\r\n  local lesions except in the case of one man who had had previously\r\n  an attack of the disease. In the second attack, two years after the\r\n  first one, there was noted a papule on one finger with subsequent\r\n  involvement of the epitrochlear and axillary glands. A guinea pig\r\n  inoculated with blood taken from the papule became infected and\r\n  showed the typical lesions of tularaemia.\r\n\r\n  There was no fever or malaise in this second attack, thus showing\r\n  a degree of immunity. In cases showing conjunctival ulcerations\r\n  with glandular involvement Wherry and Lamb obtained cultures of _B.\r\n  tularense_ from inoculated animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThere is very little in the clinical picture, other than the local\r\nlesions, to indicate a diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  Material from ulcers or glands should be inoculated into guinea\r\n  pigs or white mice. The organism is almost invariably absent\r\n  from the blood of human cases so that blood cultures or animal\r\n  inoculation from such blood are almost always negative.\r\n\r\n  Complement fixation and agglutination tests are the methods of\r\n  diagnosis to be relied on. In the Hygienic Laboratory an antigen\r\n  is prepared by washing off the 72 hour growth from egg yolk\r\n  medium with small amounts of saline. The suspension is heated for\r\n  30 minutes at 56°C. and then preserved by the addition of O.3%\r\n  tricresol. Such an antigen is used for each type of test.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThis disease is but rarely followed by death. It is however a most\r\nincapacitating disease by reason of the three or four months of\r\nconvalescence during which time the strength and energy of the\r\npatient are markedly affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—In view of the very great liability to infection\r\nof those carrying on autopsies of animals experimentally infected\r\nwith the disease it would seem advisable to wear rubber gloves when\r\ndoing such work. It would appear that house flies, stable flies\r\nand horseflies may transmit the disease in nature and we know that\r\nbedbugs and lice can transmit the disease among experimental animals.\r\nWhen we consider the natural infection of ground squirrels and jack\r\nrabbits in California and Utah and wild rabbits in the middle west,\r\nthe problem of prophylaxis looms to great proportion.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—At present treatment is entirely symptomatic. Those who\r\ngo to bed at once and remain in bed during the stage of fever seem to\r\nbe less seriously affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCHOLERA\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Cholera is a disease caused by a spirillar type of\r\nbacterium, _Spirillum cholerae asiaticae_. The organism multiplies in\r\nthe small intestines and, undergoing lysis, liberates an endotoxin,\r\nwhich is responsible for the desquamation of the epithelium of the\r\nmucosa and other manifestations of the disease. Cholera appears to\r\nbe endemic in the delta of the Ganges and the various world-wide\r\nepidemics can generally be traced to that source. The rice-water\r\nstool of cholera teems with the spirilla, and infections of water or\r\nfood supplies can be traced to such a contamination. The importance\r\nof the cholera carrier has been thoroughly demonstrated from the time\r\nof the Hamburg epidemic of 1892. The clinical course of the disease\r\nis divided into a stage of evacuation, in which we have diarrhoeal\r\ndischarges of rice-water character along with very painful cramps of\r\nthe muscles. Following increasing cyanosis we have almost a cessation\r\nof circulation often associated with anuria, the algid stage. With\r\nthe return of activity of circulation and urinary secretion we have\r\nthe stage of reaction.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Cholera Asiatica.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—Although the word χολέρα, meaning flow of bile, is found\r\nin the writings of Hippocrates, it certainly does not refer to the\r\ndisease we now recognize as cholera. The older writers noted the\r\ncharacteristics of bilious discharges in the disease they termed\r\ncholera, which could not apply to the bile-free rice-water discharges\r\nof what we now term cholera. Koch rather doubted the antiquity of\r\ncholera but Susruta, in India, in the 7th century A. D., described a\r\ndisease in which there were diarrhoea and vomiting, stabbing pains,\r\ncyanosed lips and nails, with sinking in of the eyes and weak voice.\r\n\r\n  Detailed accounts of the presence of cholera in India were\r\n  published from the 16th to 18th centuries when the Portuguese,\r\n  English and French were carrying on their wars of conquest in\r\n  India. These wars naturally spread the disease all over India.\r\n\r\n  It is thought that true cholera did not exist in China until 1669\r\n  when it was carried there from India. It is first described from\r\n  Japan in 1821 although an epidemic which devastated Tokyo in 1718\r\n  may have been cholera.\r\n\r\n  A great pandemic of cholera started in India, in 1817, extending\r\n  over Asia but not invading Europe. The second great pandemic is of\r\n  importance as being the first to invade Europe. It started in India\r\n  in 1826 and advancing slowly reached Persia in 1829, going thence\r\n  by way of Astrakhan to Russia, Sweden, Northern Europe and England.\r\n  By 1832 it had spread over the whole of Europe.\r\n\r\n  In the same year, 1832, it reached Canada and thence spread to Fort\r\n  Dearborn where it infected the soldiers who subsequently carried\r\n  the disease down the Mississippi valley. It was also introduced\r\n  into New York and spread thence South and West so that by 1836\r\n  cholera was present all over the U. S., not disappearing until\r\n  1838. It disappeared from Europe in 1839.\r\n\r\n  The next European outbreak or third pandemic lasted from 1846 to\r\n  1862 and was traced to India by way of land and sea, that by land\r\n  following the caravan route by way of Persia and Russia and that\r\n  by sea from Indian pilgrims going to Mecca and there causing the\r\n  infection of Mahommedan pilgrims from Egypt and European Turkey.\r\n  This pandemic reached the U. S. in 1848, starting at New Orleans\r\n  and going up the Mississippi valley. Central and South America and\r\n  the West Indies were also invaded by the third pandemic.\r\n\r\n  The fourth great pandemic invaded Europe by the usual routes and\r\n  continued from 1863 to 1875. During its continuance there were two\r\n  outbreaks in the U. S., one in 1867 and another in 1873.\r\n\r\nThat in 1873, when it was introduced into three widely separated\r\nparts of the country, was the last appearance of cholera in the U. S.\r\n\r\n  The fifth pandemic began in 1883 and affected particularly the\r\n  Mediterranean seaports of France, Spain and Italy. It was during\r\n  this epidemic, in 1883, that Koch, working in Egypt, discovered the\r\n  cause of cholera, the _Spirillum cholerae asiaticae_.\r\n\r\n  A very serious outbreak of cholera, which originated in 1891, in\r\n  pilgrims from the delta of the Ganges, reached Europe in 1892,\r\n  almost a million deaths occurring in Russia. It was during this\r\n  epidemic that cholera appeared in Hamburg and gave opportunity for\r\n  those careful studies as to transmission of the disease to be later\r\n  referred to.\r\n\r\n  It is usual to recognize a sixth pandemic which began in 1902\r\n  and spread over India, China and the Philippines. This pandemic\r\n  continuing was a cause of great mortality among the soldiers\r\n  of the recent Balkan war. During the World War there was much\r\n  cholera among the Austrian forces in Galicia. It also prevailed in\r\n  Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Practically every pandemic when\r\n  studied can be traced back to India and particularly to the delta\r\n  of the Ganges, which may be considered the enduring focus of the\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The cholera vibrio, _Spirillum cholerae asiaticae_, was\r\ndiscovered by Koch in 1883 and is a short curved organism which,\r\nfrom its shape, is often called the comma bacillus. In addition to\r\nsingle spirilla there may be “S” shapes from attachment of pairs.\r\nIn cultures in peptone solutions long filamentous forms may be\r\nseen which however are exceedingly rare in the rice-water stools.\r\nA stained smear from a fleck of mucus gives the fish-in-the-stream\r\nappearance. Besides comma-shaped organisms we may have coccoid or\r\nrod-shaped forms. In old cultures marked pleomorphism is often seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—Cholera vibrios, short forms. (MacNeal from\r\nKolle and Schurmann after Zettrow.)]\r\n\r\n  It is Gram-negative and stains best with a dilute (1-10) carbol\r\n  fuchsin. There is a single terminal flagellum, which endows\r\n  the organism with great motility, which may best be termed\r\n  scintillating. It has been estimated that its motility is five\r\n  times greater than that of the typhoid bacillus. It grows best on\r\n  media with an alkaline reaction (—0.4%) and it is this tolerance\r\n  for media of high alkalinity that permits the separation of the\r\n  cholera spirillum from the ordinary faecal bacteria by the use of\r\n  Dieudonne’s alkaline blood agar or similar media. This is equal\r\n  parts of defibrinated ox blood and N/1 NaOH, 3 parts of which\r\n  are added to 7 parts of nutrient agar. It thus has 15% of normal\r\n  sodium hydrate, instead of the 1% acid reaction of the usual media.\r\n  Unfortunately, other spirilla tolerate this high alkalinity.\r\n\r\n  The cholera organism is strongly aerobic and grows quickly and\r\n  luxuriantly in the upper part of a tube of Dunham’s peptone\r\n  solution, this property enabling one to separate it from other\r\n  organisms of faeces by taking up loopfuls from the surface layer\r\n  to plate out on agar of about 0 or -0.3% reaction. When grown in\r\n  peptone solution the cholera spirillum produces a nitroso body so\r\n  that one obtains an indol reaction (cholera red) by simply adding 5\r\n  or 6 drops of concentrated H_{2}SO_{4}.\r\n\r\n  When this test is employed it is necessary to determine whether the\r\n  peptone used is suitable for the reaction. As a matter of fact this\r\n  test is now rather discredited. Blood serum is digested. Recently\r\n  much discussion has arisen as to the value of the haemolytic power\r\n  possessed by noncholera vibrios on blood agar plates.\r\n\r\n  It is true that the digestive action which true cholera has on\r\n  the red cells of the medium may give the appearance of a zone of\r\n  haemolysis. Therefore, for the demonstration of this haemolytic\r\n  action of noncholera spirilla, fluid blood media should be used.\r\n  The El Tor spirillum, isolated from Egyptian pilgrims without\r\n  symptoms of cholera, is haemolytic, but gives the immunity\r\n  reactions of the true cholera vibrios which are not haemolytic.\r\n\r\n  Gelatine is liquefied and the stab shows an air bubble liquefaction\r\n  at the summit of the stab. On gelatine plates a powdered glass\r\n  center with an encircling zone of liquefaction was formerly\r\n  considered characteristic of cholera, but at the present time\r\n  gelatine cultures have been almost abandoned in practical work.\r\n\r\n  As a rule animals cannot be infected by feeding them cholera\r\n  material unless the acidity of the gastric juice be neutralized\r\n  and intestinal peristalsis checked by opium (procedure of Koch).\r\n  Injected intraperitoneally, the cholera vibrio produces a fatal\r\n  peritonitis. Recently monkeys have been infected after purgation\r\n  with sulphate of soda and administration of bicarbonate of soda.\r\n  They died in from one to forty-eight hours with symptoms of cholera.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances where cholera has been caused in laboratory\r\nworkers by the accidental ingestion of cholera cultures, thus Orgel\r\nwas infected from sucking up peritoneal fluid in doing Pfeiffer tests\r\nfor bacteriolysis and died.\r\n\r\n  Emmerich and Pettenkofer swallowed cholera cultures, the former\r\n  experiencing a severe attack of cholera and the latter a diarrhoea\r\n  in which cholera spirilla were present. On the other hand similar\r\n  experiments have resulted negatively but this is what should be\r\n  expected from the epidemiological facts as to carriers.\r\n\r\n  The virulence of the cholera vibrio can be exalted by passage\r\n  through guinea pigs—successive culturing of the peritoneal exudate\r\n  of intraperitoneally infected animals alternating with culture\r\n  media growth inoculations. Such a fixed virus, the virulence of\r\n  which cannot be exalted, is the material used by Haffkine in\r\n  his cholera vaccine. The toxicity of cholera is supposed to be\r\n  due to an endotoxin which is set free when the vibrios undergo\r\n  disintegration when lying between the basement membrane and\r\n  epithelial lining of Lieberkühn’s glands. Others think the vibrios\r\n  may enter the blood stream, there to be immediately disintegrated\r\n  with toxin production. The usual idea, however, is that the cholera\r\n  spirilla never invade the blood stream—they are confined to the\r\n  alimentary canal. Macfadyen obtained the endotoxin by grinding the\r\n  frozen spirilla. This toxin was destroyed by a temperature of 60°C.\r\n\r\nThe spirillum of cholera has but little resistance to disinfecting\r\nagents or to drying. It is also rapidly overgrown by putrefactive\r\nbacteria and tends to disappear from sewage-contaminated water in a\r\nshort time. In stools the vibrio dies in about one or two days in\r\nsummer and in about a week in winter.\r\n\r\n  The inoculation of animals by cholera cultures tends to produce an\r\n  immune serum which is remarkable for its high agglutinating power,\r\n  the titre at times going as high as 1 to 20,000. For agglutination\r\n  tests in proving spirilla isolated from stools to be true cholera\r\n  ones we use a serum of at least 1 to 4000 for its specific vibrio.\r\n  Such a serum should agglutinate any true cholera spirillum in a\r\n  1 to 500 or 1 to 1000 dilution. The occurrence of bacteriolysis,\r\n  when a small loopful of the culture emulsified in 1 cc. of 1 to\r\n  1000 dilution of the immune serum and then introduced into the\r\n  peritoneal cavity of a guinea pig, is the surest proof that a\r\n  suspected organism is that of cholera.\r\n\r\n  This is shown when, upon removing a drop of the peritoneal fluid\r\n  fifteen to twenty minutes afterward, there is noted an absence\r\n  of motility and disintegration of the spirilla (_Pfeiffer’s\r\n  phenomenon_).\r\n\r\n  Complement fixation tests, using the rice-water stools or peptone\r\n  solution cultures as antigen, are of less value than those above\r\n  noted. Agglutination is the practical test and is almost as\r\n  specific as that for bacteriolysis.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—Until recently our attention as to the methods\r\nof transmission of cholera was directed almost exclusively to the\r\nwater and food supply, with a certain degree of consideration of\r\ndanger from fomites, especially to that connected with clothing\r\nsoiled by cholera discharges, it having been noted that those who\r\nwash such clothing showed a high incidence of infection. Later on\r\nthe importance of flies in the spread of the disease was strongly\r\ninsisted upon. At the present time we consider the cholera carrier\r\nthe most important factor in cholera epidemiology and it is to the\r\ndetection and isolation of such persons that we now chiefly direct\r\nour attention in the keeping out of a country of this dread disease.\r\n\r\n  It will be remembered that Pettenkofer and Emmerich insisted upon\r\n  the factors of soil and ground water in the spread of cholera.\r\n  Emmerich now admits that the spirilla excreted by carriers can\r\n  produce cholera but that such transference never gives origin\r\n  to epidemics. For this to take place he thinks that the vibrios\r\n  excreted by a carrier must come in contact with a soil which has\r\n  been impregnated with a suitable medium drawn to the surface from\r\n  the deeper layers of the soil by capillary suction. In such medium\r\n  the vibrios flourish and acquire the property of actively producing\r\n  nitrites from nitrates.\r\n\r\n  Emmerich considers that the symptoms of cholera are those of\r\n  nitrite poisoning so that only such organisms as possess this\r\n  nitrite-forming function in high degree can produce virulent\r\n  outbreaks of cholera.\r\n\r\n  All facts in connection with the spread of cholera by land or water\r\n  routes can be best explained by the cholera carrier; the individual\r\n  who is excreting vibrios, while in apparent health, being far more\r\n  dangerous than the one excreting such organisms in the rice-water\r\n  stools of a well-recognized case of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Water Transmission._—There are two types of outbreaks of cholera\r\naccording as the general water supply is contaminated or when such\r\ncontamination is localized to certain wells, cisterns or other\r\nnongeneral supplies. In the former the onset is explosive and cases\r\noccur almost simultaneously and with equal distribution in all parts\r\nof the city, to disappear with almost equal suddenness.\r\n\r\n  In the latter mode of infection, cases will appear from day to day\r\n  and often peculiarly localized to certain definite districts of a\r\n  city or to certain definite users of a particular water supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—An instructive contrast between Altona and\r\nHamburg before the latter filtered its water, having learnt its\r\nlesson from a sharp outbreak of cholera. (After G. E. Armstrong.)]\r\n\r\nAs an example of the first type of outbreak the Hamburg epidemic of\r\n1892 is most instructive.\r\n\r\n  During a period of only about two months cholera attacked about\r\n  17,000 persons causing 8605 deaths in a city with a population of\r\n  600,000. This outbreak was attributed to the washing of clothes in\r\n  the water of the Elbe River by Russian immigrants. These immigrants\r\n  had come from cholera-infected districts and among them there\r\n  undoubtedly were cholera carriers.\r\n\r\n  The water supply of Hamburg was taken directly from the river.\r\n  The adjoining city of Altona, with a population of 140,000, is\r\n  further down the river but filtered its water by a slow sand\r\n  process. Although the water as taken from the river contained\r\n  the sewage of Hamburg yet there were only 328 deaths or 2.1 per\r\n  thousand as against 13.4 per thousand for Hamburg. There were many\r\n  interesting points in connection with the exemption of certain\r\n  places in Hamburg, of which may be noted the instance of the entire\r\n  freedom from cholera of a group of houses (Hamburg Hof), with 345\r\n  occupants. This was the only section of Hamburg which was supplied\r\n  with Altona water. As Hamburg and Altona are only separated by the\r\n  width of a street and hence practically form a single city, the\r\n  factor of food and contact transmission could easily explain the\r\n  cases in Altona.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the second type of water transmission we have the\r\nwell-known incident of the Broad Street pump.\r\n\r\n  This was about the first definitely proven connection between water\r\n  and cholera. In 1854 it was noted that cholera was about 10 times\r\n  as prevalent in Golden Square as in other adjacent parts of London.\r\n  Various factors, such as previous droughts, stagnation of lower\r\n  strata of the atmosphere, sewerage defects and subsoil drainage\r\n  were found to be the same in Golden Square as elsewhere. It was\r\n  noted that the number of cases increased in the neighborhood of\r\n  the Broad Street well. The employees of a cartridge factory where\r\n  this well water was used gave a large number of cases while an\r\n  adjoining brewery, which had a well of its own and served out beer\r\n  to its employees, did not furnish a single case. Very striking was\r\n  the case of a lady living at Hampstead, a section of London which\r\n  was then free from cholera, who had acquired a liking for the\r\n  water of this well and had brought out to her regularly bottles of\r\n  water from the well. This lady drank some of the water on August\r\n  31 and was seized with cholera the next day. A niece drank of the\r\n  same water and died of cholera as well as the aunt. A servant also\r\n  contracted the disease but recovered.\r\n\r\nMacnamara has noted the circumstance of a vessel of water, which\r\nbecame contaminated with cholera stools, but which at the time it\r\nwas drunk by 19 persons did not show anything suspicious in odor,\r\ncolor or taste. One person was stricken one day afterward, two on the\r\nthird day and two others came down with cholera on the fourth day. It\r\nwill be noted that only 5 of the 19 were attacked. A similar lack of\r\nsusceptibility of a certain proportion of people, equally exposed,\r\nhas been noted in all cholera outbreaks. It is probable that of those\r\nof the 19 who did not contract cholera there were developed a certain\r\nnumber of cholera carriers.\r\n\r\n_Food Transmission._—Food contaminated by dejecta from cholera\r\npatients or carriers is dangerous in proportion to its condition of\r\nmoisture. Drying and the development of inimical organisms are the\r\ntwo chief factors in destroying the cholera vibrio. Temperature and\r\nsunshine are operative in assisting the drying process.\r\n\r\n  Lettuce and celery are particularly dangerous because of the\r\n  favorable condition of moisture in their folds and imbrications.\r\n  Furthermore these vegetables are eaten uncooked and may have been\r\n  fertilized with night soil (human excrement) which material, if\r\n  containing cholera dejecta, would infect the plants. Milk is a\r\n  splendid culture medium for cholera vibrios but, upon becoming\r\n  acid, sterilizes itself of these vibrios. In sterilized milk,\r\n  however, they live for extended periods, as long as sixty days\r\n  and, even when such milk is contaminated by faecal material\r\n  containing other organisms besides the cholera vibrio, the vibrios\r\n  live much longer than they do in raw milk.\r\n\r\n  Milk is liable to be contaminated by flies which have been in\r\n  contact with cholera stools. Water that has been boiled and food\r\n  that has been cooked should subsequently be scrupulously protected\r\n  from flies or other contaminating agents. Uncooked shell fish are\r\n  peculiarly dangerous in cholera outbreaks.\r\n\r\n  In India, sun-dried fish, which are frequently covered with flies\r\n  during the curing process, are a factor in the spread of cholera.\r\n\r\n_Transmission by Carriers._—This is now universally recognized as\r\nthe most important factor in the spread of cholera. Dunbar was the\r\nfirst to draw attention to the presence of virulent cholera spirilla\r\nin the faeces of apparently healthy persons during the Hamburg\r\nepidemic of 1892.\r\n\r\n  Since that time these observations have been generally confirmed.\r\n  In some instances as many as 20% of those who have been in\r\n  immediate contact with a cholera patient have become carriers,\r\n  some showing symptoms of cholera but a larger proportion excreting\r\n  cholera spirilla while continuing in health.\r\n\r\n  While cholera prevailed in Manila, McLaughlin found from 6 to 7% of\r\n  carriers among healthy persons living in the infected districts.\r\n\r\n  Pottevin has recently reported that of 13,000 pilgrims examined 1.7\r\n  per thousand carried cholera vibrios. The carriers were especially\r\n  common among the dysenteric patients. During the Naples epidemic\r\n  of 1911 it was found that on the average 10% of healthy people in\r\n  contact with cholera cases became carriers. It was estimated that\r\n  90% of the cases in this epidemic were infected by sick or healthy\r\n  carriers.\r\n\r\n  Sergeant has recently reported the case of a healthy carrier who\r\n  continued to excrete cholera vibrios for two months and during this\r\n  time was in contact with 8 persons, 7 of whom became infected and 4\r\n  died. In Manila it was found that many of the children reported as\r\n  dying of meningitis or infantile beriberi were cholera cases.\r\n\r\nThe vibrios are rarely excreted in the faeces of the cholera patients\r\nlonger than seven to ten days. Frequently they disappear in three or\r\nfour days.\r\n\r\n  With healthy cholera carriers the period of the continuance of\r\n  vibrio excretion is equally short but cases have been reported\r\n  where periods of from three weeks to two months have been noted. It\r\n  is usually stated that 97% of carriers become vibrio free within a\r\n  month.\r\n\r\n  Greig has found infection of the bile of the gall bladder or ducts\r\n  in 80 cases in 271 cholera autopsies. When living organisms are\r\n  injected into the ear vein of a rabbit they pass into the bile.\r\n  An examination of the epithelial layers of the gall-bladder of\r\n  such a rabbit shows destruction of the cells and the presence of\r\n  vibrios in the underlying tissues. While cholera spirilla are soon\r\n  crowded out by intestinal bacteria, thus explaining the short\r\n  period during which cholera spirilla are excreted by convalescents,\r\n  this is not true when the cholera vibrio gets into the bile ducts\r\n  or gall bladder. Greig found one cholera convalescent excreting\r\n  cholera vibrios forty-four days after the attack. Of 27 persons who\r\n  had been in contact with cholera patients 6 were excreting cholera\r\n  vibrios although apparently well.\r\n\r\n  A very important matter is that persons who fail to show\r\n  cholera vibrios may begin to excrete such organisms after the\r\n  administration of a purgative or following some intestinal\r\n  disorder. In fact purgatives may set up an attack of cholera in a\r\n  cholera carrier.\r\n\r\n  The spread of cholera is intimately connected with the great\r\n  religious festivals and pilgrimages of Oriental people. Not only\r\n  do those of India keep up the dissemination of the disease there\r\n  but pilgrims going from the delta of the Ganges to Mecca carry the\r\n  infection and transmit it to their fellow pilgrims from Egypt and\r\n  Algiers. Greig examined a number of cholera convalescents who were\r\n  about to return to their homes in India and found 30 per cent of\r\n  these pilgrims excreting cholera vibrios in their stools.\r\n\r\nIn India cholera accounts for about 1 to 1.5 deaths per 1000 of\r\npopulation. Malaria and plague are other great causes of death.\r\n\r\n  The intimate commercial relations between Europe and Egypt and\r\n  Algiers make the introduction of the disease into European ports an\r\n  easy matter. Of particular importance is the fact that so many sick\r\n  people make pilgrimages, these being peculiarly liable to act as\r\n  carriers.\r\n\r\n  Excesses in eating, often of badly prepared or decomposing food,\r\n  following periods of religious fasts, predispose the natives of\r\n  India to cholera.\r\n\r\nLowered resistance, as from disease or from gastric disorder,\r\nincreases the susceptibility to cholera. Errors in diet and in\r\nparticular the effects of alcoholic excesses markedly predispose to\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe cholera spirillum does not produce a soluble toxin, the toxic\r\nprinciple being intracellular. The organism rarely penetrates\r\nmore deeply than just under the epithelial layer of the glands of\r\nLieberkühn. As a result of the outpouring of the fluid into the lumen\r\nof the gut we have an increase in the red cells (7,000,000 per cu.\r\nmm.) and leucocytosis of from 12,000 to 50,000. The specific gravity\r\nof the blood is greatly raised, 1073 to 1078, and the alkalinity\r\ndiminished. The blood pressure is markedly lowered, 60 mm. in very\r\nsevere cases and 75 mm. in less severe ones.\r\n\r\n  The lower portion of the small intestines is the favorite location\r\n  for the action of the endotoxin of cholera. Early and marked\r\n  postmortem rigidity is a striking characteristic of the cholera\r\n  cadaver. Muscular contractions, causing odd positions of the\r\n  limbs, have at times given a basis for the idea that the victim had\r\n  been buried alive.\r\n\r\n  Besides marked rigor mortis the emaciation, leaden hue of skin and\r\n  shrivelled hands are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nIn opening up the body there is a striking dryness of all the\r\nstructures. The dry and dark-red muscles stand out prominently.\r\nThe lungs are dry and shrunken. The right heart is full of a dark,\r\njelly-like, viscid blood. The leading changes are found in the\r\nabdomen. The omentum is dry, sticky and shrivelled looking. The\r\nintestines have a ground glass appearance with a lilac-pink color of\r\nthe small intestines which is in contrast with the normal color of\r\nthe large intestines.\r\n\r\n  There is congestion of the affected intestinal mucosa and the lumen\r\n  is filled with the alkaline rice-water material. If the case is of\r\n  some days standing we have a rather brownish, foul-smelling bowel\r\n  content. There is usually a parenchymatous nephritis and on section\r\n  the medullary portion is much congested.\r\n\r\nCrowell gives the following points as indicating cholera upon\r\nautopsy: (1) Cyanotic finger nails, (2) dry tissues, (3) dry and\r\nsticky peritoneum with pink serosa of ileum, (4) contracted and empty\r\nurinary bladder, (5) shrunken dry spleen and liver, (6) rice-water\r\nintestinal contents and (7) prominence of lymphoid tissues in the\r\nileum.\r\n\r\n  In his studies of the pathology of cholera Greig drew attention to\r\n  the frequency of the involvement of the gall-bladder. He also noted\r\n  the presence of small areas of consolidation in the lungs of those\r\n  developing pneumonia during the early days of convalescence. In the\r\n  exudates of such areas cholera vibrios could be seen thus showing\r\n  their penetration of the lung. Although rare instances of recovery\r\n  of the cholera spirillum from the blood have been reported Greig\r\n  was unable to accomplish this in any instance. In his opinion the\r\n  spirilla travel by way of the lymphatic system. In eight cases out\r\n  of fifty-five cases he recovered the spirilla from the urine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case of Cholera.=—The so-called prodromal or premonitory\r\ndiarrhoea is not a feature of the onset of _cholera gravis_, the type\r\nof the disease which characterizes the cholera epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is usually from one to five days. Longer\r\nperiods are possibly explained by some exciting intestinal disorder\r\nin a cholera carrier. The course of the disease is conveniently\r\ndivided into a stage of evacuation, an algid one and a stage of\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n_The Stage of Evacuation._—A profuse and frequent diarrhoea comes on\r\nwithout colic or tenesmus. In fact the stools are voided with a sense\r\nof relief as when an enema is gotten rid of.\r\n\r\n  The striking feature, however, of these movements is the sensation\r\n  of prostration which accompanies them.\r\n\r\nThe faecal character of these diarrhoeal stools is soon lost and the\r\ntypical rice-water stool is now passed. This designation is very apt\r\nand the flocculi of intestinal epithelium, in a watery, slightly\r\nopaque fluid, suggests rice-water. The odor is slightly albuminous.\r\n\r\n  Early in this stage cramps of the muscles set in. The muscles of\r\n  the legs, especially the calf muscles and those of the feet, are\r\n  particularly liable to these very painful contractions which may\r\n  cause the patient to cry out for relief. The muscles of the abdomen\r\n  and back may also be involved as may at times the muscles of the\r\n  entire body.\r\n\r\nVomiting, at first of the contents of the stomach and later of\r\nrice-water material, is a distressing feature to the patient and by\r\nreason of the manner in which it often gushes from the patient’s\r\nmouth is liable to contaminate the attendants.\r\n\r\n  Along with the excessive loss of fluid the tissues, especially\r\n  of the face, become shrunken, the eyeballs with their congested\r\n  conjunctivae sink back in the orbits, and the nose becomes pinched.\r\n  The pulse becomes more and more feeble and there is a steady\r\n  diminution in the secretion of urine. An increasing duskiness\r\n  of the skin, which is cold and clammy to the touch, denotes the\r\n  setting in of the algid stage.\r\n\r\n_Algid Stage._—In this stage there is almost complete cessation of\r\ncirculation, even the incision of a vein is only followed by a drop\r\nof black tarry blood. Anuria is practically complete.\r\n\r\n  The vomiting, purging and cramps may or may not subside and in the\r\n  patient, with his great thirst, intense exhaustion and cadaveric\r\n  appearance, with mental faculties fairly well preserved, we have\r\n  an example of a living death. The temperature of the sodden,\r\n  inelastic, clammy skin is markedly depressed, even below 90°F.,\r\n  while the rectal temperature may approximate normal or be elevated.\r\n\r\n  Some authorities consider a marked difference between the\r\n  superficial and rectal temperatures as of bad prognosis.\r\n\r\n  The voice becomes husky and finally so feeble that the patient can\r\n  only whisper and the breath feels cold.\r\n\r\n  The sodden shrivelled hands, as those of a washerwoman, are very\r\n  characteristic. Thirst is intense.\r\n\r\n  The patient now falls into a listless, motionless state in which,\r\n  however, the apathy is more apparent than real. The algidity may\r\n  deepen and death ensue or the stage of reaction may set in. The\r\n  algid stage may last from a few hours to two or three days.\r\n\r\nCollapse and uraemia are the two most frequent causes of death.\r\n\r\n_Stage of Reaction._—The pulse returns, urine is again secreted and\r\nthe duskiness and coldness of the skin give way to normal conditions\r\nand a favorable convalescence sets in. At other times, however, the\r\nrise of surface temperature and restoration of the circulation are\r\nnot attended by urinary secretion.\r\n\r\nIn such cases a typhoid state ensues with accelerated respiration,\r\ndry, brown tongue and muttering delirium.\r\n\r\n  It is customary to divide the types of cholera cases into:\r\n\r\n  1. _Cholera gravis._ The type above described.\r\n\r\n  2. _Cholerine._ In this there is a more or less marked stage of\r\n  evacuation with possibly the appearance of rice-water stools. The\r\n  urine, however, does not become suppressed and the algid stage is\r\n  not entered upon.\r\n\r\n  3. _Cholera sicca._ This type of the disease is more apt to be seen\r\n  in old or debilitated people. The patient dies of collapse without\r\n  showing symptoms of vomiting or diarrhoea. At the autopsy one may\r\n  find the bowels distended with rice-water contents.\r\n\r\n  The so-called _cholera ambulans_ is simply another designation for\r\n  the more or less ill cholera carrier.\r\n\r\n=Sequelae.=—Following an attack of cholera we may have abscess of\r\nthe parotid gland or gangrene of various parts of the body. There may\r\nbe ulceration of the cornea. In pregnant women the disease almost\r\ninvariably causes abortion. Post-choleraic pneumonias and renal\r\ninflammations are to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _General Appearance._—A typical case of cholera, with its\r\n  cyanosed, drawn, pinched face, cold, clammy skin and the eyes\r\n  deeply sunken in the orbits, makes a picture rarely seen in other\r\n  conditions. The washerwoman’s hands appearance should always be\r\n  looked for.\r\n\r\n  _Temperature Record._—The temperature of the skin surface is\r\n  lowered from the normal while that of the rectum may be normal or\r\n  even elevated. There may be a difference of 10° or more between\r\n  rectal and surface temperature. In the stage of reaction the\r\n  temperature may continue to rise to high fever points and this\r\n  so-called hyperthermic type is very fatal.\r\n\r\n  _Circulatory System._—The pulse is rapid and feeble in the stage\r\n  of evacuation to become imperceptible in the algid stage. The\r\n  circulation is practically at a standstill so that only a few drops\r\n  of black tarry blood, which does not coagulate readily, flow from\r\n  a wound of a vein when giving an intravenous injection. The blood\r\n  is concentrated and has a specific gravity of 1072 to 1078. The\r\n  systolic pressure falls greatly, even to 60 mm. of mercury in a\r\n  severe, or 75 mm. in a less serious case. The red cell count is\r\n  increased to 7 or 8 million red cells per c.mm. and the leucocyte\r\n  count reaches 15,000 to 50,000.\r\n\r\n  _Nervous System._—The mind is clear, even when the patient seems\r\n  profoundly apathetic. The muscle cramps are characteristic of the\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—It is customary to state that cholera\r\nnostras and infections with virulent meat poisoning bacteria of the\r\nparatyphoid group show bile in the intestinal discharges and not the\r\ntypical rice-water stools of true cholera. It must be remembered\r\nthat these affections can at times show as marked muscular cramps,\r\nemaciation, cyanosis and weak voice as cholera so that only the\r\nbacteriological examination can differentiate.\r\n\r\n  Algid pernicious malaria generally shows a rather high axillary\r\n  temperature and the stools are rarely so profuse as in cholera.\r\n\r\n  In ptomaine or mushroom poisoning the vomiting usually precedes the\r\n  diarrhoea—the opposite of the order in cholera.\r\n\r\n  Acute intestinal obstructions may simulate but here we have faecal\r\n  vomiting and constipation.\r\n\r\n  With irritant poisons as arsenic or antimony there is the metallic\r\n  taste and the pains are chiefly colicky rather than muscular and\r\n  the stools rather dysenteric.\r\n\r\n  I have seen severe cases of bacillary dysentery which could not\r\n  be differentiated clinically from cholera, and it is interesting\r\n  to note that many cases of cholera occurring in the Balkan war\r\n  were diagnosed as bacillary dysentery. In children cerebral\r\n  manifestations are very common so that in the Philippines many such\r\n  cholera cases were diagnosed as meningitis.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—Agglutination is the practical aid in\r\ndiagnosis. The serum from cholera convalescents, or those vaccinated\r\nagainst cholera, show agglutinins. It has been stated that properly\r\nvaccinated cases show a titre of from 1 to 2 thousand in about\r\n70% of cases. Normal human serum does not agglutinate in a higher\r\ndilution than 1 to 20. Greig has found that fatal cholera cases\r\nrarely give higher than 1 to 40. In cases recovering he found\r\nwell-marked agglutinating power by the 6th day, titres of 1 to 500\r\nor 1 to 1000 being frequently obtained. Janoue and Watanabe found\r\nthe agglutinating power of the sera of convalescents to fall rapidly\r\nafter the third week. As a rule the titre varied from 1 to 100 to 1\r\nto 400. The highest titre noted was 1 to 10,000.\r\n\r\n  It is well to first make a microscopical examination of the stool\r\n  by taking one of the whitish epithelial flakes from the rice-water\r\n  material and making a straight smear which is then dried and fixed\r\n  with heat. This may be stained best by a dilute carbol fuchsin (1\r\n  to 10). Methylene blue makes a good stain, or more differential\r\n  is that by Gram’s method which shows the Gram-negative spirilla\r\n  stained by the bismarck brown counterstain, giving the appearance\r\n  of fish parallel to one another in a stream. According to Koch a\r\n  diagnosis can be made in this way of one-half the cases during an\r\n  epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe scintillating motility of cholera spirilla may strike one in the\r\nexamination of the stool in hanging drop.\r\n\r\n  Dunbar has a quick diagnostic method in which epithelial flakes\r\n  from the stool are emulsified in peptone solution. Then on a\r\n  slide, according to the method to be later described, is deposited\r\n  a drop of 1 to 50 normal serum dilution and on the same slide a\r\n  second drop of 1 to 500 dilution of cholera serum. A loopful of\r\n  the suspected stool emulsion is rubbed up in each of these serum\r\n  dilutions and we should have cessation of motility and clumping in\r\n  the cholera immune serum provided the organisms in the stool are\r\n  true cholera spirilla.\r\n\r\n  In case of an autopsy on a suspected case of cholera one should\r\n  tie off, between double ligatures, at least two 5-inch sections\r\n  of small intestines, one just above the ileo-caecal valve and one\r\n  taken from about the middle of the ileum. These portions of gut\r\n  should be dropped into sterile salt mouth bottles, well stoppered\r\n  and sent to a bacteriological laboratory as soon as possible. As\r\n  the cholera spirilla, when associated with faecal bacteria, tend\r\n  to die off within twelve to twenty-four hours it would probably be\r\n  advisable to inoculate an agar or blood serum slant with material\r\n  from the ileum at the same time the sections of gut are removed.\r\n  For diagnosis of a cholera carrier with a normal stool or a cholera\r\n  suspect with a diarrhoeal one inoculate 2 or 3 tubes of peptone\r\n  solution with 2 or 3 loopfuls of material from the stool. With\r\n  suspected carriers who are constipated and to whom one should not\r\n  give purgatives we may insert into the rectum a rubber tube or a\r\n  throat swab in order to obtain material immediately. The cholera\r\n  spirilla grow rapidly and being strong aerobes, they grow on the\r\n  surface of the fluid so that by taking a loopful from the surface,\r\n  we may in three to eight hours obtain a pure culture. Should there\r\n  be a pellicle present, this should be avoided in transfer by\r\n  tilting the tube slightly, so that the material near the surface\r\n  be obtained without touching the pellicle. Inoculate a second\r\n  tube from the surface of this first and, if necessary, a third\r\n  (_enrichment method_).\r\n\r\n  Smear the three-hour surface growth of a peptone culture on a\r\n  dry agar surface in a Petri dish. From colonies developing make\r\n  agglutination and, if desired, cultural tests. It is by immunity\r\n  reactions and not by cultural ones that we identify cholera\r\n  spirilla. The surface moisture of plates is best dried by the\r\n  filter-paper top.\r\n\r\nThe cholera colony is easily distinguished from the ordinary faecal\r\nbacterial colonies by its transparent, bluish gray, delicate\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n  A practical quick method is to make smears from suspicious\r\n  colonies, stain for one minute with dilute carbol fuchsin and if\r\n  vibrios are present to make 2 vaseline rings on a single slide\r\n  allowing ample space at one end for handling the preparation\r\n  safely. Inside of one ring deposit with a platinum loop a drop of\r\n  salt solution and inside the ring nearest the end which is to be\r\n  held by fingers or forceps deposit a loopful of 1 to 500 or 1 to\r\n  1000 dilution of cholera serum. The emulsion in the salt solution\r\n  remains uniformly turbid and under a low power of the microscope\r\n  (⅔-inch) shows a scintillating motility. The emulsion made into\r\n  the drop of serum quickly shows a curdy agglutination and upon\r\n  examination with the ⅔-inch objective shows clumping and absence of\r\n  motility. Cover-glasses placed over the two vaseline rings assist\r\n  in the study of the preparation.\r\n\r\n  The best-known selective medium for plating out cholera material is\r\n  that of Dieudonne which is referred to under etiology. Apparently\r\n  a more satisfactory medium is that proposed by Goldberger, this\r\n  medium being transparent.\r\n\r\n  First prepare a 100% meat infusion by treating 500 grams of finely\r\n  chopped lean beef with 500 cc. water and after three hours strain\r\n  the infusion, adjust reaction to neutral with 5.3% anhydrous sodium\r\n  carbonate, then add to each 100 cc. 2½ cc. of the 5.3% anhydrous\r\n  sodium carbonate, sterilize in Arnold for one-half hour and filter.\r\n  Next prepare a 3% meat extract agar and mix one volume of the\r\n  alkaline meat infusion with 3 volumes of the hot melted 3% meat\r\n  extract agar. Pour plates and cover with a piece of filter-paper\r\n  and place in incubator for one-half hour until they are quite dry.\r\n  The necessity for a surface without moisture applies to Dieudonne’s\r\n  and Krumwiede’s alkaline egg media as well as this one. On this\r\n  medium cholera grows well while faecal bacteria are restrained.\r\n\r\n  The cholera colony is clear, round and shows a brownish center but\r\n  is without that striking bluish opalescence shown on ordinary agar\r\n  plates.\r\n\r\n  While peptone solution is a more favorable enrichment medium and\r\n  answers perfectly when cholera organisms are fairly abundant yet,\r\n  when scarce, selective enrichment media may be desirable. Of these\r\n  the best known is Ottolenghi’s alkaline bile. Goldberger prefers an\r\n  alkaline egg peptone solution made as follows:\r\n\r\n  Shake up an egg with an equal quantity of water and add to this\r\n  egg solution an equal quantity of a 5% solution of anhydrous\r\n  sodium carbonate. Steam one hour. Then add 1 part of this alkaline\r\n  egg medium to 9 parts of peptone solution, filter and sterilize.\r\n  Recent reports on _Aronson’s cholera medium_ would indicate its\r\n  great value in stool examination for cholera. The organisms taken\r\n  from such plates emulsify easily and there is no interference with\r\n  their agglutinability. To prepare it add to 100 cc. of 3% nutrient\r\n  agar, 6 cc. of 10% solution of exsiccated sodium carbonate and\r\n  steam in Arnold sterilizer for fifteen minutes. Then add 5 cc. of\r\n  20% saccharose solution, 5 cc. of 20% dextrin solution, 0.4 cc.\r\n  saturated alcoholic basic fuchsin and 2 cc. of 10% sodium sulphite.\r\n  A precipitate forms which quickly settles and plates can be poured\r\n  from the supernatant fluid. Cholera colonies develop in twelve\r\n  hours and show as red colonies in fifteen to twenty hours.\r\n\r\nTest for _cholera red_ reaction. Add from three to five drops of\r\nconcentrated chemically pure sulphuric acid to the first or second\r\npeptone culture after eighteen to twenty-four hours growth. Some\r\nspecimens of peptone do not give the reaction. At times we only get\r\nthe cholera red when we have a pure culture of cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThere is the greatest variation in the mortality in different\r\nepidemics as is true of most other epidemic diseases. At any rate 50%\r\nmay be considered an average mortality.\r\n\r\nYoung children and old people give a very high mortality rate as is\r\nalso true of alcoholics and those with kidney disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—Of all the quarantinable diseases cholera is the one\r\nin which personal prophylaxis is apparently of greatest influence in\r\nprotection from infection.\r\n\r\n  In the presence of cholera one should not only drink recently\r\n  boiled water, which has been protected from the contaminating\r\n  influence of flies, but all forms of uncooked food should be\r\n  avoided. In the first rank of prohibited foods should be raw shell\r\n  fish and uncooked salads. Such articles as lettuce and celery are\r\n  particularly dangerous on account of the moisture retained. Fruits\r\n  such as bananas and oranges can be made safe by covering them with\r\n  boiling water for two or three minutes and subsequently peeling.\r\n  Care must be taken that native servants do not put fish, which may\r\n  have been contaminated with cholera-infected water, on the ice in\r\n  an ice box and through such a source to have the butter, etc.,\r\n  infected. The most scrupulous attention should be given the matter\r\n  of the care of the ice-box in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  If conditions are such that boiled water cannot be obtained the\r\n  water may be treated with good quality chlorinated soda. As a\r\n  stock solution we use 1 teaspoonful of chlorinated soda to 1 pint\r\n  of water and of this 1 teaspoonful to 2 gallons of the water\r\n  to be disinfected. Pottevin recommends six hours contact with\r\n  hypochlorite of soda, 1 mg. per liter.\r\n\r\n  Besides care of the food and water ingested particular attention\r\n  should be paid to the washing of the hands before eating and if in\r\n  contact with cholera cases careful disinfection of the hands.\r\n\r\nExperience in cholera epidemics has shown the importance of avoiding\r\nanything which might lower resistance. In particular are fatigue,\r\nexcesses in alcohol or the taking of any kind of indigestible foods\r\nto be avoided. It must be remembered that the use of purgatives may\r\nset up cholera in a cholera carrier so that this possibility should\r\nbe thought of.\r\n\r\n  Tea has been recommended as a prophylactic, as has also eucalyptus\r\n  oil, 10 minims twice daily.\r\n\r\n  As acids have an inimical effect on the cholera spirilla some have\r\n  recommended the use of acid drinks but as a matter of fact the best\r\n  prophylactic is the normal gastric juice and there is a possibility\r\n  that the use of such acid drinks might upset the digestion and thus\r\n  defeat the object desired.\r\n\r\nAs to municipal measures for the control of a cholera outbreak the\r\nmost important one is to diagnose cholera carriers, such cases often\r\noccurring in those associated with a cholera case. Such carriers\r\nshould be isolated and their stools disinfected until at least\r\n2 negative examinations show them to have ceased being cholera\r\ncarriers. Of course a cholera case should be isolated and kept in a\r\nfly-screened room.\r\n\r\n  For disinfection of stools one requires an equal amount of a 5%\r\n  compound cresol solution which when mixed with the same amount of\r\n  stool becomes a 2½% solution. This should be in contact with the\r\n  stool at least one hour before emptying the container. Chlorinated\r\n  lime, 1 pound to 4 gallons, makes a splendid disinfectant for\r\n  stools—equal parts of this 1 to 16 chlorinated lime solution and\r\n  stool.\r\n\r\n  Bed clothing or other material contaminated by vomitus or faeces\r\n  should be immersed in a 2½% compound cresol solution. All food\r\n  utensils should be disinfected by boiling.\r\n\r\n  Persons attending cholera cases should wear gowns and remove the\r\n  same upon leaving the room. Particular care should be exercised in\r\n  hand disinfection after attending a cholera case.\r\n\r\n  There is no danger from aerial conveyance of infectious material\r\n  other than the possibility of one’s coming within the danger zone\r\n  of a vomiting patient. Therefore, for disinfection of a room\r\n  occupied by a cholera patient we need not use formaldehyde gas but\r\n  washing of floors and lower part of walls with 2½% compound cresol\r\n  solution is sufficient. The stock solution of chlorinated lime, 1\r\n  pound to 4 gallons, is suitable for mopping floors and walls.\r\n\r\n_Vaccination prophylaxis_ against cholera has been less used than\r\nhas been the case with plague or typhoid fever. The anti-cholera\r\nsera have no practical value prophylactically and the same statement\r\napplies to the use of such sera in treatment of cholera.\r\n\r\n  Ferran, in 1885, was the first one to use cholera vaccines in\r\n  prophylaxis. Haffkine, in 1893, adopted the use of a preliminary\r\n  subcutaneous injection of an attenuated cholera organism to be\r\n  succeeded later by one, the virulence of which had been exalted by\r\n  passage through animals to a fixed virulence. (Pasteur’s anthrax\r\n  method.) He now only uses the fixed virulence vaccine. This vaccine\r\n  is not killed by heat.\r\n\r\n  The statistics indicate quite a reduction in susceptibility on\r\n  the part of vaccinated persons (probably 8 to 1) but only slight\r\n  lessening of mortality rate. Of 5549 nonvaccinated 198 contracted\r\n  cholera and 124 died. Of 5778 vaccinated 27 contracted cholera and\r\n  14 died.\r\n\r\n  In the recent Balkan war (1913) Kolle’s vaccine was employed with\r\n  considerable success. This vaccine is killed by exposure to 58°C.\r\n  for one hour. It was found that this vaccine was not only of value\r\n  prophylactically but diminished case mortality as well. With 91,224\r\n  persons vaccinated and 8,968 not vaccinated, the case rate among\r\n  the inoculated was 0.7% and the death rate 10.2%, while among the\r\n  noninoculated the case rate was 9.3% and the death rate 27.5%.\r\n\r\n  Ottolenghi prefers to sterilize with a temperature of 53°C. He\r\n  gives 500 million at the first injection and 2 billion at the\r\n  second.\r\n\r\n  Among 72,653 soldiers, having 2 inoculations of this vaccine, the\r\n  incidence of cholera was about 13 times less than among 14,332 who\r\n  were not vaccinated.\r\n\r\n  Of 2897 Greek sanitary corps men inoculated 0.45% were attacked\r\n  while of 114,805 combatants, not inoculated, about 2% were attacked\r\n  by cholera. One would naturally consider the greater exposure of\r\n  the sanitary forces.\r\n\r\n  Cholera vaccines made from killed cultures are the ones now\r\n  generally used.\r\n\r\n  During the World War a Roumanian regiment numbering 4,500 soldiers,\r\n  had 386 cases of cholera develop in the course of six days, with\r\n  166 deaths. Vaccination was commenced and during the interval\r\n  between the first and second injections, new cases continued to\r\n  appear. Two days after the second injection the epidemic ceased. In\r\n  another regiment the commandant refused to have his men vaccinated.\r\n  A group of Jewish soldiers, 200 in number, insisted on being\r\n  vaccinated, which was done. Later the regiment was stricken by\r\n  cholera and 450 cases developed. None of the vaccinated Jewish\r\n  soldiers contracted the disease.\r\n\r\n  Some prefer sensitized living cultures for prophylaxis but such\r\n  vaccines are less practical.\r\n\r\n  There is much to indicate that Strong’s cholera autolysate is of\r\n  value prophylactically. In this cholera cultures are killed at\r\n  60°C. The killed culture is then allowed to digest itself in the\r\n  incubator at 37°C. for three or four days (peptonization). The\r\n  preparation is then filtered and from 2 to 5 cc. of the filtrate is\r\n  injected.\r\n\r\n  =Treatment.=—Many of the older authorities recommended the use\r\n  of various astringent medications for the checking of suspicious\r\n  diarrhoeas and most of these prescriptions contained opium in some\r\n  form, such as lead and opium pills or aromatic sulphuric acid and\r\n  laudanum. In view of the fact that for the infection of animals\r\n  Koch had to employ opium for checking peristalsis in addition to\r\n  neutralization of gastric juice it would seem very undesirable to\r\n  use opium by mouth. Calomel in divided doses and continued over one\r\n  or two days, but not exceeding 7 or 8 grains, has been recommended.\r\n\r\nAt present the treatment which is thought to give the best results is\r\nthe permanganate one proposed by Rogers. In this the patient is given\r\ncalcium permanganate water ad libitum and 2-grain pills of potassium\r\npermanganate every half hour until the stools become more faecal in\r\ncharacter. These pills are made up with vaseline and coated with a\r\nmixture of a 1 part salol and 5 parts of sandarach varnish.\r\n\r\n  Reports as to the use of kaolin in treatment and as a prophylactic\r\n  have been favorable. The suspension in water is given as a drink\r\n  and as an enema.\r\n\r\n  Rogers has recently been administering 1/100 of a grain of atropine\r\n  sulphate morning and evening. His statistics would indicate a\r\n  reduction in mortality of about one-half. Cases treated with\r\n  atropine also rarely show collapse. Injections of adrenalin\r\n  solutions have been recommended.\r\n\r\n  A great objection to any form of oral medication is the tendency to\r\n  vomiting. This can in a measure be controlled by cracked ice or by\r\n  a small hypodermic of morphia. The latter drug also relieves the\r\n  very painful cramps.\r\n\r\n  One danger which must always be borne in mind in giving more than\r\n  one dose of any drug subcutaneously is that with the slowing or\r\n  cessation of circulation, coming on with the algid state, we have\r\n  no absorption but, when the stage of reaction sets in and the drug,\r\n  whether morphine or toxic stimulant, begins to be taken up, there\r\n  may ensue a fatal poisoning.\r\n\r\nHowever the views of authorities may conflict as to special forms\r\nof treatment, there is universal acceptance of the employment of\r\nintravenous injections of fluid to combat collapse. Normal saline\r\nis the fluid usually used, but Rogers recommends his hypertonic\r\nsolution which consists of 120 grains of sodium chloride, 6 grains\r\nof potassium chloride and 4 grains of calcium chloride to the pint of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n  In the Philippines the normal saline seemed to answer as well as\r\n  the hypertonic solution.\r\n\r\n  Sellards had success in combating anuria, which is one of the most\r\n  dangerous conditions encountered in cholera, and at the same time\r\n  answered equally well with normal saline in relieving collapse, by\r\n  giving 2% sodium bicarbonate injections.\r\n\r\n  There is a marked acidosis in cholera and this form of treatment\r\n  seems indicated.\r\n\r\n  The objection to using sodium carbonate is that the salt has\r\n  a lytic action on red cells in vitro and furthermore Sellards\r\n  found that it tended to cause convulsions in one of his cholera\r\n  cases. Sodium bicarbonate, even in 4 or 5% concentration, does\r\n  not have any haemolysing effect on the red cells. Of course it is\r\n  true that in sterilization the bicarbonate tends to be converted\r\n  into carbonate but Sellards found that by sterilization in an\r\n  autoclave connected with live steam, at 7 pounds pressure, this was\r\n  minimized, only about 25% of the bicarbonate being converted into\r\n  carbonate after 1 hour.\r\n\r\n  If the temperature by rectum is about normal or slightly below, the\r\n  temperature of the fluid should be 102° to 104°F. and one usually\r\n  gives about 2 quarts.\r\n\r\nOwing to the collapse of the veins it is usually necessary to cut\r\ndown on them instead of inserting the needle through the skin as for\r\nsalvarsan injections. The same apparatus as for salvarsan injections\r\nis suitable but with a somewhat larger container as we give from 1 to\r\n2 quarts of fluid. At least fifteen minutes should be taken up for\r\nthe introduction of 1 quart of fluid.\r\n\r\n  To determine the necessity for intravenous infusion in cholera\r\n  Rogers has recently recommended the employment of small bottles\r\n  containing aqueous solution of glycerine with specific gravities\r\n  varying from 1048 to 1070, increasing the specific gravity in each\r\n  successive bottle by 2°.\r\n\r\n  Drops of blood from the cholera patient are deposited at the\r\n  center of the surface of the fluid in the bottles from a capillary\r\n  pipette. If the specific gravity of the blood is 1062 at least a\r\n  liter of saline or sodium bicarbonate solution is needed. If 1066,\r\n  at least 2 liters. Formerly he estimated the indications by blood\r\n  pressure, considering a pressure of 80 in Europeans or of 70 in\r\n  natives as indicating intravenous injections.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the reports from the use of anti-cholera sera are\r\nnot very encouraging. Savas, however, was favorably impressed by\r\nsuch treatment during the Balkan war. It should be administered\r\nintravenously and early in the attack and given in doses of 50 cc. Of\r\n61 severe cases, so treated, the mortality was 55.7%. Of 17 severe\r\ncases, not receiving serum treatment, all died.\r\n\r\n  Hot water bottles should be used to keep up the body heat. No food\r\n  should be given during the first thirty-six hours but after that\r\n  time we may give broths or albumin water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMALTA FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Malta fever is a septicaemic condition due to the\r\npresence of the specific organism, _Micrococcus melitensis_, in the\r\nblood and various organs, especially spleen. It runs a protracted\r\ncourse, averaging three or four months, but is attended with very\r\nslight mortality (2%). Rare cases may run an acute course and show a\r\nhigh death rate. The fever course resembles that of a typhoid fever\r\nwith two or more relapses, in that a step-like rise of fever for ten\r\nor twelve days is followed by a similar fall during the succeeding\r\nweek or ten days, an afebrile interval of a few days then ensuing, to\r\nbe followed by a second or third or even tenth febrile wave with the\r\nseparating days of apyrexia. The course of the disease may last for\r\na year or more attended with progressive anaemia and manifestations\r\nof neurasthenia. Very characteristic are sudden swellings of various\r\njoints which subside in a few hours to entirely disappear in a few\r\ndays. Neuralgic manifestations, especially sciatica, are prominent\r\nfeatures of the disease. It is chiefly spread by the milk of infected\r\ngoats and can best be prevented by boiling such milk.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Febris undulans (from the wave-like monthly accessions\r\nof fever). Mediterranean, Gibraltar or “Rock,” Neapolitan, Cyprus\r\nfever (from the geographical distribution). Febris sudoralis (from\r\nthe night sweats). Mediterranean phthisis (from the bronchitis,\r\nanaemia and night sweats resembling phthisis). Melitensis\r\nsepticaemia. Febris melitensis.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—It is generally considered that a disease described by\r\nHippocrates, in which there was an irregular febrile course without\r\ncrisis but showing relapses and running a very prolonged course, was\r\nprobably Malta fever.\r\n\r\n  In 1861 Marston showed on clinical and pathological grounds that\r\n  the disease was different from typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n  In 1887, Colonel Bruce isolated the causative organism from the\r\n  spleen at autopsy and established the demands of Koch’s postulates\r\n  by reproducing the disease in monkeys with cultures from the spleen\r\n  and then recovering the organism from the monkeys.\r\n\r\n  Our present accurate knowledge of the epidemiology of Malta fever\r\n  and its connection with the use of the milk of goats is due to the\r\n  work of a Commission appointed to investigate the disease—1904 to\r\n  1907.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—Geographical distribution of Malta fever.]\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—It is usual to consider Malta as the\r\n  focus of the disease, with the cities of the Mediterranean shores\r\n  showing quite a degree of infection. It is probable that the spread\r\n  of the disease has been in part connected with the importation\r\n  of Maltese goats, these animals being desirable on account of\r\n  their superior yield of milk. It is now known that outside of the\r\n  Mediterranean basin the disease exists in India, East and South\r\n  Africa as well as Northern Africa, China, North and South America\r\n  and the West Indies.\r\n\r\n  Mohler has shown that the disease under the names of “slow fever”\r\n  and “mountain fever” has existed in Texas and New Mexico for at\r\n  least twenty-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The causative organism, _Micrococcus melitensis_, is\r\na small coccus, rather oval than round and about 0.4 micron in\r\ndiameter. In morphology it is quite variable and may occur in pairs\r\nor in short chains and is Gram-negative. It emulsifies evenly and\r\nrapidly in a hanging-drop preparation and is nonmotile. Possibly on\r\naccount of its showing a rather active Brownian motion there has been\r\na reporting of slight motility by some authorities. Very striking is\r\nthe characteristic of very slow growth so that cultures on agar fail\r\nto show colonies before the fourth day.\r\n\r\n  These minute transparent colonies become somewhat opaque and about\r\n  1/10 inch in diameter by the tenth day. Gelatine is not liquefied\r\n  and litmus milk is not altered. The optimum reaction of media\r\n  is about +0.75 to phenolphthalein and it grows best at the body\r\n  temperature. It has great powers of resistance to drying so that it\r\n  survives in dust for long periods.\r\n\r\n  Horses, cows, asses, as well as goats, are susceptible. It is very\r\n  difficult to infect rabbits, mice and guinea pigs. Monkeys have\r\n  been chiefly utilized in experimental work.\r\n\r\n  It would appear as if there were other organisms closely related\r\n  to _M. melitensis_ and a great deal is now being written as to\r\n  confusing serum reactions from the use of _M. paramelitensis_.\r\n\r\n  Evans and others have studied the relationship between _Bacillus\r\n  abortus_ and _M. melitensis_. Morphologically and culturally these\r\n  organisms are quite similar and Evans has demonstrated a marked\r\n  degree of cross-agglutination. This is a probable explanation of\r\n  the finding by Kennedy of agglutinating power in the sera and milk\r\n  of certain cows, but inability to isolate _M. melitensis_ from the\r\n  agglutinating milk.\r\n\r\n  =Epidemiology.=—Many experiments have failed to show any mosquito,\r\n  biting fly or louse as a probable factor in the transmission of\r\n  the disease. The infection is readily transmitted by subcutaneous\r\n  inoculation so that in a case in goat or man, with the cocci in the\r\n  peripheral circulation, it is reasonable to suppose that a biting\r\n  insect might transfer the infection by going directly from one\r\n  animal to another. There have been several laboratory infections,\r\n  but when we consider that of the great number of cases treated at\r\n  Haslar hospital and elsewhere in England, with frequent elimination\r\n  of the organism in the urine, and practically no infections among\r\n  the friends or attendants, it would seem as if usual methods of\r\n  infection were inoperative. There does not seem to be a carrier\r\n  problem in this disease. Urine showing bacterial contamination,\r\n  when dried and mixed with dust, has caused infection and\r\n  contaminated urine applied to the glans penis of a monkey caused\r\n  the disease.\r\n\r\n  As a large proportion of the prostitutes of Malta showed infection\r\n  and as _M. melitensis_ was found in urine and vaginal discharges\r\n  of many of these it is possible that sexual intercourse may be a\r\n  factor in transmission.\r\n\r\nThe Commission noted many cases of Malta fever among the goatherds.\r\nBy agglutination tests it was found that one-half of the goats\r\nshowed agglutinins in their serum. Of 28 monkeys given infected milk\r\n26 became infected. Very conclusive was the case of the “Joshua\r\nNicholson,” which ship carried 65 Maltese goats from Malta to the\r\nUnited States. Of ten of the crew who drank goats’ milk on the\r\nvoyage, eight became infected. Two who boiled the milk escaped\r\ninfection. It is reported, that when the goats reached the United\r\nStates and were quarantined, a woman drank of their milk and became\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\nWhat may be deemed proof positive is the practical disappearance of\r\nthe disease among the naval and military forces of Malta, as the\r\nresult of boiling the milk, while still continuing among native\r\ncivilians. Bassett-Smith has noted that in 1905 there were 798 cases\r\namong civilians and 245 naval cases. In 1907 there were 457 cases\r\namong civilians and only 12 cases in the naval forces.\r\n\r\n  There are however occasional cases which Shaw has considered as due\r\n  to carriers. As the organisms are excreted in faeces as well as in\r\n  urine, and as the course of the disease is so protracted, as well\r\n  as the convalescence, it would seem that the carrier factor should\r\n  be of more importance than facts would justify.\r\n\r\nMohler has noted that in Texas, where the disease has existed for\r\ntwenty-five years, the Mexican goatherds boiled their milk and hence\r\nwere rarely infected.\r\n\r\nGentry and Ferenbaugh, in Texas, noted that cases of Malta fever were\r\nmost common in the spring and early summer months when the goats were\r\nin full milk and the ranchmen were caring for the kids and teaching\r\nthem to suckle. The disease in certain areas was called “goat fever”\r\nand in others “dust fever,” this latter name coming from the idea\r\nthat the dust-filled goat pens had to do with the disease.\r\n\r\n  The souring of milk does not destroy the germs of the disease,\r\n  hence transmission may be brought about by butter and cheese.\r\n\r\n  Malta fever was stamped out of Port Said by destroying all infected\r\n  goats.\r\n\r\nInfection may occur: (1) By the stomach atrium (usual); (2)\r\ncontaminated dust reaching lungs; (3) by subcutaneous injection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nThe germs are found early in the blood and spleen; and are also\r\npresent in lymphatic glands and kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe blood is most apt to contain them at the height of the fever\r\ncurve and a striking feature is the appearance in waves of the\r\norganisms in blood, urine or milk. While serum immunity reactions are\r\nstriking features, there is some question as to the conference of\r\nimmunity by an attack.\r\n\r\n  At postmortem we have an enlarged, congested, soft spleen with\r\n  swollen Malpighian bodies. The kidneys may show a nephritis and\r\n  the mesenteric glands be swollen. The intestines fail to show the\r\n  characteristic lesions of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n  There may be evidences of myocarditis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n_A Typical Case._—Following a period of incubation, varying from\r\nten to fifteen days, headache, malaise and anorexia set in with a\r\nstep-like rise of fever from day to day.\r\n\r\n  The tongue is not heavily coated and is red at the tip and sides.\r\n\r\nConstipation is the rule and there is an early tenderness and\r\nenlargement of the spleen. There is much to suggest typhoid fever in\r\nthe gradual ascent of the remittent fever for about ten or twelve\r\ndays and the gradual descent during the succeeding ten or twelve\r\ndays, but the lack of apathy and slighter evidences of toxaemia\r\ndifferentiate. The patient is dejected rather than apathetic.\r\n\r\n  There is often a slight bronchitis, with cough, which, when\r\n  associated with a profuse sweating at night, may suggest phthisis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—Temperature chart of Malta fever. (After\r\nScheube.)]\r\n\r\nFollowing the initial period of fever there is usually a short\r\nafebrile interval of a few days to be succeeded by a second, third\r\nor many of these febrile waves, thereby making one of the names,\r\nundulant fever, appropriate. Anaemia becomes marked and cardiac\r\nweakness, as shown by palpitation and rapid, irregular pulse,\r\napparent.\r\n\r\n  The symptoms which aid us most in diagnosis are joint\r\n  manifestations and neuralgic pains. These may come on quite early\r\n  in the course of the disease or be delayed until succeeding febrile\r\n  waves set in. Swelling and pain, but without redness, of a single\r\n  joint may come on rather suddenly, to have the acute symptoms\r\n  subside in a few hours and to be entirely normal in three or four\r\n  days.\r\n\r\nPains in the sacro-iliac region or pains resembling those of\r\nhypertrophic arthritis of the spine may be noted.\r\n\r\n  It is however the peripheral nerves, even more than the joints,\r\n  for which the toxic effects of _M. melitensis_ show a preference.\r\n  The sciatic nerve seems to be most often involved and sciatica may\r\n  set in suddenly and acutely, to pass off in two or three days,\r\n  leaving a soreness over the course of the nerve and a tendency to\r\n  recurrence. Orchitis may occasionally set in. There is usually\r\n  albuminuria.\r\n\r\n  Insomnia is usually quite a prominent feature of the disease and\r\n  there is a great tendency for nervous prostration to develop.\r\n\r\nThe usual course of the disease runs for three or four months but may\r\nlast almost a year.\r\n\r\n  =Other Clinical Types.=—(1) _The Malignant Form._—In such cases\r\n  instead of the insidious onset we have the characteristics of a\r\n  severe acute infection with high temperature from the beginning,\r\n  ranging from 103° to 105°F. Such cases may show vomiting and\r\n  early diarrhoea. This is followed by a typhoid state with cardiac\r\n  manifestations in the way of irregularity of the pulse. An ordinary\r\n  type of case may assume this malignant form and such cases may\r\n  develop a broncho-pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  (2) _The Intermittent Form of Hughes._—Here we have a type of case\r\n  similar to the typical one but less severe. It is a subacute form\r\n  which from time to time shows an intermitting fever. These cases\r\n  may fail to show evidence of serious illness and the patient may\r\n  continue his work although noting a progressive deterioration of\r\n  health. Some very mild cases which only rarely show slight fever of\r\n  a few days’ duration have been reported as _ambulatory_ cases.\r\n\r\n  (3) _The Disease in Infants._—Di Cristina and Maggiore have\r\n  described various forms of the disease as observed in infants in\r\n  Palermo. They note a hyperpyrexial type and an undulant type. A\r\n  type with anaemia and marked cachexia is very severe. Another form\r\n  shows cyanosis, irregular pulse and irregular respiration with\r\n  marked sweats. Again the symptoms may be those of a cerebro-spinal\r\n  meningitis.\r\n\r\n  =Sequelae and Complications.=—It should be borne in mind that\r\n  while not serious from a standpoint of mortality this disease is\r\n  to be dreaded by reason of the possibility of invalidism. The\r\n  neuralgic pains, insomnia and mental depression render patients\r\n  liable to the morphine habit. In pregnant women there is a tendency\r\n  to abortion. In rare cases we may have intestinal haemorrhages with\r\n  asthenic manifestations. Bassett-Smith has reported a case with\r\n  extensive purpura. The same author in paramelitensis cases has\r\n  noted the susceptibility to secondary streptococcal infections.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS IN DETAIL\r\n\r\n  _Temperature Chart._—Except in the malignant form of the disease,\r\n  when the temperature may be rather continuous, the fever course is\r\n  a step-like ascent with daily remissions for about ten days and\r\n  then a similar descent. Following an evening rise of temperature\r\n  night sweats may be noted.\r\n\r\n  It is the wave-like succession of such courses of fever, separated\r\n  by afebrile intervals, that suggests the name undulant fever.\r\n\r\n  _Circulatory System._—The disease shows rather a toxic effect on\r\n  the heart as shown by palpitation and irregularity and rapidity of\r\n  pulse rate.\r\n\r\n  In the beginning of the fever, however, the pulse rate is not very\r\n  fast. Anaemia is a rather marked feature.\r\n\r\n  _Respiratory System._—A slight bronchitis with cough tends to\r\n  suggest phthisis in those cases which show rather marked night\r\n  sweats.\r\n\r\n  _Nervous System._—The organism seems to have a selective action\r\n  on the nervous system as shown by headache, various neuralgias,\r\n  insomnia, apathy and neurasthenia. Sciatica is probably the most\r\n  common peripheral nerve involvement.\r\n\r\n  _Joint Symptoms._—Very characteristic are the sudden and painful\r\n  swellings of various joints, especially hip, shoulder, ankle and\r\n  knee. Not rarely the costo-sternal articulations may be involved.\r\n  The acute symptoms subside in a few hours and the joints become\r\n  normal in a few days.\r\n\r\n  _Alimentary Tract Symptoms._—The tongue may have a slight furring\r\n  but the edges and tip are quite clean and red. Although anorexia\r\n  exists with the fever the appetite tends to return with apyrexia.\r\n  Constipation is usual. There is frequently tenderness of the\r\n  epigastric region.\r\n\r\n  _Genito-urinary System._—Other than for albuminuria and the\r\n  presence at intervals of the causative bacteria in the urine, there\r\n  is nothing of note, except the occurrence of orchitis in about 3\r\n  per cent. of cases.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—The white count is about normal or slightly\r\n  reduced—6500 on the average. The cells of lymphocyte type tend to\r\n  show an increase in percentage with a corresponding reduction of\r\n  polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n  There is a secondary anaemia.\r\n\r\n  The spleen shows early enlargement and tenderness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—The diseases most apt to be confused with\r\nMalta fever are typhoid fever, malignant tertian malaria, liver\r\nabscess, influenza, phthisis and kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  Besides the agglutination, complement fixation or blood culture\r\n  aids, we rely upon the sudden onset of joint involvement or\r\n  neuralgic manifestations as indicating Malta fever.\r\n\r\n  Usually the splenic enlargement about corresponds with that of\r\n  typhoid fever but at times it may be so marked as to equal that of\r\n  malaria or even kala-azar.\r\n\r\n  The presence of rose spots as well as the marked apathetic state\r\n  and the tendency to diarrhoea should aid in differentiating\r\n  typhoid. Unfortunately for diagnosis the leucopenia and polynuclear\r\n  percentage reduction is similar in the two diseases.\r\n\r\nIn kala-azar the double temperature rise in 24 hours with the\r\n_Leishmania_ bodies in spleen puncture material, instead of _M.\r\nmelitensis_, are differentiating.\r\n\r\n  The short course and more sudden onset of influenza and the more\r\n  marked pulmonary symptoms of phthisis should prove diagnostic aids.\r\n\r\nLiver abscess and empyema with their tendency to anaemia and\r\nsweating may prove confusing, but the history, leucocytosis and\r\nlocation of pain should differentiate. Then too the joint and nerve\r\nmanifestations of Malta fever are absent.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—Eyre obtained cultures from blood from the\r\n2d to 300th day of the disease. He recommended the taking of at\r\nleast 5 cc. from a vein and that this be done at a time when the\r\nfever is at its maximum point—the days when the fever is at its\r\nmaximum and in the evening of that day. By taking 20 to 30 cc. in an\r\nequal amount of citrated salt solution, as described in chapter on\r\nblood examination, one should have as great success as had Eyre—158\r\npositives in 235 cases or 65.4 per cent.\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that the colonies only appear about the\r\n  fourth day, becoming quite distinct by the tenth day.\r\n\r\n  Bassett-Smith takes about 10 cc. of blood in the afternoon during\r\n  pyrexial waves and distributes this blood in several tubes of\r\n  broth. He makes plates from these tubes every day. He also\r\n  recommends the taking of 1 cc. of blood which he allows to clot and\r\n  subsequently removes the serum and adds bouillon (clot culture).\r\n\r\nAgglutination is the chief reliance in diagnosis. As result of two\r\ninfections in his laboratory Widal uses emulsions killed by ¾% of\r\nformalin. He uses the microscopic method in the test with dilutions\r\nnot exceeding 1 to 200. Such emulsions keep for at least a year.\r\n\r\n  In connection with agglutination tests Nicolle recommends that the\r\n  serum be separated at once and removed from the clot and Nègre\r\n  has shown that by heating the serum to 56°C., for thirty minutes,\r\n  reactions are not obtained with nonspecific sera.\r\n\r\n  Some workers prefer the macroscopic agglutination.\r\n\r\n  Complement fixation methods are of value but the application of\r\n  such tests is confined to large laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe mortality is usually reported as 2% but there have been epidemics\r\nwhere the mortality, owing to the frequency of the very fatal\r\nmalignant type, has exceeded 10%. It must be remembered however\r\nthat the invaliding connected with the long course of the disease\r\nand protracted convalescence makes Malta fever a serious affection.\r\nNeurasthenia, susceptibility to neuralgias, cardiac weakness and\r\nformation of morphine habit may result from the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The danger from carriers seems slight but should be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nDisinfection of excreta, in particular urine, is important.\r\n\r\nBoiling of goat’s milk or killing of infected goats is a prime\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n  A rapid method of detecting infected goats is by carrying out a\r\n  macroscopic agglutination of _M. melitensis_ with the milk obtained\r\n  from goats. The lacto-reaction should be confirmed by a serum one.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—There is no specific treatment generally recognized as\r\nefficient. Recently, an anti-melitensis serum, from animals injected\r\nwith the nucleo-proteid material from the organisms, has been used\r\nwith some success.\r\n\r\n  A serum prepared by injecting horses intravenously with the\r\n  specific organism has been recommended by Sergent in doses of 50 cc.\r\n\r\n  Bassett-Smith recommends an autogenous vaccine, during the afebrile\r\n  period, in doses of from 50 to 200 millions. He thinks that the\r\n  best results are obtained with sensitized vaccines. During acute\r\n  phases the vaccine treatment is detrimental—it is only in chronic\r\n  cases that such treatment is of value. Some prefer to give doses of\r\n  10 million or so at short intervals. He also thinks yeast in 2-dram\r\n  doses to be of value. Phenacetin or aspirin may be given, but the\r\n  heart weakness makes extensive use of these analgesics dangerous.\r\n\r\n  The diet should be that for any acute disease but the protracted\r\n  course makes it necessary to have regard to an adequate food value.\r\n  Care should be taken to avoid chilling or fatigue.\r\n\r\n  Some recommend moderate use of alcoholic stimulation but this\r\n  treatment is questionable.\r\n\r\n  Cold sponging and local applications to joint or nerve involvements\r\n  are indicated.\r\n\r\n  Morphine should be employed with great caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nLEPROSY\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Leprosy is a very chronic, almost incurable disease,\r\nwith a protracted period of incubation (two to ten years), which\r\nsets in with indefinite prodromata of malaise, and irregular febrile\r\nattacks associated with sweating and somnolence. In nerve leprosy\r\nthere may be vague manifestations of neuritis as prodromata. There\r\nare two well-recognized types of the disease. The type characterized\r\nby granulomatous proliferations in corium and subcutaneous tissues,\r\nas well as lymphatic glands, is known as nodular or skin leprosy. It\r\nshows spots and nodular infiltrations, chiefly about lobes of ears,\r\nalae of nose and region of eyebrows, with falling out of hairs of\r\neyebrows and bearded region, and also involves extensor surfaces of\r\nforearms, dorsal surfaces of hands and feet. The palms of hands and\r\nsoles of feet are almost never invaded. The other type is known as\r\nnerve or maculo-anaesthetic leprosy and is characterized by nerve\r\nthickenings, flat anaesthetic spots, chiefly of the covered region\r\nof the body, muscular palsies and atrophies, with trophic changes\r\nleading to contractures and mutilations. When the two types are\r\nassociated we have mixed leprosy.\r\n\r\n  The disease is caused by an acid-fast bacillus, which has not\r\n  surely been cultivated or inoculated into animals with pathogenic\r\n  result, and which is found in extraordinary abundance in the\r\n  granulomatous subepithelial tissues of nodular leprosy and in\r\n  scanty numbers or not at all in the perineurium and endoneurium of\r\n  the ulnar, facial or perineal nerves.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Lepra. Elephantiasis Graecorum. Leontiasis. Satyriasis.\r\nFrench: La Lèpre. German: Aussatz.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—There are those who consider India as the home of\r\n  leprosy, a condition corresponding to the disease having been\r\n  described in the Rig Veda, of date of 1400, B. C.\r\n\r\n  Others regard Egypt as the original focus, a disease similar to\r\n  leprosy having been described in the “Ebers papyrus” of date of\r\n  about 1300, B. C.\r\n\r\n  Any one reading chapter xiii, Leviticus, must be convinced that\r\n  the disease there described as leprosy was of a different nature.\r\n  We find statements to the effect that where the hair in the spot\r\n  is white and the spot deeper than the skin of the flesh that it\r\n  is leprosy; again, if there be a white or red rising it is not\r\n  leprosy, but if lower than the skin it is leprosy.\r\n\r\n  According to Unna the term Zaarath had a theological rather than\r\n  a medical meaning. At the same time other references in the Bible\r\n  would indicate that leprosy was more or less prevalent among the\r\n  Jews of that period.\r\n\r\n  It is very probable that the ancients confused leprosy with many\r\n  other diseases where ulceration and nodular disfigurement were\r\n  conspicuous features.\r\n\r\n  From the fact that leprosy was called the Phoenecian disease it\r\n  would seem that Asia was the real home of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—Geographical distribution of leprosy.]\r\n\r\n  It is well established that leprosy was introduced into Europe,\r\n  from Egypt, in the first century, B. C., by the returning legions\r\n  of Pompey.\r\n\r\n  As a result of the crusades, leprosy was spread widely over Europe\r\n  by the crusaders, so that in the 14th century the disease was so\r\n  prevalent, that it required approximately 20,000 leper asylums to\r\n  care for the lepers. In France alone there were about 2000 such\r\n  leprosaria.\r\n\r\n  As a result of the most drastic measures of isolation the disease\r\n  began to decrease in the 14th century and had practically\r\n  disappeared from Europe, as a whole, by the 15th century.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—With the exception of a limited and\r\n  steadily diminishing number of cases in Norway and Sweden, with\r\n  an uncertain number in the Balkan region and Turkey, leprosy has\r\n  almost disappeared from Europe. Parts of Brittany and Provence in\r\n  France show cases and there are a considerable number in Portugal\r\n  and Spain.\r\n\r\n  Africa is heavily infected with the disease, especially in Central\r\n  and East Africa. In certain portions of the Cameroons (Banyang) it\r\n  is so common that one in every four persons suffers from leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Asia has many important leprosy centers, there being a very great\r\n  number in China and India. There are about 100,000 lepers in Japan\r\n  and about 3000 in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n  In 1902 there were 278 lepers in the United States, of which number\r\n  145 were native born. In 1912 there were only 146 distributed\r\n  chiefly in three centers: (1) That of the Great Lakes, there\r\n  being now 13 cases in Minnesota as against 27 in 1900; (2) among\r\n  the Orientals of the Pacific Coast, and (3) in the Gulf region,\r\n  especially about Louisiana and Florida.\r\n\r\n  There are 696 lepers in Hawaii and 28 in Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n  In South America, the disease is found in Columbia, Venezuela and\r\n  Brazil as is also true of Mexico and Central America.\r\n\r\n  In Australia the disease is found in Queensland and New South Wales.\r\n\r\n  It also prevails in New Caledonia and the islands of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—Leprosy is caused by an acid-fast bacillus, _Bacillus\r\nleprae_, which rather closely resembles the tubercle bacillus\r\nmorphologically as well as tinctorially. It was first discovered by\r\nHansen in 1871 and fully reported in 1874. Much of our knowledge of\r\nits characteristics is due to Neisser (1879).\r\n\r\n  The leprosy bacilli are found in profusion in the granulomatous\r\n  tissue of the corium and subcutaneous structures of the leprous\r\n  nodules, chiefly within cells called “lepra cells” and also within\r\n  endothelial and connective-tissue cells as well as lying free,\r\n  packed in lymphatic channels, the so-called “globi.”\r\n\r\nThe leprosy bacillus may be distinguished from the tubercle bacillus\r\nby the following points:\r\n\r\n  1. The presence ordinarily of huge numbers of bacilli often grouped\r\n  in packets like a bundle of cigars tied together.\r\n\r\n  It will be remembered that it is very difficult to find even a\r\n  single tubercle bacillus in a skin lesion. Leprosy bacilli form\r\n  palisade groups but not chains.\r\n\r\n  2. The leprosy bacilli stain more solidly and when granules are\r\n  present they are coarser and more widely separated than the fine\r\n  granulations of the tubercle bacillus.\r\n\r\n  3. They do not stand decolorization quite as well as the tubercle\r\n  bacillus. With 20% sulphuric acid in water they hold their color\r\n  almost as well as tubercle bacilli but with 3% HCl in alcohol they\r\n  decolorize in about two hours as against twelve to twenty-four\r\n  hours for the tubercle bacillus.\r\n\r\n  4. Leprosy bacilli have neither been surely cultivated nor surely\r\n  inoculated with pathogenic results into guinea pigs or other\r\n  experimental animals and it is by the negative results upon\r\n  cultivating or animal inoculation that we have our surest method of\r\n  differentiation from tubercle bacilli.\r\n\r\n  Leprosy bacilli are chiefly spread through the lymphatics, but\r\n  in nodular leprosy, their occurrence in the blood stream during\r\n  the febrile accessions is so constant that this route may also be\r\n  of importance. Next to the corium they are most abundant in the\r\n  lymphatic glands. They stain readily by Gram’s method.\r\n\r\n  A great amount of work has been done within recent years in\r\n  attempting to cultivate the leprosy bacillus.\r\n\r\n  In 1900 Kedrowsky culturing material from 3 cases of leprosy\r\n  obtained diphtheroids from two and a streptothrix from one.\r\n  A rabbit was inoculated first intracerebrally and later\r\n  intraperitoneally with this nonacid-fast streptothrix and, when\r\n  killed six months later, showed peritoneal nodules, from which\r\n  both diphtheroids and acid-fast bacilli, but not a streptothrix,\r\n  were recovered culturally. Injections of cultures of the acid-fast\r\n  bacilli and diphtheroids into rabbits and mice produced nodules\r\n  which when cultured showed acid-fast organisms or diphtheroids.\r\n\r\n  In 1901 he cultivated a diphtheroid from a fourth case of leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Fraser and Fletcher working with Kedrowsky’s culture produced\r\n  peritoneal nodules with the killed as well as the living organism.\r\n  They were able to produce the same results with _B. phlei_. With\r\n  emulsions of leprous nodules, rich in leprosy bacilli, they could\r\n  not produce similar lesions in the experimental guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n  Rost obtained a culture on a salt-free medium from which he\r\n  prepared his _leprolin_ by a process similar to that used for\r\n  old tuberculin. It was claimed that leprolin had marked curative\r\n  power in leprosy. Recently Williams and Rost have cultivated a\r\n  streptothrix on a medium containing milk.\r\n\r\n  Clegg, by inoculating his medium with cultural amoebae, obtained\r\n  growth of a diphtheroid organism, with acid-fast tendencies, from\r\n  the spleen pulp of lepers.\r\n\r\n  Duval, by using media containing amino-acids, as result of tryptic\r\n  digestion, brought forward two organisms, one of which was a\r\n  diphtheroid and grew luxuriantly while the other showed a slow\r\n  scanty growth and was acid-fast.\r\n\r\n  Bayon, by using placental media, isolated an organism rather\r\n  resembling that of Kedrowsky. These organisms alone responded to\r\n  immunity tests when such were made by Bayon and they alone gave\r\n  rise to tissue changes resembling those of leprosy when injected\r\n  into animals.\r\n\r\n  Professor Deycke obtained a streptothrix-like growth from the\r\n  granulomatous tissue of excised leprous nodules. The ethereal\r\n  extract from this culture gave a neutral fat which he called\r\n  _nastin_ and which is the basis of a leprosy treatment.\r\n\r\nQuite recently and after working for eighteen months, with material\r\nfrom 32 nonulcerative cases of nodular leprosy, not only with media\r\nas recommended by Duval, Rost and Bayon, but with blood and serum\r\nculture media, both by aerobic and anaerobic procedures, Fraser has\r\nbeen unable, in a single instance, to obtain any evidence of growth\r\nfrom this wealth of leprosy material.\r\n\r\n  As being opposed to the possibility of culturing the human leprosy\r\n  bacillus, it may be stated that most of the experiments along this\r\n  line with rat leprosy, a disease occurring naturally in rats and\r\n  caused by an organism almost identical, as to lesions produced,\r\n  with the leprosy bacillus, have been negative. Bayon, however,\r\n  states that he has cultivated the bacillus of rat leprosy.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—There is a consensus of opinion that every case of\r\nleprosy owes its origin to contact, direct or indirect, with some\r\nother case, but evidence as to the manner in which the disease is\r\ntransmitted, or even the proof of transmission, is to a great extent\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\n  Every book refers to the inoculation experiment by Arning, of a\r\n  freshly excised leprous nodule sewn into a skin incision of the arm\r\n  of a condemned criminal. In this case a neuritis developed shortly\r\n  after the inoculation and the patient showed fully developed\r\n  leprosy three years later. Unfortunately for the value of the\r\n  experiment the man was a native of Hawaii and had lepers in his\r\n  own family. Against this experiment are the numerous instances\r\n  where physicians have inoculated themselves and others with leprous\r\n  material with invariably negative results.\r\n\r\nDanielson inoculated himself and nine others with leprous material\r\nand later Profeta repeated the same, but without success in a single\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n  As regards those living for a long time in attendance on lepers\r\n  there have been a very few instances of the contraction of leprosy\r\n  as in the case of Father Damien at Molokai, and two instances in\r\n  Sisters of Mercy. Such cases however are most exceptional, as the\r\n  hundreds of attendants on the unfortunates continue their work for\r\n  years without showing any signs of leprosy.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that there has never been an instance of transmission of\r\nleprosy to any attendant at the Saint Louis Hospital, Paris.\r\n\r\n  There are two cases which show that those who live in close\r\n  relation to lepers may develop the disease; in one, a leper\r\n  returned to Ireland and his brother, who had never been in a\r\n  leprosy country, but who had occupied the same bed with the leper\r\n  and worn his clothes, developed the disease in about five years. A\r\n  similar case is reported from Germany.\r\n\r\nAs showing that even with intimate contact, infection is rare, it is\r\nstated that of 225 healthy Hawaiians, living in the same houses with\r\nlepers, only 4½% contracted leprosy. Even when married to lepers only\r\n9 out of 181 healthy people contracted leprosy from their leprous\r\nmates.\r\n\r\n  In Japan, 7% of children of lepers contract the disease, 3.8% of\r\n  those married to lepers and 2.7% of people living in the same house\r\n  with lepers.\r\n\r\n  Just as with tuberculosis, in which all evidence points to the\r\n  predominance of infection in early life and its infrequency in\r\n  adult life, so does it seem to be true of leprosy. Among 10,000\r\n  lepers in the Culion leper colony, Denny notes that 35% were\r\n  brothers and sisters, 27% were cousins, 11% were children of\r\n  lepers, 7% parents of lepers, and only 1% husband and wife. This\r\n  would indicate that the relationships involving intimate contact in\r\n  childhood are etiologically most important.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest proofs that leprosy is at least feebly\r\ncontagious is that based on the disappearance of the disease\r\nfollowing isolation of the lepers. The best instance is that of\r\nEurope, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, where, with\r\n20,000 leper asylums for isolation, the disease disappeared by the\r\nfifteenth century. In Norway, there were 2833 cases in 1856, while in\r\n1907, there were only 438 left.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1913 there were only 285 cases, 181 of these being\r\ninterned and 104 in their own homes. The reduction is attributed to\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\n  This might have occurred without isolation because Hansen in\r\n  investigating the descendants of 160 known Norwegian lepers, who\r\n  immigrated to the North-western States of America, was unable to\r\n  find trace of a single leper among their descendants.\r\n\r\nThis and other facts militate against the views that leprosy may be\r\ninherited and the idea is generally held that if a child be taken\r\naway from its leprous surroundings after birth there is little or no\r\nlikelihood of its developing leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Again, it is a well-recognized fact that leprosy is more than\r\n  twice as common among men than among women. It is probable that\r\n  the greater opportunity for contact with lepers by man is the\r\n  explanation of the greater frequency.\r\n\r\n_Views as to Mode of Transmission._—It may be stated that nothing\r\ndefinite is known. There has been an idea that itch mites might\r\ntransmit the disease but no proof has been advanced. Lebouf found\r\nleprosy bacilli in the stomachs of flies, which had been feeding on\r\nleprotic ulcerations, and did not find acid-fast rods in flies which\r\nhad fed on persons with nerve leprosy or upon those not showing open\r\nlesions. He thinks that flies may deposit faeces containing bacilli\r\nabout the nasal orifices or upon wounds of well persons, bringing\r\nabout thereby their infection.\r\n\r\n  Skelton was unable to find evidences of leprosy bacilli in bedbugs\r\n  living in the beds of lepers. Paldrock also was unable to find any\r\n  evidence of leprosy bacilli in bedbugs a few hours after feeding on\r\n  leprous tissue, but did find acid-fast rods in cockroaches which\r\n  had fed on leprosy nodules, even fourteen days after the feeding.\r\n\r\n  A. J. Smith fed bedbugs on Duval’s organism and recovered acid-fast\r\n  bacilli for considerable periods. The question arises, however, as\r\n  to the significance of Duval’s bacillus for leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Acid-fast bacilli have been reported from head lice and mosquitoes,\r\n  when the insects have been feeding on leprous tissue, but little or\r\n  no evidence of any multiplication has been obtained.\r\n\r\n  For many years Jonathan Hutchinson insisted that leprosy was caused\r\n  by the eating of imperfectly cured or decomposing fish, a view\r\n  which now has no supporters.\r\n\r\nFor a time it was considered that the initial lesions of leprosy were\r\nto be found in the nasal mucosa and especially in ulcerations of\r\nthe nasal septum and that it was by the atrium of the nasal mucous\r\nmembrane that infection occurred.\r\n\r\n  There is no question but that the examination of the nasal mucus\r\n  for leprosy bacilli is of prime importance in diagnosis and it may\r\n  be that cases showing ulcerations of the septum are especially\r\n  dangerous when sneezing, but very few believe that leprosy is to\r\n  any extent contracted through this channel. de Azevedo examined\r\n  smears from the nasal mucosa in 59 persons who were in close\r\n  contact with lepers without finding acid-fast bacilli in a single\r\n  instance.\r\n\r\n  With a period of incubation covering from two to ten years it is\r\n  of course manifestly difficult to arrive at any correct idea as\r\n  to transmission but there is a growing belief that the free and\r\n  frequent use of soap is a decided factor in preventing infection\r\n  which may, like rat leprosy, be best brought about by continued\r\n  contact with a skin surface more or less abraded. There has been a\r\n  suspicion, but no proof, that sexual intercourse may bring about\r\n  infection.\r\n\r\n_Rat Leprosy._—A disease occurring naturally among rats was first\r\nobserved by Stefansky, in Odessa, in 1903.\r\n\r\n  There are two types: (1) Of skin and muscles, and (2) of the\r\n  lymphatic glands. In the skin form areas of alopecia are present\r\n  with thickening of the site invaded. These areas are most often on\r\n  the back of the head. Just as in human leprosy the epithelium is\r\n  unaffected, the corium however being filled with cells packed with\r\n  acid-fast bacilli, exactly similar to the picture in human leprosy.\r\n  Ulceration of these subcutaneous nodules is common.\r\n\r\n  In the glandular type the glands are enlarged and the lymph sinuses\r\n  packed with the causative bacilli.\r\n\r\n  In rat leprosy it has been found that infection of other rats takes\r\n  places as readily through slight abrasions of the skin as when\r\n  material is injected subcutaneously.\r\n\r\n  The idea is that natural infection occurs by way of the skin and\r\n  through the lymphatics. There is no evidence that insects play a\r\n  part in transmission.\r\n\r\n  Rat leprosy prevails extensively in Europe, Asia and America.\r\n  Although similar etiologically and pathologically there does not\r\n  seem to be any connection between the disease in rat and in man, as\r\n  is the case with human and rat plague.\r\n\r\n  The prevalence of rat leprosy in the various parts of the world\r\n  varies greatly; thus in Odessa 4 to 5% of the rats are infected\r\n  while in San Francisco only ⅕ of 1%.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nIn whatever way introduced the leprosy bacilli tend to invade and\r\nmultiply in the lymphatics of the corium and subcutaneous tissues.\r\nIn response to irritation, cells of disputed type, possibly plasma\r\ncells, appear and phagocytize the bacilli in large numbers, so that\r\neventually the outline of the cell, as brought out in acid-fast\r\nstaining, is that of a mass of red bacilli.\r\n\r\nThese red-staining bodies are called _lepra cells_. In addition,\r\nendothelial cells phagocytize the bacilli and these with their\r\nbacilli, together with the free lying masses of bacilli in the\r\nlymphatic sinuses, make the so-called “globi” when seen in transverse\r\nsection. The toxicity of the lepra bacillus is only slight so that\r\nwe may have very large giant cells of the Langhans type and this\r\nprobably explains the absence of caseation in leprosy. The arteries\r\nof the leproma, as the granulomatous mass is termed, undergo an\r\narteritis with thickening of their walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—Section of spleen showing lepra cells and\r\nlepra bacilli. × 800. By permission from Manson’s Tropical Diseases.]\r\n\r\n  The leproma is a mass of cells of varying sizes and types in a\r\n  connective-tissue framework. The infiltrations are chiefly about\r\n  the hair bulbs, sweat glands and arteries. The epidermis is\r\n  separated from the leproma by a connective-tissue layer and is\r\n  uninvolved except for a thinning out of the layer and obliteration\r\n  of the interpapillary epithelial pegs.\r\n\r\n  Incision of a leprous nodule shows a smooth glistening cut of a\r\n  yellowish to slate gray color.\r\n\r\nIn nerve leprosy the cellular proliferations in the region of the\r\nblood vessels and later in the perineurium and endoneurium cause\r\npressure on the axis-cylinder with consequent degeneration. The\r\naffected nerves are swollen and reddish-gray in color. It is now\r\nthought that an axonal degeneration involves the cells of the\r\nanterior horns so that this, as well as the peripheral neuritis, is a\r\nfactor in the muscular atrophies which are features of the disease.\r\nThe sensory fibres are destroyed before the motor ones.\r\n\r\n  Leprous changes are common in the anterior part of the eye,\r\n  as of conjunctiva, cornea and iris, but rare in the posterior\r\n  eyeball. The mucosa of tongue, larynx and, pharynx is often\r\n  involved. Cartilage and bone are destroyed through pressure of the\r\n  granulomatous tissue.\r\n\r\n  The ovaries and testes may show connective-tissue increase.\r\n\r\n  Nephritis is rather common in leprosy but there is considerable\r\n  doubt whether the lungs are invaded by leprosy, except most rarely.\r\n\r\n  Next to skin, mucous membrane and nerves, the lymphatic glands show\r\n  the greatest involvement.\r\n\r\n  The liver not uncommonly in nodular leprosy and more rarely the\r\n  spleen may show connective tissue or cellular infiltrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation of leprosy is peculiarly prolonged and is\r\nat any rate from two to five years and may extend over many years,\r\nHallopeau having recorded a case where the disease did not develop\r\nfor twenty-seven years after the patient left the infected district.\r\nThe early manifestations are vague and indefinite, consisting chiefly\r\nof malaise, weariness and mental depression.\r\n\r\n  There are often noted (_a_) irregular accessions of fever (leprotic\r\n  fever), attended with rather profuse sweating, so that the onset\r\n  may be mistaken for a malarial infection; (_b_) progressive\r\n  weakness, the patient being easily fatigued with a tendency to\r\n  somnolence; (_c_) alternating attacks of dryness and hypersecretion\r\n  of the nasal mucous membrane, with frequent attacks of epistaxis,\r\n  and (_d_) various neuralgic manifestations or paraesthesias as well\r\n  as headache. These prodromal manifestations usually precede but may\r\n  accompany the outbreak of the spots.\r\n\r\n  It is the prominence of the nasal manifestations that has caused\r\n  Sticker to insist that the primary lesion of leprosy is of the\r\n  nasal mucosa, the general view, however, being that this view\r\n  is without sufficient foundation and as a matter of fact some\r\n  have recently suggested that the disease first manifests itself\r\n  in the lymphatic glands, punctures of such structures showing\r\n  bacilli rather frequently, although in less proportion than upon\r\n  examination of the nasal mucosa.\r\n\r\nAll authorities recognize two well-separated clinical types of\r\nleprosy, one the nodular, skin, hypertrophic or tubercular form and\r\nthe other the smooth, nerve, maculo-anaesthetic or atrophic form.\r\n\r\n  These fairly distinct types tend to run into one another and in\r\n  such cases we have the mixed form of the disease.\r\n\r\nFollowing Manson I use the terms nodular and nerve leprosy. It is\r\nusually stated that in Northern climates nodular leprosy forms about\r\n70% of cases while, in the tropics, the larger proportion is made up\r\nof nerve leprosy.\r\n\r\n  At one time a classification of the 239 lepers at San Lazaro\r\n  Hospital, Manila, P. I., showed 97 cases of nodular, 42 of nerve\r\n  and 93 of mixed leprosy, with two cases of doubtful nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nNODULAR LEPROSY\r\n\r\n_A Typical Case._—After more or less indefinite and uncharacteristic\r\nprodromata the definite onset is by an outbreak of brownish red spots\r\nwhich later become pigmented and thickened. These spots are at first\r\nerythematous and tend to come out in crops, attended with attacks of\r\nirregular fever. They soon have the appearance of limited areas of\r\nsunburn. They vary in size from 1 or 2 millimeters to a blotch the\r\nsize of the palm of the hand.\r\n\r\n  They are raised and have a preference for appearing on the lobes of\r\n  the ears, the nasal alae, the forehead, eyebrows, cheeks and chin.\r\n\r\n  The extensor surfaces of the forearms, thighs and buttocks are also\r\n  favorite sites for the indurated spots. The palms of the hands,\r\n  soles of the feet, hairy scalp, groin and axillary regions are\r\n  almost never attacked.\r\n\r\n  These spots may be hyperaesthetic at first but soon show loss\r\n  of pain and temperature sense with retention of touch sensation\r\n  (dissociation of sensation). These spots do not sweat, they remain\r\n  dry even in a general perspiration.\r\n\r\nFollowing successive febrile accessions and reappearances of spots we\r\nhave developed reddish-brown nodular masses, usually on the sites of\r\nthe spots.\r\n\r\n  When the nodules are grasped between the fingers one usually finds\r\n  them elastic to touch. As the result of active sebaceous secretion\r\n  these nodules have a greasy appearance.\r\n\r\nThese protruding nodules may give the face a leonine appearance,\r\nhence the name leontiasis, or that of a satyr, hence satyriasis. With\r\nthe development of the nodules the hair falls out of the eyebrows and\r\nbearded face. Nodules develop in the mucous membranes of the nose,\r\nmouth and larynx, giving rise to foetid discharges and obstruction of\r\nthe nares, difficulty in mastication as well as in breathing and a\r\nraucous voice.\r\n\r\n  The eye is involved with frightful frequency in this form of\r\n  leprosy, there being infiltrations of the eyelids, conjunctivae,\r\n  cornea and iris, with subsequent ulcerations and loss of sight.\r\n\r\nThe nodules on face, backs of hands, buttocks, etc., may disappear\r\nby resolution but the tendency is for them to ulcerate and produce\r\nvarious contractions and deformities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—Nodular leprosy. Advanced stage with\r\nulceration. Leontiasis. (Van Harlingen.)]\r\n\r\n  The glands in the region of the lesions become enlarged but do not\r\n  tend to suppurate.\r\n\r\nVisceral involvements are not common but serious lesions of the liver\r\nhave been reported.\r\n\r\n  The course of the disease is essentially chronic and if some\r\n  intercurrent affection does not carry off the patient, the end\r\n  comes in a cachexia in about ten years, the temperature gradually\r\n  falling and a state of somnolence ushering in the end.\r\n\r\n  When nerve leprosy sets in upon a nodular type the life of the\r\n  patient seems to be prolonged.\r\n\r\n\r\nNerve Leprosy\r\n\r\n_A Typical Case._—The prodromal manifestations are characterized\r\nby the results of irritation of the granulomatous tissue upon the\r\nnerve fibers and are chiefly neuralgic pains or signs of sensory\r\ndisturbances as formication, paraesthesias, etc. In particular, are\r\nthe ulnar, peroneal and facial nerves attacked, the process very\r\nrarely extending above the knee or elbow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—Nerve leprosy. Perforating ulcer of the\r\nfoot. (U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin.)]\r\n\r\n  Anaesthesia of the region supplied by the ulnar nerve with\r\n  contractures of the fourth and fifth fingers may be signs directing\r\n  our attention to the true nature of the disease and in those cases\r\n  where the appearance of smooth yellowish-brown spots precedes the\r\n  neuritis manifestations we may here also find anaesthesia, provided\r\n  the eruption has lasted for some time.\r\n\r\nIn brief the fully developed case of nerve leprosy shows anaesthetic\r\nspots, trophic lesions of the skin and bone, together with muscular\r\npalsies. The spots often appear singly and may be from ½ to several\r\ninches in diameter. They are not raised, have a sunburnt color and do\r\nnot sweat. Instead of having a preference for the exposed parts they\r\nmost frequently appear on the covered portion of the body or limbs as\r\ntrunk, buttocks, scapular region, thighs or arms, although the first\r\nappearance of spots may be on the face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.—Nerve leprosy, showing deformities,\r\nperforating ulcer, etc. (From U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin.)]\r\n\r\n  These spots often look like ringworm lesions, as they have an\r\n  erythematous border with a paler center, but they are oval in\r\n  outline rather than round and there is no scaling. Bullous\r\n  eruptions, which are most frequently noted about the knuckles, are\r\n  rare manifestations of nerve leprosy. They are often followed by\r\n  ulceration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.—Nerve or maculo-anaesthetic leprosy showing\r\nanaesthetic spots on back (U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin.)]\r\n\r\nAbout this time the nerve trunks begin to enlarge, especially\r\nthe ulnar at the elbow and the great auricular as it crosses the\r\nsterno-mastoid muscle. The characteristic nerve enlargement is\r\nspindle-shaped or beaded.\r\n\r\n  These nerve enlargements are at first tender but later become\r\n  painless and we have extensive areas of anaesthesia and trophic\r\n  changes of the skin and nails of fingers and toes such as felons,\r\n  glazed skin, bullae, which latter on rupturing leave ulcers.\r\n\r\n  We also have absorption of the bones of the phalanges.\r\n\r\n  The phalangeal bones may be completely absorbed and a distorted\r\n  nail cap the end of the metacarpal bone (_lepra mutilans_). Owing\r\n  to the anaesthesia lepers often burn or injure their fingers and\r\n  toes. Perforating ulcers are more common in leprosy than tabes.\r\n\r\nMuscular palsies, atrophies and contractures are more common in the\r\nface and upper extremity than in the lower extremity. We may have\r\nchanges quite similar to those of progressive muscular atrophy, the\r\nthenar and hypothenar, as well as the interossei, undergoing atrophy\r\nand resulting in the claw hand. There is extension of the first joint\r\nand flexion of the two distal joints of the fingers. Such hands may\r\nfunction quite well. Wrist-drop is not uncommon but foot-drop is\r\nrare. Rarely Charcot’s joint condition may be observed.\r\n\r\n  Of the facial muscles the orbicularis palpebrarum is most apt to\r\n  show paralysis. The eyes are affected much less frequently in nerve\r\n  leprosy than nodular, 45% as against 85% for nodular leprosy. The\r\n  most common changes in nerve leprosy are ectropion of the lower lid\r\n  and subsequent corneal ulceration.\r\n\r\n  =Mixed Leprosy.=—In mixed leprosy we simply have a combination of\r\n  the manifestations of the two main types and as a matter of fact\r\n  the majority of cases tend eventually to assume a mixed type.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS IN DETAIL\r\n\r\n  _Temperature Course._—On the whole leprosy runs an afebrile\r\n  course except for the accessions of irregular fever at the time\r\n  of the appearance of the successive crops of spots. This leprotic\r\n  fever lasts for a few days or a week or so and then the course\r\n  becomes afebrile. At such times sweating may be present and suggest\r\n  malaria. In the final stages of leprosy the patient may run a high\r\n  fever for long periods, associated with profuse sweating and loss\r\n  of weight.\r\n\r\n  _Skin._—The raised spots of nodular leprosy tend to come out in\r\n  numbers on lobes of ears, over eyebrows and on cheeks, as well as\r\n  backs of hands and forearms and on buttocks and feet. Soles of\r\n  feet and palms of hands almost never show spots. In nerve leprosy\r\n  the spots are often single and flat and often appear on parts\r\n  of body covered by the clothing, as trunk, thighs or arms. The\r\n  spots of leprosy are anaesthetic, often showing dissociation of\r\n  sensation. The indurated spots of nodular leprosy are succeeded by\r\n  tubercle-like growths. The hair falls out of the areas occupied by\r\n  the spots.\r\n\r\n  _Mucous Membranes._—The nasal mucosa is in particular studded with\r\n  nodules which later undergo ulceration. An ulcer of the septum is\r\n  often the first place from which leprosy bacilli may be obtained.\r\n  The pharynx and larynx are also involved early.\r\n\r\n  _Nervous System._—Besides the characteristic anaesthesia we have\r\n  various manifestations of neuritis, especially involving the ulnar,\r\n  facial and peroneal nerves. The affected nerves show a fusiform\r\n  enlargement and are tender. Later we have trophic changes in\r\n  skin, bone and nails of the fingers and toes. Absorption of bones\r\n  and perforating ulcers are common. Muscle palsies and atrophies,\r\n  especially the main-en-griffe, are common. The orbicularis\r\n  palpebrarum is not infrequently paralyzed. The olfactory, optic\r\n  and auditory nerves are rarely if ever involved. The reflexes are\r\n  slightly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n  Patients often complain of a sensation of cold. Some authorities\r\n  have called attention to the frequency of a mental and moral apathy\r\n  in lepers.\r\n\r\n  _The Circulatory System._—Honeij considers a high pulse rate,\r\n  especially in the morning, as characteristic of progressive stages\r\n  of leprosy.\r\n\r\n  _The Eye._—In nodular leprosy eye lesions, chiefly leprotic\r\n  nodules in conjunctivae or iris, with subsequent ulceration, are\r\n  met with at some time in the course of the disease in almost 90%\r\n  of cases. In nerve leprosy, corneal ulcerations, chiefly resulting\r\n  from paralyses of the facial muscles, with ectropion, give eye\r\n  symptoms in about 45% of cases.\r\n\r\n  _Genito-urinary Symptoms._—Atrophy of the testicles with increase\r\n  of connective tissue often result in males but data would indicate\r\n  that the procreative power of the female is but little diminished.\r\n  Lepers often die of renal complications, the kidney lesions being\r\n  rather those of amyloid change. Bacilli may be eliminated in the\r\n  urine during accessions of fever.\r\n\r\n  _The Lymphatic Glands._—These tend to enlarge and show bacilli,\r\n  but rarely suppurate.\r\n\r\n  The inguinal and cervical glands are most often enlarged.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—The changes, other than those of a secondary anaemia\r\n  as the disease progresses, are not characteristic. Bacilli are\r\n  present in the blood of cases of nodular leprosy quite constantly\r\n  but less so in that of cases of nerve leprosy. The bacilli are more\r\n  apt to be found in the blood at the time of febrile accessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—It must be remembered that leprosy is very\r\nslow in development, so that for months or even years there may be\r\nbut slight indications of the disease, as an anaesthetic spot or the\r\npalsy of an orbicularis palpebrarum. One should always run over the\r\nlobes of the ears or region of the eyebrows to feel for shot-like\r\nnodules.\r\n\r\nIn the making of a diagnosis the information as to possible exposure\r\nto the disease is of first importance.\r\n\r\n  The leprous spots are at first rather oily from increased action\r\n  of the sebaceous glands but subsequently become dry. In ancient\r\n  times the hypersecretion of sebaceous material about the facial\r\n  spots of nodular leprosy served as the basis of a test for leprosy,\r\n  the suspected eruption being dashed with water. If the surface was\r\n  not wetted it was a point in favor of leprosy. Of prime importance\r\n  however is the pin prick for anaesthesia, which is the most\r\n  important distinguishing characteristic, next to the finding of\r\n  the bacilli, for a leprous spot. The anaesthesia is more marked\r\n  in the center of the spot and may show dissociation of sensation.\r\n  It is very important to examine for enlargement of the ulnar or\r\n  great auricular and the earliest signs of a nerve leprosy may be\r\n  anaesthesia and a slight contraction of the ring and little finger.\r\n\r\nOf the general diseases, which may be confused with leprosy, we have\r\nthe circumscribed form of scleroderma. Such spots however are dead\r\nwhite in color and are not anaesthetic. The prodromal manifestations\r\nwith fever and sweatings simulate malaria. Elephantiasis and Madura\r\nfoot have been confused with leprosy but the marked tendency to\r\nlimitation to the lower extremities and absence of anaesthesia should\r\ndifferentiate. Probably the most difficult disease to differentiate\r\nfrom leprosy is syringomyelia. Morvan’s disease is only a form of\r\nsyringomyelia in which the neuralgic pains, anaesthesia of the skin\r\nand painless whitlows, with tissue loss, are features. In fact\r\nZambaco has advanced the idea that Morvan’s disease is leprosy.\r\n\r\n  In syringomyelia the dissociation of sensation is marked, as\r\n  with leprosy. In syringomyelia, however, the upper extremities\r\n  are, as a rule, alone affected and the muscular atrophy is more\r\n  of the scapulohumeral type, with involvement of trunk muscles\r\n  causing scoliosis, than of the thenar and hypothenar eminences, so\r\n  that while the fingers may be more contracted and rigid than in\r\n  leprosy we do not get the main-en-griffe. The anaesthetic areas\r\n  of syringomyelia continue to sweat, and we may also get spastic\r\n  symptoms and speech defects in syringomyelia.\r\n\r\nRaynaud’s disease has also been confused with leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Of the skin diseases the most important confusing lesions are\r\n  the cutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis and syphilis. In\r\n  lupus the tubercles are very much smaller, show the apple jelly\r\n  appearance, the lesion spreads peripherally, is rather purplish and\r\n  is not anaesthetic. Syphilitic ulcerations are more punched out,\r\n  do not affect the same sites and respond to syphilitic treatment\r\n  immediately. You do not find nerve enlargements in syphilis.\r\n\r\nThere is great lack of agreement as to the frequency of the\r\nWassermann reaction in leprosy, some reporting a positive test\r\nas common in nodular leprosy while others have reported negative\r\nfindings where there was not ground for suspecting syphilis. Nerve\r\nleprosy does not often give a positive test.\r\n\r\n  Fletcher obtained 22% positives in 100 cases of leprosy—28% in\r\n  nodular and 17% in nerve cases. One-third of the cases gave a\r\n  history of syphilis.\r\n\r\n  Sutherland and Mitra obtained 17 positive Wassermann reactions\r\n  in 34 nodular cases, 16 positives in 52 anaesthetic cases and 8\r\n  positives in 14 cases of mixed leprosy. The sera of 12 children of\r\n  leprous parents were negative.\r\n\r\n  The luetin reaction is negative in leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Mycosis fungoides has not the characteristic location about the\r\n  face and itches markedly and does not show anaesthesia.\r\n\r\n  Vitiligo shows an abrupt margin and is not anaesthetic.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—The usual procedure is to scrape a spot\r\nor nodule with a scalpel until the epidermis has been gone through\r\nand then smear out the serous exudate on a slide and stain by the\r\nZiehl-Neelsen acid-fast method or by Gram’s stain. Twenty per\r\ncent. sulphuric acid is less apt to decolorize than the 3% acid\r\nalcohol, the leprosy bacilli being less resistant to acid alcohol\r\ndecolorization than to aqueous acid solutions. There is a great\r\nvariation in the resistance to decolorization of leprosy bacilli,\r\na preparation from one case holding its color almost as well as\r\ntubercle bacilli, while material from another case may decolorize\r\nvery easily.\r\n\r\n  I am partial to Tschernogabow’s technique. In this, one punctures\r\n  the subepithelial granulomatous tissue with a capillary pipette,\r\n  the end of which has been broken off by tapping the point in order\r\n  to give a cutting point, and the serum which exudes is smeared out\r\n  and stained.\r\n\r\n  Some prefer emulsifying a piece of the tissue and centrifuging and\r\n  staining the sediment. Quite recently the antiformin method of\r\n  treating leprous tissue, as for tuberculous tissue, has been used.\r\n\r\n  Many insist that the best method is to cut out small sections of\r\n  the lesion, going well into normal tissue, and putting through\r\n  paraffin and cutting thin sections and staining. Gram’s method,\r\n  counterstaining with bismarck brown, gives beautiful preparations.\r\n  For acid-fast staining first stain with haematoxylin to obtain\r\n  a histological background and then steam with carbol fuchsin,\r\n  decolorize very briefly with acid alcohol, then through absolute\r\n  alcohol and xylol.\r\n\r\nOf the greatest diagnostic value is the staining of the nasal mucus\r\nor scrapings from ulcerations on nasal septum for leprosy bacilli.\r\nThese are often found in the characteristic cigar package bundles or\r\nengulfed in lepra cells. A standard procedure is to give 60 grains of\r\niodide of potash to cause a drug coryza, in the secretions of which\r\nleprosy bacilli may be found. However, one will have better success\r\nif the nasal secretion be obtained at a time when a natural coryza\r\nexists.\r\n\r\n  Thibault examined the nasal mucus, gland juice and blood of 30\r\n  lepers. He obtained leprosy bacilli in the nasal mucus of 20, in\r\n  the gland puncture juice of 18, and in the blood of 7.\r\n\r\n  Hollman detected leprosy bacilli in the nasal mucus of 90% of 58\r\n  nodular cases, of 67% of 6 mixed leprosy and of 45% of anaesthetic\r\n  cases, after making 329 examinations.\r\n\r\n  Leprosy bacilli are apt to be found in the blood of nodular cases,\r\n  especially at the time of the febrile accessions. The blood is\r\n  best taken in 5 or 10 cc. quantities into 1% sodium citrate in\r\n  distilled water. After centrifuging, the sediment is treated with\r\n  10% antiformin, at 37°C. for one hour. Again centrifuging, and\r\n  washing, the sediment is smeared out on a slide and stained. The\r\n  bacilli are not apt to be found in the blood of cases of nerve\r\n  leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Smith and Rivas add 10 vols. of 2% acetic acid to 1 vol. blood,\r\n  centrifuge and make smears.\r\n\r\n  Gland puncture has recently been considered as an important\r\n  diagnostic procedure in leprosy.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that while the finding of leprosy bacilli\r\nis usually very easy in the nodules of nodular leprosy it is a\r\npainstaking and discouraging procedure with the spots of nerve\r\nleprosy. Even the affected nerves, at autopsy, often fail to show\r\nbacilli. For nerve leprosy the examination of nasal mucus is of prime\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n  The _Roentgen ray_ has been utilized in the recognition of the very\r\n  early, trophic changes in bone, showing the commencing absorption\r\n  of phalanges. Neve has reported a case in which there were no\r\n  satisfactory indications of leprosy other than slight deformity of\r\n  toes and fingers but showing marked changes in the phalanges, even\r\n  to disappearance of terminal phalanx of some toes when examined\r\n  with X-ray.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe progress of the disease is so slow that it is difficult to\r\nestimate improvement or cure. At present the possibility of a cure,\r\nwith the new methods of treatment, is encouraging. There is no doubt\r\nbut that many of the reported cures have simply been instances of\r\nremissions in the course of the disease for periods covering months\r\nor even three or four years. It would seem that the earlier treatment\r\nis instituted the greater the possibility of cure. There were 38\r\ncases officially reported as cured, in Norway, from 1881 to 1885.\r\n\r\n  Nodular leprosy runs its course much more quickly than does nerve\r\n  leprosy. It is in nodular leprosy particularly that intercurrent\r\n  affections carry off the patients. Tuberculosis carries off about\r\n  23% of cases and nephritis almost 30%, while a combination of\r\n  tuberculosis and renal disease about 10%. In the remainder, the\r\n  cachexia or accidents of leprosy itself are responsible for a\r\n  large portion of the deaths. Cases of nodular leprosy are more\r\n  often carried off by kidney disease than those with nerve or mixed\r\n  leprosy.\r\n\r\n  It must not be forgotten that lepers, especially those with the\r\n  nerve form, may live for twenty to forty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—As was noted under epidemiology there seems to\r\nbe little evidence to show that insects play any part in the\r\ntransmission of leprosy. Nevertheless it would seem advisable\r\nto prevent flies from becoming contaminated with the discharges\r\nfrom leprous ulcerations which so often teem with leprosy bacilli.\r\nThis possible method of transmission would seem more deserving of\r\nattention than the question of the taking up of bacilli from the\r\nblood by mosquitoes, bedbugs or biting flies, as the leprosy bacilli\r\nare found in the blood of nodular leprosy chiefly during the febrile\r\naccessions and very rarely in the blood of cases of nerve leprosy. In\r\nall of the ordinary insects the bacilli seem to disappear in a very\r\nshort time, with the exception of the cockroach, for which reason it\r\nwould seem advisable to destroy these pests, which can be easily done\r\nby sprinkling around a little sodium fluoride.\r\n\r\n  There is some evidence that scabies favours infection so that this\r\n  disease should be looked for and actively treated in endemic areas.\r\n\r\n  Leprosy tends to spread where there is marked personal\r\n  uncleanliness and close contact with lepers in overcrowded\r\n  quarters. Many authorities consider the free use of soap and water\r\n  the most important means of avoiding infection. While segregation\r\n  is generally considered the one proven prophylactic measure there\r\n  are those who question its value. There does not seem to have been\r\n  any very marked influence on the spread of leprosy among the native\r\n  Hawaiians through the enforcement of isolation of such cases.\r\n  Partial segregation at their homes has given very satisfactory\r\n  results. Where a leper is not excreting bacilli, or where acid-fast\r\n  organisms cannot be found after careful search there is no danger.\r\n  Such patients, however, should report for examination every few\r\n  months. Evidence as to contact indicates that all young children\r\n  are particularly liable to the infection, as has been noted for\r\n  children of lepers and brothers and sisters. Even if segregation\r\n  of lepers is not carried out as regards adults, it should be the\r\n  rule for children, so that infants and young children should be\r\n  separated from their leper parents or parent. A very remarkable\r\n  feature in connection with leprosy is the hysterical dread that\r\n  many communities have of a leper, when they must know or could\r\n  easily learn, that the contagiousness of the affection is so\r\n  slight, that notwithstanding our efforts, we can scarcely point to\r\n  a single instance to prove undoubted transmission of the disease\r\n  from one person to another. At any rate knowing that immense\r\n  numbers of the bacilli are given off from ulcerations and the nose,\r\n  we should guard against the dissemination of leprosy bacilli from\r\n  such sources.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—Many so-called specific products, whether of the nature\r\nof extractives, as leprolin or nastin, or of bacterial vaccines, have\r\nbeen tried with results which have not tended to gain the confidence\r\nof conservative men. The product which has been given most general\r\ntrial is nastin. This is a neutral fat, extracted from a streptothrix\r\ngrowth, obtained by Deycke from leprous nodules. It is combined\r\nwith benzoyl chloride and is contained in ampoules containing from\r\none-half to one-fifth of a milligram.\r\n\r\n  Wise and Minett treated 244 cases with nastin for periods of from\r\n  one to two years, the treatment having been at first supervised by\r\n  Deycke himself. It was stated that nodular cases did not seem to be\r\n  improved and that anaesthetic leprosy was not apparently influenced.\r\n\r\n  Minett mentions the efficiency of a 2½% solution of benzoyl\r\n  chloride as a nasal spray and as an application to leprous ulcers,\r\n  this treatment causing the bacilli rapidly to disappear from the\r\n  discharges of nose or ulcers. On the other hand Scott, in Assam,\r\n  reports practically 50% of cures, or cases greatly improved, in\r\n  patients treated with nastin for a year or more. He gave nastin B1\r\n  injected intramuscularly at two weeks intervals.\r\n\r\n  Salvarsan does not seem to have been of any value in leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe standard treatment for leprosy is chaulmoogra oil given\r\ninternally, in capsules, in doses of 5 to 10 minims increased\r\ngradually, according to stomach tolerance, to 40 to 60 minims.\r\n\r\n  For hypodermic use Heiser makes a mixture of 60 cc. each of\r\n  chaulmoogra oil and camphorated oil with 4 grams resorcin.\r\n  Injections are made weekly, commencing with 1 cc. This dose is\r\n  increased steadily according to tolerance, but in some patients\r\n  marked reaction in the lesions, with fever, occurs after a dose of\r\n  only a few cubic centimeters has been reached.\r\n\r\n  Rogers has for some time been giving subcutaneous injections of\r\n  sodium gynocardate, the sodium salt of the lower melting-point\r\n  fatty acids of chaulmoogra oil. Finding that large doses of sodium\r\n  gynocardate could be administered to animals with safety he has\r\n  recently given intravenous injections and has substituted this\r\n  method for the subcutaneous one. For use in the treatment of\r\n  leprosy he prepares a 2 or 3% solution in distilled water and,\r\n  after sterilization in an autoclave, adds ½ per cent. carbolic\r\n  acid. The solution should be quite clear. He starts with one-tenth\r\n  of a grain and increases the dosage by one-tenth with each\r\n  successive injection up to four-fifths of a grain. He states that\r\n  this method has as great superiority over the subcutaneous one\r\n  as that has over the administration of chaulmoogra oil by mouth.\r\n  Rogers now uses a solution of 3% sod. gynocardate with 1% phenol\r\n  and 1% sod. citrate. At first the intravenous injection is with 0.5\r\n  cc. thrice weekly, which dose is gradually increased up to as much\r\n  as 5 cc.\r\n\r\n  It is possible that sodium morrhuate (cod-liver oil) may be as\r\n  efficacious as the gynocardate salt. Rogers has used _Hydnocarpus_\r\n  instead of the true chaulmoogra oil and thought he obtained better\r\n  results. One explanation of the uncertainty of success with\r\n  chaulmoogra oil is the difficulty of securing oil obtained from\r\n  proper sources. The standard treatment of leprosy in Honolulu, as\r\n  reported by McDonald, is the weekly injection of the ethyl esters\r\n  of the entire fatty acids of the whole chaulmoogra oil, with 2% by\r\n  weight of iodine, chemically combined. The treatment begins with 1\r\n  cc. injected intramuscularly, increased by 1 cc. at every second\r\n  or third injection, until a dose of from 2 to 6 cc. is reached,\r\n  according to age and weight of patient.\r\n\r\n  For internal use the mixed fatty acids, carrying 2½% iodine,\r\n  chemically combined, are given in capsule. The dose by mouth is\r\n  0.25 grams per 100 lbs. weight, three times daily, an hour or two\r\n  after meals. This is gradually increased every two weeks until a\r\n  maximum dose of 1 gm. per 100 lbs. weight is reached.\r\n\r\n  Dyer combines hydrotherapy with the administration of chaulmoogra\r\n  oil. He gives a daily bath as hot as can be borne, and, in addition\r\n  to the specific treatment, gives 1/60th grain of strychnine three\r\n  times daily.\r\n\r\nAntileprol, a preparation of chaulmoogra oil, which is more\r\nsatisfactory than oil, may be given in doses approximating 120 grains\r\nby mouth daily or 60 grains subcutaneously. Such drugs as arsenic\r\nsalicylate of soda and bichloride of mercury have been used.\r\n\r\n  Thyroid extract has seemed to benefit cases of anaesthetic leprosy\r\n  in rare instances. The high frequency current with the needle\r\n  applied to the nodular lesions has been recommended by Unna. Radium\r\n  and X-rays have also been employed. There have been reports as to\r\n  the value of the antimony treatment in leprosy.\r\n\r\nLeprosy is a disease in which improvement often occurs when the\r\npatient is placed under more favorable conditions as to food,\r\nclimate, etc. Again, there is at times a tendency for the disease to\r\nabort or ameliorate without relation to treatment or environment.\r\n\r\n  Surgical treatment is frequently of use, as nerve stretching for\r\n  the leprous neuralgias. Various eye operations are necessitated\r\n  by the ectropion or leprotic iritis. The amputations of the area\r\n  involved in perforating ulcer is recommended. Tracheotomy is often\r\n  demanded for the laryngeal stenosis.\r\n\r\n  McCoy has combined carbon dioxide snow local treatment with\r\n  chaulmoogra oil. The lesions showed decrease in size but remained\r\n  bacteriologically positive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III\r\n\r\nFOOD DEFICIENCY DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nBERIBERI\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Beriberi is a food deficiency disease due to the\r\nabsence from the dietary of a neuritis-preventing vitamine. It is\r\nparticularly important among the people of the Orient whose diet\r\nis preponderatingly one of rice. In milling the grain the outer\r\nvitamine-containing layers are rubbed off and this polished rice,\r\nwhen the chief constituent of a dietary, is capable of causing, after\r\na period of two or three months, a peripheral neuritis.\r\n\r\nThis neuritis not only involves the nerves of the extremities but,\r\nas well, the pneumogastric, and it is the manifestation of cardiac\r\ndisturbances which best differentiate this form of neuritis from\r\nthose due to alcohol or arsenic.\r\n\r\nThe disease is usually described under two types: (1) a wet or\r\ndropsical beriberi, in which the vasomotor nerves are affected with\r\nresultant general oedema and (2) a dry atrophic or paraplegic type,\r\nin which muscular palsies and atrophies are the leading features.\r\nPathologically, we have a Wallerian degeneration of the peripheral\r\nnerves with possibly axonal degeneration of the cells of the neuron\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Neuritis Multiplex Endemica, Polyneuritis Endemica,\r\nHydrops Asthmaticus. Japanese: Kakke.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—While modern knowledge of beriberi may be said to\r\n  date from the writings of Bontius, in 1642, yet the disease is\r\n  distinctly described by Chinese writers of the seventh century and\r\n  treated in writings of the second century and possibly referred\r\n  to in writings as ancient as B. C. 2697. It is probable that the\r\n  disease described by Strabo as occurring in a Roman army while\r\n  invading Arabia, in 24 B. C., was beriberi. While mention of the\r\n  disease may be found in Japanese writings of the ninth century it\r\n  is thought by Scheube that this relates to the disease in China and\r\n  that beriberi first appeared in Japan about the eighteenth century.\r\n  Bontius described the atrophic form of the disease, Rogers, in\r\n  1808, the serous effusions, and Marshall, in 1812, noted two types,\r\n  barbiers, when the paralysis predominated, and beriberi, when the\r\n  dyspnoea and oedema were leading features.\r\n\r\n  In 1835 Malcolmson noted that cases of beriberi assumed the type of\r\n  barbiers and vice versa, from this time the view has obtained that\r\n  the two affections belong to one disease.\r\n\r\n  The disease seems to have first made its appearance in Brazil in\r\n  1866.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—Geographical distribution of Beriberi.]\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Reference to the chart will show\r\n  3 markedly endemic centers for beriberi, one embracing Japan, a\r\n  second the Dutch East Indies (Java, Borneo, Sumatra), and a third,\r\n  involving the Eastern coast of Brazil. In somewhat less degree the\r\n  disease prevails in India, Indo-China, Malay Peninsula, Eastern\r\n  China, and the Philippine Islands. It is also found in the regions\r\n  of the East and West Coasts of Africa, and was devastating to the\r\n  laborers on the Congo railway. It has been reported from many parts\r\n  of the world among coolies from Asiatic countries. A disease of\r\n  similar nature has been noted in asylums in England and America.\r\n  Beriberi occurred among the British soldiers in Mesopotamia during\r\n  the recent war—more than 300 cases in 1915. It is interesting\r\n  to note that scurvy, and not beriberi, occurred among the Indian\r\n  troops in Mesopotamia at this time. There was no scurvy in the\r\n  British troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—There is probably no disease about which there exist so\r\nmany views as to etiology as with beriberi. Many of those formerly\r\nadvanced are so negatived by recent investigations that it would\r\nseem hardly worth while to mention them. While the cause is still\r\nunsolved attention is at present almost exclusively directed to some\r\ndeficiency of a neuritis-preventing substance in the dietary and\r\nsuch studies have in large part centered about the question of such\r\ndeficiencies in certain kinds of rice.\r\n\r\nReserving until the last the discussion of the rice theories we may\r\nbriefly dismiss such views as those assigning bacterial or protozoal\r\ncauses with the exception of those of Manson and Hamilton Wright.\r\n\r\n  _Manson’s Theory._—Under conditions of overcrowding, filth,\r\n  warmth, moisture and lack of ventilation, as would obtain in the\r\n  forecastle of a ship carrying a native crew, the development of a\r\n  hypothetical germ is favored. This germ in its growth gives off\r\n  emanations which like alcohol act as toxins upon the peripheral\r\n  nerves. The germ itself does not infect the patient.\r\n\r\n  _Wright’s Theory._—According to this view a bacillus which was\r\n  given off in the faeces was ingested and locating in the duodenal\r\n  mucosa gave off a toxin similar to that of the diphtheria bacillus.\r\n  Instead of developing its soluble toxin in the membrane of the\r\n  region of the throat this action took place in the upper part of\r\n  the small intestines.\r\n\r\n  Of the bacterial causes may be mentioned: (1) The coccus of\r\n  Pekelharing and Winckler. This organism was supposed to be short\r\n  lived in the body and repeated infections were necessary to produce\r\n  the disease.\r\n\r\n  (2) Dangerfield held views somewhat similar to those of Pekelharing\r\n  and thought a coccus in the alimentary canal the cause.\r\n\r\n  (3) Isuzuki regarded a coccus isolated from the urine as the cause.\r\n\r\n  (4) Okata and Kokubo thought a coccus obtained from the blood to be\r\n  the infecting agent.\r\n\r\n  Various bacilli, other than that incriminated by Wright, have been\r\n  brought forward as pathogenic agents but it may be stated without\r\n  further discussion that the claims of the advocates of bacterial\r\n  causes have not been verified and are solely of historical\r\n  interest. The same statement will hold for the plasmodium-like\r\n  protozoon of Glogner which was found in the splenic blood.\r\n\r\n  _Of the chemical theories_ may be mentioned; (1) Arsenic poisoning.\r\n  In an outbreak of arsenical neuritis in England, from arsenic\r\n  contained in the glucose used in making beer, Ross diagnosed the\r\n  illness as beriberi. Subsequently, arsenic was found in the hair of\r\n  certain patients with beriberi, hence the theory which has never\r\n  been substantiated. It may be stated that a careful study of this\r\n  epidemic by Reynolds and Bury indicated that the alcoholic factor\r\n  was also operative as persons taking an equal amount of arsenic but\r\n  without alcohol, did not develop neuritis.\r\n\r\n  (2) Treutlein’s oxalate theory.—This was based on the fact that\r\n  polyneuritis gallinarum could be produced in fowls by feeding them\r\n  oxalic acid.\r\n\r\n_Of the food deficiency theories_, the most prominent is (1) that\r\nof Takaki, generally designated the _nitrogen deficiency_ theory.\r\nAs the result of increasing the proteid constituents of the ration\r\nof the Japanese Navy from 109 to 196 grams, the disease was largely\r\neliminated (from about 32% incidence to less than 0.5%).\r\n\r\n  In the old ration the ratio of N to C was as 1 to 17—32, in the\r\n  new ration, 1—16. In looking over the constituents of the new\r\n  ration the addition of about 100 grams of beans is noted. These are\r\n  rich in vitamines.\r\n\r\n  (2) According to Fales the hypothetical germ of beriberi can only\r\n  live in body fluids deficient in potassium carbonate. The high\r\n  content of potash in potatoes made him greatly increase the amount\r\n  of this vegetable in the dietary he recommended. Fales noted scurvy\r\n  as well as beriberi in the Bilibid prisoners on a diet deficient in\r\n  potash.\r\n\r\n  (3) Deficient fat. (4) Deficient phosphorus.—It was Schaumann’s\r\n  idea that the phosphorus contained in the outer layers of the rice\r\n  grain was essential in the prevention of beriberi. While it is\r\n  now known that the beriberi-preventing substance does not contain\r\n  phosphorus, yet the idea has proven of practical value as giving an\r\n  index of beriberi-producing power of rice.\r\n\r\n_P_{2}O_{5} Index of Beriberi-producing Rice._—If a rice contain\r\nunder 0.4% of phosphorus pentoxide it is liable to produce beriberi.\r\n\r\n  Schaumann now considers that the antineuritic substance in rice\r\n  polishings acts as an activator in the metabolism of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n_Vitamine Deficiency._—Grijns was the first to insist that beriberi\r\nwas due to the absence in the diet of some substance essential to\r\nproper metabolism of the peripheral nerves. His views were along the\r\nline of our present _vitamine deficiency ones_. There are undoubtedly\r\nmany different vitamines, varying as to nature of protective\r\npower, temperature at which destroyed, solubility, etc. McCollum\r\nemphasizes the importance of a fat soluble A and a water and alcohol\r\nsoluble substance B for proper metabolism. This latter, usually\r\ndesignated “Water soluble B,” is generally considered the same as the\r\nanti-neuritis vitamine but there is recent evidence that this may not\r\nbe the case. The antiscorbutic vitamine is water soluble C.\r\n\r\n  _Food Poisoning as Cause._—There are other theories as to\r\n  intestinal parasites causing the disease and in particular views as\r\n  to relation of fish eating to the disease, which are (1) that it is\r\n  caused by the ingestion of raw fish, or again (2) from the eating\r\n  of certain poisonous fish.\r\n\r\n  Miura, who is the great advocate of a fish intoxication, believes\r\n  that this comes about from eating fish belonging to the Scomberidae\r\n  family. As proving this, he cites the absence of beriberi in\r\n  prisons in Japan, where no fish is allowed. He does not recognize\r\n  that it is the diet of barley 6 to rice 4 parts which is the\r\n  prophylactic factor. Barley is rich in vitamines.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE AND BERIBERI\r\n\r\n  There are a few points in connection with rice which should be\r\n  understood. The larger part of the rice grain is starch and\r\n  covering this central starch core we have the rather thin aleurone\r\n  layer containing the proteid and fat constituents of the grain.\r\n  Externally there is an adherent layer, the pericarp, which varies\r\n  in color from red to white according to the kind of rice. The\r\n  pericarp contains the salts. The grain is covered by the husk which\r\n  is always removed to render the rice suitable for food. Unhusked\r\n  rice is called _padi_ in India and _palay_ in the Philippines. In\r\n  the process of removing the husk (milling) the pericarp and more or\r\n  less of the aleurone layer may be rubbed off the grain. When the\r\n  milling process is carried to the extent that but little remains\r\n  except the starch the rice is termed _polished_, _highly milled_,\r\n  or _white_ rice. A process of parboiling causes the husk to be more\r\n  easily detached and the pericarp to adhere more firmly to the grain\r\n  and when milled there is less loss of the anti-neuritis principle,\r\n  which is contained in the outer layers. Such rice is called\r\n  _cured_ rice. The embryo also contains the anti-neuritis vitamine\r\n  as well as the fat soluble A one. It is also lost in milling. The\r\n  scale-like dust is termed _rice polishings_ and has curative value\r\n  for those who have developed beriberi under a diet of polished\r\n  rice. When the milling process is less complete the rice so treated\r\n  is called _undermilled_ rice or _red_ rice. Polished, highly milled\r\n  or white rice contains as a rule less than 0.4% of phosphorus\r\n  pentoxide while the beriberi-preventing rices contain more than\r\n  0.4% of this compound for which reason legislation has required\r\n  rice to have more than 0.4% phosphorus pentoxide.\r\n\r\n  Siam rice is a polished white rice which contains about 0.25%\r\n  phosphorus pentoxide and has more often been associated with severe\r\n  outbreaks of beriberi than Rangoon rice, which has about 0.32%,\r\n  this latter, however, being a well-recognized beriberi-producing\r\n  rice. Unpolished rice contains about 0.55% of phosphorus pentoxide.\r\n  Natives generally prefer the polished rice because it is clean and\r\n  free from weevils, while the undermilled kind is dirty. Parboiled\r\n  rice has a disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\n  Voegtlin has recommended a P_{2}O_{5} requirement of 0.5% for corn\r\n  products and 1% for wheat ones. Thus whole wheat contained 1.12%\r\n  while highly milled flour had only 0.114%. Fowls fed on this flour\r\n  developed polyneuritis in twenty to thirty-two days.\r\n\r\n  Whole corn contains 0.76% P_{2}O_{5}, while highly milled corn\r\n  grits has approximately 0.2%, and highly milled corn meal about\r\n  0.3%. These highly milled corn products produced polyneuritis\r\n  within from thirty to thirty-five days.\r\n\r\n  With rock ground corn meal, containing 0.7% P_{2}O_{5} the fowls\r\n  remained well.\r\n\r\n_Experiment of Fraser and Stanton._—While there have been numerous\r\ninstances reported to show the connection between polished rice and\r\nberiberi, when such rice was the predominating article of diet, it\r\nwill suffice to refer to the experiments of Fraser and Stanton and of\r\nStrong.\r\n\r\n  In 1909, Fraser and Stanton experimented with 493 Javanese coolies\r\n  who were employed in building a road far removed from any village\r\n  which might introduce the factor of bacterial etiology into the\r\n  problem. They noted that the Javanese prefer white rice, and\r\n  reference is made to the fact that many cases of beriberi occurred\r\n  among these laborers in 1906, which outbreak ceased upon requiring\r\n  them to eat parboiled rice at the suggestion of Doctor Braddon.\r\n  They state that they informed the coolies of the danger of white\r\n  rice but, notwithstanding, they all expressed a preference for the\r\n  white rice over parboiled rice. For the purpose of comparison, only\r\n  one-half were allowed the white rice diet. The two parties were\r\n  quartered in virgin jungle and were isolated from each other by an\r\n  interval of 7 miles. Of 220 individuals on white rice there were 20\r\n  cases of beriberi recorded while among 273, who lived on parboiled\r\n  rice, no cases occurred.\r\n\r\n_Prolonged Continuation of Faulty Diet Necessary._—It appeared that\r\na considerable period of continuance of white rice diet was necessary\r\nbefore the appearance of the disease (eighty-seven days). As against\r\nthe infectious nature of the disease they note that contact of\r\npersons on a parboiled rice diet with the beriberi cases was without\r\nresult. Substitution of parboiled rice for white rice brought about a\r\ncessation of the outbreak.\r\n\r\n  The Philippine scouts, numbering about 5000 natives, gave 618 cases\r\n  of beriberi in 1908 and 550 cases in 1909. In 1910 undermilled rice\r\n  was substituted for polished rice and they were required to eat 1-6\r\n  oz. beans daily. No other change in their mode of living was made.\r\n  By 1913 beriberi had disappeared among them, although the disease\r\n  still prevailed among the native population in contact with them.\r\n\r\n_Experiment of Strong and Crowell._—Strong and Crowell stated that\r\nthe object of their study was to determine whether beriberi, as it\r\noccurs in the Philippines, is an infectious disease or whether it is\r\none which has its origin in disturbances of metabolism, due chiefly\r\nto the prolonged use of polished rice as a staple article of diet.\r\n\r\n  The experiments were carried out in Bilibid prison. Prisoners, who\r\n  had been condemned to death, were informed of the nature of the\r\n  experiment and were told of the diet on which it was proposed to\r\n  place them. They were also told that they might contract beriberi.\r\n  Twenty-nine volunteered and each signed a statement in his own\r\n  dialect that he undertook the experiment voluntarily.\r\n\r\n  In general, the groups were fed for the greater part of the time\r\n  occupied by the experiments as follows: Group (1) “White rice and\r\n  extract of rice polishings and special diet.” Group (2) “White rice\r\n  and special diet.” Group (3) “Red rice and special diet.” Group (4)\r\n  “White rice and special diet.”\r\n\r\n  Of 6 men on the Group 1 diet, 2 developed beriberi. The symptoms\r\n  however, were not marked, being chiefly loss of weight,\r\n  tachycardia, slight oedema of legs and tenderness of muscles of\r\n  calves. Four of the 6 men of Group 2 developed beriberi and 6 out\r\n  of 11, in Group 4, showed symptoms of beriberi. In Group 3, only 2\r\n  in 6 developed symptoms and these consisted in case No. 13 only in\r\n  tenderness of epigastrium, paraesthesia, cardiac disturbance and\r\n  marked diminution of knee jerk. In case No. 18 there was noted only\r\n  slight cardiac disturbance and epigastric pulsation. In none of\r\n  the cases was the complete picture of beriberi obtained except in\r\n  those in which the white polished rice formed the staple article of\r\n  diet, but in one case, fed on red rice, the diagnosis of beriberi\r\n  was almost definite.\r\n\r\nThe results of their experiments with the addition of rice polishings\r\nto the diet would indicate that whatever may be the results obtained\r\nwith extracts from this material in preventing polyneuritis of fowls\r\nor in curing it after it has developed it is not as efficient in man\r\nas the cheaper and more readily obtainable mongo or katjangidjo bean\r\nor yeast.\r\n\r\n  Evidently symptoms of beriberi may also sometimes occur in\r\n  individuals fed on red rice as a staple article of diet when the\r\n  diet is very monotonous, comprising few articles and continued\r\n  for long periods of time. From the experiments it is evident that\r\n  beriberi may be produced by the prolonged consumption of white rice\r\n  as a staple diet. Of 17 individuals fed on such diet 8 developed\r\n  beriberi, all with distinct loss of knee jerk, as well as with\r\n  other marked symptoms of the disease. Symptoms appeared within 61\r\n  to 75 days after the commencement of the diet.\r\n\r\n  Vedder thinks that the red rice used in these experiments may not\r\n  have been sufficiently undermilled, as it was found most difficult\r\n  to obtain such a beriberi-preventing rice for the Philippine\r\n  scouts. As regards the lack of success with extract of rice\r\n  polishings the same author considers that a sufficient amount of\r\n  alcohol for the extraction of the vitamines was not used in the\r\n  above experiments, as he found it necessary to use 30 litres of\r\n  alcohol to 5 kilos of rice polishings. Strong and Crowell used only\r\n  14 litres of 95% alcohol to 5 kilos of polishings.\r\n\r\n  _Braddon’s views._—Prior to the investigations of Fraser and\r\n  Stanton the importance of the rice factor in the etiology of\r\n  beriberi was insisted upon by Braddon who thought that a poison\r\n  was elaborated by some organism which poison was contained in the\r\n  beriberi-producing rice. This development was thought to occur\r\n  in rice stored in damp places, but Vedder has shown that storing\r\n  undermilled rice in a damp place for a year does not cause it to\r\n  lose its anti-beriberi-producing properties.\r\n\r\n_Endocrine Gland Disturbances and Beriberi._—We owe in particular\r\nto the researches of McCarrison our appreciation of the important\r\nrôle of the endocrine glands in deficiency diseases. With dietaries\r\ndeficient in vitamines he noted in birds and other animals\r\nhypertrophy of the adrenals, atrophy of the thyroid, thymus,\r\ntesticles and ovary. The pituitary was unaffected. Vitamine\r\ndeficiency seems to impair the activity of the thyroid and to thus\r\nfavor the action of products of intestinal bacteria. It is now\r\naccepted as important this secondary factor of bacterial infection\r\nin all types of food deficiency pathology. Dietaries rich in fats\r\nand proteins with sufficiency of vitamines bring about thyroid\r\nhyperplasia. In a diet too rich in carbohydrates and deficient in\r\nvitamines marked endocrine disturbances are noted.\r\n\r\nThe adrenals show hypertrophy on a vitamine-deficient diet and this\r\nhypertrophy is associated with increase of the adrenalin content of\r\nthe glands. Oedema seems to be associated with adrenal hypertrophy.\r\nMcCarrison believes the oedema to be associated with increased\r\nintracapillary pressure from the effect of adrenalin but others\r\ndispute the explanation. The adrenalin content of the enlarged\r\nadrenals varies; it is in excess with a diet rich in carbohydrates\r\nand deficient in proteins and vitamines, but is below normal when the\r\ndiet is scurvy-producing. Butter, probably from its fat soluble A\r\ncontent, seems to protect against oedema.\r\n\r\n_Polyneuritis gallinarum._—The work of Eijkman in showing that\r\npolyneuritis could be produced in fowls by feeding them on polished\r\nrice and prevented when a diet of rice polishings was added to\r\nthe neuritis-producing rice opened the way for a vast amount of\r\nexperimental work. As regards the nature of the neuritis-preventing\r\nsubstance in the rice polishings it was soon found that it had no\r\nrelation to the phosphorus content. Funk has isolated a substance he\r\ncalls _vitamine_, a pyramidine base precipitated by phosphotungstic\r\nacid, which is present in rice polishings and seems to possess\r\nextraordinary curative properties in polyneuritis gallinarum. Heart\r\nmuscle, egg yolk and yeast are rich in this anti-neuritis substance,\r\nwhich is also present in lentils and barley.\r\n\r\n_Various Vitamines._—The anti-neuritis vitamine is soluble in\r\nwater and alcohol and is comparatively thermostable (destroyed by\r\na temperature of 120°C. in two hours). It is affected by alkaline\r\nreaction but is stable in acid solution. The water soluble B vitamine\r\ndoes not seem to be destroyed by a temperature of 120°C. for two\r\nhours, hence it may be different from the anti-neuritis one. The\r\nantiscorbutic vitamines differ in being thermolabile, these factors\r\nin certain foods being destroyed by a temperature of 60°C. Another\r\nvitamine, fat soluble A, found particularly in butter, seed embryos\r\nand leaves of plants, is a food essential. Its absence from a diet\r\ncauses xerophthalmia. Cod-liver oil and glandular organs of animals\r\ncontain it.\r\n\r\n  Schaumann considers malt as richer in the anti-neuritis vitamine\r\n  than any other article of diet, rice bran coming next. Many think\r\n  that vitamines have not as yet been separated but that they are\r\n  intimately combined with some mother substance in the food.\r\n\r\nThere is, in all probability, a large number of vitamines present\r\nin various animal and vegetable foods, the deficiency of which in a\r\ndiet may lead to vague disorders or to well-recognized diseases,\r\nsuch as scurvy, ship beriberi, beriberi or pellagra.\r\n\r\nSchaumann considers the curative principle to be of the nature of\r\nan activator. An increase in the ingestion of carbohydrates and\r\nnecessarily in the vitamine as well seems to produce neuritis more\r\nrapidly than where a smaller amount is given, this indicating the\r\nimportance of these vitamines in carbohydrate metabolism.\r\n\r\nThere are those who deny this carbohydrate metabolism function of\r\nvitamines and it is a fact that polyneuritis of fowls will develop on\r\na diet from which carbohydrates are excluded.\r\n\r\n  In epidemics of beriberi it has been observed that those who eat\r\n  most rice are more often attacked, thus men more frequently than\r\n  women. A temperature of 120°C. destroys the vitamine. Owing to the\r\n  absence of rice as a constituent of other than slightest importance\r\n  in the dietary of Brazilian cases of beriberi, as well as from\r\n  numerous reports of the occurrence of the disease in nonrice-eating\r\n  persons, the view that is now entertained is that not only polished\r\n  rice, but any predominating carbohydrate article of diet, which\r\n  is deficient in the neuritis-preventing substance, can produce\r\n  beriberi. Wellman and Bass have shown that such articles of diet as\r\n  sago, boiled white potatoes, corn grits and macaroni practically\r\n  parallel polished rice in the production of polyneuritis in fowls.\r\n\r\n  =Predisposing Causes.=—There does not seem to be any racial\r\n  predisposition other than that associated with the more varied\r\n  and the more neuritis-preventing diet of the white race. For the\r\n  same reason beriberi is more prevalent among the poor than among\r\n  the prosperous classes of countries where the disease exists\r\n  extensively.\r\n\r\n  It is customary to consider as predisposing causes bad hygienic\r\n  surroundings, such as occur in jails, camps, etc., as well as\r\n  the influence of warmth and dampness of the atmosphere. Beriberi\r\n  is more common among men than women and affects most commonly\r\n  individuals between 15 and 30 years of age. Physical exhaustion,\r\n  excessive grief, digestive derangements, abuse of alcohol and\r\n  tobacco are considered to have a bearing in the production of\r\n  the beriberi symptoms. Surgical operations may be followed by\r\n  manifestations of the disease.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—Inasmuch as the experiments of Strong force us to\r\nthe conclusion that the disease is not infectious, the study of the\r\nprevention of the disease would appear to rest almost exclusively in\r\nthe question of a neuritis-preventing dietary.\r\n\r\n  In this connection Heiser, in the Philippines, has reported that\r\n  with a diet in which polished rice was contained the monthly death\r\n  rate at the leper colony at Culion was approximately 100, the\r\n  majority of these deaths being from beriberi. As a result of the\r\n  substitution of unpolished rice, about 1909, the monthly death rate\r\n  fell to less than 20 and of these none were from beriberi.\r\n\r\n  Toward the close of 1911 there was a great shortage of the rice\r\n  crop and the Philippine government bought quantities of rice in\r\n  order to protect the people from extortionate dealers. Much of\r\n  this rice was polished rice. The use of this polished rice was\r\n  commenced at Culion in November, 1911. In January, 1912, there\r\n  were 35 deaths, of which 2 were from beriberi. In February 86\r\n  deaths with 36 from beriberi and in March 82 deaths with 60 from\r\n  beriberi. In February the use of polished rice was discontinued\r\n  and unpolished rice substituted. In April the deaths had fallen to\r\n  25 with 3 from beriberi and, subsequent to that month, deaths from\r\n  beriberi cases developing at Culion ceased to be reported.\r\n\r\n  As regards the length of time necessary for the production of\r\n  the symptom-complex, Strong’s experiments show that beriberi was\r\n  produced in from sixty-one to seventy-five days. In Fraser and\r\n  Stanton’s work no case developed under eighty-seven days and many\r\n  of the cases did not develop for 120 to 160 days. Hamilton Wright\r\n  considered that the incubation period for his toxin-producing\r\n  bacillus was ten to thirty days.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nIn polyneuritis gallinarum, Vedder and Clark are of the opinion\r\nthat there may be two vitamines involved, the absence of one from\r\nthe dietary causing the neuritis, while that of the other leads to\r\ngeneral prostration and cardiac degeneration, so that there may be\r\nother factors in the production of beriberi than the degeneration of\r\nthe peripheral nerves and involvement of the vasomotors.\r\n\r\n  Furthermore, extract of rice polishings rapidly cures the cardiac\r\n  condition as well as the dropsy, but not the paresis; while Funk’s\r\n  vitamine base, which will cure the paralysis, will not affect the\r\n  cardiac disorder.\r\n\r\n  The blood of beriberics in the acute stage, has been shown to\r\n  contain a substance capable of profoundly influencing the vasomotor\r\n  functions, causing venous engorgement and a fall of blood pressure.\r\n\r\n  In deaths from wet beriberi the tissues are very moist so that\r\n  incisions tend to fill with fluid. There are generally present\r\n  pleural and in particular pericardial effusions. Serous fluid\r\n  in the abdominal cavity may also be present. The lower end of\r\n  the stomach and the upper portion of the small intestines, in\r\n  particular the duodenum, show marked congestion with more or less\r\n  abundant haemorrhagic extravasations. Some authorities do not admit\r\n  the existence of this duodenal congestion so insisted upon by\r\n  Wright.\r\n\r\n  The oesophagus is usually congested as may be also the pharynx and\r\n  the larynx.\r\n\r\n  Next to the peripheral nerve degenerations, to be later considered,\r\n  the most important lesions are found in connection with the heart.\r\n  All chambers of the heart show a dilatation with hypertrophy\r\n  as well as dilatation of the right ventricle in cases that\r\n  have lasted for some time. The heart muscle has the faded-leaf\r\n  appearance indicative of fatty degeneration. Microscopically there\r\n  are segmentation and vacuolation of the fibres. The lungs show\r\n  congestion and at times present the characteristics of pulmonary\r\n  oedema. The kidneys are congested but show only exceptionally\r\n  parenchymatous or interstitial changes. As would be expected, the\r\n  back pressure in the right heart gives a dilatation of the central\r\n  vein of the liver lobules which at times is productive of atrophy\r\n  of the adjacent liver cells. The muscles supplied by the affected\r\n  peripheral nerves show more or less atrophy according to the\r\n  duration of the disease.\r\n\r\n  Microscopically, the affected fibres show a loss of striation\r\n  with a colloid degeneration. These changes are more marked in\r\n  beriberic residual paralysis. The key to the disease is in\r\n  the changes present in the peripheral nerves. While these may\r\n  appear normal yet histological examination shows varying nerve\r\n  degenerations from slight medullary degeneration in a few fibres to\r\n  complete destruction of the nerve, giving a Wallerian degeneration\r\n  (vacuolation and formation of myelin droplets in the medullary\r\n  sheath with fragmentation of the axis-cylinder).\r\n\r\n  While it is usually stated that the central nervous system (brain\r\n  and cord), remains uninvolved yet we note axonal degeneration in\r\n  the cells of the nuclear centres of the affected peripheral nerves\r\n  as shown by convexity of the cell sides, dislocation of the nucleus\r\n  and disappearance of the tigroid substance. The striking feature of\r\n  the pathology of beriberi is the involvement of the vagus nerve and\r\n  there is evidence of degenerative changes in the cells of the vagal\r\n  origin in the floor of the fourth ventricle.\r\n\r\n  Various investigators have shown that in fowls marked peripheral\r\n  neuritis can exist long before clinical manifestations appear\r\n  and that typical cases of beriberi may show striking improvement\r\n  following vitamine administration, notwithstanding the continued\r\n  existence of peripheral nerve degeneration. For such reasons Vedder\r\n  thinks the more important changes to probably belong to cells of\r\n  cord and brain.\r\n\r\n  McCarrison has noted striking changes in the endocrine glands in\r\n  avian polyneuritis, particularly hypertrophy of the adrenals and\r\n  atrophy of the other glands of internal secretion. He attributes\r\n  the oedema to increase in adrenalin content. Shimbo has reported\r\n  adrenal hypertrophy in 14 human cases of beriberi.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that beriberi is but a form of multiple\r\nneuritis which in many cases shows only motor and sensory\r\ndisturbances of the lower portions of the upper and lower extremities.\r\n\r\n  In fact an extensive epidemic of arsenical neuritis, or, to be more\r\n  exact, a neuritis in which both alcoholic and arsenical factors\r\n  were operative, was regarded by eminent authorities as beriberi.\r\n\r\nThe key to beriberi, however, is the peculiar and striking selection\r\nof the vagus nerve in the degenerative processes as well as those of\r\nthe peripheral nerves of the extremities. It is vagal involvement,\r\ngiving disturbances of heart particularly and lungs in less degree,\r\nwhich chiefly differentiates beriberi from other forms of multiple\r\nneuritis.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of beriberi is the tendency to vasomotor\r\ninvolvement as shown in the patchy areas of oedema.\r\n\r\n_Epidemic Dropsy._—Beriberi is typically a nonfebrile disease.\r\nThere is, however, a disease with fever, called epidemic dropsy,\r\nwhich seems to have a similar etiology to beriberi. It also shows\r\nthe symptoms of a peripheral neuritis plus cardiac disturbances. In\r\nfact Pearse has maintained the identity of the two diseases. Greig\r\nconsiders epidemic dropsy as resembling ship beriberi.\r\n\r\n  The first record of epidemic dropsy was during a famine in Southern\r\n  India in 1877. Outbreaks again occurred in 1902 and 1907. The fact\r\n  that it is a disease which often shows a house infection has caused\r\n  the advancing of a theory that the bedbug transmits the disease.\r\n\r\n  While greatly resembling beriberi clinically the following points\r\n  of difference are usually noted by those who hold that it is a\r\n  distinct disease entity.\r\n\r\n  1. The presence of fever, which rarely exceeds 102°F. and is\r\n  usually only about 99° to 100°F.\r\n\r\n  2. An erythematous rash upon the oedematous portions of the\r\n  extremities.\r\n\r\n  3. The frequent generalized oedema, which suggested the designation\r\n  dropsy for the disease, cannot be differentiated from wet beriberi.\r\n\r\n  4. The neuritis manifestations are slight or absent. There may\r\n  be formication of the feet but anaesthesia is wanting. The vagal\r\n  involvement gives cardiac disturbances. There is anaemia.\r\n\r\n_Infantile Beriberi._—There is also a condition in nursing infants\r\nwhich would be difficult to recognize if unaware of the existence of\r\nthis type of beriberi. It is called _infantile beriberi_.\r\n\r\n  In 1898 Hirota first noted the existence of a condition in infants\r\n  nourished by beriberi mothers which has more recently been\r\n  carefully studied by McLaughlin and Andrews and to which the name\r\n  infantile beriberi is now generally given. In the Philippines it is\r\n  called “taon.” Clinically there is restlessness, vomiting, altered\r\n  voice, increased heart action, oedema and cyanosis. After death\r\n  there is found a marked hypertrophy and dilatation of the right\r\n  side of the heart with no change of the left side. The peripheral\r\n  nerves also show the lesions of beriberi of adults but of less\r\n  intensity.\r\n\r\n  The disease most often shows itself in an acute form, the child\r\n  rather suddenly being seized with great pain, crying constantly and\r\n  soon becoming cyanosed. Death, which may occur in a few minutes or\r\n  hours, is often thought to be due to meningitis, although there is\r\n  no fever or true convulsions. There is only rigidity of the body.\r\n  Less frequently the disease appears in a chronic form in which\r\n  vomiting and constipation are most marked. There is often a history\r\n  of the loss by the mother, who herself may have only a rudimentary\r\n  beriberi, of several children from this disease.\r\n\r\n  The infants improve rapidly when other infant feeding is\r\n  substituted for the mother’s milk. An extract of rice polishings\r\n  gives striking results in these cases.\r\n\r\n  _Asylum Beriberi._—The beriberi outbreaks which have frequently\r\n  been reported from European and American camps, prisons and\r\n  asylums do not differ from the cases one may see in the\r\n  classical distribution of the disease among the rice-eating\r\n  populations of the Orient. The cause is the same, a deficiency\r\n  in beriberi-preventing vitamines, and the symptoms are similar.\r\n  These vitamines may be deficient in the rice or other cereal or\r\n  proteid food supplied. Again they may have originally been present\r\n  in sufficient quantity but later destroyed by too great heat or\r\n  otherwise.\r\n\r\n=Types of Beriberi.=—The ordinary clinical division of beriberi\r\nis into (1) _wet or dropsical beriberi_ and (2) _dry or atrophic\r\nberiberi_. At the same time, in a typical case, we find such\r\na combination of the vasomotor disturbances which lead to the\r\noedematous or dropsical manifestations of wet beriberi, and likewise\r\nof those of peripheral nerve involvement causing more or less\r\ndevelopment of muscular palsies or atrophies, as seen more strikingly\r\nin dry or atrophic beriberi, that it does not seem advisable to\r\nemploy such a division.\r\n\r\n  In fact typical cases of wet or dropsical beriberi after a profuse\r\n  diuresis may change in a short time, as Manson has so aptly stated,\r\n  from a bloated carcass to little more than skin and bones and\r\n  assume all the appearance of a case of dry or atrophic beriberi.\r\n\r\n  Even Vedder, who states that from a theoretical standpoint wet and\r\n  dry beriberi may be considered separate pathological processes\r\n  (deficiency in the anti-cardiac degeneration vitamine rather than\r\n  the anti-neuritis one), is inclined to believe it inadvisable, from\r\n  a clinical standpoint, to consider the one type apart from the\r\n  other.\r\n\r\nOne sees cases which combine the features of dry and wet beriberi\r\nwhich can best be designated _typical beriberi_. Again we see cases\r\nwhere the vagal and vasomotor involvement is so marked that the\r\npatient resembles a man with acute nephritis plus all the evidence\r\nof extreme cardiac decompensation. Such cases may be designated\r\n_fulminating_, _pernicious_ or better _cardiac_.\r\n\r\n  Again we observe cases which from the start show little if any\r\n  oedema and very slight cardiac involvement, but with marked motor\r\n  disturbances as shown by muscular atrophies and palsies. The\r\n  sensory changes are not so marked as the motor ones. Complete\r\n  anaesthesia is rarely present, it is rather paraesthesia and\r\n  blunting of sensation which characterize the sensory phenomena.\r\n  This is usually designated the _atrophic_ or _paraplegic_ type.\r\n\r\n_Rudimentary or Larval Beriberi._—Scheube recognizes a rudimentary\r\ntype and it must have been the experience of every one in the tropics\r\nthat these indefinite types of beriberi are quite common.\r\n\r\n  In such cases there may be nothing more than some weakness of the\r\n  legs with vague manifestations of blunting of the sensation or\r\n  variation of the reflexes. At times there may be marked anaesthesia\r\n  in the region over the shin bones.\r\n\r\n  Many of these cases show cardiac palpitation on exertion and at\r\n  times we may note slight evidences of oedema about the lower part\r\n  of shin bone or dorsum of the foot. It is the frequency of such\r\n  cases that causes physicians in the tropics to consider almost\r\n  any affection showing neurological manifestations as of beriberi\r\n  nature. A careful study of the neurological features of cases in\r\n  the tropics will show that many of these cases are not beriberi but\r\n  rather the common cosmopolitan diseases of the nervous system.\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case of Beriberi.=—The patient first complains of\r\nweakness and heaviness of the legs, particularly after fatiguing\r\nwork. There is also noted a sense of fullness and tenderness in\r\nthe epigastric region. The slightest exercise brings about cardiac\r\npalpitation and more or less dyspnoea.\r\n\r\n  As the symptoms of peripheral neuritis become more prominent we\r\n  have hyperaesthesia of the calf muscles so that squeezing these\r\n  muscles gives rise to rather marked pain. The thenar muscles or\r\n  those of the forearm may also be more or less hyperaesthetic.\r\n  Attention has been called to a circumoral anaesthesia.\r\n\r\nAn examination at this time will probably show an active patellar\r\nreflex, some oedema over the shin and malleoli, possibly extending to\r\nthe dorsum of the foot, with partial anaesthesia in the oedematous\r\nareas. It is a blunting of sensation as though a layer of cotton\r\nwere interposed between the skin and the examining instrument. Other\r\nfavorite sites for the oedema are the sacral and sternal regions.\r\nOccasionally sharply defined oedematous patches may be observed,\r\nparticularly on the arms.\r\n\r\nThe exercise attendant upon the physical examination will probably\r\ncause a rather marked cardiac palpitation. The pulse is usually rapid\r\nand its rate is markedly affected by the slightest exertion. The\r\nsystolic pressure is low.\r\n\r\nThe anaesthesia noted in the lower extremities soon tends to show\r\nitself about the back of the hands and the finger tips, so that it\r\nmay be difficult for the patient to button his coat. There is also\r\nweakness of the grip. The temperature is normal and the mind is\r\nentirely clear. The results from a blood examination are practically\r\nnegative, although later on there is the blood picture of a secondary\r\nanaemia.\r\n\r\n  In cases where the oedema is more marked and generalized and when\r\n  pericardial or other effusions are developing we find a diminution\r\n  in the amount of urine, but with an absence of albuminuria.\r\n\r\nLater the case may show a dropsical condition more or less resembling\r\nnephritis, but with only slight scrotal oedema. At the same time\r\nthere will be found a dilatation of the right heart with blowing\r\nsystolic murmurs and equal spacing of the heart sounds. There may be\r\nmarked pulsation of the veins of the neck. At this time the patellar\r\nreflex may be diminished and the anaesthetic areas more extensive.\r\n\r\n  This condition of wet, dropsical or oedematous beriberi may be\r\n  fairly rapidly succeeded by a disappearance of the oedema with, as\r\n  a result, the making more striking of the muscular atrophy incident\r\n  to the neuritis of the peripheral nerves. In this, the atrophic,\r\n  dry or paralytic beriberi, the _jongkok test_ is of value. With the\r\n  hands over the head the patient squats down on the calves of his\r\n  legs and attempts to rise—something impossible for the beriberic.\r\n  At this time the patellar reflex probably cannot be elicited and\r\n  later on there will be found foot and wrist-drop with atrophy of\r\n  muscles. With complete foot-drop, the reactions of degeneration\r\n  will be found.\r\n\r\nA combination of the dry and wet types of beriberi is often described\r\nas the mixed type.\r\n\r\n  It must always be remembered that the course of the ordinary case\r\n  of beriberi is essentially chronic, running over months or years.\r\n\r\n=Acute Pernicious Beriberi.=—This is the fulminating type of\r\nberiberi in which the marked involvement of the vagus overshadows\r\nthe other but less manifest phenomena of the disease. In some cases\r\nthe signs of peripheral neuritis may be quite prominent before the\r\nfulminating onset of the cardiac manifestations, there being almost\r\na total lack of disturbance of the vasomotor system. Again we may\r\nhave slight if at all demonstrable motor or sensory disturbances but\r\nwith marked oedema. It should be borne in mind that this development\r\nof cardiac disturbance with its fatal tendency may develop even\r\nin a case of rudimentary beriberi. It is a common experience that\r\ncases considered as mild types may, in a few hours, show cardiac\r\ninvolvement and terminate fatally with striking suddenness.\r\n\r\n  There is apt to be marked epigastric tenderness or even distress\r\n  coming on with the onset of the acute cardiac involvement. It may\r\n  be so extreme that the patient dreads the slightest palpation of\r\n  his epigastrium. From a marked palpitation and praecordial distress\r\n  evidences of the dilatation of the right heart become prominent.\r\n  Indications of tricuspid insufficiency are seen in the pulsating\r\n  jugulars and cyanosis. The cardiac dullness is greatly increased\r\n  to the right and various abnormalities of sounds and rhythm may be\r\n  observed. There is also dyspnoea and a sensation of constriction\r\n  of the chest (beriberic corset). These are the cases which give\r\n  as horrible a picture of death as one ever sees. In the final\r\n  struggle for breath and praecordial agony of the last stages of\r\n  decompensation in old heart lesions we have a more gradual course\r\n  in a more asthenic patient. Acute pernicious beriberi may run its\r\n  course in a strong, vigorous patient in a few hours. In some cases\r\n  we have paralysis of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n=Paraplegic and Rudimentary Types.=—The rudimentary type has\r\nalready been considered and it would be impossible to draw a line\r\nbetween slightly developed paraplegic cases and rudimentary ones.\r\nThe paraplegic cases show the weakness of feet and hands going on\r\nto wrist and foot-drop. There is also marked blunting of sensation\r\nof feet and hands which gives one the impression of ataxia when the\r\npatient tries to button his coat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—_A_, Mixed Beriberi. _B_, Wet Beriberi. _C_,\r\nDry Beriberi. (From Jackson’s Tropical Medicine.)]\r\n\r\n  There is atrophy of muscles so that the grip of the patient\r\n  is enfeebled. This partial anaesthesia also accounts for the\r\n  pseudoataxic gait in which the element of muscular weakness is\r\n  prominent as opposed to the vigorous heel stamping gait of the\r\n  ataxic tabetic. The patient drags the toes and leans forward on a\r\n  cane when walking, thus suggesting the tripod.\r\n\r\nIt is the typical steppage gait of degeneration of the lower motor\r\nneurones. It is a flaccid, atrophic paralysis of the muscles.\r\n\r\n  There is no involvement of the sphincter.\r\n\r\n  _Beriberic Residual Paralysis._—Hamilton Wright has used the term\r\n  beriberic residual paralysis to indicate cases which, in the course\r\n  of convalescence and favorable regeneration of axis-cylinders and\r\n  more or less return to a normal condition, become subject to some\r\n  factor lowering the vital forces and body resistance and experience\r\n  a return of the beriberi manifestations. To use a common expression\r\n  the patient has a set-back and the favorable progress to complete\r\n  recovery is temporarily in abeyance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _Nervous Symptoms._—The most common symptoms are those connected\r\n  with degenerations involving the peripheral nerves of the\r\n  extremities. The motor nerves are more involved than the sensory\r\n  ones, there being rarely complete anaesthesia, but rather a\r\n  blunting of sensation as though a piece of cloth were interposed\r\n  between the examining instrument and the skin. At first there is\r\n  weakening of the muscle power as shown by the grip of the hand\r\n  or weakness of foot muscles. In more advanced cases we may have\r\n  foot and wrist-drop. Hyperaesthesia of the muscles is prominent,\r\n  especially that of the calf muscles. The unsteadiness of gait is\r\n  not true ataxia as the patient does not clearly show the Romberg\r\n  sign. It is muscular weakness rather than incoördination.\r\n\r\n  The Argyll-Robertson pupil is absent. The gait is the steppage\r\n  one of peripheral neuritis, the patient walking as if extracting\r\n  one foot after the other from clinging mud. Later on, when other\r\n  muscles than the foot extensors are involved, the gait becomes a\r\n  shuffling one. The mind is entirely clear. The vasomotor phenomena\r\n  are often marked as shown by patchy or most extensive development\r\n  of oedema and serous exudates. The knee-jerk is usually absent.\r\n  Fibrillary twitchings may be observed in beriberi as well as in\r\n  progressive muscular atrophy. The extensors of arms and legs are\r\n  more markedly affected than the flexors. The cardiac symptoms are\r\n  really connected with vagal involvement.\r\n\r\n  _The Cardio-respiratory Symptoms._—Owing to involvement of\r\n  the vagus the inhibitory apparatus is deranged so that we have\r\n  palpitation and rapid pulse rate both of which are markedly\r\n  increased by the slightest exertion.\r\n\r\n  The blood pressure is below normal. Shortness of breath is the\r\n  earliest feature of respiratory trouble. This may go on to marked\r\n  thoracic oppression and dyspnoea.\r\n\r\n  Aphonia may be present in acute pernicious beriberi and probably\r\n  indicates laryngeal palsies. Such cases are usually fatal.\r\n\r\n  Pulmonary congestion and oedema always accompany the terminal right\r\n  side dilatation of the heart which is responsible for the cyanosis,\r\n  pulsating jugulars and various murmurs. The pulmonic second sound\r\n  is accentuated and may be reduplicated. The rhythm of the heart\r\n  sounds is replaced by the equal spacing of embryo-cardia. The\r\n  diaphragm may be paralyzed as may also happen to the intercostal\r\n  muscles.\r\n\r\n  _Digestive and Urinary Symptoms._—Those who considered beriberi\r\n  as an acute infectious disease were disposed to note frequently\r\n  evidences of toxaemia as manifested by nausea, vomiting and\r\n  epigastric distress. As a matter of fact these symptoms only become\r\n  very prominent in pernicious beriberi and may well be connected\r\n  with the cardiac decompensation. However caused vomiting is of\r\n  unfavorable prognostic import.\r\n\r\n  The amount of urine is markedly decreased when oedema is advancing\r\n  but is succeeded by a polyuria when this diminishes. If albumin\r\n  should be present it is not connected with beriberi but some other\r\n  condition.\r\n\r\n  _Other Features._—There is nothing characteristic about the blood\r\n  other than a slowly developing anaemia.\r\n\r\n  Oedema is the most striking feature of wet beriberi. When slight\r\n  this oedema may only involve the pretibial-region or sternum.\r\n  Circumscribed areas of oedema may be present on the upper parts of\r\n  the body as neck and trunk.\r\n\r\n  Hydropericardium is the most frequent of the exudates into serous\r\n  cavities. Fever is almost always absent except in epidemic dropsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nWhen the case is one of mixed type with the oedema, cardiac\r\ninvolvement and signs of peripheral neuritis the diagnosis is\r\nreadily made. A diagnosis of nephritis is often given the wet type\r\nof beriberi and locomotor ataxia the dry form, by those who have not\r\nin mind the possibility of the disease existing in an oriental crew\r\nafter a long voyage.\r\n\r\n  The urine in beriberi is as a rule normal and there are no\r\n  peripheral nerve disorders in nephritis. Chagas has noted that a\r\n  quartan form of malaria gives rise to oedema about the ankles and\r\n  is often mistaken for beriberi by the physicians of the Amazon\r\n  region.\r\n\r\n  The cardiac manifestations of beriberi differ from those of\r\n  valvular disease in that the murmurs are muffled and there does not\r\n  exist the definite areas for the location of the murmurs of the\r\n  various valvular lesions. The rapid development of a pericardial\r\n  effusion is also against valvular heart disease.\r\n\r\n  The absence of lancinating pains, typical Romberg sign and\r\n  Argyll-Robertson pupil should differentiate from tabes.\r\n\r\nThe tripod gait of beriberi takes its name from the wide separation\r\nof feet and use, with the hands, of a cane in front. It is a steppage\r\ngait instead of the ataxic one of tabes. On account of the lack of\r\npower to raise the toes in walking, the beriberic lifts the hip and\r\nswings to one side in order to avoid scraping his toes.\r\n\r\n  In progressive muscular atrophy the palsy attacks the hand first\r\n  and in a more advanced case showing the main-en-griffe there would\r\n  also be deltoid involvement. Of course beriberi may show the\r\n  main-en-griffe characteristic but the greater involvement of the\r\n  feet with vagal phenomena differentiates.\r\n\r\n_Ship Beriberi._—A disease of importance on Scandinavian sailing\r\nships to which the designation “ship beriberi” has been given\r\nresembles beriberi in that we have oedema particularly of the lower\r\nextremities and at times generalized so that a case would appear to\r\nbe one of wet beriberi.\r\n\r\n  More or less dyspnoea and cardiac palpitation are features of\r\n  the disease as of beriberi. In fact death often is the result of\r\n  acute cardiac paralysis. The striking point of difference is the\r\n  generally reported absence of manifestations of neuritis and Nocht\r\n  in an autopsy of a case failed to find evidence of degeneration of\r\n  the peripheral nerves.\r\n\r\n  Another point of distinction is that once the ship arrives in port\r\n  and a diet of fresh meat and vegetables is substituted for the one\r\n  of sterilized canned meats and desiccated and preserved vegetables,\r\n  the patient recovers rapidly so that in one or two weeks there is\r\n  no sign of the disease remaining. Beriberics improve at once when\r\n  put on a curative diet but the damage done the peripheral nerves\r\n  makes complete recovery a matter of weeks or months. Nocht is of\r\n  the opinion that ship beriberi is closely related to scurvy as he\r\n  found sore gums and haemorrhages into muscles in some of his cases.\r\n  He also notes that even in true scurvy there may be cases of dropsy\r\n  without the spongy gums and haemorrhages. Dropsy plus sore gums is\r\n  not infrequently noted in the beriberi-like affection of the men of\r\n  the French fishing fleet off the Newfoundland banks.\r\n\r\n  Schaumann believes that ship beriberi is due to an acute deficiency\r\n  in phosphorus, a chronic deficiency causing beriberi. It is\r\n  probable that this disease is caused by a deficiency in certain\r\n  vitamines, these being destroyed in the sterilization of canned\r\n  meats or by drying vegetables.\r\n\r\n_Scurvy._—It will be remembered that in scurvy, which is the classic\r\nfood deficiency disease, we have spongy, swollen gums, loose teeth,\r\noedema about ankles and, in particular, haemorrhages into skin at\r\nsite of hair follicles and tumor-like haemorrhages into subcutaneous\r\nand muscular tissues. Haemorrhages into the mucous membranes are not\r\nuncommon. The heart shows marked palpitation and weakness.\r\n\r\n  The scurvy vitamine is much less stable than the beriberi one. It\r\n  is contained in fresh foods only, drying destroying it.\r\n\r\n  In connection with the question of multiplicity of vitamines\r\n  monkeys fed on rice will develop beriberi while if fed on a bread\r\n  deficiency diet they develop scurvy.\r\n\r\n  In Mesopotamia the Indian troops suffered greatly from scurvy\r\n  but not from beriberi while the British troops had many cases\r\n  of beriberi. From July to December there were 11,445 cases of\r\n  scurvy among the Indian forces and 104 cases of beriberi among the\r\n  British. During this period the British ate white biscuits, tinned\r\n  meats and horse flesh. This latter protected them from scurvy but\r\n  the Indian troops would not eat the fresh meat but ate barley flour\r\n  instead. The antiscorbutic vitamines are sometimes designated as\r\n  water soluble C vitamines.\r\n\r\n_Rand Scurvy._—In investigating the endemic scurvy on the Rand,\r\nin South Africa, Darling noted hypertrophy and dilatation of right\r\nheart. Such cases often showed vagal degeneration. Pathologically,\r\nthese cases were closely related to beriberi, but clinically, they\r\nshowed spongy gums, and haemorrhages elsewhere. The knee-jerks were\r\nalways exaggerated.\r\n\r\n  _Infantile Scurvy._—As differing from infantile beriberi, we have\r\n  in infantile scurvy, which is attributed to the use of sterilized\r\n  milk instead of fresh milk, a tendency to separation of the\r\n  epiphyses from the shafts of the bones and extreme sensitiveness\r\n  to any movement particularly of the legs. A markedly anaemic and\r\n  asthenic condition is also characteristic. The chief lesion is a\r\n  subperiosteal blood extravasation.\r\n\r\n  Milk contains several vitamines some of which, as the growth\r\n  vitamine, are, destroyed in boiling; others, however, are not\r\n  destroyed until subjected to a temperature of about 120°C.\r\n\r\n  _War Oedema._—In those areas of Europe where famine conditions\r\n  were approached during the great war a condition of weakness and\r\n  oedema was noted by many observers and to this symptom-complex\r\n  various designations were applied such as war dropsy, war oedema,\r\n  etc. The oedema was more marked than would be true in ordinary\r\n  cases of starvation so that such factors as consumption of large\r\n  amounts of water and salt in the thin soups so prominent in the\r\n  dietary, plus hard work, must have been additional causes.\r\n\r\n  The oedema was most common in the feet and legs, at times extending\r\n  to the thighs and trunk, and in about one-half the cases involving\r\n  the face. Marked muscular weakness and alimentary disturbances\r\n  were common. There was dyspnoea on slight exertion with a slow\r\n  pulse, but cardiac disturbances were not features of the disease.\r\n  The urine was pale, of low specific gravity and free of albumin.\r\n  There was reduction of red cells and a tendency to leukopenia.\r\n  These cases showed marked emaciation upon the disappearance of\r\n  the dropsy. As is well known the deficiency in fats was marked\r\n  in Central Europe so that it was to be expected that ocular\r\n  manifestations should be frequently noted, deficiency of fat\r\n  soluble A being the exciting cause of xerophthalmia. The cases\r\n  tended to recovery under proper diet and hospital care.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important conditions to consider in differentiation\r\nof beriberi are the peripheral nerve involvements caused by alcohol\r\nand arsenic.\r\n\r\n  In alcoholic neuritis there is the history of alcoholic excesses,\r\n  long-standing digestive disorders and tremors of hands, lips and\r\n  tongue. Chiefly characteristic, however, is the mental involvement,\r\n  such cases almost always showing loss of memory and defective\r\n  mental concentration.\r\n\r\n  Mental symptoms and tremors are practically absent in beriberi and\r\n  we have here the marked feature of vagal involvement plus vasomotor\r\n  phenomena.\r\n\r\n  In arsenical neuritis we have an early puffiness under the eyelids\r\n  and pigmentation of the skin which first shows itself in areas\r\n  normally pigmented. A dysenteric syndrome may also be present.\r\n\r\n  There would be less chance of confusing lead palsy as this chiefly\r\n  involves the upper extremity. Punctate basophilia, lead colic and\r\n  the blue line on the gums should differentiate.\r\n\r\n  In diphtheritic palsies the muscles of the soft palate are involved\r\n  in more than 75% of cases. Ocular palsies are also not infrequent.\r\n\r\nIn lathyrism we have a history of the eating of the chick-pea\r\n(Lathyrus sativus) or other vetches, as may occur in times of famine.\r\nPain in the back, weakness of the legs and symptoms of spastic\r\nparaplegia appear. The spasticity differentiates. The heart is not\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n  It may be stated that there is no laboratory diagnosis for beriberi.\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThere is no disease in which one should be more conservative in\r\nmaking a favorable prognosis than in beriberi. A case which seems\r\nto be progressing toward recovery may suddenly develop cardiac\r\ndisturbances and die in a very short time.\r\n\r\n  We now know that a change to a beriberi-preventing diet is\r\n  practically curative.\r\n\r\n  The mortality rate varies in different countries and in different\r\n  epidemics, so that we have death rates varying from less than 2 per\r\n  cent. to those exceeding 50 per cent. In acute pernicious beriberi\r\n  the prognosis is almost surely fatal.\r\n\r\n  The epidemic of beriberi which prevailed at Manila in 1882 seems to\r\n  have been attended by a great mortality, this having been as high\r\n  as 60% during the early part of the outbreak.\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—It must be remembered that not only is rice, from\r\nwhich the neuritis-preventing vitamine has been removed by excessive\r\nmilling, productive of beriberi but that the same applies to other\r\ncereals which have been similarly deprived of their vitamines.\r\n\r\n  The same result may be obtained by the employment of excessive\r\n  sterilization for canning.\r\n\r\nFresh meat is as valuable as fresh vegetables in prophylaxis but if\r\neither kind of food be subjected to excessive heat, as is the case\r\nwith tinned meats, etc., they not only do not prevent beriberi but in\r\na negative way are beriberi-producing.\r\n\r\n  While boiled beef is heated throughout, with more or less complete\r\n  destruction of vitamines, roast beef does not sustain a temperature\r\n  above 70°C. in its interior, hence the greater portion of the\r\n  vitamine content is present in such meat.\r\n\r\n  It is possible that moulds may deprive cereals of their vitamines\r\n  so that spoiled cereals may be beriberi-producing. There have been\r\n  many reports both from asylums and prisons which would indicate\r\n  that the employed and the patients or prisoners lived on the same\r\n  ration yet the guards or nurses failed to develop beriberi, which\r\n  disease was prevalent among the inmates. Such statements rarely\r\n  stand the test of investigation. The same is true of pellagra.\r\n\r\nMany of the reported outbreaks of beriberi among those who were\r\nenjoying an abundant ration have been found to be connected with the\r\nalmost exclusive consumption of expensive canned meats and vegetables.\r\n\r\n  As the beriberi vitamine is apparently important in carbohydrate\r\n  metabolism, a greater ingestion of carbohydrates demands more\r\n  vitamine, hence an increase in carbohydrates, without corresponding\r\n  increase in vitamine-containing foods, may bring on beriberi where,\r\n  before the increase in carbohydrates, there was an absence of\r\n  beriberi.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the development of beriberi it must always\r\nbe kept in mind that debilitating conditions such as unhygienic\r\nquarters and overexertion, as well as disease conditions (malaria,\r\nancylostomiasis, etc.) are factors of importance. In military forces\r\nexcessive drills should be stopped. The fatigue factor is to be kept\r\nin mind in this as in other food deficiency diseases.\r\n\r\n  A combination of barley, which is rich in vitamines, with the rice\r\n  is important in oriental countries, thus a diet containing 6 parts\r\n  barley to 4 parts rice and used in Japanese prisons, on account of\r\n  its cheapness, not only prevented beriberi but cured the disease in\r\n  beriberics entering prison.\r\n\r\n  There is no doubt but that legislation against rice which contains\r\n  less than 0.4% of P_{2}O_{5} is a valuable measure of prophylaxis.\r\n  Polished rice has lost in P_{2}O_{5} as well as in vitamines.\r\n\r\n  Heiser has proposed that an excessive tax be placed on polished\r\n  rice with free entry for the unpolished article. The following\r\n  suggestions of Vedder in connection with prophylaxis would seem to\r\n  be worthy of consideration in pellagra as well as in beriberi.\r\n\r\n  1. In any institution where bread is the staple article of diet, it\r\n  should be made from whole wheat flour.\r\n\r\n  2. When rice is used in any quantity, the brown, undermilled, or\r\n  so-called _hygienic rice_ should be furnished.\r\n\r\n  3. Beans, peas, or other legume, known to prevent beriberi, should\r\n  be served at least once a week. Canned beans or peas should not be\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n  4. Some fresh vegetable or fruit should be issued at least once a\r\n  week and preferably at least twice a week.\r\n\r\n  5. Barley, a known preventive of beriberi, should be used in all\r\n  soups.\r\n\r\n  6. If corn meal is the staple of diet it should be yellow meal or\r\n  water-ground meal, i.e., made from the whole grain.\r\n\r\n  7. White potatoes and fresh meat, known preventives of beriberi,\r\n  should be served at least once a week, and preferably once daily.\r\n\r\n  8. The too exclusive use of canned food must be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\n  McCarrison has noted the value of onions even in a diet in which\r\n  protein and vitamine constituents are sufficient. The onions seem\r\n  to inhibit the growth of putrefactive bacteria.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—The most important treatment is that of the\r\nsubstitution of a diet containing the essential vitamines for the\r\nberiberi-producing one. In carrying this out regard must be had\r\nfor the customs and tastes of the race concerned. Thus fresh beef\r\nmay be excellent for some people but objectionable to others.\r\nEggs, particularly the yolk, are very valuable as is also true of\r\nunsterilized milk. Extract of rice polishings has given splendid\r\nresults in infantile beriberi but does not seem to have been as\r\nefficacious in the disease in adults. Yeast has great curative value.\r\nAn extract of yeast known as _marmite_ has achieved reputation\r\nwhen given in doses of 20 grains daily. Seidell has recently used\r\nan autolyzed brewers’ bottom yeast. By treating this material with\r\nLloyds’ reagent he has extracted the vitamines so that instead of\r\nhaving to give 200 cc., a dose of 10 grams of the concentrated\r\nproduct suffices.\r\n\r\n  Malt extract is very rich in vitamines and liver seems to have a\r\n  higher content than beef muscle. Fat soluble A vitamine is abundant\r\n  in glandular organs but scarcely present in the beef of our\r\n  markets—this is probably true of water soluble B. Heart muscle is\r\n  about on a par with liver. Germinating wheat and beans seem to have\r\n  special value in treatment as well as prophylaxis.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of a case care must be had not to allow a patient\r\nwith any cardiac involvement to sit up in bed as this may cause\r\nsudden death. Braddon considers atropine hypodermically as of value\r\nin cardiac types of cases.\r\n\r\n  Amyl nitrite inhalations or injections of 1% solution of\r\n  nitroglycerine are indicated when there is evidence of extreme\r\n  cardiac dilatation. Venesection is also to be kept in mind. Cardiac\r\n  tonics are of less value than rest, diet and venesection.\r\n\r\n  In the feeding of such patients only small amounts should be given\r\n  at a time to avoid epigastric distress. Again carbohydrates should\r\n  be restricted as there is evidence that excess of carbohydrates as\r\n  well as vitamine deficiency may be concerned in the disease. The\r\n  bowels should be kept open with salines. Mineral oil tends to keep\r\n  down intestinal putrefaction which is a factor of importance.\r\n\r\n  Strychnine is usually given as a routine treatment in the less\r\n  acute cases. With muscular atrophy massage is of prime importance.\r\n  Electrical stimulation is also usually employed. With the palsies\r\n  there is great danger of contractures so that even the bed clothing\r\n  should not rest upon the paralyzed feet. Even splints may be\r\n  necessitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nPELLAGRA\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—For a time it seemed as if the old idea that pellagra\r\nwas connected with a dietary defect, chiefly as regarded some factor\r\nin a preponderating diet of maize, had been replaced by one assigning\r\nas cause some infectious process, probably protozoal, possibly\r\nbacterial.\r\n\r\nThe important advances recently made in the study of beriberi have\r\ntended once more to swing the pendulum to the food deficiency\r\netiology. The latest views assign to food deficiency the basic\r\netiology, but regard some other factor, possibly an infectious one,\r\nas secondarily operative.\r\n\r\n  The disease is essentially chronic with periodic exacerbations but\r\n  may run a rather acute course with a rapidly fatal termination. The\r\n  trend of symptoms consists of (1) mild neurasthenic manifestations\r\n  in the winter to be followed in the spring by (2) disturbances of\r\n  the alimentary tract, consisting of stomatitis, burning sensations\r\n  going up the oesophagus, gastric eructations and recurring\r\n  diarrhoeas. (3) In addition to the neurological and alimentary\r\n  tract symptoms we have the third and diagnostically the most\r\n  important group, those of the cutaneous system. The pellagrous\r\n  eruption is characterized by strikingly symmetrical, sharply\r\n  delimited patches of erythema, resembling sunburn. The sites of\r\n  preference are backs of hands, extending up the forearms, bridge of\r\n  nose or neck. The neurasthenia tends to pass into a toxic psychosis\r\n  or even a confusional insanity.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Maidismus, Alpine Scurvy, Asturian Leprosy, Mal de la\r\nRosa, Mal del Sole.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—Strambio considers some of the references of\r\n  Hippocrates to refer to pellagra but Castellani and Chalmers state\r\n  that after searching the writings of Hippocrates they have been\r\n  unable to find any references to a disease showing a resemblance to\r\n  pellagra.\r\n\r\n  The first definite description of the disease is generally credited\r\n  to Casal who, in 1735, described the disease as it existed in the\r\n  Asturias.\r\n\r\n  In his writings he notes that the peasants lived chiefly on corn\r\n  and that they rarely had fresh meat.\r\n\r\n  Casal’s paper was not published until 1762 but Thitery, who visited\r\n  Spain and was shown cases of pellagra by Casal, described the\r\n  disease in 1755 and gave full credit to Casal for the recognition\r\n  of the disease. The name of the disease was given it by Frapolli,\r\n  in 1771, the derivation being from pelle—skin, and agra—rough.\r\n  The disease had then existed in Italy for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n  Casal called the disease mal de la rosa.\r\n\r\n  In 1810, Marzari insisted that the two diseases, pellagra and\r\n  Alpine scurvy, which had a few years previously been recognized as\r\n  identical, were caused by the consumption of maize and from this\r\n  time on the maize theory as to etiology has been supported in Italy.\r\n\r\n  Later on (1872 to 1909) Lombroso elaborated the maize theory of\r\n  etiology and so strongly presented this view that it is impossible\r\n  for us lightly to set aside the arguments of this great physician.\r\n\r\n  While the zeists, as the advocates of the maize etiology are\r\n  termed, insist that pellagra made its appearance in Europe\r\n  following the introduction of Indian corn, after the voyages of\r\n  Columbus, there does not seem to be any evidence that pellagra ever\r\n  existed among the North American Indians. In 1905 Sambon insisted\r\n  that pellagra was a protozoal disease and in 1910 claimed that it\r\n  was probably transmitted by a midge, _Simulium reptans_.\r\n\r\n  About 1907 pellagra was found to be an important disease of the\r\n  Southern States of the United States and since that time the number\r\n  of cases has steadily increased so that it is now estimated that\r\n  there have been approximately 200,000 cases in the United States.\r\n\r\n  It is generally conceded that isolated cases of pellagra had\r\n  occurred in the United States prior to 1907, but they generally\r\n  were diagnosed differently.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—In Europe it is most prevalent in\r\n  Italy, Balkan States, Greece, Turkey, Spain and Portugal. In\r\n  Roumania there were about 100,000 cases in 1906. The disease has\r\n  decreased in incidence and virulence in Italy, there having been in\r\n  1910 only 33,869 cases, as against 104,607 cases in 1881.\r\n\r\n  The disease was first recognized in Egypt by Sandwith in 1893 and\r\n  is now known to be widespread in Lower Egypt. It is rare in Upper\r\n  Egypt where they live on millet instead of maize. It exists in\r\n  Algiers.\r\n\r\n  It has been reported from India and the Straits Settlements and\r\n  prevails extensively in the West Indian Islands as well as in\r\n  Mexico and Central America.\r\n\r\n  The disease in the Southern States of the United States is of a\r\n  more fatal type than elsewhere, the average mortality having been\r\n  39.10%. The death rate in the United States has fallen, thus the\r\n  rate in Mississippi for the years 1914 to 1916 was only ten per\r\n  cent.\r\n\r\n  At present the Italian mortality is only about 3% although formerly\r\n  it was much higher.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—Like other diseases of unknown etiology the views in\r\nthis connection are innumerable.\r\n\r\n  _Zeists and Anti-zeists._—It is customary to divide the adherents\r\n  of the different views as to the cause of the disease into two\r\n  groups, the zeists, who advocate a connection between maize or\r\n  Indian corn (_Zea Mays_) and the disease, and the anti-zeists, who\r\n  claim that corn has nothing to do with pellagra.\r\n\r\n_Food Deficiency._—Before taking up the better known considerations\r\nnoted above it may be stated that many now believe that pellagra,\r\nalong with beriberi and scurvy, belongs to the group of “food\r\ndeficiency” diseases. Just as beriberi is caused by the absence of a\r\nneuritis-preventing substance or vitamine in the dietary, so is the\r\nsymptom-complex of pellagra brought about by the absence from the\r\ndietary of some vitamine or vitamines essential to proper metabolism.\r\nThere are various ideas as to the factor which eliminates the\r\npellagra-preventing vitamines.\r\n\r\n  Some claim that in the process of milling maize the\r\n  vitamine-containing outer portion (bran) has been taken off just as\r\n  with beriberi-producing white rice, from which the pericarp with\r\n  its neuritis-preventing vitamine has been more or less completely\r\n  removed.\r\n\r\n  From analyses of milled maize and millings Funk has recently\r\n  suggested that pellagra in different countries is in relation\r\n  to the degree of milling. Just as with rice and maize so does\r\n  excessive milling of wheat get rid of vitamines, therefore, bread\r\n  made from highly milled flour is dietetically deficient.\r\n\r\n  Again, as brought out by Voegtlin, alkalis tend to destroy any\r\n  remaining vitamines in such bread. The practice of using sodium\r\n  bicarbonate in preparation of bread is a further factor in the food\r\n  deficiency problem. With the use of baking powder or buttermilk\r\n  the alkaline carbonate of soda is neutralized so that there is no\r\n  destructive effect on vitamine content.\r\n\r\n  The vitamine deficiency of highly milled flour and highly milled\r\n  corn meal runs parallel with the phosphorus pentoxide content of\r\n  such products. Whole wheat shows about 1.1% P_{2}O_{5}, while\r\n  highly milled flour contains only about 0.1%. Whole corn has about\r\n  0.76% P_{2}O_{5}, while milled corn meal has only about 0.3%.\r\n  Highly milled rice has under 0.4% P_{2}O_{5}.\r\n\r\nOthers think that as the result of bacterial or mould diseases of\r\nthe corn grain these important vitamines are destroyed. Then too,\r\nas with rice and beriberi, the prevailing idea is that while there\r\nis a striking association between a maize dietary deficient in the\r\npellagra-preventing vitamine and the occurrence of pellagra, yet this\r\ndeficiency may be supplied by other foods.\r\n\r\n  Beriberi seems rather definitely to be associated with a deficiency\r\n  in the anti-neuritis vitamine, which is probably the same as water\r\n  soluble B., and in pellagra-producing diets a similar deficiency\r\n  may be noted. More striking however is the deficiency in fat\r\n  soluble A in such diets. This vitamine is abundant in butter fat\r\n  and egg yolk, articles of diet of which pellagrins are deprived.\r\n\r\n  Leaves of plants contain it in abundance, while with seeds it is\r\n  present in less degree and then contained in the embryo, which\r\n  latter is lost in milling. Millet contains an exceptionally large\r\n  amount of fat soluble A and it is well known that in Egypt those\r\n  living on millet instead of maize escape pellagra. The protein of\r\n  millet has a high biological value which is the reverse with that\r\n  of maize. It should be noted that besides vitamine and protein\r\n  deficiencies the lack of inorganic salts should be considered.\r\n\r\n  _Protein Deficiency._—Animal protein is a superior protein and\r\n  maize protein an inferior one. Wilson grades proteins according to\r\n  their assimilability and taking meat protein as 1 he assigns to\r\n  maize protein a relative value of 3.4, which means that one must\r\n  consume 3.4 times as much maize protein as that of meat to obtain\r\n  the necessary protein requirements. Thirty grams of animal protein\r\n  daily is sufficient to maintain nitrogenous equilibrium but Wilson\r\n  considers 40 as a minimum B. P. V. (Biological protein value). We\r\n  should have to consume 136 grams of maize protein to obtain a B. P.\r\n  value of 40. Where hard labour is required the B. P. V. should be\r\n  50 and when associated with chronic intestinal disease it should be\r\n  as high as 60.\r\n\r\n  Wilson noted a B. P. V. of 23 for males in the diet which caused an\r\n  outbreak of pellagra in Armenian refugees at Port Said. The diet of\r\n  the pellagrous Turkish prisoners in Egypt had a B. P. V. of 33.5.\r\n  It may be stated that zein, the protein of maize, is deficient in\r\n  tryptophane and lysine, two important amino-acids necessary for\r\n  proper nutrition. Chick apparently produced pellagra in a monkey\r\n  fed on a low protein diet (Total protein 8.2 grams, of which all\r\n  but 2.7 grams was from zein.). The monkey was given an abundance of\r\n  accessory food substances in butter, marmite and orange juice.\r\n\r\n  _Amino-acid Deficiency._—In a recent paper Goldberger and Tanner\r\n  note that a low biological protein value is not necessarily\r\n  indicative of a pellagra-producing diet. In a series of experiments\r\n  the deficiency of vitamines did not seem to be related to pellagra\r\n  production and the same was true of the mineral elements. In\r\n  studying the nature of low protein biological values they were of\r\n  the opinion that this rested in certain amino-acid deficiencies in\r\n  the proteins consumed by the pellagrins. Benefit seemed to result\r\n  from administering cystine to two cases of pellagra and in a third\r\n  case there was steady improvement following the giving of both\r\n  cystine and tryptophane.\r\n\r\n  It is a question whether zein, the principal protein of maize,\r\n  contains any cystine.\r\n\r\n  Goldberger and his colleagues, after a careful investigation of\r\n  pellagra epidemiology, decided that such facts as the complete\r\n  absence of the disease among the nurses and attendants of the\r\n  pellagrous insane, or among the prison guards of institutions where\r\n  pellagra prevailed extensively, as well as among those caring for\r\n  pellagrous orphans, indicated that a dietary factor rather than\r\n  an infectious one was operative in the disease. Even where it was\r\n  stated that attendants and inmates of institutions had the same\r\n  dietary investigation indicated that as a matter of fact the insane\r\n  and the prisoners were not as well fed as the other group. Then too\r\n  the insane frequently fail to avail themselves of the food provided.\r\n\r\nA study of the records of the Army and Navy of the United States\r\nfailed to show that a single case of pellagra had ever developed\r\namong the personnel, although large numbers of the men came from\r\npellagrous districts of the South. This exemption they thought due to\r\nthe generous service ration.\r\n\r\n  In an investigation of the diet of the workingman’s family in the\r\n  North and South it was found that the southern one consumed much\r\n  larger quantities of starches and fats than the northern one, but\r\n  less fresh meat. In the family of the cotton mill operative, a\r\n  class showing a great incidence of pellagra, corn bread, flour\r\n  biscuits, and fat pork were the chief articles of diet. There is\r\n  a great deal of ancylostomiasis among these cotton mill people\r\n  and the debilitating effect of this disease may predispose to\r\n  pellagra. The general rise in the cost of food and, in particular,\r\n  the disproportionate increase in price of meats over cereals, since\r\n  1907, may explain the greater incidence of the disease since that\r\n  time. The wages of southern mill operators have also suffered on\r\n  account of frequent periods of financial depression during the last\r\n  ten years, thus causing them to buy cereals rather than meats.\r\n\r\n_Goldberger’s Experiment._—In February, 1915, Goldberger started\r\na “pellagra squad,” consisting of 11 prisoners on a diet of wheat\r\nflour (patent), corn meal, corn grits, corn starch, polished rice,\r\ngranulated sugar, cane syrup, sweet potatoes, fat fried out of salt\r\npork, cabbage, collards, turnip greens and coffee. Baking powder was\r\nused for making biscuits and corn bread. The food value of each man’s\r\ndiet averaged 2952 calories.\r\n\r\n  A control was carried out with prisoners on a normal diet. The\r\n  experiment was continued until Oct. 31, 1915. Of the 11 volunteers\r\n  on the excessive carbohydrate diet six developed symptoms. Loss\r\n  of weight and strength and mild neurasthenia were early symptoms.\r\n  Definite cutaneous manifestations appeared only after five months.\r\n  The skin lesions were first noted on the scrotum, later appearing\r\n  on backs of hands in two cases and back of neck in one case.\r\n\r\n  There are those who believe that the methods of preserving foods,\r\n  cereal or proteid, by sterilizing at high temperatures, destroy\r\n  the vitamines so essential to proper metabolism so that people\r\n  who subsist extensively on canned vegetables and preserved meats,\r\n  instead of fresh meats and vegetables, may develop pellagra.\r\n  Evidence of this sort is obtainable in the mill villages of the\r\n  Southern States of the United States where pellagra is so very\r\n  prevalent.\r\n\r\nWe are now beginning to recognize that slight and vague digestive\r\ntrouble may be pellagrous in nature although never going on to the\r\ndevelopment of the cutaneous, neurological and alimentary tract\r\ndiagnostic triad of symptoms.\r\n\r\n  Again there would appear to be efficient resistance to pellagra\r\n  in those who are in good physical condition, but when reduced\r\n  by illness, or the effects of poor diet and defective hygienic\r\n  surroundings, they may develop it. There are those who think that\r\n  hookworm disease is an important factor in predisposing to pellagra.\r\n\r\n  Not only does alcoholism, when coexistent with pellagra, make for\r\n  a bad prognosis but there are many who think that any abuse of\r\n  alcohol predisposes to pellagra. Against this however is the fact\r\n  that pellagra in the United States is about five times as common\r\n  among women as among men. It is generally recognized that pregnancy\r\n  and lactation predispose to pellagra.\r\n\r\n  _Pellagra in Turkish and German Prisoners._—There were (up to\r\n  the close of 1919) 9257 cases of pellagra among 105,668 Turkish\r\n  prisoners (1 in 11) and 79 cases among 7606 German prisoners (1\r\n  in 96). The Turkish prisoners had been on a deficient diet before\r\n  capture and the diet after capture had a B. P. V. of 33.5. The\r\n  labour group of the prisoners had a B. P. V. of 36.8 and the\r\n  disease was much more prevalent among them than in those not\r\n  working. Hammond-Searle notes that the diet of the nonworking\r\n  European prisoners was probably insufficient to prevent pellagra.\r\n  On the average the disease appeared among the German prisoners 4½\r\n  months after capture. They stated that while in Turkey their diet\r\n  had been excellent but almost all had suffered from dysentery or\r\n  malaria. In the Turkish prisoners diarrhoea was a prominent feature\r\n  and Bigland suggests a possible toxin action resulting from a\r\n  damaged intestinal mucosa. Stools from pellagrous Turkish prisoners\r\n  showed organisms similar to _B. perfringens_ in 90% of cases while\r\n  such organisms were not found in the stools of healthy prisoners.\r\n\r\n_The Zeistic Views._—The idea which was at one time entertained\r\nthat maize, whether good or bad, brought on pellagra has now been\r\ngenerally abandoned, owing to investigations, which proved that corn\r\npossessed a fair nutritive value and was easily assimilable, together\r\nwith evidence to show that where care was taken in the maturing of\r\nthe grain and the prevention of decomposition by moulds or bacteria,\r\npellagra was either nonexistent or diminished in a district where\r\nsuch measures were instituted.\r\n\r\n  The statement is frequently seen that pellagra did not make its\r\n  appearance in Europe until after the introduction of maize,\r\n  subsequent to the discovery of the New World. There are authors who\r\n  think Casal was suspicious of a maize dietary.\r\n\r\n  The zeistic views now incorporate some additional factor with the\r\n  basic one of a rather exclusive maize dietary.\r\n\r\n  1. The verderame theory of Ballardini. From noting on the corn\r\n  grains a covering with a greenish mould, Ballardini in 1845\r\n  advanced the view that pellagra was due to this mould and from\r\n  this time on we have the so-called zeitoxic views, which hold that\r\n  pellagra is caused by spoiled corn. Ceni and Fossati regard a toxin\r\n  elaborated by various moulds as causative. The fungi toward which\r\n  attention has been chiefly directed are _Aspergillus fumigatus_ and\r\n  _A. flavescens_ as well as certain species of _Penicillium_ and\r\n  _Mucor_.\r\n\r\n  2. The Lombroso view that as a result of the action of moulds or\r\n  bacteria, toxins are elaborated which, when ingested, give rise to\r\n  the disease.\r\n\r\n  3. That the toxins have origin in the action of various organisms,\r\n  especially _B. coli_, on the ingested corn, while in the intestines.\r\n\r\n  4. Recently views have been brought forward that pellagra is an\r\n  anaphylactic phenomenon connected with sensitization to the maize\r\n  proteins.\r\n\r\n  5. Rabitschek has brought forward a photodynamic theory which is\r\n  that pellagra is due to a preponderating maize or possibly other\r\n  cereal dietary which results in certain photodynamic substances\r\n  being introduced into the circulation. These substances become\r\n  toxic under the influence of sunlight. Hirschfelder has failed to\r\n  find any fluorescent body in the serum of five patients suffering\r\n  with severe pellagra.\r\n\r\nAmong arguments in favor of the maize etiology of pellagra may be\r\nmentioned the following:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Among the natives of Upper Egypt, where millet instead of\r\n  maize is the staple cereal, pellagra is rare, while in Lower Egypt\r\n  where much maize is eaten the disease is far more prevalent.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) While the natives of Corfu, prior to 1857, grew their own\r\n  maize and ate only sound grains there was no pellagra but later,\r\n  when the corn crop was less profitable, and the grain was imported\r\n  from Roumania, much spoiled maize was brought in and pellagra made\r\n  its appearance.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Alsberg has shown that in recent years new methods of\r\n  harvesting corn have become common in the Southern States of the\r\n  United States. Instead of topping the corn it is cut and shocked\r\n  with the result that conditions are more favorable for the spoiling\r\n  of the corn. He also notes that varieties of corn are now planted\r\n  which have a greater oil content, which means a larger embryo, and\r\n  that it is this embryo which most easily spoils. Again he notes\r\n  that much corn is now raised in Northern States where the season\r\n  is shorter, so that there is a greater probability of immature\r\n  corn being marketed. All of these facts might explain the recent\r\n  appearance of pellagra in the U. S. and its previous nonexistence.\r\n  Thomas has shown that where 30 grams of a _superior protein_, such\r\n  as that of meat, would suffice, it would require 102 grams of corn\r\n  protein, an _inferior protein_. This inferiority is due to a lack\r\n  of assimilability of the amino-acids of corn protein. Protein\r\n  deficiency is the outstanding feature of a pellagra-producing diet\r\n  and in the corn protein we have one of inferior value.\r\n\r\n_The Antizeistic Views._—As a rule the advocates of nonimportance\r\nof maize in the production of pellagra hold that we are dealing with\r\nan infectious disease and that it can only come into existence by\r\ntransmission from some other case.\r\n\r\n  1. The Thompson-McFadden Commission, while holding a very\r\n  conservative attitude, feel that certain faecal bacteria may be the\r\n  etiological factors.\r\n\r\n  2. Alessandrini believes that the causative factor may be present\r\n  in certain waters.\r\n\r\n  These views are that colloidal silica in water is responsible\r\n  for the disease. Voegtlin noted the great amount of aluminium\r\n  in certain vegetables and suggested this as the toxic causative\r\n  substance. A mixture of colloidal alumina and silica in water is\r\n  supposed to be operative as well as silica alone. Against the\r\n  colloidal silica hypothesis is the statement of Sandwith that the\r\n  water of the Nile, the drinking water of Egypt, is low in colloidal\r\n  silica content.\r\n\r\n  3. Long has suggested that amoebae may be the cause.\r\n\r\n  4. Tizzoni has incriminated a streptobacillus which he stated he\r\n  found in the blood and organs of pellagrins as well as growing on\r\n  maize.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—As the result of very careful epidemiological\r\nstudies the Thompson-McFadden Pellagra Commission came to the\r\nconclusion that there was evidence against the transmission of\r\npellagra by ticks, lice, bedbugs, cockroaches, fleas, mosquitoes and\r\nbuffalo gnats (_Simulium_).\r\n\r\nThey were rather disposed to consider that the disease showed a\r\ngreater prevalence where the disposal of faeces was unhygienic, as\r\nin unsanitary privies, and that the existence of an efficient water\r\nsewerage system prevented pellagra. If faecal bacteria should act\r\nas infectious agents then the house fly would possibly be worthy of\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n  Many of the peculiarities of sex and place distribution could be\r\n  explained by the stable fly, _Stomoxys calcitrans_, a fly which\r\n  bites viciously in the district in which they worked. This fly\r\n  bites only by day and is intimately associated with human dwellings\r\n  so that the greater incidence of the disease in the women, who stay\r\n  at home, as against an incidence five times less in the men who\r\n  work in the mill during the day might be explained by _Stomoxys_\r\n  bites.\r\n\r\nAt the same time their failure to transmit pellagra to monkeys by\r\ninjections of defibrinated pellagra blood would militate against any\r\ninfectious agent existing in the blood. It may be stated that Harris\r\nhas claimed to have produced a disease resembling pellagra in two\r\nmonkeys by injecting filtrates from emulsions of brain, skin and\r\nintestinal tract of cases dying of pellagra.\r\n\r\n  Lavinder and Francis injected 79 monkeys and 3 baboons with varying\r\n  material from pellagra autopsies. Some of the animals were injected\r\n  with emulsions or Berkefeld filtrates of such emulsions made from\r\n  brain and cord. Other monkeys were inoculated with material from\r\n  skin similarly prepared, others with stomach and mouth mucosal\r\n  emulsions, and still others with intestine and faeces emulsions.\r\n  Blood, urine and cerebro-spinal fluid were also injected. Feeding\r\n  experiments were also carried out. With one exception, and that one\r\n  only suggestive of pellagra, the experiments were negative.\r\n\r\n  Sixteen volunteers, working under Goldberger, tried to infect\r\n  themselves with blood, nasopharyngeal secretions, epidermal scales,\r\n  feces and urine from pellagrins. Various atria of infection were\r\n  tried according to material; blood by intramuscular injection,\r\n  excreta by mouth. After a period of six months all the subjects of\r\n  the experiments remained well. _This evidence is certainly against\r\n  the infectious nature of the disease._\r\n\r\n_Greater Prevalence in Women_.—Now that we attach no weight to\r\ninsect transmission of pellagra we have only the debilitating effects\r\nof menstruation, pregnancy and lactation to explain the marked\r\nsusceptibility shown by women of from seventeen to forty years of\r\nage. Before and beyond these ages the incidence in males and females\r\nis about the same.\r\n\r\n  Before Goldberger began his experiments he was struck by the\r\n  relation poverty had to pellagra epidemiology, and as diet is the\r\n  chief element differentiating poverty and affluence, he chose this\r\n  line of research with the results recorded under etiology. His\r\n  explanation of the greater incidence in adult females, especially\r\n  wives and mothers, was their act of denying themselves the more\r\n  desirable parts of the food.\r\n\r\n  Sandwith has noted the great frequency of pellagra in hookworm\r\n  patients, thus of 300 such cases in Egypt, 46% had pellagra.\r\n\r\n  The Thompson-McFadden Commission was unable to note any evidence\r\n  that would distinctly point to corn, good or bad, as giving rise to\r\n  pellagra outbreaks. They did note, however, a very limited use of\r\n  fresh meats.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very constant or characteristic in the pathological\r\nchanges of pellagra. In the second stage the urine shows an\r\nindicanuria and the faeces an abundance of skatol. The examination of\r\nthe gastric contents gives findings of anacidity and deficiency in\r\npepsin. The HCl deficiency probably causes disturbance of pancreatic\r\nefficiency leading to mal-assimilation of fats and proteins.\r\n\r\nThe blood shows a moderate lymphocytosis but not an increase in the\r\npercentage of the large mononuclears as has been claimed by the\r\nadherents of the protozoon theory.\r\n\r\n  At autopsy we find rather marked emaciation. The wasting of all\r\n  organs seems to be greater than in any other wasting disease. The\r\n  skin lesions show degenerative changes in the corium with slight\r\n  cellular infiltration. In the epidermis there is superficial\r\n  atrophy but still some thickening in the stratum granulosum.\r\n\r\n  Warthin states that the lesions are those of a chronic\r\n  intoxication. The spleen shows atrophy and in the follicles there\r\n  is necrosis of germ cells as well as hyaline changes. The liver and\r\n  kidneys often show fatty change. In general the changes are those\r\n  of a senile character. There is atrophy of the mucosa of the small\r\n  intestines and there may be small ulcers present.\r\n\r\n  The mesenteric glands are enlarged. Roaf has noted the presence\r\n  of involvement of the adrenals and the Committee investigating\r\n  pellagra in Turkish prisoners found a marked supra-renal inadequacy.\r\n\r\nMacroscopically no changes are seen in the central nervous system but\r\nhistologically we often note chromatolysis with bulging of borders,\r\neccentric nucleus and disappearance of tigroid substance in various\r\nnerve cells, especially those of the anterior horn, posterior\r\nganglia, Clark’s column and Betz cells of cortex. There is an absence\r\nof chronic meningo-encephalitis and meningo-myelitis which should be\r\npresent in the general type of protozoal infective lesions.\r\n\r\n  Degenerations in the posterior columns and crossed pyramidal tracts\r\n  have been reported from certain autopsies.\r\n\r\n  The cell count of the cerebro-spinal fluid is normal and there is\r\n  usually an absence of globulin increase with a negative Wassermann.\r\n  The blood chemistry findings in pellagra appear solely to be low\r\n  nonprotein nitrogen and urea values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThere is probably no other disease which shows such a multiplicity of\r\nsymptoms and such variations in these symptoms.\r\n\r\nUpon questioning a patient who has developed a pellagra eruption in\r\nthe spring months there is often obtained a history of more or less\r\nprolonged neurasthenic manifestations during the preceding winter,\r\nchiefly dizziness, insomnia, apprehension, occipital heaviness and\r\nmuscular fatigue. There may also have been previous sensitiveness of\r\nthe mouth and slight epigastric discomfort. Along with the appearance\r\nof the eruption we may have more marked alimentary tract disorders\r\nconsisting of stomatitis, gastric disturbances, especially pyrosis,\r\nwith a recurring diarrhoea. Upon examining the eruption we note\r\nlocalized, sharply delimited, strikingly symmetrical skin lesions of\r\nthose parts of the body which are chiefly exposed to the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\n  This erythema is very similar to sunburn but often follows\r\n  inadequate exposure to the sun and the erythema persists instead\r\n  of fading. Desquamation continues for weeks or months instead of\r\n  healing. The dry scaling area usually shows a striking pigmentation\r\n  at the borders even after the central portions of the erythema have\r\n  cleared up. The skin lesions instead of being dry and atrophic as\r\n  is usual may more rarely be moist and oedematous.\r\n\r\nFrom a vague neurasthenia we have now more distinct neurological\r\nmanifestations such as variations in the reflexes, tremors,\r\nespecially of tongue, head and upper extremities and a depressed\r\nmental state with lack of mental concentration or lapses of memory.\r\nLater on we may have a toxic psychosis in which mutism is often noted\r\nin a mental state characteristically melancholic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.—Marked symmetry of all lesions. Illinois\r\ncase. (From Lavinder and Babcock.)]\r\n\r\n  A final cachexia, with dementia, loss of control of the vesical\r\n  sphincter and a terminal diarrhoea, marks the end. Recurrences of\r\n  clinical manifestations each spring, or possibly skipping a year,\r\n  are striking features of the disease. While the skin and alimentary\r\n  tract disturbances are usually in abeyance in the winter, this\r\n  holds to less degree with the nervous symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAGNOSTIC TRIAD\r\n\r\nWe may then state that in a typical case we have the diagnostic\r\ntriad or pellagrous symptom-complex of (1) symmetrical sharply\r\ndelimited erythemas of certain portions of the skin surface exposed\r\nto the sun with (2) alimentary tract disturbances of stomatitis,\r\nepigastric and substernal soreness and burning, with pyrosis and a\r\nrecurring diarrhoea and (3) neurological manifestations in which a\r\nprodromal neurasthenia is followed by paraesthesias, in which burning\r\nsensations are prominent, at times leading to suicide by drowning,\r\nwith alterations of deep reflexes, tremors and, in more advanced\r\nstages, a confusional insanity.\r\n\r\n  Burning sensations are noted in mouth, gullet and stomach as well\r\n  as of the skin. Then too a burning sensation may be complained of\r\n  in the area formerly the seat of a pellagrous eruption. The palms\r\n  of the hands and soles of the feet often give a burning sensation.\r\n\r\n  One of the characteristic features of pellagra is the periodic\r\n  recurrences in spring, with almost complete cessation of skin and\r\n  alimentary tract symptoms in the winter and, again, the tendency\r\n  in many cases for one group of symptoms to overshadow the symptoms\r\n  which usually accompany them. These periodic recurrences may well\r\n  be associated with seasonal variation in diet.\r\n\r\n=Stages in Pellagra.=—For many reasons it is peculiarly difficult\r\nto recognize stages but for convenience many authors describe the\r\ndisease under a prodromal, 1st, 2d and 3d stage.\r\n\r\n  These stages have reference solely to the degree of severity of the\r\n  manifestations and a case may never progress beyond the 1st stage,\r\n  although recurring for a number of years. Again a case may rapidly\r\n  progress to the 2d stage and even run through the 3d or cachectic\r\n  stage in a few months. We must not consider these stages as tending\r\n  to follow in sequence as we do in connection with the stages of\r\n  syphilis.\r\n\r\n_The prodromal manifestations_ of neurasthenia, malaise, loss of\r\nweight, loss of strength, vertigo and digestive disturbances would\r\nbe suited to many other diseases, especially tuberculosis, and they\r\nare rarely recognized as belonging to pellagra until the appearance\r\nof typical skin or other symptoms brings about their association with\r\npellagra. There is little definite information as to the period of\r\nincubation although Sandwith places it at from nine to twelve months.\r\n\r\n  In Goldberger’s cases the eruption did not appear until after five\r\n  months on the experimental diet. In the study of cases of pellagra\r\n  occurring among Armenian refugees, and in Turkish prisoners of\r\n  war, oedema was not infrequently noted and its occurrence usually\r\n  preceded the eruption.\r\n\r\n=First Stage.=—In the first stage we note the alimentary tract\r\ndisturbances of sodden fissured conditions at the angles of the\r\nmouth, a large indented tongue with central coating and bare\r\nglistening sides and tips, often with a shiny mucus coating these\r\nred borders and a red buccal mucosa. The fungiform papillae appear\r\nas pinhead red elevations. Later on the tongue becomes bare, red and\r\nfissured. There is often an increased flow of saliva. Aphthous ulcers\r\nare less common than in sprue. The gums are often quite tender and in\r\ncases where they are somewhat spongy and swollen, with a tendency to\r\nbleed, we note the appropriateness of “Alpine scurvy” as a synonym\r\nfor pellagra.\r\n\r\n  In cases with very severe stomatitis there may be enlargement\r\n  of the salivary glands. The pharynx is congested and a similar\r\n  condition of the oesophagus gives rise to a burning sensation which\r\n  is often described by the patient as going up the gullet from the\r\n  stomach.\r\n\r\n  Gastric disturbances, especially gastralgia, pyrosis and\r\n  eructations, may be pronounced. Anacidity and deficiency of\r\n  pepsin are noted in gastric juice examinations. The intestinal\r\n  symptoms are those of recurring diarrhoea or occasionally of a mild\r\n  dysentery but in many cases there is a normal functioning of the\r\n  bowels. Although the skin manifestations usually follow those of\r\n  the alimentary tract they may precede them or occur simultaneously.\r\n\r\n_The Eruption._—It is usual to designate the skin lesions of the\r\nfirst stage as erythematous, in that they resemble a sunburn. These\r\npellagrous eruptions may follow some source of skin irritation as\r\nwell as that from exposure to the sun; thus the perianal, perineal,\r\nvulvar, and even scrotal regions may show a marked erythema from\r\nthe slight irritation of the rubbing of clothes or opposite parts.\r\nChemical irritants may also be operative.\r\n\r\n  The pellagrous erythema shows itself most commonly during the late\r\n  spring or early summer. It may appear in the early spring or late\r\n  summer or early fall, but only exceptionally does it occur in the\r\n  winter. There are, however, alterations in the skin previously\r\n  involved which can at times be noted during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe typical eruption, however, is that which shows itself on the\r\nbacks of the hands or running up beyond the wrist to the lower third\r\nof the forearm. The phalanges and especially the knuckles may also\r\nshow the eruption. On the face the eruption is most common over\r\nthe bridge of the nose, on the cheeks and forehead. There may be\r\nspots back of the ears or on the nape of the neck. Occasionally the\r\nbutterfly outline of lupus erythematosus is seen. The face may show\r\nthe so-called pellagrous mask. On the neck we may have a band-like\r\neruption extending to the upper part of the sternum (Casal’s\r\nnecklace) or the erythema may extend down the sternum (cravat).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.—Dry dermatitis on face, hand, neck and upper\r\nchest. Egyptian case. (From Lavinder and Babcock.)]\r\n\r\n  Very important were the observations of Goldberger that in his\r\n  six experimental cases the eruption first showed itself as a\r\n  symmetrical involvement of the sides of the scrotum.\r\n\r\n  On the feet the dorsal eruption does not usually go above the\r\n  malleoli and rarely involves the dorsal surfaces of the external\r\n  toes although rather commonly affecting the great toe. In the U. S.\r\n  the eruption may extend up the front and back of the leg (boot).\r\n  The soles of the feet and palms of the hands are not infrequently\r\n  involved in American cases as is also true of the tip of the elbow.\r\n\r\n  The eruption on the elbows rarely occurs until the patient takes\r\n  to his bed and is probably incident to irritation over olecranon.\r\n  Sandwith states that the skin lesions in Egypt are more widespread\r\n  than those seen in Italy.\r\n\r\nThese skin eruptions show striking symmetry, marked delimitation from\r\nunaffected skin, with often more intense pigmentation at the border\r\nline, and they burn rather than itch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.—“Butterfly” eruption on face of child two\r\nyears old. (Deaderick and Thompson.)]\r\n\r\n  In 1679 cases of pellagra Merk found 77% with eruption solely on\r\n  backs of hands, 13% on backs of hands and neck, 8% on neck alone.\r\n  The eruptions on dorsal surfaces of feet and calves of legs are\r\n  chiefly seen in barefooted children. In the pellagra cases among\r\n  Turkish prisoners Bigland noted an eruption on the hands in all\r\n  but one of 232 cases. Rashes on the feet were noted in 111 cases\r\n  and rashes on the face with bilateral symmetry were observed in 47\r\n  cases. One case showed a scrotal eruption.\r\n\r\n  The more advanced skin lesions are those of a dermatitis rather\r\n  than an erythema. The affected skin is at first of a dull red\r\n  color like a sunburn and later becomes reddish-brown or livid\r\n  or chocolate-colored. Fox has likened the eruption to that of a\r\n  carbolic acid burn.\r\n\r\n  The normal elasticity is lost and the area appears as a dry, scaly,\r\n  atrophic patch—it is the skin of a very old man. The moist\r\n  oedematous skin lesions are far more common in the U. S. than\r\n  elsewhere and may show bullae and even gangrene. Such cases may\r\n  show the gauntlet desquamation.\r\n\r\n_The nervous symptoms_ of this stage are chiefly vertigo, headaches,\r\nwhich are usually occipital, and depression of spirits. Insomnia may\r\nbe a marked feature. Lack of mental concentration is often noted.\r\n\r\n=Second Stage.=—In the second stage we have a continuation and\r\naggravation of the skin and alimentary tract symptoms with pronounced\r\nneurological manifestations. Tremors of the tongue and hands appear.\r\nThere is great muscular weakness of the legs. Paraesthesias in great\r\nvariety are common. Pain on pressure in the dorsal and lumbar regions\r\nof the back is common. The gait is more that of marked muscular\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\n  Attacks of giddiness with tendency to fall forward or backward are\r\n  often reported. The deep reflexes may show variations from normal\r\n  and there may be variations in the reflexes of the two sides, thus\r\n  the patellar reflex on one side may be exaggerated and that on the\r\n  other normal or diminished. Ankle clonus is rare. Neurological\r\n  manifestations are slight in pellagrous children, the main symptoms\r\n  being the cutaneous ones.\r\n\r\nThe mental state is confused and the patient shows depression\r\nand is often morose. The most common psychosis is that of simple\r\nretardation. The patient answers questions in monosyllables and in a\r\nlow tone of voice after a more or less prolonged delay. Goldberger\r\nstates that mental disturbances sufficient to require institutional\r\ncare do not occur in more than 2 or 3% of cases.\r\n\r\n  In the second stage the urine shows rather marked indicanuria and\r\n  the faeces contain an excess of skatol. Loss of weight is as marked\r\n  a feature of pellagra as of tuberculosis. Well nourished pellagrins\r\n  are the exceptions.\r\n\r\n=Third Stage.=—With the setting in of a confusional insanity and a\r\nterminal cachexia we have the third and last stage of the disease.\r\nOn account of so many of the victims of pellagra becoming inmates of\r\ninsane asylums the disease is peculiarly dreaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.—Wet dermatitis. Localization usual. Hands\r\noedematous. Cachectic state. South Carolina case. (From Lavinder and\r\nBabcock.)]\r\n\r\n  Pellagra often runs a rather acute course in the U. S., the patient\r\n  dying within two or three months. The usual course in Europe is one\r\n  prolonged over years, with at times intermissions covering one or\r\n  more years.\r\n\r\n  A form of pellagra known as typhoid pellagra often shows a high\r\n  fever with symptoms more or less resembling a very toxic case of\r\n  typhoid.\r\n\r\n  A mental state resembling the acute delirium of paresis may be\r\n  present. Such states are often terminal. The usual course of\r\n  pellagra is afebrile. Such terms as _pellagra sine pellagra_\r\n  are given to cases which may not show the skin lesions and the\r\n  designation _pseudopellagra_ has usually been used by those who\r\n  insist upon limiting the name pellagra to those cases which fit\r\n  in with their special etiological views so that cases clinically\r\n  pellagra but in which the special etiological factor does not\r\n  obtain are called pseudopellagra.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  The cutaneous neurological and alimentary tract disturbances have\r\n  each already been separately described in detail.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—Hillman has made very careful blood examinations\r\n  of a series of cases and found a variable degree of chloranaemia\r\n  which however, was not a prominent feature. He notes the occasional\r\n  occurrence of a leucocytosis in the course of the disease. As a\r\n  rule there is a definite lymphocytosis, the average percentage\r\n  of lymphocytes being 33.99. The average percentage for the large\r\n  mononuclears was 2.59. The average percentage of eosinophiles was\r\n  2.73. The determinations of the coagulation time of the blood gave\r\n  normal figures.\r\n\r\n  In Ridlon’s series the average red count was 4,720,000, the\r\n  white count varied from 14,200 to 4200, average 8027. The\r\n  polymorphonuclear percentage averaged 68.2, that of lymphocytes 21,\r\n  of large mononuclears 8 and of eosinophiles 2.\r\n\r\n  Hb percentage averaged 77 and color index 0.81. The blood serum\r\n  failed to give positive Wassermann reactions.\r\n\r\n  _The Urine._—There is rarely any increase in albumin. The most\r\n  important urinary finding is in connection with indicanuria, 96.4%\r\n  of Ridlon’s cases showing this finding. As convalescence comes on\r\n  indicanuria tends to lessen.\r\n\r\n  _The Temperature Chart._—We expect a normal temperature in an\r\n  uncomplicated case of pellagra but in typhoid pellagra and in the\r\n  terminal stages of the disease a fever of from 101° to 103°F. is\r\n  generally noted. Fever makes for a bad prognosis. There is nothing\r\n  special about the circulatory system other than low blood pressure\r\n  and a tendency to vasomotor disturbances. With the genito-urinary\r\n  system other than the rather marked indicanuria, there is nothing\r\n  of note.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the diagnostic triad of cutaneous, nervous and\r\nalimentary tract manifestations there is little difficulty in\r\ndiagnosis but when the skin lesions are absent or only slightly\r\ndeveloped the difficulty is great. One of the most important points\r\nin diagnosis is a history of preceding attacks.\r\n\r\n  There is no reliable laboratory test and the reports as to positive\r\n  reactions following injections of maize extracts seem unreliable.\r\n  Again there do not seem to be any antibodies in the serum of\r\n  pellagrins which can be utilized in serological diagnosis. A\r\n  primary requirement would be a suitable antigen. Competent workers\r\n  have been unable to find any bacterial organism in the blood of\r\n  pellagrins.\r\n\r\n  Erythema multiforme and dermatitis venenata seem to be the skin\r\n  diseases most liable to cause confusion.\r\n\r\n  In old people with arterio-sclerotic changes and consequent mental\r\n  symptoms there may be lesions of the hands or feet of more or less\r\n  gangrenous type, which may be a real source of confusion. The\r\n  lack of sharp delimitation of such lesions and the absence of the\r\n  pellagrous stomatitis should differentiate.\r\n\r\n  Poison ivy dermatitis, if bilateral, may be confusing, as may also\r\n  chapping of the hands.\r\n\r\n  In Italy a disease due to eating ergot-diseased rye meal and\r\n  called ergotism may be a source of confusion as this disease shows\r\n  gangrenous manifestations. The gangrene of ergotism is a dry one.\r\n\r\n  Sprue does not show the dermatitis, and the nervous manifestations\r\n  are solely those of irritability or possibly slight neurasthenia.\r\n  The sprue stool is not found in pellagra. See Diagnosis under Sprue.\r\n\r\n  Typhoid pellagra may be confused with severe typhoid fever or other\r\n  acute infectious diseases or with conditions associated with coma,\r\n  as diabetes or uraemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIt is a risk to venture a prognosis in pellagra because cases\r\nthat seem mild may suddenly become severe. The extent of the skin\r\nlesions does not parallel the severity of the case although moist or\r\ngangrenous dermatitis is usually seen only in severe cases.\r\n\r\n  When fever comes on the prognosis of the case is unfavorable and\r\n  when the mental manifestations are prominent the prognosis is bad.\r\n\r\nThe Italian physicians give a more hopeful prognosis than the\r\nAmerican ones, which is easily understood when it is considered that\r\nAmerican mortality from pellagra is given as from 25 to 39.10%. That\r\nof Italy is certainly below 10% and recent statistics have shown a\r\nmortality of only 3%. In the U. S. the mortality is now below 10%.\r\n\r\n  Of particular importance is the question of the liability to mental\r\n  trouble. Singer states that about 40% of all cases of pellagra\r\n  develop mental disturbances and that this incidence is much higher\r\n  in cases presenting recurrences. In Italy it is estimated that from\r\n  5 to 10% of pellagrins become permanently insane.\r\n\r\nThe earlier a case of pellagra comes under treatment the more\r\nfavorable the prognosis.\r\n\r\n  In the first stage the prognosis is very good but in the second,\r\n  when there is more or less involvement of the central nervous\r\n  system, it is much less favorable. In the third stage, or that\r\n  of the terminal cachexia with marked mental deterioration, the\r\n  prognosis is extremely bad. Each recurring attack makes the\r\n  condition more serious. The older the patient the more serious the\r\n  prognosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—There does not seem to be any satisfactory evidence\r\nas to the contagiousness of pellagra, so that any method involving\r\nisolation is not indicated.\r\n\r\nEven if the use of spoiled corn is not productive of pellagra it is\r\ncertainly advisable to prevent its sale by state regulation.\r\n\r\n  As a proper, well-balanced dietary is an important curative measure\r\n  it is therefore prophylactic.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—In a disease which characteristically shows a marked\r\namelioration in the winter or a disappearance of symptoms for one or\r\nmore years we should be very conservative in attributing improvement\r\nto any drug.\r\n\r\n  At the New York Post Graduate hospital, 17 cases were apparently\r\n  cured on rest in bed and full nutritious diet. Hospital treatment,\r\n  thereby removing the patients from the environment in which the\r\n  disease developed, is generally conceded of the greatest benefit.\r\n\r\nIt is always recommended by the advocates of some special drug\r\ntreatment that the patient be kept on a nutritious diet. Roussel in\r\n1866 stated: “Without dietetic measures all remedies fail.”\r\n\r\n  Many authorities speak highly of arsenic in various forms as\r\n  Fowler’s solution, atoxyl, salvarsan, etc. Others are equally\r\n  pessimistic as to the value of arsenic in any form.\r\n\r\nNiles is a strong advocate of hydrotherapeutic measures. He\r\nrecommends the drinking of two to six glasses of tepid water daily as\r\nwell as colon irrigations, cold abdominal compresses, hot packs and\r\nsaline baths.\r\n\r\n  Deeks prefers to eliminate sugar and starchy food from the dietary\r\n  of pellagrins for a few days at a time and to give fresh fruit\r\n  juices, with broths and milk. He highly recommends dilute nitric\r\n  acid, well diluted, before meals. As there is almost constantly\r\n  anacidity and pepsin deficiency in the gastric juice it would seem\r\n  that this condition should be treated.\r\n\r\n  It is advisable to keep the patient out of the sun and require him\r\n  to take his exercise after sunset.\r\n\r\nDyer recommends ½ to 1 ounce gelatin daily together with the juice of\r\ntwo or more oranges or lemons. He prefers a diet of eggs, milk and\r\nwell-cooked vegetables. He also gives quinine hydrobromate in 3 grain\r\ndoses 3 times daily.\r\n\r\n  Psychotherapy seems to be of importance in the treatment of\r\n  pellagra.\r\n\r\nLavinder says that many people have pellagra because they have some\r\nother condition and when this is cured the pellagra is also cured.\r\n\r\nIn truth, pellagra is very rarely a primary condition. We must then\r\ngive careful attention to the predisposing causes which may not only\r\nbe ancylostomiasis, alcoholism, or malaria, but, as well, various\r\ngynaecological or alimentary tract disorders.\r\n\r\n  With the colloidal silica etiology in view Allesandrino has\r\n  recommended sodium citrate in treatment.\r\n\r\nGoldberger has cited the following as showing the influence of diet:\r\n\r\n  In an orphan asylum with 211 orphans, 68, or 32%, had pellagra.\r\n  These children were divided into 3 groups and given different\r\n  rations, those under six years of age receiving milk and eggs,\r\n  while those over twelve years were given meat, as they assisted in\r\n  the work of the institution. The children between six and twelve\r\n  lived practically on a vegetarian diet in which corn products\r\n  and syrup preponderated with deficiency of legumes. Of 25 young\r\n  children only 2 showed pellagra, and there was but 1 case in the\r\n  66 children over twelve years of age while the 120 between six and\r\n  twelve gave 65 cases or 52%.\r\n\r\nAs the result of increasing the milk supply, so that every child\r\nunder twelve years got a pint daily, also at least one egg daily,\r\ntogether with an increase in the use of beans and peas, as well as\r\nfresh meat, the disease was entirely eradicated. The corn elements\r\nof the diet were reduced but not excluded. There was increase in\r\nproteins and a decrease of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n  As to the diet in pellagra Niles recommends the exclusion of\r\n  all maize articles of diet. He recommends meat, eggs, milk or\r\n  buttermilk with peas and beans. When intestinal symptoms are\r\n  severe he gives barley gruel, rice-water, thick broths and dry\r\n  meat powders. As a drug treatment for diarrhoea he uses bismuth\r\n  beta-naphthol.\r\n\r\n  Babcock, recognizing the importance of the treatment of the\r\n  pellagrous neurasthenia, recommends the Weir-Mitchell plan of\r\n  prolonged rest in bed, nutrition, hydrotherapy and hygienic\r\n  measures. “Fat and blood” should be our aims and he notes the value\r\n  of cacodylate of soda in increasing fat. He also refers to the\r\n  susceptibility to suggestion of pellagrins and is an advocate of\r\n  psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n  Having in mind the vitamine deficiency view Voegtlin has treated\r\n  cases of pellagra with extracts of substances rich in vitamines.\r\n  Extracts prepared from fresh ox liver and fresh hog thymus caused\r\n  definite improvement in pellagrins so treated while extracts of\r\n  yeast and rice polishings seemed to be without value. It will be\r\n  remembered that the glands of animals are rich in fat soluble\r\n  A. For the burning of the erythema Niles recommends a lotion of\r\n  calamine (4 drams), powdered zinc oxide (3 drams), in 1 pint of\r\n  lime water. As regards climatic treatment the same authority\r\n  believes that a colder climate is indicated and that a patient with\r\n  pellagra should avoid hot weather for a year after all symptoms\r\n  have disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSPRUE\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Under the designation sprue we have a form of chronic\r\ndiarrhoea characterized by periods of improvement alternating with\r\na return to the previous condition. The disease is afebrile, of\r\ninsidious onset and first manifests itself by soreness of the buccal\r\nmucosa and vague digestive disturbances.\r\n\r\n  The soreness of mouth and gullet is soon followed by erosions,\r\n  especially at the site of the posterior molars, and a bare raw\r\n  tongue. Exceedingly characteristic are the voluminous, frothy\r\n  stools which are evacuated chiefly in the morning hours. The\r\n  patient becomes weak, emaciated, irritable and of an earthy pallor.\r\n\r\n  The disease chiefly affects Europeans who have lived in Southern\r\n  China, Cochin China and Java, and unless treated early tends to\r\n  progress to a fatal termination.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—The word sprue is a corruption of the Dutch term “spruw”\r\nused to designate this tropical aphtha or aphthous stomatitis. The\r\nname psilosis, meaning bare, was suggested by Thin and is the term\r\nemployed in many books instead of the better recognized designation,\r\nsprue.\r\n\r\nOther designations are: Chronic diarrhoea of the tropics, Ceylon sore\r\nmouth and Cochin China diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—The French (1868-1872) described this disease under\r\n  the name of chronic or endemic diarrhoea of Cochin China and noted\r\n  its resemblance to Moore’s “Hill Diarrhoea.” In 1876 Normand\r\n  incorrectly associated _Strongyloides_ with the disease.\r\n\r\n  The physicians of the Dutch East Indies described the disease under\r\n  the designation “spruw” and Manson in a very complete description\r\n  of the disease called it “sprue,” a corruption of the Dutch name.\r\n\r\n  It is interesting to note that Hillary in 1766, described a similar\r\n  disease of Barbadoes, W. I., which he called aphthoides chronica.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—It is particularly prevalent in South\r\n  China and the East Indies. India and Ceylon are also regions of\r\n  the disease. In the West Indies it has been carefully studied, in\r\n  Porto Rico by Ashford, and of particular interest is the fact that\r\n  Wood has recently insisted on the presence of sprue in the Southern\r\n  States of the U. S. The Philippines and tropical Africa are also\r\n  sections from which the disease is reported.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The cause is unknown. The disease makes its appearance\r\nchiefly in Europeans who have lived many years in the tropics and may\r\nnot show itself until the patient has returned home. (In one case\r\nreported by Thin seventeen years after the return home.)\r\n\r\n  It seems to select those who are weakened by dysentery or other\r\n  debilitating diseases, or who are compelled to subsist on\r\n  indigestible food or to lead a life of exposure to hardships.\r\n  Women in whom the menstrual flow is excessive or who are in the\r\n  period of lactation seem to be especially susceptible. Some think\r\n  alcoholics more susceptible. The idea has been advanced that the\r\n  abuse of calomel has been a factor and this view is one to be given\r\n  weight because it is well recognized that at the present there is\r\n  much less sprue than formerly and with this there has been a more\r\n  rational use of calomel. The excessive use of highly seasoned food,\r\n  so common with Europeans in the tropics, may have an influence.\r\n\r\n  Some have thought that sprue was the manifestation of a tropical\r\n  pancreas; at first congestion and later exhaustion of its function.\r\n  The character of the stools lends support to this view.\r\n\r\n  At one time it was thought that _Strongyloides stercoralis_ was the\r\n  cause; this idea had its origin in the finding of these larvae in\r\n  the stools of a patient with Cochin China diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n  Certain authors have considered bacteria giving a granulose\r\n  staining reaction as the cause while others have thought cocci to\r\n  be concerned.\r\n\r\n  Kohlbrugge found organisms resembling _Oidium albicans_ in the\r\n  intestines, oesophagus and tongue. He found similar organisms in\r\n  the stools and tongue scrapings of cases of sprue. Beneke found\r\n  bacilli in the tongue, oesophagus and intestines and considered\r\n  these as causative, regarding the thrush-like membranous deposit as\r\n  connected with the cachectic state and not causative.\r\n\r\n  Bahr is inclined to believe that _Monilia albicans_ (_Oidium\r\n  albicans_) is the cause, as he found these saccharomycetes in the\r\n  deep layers of the tongue, in the mucoid coating of the intestines\r\n  and in the deposit in the oesophagus. He thinks it the ordinary\r\n  thrush species which may take on greater virulence in the tropics.\r\n  Ashford states that he has found a species of _Monilia_, different\r\n  from that of thrush, almost constantly in tongue scrapings and\r\n  stools of sprue cases and he regards this species as the cause of\r\n  sprue. He states that this organism is common in Porto Rico bread\r\n  and thinks it possible that the disease is transmitted in this way.\r\n  It has been called _Parasaccharomyces ashfordi_. It is a round\r\n  yeast, 4 to 7 microns in diameter. Wood has recently expressed the\r\n  view that sprue is not infrequently mistaken for pellagra in the\r\n  Southern United States.\r\n\r\n  Castellani, in a study of moulds of the genus _Monilia_ in sprue\r\n  stools, holds them responsible for the excessive gas production,\r\n  although not the cause of the disease. Various protozoa, as amoebae\r\n  and spirochaetes, have been considered as possible causes.\r\n\r\n  While there does not seem to be any vitamine deficiency implicated\r\n  yet there is disordered assimilation, which may be due to\r\n  alimentary tract infection or to insufficiency of pancreatic\r\n  functioning. It has been suggested that secretin deficiency is the\r\n  essential disturbance.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—The disease is rare in natives and is entirely\r\nendemic. Some authorities have suggested a greater frequency of the\r\ndisease in those intimately exposed to a case, as in husband and wife\r\nor the members of a family.\r\n\r\n  Sprue is usually a disease of mature life and affects women more\r\n  frequently than men. While climate cannot be considered as causing\r\n  sprue yet the effects of hot climates in producing exhaustion\r\n  states in Europeans must be borne in mind. The sprue patient should\r\n  always leave a tropical climate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nThe changes in the alimentary tract apparently originate in the\r\nstructures lying beneath the epithelial coverings, thus indicating\r\nthat the toxic material acts through the blood rather than as a\r\nsurface irritant to the mucosa. At first there is congestion of the\r\nunderlying connective tissue with a round cell infiltration. Later\r\non the epithelial covering of the alimentary tract suffers and\r\nauto-intoxication, as evidenced by indicanuria, becomes operative.\r\n\r\n  At autopsy the subcutaneous fat is found to have almost\r\n  disappeared. The intestines, especially the ileum, show marked\r\n  thinning, this atrophy especially affecting the mucosa, the surface\r\n  of which is covered by a layer of dirty gray mucus. The submucosa\r\n  generally shows connective-tissue increase. The gut is pale and\r\n  diaphanous. The solitary follicles may show as small cysts filled\r\n  with a gelatinous material or as ulcers.\r\n\r\n  The liver is markedly atrophied. The mesenteric glands are usually\r\n  enlarged. The pancreas may show cirrhotic changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case.=—It is very difficult to obtain definite\r\ninformation as to the onset which is characteristically insidious.\r\n\r\nThere is usually first noted a sensitiveness of the buccal mucosa\r\nso that alcoholic drinks and acid or highly seasoned food cannot be\r\ntaken without marked discomfort. A sense of fulness or distention in\r\nthe epigastric region is often an early symptom. Frequently there\r\nis a history of a rather intractable morning diarrhoea which may\r\nalternate with periods of constipation.\r\n\r\n  The diarrhoeal movements are remarkably copious and soon change\r\n  from bile-colored, liquid evacuations to the characteristic\r\n  putty-colored, pultaceous, gas bubble permeated, offensive stool\r\n  of sprue. While the patient experiences a sense of relief from\r\n  the evacuation of the fermenting mass yet there is at times an\r\n  excoriation about the anus which may cause pain when at stool.\r\n  Neuralgic pains of the region of the anus may be present late in\r\n  the disease.\r\n\r\n  When examined microscopically the stools are found to show much\r\n  fat, yeasts and undigested food. The fats are chiefly in the form\r\n  of neutral fats and fatty acids rather than as soaps. The reaction\r\n  is acid. Nausea and vomiting, especially about noon, may be\r\n  complained of.\r\n\r\nWhile the characteristic stools best show the full development of the\r\ndisease there are also changes noted in tongue and buccal mucosa.\r\nFollowing the marked sensitiveness of the mouth above noted there\r\nsoon appears a redness of the sides and tip of the tongue with a\r\nglistening coating of the surface. Small vesicles later becoming\r\nsuperficial erosions develop along the tongue borders, frenum and\r\nbuccal mucosa.\r\n\r\n  There is also congestion and swelling of the fungiform papillae.\r\n\r\nVery characteristic are ulcers at the site of the rear molars\r\n(Crombie’s ulcers). Later on the tongue becomes bare, fissured and\r\neven glazed, as if varnished.\r\n\r\n  The gullet may be raw and very sensitive. The appetite is apt to be\r\n  capricious and the patient may be very intractable, insisting upon\r\n  dietary indiscretions which he knows will aggravate his condition.\r\n  There is a progressive loss of strength, weight and energy. The\r\n  liver progressively diminishes in size but is difficult to map out\r\n  owing to the bulging, dough-like abdominal contents. The urine is\r\n  usually free of albumen but shows marked indicanuria. Sprue is\r\n  characteristically afebrile.\r\n\r\n  Anaemia becomes marked, the red cells going as low at times as\r\n  under 2,000,000, per cmm. and the Hb. percentage less markedly\r\n  reduced (color index above 1). The polymorphonuclears are reduced\r\n  in percentage.\r\n\r\n  There is a tendency to depression and irritability.\r\n\r\n  The period during which sprue runs its course is very variable.\r\n  Some cases drag on for ten or twelve years while others may be\r\n  subacute in type, death ensuing within a year or two.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the typical or complete sprue described above Bahr\r\nwould add: (1) _Incomplete sprue_, in which with typical stools there\r\nis no abnormal appearance of the tongue, and (2) _Tongue sprue_, in\r\nwhich with characteristic mouth involvement there is absence of the\r\nsprue stool.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _The Stomatitis._—At first we have a disagreeable bitter taste\r\n  in an unusually sensitive mouth. Later there develop superficial\r\n  ulcers along the sides and frenum of the tongue, which subsequently\r\n  involve the buccal mucosa. The gums may be quite tender and saliva\r\n  dribble from the mouth.\r\n\r\n  In the later stages the tongue becomes bare, red, fissured and\r\n  glazed.\r\n\r\n  _The Stools._—Commencing as early morning diarrhoea, with at times\r\n  alternating constipation, there gradually sets in that which makes\r\n  for a diagnosis of sprue—putty-colored, fermenting, offensive\r\n  stools which are extraordinarily copious.\r\n\r\n  They are also very fatty and of acid reaction. They show a proteid\r\n  loss as well as lack of fat absorption.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood Findings._—There is a marked secondary anaemia with\r\n  great reduction in red cells and Hb. percentage.\r\n\r\n  The color index averages higher than normal and with the\r\n  poikilocytosis resembles the blood picture of an atypical\r\n  pernicious anaemia. Nucleated reds are rarely found. The\r\n  eosinophiles are reduced in percentage. The polymorphonuclears\r\n  often show a great number of nodes, as 7 or 8 instead of the\r\n  ordinary three.\r\n\r\n  There is a mononuclear increase with polymorphonuclear reduction.\r\n  The white count is somewhat below normal—4000 to 6000.\r\n\r\n  _Other Features of the Disease._—The liver is notably diminished\r\n  in size. The urine shows indicanuria. The patient has a dry earthy\r\n  skin and may show oedema about ankles.\r\n\r\n  Mentally there is lack of concentration with marked irritability\r\n  and moroseness. Tetany has been reported as occurring rarely in\r\n  very severe cases. The abdomen is doughy and the temperature in the\r\n  later stages tends to become subnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n_Thrush_ is characterized by the membranous coating which\r\nmicroscopically shows the fungus. It also is chiefly a disease of\r\nchildren and those who live under wretched hygienic conditions and\r\nwith insufficient food. The characteristic stools are absent.\r\n\r\n  _Pellagra._—The stomatitis, diarrhoea and mental irritability are\r\n  very similar in the two diseases. There is, however, absence of the\r\n  sprue stools in pellagra and the periodical recurrence and skin\r\n  manifestations of pellagra are absent in sprue.\r\n\r\n  Wood thinks that in the absence of any evidences of organic nervous\r\n  disease in sprue we have an important differentiation as he finds\r\n  that pellagra has as great a tendency to invade the nervous system\r\n  as has syphilis. Salivation is marked in pellagra, not in sprue.\r\n  The two diseases, however, are best differentiated by the darker,\r\n  more fluid, less copious stool of pellagra as contrasted with the\r\n  copious, light colored stool of sprue. Stools containing great\r\n  amounts of undigested fat are most characteristic of sprue; fat\r\n  absorption in pellagra is about normal (95%) while in sprue it is\r\n  only about 75%.\r\n\r\n  _Syphilis_ with its buccal mucous patches or geographical tongue\r\n  may be mistaken for tongue sprue.\r\n\r\n=Hill Diarrhoea.=—Many authorities do not consider this as a disease\r\ndistinct from sprue. The English, however, note the features of\r\nits occurrence only at high altitudes; thus persons going to Simla\r\nsuffer from hill diarrhoea but upon their return to the sea level the\r\ndisease disappears. The characteristic features of hill diarrhoea\r\nor Simla trot, as it is often called, are the passage of from 2 to\r\n6 watery, whitish stools in the early morning hours. The patient is\r\nusually free from diarrhoea in the afternoon. The color may resemble\r\nthat of freshly made whitewash, hence diarrhoea alba.\r\n\r\n  At first it is only the annoyance that is complained of but later\r\n  on the appetite is lost and the patient becomes weak.\r\n\r\n  There is an absence of the sprue mouth. The laboratory diagnosis,\r\n  other than the finding of excess of fatty acids, soaps, undigested\r\n  food remnants and yeasts is unimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nWhile the disease responds to treatment in those who are not too far\r\nadvanced yet it always should be considered a serious affection. The\r\nchances of a complete restoration to health are better for those who\r\ncan leave the tropics and reside permanently elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the patient possess the will power to carry out\r\nthe course of treatment; the clothing should be of wool to prevent\r\nchilling and the patient should remain in bed until his condition has\r\ndecidedly improved.\r\n\r\n  _The Milk Treatment._—A preliminary dose of castor oil is given\r\n  and when this acts the patient should begin taking milk as the sole\r\n  food. At first about 4 pints of skimmed milk are given daily. The\r\n  milk should be given in two-hour feedings, well warmed and taken\r\n  through a glass tube or with a teaspoon—it should not be drunk. As\r\n  the stools become less frothy the amount of milk is increased so\r\n  that the patient takes from 6 to 7 pints daily. Milk should be the\r\n  sole food for six weeks from the time the stools become solid and\r\n  the mouth symptoms disappear. Rele prefers buttermilk to skimmed\r\n  milk. Eggs are usually well borne after the milk course. Stale\r\n  bread or toast is cautiously added and then some fish or chicken.\r\n\r\n  At times the patient seems benefited by giving a meat treatment day\r\n  once or twice a week during the course of the milk treatment.\r\n\r\n  _Meat Treatment._—If the patient is very ill it may be advisable,\r\n  after the preliminary dose of castor oil, to give meat juice\r\n  obtained by expressing the juice from slightly broiled meat, about\r\n  2 teaspoonfuls every half hour. If possible however one starts in\r\n  with the meat cure, which is about 4 ounces of a lightly broiled\r\n  chopped-up beefsteak, every four hours. Raw meat is usually given\r\n  in this treatment but there is danger of _T. saginata_ infection.\r\n\r\n  At least 4 pints of warm water should be taken daily but not at the\r\n  same time the patient eats the meat. Rest in bed and the avoidance\r\n  of chilling are important measures. In all food treatments we\r\n  should avoid forcing the patient to eat—it is better to give food\r\n  only when the patient desires it.\r\n\r\n  Some prefer to alternate the milk treatment with the meat one.\r\n\r\n  _Fruit Treatment._—The patient is allowed fruit in great\r\n  abundance. Strawberries, peaches, grapes, ripe gooseberries\r\n  and fully ripe bananas are usually recommended. Papayas are\r\n  particularly well suited. Pomegranates are also highly recommended.\r\n  Sour or fibrous fruits should be avoided. Strawberries and milk are\r\n  highly advocated. Cooked strawberries or other cooked fruits do\r\n  not benefit the patient, the curative principle being apparently\r\n  destroyed by heating. At all times alcoholic drinks and highly\r\n  spiced foods should be avoided.\r\n\r\n  The only drug that has been advocated to any extent is yellow\r\n  santonin, in doses of 5 grains, night and morning. It is very\r\n  doubtful if any drug treatment is of the least value.\r\n\r\n  LeDantec, with the elimination of the granulose bacteria in mind,\r\n  has recommended the cutting off of carbohydrates and the giving\r\n  of a strictly albuminous diet. Subsequently he gives lactic acid\r\n  producers as contained in _Bacillus bulgaricus_ preparations.\r\n\r\n  Schmitter has recommended emetine in the treatment of sprue, but\r\n  Ashford has found this drug, as well as santonin, of negative\r\n  value. Brown has had success in treating a case of sprue with\r\n  pancreatin, 30 grains daily. Since then he has had marked success\r\n  in three other cases. He now combines the pancreatic extract with\r\n  calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n  In connection with Ashford’s work with a specific _Monilia, M.\r\n  psilosis_, cases of sprue have been treated with vaccines made from\r\n  this organism.\r\n\r\n  An autolysate of the cultures is sterilized at 56°C. for an hour\r\n  and then centrifugalized. A one per cent. suspension of the\r\n  sediment is used for injection increasing from about 0.1 cc. to 1\r\n  cc. at weekly intervals. Five or six injections are given.\r\n\r\n  It is stated that the symptoms at the start of the treatment are\r\n  aggravated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV\r\n\r\nHELMINTHIC INFECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nANCYLOSTOMIASIS\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—It is very probable that hookworm disease existed in\r\nEgypt in the remote past and it has been claimed that a disease\r\nmentioned in the Ebers Papyrus was of that nature.\r\n\r\n  Goeze found a hookworm in a badger in 1782. He named the parasite\r\n  _Ascaris criniformis_. Froelich, in 1789, found hookworms in\r\n  the fox and named them hookworms from the hook-like ribs of the\r\n  copulatory bursa. He proposed the generic name _Uncinaria_.\r\n  Therefore _Uncinaria_ belongs to the hookworms of the fox and is\r\n  not valid for any human species.\r\n\r\n  In 1838, Dubini noted that these worms were generally found in\r\n  very anaemic cases and that the mucosa of the duodenum or jejunum\r\n  frequently showed punctate haemorrhages. On account of the four\r\n  ventral teeth projecting from the mouth he gave it the name\r\n  _Agchylostoma_ or correctly _Ancylostoma_.\r\n\r\n  In 1854 Griesinger, as a result of frequently noting the lesions\r\n  produced by the worms, stated that they were the cause of Egyptian\r\n  chlorosis. In 1866, Wucherer connected hookworms with a disease\r\n  of Brazil called opilacao. In 1878 Grassi noted that the disease\r\n  could be diagnosed by the finding of the characteristic eggs in the\r\n  stools of patients.\r\n\r\nIt was the prevalence of a severe anaemia among the workmen employed\r\nin the construction of the St. Gothard tunnel, which Perroncito\r\nproved to be due to hookworm infection, that established the great\r\nimportance of this parasitic disease as the cause of a severe and\r\nfatal anaemia (1879). About the same time it became generally\r\nconsidered that the anaemias which affected workmen in mines were of\r\na similar nature.\r\n\r\n  That the disease was very prevalent in the Southern States of the\r\n  U. S., as long ago as 1849, is shown by the writings of Duncan,\r\n  who noted the frequency of anaemia, often associated with dirt\r\n  eating, among the slaves. He described the oedematous legs, the\r\n  protuberant belly and cardiac palpitation. There were several\r\n  cases reported in the U. S. from 1893-1897 but they were mainly in\r\n  foreigners.\r\n\r\n  From 1895 to 1901, Stiles kept insisting that hookworm disease\r\n  should be of frequent occurrence in the U. S.\r\n\r\n  A. J. Smith found several cases in persons living in Texas and\r\n  recognized the fact that these hookworms were different from\r\n  those of Europe. It was from a study of material from Smith and\r\n  Claytor in the U. S. and, later on, from Ashford in Porto Rico,\r\n  that Stiles, in 1902, reported a new genus of hookworm as existing\r\n  in man. It was first named _Uncinaria americana_ but _Uncinaria_,\r\n  belonging to the hookworm of the fox, was not valid, so he changed\r\n  the name to _Necator americanus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—Geographical distribution of\r\nAncylostomiasis. Stars show where disease is widely prevalent.\r\nTriangles, where less so.]\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The disease is rare outside the\r\n  tropical and subtropical countries except in mines or tunnels where\r\n  suitable conditions of warmth and moisture exist.\r\n\r\n  It is extremely prevalent in India and Egypt as well as in China\r\n  and other parts of the East. It is a very important infection\r\n  in Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands. It is extensively\r\n  distributed in South America, especially Brazil, as well as in\r\n  Central America, Mexico and the Southern States of the U. S. The\r\n  inhabitants of many of the islands of the Pacific are heavily\r\n  infested. Hookworm disease is common in southern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The hookworm infections of man come almost entirely\r\nfrom two parasites, _Ancylostoma duodenale_, the Old World species,\r\nand _Necator americanus_, which is generally called the New World\r\nspecies from its having first been reported from the U. S. by Stiles.\r\nHookworms belong to the class Nematoda and family Strongylidae.\r\n\r\n  Quite recently Lane has reported a new species, _A. ceylanicum_, as\r\n  having been obtained from 3 men in Bengal, after treatment. This\r\n  species is the one that infects the civet cat in Ceylon. So far as\r\n  we know the other human species belong solely to man.\r\n\r\nThe male hookworms are a little more than ⅓ of an inch (9 mm.) long\r\nand the females a little more than ½ inch (13 mm.) in length. The\r\nmales can readily be distinguished by their posterior, umbrella-like\r\nexpansion or copulatory bursa. The tail of the female is pointed.\r\nThe vulva of _A. duodenale_ is located in lower half of the ventral\r\nsurface; that of _N. americanus_ in upper half. The large, oval mouth\r\nof the Old World hookworm has four claw-like teeth on the ventral\r\nside of the buccal cavity and two knob-like teeth on the dorsal\r\naspect. It also has a pair of ventral lancets below the four ventral\r\nteeth. One cannot make out a dorso-median tooth. In _N. americanus_\r\nthe buccal capsule is round, smaller and the ventral teeth are\r\nreplaced by chitinous plates. Dorsally there are two similar but\r\nonly slightly developed lips or plates. A very prominent, conical\r\ndorso-median tooth projects into the buccal cavity. Through it\r\npasses the duct of the dorsal oesophageal gland. There are also 4\r\nbuccal lancets. The copulatory bursa of the _Necator americanus_ is\r\nalso different, being terminally bipartite and deeply cleft in the\r\ndivision of the dorsal ray, rather than tripartite and shallow, as\r\nwith _A. duodenale_.\r\n\r\n  The anterior extremity of _Ancylostoma_ bends in the same direction\r\n  as the general body curve while that of _Necator_ hooks back in an\r\n  opposite direction to the body curve.\r\n\r\n  By dropping the worms, while still alive, into hot 70% alcohol they\r\n  readily assume the attitudes noted above.\r\n\r\nIn general, _Ancylostoma_ is larger and thicker than _Necator_.\r\n\r\n  The name hookworm was given to these nematodes from the hook-like\r\n  processes of the ribs of the rays of the copulatory bursa.\r\n  Dubini called the Old World parasite _Agchylostoma_, properly\r\n  _Ancylostoma_, on account of the 4 formidable hook- or claw-like\r\n  ventral teeth of the buccal capsule. (αγχὶλος, hook, and στομα,\r\n  mouth.)\r\n\r\n  _A. ceylanicum_ is somewhat smaller than _A. duodenale_ and in the\r\n  copulatory bursa of the male we have a deeper cleft in the dorsal\r\n  ray and 2 rather long tips to each branch instead of the shallow\r\n  cleft and 3 stumpy processes of the 2 branches as in _A. duodenale_.\r\n\r\n=Life History.=—The delicate-shelled eggs pass out in the faeces,\r\nand in one or two days a rhabditiform embryo (200 × 14 microns) is\r\nproduced. The mouth cavity of the embryo is about as deep as the\r\ndiameter of the embryo at the posterior end of the mouth cavity; that\r\nof _Strongyloides_ is only about one-half as deep as the diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—1a, Copulatory bursa of _Necator\r\namericanus_, showing the deep cleft dividing the branches of the\r\ndorsal ray and the bipartite tips of the branches; also showing the\r\nfusion of the spicules to terminate in a single barb.

From\r\nStitt.]\r\n\r\n  As a practical point, the anaerobic conditions in the intestines\r\n  seem to prevent development of the hookworm ova or at any rate\r\n  the absence of the oxygen, so necessary for the segmentations\r\n  preliminary to the formation of the embryo, prevents it. Therefore\r\n  hookworm ova in freshly passed faeces never show other than\r\n  commencing segmentation while development of the larvae of\r\n  _Strongyloides_ takes place in the intestines, so that in freshly\r\n  passed faeces we find, generally, actively moving larvae or at\r\n  least eggs containing fully developed embryos. Hookworm ova very\r\n  rarely show more than 4 segments or exceptionally 8 segments in the\r\n  freshly passed egg.\r\n\r\n  In the presence of oxygen these ova rapidly develop into larvae,\r\n  particularly at a temperature of about 27°C. Beyond 37°C. and below\r\n  14°C. development does not seem to take place.\r\n\r\n  The rhabditiform larvae grow rapidly and by the 3rd day are about\r\n  300 microns long and undergo a primary moulting. By the 5th day\r\n  the bulb-like swellings disappear and the larva becomes possessed\r\n  of a straight oesophagus, thereby becoming a strongyloid larva. It\r\n  then undergoes a 2nd ecdysis or moulting, but instead of casting\r\n  off this old covering, it retains it as a protecting sheath. The\r\n  full grown larva is about 550 by 24 microns. At this time it ceases\r\n  to take food but can move actively in its sheath so that it can\r\n  crawl up blades of grass or vertical sides of mines. They can live\r\n  in this state for months, when moisture and shade are present, but\r\n  are rapidly killed by drying. Before becoming encysted hookworm\r\n  larvae are readily destroyed by the action of the sun or chemicals\r\n  or even by dilution of the faeces, especially with urine. Cort and\r\n  others have found it a common occurrence for mature larvae to lose\r\n  their sheaths while living in the soil, and to continue their lives\r\n  in the unsheathed state. The proportion losing their sheaths varies\r\n  from 52 to 98%.\r\n\r\nThis is the _infecting stage_ in which the larvae bore their way into\r\nthe skin, which is the usual method of infection, or, occasionally,\r\nby entering the mouth on vegetables or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  Looss thought that they entered the skin by way of the hair\r\n  follicles but the idea now is that they can bore into any part of\r\n  the skin. It only requires a few minutes for the larvae to enter\r\n  the skin. From the subcutaneous tissues they effect an entrance\r\n  into lymphatics or veins, go to the right heart, thence to lungs.\r\n  From the alveolar capillaries they pass into the pulmonary alveoli,\r\n  thence up the bronchi and trachea, to pass out of the larynx and\r\n  then down the oesophagus to the stomach. The larva loses its\r\n  protecting sheath in the stomach and in a few days develops a\r\n  provisional buccal capsule.\r\n\r\n  By the end of the 2nd week, after another ecdysis, the larvae\r\n  have grown to be about 2 mm. long and 130 microns broad and in\r\n  about 4 weeks become adults, usually in the jejunum, where, after\r\n  fertilization of the females by the males, the giving off of\r\n  eggs begins. The adults attach themselves to the mucosa of the\r\n  intestine, feeding on the deeper structures of the mucosa, or on\r\n  the tissues of the submucosa. Sambon believes that the larvae can\r\n  work their way into the jejunum without going there by way of the\r\n  trachea and oesophagus.\r\n\r\n  By providing an exit to the trachea, Fülleborn demonstrated that\r\n  in dogs, infected with the dog hookworm, great numbers of larvae\r\n  poured out of the trachea. In other dogs he stitched the oesophagus\r\n  to the skin and noted larvae coming out of these openings. In these\r\n  dogs, with the ordinary channel obstructed, infection did occur\r\n  with, however, only a few worms, thus showing the truth of Sambon’s\r\n  views but at the same time demonstrating the unimportance of such a\r\n  route of infection.\r\n\r\n  The mouth cavity of the embryo is about as deep as the diameter\r\n  of the embryo at the posterior end of the mouth cavity, that of\r\n  _Strongyloides_ is only about one-half as deep as the diameter.\r\n  The genital anlage of _Strongyloides_ is much larger than that of\r\n  _Ancylostoma_.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—When faeces containing hookworm eggs are deposited\r\nwhere conditions of moisture, warmth and shade exist, they develop\r\ninto the infecting stage, which is the nonfeeding but motile larva\r\ninside the cuticle formed by the second moulting. While eggs and\r\nyounger larvae are killed rapidly, the encysted larvae withstand\r\ndrying for considerable periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—_Ancylostoma duodenale_ (life size). Shows\r\nsome worms adherent to the intestinal mucosa and some free. (From\r\nJefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\n  Stiles notes that the more favorable conditions for development are\r\n  in a porous, sandy soil rather than in a clay one. Where a sewerage\r\n  system exists there is very little danger of the spread of hookworm\r\n  disease and the same is true where there is proper disposal of the\r\n  faeces by burning, boiling or treatment in a septic tank. In rural\r\n  districts, however, where the stool is often deposited in the shade\r\n  and retirement of a clump of trees, the soil becomes infested with\r\n  myriads of larvae, so that one standing with bare feet on such a\r\n  spot easily becomes infected. It is for this reason that shoes are\r\n  of protective value. In infected mines with temperatures below\r\n  22°C. infection is rare (6%); from 22°C. to 25°C. more common\r\n  (16.6%), and above 25°C., it may reach high figures (61%).\r\n\r\n  Those of the negro race do not suffer from the infection as do the\r\n  whites. They appear to have an immunity but serve as carriers of\r\n  the disease. There is difference of opinion as to the length of\r\n  time the parasites may live in man in the absence of reinfection.\r\n  Some consider this period one of a few months, others of two or\r\n  three years. We can certainly consider that a case leaving an\r\n  infested region will get rid of his parasites within seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe site of entrance of the larvae is characterized by a dermatitis\r\nwhich is often called “ground itch” or “foot itch” by reason of\r\nits frequent location in the foot which has come in contact with\r\nthe faeces-polluted soil. The dermatitis disappears in about two\r\nweeks unless some secondary infection occurs. There are reports of\r\npulmonary irritation which may be explained by the wandering of the\r\nlarvae through the lungs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—Longitudinal section through a hookworm\r\nattached to the intestinal mucosa, about 6 hours after the death of\r\nthe carrier. A portion of the submucous coat is drawn into the buccal\r\ncavity and trails along cord-like into the oesophagus, in which 4\r\nsmall tissue nuclei are still discernible. Section 0.01 mm. thick.\r\n(From Mense.)]\r\n\r\n  Pronounced anaemia with yellow, wax-like skin is a feature of\r\n  severe cases but emaciation is rare, the subcutaneous fat still\r\n  remaining. There is frequently oedema about the ankles. In the\r\n  jejunum we find small haemorrhagic spots from the size of a pea\r\n  to that of a half dollar. A worm may be found in the center of\r\n  this spot. In sections from the tissues injured by the bite we\r\n  note an infiltration of eosinophiles. The heart often shows fatty\r\n  degeneration with dilatation. The liver and kidneys usually show\r\n  fatty change while the spleen is generally shrunken. Sandwith noted\r\n  splenic enlargement in many of his autopsies but such enlargement\r\n  must have been due to other causes.\r\n\r\nThere are many views as to the manner in which the damage due to the\r\nhookworm is brought about. Some think it by bacterial infections\r\noccurring through the wounds made by the worms, others that it is due\r\nto a haemolytic toxic material excreted by the worms, while Stiles\r\nconsiders the ingestion of the patient’s blood important. Looss\r\nthinks it due to the gradual destruction of the intestinal mucosa\r\nfrom the feeding on this, and especially of the submucosa, by the\r\nworms. In their feeding the worms move from site to site. When they\r\nleave a point bleeding continues and this may account for much of the\r\nanaemia.\r\n\r\n  On the side of the blood we have at first a moderate leucocytosis\r\n  which disappears with the anaemia. Eosinophilia and Hb. percentage\r\n  reduction are often observed. In 3 cases I have known a fatal\r\n  pernicious anaemia to develop.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn a secondary anaemia, with early and marked cardiac palpitation\r\ntogether with epigastric tenderness and a tendency to mental\r\nretardation and physical deterioration, one should always examine the\r\nstools for hookworm eggs.\r\n\r\n  The course of the disease is decidedly insidious and indefinite\r\n  and the clinical diagnosis notoriously uncertain, as shown by many\r\n  reports where physicians of experience, after examining a number\r\n  of persons in a mill or school and only diagnosing 2 or 3% as\r\n  infected, have been astonished, upon examination of the faeces of\r\n  the group, to obtain positive evidence of infection in 70 to 80% of\r\n  the number examined.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, it is well to divide hookworm cases into 3 groups;\r\n1. Where the person infected fails to show any special evidence of\r\nabnormality, the diagnosis resting almost entirely on the finding of\r\nova in the faeces.\r\n\r\n  Such cases may show very slight reduction in haemoglobin and\r\n  only admit of a certain lack of energy. The best indication that\r\n  hookworm infection is doing the host injury is that after treatment\r\n  they gain in weight and energy and show improvement in mental\r\n  concentration.\r\n\r\n2. Mild cases with moderate degrees of anaemia, the Hb. percentage\r\nranging from 55 to 75. In these cases there is rather marked\r\nepigastric tenderness with frequent attacks of acid eructations.\r\nCardiac palpitation and a tendency to shortness of breath may be\r\nquite noticeable. Headache and vertigo may be present.\r\n\r\n3. Severe cases. In such cases we may find extreme anaemia with Hb.\r\npercentages around 35 or even as low as 15. I have always felt that\r\none was only approximating when recording percentages of 10 or lower.\r\n\r\n  These cases are very weak and show marked cardiac palpitation and\r\n  dyspnoea upon the slightest exertion. There is often dilatation of\r\n  the stomach and a protuberant abdomen. The red cells may fall below\r\n  1,000,000. There is also oedema, especially about the feet and\r\n  ankles. Tinnitus aurium is rather frequent.\r\n\r\nSuch cases often show depravity of appetite, the best-known craving\r\nbeing that for earth. Other patients crave chalk, wood, cotton, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.—Fatal case of ancylostomiasis. Red cells\r\n810,000. Hb. 15%. White count 6400. Eosinophiles absent. Upper part\r\nof small intestines lined with hookworms. (From U. S. Naval Medical\r\nBulletin.)]\r\n\r\n  It is in children that we have the most serious effects of\r\n  the disease, there being marked stunting of the growth with a\r\n  corresponding mental backwardness. Such children show marked\r\n  retardation and delay in answering the question asked them and\r\n  often repeat it in a drawling manner. Tested by the Binet-Simon\r\n  method we may find a sixteen year old child to have the mental\r\n  development of a ten year old one, but at the same time we would\r\n  note that from a standpoint of physical development the child only\r\n  seemed ten years old.\r\n\r\n  As the child approaches adult age we note a striking lack of sexual\r\n  development and the lack of pubic hair. In girls there is delay in\r\n  the onset of the menstrual periods or these may never appear.\r\n\r\nIn from 80 to 90% of cases there is a history of dermatitis,\r\nparticularly of toes or feet, which is commonly called “ground itch,”\r\n“foot itch,” or “dew itch.” This is most frequent between the toes\r\nor on the inner side of the sole of the foot. The irritation is\r\ndue to the penetration into the cutaneous tissues of the hookworm\r\nlarvae. The itching is intense and secondary infections often occur\r\nas the result of scratching. Vesicles appear about the second day and\r\nare often ruptured by the scratching with a resulting pustular or\r\nimpetiginous conditions. The skin and hair generally are dry.\r\n\r\n  As a rule the temperature is normal throughout the course of an\r\n  uncomplicated case of hookworm disease. During the first week or so\r\n  following a heavy infection there may be pulmonary manifestations\r\n  when the larvae are migrating by way of the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn the diagnosis of a case Stiles attaches much importance to a\r\ntallow-yellow color of the alae of the nose and the forehead, as well\r\nas to the eye characteristics which are like those seen in the eye of\r\na fish or that of an intoxicated person.\r\n\r\n  He also notes that the pupil tends to dilate instead of to contract\r\n  when the patient looks at a bright light. It has seemed to me that\r\n  the condition is rather one of hippus. In severe cases retinal\r\n  haemorrhages may occur. There may be night blindness. Ascites may\r\n  be present in advanced cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _Skin Manifestations._—The dermatitis following the penetration of\r\n  the larvae is most often about the toes or inner side of the sole\r\n  of the foot. The skin is very dry and often a pale earthy color.\r\n  A tallow-yellow tinting of the alae of the nose may be observed.\r\n  The hair is dry and scanty or absent in pubic and beard regions.\r\n  Oedema, especially of ankles or feet, is common.\r\n\r\n  _Circulatory and Respiratory Systems._—Palpitation of the heart is\r\n  early and marked. Functional murmurs are frequent in the advanced\r\n  stages. Pulsation of the neck veins is also common. The pulse\r\n  rate averages about 110 and the blood pressure is low. There is\r\n  frequently some right side dilatation of the heart. A high pulse\r\n  pressure is common in severe cases. Shortness of breath on slight\r\n  exertion is the most common respiratory symptom. There are at times\r\n  cough and bronchitis, probably induced by the irritation of the\r\n  larvae in the pulmonary alveoli.\r\n\r\n  _Digestive System._—Epigastric tenderness going to the right\r\n  is very characteristic. The stomach is often dilated and the\r\n  gastric juice hyperacid. As the anaemia increases the acidity\r\n  diminishes. It has been suggested that the desire to neutralize\r\n  this acidity with an alkali is the explanation of the desire for\r\n  alkali-containing earth on the part of “dirt eaters.”\r\n\r\n  Patients often are pot-bellied. Constipation is rather a common\r\n  feature and the stools very rarely show macroscopic blood.\r\n\r\n  _Nervous System._—Hookworm patients are not only physically\r\n  tired but, as well, mentally tired. The infection in children\r\n  leads to a backward mental state. Patients have very little\r\n  energy or initiative and are often considered stupid and lazy.\r\n  Hypochondriasis is at times noted and some severe cases become\r\n  melancholic.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—The red cell count averages in marked cases 2,500,000\r\n  to 3,000,000 red cells per cu. mm. The Hb. percentage is down in\r\n  such cases to between 30 and 50. The color index is well below\r\n  1, except in certain rare cases, when the color index is that of\r\n  pernicious anaemia, being above 1. These latter cases are very\r\n  resistant to treatment and often show very few infecting worms\r\n  notwithstanding the severity of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n  There is at times a moderate leucocytosis but as a rule the white\r\n  count is approximately normal.\r\n\r\n  Eosinophilia is quite characteristic and usually ranges from 15 to\r\n  35% of the leucocytes. Eosinophilia tends to disappear as the cases\r\n  become advanced.\r\n\r\n  The spleen and liver very rarely give rise to any symptoms and\r\n  while albuminuria is rather common in advanced cases with oedema\r\n  about the feet, yet casts are but rarely found.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—The diseases with which it is most likely to\r\nbe confused are beriberi, chronic nephritis and malarial cachexia.\r\nStiles notes that heavy _Ascaris_ infections may give rather similar\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n  The signs of a multiple neuritis should differentiate beriberi, and\r\n  the presence of casts or high blood pressure, chronic nephritis.\r\n  Recently, there has been a great deal written about the danger of\r\n  confusing hookworm disease and malarial cachexia, the statement\r\n  being often made that splenic enlargement is a feature of\r\n  ancylostomiasis. Most authorities, however, state that the spleen\r\n  of ancylostomiasis is not enlarged, this point being of diagnostic\r\n  value in differentiating it from malaria and kala-azar.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—As a matter of fact the diagnosis is almost\r\ninvariably made by finding hookworm ova in the faeces. The eggs are\r\noval and thin-shelled with a wide, clear, glassy zone separating the\r\nmore or less segmented, granular central portion from the shell.\r\n\r\n  Formed stools are more satisfactory for examination than the\r\n  liquid ones resulting from a dose of salts. Put about 2 drops of\r\n  water or 1% trikresol solution in the centre of a glass slide and\r\n  emulsify in it as much of the faeces as is held by the spatulate\r\n  end of a wooden toothpick. A small piece of wood or a match stick\r\n  will answer. These preparations can be readily examined without a\r\n  cover-glass, using a ⅔ inch objective, with a 1-inch ocular.\r\n\r\n  Cultural methods give a higher percentage of success than looking\r\n  for ova in the stools. Put a pile of 2 inch filter papers in the\r\n  center of a Petri dish. Fill the dish with water to the level of\r\n  the paper island. Smear a thick layer of faeces on the paper. The\r\n  larvae hatch out and can be found by centrifuging the water.\r\n\r\n  It is usually stated that about 500 worms must be present for\r\n  several months to produce symptoms. Grassi has thought that the\r\n  presence of 150 eggs in 0.01 gm. faeces indicates the presence of\r\n  1,000 worms, of which 25% would be males.\r\n\r\n  There may be as many as 4,000,000 eggs in a stool. Bass has\r\n  proposed the following method for the examination of faeces for\r\n  ova: The faeces, which have been made fluid, should be centrifuged\r\n  and the supernatant fluid containing vegetable débris poured off.\r\n  The sediment contains hookworm eggs. Then pour on sediment a\r\n  calcium chloride solution of sp. gr. 1.050. Again centrifuge and\r\n  decant. Next add calcium chloride solution of a sp. gr. of 1.250\r\n  and centrifuge. This brings to the surface the hookworm eggs which\r\n  may be pipetted off. As a rule, the finding of hookworm eggs is\r\n  very easy without such a technique.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.—Ovum of _Ancylostoma duodenale_. By J. A.\r\nThomson. (Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\n  Recently we have been using Barber’s technique. Emulsify the faeces\r\n  in equal parts of glycerine and saturated salt solution on a slide.\r\n  The eggs rise to the surface and are easily discovered with the\r\n  ⅔-inch objective. As a centrifuge method, Barber emulsifies faeces\r\n  in this same mixture which brings the eggs to the surface. A wisp\r\n  of cotton is placed on the surface and 3 or 4 drops of melted\r\n  agar dropped on the cotton. The disc of agar is removed with the\r\n  cotton, deposited on a slide and examined for entangled eggs. With\r\n  operculated eggs this method does not seem to be satisfactory as\r\n  the salt solution loosens the operculum and floods the contents\r\n  of the shell,—thus altering the specific gravity of the egg and\r\n  preventing flotation.\r\n\r\n  _Lane Levitation Method._—Clayton Lane recommends a technique\r\n  which he designates as the levitation method. In this procedure the\r\n  concentrated sediment of a centrifuged specimen is transferred to a\r\n  glass slide, where it is mixed with one cc. of water. The slide is\r\n  allowed to stand for five minutes and is then immersed in water and\r\n  manipulated until all coarse matter has floated free. The hookworm\r\n  ova stick firmly to the slide and are not washed away. Lane reports\r\n  that on an average this method results in a ten-fold concentration\r\n  of ova.\r\n\r\n  In certain cases, where a microscope is not available, the\r\n  diagnosis may be made by finding the worms in the stool following a\r\n  thymol treatment.\r\n\r\n  Whyte has recommended the phenolphthalein test for occult blood as\r\n  of value in determining the cure of ancylostomiasis. This test is\r\n  so delicate that the least trace of blood from the mucosal lesion\r\n  will be detected.\r\n\r\nThe presence of eosinophilia is of great assistance in diagnosis but\r\nit should be remembered that not rarely severe cases of the disease\r\nfail to show any excess of eosinophiles.\r\n\r\n  Charcot-Leyden crystals are often present in hookworm stools.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe disease is more serious in children than in adults, on account of\r\nits interfering with physical and mental development. The dark races\r\ndo not seem to suffer as much as the white ones. Treatment is usually\r\nmost successful, but in those who are debilitated by other diseases\r\nor, in those in whom the disease has assumed a pernicious anaemia\r\ntendency, the outlook is not good.\r\n\r\n  The presence of eosinophilia is of good prognostic significance\r\n  as the absence of eosinophiles indicates an exhaustion of the\r\n  haemopoietic system.\r\n\r\n  The disease shortens the life of the people in an infected district\r\n  and makes them readily fall victims to intercurrent diseases.\r\n  Various statistics give the mortality as from less than one-half of\r\n  1% to figures approximating 7%.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The first measure is to diagnose infections in\r\ncarriers and to insist upon the treatment of such persons. The\r\nproper disposal of the fecal material from hookworm patients is the\r\nobjective point in prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n  The use of some type of properly constructed privy is essential as\r\n  there is nothing more favorable to the development of the hookworm\r\n  larvae from eggs to infecting stage than the practice of defecating\r\n  on the ground where conditions of porous, sandy soil, shade and\r\n  moisture exist. Later on, such a spot teems with infecting larvae\r\n  and the person stepping there with bare feet is almost sure to\r\n  become infected. For this reason the wearing of shoes is an\r\n  important prophylactic measure. At the same time shoes are not a\r\n  sure protection, as Ashford has noted infections in soldiers who\r\n  wore good shoes. The fecal material, collected in a pail or tub,\r\n  should preferably be burned or boiled. Otherwise it should be\r\n  buried not less than 300 feet from the water supply and down hill\r\n  from the same.\r\n\r\nThe best method is to use some septic tank process as the anaerobic\r\nprocesses of fermentation destroy the eggs.\r\n\r\n  The use of an amount of compound cresol solution equaling the fecal\r\n  mass, plus urine, is of value.\r\n\r\n  Hookworm disease tends to disappear in towns or cities where there\r\n  is an efficient sewerage system.\r\n\r\nHookworm disease is one of the most conspicuous examples of soil\r\npollution disease.\r\n\r\n  Some authors think _Ancylostoma_ more difficult to expel than\r\n  _Necator_.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—The drugs best known in treatment are thymol and\r\nchenopodium but carbon tetrachloride offers the greatest promise.\r\n\r\n_The Thymol Treatment._—Bozzolo introduced this drug in the\r\ntreatment of hookworm disease in 1879. Thymol has an aromatic,\r\nthyme-like odor and a pungent taste and, while soluble in about an\r\nequal amount of alcohol, is only soluble in water in the proportion\r\nof 1 to 1100.\r\n\r\n  It is usual to prescribe the drug in 5-grain capsules or preferably\r\n  in cachets, one part of thymol being triturated with an equal\r\n  amount of sugar of milk. If the cachet is moistened with a little\r\n  water it may be swallowed like a raw oyster.\r\n\r\n  Stiles prefers giving the treatment on Sunday so that the working\r\n  days of the patient may not be lessened. By giving the patient\r\n  bicarbonate of soda for a few days before the treatment it is\r\n  thought that the mucus lining of the jejunum is cleared away so\r\n  that the worms are more readily affected by the drug. At any rate\r\n  one should give about 1 or 2 ounces of a 50% solution of Epsom\r\n  salts on Saturday evening. Sodium sulphate is preferred by some.\r\n\r\n  The following morning at 6 A.M. the patient takes one-half the dose\r\n  of thymol proper for his age and at 8 A.M. he takes the remaining\r\n  half of the dose. At 10 A.M. he takes another dose of Epsom\r\n  salts. The reason for dividing the dose of thymol is that should\r\n  untoward symptoms occur after the first portion of the dose we do\r\n  not give the second. Stiles now prefers to divide his dose into\r\n  three portions, one to be given at 6 A.M., one at 7 A.M. and the\r\n  remaining third portion at 8 A.M., followed by salts at 10 A.M. The\r\n  patient should lie on the right side while taking the treatment to\r\n  facilitate the passage of the drug from the often dilated stomach.\r\n\r\n  The patient should remain in bed until 12 o’clock when he may take\r\n  some coffee, without milk, and crackers.\r\n\r\nPatients must be warned to avoid anything containing fats or alcohol\r\nwhile undergoing treatment as fats and alcohol dissolve the thymol\r\nand tend to cause poisoning. Under no circumstances should castor oil\r\nbe used. People are apt to forget that butter, milk, etc., contain\r\nthe dangerous fats.\r\n\r\n  Seidell has shown that about one-third of the thymol dosage is\r\n  excreted in the urine and very little by faeces. This shows\r\n  absorption of the drug. It is thought some of the drug may be\r\n  excreted by the lungs. Congestion of the lungs has been reported in\r\n  fatal cases of thymol poisoning.\r\n\r\n  Mild symptoms of poisoning are burning in the pit of the stomach\r\n  and tingling sensations of the body. More severe symptoms are\r\n  those associated with cardiac weakness and respiratory distress.\r\n  Coffee and strychnine are the usual remedies for thymol poisoning.\r\n  Inhalation, but not swallowing, of aromatic spirits of ammonia is\r\n  often of value.\r\n\r\n  The thymol dosage recommended according to the age, or rather the\r\n  apparent age of the patient, is:\r\n\r\n  Under 5 years old            7½ grains.\r\n  From 5 to 9 years old        15 grains.\r\n  From 10 to 14 years old      30 grains.\r\n  From 15 to 19 years old      45 grains.\r\n  From 20 to 59 years old      60 grains.\r\n  Above 60 years old           30 to 45 grains.\r\n\r\n  Total dose to be divided into 2 or 3 portions. The patient is\r\n  allowed to eat only a light luncheon and supper the day of the\r\n  treatment but the next day he may resume his regular meals.\r\n\r\n  As a rule most of the worms expelled by the treatment will\r\n  have been passed by night of the day of treatment, although an\r\n  occasional one may be passed for four or five days.\r\n\r\nIn from 25 to 50% of cases all the worms may be expelled in\r\none treatment but it is usually necessary to give as many as 3\r\ntreatments, one on each of three Sundays.\r\n\r\n  _Thymol and Beta-naphthol._—Nicol in a comparison of the efficacy\r\n  of various drugs, noted that thymol in 90-grain doses, taken in\r\n  3 portions of 30 grains each, at 6, 8, and 10 A.M. expelled 98%\r\n  of the worms at the first treatment and the remaining worms at\r\n  the second treatment a week later. With this rather large dose he\r\n  frequently observed a tendency to syncope. He used Epsom salts as a\r\n  purgative.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, while using 60 grains of beta-naphthol, given in\r\n  two portions at 6 and 8 A.M., followed by salts, 86% of the worms\r\n  were expelled at the first treatment and 14% with the second one.\r\n  He did not observe any bad effects from beta-naphthol.\r\n\r\n  The great objection to beta-naphthol is that it is a renal irritant\r\n  and may damage a kidney already diseased.\r\n\r\n  Nicol found the treatment with eucalyptus oil, 2 cc., chloroform,\r\n  3 cc. and castor oil, 30 cc. vastly inferior in anthelminthic\r\n  effect to the other two treatments and liable to cause severe\r\n  manifestations of nausea and syncope.\r\n\r\n  It is better to divide the dose as just stated into two portions,\r\n  the second half to be given about one-half hour after the first\r\n  portion. This reduces the danger from the chloroform.\r\n\r\n  Schüffner tried male fern and only obtained 7 hookworms while the\r\n  next day, using thymol, 1253 hookworms were expelled. He notes that\r\n  thymol is dangerous when administered to patients with acute or\r\n  subacute dysentery.\r\n\r\n  In Brazil a tabloid of 5 grains beta-naphthol combined with 1\r\n  grain of phenolphthalein has been generally employed. Using\r\n  phenolphthalein in this way enables them to dispense with purgation.\r\n\r\n_Oil of Chenopodium Treatment._—As the result of comparing\r\nthe relative efficiency of thymol and oil of chenopodium the\r\nInternational Health Board Commission reported in favor of oil of\r\nchenopodium. In only 7.6% of the cases treated with chenopodium was\r\nthere failure to eradicate the parasites while there was noted 23.6%\r\nof failures with thymol. The dose of oil of chenopodium recommended\r\nwas 1.5 cc. given in three divided doses of O.5 cc. at 7, 8, and 9\r\no’clock in the morning. Two such treatments will remove 99% of worms\r\npresent in a case. The Commission found the oil more efficient than\r\nan emulsion of the oil.\r\n\r\n  The low diet and preliminary dose of salts, as noted under thymol\r\n  treatment, are to be recommended although the commission found\r\n  various purges to have little effect on the results of treatment.\r\n  At 11 o’clock give a purgative dose of magnesium sulphate.\r\n\r\n  The maximum dose of oil of chenopodium is usually given as 3 cc.\r\n  but a number of deaths have followed the administration of doses of\r\n  from 2 to 3 cc., so that it is better to keep within 1.5 cc.\r\n\r\n  After effects of treatment, such as dizziness, depression, unsteady\r\n  gait, partial loss of consciousness, tingling of hands and feet,\r\n  burning sensation in the epigastric region and nausea are more\r\n  frequent with chenopodium than following thymol. The toxic symptoms\r\n  may be greatly delayed and even be postponed for a day or so. A\r\n  large dose of castor oil seems to be the most important measure\r\n  in treating a case of chenopodium poisoning. The same methods of\r\n  stimulation as noted under thymol poisoning are also indicated.\r\n\r\n  Kantor has treated a large number of cases with oil of chenopodium\r\n  administered through the duodenal tube. After the bucket had passed\r\n  the pylorus he introduced into the duodenum about 2 cc. of oil of\r\n  chenopodium and followed this in six minutes with two (2) ounces\r\n  of a warm saturated solution of magnesium sulphate. The tube is\r\n  withdrawn after introducing the salts. Several copious watery\r\n  stools follow in a short time.\r\n\r\n  _Carbon tetrachloride_ in a dose of 3 cc. administered in hard\r\n  gelatine capsules, is recommended by Hall for the removal of\r\n  hookworms and ascarids. The drug is cheaper, more effective, and,\r\n  when chemically pure, safer than thymol or chenopodium. It does\r\n  not depress unstriated musculature or lessen peristalsis, thus\r\n  eliminating the use of purgatives, which is an item of expense in\r\n  extensive hookworm campaigns. The drug is of no value in treatment\r\n  of tapeworms and is as unreliable as other anthelminthics for the\r\n  removal of whip-worms.\r\n\r\nThere is a rapidly growing mass of reports concerning the clinical\r\nuse of carbon tetrachloride, all of which agree in confirming\r\nexperimental observations regarding its effectiveness, and indicate\r\nthat a standard dosage as high as 10 to 12 cc. may be safely employed.\r\n\r\nAfter expelling the worms it is advisable to give the patient a\r\ntonic containing iron or arsenic. In those cases with a tendency to\r\npernicious anaemia the arsenic treatment is better than that with\r\niron.\r\n\r\n  In the treatment of ground itch the usual application is a zinc\r\n  oxide ointment containing 10 grains of salicylic acid to the ounce.\r\n\r\n  Barlow recommends a 3% salicylic acid solution in alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nFILARIAL INFECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nThe filarial worms are thread-like nematodes, with a thin cylindrical\r\noesophagus, which live in various parts of the body and may or may\r\nnot give rise to disease conditions. It is one of the most remarkable\r\nfacts in animal parasitology that a person may harbor numerous adult\r\nfilariae and myriads of embryos without in any way manifesting\r\nsymptoms of the infection. In most of the filarial worms the female\r\nhas a double uterus with the uterine opening near the anterior\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.—Geographical distribution of Filariasis.]\r\n\r\n  It has been proposed to designate the filarial embryo by the\r\n  term microfilaria, reserving the generic name _Filaria_ for the\r\n  adult parasite. This may be convenient for differentiation but\r\n  zoölogical nomenclature does not permit different names for adults\r\n  and embryos. While there have been almost 20 different filarial\r\n  species reported for man there is, in some instances, doubt as to\r\n  the correctness of the observation, and again, a well recognized\r\n  species has at times been considered as a new species and given a\r\n  new name.\r\n\r\nFrom a practical standpoint we need only consider: (1) _Filaria\r\nbancrofti_; the adult of which lives in the lymphatic glands and\r\nvessels while the sheathed embryos (which from their appearance in\r\nthe blood only at night are called _Filaria nocturna_) obtain access\r\nto the peripheral blood vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.—1a, Adult female Guinea worm (_Dracunculus\r\nmedinensis_) showing anchoring hook at posterior extremity. 1b,\r\nCross section of female _Dracunculus_ showing uterus filled with\r\nembryos. 1c, Striated embryos of the Guinea worm. 1d, _Cyclops\r\ncoronatus_, the minute crustacean which serves as the intermediate\r\nhost of _D. medinensis_. 2a-2d, Anterior and posterior extremities\r\nof _L. loa_. 2c, Section showing tuberculated cuticle. 2b, Male\r\nand female _L. loa_, natural size. 3a, Bulbous anterior extremity,\r\n_Filaria bancrofti_. 3b, Tail of male. 3c, Tail of female. 3d, Male\r\nand female, natural size of _F. bancrofti_. 4a, Tumor mass of _O.\r\nvolvulus_ laid open. 5, Mosquito showing filarial embryos in thoracic\r\nmuscles (a) and in labium (b).

The embryos have sharp tails and are without a sheath.\r\n  The parasite is not known to produce symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\n_Filaria bancrofti._—While elephantiasis was frequently described by\r\nancient writers yet the confusion between Elephantiasis Graecorum, a\r\nterm applied to leprosy, and Elephantiasis Arabum, or the filarial\r\ncondition, made the question of the nature of the skin thickenings\r\nvery indefinite.\r\n\r\n  The thickenings due to leprosy and those connected with filariasis\r\n  were separated clinically by observers during the 17th and 18th\r\n  centuries, Hilary, in 1750, having accurately described the\r\n  progress of that form of elephantiasis connected with elephantoid\r\n  fever and lymphangitis. In 1863 Demarquay discovered filarial\r\n  embryos in the exudate of a chylous hydrocele and three years\r\n  later Wucherer, in Brazil, found similar nematode larvae in the\r\n  urine of a case of haematochyluria. Commencing with the year 1863\r\n  Lewis carried on a series of investigations in Calcutta in which\r\n  he found these embryos not only in the urine of patients with\r\n  chyluria but as well in the lymph and blood of those affected with\r\n  elephantiasis. He called the parasite _Filaria sanguinis hominis_,\r\n  a name still frequently employed by medical writers.\r\n\r\n  In 1876 Bancroft, in Australia, discovered the adult filarial worms\r\n  in a lymphatic abscess, hence the name _Filaria bancrofti_. In\r\n  1878 Manson, in China, demonstrated the mosquito transmission of\r\n  the disease as well as the phenomenon of nocturnal periodicity.\r\n  Manson’s idea, however, was that the fully developed embryo escaped\r\n  from the body of the infected mosquito at the time of the death of\r\n  the insect and that man contracted the infection in drinking water.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Low and more recently those of Fülleborn and\r\nBahr and others have shown that the larvae escape by way of the\r\nmosquito’s proboscis and enter the skin of man.\r\n\r\n_Loa loa._—The knowledge of a filarial infection of the region of\r\nthe eye seems to date from the time of Magellan. Although the disease\r\nis now confined to the west coast of Africa, cases were reported from\r\nthe West Indies by Mongin and Bajou during the 18th century. These\r\ncases were in slaves who had contracted the infection in Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.—Section of _Stegomyia pseudoscutellaris_,\r\nshowing filariae in thorax on tenth day of development, travelling\r\nforwards into proboscis. By permission from Manson’s Tropical\r\nDiseases.]\r\n\r\n  In 1891 Manson noted the presence of the larval forms which showed\r\n  a diurnal periodicity in the peripheral blood.\r\n\r\n_Dracunculus medinensis._—Ancient Egyptian writings would indicate\r\nthat the disease was well known in those times. It is believed that\r\nthe fiery serpent of the wilderness, which afflicted the Children of\r\nIsrael, was an infection of this sort.\r\n\r\n  The prevalence of dracontiasis, as the infection is generally\r\n  termed, in Arabia, was well known to the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\n  Fedschenko, in 1870, noted the transmission of the disease by\r\n  species of _Cyclops_.\r\n\r\n_Onchocerca volvulus_ was first discovered in 1893, in peculiar\r\ntumors of the natives of the Gold Coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.—Female guinea worm (_Dracunculus\r\nmedinensis_) lying under the skin of the forearm. By permission from\r\nManson’s Tropical Diseases.]\r\n\r\n_Acanthocheilonema perstans_ was first found by Manson, in 1891, in\r\nthe blood of natives of the Congo.\r\n\r\n  Daniels also found these embryos, along with those of _F.\r\n  demarquayi_, in the blood of natives of British Guiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILARIA BANCROFTI\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nThis parasite has been found in almost all tropical and subtropical\r\ncountries. It is quite prevalent in the West Indies and has been\r\nfound in some of the Southern states of the U. S. It is very common\r\nin some of the South American countries as well as in Central\r\nAmerica. The infection is widespread in Arabia, India and China.\r\nAfrica, especially the West Coast, and Australia, particularly in\r\nQueensland, are parts of the world where the infection prevails.\r\n\r\n  It is especially in some of the Pacific islands, as Samoa and Fiji,\r\n  that it is extraordinarily prevalent. Bahr has stated that Fijians\r\n  in the proportion of 27% show filarial embryos in their blood. In\r\n  25% of these natives clinical manifestations of the disease exist\r\n  but the embryos are absent from the peripheral circulation. In\r\n  other words more than one-half of the population show absolute\r\n  evidence of infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORY\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that filarial embryos may be present at night\r\nin the peripheral blood of persons not showing a single symptom of\r\nfilariasis and again, in those with marked elephantiasis, varicose\r\ngroin glands or chyluria there may be an entire and permanent absence\r\nof embryos in the blood. When certain mosquitoes bite persons having\r\nembryos in the blood they take into their stomachs the sheathed\r\nembryos of _F. bancrofti_. Flu states he has succeeded in infecting\r\nthe following mosquitoes: _C. fatigans_, _S. scutellaris_, _M.\r\nludlowi_ and _M. rossii_. The most suitable carriers proved to be _C.\r\nfatigans_ and _S. scutellaris_. Large numbers of larvae perish in\r\nanopheline mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n  The following developmental cycle has been demonstrated for _Culex\r\n  fatigans_ and _Stegomyia pseudoscutellaris_. Bahr has found that\r\n  if there are too many embryos taken up by the mosquito the insect\r\n  is apt to die, as the result of too heavy an infection; so that\r\n  a person harboring many filarial embryos may be less dangerous\r\n  than one with a smaller number. Upon reaching the stomach of the\r\n  mosquito the sheath of the embryo becomes fixed in the viscid blood\r\n  contents and the embryo itself by active motions is able to force\r\n  itself from its sheath. This escape usually occurs within two hours\r\n  but may take longer. The free embryo then bores its way through the\r\n  stomach walls and within twenty-four hours has reached the thoracic\r\n  muscles of the mosquito. Within forty-eight hours the embryo begins\r\n  to broaden and the anterior and posterior V spots to become more\r\n  prominent. About the end of the first week there commences the\r\n  formation of an alimentary canal, by which time the developing\r\n  larva is about 0.5 mm. long. When the larva is about 0.6 mm. long\r\n  an ecdysis apparently takes place. Later on these larvae develop\r\n  3 or 4 terminal papillae and make their way to the fleshy labium\r\n  of the mosquito’s proboscis. An occasional larva may enter other\r\n  structures than the labium but in such case they would be unable to\r\n  effect an entrance to their definitive host, man. These larvae in\r\n  the proboscis are about 1.5 mm. long and about 20 microns broad.\r\n\r\n  The mosquitoes have two terminal processes, the labella, separated\r\n  from the labium by a thin membranous partition called Dutton’s\r\n  membrane. The larvae, having completed their developmental cycle\r\n  in the mosquito, which takes about three weeks, and moving down the\r\n  labium, break through this membrane when it is put upon a stretch\r\n  by the wide separation of the labella at the time of feeding on\r\n  the part of the mosquito. It was formerly supposed that the larvae\r\n  entered man through the puncture made by the biting parts of the\r\n  mosquito, but Bahr has shown by experiments that they effect\r\n  an entrance through the intact pores of the skin as does the\r\n  ancylostome larva.\r\n\r\nThese larvae upon entering the human host reach the lymphatic\r\nvessels or glands and in this definitive host (man) the females are\r\nfertilized by the males and give off sheathed larvae from the uterine\r\nopening near the anterior end of the worm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.—Male (a) and female (b) of _Filaria\r\nbancrofti_. Natural size. (From Greene after Manson.)]\r\n\r\n  The sheath is simply the egg membrane which from being oval at\r\n  first becomes stretched by the developing embryo to finally become\r\n  a long, narrow sac encasing the fully developed embryo as it exists\r\n  in man. From the lymph stream they reach the general circulation.\r\n  In a case of a man with filarial embryos in his peripheral\r\n  circulation, who committed suicide one morning, Manson found the\r\n  embryos, in large part, contained in the vessels of the lungs.\r\n  There were 675 embryos per slide in blood from the lungs for one\r\n  from blood from the spleen or liver. It would thus appear that\r\n  during the day, when the embryos are absent from the peripheral\r\n  circulation, they retire to the lungs. In the case of the filarial\r\n  embryo of persons in the Pacific Islands there does not appear\r\n  to exist any periodicity. Bahr thinks this absence of nocturnal\r\n  periodicity to be connected with the habits of its principal\r\n  intermediary host, _Stegomyia pseudoscutellaris_, which feeds by\r\n  day. _Culex fatigans_ feeds at night.\r\n\r\n  With the filarial embryos found in patients in the Philippines\r\n  there is also a lack of nocturnal periodicity. In the opinion of\r\n  Ashburn and Craig the Philippine filarial worm is a new species,\r\n  _Filaria philippinensis_.\r\n\r\n  Walker, however, recently examined four adult filarial worms in\r\n  the Philippines and was unable to note any differences from _F.\r\n  bancrofti_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND MORBID ANATOMY\r\n\r\nThe adult worms may exist in numbers and over long periods of time\r\ngive off great numbers of embryos into the peripheral circulation\r\nwithout there being any evidence of disease in the patient. There is\r\napt to be at such time a marked eosinophilia. The process by which\r\nthe fibrosis of lymph channels with obstruction to the flow of lymph\r\noccurs is unknown. Some think that with the pouring out of embryos\r\ninflammatory processes, bacterial or otherwise, may be set up. We\r\nknow that there is a tendency for these adults to die and become\r\ncalcified, in this way bringing about lymphatic obstruction.\r\n\r\n  Bahr notes the influence of adult filariae in producing an increase\r\n  in connective tissue in glands and considers such glands as less\r\n  resistant to bacterial infection.\r\n\r\nManson has an idea that some factor may cause the female to give off\r\nimmature embryos, which being oval, and of considerable width, may\r\nblock the lymphatics.\r\n\r\n  It has often been claimed that various cocci were the exciting\r\n  factors in the lymphangitis associated with filariasis. Recently\r\n  Dutcher has reported the isolation of an organism resembling\r\n  _B. subtilis_ as the cause of filarial lymphangitis (_Bacillus\r\n  lymphangiticus_).\r\n\r\n  As the result of the lymphangitis and blocking of the channels\r\n  the embryos cannot reach the peripheral circulation; hence when\r\n  obstruction does occur and symptoms of lymph stasis appear, there\r\n  may be an absence of embryos in the circulation.\r\n\r\nIt is now well established that patients with elephantiasis very\r\nrarely show embryos in the peripheral circulation, and this fact\r\nshould be better understood because there is a tendency to negative\r\na filarial diagnosis when embryos are absent from the peripheral\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n  These lymph channel obstructions may at one time cause dilatations\r\n  or varices and at another bring about solid oedemas of the\r\n  tributary parts. The treatment will be considered under each\r\n  special form of the disease. It may be stated however that\r\n  salvarsan, arsenophenylglycin and other similar remedies have been\r\n  without special effect in destroying the filarial worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\nNot only is it important to understand that elephantiasis and other\r\nmanifestations of filarial infection may and usually do exist\r\nwithout there being embryos in the peripheral blood of the patient,\r\nbut also, that a high percentage of a population may show filarial\r\nembryos in their blood and yet never or with extreme rarity show\r\nany of the signs of filarial disease. These people, with abundant\r\nembryos in their blood, usually show no disturbance of health. In the\r\nPhilippines one may rarely see a case of chylocele but usually there\r\nis nothing clinical to note.\r\n\r\n  Johnson, in examining 400 people, in Charleston, S. C., found\r\n  19% with filarial embryos, yet only 5% showed any symptoms of\r\n  filariasis. Croll states that 11.5% of 4000 Europeans admitted\r\n  to the Brisbane Hospital (Australia) showed filarial infection\r\n  but practically none had symptoms. In South Queensland cases of\r\n  lymphangitis, chyluria and varicose groin glands are occasionally\r\n  seen and rather frequently hydrocele and filarial abscesses. There\r\n  is an absence of elephantiasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nElephantoid Fever\r\n\r\nThe febrile accessions that accompany the recurring attacks of\r\nlymphangitis in elephantiasis, lymph scrotum and other filarial\r\nmanifestations, are very important because they may lead to errors in\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\n  Thus in Barbadoes, where there is no malaria, a condition in\r\n  which there occurs a high fever of sudden onset with rigors and\r\n  associated erysipelatous redness of leg or scrotum, accompanied by\r\n  lymphangitis and painful lymphatic glands, has given a suggestion\r\n  of a malarial paroxysm. The tense inflamed area, after several\r\n  days, shows an exudation of lymph and the redness disappears,\r\n  but with some resulting thickening of the affected tissues. Such\r\n  attacks may terminate with profuse sweating.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the condition is such as would be advisable for\r\nordinary lymphangitis—rest in bed, elevation of the part, laxatives\r\nand local applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nLymph Scrotum\r\n\r\nThis condition is apt to set in with fever. The scrotal tissues are\r\nsomewhat tense and reddened and may show numerous lymphatic varices\r\nwhich when pricked with a needle, give exit to lymph which may or may\r\nnot contain filarial embryos. The lymph continues to exude for a long\r\ntime. Erysipelatous manifestations are not uncommon. With recurring\r\nattacks the scrotal tissues become more and more hypertrophied and\r\nmay go on to elephantiasis of the scrotum.\r\n\r\n  Ordinarily local applications with suspension of the scrotum is the\r\n  proper treatment. Should the thickening increase to a great extent\r\n  the blubbery tissues may be excised, care being exercised to avoid\r\n  the testicles and to bring together sound tissue for the enclosing\r\n  flaps. These wounds usually heal readily, although there may be\r\n  delay in healing from the outpouring of lymph in cases where the\r\n  flaps include diseased tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nVaricose Groin Glands\r\n\r\nSwellings which come on rather slowly and insidiously may involve\r\nthe inguinal or femoral groups of glands of one or both sides.\r\nThe epitrochlear glands may also be involved. The skin over the\r\nenlarged, rather doughy glands can be freely moved but the glands\r\nthemselves are bound down to the deeper tissues. Elephantoid fever\r\nmay set in associated with local manifestations of pain and redness.\r\n\r\n  If such glands are punctured with a hypodermic needle lymph,\r\n  which may contain embryos, exudes. This test together with their\r\n  slow disappearance on lying down and slow return on assuming the\r\n  upright position should differentiate hernia. When the contents of\r\n  a hernial sac are omental there is some difficulty in diagnosis. As\r\n  a rule it is not advisable to interfere surgically in this filarial\r\n  condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.—Varicose groin glands and elephantiasis of\r\nscrotum and penis. (From Ruge and zur Verth.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nFilarial Abscesses\r\n\r\nAs a rule injury to the adult filarial worms, which results in their\r\ndeath, is not followed by abscess formation but such termination\r\nmay occur. These abscesses have been found deeply seated in the\r\nextremities. Wise and Minett in a careful examination of 28 such\r\ncases found evidences of adult filariae in 22 cases. In 21 of these\r\nabscesses, infections with streptococci or staphylococci were\r\ndemonstrated. Very interesting also is the finding of filarial worms\r\nin deep-seated abdominal abscesses.\r\n\r\n  As regards location, these filarial abscesses were found 31 times\r\n  in the pelvis of the kidney, 18 times in the epididymis, 12 times\r\n  in the retro-peritoneal tissues, 25 times in the inguinal glands,\r\n  4 times in the ilio-psoas muscles and 8 times in the lymphatic\r\n  vessels.\r\n\r\n  They regard the endemic funiculitis to which attention has been\r\n  directed by Castellani as simply a similar process involving\r\n  the tissues about the spermatic cord. The treatment of filarial\r\n  abscesses is similar to that of other abscesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nChyluria\r\n\r\nAs the result of obstruction of the lymphatic vessels varices may\r\nform in the bladder lymphatics and, as the result of their rupture,\r\nmilky urine may be passed. If the thoracic duct be occluded the\r\nurine will show an abundance of fat, while if the obstruction exists\r\nonly in other lymphatics, the milky fluid will be found to show but\r\nlittle fat. Blood is usually present in chyluria so that the urine\r\nwill show an pinkish tinge.\r\n\r\n  Chylous urine coagulates rapidly and we have in such a specimen of\r\n  urine, upon standing, an upper fatty layer and pinkish sediment at\r\n  the bottom, with a clot between.\r\n\r\n  The sediment shows lymphocytes and at times filarial embryos. When\r\n  the exudate is lymph mixed with blood the term haematolymphuria\r\n  would be a better one.\r\n\r\n  Clots may form in the bladder and give rise to obstruction to the\r\n  flow of urine from the bladder.\r\n\r\n  The appearance of the chyluria is often preceded by heaviness about\r\n  the loins and pains in the region of the bladder.\r\n\r\n  The morning urine in such a case is apt to be clear while that\r\n  passed later in the day is milky in appearance.\r\n\r\n  A feature of chyluria is its tendency to disappear and reappear\r\n  so that when treating such a case one should be conservative in\r\n  considering the treatment as effecting a cure.\r\n\r\n  It is difficult to understand why chyluria should be common in\r\n  India and China while almost unknown in the filarial infections of\r\n  the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\n  In treating a case of chyluria one should enjoin rest in bed,\r\n  laxatives and a restriction of fluids and fats. Patients subject\r\n  to the condition should refrain from active exercise and other\r\n  conditions which might cause fatigue. Drugs are of little value.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilarial Orchitis and Hydrocele\r\n\r\nThe condition rather resembles an attack of epididymitis. As a result\r\nof recurring attacks hydrocele develops. The fluid may be lymphous\r\nor chylous in appearance and upon microscopical examination may show\r\nfilarial embryos. These filarial hydroceles seemed to be the most\r\ncommon manifestations of the disease as observed in the Philippines.\r\nThese hydroceles or chyloceles do not become very large but may\r\nrequire tapping.\r\n\r\n\r\nElephantiasis\r\n\r\nAs the result of recurring attacks of lymphangitis the tissues of\r\nthe affected part show the effects of lymphatic obstruction by an\r\nhypertrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It would seem that\r\nthe combination of lymphatic obstruction and bacterial infection is\r\nnecessary for the production of elephantiasis. The skin of a part\r\naffected with elephantiasis is rough and the hair scanty. In addition\r\nto the lymphoedema of the part there is a great increase in the\r\nconnective tissue.\r\n\r\n  On account of the lymphatic stasis incision into the blubbery\r\n  tissue causes the outpouring of much lymph.\r\n\r\n  Elephantiasis of the lower extremities is by far the most common\r\n  situation, giving us probably 90% of such affections. In Fiji\r\n  elephantiasis of the upper extremities is quite common.\r\n\r\n  Other favorite sites are the scrotum, vulva, breasts and penis.\r\n  Rarely the scalp or areas about neck or trunk may show involvement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 100.—Elephantiasis of the legs. (From Ruge and\r\n  zur Verth.)]\r\n\r\n  Surgical treatment is the one usually followed. When an extremity\r\n  becomes too much of a burden, amputation may be indicated. The\r\n  employment of the method of lymphangioplasty, which consists in\r\n  the introduction of silk threads into the subcutaneous tissues,\r\n  to make a channel to the normal lymphatics, does not seem to have\r\n  been attended with any degree of success or at any rate permanent\r\n  results. These wounds tend to become infected and if this does not\r\n  occur the new channels are speedily obliterated.\r\n\r\nCastellani recommends the use of Merck’s fibrolysin in injections of\r\nfrom 2 to 4 cc. daily, for three to six months. After each injection\r\nthe part is tightly bandaged with flannel or rubber bandages. The\r\ninjections may either be made into the affected part or into the\r\ngluteal region. Massage prior to the bandaging may give better\r\nresults. When the limb becomes smaller and the skin smoother, long\r\nstrips of skin and subcutaneous tissue may be dissected out and the\r\nadjacent edges sutured.\r\n\r\n  In considering the advantages of operation in elephantiasis of the\r\n  scrotum it is usually stated that the only question involved is the\r\n  removal of a burdensome mass which in no way is a source of danger\r\n  to the life of the patient. At the same time such patients are\r\n  subject to attacks of elephantoid fever, a condition not without\r\n  its dangers. There is one factor not usually brought forward and\r\n  that is the remarkable effect of a successful operation on the\r\n  mental state of the patient. This is well shown in the accompanying\r\n  illustrations of the patient before and after operation. If\r\n  sexual deficiencies are of so powerful an influence on persons of\r\n  education how much greater must they weigh on an uneducated native\r\n  with but few of the higher interests of life.\r\n\r\n  Prior to operation the patient should be kept in bed for a day\r\n  or so to lessen the amount of fluid and to secure relaxation of\r\n  tissues. Thorough scrubbing with soap and water the day of and the\r\n  day before the operation and the use of alcohol as an antiseptic\r\n  are important. Some prefer iodine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.—Elephantiasis of the scrotum. Before\r\noperation. (Fauntleroy.)]\r\n\r\n  For the operation the lithotomy position is employed. An assistant\r\n  supports the scrotal tumor wrapped in a sterile towel. Fauntleroy,\r\n  whose method I give, does not recommend a tourniquet to the base of\r\n  the tumor as in his opinion it assists but little in controlling\r\n  haemorrhage and endangers asepsis. Haemostats answer better and as\r\n  the vessels which give most trouble are deeply situated the elastic\r\n  cord would not affect them. In some cases there is very little\r\n  bleeding. The upper part of the pear-shaped tumor usually affords\r\n  sufficient sound skin next the thighs for the flaps. As a rule\r\n  the elephantoid tissue does not involve the upper 2 or 3 inches\r\n  of the skin anteriorly, which is thus available to cover in the\r\n  base of the penis. In addition to this covering for the penis we\r\n  have a long prepuce which has been considerably stretched so that\r\n  after removing all elephantoid tissue there is enough sound prepuce\r\n  remaining to cover the distal 2 or 3 inches, so that usually there\r\n  is sufficient sound skin for a 5-inch penis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.—Elephantiasis of the scrotum. After\r\noperation. Note change in mental state. (Fauntleroy.)]\r\n\r\n  The flaps which are to cover the penis and testicles should be\r\n  mapped out with shallow incisions and care must be exercised that\r\n  only sound skin is included in these flaps. A horseshoe shaped\r\n  incision is made commencing at the left side of the base of the\r\n  tumor about 1 inch from the thigh and about at the level of the\r\n  penis in health. The incision is carried downward and passes just\r\n  below the opening of the penis on the tumor surface. A similar\r\n  incision on the right side completes the horseshoe curve. Next a\r\n  downward incision in the sound skin is made over the posterior\r\n  surface of the tumor, thus encircling the base of the scrotum. The\r\n  anterior horseshoe incision is now deepened to free the penis,\r\n  care being taken not to injure the spermatic cord. Next the\r\n  incisions are deepened laterally until the testicles are reached.\r\n  The testicles are usually in the center of the tumor imbedded in\r\n  a blubbery tissue from which they can be easily stripped. The\r\n  remains of the gubernacula are then hooked up and cut close to the\r\n  testicles. The tunicae vaginales are often thickened and contain\r\n  fluid which has to be drawn off.\r\n\r\n  In 60% of Fauntleroy’s cases it was necessary to remove one\r\n  testicle on account of extensive disease. One must also bear in\r\n  mind the possibility of hernial complications and undescended\r\n  testicle.\r\n\r\n  A sound is now introduced into the urethra and the septum of the\r\n  scrotum divided close to the sheath of the penis, then dissecting\r\n  away the blubbery tissue. At this stage there may be considerable\r\n  bleeding.\r\n\r\n  The testicles and spermatic cords are then dissected away from the\r\n  tunicae vaginales. The penis is now freed by a circular incision\r\n  around and above the opening in the anterior part of the mass.\r\n  The remainder of the horseshoe flap is now dissected up and the\r\n  penis freed. The proximal covering for the penis is made from this\r\n  horseshoe flap which is stitched to the distal one shaped from the\r\n  prepuce, carefully trimmed of elephantoid tissue.\r\n\r\n  The lateral flaps are brought together with linen or silk-worm gut\r\n  sutures leaving space for a drainage tube and we thus form a new\r\n  scrotum for the testicles.\r\n\r\n  The mortality is usually given as 5% but Fauntleroy did not lose a\r\n  case among 149 such operations, the tumors varying from 10 to 85\r\n  pounds in weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nChylous Hydrocele\r\n\r\nFilarial affections of the tunica vaginalis or the testicle itself\r\nare not rare. In the milky fluid obtained by tapping such a hydrocele\r\nwe may find filarial embryos.\r\n\r\n  Besides chylous hydrocele we may have a chylous ascites or a\r\n  chylous diarrhoea. Where there is no obstruction to the thoracic\r\n  duct there is less fat and the condition is more properly a\r\n  lymphocele rather than a chylocele. The same distinction is\r\n  applicable to the other conditions connected with lymphatic varices\r\n  due to lymphatic obstructions other than that of the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe blood from a needle prick of the finger tip or the lobe of the\r\near can be examined as a fresh preparation. It is advisable to make a\r\nvaseline ring around the drop of blood on the slide and then apply a\r\ncover-glass. Such a preparation will permit of the examination of the\r\nliving embryos for a day or more.\r\n\r\n  Smear preparations may be made by the Ehrlich method of drawing\r\n  cover glasses apart or by the Daniels method on slides. Some\r\n  prefer making a thick smear of a drop of blood and, after it\r\n  has dried, carefully to dehaemoglobinize it with water and then\r\n  staining with dilute haemotoxylin. Staining with Leishman’s or\r\n  Wright’s stain gives beautiful pictures. Fixation with methyl\r\n  alcohol or with heat, by burning off a film of alcohol, and then\r\n  staining with Giemsa’s stain or some haematoxylin preparation, is\r\n  to be recommended. On the whole I consider haematoxylin the most\r\n  desirable staining reagent, as such preparations hold their color\r\n  for a long time. The paper-like sheaths are seen as if twisted\r\n  about the larvae with their violet-stained cells. One should note a\r\n  break in the violet-stained cell column which is 50µ from the head\r\n  end of _F. bancrofti_ and 40µ for _L. loa_.\r\n\r\n  A V spot is seen posterior to the break in the cell column and\r\n  shows best with very light staining.\r\n\r\nThe break in the column of the cell nuclei marks the position of\r\nthe nerve ring, which is distant from the head one-fifth the total\r\nlength. The anterior spot, below the break in the cell column, is\r\ndistant about 30% of the total length. It is the location of the\r\nexcretory pore. In _F. bancrofti_ the cell nuclei extend to 95% of\r\nlength, thus differing from those of _L. loa_, which fill up the tail\r\nend. At about 82% of the length from the head is located the anal\r\npore.\r\n\r\n  Ruge’s thick film method for malarial parasites gives excellent\r\n  results in staining filarial embryos. Either the Giemsa or\r\n  haemotoxylin staining may be employed.\r\n\r\n  Embryos may be found in the lymph from varicose groin glands or in\r\n  the exudate from a chylous hydrocele, as well as in the urinary\r\n  sediment from a case of chyluria.\r\n\r\nThe failure to find embryos in no way negatives the existence of a\r\nfilarial infection.\r\n\r\n  Adult filariae, either alive or dead and calcified, may be found in\r\n  the lymphatic glands or in the contents of filarial abscesses.\r\n\r\n  The blood shows an eosinophilia.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOA LOA\r\n\r\nThis filarial infection is at present only known for the West Coast\r\nof Africa. In the Cameroons and in Old Calabar the infection is quite\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n  As noted in the table previously given, the adults which are a\r\n  little more than an inch long have cuticular protuberances or\r\n  bosses, about 12 to 15 microns in height. The sheathed embryo is\r\n  very similar to that of _F. bancrofti_, but has a more twisted\r\n  tail and shows a complete filling up of the tail end with rather\r\n  elongated cells. The lines of the curves of the embryo show\r\n  irregularities and are not the smooth lines characteristic of _F.\r\n  bancrofti_ embryos.\r\n\r\nThe periodicity is diurnal, for which reason the parasite was\r\noriginally termed _F. diurna_.\r\n\r\n  Leiper has reported two species of _Chrysops_, one of the tabanid\r\n  biting flies, as transmitting agents and considers that the embryos\r\n  undergo development in the salivary glands of the fly.\r\n\r\n  The life history is not well understood but as a rule a period of\r\n  several years elapses after infection before adult filariae or\r\n  filarial embryos are found. Again, for some reason, adult filariae\r\n  may be noted and when extracted be found full of embryos and yet\r\n  embryos not be found in the peripheral circulation.\r\n\r\n  The adults are noted for their tendency to move about in the\r\n  subcutaneous connective tissues having been found in such tissues\r\n  in the region of scalp, trunk, penis and extremities.\r\n\r\n  Most frequently, however, they are noted in the tissues about the\r\n  region of the eyes and even under the conjunctivae, from which\r\n  location they have been frequently extracted. It is this which has\r\n  caused the name _Filaria oculi_ to be given the worm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.—_L. loa_ above. _Acanthocheilonema\r\nperstans_ below. (From Greene, after Fülleborn.)]\r\n\r\nThe course of the wandering worm is usually marked by an oedematous\r\ntrack. In his own case, recently reported by a medical man, the\r\nfirst symptoms were transient painless swellings about the joints,\r\nassociated with stiffness. Various diagnoses, such as rheumatism,\r\nerythema nodosum and angioneurotic oedema were made in his case.\r\nAlthough two adult filariae were removed at different times the blood\r\nexaminations were negative for embryos.\r\n\r\n  As a rule the appearance of the worms in the subcutaneous tissues\r\n  is characterized by itching sensations and a feeling of tension.\r\n  Warmth causes them to appear in the superficial tissues while\r\n  cold makes them confine themselves to the deeper structures.\r\n  Eosinophilia is rather pronounced.\r\n\r\n=Calabar Swellings.=—Although we have no absolute proof that these\r\nusually painless swellings, which occur rather suddenly on various\r\nparts of the body having only a thin layer of connective tissue, as\r\nforearms, face, ankles, hands, are connected with an infection with\r\n_L. loa_, yet such is the general view. These swellings are about the\r\nsize of a hen’s egg, do not pit on pressure and last for about three\r\ndays. There is marked tension over the swellings and they may itch\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.—_L. loa_ in the subcutaneous tissues, twice\r\nnormal size. (From Greene, after Fülleborn.)]\r\n\r\n  Rarely does one note more than one swelling at a time. Eosinophilia\r\n  is quite marked during the attacks. Manson thinks the oedema\r\n  results from the extrusion of embryos from the female at the site\r\n  of the swelling. Ward considers the cause to be toxic material\r\n  excreted by the worm.\r\n\r\n  There is very little of importance in connection with treatment.\r\n  When the worms, which travel in the tissues about the eye, at the\r\n  rate of about ½ inch per minute, are noted, some local anaesthetic\r\n  may be used and the worm seized with forceps and extracted through\r\n  a small incision. Elliot recommends the application of hot\r\n  fomentations to the eye and upon the appearance of the worm under\r\n  the conjunctiva to instill cocaine solution, seize the worm with\r\n  forceps and then pass a silk ligature through the conjunctival\r\n  fold taking in the worm. The ligature is tied and an incision made\r\n  through which the worm is extracted. Cooling local applications, or\r\n  an ichthyol ointment, may be applied to the Calabar swellings.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCHOCERCA VOLVULUS\r\n\r\nThis name is given to a filarial worm, found principally on the\r\nWest Coast of Africa, which causes the formation of subcutaneous\r\ntumors. In certain localities as many as 10% of the population may be\r\ninfected. More recently the parasite has been reported from Guatemala.\r\n\r\n  It is supposed that the adult worms cause an inflammation of the\r\n  lymphatic vessel in which they may lie and that a formation of\r\n  new connective tissue results, giving rise to a tumor-like mass,\r\n  which is most often found in the axilla or about the sides of the\r\n  thorax. This tissue stroma encompasses the worms except for the\r\n  anterior extremity of the female, with its uterine opening, and the\r\n  posterior extremity of the male carrying the spicules, which ends\r\n  lie loose in a sort of cyst-like dilatation, which is filled with\r\n  a viscid fluid swarming with unsheathed embryos. These tumor-like\r\n  masses cause very little discomfort, last indefinitely and do not\r\n  tend to ulcerate.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly thought that these larvae were absent from the\r\nperipheral circulation but more recent investigations in cases of\r\nonchocerciasis have shown sheathless larvae in the blood, which had\r\nthe characteristics of those in the contents of the tumors. Such\r\nfindings, however, are of extreme rarity, the blood examination being\r\nalmost invariably negative.\r\n\r\n  The cysts are usually found on the sides of the chest and are quite\r\n  superficial, with the skin freely movable over them. They may be as\r\n  large as a hen’s egg but usually are smaller. They are also found\r\n  over trochanters or along the crests of the ilium.\r\n\r\nDubois states that the embryos may be found in juice from puncture of\r\ngroin glands.\r\n\r\n  The tumors are easily enucleated.\r\n\r\n  In the American infections the tumours are more common in the\r\n  regions near the eye and it has been thought that certain cases of\r\n  keratitis may be due to onchocerciasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRACUNCULUS MEDINENSIS\r\n\r\nThe disease caused by infection with this parasite is usually termed\r\ndracontiasis and the parasite _Dracunculus medinensis_ or the Guinea\r\nworm.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution includes India, Arabia, the West Coast\r\nof Africa and Brazil.\r\n\r\n  _Life History._—The male has not surely been seen in man so that\r\n  the pathological condition is entirely connected with the female\r\n  worm. Almost invariably the female worm, which measures about\r\n  two feet long by 1/12 inch broad, tends to wander down to the\r\n  connective tissue structures of the lower extremity. In about 10%\r\n  of the cases the worm may present elsewhere, as scrotum, back or\r\n  arms. At the posterior extremity there is a sort of anchoring hook.\r\n\r\n  With the anterior extremity the worm presses against the overlying\r\n  skin and causes the formation of a blister-like lesion.\r\n\r\n  This vesicle later on bursts and, if water is applied to the\r\n  spot, a delicate tube, the uterus, is extruded and there exude a\r\n  few drops of a milky fluid, which swarms with the sharp-tailed,\r\n  striated, sheathless embryos. It is thought that the pouring forth\r\n  of embryos, when water touches the part, is in order that the\r\n  embryos may reach the water of a pool through which the infected\r\n  native may be wading. Once in the water of such a pool, the larvae\r\n  are swallowed by _Cyclops_ and gaining the body cavity of this\r\n  little crustacean, they continue to develop for about one month.\r\n\r\n  During this period there are two ecdyses, the first after about two\r\n  weeks, when the tail becomes blunt.\r\n\r\nWhen one takes these infected cyclops into the stomach, by drinking\r\nwater containing them, the cyclops is killed by the gastric juice\r\nand the Guinea worm larva breaks out of the dead intermediary host\r\nand bores its way through the stomach wall and possibly goes to the\r\ntissues about the retroperitoneal region. As a matter of fact we are\r\nin ignorance of the exact cycle which goes on, until the fertilized\r\nfemale, with her embryo-distended uterine tube, reaches the lower\r\nextremity. A cross section of the female shows the body of the worm\r\nto be almost entirely made up of uterus, with an insignificant\r\nalimentary canal pressed to one side.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is from 8 to 12 months.\r\n\r\n  Usually there are no other symptoms than discomfort from the\r\n  blister and a feeling of heaviness about the affected extremity. At\r\n  times there may be pain and fever. The parasite may fail to gain\r\n  exit to the skin surface or die before reaching maturity. In such\r\n  cases she may become calcified or give rise to abscess formation.\r\n  The _x_-ray plate may show a convoluted cord-like structure with\r\n  frequent breaks in the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.—Guinea worm (_D. medinensis_). Rolled on a\r\nstick for gradual extraction. (From Greene’s Medical Diagnosis.)]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—By douching the point of exit we may cause the uterus\r\nto empty itself in about three weeks. At that time we may commence\r\nextraction by intermittent traction by winding the worm around a\r\nlarge toothpick or similar object. If undue force is exerted the worm\r\nmay break off and abscess formation or sloughing result.\r\n\r\nMacfie has reported success in treating 23 cases of dracontiasis\r\nwith tartar emetic. He gave 1 grain intravenously every other day\r\nand found that it was not necessary to give more than 6 grains in\r\nthe course of treatment. The inflammation quickly yielded and the\r\ndischarge from the sore ceased rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE SCHISTOSOMIASES\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nThere is a group of diseases, caused by trematodes of the family\r\nSchistosomidae, to which we apply the name schistosomiasis. The\r\nSchistosomidae differ from other human flukes (Trematoda) by not\r\nbeing hermaphroditic and by having nonoperculated eggs. From these\r\neggs a ciliated embryo (miracidium) emerges which gains entrance to\r\ncertain species of molluscs. In this intermediate host the miracidium\r\ngives rise to a sporocyst, which latter forms daughter sporocysts.\r\nThese emerge from the mother cyst and enter the digestive gland of\r\nthe mollusc and produce cercariae.\r\n\r\n  These cercariae show an absence of a pharynx and upon the rupturing\r\n  of the sporocyst are discharged from the mollusc and furnish the\r\n  infecting stage for penetrating the skin of man or other animal.\r\n\r\nThere are those who think the entrance is effected through mucous\r\nmembranes, especially those of the mouth, genitalia and anus and even\r\nthe nasal mucosa.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that infection by drinking water, containing\r\nthe ciliated embryos, is impossible, owing to the rapidity of their\r\ndestruction by solutions of HCl of similar strength to that of the\r\ngastric juice.\r\n\r\nInfecting mice with _S. japonicum_ cercariae from snails mashed on\r\nthe abdominal surface of the mouse, it was found by Suyeyasu that\r\nafter penetrating the skin the cercariae went to the right heart by\r\nway of venous and lymphatic channels. From the pulmonary vessels they\r\npenetrate the lungs and go by way of the mediastinum or pleura to the\r\ndiaphragm which they penetrate and make their way to the abdominal\r\ncavity next penetrating the liver and entering the portal vein.\r\n\r\n  It is probable that the earlier stages of development take place\r\n  in the portal vein and that having reached maturity the female\r\n  attaches herself to the male and together they go, by way of\r\n  the inferior mesenteric vein, to the haemorrhoidal or vesical\r\n  terminals. The male is in the shape of a narrow leaf, about ½\r\n  inch long with a ventrally turned oral sucker and a closely\r\n  adjacent ventral sucker. The female is a somewhat longer and\r\n  cylindrical worm almost an inch in length and, like the male, has\r\n  two suckers. There is a dark brown zig-zag stripe which shows\r\n  prominently in the posterior part of the female and outlines the\r\n  blood-filled intestinal tract. When the female applies herself to\r\n  the ventral surface of the male there is an infolding of the sides\r\n  of the flattened surface giving the male a cylindrical outline\r\n  and resulting in the formation of a canal containing the female\r\n  (gynaecophoric canal).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.—_Schistosoma japonicum_ (male and female).\r\nThe sharp edges of the borders at the beginning of the gynaecophoric\r\ncanal formed by the male are an accidental appearance. (From Mense.)]\r\n\r\nThe males of the flukes which cause the vesical (_Schistosoma\r\nhaematobium_) and the rectal (_Schistosoma mansoni_) involvement are\r\ncovered externally with small tubercles and have a ventral sucker\r\nonly slightly larger than the oral one. The Japanese schistosome\r\n(_Schistosoma japonicum_) is slightly smaller, has a smooth surface\r\nand shows a prominent pedunculated ventral sucker of much larger size\r\nthan the oral one.\r\n\r\n  Both suckers are larger than those of the other species.\r\n\r\n  The eggs of _S. haematobium_ have a terminal spine and measure from\r\n  115 to 175 by 60 microns; those of _S. mansoni_ have a lateral\r\n  spine and measure from 110 to 125 by 50 microns while those of _S.\r\n  japonicum_ are devoid of spinous projections and measure about 100\r\n  by 70 microns.\r\n\r\nClinically, the three infections differ as will be noted further on.\r\n\r\n  Looss claims that the two tuberculated species are identical and\r\n  that the lateral spined egg is the product of an unfertilized\r\n  female. He has more recently regarded the egg as produced\r\n  parthenogenetically. Other helminthologists have noted slight\r\n  anatomical differences as to ovaries and testicles so that the\r\n  consensus of opinion is that vesical and rectal bilharziases are\r\n  caused by different species of the genus _Schistosoma_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.—Ovum of _Schistosoma japonicum_. By J. A.\r\nThomson. (Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\nRecently Leiper has found cercariae showing the absence of a pharynx\r\n(characteristic of the genus) in a Japanese mollusc. Such molluscs\r\nwere teased out in water and laboratory bred mice immersed therein.\r\nOne of these mice was killed a month later and adult schistosomes\r\nwere found in the portal vessels. Leiper has also found cercariae\r\nshowing absence of pharynx in four different species of molluscs\r\nin Egypt. With such molluscs he was able to infect white rats and\r\nother animals. He states that infection with these cercariae from the\r\nmollusc host can bring about infection either by way of the mouth or\r\nthrough the skin. Sodium bisulphate in a strength of 1 to 1000 killed\r\nthese cercariae almost immediately.\r\n\r\n  It would therefore seem proven that all human schistosome\r\n  infections take place following cercarial and not miracidial\r\n  development. As proof that _S. haematobium_ and _S. mansoni_ are\r\n  different species, Leiper notes that mice infected by molluscs of\r\n  the genus _Bullinus_ showed schistosomes with terminal spined eggs,\r\n  the ovary lying in the lower half of the female. The male had four\r\n  or five large testes. In mice infected by molluscs of the genus\r\n  _Planorbis_, the eggs were lateral spined, the ovary was in the\r\n  anterior half of the body and the male had eight small testicles.\r\n\r\n  The mollusc host of _S. japonicum_ is _Blanfordia nosophora_. The\r\n  shell of this snail is of cornucopia shape.\r\n\r\nAs these flukes are found in the blood vessels they are often\r\nreferred to as the blood flukes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nVesical schistosomiasis has undoubtedly existed in Egypt since\r\nancient periods as vesical calculi are frequent in the mummies of\r\nvarious dynasties. Ruffer has found calcified schistosome ova in the\r\nkidney of a mummy.\r\n\r\n  The French troops suffered greatly from the disease in 1800. It was\r\n  Bilharz in Cairo, in 1851, who first associated the haematuria with\r\n  the presence of the parasite and it is from his name that we get\r\n  the designation bilharziasis or bilharziosis for the disease.\r\n\r\n  In 1903, Manson found lateral spined eggs in a patient from the\r\n  West Indies who was suffering from rectal rather than bladder\r\n  symptoms. In 1907 Sambon, considering the points of difference\r\n  between the eggs and the involvement of rectum rather than bladder,\r\n  established a new species, _S. mansoni_.\r\n\r\n  In the West Indies, as shown by the reports of Surgeon Holcomb from\r\n  Porto Rico, rectal bilharziasis is rather common.\r\n\r\n  For a number of years Japanese physicians had noted the existence\r\n  of a disease characterized by splenic and hepatic enlargement,\r\n  ascites and cachexia. In August, 1904, Katsurada discovered ova\r\n  with a ciliated embryo in the stools of patients with this disease.\r\n  He found schistosomes in the portal vessels of dogs and cats\r\n  containing eggs similar to those seen in the human cases. He named\r\n  this trematode _S. japonicum_. In November, 1904, Catto discovered\r\n  the parasite at an autopsy on a Chinaman. In 1910 Lambert, in\r\n  China, described a disease, which he called urticarial fever,\r\n  and a short time afterward Houghton established the connection\r\n  between this disease and the more advanced stages of Japanese\r\n  schistosomiasis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.—Ovum of _Schistosoma haematobium_. By\r\nWilliam Pepper. (Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.—Ovum of _Schistosoma mansoni_. By William\r\nPepper. (Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe pathological lesions are almost entirely due to the irritation\r\nof the eggs with resulting connective tissue increase or ulcerative\r\nprocesses. For some reason these flukes select the inferior\r\nmesenteric vein and make their way to the vesical plexus of veins in\r\nthe case of _S. haematobium_ and to the haemorrhoidal vessels for the\r\nother species. At times the ova or worms may be carried over to the\r\nsystemic veins by way of the channels of anastomosis. In the terminal\r\nvessels the female gives off the eggs which penetrate the adjacent\r\nmucosa giving rise to inflammatory thickenings and the extrusion of\r\nthe irritating eggs into the lumen of the bladder or rectum.\r\n\r\n  In the bladder these terminal spined eggs cause haematuria and form\r\n  the nucleus for vesical calculi. The mucosa may also show wart-like\r\n  excrescences. If the eggs are swept back through the portal vessels\r\n  to the liver an interlobular cirrhosis results which would seem to\r\n  be due entirely to the irritation of these egg emboli and not to\r\n  toxic products of the worms themselves. Marked ureteral and kidney\r\n  lesions may result as complications of cystitis or primarily from\r\n  irritation by ova. In women the vagina, vulva and cervix uteri may\r\n  show papillomatous thickenings. Bilharzial lesions of the male\r\n  urethra are not uncommon and may lead to fibroid thickenings and\r\n  fistula.\r\n\r\n  In searching for the flukes at autopsy we should make a\r\n  longitudinal slit in the portal vein and with a spoon scoop out the\r\n  blood and search for the parasites in a glass dish.\r\n\r\nIn the intestinal form of schistosomiasis the rectum may be studded\r\nwith polypoid tumors which when projecting from the anus may ulcerate\r\nand lead to a diagnosis of cancer of the rectum. In sections from\r\nthese masses great numbers of lateral spined eggs may be found.\r\n\r\n  The connective tissue increase is in the submucosa. The gut section\r\n  may also present small abscess-like areas.\r\n\r\n  Eggs have been found in the appendix as well as in the large\r\n  intestines and the small intestine has been found involved in one\r\n  case. In rare instances ova have been found in the lungs, spleen\r\n  and even in the brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\n  By digesting selected tissues in 4% NaOH at 75°C. and centrifuging\r\n  one may find eggs which otherwise would be overlooked. Statistics\r\n  from Cairo usually note 30 to 40% of infection in natives but\r\n  Ferguson employing all methods found 61% infected at autopsies on\r\n  600 males. In all forms of schistosomiasis but particularly in the\r\n  Japanese infection, eosinophilia is pronounced.\r\n\r\nIn Japanese schistosomiasis the intestines may show thickenings at\r\nthe site of aggregations of eggs. In the liver a marked interlobular\r\ncirrhosis occurs with numerous eggs in the connective tissue\r\nincrease. Rarely, eggs may lodge in the brain, giving granuloma-like\r\nareas. The irritating eggs may also give rise to similar areas in the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nVesical Schistosomiasis or Endemic Haematuria\r\n\r\nThis form of the disease is chiefly found in Egypt, Syria, Uganda\r\nand South Africa. It is caused by _S. haematobium_ and the period of\r\nincubation is approximately six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.—Vesical schistosomiasis showing fistulous\r\ntracts opening from penis and scrotum. (From Ruge and zur Verth.)]\r\n\r\nThe first symptoms are pricking sensations about urethra and slight\r\nhaematuria which comes on at the end of the act of micturition.\r\nExcesses or fatigue are apt to increase the haematuria. The diagnosis\r\nis made by finding the ova in the sediment of the centrifuged urine.\r\n\r\n  Symptoms of cystitis and even pyelitis may follow the early\r\n  bladder and urethral manifestations. Pain in the back or symptoms\r\n  suggesting renal colic may be present. Anaemia and physical\r\n  weakness gradually develop. An important sequel is vesical\r\n  calculus. It is a question whether the eggs or some other product\r\n  of the infection form the nucleus of such a stone. Not only can\r\n  stone be recognized by cystoscopy but rather distinctive are\r\n  small, glazed yellowish nodules with areas of granulation tissue.\r\n  Papillomatous growths may also be seen upon cystoscopy.\r\n\r\n  Perineal fistulae in the male and vaginitis in the female may be\r\n  noted.\r\n\r\n  When reinfection does not occur the haematuria tends slowly to\r\n  disappear but recovery does not usually take place for several\r\n  years. The vesical schistosome (_S. haematobium_) often causes\r\n  pathological changes in the rectum so that a case may show both\r\n  vesical and rectal symptoms. The rectal schistosome (_S. mansoni_)\r\n  does not give rise to vesical trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nRectal Schistosomiasis\r\n\r\nWhile terminal spined eggs may be found in rectal lesions, but\r\nusually combined with lateral spined eggs, in countries where the\r\nvesical form of the disease exists, yet there are many parts of\r\nthe world where, with the exclusive existence of an intestinal\r\nbilharziasis, only lateral spined eggs are found. The infection\r\nresulting from _S. mansoni_ is the sole one in the West Indies, Congo\r\nFree State and in North-eastern South America.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are usually those of a chronic dysentery with more or\r\nless tenesmus and straining. Prolapse is a common result and is the\r\ncause of the ulcerations which may cause the disease to be diagnosed\r\nas cancer. Cirrhosis of the liver is more apt to occur than in pure\r\nvesical schistosomiasis.\r\n\r\n  Most writers fail to mention other than the later manifestations\r\n  of rectal bilharziasis, the earlier symptoms being overlooked\r\n  or attributed to other causes. The same was true of Japanese\r\n  schistosomiasis in which the initial “urticarial fever” was only\r\n  recognized as connected with the late manifestations of liver\r\n  cirrhosis and ascites a few years ago.\r\n\r\n  In 1916 Lawton noted in a number of Australian soldiers, encamped\r\n  in Egypt, a fever of about 7 to 10 days’ duration in which the\r\n  evening rise approximated 103°F. A diarrhoea and abdominal pain\r\n  accompanied the fever and along with this a cough and patchy\r\n  consolidation. Most of the cases showed urticaria which lasted from\r\n  one to seven days. All cases showed a well marked eosinophilia.\r\n  The diagnosis, but frequently only after prolonged and continued\r\n  search, was made by the finding of the lateral spined eggs of _S.\r\n  mansoni_. The period of incubation in these cases seemed to be from\r\n  one to three months.\r\n\r\n\r\nJapanese Schistosomiasis\r\n\r\nThis is also called Katayama disease and in its early stages\r\nurticarial fever or Yangtse fever. It is caused by the\r\nnontuberculated species, _S. japonicum_, which is characterized by\r\nthe egg without a spine.\r\n\r\n  Laning, in a study of 7 well-controlled cases, has shown that the\r\n  disease sets in after two or three days from the time of exposure\r\n  to infection, by wading through paddy fields or still waters of\r\n  infected ponds or lakes. The disease occurs in China, Japan and\r\n  possibly in the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A B\r\n\r\nFIG. 111.—A and B, Case of _Schistosoma japonicum_. Severe infection\r\nof three years’ duration. Ova very abundant in stools. Liver dullness\r\ndiminished. Spleen not enlarged. (From Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease may be divided into 3 stages: the 1st, that\r\nof urticarial, pulmonary and febrile manifestations, which lasts\r\nabout a month; the 2d, where ova begin to show in the small mass of\r\nbloody mucus which may cap the stool, and finally the 3d stage with\r\ncirrhosis of the liver, ascites, cachexia and death.\r\n\r\n  In the 1st stage we have headache and an evening rise of\r\n  temperature to about 101°F. or 102°F. Shortly after the onset\r\n  urticarial lesions, which may be 2 or 3 inches in diameter, may\r\n  appear and disappear on various parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe pulse rate is usually low. Very characteristic and early\r\nmanifestations are those of the pulmonary involvement. Here\r\noedematous patches may give the signs of crepitation and\r\nconsolidation to rapidly disappear and reappear in another part of\r\nthe lungs.\r\n\r\nThese pulmonary manifestations and the associated fever frequently\r\ncause a diagnosis of broncho-pneumonia to be made. A dry hacking\r\ncough appears early and with the fever, etc., may make one think\r\nof tuberculosis. The urticarial lesions often cause a diagnosis of\r\nptomaine poisoning to be made. The blood examination shows a marked\r\neosinophilia, of from 30 to 60%.\r\n\r\nThe 2d stage shows more or less intestinal disturbance with at times\r\nbloody mucus containing ova. The ova may not be present for long\r\nintervals or may never be found. Where reinfection does not take\r\nplace the patient tends to recover but if exposure to infection be\r\nkept up then the 3d stage sets in with rather marked dysenteric\r\nmanifestations, emaciation, anaemia, ascites, dropsy and a terminal\r\ncachexia.\r\n\r\n  The bladder never seems to be involved in Japanese schistosomiasis.\r\n  The eggs, however may be carried to the brain and produce symptoms\r\n  of Jacksonian epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThis consists in the search for ova in the centrifuged urine of\r\nvesical bilharziasis or in the bloody mucus of the intestinal\r\nmanifestations of the disease. If one adds water to the urine the\r\nciliated embryo will be noticed to break out of the shell in a few\r\nminutes and move about actively as if in search for some host.\r\n\r\n  The eosinophilia is of great diagnostic value and is usually\r\n  associated with an increase in the leucocyte count.\r\n\r\n  Fairley has introduced a complement fixation reaction in diagnosis,\r\n  using an extract of the livers of infected snails as antigen. The\r\n  reaction appears early in the infection but disappears in the later\r\n  stages. It is a group reaction as the livers of Bullinus answer for\r\n  the _S. mansoni_ serum as well as for the specific _S. haematobium_\r\n  serum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS\r\n\r\nBathing should be allowed only in filtered water, there being an\r\nabsence of the infecting cercariae in such a supply.\r\n\r\n  Then, too, if a water which does not contain fresh water snails is\r\n  stored for three or four days the cercariae which might have been\r\n  present in the freshly pumped up water will have died out, such\r\n  free cercariae only surviving for about this period. The gastric\r\n  juice will destroy cercariae so that it would seem impossible for\r\n  an infection to occur by the alimentary tract atrium with the\r\n  exception that cercariae might bore their way through the buccal\r\n  mucosa as well as through the skin. The sterilization of the urine\r\n  of cases of vesical bilharziasis and of the faeces in other forms\r\n  should be carried out where practicable. It is now considered\r\n  practicable to eradicate carriers of the infection with antimony\r\n  treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nThe most important matter is to avoid places where the infection is\r\nknown to exist. If one must wade through infected waters the body\r\nshould be protected by canvas or other closely woven garments.\r\n\r\n  Of various treatments, having in view the destruction of the worm,\r\n  such as salvarsan, etc., none seem to have been of any value except\r\n  antimony.\r\n\r\n  Robertson has reported relief of symptoms from the administration\r\n  of 2 grains of thymol dissolved in half a drachm of benzine. The\r\n  treatment is continued for a few weeks. Others have not had good\r\n  results from this treatment. Local treatment is necessary in\r\n  treating the cystitis and prolapse of rectum. Operative procedures\r\n  are indicated where calculi exist.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by treatment with tartrate of antimony during\r\nthe past three years justify us in considering bilharziasis as a\r\ndisease which has a specific for its cure. Almost all cases will\r\nyield to a course of intravenous injections of from one-half to two\r\ngrains of the drug, commencing with the smaller dose. The drug should\r\nbe well diluted (25 to 50 cc. sterile saline). Some use a 1% solution\r\nbut the higher dilutions are safer from a standpoint of avoiding\r\nphlebitis. Intravenous injections are made twice weekly and the total\r\namount of drug given during the course should rarely exceed 25 to 30\r\ngrains. For details see under treatment of leishmaniasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nMINOR HELMINTHIC INFECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAGONIMIASIS\r\n\r\nGeneral Considerations\r\n\r\nThis is an infection with a trematode, _Paragonimus westermanni_ (_P.\r\nringeri_) (_Distoma pulmonale_). It is rather common in some parts of\r\nJapan and Formosa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.—_Paragonimus westermanni_: natural size; to\r\nleft showing ventral surface; to right showing dorsal surface. (Braun\r\nafter Katsuruda.) (From Tyson.)]\r\n\r\n  Arce has recently reported cases of paragonomiasis in three\r\n  Peruvians who had been in contact with Japanese immigrants.\r\n\r\n  In 1880, Baelz found the ova in the sputum of a case of haemoptysis\r\n  in a Japanese, as did also Manson in a Chinaman. Manson’s case\r\n  subsequently died and when autopsied showed in his lungs a fluke\r\n  which was responsible for the eggs seen by Manson. The fluke itself\r\n  is a little more than ⅓ of an inch (8 mm.) long and is almost round\r\n  on transverse section, there being, however, some flattening of\r\n  the ventral surface. The acetabulum is conspicuous and opens just\r\n  anterior to the middle of the ventral surface.\r\n\r\n  The branched testicles are posterior to the laterally placed uterus\r\n  and the genital pore opens below the acetabulum. The branched ovary\r\n  is opposite the uterus on the other side.\r\n\r\n  It is rather flesh-like in appearance and is covered with\r\n  scale-like spines. The flukes are usually found in tunnels in the\r\n  lungs, the walls of which are thickened connective tissue. These\r\n  tunnels result from hypertrophy of the bronchioles. There may be\r\n  also cysts formed from the breaking down of adjacent tunnel walls.\r\n  In addition to lung infection with this fluke, brain, liver and\r\n  intestinal infections may be found.\r\n\r\nThe life history and mode of infection of man, further than the\r\nmiracidium stage, has been unknown until recently. If the eggs in the\r\nsputum are shaken up with water and the water renewed from time to\r\ntime a ciliated embryo or miracidium develops after a few weeks and,\r\nat this time if one presses on a cover-glass covering some of these\r\nmore mature ova, the miracidium will break through the operculated\r\nextremity of the egg and swim about actively in the surrounding\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.—Sputum of man containing eggs of the lung\r\nfluke, greatly enlarged. (After Manson.)]\r\n\r\n  Nakagawa has found that the miracidia infest certain fresh water\r\n  molluscs and become cercariae in this first intermediate host. From\r\n  this host the cercariae go to certain fresh water crabs and encyst\r\n  in this second intermediate host, either in the liver or in the\r\n  gills. In Japan one of these crab hosts, _Potamon dehaanii_, is\r\n  eaten both raw and cooked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.—_Paragonimus westermanni_; photograph from\r\na sexually immature specimen. (From Tyson.)]\r\n\r\n  Experimental feeding of puppies on infected crabs brought about\r\n  infection with the lung fluke. It is thought that the fluke, after\r\n  leaving the cyst, goes through the intestine to the abdominal\r\n  cavity. Thence it perforates the diaphragm and enters the pleural\r\n  cavity, finally penetrating the lung to become encysted there. The\r\n  lung is the favorite site but wandering flukes may invade other\r\n  tissues and organs even invading the central nervous system.\r\n\r\n  Besides man, dogs, cats and especially hogs may be infected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptomatology, Diagnosis and Treatment\r\n\r\nThe case is usually considered as one of chronic bronchitis on\r\naccount of the occurrence of cough and morning expectoration of a\r\ngelatinous sputum which is usually brownish. It is popularly known\r\nas endemic haemoptysis for the reason that after violent exertion, or\r\nat times without manifest reason, attacks of haemoptysis of varying\r\ndegrees of severity come on. The signs on percussion are usually\r\ninsignificant while those on auscultation at the time of haemoptysis\r\nare often marked. The symptoms often disappear for months to again\r\nreappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.—Anatomy of trematoda (flukes) of man. _O\r\nS_, oesophageal sucker. _Ph_, pharynx. _Oes,_ oesophagus. _O P_,\r\ngenital pore. _V S_, ventral suckers or acetabulum. _Ut_, uterus.\r\n_Int_, intestines. _Ov_, ovary. _Sh G_, shell gland. _T_, testicles.\r\n_T G_, yolk glands or vitellaria. _Exc_, excretory pore.]\r\n\r\n  The course of the disease is very chronic, often lasting many\r\n  years. As a rule the patient is fairly well nourished although\r\n  recurring attacks of haemoptysis may bring on a rather marked\r\n  anaemia. Jacksonian epilepsy has been reported as occurring\r\n  in paragonomiasis, the ova being found in cysts of the brain.\r\n  There is some question as to whether some of the reports as to\r\n  paragonomiasis may not have been connected with infections with\r\n  Japanese schistosomiasis.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of endemic haemoptysis is readily made by finding the\r\noperculated eggs in the more or less sanguinolent sputum. These eggs\r\nare of a light yellow color and average 90 × 65 microns. One often\r\nsees Charcot-Leyden crystals in the sputum.\r\n\r\nAs prophylactic measures we should forbid uncooked crabs or crayfish.\r\nThe sputum should be sterilized.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is entirely symptomatic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.—Ova of _Clonorchis sinensis_. After Bell\r\nand Sutton. (Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLONORCHIOSIS\r\n\r\nThis is an infection due to a trematode, _Clonorchis endemicus_\r\n(_Opisthorchis sinensis_). It is also referred to as human liver\r\nfluke disease. It is true that the common liver fluke of sheep,\r\n_Fasciola hepatica_, may occur in man but such infections are rare,\r\nonly 23 cases having been reported. Another liver fluke of ruminants\r\nis the lancet fluke, _Dicrocoelium lanceatum_, but it is also\r\nunimportant for man, only 7 cases having been reported.\r\n\r\n  _Clonorchis_ infections are common in China and Japan, the fluke\r\n  being about ½ inch long by ⅛ inch wide. There is considerable\r\n  dispute as to whether we have a pathogenic and nonpathogenic\r\n  _Clonorchis_; the name _C. endemicus_ applying to the former and\r\n  _C. sinensis_ to the latter.\r\n\r\n  Looss considered the nonpathogenic _C. sinensis_ to be larger\r\n  (13-19 mm.), to show pigment in its parenchyma and to have breaks\r\n  in the vitelline glands. _C. endemicus_ was reported as smaller (10\r\n  to 13 mm.), and without pigment or breaks in the continuity of the\r\n  vitellaria.\r\n\r\n  The eggs of this fluke show slightly concave bending of the sides\r\n  at the operculated end and are about 30 × 16 microns. These flukes\r\n  are found within the thickened bile ducts and may be present in\r\n  great numbers. They may invade the pancreas as well as the liver.\r\n\r\n  These flukes are found in dogs and cats as well as man.\r\n\r\nThis fluke is supposed to produce most serious symptoms as\r\nindigestion, swelling and tenderness of liver, bloody diarrhoea,\r\nascites, oedema and a fatal cachexia.\r\n\r\n  The course of the disease is insidious and chronic with periodic\r\n  improvement.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, many physicians in China attribute very little\r\npathogenic importance to it. The disease is diagnosed by the presence\r\nof the ova in the stools. The source of infection is probably through\r\nthe eating of uncooked fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.—_Clonorchis sinensis._ (Jefferys and\r\nMaxwell.)]\r\n\r\n  Kobayashi has examined various molluscs and fish for trematode\r\n  larvae. He succeeded in infecting nine kittens and two cats by\r\n  feeding them with certain fresh water fishes whose flesh contained\r\n  trematode larvae. These fishes were found in districts where human\r\n  distomiasis was common.\r\n\r\n  Further experiments by Kobayashi have shown that the larval flukes\r\n  leave the cyst and start for the biliary passages. When the flukes\r\n  are very numerous the size is smaller. Maturity is reached in four\r\n  weeks. This investigator believes that the primary intermediate\r\n  host is a mollusc as cercariae found in these hosts are very\r\n  similar to the larval forms found in fish.\r\n\r\n  He does not consider that there are two species concerned in\r\n  _Clonorchis_ infections, as he has found variations in continuity\r\n  of vitellaria in small as well as large flukes. Number of parasites\r\n  present influences size. Age influences pigment production.\r\n\r\nAnother human fluke, _Opisthorchis felineus_, inhabits the gall\r\nbladder and bile ducts of man and it is stated that the infection is\r\nquite common in Siberia.\r\n\r\nIt is also a parasite of cats and dogs.\r\n\r\n  Both _Clonorchis_ and _Opisthorchis_ have the testicles in\r\n  the posterior end with the uterus anterior. The testicles of\r\n  _Clonorchis_ are branched (dendritic) while those of _Opisthorchis_\r\n  show as two lobes. In _Dicrocoelium_ the lobed testicles are\r\n  anterior to the uterus, which fills up the posterior end of the\r\n  fluke.\r\n\r\nThe mode of infection as well as the life history is not known but is\r\nprobably connected with the eating of raw fish.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are similar to those caused by _C. endemicus_.\r\n\r\nThe fluke has two-lobed testicles as against the dendritic one of _C.\r\nendemicus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL DISTOMIASIS\r\n\r\nThe most important intestinal fluke is undoubtedly _Fasciolopsis\r\nbuski_. It is now thought that this infection is more common than\r\nwas previously stated. Goddard states that more than 5% of stools\r\nexamined in Shaohing, China, show eggs of this parasite. It is a\r\nvery large fluke with an acetabulum 4 times the diameter of the oral\r\nsucker. It is characterized by a very long and prominent cirrus.\r\n\r\n  _F. buski_ and _Fasciola hepatica_ are much alike in size and\r\n  outline. The acetabulum of the latter is only 1.6 times the\r\n  diameter of the oral sucker and the alimentary tract shows\r\n  branching which is best seen in the cone-shaped projection of its\r\n  anterior extremity. _F. hepatica_ is a liver fluke rarely found in\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n  _F. buski_ is found in China, Assam and India. It is a parasite of\r\n  hogs as well as man. The eggs measure from 80 to 120 microns, are\r\n  nearly colorless and have a thin shell with a very small operculum.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are chiefly those of a chronic diarrhoea followed by\r\nanaemia and wasting. The stool is light yellow in color, exceedingly\r\noffensive and does not contain blood. Goddard thinks that they live\r\nin the upper part of the small intestines.\r\n\r\nThe life history is unknown but Goddard states that fresh water\r\nsnails are much eaten by the people of Shaohing. Nakagawa notes that\r\nthe eggs of _Fasciolopsis_ hatch in two to three weeks. The miracidia\r\npenetrate various species of snails in which the cercariae may encyst\r\nand infect pigs eating such snails. The cercariae may also leave\r\nthe snail and encyst on blades of grass, to later infect an animal\r\nfeeding on the grass, this latter method of infection resembling that\r\nof _Fasciola hepatica_.\r\n\r\nNoc has reported success with treatment with thymol and Goddard with\r\nbeta-naphthol.\r\n\r\n  Other intestinal flukes such as _Cladorchis watsoni_, _Gastrodiscus\r\n  hominis_, _Heterophyes heterophyes_, and _Fascioletta ilocana_\r\n  are of less importance. _Heterophyes_ is probably a rather\r\n  common parasite but owing to its very small size (2 mm.) has been\r\n  generally overlooked at autopsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRONGYLOIDES STERCORALIS\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed that a chronic form of diarrhoea in Cochin\r\nChina was due to an infection with the parthenogenetic female of\r\n_Strongyloides stercoralis_. It is now known that the parasite is\r\nwidely distributed over the tropical and subtropical world and that\r\nit rarely gives rise to manifest symptoms although some observers\r\nregard it as capable of producing diarrhoea and more or less anaemia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.—Ovum of _Fasciolopsis buski_. Bell and\r\nSutton. (Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.—_Fasciolopsis buski._ Cleared in glycerin.\r\n(From Jefferys and Maxwell.)]\r\n\r\n  It seems to be capable of setting up quite an eosinophilia at the\r\n  time the adult female is penetrating the crypts of Lieberkühn, so\r\n  that it is probably of pathogenic importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.—A, Egg of _Strongyloides intestinalis_\r\n(parasitic mother worm) found in stools of case of chronic diarrhoea;\r\nB, Rhabditiform larva of Strongyloides intestinalis from the stools.\r\n(William Sydney Thayer, in Journal of Experimental Medicine.)]\r\n\r\nThe parasitic or intestinal form (also known as _Anguillula\r\nintestinalis_) is represented only by females. These are about 1/12\r\nof an inch (2 mm.) long and reproduce parthenogenetically. They have\r\na pointed, four-lipped mouth, and a filariform oesophagus which\r\nextends along the anterior fourth of the body. The uterus contains\r\na row of 8 to 10 elliptical eggs which stand out prominently in the\r\nposterior part of the body by reason of being almost as wide as the\r\nparent worm.\r\n\r\n  They usually live deep in the mucosa and the embryos emerge from\r\n  the ova laid in the mucosa. The embryos escape from the eggs\r\n  while still in the intestines, so that in the faeces we only find\r\n  actively motile embryos. The eggs, which are strung out in a\r\n  chain, never appear in the faeces except during purgation. As they\r\n  greatly resemble hookworm eggs this is a point of great practical\r\n  importance.\r\n\r\nIn fresh faeces we find hookworm eggs and _Strongyloides_ embryos.\r\nThe embryos are rather common in stools in the tropics. These embryos\r\nhave pointed tails and are about 250 × 13 microns. They have a double\r\noesophageal bulb. They are about 250 microns when they first emerge\r\nbut may grow until they approximate 500 microns in the faeces. The\r\nmouth cavity of the embryo of the hookworm is about as deep as the\r\ndiameter of the embryo at the posterior end of the mouth cavity; that\r\nof _Strongyloides_ is only about one-half as deep as the diameter.\r\nIf the temperature is low, below 15°C., these rhabditiform embryos\r\ndevelop into filariform embryos, which form the infecting stage.\r\n\r\n  It has been demonstrated by Fülleborn that infection of man takes\r\n  place through the skin. If the temperature is warm, 25° to 35°C.,\r\n  these embryos develop into the free-living form. In this we have\r\n  males and females, with double oesophageal bulbs, the male about\r\n  1/30 of an inch (¾ mm.) long with an incurved tail and 2 spicules\r\n  and the female about 1/25 inch (1 mm.) long with an attenuated\r\n  tail. These copulate and we have produced rhabditiform larvae,\r\n  which later change to filariform ones. At this time the length is\r\n  about 550 microns. These start up the parasitical generation.\r\n\r\n  For treatment thymol is usually recommended. Stiles speaks highly\r\n  of sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTABLE OF IMPORTANT ANIMAL PARASITE DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTOZOAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n  -----------------+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------------\r\n      Parasite     | Defin. |  Inter-  | Important |  Transmission and\r\n                   |  host  |  mediate | reservoir |    pathogenicity\r\n                   |        |   host   | of virus  |\r\n  -----------------+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------------\r\n  Entamoeba        |Man.    |Not       |Man-carrier|Cysts in food or water.\r\n   histolytica.    |        | required.| stage     | Flies may act as\r\n                   |        |          | (feces).  | carriers.

Bontius, later on, noted the existence of the disease in the\r\nEast Indies as well as in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n  It is known that yaws often occurred in epidemic form on board the\r\n  slave ships and it is thought that this disease may have been an\r\n  African importation into the new world.\r\n\r\n=Geographical Distribution.=—Yaws is essentially a disease of\r\ntropical regions.\r\n\r\n  In Africa it is very prevalent in the equatorial region, especially\r\n  in the Congo Free State. It is also found more rarely in Tripoli\r\n  and Algiers and to a less extent in the Sudan region. It is common\r\n  in the West Indies and tropical America.\r\n\r\n  In Asia it is very prevalent in the Malay Peninsula, Siam, the East\r\n  Indian Islands and in the Philippines. It does not exist in Japan.\r\n  In many of the islands of the Pacific it is exceedingly prevalent,\r\n  particularly in Samoa. It is also present in Northern Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—In view of the fact that many great authorities,\r\nespecially J. Hutchinson, insisted upon the syphilitic nature of\r\nyaws it was a matter of great interest when Castellani, in 1905,\r\ndiscovered the causative organism which is characterized by the same\r\nsharp-cut, corkscrew spirals that are noted with the syphilitic\r\nspirochaete discovered by Schaudinn in the same year. _Treponema\r\npertenue_ is found in the epidermis of the yaws granuloma and has\r\nbeen demonstrated in lymphatic glands and spleen. Although it has not\r\nbeen demonstrated in the blood, through microscopical examination, it\r\nmust exist there as monkeys infected with the blood of yaws patients\r\ndevelop the lesions of yaws in which the spirochaetes are present.\r\nAnother name for the organism is _Spirochaeta pallidula_; this\r\nhowever is only a synonym.\r\n\r\n  Inoculation experiments as well as clinical manifestations show\r\n  yaws and syphilis to be distinct. Thus Charlouis, in 1881,\r\n  inoculated a native suffering from typical yaws wistations\r\n  of syphilis followed. There have been many instances of the\r\n  development of yaws, naturally and by inoculation, in those\r\n  affected with syphilis. Nichols has shown that a rabbit which had\r\n  been infected intratesticularly with _T. pallidum_ and then cured\r\n  by salvarsan did not show immunity to _T. pertenue_ when the latter\r\n  was used to infect the testicle.\r\n\r\n  In the monkey inoculation over the eyebrow gives a flat dry and\r\n  scaly lesion with syphilitic material while yaws inoculation gives\r\n  a softer, more oedematous one.\r\n\r\n  Levaditi and Nattan Larrier have noted that monkeys which had been\r\n  inoculated with syphilis were immune to yaws inoculation but yaws\r\n  monkeys could be infected with syphilis, thus indicating that yaws\r\n  was a mild form of syphilis. In Guam, it has recently been shown\r\n  that 68% of cases of gangosa, a disease supposed to be a tertiary\r\n  form of yaws, give a positive luetin reaction. This would indicate\r\n  a close relationship between yaws and syphilis.\r\n\r\nSalvarsan is more specific for yaws than it is for syphilis and the\r\npercentage of positive Wassermann tests is as great in yaws as in\r\nsyphilis.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the above points, which would indicate a close\r\n  relationship, all authorities are now agreed that clinical and\r\n  pathological evidence show the two diseases to be separate entities.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—Charlouis inoculated 32 Chinese prisoners with\r\nscrapings from yaws lesions. The disease developed in 28 of them,\r\nfirst showing itself at the site of inoculation.\r\n\r\n  Paulet inoculated 14 negroes with yaws material and after a period\r\n  of incubation of from twelve to twenty days a primary lesion\r\n  appeared, to be followed by the generalized eruption. In naturally\r\n  acquired yaws the period of incubation is from three to six\r\n  weeks. These experiments are in line with the known fact that any\r\n  skin abrasion which comes in contact with a yaws lesion becomes\r\n  infected, as when the mother nurses an infant with lesions on its\r\n  face and develops a yaws lesion at the site of some fissure about\r\n  the nipple.\r\n\r\nYaws shows a striking limitation to the tropics and in a disease so\r\ncommunicable by direct contact it seems remarkable that it does not\r\nspread from the occasional case introduced into temperate regions.\r\nIn the tropical world it seems limited to low level areas. Another\r\nfeature of yaws epidemiology is the vastly greater susceptibility\r\nof colored races, even those of mixed white blood showing a certain\r\ndegree of immunity.\r\n\r\nAll evidence is against a congenital form of yaws.\r\n\r\nIn particular are flies important factors in the transmission of the\r\ndisease, transferring the secretions from yaws lesions to abrasions\r\nor ulcers on the skin of healthy persons.\r\n\r\n  The greater the attention to personal hygiene the less probable is\r\n  the spread of yaws, so that Europeans are rarely infected while the\r\n  disease may be prevalent in the native population.\r\n\r\n  In countries where it is prevalent it is chiefly a disease of\r\n  children, the adults possessing immunity as the result of attacks\r\n  in childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe primary yaws lesion is histologically the same as the lesions of\r\nthe generalized eruption of the second stage. In these lesions we\r\nfail to find the endothelial proliferations and perivascular round\r\ncell infiltrations so characteristic of syphilis. There is great\r\nthickening of the interpapillary pegs of the epidermis which dip down\r\ndeeply into the corium. Areas are noted in the epithelium containing\r\nswollen degenerated epithelial cells, polymorphonuclears and granular\r\ndébris. There is marked oedema in the corium with dilatation of the\r\nblood vessels and lymphatics.\r\n\r\nThere is less oedema of the corium in yaws than in a syphilitic\r\ncondyloma thus accounting for the greater dryness of the former. The\r\nmain point in the pathology of a yaws lesion is the predominating\r\ninvolvement of the epidermis and the comparatively slight change in\r\nthe corium.\r\n\r\n  In a Levaditi-stained specimen the spirochaetes are found in the\r\n  epidermal layers instead of in the corium as with syphilis.\r\n\r\n  The visceral organs and central nervous system are not affected\r\n  although Harper has reported cases of tabes and general paresis in\r\n  Fijians following yaws. He excludes syphilis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nIt is usual to consider the clinical course of yaws as exhibiting\r\ntwo stages, the primary one, which comes on from 2 to 5 weeks after\r\nintroduction of the virus and is characterized by a papular initial\r\nlesion, which later shows the fungoid appearance of a typical yaws\r\ntubercle, and the secondary stage in which yaws lesions similar to\r\nthe initial one develop as a generalized eruption.\r\n\r\n  Some authorities recognize a tertiary stage in which gumma-like\r\n  nodules, with subsequent ulceration, appear. There is much evidence\r\n  to indicate that a destructive ulceration of the nasopharyngeal\r\n  region, in natives of Guam, is a tertiary manifestation of yaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.—Yaws. This case shows an abundance of\r\nyaws tubercles on face. Distribution on trunk and extremities less\r\nextensive. (From Ruge and zur Verth.)]\r\n\r\n_The Primary Stage_.—During a period of incubation, averaging three\r\nweeks, vague digestive troubles, nocturnal headache, joint pains\r\nand an irregular fever may be noted which often abate upon the\r\nappearance of the initial papule at the site of inoculation. There\r\nmay be enlargement and tenderness of the lymphatic glands about the\r\ntime of the appearance of the eruption. This initial lesion may be\r\nsingle or there may be several papules grouped together. In some\r\ncases it may be impossible to get any history of a primary lesion or\r\nit may have been overlooked. The primary lesion is almost invariably\r\nextra-genital and it has the same appearance as the lesions of the\r\nsecondary stage, thus differing from syphilis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.—Child with yaws. (From U. S. Naval Medical\r\nBulletin.)]\r\n\r\n  The yaws lesion, whether primary or secondary, starts as a papule\r\n  which in a few days enlarges to the size of a small pea. It is\r\n  conical and surrounded by an inflammatory areola. At this time the\r\n  thickened epidermis begins to crack and a yellowish sero-purulent\r\n  fluid exudes from the underlying fungoid base. They bleed easily\r\n  but are not painful. It is this fungoid yellowish or yellowish-red\r\n  tubercle which has been thought to resemble a raspberry, hence\r\n  the name framboesia. French authors liken it to a fig which has\r\n  been turned inside out. The moist or crusting surface soon shows\r\n  an underlying ulcer, which may dry up leaving a pigmented spot or\r\n  become exuberant and appear as a mass of fungating granulations, 1\r\n  to 2 inches in diameter. Such lesions are given the name “mother\r\n  yaw.”\r\n\r\n_The Secondary Stage_.—In from six weeks to three months after the\r\nappearance of the initial lesion, which may have dried up and left\r\nonly a scar, or which more commonly is still present, there again set\r\nin malaise, headache and joint pains with an irregular inconstant\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n  The secondary eruption is made up of lesions having the same\r\n  character and course as the primary yaws tubercle. In the general\r\n  eruption, the papules appear frequently in the region of the\r\n  junction of skin and mucous membrane as about mouth, nose and anus.\r\n  In such regions they may become very moist and resemble the mucous\r\n  patches of syphilis.\r\n\r\n  Besides their location on face and about the perineal region they\r\n  are numerous on neck, arms, legs, and buttocks. They are rare on\r\n  the trunk and scalp.\r\n\r\n  In their ordinary locations the yaws tubercles are not painful\r\n  unless pressed firmly but when located on the palms of the hands or\r\n  soles of the feet the thick skin of these regions exerts pressure\r\n  so that in such situations the lesions are painful.\r\n\r\nIn this stage yaws does not involve mucous membranes or affect the\r\nviscera.\r\n\r\n  The secondary stage lasts from 3 or 4 months to 2 or 3 years, the\r\n  yaws tubercles coming out in successive crops in long standing\r\n  cases.\r\n\r\n_The Tertiary Stage_.—Daniels noted in the Fiji Islands destructive\r\nlesions of the naso-pharyngeal region which he thought might be\r\nassociated with a preceding yaws attack. He noted cutaneous lesions\r\nwhich resembled lupus vulgaris. Boissiere has noted not only the\r\nnasopharyngeal lesions and lupus-vulgaris-like ones but also tibial\r\ninvolvement, joint swellings and dactylitis.\r\n\r\n  Numa Rat describes various tertiary manifestations. There may\r\n  be subcutaneous nodules about ankle or leg which soften and may\r\n  produce bone lesions and deformities. He notes destructive lesions\r\n  of nares, pharynx and palate which may set in years after an\r\n  attack of yaws. His description of the process starting as an\r\n  ozoena or sore throat followed by destruction of the uvula, velum\r\n  palati and septum nasi is much like gangosa. Howard has noted the\r\n  greater frequency of destructive lesions of the nasopharynx in\r\n  those parts of Africa where yaws is prevalent than in parts where\r\n  syphilis prevails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.—Tertiary jaws, “Gomma”. (Johns Hopkins\r\nBull., Moss and Bigelow.)]\r\n\r\n  According to Castellani the characteristic lesions of tertiary yaws\r\n  are gummatous nodules and deep ulcerations. Such ulcerations may\r\n  give rise to contractures.\r\n\r\n  In Guam the view now prevails that the condition known as gangosa\r\n  is a form of tertiary yaws.\r\n\r\n  Other than a moderate anaemia there is very little in the blood of\r\n  yaws which differs from the normal.\r\n\r\n  _Peculiar Types of Yaws_.—When yaws tubercles develop in the\r\n  palms of the hands or soles of the feet we have a very painful\r\n  and incapacitating condition resulting. The pressure of the thick\r\n  unyielding epidermis on the tubercles beneath gives rise to marked\r\n  pain, thus differing from tubercles on other parts of the body.\r\n  Eventually these tubercles break through and the affected sole may\r\n  have a worm-eaten appearance. The name “crab yaws” is a common\r\n  one for such a condition involving the soles of the feet and is\r\n  so-called from the difficulty in walking which has a resemblance\r\n  to the locomotion of a crab. In some cases the yaws tubercles\r\n  adjoin one another to form a circle enclosing unaffected skin. Such\r\n  an arrangement of lesions is often described under the name of\r\n  “ringworm yaws.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.—Tertiary yaws. Clavus or Crab-yaws. (Johns\r\nHopkins Bull., Moss and Bigelow.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n=Clinical Diagnosis.=—Bromide eruptions may greatly resemble yaws\r\nbut the history of the taking of the drug and the effect upon\r\nwithdrawal should differentiate.\r\n\r\n_Syphilis and Yaws._—Degorce gives a very complete table of the\r\npoints of difference between syphilis and yaws, some of the more\r\nimportant of which are the following:\r\n\r\n  YAWS\r\n\r\n  1. Primary lesion of soft consistency, or very little infiltrated,\r\n  with granulating or pimply surface, situated almost invariably\r\n  extragenitally, resembling the secondary lesions. Lymphadenitis not\r\n  marked.\r\n\r\n  2. Roseola resembling that of syphilis but rarer.\r\n\r\n  3. Secondary cutaneous lesions at first in the form of conical\r\n  elevations of a light red color, not infiltrated at base, appearing\r\n  in close groups. The lesions are similar to those of syphilis,\r\n  namely, on the scalp in the form of encrusted papules; on\r\n  thin-skinned regions in the form of ulcerating papules, and in the\r\n  case of the palm of the hands and plantar surface of the feet, in\r\n  the form of simple papules.\r\n\r\n  4. Circinate lesions with the edges more raised than in syphilis,\r\n  covered with yellow crusts.\r\n\r\n  5. On the face lesions of the same type, but more striking and with\r\n  irregular projections.\r\n\r\n  6. Cutaneous lesions do not itch.\r\n\r\n  7. Perionychia similar to that of syphilis, but occasionally giving\r\n  rise to pimply lesions.\r\n\r\n  8. Alopecia has not been described.\r\n\r\n  9. Lesions in the buccal and pharyngeal mucosa often absent. No\r\n  erythema. No typical mucous patches. Sometimes fissures at the\r\n  angles of the mouth. The typical lesions are raised, pure white and\r\n  occasionally covered with intact epithelium.\r\n\r\n  10. Lesions with prominent edges or even pustular with yellowish\r\n  crusts, occasionally also ulcerations resembling mucous patches.\r\n\r\n  11. Similar condylomata, but larger and more raised.\r\n\r\n  SYPHILIS\r\n\r\n  1. Primary lesion infiltrated and indurated, with flat and\r\n  smooth surface, ordinarily situated on the genital organs; often\r\n  accompanied by abundant lymphadenitis. Phagedenic processes\r\n  frequent.\r\n\r\n  2. Roseola present.\r\n\r\n  3. Secondary cutaneous lesions papular from the first, dark red,\r\n  infiltrated and fairly regularly scattered.\r\n\r\n  4. Circinate lesions with pink edges, slightly raised, with fine\r\n  scales.\r\n\r\n  5. Seborrheic syphilides on the face.\r\n\r\n  6. Cutaneous lesions do not itch.\r\n\r\n  7. Perionychia present.\r\n\r\n  8. In syphilis, alopecia rather the exception.\r\n\r\n  9. Lesions in the buccal and pharyngeal mucosa are not numerous\r\n  and are slight in degree. Erythema of the soft palate and pharynx\r\n  occurs. Mucous patches. Ulcers of the lips and at the angles of the\r\n  mouth.\r\n\r\n  10. In the glans, prepuce or vulva, the lesions are more or less\r\n  typical mucous patches.\r\n\r\n  11. Moist condylomata at the margin of the anus.\r\n\r\n  The authorities generally discuss extensively the points of\r\n  distinction between yaws and syphilis. This is probably more\r\n  connected with possible relationship than practical importance in\r\n  diagnosis.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Diagnosis.=—The staining of the juice from yaws\r\ntubercles by the India ink method or with Giemsa’s stain is the usual\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n  Baermann gives the percentage of positive Wassermann reactions in\r\n  untreated, clinically positive cases, as 80 to 100%; in treated\r\n  cases, 50%, and in the latent ones as from 35 to 40%. In an\r\n  examination of the serum of 281 cases of gangosa, Halton obtained\r\n  37.3% positive Wassermann reactions. Kerr found that 73.8% of 2,429\r\n  natives of Guam had had yaws, usually in childhood.\r\n\r\n  Among other diseases which may be confused with yaws, particularly\r\n  as regards the nasopharyngeal ulcerations of tertiary yaws, may be\r\n  mentioned American cutaneous leishmaniasis. The differentiation\r\n  rests in finding _Leishmania tropica_ in such lesions.\r\n\r\n  Sections from a yaws tubercle treated and sectioned according\r\n  to Levaditi’s method show the treponemata in the region of the\r\n  thickened interpapillary pegs of the epidermis.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThis is almost entirely favorable as regards danger to life. The\r\ndeath rate is approximately ½ of 1% and such fatalities generally\r\noccur in young children in whom secondary infections develop on the\r\nsite of the ulcerating yaws lesions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—Daniels thinks the frequency of infection about the\r\nangles of the mouth, which frequently show fissures, is explained by\r\nthe exchange of particles of food or other substances by children,\r\nthus transferring the infection.\r\n\r\n  Of course care should be taken to prevent articles of clothing\r\n  contaminated with yaws discharges from acting as infecting agents.\r\n\r\n  The main point in prophylaxis is to prevent flies from having\r\n  access to abrasions on the skin, so that all cuts or sores should\r\n  be protected by dressings. The sound skin is a barrier to infection.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—It can certainly be stated that in salvarsan we have an\r\nabsolute specific for yaws, the results which obtain in a few days\r\nbeing almost miraculous when one considers the protracted normal\r\ncourse of the disease.\r\n\r\n  The drug is given intravenously although neosalvarsan\r\n  intramuscularly is more convenient for those not prepared to give\r\n  intravenous injections.\r\n\r\n  The methods of administration are exactly as for the treatment of\r\n  syphilis. The drug gives best results when used early in the course\r\n  of the disease.\r\n\r\n  Doses of 0.4 gram of salvarsan usually suffice and frequently\r\n  one dose effects a cure. The dose for women, children and thin\r\n  individuals should be less than for strong adult men. Atoxyl does\r\n  not seem to be effective in yaws. In other words the methods of\r\n  treatment are the same for the two treponemata, except that the\r\n  effect of salvarsan may be termed specific for yaws and less so\r\n  for syphilis. Bergen found that about 4% of cases treated with\r\n  salvarsan or neosalvarsan relapsed. The average time to effect a\r\n  cure was eleven days.\r\n\r\n  Many of the older writers have reported the value of mercury in the\r\n  treatment of yaws but the present view is that this drug has very\r\n  little if any place in the therapy of the disease. Potassium iodide\r\n  does seem to be a very useful drug in the absence of opportunity\r\n  for obtaining some arsphenamine product. Where the specific remedy\r\n  cannot be secured the next best treatment is Castellani’s yaws\r\n  mixture. The formula for the preparation is the following:\r\n\r\n  Tartar emetic                   one grain       (0.06 gm.)\r\n  Potassium iodide                twenty grains   (1.3 gms.)\r\n  Sodium salicylate               ten grains      (0.6 gm.)\r\n  Sodium bicarbonate              fifteen grains  (1 gm.)\r\n  Chloroform water and syrup      one ounce       (30 cc.)\r\n\r\n  The above is a single dose and it is given well diluted about three\r\n  times daily. This treatment is continued for about a week and after\r\n  an interval of another week is resumed according to the response\r\n  to such treatment. In children between seven and fifteen years the\r\n  dose is reduced one-half and for younger children correspondingly.\r\n  It would seem well to start treatment with a smaller dosage than\r\n  the standard one, being guided by the ability of the patient to\r\n  stand an increase in the dose of the drugs.\r\n\r\n  For local treatment use antiseptic dusting powders as iodoform or\r\n  boric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nGANGOSA\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—It is known that in 1828 a Spanish Commission,\r\ninvestigating the diseases of the Ladrone Islands, reported the\r\nexistence, in those islands, of a disease which was called gangosa,\r\nby reason of the muffled character of the voice, the Spanish word\r\n_gangosa_ meaning muffled voice. The Commission recommended that\r\ncases of this disease, as well as those with leprosy, be isolated,\r\nthus showing that the disease was differentiated from leprosy at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n  Daniels, who studied similar naso-pharyngeal lesions in Fiji,\r\n  considered the disease as a sequel of yaws and stated that if it\r\n  were not a stage of yaws it was probably a separate and distinct\r\n  disease. Leys, who studied gangosa in Guam, in 1904, gave it the\r\n  name rhino-pharyngitis mutilans and described it as a disease _sui\r\n  generis_.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The disease is very prevalent in\r\n  Guam, and is also present in other islands of the Caroline group.\r\n  It exists in Fiji and many cases have been reported by Numa Rat\r\n  from the island of Dominica, in the West Indies. Cases have also\r\n  been reported from the Philippines and Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The two most prominent views as to its etiology are that\r\nit is a sequel of either yaws or syphilis. The fact that gangosa\r\nresponds to antisyphilitic treatment is no proof as to its luetic\r\norigin because yaws yields equally well to such remedies.\r\n\r\n  Gangosa cases also give a considerable percentage of positive\r\n  Wassermann reactions, 105 positives in 281 cases. Halton who made\r\n  these tests found 100% positive reactions in cases of yaws and 46%\r\n  of positives in those who had had yaws several years previously.\r\n\r\n  The main points against the syphilitic nature of the disease are\r\n  absence of either congenital or acquired syphilis among the natives\r\n  of Guam. There is an absence of Hutchinson’s teeth and interstitial\r\n  keratitis. Leys states that neither primary nor secondary syphilis\r\n  had been seen in a native of Guam during a year in which a very\r\n  large number, including several prostitutes, had been treated.\r\n  Recently a positive luetin reaction has been obtained in 253 out of\r\n  369 cases of gangosa, of which 143 were papular type reactions,\r\n  65 pustular and 45 torpid reactions (taking ten days or more for\r\n  the reaction to manifest itself). The syphilitic and yaws antigens\r\n  seem to be reciprocal so that these tests do not throw out yaws.\r\n  The great stumbling block of the advocates of the luetic etiology\r\n  has been to show the presence of syphilis among the people of Guam.\r\n  Under tropical ulcer it will be noted that Jeanselme failed to find\r\n  the eye or teeth signs of congenital syphilis among natives of\r\n  Indo-China with the disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.—Cases of Gangosa from Guam. (U. S. Naval\r\nMedical Bulletin.)]\r\n\r\nKerr, who has been an advocate of the yaws etiology, has shown that\r\nof 315 cases of gangosa, 205 could show yaws scars and knew where the\r\nmother yaw had been and of the entire 315 only 18 claimed never to\r\nhave had yaws and failed to show scars.\r\n\r\n  Rossiter, who observed active ulcerations of the nasal septum and\r\n  hard palate in the case of a two-year old Samoan child, following\r\n  yaws, states that he found yaws treponemata in smears from the\r\n  ulcerated areas.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—If gangosa is a sequel of yaws then the same factors\r\nwhich are operative for yaws apply to gangosa.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nSections made from the ulcerating margins of the nasopharyngeal\r\nlesions have failed to show treponemata when stained by Levaditi’s\r\nmethod. In sections of such tissue stained by Giemsa’s method I noted\r\na rather marked infiltration with lymphocytes and a great number of\r\nmast cells. Fordyce has noted the presence of giant cells.\r\n\r\n  From the histological study one can only state that the lesions\r\n  present the characteristics of the granulomata.\r\n\r\n  A remarkable feature of the disease is the rapidity with which\r\n  ulceration destroys cartilage and bone. The nasal duct seems to be\r\n  prone to attack and it is through this channel that the process\r\n  reaches the eye to bring about its destructive tendency in that\r\n  organ.\r\n\r\n  Of 81 cases studied by McLean and Mink the eye was involved in 21.\r\n  The larynx was involved in 33 of these cases. It is the frequent\r\n  perforation of the hard palate that gives these patients the nasal\r\n  voice, whence the name of the disease is derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nPatients with the disease have rarely been observed prior to the full\r\ndevelopment of the mutilating ulcerations. In a few cases, however,\r\nit was noted that a patch of membrane first appeared in the region\r\nof the soft palate. This membrane rapidly became honeycombed and an\r\nexamination three or four days later showed underneath a deep ulcer,\r\nsurrounded by an area of marked congestion.\r\n\r\n  The ulcerating process advances rapidly, destroying bone as well as\r\n  soft parts. The process seems to extend from within outward, giving\r\n  a funnel-shaped loss of tissue. The ulceration advances upward and\r\n  forward, destroying the nasal septum and structures forming the\r\n  tip of the nose, leaving the upper lip as the lower border of this\r\n  external opening.\r\n\r\nThe active process tends to become quiescent in one or two years,\r\nthe cases then showing extensive loss of tissue with cicatricial\r\nborders. Occasionally active ulceration may again set in after a\r\nperiod of quiescence.\r\n\r\n  The voice character is that of any case where there is a\r\n  perforation of the hard palate and is not distinctive of the\r\n  victims of this disease.\r\n\r\n  During active ulceration there is a malodorous sero-purulent\r\n  discharge which makes the patients very objectionable. These cases\r\n  seem to suffer very little impairment of the general health even\r\n  when the process is active.\r\n\r\nAlthough the destructive lesions about the nasopharynx and the region\r\nof the face are the most striking ones it would appear that similar\r\nulcers on the extremities are of the same nature as those more\r\nprominently situated.\r\n\r\n  In an examination of the blood of 10 of these cases in Guam I did\r\n  not observe any abnormal findings, other than an eosinophilia,\r\n  which was present to an equal degree in those unaffected. Musgrave\r\n  and Marshall reported a slight leucocytosis in their case.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nGangosa is chiefly to be differentiated from leprosy, syphilis and\r\nlupus vulgaris. Its more rapid course should distinguish it from\r\nleprosy and lupus and the history from syphilis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nOdell found that a thorough antisyphilitic treatment cured these\r\nulcerations. He used mercurial injections. Recently salvarsan has\r\nbeen used with striking curative results. It has been thought that\r\nlocal application of tincture of iodine was effective in stopping the\r\nprogress of the early ulcerations but this would seem doubtful, it\r\nbeing advisable immediately to give salvarsan.\r\n\r\n  On account of the offensive odor of the discharge solutions of\r\n  permanganate of potash have generally been used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nMYCETOMA\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS\r\n\r\nVarious destructive processes of different parts of the body, but\r\nmore commonly of the foot, which are caused by invasion and growth\r\nof fungi are generally designated mycetomas. Chalmers and Archibald\r\nhave studied these conditions most carefully and have grouped most\r\nof them under maduro-mycoses and actinomycoses. The mycetomas are\r\ncharacterized by the presence of fungi in the form of grains composed\r\nof hyphae, and at times chlamydospores, imbedded in a matrix. These\r\ngrains may be imbedded in the tissues or present in the discharge\r\nfrom the sinuses. Eosinophile bodies are usually present. The\r\nmaduro-mycoses have grains with large segmented mycelial filaments,\r\npossessing well defined walls and usually chlamydospores. We have\r\nwhite or yellow, black and red ones according to the colour of the\r\ngrains. The actinomycoses have very fine nonsegmented mycelial\r\nfilaments with ill-defined walls and no chlamydospores. We have\r\nblack, yellow and red grain actinomycoses. In addition to the\r\nmycetomas we recognize paramycetomas and pseudomycetomas, the former\r\nof which show fungi which do not show any grain formation and the\r\nlatter failing to have present either fungi or eosinophile bodies.\r\nThe pseudomycetomas are associated only by reason of clinical\r\nresemblance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—The disease was first described by Kaempfer about 200\r\nyears ago, but at that time was often confused with elephantiasis.\r\nThe first exact clinical description of the disease, with its\r\npathology, in which was noted the fungus nature of the granules given\r\noff in the discharges from the sinuses, was that of Vandyke Carter,\r\nwhose studies were carried on from forty to fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The name Madura foot takes its origin\r\n  from the great prevalence of the affection about Madura, in the\r\n  Madras Presidency of India. It is less frequent in other parts of\r\n  India. It also occurs in Ceylon. The disease is rather widespread\r\n  in Africa, having been reported from Algiers, Tripoli, Tunis, Egypt\r\n  and the Sudan as well as from Madagascar. Cases have also been\r\n  reported from Italy and Greece in Europe and from the West Indies\r\n  and some of the South American countries. Several cases have been\r\n  reported from North America and Sutton, in 1913, reported two cases\r\n  from Kansas, one in a Mexican and one in a native of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—The disease is caused by the penetration of certain\r\nspecies of fungi into the tissues of the foot, although rarely the\r\nhand or some other part of the body may be affected. These species\r\nof fungus develop in granulomatous areas from which sinuses lead to\r\nthe surface of the foot, in the discharges from which are found small\r\ngranules resembling those found in the discharges from actinomycosis\r\nlesions.\r\n\r\n  As a rule only one kind of fungus is found in a single case.\r\n  The most common infection is that due to _Discomyces madurae_\r\n  (_Nocardia madurae_) which is the fungus of the fish-roe-like\r\n  granules of the pale or white variety of mycetoma. These, like the\r\n  fungus of actinomycosis, _Discomyces bovis_, show a felted mycelium\r\n  in the center and peripheral club-like structures. These granules\r\n  are yellowish-white and vary in size from a pin’s head to a small\r\n  pea. The mycelial threads are very narrow, 1 to 1½ microns. It\r\n  grows aerobically and the cultures show slender mycelial threads\r\n  which are Gram-positive. This is the organism of Carter’s white\r\n  mycetoma.\r\n\r\n  Other species of the pale, white or ochroid group of mycetoma\r\n  fungi are _Indiella mansoni_ (Brumpt’s white mycetoma),\r\n  _Nocardia asteroides_ (Musgrave and Clegg’s white mycetoma),\r\n  _Sterigmatocystis nidulans_ (Nicolle’s white mycetoma) and several\r\n  others.\r\n\r\nThe cases caused by the black varieties are more rare and are\r\ncharacterized by the presence in the discharges from the sinuses of\r\nblack gunpowder-like grains.\r\n\r\n  These hard, brittle, irregular grains are caused by various species\r\n  of fungi of which the best known is Carter’s black mycetoma\r\n  (_Madurella mycetomi_). This species was cultured by Wright and\r\n  first shows a grayish growth, later becoming black. Other black\r\n  varieties of mycetoma are due to various other fungi. Bouffard’s\r\n  black variety is caused by _Aspergillus bouffardi_. DeBeurmann’s\r\n  black mycetoma has as cause _Sporotrichum beurmanni_.\r\n\r\n  Besides the white and black varieties we also have a red variety of\r\n  mycetoma. The fungus grains are quite small and reddish in color.\r\n  It is not an uncommon infection in certain parts of Africa, as\r\n  Senegal. The cause is _Nocardia pelletieri_.\r\n\r\n  Boyd and Crutchfield have noted an ascomycete in an American case,\r\n  with white granules, to which has been given the name _Alleschiria\r\n  boydii_.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—We know very little about the occurrence of these\r\nmycetoma fungi, other than in man. It is thought that such fungi lead\r\na saprophytic existence on thorns or blades of grass or spine-like\r\ngrains of various cereals. Thus Nicolle’s case in Tunis started from\r\na puncture wound by a grain of barley.\r\n\r\n  As the vast majority of such cases are noted in the feet, and as\r\n  such cases are chiefly in those who work barefooted, it seems\r\n  reasonable to consider that the fungi are introduced on some\r\n  puncturing object and the external wound having healed development\r\n  goes on in the deeper structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn more than 75% of cases of mycetoma the foot is the only part\r\ninfected. More rarely there is involvement of hands, knees and\r\nbuttocks.\r\n\r\n  The affected part shows nodules on the external surface which\r\n  connect with the granulomatous lesions of the interior of the foot\r\n  by sinuses. In advanced cases there may be a network of sinuses\r\n  and cyst-like dilatations which are filled with a viscid fluid\r\n  packed with the small fish-roe granules in the white variety or the\r\n  gunpowder grains of the black mycetoma. The bony structures of the\r\n  foot may undergo disintegration as well as muscular and areolar\r\n  tissue so that on cutting into such a foot there is nothing normal\r\n  remaining—simply a cheesy mass.\r\n\r\n  In the early granulomatous areas are found the actinomyces-like\r\n  granules surrounded by an area of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear\r\n  infiltration. Giant cells are occasionally found. There is an\r\n  inflammatory oedema. Externally we have connective tissue cells and\r\n  a fibrous wall. The blood vessels show endothelial proliferation\r\n  and thrombosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe disease usually begins in the sole of the foot with the formation\r\nof firm swellings about ½ inch in diameter. The cases are rarely seen\r\nat this stage, the natives waiting before seeking medical advice\r\nuntil the nodule has softened and begun to discharge the viscid fluid\r\nwith the various-colored granules floating in it. As stated before,\r\nthe soft, yellowish-white, fish-roe-like granules are most commonly\r\nobserved, the more friable, hard, gunpowder-like grains less so. The\r\nnodules continue to form and to break down until the foot has become\r\ngreatly enlarged, the under surface bulging out in a convex mass with\r\nthe toes and heels appearing as if raised up. The dorsal surface is\r\nalso puffed up and studded with broken down nodules, and the sides\r\nwell rounded. There is no increase in the length of the foot. This\r\nswollen distorted foot is borne on a thin peg-like leg which makes\r\nthe size of the foot more striking. Very rarely cases have been\r\nreported where the hand or thigh have been involved.\r\n\r\n  If one probes the discharging sinuses bone may or may not be felt\r\n  according to the advancement of the degenerative changes. There is\r\n  rarely pain or bleeding following the probing.\r\n\r\nIt is more from the onerous burden of carrying around this fungoid\r\nmass of a foot, 3 or 4 times the normal size, than pain, that the\r\npatient complains of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.—Mycetoma. (From Greene.)]\r\n\r\n  Uncomplicated cases do not show fever and the occasional\r\n  enlargement of lymphatic glands is probably connected with\r\n  bacterial infections.\r\n\r\n  There are never visceral metastases in mycetoma as is true of the\r\n  nearly related actinomycosis.\r\n\r\n  The process shows no tendency to heal naturally or under treatment\r\n  but fortunately does not extend, the process being confined to\r\n  a foot or a hand. The joints are rarely if ever invaded. Unless\r\n  the sinus-riddled member is amputated the drain on the patient\r\n  gradually exhausts him and death ensues in ten or fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe distorted appearance of the foot or hand, riddled with sinuses\r\ndischarging a viscid fluid containing the variously colored granules,\r\nwhich upon microscopical examination are found to be sclerotia of\r\nfungi, is absolutely diagnostic. As regards recognition of the\r\ncausative fungus one should culture the discharge or grains on\r\nmaltose agar, potato or rather dry blood serum. The recognition of\r\nspecies of fungi is a very difficult matter, even for an expert.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely unfavorable as regards the relief of the condition\r\nbut as regards life it is not unfavorable provided the drain on the\r\nsystem is gotten rid of by amputation of the part.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—The wearing of shoes in the fields or forests would\r\nseem to be the best means of protection against small wounds from\r\nthorns, splinters and the like.\r\n\r\n  Then, too, any such wound which might occur should be treated with\r\n  tincture of iodine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.—Important tropical fungi.]\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—It is usual to try the effects of curetting the lesions\r\nand if taken early enough this may have effect. As a rule the process\r\ngoes on but is limited to the member attacked so that amputation of\r\nthe diseased part brings about a cure. Iodide of potash is of no\r\nvalue. X-ray treatment seems to be of value in relieving the pain and\r\nin lessening the discharge from the sinuses but is of questionable\r\ncurative effect. It might be of greater value if tried early in the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nGRANULOMA VENEREUM\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n=History.=—It is generally stated that Daniels first noted the\r\ndisease in British Guiana, in 1896, but Daniels regards the disease\r\npreviously described by Macleod from India under the designation\r\n“serpiginous ulceration of the genitals,” as referring to granuloma\r\nvenereum.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—Cases of the disease have been\r\n  chiefly reported from British Guiana and the West Indies. It is now\r\n  recognized, however, that it occurs in India, China and Northern\r\n  Australia as well as in some of the islands of the Pacific. It also\r\n  occurs in Northern and Central Africa.\r\n\r\n  Grindon has reported 3 cases from the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY\r\n\r\nVarious spirochaetes have been reported as present in the lesions.\r\nThe finding by Wise of spirochaetes resembling _Treponema pallidum_\r\nhas not been generally accepted.\r\n\r\n  Donovan has reported the presence, in scrapings from the\r\n  ulcerations, of an oval bacillus (1½ × 2 microns) which was\r\n  contained in large phagocytic cells. There were sometimes several\r\n  such bodies in a single cell.\r\n\r\n  Flu has recently reported the presence in plasma cells as well\r\n  as occasionally in other cells of a capsulated organism which he\r\n  believes related to the Friedlander group. His cultural work has\r\n  not been conclusive. It is probable that this capsulated organism\r\n  is merely a secondary invader.\r\n\r\n  There is also a suggestion of the cellular reaction characteristic\r\n  of the chlamydozoa.\r\n\r\n  The disease is rather more common in women than in men and is\r\n  rarely seen before the period of puberty. It is thought that it is\r\n  transmitted by sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\n  The pathological process manifests itself as a small round cell\r\n  infiltration of the superficial portion of the corium. The growth\r\n  is well supplied with blood vessels. Giant cell formation and\r\n  caseation have not been noted. There is an abundance of plasma\r\n  cells.\r\n\r\n  There is a marked tendency to the formation of fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe disease usually first shows itself as a papule or vesicle on the\r\npenis or labia minora. The process extends and the thin epidermal\r\nlayer rubs off leaving a surface of granulations which bleed easily\r\nand give off a creamy discharge which is frequently very offensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.—Venereal granuloma. (After Martini; from\r\nMense.)]\r\n\r\n  The process usually extends from the penis to the groins by\r\n  continuity and thence down the inner surfaces of the thigh. When\r\n  the glans penis is involved there may be a fungating growth\r\n  suggestive of epithelioma. In the female the process extends from\r\n  the labia minora into the vagina and also to the labia majora and\r\n  thence to the perineum and perianal region. Recto-vaginal fistulae\r\n  often result. The process extends more rapidly and markedly when\r\n  invading mucous membranes.\r\n\r\n  While the granulomatous process is advancing there is frequently\r\n  cicatrization of the areas previously invaded forming a scar tissue\r\n  which breaks down easily. There is little pain or itching and the\r\n  general health is not impaired.\r\n\r\n  There is no enlargement of the lymphatic glands. Although the\r\n  process extends by continuity yet it may also pass to parts in\r\n  contact with the diseased area. While healing of affected skin\r\n  tends to occur that of mucous membrane does not.\r\n\r\n  There is really very little tendency to ulceration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIt is usual to suspect a syphilitic process but the absence of gland\r\ninvolvement and secondary manifestations of syphilis negatives this.\r\n\r\n  It may be suggestive of tuberculous or epitheliomatous processes.\r\n  The marked chronicity and tendency to scarring are striking.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nExcision of the entire granulomatous area going well into the normal\r\nskin has been thought by some to be the only cure.\r\n\r\n  Ordinary antisyphilitic treatment does not seem to have any effect\r\n  and the good reports that have been made as to therapeutic success\r\n  with salvarsan may have been due to diagnosing a syphilitic process\r\n  as granuloma venereum. Radiotherapy has been recommended.\r\n\r\n  Local treatment with antiseptic or deodorant washes or ointments is\r\n  necessary in these cases.\r\n\r\n  _Antimony Treatment._—Breinl reports success in treatment by using\r\n  tartar emetic injections. This treatment is now the standard one\r\n  and the drug is given intravenously as described under treatment of\r\n  leishmaniasis. It is also recommended to apply locally compresses\r\n  soaked with a ½% solution of tartar emetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI\r\n\r\nTROPICAL SKIN DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTROPICAL ULCER\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nUnder the names tropical phagedaena or tropical ulcer various skin\r\nlesions have been described, from all parts of the tropics, which\r\nvary greatly in etiology and symptomatology.\r\n\r\nThese skin ulcers are most frequently observed on the dorsum of the\r\nfoot or front of the leg but may appear on the hands or forearms and\r\nhave rarely been reported from other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that many of the cases reported as tropical\r\nulcer are really manifestations of tertiary syphilis.\r\n\r\n  Jeanselme has noted the insignificant manifestations of the\r\n  secondary stage of syphilis in natives of Indo-China and the\r\n  malignancy of the tertiary ones as regards the skin lesions. In\r\n  fact a striking feature of the late stages of syphilis in the\r\n  natives of the tropical world is the frequency and severity of skin\r\n  lesions and the rarity or absence of involvement of the central\r\n  nervous system to produce tabes or general paresis.\r\n\r\n  Again congenital syphilis is common in most tropical countries\r\n  which have been visited by white men for long periods and Jeanselme\r\n  has noted the rarity in natives so affected of interstitial\r\n  keratitis and Hutchinson’s teeth, signs upon which medical men are\r\n  apt to base a diagnosis of such a condition.\r\n\r\n  Again, Butler, studying the serological side of 27 ulcerations\r\n  which clinically could be diagnosed as tropical ulcer, obtained\r\n  strongly positive Wassermann tests in 26, or 96 per cent. of the\r\n  cases. Shattuck found that about 94% of the chronic ulcerations of\r\n  the Philippines could be ascribed to syphilis.\r\n\r\nBesides syphilis one must bear in mind the possibility of the ulcers\r\nbeing a manifestation of tertiary yaws, a condition which also gives\r\na high percentage of positive Wassermann tests.\r\n\r\n  In Guam, the natives separate the ulcerations about the lower\r\n  extremities from the naso-pharyngeal ones by designating the\r\n  former cases llagosos and the latter gangosas. It is probable\r\n  that the leg ulcers are manifestations of the same disease as the\r\n  naso-pharyngeal ones whether it be syphilis or yaws. These ulcers\r\n  of the leg in Guam as well as those studied by Butler in the\r\n  Philippines would certainly be classed as tropical ulcers.\r\n\r\n  There are undoubtedly many cases which can be explained by\r\n  infections with ordinary pyogenic organisms of the skin which are\r\n  enabled to get a foothold in an abrasion or other minor wound, in a\r\n  person whose resistance has been reduced by such cachexia-producing\r\n  diseases as malaria, dysentery or ancylostomiasis.\r\n\r\n  Indeed some authorities attach special importance to the tibial\r\n  ulcers found in advanced cases of hookworm disease. Some of the\r\n  sores are due to irritating applications used by the natives of\r\n  many countries as setons. In many instances the sores are from\r\n  neglected wounds.\r\n\r\nVincent has called attention to the association of the fusiform\r\nbacillus and delicate spirillum, better known in connection with\r\nVincent’s angina, in smears from tropical ulcers.\r\n\r\n  Such findings have also caused many to consider tropical ulcer as\r\n  related to hospital gangrene. There is no doubt but that smears\r\n  from the dirty membranous deposit on these ulcers do frequently\r\n  show the fusiform bacillus and at times the spirillum, but we also\r\n  frequently find various fungi in such smears. Very few hold that\r\n  these have anything to do with the production of the ulcer.\r\n\r\n  Inoculation experiments have as a rule been indefinite in result.\r\n\r\n  LeDantec has incriminated a very large Gram-negative bacillus which\r\n  was noncultivable.\r\n\r\nProwazek believes that he has found the cause in a spirochaete which\r\npossesses fewer turns and these more widely separated than those\r\nof the spirochaete of syphilis. The association with the fusiform\r\nbacillus has also been noted.\r\n\r\n  Wolbach and Todd note the frequent finding of spirochaetes in\r\n  tropical ulcers and attach considerable importance to a spirochaete\r\n  with abruptly tapering ends. The name of Spirochaeta schaudinni has\r\n  been given to the organism. They also generally found associated\r\n  micrococci and bacilli as well as the fusiform bacillus.\r\n\r\n  Other than the noting of granulation tissue and the presence of\r\n  plasma and small round cells there does not seem to be anything\r\n  definite in the histopathology of tropical ulcer. This is what\r\n  one might expect in view of the lack of definite knowledge of the\r\n  condition.\r\n\r\n_Veld sore._—Under the name of Veld sore we have a form of tropical\r\nulcer which is common in various desert regions.\r\n\r\n  These ulcerations may appear on the face as well as on the dorsal\r\n  surfaces of the hands or forearms or on the lower extremities. They\r\n  seem to arise from infections of abrasions of the exposed parts.\r\n  In the early stages of the lesion the diphtheria bacillus has been\r\n  frequently isolated and some of the cases have been followed by\r\n  diphtheritic palsies. It would appear that these lesions have at\r\n  times been those of cutaneous diphtheria. Such cases were reported\r\n  by Craig in cases in the Sinai desert. The simultaneous existence\r\n  of cases of ordinary faucial diphtheria should make one suspicious\r\n  of the real nature of such ulcerations. Skin diphtheria is more\r\n  frequent than is generally considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThese ulcers are most frequently found on the dorsum of the foot,\r\nover the shin and about the external malleolus. More rarely they\r\ninvolve the dorsum of the hand or back of the wrist.\r\n\r\n  In the multiplicity of clinical descriptions from various parts of\r\n  the tropics we obtain two types of ulceration.\r\n\r\nOne is that of a rather chronic ulcer, which slowly develops from\r\na painless swelling, which is not unlike a gummatous process.\r\nSurrounding the swelling there is a circumscribed, reddened, glazed\r\narea of skin. After two or three weeks the swelling begins to soften\r\nand a serous fluid exudes from its summit.\r\n\r\n  Ulceration, with the frequent formation of a membrane-like deposit,\r\n  now sets in and later on we have a more or less punched-out ulcer\r\n  showing indurated margins. There may be no impairment in the health\r\n  of those with this type of ulcer.\r\n\r\nThe other type is generally seen in persons who are much debilitated\r\nor suffering from some cachectic state. In the earliest stages\r\nthese sores seem to resemble an area which has been excoriated\r\nand inoculated with vaccine virus, there being a rather dry,\r\nangry-looking spot of erythema. This within a few hours may be\r\nsurrounded by a circle of vesicles beyond which is an encircling\r\ninflammatory areola.\r\n\r\n  There is marked subjective pain and tenderness. The serum from\r\n  the vesicles fails to show any bacteria and the cellular contents\r\n  are made up almost entirely of polymorphonuclear leucocytes.\r\n  Within a few hours to one or two days the area within the ring\r\n  of vesicles is converted into a dark gray to black pultaceous\r\n  diphtheroid membrane which when detached shows underlying fungating\r\n  granulations, covered with greenish-yellow pus. This membrane, if\r\n  stripped off, tends to reform with great rapidity (twenty-four to\r\n  forty-eight hours), and in many respects resembles the membrane of\r\n  diphtheria except for its dark color.\r\n\r\n  These ulcerations extend with great rapidity and even when showing\r\n  a tendency to heal may suddenly, from a point along the margin,\r\n  proceed to form a new area of ulceration, extending somewhat as\r\n  would a ringworm. When the original site of ulceration fails\r\n  to heal during a period of several weeks, the edges become\r\n  rather indurated but do not show the punched-out or undermined\r\n  characteristics of the first type.\r\n\r\n  These cases last for months and are far more tantalizing than\r\n  the former type of ulceration for the reason that from time to\r\n  time they show a strong tendency to heal, the process clearing up\r\n  almost entirely, when suddenly the former area of the ulceration is\r\n  equalled or exceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nMany of these ulcerations yield readily to salvarsan and in such\r\ncases we naturally think of a syphilitic or framboesial etiology.\r\n\r\n  Castellani has recommended a protargol ointment, 5 to 10%, which is\r\n  applied to the ulcer after previous flushing with hydrogen peroxide\r\n  or other antiseptic lotion.\r\n\r\n  At times thorough cauterization with pure carbolic acid followed by\r\n  neutralization with alcohol may shorten the process.\r\n\r\n  Iodide of potash benefits some cases but has no effect on others\r\n  and the same is true of mercurial treatment.\r\n\r\n  An 8% ointment of scarlet red should be tried on these sores when\r\n  treatment with ordinary applications fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTINEA IMBRICATA\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nThis form of tropical ringworm is chiefly found in the islands of\r\nthe South Pacific and in the Malay Archipelago. It is also found in\r\nSouthern China and quite recently has extended to Southern India and\r\nCeylon. Recently it has been reported from Brazil.\r\n\r\nOn account of the disease having been carried from the Tokelau Group\r\nto Samoa it is often designated _tokelau_.\r\n\r\n  Manson was the first to recognize the affection as due to a fungus\r\n  which he demonstrated microscopically in the scales.\r\n\r\nHe was also able to transmit the disease by inoculation experiments\r\nand found that after about ten days a raised, brownish spot appeared\r\nat the site of inoculation. This spot increased in size until when\r\nabout ¼ inch in diameter its central portion became detached, thus\r\ngiving rise to several thin, rosette-like scales, free at the center\r\nbut still attached peripherally. The fungus advances peripherally,\r\nleaving a smooth surface within. Again there is a similar process\r\ndeveloping in the original central spot to again form a circle of\r\nscales within the older and more peripheral circle. The process is\r\nrepeated until several rings of scales are formed each originating\r\nfrom the central focus as concentric ripples form on water from the\r\nfall of a pebble.\r\n\r\n  These scale circles are from ⅛ to ½ inch apart and give a festooned\r\n  appearance to the affected skin. It was formerly supposed that the\r\n  causative fungus was _Aspergillus concentricus_ but Castellani has\r\n  demonstrated that fungi of this genus, when present, are merely\r\n  accidental. He has isolated in cultures what he considers the\r\n  causative fungus, _Endodermophyton concentricum_. He treated scales\r\n  for ten minutes with absolute alcohol and then placed single scales\r\n  in a series of tubes of maltose bouillon.\r\n\r\nThe fungus grows between the rete malpighii and the external\r\nepidermal layers forming a network of mycelial threads, about 3\r\nmicrons broad.\r\n\r\n  Another fungus cultured from tinea imbricata scales is\r\n  _Endodermophyton indicum._ Inoculation of this organism in pure\r\n  culture produced the disease.\r\n\r\n  The characteristics of the genus _Endodermophyton_ are: The\r\n  growth of a mycelial network between the rete malpighii and the\r\n  superficial epidermal layers; in cultures only mycelial filaments\r\n  are found; there are no conidia-bearing hyphae.\r\n\r\n  The fungus is also called _Trichophyton concentricum_.\r\n\r\n  When this skin disease is introduced into a country with high\r\n  relative humidity and fairly uniform temperature, between 80° and\r\n  90°F. it spreads with great rapidity.\r\n\r\n  A dry climate or one showing considerable variations in temperature\r\n  is not favorable for its spread.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.—Tinea imbricata from the South Seas. (After\r\nKramen; from Mense.)]\r\n\r\nThe clinical characteristic of this form of ringworm is the\r\npresence of rosette-like lesions of several concentric circles of\r\nshingle-like, papery scales which are fixed peripherally and free\r\ntoward the center, thus, from its imbrications, suggesting the name\r\ngiven it by Manson.\r\n\r\n  If one passes the finger over the affected surface from without\r\n  inward there is no sensation of roughness but if passed from the\r\n  center outward the free borders of scales cause a sensation of\r\n  roughness.\r\n\r\nAs these circles extend peripherally they meet the peripheral rings\r\nof other circles so that various curves appear which give the general\r\nappearance of watered silk.\r\n\r\n  The flaky scales are of tissue paper thinness and are of a dirty,\r\n  brownish-gray color.\r\n\r\n  The general health of the patient is not affected but the itching\r\n  is very severe.\r\n\r\nThere is an entire absence of inflammation about this ringworm thus\r\ndifferentiating it from the more common tropical ringworms. Again\r\nthe axillae and crotch are much more rarely affected than in other\r\nringworms as is also true of the face, palms of hands and soles of\r\nfeet. The scalp is never affected.\r\n\r\n  Some claim that the fungus never invades the nails but Manson\r\n  states that this frequently occurs. The presence of the fungus in\r\n  a scale treated with 10% solution of sodium hydrate differentiates\r\n  the scales from those of ichthyosis.\r\n\r\n  Tinea intersecta is somewhat similar to tinea imbricata when\r\n  first appearing, showing dark brown patches but it never shows\r\n  the concentric rings. The ordinary ringworms present inflammatory\r\n  characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nA thorough preliminary scrubbing with soap and water in order better\r\nto expose the fungus to curative applications is important.\r\n\r\nFor treatment Manson recommends iodine liniment. This contains 12½%\r\nof iodine as against 7% for the tincture. The liniment has also\r\n3½% of glycerine which is not an ingredient of the tincture. Both\r\ntincture and liniment have 5% of potassium iodide. The application of\r\nthe tincture does not seem to be as satisfactory as the liniment, the\r\nstronger preparation being more effective.\r\n\r\n  Chrysarobin is very effective but very irritant and has to be\r\n  used with care. An application of a 5% solution of chrysarobin in\r\n  chloroform to the affected area, then painting it over with a 50%\r\n  aqueous solution of ichthyol, often gives good results.\r\n\r\n  Some prefer a 2% to 5% ointment of chrysarobin. Chrysarobin\r\n  produces a conjunctivitis if used near the eyes. Again if absorbed\r\n  it may act as a renal irritant.\r\n\r\n  Castellani strongly recommends the use of resorcin in tincture\r\n  of benzoin (60 to 120 grains of resorcin in 1 ounce of tincture\r\n  of benzoin). Either remedy alone has very little effect, the\r\n  combination being necessary. The application is made once or twice\r\n  daily. In addition to this treatment the patient should be scrubbed\r\n  with sand-soap and hot water twice a week.\r\n\r\n  As regards prophylaxis the clothing should be boiled. The natives\r\n  attach value in preventing the disease to anointing the body with\r\n  cocoanut oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTINEA CRURIS\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nUnder the name “dhobie itch” this fungus affection is probably better\r\nknown to Europeans than any other tropical skin disease. This name\r\ndhobie or washerman’s itch has been given on account of associating\r\nit with the infection of the underclothing while being washed in the\r\npools or streams along with the garments of those who have this skin\r\ndisease. This, like every other widespread view, has probably some\r\nfoundation but cannot be verified. It is the eczema marginatum of\r\nHebra.\r\n\r\n  This affection is caused by various species of _Epidermophyton_.\r\n  This genus differs from _Trichophyton_ in that it never invades the\r\n  hair or hair follicles.\r\n\r\nThe species which have been more frequently reported are\r\n_Epidermophyton cruris_, _E. perneti_ and _E. rubrum_. The mycelium\r\nis about 4 microns broad and the spores about 5 or 6 microns. All\r\nof these fungi can be cultured on Sabouraud’s maltose agar, growth\r\nappearing in about a week, except _E. perneti_, which grows more\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe favorite site is the crotch although the axillary region is also\r\nfrequently involved. The process starts as a papule but these rapidly\r\ndevelop and give rise to an angry red, swollen patch with sharply\r\ndelimited margins. These red, festooned patches are usually limited\r\nto the perineum, scrotum and inner surfaces of the thighs.\r\n\r\nThe itching is unbearable and many secondary infections or eczematous\r\nlesions result from the fierce scratching of the parts.\r\n\r\n  If the patient goes to a cooler place the process subsides to\r\n  return when he comes back to the hot moist climate where the\r\n  infection was originally contracted.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the fungus invades the region between the toes and\r\ngives rise to intolerable itching and from secondary bacterial\r\ninfections to a condition known as “Mango toe.”\r\n\r\n  It has seemed to me that when one has a coccal infection engrafted\r\n  upon the fungus one the condition becomes what might be termed\r\n  fulminating, so rapidly does the itch extend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nWhen the process is markedly inflammatory mild applications are\r\nindicated, such as calamine lotion (30 grains each of calamine\r\nand zinc oxide with 5 or 10 drops of carbolic acid in 1 ounce of\r\nsaturated solution of boric acid).\r\n\r\nA 10% to 15% solution of sodium hyposulphite can, however, be used on\r\nthe area even when markedly inflammatory.\r\n\r\nIodine applications are too irritating for the region of the scrotum.\r\n\r\n  An ointment of resorcin, 20 to 30 grains with 1 dram of sulphur\r\n  to the ounce, may be tried. If chrysarobin be used it should be\r\n  applied with greatest care as noted under tinea imbricata. Many\r\n  advocate applications of solutions of salicylic acid in alcohol, 2%\r\n  to 5%.\r\n\r\n  Manson’s dusting powder of equal parts of boric acid, zinc oxide\r\n  and starch should be freely used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nPINTA\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nThis is a parasitic skin affection due to various species of fungi.\r\nIt is only found in the tropical portion of the new world, and is\r\nespecially prevalent in Colombia, where it has been estimated 4% of\r\nthe population have the disease. It is also found in Mexico, Central\r\nAmerica and some of the other countries of South America as well as\r\nColombia.\r\n\r\n  Other names for the disease are caraate and mal de los pintos.\r\n  At first it was thought that the different colors shown by the\r\n  eruption were due to varying depths of the proliferating fungi in\r\n  the skin layers but it is now known that the explanation is in a\r\n  variety of species in the different types of pinta.\r\n\r\nThe pure violet pinta is caused by _Aspergillus pictor_ while the\r\ngrayish-violet one is due to _Penicillium montoyai_. A species\r\nof _Monilia_ causes the white variety and different species of\r\n_Montoyella_ a black and a red variety respectively. The genus\r\n_Montoyella_ is stated by Castellani to have both slender and thick\r\nmycelial threads, from the thicker of which spring delicate hyphae\r\nterminating in pear-shaped conidia.\r\n\r\n  Material scraped from the lesions and mounted in liquor\r\n  potassae shows the fructification terminations characteristic\r\n  of _Aspergillus_ or _Penicillium_ in the violet or gray-violet\r\n  varieties while the white, black and red ones only show mycelial\r\n  threads and scattered spores. These pinta species of fungi can be\r\n  cultivated on Sabouraud’s medium.\r\n\r\n  Montoya thinks that the pinta fungi lead a saprophytic existence\r\n  in the waters of mines or other places with a constant high\r\n  temperature, and states that he has obtained pure cultures from\r\n  such sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe spots of the eruption are generally first noted on the hands or\r\nface and are rather rough, dry and only slightly raised. Itching is\r\nquite marked and the scratching probably is largely responsible for\r\nthe gradual spread of the affection over the body generally.\r\n\r\nThe palms of the hands, soles of the feet and nails are never\r\ninvolved. The course is essentially chronic and shows no tendency to\r\nspontaneous cure.\r\n\r\n  The red pinta is that most often found in white people, the patches\r\n  being of brick-red color.\r\n\r\n  The white pinta may not only be caused by a species of _Monilia_\r\n  but it may represent an area formerly invaded by a species\r\n  producing some other color and then dying out leaving a\r\n  vitiligo-like area.\r\n\r\n  The violet pinta is quite common among miners, while the black one\r\n  is the type which more often appears in the black population. The\r\n  black varieties may show either a pure black or a violet-black\r\n  color.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nLocal applications of iodine preparations or of chrysarobin seem most\r\neffective. The resorcin sulphur ointment noted under tinea cruris is\r\nbest for the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nMINOR TROPICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SKIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDERMATOPHILIASIS\r\n\r\nThis is a skin infection due to the penetration of the region about\r\nthe feet and especially the toes by the female sand flea or chigoe.\r\nIt is also sometimes called the jigger. This flea is a member of\r\nthe subfamily Sarcopsyllinae which differs from the ordinary flea\r\nsubfamily in that the impregnated female becomes fixed in the tissues\r\nof the host instead of developing her eggs in a free state. The\r\nproper name for this flea is _Dermatophilus penetrans_, synonym\r\n_Sarcopsylla penetrans_. It is found abundantly in Central America\r\nand Northern South America as well as in the West Indies. It is also\r\nfound in East and West Africa as well as India and is apparently\r\nrapidly spreading over the tropical world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.—Sandflea female; much enlarged. (From\r\nMense.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 131.—Sandflea male; much enlarged. (From Mense.)]\r\n\r\n  This flea attacks not only man but many wild and domesticated\r\n  animals as well, and in particular the pig. The males and females\r\n  live in dry sandy soil and feed on the blood of various mammals.\r\n  The importance of the parasite is that upon impregnation the\r\n  female ceases to lead a free existence but burrows into the tissues\r\n  of man or other host and becomes enormously distended with eggs.\r\n  There is some question as to whether these eggs are extruded by the\r\n  female or whether they are set free in the ulceration process which\r\n  tends to occur around the imbedded flea. The eggs develop into\r\n  13-segment larvae, which form a cocoon from which the insect comes\r\n  out in about ten days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.—Sandflea female. Shortly after penetrating\r\nthe skin. The anterior part of the abdomen is much more distended\r\nthan the posterior; the enlarged part is disk-shaped, not globular.\r\n(From Mense.)]\r\n\r\n  The female flea tends to burrow into the skin about the sides of\r\n  the toe nails, although more rarely boring into other parts of\r\n  the body as penis, scrotum, thighs or hands. Finally only the tip\r\n  of the abdomen projects. This marks the black spot which is noted\r\n  in the tense itching area which is quite white unless bacterial\r\n  infection starts up inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe swelling is about the size of a small pea by the end of five or\r\nsix days. Ulceration is the usual termination of the infection if\r\nuntreated and such ulcers may be very intractable or form a favorable\r\nsoil for infection with the tetanus bacillus. Quiros has estimated\r\nthat 250 deaths from tetanus occurred in Costa Rica in 4 years from\r\ninfection of nigua (sand flea) ulcerations.\r\n\r\n  Well-made shoes are most important in prophylaxis and the best\r\n  treatment is to enucleate the egg-distended flea with a needle\r\n  and then touch the cavity with pure carbolic acid followed by\r\n  neutralization with alcohol. It is astonishing how expert the\r\n  natives become in dissecting out these insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROPICAL IMPETIGO\r\n\r\nUnder the designation pemphigus contagiosus Manson describes a very\r\ncommon skin disease of the tropics. The condition, however, is not\r\npemphigus. A bacteriological examination shows in the smear great\r\nnumbers of pus cells containing phagocytized diplococci. Wherry has\r\nnamed the organism _Diplococcus pemphigi contagiosi_. As a matter\r\nof fact, culturally, this organism is the common _Staphylococcus\r\npyogenes aureus_.\r\n\r\n  It is also a matter of common observation that this organism when\r\n  in pus cells of active inflammatory processes shows a diplococcus\r\n  morphology rather than a staphylococcal one.\r\n\r\n  These staphylococcal lesions which do not start in the hair\r\n  follicles are often designated as “pyoses.”\r\n\r\nThe disease is markedly contagious in children and is strikingly\r\nautoinoculable so that unless the first lesion is taken in hand\r\nimmediately the eruption may become generalized. A small spot of\r\nerythema first appears which rapidly becomes vesicular, the bleb\r\ncovering the entire spot, so that there is practically no surrounding\r\ninflammatory areola.\r\n\r\n  The diaphanous covering rubs off with the slightest touch and\r\n  leaves underneath a raw-looking surface which extends peripherally\r\n  to form an angry-looking red patch an inch or more in diameter. In\r\n  adults it rarely affects parts other than the axilla or crotch.\r\n\r\n  The general health of the child is practically unaffected.\r\n\r\n  The usual treatment is with bichloride lotions followed by a\r\n  dusting powder of equal parts of boric acid, starch and zinc oxide.\r\n  I have found, however, that an ointment of ammoniated mercury, 2%\r\n  to 5% according to age, is the most satisfactory treatment.\r\n\r\n  _Tropical Boils._—It is interesting that the same organism\r\n  responsible for this more fulminating lesion should be the one\r\n  responsible for the common cosmopolitan boil and in fact boils are\r\n  exceedingly common in the tropics. These boils may be larger and\r\n  with a greater tendency to widespread distribution and in some\r\n  regions they are so common as to have a regional designation (Nile\r\n  boils). The staphylococcus of tropical impetigo seems to have\r\n  greater virulence than that of the boils. Autogenous vaccines are\r\n  often most successful in the treatment of boils.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIEDRA\r\n\r\nThis is a fungus disease of the hairs in which small nodules form\r\nalong the shaft. They are about the size of the nits of head lice but\r\nmore or less surround the hair instead of projecting off at an angle\r\nas do the ovoid lice nits. These little masses are black in color\r\nand very hard, hence the name piedra—stone. The disease is chiefly\r\nfound in Colombia and is thought to be due to the application, by the\r\nwomen, of a mucilaginous preparation to their hair. If an infected\r\nhair be examined in liquor potassae the nodule will be found to\r\nbe made up of faceted bodies matted to the side of or, at times,\r\nencircling the hair. These bodies are the spores of _Trichosporum\r\ngiganteum_.\r\n\r\n  Besides piedra there are also other nodular affections of the\r\n  hairs due to species of _Nocardia_. Chalmers has recently reported\r\n  several cases of trichonocardiasis where the axillary hairs were\r\n  matted together and the skin of the region inflamed. Castellani\r\n  called attention to this condition in 1911 and reported a narrow,\r\n  bacillus-like fungus as the cause, _Nocardia tenuis_. The nodules\r\n  are rather soft and may be yellow, black or red in color.\r\n  Microscopical examination shows the fungus.\r\n\r\nChalmers had excellent results by treating the affected hairs with a\r\n2% formalin solution in alcohol. At night a 2% ointment of sulphur\r\nwas applied. A 5% alcoholic solution of salicylic acid has also been\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.—Insects in which the larval stage is\r\nimportant.

Later on it becomes worm shaped and is then called torcel in\r\nVenezuela or berne in Brazil. The natives of most of the countries\r\nwhere the infection is found have called the larvae “mosquito\r\nworms” or “gusano de zancudo” and they have even incriminated large\r\nmosquitoes belonging to the genus _Psorophora_ as being responsible\r\nfor the infections.\r\n\r\n  Surcouf has noted that these fly larvae have been found cemented to\r\n  mosquitoes of the genus _Janthinosoma_ by a glue-like substance.\r\n  These mosquitoes are vicious biters and evidently the young larvae\r\n  escape from the eggs attached to the mosquito and enter the wound\r\n  made by the biting parts of the mosquito. Some have thought that\r\n  _D. cyaniventris_ deposits its eggs in a glue-like material on the\r\n  leaves of plants and that they stick to mosquitoes flying about\r\n  such plants. From the facts that these eggs apparently only become\r\n  attached to this particular mosquito, and further in that the eggs\r\n  are attached in a constant manner with the hatching end outward, it\r\n  would seem that the mother fly must in some way seize the mosquito\r\n  and deposit her eggs on it. As the larva grows in the subcutaneous\r\n  tissues of man or other animals a tumor-like swelling develops with\r\n  a central orifice, toward which the posterior extremity of the\r\n  larva points and through which it takes air into its spiracles.\r\n\r\n  It has been stated that the eggs of _D. cyaniventris_ may be\r\n  conveyed by ticks.\r\n\r\nThe swelling somewhat resembles a blind boil and may be as large as a\r\npigeon’s egg.\r\n\r\nThese botfly boils tend to break down and discharge a sero-purulent\r\nfluid and it is supposed that the larva, when mature, escapes as a\r\nresult of the disintegration of the tumor.\r\n\r\n  In Brazil they make tobacco juice applications which cause the\r\n  larva to protrude and then squeeze it out. The injection of a\r\n  little chloroform into the larva with a hypodermic syringe, prior\r\n  to its extraction with a forceps, makes the process less painful.\r\n\r\n=The Screw Worm.=—This is the larva of a bluebottle fly, _Chrysomyia\r\nmacellaria_, which differs from the common bluebottle fly, _Lucilia_,\r\nby having 3 black lines on scutum. This muscid fly lays 200 to 300\r\neggs in wounds or orifices having offensive discharges, as from nose,\r\nears, etc. The larvae burrow into the adjacent tissues and cause\r\nfrightful destruction of all soft parts. The mature larvae are a\r\nlittle more than ⅔ inch long and have circlets of spines around each\r\nof the 12 segments.\r\n\r\nThis infection is especially common in tropical and subtropical\r\nAmerica and is important in animals as well as man.\r\n\r\n  In Yount’s 23 cases 18 were of nasal myiasis; the mortality for\r\n  the 23 cases was 15% and for the nasal ones 22%. Irrigation with\r\n  chloroform water or a 5% carbolic acid or compound cresol solution\r\n  gives the best results in treatment. If the larvae reach the\r\n  sinuses it may be necessary to open them to get at the parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREEPING ERUPTION\r\n\r\nThis is a skin affection which is also called larva migrans\r\non account of its being due to the burrowing of more or less\r\nundetermined fly larvae in the subcutaneous tissues. In their\r\nadvance, which is at the rate of from one to several inches daily,\r\nthey leave a raised pinkish line. The burrow is approximately ⅙ inch\r\nin diameter. The disease is most common in Southern Russia but is\r\nalso found in Africa, Asia and South America. Looss considers that\r\nhookworm larvae, when penetrating the skin, may produce similar\r\nlesions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.—Wing venation of Diptera. _A_, first\r\nposterior cell; _B_, discal mid cross-vein; a, auxiliary vein;\r\n_C_, marginal cell; _D_, submarginal cell.

It should be in the same relative position as in the\r\nTabanus wing.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMBU FLY DISEASE\r\n\r\nThis African myiasis is due to the penetration of thighs or buttocks\r\nby the larvae of _Cordylobia anthropophaga_. The appearance of the\r\ntumefied area is quite similar to that of the tumor of _Dermatobia\r\ncyaniventris_ and the treatment is similar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAW-CRAW\r\n\r\nThis is a rather chronic papular skin disease which is reported from\r\nthe west coast of Africa. These papules may be as large as a small\r\npea and are quite hard. They are found chiefly on legs and arms. The\r\nproximal lymphatic glands may be enlarged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.—Markings of breathing slits on posterior\r\nstigmata of various larvae. 1. _Musca domestica_, showing both\r\nstigmata; 2. _Calliphora vomitoria_; 3. _Stomoxys calcitrans_; 4.\r\n_Auchmeromyia luteola_; 5. _Cordylobia anthropophaga_; 6. _Sarcophaga\r\nmagnifica_.]\r\n\r\n  Undoubtedly many of the cases called craw-craw are scabies. In fact\r\n  the Africans give the name to a host of different skin affections.\r\n  O’Niel thought he had found a filarial larva in one of his cases\r\n  and Nielly incriminated a nematode larva of the Anguillulidae\r\n  family. The cause is unknown and the disease very intractable to\r\n  treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII\r\n\r\nTROPICAL DISEASES OF DISPUTED NATURE OR MINOR IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nVERRUGA PERUVIANA AND OROYA FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is thought that Oroya fever was the disease which proved so\r\n  fatal to Pizarro’s army in the 16th century. In 1870, great\r\n  interest was aroused in these diseases on account of their\r\n  prevalence in the workmen constructing the railroad from Lima to\r\n  Oroya, a town in the Andes. At this time there was much conflict\r\n  of opinion as to whether the two diseases were identical. In 1885,\r\n  Carrion, a medical student of Lima, inoculated himself with the\r\n  blood from a verruga lesion and died from Oroya fever about one\r\n  month later. As the result of this it seemed to be established\r\n  that infection with verruga material would produce the serious\r\n  first-stage fever and many call the fever Carrion’s disease.\r\n  Consequently these two diseases have, until recently, been\r\n  considered as two stages of the same disease, the usual idea being\r\n  that Oroya fever is the first stage, following which, provided\r\n  the patient does not die from this very fatal fever, there sets\r\n  in an eruption which is the second or verruga stage. In order to\r\n  reconcile the observations of the development of the eruptive stage\r\n  without a severe, febrile, preliminary one of three or four weeks,\r\n  it was considered that the first stage might be exceedingly mild.\r\n\r\nStrong and his colleagues, however, inoculated a volunteer with\r\nmaterial from verruga lesions and sixteen days later the eruption\r\nappeared without the preliminary fever and anaemia that are so\r\ncharacteristic of Oroya fever, and it is now recognized that they are\r\ntwo distinct entities.\r\n\r\n\r\nOROYA FEVER\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nOroya fever is an acute, infectious disease, often terminating\r\nfatally, caused by the _Bartonella bacilliformis_, and characterized\r\nby an insidious onset, irregular fever, pains in the bones and a\r\nrapidly developing anaemia of the pernicious anaemia type.\r\n\r\nThe disease is chiefly found in towns situated in narrow,\r\nwind-protected valleys of the west side of the Andes, at elevations\r\nof from 3000 to 9000 feet. Townsend has suggested that a species of\r\n_Phlebotomus_, _P. verrucarum_, which is very prevalent, may be the\r\ntransmitting agent. This investigator believes that verruga and Oroya\r\nfever are the same disease. It may be stated that malaria and enteric\r\nfevers, as well as verruga, are common in the localities where Oroya\r\nfever prevails and much of the confusion in the literature of Oroya\r\nfever is due to failure to differentiate the better known conditions.\r\nStrong noted that Oroya fever was common from January to April,\r\nparticularly towards the close of the warm, rainy season. Cases were\r\nrare in April and May and did not occur in the months of June, July\r\nand August. He notes that verruga was not uncommon at the time when\r\nOroya fever was not occurring. Concomitant infection with Oroya fever\r\nand verruga may occur but this is also true of malaria or malaria and\r\nverruga may exist at the same time.\r\n\r\n  Barton isolated a paratyphoid bacillus from the blood of a patient,\r\n  besides which other bacteria have also been isolated. In 1909,\r\n  Barton noted certain rod-like organisms in the red cells of Oroya\r\n  fever patients which he considered protozoal in nature.\r\n\r\nStrong and his colleagues found in the blood of Oroya fever cases\r\nrod-shaped forms in the red cells, varying from 1 to 2 microns in\r\nlength, the red cells containing from 1 to 30 of these elements.\r\n\r\nA study of sections of lymphatic glands of severe fatal cases showed\r\ngreat numbers of these bodies packed in the endothelial cells. These\r\ncells rupture and set free the organisms.\r\n\r\n  Intravenous inoculation of blood containing these elements\r\n  into monkeys and rabbits was negative in result. Strong failed\r\n  to cultivate the organism. These organisms were considered as\r\n  intermediate between bacteria and protozoa. They are closely\r\n  related to _Grahamella_ and the Harvard commission has proposed\r\n  the name _Bartonella bacilliformis_. In many ways they resemble\r\n  piroplasms, especially _Theileria_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nAt autopsy the skin shows the pale yellowish waxy hue of pernicious\r\nanaemia. The lymphatic glands are somewhat enlarged and may be\r\noedematous. The heart is flabby and ecchymoses may be present in\r\nthe pericardium. The spleen is enlarged, shows numerous infarctions\r\nand contains large amounts of pigment in the form of yellowish\r\nmasses or granules deposited between the splenic cells and in the\r\nendothelial leucocytes. This pigment is like melanin in not giving\r\nthe iron reaction. The liver likewise is enlarged, shows areas of\r\ntoxic degeneration and contains moderate amounts of pigment. The\r\nfemoral marrow is soft and dark red. Microscopically, the endothelial\r\ncells of the lymphatics distended with the causative organisms were\r\nparticularly noted by Strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe incubation period is about three weeks and the onset of the\r\ndisease is marked by malaise and apathy, to be followed by a\r\nrapidly developing anaemia, of the pernicious anaemia type, with an\r\nirregular fever of a remittent character fluctuating between 100°\r\nand 102°F. and only exceptionally going up to 104°F., and pains in\r\nhead, joints and bones. The tenderness over the bones is undoubtedly\r\nassociated with the marked changes going on in the bone marrow and is\r\nparticularly marked over the sternum.\r\n\r\n  The patient rapidly develops a very severe anaemia and death\r\n  results in 20 to 40% of cases in two or three weeks. Delirium is\r\n  often noted.\r\n\r\n  The spleen and the lymphatic glands are somewhat enlarged.\r\n  Associated with the profound anaemia there may be oedema of legs\r\n  and about joints and functional cardiac murmurs. The kidneys do not\r\n  seem to be affected. There may be a diarrhoea in the later stages\r\n  of the disease. There is no eruption in uncomplicated cases.\r\n\r\nThe most important findings in the disease are those in connection\r\nwith the blood examination. The rod-shaped organisms, which are\r\nthought to be the cause of the disease, are somewhat difficult to\r\nobserve in fresh blood preparations. They show definite motility\r\nwithin the red cells, particularly after warming the blood slide. The\r\nmotion is a rather gliding one. In Romanowsky-stained preparations\r\nthe 1 to 2 micron-long rods within the red cells may occur singly or\r\nin numbers of 4 or 5. V-shapes are frequently seen. The rod shows a\r\nbluish staining with a deep purplish-red chromatin-stained granule at\r\none extremity. Rounded, oval or pear-shaped forms may also be seen.\r\n\r\nWhile the parasites are present in great numbers in severe cases they\r\nmay be very scarce in mild forms of the disease.\r\n\r\n  Very striking is the rapidly developing anaemia which frequently\r\n  shows a red cell count of less than a million within a few days.\r\n  Normoblasts are quite numerous and fulminating cases show numerous\r\n  megaloblasts.\r\n\r\n  Polychromatophilia and poikilocytosis are noted.\r\n\r\n  In the red cells we have the picture of a rapidly developing\r\n  pernicious anaemia The color index is above 1.\r\n\r\n  The leucocytes number about 20,000 of which 60 to 70% are\r\n  neutrophiles. Immature neutrophiles, as the metamyelocyte, are very\r\n  common.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\nThe transmitting agent not being known we are in the dark as to\r\nprevention. Evidence points to some arthropod biting at night as the\r\nincidence of the disease decreased when those working in the Oroya\r\nfever zone were compelled to leave the valleys before sundown. The\r\ntreatment is largely one of nursing although some have reported\r\nfavorably from the intravenous administration of salvarsan.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERRUGA PERUVIANA\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nVerruga peruviana is an infectious eruptive disease, caused by an\r\nunidentified virus, lasting two or three months, and characterized by\r\nsuccessive eruptions exhibiting two types of lesion,—the miliary and\r\nthe nodular,—both of which show a pronounced tendency to ulceration\r\nand haemorrhage. The eruption of verruga somewhat resembles that of\r\nyaws and it was at one time suggested that verruga was simply yaws\r\nas influenced by high altitude. Strong and his colleagues found\r\nthat they could infect rabbits intratesticularly and that lesions\r\nresembling those of man could be produced in dogs and monkeys\r\nby cutaneous and subcutaneous inoculations. The virus has been\r\ntransmitted from monkey to monkey. The monkey is not as susceptible\r\nto the virus as man and the rabbit and dog less so. Inoculation of\r\nthe monkey is not followed by a generalized eruption. The Wassermann\r\nreaction was negative. In extracts from the granulomatous lesions\r\nthey found a very active haemolysin. It will be remembered that\r\nanimals are not susceptible to Oroya fever blood inoculations.\r\n\r\n  From the fact that it is possible to inoculate a person by rubbing\r\n  verruga material on a scarified surface it would seem that the\r\n  infection might be transmitted by insects.\r\n\r\nAs regards the pathology of verruga, Cole has noted involvement\r\nof the lymphatic channels, which become obstructed by a cellular\r\nexudate, around which lymphatics are found plasma cells and\r\nfibroblasts. There is marked dilatation of the capillary blood\r\nvessels. The structure of these granulomatous tumors is very\r\nvascular, almost cavernous, hence the tendency to haemorrhage. The\r\nhaemolysin may also be operative in the liability to haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n  Strong and his colleagues found the early lesions to consist of\r\n  newly formed blood vessels lying in an oedematous connective\r\n  tissue. The endothelial cells lining them may be in more than\r\n  one layer. Around these blood vessels we have aggregations of\r\n  cells which are considered as angioblasts. These angioblasts show\r\n  frequent mitotic figures. There is a resemblance to a fibrosarcoma.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is about two weeks as shown by experimental\r\ninoculation but may be as long from the standpoint of clinical\r\nobservation as forty days. At the onset we have rather severe pains\r\nof joints, especially the knees, ankles and wrists, together with\r\na fever sometimes reaching 104°F. but usually not above 100°F.\r\nFollowing the eruption, the temperature usually subsides to normal\r\nin a few days. The eruption shows two types, the one with numerous,\r\nsmall, wart-like lesions, not exceeding the size of a small pea (2\r\nto 5 mm.)—the miliary type, and the other, with less numerous but\r\nmuch larger nodular masses—the nodular type. The latter type is more\r\nrarely seen than the former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.—Verruga Peruviana. (From Ruge and zur\r\nVerth.)]\r\n\r\n  _The Miliary Type._—The eruption is most abundant on the face\r\n  and extensor surfaces of the extremities and less common on the\r\n  trunk. In this type a pink macule appears which rapidly takes on a\r\n  bright red color and becomes nodular. These nodules may be flat or\r\n  somewhat pedunculated and bleed easily. At first smooth and shiny,\r\n  it later on shrivels up without leaving a scar. This form of the\r\n  eruption may involve the mucous membranes, as of conjunctivae,\r\n  nose, pharynx, etc. In children the disease is usually of a mild\r\n  type.\r\n\r\n  _The Nodular Type._—The _nodular eruption_ develops slowly and the\r\n  lesions may become as large as a pigeon’s egg. They tend to become\r\n  strangulated and then show as ulcerating, fungating masses which\r\n  are a source of danger from haemorrhage. The nodular eruption does\r\n  not invade mucous membranes and is usually confined to the regions\r\n  of joints, as flexures of elbows, knees, etc.\r\n\r\n  The eruptions tend to come out in crops and the duration of the\r\n  disease extends over two or three months.\r\n\r\n  _Treatment._—The ordinary principles of cleanliness apply to the\r\n  care of the lesions to prevent secondary infections. When the large\r\n  tumor-like masses begin to ulcerate or become gangrenous they\r\n  should be excised. It must be remembered that dangerous bleeding\r\n  may occur at unexpected times, for which reason the patients should\r\n  be provided with styptics or compresses to prevent serious loss of\r\n  blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nDENGUE AND DENGUE-LIKE FEVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Dengue is an epidemic disease due to an\r\nultramicroscopic, filterable virus which has been stated to be\r\ntransmitted by _Culex fatigans_. More recent work points to\r\n_Stegomyia_.\r\n\r\nIt is characterized by an initial three or four-day febrile paroxysm\r\nof very sudden onset, a remission, which comes on about the fourth\r\nday and a terminal rise of temperature for two or three days—_the\r\nsaddle-back temperature course_.\r\n\r\nBackache and pains about the muscular attachments at the joints and\r\nespecially a marked postorbital soreness are important features.\r\n\r\nAn eruption appears about the third or fourth day. Leucopenia and\r\npolymorphonuclear reduction are constantly noted. Apathy and a mild\r\nneurasthenic state may continue into convalescence.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Dandy Fever (the word dengue is supposed to be derived\r\nfrom the Spanish equivalent of dandy or denguero), Break-bone Fever,\r\nBouquet. German. Dengue-fieber.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—While Hirsch gives the credit for the first mention\r\n  of the disease to the chronicler Gaberti, who described a disease\r\n  with certain resemblances to dengue as existing in Cairo in 1779,\r\n  yet, for the reason that certain clinical features of this epidemic\r\n  would hardly appear to belong to dengue, as we now know it, there\r\n  would seem to be good ground upon which to give the credit of\r\n  priority to Benjamin Rush, who, under the designation break-bone\r\n  fever, gave us a true picture of dengue as it manifested itself in\r\n  Philadelphia in 1780.\r\n\r\n  Gaberti was particularly impressed with the knee involvement so\r\n  that from his description the disease was known as the disease of\r\n  the knees. He further noted swelling of the fingers and that the\r\n  pains continued for more than a month. The sudden onset and the\r\n  sweating would seem to belong to relapsing fever as well as to\r\n  dengue and in support of the view that the disease described by\r\n  Gaberti might have been relapsing fever we have the statement of\r\n  Sandwith that bone pain, chiefly of the knee, is the symptom most\r\n  complained of by the Egyptian native with relapsing fever.\r\n\r\n  Boylon, who reported an outbreak of an epidemic disease in Batavia\r\n  in 1780 stated that everybody was attacked and that the symptoms\r\n  were almost the same as those ushering in plague—headache,\r\n  lassitude and pains in the joints. He noted, however, that this\r\n  epidemic had no bad consequences, patients getting rid of it in\r\n  three days under moderate diet and copious beverages.\r\n\r\n  Ashburn and Craig, in 1907, proved that the disease could be\r\n  transmitted by injections of blood, unfiltered as well as filtered.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The disease may occur in epidemic\r\n  form in almost any part of the tropical or subtropical world. It is\r\n  very common in the countries about the China Sea and in the West\r\n  Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—One can only state that the disease is caused by a\r\nfilterable virus which is present in the patient’s blood from the\r\nsecond to the fifth day. Graham reported a piroplasm-like organism as\r\nthe cause but other workers have failed to confirm this. Reports as\r\nto bacterial causative organisms have not been verified. Cleland and\r\nhis colleagues inoculated guinea pigs and rabbits without result and\r\nwere unable to find spirochaetes. Couvy has reported the presence of\r\nshort spirochaetes in the blood 2 or 3 hours before the onset of the\r\nfever,—never later. They had two or three turns and fine extremities.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—As regards the epidemiology of dengue there seems\r\nto be a general acceptance of the idea that dengue is transmitted\r\nby the common culicine mosquito of the tropics, _Culex fatigans_.\r\nThere is not, however, that definiteness which attaches to the\r\ntransmission of yellow fever by _Stegomyia calopus_ or to pappataci\r\nfever by _Phlebotomus papatasii_, in both of which a certain period\r\nof development of the unknown filterable virus in the arthropod host\r\nis necessary before the insects become capable of transmitting the\r\ninfections.\r\n\r\n  It will be remembered that in the nine experiments as to dengue\r\n  transmission, conducted by Ashburn and Craig, the authors threw out\r\n  five of the cases for such reasons as previous immunity or refusal\r\n  of the experimental mosquitoes to bite. Of the four remaining\r\n  volunteers only one developed dengue. This man, however, had been\r\n  on duty at the Division Hospital in Manila and the statement is\r\n  made that he had not been exposed to the disease so far as could\r\n  be determined. This of course rather militates against the value\r\n  of this isolated experiment and furthermore the mosquitoes which\r\n  bit him had fed on the blood of a dengue patient only two nights\r\n  previously. If this is to be considered as a valid experiment, we\r\n  must believe that only a short sojourn of the virus in the mosquito\r\n  is requisite, which is rather at variance with the twelve days for\r\n  the yellow fever virus and eight days for that of pappataci fever.\r\n\r\n  In the recent Australian epidemic (1916) experiments failed to show\r\n  _C. fatigans_ capable of transmitting the disease. _Stegomyia_,\r\n  however, gave success in 4 out of 7 cases, the volunteers\r\n  developing dengue in from six to nine days after being bitten.\r\n\r\n  _Stegomyia_ mosquitoes are often termed the domesticated ones,\r\n  since they are observed to breed and pass their lives in the\r\n  immediate environment of man and further to be distinctly urban,\r\n  rather than rural, in their distribution. For their breeding places\r\n  they choose artificial collections of water, such as cisterns,\r\n  barrels, pails, bottles and cans, in or near dwellings.\r\n\r\n  These mosquitoes are small in size, silver-striped, vicious feeders\r\n  and very alert. The female alone bites, blood apparently being\r\n  necessary for ovulation. It feeds especially during the morning\r\n  and afternoon hours,—much less commonly at night unless there is\r\n  a light. The life history of _Stegomyia_ is discussed more fully\r\n  under yellow fever.\r\n\r\nAs regards the transmission of the disease by blood filtered through\r\na diatomaceous filter it will be remembered that Ashburn and Craig,\r\nby proving this fact, placed the dengue virus in the same category\r\nwith the filterable viruses of the two diseases just considered.\r\nCleveland found the virus in the washed cells as well as in the\r\nserum. The virus maintains its potency for several days outside the\r\nbody it being present in the blood at periods of from 18 to 90 hours.\r\n\r\n  Lavinder injected dengue blood from cases in the second to fifth\r\n  day into rhesus monkeys without noting any variation in their\r\n  temperature or blood findings.\r\n\r\n  Graham in Beirut carried out some experiments, one of which would\r\n  seem almost positively to demonstrate mosquito transmission. He\r\n  took mosquitoes which had fed on dengue patients, to a village in\r\n  the mountains where no case of dengue existed. He caused these\r\n  mosquitoes to feed on two natives of the village and both men\r\n  became sick with dengue four and five days respectively after\r\n  being bitten by the mosquitoes. Graham’s claims to have noted\r\n  piroplasma-like organisms in dengue blood have not been verified\r\n  and do not receive credence.\r\n\r\nThe most convincing evidence as to mosquito transmission of dengue\r\nis that afforded by the absence of dengue in Port Said during the\r\nyears 1906 and 1907 notwithstanding the prevalence of the disease\r\nin adjacent parts of Egypt. This was attributed to the absence of\r\nmosquitoes, these having been destroyed in the fight to make Port\r\nSaid malaria-free. This campaign was commenced in May, 1906.\r\n\r\n  Other species of culicine mosquitoes, among which may be noted\r\n  _Stegomyia_, have been incriminated. In the Philippines I was\r\n  convinced that _Culex microannulatus_ might transmit the disease\r\n  as well as _C. fatigans_. In one of his experiments Graham claimed\r\n  to have produced dengue by injecting an emulsion of the salivary\r\n  glands of a mosquito which had fed on a dengue patient one or two\r\n  days previously.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nAs death almost never occurs from the disease there is nothing to\r\nnote other than the marked leucopenia.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nAfter a period of incubation of from four to fifteen days the disease\r\nmanifests itself with striking suddenness, in fact the patient can\r\ngenerally recall almost the hour of the onset.\r\n\r\nThe temperature rapidly rises and in a few hours reaches a maximum\r\nof from 102° to 105°F. Associated with this primary fever we have\r\nfrequently a blotchy congestion of the face—the so-called initial\r\nrash.\r\n\r\n  We also have intense headaches, principally supraorbital and\r\n  postorbital. The pulse rate is slightly accelerated at first but\r\n  soon becomes slow and may fall to 50 from the fourth to fifth day.\r\n\r\nThere is no involvement of the joints, and the so-called joint pains\r\nare really pains of the muscular insertions about the joints.\r\n\r\nThe backache of dengue is usually a well marked feature. Pain on\r\nmotion of the eyeballs is a prominent symptom—it is a deep soreness.\r\n\r\nInsomnia, characterized by frequent dropping off to sleep to be\r\nawakened immediately by disturbing dreams, is often noted.\r\n\r\n  The depression, mental and physical, is altogether out of\r\n  proportion to the lack of seriousness of the disease.\r\n\r\n  Malaise and anorexia are marked. Constipation is the rule at first.\r\n\r\nAbout the third or fourth day the temperature drops to normal or\r\nabout that and remains so lowered for from twelve hours to three\r\ndays. At this time the patient feels much better and views his\r\naffection in a less serious light. After this variable intermission\r\nthe temperature rises to possibly a greater height than primarily,\r\nalthough as a rule it is less marked. This interval, or intermission,\r\nseparating two periods of fever gives us a chart designated\r\n“saddle-back.” There may be only one rise of fever.\r\n\r\n  This second febrile attack is attended with pains and possibly\r\n  greater depression than the first accession. It is usually,\r\n  however, of shorter duration and during this period the terminal\r\n  rash appears. This is the most characteristic feature of the\r\n  disease. It generally manifests itself about the dorsal surface\r\n  of hands and feet advancing up forearms and legs. Later on it may\r\n  involve all extremities, face and trunk. The eruption is much like\r\n  that of measles but lacks the dusky red appearance of the measles\r\n  rash. It may however be punctiform and thus resemble the rash of\r\n  scarlet fever.\r\n\r\n  With the appearance of the terminal rash we may have crises such as\r\n  profuse sweating or marked diarrhoea or epistaxis.\r\n\r\nThe desquamation is furfuraceous in character and may be attended by\r\nmarked itching.\r\n\r\nIn some patients (European) there is a rosy carmine flush of palms\r\nof hands and soles of feet. Some authorities have reported glandular\r\nenlargements in dengue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.—Temperature charts of dengue and\r\ndengue-like fevers.]\r\n\r\n  Convalescence is apt to be protracted, being especially\r\n  characterized by malaise and nervous depression, practically\r\n  neurasthenia.\r\n\r\nLeucopenia and polymorphonuclear percentage reduction appear by the\r\nsecond day.\r\n\r\n_Clinical Types._—In different epidemics it is noted that some one\r\nclinical feature may seem outstanding. Of these we may note:—\r\n\r\n(1) The pulse rate is slow for the temperature rise, thus reproducing\r\na phenomenon common in yellow fever (Faget’s law). It is in recent\r\nepidemics particularly that clinical descriptions have recorded the\r\nfrequency of a very slow pulse, most of the older authorities having\r\nnoted a pulse rate which corresponded to the elevation of temperature.\r\n\r\n(2) In some epidemics the feature of glandular swelling is prominent,\r\nwhile in others the swelling is so slight as to be overlooked.\r\n\r\n(3) The characteristic “saddle-back” temperature chart seems lacking\r\nin the general run of cases in certain outbreaks. It is possible that\r\nsuch epidemics, showing atypical temperature curves, may have been\r\ndue to phlebotomus fever, or seven-day fever, instead of dengue.\r\n\r\n(4) In some epidemics, the rash is insignificant or very slight in\r\nmost cases. This observation is possibly dependent on the ephemeral\r\ncharacter of the eruption in certain groups of cases.\r\n\r\n(5) From the chart Fig. 138, analyzing the symptoms in one epidemic,\r\nit will be noted that Lane observed cold, clammy, dusky extremities\r\nin 17 per cent of his cases. This is an unusual finding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _Onset and the Temperature Chart._—Dengue probably sets in more\r\n  abruptly than any other disease. The temperature chart is typically\r\n  saddle-back.\r\n\r\n  _The Pains._—Very marked soreness deeply seated about the place of\r\n  origin of the ocular muscles so that every movement of the eyeballs\r\n  is at once complained of as giving pain.\r\n\r\n  General pains all over the body, more especially of the back and\r\n  about tendinous insertions of the muscles which cause the pains to\r\n  be referred to the joints. The knee-joint pains are probably the\r\n  most frequent. The rachialgia may be as great as that in variola or\r\n  yellow fever.\r\n\r\n  _The Eruption._—The characteristic eruption does not appear until\r\n  about the time of the intermission or with the accession of the\r\n  terminal fever.\r\n\r\n  The fall of fever about the third or fourth day is often attended\r\n  by a critical epistaxis, sweat or diarrhoea, to be succeeded by an\r\n  intermission of from one to three days of a feeling of well-being.\r\n  About this time or with the secondary rise of fever the true dengue\r\n  rash appears. It is at first noted about the bases of the thumbs\r\n  and extending over the dorsal surfaces of the wrists. Almost\r\n  simultaneously a measles-like rash appears over the dorsal and\r\n  internal surfaces of the big toe extending to the ankle, especially\r\n  over the internal malleolus. Later on the elbows and knees may be\r\n  involved or the rash may cover thickly the entire body. A carmine\r\n  flush of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet is not\r\n  uncommon. A furfuraceous desquamation with much itching at times\r\n  follows the eruption. The so-called primary eruption is nothing\r\n  more than an initial flushing of the face, it is ephemeral. The\r\n  true dengue rash may also be quite ephemeral but usually it lasts\r\n  for two or three days, or possibly four or five days.\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—Besides the headaches we have insomnia and\r\n  depression which extends through convalescence. Apathy is marked.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—This shows a leucopenia of about 4000 from shortly\r\n  after the onset together with a reduction of the percentage of\r\n  polymorphonuclears to about 45%. During the attack the eosinophiles\r\n  are decreased but there is an increase during convalescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe two diseases with which dengue can be most easily confused are\r\ninfluenza and yellow fever. In fact when the great pandemic of\r\ninfluenza (1890) first made its appearance in France, many regarded\r\nit as an atypical form of dengue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLINICAL CHART ONE HUNDRED CASES OF DENGUE FEVER\r\n\r\nFIG. 138.—Dengue. Analysis of Symptoms, from 100 cases occurring in\r\nepidemic at St. Thomas, V. I. (After Lane, from U. S. Naval Medical\r\nBulletin.)]\r\n\r\n  The respiratory involvement of influenza and the eruption and\r\n  comparatively slow pulse of dengue are the principal points of\r\n  difference. It must be remembered that affections in the tropics,\r\n  diagnosed as influenza, have shown but slight respiratory symptoms,\r\n  the cases being more of a nervous or intestinal type. The eruption\r\n  of dengue may fail to appear or be missed in the study of the case.\r\n  The blood findings should aid in differentiation from influenza as\r\n  is also true of yellow fever, a disease which likewise has blood\r\n  findings of practically a normal character. Other than the blood\r\n  picture we have in yellow fever (1) albuminuria, coming on about\r\n  the second day, and (2) jaundice appearing about the third day.\r\n  In dengue the eruption appears from the third to the fifth day.\r\n  Albuminuria is absent in dengue.\r\n\r\nDengue may be mistaken for measles, but the early coryza, Koplik\r\nspots and marked rash, first appearing about the face, should\r\ndifferentiate.\r\n\r\nIn scarlet fever the rapid pulse, angina and leucocytosis should be\r\nsufficiently differentiating.\r\n\r\n  Confusion with articular rheumatism may arise when the pain\r\n  about wrists, knees and ankles has been mistaken for true joint\r\n  involvement.\r\n\r\n  The headache and backache of smallpox may be confusing until the\r\n  eruption about the forehead appears. The leucopenia of dengue is\r\n  the main differential point in these first three days of doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n=Prophylaxis.=—This would seem to rest entirely upon the question of\r\ndestruction of mosquitoes and prevention of the mosquito from biting\r\na patient. In dengue the virus is apparently in the blood for four or\r\nfive days so that screening of patients is necessitated for a longer\r\nperiod than for yellow fever or phlebotomus fever.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=—The malaise and depression are generally so great that\r\nthe patient keeps his bed voluntarily. A light diet is indicated\r\nalthough the anorexia is so marked that it is difficult to persuade a\r\npatient to take food.\r\n\r\n  Cold spongings, provided the patient is not disturbed by being\r\n  moved, are of value for the insomnia. Phenacetine may be given for\r\n  the relief of the headache and backache. It is rarely necessary to\r\n  give morphine.\r\n\r\n  During convalescence tonics are indicated and if there is any\r\n  condition where a good wine is of value, it is in this, to\r\n  counteract the terrible depression. It has been suggested that\r\n  adrenal insufficiency may account for the asthenic, protracted\r\n  convalescence and from this standpoint adrenalin has been\r\n  recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENGUE-LIKE FEVERS\r\n\r\nPHLEBOTOMUS OR PAPPATACI FEVER\r\n\r\n=Etiology and Epidemiology.=—This fever, which is often called\r\nthree-day fever, on account of its running its course in this period,\r\nis caused by a filterable virus. This virus only seems to be in the\r\nblood of the patient’s peripheral circulation during the first\r\ntwenty-four hours of the illness, blood abstracted toward the end of\r\nthe second day and injected into a well person failing to reproduce\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n  If the blood is filtered through a Pasteur candle F, the filtrate\r\n  will set up an attack just as well as the unfiltered blood, in this\r\n  respect being like dengue and yellow fever. Couvy reports having\r\n  found spirochaetes in the blood 3 hours and 24 hours after the\r\n  onset.\r\n\r\nThe transmitting agent is a moth midge, _Phlebotomus papatassii_.\r\nThis midge, as is true of the psychodid family, to which it belongs,\r\nis very hairy. It has long slender legs and narrow wings. The\r\nproboscis is as long as the head and the lancets project beyond the\r\nlabium.\r\n\r\n  The female alone bites, which act takes place chiefly at night;\r\n  cool, moist, shady places, away from sleeping rooms, being\r\n  preferred in the day time. The insect is a persistent, vicious\r\n  feeder, difficult to escape from, as mosquito nets offer no\r\n  protection. It takes from six to eight days after feeding on a\r\n  patient in the first day of the fever before the midge is capable\r\n  of transmitting the disease, this being in accordance with the\r\n  twelve-day developmental period in the mosquito, that holds\r\n  for yellow fever. Doerr thinks that the pappataci virus may be\r\n  transmitted hereditarily by the insect to the egg.\r\n\r\n  At present, of the genera of the three families of midges, only\r\n  _Phlebotomus_ is known to transmit disease. _P. papatasii_\r\n  transmits phlebotomus fever in the Balkans. _P. minutus_ is the\r\n  host at Aden. Another species, _P. perniciosus_, can transmit the\r\n  disease. These moth midges are 2 mm. in length and have the body\r\n  densely covered with long yellow hairs. The second longitudinal\r\n  vein has three distinct branches. The antennae have 16 restricted\r\n  joints and the proboscis is as long as the head. The species of\r\n  _Phlebotomus_ are separated by slight variations in wing venation,\r\n  palpal lengths, etc., thus the second segment of palpi of _P.\r\n  papatasii_ is a little longer than the third one, while with _P.\r\n  perniciosus_ these segments are of equal lengths. In _P. minutus_\r\n  the second segment is only half the length of the third. The insect\r\n  lays about 40 eggs in damp dark places. The period of metamorphosis\r\n  from egg to insect is about one or two months, according to\r\n  temperature.\r\n\r\n_Phlebotomus_ larvae die out in dry soil and very wet earth is\r\nunfavorable. Moderate moisture and protection from light seem\r\nnecessary for their development. The remains of dead insects also\r\nseem to make good breeding places. It is in cracks of old damp brick\r\nor stone walls that the female most often deposits her eggs. Caves\r\nare also selected.\r\n\r\n  Blood seems necessary for the fertilization of the eggs but lizard\r\n  blood seems more common in the stomach of _P. minutus_ than human\r\n  blood. They have also been observed to feed on other reptilian\r\n  bloods. The female insect has been kept alive in captivity up to\r\n  forty-six days.\r\n\r\n  Cases first appear in the late Spring and the disease becomes\r\n  epidemic during the Summer.\r\n\r\n  An attack produces quite an immunity.\r\n\r\n  The disease has chiefly been studied in the Balkan States but\r\n  undoubtedly it is widespread.\r\n\r\n  The disease is almost never fatal so that we know nothing of its\r\n  pathology.\r\n\r\n=Symptomatology.=—The symptoms will answer perfectly for cases\r\nof dengue one sees in a dengue epidemic in which, instead of the\r\nsaddle-back course of fever, we have a three-day primary rise and\r\nthen a fall to normal without any secondary fever rise. Cases of\r\nphlebotomus fever are occasionally reported where the fever continues\r\nseven or eight days.\r\n\r\n  The symptoms as usually given are as follows: After a period of\r\n  incubation of from three to six days there is an abrupt onset with\r\n  congested face and injected conjunctivae. There is pain in head,\r\n  eyes and back. There is marked malaise with great depression of\r\n  spirits. There is anorexia with coated tongue and rarely vomiting\r\n  and diarrhoea. There may be some congestion of the pharynx and\r\n  even a slight bronchitis. So much in common with influenza has it\r\n  clinically that a synonym is summer influenza. The liver and spleen\r\n  are normal. Mental depression is frequently noted. Epistaxis is\r\n  rather common.\r\n\r\nThere is a leucopenia and polymorphonuclear percentage decrease. The\r\ntwo points which are chiefly advanced in its clinical differentiation\r\nfrom dengue are (1) slow pulse, a bradycardia, and (2) only three\r\ndays of fever and absence of eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVEN-DAY FEVER\r\n\r\nRogers first described a dengue-like fever which occurred in India\r\nduring the summer months as seven-day fever. The fever course was at\r\ntimes typically saddle-back and again would be of continuous type.\r\nA pulse relatively slow for the temperature is generally recorded,\r\ntogether with sudden onset and general malaise. The spleen is at\r\ntimes enlarged and there is a definite leucopenia and polynuclear\r\npercentage reduction. The eruption is only occasionally present\r\n(about 10%) and is an erythema which makes its appearance on the\r\nextensor surfaces of the forearm about the fourth day after the onset.\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—In cases similar clinically to the seven-day fever of\r\nRogers, Ido, Ito and Wani have found a spirochaete resembling that\r\nof infectious jaundice and designated _Leptospira hebdomadalis_.\r\nIt can be differentiated from _L. icterohaemorrhagiae_ by immunity\r\nreactions. It is found in the blood during the fever period and young\r\nguinea pigs can be infected by such blood either subcutaneously\r\nor by mouth. The organism can be cultured by Noguchi’s method. The\r\nspirochaete is to be found in the urine towards the end of the\r\ndisease and the urine is probably the source of infection. In Japan\r\nfield mice seem to be the carriers of this spirochaete. In about 3%\r\nof such rodents the spirochaete can be found in the urine and the\r\ndisease is limited to the sections in which the field mice are found.\r\nThere is practically no mortality and the treatment is symptomatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND-FLY FEVER, AND THREE-DAY FEVER\r\n\r\nThese dengue-like fevers of India are practically identical\r\nclinically with phlebotomus fever. The usual idea is that dengue\r\nepidemics are far more explosive in character than is true of\r\nepidemics transmitted by the sand-fly.\r\n\r\nThe strongest point in differentiation of sand-fly fever and dengue\r\nis that neither confers any immunity for the other disease.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions of enlarged glands and break-bone pains are often\r\nadvanced as characteristic of dengue and not of sand-fly fever. I\r\nhave never observed other than slight glandular enlargement in dengue\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIX-DAY FEVER\r\n\r\nDeeks has described a disease from Panama with a dengue-like clinical\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThere were but slight changes from normal in the pulse rate or blood\r\nfindings. Some of the cases showed a late scarlatiniform eruption.\r\n\r\nIt was considered that the continuous fever for six days and\r\nthe enlargement of the spleen, which accompanied the disease,\r\ndifferentiated it from dengue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTSUTSUGAMUSHI\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—This is an acute febrile disease caused by the bite of\r\nthe larval Kedani mite of the region where the infection prevails.\r\nThe onset is characterized by headache and giddiness, a rather\r\nrapidly rising temperature and swelling of the lymphatic glands\r\ndraining the region in which is situated a small necrotic ulcer\r\nmarking the site of the bite. With injected conjunctivae, continuous\r\nfever and hyperaesthesia, the disease goes on for about a week when\r\na macular eruption appears about face, then chest, extremities and\r\ntrunk. About ten days after the appearance of the eruption there is a\r\nfall of fever by lysis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.—The Kedani mite. _Trombidium akamushi._\r\n(From Ruge and zur Verth.)]\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Flood fever, Japanese River fever, Kedani mite disease.\r\nShimamushi.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—There are records which would indicate that the disease\r\n  has been known for more than 1000 years.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—It is only in the western part of the\r\n  island of Nippon, when the banks of the Shinanogawa are inundated\r\n  each spring, that we find the disease. The disease is supposed\r\n  to be confined to Japan although Ashburn and Craig have thought a\r\n  disease observed by them in the Philippines as possibly identical.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe cause is unknown, but has been attributed by some to various\r\nbacteria and by others to a protozoon.\r\n\r\n  Nagayo attaches importance to piroplasm-like forms found in the\r\n  spleen and lymphatic glands.\r\n\r\n  Kawamuro and his colleagues could not demonstrate any organism by\r\n  any method of examination. The virus is in the blood and even as\r\n  small an amount as 0.001 cc. may infect a monkey although 0.1 cc.\r\n  is usually required. The virus is present also in the enlarged\r\n  lymph glands. Heating the blood at 50°C. for 10 minutes destroys\r\n  the virus. Recently Hayashi has reported as cause minute rod,\r\n  ring-shaped or spheroid bodies which when stained with Giemsa’s\r\n  stain are brought out in the lymphocytes and endothelial phagocytes\r\n  of lymph nodes and spleen. They also occur in the blood plasma\r\n  and in severe cases in red blood cells. He has transmitted the\r\n  disease to monkeys, guinea pigs and rabbits. These bodies resemble\r\n  bacteria, in this respect resembling the organisms of typhus and\r\n  spotted fever of the Rocky Mountains. Hayashi regards the organism\r\n  as resembling _Theileria parva_ and _Bartonella bacilliformis_,\r\n  and believes he has shown the field mouse to be a reservoir of the\r\n  virus.\r\n\r\n  The disease is not communicable from person to person and\r\n  only follows the bite of a larval mite, _Trombidium akamushi\r\n  (Leptotrombidium akamushi)_. This is a minute orange-red arachnoid\r\n  which can scarcely be seen with the naked eye. This mite is only a\r\n  source of danger in the region of the inundated river banks, its\r\n  bite not producing the disease elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  Persons harvesting hemp during August are liable to contract the\r\n  disease if bitten by the larval mite.\r\n\r\n  The mite is found in large numbers on the ears of field mice, these\r\n  hosts, however, not appearing to be suffering from any particular\r\n  disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nOther than the local ulcer and the swollen regional glands, there is\r\nlittle that is definite. The spleen shows enlargement and there is\r\nalso swelling of the mesenteric glands. The lower part of the ileum\r\nmay show injection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n=A Typical Case.=—About one week after receiving the bite of\r\nthe larval mite, which may not have been noticed by the patient,\r\nthere develop chilliness, giddiness and headache, with a rising\r\ntemperature. In two or three days from the onset, painful glands are\r\nnoticed in certain regions as of groin, axilla or neck. From these\r\nglands we can often by following inflamed lymphatics find the small\r\nnecrotic ulcer which is often located in the armpit or in the region\r\nof the genitals. There is a dark red areola about the ulcer which is\r\nonly slightly tender. The glands are not very much enlarged and are\r\nnot excessively tender. There may be general glandular enlargement\r\nfollowing that of the primary swellings. The pulse rate is only from\r\n80-100, notwithstanding the rise of the fever to 104°F. or even 105°F.\r\n\r\n  The body is decidedly hyperaesthetic and the conjunctivae are\r\n  injected. There is frequently deafness. About the seventh day a\r\n  macular eruption appears first on the face and then spreads to\r\n  chest, extremities and trunk. The eruption never becomes petechial.\r\n  The tongue becomes dry and cracked. There is often a cough. The\r\n  blood shows a leucopenia. The eruption disappears in from seven to\r\n  ten days and the fever becomes remittent or intermittent and, after\r\n  a few days, reaches normal. Parotitis may occur as a complication.\r\n\r\nSchüffner has described a similar disease from Sumatra. The mortality\r\nis, however, only 3% as against the 30% in Japan. He thinks it is\r\ntransmitted by a tick. In his cases the necrotic ulcer and glandular\r\nenlargements were followed by a roseola which reached its maximum\r\non the eighth to tenth day and was most marked on the trunk and\r\nflanks. The nervous symptoms resembled typhoid fever and there was a\r\nlymphocytosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—There is marked giddiness and headache at\r\n  the onset. Hyperaesthesia of the body is quite characteristic.\r\n  There is often delirium at night. Deafness is frequently noted.\r\n\r\n  _The Cutaneous System._—A small necrotic ulcer about ⅙ inch in\r\n  diameter, with a dusky red areola, is noted at the site of the bite\r\n  of the larval mite. The healing of the ulcer is delayed well on\r\n  into convalescence.\r\n\r\n  About one week after the onset a dusky macular eruption appears\r\n  first on the face (cheeks), then going to the chest, legs, forearms\r\n  and trunk. It is not marked on neck, arms or thighs. It never\r\n  becomes petechial.\r\n\r\n  _Fever Course._—The temperature, which on the first day or\r\n  two reaches only 101° to 103°F., becomes later on higher and\r\n  continuous. About the tenth day from the appearance of the eruption\r\n  it begins to fall, becoming remittent and then intermittent.\r\n\r\n  _The Lymphatic System._—Very characteristic is the swelling of the\r\n  glands proximal to the initial ulcer. The connecting lymphatics may\r\n  be inflamed. Later on other glands may show slight swelling and\r\n  tenderness.\r\n\r\n  The spleen is usually enlarged.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—There is no change in the red cells but there is a\r\n  leucopenia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nIn the differential diagnosis the limited geographical distribution\r\nshould prevent error and, in particular, where one has the initial\r\nnecrotic ulcer, with enlargement of the glands draining the region\r\nin which it is located, there should be little confusion. Of course\r\nplague may have a primary vesicle or ulcer with enlargement of\r\nneighboring glands; these glands however are matted together and are\r\nexquisitely tender.\r\n\r\n  Then too the eruption of tsutsugamushi and the early and more\r\n  stuporous state of plague should differentiate, even without the\r\n  aid of the laboratory.\r\n\r\n  It is usual to consider tsutsugamushi, typhus fever and spotted\r\n  fever of the Rocky Mountains as having many characteristics in\r\n  common. These diseases may best be differentiated by the fever\r\n  course and eruption as shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------\r\n                    |     Fever course        |       Eruption\r\n  ------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------\r\n  _Tsutsugamushi_   |Fever increases each day |Begins on face, then chest,\r\n                    | until reaching maximum  | legs, forearms and trunk.\r\n                    | about 4th or 5th day.   | Does not become petechial.\r\n                    | Fall by lysis after     | First appears about 7th\r\n                    | fading of eruption.     | day.\r\n  ------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------\r\n   _Tabardillo._    |Onset and termination    |Begins on abdomen, sides of\r\n   _Typhus fever._  | of fever characterized  | chest, thence going to\r\n   _Brill’s         | by considerable         | extremities.

It may be necessary to use drugs to\r\ncombat the insomnia.\r\n\r\nThe serum of monkeys which have recovered from the disease seems to\r\nhave some value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nSPOTTED FEVER OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—The disease is chiefly reported from certain sections\r\nof the states of Montana and Idaho. The virus is not filterable\r\nand is probably bacterial in nature and is transmitted solely by\r\nthe tick, _Dermacentor andersoni_, which arthropod host gets its\r\ninfection from certain rodents of the section serving as virus\r\nreservoirs.\r\n\r\n  Maxey described the disease as follows: “An acute endemic,\r\n  noncontagious, but probably infectious febrile disease,\r\n  characterized clinically by a continuous moderately high fever,\r\n  severe arthritic and muscular pains and a profuse, petechial\r\n  eruption in the skin, appearing first on the ankles, wrists and\r\n  forehead but rapidly spreading to all parts of the body.”\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Rocky Mountain fever. Tick fever of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nBlack fever. Blue disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—The disease was first noted in the Snake River Valley\r\n  of Idaho, about 1893, and in the Bitter Root Valley of Montana,\r\n  about 1890. There is some evidence that the disease may have\r\n  existed among the Indians prior to the advent of white settlers in\r\n  the Bitter Root Valley. The disease was first described by Doctor\r\n  M. W. Wood, U. S. A., in 1896. It is interesting to note that the\r\n  first white settlers of the Bitter Root Valley suffered from what\r\n  was considered a very fatal form of “black measles.”\r\n\r\n  In 1902 Wilson and Chowning reported that the disease was due to a\r\n  piroplasm of the squirrel and that it was transmitted to man by the\r\n  bite of a tick (_Dermacentor venustus_). Later Ashburn and others,\r\n  while accepting the tick transmission, failed to corroborate the\r\n  piroplasm etiology.\r\n\r\n  It is chiefly to Ricketts that we owe much of our detailed\r\n  knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease.\r\n\r\n  The work of McClintic and Frick along lines of prophylaxis has\r\n  given us practical measures for the control of the disease.\r\n\r\n  The views of Ricketts, Wolbach and Frick as to etiology are\r\n  discussed under that heading.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The two best known regions of\r\n  prevalence of the disease are the Bitter Root Valley of Montana and\r\n  the Snake River Valley of Idaho. It is also reported from limited\r\n  sections of Washington, Oregon and California, as also from Nevada\r\n  and Utah.\r\n\r\n  In Wyoming it is rather widely distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—Wolbach states that he has noted certain bacterial forms\r\nin the endothelial cells of the blood vessels of guinea pigs infected\r\nwith the virus, as well as a very general distribution in infected\r\nticks.\r\n\r\n  There are two morphological types—one, a chromatic-staining\r\n  lanceolate diplococcoid organism, found in the circulating blood as\r\n  well as in the endothelial cells, the other type—a blue-staining\r\n  rod-shaped form.\r\n\r\n  Ricketts noted certain chromatin-staining bacteria, in man and\r\n  in eggs of infected ticks, which were about 1 micron long by ⅓\r\n  micron broad, showed chromatin staining, were about the size of\r\n  _B. influenzae_, and appeared as two lanceolate-shaped bodies.\r\n  These bodies are now considered as belonging to the _Rickettsia_\r\n  group of organisms. Wolbach has named the organism of spotted fever\r\n  of the Rocky Mountains _Dermacentroxenus rickettsi_. In infected\r\n  guinea pigs Wolbach found these bodies particularly abundant in the\r\n  endothelial cells.\r\n\r\n  Frick has also found bodies within the red cells of human cases\r\n  and infected guinea pigs, as well as extracellularly, which showed\r\n  chromatin-staining characteristics, there often being an elongated\r\n  reddish body joined on to a larger blue-staining protoplasm.\r\n\r\n  In 1902 Wilson and Chowning reported the finding of piroplasm-like\r\n  bodies in the blood of human cases of Rocky Mountain Spotted\r\n  Fever. Ricketts proved that the virus was not filterable. A tick,\r\n  _Dermacentor andersoni_ transmits the disease.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—The transmitting tick, _D. andersoni_ (_D.\r\nvenustus_) lives on the domesticated animals of the region of\r\ngeographical distribution of the disease. Ricketts showed that\r\nthe reservoir of the virus was to be found in ground squirrels,\r\nchipmunks, mountain rats, etc., and that ticks feeding on these\r\nrodents become infected and transmit the disease to man. The guinea\r\npig, white rat and monkey are also susceptible.\r\n\r\n  The virus can be propagated indefinitely in guinea pigs without\r\n  loss of virulence by weekly blood inoculations in another animal.\r\n  The virus seems to be transmitted by the salivary secretion of the\r\n  tick and a tick once infected remains infective for the remainder\r\n  of life.\r\n\r\n  Frick succeeded in obtaining anaerobic cultures from infected blood\r\n  of a bacillus, somewhat resembling the _B. typhi exanthematici_ of\r\n  Plotz. These bacteria, however, did not show complement fixation\r\n  with immune serum and were nonpathogenic to guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n  Spotted fever is a disease of rural districts and tends to give\r\n  only one case to a house, thus indicating the negative rôle\r\n  of bedbugs, lice, etc. It is at the time when ticks are most\r\n  abundant, in the months of the spring, that the disease makes its\r\n  appearance. The virus is in the blood during the entire febrile\r\n  course.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe cadaver shows marked jaundice with petechial spots on extremities\r\nand trunk.\r\n\r\nThere is marked venous engorgement and the blood is very dark and\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\n  In the blood vessels we have proliferation of the endothelial cells\r\n  leading to thrombosis.\r\n\r\n  Ricketts noted enlargement of the lymph glands. The spleen is three\r\n  or four times the normal size and is quite firm. Microscopically\r\n  it shows extensive endothelial cell proliferation. The kidneys are\r\n  enlarged and congested. Gangrene of the prepuce and scrotum are\r\n  often noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is from five to ten days when the disease\r\nsets in with considerable abruptness, with more or less marked\r\nrigors, headache, malaise and severe pains of the larger joints, but\r\nwithout inflammatory changes.\r\n\r\n  Some cases present a prodromal period lasting a day or so with\r\n  malaise and chilly sensations followed by the symptoms noted above.\r\n  Hyperaesthesia and photophobia are apt to be present during the\r\n  course of the disease.\r\n\r\n  The eruption first appears from the second to the fifth day as\r\n  macules about the wrists and ankles, thence spreading over the\r\n  extremities and extending to the trunk. These macules tend to\r\n  become petechial.\r\n\r\n  _The Pulse._—The pulse is not very rapid (90-110) and the fever\r\n  steadily rises day by day from the initial 102°F to reach a maximum\r\n  of about 105°F. by the end of a week or so. A toxaemic condition\r\n  appears early.\r\n\r\n  A stuporous state is fairly common but in many cases the mind is\r\n  clear throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThe spleen is palpable early in the disease and is quite firm, not\r\nsoft like the spleen of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n  The kidney involvement shows itself early as an albuminuria.\r\n\r\n  Constipation is rather a constant feature.\r\n\r\n  Icterus and vomiting tend to come on later in severe cases.\r\n\r\n  _Gangrene._—Gangrene of the tonsils, scrotum and prepuce are more\r\n  common in the milder type of the disease, as seen in Idaho, than in\r\n  the more severe one of Montana.\r\n\r\n  There is leucocytosis early in the disease, falling to about 10,000\r\n  after a few days. There is an increase in the large mononuclears.\r\n  The eosinophiles are decreased in percentage.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe association of a tick bite and proper geographical distribution\r\nis of prime importance. The more sudden onset, joint pains and\r\nnegative Widal differentiate it from typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n  Typhus fever shows more marked abruptness of onset and decline\r\n  of fever than does Rocky Mountain fever. The guinea pig, while\r\n  susceptible to both infections, is more easily infected with this\r\n  disease than with typhus fever.\r\n\r\n  As a matter of fact there are marked clinical resemblances between\r\n  typhus fever and Rocky Mountain fever. Tsutsugamushi and trench\r\n  fever also have points of resemblance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.—Generalized eruption of spotted fever of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. (Kindness of Doctor Frick.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\n  It is very remarkable that the disease should rather constantly\r\n  give a mortality approximating 75 to 90% in western Montana and\r\n  only about 5% for Idaho.\r\n\r\n  Where the nervous manifestations are marked the prognosis is more\r\n  unfavorable. Death tends to occur in the second week and patients\r\n  living through this week have a good chance for recovery. The death\r\n  rate is greatest in old people and least in young children.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\n  =Prophylaxis.=—_Dermacentor andersoni_ requires a long time to\r\n  become attached and feed on the human host—at least one or more\r\n  hours—hence inspection of one’s person for ticks after returning\r\n  from exposure and removing those found would tend to prevent\r\n  infection.\r\n\r\n  When these ticks attach themselves to the wool of grazing sheep,\r\n  87% seem to die, possibly from the effect of the fat in the wool.\r\n\r\n  Again such sheep can be dipped for further destruction of the ticks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.—Female D. andersoni. 2. Head showing (a)\r\nhypostome, (b) chelicerae, (c) palps. 3. Male.]\r\n\r\n  =Treatment.=—Just as with typhus fever the most important point\r\n  in the care of the patient is good nursing. The room should be\r\n  darkened and quiet maintained. Cool sponging lowers the temperature\r\n  and is a tonic for the nervous disorders. An ice cap is good for\r\n  the headache. The diet should be liquid and water should be given\r\n  freely on account of the tendency to renal involvement.\r\n\r\n  There is a tendency to heart failure so that the recumbent position\r\n  is demanded and cardiac stimulants indicated.\r\n\r\n  Michie and Parsons found sodium citrate of greatest benefit in\r\n  treating infected guinea pigs and recommended it for human cases.\r\n  It is to be used intravenously and about 60 cc. of a 5% solution\r\n  given twice daily. Immune sera were tried out by Ricketts, but\r\n  without result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTYPHUS FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Typhus fever is an acute infectious disease, possibly\r\ncaused by _Rickettsia prowazeki_. There is a fairly abrupt onset,\r\nwith a continued fever lasting about two weeks, followed by a\r\ncritical fall or rather rapid lysis of temperature. About the fifth\r\nday a rose spot eruption, similar to that of typhoid, first appears\r\nabout the loins and abdomen later on extending over the trunk and\r\nextremities. The rash tends to become petechial and stands out rather\r\nprominently on a general cutaneous mottling. The stuporous state is a\r\nmarked feature of the disease. It is transmitted by lice.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Jail fever; Ship fever; Putrid fever; Petechial fever;\r\nTyphus exanthematicus. Ger. Fleckfieber; Fr. Typhus exanthématique;\r\nSp. El tabardillo; Ital. Typho-esantematico.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—Hirsch notes that the history of typhus fever belongs\r\n  to the dark pages of the world’s story, at times when war, famine,\r\n  and misery of every kind are present. It is reasonable to suppose,\r\n  according to this author, that many of the pestilences of ancient\r\n  times and the Middle Ages were typhus fever. This disease was\r\n  prevalent among the Spanish soldiers at the time of the conquest of\r\n  Grenada and the designation of the disease then used (Tabardillo)\r\n  is the one now given typhus fever in Mexico.\r\n\r\n  The disease was first described with sufficient accuracy by\r\n  Frascatorius, in the 16th century, to enable us distinctly to\r\n  differentiate it from plague; the stuporous states of the two\r\n  diseases having previously caused them to be confounded. In\r\n  England, in the 16th century, the disease was very prevalent in\r\n  the jails and court officials attending the trials of prisoners\r\n  often contracted the disease and died; hence the designation “black\r\n  assizes.”\r\n\r\n  During the Thirty Years War, in the 17th century, typhus fever\r\n  spread over central Europe.\r\n\r\n  Typhus fever was very prevalent at the time of the epidemic of\r\n  plague known as the great plague of London and it is a matter of\r\n  practical interest that the two diseases were not infrequently\r\n  confounded by medical men. There were some very severe epidemics of\r\n  the disease in Ireland in the 19th century.\r\n\r\n  Typhoid fever and typhus fever were only separated as distinct\r\n  diseases by Gerhard, 1837. Huxham, however, had previously noted\r\n  the marked difference between putrid malignant fever and slow\r\n  nervous fever.\r\n\r\n  Until very recent times it was declared that typhus fever was among\r\n  the most contagious diseases of man and innumerable instances were\r\n  cited of frequent contagion of those attending or visiting typhus\r\n  patients. In 1909, Nicolle, in North Africa, demonstrated that the\r\n  disease was transmitted by lice and the recent experiences in the\r\n  Balkan war and in the Servian epidemic of 1915 show that in the\r\n  absence of such vermin the disease does not appear to be contagious.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—The disease has largely been\r\n  eradicated from European and other countries where hygienic\r\n  measures leading to the destruction of vermin have existed.\r\n\r\n  During the recent war the disease became one of importance, owing\r\n  to the difficulty of preventing the spread of body lice to the\r\n  soldiers.\r\n\r\n  In the tropics the disease, when present, is usually found in\r\n  regions of high altitude. In Mexico tabardillo, as typhus is there\r\n  designated, is a disease of the elevated regions. This is also true\r\n  of India.\r\n\r\n  Sporadic cases of typhus, known as Brill’s disease, have appeared\r\n  from time to time in New York.\r\n\r\n  During the great war typhus first appeared in Servia, thence\r\n  extending to Austria, Germany and Russia. Its nonappearance on the\r\n  Western battle line must be attributed to the active measures of\r\n  the Germans in attacking the lice problem. It is now widespread in\r\n  Russia and Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—Recent work by Anderson and Ricketts has shown that the\r\nblood of human cases is infective for monkeys. The virus does not\r\nseem to pass through a Berkefeld filter and the epidemiology points\r\nto the body louse as the sole transmitting agent. Nicolle reported\r\nthe filterability of the virus. More recently he has considered this\r\nfilterability as doubtful.\r\n\r\n  The guinea pig is susceptible to the virus as well as the monkey\r\n  but only shows temperature rise. Nicolle has shown that lice do not\r\n  become infective until about the tenth day after feeding on typhus\r\n  blood. The virus is found in the blood of man and in the spleen and\r\n  blood of monkeys and guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n  Plotz has isolated a Gram-positive pleomorphic bacillus from\r\n  the blood of typhus patients which has been named _B. typhi\r\n  exanthematici_. This organism is of historical interest only and\r\n  apparently has nothing to do with the causation of typhus fever.\r\n\r\n  Hort states that only blood recently taken from typhus patients\r\n  will cause the disease in monkeys while the same blood which\r\n  has been incubated several hours or days fails to produce the\r\n  disease. Others, as well as Hort, doubt the etiological relation\r\n  of the organism of Plotz to typhus fever or to the mild form of\r\n  the disease as seen in New York City and there known as Brill’s\r\n  disease. Tabardillo or Mexican typhus is the same as typhus.\r\n\r\nRocha-Lima insists upon the etiological importance of short oval\r\nbodies, often showing polar staining with Giemsa preparations, and\r\nfound in the epithelial cells of the alimentary tract of lice which\r\nhave fed on the blood of typhus patients.\r\n\r\n  Ricketts noted similar bodies in such lice. They differ from the\r\n  Plotz organism in that they are Gram-negative and apparently cannot\r\n  be cultivated. Lice feeding on blood other than that of typhus\r\n  patients fail to show these bodies and furthermore the blood of\r\n  typhus cases during the period of convalescence fails to infect\r\n  lice. When guinea pigs are inoculated with emulsions of lice\r\n  containing such bodies they show the temperature reaction of typhus\r\n  fever. Plotz states that his organism may be Gram-negative at first\r\n  and believes these organisms to be the same. Wolbach and Todd\r\n  take the view that the bodies described by Rocha-Lima and called\r\n  _Rickettsia prowazeki_ are the cause of typhus fever. Similar\r\n  bodies have been found in trench fever and even in certain normal\r\n  lice. These bodies, however, are extracellular and are more oval\r\n  and stain more intensely than the typhus bodies. These Rocha-Lima\r\n  bodies require a Romanowsky stain to bring them out. In man these\r\n  bodies are found in the endothelial cells of the small blood\r\n  vessels, occurring singly or in clumps. In the louse the epithelial\r\n  cells of the intestine may be found distended with masses of these\r\n  organisms.\r\n\r\n  It is not certain whether the virus is transmitted by the bite of\r\n  the louse or by inoculation of faeces. Monkeys and guinea pigs can\r\n  be infected by injection of emulsions made from infected lice.\r\n\r\n  Loewe and others have succeeded in cultivating the virus of typhus,\r\n  using deep tubes containing 10 cc. of a rich ascitic fluid and a\r\n  piece of sterile rabbit kidney. The medium was inoculated with 2\r\n  cc. of typhus blood, after which 0.3 cc. of a 20% dextrose solution\r\n  was added and the culture sealed with liquid petrolatum. Its\r\n  reaction was pH 7 to 7.4. Cultures were incubated at both room and\r\n  body temperature.\r\n\r\n  As proving the culturing of the virus, it was noted that 1 cc. of\r\n  a fourth-generation culture would infect a guinea pig. This would\r\n  represent 0.00000016 cc. of the original typhus blood. The bodies\r\n  cultivated differ in morphology from the bacillus of Plotz in\r\n  that they are even more minute, of slight hazy outline and do not\r\n  assume polymorphous involution forms. They vary also in cultural\r\n  characteristics. Concerning the question as to the identity of the\r\n  bodies with _Rickettsia prowazeki_, no definite decision is as yet\r\n  permissible, nor were the authors able to decide whether the bodies\r\n  are of bacterial or of protozoan nature.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—Until recently authorities stated that typhus fever\r\nwas the most contagious of all diseases. We now know that in the\r\nabsence of body or possibly head lice the disease is only slightly,\r\nif at all contagious.\r\n\r\n  At the same time recent experience has shown that it requires\r\n  the greatest care on the part of those having charge of louse\r\n  destruction to avoid being infected while attending to this duty.\r\n  The same is true of those examining patients with the disease prior\r\n  to the eradication of the body lice of the sick.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the life history of the body louse is necessary. The\r\nbody louse, _Pediculus vestimenti_, is slightly larger than the head\r\nlouse, _P. capitis_, and is the species concerned in the transmission\r\nof Indian and North African relapsing fevers as well as typhus fever,\r\nalthough it is probable that the head louse can also transmit these\r\ninfections.\r\n\r\n  While the head lice live among the hairs of the head and show\r\n  their presence chiefly by the appearance of their pear-shaped\r\n  eggs (nits) projecting from the hair shaft, the body lice attach\r\n  themselves to the under surface of the garments worn next the skin,\r\n  and holding fast to the undershirt, feed about twice daily on the\r\n  human host. They are but rarely found on the skin. The female body\r\n  louse is about ⅐ inch long and about 1/15 inch broad (3.5 mm. ×\r\n  1.5 mm.). The antennae are somewhat longer than those of the head\r\n  louse. Warburton found that the egg stage, in experiments, lasted\r\n  from eight to forty days, the larval stage about eleven days, and\r\n  that the male louse lived three weeks and the female four weeks.\r\n  Of course, under natural conditions these periods may not hold.\r\n  Development of the eggs takes place best at a temperature of 30°C.\r\n\r\n  Lice feed at once after being hatched and a young louse will die\r\n  unless it feeds within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n  Lice will leave their host only when he has fever or when he dies\r\n  but they may drop off a host or be brushed off. They are not apt to\r\n  be found in bedding.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nFraenkel, in 1914, first called attention to proliferative changes\r\nin the endothelium of the arterioles and arterial capillaries,\r\nfollowed by necrotic changes. These changes are chiefly manifest in\r\nthe vessels of the skin, central nervous system and myocardium. In\r\naddition to the proliferation of the endothelial cells we have a\r\nperivascular infiltration of small round cells. Kurt Nicol notes that\r\nthere is a combination of proliferative and inflammatory changes.\r\nThese are microscopical and there is absence of characteristic\r\nmacroscopic findings.\r\n\r\nThe petechiae are due to thrombosis of the smaller vessels\r\nand subsequent haemorrhagic manifestations. Bronchitis and\r\nbroncho-pneumonia are extremely frequent and form the most common\r\nfatal complication. The brain lesions are most common in the basal\r\nganglia, the cerebral cortex and the medulla.\r\n\r\nThe blood is dark-colored and the liver and kidneys show cloudy\r\nswelling. The spleen is somewhat enlarged during the early stages of\r\nthe disease but tends to be normal in size later on. It is very soft\r\nand may rupture while being handled at autopsy. There are no changes\r\nin the Peyer’s patches and the mesenteric glands are not enlarged,\r\nthus differentiating from typhoid fever. The heart muscle tends to\r\nshow degenerative changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation varies from five to fifteen days, usually,\r\nhowever, about twelve days. The period of onset may cover about\r\ntwo days, during which time the patient has headache, giddiness,\r\nbackache, anorexia, perhaps nausea, and general malaise. There may be\r\nrigors or chilly sensations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.—Female _Pediculus corporis._—(Schamberg\r\n_After Kuechenmeister_.)]\r\n\r\n  About the end of the second day the temperature rises fairly\r\n  rapidly to become 103° or 104°F. by the third or fourth day. With\r\n  the rise of fever the face becomes flushed, the eyes injected and\r\n  the expression apathetic. The headache is usually quite severe and\r\n  may be frontal, occipital or generalized. The temperature remains\r\n  elevated with slight morning remissions for from twelve to fourteen\r\n  days when it may fall by crisis or more gradually by rapid lysis.\r\n\r\nWell-marked prostration and cardiac weakness are early noted. There\r\nis a tendency to constipation and the mouth becomes foul and the\r\nteeth rapidly covered with sordes, unless the greatest precautions in\r\noral cleanliness are observed.\r\n\r\n  There is a marked tendency to clouding of the consciousness. At\r\n  times the disease shows an abrupt onset rather than that described\r\n  above.\r\n\r\nThe eruption first appears about the fifth day and shows as slightly\r\nelevated rose spots, which at first disappear on pressure, but\r\nquickly tend to become permanent and later purpuric. The eruption\r\nfirst appears in the flanks and then extends to the abdomen, chest\r\nand later to the extremities.\r\n\r\n  The term mulberry rash is sometimes used to describe the rash of\r\n  typhus. In addition to the above there is a subcuticular mottling.\r\n\r\nAlong with the appearance of the rash the symptoms become aggravated,\r\nthe effect on the heart is more marked and the pulse becomes feeble.\r\nThe face is often dusky. There may be a bronchial catarrh with an\r\nannoying cough.\r\n\r\n  By the end of the first week the delirious or stuporous condition\r\n  becomes more marked with a tendency to muttering delirium, tremors\r\n  and subsultus, the coma-vigil of the older writers. Terrifying\r\n  hallucinations may cause the patient to jump from the window and\r\n  kill himself. There is a tendency to parotitis and otitis media\r\n  connected with the mouth condition. On account of the circulatory\r\n  weakness there is a tendency to gangrene of the extremities,\r\n  especially the toes, rarely the fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.—Temperature chart of typhus fever. (Pepper,\r\nAmerican Text-book of Medicine.)]\r\n\r\nIn cases which recover there is a critical change in the apparently\r\ndesperate condition of the patient about the end of the second week,\r\nthe sudden striking change for the better being more marked in typhus\r\nfever than in any other disease. At this time the urine changes from\r\na high-colored, often albuminous one, to an abundant secretion of\r\nmore or less normal character.\r\n\r\n  The sporadic mild cases of typhus, which occurred from time to\r\n  time over a period of years in New York, were known as _Brill’s\r\n  disease_. According to Brill these cases showed intense headache,\r\n  apathy and prostration, with a continuous fever, maculo-papular\r\n  eruption and a rapid lysis or critical fall of temperature at the\r\n  end of about fourteen days. The spots only rarely became purpuric.\r\n  There was almost never marked delirium and the mortality was less\r\n  than 2%.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptoms in Detail\r\n\r\n  _The Eruption._—This first appears about the fourth day as macules\r\n  about loins, then spreading over abdomen, chest and back. It is\r\n  often more pronounced on the back than elsewhere. It almost never\r\n  appears on the face but may occur on the palms and soles. It has\r\n  a resemblance to the rash of measles. At first disappearing on\r\n  pressure it soon becomes permanent and then petechial. The livid\r\n  color of the rash has brought about the designation “mulberry\r\n  rash.” The rash lasts from a few days to two weeks.\r\n\r\n  _The Fever._—The fever rise following a chill is much more rapid\r\n  than in typhoid fever, reaching its fastigium in about three days.\r\n  A more or less continuous range of fever (103° to 104°F.) follows\r\n  until about the fourteenth day, when there is often a rapid lysis\r\n  or possibly crisis, at which time the patient tends to fall into a\r\n  refreshing sleep and to show a rather marked diuresis.\r\n\r\n  _The Alimentary Tract._—Constipation is usually noted. Very marked\r\n  is the tendency of the mouth and tongue to become dry and sordes\r\n  to collect on the teeth. The dry black tongue has led to the\r\n  designation “parrot tongue.” It is difficult to get the patient to\r\n  protrude his tongue when told to do so.\r\n\r\n  _The Circulatory System._—Very outspoken is cardiac weakness due\r\n  to myocardial degeneration. The heart sounds are very weak and\r\n  the pulse feeble. The blood pressure is very low, especially the\r\n  diastolic. Bradycardia may be marked during convalescence.\r\n\r\n  _The Respiratory System._—Cough may appear in the first days, but\r\n  usually is first troublesome about the time of the eruption. By the\r\n  end of a week the cough becomes loose and râles of various types\r\n  may be noted. Death often occurs from a terminal broncho-pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  _The Nervous System._—Clouding of the consciousness is as marked\r\n  in this disease as in plague. Dull aching frontal headache is\r\n  marked and a dull stuporous state soon comes on. Delirium is marked\r\n  in some cases. As in plague there are often the facies and mental\r\n  state of alcoholic intoxication.\r\n\r\n  _The Blood._—There does not seem to be anything very\r\n  characteristic in the blood examination. Prowazek noted that the\r\n  polymorphonuclears showed early fragmentation of the nucleus\r\n  and that the cytoplasm stained very red with Giemsa’s stain.\r\n  Robinowitsch noted that the leucocyte count fell in the first\r\n  day or two, then gradually rose until the crisis and then again\r\n  fell. The leucocytosis is only moderate, about 10,000, and the\r\n  polymorphonuclears make up about 80 to 85%. Eosinophiles are\r\n  decreased. Other observers have noted an increase in the large\r\n  mononuclears.\r\n\r\n  _Complications._—A bronchitis is very common and later on there\r\n  may be such a profuse expectoration that the patient cannot get rid\r\n  of it and may become cyanotic. Broncho-pneumonia is a very frequent\r\n  cause of death. Otitis media and parotitis are not infrequent\r\n  complications. Deafness is often marked.\r\n\r\n  Thrombosis of various vessels may be noted.\r\n\r\n  Gangrene of the extremities, especially the toes, is frequently\r\n  present. Gangrene of areas subjected to pressure, as over the\r\n  sacrum, is not infrequent. There does not seem to be the same\r\n  tendency to gangrene of the genitalia as in spotted fever of the\r\n  Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThe more gradual course of the fever and the less marked stuporous\r\ncondition, together with positive blood cultures, should\r\ndifferentiate typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n  Plague has the same picture of alcoholic intoxication as typhus,\r\n  but is without the rash. Influenza, with its acute onset, is\r\n  confusing but does not show any increase in leucocytes.\r\n\r\nOther than a moderate leucocytosis and marked acid staining of\r\nthe polymorphonuclears there is not much that is of help from the\r\nlaboratory. When guinea pigs are inoculated with typhus virus the\r\nperiod of incubation is from 7 to 10 days.\r\n\r\n_Weil-Felix Reaction._—In the diagnosis of typhus fever we attach\r\ngreat importance to an agglutination reaction (Weil-Felix reaction)\r\nwhich the serum of typhus patients has upon certain organisms\r\ndesignated as X_{2} and X_{19}. These correspond in characteristics\r\nto certain strains of _Proteus vulgaris_, producing indol in peptone\r\nsolution, and acid and gas in glucose, maltose and saccharose, but\r\nnot in lactose or mannite. They digest gelatine and blood serum\r\nsomewhat more slowly than typical cultures of _Proteus vulgaris_.\r\n\r\nAlthough these organisms have been isolated from the urine of several\r\ntyphus cases, it seems certain that these X bacilli are neither\r\ncausative organisms nor secondary invaders. The reaction is therefore\r\nheterologous and not specific.\r\n\r\nThe reaction appears during the first week of the disease but becomes\r\nquite marked in the second week and during convalescence. Thus a\r\ntitre of 1 to 25 on the fifth day usually rises to 1 to 200 or higher\r\nby the end of the second week. The test is made either with living\r\nor dead cultures and is carried out as for typhoid agglutinations,\r\npreferably by the macroscopic method.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nOld people are apt to succumb, as do also those who show marked\r\ndelirium. In childhood it is a very mild disease.\r\n\r\n  An increase of eosinophiles is favorable while an absence of these\r\n  cells makes for a grave prognosis.\r\n\r\nThe death rate runs from 15 to 60% in many epidemics while Brill’s\r\ndisease only gives 1 or 2% of deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS.—This consists almost exclusively in the destruction of\r\nbody lice, or preventing their access to the person.\r\n\r\n  Those attending cases should wear gowns, closely fitting at\r\n  neck and wrists, and rubber gloves. Better than a gown would be\r\n  “unionalls,” with stocking extremities to go over the shoes. The\r\n  typhus case should be deloused with the greatest thoroughness, and\r\n  his clothing sterilized.\r\n\r\n  For ridding the body of lice, the following steps are essential:\r\n\r\n  1. The hair of the body and head should be clipped.\r\n\r\n  2. The subject should be bathed, there being used freely\r\n  kerosene-emulsion soap, prepared by boiling 1 part of soap in\r\n  4 parts of water, and then adding 2 parts of kerosene oil. The\r\n  resultant jelly, when mixed with 4 parts of water, makes a liquid\r\n  soap that is convenient to use and which may be applied effectively.\r\n\r\n  3. Following the bath, the body may be anointed with kerosene,\r\n  special care being devoted to the hairy parts. Skin irritation may,\r\n  however, require early removal of the oil.\r\n\r\n  4. It has been found that lice on clothing removed from the\r\n  body may remain alive nine days and their eggs as long as forty\r\n  days. The clothing therefore should be disinfected by one of the\r\n  following methods:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Steam; (_b_) boiling for five minutes; (_c_) 5% compound\r\n  cresol solution for 30 minutes; (_d_) chemicals such as cyanide or\r\n  chlorpicrin.\r\n\r\n  5. In the absence of facilities for carrying out the steps\r\n  described, or to prevent infestation subsequently, dusting powders\r\n  are sometimes used. Of these the N.C.I. powder, containing\r\n  commercial naphthalene, 96 Gms., creosote, 2 cc., and iodoform, 2\r\n  Gms., is the most widely known; but Moore’s powder—creosote, 1\r\n  cc.; sulphur, 0.5 Gm., and talc, 20 Gms.—is less irritating and\r\n  is said to be six times as effective. It has also been recommended\r\n  to wring out the underclothes in 5% compound cresol solution, then\r\n  drying thoroughly, or to impregnate them with substances such as\r\n  the halogenated phenols.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—There is no disease in which careful nursing is so\r\nimportant. This applies especially to the care of the mouth. It is\r\nvery necessary to maintain the recumbent position.\r\n\r\n  A mouth wash of equal parts of boric acid solution, glycerine and\r\n  lemon juice should be used to swab out the mouth several times\r\n  daily. Constipation should be controlled by enemata.\r\n\r\n  It is best to give the patient abundance of fresh air so that tent\r\n  treatment is to be recommended. Cool sponging lessens the nervous\r\n  manifestations as well as lowering temperature. Ice bags to the\r\n  head relieve the headache. Cardiac stimulants are indicated, as\r\n  caffein and camphor. Thyroid extract has been recommended. Lumbar\r\n  puncture has given amelioration of symptoms. Abundance of water\r\n  should be given and the diet should be milk and broths.\r\n\r\n  The virus of typhus is present in all the organs of an infected\r\n  guinea pig and Nicolle has prepared a serum by injecting horses\r\n  with emulsions of spleen and adrenals of such animals. The serum\r\n  has apparently given good results in human beings when employed\r\n  early in the disease, the temperature falling with each injection.\r\n  The dosage was about 20 cc. daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nTRENCH FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND SYNONYMS\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Trench fever is a specific, acute infectious disease,\r\nprobably caused by _Rickettsia quintana_, acquired usually through\r\nthe agency of the body louse, characterized by an abrupt onset, a\r\nfebrile period of about five days often followed by one or more\r\nrelapses, and ending in complete recovery.\r\n\r\nTrench fever was one of the most widespread diseases occurring in\r\nthe forces of the World War. It is transmitted by contamination of a\r\nskin abrasion or of a louse-bite wound with the faeces of an infected\r\nlouse, although Strong and his colleagues reported the bite of an\r\ninfected louse as a demonstrated method of infection.\r\n\r\nClinically, it shows an abrupt onset, with fever, headache, pain\r\non moving the eyeballs, soreness of the muscles of the legs and\r\nfrequently hyperaesthesia of the shins. As a rule the initial fever\r\nis followed after a few days by a single short rise but there may be\r\na fever course of many relapses with apyretic intervals. Recovery is\r\ncomplete, death practically never occurring; but convalescence may be\r\nprotracted, and incapacitating after-effects, such as neurasthenia,\r\ncardiac disturbances and myalgia, may be noted.\r\n\r\n=Synonyms.=—Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (P. U. O.), Meuse fever,\r\nVolhynian fever, Shin fever, Quintan or five-day fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n  =History.=—It is remarkable that so striking and communicable a\r\n  disease as trench fever should have been an unrecognized entity\r\n  prior to the recent war. While resembling dengue in some respects,\r\n  and relapsing fever in others, as well as various well-recognized\r\n  exotic fevers, there is no satisfactory account of the prior\r\n  existence of such a type of fever. Werner was of the opinion that a\r\n  quintan fever of the Middle Ages might have been trench fever, and\r\n  it has been suggested that a quintan fever described by Hippocrates\r\n  may have been of this nature, but the evidence is not convincing.\r\n  Some have thought that the miliary fever reported in France from\r\n  1821 to 1855 might have been a type of trench fever since it had no\r\n  mortality.\r\n\r\n  =Geographical Distribution.=—During the war, trench fever was\r\n  reported not only in Flanders, but also among the troops fighting\r\n  in Macedonia and Mesopotamia, and in the forces of the Central\r\n  Powers on the German and Austrian fronts. It is remarkable that\r\n  since the war this louse-borne disease seems to have disappeared,\r\n  although other diseases transmitted by lice, as typhus fever and\r\n  relapsing fever, continue to occur widely in Poland, Russia and the\r\n  Balkans.\r\n\r\n\r\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\r\n\r\n=Etiology.=—It now seems rather definitely settled that trench\r\nfever belongs to the group of diseases caused by Rickettsia bodies,\r\nand this species has been named _Rickettsia quintana_. Like the\r\nother organisms of the group, these bodies are very small (0.3 to\r\n0.5 by 1.5 to 2 microns), Gram-negative, nonmotile and stain best\r\nby Giemsa’s method. As these bodies with their coccal or bipolar\r\nstaining characteristics, when observed in the eggs of ticks\r\ninfected with the virus of spotted fever of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nshowed the so-called chromatin staining, Ricketts regarded them as\r\nchromatin-staining bacteria. Since, however, they are transmitted by\r\nan arthropodan host, we believe now that they are probably protozoal\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\n  Bradford and his colleagues stated that they were able to culture\r\n  these organisms by Noguchi’s method for culturing the organism of\r\n  syphilis, but Strong failed to obtain growth. As the organism of\r\n  typhus fever has recently been cultured by the same method, it\r\n  would appear that the trench fever organism also is cultivable.\r\n  The virus is present in the whole blood, in the plasma and in\r\n  the washed erythrocytes; it is nonfilterable, and withstands a\r\n  temperature of 56°C. for 20 minutes but not one of 80°C. for 10\r\n  minutes. These organisms in the alimentary tract of the louse are\r\n  extracellular, and not contained within the cells of the epithelium\r\n  of the gut of the louse. The trench fever bodies differ from those\r\n  of typhus in that they are plumper and stain more deeply with\r\n  ordinary aniline dyes.\r\n\r\n=Epidemiology.=—The ordinary method of transmission is by the agency\r\nof infected lice, but the disease can be produced artificially by\r\nthe injection of the blood of an infected person. It is probable\r\nthat urine also may be a factor in transmission, as Strong brought\r\nabout infection by smearing skin abrasions with urinary sediment from\r\ntrench fever cases.\r\n\r\n  It is now considered that the bite of the louse is noninfectious,\r\n  although Strong succeeded in transmitting the disease by this\r\n  means in five cases. The accepted explanation of the mechanism\r\n  of infection is that it takes place through contamination of an\r\n  abrasion or wound of the skin with louse faeces or with the juices\r\n  from the crushed bodies of infected lice. In this connection,\r\n  excoriations of the skin resulting from the scratching of\r\n  scabies-infested areas makes a scabies patient peculiarly liable\r\n  to trench fever infection. The louse faeces become infective only\r\n  after seven days from the time of feeding on trench fever cases,\r\n  this fact indicating a developmental cycle in the louse.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nAs the disease of itself is never fatal, there have been no\r\nopportunities for studying the pathological changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is usually given as from two to three\r\nweeks. In the experimentally produced cases of the American Red\r\nCross Commission, the incubation period varied from five to thirty\r\ndays; thus with intravenous injection of blood it varied from five\r\nto twenty days, and with inoculation of scarified areas with louse\r\nfaeces the period was between seven and eleven days.\r\n\r\nThe onset is quite abrupt with headache, dizziness and pain on motion\r\nof the eyeballs. There is pain also in the back and limbs. The\r\nconjunctivae are injected. The fever rises rapidly to 102°-104°F. and\r\nfalls rather abruptly to normal at about the fourth day. In most of\r\nthe cases a secondary rise occurs so that we may have a saddle-back\r\ntype of temperature chart.\r\n\r\n  The temperature charts tend to be grouped in three classes: (1)\r\n  Those with a short febrile course of a few days, followed by a\r\n  fall to normal, with or without a subsequent rise; (2) those with\r\n  a more or less sustained type of fever, extending over five or six\r\n  weeks without distinct relapses, and (3) those more typically of a\r\n  relapsing type, with five or six distinct febrile periods.\r\n\r\n  In more than one-half of the cases there occurs an eruption\r\n  of small (2 to 4 mm.) erythematous spots, which disappear on\r\n  pressure. They are usually located on chest, back or abdomen,\r\n  appear on the second day of the fever, and fade out by the fourth\r\n  day. Constipation and anorexia are usually noted. The spleen is\r\n  often somewhat enlarged. There is frequently a trace of albumin\r\n  in the urine, but it is not accompanied by casts. The cutaneous\r\n  hyperaesthesia over the shins is a prominent feature, but the same\r\n  disturbance of sensation may be complained of over the ulna or\r\n  fibula. Usually we find a leucocytosis but many cases show a normal\r\n  white count or even a slight leukopenia. During the apyrexia there\r\n  is an increase in mononuclear percentage. The pulse is rather slow\r\n  for the temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the intensive study given this disease during the\r\nwar, we do not seem to have any constant or reliable laboratory test.\r\n\r\nIn some of the cases where muscle pains of the neck are marked there\r\nmay be a stiffness of the neck that is suggestive of cerebro-spinal\r\nfever. Similarly, pain of the abdominal muscles may cause a suspicion\r\nof appendicitis and lead to an unnecessary operation.\r\n\r\n  The onset of trench fever is very like that of dengue or influenza.\r\n\r\n  In epidemic jaundice, the occurrence of the jaundice and marked\r\n  albuminuria should differentiate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS\r\n\r\nThis is most favorable as to ultimate complete recovery, but some\r\ncases show a prolonged convalescence with manifestations of irritable\r\nheart or neurasthenia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT\r\n\r\nProphylaxis consists in attacking the louse problem, although\r\nattention should be given to the disinfection of the urine.\r\n\r\nAcetylsalicylic acid may be given to relieve the headache and the\r\nmuscle pains; and some laxative for the usual constipation. There is\r\nno specific treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nHEAT STROKE AND HEAT PROSTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to differentiate etiologically, as well as\r\nclinically, the two most common manifestations of the effects of\r\nhigh temperature. Clinically we note cases (1) with a rapidly rising\r\ntemperature, which often reaches a very high point, together with a\r\nhot, dry, reddened skin, heat stroke; and again we note cases (2)\r\nwith pale clammy skin, marked evidences of cardiac weakness and a\r\nnormal or subnormal temperature, heat prostration.\r\n\r\n  Brooks in a most excellent discussion of the subject applies the\r\n  designation diathermasia to the former group of cases and regards\r\n  them as connected with an undue retention of heat within the body.\r\n  To the latter group, which he considers to be connected with\r\n  exposure to the actinic rays of the sun, he applies the designation\r\n  phoebism.\r\n\r\n  In diathermasia he considers that we have so great a strain on\r\n  the thermotaxic mechanism that there is loss of balance between\r\n  the heat discharge and heat producing centers, while in phoebism\r\n  there is primarily an acute cerebral or cerebro-spinal congestion\r\n  followed by a chronic inflammatory condition of the meninges and\r\n  due to damage from the actinic or ultra-violet rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhile admitting that there may be cases where the effects of\r\ncertain rays of the sun are responsible for clinical manifestations\r\nvarying from death of striking suddenness to vague complaints of\r\nirritability, headache and defective memory, yet the generally\r\naccepted views are that high temperature, high relative humidity and\r\nlack of evaporation from the skin, whether from excessive humidity or\r\nfrom lack of circulation of the surrounding air, can and do produce\r\nat one time heat stroke and at another heat prostration. Such factors\r\nas muscular exertion, disease conditions, alcoholism and dietary\r\nindiscretions undoubtedly play a part in the production of and\r\nvariance in the clinical manifestations brought about by the effects\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\n  Sambon has suggested that there is a possibility that heat stroke\r\n  or, as it is also designated thermic fever or siriasis, is due to\r\n  a germ infection, but without advancing any particular evidence in\r\n  favor of such an hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly, however, much in favor of the views of\r\nthose who regard heat stroke and heat prostration as due to an\r\nauto-intoxication from the accumulation of toxic substances resulting\r\nfrom increased metabolic activity due to excessive heat retention and\r\nhaving a selective action on the nerve cells.\r\n\r\n  Others think that as the result of more active metabolism there\r\n  is a retention of carbonic and lactic acid with a demand on the\r\n  alkali content of the blood resulting in an acidosis. As a matter\r\n  of fact treatment of heat stroke cases with intravenous or rectal\r\n  injections of sodium bicarbonate seems to be of marked value.\r\n\r\nIt would seem advisable to take the ground that heat retention\r\nresulting from lack of heat radiation and insufficient skin\r\nevaporation causes various manifestations of discomfort or bodily\r\ninjury. Aron in Manila showed that monkeys exposed to the sun died\r\nin about one hour but that a control monkey, similarly placed, but\r\nkept in a current of air from an electric fan, suffered little or no\r\ninjury. The reason that monkey and man react differently to exposure\r\nto the sun is on account of the more numerous and more active sweat\r\nglands possessed by man which give rise to increased evaporation and\r\nresulting loss of heat of the body.\r\n\r\n  High relative humidity is a potent factor in checking evaporation.\r\n  The rectal temperature in Haldane’s experiments showed a rise of a\r\n  little over 1°F. when the wet bulb was at 90°F., 2°F. when at 94°F.\r\n  while at 98°F. it was about 4°F. per hour. Leonard Hill has noted\r\n  that the air surrounding the victims of the Black Hole of Calcutta\r\n  became saturated with water vapour and heated to the temperature\r\n  of the body so that it was heat stroke and not suffocation that\r\n  caused death. The power of air to hold water vapour and its\r\n  evaporative power increase rapidly with rising temperature; thus\r\n  at 50°F. a cubic foot of air holds 4.08 grains water, at 80°F.\r\n  10.9 and at 100°F. 19.7 grains. Hill states that the limit of an\r\n  Englishman’s power to keep cool is passed when the wet bulb exceeds\r\n  88°F. in the still air of a room even when stripped to the waist\r\n  and resting. If muscular work is performed the limit may be 80°F.\r\n  Walking in a tropical climate, wet bulb 75° to 80°F., dry bulb\r\n  80° to 90°F. may raise the temperature 2° to 3°F. and send the\r\n  pulse up to 140 to 160. All the students of ventilation stress\r\n  the importance of circulation of the air in promoting evaporation\r\n  and comfort. According to Hill with the air saturated and the wet\r\n  bulb reading 89°F. the wet ‘Kata’ readings would be 3.3 with still\r\n  air, 8.0 with the wind moving 1 meter a second and 15.1 with a\r\n  velocity of 9 meters per second. In tropical parts of the world\r\n  when the wet bulb not infrequently reaches 90°F. the circulation\r\n  of air by punkahs or electric fans becomes a necessity. There\r\n  is great variation in capacity for sweating which, according to\r\n  Hearne, is the basis of heat stroke. He notes that sweating is\r\n  suppressed from 1 to 48 hours before the attack. With sweating\r\n  suppressed the body temperature rises until, when 108°F. or more\r\n  is reached, unconsciousness and convulsions develop. Hearne thinks\r\n  that the inhibition of sweating is local in the sweat glands, and\r\n  not central, as diaphoretics fail to cause sweating once it has\r\n  stopped. As a practical point Hearne watched subjects for dryness\r\n  of the skin and when discovered they were stripped, covered with\r\n  a wet sheet and evaporation promoted by a current of air from an\r\n  electric fan. Doctor Leonard Hill has noted the inefficiency of the\r\n  application of pieces of ice to the hyperpyrexial body as compared\r\n  with evaporation. Thus water evaporation at body temperature\r\n  abstracts 0.59 calories per gram while melting ice only takes away\r\n  0.08 calories. Furthermore the application of ice constricts the\r\n  capillaries and interferes with evaporation. He also notes that 70\r\n  grams of water evaporated from the skin takes away as much heat as\r\n  1000 grams of ice water used as an enema.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nPathologically, there is usually congestion of the\r\nbrain and meninges, that of the brain being particularly marked about\r\nthe region of the medulla. There may even be punctate haemorrhages\r\nand the nerve cells show chromatolysis. These changes are much more\r\nevident in heat stroke than in heat prostration.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie and LeCount have noted the following autopsy findings:\r\nGeneralized passive hyperaemia of brain and lungs, oedema of brain\r\nand lungs as well as petechial haemorrhages of various mucous\r\nmembranes and the skin.\r\n\r\n  _Susceptibility to Heat Stroke._—As a matter of fact in a body of\r\n  men exposed to identical conditions of heat of sun and relative\r\n  humidity we note certain cases exhibiting typical heat stroke while\r\n  other men will only show evidences of heat prostration.\r\n\r\n  Alcoholism, obesity, diseases of heart and lungs, overcrowding,\r\n  muscular fatigue, insufficient circulation of air, with the wet\r\n  bulb about 90°F., and not drinking a sufficient amount of water,\r\n  predispose to heat injury.\r\n\r\n  It must always be kept in mind that the hyperpyrexial type of\r\n  malignant tertian malaria may give a clinical picture of heat\r\n  stroke.\r\n\r\n  Fiske has noted that in oil-burning firerooms, even with a\r\n  temperature of 140°F., 10° higher than on similar ships burning\r\n  coal, there were no cases of heat prostration. He attributes this\r\n  to the less fatiguing work in tending oil-burning furnaces and the\r\n  smaller number of men required, this reducing overcrowding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY\r\n\r\n_In heat stroke_ there are usually prodromata of dizziness, dry\r\nskin, headache, and somnolence, following which the body temperature\r\nshoots up to 105°F. or even above 110°F. There is a desire for\r\nfrequent micturition, which may be considered as a prodromal warning\r\nof embarrassment of the sweating function. The skin is hot and dry\r\nand the pupils may be contracted. The pulse which is at first full\r\nand rapid, soon becomes irregular. There may be delirium or coma or\r\nconvulsive seizures. The patient is unconscious with irregular or\r\nCheyne-Stokes respiration.\r\n\r\n  Hiller divides these cases into (1) those showing an asphyxia\r\n  syndrome, as characterized by cyanosis and collapse, with cessation\r\n  of respiration and enfeebled circulation. Prolonged artificial\r\n  respiration is required in such cases. (2) A paralytic type\r\n  with deep coma, recurring convulsions and extreme hyperpyrexia.\r\n  These cases exhibit oedema of lungs and brain and necessitate\r\n  venesection. (3) A psychopathic type in which there is delirium\r\n  often of a violent type with delusions of persecution. Such cases\r\n  often commit suicide.\r\n\r\nIn _heat prostration_ we have giddiness and possibly nausea with pale\r\nface, often bathed in cold perspiration and dilated pupils. The pulse\r\nis very weak and syncope may ensue. The temperature is not elevated\r\nand may be subnormal. Rarely the temperature is slightly elevated.\r\nThe respiration is shallow and sighing. Headache is often complained\r\nof after recovery. Following this or the more dangerous heat stroke\r\nwe may have lack of mental concentration or loss of memory with\r\nrecurring headache upon even moderate exposure to the sun.\r\n\r\n_Heat Cramps._—Among those working in firerooms on board ships\r\ncruising in tropical waters, there is met frequently a condition\r\ncharacterized by cramps of the voluntary muscles, chiefly those of\r\nthe extremities and abdomen.\r\n\r\n  Ill health and individual susceptibility appear to predispose\r\n  toward attacks, but apparently hard physical labor, in conjunction\r\n  with the environmental conditions, is the factor that determines\r\n  the occurrence of the cramps. Their causation is usually attributed\r\n  to dehydration of the tissues, or to accumulation of metabolic\r\n  products, but some believe that they represent a condition\r\n  differing from all other conditions recognized as being due to\r\n  heat. Cases, probably identical in nature and having the same\r\n  causative factors, have been noted as occurring among workers in\r\n  steel-mills.\r\n\r\n  The cramps are usually preceded by fibrillation of the muscles\r\n  later to be affected. When frankly spastic attacks are developed,\r\n  they recur at intervals of from 2 to 10 minutes, and may be severe\r\n  and very painful. The pupil is dilated, but so far as known, no\r\n  other organs are involved. The cramps are commonly accompanied by\r\n  signs of heat prostration. This, however, is not necessarily so,\r\n  there often being absolutely no thermal disturbance.\r\n\r\n  The treatment is in general that of heat prostration. Immediate\r\n  relief may be obtained by sudden slapping of an affected muscle.\r\n  For mild cases, immersion in a warm bath is recommended.\r\n  Apomorphine in sub-emetic doses is said to confer immediate\r\n  relaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT\r\n\r\nWith heat stroke we have a condition in which every moment lost\r\nbefore the institution of proper treatment reduces the chances of\r\nrecovery. The two important measures are reduction of temperature\r\nand elimination of toxic material. For the former ice packs or ice\r\nbaths are the most efficient. When the temperature starts down it\r\nmay fall with great rapidity and collapse result. Consequently when\r\ngiving these ice packs or baths the treatment should be discontinued\r\nwhen the temperature by rectum reaches about 103°F., the patient\r\nthen being removed from the bath and covered with a blanket. If the\r\ntemperature again shoots up the ice bath can be repeated. Many have\r\nreported great benefit from the use of enemata cooled with ice. Some\r\nprefer to apply ice to the head and rub the body with pieces of ice.\r\nThis can be carried out on a rubber sheet placed on a cot. If there\r\nis no ice available a sheet wet in dilute alcohol, plus the effects\r\nof a current of air from the electric fan or otherwise, may be tried.\r\nIn a case with marked cyanosis venesection may be necessary. In\r\nasphyxial types of sun stroke prolonged artificial respiration is\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nAbove has been noted the inefficiency of ice in reducing temperature\r\nand the far greater effect from evaporation, brought about by\r\ndirecting the current from a fan on the body covered with a wet sheet.\r\n\r\n  To promote elimination of toxic products venesection plus the use\r\n  of intravenous injections of normal saline is the best treatment.\r\n  In those terrible paralytic type cases which show a mortality of\r\n  more than 50% it is well to think of acidosis and give slowly about\r\n  a liter of a 1 or 2% solution of sodium bicarbonate. (See under\r\n  treatment of cholera.) The use of alkaline enemata often gives\r\n  good results, about a liter of a solution containing 2% of sodium\r\n  chloride and 2% of sodium carbonate or bicarbonate.\r\n\r\n  As soon as possible after the more urgent hydrotherapeutic\r\n  methods have controlled the case we should give calomel followed\r\n  by salines. The coal tar products should be avoided as far as\r\n  possible, from the danger of cardiac depression.\r\n\r\nIn the nonfebrile heat prostration the treatment is entirely\r\neliminative and stimulant. The patient should be placed on his back\r\nin a cool shady place and tight clothing released, particularly about\r\nthe neck. Rubbing the limbs as for any syncope-type affection, with\r\nhot water bottles if the collapse is marked, should be one line of\r\ntreatment. Many give a little aromatic spirits of ammonia or whiskey\r\nbut a hypodermic of strychnine would be better in a severe case.\r\n\r\n  Calomel and salines should be given after cardiac weakness\r\n  disappears. To avoid these dangers of the tropical heat one should\r\n  keep the body clean to promote good action of the sweat glands. The\r\n  clothing should be light and loosely fitting and should permit a\r\n  free circulation of air to assist evaporation. There does not seem\r\n  to be any indication for the wearing of orange-colored clothes as\r\n  the actinic rays are apparently unimportant. Puntoni recommends\r\n  green-colored clothing for neck and spine. The green cloth should\r\n  be covered with white material.\r\n\r\n  The head and nape of the neck should be protected by a light\r\n  well-ventilated helmet. Alcohol should be avoided, or at any rate\r\n  absolutely so, until evening. Water or lemonade should be taken\r\n  freely and a siesta in the middle of the day is an important\r\n  conserver of one’s resisting powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nCLIMATIC BUBO, AINHUM, GOUNDOU, JUXTA-ARTICULAR NODULES AND VISCERAL\r\nMYCOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATIC BUBO\r\n\r\nGeneral Considerations\r\n\r\nThe naval surgeons of various countries have for many years been\r\ninterested in a condition where inguinal buboes develop which have no\r\nrelation to venereal infection.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to find any organism in these lesions have so far\r\nfailed. Cultures from excised glands or from the necrotic centers of\r\nsuch glands fail to show any growth.\r\n\r\n  Stained smears and India ink preparations alike fail to show any\r\n  causative organism. The Wassermann test is also negative. The\r\n  disease seems much more common in the West Indies than elsewhere,\r\n  statistics showing it to be about 10 times as often contracted by\r\n  sailors in those waters as by crews in the seaports of China. In\r\n  a recent article Rost states that he thinks there is evidence to\r\n  show that the disease is contracted by sexual intercourse with\r\n  prostitutes of the colored races. Of his 17 cases all had exposed\r\n  themselves in this way.\r\n\r\n  Children never show climatic bubo and it seems peculiarly to\r\n  affect the young adults composing the crews of ships. Even among\r\n  the native prostitutes such a condition does not seem to exist and\r\n  climatic bubo does not affect the male natives.\r\n\r\nThere may or may not be a periadenitis but there is thickening of\r\nthe capsule and fibrous septa of the glands. At times an apparently\r\nhealthy gland may show a necrotic centre, the contents of which,\r\nhowever, will be found to be sterile. One often notes in sections\r\nhaemorrhagic infiltrations and oedema in the region of the peripheral\r\nlymph sinuses. A point of differentiation from ambulant plague\r\nbuboes is the great increase in plasma cells in climatic bubo. It\r\nwill be remembered that Cantlie suggested that climatic bubo was an\r\nattenuated plague but this idea has never been accepted. It has been\r\nsuggested that malaria might cause climatic bubo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptomatology\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation is a rather long one, Rost in a\r\nwell-controlled case noting a period of at least five weeks. The\r\nonset is very gradual, so the first intimation of a swelling in the\r\ngroins may be when a sense of heaviness is noted in that region after\r\nprolonged work. For this reason they have been called “fatigue”\r\nglands.\r\n\r\n  The glands of one side of the groin are usually involved although\r\n  the swellings may affect both sides. The deep iliac glands also\r\n  often show marked increase in size but the glands of the other\r\n  parts of the body, as axillary or cervical, are practically never\r\n  involved.\r\n\r\nThe swollen glands are only slightly tender and at first are discrete\r\nand not attached to skin or underlying tissues. Later on with the\r\ndevelopment of a periadenitis they may be firmly attached. In size\r\nthey are usually as large as a hen’s egg but may become much larger.\r\n\r\n  The overlying skin is as a rule normal and one may at times palpate\r\n  a soft center in an otherwise hard gland. Fever tends to come\r\n  on as an irregular remittent type and I have seen cases showing\r\n  temperature curves covering periods of two or three months which\r\n  were not unlike those of Malta fever. With increase in size of the\r\n  buboes there would be a two or three weeks’ rise to be followed,\r\n  with the subsidence of the swelling, by lysis and later on to be\r\n  renewed with reappearance of the bubo.\r\n\r\nClimatic bubo runs a protracted course and does not respond at all\r\nwell to treatment. The cases often develop a moderate secondary\r\nanaemia, which is most often noted in the relapse cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosis and Treatment\r\n\r\nThe history aids in differentiating gonorrhoeal, chancroidal and\r\nsyphilitic buboes. There is not the hardness and marked absence of\r\ntenderness we get in syphilitic inguinal glands, and the reddened\r\noverlying skin of the other veneral buboes should differentiate.\r\n\r\n  Plague buboes are exquisitely tender and the patient usually\r\n  manifests signs of extreme illness. In climatic bubo the patients\r\n  rarely seem sick.\r\n\r\n  Surgical treatment is usually recommended and some advocate a\r\n  radical enucleation of all glands in the region involved as we\r\n  find at times apparently normal glands to show necrotic centers.\r\n  My objection to enucleation is that the deep iliac glands are also\r\n  often involved and it is not only impossible to remove all affected\r\n  glands in such an inaccessible region but the surgical risks of\r\n  wounding the deep veins are great. I have seen this accident\r\n  occur more than once. Again the radical removal of all glandular\r\n  structures in the groins, with subsequent scar tissue formation,\r\n  obstructs lymph return so that elephantoid conditions result.\r\n\r\n  Rest in bed and hot compresses are of value when periadenitis\r\n  sets in. When softening occurs the aspiration of the pus with an\r\n  aspirating syringe and the subsequent injection of glycerite of\r\n  boroglycerine containing 10% of iodoform are to be recommended.\r\n  Some apply ointment of ichthyol, others pressure by shot bags.\r\n  X-ray treatment has been recommended.\r\n\r\n  Emily strongly recommends the injection of 3 or 4 drops of iodoform\r\n  ether (5%) into the center of the enlarged gland. This effects a\r\n  rapid cure. The author also employs other measures such as rest in\r\n  bed, wet compresses, and light mercurial ointment inunctions over\r\n  the bubo at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nAINHUM\r\n\r\nGeneral Considerations\r\n\r\nThis disease, equivalent clinically to a spontaneous amputation of\r\nthe little toe, has been chiefly noted in the natives of the West\r\nCoast of Africa, especially among the Kroomen and in Brazil. Cases\r\nhave been reported from the West Indies and rarely from the Southern\r\nStates of the United States. It does not attack white people and\r\nthe susceptibility of black races is probably connected with their\r\ntendency to keloid development.\r\n\r\n  There have been all sorts of suggestions as to etiology: (_a_) that\r\n  it is related to leprosy, (_b_) that it is a tropho-neurosis, (_c_)\r\n  that it results from wearing constricting bands or rings on the\r\n  toe, (_d_) that it is connected with frequent injuries to the under\r\n  surface of the little toe.\r\n\r\nPathologically we find a fibrous cord which has replaced the bony\r\nstructures normally attaching the toe to the foot. We have, according\r\nto Unna, a ring-form sclerodermia with thickening of the epidermis\r\ncausing an endarteritis with the production of a rarefying osteitis.\r\n\r\nThe disease is chiefly found in male adults between twenty-five and\r\nthirty years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Symptomatology and Treatment=\r\n\r\nIn 90% of cases the little toe is the one affected, more rarely the\r\nfourth toe or very rarely both the fourth and little toe. The little\r\ntoes may be attacked at the same time but the condition usually first\r\nstarts in one toe. At first we have a crack in the digito-plantar\r\nfold of the little toe. This extends laterally and finally appears\r\non the dorsum. The distal portion of the toe enlarges and becomes\r\nbulbous so that it looks like a small potato. The connection between\r\nthe foot and the bloated-looking toe is a limp fibrous cord which\r\npermits the toe to wabble in various directions and to interfere\r\ngreatly with walking.\r\n\r\n  The course of the disease extends over several years if the toe\r\n  is not amputated by cutting through the fibrous pedicle or as the\r\n  result of ulceration from injury to the pedicle.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUNDOU\r\n\r\nGeneral Considerations\r\n\r\nThis is a disease which almost exclusively affects the black race\r\nand is chiefly found in the West Coast of Africa, where it is called\r\nbig-nose or dog-nose. It is also found occasionally in China and the\r\nMalay Peninsula.\r\n\r\n  The prominent root of the nose is due to exostoses from the nasal\r\n  processes of the superior maxillary bones.\r\n\r\nNothing definite is known as to etiology. Suggestions have been made\r\nthat it is connected with yaws, syphilis or leprosy. Again that it is\r\ndue to rhinoscleroma. Maclaud thought the hypertrophied tissues to\r\nbe incident to irritation from dipterous larvae in the nasal fossae.\r\nPathologically we have spongy bone covered by a thin layer of compact\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptomatology and Treatment\r\n\r\nAt first there is complaint of headache and an associated nasal\r\ndischarge. At times the nasal passages may be obstructed by the\r\ndeveloping growth, which however usually projects externally on both\r\nsides of the root of the nose just below the inner angle of the eyes.\r\nBreathing through the nose is not as a rule interfered with.\r\n\r\n  The bony exostoses develop in a downward and outward direction.\r\n  The shape is generally oval. The disease commences in childhood\r\n  and the bony outgrowths slowly increase in size so that by adult\r\n  life they attain the size of a walnut. The overlying skin is normal\r\n  and not attached to the bony tumor. As the tumors grow they tend\r\n  to interfere with the vision of the patient. This is purely from\r\n  obstructing the lines of vision as the growth does not usually\r\n  invade the orbits. The treatment is entirely surgical and consists\r\n  in chiselling away the bony outgrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUXTA-ARTICULAR NODULES\r\n\r\nGeneral Considerations\r\n\r\nThese nodular masses were first noted by Macgregor from cases in New\r\nGuinea but since then have been described from various parts of the\r\ntropical world.\r\n\r\n  These tumor masses were given the name juxta-articular nodules by\r\n  Jeanselme, who studied the affection in natives of Siam. It may\r\n  be stated that at present we know nothing definite as to etiology\r\n  although several authors have reported fungi as the cause. This\r\n  fungus has been stated to be a species of _Nocardia_. Some of the\r\n  cases which have been reported would seem to be late manifestations\r\n  of yaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymptomatology and Treatment\r\n\r\n  These tumor masses vary in size up to that of a golf ball and are\r\n  very hard in consistence. The skin over them is at first freely\r\n  movable, but later on may become attached. They are located\r\n  subcutaneously, especially about the external surfaces of the\r\n  extremities and particularly in relation to the joints. They are\r\n  not sensitive and rarely or never suppurate. The course is most\r\n  chronic and but rarely do they become absorbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.—Juxta-articular nodules. (After Steiner;\r\nfrom Mense.)]\r\n\r\n  In those parts of Africa where the tumors due to _Onchocerca\r\n  volvulus_ are found there may be confusion in diagnosis but\r\n  these filarial nodes are elastic. By aspirating the swelling\r\n  microfilariae should be found in onchocerciasis.\r\n\r\n  The treatment of juxta-articular nodules is by excision should they\r\n  give trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISCERAL MYCOSES\r\n\r\nThe majority of cases of visceral mycoses reported from tropical\r\nregions have been considered as caused by species of _Monilia_,\r\nbut not infrequently fungi of the genus _Cryptococcus_ have been\r\nincriminated. As a rule the mycosis is reported as occurring in\r\ncases which had been regarded as pulmonary tuberculosis. In some of\r\nthe cases there were cutaneous lesions, enlarged glands and even\r\ngeneralized conditions as well as lung involvement.\r\n\r\n  Among the fungi reported for the lungs we have: _Rhizomucor\r\n  parasiticum_, _Nocardia pseudotuberculosis_, _Aspergillus\r\n  fumigatus_, _Penicillium crustaceum_, _Monilia tropicalis_,\r\n  _Monilia candida_, _Cryptococcus gilchristi_, _Coccidioides\r\n  immitis_ and various other species. A satisfactory study of the\r\n  true nature of the causative fungi has been made in only certain\r\n  instances and a scientific investigation of this phase of tropical\r\n  pathology is desirable.\r\n\r\n  _Bronchomoniliasis._—Castellani has used this designation for two\r\n  types of cases in which various species of _Monilia_ have been\r\n  reported as causative. In one type the symptoms are mild with\r\n  but slight impairment of health, there being only a cough with\r\n  expectoration of muco-purulent sputum. No fever is present. In the\r\n  severe type we have the symptomatology of pulmonary tuberculosis\r\n  with abundant reddish-gray sputum. In both types the diagnosis is\r\n  made by finding the fungi in perfectly fresh sputum. This should\r\n  be cultured in a hanging-block culture using Sabouraud’s medium.\r\n  The mycelium and budding forms can best be studied in such a\r\n  preparation. Negative findings for tubercle bacilli are important\r\n  in diagnosis. Potassium iodide is recommended in treatment.\r\n\r\n  _Sporotrichosis._—The infection with various species of\r\n  _Sporotrichum_ usually gives rise to gummatous lesions along the\r\n  lines of the lymphatics of the extremities. These tumor masses\r\n  break down and discharge a yellowish-brown pus. Rarely the process\r\n  generalizes, then often invading the lungs. Culturing of the pus or\r\n  sputum is necessary for diagnosis. In cultures the sporothrix shows\r\n  a narrow (2µ) mycelium with grape-like clusters of oval spores\r\n  at the end of a filament. The treatment recommended is iodide of\r\n  potash.\r\n\r\n  _Blastomycosis._—The causative organism, _Cryptococcus\r\n  gilchristi_, is found in the purulent discharge as oval to round,\r\n  doubly contoured, budding yeast-like cells 10 to 16µ. In cultures\r\n  we have formation of a mycelium resembling that of an oidium. The\r\n  lesions may be solely cutaneous or generalized in which latter case\r\n  the lungs are apt to be involved giving a condition resembling\r\n  pulmonary tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n  _Coccidioidal granuloma._—This is a very rare and fatal infection\r\n  caused by _Coccidioides immitis_, a fungus somewhat similar in\r\n  cultures to _C. gilchristi_ but differing in tissues in that it\r\n  gives rise to endogenous spore formation in the cells found in\r\n  the granulomatous material. The spores are about 3µ in diameter\r\n  and contained in a large cell (30-60µ) which does not bud. We may\r\n  have skin lesions accompanying visceral involvement or the latter\r\n  alone. When involving the lung the infection closely resembles\r\n  pulmonary tuberculosis. The spores metastasize readily by way of\r\n  the lymphatics involved and we may have a picture of pyaemia. Skin\r\n  lesions, when present, are ragged and punched out. About 40 cases\r\n  have been reported, chiefly from California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSTICS OF TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS AND PROCEDURES TOGETHER WITH COSMOPOLITAN\r\nDISEASES IN THE TROPICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn temperate climates we always keep in mind syphilis, tuberculosis\r\nand the pyogenic infections when a diagnosis is in question. In the\r\ntropics these conditions are just as common, if not more so, and\r\nadded to them we have many other diseases with protean manifestations\r\nsuch as malaria, beriberi, leprosy, ancylostomiasis and other\r\nhelminthic infections, pellagra and amoebiasis.\r\n\r\n  The common mistake made by the physician when he first arrives\r\n  in a tropical country is to expect to deal chiefly with diseases\r\n  designated tropical. Before going to any tropical country the most\r\n  important preparation is the study of the statistical reports\r\n  from that section, covering a number of years. Everyone taking up\r\n  the study of tropical disease should first study the geographical\r\n  distribution of such diseases and those practising in temperate\r\n  climates should remember that the first question to be asked a man\r\n  suspected of having a tropical disease is “Where have you been\r\n  during the past months and years?” Then too the same question\r\n  should be applied as to intimate associates of the patient.\r\n\r\nWe all know how rare it is in temperate climates to find definite\r\npathological conditions in people who are apparently well. In such\r\npeople a definite finding of a cause sufficient to account for\r\nan illness is usually the key to the diagnosis. With those from\r\nthe tropics, however, it is different. A single individual may be\r\nfound upon examination to have amoebiasis, malaria, filariasis and\r\nsyphilis, yet none of these infections prevent him from following his\r\nusual occupation. When such a patient comes to a ward it requires a\r\ncorrelating mind to eliminate four or five definite diagnoses, and\r\nfix upon some disease which is common to both tropics and temperate\r\nclimates, as for example, typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n  In diagnosis in the tropics it is necessary to have at one’s\r\n  fingers’ ends the various physical signs and subjective symptoms\r\n  more or less characteristic of every disease of man as well as the\r\n  laboratory findings. It is only when one has at hand all obtainable\r\n  information that the solution of the medical problem becomes\r\n  possible.\r\n\r\n  Furthermore, it is necessary to be familiar with the fact that\r\n  certain infections, which at times give rise to marked alterations\r\n  in the health of a patient, may at other times, and in particular\r\n  when different races of man are concerned, give rise to no\r\n  recognizable interference with health. This is particularly true\r\n  of certain helminthological diseases, as for instance the slight\r\n  effects often noted in hookworm infection in the African races as\r\n  against the marked damage to those of the white race harboring such\r\n  parasites.\r\n\r\nWhile the medical man is apt to have superabundant energy during\r\nthe first few months of his tropical service this later gives way\r\nto the opposite state and in particular to a lack of initiative. It\r\nis possible to do that which is absolutely demanded in the daily\r\nwork, but this is along the lines of routine requirements and to the\r\nexclusion of new and difficult methods of diagnosis.\r\n\r\nConsequently, while in possession of full energy and zeal one should\r\ncultivate thorough and modern methods of study of his cases and make\r\nthese matters of routine, to use in the listless period to follow.\r\n\r\n  We do not usually fully appreciate the assistance the history of\r\n  the present illness as well as personal and family history of a\r\n  patient gives us, although it is generally recognized as the first\r\n  line of approach in diagnosis. In the tropics, when dealing with\r\n  natives, we have the difficulty of language to contend with as\r\n  well as with native superstition and popular ideas as to nature\r\n  and causation of disease. When employing a native interpreter\r\n  it is always well to keep in mind the fact that such assistants\r\n  will rarely admit of ignorance of the language of the medical man\r\n  and, furthermore, they try to twist the answers of the patients\r\n  to make them agree with what they may think is in accordance with\r\n  the desire of the examiner. Again in carrying out the physical\r\n  examination it is difficult to be certain that the findings as to\r\n  location or degree of pain, sensations, or time of appearance of\r\n  lesions, as well as data as to pulmonary, renal and alimentary\r\n  tract disorders, are correct.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it would seem advisable to reverse the ordinary\r\nmethods of diagnosis when employed in the tropics. Instead of making\r\na tentative diagnosis following the physical examination, and then\r\nconfirming or adding to evidence with laboratory data, it is better\r\nto first secure the findings as to blood, faeces, urine, sputum,\r\netc., and then check up such indications as to the diagnosis by a\r\nfinal and thorough physical examination.\r\n\r\n  This method of procedure has been criticised by some of my\r\n  friends and in fact is a source of criticism on my part when,\r\n  as a laboratory worker, I have been asked by a purely clinical\r\n  colleague to make a routine laboratory examination of one of his\r\n  patients without any previous study of the case on his part. Every\r\n  laboratory man recognizes the assistance a tentative diagnosis\r\n  on the part of the clinician gives him in that it suggests the\r\n  examinations which should be gone into with particular care.\r\n\r\n  The present trend, even in temperate climate practice and always\r\n  with the tropical internist, is to have familiarity with laboratory\r\n  technique and interpretation as well as with the methods of\r\n  physical diagnosis; consequently the tropical practitioner makes no\r\n  dividing line between the diagnostic information obtained in the\r\n  laboratory and that gotten at the bedside.\r\n\r\n  It is not difficult to train a native helper to make and stain\r\n  good blood smears as well as to examine such preparations, and the\r\n  same holds for the urine and faeces preparations. The skill in\r\n  making preparations, the familiarity with pathological findings\r\n  and the patience in studying a preparation on the part of these\r\n  assistants is at times a matter of surprise. Thus in a few minutes\r\n  the physician can check up these findings or the lack of findings\r\n  and have them at hand to assist him in his study of his case.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Examination.=—In the laboratory the routine examination\r\nshould embrace, first, a study of a _stained blood smear_. It is\r\nessential that the smear be well made and the Romanowsky stain used a\r\ngood one.\r\n\r\n  While more difficult to make than a smear on a slide the\r\n  cover-glass smear method of Ehrlich has the advantage that the\r\n  white cells are more evenly distributed and consequently the\r\n  differential count more reliable. Furthermore, after a little\r\n  practice, one can approximate the white count of a patient by\r\n  examining the stained smear with a low power objective (16 mm).\r\n  In my experience I get a better general impression of a large\r\n  mononuclear increase with the low power than I do with the\r\n  oil-immersion. As a matter of fact one can make his differential\r\n  count with a low power objective after some practice. Next, using a\r\n  high dry or immersion objective, we search for malarial parasites.\r\n  It must be remembered that even when there is nothing diagnostic\r\n  in a stained blood smear there is much information to be obtained\r\n  in the way of diagnostic exclusion. Furthermore, while looking\r\n  over the preparation some diagnosis may suggest itself and there\r\n  is nothing more important in diagnosis than to have possibilities\r\n  of diagnosis in mind. It is often stated in connection with the\r\n  diagnosis of liver abscess that one should always suspect liver\r\n  abscess in a tropical patient and this will hold for other diseases\r\n  and thus the careful examination of a blood smear may be suggestive\r\n  if not diagnostic.\r\n\r\nNext the _faeces_ should be examined both in an ordinary preparation\r\nand in one mounted in Gram’s iodine solution.\r\n\r\n  In the preparation made from a particle of faeces, emulsified\r\n  in salt solution, we can note any excess of fatty acids or soap\r\n  crystals and lack of normal digestion of meat fibres as well as\r\n  presence of ova of intestinal parasites. Again such a preparation\r\n  is necessary for noting amoeboid activity of amoebae as well as for\r\n  the motility of flagellates and _Strongyloides_ embryos. In the\r\n  preparation mounted in Gram’s iodine solution we have distinctly\r\n  brought out the nuclear division of encysted amoebae, our most\r\n  practical means of differentiating between the pathogenic and\r\n  nonpathogenic amoebae. This method also brings out flagellate\r\n  characteristics. Again, any undigested starch grains show up\r\n  distinctly by reason of their blue color. Blood cells and yeast\r\n  cells stain a golden yellow.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of the _urine_ it is well to take up with a\r\npipette the entire sediment from a centrifuged tube of urine and\r\ndeposit it on a slide.\r\n\r\n  Examination with diminished illumination and using the two-thirds\r\n  objective quickly enables us to ascertain presence and character\r\n  of casts. This same sediment is then treated with Gram’s iodine\r\n  solution and a cover-glass applied. Such a preparation, using the\r\n  one-sixth objective, brings out distinctly the differentiation\r\n  of pus cells from renal epithelium as well as showing clearly\r\n  golden-yellow red blood cells. While centrifuging one can test for\r\n  albumin. A qualitative test for sugar takes only a few moments to\r\n  make.\r\n\r\nThese simple quick tests of blood, faeces and urine suffice for\r\nthe preliminary laboratory work in a case. Following the physical\r\nexamination we can carry out more elaborate laboratory tests as\r\nindicated by the tentative diagnosis obtained from the physical\r\nexamination and preliminary laboratory investigations.\r\n\r\n=Physical Examination.=—As regards the physical examination it must\r\nbe remembered that in the tropics glandular enlargements and skin\r\neruptions are so essential in diagnosis that the rule generally\r\nadopted in skin clinics should be adhered to, that is an inspection\r\nof the entire body surface, either by stripping the patient or\r\nremoving clothing from one part at a time.\r\n\r\n  The sphygmomanometer is of value in the diagnosis of tropical\r\n  affections as well as those of temperate regions. Similarly,\r\n  functional tests of the heart and kidneys, basal metabolism\r\n  determinations, chemical examination of the blood, and tests for\r\n  acid-base equilibrium may give definite information—in one climate\r\n  as in another.\r\n\r\n  Palpation is peculiarly important in the diagnosis of the enlarged\r\n  spleen, liver and glands of many tropical affections as well as for\r\n  mapping out intestinal thickenings. Again in going over the patient\r\n  for outlining heart, liver, etc., palpatory percussion is more\r\n  satisfactory than the usual mediate percussion.\r\n\r\n  I find the use of the entire palmar surface of the middle finger,\r\n  gently tapped over the surface, to give better results than any\r\n  other method. In this way the percussion note is well elicited\r\n  and the sense of resistance most satisfactorily obtained. The use\r\n  of the tips of the index, middle and ring fingers, with a piano\r\n  playing stroke, also should be employed.\r\n\r\n  One should always determine the character of the reflexes. Of these\r\n  the most important are the patellar and biceps ones. This latter\r\n  reflex is normally rarely obtained.\r\n\r\n  The pupillary reactions also require little time for eliciting and\r\n  are of much value in differentiating a peripheral neuritis from a\r\n  cord lesion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSMOPOLITAN DISEASES IN THE TROPICS\r\n\r\nIn considering the matter of the general prevalence of disease in\r\nthe tropics it has seemed advisable to present statistics from\r\nthe standpoint of deaths rather than admissions for disease, the\r\nprobability of accuracy in diagnosis being greater where there may be\r\nthe assistance of an autopsy.\r\n\r\n  In the following table I have selected three tropical places under\r\n  American sanitary control, the city of Manila, the city of Panama\r\n  and the Island of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The statistics\r\n  embrace the calendar years of 1918, 1919 and 1920 The statistics of\r\n  Manila relate solely to the Filipino population resident in Manila,\r\n  it does not include Americans or other nationalities. The Filipino\r\n  population of Manila in 1920 was 263,386. The three years covered\r\n  had respectively a death rate of 49.97, 28.66 and 27.48 per 1000.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n                   |

-----------------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\n  The population of the city of Panama during the year 1920 was\r\n  60,500. The death rate during the years covered was 21.41, 19.73,\r\n  and 21.44 per 1000, respectively.\r\n\r\n  It may be stated that the average population of the Canal Zone\r\n  during 1920 was 27,459, with 242 deaths, giving a death rate of\r\n  8.81 per 1000.\r\n\r\n  The population of St. Thomas during 1920 is estimated at 10,191.\r\n  The death rate during 1918 was 24.33, during 1919, 17.27 and during\r\n  1920, 18.15 per 1000.\r\n\r\n  The diseases in the table of deaths do not account for all the\r\n  deaths, the others having been from other diseases, accidents, etc.\r\n\r\n  In studying the Manila statistical reports more in detail we note\r\n  that during 1920 there were reported 64 cases of diphtheria, 387 of\r\n  measles and 577 of typhoid fever. The reasons for the high death\r\n  rate in 1918 are clearly seen, namely, the epidemics of influenza\r\n  and smallpox. As is the case in nearly every epidemic of influenza,\r\n  the increase in deaths from this disease was accompanied with a\r\n  large increase in deaths from acute bronchitis and the various\r\n  pneumonias, conditions that in many cases should have been ascribed\r\n  to influenza. The smallpox epidemic during 1918 was brought under\r\n  control by a very extensive vaccination campaign. Only one death\r\n  from this disease occurred in 1920.\r\n\r\n  During 1920, there were reported in Panama 95 cases of diphtheria,\r\n  313 of influenza, 154 of measles, 9 of typhoid fever, 4 of scarlet\r\n  fever, 14 of smallpox and 311 of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n  During the same period there were reported in St. Thomas 6 cases\r\n  of chickenpox and 40 cases of tuberculosis. No cases of influenza,\r\n  smallpox, measles or typhoid fever occurred. From reports for the\r\n  year of 1921, it is noted that an extensive although not severe\r\n  epidemic of measles has been present in the Virgin Islands during\r\n  said year.\r\n\r\n  From the above tables we note that as far as actual causes of\r\n  deaths are concerned the cosmopolitan diseases play a more\r\n  important rôle than those we designate tropical diseases.\r\n  Tuberculosis ranks first, other respiratory infections come a\r\n  close second. Organic diseases of the heart and other degenerative\r\n  diseases, such as chronic nephritis, are also noted for their\r\n  frequency. The gastro-intestinal infections, typhoid fever,\r\n  dysentery, diarrhoea, probably serve as a barometer of the sanitary\r\n  conditions of a city.\r\n\r\n  But there are many other diseases whose importance from an economic\r\n  standpoint may not be fully appreciated from mortality tables.\r\n  Notable among these are venereal diseases, malaria, filariasis,\r\n  yaws and hookworm diseases. Further it may be noted that many\r\n  diseases without being the direct cause of death have a distinct\r\n  bearing on the mortality. Amongst these we note particularly the\r\n  various worm-infestations. The experience in Bilibid prison is an\r\n  illustrating example. The mortality amongst the prisoners dropped\r\n  markedly after the inmates had been cured of their various worm\r\n  conditions.\r\n\r\n=Rheumatic Fever and Scarlet Fever.=—From a study of the statistical\r\nreports and from the writings of various authorities there would\r\nseem to be two cosmopolitan diseases, which are of extreme rarity in\r\nthe tropics, rheumatic fever and scarlet fever.\r\n\r\n  It is true that in the Gold Coast report for 1911 there are noted\r\n  614 cases of rheumatic fever with one death.\r\n\r\n  There does not, however, appear to be any striking increase in\r\n  admissions for valvular disease of the heart as would naturally be\r\n  expected.\r\n\r\n  In Calcutta, in 1911, there were 74 deaths from rheumatic fever.\r\n\r\nAs regards scarlet fever, statistical reports from various parts of\r\nthe tropical world fail to show cases.\r\n\r\n  In a report from Shanghai, which can hardly be considered as a\r\n  tropical city, there is a statement that this disease first made\r\n  its appearance in 1900, since which time it has spread among the\r\n  Chinese, exhibiting marked virulence. Again in a Basutoland report\r\n  there were quite a number of cases reported (67), but as this\r\n  colony is in the extreme south of Africa it could hardly be called\r\n  tropical.\r\n\r\n=Typhoid Fever.=—When reliance for diagnosis rested almost solely on\r\nclinical manifestations, it was held that typhoid fever was rare or\r\nunknown in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  Since the advent of laboratory methods of diagnosis it has become\r\n  known that typhoid and the paratyphoid fevers are quite common. The\r\n  paratyphoid infections are more common in the tropics than in the\r\n  temperate regions. The fever course and clinical picture of typhoid\r\n  in the tropics are distinctly atypical. It was formerly common to\r\n  consider cases of typhoid as malaria and in the southern states of\r\n  the United States it was a common thing to diagnose typho-malarial\r\n  fever.\r\n\r\n  Of course, latent malaria is apt to flare up in a person sick with\r\n  typhoid, but the idea that there was a symptom-complex partaking\r\n  of the characteristics of typhoid fever and malaria is now classed\r\n  with historical data.\r\n\r\n  It is a remarkable fact that in many of the cities of the Orient\r\n  conditions favoring infection with typhoid fever, such as neglect\r\n  of the most elementary measures of disposal of faeces and lack of\r\n  safeguarding of water supplies, exist and yet the natives seem to\r\n  have an immunity to organisms causing alimentary tract diseases. It\r\n  must be that such immunity is acquired by attacks of the disease\r\n  in childhood. Certainly, Europeans in such communities have no\r\n  protection unless they are vaccinated. It must be remembered that\r\n  the protection from vaccination against the enteric group of\r\n  bacteria can be relied on for not longer than a period of two years.\r\n\r\n  It would seem that typhoid fever in tropical countries is more\r\n  serious than in temperate climates—thus the death rate in India is\r\n  about twice as great.\r\n\r\n  In the absence of laboratory tests the chief reliance in the\r\n  clinical diagnosis of typhoid should rest in the rather gradual\r\n  onset of a continued fever, with a rather apathetic toxaemia. Of\r\n  course atypical cases may have a fairly abrupt onset. An important\r\n  point in the diagnosis is the rather slow pulse rate for the\r\n  temperature elevation.\r\n\r\n  _Marris Atropine Test._—Manson-Bahr regards the Marris atropine\r\n  test as of the utmost value in the diagnosis of the enteric\r\n  group of fevers. In this test one gives a hypodermic injection\r\n  of grain 1/50 of atropine sulphate. Should the case be typhoid\r\n  or paratyphoid the pulse rate is practically uninfluenced during\r\n  the period from 25 to 50 minutes after the injection. In other\r\n  infections or in normal individuals, the pulse rate drops at first\r\n  but after 10 or 15 minutes rises to exceed the pulse rate before\r\n  the injection by 30 or 40 beats during the period of 25 to 50\r\n  minutes following the injection.\r\n\r\n  In the laboratory tests the prime reliance must be placed in blood\r\n  culture, which of course should be made during the first ten\r\n  days of the illness. Blood cultures give positive results in the\r\n  inoculated as well as in those not protected by vaccination.\r\n\r\n  Agglutination tests are the ones of choice after such a period, but\r\n  one must discount agglutination in those who have been vaccinated\r\n  previously. Of course the rising agglutination titre during the\r\n  course of the disease gives valuable information, and the Dreyer\r\n  technique, where simultaneous tests are made on emulsions of\r\n  typhoid, paratyphoid A and paratyphoid B at intervals of 4 days,\r\n  noting a distinct rise for one of these organisms, is based on this\r\n  factor. At the same time this technique is exacting and does not\r\n  seem to have given the results that were at first expected.\r\n\r\n  Culturing the urine is of more value in diagnosis than that of the\r\n  faeces. Bacilluria may be expected in about one-fifth of cases\r\n  after the second week. Faeces culturing gives positive results in a\r\n  smaller proportion of cases and is attended with much difficulty.\r\n\r\n  _The Paratyphoid Fevers._—The paratyphoids would seem to be\r\n  more prevalent, in proportion to typhoid, in the tropics than\r\n  in temperate climates, thus in India, of 1886 British soldiers,\r\n  convalescent from enteric fevers, 791 were diagnosed as typhoid,\r\n  633 as paratyphoid A, 136 as paratyphoid B and 326 as enteric cases\r\n  of uncertain etiology. Paratyphoid B cases seem more frequent in\r\n  temperate climates than paratyphoid A ones, as noted during the\r\n  war in France. Cruickshank, and Lafrenais, in a study of carriers,\r\n  among the 1886 cases noted above observed that 49 became carriers\r\n  and of these 34 were from paratyphoid A cases, 9 from typhoid\r\n  convalescents and 6 from paratyphoid B convalescents. Of 13 chronic\r\n  carriers (those carriers excreting organisms after a period of six\r\n  months) 8 were carriers of paratyphoid A, 4 of typhoid and 1 of\r\n  paratyphoid B.\r\n\r\n  This evidence would indicate that paratyphoid A, once introduced,\r\n  would spread more widely than the other enteric affections.\r\n\r\n  Clinically, paratyphoid A cases resemble typhoid ones rather\r\n  closely, although as a rule less severe in course. With paratyphoid\r\n  B the course is less severe than with the other enteric organisms\r\n  but it often shows an abrupt onset and is frequently similar to\r\n  cases of meat poisoning. This organism and the Gärtner bacillus\r\n  are common excitants of the so-called ptomaine poisoning cases.\r\n  Paratyphoid B cases show a tendency to localize in the pelvis of\r\n  the kidney or elsewhere and may cause a broncho-pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  _Colon Infections._—Such infections seem to be rare in temperate\r\n  climates other than as localized conditions especially of the\r\n  urinary bladder. Cholecystitis is not infrequently due to a colon\r\n  bacillus infection. In the tropics, however, especially following\r\n  bacillary dysentery, we may have a generalized infection which may\r\n  result in a fatal septicaemia. In such cases abscess formation in\r\n  the kidneys is usually found.\r\n\r\n  Cases diagnosed as mild typhoid fever have as a result of blood\r\n  cultures been found to occasionally be due to a colon bacteriaemia.\r\n\r\n  In temperate climates as well as in the tropics pyelitis is often\r\n  due to a colon infection and probably 10% of cases of appendicitis\r\n  are caused by the colon bacillus alone, although it is extremely\r\n  frequent in association with streptococci or staphylococci.\r\n\r\n  _Bacillus alkaligines faecalis_ infections. Cases similar to\r\n  typhoid fever have been found to be due to infections with this\r\n  member of the typhoid-colon group of organisms.\r\n\r\n=Tuberculosis.=—The negro race seems to possess a greater\r\nsusceptibility to tuberculosis than the white one, a fact well\r\nrecognized in the United States, where the colored population suffers\r\nfar more severely than their white neighbors. The yellow races also\r\nshow marked susceptibility to the scourge and in the Philippines it\r\nis easily the greatest cause of death.\r\n\r\n  In tropical regions the natives of the sea-level regions suffer\r\n  more than those of the mountain plateaus and where the humidity is\r\n  high rather than in arid sections. Thus tuberculosis is very rare\r\n  or almost unknown in the dry desert-like regions of upper Egypt and\r\n  the Sahara desert.\r\n\r\n  The disease gains headway in the rainy season and diminishes in\r\n  prevalence during the dry season.\r\n\r\n  One factor in the great spread of the disease is the intimate\r\n  contact of natives living together in a small room.\r\n\r\nIt is generally recognized that susceptibility is greater in\r\nchildhood and that infection by way of the alimentary tract is common\r\nin children.\r\n\r\n  When one notes the habit of expectorating anywhere and everywhere\r\n  on the part of people untrained in hygienic rules, it is easy\r\n  to recognize the opportunity babies and young children have of\r\n  ingesting tuberculous material taken up on their hands while they\r\n  are crawling about.\r\n\r\n  During the war there was a great deal of tuberculosis among the\r\n  native African troops serving in France, and a study of the disease\r\n  in these men has furnished us information as to the existence\r\n  of two clinical types among them. In the soldiers from Morocco\r\n  and Algiers, the type observed was similar to that occurring in\r\n  Europeans, and this was explained on the basis of the opportunity\r\n  that had been given the people of the areas from which the troops\r\n  came to acquire tuberculosis from contact with white colonists and\r\n  during a period of many years to have acquired a certain degree of\r\n  resistance to the invasion of the tubercle bacillus.\r\n\r\n  In connection with the Senegalese troops and some others coming\r\n  from sections of Africa where tuberculosis was rare or nonexistent\r\n  another type was observed which corresponded with the tuberculosis\r\n  one sees in a young child or a guinea pig.\r\n\r\n  In these cases the disease starts with enlargement of the glands\r\n  at the roots of the lungs. This finding of course would require\r\n  an X-ray plate but it was found that the enlargement of the\r\n  supraclavicular glands at a point near the insertion of the\r\n  sternocleidomastoid was one of the best early signs. The glandular\r\n  stage lasted about five to ten weeks during which time the general\r\n  health did not seem to be materially impaired. Following this stage\r\n  and lasting only about two weeks or up to two months a stage of\r\n  generalized tuberculosis sets in with fever, emaciation, caseous\r\n  pneumonia or manifestations of miliary tuberculosis. There was\r\n  no tendency to fibrosis or cure of the process, death almost\r\n  invariably occurring. Borrel, who studied the disease in these\r\n  natives, states that if put at rest and placed on a generous diet,\r\n  while the case is in the glandular stage, one-half of them may\r\n  recover. It was noted that sputum examinations of these cases were\r\n  almost invariably negative.\r\n\r\n=Smallpox.=—This disease may justly be considered the greatest\r\nscourge of the natives of tropical countries. It is responsible for\r\nmuch of the blindness noted in natives of sections where vaccination\r\nhas not been employed.\r\n\r\n  In some of the countries of the Orient smallpox kills more people\r\n  than cholera, plague and dysentery together. Many reports have\r\n  shown that as many as 80 to 90% of a native population may be\r\n  attacked in an outbreak and of these practically one-half die. In\r\n  such communities the disease is more one of young children, the\r\n  adults possessing a certain degree of immunity from attacks in\r\n  childhood during previous epidemics. It has frequently been noted\r\n  that the native colored races do not seem to acquire as marked an\r\n  immunity as is observed among the white races of temperate climates\r\n  following an attack of the disease. Again it has been insisted\r\n  that the immunity following vaccination is not as marked as that\r\n  obtaining in European countries. This point would seem not well\r\n  founded because efficient and universal vaccination has apparently\r\n  caused smallpox in the Philippines to be of no more importance\r\n  than it is among any other well vaccinated people. It is striking\r\n  to note the great number of pitted faces among adult Filipinos,\r\n  whereas this condition is practically absent in the generation\r\n  following the general vaccination introduced by the Americans.\r\n\r\nIn tropical natives the most severe forms of smallpox are\r\nobserved—confluent and haemorrhagic.\r\n\r\n  Opportunities for the spread of the disease are most favorable in\r\n  many parts of the tropical world by reason of intimate association,\r\n  religious festivals and pilgrimages.\r\n\r\n  Under the name _alastrim_ or Kaffir milk-pox, a disease similar\r\n  to a mild form of smallpox has been reported from Africa and the\r\n  West Indies. Various points were raised to differentiate it from\r\n  smallpox, but in a recent epidemic in Jamaica and Haiti proof was\r\n  adduced to demonstrate its identity with smallpox. In Haiti the\r\n  epidemic was controlled by vaccination with smallpox vaccine, and\r\n  those individuals exposed to the infection but properly vaccinated,\r\n  uniformly escaped. Among the soldiers of the Marine Corps in Haiti\r\n  there were only two cases and these occurred in men who gave no\r\n  evidences, of successful vaccination.\r\n\r\n=Varicella.=—This disease is of common occurrence in the tropics\r\nand does not seem to give rise to greater mortality than it does in\r\ntemperate climates.\r\n\r\n  In the Philippines I have been struck by the resemblance it bears\r\n  to cases of varioloid, inasmuch as we frequently note as numerous\r\n  lesions on the face as on the body. In fact I have been sure that\r\n  the pustular lesions of the face of such cases were those of\r\n  smallpox, until I noted typical varicella lesions on the body.\r\n\r\n=Mumps.=—This disease is found in many parts of the tropics and\r\npresents similar features to the epidemic parotitis of temperate\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\n  In the Philippines there seem to be cases similar to mumps but\r\n  without the contagious feature so characteristic of the disease in\r\n  Europe.\r\n\r\n=Glanders.=—This rare disease of Europe and the United States seems\r\nto be much more common in many tropical countries. In the Philippines\r\nit generally shows itself in the acute form and is much dreaded by\r\nreason of its great infectiousness.\r\n\r\n=Diphtheria.=—Formerly there was an idea that diphtheria, like\r\nscarlet fever, was extremely rare or unknown in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  The assistance of the laboratory has shown that this old idea is\r\n  incorrect and that the disease is fairly prevalent in many tropical\r\n  regions.\r\n\r\n=Vincent’s Angina.=—While not rare in temperate climates, various\r\naffections of the oral mucous membrane due to the fusiform bacillus\r\nin symbiosis with various species of spirilla are fairly common in\r\nthe tropics. The best known condition is one in which the tonsils\r\nshow somewhat the appearance of a follicular tonsillitis but\r\nulceration is more common and severe, with however, less evidence of\r\ntoxaemia.\r\n\r\n  The temperature in a case of pure Vincent’s Angina rarely exceeds\r\n  101°F. but if there is a mixed infection with other pyogenic\r\n  organisms the temperature and other signs of a severe infection\r\n  may be more marked. There is usually more or less swelling of\r\n  tributary glands. Associated with the angina or alone we may\r\n  have a gingivitis in which the spongy gums more or less resemble\r\n  those of scurvy or of pyorrheoa alveolaris. In fact these Vincent\r\n  organisms have been considered as factors in the development of\r\n  pyorrhoea alveolaris. In the tropics there have been many reports\r\n  of organisms of the type of those described by Vincent occurring in\r\n  skin ulceration or affection of the mucous membranes other than the\r\n  oral ones, more particularly the pudendal mucous membranes.\r\n\r\n  The infections are readily and easily diagnosed by a smear stained\r\n  with any simple aniline dye. Care must be taken not to accept such\r\n  a finding as the sole cause, as an underlying diphtheria, syphilis\r\n  or other dyscrasia may be more important.\r\n\r\n=Malignant Tumors.=—It is usually stated that malignant tumors\r\nare very rare among tropical natives. The proper solution of this\r\nquestion, however, is complicated by the frequent lack of careful\r\nautopsies.\r\n\r\n=Pneumonia.=—Just as with the tubercle bacillus so does the black\r\nrace seem to have less resistance to the _Pneumococcus_ than does the\r\nwhite one.\r\n\r\n  Great engineering works employing tropical natives are frequently\r\n  associated with very fatal epidemics of pneumonia, especially\r\n  broncho-pneumonia. Again in the black races the infection tends to\r\n  become generalized rather than localized in the lungs. It is more\r\n  toxic and insidious in its course than is true of the infection in\r\n  the white man; it has the fatal trend of pneumonia of the aged.\r\n  Another tendency is to invasion of the meninges.\r\n\r\n=Influenza.=—In temperate climates we associate this disease with\r\nbronchial and coryzal manifestations. In the tropics types almost\r\nunrecognized in Europe are noted, especially the gastro-intestinal\r\nand nervous ones. The similarity in the clinical picture of dengue\r\nwith slight eruption and tropical influenza is striking.\r\n\r\n  During the recent pandemic of influenza there was a frequent\r\n  complication of influenza pneumonia; many of these influenza\r\n  bronchopneumonias resembled plague pneumonia.\r\n\r\n=Tetanus.=—This infection is far more prevalent in tropical than\r\nin temperate climates. It is particularly fatal to infants, the\r\ninfection occurring from errors in the dressing of the cord at the\r\ntime of childbirth.\r\n\r\n=Syphilis and Other Venereal Diseases.=—Syphilis is rampant in many\r\nparts of the tropical world. Jeanselme has noted that syphilis among\r\ntropical natives often starts with an extra-genital lesion which\r\ntends to become phagedenic and that the secondaries are but slightly\r\nmarked. It is in the tertiary stage that the disease shows itself in\r\nits malignancy.\r\n\r\n  All tropical workers have noted the absence of tabetic and paretic\r\n  manifestations in the native syphilitics. LeDantec notes that he\r\n  has not observed parasyphilis in any European who had contracted\r\n  syphilis from a native woman and brings up the question of a\r\n  difference in strains of syphilis.\r\n\r\n  The American Naval Surgeons at Guam and Samoa have been struck\r\n  with the absence of primary lesions of syphilis among the natives\r\n  of these islands and Butler has suggested that this is due to an\r\n  immunity received as result of contracting yaws in childhood. There\r\n  certainly are many reasons for considering syphilis and yaws as\r\n  closely related.\r\n\r\n_Soft chancre_ is common in many tropical seaports and shows itself\r\nin a rather virulent form. In particular it is apt to be complicated\r\nby suppurating buboes.\r\n\r\nIn _tropical gonorrhoea_ it would seem that involvement of the\r\ntesticles is more common than in temperate climates.\r\n\r\n=Endocrine Disturbances.=—Internists in all parts of the world\r\nare beginning to appreciate that many of the puzzling complaints\r\nof ill-health are connected with abnormal functioning of the\r\nductless glands. The conditions resulting from excessive or\r\ndiminished functioning of the thyroid gland are well understood and\r\nthe determination of the basal metabolism rate is now a standard\r\nlaboratory procedure. There are many types of apparatus on the market\r\nand the determination is within the reach of any hospital staff.\r\n\r\nHyperthyroidism is now rarely unrecognized as is also true of\r\nmyxoedema but sub-states of thyroid functioning are less frequently\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n  McCarrison has stressed the importance of endocrine disturbances\r\n  in dietetic deficiencies and notes atrophy of all the glands\r\n  of internal secretion in such conditions with the exception of\r\n  the adrenal which tends to hypertrophy. There is possibly some\r\n  hypertrophy of the pituitary in males. The oedema which accompanies\r\n  most of the food deficiency diseases he associates with the adrenal\r\n  enlargement and hyperactivity of function, although oedema does\r\n  not invariably result from such hypertrophy. In pellagra there is\r\n  a low blood pressure, possibly due to adrenal hypofunction. Goitre\r\n  is found in many parts of the tropical world and Castellani states\r\n  that this disease is met with frequently in Ceylon and various\r\n  regions of Africa. Disturbances of the internal secretion of the\r\n  pancreas, resulting in diabetes, are common in parts of Asia.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Basal Metabolism_.—In the study of cases where\r\nabnormal thyroid functioning is suspected the most accurate method of\r\nsuch determination is by estimating the percentage of the patient’s\r\nmetabolism as above or below the normal average.\r\n\r\n  Basal metabolism is that caloric value which an individual produces\r\n  while resting in bed and prior to taking breakfast—in other words\r\n  when the effects of food and exercise on caloric output are least\r\n  operative. Basal metabolism is expressed in terms of calories per\r\n  hour per square meter of body surface. It varies with different\r\n  ages. It is proportionate to body surface which is calculated\r\n  from the height and weight of the individual. Normally this\r\n  metabolism should not vary more than 15% above or below accepted\r\n  normal figures. The use of the respiration calorimeter is the most\r\n  accurate method for determination of heat production but it has\r\n  now been found that the oxygen consumption during short periods\r\n  gives data for calculation of such heat production (indirect\r\n  calorimetry). In the Benedict portable respiration apparatus\r\n  the patient breathes into and out of a confined volume of air\r\n  circulating through a series of purifiers which remove the carbon\r\n  dioxide. A determination of the volume of oxygen consumed is made\r\n  from the decrease in the total air volume. The heat production\r\n  resulting from the absorption of one litre of oxygen is relatively\r\n  constant whether used to burn fat or carbohydrate and gives an\r\n  accurate index of total heat production. The Benedict apparatus\r\n  can also be employed for determining carbon dioxide excretion and\r\n  thereby giving data for the respiratory quotient. The determination\r\n  of the heat produced in the excretion of carbon dioxide is less\r\n  accurate although easier of determination. In marked cases of\r\n  hyperthyroidism the basal metabolism ranges 75% above the normal\r\n  figures, between 50 and 75% for severe cases and less than 50% for\r\n  mild cases. In hypothyroidism the figures are usually 20 to 40%\r\n  below the normal averages. The average respiratory quotient is\r\n  taken as O.82 and the calorific value of oxygen at this respiratory\r\n  quotient is 4.825 per litre. We multiply the litres of oxygen\r\n  by 4.825 to compute the heat output. It must be remembered that\r\n  patients with high fever give 30 to 40% heat production over normal\r\n  figures. Severe cardiac and renal conditions as well as leukaemias\r\n  also give high values. The average calorie output per square meter\r\n  of body surface per hour based on the Du Bois “height-weight”\r\n  formula, is 39.7 for man and 36.9 for women between the ages of 20\r\n  and 40, being greater in youth and less beyond forty.\r\n\r\n=Focal Infections.=—In recent years our attention has been directed\r\nto the importance of certain localized bacterial foci which may\r\nextend through blood or lymph channels and give rise to various\r\nsystemic or localized diseases. Most important of these diseases are\r\nvarious types of arthritis together with endocarditis, myocarditis\r\nand pericarditis. Next in importance are renal infections, chiefly of\r\nthe glomerulonephritis type.\r\n\r\n  Cholecystitis, appendicitis, pancreatitis and various skin lesions\r\n  may also have origin in a focal infection. The primary foci may be\r\n  localized in any part of the body but those seated in the tonsilar,\r\n  peridental membrane, nasal and accessory sinus tissues are the\r\n  most common and important. Focal infections of the genito-urinary\r\n  tract may also give rise to generalized conditions as is also\r\n  true of such foci in the alimentary tract. In the tonsils we\r\n  should particularly examine the material of crypts for various\r\n  streptococci and likewise the bacterial flora of tooth abscesses or\r\n  pyorrhoea alveolaris.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING NUMBER OF TIMES EACH FOCUS WAS CONSIDERED A PROBABLE\r\nSOURCE OF INFECTION IN A SERIES STUDIED BY BILLINGS AND ASSOCIATES\r\n\r\n                                     No.\r\n  Tonsil                             336\r\n  Teeth                              136\r\n  Sinus                               12\r\n  Bronchi                              5\r\n  Uterus and tubes                    12\r\n  Prostate and genito-urinary tract   24\r\n  Gallbladder                          3\r\n  Enterocolitis                        2\r\n  Appendix                             1\r\n  Middle ear                           1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nONSET AND THE TEMPERATURE CHART IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile a knowledge of the variations in type and course of the body\r\ntemperature in the various tropical diseases is of great value in\r\ndiagnosis, yet such information is liable to lead one astray, unless\r\nsuch data are controlled by a careful consideration of the other\r\nand, in my opinion, more important factors of physical diagnosis and\r\nlaboratory examinations.\r\n\r\n  The idea that there is a scientific exactness in the employment of\r\n  the clinical thermometer tends to make one overestimate its value\r\n  in diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that the high air temperature one encounters\r\n  in the tropics affects the clinical thermometer, which is of the\r\n  maximum type. This is particularly true when the sun may be shining\r\n  on the container in which the thermometer may be kept. Even if one\r\n  shakes down the column of mercury before putting it in the mouth,\r\n  the glass of the instrument will quickly cause the mercury column\r\n  again to rise. It should be a practice to place the instrument in\r\n  cool water before inserting it in the mouth and we must not forget\r\n  that a sufficient retention in the mouth, from two to five minutes,\r\n  should be insisted upon before accepting the temperature reading.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes we may divide tropical diseases, from a\r\nstandpoint of body temperature, into two classes. (1) _Those diseases\r\nin which the absence of fever in the general course of the illness is\r\nthe rule, and_ (2) _those diseases in which the presence of fever in\r\nthe general course of the illness is the rule_.\r\n\r\n=Nonfebrile Diseases.=—Among the nonfebrile diseases we may note\r\nthe following: Beriberi, sprue, pellagra, cholera, leprosy, amoebic\r\ndysentery, hookworm disease, filariasis, bilharziosis, endemic\r\nhaemoptysis or paragonomiasis, liver fluke disease, malarial\r\ncachexia, yaws, verruga, oriental sore and ulcerating granuloma of\r\nthe pudenda, as well as the various tropical skin diseases.\r\n\r\n  One should always keep in mind the fact that a latent malaria often\r\n  gives way to frank malarial manifestations when some intercurrent\r\n  disease still further reduces the body resistance. This is not\r\n  infrequently the explanation of a febrile onset in the course of\r\n  a disease typically afebrile. In the tropics if a fever chart\r\n  does not show a characteristic periodicity one can often obtain\r\n  indications of periodicity even in a continued or remittent fever\r\n  course by the greater elevation of temperature every third day\r\n  (tertian periodicity).\r\n\r\n  Another disease which often flares up following conditions which\r\n  lower vitality and giving rise to fever and manifestations of\r\n  toxemia is tuberculosis, a disease as common in the tropics\r\n  as elsewhere. Then too, one must always keep in mind febrile\r\n  manifestations not unrarely marking syphilis. This triad of\r\n  diseases, malaria, tuberculosis and syphilis, must always be\r\n  thought of, as well as septic conditions, when fever is present in\r\n  a disease typically afebrile.\r\n\r\nThere are certain exceptions in the above list which may be here\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n  _Beriberi._—There has been considerable discussion as to whether\r\n  a disease with fever and a rash, but otherwise resembling wet\r\n  beriberi, is the same disease or a distinct disease entity. The\r\n  fever in _epidemic dropsy_; as it is called, is rarely over 102°F.,\r\n  usually ranging from 99° to 101° and accompanying the dropsy.\r\n\r\n  _Pellagra._—While there may be slight variations from the normal\r\n  yet the ordinary case of pellagra fails to show a distinct febrile\r\n  course, so much so that the appearance of fever in a case of\r\n  pellagra makes for an unfavorable prognosis. In the so-called\r\n  typhoid pellagra, an acute, rapidly fatal form of the disease,\r\n  a high temperature curve may be obtained. At the same time this\r\n  condition has been noted by Italian and German writers as being\r\n  present in patients not showing any rise in temperature. It is\r\n  possible that the development of enteric fever in a pellagrin may\r\n  at times be the explanation of the fever.\r\n\r\n  _Cholera._—Instead of a favorable stage of reaction there may set\r\n  in a condition with low muttering delirium, dry brown tongue and\r\n  with an elevated temperature, the so-called typhoid state, which is\r\n  speedily fatal.\r\n\r\n  Rarely a rise of 3 or 4 degrees which does not last more than\r\n  forty-eight hours may be present in a stage of reaction going on to\r\n  a favorable convalescence.\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that the rectal temperature in the majority\r\n  of cases of cholera may show elevation of temperature approximating\r\n  100°F., while the axillary temperature may be as low as 95°F.\r\n  When there is a great difference between the rectal and axillary\r\n  temperatures, instead of the more common 4 or 5 degrees of a\r\n  typical case of cholera, the prognosis is bad. The temperature\r\n  taken by mouth may be as low as 86°F.\r\n\r\n  _Leprosy._—Among the prodromata of leprosy, along with epistaxis,\r\n  feeling of great weakness, somnolence and occasional sweats, there\r\n  may be recurring attacks of fever. These are at times diagnosed as\r\n  malarial manifestations. With the appearance of typical lesions\r\n  the course is apt to be nonfebrile with the exception that febrile\r\n  accessions often accompany the early macular manifestations.\r\n\r\n  _Amoebic Dysentery._—Unless complicated by hepatitis or some\r\n  bacterial infection of the amoebic lesions the disease progresses\r\n  without fever.\r\n\r\n  _Sprue._—While sprue is certainly one of the most typical of\r\n  afebrile diseases yet a form of sprue is recognized which begins as\r\n  an acute entero-colitis with fever. This must be most exceptional,\r\n  or only a coincidence, as sprue is characterized by a very\r\n  insidious onset.\r\n\r\n  _Ancylostomiasis._—The occasional reports of fever being present\r\n  are probably connected with bacterial infection at the site of\r\n  attachment of the hookworm.\r\n\r\n  _Filariasis._—There is a febrile manifestation of filarial disease\r\n  which is attended by rigors and high fever. This is a lymphangitis\r\n  which causes an erysipelatous appearance about the region involved.\r\n  It is these recurring attacks of lymphangitis which gradually\r\n  lead to the enormous thickening of the skin characteristic of\r\n  elephantiasis. Such attacks are designated _elephantoid fever_.\r\n  They are often diagnosed as malarial chills and in Barbadoes, where\r\n  there is no malaria, such attacks are called “ague.”\r\n\r\n  Lymph scrotum is the filarial condition in which elephantoid fever\r\n  is most frequently noted.\r\n\r\n  _Schistosomiasis._—In the vesical type of the disease we may have\r\n  as a complication a pyelitis which could give rise to febrile\r\n  manifestations. In Japanese schistosomiasis the disease sets in\r\n  with fever and urticaria. Before this combination of symptoms\r\n  was recognized as belonging to schistosomiasis we designated it\r\n  _urticarial fever_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 145.—General type of fever onset in the\r\n  various tropical diseases.]\r\n\r\n  _Malarial Cachexia._—Attacks of an irregular type of fever are\r\n  frequently noted in the malarial cachectic, especially setting in\r\n  upon some exposure to dampness or chilling, to alcoholic excesses\r\n  or to excessive fatigue. Cases are also met with in the tropics,\r\n  particularly among natives, where fever plays no apparent part in\r\n  the profound anaemia of these ague-cake victims. It is this absence\r\n  of fever which many consider the evidence of immunity to malaria in\r\n  the native with his anaemia and large spleen.\r\n\r\n  Such cases often show crescents in their blood and act as\r\n  reservoirs of virus for mosquito infection.\r\n\r\n  _Latent Malaria._—Following treatment, or even when quinine has\r\n  not been exhibited, cases of malaria often cease to show clinical\r\n  symptoms or even laboratory findings until a relapse develops\r\n  in case a cure has not been effected. As noted elsewhere, these\r\n  relapses, in which the febrile manifestations are prominent, often\r\n  follow exposure to tropical sunlight, wetting, etc. Besides such\r\n  frank manifestations, we may have numerous symptoms, that exhibit\r\n  periodicity, arising in the course of nonfebrile latent malaria.\r\n\r\n  _Yaws._—While fever of a more or less irregular type frequently\r\n  occurs at the onset of both primary and secondary stages,\r\n  especially just before the secondary general eruption, yet the\r\n  course of yaws as it runs over months or years is afebrile.\r\n\r\n  _Verruga._—The recent views as to verruga being a separate\r\n  condition, and not the secondary stage of a typhoid-like fever,\r\n  Carrion’s disease, removes from its clinical features the fever\r\n  characteristics generally noted.\r\n\r\n  =Diseases with Subnormal Temperatures.=—_There are certain\r\n  diseases in which marked lowering of the temperature may be a\r\n  feature of some stage._\r\n\r\n  The algid stage of _cholera_ is that which gives to cholera the\r\n  picture of a living death with the cadaveric features and icy\r\n  breath. Again in the choleraic type of _algid pernicious malaria_\r\n  we may have a subnormal temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.—General type of termination of the febrile\r\ncourse in the various tropical diseases.]\r\n\r\n  In infections with Shiga’s bacillus of _bacillary dysentery_ we may\r\n  have cases showing extreme toxaemia with algid manifestations and a\r\n  subnormal temperature.\r\n\r\n  During the last stages of _sleeping sickness_ a lowering of the\r\n  temperature is fairly constant.\r\n\r\n  In _heat prostration_ the temperature tends to be subnormal.\r\n  Clinically this condition with its pale clammy skin is just\r\n  the opposite of heat stroke with its turgid countenance and\r\n  hyperpyrexia.\r\n\r\n  In the _Indian type of relapsing fever_ we may have a fall to\r\n  subnormal temperatures at the time of the crisis of the first\r\n  paroxysm, often attended with manifestations of collapse.\r\n\r\n  _Sprue_ cases tend to run a subnormal temperature during the\r\n  terminal period.\r\n\r\n=Febrile Diseases.=—The diseases in which the presence of fever, in\r\nthe general course of the illness, is the rule, may be considered in\r\ntwo groups:\r\n\r\n1. Those in which the temperature chart is of prime importance in\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\n2. Those in which the character of the fever gives but little\r\nassistance in diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES IN WHICH THE TEMPERATURE CHART IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN\r\nDIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n_Benign Tertian and Quartan Malaria._—The presence of a fever of\r\ntertian or quartan periodicity is absolutely characteristic of\r\nmalaria. In rare cases however of meningococcus sepsis, without\r\ncerebral localization, we may have a tertian or even quartan\r\nperiodicity. Such cases are apt to show petechial spots and\r\nblood cultures give the diagnosis. There is also a polynuclear\r\nleukocytosis. As the result of the introduction by infected\r\nmosquitoes, on successive days, of two generations of malarial\r\nparasites in benign tertian or of three generations in quartan\r\nmalaria, a quotidian periodicity may obtain.\r\n\r\n  Such a type of fever is observed in tuberculosis, liver abscess\r\n  and various pyogenic infections. The rise of temperature in\r\n  benign tertian and quartan malaria takes place in about one-half\r\n  the cases somewhat early in the day, while the daily rise in\r\n  tuberculosis, septic conditions and liver abscess, is more apt\r\n  to occur in the evening, the evening rise being almost the rule\r\n  in such diseases. Hectic fevers generally show a less distinct\r\n  cycle of chill, hot stage and sweating than do the benign malarial\r\n  paroxysms. At the same time the enlarged spleen, presence of\r\n  parasites in the peripheral circulation and response to quinine are\r\n  diagnostic points in malaria which must always be thought of. When\r\n  quinine administration has caused the parasites to be temporarily\r\n  absent from the blood the increase of large mononuclears is very\r\n  suggestive.\r\n\r\n_Dengue._—In this disease the extremely sudden onset with a fever\r\nrising rapidly to 104°F. or more and remaining elevated for three or\r\nfive days, to fall by crisis to normal and, after an apyrexial period\r\nof one or two days, to be succeeded by a second febrile accession,\r\ngives a fever chart which is quite characteristic—_the saddle-back\r\nchart_.\r\n\r\n  The typical dengue eruption does not appear until towards the end\r\n  of the primary fever or about the commencement of the secondary\r\n  one. Intense postorbital soreness is a striking feature in dengue.\r\n  The comparative slowness of the pulse may be noted in dengue\r\n  as well as in yellow fever. Leucopenia and polymorphonuclear\r\n  percentage reduction are rather characteristic.\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fevers._—These fevers, when there are three or more\r\nrelapses, can perhaps be more easily diagnosed from the temperature\r\nchart alone than is the case with any other disease, excepting\r\nmalarial fevers showing tertian or quartan periodicity. With an\r\nabrupt rise of temperature, which remains elevated for from three\r\nto seven days and drops by crisis to normal, to be followed by\r\napproximately a week of normal temperature, with two or three\r\nrepetitions of the fever and apyretic intervals we have an extremely\r\ncharacteristic temperature chart.\r\n\r\n  Unlike malaria and yellow fever the onset is apt to be towards\r\n  evening rather than in the morning hours.\r\n\r\n  The spleen is apt to be enlarged during the pyrexia and less so\r\n  when the temperature is normal. The spirochaetes are to be searched\r\n  for while fever is present as they disappear from the peripheral\r\n  circulation during the apyretic intervals. In tick fever numerous\r\n  relapses are frequent in the European and less common in the native.\r\n\r\n_Malignant Tertian Malaria._—While benign malarial infections are\r\nmore common in temperate climates malignant tertian is the one which\r\nusually prevails in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  While the Italian designation of this type of fever as\r\n  aestivo-autumnal has more general acceptance yet Koch’s term,\r\n  tropical malaria, is eminently appropriate. The onset in malignant\r\n  tertian is rather insidious so that the case may be suspected\r\n  as one of typhoid fever. At the same time the first paroxysm is\r\n  apt to show a tertian periodicity while subsequent ones, by only\r\n  remitting, and not showing an intermission, give the temperature\r\n  picture of a continued fever in which periodicity is not easily\r\n  noted. At the same time a study of such a chart will probably\r\n  show that the curve tends to approach normal every other day.\r\n  The suggestion of periodicity is almost of as great value as the\r\n  actual drop to normal in the intermission. The remittent or even\r\n  continuous type of fever in malignant tertian tends to yield to an\r\n  intermittent one after a week or more of such fever.\r\n\r\nVery characteristic of malignant tertian paroxysms is that they set\r\nin with chilly sensations rather than a frank chill. It is for this\r\nreason that the so-called “dumb chill” is recognized as more serious\r\nthan the frank unmistakable chill.\r\n\r\nThe main feature of malignant tertian paroxysms is the pronounced and\r\nprolonged hot stage, which frequently lasts from twenty to thirty-six\r\nhours and may run over into the rising temperature connected with the\r\ndevelopment of the succeeding generation of parasites.\r\n\r\n  The terms anticipation and postponement are frequently used to\r\n  explain the drawn-out fever of this type of malaria.\r\n\r\n  There is great irregularity in time of development so that we get\r\n  the impression of completed cycle before the accepted forty-eight\r\n  hours as shown by a rising temperature within thirty-six\r\n  hours—anticipation; or, instead of showing indications of a\r\n  completion of cycle in forty-eight hours the fever still keeps\r\n  up—retardation.\r\n\r\n  The descent of the fever curve is much more gradual than the rise\r\n  at the onset of the paroxysm. The fine hair-like rings of the\r\n  tropical parasite are the only schizont stages usually found in the\r\n  peripheral blood. As the rings enlarge they fail to appear in the\r\n  peripheral blood so that blood examination at such times will be\r\n  negative. The finding of crescents is proof of a malignant tertian\r\n  infection.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that one is likely to fail to find parasites just\r\nbefore or just after a paroxysm search should particularly be made\r\nfor the pigment-carrying phagocyte—_the melaniferous leucocyte_.\r\n\r\n  In certain of the pernicious manifestations of malignant tertian,\r\n  especially the hyperpyrexial type of cerebral malaria, the\r\n  temperature may reach a very high degree, 107°F. to 110°F., and it\r\n  is often mistaken for sun stroke by one not familiar with the fact\r\n  that so-called sun stroke is often only this fatal form of malaria.\r\n\r\n  In algid pernicious malaria the axillary and, in particular, the\r\n  rectal temperature remain elevated even with a subnormal surface\r\n  temperature.\r\n\r\n  The infection in _latent malaria_ is most often a malignant\r\n  tertian one. Such cases often develop paroxysms following surgical\r\n  operations or at time of pregnancy or childbirth. Clark has\r\n  noted the abundance of parasites in smears from the placenta\r\n  taken at time of delivery when the peripheral blood showed few\r\n  or no parasites. Such an examination is of enormous value in\r\n  differentiating a malarial paroxysm from puerperal sepsis.\r\n\r\n_Malta Fever._—In this disease, in which the wave-like febrile\r\nperiods during every three or four weeks are so characteristic\r\nas to give it the name of “febris undulans,” there is a very\r\ninsidious onset. For a week or ten days the temperature climbs up\r\nstep-ladder-like and then descends in like manner to be followed by a\r\nfew days of apyrexia with succeeding similar relapses. The case would\r\nsuggest an attack of typhoid with relapses.\r\n\r\n  The course of the disease is attended by rather marked anaemia\r\n  and physical and mental depression. Very characteristic are\r\n  the fleeting joint pains which involve chiefly the knees, hip,\r\n  ankle and shoulder joints. There are pain and some swelling but\r\n  without redness. Neuralgic pains are also common. There is often\r\n  a bronchitis which, when associated with the rather common night\r\n  sweats of the disease, is suggestive of phthisis.\r\n\r\n  The cardiac muscle seems to be especially liable to the toxic\r\n  effects of the disease so that a weak heart and intermittent\r\n  pulse are often noted. It has a very protracted course of, on the\r\n  average, about four months.\r\n\r\nAn astonishing fact is that so severe and a prolonged fever should\r\ngive such a slight mortality (2%).\r\n\r\n  Occasionally, a case shows a high continued or remittent fever\r\n  and aggravated symptoms, going into a typhoid state. Such cases\r\n  are often fatal. There is an increase in the lymphocytes but no\r\n  increase in total leucocytes.\r\n\r\nThe wave course of the fever, with afebrile intervals and increasing\r\nanaemia, is suggestive of kala-azar, particularly when there is a\r\ngreater enlargement of the spleen than is usual in the disease.\r\nOrdinarily the splenic enlargement about corresponds to that of\r\ntyphoid fever but at times it may be so much enlarged as to suggest\r\nthe splenic tumor of kala-azar.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES IN WHICH FEVER IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE BUT GIVES LITTLE\r\nASSISTANCE IN DIAGNOSIS\r\n\r\n_Kala-azar._—This disease has a peculiarly insidious onset because,\r\nwith a fairly high remittent fever, it may cause but slight feeling\r\nof illness in the patient.\r\n\r\nRogers insists upon the importance of taking the temperature every\r\nfour hours so that one may note the fact of there being _two distinct\r\nrises_ in the twenty-four hours instead of the single evening rise of\r\ntyphoid fever.\r\n\r\n  At first it is confused with malaria as well as typhoid. The spleen\r\n  becomes greatly enlarged by the third or fourth month and later\r\n  on we also have enlargement of the liver. Periods of fever and\r\n  apyrexia occur irregularly and over a period of months or even\r\n  longer than a year.\r\n\r\n  There is a marked leucopenia and the presence of the\r\n  leishman-donovan bodies, often in huge numbers, in the juice from\r\n  spleen or liver puncture, makes for a certain diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Fever._—With a sudden onset and rapidly rising fever, which\r\noften occurs in the early morning hours, in a patient who has gone\r\nto bed feeling well, we have a markedly congested face and neck\r\nwith injected conjunctivae and intense headache and backache. The\r\nfever tends to remain elevated for about three days after which\r\nthere may be noted a fall in temperature or even an intermission.\r\nThis, which has been termed the period of calm, is often slight and\r\nof short duration. About this time the jaundice and haemorrhages\r\nshow themselves and the temperature tends again to rise although\r\nless marked than with the sthenic fever of the first two or three\r\ndays. Of great importance is the fact that the pulse rate falls\r\nwith a maintained temperature or does not increase in rate as the\r\ntemperature rises (_Faget’s law_). A very slow pulse is quite\r\ncharacteristic of yellow fever after the third day.\r\n\r\n  Important in the diagnosis of yellow fever from bilous remittent\r\n  fever and blackwater fever is the absence of splenic enlargement\r\n  in the former. In particular must it be remembered that jaundice\r\n  does not show itself in yellow fever until about the third day,\r\n  following which we may have bleeding from the gums and black vomit.\r\n\r\n  Melaena and haematuria may also be noted. The presence of a marked\r\n  albuminuria is one of the leading characteristics of yellow fever.\r\n\r\n_Blackwater Fever._—The onset is usually quite sudden with a rather\r\nsevere chill and marked lumbar pain.\r\n\r\nThe temperature rises rapidly to about 104°F. and may fall in a few\r\nhours to a point but little above normal accompanied by profuse\r\nsweating. The fall in temperature is not followed by a feeling\r\nof improvement. On the other hand there may be a fever course of\r\nremittent or even continuous type. That which is most characteristic\r\nand which in the majority of cases enables the patient to make his\r\nown diagnosis is the passage of dark or porter-colored urine.\r\n\r\n  The urinary sediment is simply granular débris, there are no intact\r\n  red cells. It is a haemoglobinuria and not a haematuria. If there\r\n  is any blood in the urine in yellow fever it is in the form of a\r\n  haematuria. The urine in both blackwater fever and yellow fever\r\n  is highly albuminous. In some cases the haemoglobinuria seems to\r\n  result from quinine administration alone, in which case there is\r\n  not the high fever of typical blackwater fever. As distinguishing\r\n  it from yellow fever we have a marked jaundice which comes on in\r\n  a few hours or even with the first appearance of haemoglobinuria\r\n  instead of being delayed until the third day, as in yellow fever.\r\n  Again, the blackwater paroxysm is intensely prostrating, it is\r\n  markedly asthenic, while the onset of yellow fever is quite sthenic\r\n  in character. The enlarged tender spleen of blackwater fever is\r\n  also a prominent feature, which is absent in yellow fever. Bilious\r\n  vomiting is an early and severe feature of blackwater fever but not\r\n  the black vomit of yellow fever which does not come on until after\r\n  the third day.\r\n\r\n  The jaundice of bilious remittent fever does not appear before the\r\n  second day and the urine shows bile pigments instead of haemoglobin.\r\n\r\n_Plague._—The fever rapidly rises, so that the maximum temperature\r\nof 104°F. or more may be attained on the first day of the disease.\r\nIn general the type of fever is continuous with a rather marked\r\nremission about the third day, following which, the fever again goes\r\nup with the appearance of the glandular involvement (bubonic plague).\r\n\r\n  In fatal cases the temperature may shoot up just prior to death.\r\n  The drawn anxious countenance, the mental state and speech as of\r\n  one suffering from alcoholic intoxication, and the early cardiac\r\n  involvement, with very weak and irregular pulse, give one a clue to\r\n  plague even before the buboes appear. Smears and cultures from the\r\n  buboes make the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIn _plague pneumonia_ there is nothing characteristic about the\r\nrather continuous fever which sets in suddenly and continues elevated\r\nuntil death, which generally occurs about the third or fourth day.\r\nThe marked mental involvement, the extreme illness of the patient,\r\nwith but slight physical signs of the involvement of the lungs,\r\nshould make one suspect a plague pneumonia during an epidemic. The\r\nabundant, rather watery sputum, which later becomes sanguineous,\r\ngives us a diagnosis by reason of its being loaded with bipolarly\r\nstained plague bacilli. This material should be rubbed on the shaven\r\nabdomen of a guinea pig to make the diagnosis absolutely sure.\r\n\r\n  In _septicaemic plague_, if such be considered a distinct\r\n  type, there is very little that is manifest except a fever in\r\n  a profoundly ill person. The powers of resistance may be so\r\n  overwhelmed that the temperature response is slight and the chart\r\n  not show temperature records above 100°F. or 101°F. Blood cultures\r\n  make for the diagnosis in septicaemic plague.\r\n\r\n_Typhus Fever._—While the classical temperature chart is usually\r\ndescribed as one with a rapid rise, reaching the maximum of 103° or\r\n104° by the second day, with a fastigium of twelve to fourteen days,\r\nfollowed by a critical fall, yet many cases recently observed in the\r\nBalkans show a fairly gradual onset with a fall by lysis.\r\n\r\n  A stuporous condition with, about the fifth day, a rash first\r\n  appearing about abdomen and flanks, to soon become petechial, are\r\n  important in diagnosis. There is a leucocytosis with marked acid\r\n  staining of the granules of the polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosomiasis._—The fever of trypanosomiasis is markedly\r\nirregular and may exist in natives without preventing them from\r\ncarrying on their duties as porters. The onset is on the whole\r\ninsidious.\r\n\r\n  In this first stage of trypanosomiasis or _trypanosome fever_,\r\n  when trypanosomes are found only in the glands and peripheral\r\n  circulation, what may probably be considered as leading\r\n  peculiarities of the fever are the great daily oscillations, a\r\n  normal morning temperature being succeeded by an evening rise up to\r\n  102°F. or 104°F.\r\n\r\nWhile the febrile course is usual in Europeans it is often absent\r\nin natives. With them the febrile manifestations are noted in the\r\nsleeping sickness stage.\r\n\r\n  Again a very rapid, low tension pulse is present, whether the\r\n  temperature be low or high. These febrile accessions are followed\r\n  by apyrexial intervals.\r\n\r\nExtremely important in diagnosis are the glandular enlargements\r\nof which those of the upper posterior cervical triangle are the\r\nmost characteristic (Winterbottom’s sign). Gland juice is more\r\napt to contain trypanosomes than the smear from the blood. Deep\r\nhyperaesthesia is also a very characteristic symptom (Kérandel’s\r\nsign).\r\n\r\n  When the trypanosomes are found in the cerebro-spinal fluid we have\r\n  the second stage of trypanosomiasis or that of _sleeping sickness_.\r\n  This is ushered in by a tremor of the tongue and mental symptoms\r\n  of great apathy and listlessness. An irregular fever is present\r\n  at times during the course of this stage of sleeping sickness\r\n  but toward the end of the disease the temperature tends to be\r\n  subnormal.\r\n\r\n  Progressive weakness and emaciation with finally a comatose state\r\n  are features of the terminal weeks.\r\n\r\n_Brazilian Trypanosomiasis._—The disease begins acutely in young\r\nchildren with an irregular remittent fever. The parasites are not\r\napt to be found except during the fever. The lymphatic glands become\r\nswollen. With repeated accessions of fever, followed by apyrexial\r\nintervals, the child becomes weaker and more anaemic. The spleen is\r\nenlarged. This infection is very fatal for children.\r\n\r\n  In adults the disease tends to assume a chronic type and often,\r\n  from involvement of the thyroid, gives symptoms of myxoedema.\r\n\r\n_Bacillary Dysentery._—The onset may be quite sudden and the\r\ntemperature rise to 102°F. or 103°F. There is apt to be some evidence\r\nof toxaemia as shown by headache, slight flightiness and gastric\r\nupset. The dysenteric stool is of a whitish, mucopurulent appearance\r\nand flecked or streaked with blood rather than showing the uniformly\r\nbrownish or greenish gelatinous material of amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  In very severe bacillary dysentery algidity may come on with a\r\n  cold clammy skin, reminding one of cholera. At such times the\r\n  temperature is subnormal.\r\n\r\n_Liver Abscess._—In the so-called pre-suppurative stage of amoebic\r\nhepatitis the only symptom may be an irregular remittent fever of\r\nmoderate degree. This and a leucocytosis may be the only points noted.\r\n\r\n  In fully developed liver abscess we have a painful liver which is\r\n  enlarged upward often with pain referred to the right shoulder\r\n  and a crepitation at the base of the right lung. The fever is\r\n  distinctly hectic in type with an evening rise and associated with\r\n  profuse sweatings. The evening rise of temperature does not usually\r\n  tend to exceed 102°F. and apyrexial intervals are frequently\r\n  observed in the fever chart.\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that liver abscess has been found at autopsy\r\n  where fever had not been noted. A sensation of chilliness often\r\n  accompanies the evening rise of temperature.\r\n\r\n_Heat stroke._—The onset may be as sudden as in apoplexy, although\r\nthere are usually prodromata of dizziness and headache. The patient\r\nis unconscious with dry burning skin, labored or stertorous\r\nbreathing, and a temperature of from 107° to 111°F.\r\n\r\n  The hyperpyrexial malarial paroxysm presents much in common with\r\n  heat stroke.\r\n\r\n_Climatic Fevers._—From many parts of the tropical world there\r\nhave been reported cases of fever supposed to be due to exposure to\r\nprolonged action of tropical heat. They are often designated as\r\nclimatic or inflammatory fevers.\r\n\r\n  A careful study of the clinical manifestations tends to show that\r\n  many of them are much like dengue. Some may be due to infection\r\n  with the Gärtner group of bacteria.\r\n\r\n_Rat Bite Disease._—Following a rather long incubation period of\r\nfrom six to eight weeks, during which time the bite has healed,\r\nwe have a rather sudden invasion with high fever, 103° to 104°F.,\r\nchill and at the same time inflammation of the site of the bite with\r\nlymphangitis and some swelling of tributary glands.\r\n\r\n  After two or three days of high fever we have a fall by crisis\r\n  with profuse perspiration. The temperature remains normal for a\r\n  few days during which time the local swelling and inflammation\r\n  subside. The fever again comes on, frequently with an eruption, to\r\n  later on disappear and reappear. At such times the fever course is\r\n  irregular. There may be as many as 12 of these febrile accessions.\r\n\r\n_Tsutsugamushi._—The disease sets in about a week after the bite\r\nof the Kedani mite with headache, chills and fever of about 101°F.\r\nThere is also pain in certain lymphatic gland groups which will be\r\nfound to drain the area in which is located a small necrotic ulcer,\r\nthe site of the bite of the mite. The temperature continues to rise\r\nduring the next two or three days to 104°-105°F. and remains as a\r\nhigh continuous fever for about a week, when an eruption of irregular\r\ndusky macules appears, first on the face and later on chest,\r\nextremities and trunk. About the tenth day the fever begins to go\r\ndown by lysis and the eruption fades. Injection of the conjunctivae\r\nis marked.\r\n\r\n  Certain authorities have considered that there is a striking\r\n  clinical similarity and possible relation attaching to\r\n  tsutsugamushi, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, trench fever and\r\n  typhus fever. At present we believe that tabardillo or Mexican\r\n  typhus is the same as the well-known typhus of temperate climates,\r\n  hence that which describes typhus fever obtains for tabardillo.\r\n\r\n  _Spotted Fever of the Rocky Mountains._—In tabardillo the onset\r\n  and termination of the fever is rather abrupt while in spotted\r\n  fever of the Rocky Mountains it climbs up gradually for a week to\r\n  reach its maximum and falls by lysis.\r\n\r\n  All these diseases are characterized by a more or less stuporous\r\n  state.\r\n\r\n_Oroya Fever._—It was formerly supposed that this fever was the\r\nfirst stage of verruga, but it is now considered as a distinct\r\ndisease entity, caused by a protozoon of bacillary form which invades\r\nthe red cells. With pains of various joints and bones we have a\r\ngradual rise of temperature which after a few days reaches 103° to\r\n104°F. and tends to become remittent or continuous.\r\n\r\n  There is a remarkable and excessive destruction of the red cells\r\n  which may fall to a million or less per c.mm. The fever after about\r\n  three weeks begins to fall by lysis. Enlargement of liver, spleen\r\n  and lymphatic glands are common. Pain over the bones, especially\r\n  the sternum, is often excruciating.\r\n\r\n_Epidemic jaundice_ shows an irregular pyrexia of from 102° to 103°F.\r\nwith jaundice about the second or third day.\r\n\r\n_Trench Fever._—Cases of varying types of fever, some charts more or\r\nless resembling the dengue ones, while others show repeated relapses\r\nof short duration, have been designated _trench fever_.\r\n\r\nIn _tularaemia_ we have an irregular fever course of rather rapid\r\nonset, extending over two or three weeks. There is very little\r\nevidence of toxaemia. Convalescence is tedious.\r\n\r\n_Typhoid fever_ and the _paratyphoid infections_ are far from\r\nuncommon in the tropics and present clinical courses at variance with\r\nthose observed in temperate climates. The temperature charts in such\r\ncases are irregular and atypical.\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that paratyphoid infections may show marked\r\n  gastro-intestinal symptoms and that the rose rash of such cases\r\n  tends to be far more profuse than that of typhoid.\r\n\r\n_Intestinal Parasites._—There are many conditions which seem to\r\nbe productive of febrile attacks as evidenced by the disappearance\r\nof the fever upon removing such cause. Thus patients presenting\r\nabdominal distress and a fever of varying type may be completely\r\nrelieved of all symptoms upon evacuating the larvae of various flies\r\nfollowing purgation. This condition is designated intestinal myiasis.\r\n\r\n  Abdominal pains and fever may also be caused by various helminths\r\n  usually considered nonsymptom-producing as has been noted in heavy\r\n  _Ascaris_ infections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nBLOOD EXAMINATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a short chapter on such a large subject only the more important\r\nmethods and findings can be considered. As regards interpretation\r\nof blood findings in various tropical diseases one may note in\r\nthe recent work of Schilling-Torgau the difficulties which at\r\npresent beset the subject. Until some universal agreement as to\r\nstandard methods of technique and in particular complete accord as\r\nto the characteristics of the diagnostic cells can be arrived at,\r\nconflicting reports as to findings must of necessity be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn taking up this subject it has seemed convenient to divide it into\r\n4 heads: (1) The microscopical examination of fresh preparations or\r\nstained blood smears; (2) blood culture methods; (3) serological\r\nexaminations, and (4) other practical methods of haematological study.\r\n\r\n  In the companion volume on laboratory work I have endeavored to\r\n  take up rather in detail the various methods and techniques but in\r\n  this chapter I shall only give single methods or point out short\r\n  cuts in well-recognized ones or make suggestions as to new methods\r\n  of blood study which may eventually aid us in diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  Those who work in temperate climates cannot realize the\r\n  difficulties which beset the tropical laboratory worker from the\r\n  lack of proper assistance, damaging effects of heat and moisture on\r\n  stains and media and, of greater importance, the impairment of that\r\n  driving energy so necessary for the carrying out of complicated\r\n  methods. A short and simple method has a far greater value in the\r\n  tropics than at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\nTo obtain blood, except for blood cultures, use either a\r\nplatino-iridium hypodermic needle which can be sterilized in the\r\nflame, a small tenotome, or a surgical needle with cutting edge.\r\n\r\n  Needles should be sterilized by boiling since flaming dulls the\r\n  edge. A steel pen with one nib broken off or the glass needle of\r\n  Wright may also be used. To make a glass needle, pull straight\r\n  apart a piece of capillary tubing in a very small flame. Tap the\r\n  fine point to break off the very delicate extremity. Scarcely any\r\n  pain attends the use of such a needle. In puncturing either the tip\r\n  of the finger or lobe of the ear a quick piano-touch-like stroke\r\n  should be used. The ear is preferable, as it is less sensitive\r\n  and there is less danger of infection. Before puncturing, the\r\n  skin should be cleaned with 70% alcohol and allowed to dry. It is\r\n  advisable to sterilize the needle before using it.\r\n\r\n  Note that in order to secure in the specimen a cell count that\r\n  corresponds to that obtaining in the circulation as a whole it\r\n  is necessary to massage the ear vigorously prior to making the\r\n  puncture. Subsequently there should be no manipulation of the part,\r\n  the blood examined being that which exudes freely. This procedure\r\n  renders more likely the finding of blood parasites.\r\n\r\nThe first drop of blood which exudes should be taken up on the\r\npaper of the Tallquist haemoglobinometer, using subsequent ones\r\nfor the blood pipettes and smears. If it is necessary to make a\r\ncomplete examination, it is rather difficult to draw up the blood\r\nin the pipettes, dilute it, and then get material for fresh blood\r\npreparations and films without undue squeezing, which is to be\r\navoided. Of course, fresh punctures can be made. Ordinarily, complete\r\nblood examinations are not called for. It is only a white count or a\r\ndifferential count or an examination for malaria that is required.\r\n\r\n  As a practical point it is very rare that a red count is indicated.\r\n  There is one point not sufficiently recognized by physicians and\r\n  that is that a routine blood examination is not apt to be as\r\n  carefully conducted as one calling for a specific feature. Without\r\n  disparaging the necessity of routine examination of urine as well\r\n  as blood it is a fact that the internist who knows what he wants\r\n  gets better results from the laboratory man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF FRESH PREPARATIONS OR STAINED BLOOD\r\nSMEARS\r\n\r\nAs regards haemocytometry it may be stated that in the tropics the\r\ncounting of red cells is required more frequently in comparison to\r\nwhite ones than is the case in temperate climates where probably 100\r\nwhite counts are necessitated as against 1 red count. This is on\r\naccount of the frequency of secondary anaemias in the tropics.\r\n\r\n  The idea that time may be saved by making a white and red count\r\n  from the same preparation is not borne out practically so that it\r\n  is better to make white and red counts separately.\r\n\r\n  As a diluting fluid for red counts a normal salt solution,\r\n  preferably about 0.9%, answers perfectly and if desired may be\r\n  tinged with neutral red, methyl green or gentian violet to bring\r\n  out white cells. When available, however, I prefer a 2½% aqueous\r\n  solution of potassium bichromate for red cell counts.\r\n\r\n  =Rulings.=—The most desirable rulings are those of Türck, Zappert\r\n  and Neubauer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.—Neubauer’s ruling.]\r\n\r\n  In these the entire ruled surface consists of nine large squares,\r\n  each 1 mm. square. These are subdivided, and in the central large\r\n  square are to be found the small squares used for averaging the\r\n  red cells. These small squares are 1/20 mm. square and are arranged\r\n  in nine groups of 16 small squares by bordering triple-ruled lines.\r\n  As the unit in blood counting is the cubic millimeter, if one\r\n  counted all the white cells lying within one of the large squares\r\n  (1 mm. square), he would have only counted the cells in a layer\r\n  one-tenth of the required depth, so that it would be necessary to\r\n  multiply the number obtained by 10. This product, multiplied by\r\n  the dilution of the blood, would give the number of white cells in\r\n  a cubic millimeter of undiluted blood. The Neubauer ruling is the\r\n  most satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.—Thoma-Levy counting chamber, Bürker double\r\ntype with two Neubauer rulings.]\r\n\r\n  =Bürker Haemacytometer.=—Some workers prefer the _Bürker\r\n  haemacytometer_. In this there are two ruled wedge-shaped pieces of\r\n  glass, separated at their bases, which take the place of the ruled\r\n  disc of the Thoma apparatus. Two oblong pieces of glass are on\r\n  either side of the ruled wedges and are 0.1 mm. higher, thus taking\r\n  the place of the shelf. Clamps fix a cover-glass on these shelves\r\n  giving a space 1/10 mm. over the ruled surfaces. The blood is run\r\n  in by capillarity from the mixing pipette. I gave up this type of\r\n  counter because the clamps made manipulation awkward.\r\n\r\n  =Thoma-Levy Chamber.=—In the Thoma-Levy modification of the Bürker\r\n  apparatus the central portion of the slide is cut away and in this\r\n  depression is cemented a rectangular strip of glass, divided by a\r\n  central channel. Each half of this strip of glass has a Neubauer\r\n  ruling on it so that one can make a white count on one side and a\r\n  red one on the other, simply touching the tip of the red pipette\r\n  to the space separating the under surface of the cover-glass from\r\n  the ruled rectangular slips on one side and then with the white\r\n  pipette repeating the same on the other side. An advantage of the\r\n  Thoma-Levy is that the original thickness of the slide makes the\r\n  shelf on which the cover-glass rests instead of the support being\r\n  strips on either side of the ruled surfaces and cemented to the\r\n  slide. The Neubauer ruling is undoubtedly the most satisfactory of\r\n  the haemacytometer rulings, its rulings being simpler than those of\r\n  the Türck system. The unit square in all these haemacytometers is\r\n  the small square for counting red blood cells, 1/20 mm. square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.—The Türck ruling. Thoma-Zeiss\r\nHaemacytometer.]\r\n\r\n  =To Make a Red Count.=—Having a fairly large drop of blood,\r\n  apply the tip of the 101 pipette to it and, holding the pipette\r\n  horizontal, carefully and slowly draw up with suction on the rubber\r\n  tube a column of blood to exactly 0.5. The variation of 1/25 of an\r\n  inch from the mark would make a difference of almost 3%. If the\r\n  column goes above 0.5, it can be gently tapped down on a piece of\r\n  filter-paper until the 0.5 line is cut. Now insert the tip of the\r\n  pipette into some diluting fluid, and revolving the pipette on its\r\n  long axis while filling it by suction, you continue until the mark\r\n  101 is reached.\r\n\r\n  A variation of 1/25 of an inch at this mark would only give an\r\n  error of about 1/30 of 1%. This gives a 1-200 dilution. After\r\n  mixing thoroughly by shaking for one or two minutes, the fluid\r\n  in the pipette below the bulb is expelled (this of course is\r\n  only diluting fluid). A drop of the diluted blood of a size just\r\n  sufficient to cover the disc when the cover-glass is adjusted, is\r\n  then deposited on the disc and the cover-glass applied by a sort\r\n  of sliding movement, best obtained by using forceps in one hand\r\n  assisted by the thumb and index-finger of the other.\r\n\r\n  In red counts we use exclusively the small 1/20 mm. squares which\r\n  are in groups of 16 bounded by triple-ruled lines.\r\n\r\n  The depth of fluid over the ruled surface is 1/10 mm., hence each\r\n  of these small squares is 1/10 × 1/20 × 1/20 = 1/4000 of a c.mm.,\r\n  so that it takes 4000 such spaces to equal the unit for blood\r\n  counting (1 c.mm.). My practice in making red counts is to count\r\n  the red cells in five of the groups of 16 small squares. This in\r\n  normal blood is about 100 for the 16 squares. After counting 5\r\n  groups of 16 we have counted the red cells of 80 small squares\r\n  which is 1/50 of 4000 (the number in the 1 c.mm. unit). For this\r\n  reason 50 × 200 (the blood dilution) = 10,000, so that it is only\r\n  necessary to multiply the number of red cells found in 5 groups of\r\n  16 small squares by 10,000 in order to obtain the number of red\r\n  cells per c.mm. For more accurate determination the process can be\r\n  repeated with a second or third drop of the diluted blood, which\r\n  would give an average from 160 or from 240 small squares.\r\n\r\n  =To Count White Cells.=—Draw up the blood in the white pipette\r\n  to the 0.5 line. Then, still holding the pipette as near the\r\n  horizontal as possible, because the column of blood tends to fall\r\n  down in the larger bore, draw up by suction a diluting fluid which\r\n  will disintegrate the red cells without injuring the whites. The\r\n  best fluid is 0.5% of glacial acetic acid in water. This makes the\r\n  white cells stand out as highly refractile bodies. Some prefer to\r\n  tinge the fluid with neutral red or gentian violet. The 0.5 mark is\r\n  preferred because it takes a very large drop of blood to fill the\r\n  tube up to the 1 mark and if there is much of a leucocytosis a 1 to\r\n  10 dilution is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n  The blood having been drawn up to 0.5, we have a dilution of 1 to\r\n  20.\r\n\r\n  Making a preparation, exactly as was done in the case of the red\r\n  count, we count all of the white cells in one of the large squares\r\n  (1 sq. mm.). The cross ruling greatly facilitates this. Note the\r\n  number. Then count a second and a third square. Strike an average\r\n  of the large squares counted and multiply this by 10, as the depth\r\n  of the fluid gives a content equal to only 1/10 of a c.mm. Then\r\n  multiply by the dilution.\r\n\r\n  EXAMPLE.—First large square 50; second large square 70; third\r\n  large square 60. Average 60. Then 60 × 10 × 20 = 12,000, the number\r\n  of leucocytes in 1 c.mm. of blood. In order to save time the count\r\n  is preferably made with a low power (⅔-inch objective) as the\r\n  leucocytes stand out like pearls. It is more accurate, however,\r\n  to use a higher power, so that pieces of foreign material may be\r\n  recognized and not enumerated as white cells.\r\n\r\nIf one will accustom himself to comparing the distribution of\r\nthe leucocytes in a well-made stained dried-blood film, prepared\r\naccording to Ehrlich’s cover-glass method, with that in a\r\nhaemacytometer preparation, he can readily acquire an experience\r\nwhich will enable him to determine with considerable accuracy the\r\ndegree of leucocytosis by the examination of a stained, cover-glass\r\npreparation alone.\r\n\r\n  After making a blood count, the haemacytometer slide should be\r\n  cleaned with soap and water and then rubbed dry, preferably with\r\n  an old piece of linen. As the accuracy of the counting chamber\r\n  depends upon the integrity of the cement, any reagent such as\r\n  alcohol, xylol, etc., and in particular, heat, will ruin the\r\n  instrument. The pipettes should be cleaned by inserting the ends\r\n  into the tube from a vacuum pump, as a Chapman pump. First draw\r\n  water or 1% sod. carbonate solution through the pipette, then\r\n  alcohol, then ether, and finally allow air to pass through to dry\r\n  the interior. If the interior is stained, used 1% HCL in alcohol.\r\n  If a vacuum pump is not at hand, a bicycle pump or suction by mouth\r\n  will answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF FRESH BLOOD\r\n\r\nMany authorities prefer a fresh blood specimen to a stained dried\r\nsmear in the study of parasites of the blood. In malaria in\r\nparticular there is so much information as to species to be obtained\r\nfrom a fresh specimen that the employment of this method should never\r\nbe neglected. While waiting for the film to stain one has five or six\r\nminutes which could not be better spent than in examining the fresh\r\nspecimen which only requires a moment to make.\r\n\r\n  =Manson’s Method.=—Have a perfectly clean cover-glass and slide.\r\n  Touch the apex of the exuding drop of blood with the cover-glass\r\n  and drop it on the center of the slide. The blood flows out in a\r\n  film which exhibits an “empty zone” in the center. Surrounding this\r\n  we have the “zone of scattered corpuscles,” next the “single layer\r\n  zone” and the “zone of rouleaux” at the periphery. It is well to\r\n  ring the preparation with vaseline. When desiring to demonstrate\r\n  the flagellated bodies in malaria, it is well to breathe on the\r\n  cover-glass just prior to touching the drop of blood.\r\n\r\n  =The Method of Ross= is very easy of application and gives most\r\n  satisfactory preparations. Take a perfectly clean slide, and make\r\n  a vaseline ring or square of the size of the cover-glass. Then,\r\n  having taken up the blood on the cover-glass, drop it so that\r\n  its margin rests on the vaseline ring. Gently pressing down the\r\n  cover-glass on the vaseline makes beautiful preparations which\r\n  keep for a very long time. If it is desired to study the action\r\n  of stains on living cells, this method is also applicable. A very\r\n  practical way to do this is to tinge 0.85% salt solution containing\r\n  1% sodium citrate (the same as is used in opsonic work) with\r\n  methylene azur, gentian violet, or methyl green. With a capillary\r\n  bulb pipette, take up one part of blood, then one part of tinted\r\n  salt solution. Mix them quickly on a slide and then deposit a\r\n  small drop of the mixture in the center of the vaseline ring and\r\n  immediately apply a cover-glass and press down the margins as\r\n  before. This method will be found of great practical value.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND STAINING OF DRIED FILMS\r\n\r\nWhen preparations are desired for a differential count, Ehrlich’s\r\nmethod of making films is to be preferred, as the different types\r\nof leukocytes are more evenly distributed. In making smears by\r\nspreading, there is a tendency for the polymorphonuclears to be\r\nconcentrated at the margin while lymphocytes remain in the central\r\npart of the film.\r\n\r\n  =Cover-slip Films.=—In _Ehrlich’s method_ we have perfectly clean\r\n  dry cover-slips. Take up a small drop of blood without touching the\r\n  surface of the ear or finger. Drop this cover-glass immediately on\r\n  a second one and as soon as the blood runs out in a film, draw the\r\n  two cover-slips apart in a plane parallel to the cover-glasses.\r\n  Ehrlich uses forceps to hold the cover-glasses to avoid moisture\r\n  from the fingers, but I find I can work more quickly and\r\n  satisfactorily with the fingers alone. The method shown in Fig. 150\r\n  is a very convenient one. In making malarial smears it is better to\r\n  wash the finger or ear with soap and water to get rid of all grease\r\n  and dirt. Then dry thoroughly before puncturing. Alcohol is not so\r\n  efficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.—1, 2, 3, 4, Making blood smears on slide.\r\n5. Smear ready for staining—grease marks prevent Wright stain\r\nfrom running over slide. 6. U-shaped glass tubing to hold slide in\r\nstaining. 7. Right hand holding two cover-glasses.

Separating cover-glasses by sliding one from the\r\nother.]\r\n\r\n  Slides and spreaders should be absolutely clean and grease-free.\r\n  Scrubbing with soap and water, thorough rinsing and drying, then\r\n  subjecting the slide to the flame to make it grease-free is\r\n  satisfactory.\r\n\r\n  For removing dirt and grease from skin, a mixture of acetone, 40;\r\n  alcohol, 60; is the best and quickest means. A bottle is kept on\r\n  hand, with the puncturing needle embedded in the stopper.\r\n\r\n  For cleaning a slide, nothing equals Bon Ami. Rub up some with the\r\n  wet finger, rub the slide with the lather until there is a friction\r\n  squeak; let dry; polish with a clean, dry cloth. This is far\r\n  better than soap and water, alcohol, ether and flaming combined.\r\n  Note how a drop of water spreads on a glass so treated.\r\n\r\n=Smears on Slides.=—Of the various methods of spreading films on\r\nslides, that described by Daniels is quite satisfactory. In this the\r\ndrop of blood is drawn along and not pushed along. The films are\r\neven, can be made of any desired thickness by changing the angle\r\nof the drawing slide, and there is little liability of crushing\r\npathological cells. Take a small drop of blood on the end of a clean\r\nslide. Touch a second slide, about ½ inch from end, with the drop and\r\nas soon as the blood runs out along the line of the slide end, slide\r\nit at an angle of 45° to the other end of the horizontal slide. The\r\nblood is pulled or drawn behind the advancing edge of the advancing\r\nslide. An angle less than 45° makes a thinner film; one greater, a\r\nthicker film.\r\n\r\n  Instead of a slide a square cover-glass may be used and if the edge\r\n  be smooth it makes a more satisfactory spreader than the slide.\r\n\r\n  Instead of the Daniels method I prefer to take up the drop of blood\r\n  on the slide on which the smear is to be made, about ½ inch from\r\n  the end. Then apply the spreader slide and so soon as the drop runs\r\n  along the end of the spreader slide proceed as above described.\r\n  This method is shown in Fig. 150.\r\n\r\n  =Spreaders.=—Of the various methods of making smears by means of\r\n  cigarette paper, rubber tissue, needles, etc., the best seems to be\r\n  to take a piece of capillary glass tubing and use this instead of a\r\n  needle in making the film. There is one advantage about the strip\r\n  of cigarette paper touched to the drop of blood and drawn out along\r\n  the slide or cover-glass, and that is that it is almost impossible\r\n  not to make a working preparation by this method.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICK-FILM METHODS\r\n\r\n  Such methods are of the greatest practical value in searching\r\n  for malarial parasites when they are in very small numbers in\r\n  the peripheral circulation, in finding trypanosomes, relapsing\r\n  fever spirochaetes and filarial embryos. Ruge’s method so brings\r\n  out the polymorphonuclears that such a technic can be used for\r\n  opsonic index. Many workers prefer the _Ross thick-film method_ in\r\n  examining for malaria. In this about one-half of a drop of blood\r\n  is smeared out over a surface about equal to that of a square\r\n  cover-glass and allowed to dry. It is then flooded with 1/10\r\n  of 1% aqueous solution of eosin for about fifteen minutes. The\r\n  preparation is then gently washed with water and then treated with\r\n  a polychrome methylene-blue solution. After a few seconds this is\r\n  carefully washed off and the preparation dried and examined.\r\n\r\n  James smears out an ordinary drop of blood so that it makes a\r\n  circular smear about ¾ inch in diameter. This may be easily\r\n  accomplished with a spatulate toothpick. When dry, treat the blood\r\n  smear with alcohol containing HCl (Alcohol 50 cc., HCl 10 drops)\r\n  until the haemoglobin is dissolved out. Then wash thoroughly in\r\n  water for five or ten minutes. Allow to dry and then stain as\r\n  ordinarily with the Wright or Giemsa stain.\r\n\r\n=Ruge’s Method.=—The best thick-film method is that of Ruge. After\r\nthe blood has dried well gently move the slide about in a glass\r\ncontaining a 2% solution of formalin to which has been added 1%\r\nof glacial acetic acid. After laking is completed, as shown by\r\ndisappearance of brown color, treat the slide in the same way in a\r\nglass of tap water to remove all traces of acid. Next wash gently\r\nin distilled water and stain with dilute Giemsa (1 drop to 1 cc. of\r\nwater) for twenty to thirty minutes. Wash in water and allow to dry\r\nwithout heat or blotting paper. Some workers prefer to stain the\r\ndried thick smear for one hour in a jar containing dilute Giemsa\r\nstain (1 to 40) without previous fixation or dehaemoglobinization. At\r\npresent, I make my thick films by taking up a large loopful from the\r\nexuding drop of the puncture wound.\r\n\r\nThis is deposited at one end of the slide and from it three or four\r\nmore daubs are made in succession toward the other end of the slide.\r\nThese daubs are quickly smeared out before coagulation takes place in\r\nthe first daub.\r\n\r\n  With all thick-film methods it is extremely important to have\r\n  thorough drying of the smear before dehaemoglobinizing or staining.\r\n  This ordinarily requires one or two hours in the air or twenty to\r\n  thirty minutes in the incubator. It is particularly important in\r\n  working with such smears, although holding for ordinary smears, to\r\n  protect them from flies, ants, etc., as such insects will eat up\r\n  the smear in a few minutes if left exposed.\r\n\r\n  =Fixation of Film.=—In Wright’s, Leishman’s, and other similar\r\n  stains the methyl-alcohol solvent causes the fixation. In staining\r\n  with Giemsa’s stain, or haematoxylin and eosin, separate fixation\r\n  is necessary. For Giemsa either absolute alcohol (ten to fifteen\r\n  minutes) or methyl alcohol (two to five minutes) answers well.\r\n\r\n  For haematoxylin and eosin, heat gives the best results. The\r\n  best method is to place the films in an oven provided with a\r\n  thermometer. Raise the temperature of the oven to 135°C. and then\r\n  remove the burner. After the oven has cooled, take out the fixed\r\n  slides or slips.\r\n\r\n  One of the handiest methods is to drop a few drops of 95% alcohol\r\n  on the slide or cover-glass. Allow this to flow over the entire\r\n  surface; then get rid of the excess of alcohol by touching the edge\r\n  to a piece of filter-paper for a second or two. Then light the\r\n  remaining alcohol film from the flame and allow the burning alcohol\r\n  to burn itself out.\r\n\r\n=Staining Blood-films.=—As separate staining with eosin and\r\nmethylene blue rarely gives good preparations and as the\r\nmodifications of the Romanowsky stain recommended are easy to make\r\nand employ, and give much greater information, the separate method of\r\nstaining is not recommended.\r\n\r\n  _Wright’s Method._—The stain is made by adding 1 gram of methylene\r\n  blue (Grubler) to 100 cc. of a ½% solution of sodium bicarbonate in\r\n  water. This mixture is heated for one hour in an Arnold sterilizer.\r\n  The flask, containing the alkaline methylene-blue solution should\r\n  be of such size and shape that the depth of the fluid does not\r\n  exceed 2½ inches. When cool, filter the methylene blue solution,\r\n  and add 500 cc. of a 1 to 1000 eosin solution (yellow eosin, water\r\n  soluble). Add the eosin solution slowly, stirring constantly\r\n  until the blue color is lost and the mixture becomes purple with\r\n  a yellow metallic lustre on the surface, and there is formed a\r\n  finely granular black precipitate. Collect this precipitate on\r\n  a filter-paper and when thoroughly dry (dry in the incubator\r\n  at 38°C.) dissolve 0.3 gram in 100 cc. of pure methyl alcohol\r\n  (acetone-free). Wright lately has recommended using 0.1 in 60 cc.\r\n  methyl alcohol. This constitutes the stock solution. For use filter\r\n  off 20 cc. and add to the filtrate 5 cc. of methyl alcohol.\r\n\r\n  A _modification by Balch_ is very satisfactory. In this method\r\n  instead of polychroming the methylene blue with sodium bicarbonate\r\n  and heat, the method of Borrel is used. Dissolve 1 gram of\r\n  methylene blue in 100 cc. of distilled water. Next dissolve 0.5\r\n  gram of silver nitrate in 50 cc. of distilled water. To the silver\r\n  solution add a 2 to 5% caustic soda solution until the silver oxide\r\n  is completely precipitated. Wash the precipitated silver oxide\r\n  several times with distilled water. This is best accomplished\r\n  by pouring the wash-water on the heavy black precipitate in the\r\n  flask, agitating, then decanting and again pouring on water.\r\n  After removing all excess of alkali by repeated washings, add the\r\n  methylene-blue solution to the precipitated silver oxide in the\r\n  flask. Allow to stand about ten days, occasionally shaking until\r\n  a purplish color develops. The process may be hastened in an\r\n  incubator. When polychroming is complete, filter off and add to the\r\n  filtrate the 1 to 1000 eosin solution and proceed exactly as with\r\n  Wright’s stain.\r\n\r\n  In _Leishman’s method_ the polychroming is accomplished by adding\r\n  1 gram of methylene blue to 100 cc. of a ½% solution of sodium\r\n  carbonate. This is kept at 65°C. for twelve hours and allowed to\r\n  stand at room temperature for ten days before the eosin solution is\r\n  added. The succeeding steps are as for Wright’s stain.\r\n\r\n_In all Romanowsky methods_ distilled water should be used. If not\r\nobtainable, the best substitute is rain-water collected in the open\r\nand not from a roof.\r\n\r\n  _Method of staining:_\r\n\r\n  1. Make films and air dry.\r\n\r\n  2. Cover dry film preparation with the methyl-alcohol stain for one\r\n  minute (to fix).\r\n\r\n  3. Add water to the stain on the cover-glass or slide, drop\r\n  by drop, until a yellow metallic scum begins to form. It is\r\n  advisable to add the drops of water rapidly in order to eliminate\r\n  precipitates on the stained film. Practically, we may add 1 drop of\r\n  water for every drop of stain used.\r\n\r\n  4. Wash thoroughly in water until the film has a pinkish tint.\r\n\r\n  5. Dry with filter-paper and mount.\r\n\r\n  Red cells are stained orange to pink; nuclei, shades of violet;\r\n  eosinophile granules, red; neutrophile granules, yellow to lilac;\r\n  blood platelets, purplish; malarial parasites, blue; chromatin,\r\n  metallic-red to rose-pink.\r\n\r\n_Giemsa’s Modification of the Romanowsky Method._—This is one of the\r\nmost perfect of the modifications. The objection is that greater time\r\nin staining films is required than with the Wright or Leishman method\r\nand the stain is very expensive.\r\n\r\n  Take of Azur II eosin 0.3 gram. Azur II 0.08 gram.\r\n\r\n  Dissolve this amount of dry powder in 25 cc. of glycerine at 60°C.\r\n  Then add 25 cc. of methyl alcohol at the same temperature. Allow\r\n  the glycerine-methyl alcohol solution to stand overnight and then\r\n  filter. This is the stock stain. To use: Dilute 1 cc. with 10 to 15\r\n  cc. of distilled water. If 1 to 1000 potassium carbonate solution\r\n  is used instead of water it stains more deeply. These same dyes,\r\n  mixed with methylene violet, are now obtainable commercially as a\r\n  powder ready for solution in methyl alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe alkaline diluent is used to obtain the coarse stippling in\r\nmalignant tertian (Maurer’s clefts). Having fixed the smear with\r\nmethyl alcohol for one to five minutes, pour on the diluted stain,\r\nand after fifteen to thirty minutes wash off and continue washing\r\nwith distilled water until the film has a slight pink tinge. For\r\n_Treponema pertenue_ stain from one to twelve hours.\r\n\r\n  =Haematoxylin Staining.=—While the Romanowsky methods are more\r\n  satisfactory for differential counts and for the demonstration of\r\n  the malarial parasites, and especially for differentiating species,\r\n  yet by reason of the liability to deterioration in the tropics of\r\n  methylene blue the haematoxylin methods may be preferable. Many\r\n  workers in blood-work and cytodiagnosis prefer the haematoxylin.\r\n\r\n  1. Fix the film either by heat, with methyl alcohol for two minutes\r\n  or with Whitney’s fixative. Heat is to be preferred.\r\n\r\n  2. Stain with Meyer’s hemalum or Delafield’s haematoxylin for from\r\n  five to fifteen minutes according to the stain. Frequently three\r\n  minutes will be found sufficient. To make the hemalum, dissolve\r\n  0.5 gram of haematin in 25 cc. of 95% alcohol. Next dissolve 25\r\n  grams of ammonia alum in 500 cc. of distilled water. Mix the two\r\n  solutions and allow to ripen for a few days. The stain should be\r\n  satisfactory in two or three days.\r\n\r\n  3. Wash for two to five minutes in tap water to develop the\r\n  haematoxylin color.\r\n\r\n  4. Stain either with a 1 to 1000 aqueous solution of eosin or with\r\n  a one-half of 1% eosin solution in 70% alcohol. The eosin staining\r\n  only requires fifteen to thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n  5. Wash and examine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL COUNT\r\n\r\nIn making a differential count I would recommend the following from\r\nthe directions of Schilling-Torgau. It will be remembered that\r\nconsiderable interest was raised a few years ago in what was termed\r\nthe Arneth index. In this the more normal, more mature, better\r\nresisting polymorphonuclears were considered to have 3 or 4 lobes\r\nto the nuclear structure, even occasionally 5. The immature cells\r\nhad only one or at most two lobes to the nucleus. The index was\r\nobtained by adding the percentages of cells showing 1 and 2 lobes\r\nto ½ the percentage of those with 3 lobes. As will be understood a\r\nhigh percentage of these immature cells was unfavorable in prognosis.\r\nThese cells are graded from left to right, I, II, III, IV, V, as to\r\nseparate masses in the nucleus, so that when the percentage is shoved\r\nor displaced to the left it indicates an increase in the immature\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n  Schilling-Torgau divides his polymorphonuclears into: (1) The\r\n  myelocyte which is always of course a pathological cell. (2)\r\n  The immature form polymorphonuclear. In this there is a close\r\n  resemblance to the neutrophile myelocyte but there is a nuclear\r\n  indentation instead of the round nucleus of the myelocyte. It is\r\n  this cell which often puzzles us as to whether to regard it as a\r\n  true myelocyte. It is the meta-myelocyte of many authorities. (3)\r\n  Between the mature or segmented polymorphonuclear and the immature\r\n  one or metamyelocyte we have what may be designated the band-form\r\n  nucleated one. These show the type of nucleus which one is familiar\r\n  with in the nucleus of the transitional. (4) The mature, multilobed\r\n  or segmented nucleus of the typical polymorphonuclear.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that if all tropical workers would agree upon\r\nsome single method of recording differential counts it would be\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\n  Under the blood findings in liver abscess, in a paragraph to follow\r\n  in this chapter, I give suggestive counts indicating the value of\r\n  Schilling-Torgau’s method.\r\n\r\n  In the differential count he not only divided up the\r\n  polymorphonuclears but makes no separation of small from large\r\n  lymphocytes. Although I have always divided lymphocytes into large\r\n  and small ones I believe it unnecessary and unpractical and shall\r\n  henceforth group all such cells in one grouping. The statement that\r\n  large mononuclears and transitionals are cells of a similar origin,\r\n  type and significance has always been my view.\r\n\r\n                        SCHEME OF SCHILLING-TORGAU\r\n  -------------------------------------------------+-------+---------------\r\n                                                   | Normal|  Percentage\r\n                       Type of Cell                |Percen-|Moderate Sepsis\r\n                                                   |  tage |(W.

There are many ways of carrying out\r\nthe cultivation of organisms from the blood but the one which may be\r\nstrongly recommended is the following. The blood is obtained from a\r\nvein, the overlying skin of which has been painted with tincture of\r\niodine to insure a sterile skin surface.\r\n\r\n  A stout hypodermic needle is attached to about 6 inches of rubber\r\n  tubing which in turn is pushed over a downward bent glass tube\r\n  which passes through a doubly perforated rubber stopper. A second\r\n  glass tube, which also passes through the stopper, is bent upward\r\n  to be attached to a second piece of rubber tubing for use in\r\n  suction by the mouth. The glass tubes project about ½ inch below\r\n  the under surface of the rubber stopper and above are about 2½\r\n  inches including the bent arm. This system of tubing and stopper is\r\n  readily sterilized by boiling in a pan or instrument sterilizer.\r\n  As a receptacle for the blood we employ Erlenmeyer flasks of 100\r\n  cc. capacity, containing 25 cc. of salt solution with 1% of sodium\r\n  citrate, for prevention of coagulation. Blood that contains 0.2%\r\n  of sodium citrate will not coagulate so that a 0.5% solution could\r\n  be used instead of the usual 1% one. These citrated salt solution\r\n  flasks are plugged with cotton, sterilized and kept on hand ready\r\n  for immediate use, so that we only have to sterilize the stopper\r\n  and tubing by boiling and flame the neck of the flask when removing\r\n  the cotton plug to insert the stopper of the system. By suction we\r\n  can take any amount of blood desired. I usually count the drops\r\n  of blood as they fall into the citrated salt solution allowing\r\n  16 drops to the cc. In this way we may take from 10 to 25 cc. of\r\n  blood at the bedside and then later on in the laboratory, when it\r\n  is convenient, inoculate various media from the flask. For plates\r\n  add 2 or 3 cc. of this citrated blood to 6 or 8 cc. of melted\r\n  agar at 45°C. The blood mixture can also be added to various\r\n  sugar bouillons for fermentation reactions. Finally we place the\r\n  receiving flask in the incubator and culture it as well as the\r\n  other media.\r\n\r\n=Clot Cultures.=—A very simple method is to take blood with a Wright\r\nU-tube. Then centrifuge and use the serum for agglutination tests and\r\nthe clot, emulsified in some liquid medium, for the blood culturing.\r\nFor paratyphoid culturing _bile media_ are preferable, just as for\r\ntyphoid.\r\n\r\n  =Lyon Blood Tube.=—Quite recently I have been using the blood\r\n  tube recommended by Lyon. To make it, heat a 5- or 6-inch section\r\n  of ¼ inch tubing in the centre and draw out as for making 2\r\n  bacteriological pipettes. Divide and seal off the large end in the\r\n  flame. Next seal off the capillary end. Then apply a very small\r\n  flame to a point on the large end just before it begins to taper\r\n  to the capillary part. The heat causes the heated sealed-off air\r\n  inside to force out a blow hole. To use: Break off the sealed\r\n  capillary end and allow the capillary end to suck up blood from a\r\n  drop just as with the Wright tube. I consider this tube superior to\r\n  the Wright one.\r\n\r\n  =N. N. N. Medium.=—In culturing blood for protozoa the N. N. N.\r\n  medium is usually employed. Novy and MacNeal originally used a 12½%\r\n  meat infusion containing 2½% agar, 2% peptone, 1% normal sodium\r\n  carbonate solution and ½% salt. To one part of this agar, melted\r\n  and cooled to 60°C., they added twice the amount of defibrinated\r\n  rabbit’s blood. In the N. N. N. medium, as modified by Nicolle,\r\n  there is beside the blood only salt and agar—no peptone or meat\r\n  extractives.\r\n\r\n  Citrated salt solution was the medium used by Rogers in the\r\n  cultivation of splenic juice from kala-azar patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAKING OF BLOOD FOR SEROLOGICAL TESTS\r\n\r\nThis can be done with the Wright tube, pipetting off the clear serum\r\nafter centrifuging. We usually draw blood from a vein by use of the\r\nsystem of stopper and tubing described under blood culturing but\r\nemploying an empty, sterile centrifuge tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgglutination Tests\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of testing the agglutinating powers of a\r\nserum—the microscopical and the macroscopical or sedimentation\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n  =For the microscopical method= draw up serum to the mark 0.5 of\r\n  the white pipette. Then draw up salt solution to the mark 11. This\r\n  when mixed gives a dilution of 1 to 20. One loopful of the diluted\r\n  serum and one loopful of a bouillon culture or salt solution\r\n  suspension of the organism to be tested gives a dilution of 1 to\r\n  40. One loopful of the 1-20 diluted serum and 3 loopfuls of the\r\n  bacterial suspension give a dilution of 1-80. These two dilutions\r\n  answer in ordinary diagnostic tests. The red pipette with a 1-100\r\n  or 1-200 dilution may be used where dilutions approaching 1-1000\r\n  are desired. Having mixed the diluted serum and the bacterial\r\n  suspension on a cover-glass, we invert it over a vaselined concave\r\n  slide and examine with a high power dry objective (⅙ inch). It\r\n  is simpler to make a ring of vaseline to fit the cover-glass and\r\n  make the mixture of diluted serum and culture in the centre of\r\n  this ring or square. Then apply the cover-glass, press it down on\r\n  the vaseline ring and examine as with the ordinary hanging drop.\r\n  In making dilutions it is preferable to use salt solution, as\r\n  the phenomenon of agglutination requires the presence of salts.\r\n  Ordinarily, thirty minutes is a sufficient time to wait before\r\n  reporting the absence of agglutination. Agglutination is more\r\n  rapid at body temperature than at room temperature. In reporting\r\n  agglutination, always give time and dilution. It is absolutely\r\n  necessary that a control preparation be prepared in every instance;\r\n  that is, one with the bacterial culture alone or with a normal\r\n  serum of the same dilution as the lowest used. Some normal sera\r\n  will agglutinate in 1 to 10 dilution, and group agglutinations (as\r\n  paratyphoid with typhoid serum) may occur in 1 to 40 or possibly\r\n  higher. It is very unusual for sera to agglutinate any other\r\n  bacteria then the specific one in dilutions as high as 1-80.\r\n\r\n  =Macroscopic Agglutination.=—For the macroscopical or\r\n  sedimentation test, take a series of small tubes (⅜ × 3 inches) and\r\n  deposit 1 cc. of salt solution in each of the series. Now, having\r\n  taken an empty test-tube, drop 4 drops of serum in it and then\r\n  add 12 drops of salt solution. This approximately gives 1 cc. of\r\n  a 1 to 4 dilution of the serum. It is more exact to make the 1 to\r\n  4 dilution with a graduated pipette. With a rubber-bulb capillary\r\n  pipette, which has been graduated to hold 16 drops or 1 cc., draw\r\n  up the contents of the tube containing the 1 to 4 serum and add it\r\n  to the next tube containing 1 cc. of salt solution. This gives 2\r\n  cc. of a dilution of 1 to 8. Now mix thoroughly by drawing up and\r\n  forcing out with the bulb pipette, and then withdraw 1 cc. and add\r\n  to the next tube containing 1 cc. of salt solution. This gives a\r\n  dilution of 1 to 16. Having mixed as before, again withdraw 1 cc.\r\n  of the mixture and add it to the 1 cc. in the next tube. We now\r\n  have a dilution of 1 to 32. Again withdrawing 1 cc. and adding it\r\n  to the fourth tube containing 1 cc. of salt solution we have a\r\n  dilution of 1 to 64. In tube 1 there is now 1 cc. of a dilution of\r\n  the serum of 1 to 8; in tube 2, there is 1 cc. of a dilution of 1\r\n  to 16; in tube 3 of 1 to 32. Tube 4 contains 2 cc. of 1 to 64. The\r\n  dilutions can be carried on in the same manner to any extent that\r\n  may be desirable. In cholera agglutinations we may run up to 1 to\r\n  5000 or thereabouts. Of course, where such dilutions are employed,\r\n  we generally start with 2 cc. of 1 to 50 in the first tube. When\r\n  we have completed the series, each tube having 1 cc. of diluted\r\n  serum, and the last 2 cc., we remove with the pipette 1 cc. from\r\n  the last tube and discard it by ejection from the pipette leaving\r\n  1 cc. in the last tube. Now adding 1 cc. of a culture of typhoid\r\n  or any other organism, we have the dilution of the serum in each\r\n  tube doubled. Tube 1 now contains a serum in dilution of 1 to 16,\r\n  acting on the bacteria; tube 2 of a 1 to 32; tube 3 of a 1 to 64.\r\n  Now place these tubes in the incubator and, after two to five hours\r\n  or overnight, we examine for the clearing up of the supernatant\r\n  fluid. If the serum in a certain dilution agglutinates, the clumps\r\n  gravitate to the bottom and the upper part becomes clear. If so\r\n  desired, these dilutions may be carried on to 1 to several hundred\r\n  in the same way. It is safer to work with dead cultures instead of\r\n  living ones. To prepare, take a twenty-four-hour agar slant culture\r\n  of typhoid or paratyphoid and emulsify in salt solution (about 6\r\n  cc. to a slant).\r\n\r\n  By adding 0.1 of 1% of formalin to the typhoid emulsion and placing\r\n  in the ice-box the cultures will be found sterile in about three\r\n  days. The emulsion should be shaken twice daily while undergoing\r\n  sterilization in the ice-box. Such cultures are not easily\r\n  contaminated and appear to retain their agglutinable qualities\r\n  for several months. The macroscopic methods are preferable with\r\n  such dead cultures. For our Dreyer emulsions we use a two-billion\r\n  suspension of typhoid or para-typhoid organisms in 1 cc. of the\r\n  formalinized culture.\r\n\r\n  _Combination of Microscopical and Macroscopical\r\n  Methods._—Microscopic: Prepare dilutions of serum as above\r\n  described and take from each or several of the series, a loopful\r\n  of the diluted serum. For control use a loopful of salt solution.\r\n  Place on a cover-glass and add loopful of bouillon culture of the\r\n  living organisms. Make hanging drop preparation, report after one\r\n  hour at room temperature. Use ⅔ inch lens for examination.\r\n\r\n  Macroscopic: Add to each of the series, including the control, an\r\n  equal amount of an emulsion of killed organisms.\r\n\r\n  The method of using a slide with two vaselined rings, one\r\n  containing an emulsion in the specific serum and the other in salt\r\n  solution, is of great practical value. This method is described\r\n  under cholera.\r\n\r\n  _Complement Fixation._—Complement fixation tests have been\r\n  employed in the diagnosis of several tropical diseases but do not\r\n  seem to be at present sufficiently reliable or practical with the\r\n  exception of that for yaws and tularaemia. The chief difficulty\r\n  with complement fixation tests for suspected sera is to obtain a\r\n  reliable antigen. Should we later on be able to prepare bacterial\r\n  antigens as satisfactory as Noguchi’s acetone-insoluble antigen\r\n  is for the Wassermann test there may be a field for such tests in\r\n  tropical pathology.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PRACTICAL METHODS OF HAEMATOLOGICAL STUDY\r\n\r\nHaemoglobin Estimation\r\n\r\nThe standard method now is the estimation of the oxygen capacity of\r\nthe blood, using some gas apparatus, such as Van Slyke’s. Otherwise,\r\nthe most accurate instrument for this purpose is the Miescher\r\nmodification of the v. Fleischl haemoglobinometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.—Sahli’s Haemoglobinometer. (Greene.)]\r\n\r\n  The apparatus is expensive, requires considerable time and care in\r\n  the making of estimations, and is exclusively an instrument for a\r\n  well-equipped laboratory.\r\n\r\n  =Sahli’s Haemometer.=—A simple and apparently very scientific\r\n  instrument which has been recently introduced is the Sahli\r\n  modification of the Gower haemoglobinometer. Instead of the tinted\r\n  glass, or gelatin colored with picrocarmine to resemble a definite\r\n  blood dilution, Sahli uses as a standard the same coloring matter\r\n  as is present in the tube containing the blood. By acting on blood\r\n  with 10 times its volume of N/10 HCl, haematin hydrochlorate is\r\n  produced, which gives a brownish yellow color. In the standard\r\n  tube, which is sealed, a dilution representing 1% of normal blood\r\n  is used. To apply this test, pour in N/10 HCl to the mark 10 on\r\n  the scale of the graduated tube. Add to this 20 cubic millimeters\r\n  of the blood to be examined, drawn up by the capillary pipette\r\n  provided. So soon as the mixture assumes a clear bright dark-brown\r\n  color, which requires about ten minutes, add water drop by drop\r\n  until the color of the tubes matches. The reading of the height of\r\n  the aqueous dilution on the scale gives the Hb. reading. The tubes\r\n  are encased in a vulcanite frame with rectangular apertures. This\r\n  gives the same optical impression as would planoparallel glass\r\n  sides.\r\n\r\n  The most accurate readings are obtained with artificial light in a\r\n  dark room but almost as satisfactory comparisons can be obtained\r\n  with natural light from a window. It is advisable to turn the ruled\r\n  side around so that one may match colors without being influenced\r\n  in his determination by the scale.\r\n\r\n  The apparatus must be kept in a dark place as strong light will\r\n  change the color of the standard tube. It is recommended that the\r\n  N/10 HCl be preserved with chloroform.\r\n\r\n  The Dare instrument is excellent.\r\n\r\n  Pappenheim has recently proposed an instrument in which the\r\n  blood is converted into haematin hydrochloride as for the Sahli\r\n  apparatus. Instead of matching a standard tube, with a dilution\r\n  made drop by drop in the second tube, the new method employs a\r\n  wedge-shaped glass vessel showing graduations of the brown colored\r\n  blood, the treated blood being matched against the wedge-shaped\r\n  container (Autenreith-Koenigsberger Haemocolorimeter).\r\n\r\n  =Tallquist’s Haemoglobin Scale.=—This is a small book of specially\r\n  prepared filter-paper with a color-scale plate of ten shades of\r\n  blood colors. These are so tinted as to match blood taken up on\r\n  a piece of the filter-paper and are graded from 10 to 100. So\r\n  soon as the blood on the filter-paper has lost its humid gloss,\r\n  the comparison should be made. This is best done by shifting the\r\n  blood-stained piece of filter-paper suddenly from one to the other\r\n  of the holes cut in each shade—the piece of filter-paper being\r\n  underneath the color plate. At least a square centimeter of the\r\n  filter-paper should be stained by the blood. Daylight coming from\r\n  a window to the rear or at the side should be used in making the\r\n  comparison. The error with this method is probably not over 10%\r\n  after a little experience. If the colored plate is not kept in the\r\n  dark, the tints tend to fade.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORMAL BLOOD\r\n\r\nIn considering what may be termed normal blood, it must be borne in\r\nmind that the normal varies for men, women, and children:\r\n\r\n                 Hb.            Red Cells      Leucocytes\r\n\r\n  Men,        90 to 110%,    5 to 5½ million,     7500.\r\n  Women,      80 to 100%,    4½ to 5 million,     7500.\r\n  Children,   70 to  80%,    4½ to 5 million,     9000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOR INDEX\r\n\r\nThis is obtained by dividing the percentage of the haemoglobin by the\r\npercentage of red cells, 5,000,000 red cells being considered as 100%.\r\n\r\n  To obtain the percentage of red cells it is only necessary to\r\n  multiply the two extreme figures to the left by two. Thus if a\r\n  count showed the presence of 1,700,000 red cells the percentage\r\n  would be 34 (17 × 2 = 34). If the Hb. percentage in this case were\r\n  50, then the color index would be 50 ÷ 34, or 1.4.\r\n\r\nIn normal blood the color index is, approximately, 1.\r\n\r\n  In anaemias we have three types of color index: 1. The pernicious\r\n  anaemia type which is above 1. Here we have a greater reduction in\r\n  red cells than we have of the haemoglobin content of each cell.\r\n  For example, in a case of pernicious anaemia we have 2,000,000 red\r\n  cells (40%) and 60% of haemoglobin, 60 ÷ 40 = 1.5. 2. The normal\r\n  type, when both red cells and haemoglobin are proportionally\r\n  decreased, as in anaemia fallowing haemorrhage. 3. The chlorotic\r\n  type. Here there is a great decrease in haemoglobin percentage,\r\n  but only a moderate decrease in the number of red cells. Hence the\r\n  color index is only a fraction of 1. For example, in a case of\r\n  chlorosis we have 40% of haemoglobin and 4,000,000 red cells, 40 ÷\r\n  80 = 0.5.\r\n\r\n  One can judge fairly well the approximate color index by noting the\r\n  character of the staining of the red cells. This is faint in bloods\r\n  of low color index and deeper than normal in cells in a case with\r\n  high color index.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR AGGLUTINATION AND HAEMOLYSIS OF THE RED CELLS (TRANSFUSION)\r\n\r\nTransfusion of blood has become a method of greatest value in many\r\ntypes of anaemia.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a donor for blood for transfusion it is always\r\nnecessary to try his red cells against the serum of the recipient as\r\nwell as the patient’s red cells against the serum of the donor, in\r\norder to prove the absence of haemolyzing or agglutinating bodies.\r\n\r\n  Certain persons have isohaemolysins in their blood which dissolve\r\n  the red cells of other persons and in paroxysmal haemoglobinuria\r\n  autohaemolysins may be present which can destroy the patient’s\r\n  own red cells. This autohaemolysin seems operative only when a\r\n  low temperature is followed by a high one. When haemoglobinaemia\r\n  exists the liver converts it into bile pigment, causing bilious\r\n  stools and jaundice. If one-sixth of the red cells are destroyed\r\n  haemoglobinuria results.\r\n\r\nIn the following tables, two groupings of blood are given. Both are\r\nquoted in text-books, and both are in common use. Although that of\r\nMoss is more generally followed in France, England and the United\r\nStates, the obvious desirability of having one classification\r\nuniversally employed, in order to avoid confusion and the possibility\r\nof serious accidents, has led to the recommendation that, on the\r\nbasis of priority the grouping of Jansky be adopted.\r\n\r\n  In 1907, Jansky described the following four groups.\r\n\r\n  Group 1, the serum of which agglutinates the corpuscles of Groups\r\n  2, 3 and 4, while the cells are not agglutinated by any serum.\r\n\r\n  Group 2, the serum of which agglutinates the corpuscles of Groups\r\n  3 and 4, but not those of Groups 1 and 2, while the corpuscles are\r\n  agglutinated by the serum of Groups 1 and 3, but not by those of\r\n  Groups 2 and 4.\r\n\r\n  Group 3, the serum of which agglutinates the cells of Groups 2\r\n  and 4, but not those of Groups 1 and 3, while the corpuscles are\r\n  agglutinated by the serum of Groups 1 and 2, but not by those of\r\n  Groups 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n  Group 4, the serum of which does not agglutinate any corpuscles,\r\n  while the corpuscles are agglutinated by the serum of all other\r\n  groups.\r\n\r\n  In 1910, Moss made the following classification:\r\n\r\n  Group 1, the serum of which does not agglutinate any corpuscles,\r\n  while the corpuscles are agglutinated by the serum of Groups 2, 3\r\n  and 4.\r\n\r\n  Group 2, the serum of which agglutinates the corpuscles of Groups 1\r\n  and 3, while the corpuscles are agglutinated by the serum of Groups\r\n  3 and 4.\r\n\r\n  Group 3, the serum of which agglutinates the corpuscles of Groups 1\r\n  and 2, while the corpuscles are agglutinated by the serum of Groups\r\n  2 and 4.\r\n\r\n  Group 4, the serum of which agglutinates the corpuscles of Groups\r\n  1, 2 and 3 while the corpuscles are not agglutinated by any serum.\r\n\r\n  At the present time it is accepted that the four groups considered\r\n  include all adult persons; i.e., that the classification is\r\n  complete.\r\n\r\n  =Before transfusing= carry out the following tests:\r\n\r\n  From a vein take about 1 cc. of blood in a centrifuge tube\r\n  containing 1% of sod. citrate salt solution; then shift the stopper\r\n  of the blood system to a dry centrifuge tube and draw into it about\r\n  3 or 4 cc. of blood. Throw down the citrated blood, pipette off the\r\n  supernatant fluid and wash the sediment with normal saline.\r\n\r\n  Again pipette off the saline after centrifuging and make a 10%\r\n  emulsion of the red-cell sediment in normal saline.\r\n\r\n  Centrifuge the coagulated blood in the other tube and collect the\r\n  serum which separates from the clot.\r\n\r\n  Carry out these procedures for both donor and recipient.\r\n\r\n  Tests: 1. In a small test-tube deposit 1 drop of the donor’s 10%\r\n  red-cell emulsion and then add 4 drops of the recipient’s serum.\r\n\r\n  2. Treat similarly 1 drop of the recipient’s red-cell emulsion with\r\n  4 drops of the donor’s serum.\r\n\r\n  3. Treat 1 drop of donor’s red-cell emulsion with 4 drops of his\r\n  serum.\r\n\r\n  4. Treat 1 drop of recipient’s red-cell emulsion with 4 drops of\r\n  his serum. Finally add 1 cc. of salt solution to each of the four\r\n  tubes, shake gently and place in incubator for two hours.\r\n\r\n  5. Treat one drop of donor’s red-cell emulsion with four drops of\r\n  salt solution.\r\n\r\n  6. Treat one drop of recipient’s red-cell emulsion with four drops\r\n  of salt solution.\r\n\r\n  Tubes 5 and 6 are controls of saline.\r\n\r\n  Tests 3 and 4 should fail to show either agglutination or\r\n  haemolysis. If agglutination or haemolysis appears in tubes 1 or 2,\r\n  the donor is not satisfactory; but if agglutination appears in tube\r\n  2 only, he may be used in an emergency.\r\n\r\n  Some prefer to keep the tubes overnight in ice-box after the\r\n  preliminary examination following incubation.\r\n\r\n  _Lee’s Technique._—For the regular carrying out of this method one\r\n  should keep on hand the sera of individuals belonging to groups 2\r\n  and 3 (Moss). To carry out the tests prepare a suspension of the\r\n  donor’s red cells by dropping 2 or 3 drops of his blood into 1 cc.\r\n  of citrated salt solution. Deposit a platinum loopful of standard\r\n  serum 2 on a slide and emulsify in it a loopful of the donor’s\r\n  red-cell suspension. A concave slide with two concavities is\r\n  convenient, the serum-cell emulsion being made on the cover-glasses\r\n  which are to be inverted over the vaseline ringed concavities. The\r\n  agglutination can be observed with a high power magnifying glass or\r\n  the ⅔-inch objective. Agglutination, when it occurs, is usually\r\n  complete in five to fifteen minutes. Repeat test with serum 3. If\r\n  both test sera agglutinate the donor’s cells he belongs to group\r\n  one. If neither agglutinate, to group four.\r\n\r\n  Agglutination by group two serum but not by three puts the donor in\r\n  group three. Agglutination by group three serum but not by group\r\n  two shows a group two donor. It would seem safe to use the cells\r\n  of any donor of group 4, as such cells are not agglutinated by\r\n  the sera of any group. It is, however, advisable to try to obtain\r\n  a donor whose blood belongs to the same group as the donee. When\r\n  standard sera 2 and 3 are not on hand one may use the following\r\n  _emergency method_ of Lee:\r\n\r\n  “A small amount of blood is collected from a patient (1 cc. from\r\n  the ear or finger is sufficient), and allowed to clot. The serum\r\n  is then obtained. One drop of this serum is placed on a slide\r\n  and mixed with a drop of suspension of blood of the donor taken\r\n  into 1.5% citrate solution. (A few drops of blood are taken into\r\n  approximately 10 times the amount of 1.5 citrate solution and\r\n  shaken. It is very important that the blood be dropped directly\r\n  into the citrate, and should not be partially coagulated.) The\r\n  test will appear in a few moments, and is best examined under\r\n  the microscope, where, in the event of a positive test, marked\r\n  agglutination will be evident. The test will also be evident\r\n  macroscopically. In the event of a negative test it is a wise\r\n  precaution to raise the cover-glass, and after making sure that the\r\n  serum and cells are well mixed, to examine the preparation again.\r\n  The only possible source of confusion is the appearance of rouleaux\r\n  of the red corpuscle, indicating a too thick emulsion. If the test\r\n  is negative, transfusion may be regarded as entirely safe.”\r\n\r\n  In the absence of agglutination haemolysis never occurs. Only about\r\n  one-fifth of agglutinating sera prove also haemolytic. Rarely a\r\n  pernicious anaemia patient’s serum may agglutinate his own red\r\n  cells. This auto-agglutination is regarded as an important test in\r\n  acquired haemolytic jaundice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCULT BLOOD\r\n\r\nWhen the presence of blood in the faeces, gastric contents, urine or\r\nbody fluids, is suspected but cannot be recognized by macroscopic\r\nor microscopic methods, it is necessary to resort to spectroscopic\r\nor chemical tests. These tests are, however, individually\r\nunsatisfactory. The spectroscopic method is not delicate, the\r\nhaemin-crystal method does not give uniform results and the various\r\ncolor tests, although very sensitive, are given by many substances\r\nother than blood. Consequently, it may be said that, with the color\r\ntests, it is negative results that are significant, and with other\r\nthan the color tests it is positive findings that are informative.\r\nSerological tests are the most satisfactory medicolegally.\r\n\r\n  _Haemin Crystal Test (Teichmann)._—Prepare a solution (stable) of\r\n  0.1 gm. each of KI, KBr, and KCl in 100 cc. acetic acid. Mix a few\r\n  drops with some of the material on a slide, apply a cover-glass,\r\n  and _gently_ warm until bubbles begin to appear. Then cool\r\n  _slowly_, and examine for the characteristic dark-brown crystals.\r\n\r\n  _Haemochromogen Crystals (Donogány)._—Mix one drop each of\r\n  suspected fluid, pyridin, and 20% NaOH on slide, and let dry. If\r\n  positive, radiating needles will form after several hours.\r\n\r\n  _Spectroscopic Tests._—These depend upon the recognition of the\r\n  characteristic absorption spectra of haemoglobin or its derivatives\r\n  (Fig. 24). The degree of concentration influences their appearance,\r\n  and one should start with a relatively concentrated solution,\r\n  diluting cautiously until the bands are typical.\r\n\r\n  The small, direct-vision (hand) spectroscope suffices. A wavelength\r\n  scale is a convenient attachment. Daylight or strong artificial\r\n  light (such as the “daylite” lamp) is used. Have solution in a\r\n  small test tube or, preferably, a flat cell with a thickness of\r\n  about 1 cm. Before use, focus Frauenhofer’s lines sharply.\r\n\r\n  Reducing agents are employed, such as ammonium sulphide, or Stokes’\r\n  solution made up as follows: Dissolve 3 gm. FeSO_{4} in cold\r\n  H_{2}O; add cold, aqueous solution of 2 gm. tartaric acid; make\r\n  up to 100 cc.; immediately before use, add strong NH_{4}OH until\r\n  precipitate first formed is dissolved. Both solutions must be\r\n  freshly prepared, and the sulphide must be warmed to about 50°C.\r\n\r\n  Material that is uncontaminated, relatively fresh and in relatively\r\n  concentrated aqueous solution may give any or all of the upper\r\n  three spectra, a few drops of reducer changing the first to the\r\n  second.\r\n\r\n  If the material is older, dissolve the suspected stain in 1-2 cc.\r\n  of 10% NaOH, heat almost to boiling, cool, and add a few drops of\r\n  reducer. Examination shows Spectrum 5.\r\n\r\n  It is better, however, especially with much contamination, to\r\n  prepare an ethereal, acid extract. After having ground the material\r\n  thoroughly with water, if it is not already in liquid form, shake\r\n  it with an equal volume of neutral ether. Reject ether extract,\r\n  and, to 10 cc. of residue, add 3 to 5 cc. of glacial acetic acid.\r\n  Shake thoroughly with an equal volume of ether. If the ether does\r\n  not separate readily, mix gently with a few drops of alcohol.\r\n  Remove ethereal extract, and evaporate it to a small bulk for use\r\n  in tests. Examination will show spectrum of acid haematin, which,\r\n  however, in ethereal solution, resembles Spectrum 3 more than 4.\r\n\r\n  _Donogány’s Method_ increases the delicacy of the spectroscopic\r\n  test, and is also a color test. Dissolve the pigment with 20% NaOH,\r\n  add fresh pyridin and, if necessary, fresh ammonium sulphide.\r\n  Filter. The filtrate will be more or less orange-red according to\r\n  blood content, and will show Spectrum 5.\r\n\r\n  _Color Tests._—The reliability of these may be enhanced by the use\r\n  of methods which involve the removal or destruction of interfering\r\n  substances. In such a method, the original aqueous solution is\r\n  boiled for 15 to 20 seconds, and the acid ethereal extract is\r\n  prepared as previously described. This extract is dropped on\r\n  filter-paper, the reagents being applied to the moistened spot. The\r\n  delicacy of these several tests is variable, being greater with\r\n  blood in aqueous solution than in biological fluids, but it may\r\n  be given as approximately 1-25,000 for the guaiac and aloin, and\r\n  1-250,000 for the benzidine test.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Treat moist spot with a few drops of freshly prepared 2%\r\n  alcoholic solution of _guaiac_ resin, and then a few drops of\r\n  hydrogen peroxide. A blue color is “positive.”\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Treat moist spot with a few drops of 3% _aloin_ in 70%\r\n  alcohol, and then with ozonized turpentine (turpentine that has\r\n  stood for a few days in an open vessel in sunlight). A purplish-red\r\n  color within 10 minutes is “positive.”\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Treat moist spot with 2 drops of glacial acetic acid, a few\r\n  crystals of _benzidine_ (preferably white), and finally 2 drops of\r\n  hydrogen peroxide. A greenish-blue color is “positive.”\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDOSIS\r\n\r\nEveryone is familiar with that form of respiratory disturbance\r\nassociated with diabetic coma that is known as Kussmaul’s air hunger.\r\nHere we have hyperpnoea, a form of dyspnoea typically without\r\ncyanosis, and furnishing the best clinical evidence of acidosis.\r\nAcidosis, however, is now recognized to be but a particular phase of\r\ndisturbance of the _acid-base equilibrium_ of the body, and recent\r\nwork has radically changed our conceptions of its features and its\r\nintricate relationships.\r\n\r\n  Van Slyke restricts the use of the term “acidosis” to describe\r\n  a condition caused by acid retention sufficient to lower either\r\n  the bicarbonate or the pH of the blood below normal limits. The\r\n  pH of the blood may be considered the danger sentinel; as long as\r\n  it is normal, the acid-base equilibrium is normal or compensated;\r\n  otherwise, it is uncompensated, and life is seriously threatened.\r\n  The normal pH of the blood may be given as 7.3 to 7.5 (a slightly\r\n  alkaline reaction), each individual, however, probably having\r\n  normally narrower limits of variation. That of the blood serum is\r\n  about 0.2 pH higher, and that of the other body fluids (not the\r\n  excretions) probably closely approximates and promptly follows any\r\n  change in that of the blood plasma. Variations to the acid side\r\n  may, for a short time at least, be as low as 7.0, although not much\r\n  lower without fatal results; 7.0 is considered the point where\r\n  coma occurs. Variations to the alkaline side (Alkalosis) beyond\r\n  7.8 are accompanied by symptoms of tetany, although one is not at\r\n  present justified in assuming that all tetany is either caused,\r\n  or accompanied, by alkalosis. So, the extreme range of reaction\r\n  compatible with life probably lies approximately between pH of 7.0\r\n  and 7.8.\r\n\r\n  Recent, but as yet unconfirmed, work suggests that the severe\r\n  reactions following intravenous medication or infusions may be due,\r\n  at least in part, to the fact that the pH of the fluid introduced\r\n  is decidedly more acid or alkaline than that of the blood. This\r\n  applies to solutions of glucose, the salines, and possibly also to\r\n  sodium citrate, arsphenamine, sera, antitoxins, etc. The question\r\n  of suitably buffering such solutions, _e.g._, with suitable\r\n  phosphate mixtures, in order to avoid disturbance of the acid-base\r\n  equilibrium, is being studied, and the preliminary results are\r\n  promising.\r\n\r\n  The hydrogen-ion concentration (or its derivative, pH) of\r\n  the blood varies as the ratio between the concentrations of\r\n  dissolved carbonic acid and bicarbonate (generally indicated by\r\n  (H_{2}CO_{3})/(NaHCO_{3})), i.e., a relative increase in the\r\n  H_{2}CO_{3} increases the hydrogen-ion concentration and lowers\r\n  the pH, and vice versa. The stability of this ratio is preserved\r\n  by body mechanisms operative in controlling its two factors,—the\r\n  H_{2}CO_{3} being under respiratory control, and the NaHCO_{3},\r\n  considered as representing the alkali reserve, being normally\r\n  maintained by food.\r\n\r\n  The erythrocytes control the concentration of bicarbonate by virtue\r\n  of their haemoglobin and the reversible reaction.\r\n\r\n  H_{2}CO_{3} + NaCl ⮂ HCl + NaHCO_{3}\r\n\r\n  The HCl passes into the cell, and is probably held by the\r\n  haemoglobin. In the lungs, the CO_{2} is excreted and NaCl\r\n  reformed. This ability of haemoglobin to form bicarbonate is\r\n  important inasmuch as the corpuscles can conceal 5 to 10 times as\r\n  much acid as the plasma bicarbonate can ordinarily neutralize.\r\n  A full appreciation of the significance of this ratio being the\r\n  basis of an intelligent comprehension of acid-base equilibrium, a\r\n  detailed analysis of factors that tend to influence the ratio is\r\n  given.\r\n\r\nFactors Operating:\r\n\r\n  _A. To increase or protect bicarbonates:_\r\n      1. Administration of bicarbonate.\r\n      2. Loss of gastric HCl induced by obstructing the pylorus,\r\n          and regularly washing out the stomach for some\r\n          days.\r\n      3. Processes indicated by increased excretion in the urine of\r\n          ammonia compounds, the ammonia being probably\r\n          diverted from urea formation, and of substances\r\n          producing a titrable acidity, they including buffer\r\n          acids such as acid phosphates.\r\n      4. Possibly a shift of HCl to the tissue cells from the plasma\r\n          like that from the plasma to blood cells.\r\n\r\n  _B. To decrease bicarbonate:_\r\n      5. Acid substances, by their\r\n          (_a_) Increased production.\r\n          (_b_) Decreased elimination or\r\n          (_c_) Ingestion.\r\n      6. Diuresis, with elimination via the urine.\r\n      7. Lack of Factor A (3).\r\n      8. The hyperpnoea associated with deficient oxygen.\r\n\r\n  _C. To increase carbonic acid:_\r\n      9. Administration of carbonic acid.\r\n     10. Impaired diffusion in the alveoli of the lungs.\r\n     11. Slowing of respiration.\r\n\r\n  _D. To decrease carbonic acid:_\r\n     12. Hyperpnoea.\r\n          (_a_) Voluntary.\r\n          (_b_) Due to disease processes.\r\n          (_c_) Due to low oxygen content of air.\r\n          (_d_) Emergence from warm water.\r\n     13. Low atmospheric content of CO_{2}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.—Carbon dioxide absorption curves. (Modified\r\nfrom Peters, Barr, and Rule, and Van Slyke).]\r\n\r\n  Figure 152 is a graphic representation of essential facts in\r\n  acid-base equilibrium. Ordinates represent total CO_{2} content,\r\n  which comprises that in simple solution and that as bicarbonate\r\n  of whole blood in volumes per cent, and abscissae the mm. CO_{2}\r\n  tension in the blood as drawn. The line OT gives the proportion\r\n  of total CO_{2} present in simple solution. pH values are shown\r\n  by the lines OL, OM, etc. The extreme normals for carbon dioxide\r\n  absorption curves are OP and OR. The CO_{2} tension of alveolar\r\n  air may be the same or vary as much as 20 mm. below, while that of\r\n  venous blood will be about 6 (0.8-10.0) mm. higher than that of\r\n  arterial blood. The “CO_{2} capacity” (or “CO_{2} combining power”)\r\n  of plasma may be as much as 15 vol. % more than the total CO_{2} of\r\n  whole blood.\r\n\r\n  The actual state of acid-base balance, then, can only be determined\r\n  by the use of any two of a number of interdependent variables, such\r\n  as total CO_{2}, CO_{2} tension, pH, H_{2}CO_{3} concentration,\r\n  other buffers than bicarbonate, plasma chloride, ratio of\r\n  oxyhaemoglobin to haemoglobin, etc. Findings that fall within ABCD\r\n  and at about 40 mm. tension indicate a normal equilibrium for the\r\n  resting individual at ordinary altitudes. Or, such a normal would\r\n  be a total CO_{2} of about 49 (43-56) vol. % for whole blood, and\r\n  50-65 vol. % for plasma. The normal for the individual falls within\r\n  narrower limits.\r\n\r\n  If either H_{2}CO_{3} or bicarbonate varies from normal values,\r\n  there is apparently an effort on the part of the body to compensate\r\n  by adjusting the other so as at least to maintain a normal pH.\r\n  This is accomplished by respiration, or by diverting alkali from\r\n  or recalling it to the blood stream. Naturally, treatment of any\r\n  such abnormal condition will do well to imitate Nature’s efforts.\r\n  Haggard and Henderson have demonstrated that blood alkali may be\r\n  decreased in two ways—by acids (the _acidotic process_) or by\r\n  acapnia (the _acapnial process_). By the forced breathing of the\r\n  acapnial process the lungs are over-ventilated and an excessive\r\n  amount of carbon dioxide is washed out of the blood, thus bringing\r\n  on a temporary alkalosis. In case of prolonged forced breathing,\r\n  nature prevents an extreme alkalosis by causing the alkali to\r\n  leave the blood, it being stored in the tissues or excreted in the\r\n  urine. Blood relatively poor in carbonic acid or relatively rich in\r\n  alkali acts to depress respiration, and the slowing of respiration\r\n  produces an acidosis by the resultant retention of H_{2}CO_{3},\r\n  this causing alkali to be recalled from the tissues. Thus acidosis,\r\n  in calling more alkali into the blood from the tissues, represents\r\n  what may be regarded as a restorative effort. Hence, administration\r\n  of bicarbonate is indicated in acidotic processes, and of CO_{2} in\r\n  acapnial; the use of the wrong one is dangerous.\r\n\r\n  The numbered regions of the chart are associated with various\r\n  clinical conditions, e.g., tetany from 1, 2, and 3; the acidosis of\r\n  diabetes mellitus, nephritis, or infantile marasmus with 6 or 9;\r\n  pneumonia, morphine narcosis, and breathing of air containing 3-5%\r\n  CO_{2} with 7 or 8; emphysema with 4; some cardiac cases with 9;\r\n  overdose of bicarbonate with 1 or 4; fever with 2; as the result of\r\n  high altitudes, 2 or 3, or, when acclimated, 6; shock (handling of\r\n  intestines), deep ether anesthesia, and carbon monoxide asphyxia\r\n  with lowered bicarbonate. The disturbances of acid-base equilibrium\r\n  in the last two are the result of acapnial processes.\r\n\r\n  Normal metabolism results in the constant formation of acids,\r\n  especially H_{2}CO_{3}, and disease processes may occasion the\r\n  presence of still more. A constant loss of alkali results, the\r\n  neutralization products being eliminated mostly in the urine, and\r\n  the H_{2}CO_{3} via the lungs; the body fluids are excellently\r\n  buffered, the most important buffers being bicarbonate, proteins\r\n  (especially haemoglobin), and phosphates. In the maintainance\r\n  of the normal pH, the CO_{2} (or H_{2}CO_{3}) is the easily\r\n  variable factor. The onslaught of invading acids is first met\r\n  by the bicarbonates (acidotic process); hyperpnoea lowers the\r\n  H_{2}CO_{3} and a normal pH is maintained until the bicarbonates\r\n  are reduced to one-fourth (perhaps even to one-eighth) of their\r\n  normal concentration. If, nevertheless, the pH falls (and only\r\n  then), the other buffers are used, and, if it reaches 7.0, most of\r\n  the remaining bicarbonate becomes available. The blood handles the\r\n  situation, but buffers from the tissues or other body fluids also\r\n  become available in extreme cases.\r\n\r\n  As noted above, measurement of one variable will be inadequate\r\n  exactly to determine the state of acid-base equilibrium. As long,\r\n  however, as the pH is normal, which is the usual finding in most\r\n  pathological conditions, including mild acidosis, one determination\r\n  will suffice. Clinical methods comprise tests for whole blood or\r\n  plasma CO_{2} or bicarbonate, alveolar CO_{2} tension, bicarbonate\r\n  tolerance, pH of blood or urine, Sellard’s test, NH_{3} quotient of\r\n  urine, or presence of abnormal acids (particularly acetone bodies)\r\n  in blood or urine. The first two methods are the ones of choice,\r\n  particularly the first, as, by it, one can estimate the reserve\r\n  of the very important blood buffer, bicarbonate, and its result\r\n  closely indicates the total buffers.\r\n\r\nThe _tolerance for bicarbonate_ is a very convenient and practical\r\nmeasure of acidosis, and means the dose of NaHCO_{3} required to\r\nproduce a urine alkaline or amphoteric to litmus. A normal finding\r\nis 5-10 grams; 20 is required with a mild, 30-40 with a more severe,\r\nand more than 40 gm. with extreme degrees of acidosis. In coma, it is\r\nusually impossible to produce an alkaline urine.\r\n\r\n  Certain changes in the urine are recognized and acceptable as\r\n  indirect evidence of acidosis, but these changes are not synonymous\r\n  with acidosis, being dependent in part upon renal integrity and\r\n  other factors. The NH_{3} quotient of urine (ammonia nitrogen;\r\n  total nitrogen), as usually determined with patient on a mixed\r\n  diet, is normally about 5%. Values of 10-40% occur in acidosis.\r\n  It may be increased by diet, disturbances of protein metabolism,\r\n  ammoniacal fermentation, etc., and there may be no increase in\r\n  certain diseases with acidosis. The ammonia probably does protect\r\n  the blood alkali, but its efficacy is intimately associated with\r\n  renal function, inasmuch as Nash and Benedict have presented strong\r\n  evidence to the effect that urinary and blood NH_{3} is the product\r\n  of an active synthetic function of the kidneys themselves. Acetone\r\n  bodies in the urine (_ketonuria_), in the blood (_ketosis_), or in\r\n  the breath, have diagnostic value but are poor indices of severity\r\n  of acidosis and may be absent in acidosis. Acetone and diacetic\r\n  acid have the same significance: a progressive increase gives a\r\n  grave prognosis, and it is generally considered that the presence\r\n  of β-hydroxybutyric acid indicates greater severity.\r\n\r\n  Acidotic acidosis is due either to the abnormal formation or\r\n  ingestion of acid substances, or to decreased elimination of\r\n  normal metabolic products. Ketosis is the important example of the\r\n  former, and retention of acid phosphates of the latter. In either\r\n  case, the body is robbed of its bases. The acidosis of diabetes\r\n  mellitus is characterized by ketosis and increased NH_{3} quotient\r\n  of urine, while that of nephritis is a phosphate retention without\r\n  ketosis, and, as one would expect, the NH_{3} quotient is usually\r\n  not increased. Infantile diarrhoea with ileocolitis shows a marked\r\n  ketosis, but, lacking the ileocolitis, the ketosis is only moderate\r\n  and the acidosis is due to phosphate retention.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of an acidosis in disease constitutes a serious\r\ndevelopment demanding immediate attention. It is usually present at\r\ntime of death and may be the immediate cause. We must be prepared for\r\nthe appearance of acidosis in the course of numerous cosmopolitan\r\ndiseases, and its presence has been recognized in a few tropical\r\nconditions. Before we generally recognized the great importance of\r\nthe acidosis factor in pathology, there were two standard treatments\r\nfor _yellow fever_ and _blackwater fever_, the Sternberg one in the\r\nformer and the Hearsey one for the latter, both of which had as a\r\nbasis the administration of alkalis, which is our best means for\r\nneutralizing the deleterious action of increased acid production\r\nin the body or defective elimination of the same. It was a very\r\nimportant contribution to the therapeutics of _cholera_ when\r\nSellards, recognizing the tendency of the nephritis to produce an\r\nacidosis in this disease, made use of intravenous injections of\r\nNaHCO_{3} to combat the condition, thus counteracting the anuria,\r\none of the chief complications leading to death. More recently, the\r\nEgyptian workers noted an acidosis in _kala-azar_, a finding verified\r\nand emphasized by Rogers. There is also an acidosis in _heat stroke_,\r\nso that intravenous or rectal injections of NaHCO_{3} are of value.\r\nIt will thus be seen that acidosis is a most important condition to\r\nkeep in mind in tropical conditions, and it will be well to be on the\r\nwatch for other varieties of disturbance of acid-base equilibrium.\r\n\r\n  Relative to the _administration of bicarbonate_ in treatment, there\r\n  is now a decided reaction against the use of amounts that may prove\r\n  injurious by reason of the danger of alkalosis. There is a tendency\r\n  to employ it only in decompensated acidosis, and control it by\r\n  estimations of plasma CO_{2} capacity, 0.5 gm. NaHCO_{3} per 19\r\n  kg. body weight will raise the plasma CO_{2} capacity by 1 vol %.\r\n  It is distinctly contraindicated in cases whose low plasma CO_{2}\r\n  is due to acapnial processes. Early administration is desirable in\r\n  children, and good results are obtained, especially with the older\r\n  ones. An acidosis, however, once established in infants may cause\r\n  death despite alkali. In order to avoid over-dosage of bicarbonate,\r\n  methyl red, which is more sensitive than litmus to early changes in\r\n  the reaction of the urine, should be employed as an indicator. The\r\n  appearance of a yellow color upon its addition to the urine is the\r\n  sign to suspend further administration of alkali.\r\n\r\n  Glucose is indicated in conditions with ketosis due to carbohydrate\r\n  deficiency, providing the organism can assimilate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF BLOOD\r\n\r\nThe chemical analysis of the blood has attained a clinical simplicity\r\nand significance that demands recognition. It provides points of\r\nvalue in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, being especially useful\r\nin nephritis, diabetes, acidosis, comatose conditions, gout, and in\r\nquestions of renal function and treatment, especially dietetic. Urine\r\nfindings are always dependent upon kidney function, and, by blood\r\nchemistry, we can pass behind this barrier.\r\n\r\n  Few diseases have been as yet studied thoroughly in this respect,\r\n  but our fund of knowledge is receiving constant additions. The\r\n  field of tropical medicine is practically untouched, and it is\r\n  quite possible that an investigation along this line might there\r\n  yield facts of interest and value.\r\n\r\nThe following table (amplified from Myers), is a concise summary of\r\nnormal findings and those encountered in various clinical conditions.\r\nThe diagnostic significance is evident. Some of the results are\r\nbased upon the analysis of many cases; others upon but few. One\r\nmight include the findings mentioned elsewhere regarding acidosis\r\nin certain tropical diseases, but, except for such, we have no\r\nother data relative to them, unless one mentions that blood sugar\r\nis increased in the tropics. The values are given in milligrams per\r\n100 cc. whole blood (the usual system), except those for diastatic\r\nactivity (recorded in Winslow’s empirical units) and acidosis\r\n(expressed in terms of plasma carbon dioxide combining power—volumes\r\n%). “Inc.” and “Dec.” signify increased and decreased respectively.\r\n\r\n                  RESULT OF CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF BLOOD\r\n\r\n

--+-------+-------+------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+------\r\n\r\n  _Interstitial nephritis_ is characterized by a nitrogen retention,\r\n  while _parenchymatous nephritis_ has relatively little nitrogen\r\n  retention but does have a decided tendency towards chloride\r\n  retention. _Essential hypertonia_ with its normal blood chemistry\r\n  is differentiated from _arteriosclerosis_ with its frequent\r\n  nitrogen retention. The imminence of _uraemia_ may be judged\r\n  by the extent of the nitrogen retention. We have an aid in\r\n  the differentiation of the uraemia of nephritis accompanied\r\n  by a flagging heart from the passive congestion of cardiac\r\n  decompensation, especially as to which is the secondary condition,\r\n  and thus therapeutic indications relative to mooted questions\r\n  of treatment (hot packs, morphine, renal stimulants, etc.).\r\n  Unsuspected cases of nephritis showing only gastric symptoms\r\n  clinically have been detected by blood chemistry. The significance\r\n  of albumin in traces and occasional casts in urine has been more\r\n  definitely established by examination for increase of uric acid\r\n  in the blood—an increase arguing for an organic lesion. Values\r\n  of over 4 for creatinine do not occur without great impairment\r\n  of renal function, and findings of more than 5 have practically\r\n  uniformly foretold a fatal termination in less than six months,\r\n  except in acute nephritis and mild bichloride of mercury poisoning.\r\n  The creatinine is also the best guide to the status of renal\r\n  function in terminal cases. The chloride and nitrogen content\r\n  afford guides to diet.\r\n\r\n  The blood may indicate a prediabetic state, and place the\r\n  practitioner upon his guard. There is a condition but recently\r\n  recognized in which there is a normal blood sugar, a persistent\r\n  glycuresis of usually less than 1% and independent of carbohydrate\r\n  intake, occasionally polyuria, but with no other symptoms of\r\n  diabetes mellitus. It is known as _renal diabetes_, is apparently\r\n  harmless, probably not uncommon, and may represent the condition\r\n  affecting most of those “diabetics” who can disregard diet with\r\n  impunity. The blood sugar and plasma CO_{2} are usually considered\r\n  the only safe guides in the treatment of _diabetes mellitus_ and\r\n  no extended medical treatment or surgical interference should ever\r\n  be attempted without their estimation. Glycosuria is a poor guide,\r\n  especially in advanced cases.\r\n\r\n  In _comatose conditions_, nitrogen retention will indicate the\r\n  uraemic, and hyperglycaemia the diabetic cases. But _acute\r\n  nephritis_ should always be borne in mind, as it may have a\r\n  pronounced acidosis but no nitrogen retention.\r\n\r\n  A high uric acid finding alone is characteristic of gout, and\r\n  aids in differential diagnosis from simple rheumatic fever and\r\n  other arthritides, any uric acid retention in them being usually\r\n  accompanied by retention of other nitrogenous elements. It is\r\n  especially useful in the diagnosis of gouty arthritis without tophi.\r\n\r\n  The efficacy of treatment will, in general, be shown by the degree\r\n  of approach to normal blood findings.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCOPENIA\r\n\r\nThis is a term used to designate a reduction in the normal number\r\nof leucocytes. A leucocyte count of 5000 would represent a slight\r\nleucopenia; one of 2000, a marked leucopenia. In the later stages\r\nof typhoid, and in acute miliary tuberculosis, we expect a moderate\r\nleucopenia. Glandular tuberculosis may give a very marked leucopenia.\r\nTuberculous peritonitis will show moderate leucopenia or a normal\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n  The leucopenia of typhoid is moderate and is often preceded in the\r\n  first few days by a moderate neutrophile leucocytosis. Later on we\r\n  have a decided increase in the lymphocytes. A marked diminution or\r\n  absence of eosinophiles is so characteristic that any increase in\r\n  eosinophilic percentage negatives a diagnosis of typhoid.\r\n\r\n  Paratyphoid gives a similar blood picture.\r\n\r\n  Chronic alcoholism and chronic arsenic poisoning cause a reduction\r\n  in the number of the white cells. Pernicious anaemia, especially\r\n  the aplastic type, shows a marked leucopenia, as is also the case\r\n  with Banti’s disease. Two tropical diseases, kala-azar and dengue,\r\n  show a marked leucopenia, the counts often being below 2500. During\r\n  the apyrexial period of malaria we may have a white count of 5000.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been claimed that a leucopenia with a coincident\r\nmarked reduction in the lymphocytes is characteristic of measles and\r\nthat this occurs several days before the Koplik spots appear.\r\n\r\n  Kocher notes that in exophthalmic goiter the leucocyte count is\r\n  considerably diminished and that the polymorphonuclears are not\r\n  much more than one-half the usual percentage while the percentage\r\n  of the lymphocytes is almost double the normal.\r\n\r\n  X-ray treatment tends to destroy leucocytes in the exposed region,\r\n  especially polymorphonuclears. The small lymphocytes are least\r\n  affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nEOSINOPHILIA\r\n\r\nWhere the eosinophiles are increased to 5%, we have a moderate\r\neosinophilia. In some cases of infection with intestinal parasites,\r\nespecially hookworms, but also from other parasites, as round and\r\nwhip-worms, we may have an eosinophilia of 30 to 50%. In Guam, among\r\nthe natives, it is difficult to find an eosinophile count under 15%.\r\nThe eosinophilia tends to disappear when the anaemia becomes very\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n  _Echinococcus_ infection has an eosinophilia which disappears when\r\n  the cyst is removed. Continuance of the eosinophilia indicates that\r\n  all cysts were not gotten rid of.\r\n\r\nThe eosinophilia of trichinosis is best known, and a combination of\r\nthis blood finding with fever and marked pains of muscles, would\r\njustify the excision of a piece of muscle for examination for\r\nencysted embryos.\r\n\r\n  In true asthma eosinophilia is marked, and its absence is of\r\n  value in indicating other causes for the condition. Certain skin\r\n  diseases, especially pemphigus, show eosinophilia. Blastomycoses\r\n  are usually found to show eosinophile increase.\r\n\r\nAn increase of eosinophiles always attracts attention to the\r\npossibility of intestinal parasite infections or to skin affections.\r\nThe explanation of eosinophilia is obscure although Neisser regards\r\nthe increased production of eosinophiles as an expression of\r\nsympathetic system irritation.\r\n\r\n  Eczema and psoriasis are not apt to give more than 3 or 4%\r\n  eosinophiles. A rather high degree of eosinophilia is found in\r\n  mycosis fungoides.\r\n\r\n  Scabies also gives an eosinophilia.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of eosinophiles in the blood of children is greater\r\nthan in that of adults.\r\n\r\n  Increase of both eosinophiles and mast cells is found in\r\n  myelogenous leucaemia.\r\n\r\n  An eosinophilia tends to appear following splenectomy.\r\n  With a Wright stain showing acid tendencies one may count\r\n  polymorphonuclears as eosinophiles unless noting smaller size of\r\n  granules.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCOCYTOSIS\r\n\r\nIt is to an increase in the polymorphonuclears that this term is\r\nusually applied, the term lymphocytosis or eosinophilia being\r\nemployed where white cells of eosinophile or lymphocyte nature are\r\nincreased. We have physiological leucocytosis in the latter weeks of\r\npregnancy, also in the new-born, and in connection with digestion.\r\n\r\n=Pathological Leucocytosis.=—Pneumonia. In this disease we have\r\na leucocytosis of 20,000 to 30,000 or higher. The eosinophiles\r\nare almost absent. A normal leucocyte count in pneumonia makes a\r\nprognosis unfavorable.\r\n\r\n  The leucocyte count drops about the time of the crisis, and with\r\n  the reappearance of eosinophiles is a favorable sign.\r\n\r\n  Toxaemic conditions as uraemia, diabetic coma and poisoning by\r\n  CO_{2} tend to show a leucocytosis.\r\n\r\nSeptic processes. The leucocyte count is of great value, especially\r\nwhen we obtain a leucocytosis with 80 to 90% of polymorphonuclears,\r\nas in appendicitis, cholecystitis, or other suppurative conditions.\r\nA marked leucocytosis is of diagnostic importance in acute ulcerative\r\nendocarditis provided it is not fulminant in type.\r\n\r\n  According to Cabot, leucocytosis varies in infections as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Severe infection—good resistance; early, marked and persistent\r\n  leucocytosis.\r\n\r\n  2. Slight infection—slight resistance; leucocytosis present, but\r\n  not marked.\r\n\r\n  3. In fulminating infections we may have no increase in whites, but\r\n  a higher percentage of polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n  4. Slight infection and good resistance may not be productive of\r\n  leucocytosis.\r\n\r\n  It is in connection with the question of operation in appendicitis\r\n  or similar conditions that the matter of a leucocyte count is of\r\n  prime importance. If there be a leucocytosis but with less than\r\n  75% of polymorphonuclears it indicates an infection of little\r\n  virulence or a walled-off process with an exacerbation. It is\r\n  difficult to form an opinion when the polymorphonuclears are\r\n  under 80%. Leucocytosis with polymorphonuclear percentage of 85\r\n  to 90 indicates immediate operation; percentages over 90 point to\r\n  peritonitis and if with such percentages of polymorphonuclears\r\n  there is absence of leucocytosis the prognosis is grave.\r\n\r\nThe blood of cases with malignant tumors tends to show a moderate\r\nleucocytosis except in epithelioma of the skin. When a cancer is\r\nulcerating quite a high white count may be obtained.\r\n\r\n  Spirochaete fevers, as relapsing fever, may give a leucocytosis of\r\n  from 25,000 to 50,000.\r\n\r\nSmallpox, especially at time of pustulation, plague, scarlet fever,\r\nand liver abscess give a leucocytosis of from 12,000 to 15,000.\r\n\r\n  Smallpox often shows a very large percentage of very characteristic\r\n  large mononuclears.\r\n\r\n  The leucopenia and lymphocyte increase in measles are important\r\n  points in differentiating it from scarlatina.\r\n\r\nInfluenza shows a leucopenia at first, then a leucocytosis and,\r\nfollowing the fall in fever, a second lowering. The very fatal\r\npneumonias of the 1918 epidemic of influenza showed a marked\r\nleucopenia.\r\n\r\n  With meningitis counts of 25,000 are not unusual, in abscess of the\r\n  brain the white count rarely exceeds 15,000.\r\n\r\nPoliomyelitis and polioencephalitis give a slight leucocytosis during\r\nthe febrile accession.\r\n\r\n  Erysipelas and epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis also give a\r\n  leucocytosis of from 15,000 to 20,000. In malignant diseases we\r\n  sometimes have a moderate leucocytosis. Rogers states that in liver\r\n  abscess, with a leucocytosis of 15,000 to 20,000 we have only\r\n  about 75 to 77% of polymorphonuclears—there being also a moderate\r\n  increase in the percentage of large mononuclears.\r\n\r\n  Drugs such as antipyrin may give a leucocytosis. The leucocyte\r\n  increase of pilocarpine is rather a lymphocytosis. Cinnamate of\r\n  soda, sodium nucleate, bacterin injections and turpentine have been\r\n  used in kala-azar to increase leucocytes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYMPHOCYTOSIS\r\n\r\nOf course, the disease in which we have the most marked lymphocytosis\r\nis lymphatic leucaemia.\r\n\r\n  The lymphocytosis of typhoid fever has been taken up under\r\n  leucopenia.\r\n\r\nWhooping-cough may give a lymphocytosis of 20,000 to 30,000.\r\n\r\n  Young children have normally an excessive proportion of lymphocytes\r\n  even to a reversal of the polymorphonuclear-lymphocyte relation\r\n  of adults. This is apt to be particularly marked in hereditary\r\n  syphilis. Enlarged tonsils may give rise to lymphocytosis of\r\n  10,000 to 15,000 when more than 50% of the white cells will be\r\n  lymphocytes. Rickets and scurvy give a lymphocytosis.\r\n\r\n  In pellagra there is a moderate lymphocytosis, averaging 34% in\r\n  about a normal count.\r\n\r\nVaricella and mumps may also give an increase in the percentage of\r\nlymphocytes.\r\n\r\n  Malta fever is a disease which may show quite a lymphocyte\r\n  increase, this going with a reduction in polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n  _Glandular fever_ (Pfeiffer, 1889) is a mild acute febrile disease,\r\n  the fever coming on after a short incubation period and lasting\r\n  about one week. Its main characteristics,—soft enlargement of\r\n  the lymphatic glands, splenomegaly, and a leucocytosis of about\r\n  20,000 with 80% lymphocytes of the lymphoblastic type and many\r\n  with bilobed Rieder nuclei,—lead often to its being mistaken for\r\n  lymphatic leucaemia. Throat infections, particularly Vincent’s\r\n  spirillosis, are thought by some to be concerned in its genesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASED LARGE MONONUCLEARS\r\n\r\nIn tropical work we combine the large mononuclears and transitionals\r\nin a differential count. They are the phagocytes of animal cells or\r\nparasites. The disease in which their increase is best recognized\r\nis malaria and an increase to 15% where the blood shows moderate\r\nleucopenia is very significant. The melaniferous leucocytes of\r\nmalaria are cells of this type.\r\n\r\n  Other protozoal infections, as kala-azar, trypanosomiasis and\r\n  amoebiasis cause it. Filterable-virus diseases may show a\r\n  mononuclear increase, thus yellow fever and dengue both give an\r\n  increase about the fifth or sixth day.\r\n\r\n  In Banti’s disease there is an increase in cells of this type and a\r\n  transitional increase is reported for Hodgkin’s disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES IN WHICH THERE IS A NORMAL LEUCOCYTE COUNT\r\n\r\nUncomplicated tuberculosis, influenza, Malta fever, measles,\r\ntrypanosomiasis, malaria, syphilis, and chlorosis.\r\n\r\n  In malaria we have a leucocytosis at the time of the rigor, while\r\n  during the apyrexial period there is a moderate leucopenia. In\r\n  malaria we have a marked increase in the percentage of the large\r\n  mononuclears and transitionals. These may form from 20% to 30%\r\n  of the leucocytes. When bearing particles of pigment they are\r\n  known as melaniferous leucocytes—macrophages which have ingested\r\n  malarial material. In dengue, at the time of the terminal rash,\r\n  we may have as great a percentage of large mononuclears. In this\r\n  disease, however, we have a great diminution of polymorphonuclears\r\n  from the start (25 to 40%). Instead of a large mononuclear we have\r\n  at the onset a lymphocytic increase. There is an increase of large\r\n  mononuclears in trypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\nThe white count is about normal in uncinariasis (Ashford’s average\r\nwas 7800). Some have reported a leucopenia in severe cases.\r\n\r\n  While eosinophilia is the most marked feature in hookworm disease\r\n  yet in very severe cases it may be absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoagulation Rate of Blood\r\n\r\nThis determination is of value in connection with operations on\r\njaundiced patients.\r\n\r\n  Wright’s coagulometer is a standard instrument but is cumbersome.\r\n\r\n  A simple method of determining the rate is to take a piece of\r\n  capillary glass tubing and hold it downward from the puncture to\r\n  let it fill for 3 or 4 inches. Then at intervals of thirty seconds\r\n  scratch with a file the capillary tubing at short distances and\r\n  break off between the fingers. When coagulation has taken place a\r\n  long worm-like coagulum is obtained. Normally coagulation occurs in\r\n  about three to four minutes, when the temperature is that of the\r\n  hand in which the tubes are conveniently held. Rudolf recommends\r\n  placing the tubes in metal tube-containers in a Thermos bottle at\r\n  20°C. He gives the normal coagulation rate for this temperature\r\n  as eight minutes, while at a temperature below this the period is\r\n  lengthened. Age and sex do not influence the rate. Sabrazes, the\r\n  originator of this method found no appreciable variation in tubes\r\n  from 0.8 to 1.2 mm diameter.\r\n\r\n  In Burker’s test you mix a drop of blood in a drop of distilled\r\n  water on a slide and with a capillary tube sealed off at the end\r\n  stir the mixture every half minute. So soon as fibrin threads\r\n  appear you have coagulation.\r\n\r\nFor the proper testing for coagulation rate the blood should be taken\r\nfrom vein and not from that exuding from a needle stab of ear or\r\nfinger. Our experience shows that it is not necessary to use venous\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific Gravity of the Blood\r\n\r\nHammerschlag has a method for the determination of the Hb. percentage\r\nbased upon the specific gravity of the blood.\r\n\r\n  In this method a mixture of benzol and chloroform is made of a\r\n  specific gravity of about 1050. A medium size drop of blood is then\r\n  taken up with a pipette and dropped into the mixture. If it sinks\r\n  add more chloroform from a dropping bottle, if it tends to rise,\r\n  more benzol. The mixture in which the drop of blood tends to remain\r\n  stationary, near the top of the mixed benzol and chloroform, has\r\n  the same specific gravity as that of the blood. This is determined\r\n  by an accurately graduated hydrometer. The normal average specific\r\n  gravity for men is 1059, for women 1056. A table, giving the Hb.\r\n  percentage corresponding to the specific gravity, accompanies the\r\n  outfit.\r\n\r\n  To determine the necessity for intravenous infusion in cholera\r\n  Rogers has recently recommended the employment of small bottles\r\n  containing aqueous solution of glycerine with specific gravities\r\n  varying from 1048 to 1070, increasing the specific gravity in each\r\n  successive bottle by 2°.\r\n\r\n\r\n  An accurate hydrometer will suffice to determine the specific\r\n  gravity. Drops of blood from the cholera patient are deposited\r\n  at the center of the surface of the fluid in the bottles from a\r\n  capillary pipette. If the specific gravity of the blood is 1062 at\r\n  least a liter of saline or sodium bicarbonate solution is needed.\r\n  If 1066 at least two liters. Formerly he estimated the indications\r\n  by blood pressure considering a pressure of 80 in Europeans or of\r\n  70 in natives as indicating intravenous injections.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION OF METHODS OF BLOOD EXAMINATIONS TO THE VARIOUS\r\nTROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\nIn considering the value of blood examinations in the various\r\ntropical diseases we may _first_ note those in which such\r\nexaminations are of little or no value and _second_ those in which\r\nsuch examinations are crucial or at any rate of prime importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. IN THE FIRST GROUP WE MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:\r\n\r\n  _Beriberi._—The leucocytes are about normal in number with\r\n  possibly a slight increase in lymphocytes. Of course there may be\r\n  anaemia present with the progress of the disease. Some think there\r\n  is a slight diminution from the normal percentage of eosinophiles.\r\n\r\n  Noc found the percentage of lymphocytes in beriberi patients to be\r\n  about 35 as against 32 for those unaffected.\r\n\r\n  _Sprue._—There is considerable reduction in red cells which\r\n  may fall below 2,000,000 in advanced cases. The whites may show\r\n  a slight tendency to leucopenia with a relative increase in\r\n  lymphocytes. The haemoglobin is not as much reduced as the red\r\n  cells so that we obtain a color index of from 1.1 to 1.3.\r\n\r\n  Poikilocytosis and punctate basophilia are often noted, but rarely\r\n  does one find nucleated reds. In a severe case the blood picture\r\n  is rather that of an aplastic anaemia than a typical pernicious\r\n  anaemia. The eosinophiles are rare or absent as the case advances.\r\n  One often finds many (7-9) nodes in the polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n  _Pellagra._—This disease may show a chloranaemia. Some authorities\r\n  have stated that we have an increase in the percentage of large\r\n  mononuclears but Hillman found a rather definite increase in the\r\n  lymphocytes (34%) and a normal large mononuclear percentage.\r\n\r\n  _Yaws._—This disease may show a moderate anaemia with a low color\r\n  index. The leucocytes are about normal in number with a moderate\r\n  increase in the percentage of large mononuclears.\r\n\r\n  _Leprosy._—There is, as would be expected, with the progress of\r\n  the disease, an anaemia which is of the chlorotic type. Leprosy\r\n  bacilli may be found in the blood, especially during the time of\r\n  the febrile accessions, but such examinations are of very little\r\n  value in practical diagnosis and there are so many liabilities to\r\n  error, as shown in the work with tubercle bacilli in blood, that we\r\n  should be very conservative in this direction.\r\n\r\n  There is probably an increase in the percentage of lymphocytes.\r\n\r\n  _Yellow Fever._—The blood findings are usually given as normal\r\n  although Noc states that at first we have an increase in\r\n  polymorphonuclear percentage to be followed by an increase in the\r\n  large mononuclears about the fifth day. He also noted an absence or\r\n  diminution of eosinophiles.\r\n\r\n  Intraperitoneal inoculation of animals with blood from patient\r\n  should be practised. Should the diagnostic reliability of the\r\n  procedure be established, yellow fever should then be placed in\r\n  Group 2, among those diseases in which examinations of the blood\r\n  are of prime importance.\r\n\r\n  _Cholera._—As cyanosis develops the red count goes up even to\r\n  8,000,000 with a corresponding or greater increase in the leucocyte\r\n  count. The estimation of the low blood pressure is important\r\n  as indicating the necessity for intravenous injections. The\r\n  determination of the degree of serum acidosis is also indicated\r\n  with reference to alkaline treatment. In a convalescent from a\r\n  disease suspected as cholera an agglutination test would be of\r\n  value, and in the absence of the serum of immunized animals one\r\n  could use that of a cholera convalescent against a spirillum\r\n  isolated from the stool of a suspected case of cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. OF THE DISEASES IN WHICH AN EXAMINATION OF THE BLOOD SHOULD ALWAYS\r\nPLAY A PART IN DIAGNOSIS MAY BE NOTED THE FOLLOWING:\r\n\r\n_Malaria._—The examination of the blood is necessary not only\r\nto prove the existence of a malarial infection but, as well, to\r\ndetermine the species of parasite present, this latter a matter of\r\nmuch importance as to prognosis and intensity of treatment according\r\nas one has to deal with a benign or malignant parasite. More exact\r\ninformation (and with the expenditure of much less time) can be\r\nobtained from a smear stained with some Romanowsky modification than\r\nby examining a fresh preparation.\r\n\r\n  At the same time it is advisable to make a wet preparation and\r\n  study it for amoeboid activity of the parasites and character of\r\n  the pigment while awaiting the completion of the staining process.\r\n\r\nIn the blood of a malarial anaemia the central vacuolation of many of\r\nthe red cells may give an appearance of young nonpigmented parasites.\r\nMalarial parasites tend to move about to take peripheral locations\r\nand furthermore they do not change in size upon focussing up and down\r\nas do the vacuoles.\r\n\r\n  Melaniferous leucocytes can be made out better in a fresh specimen\r\n  than in a dried, stained one.\r\n\r\nOne can better differentiate species by an even thin film than by a\r\nthick-film method. There is often great doubt with a thick film as\r\nto whether the object noted is an artifact or a parasite. The Ruge\r\nthick-film method has given very good results.\r\n\r\n  There is only a moderate variation from a normal white count but\r\n  in cases when the parasites are very scanty or when they have been\r\n  driven from the peripheral circulation by quinine treatment we may\r\n  make a tentative diagnosis of malaria on a leucocytosis during the\r\n  paroxysm with a leucopenia during the afebrile interval with, at\r\n  this time, an increase in the percentage of large mononuclears to\r\n  10 to 15%.\r\n\r\nMelaniferous leucocytes are rarely noted in the benign tertian\r\ninfections but in some of the very puzzling aestivo-autumnal fevers\r\nthey may give the diagnostic clue.\r\n\r\n  Schüffner’s dots are yellowish dots in the infected red cells\r\n  and are characteristic of benign tertian. The Maurer clefts of\r\n  malignant tertian are less commonly noted. Always carefully note\r\n  the pale, swollen, infected red cells of benign tertian, the\r\n  shrunken degenerated cell of malignant tertian and the normal one\r\n  of quartan. The fine hair-like ring of malignant tertian is often\r\n  noted on the periphery of the red cell as a narrow line while the\r\n  half-grown schizont of quartan is often seen as an equatorial band.\r\n\r\nIn the anaemia following malaria we may have very low red counts and\r\nhaemoglobin percentages. They usually run parallel, so that the color\r\nindex approximates 1.\r\n\r\n  Punctate basophilia is quite common in malarial anaemias. Up\r\n  to the present time the culturing of the parasite can scarcely\r\n  be considered an aid to diagnosis as it is difficult to carry\r\n  the development beyond one generation so that we do not get\r\n  multiplication of parasites. In cases where confusion exists as to\r\n  the nature of the species of parasite present culturing would help\r\n  as regards the possibility of noting the developmental stages of\r\n  _Plasmodium falciparum_.\r\n\r\n_Blackwater Fever._—The same points which hold for malaria hold for\r\nblackwater fever.\r\n\r\n  The striking feature of blackwater, from the side of the blood, is\r\n  the rapid and great reduction in red cells and haemoglobin. As a\r\n  result of the pathognomonic haemoglobinuria we may have in a few\r\n  days a fall of red cells from 4 or 5 million to approximately 1\r\n  million with haemoglobin down to 20%. The color index is usually\r\n  about 1. The blood is thin and the serum tinged. Probably from\r\n  the excessive haemolysis one does not see degenerated cells\r\n  as frequently as would be expected. Tests for acidosis and\r\n  coagulability of the blood are indicated as there is a reduction in\r\n  titrable alkalinity of the serum and coagulation rate.\r\n\r\n_Oroya Fever._—This disease, within two or three weeks, gives\r\nthe blood picture of a marked pernicious anaemia. The rod-shaped\r\nprotozoon may be seen lying in the red cells singly or in V-shapes.\r\n\r\n  These rods show a chromatin granule at one extremity. Normoblasts\r\n  are very numerous and megaloblasts appear later. There is both\r\n  polychromatophilia and poikilocytosis. The color index is that of\r\n  pernicious anaemia, above 1. The leucocytes are increased to about\r\n  20,000 with 75% of neutrophiles, among which are many immature\r\n  forms or metamyelocytes. The pathological process shows its\r\n  greatest activity in the bone marrow.\r\n\r\n_Malta Fever._—In this disease blood cultures offer the surest and\r\nmost practical way of making the diagnosis. The blood should be taken\r\nfrom a vein at the time of the height of the fever rise. To prevent\r\ncoagulation the blood should be forced from the syringe into about\r\nan equal amount of citrated salt solution and subsequently added to\r\nmelted agar to then be poured into Petri dishes. Cultures can also be\r\nmade by smearing the citrated blood over poured plates of agar.\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that the colonies are quite small and do not\r\n  develop for four or five days.\r\n\r\nThe citrated blood can also be added to bouillon. The blood culturing\r\nhas rather replaced the culturing from spleen juice. As the coccus is\r\nin the blood it is eliminated in the urine and plates should be made\r\nfrom the urine as well as the blood.\r\n\r\n  Malta fever is one of the diseases which can be diagnosed quite\r\n  early by agglutination tests, the reaction often appearing before\r\n  the end of the first week and often continuing for months after\r\n  recovery. There is a liability to error when low dilutions are\r\n  employed so that the former use of dilutions of 1 to 20 and 1 to\r\n  40 is no longer advised. Probably a dilution of 1 to 100 would be\r\n  sufficiently specific but dilutions of 1 to 500 and even higher are\r\n  frequently obtained. It is now thought best to heat the patient’s\r\n  serum to 56°C. for twenty minutes before applying the test so as\r\n  to destroy nonspecific agglutinins. Opsonic index and complement\r\n  fixation tests have been employed in diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAs the disease progresses a secondary anaemia develops. The white\r\ncount is about normal but with the polymorphonuclears somewhat\r\nreduced in percentage and the mononuclears increased.\r\n\r\n  Some observers have reported a leucopenia as of some diagnostic\r\n  value but others find the leucocyte count normal and Rogers\r\n  considers the absence of leucopenia as differentiating kala-azar\r\n  from Malta fever.\r\n\r\n_Plague._—In septicaemic plague blood cultures offer the surest\r\nmethod of diagnosis as clinically there may be very little to suggest\r\nplague. This is about the only disease in which one may find the\r\ncausative bacterium in a blood smear. For this examination the\r\nthick-film method has been recommended. Just as with the material\r\nfrom a puncture of a bubo or the sputum from plague pneumonia we\r\nshould employ animal inoculation as well as cultural procedures with\r\nthe blood.\r\n\r\n  We usually have a marked leucocytosis due to a great increase in\r\n  the polymorphonuclears. The white count may exceed 50,000. Just as\r\n  septicaemic plague may so overwhelm the organism that it does not\r\n  respond with fever so may the leucocytosis be absent. Bubonic and\r\n  pneumonic plague tend to become septicaemic, so that in such types\r\n  of the disease we may obtain results with blood cultures.\r\n\r\n_Liver Abscess._—Schilling-Torgau brings out the point that even\r\nwith an absence of the usual blood findings it is possible to\r\ndiagnose the disease and make a just prognosis with his method of\r\ndifferential counting. Ordinarily we have a leucocytosis of from\r\ntwelve to twenty thousand with only about 70% of polymorphonuclears\r\nand about 12 to 15% of large mononuclears. When a bacterial\r\ninfection accompanies the amoebic one of course the leucocytosis and\r\npolymorphonuclear percentage reach higher figures. The eosinophiles\r\nmay entirely disappear in an uncomplicated case of amoebic abscess.\r\n\r\n  In comparing his method with the ordinary one Schilling-Torgau\r\n  notes a case with a differential count showing 72% of\r\n  polymorphonuclears, 17% of lymphocytes and 8% of large mononuclears\r\n  with a white count of 6000—apparently a normal blood. By his\r\n  method 33% of these neutrophiles were found to be of the band-form\r\n  or less mature cells, thus showing that the blood really did\r\n  deviate from the normal.\r\n\r\n  In other examinations he noted very unfavorable indications from\r\n  the high percentage of metamyelocytes and even myelocytes when the\r\n  ordinary count did not suggest the serious condition.\r\n\r\n  As stated previously this method would seem to offer many\r\n  advantages over the ordinary one.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosomiasis._—While the blood, when examined in ordinary\r\nsmears or with thick-film methods, does not give as good results\r\nas by examining the gland juice for trypanosomes, yet, by taking\r\n5 or 10 cc. of blood in citrated salt solution with 2 or 3\r\ncentrifugalizations, we may obtain greater success in finding the\r\nparasites in this way than when using gland juice.\r\n\r\n  In wet preparations we may note the clumping of the red cells.\r\n  This is the phenomenon of auto-agglutination thought by some to be\r\n  rather characteristic of trypanosomiasis.\r\n\r\nWe may carry out the leucocyte attachment test using the inactivated\r\nserum of the suspected patient.\r\n\r\n  As the disease progresses we get a secondary anaemia. The leucocyte\r\n  count is usually normal but the differential count shows an\r\n  increase in the large mononuclears. Bacterial infections often\r\n  supervene when a leucocytosis will be noted.\r\n\r\n_Kala-azar._—Quite recently there has been success in the diagnosis\r\nof kala-azar by culturing the blood of the suspect on N. N. N.\r\nmedium. The key to success when culturing from the blood is to\r\nwait for two or three weeks before giving up the examination\r\nof the cultures. It will be remembered that almost invariably\r\nleishman bodies are present in the blood only in extremely small\r\nnumbers so that there is not time by the end of a few days for\r\nsufficient development to have taken place. In probably 80% of\r\ncases the parasite of kala-azar may be found in stained smears\r\nfrom the peripheral blood but only after prolonged and patient\r\nsearch. They may be found phagocytized by large mononuclears or\r\npolymorphonuclears. Of course splenic puncture examinations show\r\nfar greater abundance of parasites than blood smears but it is not\r\nwithout danger.\r\n\r\n  The marked anaemia of kala-azar does not appear until the earlier\r\n  symptoms of fever and splenic enlargement have gone on for some\r\n  time. Very characteristic and important in diagnosis, however, is\r\n  the marked leucopenia of kala-azar, approximating 2000 leucocytes\r\n  on the average. Again the white cells are only about in the\r\n  proportion of 1 to 1000 red cells. There is an increase in the\r\n  percentage of large mononuclears. Some authorities have reported an\r\n  acidosis of the blood serum. Coagulation rate is delayed.\r\n\r\n  In kala-azar the coagulability of the serum is altered as shown by\r\n  the formol-gel test. In this test, a drop of clear serum from the\r\n  patient is placed on a slide which is then inverted over a watch\r\n  glass containing a few drops of liquor formaldehyde. In cases of\r\n  kala-azar the serum will solidify, appearing as an opaque, stiff\r\n  jelly which adheres to the slide; while other sera will remain\r\n  fluid, running off the slide when it is tilted. The reaction\r\n  appears not to be specific since it has been reported for syphilis\r\n  and other diseases.\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fever._—The spirochaetes are not so numerous in the blood\r\nof the peripheral circulation in tropical relapsing fevers as in\r\nthose of Europe.\r\n\r\n  The spirochaetes can best be seen in stained smears but the\r\n  agitation of the red cells in a wet preparation by the motile\r\n  spiral organisms is of assistance in their recognition. Dark-field\r\n  illumination, India ink smears and Fontana’s silver method are used\r\n  as well as Giemsa staining.\r\n\r\nDuring the afebrile period the parasites disappear from the\r\nperipheral circulation.\r\n\r\n  If the disease is first seen during the afebrile stage we may try\r\n  Lowenthal’s reaction, which consists in taking a drop of the blood\r\n  of the suspected patient, mixing it on a vaseline ringed slide with\r\n  the blood of a patient showing spirochaetes, then covering with a\r\n  cover-glass and incubating for thirty minutes at 37°C. A positive\r\n  reaction shows clumping and loss of motility of the spirochaetes.\r\n\r\n  Reports vary as to the white count but on the whole there would\r\n  seem to be more evidence in favor of a moderate leucocytosis\r\n  although some observers have noted a fall from the normal. The\r\n  usual statements give a leucocytosis of from 12 to 15 thousand with\r\n  a polymorphonuclear increase to between 75 and 80%. The statement\r\n  is usually made that the normal percentage of large mononuclears\r\n  helps in the differentiation of malaria. Kieseritzky has reported\r\n  leucopenia and slight increase in lymphocytes.\r\n\r\n  The leucocyte count tends to be higher about the time of crisis.\r\n\r\n_Weil’s Disease._—This spirochaete infection is due to _Leptospira\r\nicterohaemorrhagiae_. The spirochaete has been found in the blood\r\nand has possibly been cultured anaerobically from the blood. The\r\npractical method is by inoculating guinea pigs with blood or\r\nurine sediment. Spirochaetes are found in the liver smears of the\r\nsick guinea pigs. In the first week of Weil’s disease we have a\r\nleucocytosis—later on a leucopenia.\r\n\r\n_Filariasis._—The sheathed embryos of _Filaria bancrofti_ are found\r\nin the peripheral circulation at night only, hence _F. nocturna_,\r\nwhile those of _F. loa_ are only to be found in the daytime, hence\r\n_F. diurna_. In the islands of the South Pacific the filarial\r\ninfection is considered as of _F. bancrofti_ but the embryos are\r\npresent in the peripheral circulation both by day and by night.\r\n\r\n  Instead of being uncommon it seems rather to be the rule to fail\r\n  to find embryos in the blood preparations in cases showing marked\r\n  evidences of filarial disease, as in elephantiasis, calabar\r\n  swellings, etc. The positive blood findings are most frequent in\r\n  those who do not as yet show symptoms. There has not yet been\r\n  sufficient obstruction in the lymphatics to keep the embryos from\r\n  reaching the blood stream.\r\n\r\nIn some countries where a large percentage of the population may show\r\nembryos in the peripheral circulation, manifestations of the disease\r\nare very rare.\r\n\r\n  We may examine the blood either with fresh preparations, when the\r\n  movements of the embryos assist in their detection, or by staining\r\n  dried smears. Haematoxylin staining is better than the Romanowsky\r\n  one as the break in cells and other points are better brought out.\r\n\r\n  An eosinophilia is usually considered as constantly present but\r\n  this is not invariable. The leucocyte count is about normal.\r\n\r\n_Dengue and Phlebotomus Fever._—In these diseases a leucopenia,\r\nwhich begins to show itself by the second day, is very characteristic.\r\n\r\n  The average leucocyte count is about 3500 and along with this we\r\n  have a reduction in the percentage of polymorphonuclears to about\r\n  50%. Towards the end of the terminal fever we have an increase in\r\n  the percentage of large mononuclears.\r\n\r\n_Bacillary Dysentery._—The agglutination tests are of little value\r\nin diagnosing the presence of or type of an infection with dysentery\r\nbacilli, as the agglutinating power does not appear until during\r\nconvalescence.\r\n\r\n  It is now customary to use a polyvalent antidysenteric serum\r\n  in treatment so that it is not very essential to ascertain the\r\n  strain involved in an infection. As a practical matter we make our\r\n  diagnosis of the presence as well as type of dysentery bacillus\r\n  involved in an infection by isolating the organism from the\r\n  dysenteric stool.\r\n\r\n  During the fever we may have a moderate polymorphonuclear\r\n  leucocytosis.\r\n\r\n_Enteric Group of Fevers._—In fevers of atypical course in the\r\ntropics one must always remember that _typhoid_ and the _paratyphoid\r\nfevers_ are anything but uncommon and blood cultures should always be\r\nmade when such suspicion arises. In some tropical regions paratyphoid\r\nA infections seem most common although the usual experience is to\r\nencounter the paratyphoid B infection more frequently. In temperate\r\nclimates the noting of a moderate leucopenia with an absence of\r\neosinophiles is important in the diagnosis of typhoid, but in the\r\ntropics there are so many intestinal parasites and skin infections\r\nproductive of eosinophilia that we cannot attach any importance to\r\nsuch a finding.\r\n\r\n_Typhus Fever._—Plotz attaches importance to the culturing of\r\n_B. typhi exanthematici_ from the blood of typhus cases, but the\r\nrelationship is now regarded as not causal. _Rickettsia_ bodies,\r\nwhich can be demonstrated in the louse or in capillaries at autopsy,\r\nare now considered to be the exciting organism.\r\n\r\n  A mononuclear leucocytosis has at times been reported.\r\n\r\n_Spotted Fever of the Rocky Mountains._—Injection of the blood of\r\nthe patient into guinea pigs produces the disease in the animal.\r\nFrick has reported the finding of chromatin-staining bodies in the\r\nred cells of such pigs and Wolbach has found chromatin-staining\r\nbacteria in the endothelial cells of such animals. These bodies are\r\nnow classed as _Rickettsia_.\r\n\r\n  These findings cannot as yet be considered of diagnostic value.\r\n\r\n_Various Helminthological Infections._—In the earlier stages of\r\nancylostomiasis and schistosomiasis we have a rather notable increase\r\nin the percentage of eosinophiles but with the advanced stages of\r\nthese infections, with severe anaemia, the eosinophiles may even be\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\n  One should always keep in mind the very characteristic and marked\r\n  eosinophilia of _trichinosis_ when such a blood finding is\r\n  encountered. There is often a leucocytosis of 15,000 to 20,000 in\r\n  this disease.\r\n\r\nIn the _urticarial fever_ stage of _Japanese schistosomiasis_\r\nthe marked eosinophilia is of great assistance in diagnosis. One\r\ntrouble about attaching importance to eosinophilia in the tropics\r\nis the confusion which is difficult to eliminate and which arises\r\nfrom infections with the more common but less important group of\r\nintestinal parasites such as _Ascaris_, _Trichuris_, etc.\r\n\r\n  The eosinophilia-producing characteristics of many skin diseases\r\n  must also be kept in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULATORY, RESPIRATORY AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEMS TOGETHER WITH\r\nANAEMIA, HAEMORRHAGES AND OEDEMA IN TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n_Beriberi._—Almost as important in diagnosis as the weakness of\r\nthe legs, with anaesthetic and oedematous areas, is the early\r\npalpitation of the heart upon the slightest exertion. Later on as\r\nthe vagal degeneration becomes more prominent we have a loss of the\r\nnormal cardiac rhythm, to even become embryocardial, together with\r\ndilatation of the right heart, pulsating jugulars and various blowing\r\nmurmurs, which are propagated into the vessels of the neck. The pulse\r\nis weak and rapid and this combination of a tumultuous heart action\r\nand weak pulse is striking. Blood pressure is below normal.\r\n\r\n  Cardiac involvement is also a feature of _ship beriberi_ as well\r\n  as _infantile beriberi_. In the latter a marked hypertrophy of the\r\n  right heart is characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn _yellow fever_ we have at first a high blood pressure. The pulse\r\nrate, which at first corresponds with the rise of temperature, soon\r\nshows Faget’s law—a falling pulse with a constant temperature or a\r\nconstant pulse with a rising temperature. It is a markedly slow pulse\r\nafter the third day. The blood pressure is low in the asthenic stage.\r\n\r\n  In _dengue_ we do not have the rise in blood pressure but the slow\r\n  pulse is quite a feature of many of the dengue-like fevers.\r\n\r\n  In _blackwater fever_ the pulse is rapid and soon becomes weak and\r\n  of low tension.\r\n\r\n  _Plague_ shows a striking toxic action on the heart muscle so that\r\n  we soon get a soft, dicrotic pulse, rapid from the first and soon\r\n  becoming thready. Patients with plague may die from cardiac failure\r\n  upon getting up from bed.\r\n\r\n  A rapid pulse, especially in the morning, is thought to be a\r\n  feature of _active leprosy_.\r\n\r\nIn _cholera_ the pulse is rapid and feeble during the stage of\r\nevacuation and with the onset of the algid stage we practically have\r\na cessation of the circulation. The systolic pressure may fall as low\r\nas 65 or 70 mm.\r\n\r\n_Hookworm anaemia_ shows early and marked cardiac palpitation. The\r\npulse rate averages about 110 and the blood pressure is low. There is\r\noften some right-side dilatation of the heart.\r\n\r\n  _Malaria_ generally gives a small, rapid, high tension pulse in the\r\n  cold stage to become full and bounding in the hot stage. A cardiac\r\n  type of pernicious malarial fever has been described, particularly\r\n  by the French.\r\n\r\n  Both _Malta fever_ and _bacillary dysentery_ tend to have a toxic\r\n  effect on the heart.\r\n\r\n_Typhus fever_ is a disease which tends markedly to affect the heart.\r\nAlong with faint heart sounds we have a rapid, low tension pulse. In\r\n_bacillary dysentery_ the tendency to an increase in pulse rate is of\r\nsome value in differentiating it from amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  _African trypanosomiasis_ shows a rapid pulse rate whether the\r\n  case shows temperature or not. In _Brazilian trypanosomiasis_\r\n  the parasites may tend to invade the cells of the heart muscle\r\n  thus producing manifestations of myocardial disease. The parasite\r\n  (_Schizotrypanum cruzi_) may also affect the adrenals, causing a\r\n  low blood pressure along with other signs of Addison’s disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n_Sputum Examination._—We should make a routine of examining a\r\nfresh specimen of sputum as well as stained smears. It is in such a\r\nspecimen we search for the ova of the lung fluke.\r\n\r\n  Frequently the material submitted for examination as sputum is\r\n  simply buccal or pharyngeal secretion, or more probably secretion\r\n  from the nasopharynx, which has been secured by hawking. It should\r\n  always be insisted upon that the sputum be raised by a true\r\n  pulmonary coughing act, and not expelled with the hacking cough\r\n  so frequently associated with an elongated uvula. When there is\r\n  an effort to deceive, some information may be obtained from the\r\n  watery, stringy mucoid character of the buccopharyngeal material\r\n  and also from the presence of mosaic-like groups of flat epithelial\r\n  cells (often packed with bacteria).\r\n\r\nThe pulmonary secretion is either frothy mucus or mucopurulent\r\nmaterial, and if the cells are alveolar they greatly resemble the\r\nplasma cells. At times these cells may contain blood-pigment granules\r\n(heart-disease cells).\r\n\r\n  In the microscopic examination a small, cheesy particle, the size\r\n  of a pin head, should be selected. This should be flattened out\r\n  in a thin layer between the slide and cover-glass and should be\r\n  examined for elastic tissue, heart-disease cells, eggs of animal\r\n  parasites, amoebae, and fungi. _Echinococcus_ hooklets, Curschman\r\n  spirals besprinkled with Charcot-Leyden crystals, and haematoidin\r\n  and fatty acid crystals may also be observed.\r\n\r\n  Curschman spirals indicate bronchial as against cardiac or uraemic\r\n  asthma. Charcot-Leyden crystals have no special significance,\r\n  except in certain tropical diseases when these crystals often are\r\n  present in paragonomiasis sputum and in the pus of amoebic liver\r\n  abscesses discharging by way of the lungs.\r\n\r\nIt may facilitate the examination of the sputum for elastic tissue\r\nand actinomycosis and other fungi to add 10% sodium hydrate to the\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n  To make smears for staining, the sputum should be poured on a\r\n  flat surface, preferably a Petri dish, and a bit of mucopurulent\r\n  material selected with forceps. A dark background facilitates\r\n  picking out the particle. A toothpick is well adapted to smearing\r\n  out such material on a slide. After using the toothpick it can be\r\n  burned. When dry, the smear is best fixed by pouring a few drops\r\n  of alcohol on the slide, allowing this to run over the surface,\r\n  and then, after dashing off the excess of alcohol, to ignite that\r\n  remaining on the film in the flame and allow to burn out.\r\n\r\nIn _beriberi_ we have shortness of breath with the early cardiac\r\npalpitation. In acute pernicious beriberi the pulmonary congestion\r\nand oedema divide with the heart the terrible manifestations of such\r\nan attack. The diaphragm may become paralyzed in beriberi. Some\r\nauthors refer to the dyspnoea of beriberi as the beriberic corset.\r\n\r\n_Paragonomiasis_ gives rise to a chronic cough attended with\r\nthe expectoration of more or less bloody sputum containing ova.\r\nHaemoptysis is not infrequent. The physical signs on percussion are\r\nslight but may be more marked on auscultation.\r\n\r\n  _Hirudiniasis._—In Northern Africa, as well as in many islands of\r\n  the Orient, the drinking water of ponds may contain leeches and\r\n  these water-leeches tend to attach themselves to the pharyngeal\r\n  mucosa. They may also attach themselves to the tissues about the\r\n  larynx. In these cases we not only have cough and haemoptysis\r\n  but dyspnoea from laryngeal oedema. It is probable that cases of\r\n  dyspnoea called _halzoun_, and due to the attachment in the region\r\n  of the larynx of flukes (_Fasciola hepatica_), as the result\r\n  of eating raw liver, may often be due to leeches, as the two\r\n  affections occur in the same regions.\r\n\r\n_Plague pneumonia_ is characterized by profound prostration in a\r\npatient whose physical signs do not seem to justify such extreme\r\nillness. The rather abundant and watery sputum soon becomes\r\nsanguinolent. Herpes labialis is absent. Besides primary plague\r\npneumonia which develops directly from contact with a former case we\r\nhave a secondary pneumonia which develops in the course of a typical\r\ncase of bubonic plague.\r\n\r\n  In _malaria_ we have a slight bronchitis in the ordinary types and\r\n  many recognize a pulmonary type of pernicious malaria.\r\n\r\n_Malta fever_ tends to show a bronchial involvement about the twelfth\r\nday of the disease. Crepitant râles, a moderate cough and slight\r\ndyspnoea may be noted. It was the presence of pulmonary signs along\r\nwith the profuse sweating and anaemia of the disease that justified\r\nthe designation Mediterranean phthisis.\r\n\r\n  In _liver abscess_ the crepitation at the base of the right lung,\r\n  following congestion incident to the abscess of the right lobe of\r\n  the liver, is of value in diagnosis. Rupture of a liver abscess\r\n  into the lung occurs in about 10% of cases.\r\n\r\n  In _heat stroke_ we may have Cheyne-Stokes respiration and\r\n  pulmonary oedema.\r\n\r\n  _Japanese river fever_ often shows bronchial involvement and cough\r\n  at the time of the height of the fever.\r\n\r\n  In _ancylostomiasis_ cases with cough and bronchitis have been\r\n  reported and it seems probable that such manifestations may be\r\n  connected with the course of the larvae through the pulmonary\r\n  passages to reach the intestinal tract.\r\n\r\nThe filarial embryos of _F. bancrofti_ remain in the lung capillaries\r\nduring the day and recently such embryos have been found in blood\r\ncoughed up from the lungs.\r\n\r\n  _Katayama disease_ may show a localized bronchitis early in the\r\n  attack and from its rapid appearance and disappearance would seem\r\n  to be a sort of patchy pulmonary oedema. This is connected with the\r\n  passage of the larvae through the lungs.\r\n\r\n  Broncho-pneumonia is probably the most common complication of\r\n  _typhus fever_.\r\n\r\nAn affection known as _gangosa_ or _rhino-pharyngitis mutilans_\r\ncauses great tissue loss about nasal and buccal cavity. The voice has\r\na peculiar nasal quality. It is possibly a manifestation of tertiary\r\nyaws.\r\n\r\n  _Kala-azar_ patients are often carried off by a terminal pneumonia\r\n  probably connected with the leucopenia and marked diminution of\r\n  polymorphonuclears.\r\n\r\n  In _leprosy_, also, the victims are frequently carried off by\r\n  pulmonary tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fever._—In relapsing fever there is frequently a moderate\r\nbronchitis at the time of the first febrile accession.\r\n\r\n  _Bronchial Spirochaetosis._—There is a condition which more or\r\n  less resembles lobar pneumonia, even to rusty sputum, but without\r\n  signs of consolidation, and with negative Roentgenograms, when\r\n  we find spirochaetes in the sputum. Another type of _bronchial\r\n  spirochaetosis_ is when the clinical picture is more that\r\n  of pulmonary tuberculosis. There is question whether these\r\n  spirochaetes are causative or only accidental.\r\n\r\n  Cases have been reported where a phthisis-like condition was due\r\n  to a mould infection (_Monilia_). While such a condition may be\r\n  primary it is more often secondary in cachexias as may be the\r\n  case with buccal _Monilia_ infections (thrush) which occur in the\r\n  victims of cachectic states.\r\n\r\n  _Guha._—In Guam there is also a rather fatal capillary bronchitis\r\n  affecting young children which goes under the name of epidemic\r\n  asthma or, as termed by the natives, guha. This affection comes on\r\n  during the rainy season and is attended with marked dyspnoea and\r\n  slight elevation of temperature.\r\n\r\n_Nasal Myiasis._—In the tropical and subtropical parts of North and\r\nSouth America a fly, _Chrysomyia macellaria_, is apt to deposit its\r\neggs about the nasal orifices of persons with an offensive discharge\r\nfrom the nose. The fly seems to be attracted by foul odors. The\r\nlarvae which develop are called “screw-worms” on account of the\r\nsegmental bands of bristles and tend to invade the various sinuses,\r\ncausing great destruction of tissue.\r\n\r\n  The case sets in with signs of a very severe coryza, together with\r\n  fever and marked frontal headache. The face becomes swollen, red,\r\n  and tender in the region of the nose. As the larvae reach maturity\r\n  they come out of the nose. A nasal douche of 15 parts chloroform in\r\n  100 parts milk is often efficacious in bringing away the larvae. At\r\n  times _Sacrophaga_ larvae may be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM\r\n\r\n_Plague._—The buboes are the most characteristic feature of the\r\nmore common form of plague, bubonic plague. There may also be slight\r\nenlargement and tenderness of the glands in septicaemic and pneumonic\r\nplague but many such cases fail to show any evidence of superficial\r\nglandular enlargement. In pestis minor the only feature suggestive of\r\nplague is the glandular enlargement.\r\n\r\n  Very characteristic of the glandular involvement in plague is\r\n  the marked tenderness of such glands. The slight pressure of\r\n  palpation causes some pain and a sharp punch over an affected\r\n  gland, excruciating pain. So exquisitely painful are these buboes\r\n  that the patient with groin or axillary buboes will flex the leg or\r\n  extend the arm to relieve pressure. In about 70% of cases the bubo\r\n  is located in the groin, with 15% to 20% for axillary involvement\r\n  and 5% to 10% for the submaxillary or cervical region. There may\r\n  be involvement of both deep and superficial glands of a region,\r\n  such buboes giving a large area of induration. As a rule there is\r\n  a single bubo. The bubo is formed not only by the glands but by a\r\n  periglandular oedema which fuses the glands into a solid mass. The\r\n  buboes tend to suppurate about the commencement of the second week,\r\n  so that gland puncture with subsequent culturing for plague bacilli\r\n  and animal inoculation should be carried out before this time as\r\n  pyogenic organisms replace the plague bacilli upon suppuration\r\n  taking place.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosomiasis._—One of the characteristics of the disease\r\nrecognized as diagnostic more than 100 years ago is enlargement of\r\nthe glands of the posterior cervical triangle (Winterbottom’s sign).\r\n\r\n  There may be general enlargement of the lymphatic glands which\r\n  are rather hard, discrete and not bound down to the overlying\r\n  skin. These glands may be somewhat tender or entirely painless.\r\n  One of the most valuable methods of diagnosis of trypanosomiasis\r\n  is by gland puncture, the juice obtained therefrom being examined\r\n  in smear or inoculated into a monkey or guinea pig. Brazilian\r\n  trypanosomiasis also shows glandular involvement.\r\n\r\n_Filariasis._—Varicose groin glands are frequently associated with\r\nlymph scrotum, chylocele or chyluria. The glandular masses are soft\r\nand doughy. The consistency is often that of a lipoma.\r\n\r\n  The overlying skin slips over the glandular mass. These glands are\r\n  often mistaken for inguinal hernia. They do not give a tympanitic\r\n  note and disappear slowly upon firm pressure with the patient lying\r\n  down but return even with the pressure maintained upon assuming the\r\n  upright position. There is no impulse on coughing. If a sterile\r\n  hypodermic needle be inserted into the mass a chylous fluid slowly\r\n  and persistently comes out of the needle drop by drop and this\r\n  material may show filarial embryos.\r\n\r\nThe filarial worms _Onchocerca volvulus_ obstruct the lymphatics and\r\nmay give rise to swellings of considerable size along the course of\r\nthe lymphatics.\r\n\r\n_Climatic Bubo._—The onset is gradual often accompanied by a low\r\nremittent type of fever. There is an absence of venereal sore.\r\n\r\n  These glands are only slightly tender and are often called fatigue\r\n  glands as they produce a feeling of weariness after even moderate\r\n  exercise. The inguinal glands of one or both sides are the ones\r\n  involved but the overlying skin does not show the redness of a\r\n  chancroidal or gonorrhoeal bubo. There is often a softening in the\r\n  center of the affected glands.\r\n\r\n_Tsutsugamushi._—The glands which drain the area in which is located\r\nthe ulcer at the site of the bite of the Kedani mite show swelling\r\nand tenderness.\r\n\r\n_Rat bite fever_ also shows glandular enlargement in the glands\r\ntributary to the healed infecting bite of the rat.\r\n\r\nIn _tularaemia_ the lymph glands draining the site of the infecting\r\nbite become inflamed and swollen, often suppurating.\r\n\r\n  In _leprosy_ the glands draining involved regions become enlarged\r\n  but do not show a tendency to suppuration. The glands most\r\n  frequently involved are the cervical and groin glands.\r\n\r\nIn _kala-azar_ the recommendation has lately been made to excise the\r\nsomewhat enlarged glands and make smears from a piece of such gland\r\nand then examine the smear for leishman bodies. Gland puncture has\r\nnot given as satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n  It is often stated that the superficial cervical glands are\r\n  enlarged in _dengue_ but not in dengue-like fevers. I have not\r\n  observed in the cases I have seen either constant or well marked\r\n  glandular enlargements.\r\n\r\nIn _yaws_ there may be glandular enlargement. According to Finucane\r\nthe cervical glands are often involved in Fiji children. These glands\r\ndo not tend to break down.\r\n\r\n  In _pediculosis_ of the hairy scalp the scratching back of the\r\n  neck may result in pus infection with enlargement of the tributary\r\n  cervical glands.\r\n\r\n  _American leishmaniasis._—Not only is there often enlargement of\r\n  the lymphatic glands but likewise we may have lymphangitis lines\r\n  leading from the ulcer to the glands. The glands may be large and\r\n  painful and may remain enlarged after the recovery of the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nANAEMIA\r\n\r\nThe old idea that tropical life produced an anaemia is no longer\r\nheld, the view now being that such anaemic conditions are almost\r\ninvariably due to some well recognized cause, the most important of\r\nwhich is malaria. Natives of the tropics may appear bleached out but\r\nshow a normal red count and haemoglobin percentage. Chamberlain’s\r\nobservations have shown that a residence in the tropics of\r\napproximately two years has no appreciable influence on the red cell\r\ncount or haemoglobin content of the blood of white men and that the\r\nactinic rays do not seem to be operative in producing anaemia.\r\n\r\n  _Malarial Cachexia._—Although the malignant tertian infection\r\n  has the greatest tendency to produce anaemia yet any type may,\r\n  when untreated, bring about the more or less profound anaemia with\r\n  earthy skin, enlarged spleen, dyspnoea on slight exertion, and\r\n  oedema of the ankles characteristic of malarial cachexia.\r\n\r\n_Oroya Fever._—In this disease we have what might well be termed\r\na fulminating pernicious anaemia. The rod-shaped protozoon which\r\nattacks the red cells seems to be peculiarly active in the bone\r\nmarrow, excruciating bone pains being quite a feature of the disease.\r\n\r\n  There may be a reduction in red cells to one million per c.mm.\r\n  within a few days. Normoblasts are abundant and megaloblasts may be\r\n  observed in the more severe cases. The anaemia is intense and 20%\r\n  to 40% of cases die within two or three weeks. A severe anaemia in\r\n  which the blood picture is that of pernicious anaemia may accompany\r\n  infections with the _Balantidium coli_.\r\n\r\n_Blackwater fever_ may produce a fall in red cells almost as marked\r\nas in Oroya fever.\r\n\r\n  _Sprue_ shows a slowly progressive anaemia which in the later\r\n  stages of the disease may become extreme, going down to one\r\n  million, with a fairly high color index.\r\n\r\n_Ancylostomiasis_ is along with malaria the disease to be first\r\nthought of in connection with anaemia. The splenic enlargement of\r\nmalaria should be thought of, although the view has recently been\r\nadvanced that the spleen may be enlarged in hookworm disease.\r\n\r\n  In advanced cases of hookworm disease, showing a picture of\r\n  profound anaemia, there may be so few worms present that the\r\n  method of making diagnosis by finding ova may be unsuccessful. I\r\n  have seen a case of typical aplastic pernicious anaemia, confirmed\r\n  by autopsy, undoubtedly following a vicious cycle set up by the\r\n  hookworm infection, in which scarcely a worm was to be found in\r\n  searching the intestines.\r\n\r\n_Kala-azar_ gives a marked anaemia with an earthy color of the skin.\r\nThe leucopenia and splenic enlargement are characteristic and the\r\nfinding of parasites confirmatory.\r\n\r\n_Malta fever_ is usually followed by a moderate anaemia.\r\n\r\n  The _helminthic infections_, besides hookworm disease, are always\r\n  to be thought of in the presence of anaemia. Very important among\r\n  these are rectal and vesical schistosomiasis as well as that from\r\n  the Japanese schistosome, together with liver and lung fluke\r\n  disease. Even the ordinary round-worm, _Ascaris lumbricoides_, is\r\n  to be thought of in a tropical anaemia.\r\n\r\n  Cases of anaemia, in which no other demonstrable cause has been\r\n  noted, have been thought to be due to _trichocephaliasis_.\r\n\r\n_Tropical dysenteries_ are often responsible for anaemia and in\r\nliver abscess the patient becomes quite earthy in color, provided no\r\noperation is performed. In chyluria there is a marked drain on the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n  The anaemia in _liver abscess_ is not so great as the muddy\r\n  complexion would indicate. The emaciation is greater than the\r\n  anaemia.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAEMORRHAGES\r\n\r\nThe loss of blood through haemoglobinuria and haematuria has been\r\ntaken up under the urine. The haemoglobinuria is the pathognomonic\r\nsymptom of blackwater fever. There is also recognized a haemorrhagic\r\nform of pernicious malaria with epistaxis and alimentary tract\r\nhaemorrhages. Moderate haemoglobinuria may be found in severe cases\r\nof malignant tertian infections.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Fever._—During the asthenic period of the disease, which\r\nsets in about the fourth day, we have, as a result of the damage to\r\nthe endothelial lining of the capillaries, various haemorrhages.\r\n\r\n  Of these the best known and most dreaded is that from the stomach,\r\n  black vomit. The bleeding from the gums is apt to appear before\r\n  that from the stomach. Not only may bleeding occur from the\r\n  intestines but from any mucosa, as that of the nose, conjunctiva or\r\n  vagina.\r\n\r\nIn _vesical and rectal bilharziasis_ the perforation of the terminal\r\nbranches of the portal vein by the terminal or lateral spined eggs\r\ngives rise to haemorrhages.\r\n\r\n  In _dengue_ we may have an epistaxis at the time of the crisis of\r\n  the first febrile paroxysm.\r\n\r\n  In _dysentery_ the blood-admixed mucous stools are of diagnostic\r\n  importance.\r\n\r\n  In _endemic haemoptysis_ the operculated eggs of _Paragonimus\r\n  westermanni_ are to be sought for in the sputum.\r\n\r\n  In _leprosy_ epistaxis may be an early sign.\r\n\r\nThe damage to the endothelial lining of capillaries in _plague_ gives\r\nrise to frequent haemorrhages into the skin.\r\n\r\n  There is a question whether the hookworms abstract blood from the\r\n  intestines, although tests for occult blood are deemed important by\r\n  some authorities in the diagnosis of this disease.\r\n\r\n  The granulomatous lesions of _verruga_ are markedly haemorrhagic.\r\n\r\n  Some consider _ship beriberi_ to be of the nature of _scurvy_ in\r\n  which case one should have in mind spongy, bleeding gums and the\r\n  intramuscular haemorrhages of scurvy.\r\n\r\n_Typhus Fever._—The petechial rash of this disease (mulberry rash)\r\nis a distinctive feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nOEDEMA\r\n\r\nOedema, especially about the ankles, is to be looked for in all\r\nthe secondary anaemias of the tropics, particularly malaria and\r\nancylostomiasis.\r\n\r\n_Beriberi._—The oedema begins at first about the feet, especially\r\nabout the dorsal junction of phalanges and metatarsus. It is\r\ncharacteristically pretibial. It may remain confined to the shin or\r\ngo up to knees, scrotum, sternal region or trunk. It is generally\r\nsymmetrical but may be unilateral. It may become a general anasarca,\r\neven in forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n  The swelling of the face is at times enormous, the eyelids being so\r\n  oedematous that the patient can see only by separating them with\r\n  the fingers. The oedema is more solid than that of nephritis. It\r\n  not only rapidly appears but disappears as rapidly.\r\n\r\n  The oedema of beriberi may involve the glottis (oedema of glottis).\r\n\r\n  Oedema of genital regions is less marked than in nephritis or\r\n  cardiac disease. We may also have localized areas of oedema 3 or 4\r\n  inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Ship beriberi_, which has points in common with both beriberi and\r\nscurvy, shows oedema which may be limited to the lower extremities\r\nor generalized. _Epidemic dropsy_ is a type of beriberi in which\r\nthere are fever and an erythema over the dropsical areas.\r\n\r\n_Calabar Swellings._—These seem connected with infections with\r\n_Filaria loa_. The swellings originate suddenly and disappear in\r\nthree or four days. They are hard and do not pit on pressure. These\r\nsmooth swellings, often 2 to 4 inches in extent, are most often seen\r\non arms, face or ankles.\r\n\r\n  In _trypanosomiasis_ oedema of the face and especially of the\r\n  eyelids may be striking. There may also be patches of oedema\r\n  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn _Katayama disease_ the urticarial areas of oedema have given it\r\nthe name of urticarial fever.\r\n\r\n  A peculiar disease of North China, known as _atriplicism_, is\r\n  caused by the eating by the very poor of a weed, _Atriplex_, common\r\n  around Pekin. There is itching of the fingers, quickly followed by\r\n  swelling. This tends to extend to the back of the hands and up the\r\n  outer surface of the forearm. The face becomes so swollen that the\r\n  eyelids may be closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE AND THE LIVER AND SPLEEN IN TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE\r\n\r\nAlthough the appearance of jaundice immediately suggests a disease of\r\nthe liver yet as a matter of fact those diseases of the tropics in\r\nwhich the liver involvement is the sole or chief feature rarely show\r\nmarked jaundice.\r\n\r\n  In _tropical hepatitis_ or congestion of the liver or, as it is\r\n  often termed, tropical liver, there is rarely a distinct jaundice\r\n  and if such occur it is only temporary. Such terms as earthy,\r\n  muddy, sallow, sub-icteric or pale lemon tint are more often\r\n  applied than jaundice.\r\n\r\n  _Liver abscess_ rarely gives rise to a definite jaundice unless the\r\n  abscess be so situated as to cause pressure on the bile ducts.\r\n\r\n  In _clonorchiosis_, or the liver fluke disease of man, jaundice is\r\n  not a feature of the disease except in the very late stages.\r\n\r\n  In those liver cirrhoses associated with _Katayama disease_,\r\n  _malaria_ or _kala-azar_ there is no typical jaundice.\r\n\r\nThe tropical diseases in which jaundice is an important diagnostic\r\nfeature are yellow fever, blackwater fever, bilious remittent fever\r\nand relapsing fever.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Fever._—There are cases which succumb without having shown\r\njaundice but immediately following death the yellowish discoloration\r\nhas been noted. At autopsy the yellow fever cadaver is almost\r\ninvariably deeply jaundiced.\r\n\r\n  Very important is the fact that the jaundice of yellow fever does\r\n  not appear until late, about the third or fourth day. When jaundice\r\n  appears earlier, as by the second day, the prognosis is almost\r\n  surely a fatal one.\r\n\r\n  According to Dutroulau the designation red fever would be more\r\n  appropriate for the deeply congested facies of a yellow fever case\r\n  in its first days.\r\n\r\n  The icterus is more marked about the face, neck and upper parts of\r\n  the trunk. The albuminuria precedes the jaundice.\r\n\r\n_Blackwater Fever._—In a typical case of this disease we have within\r\na few hours a marked jaundice which tends to deepen. It is usually\r\nmore or less marked according as the haemoglobinuria may be. It does\r\nnot show the tendency to persist as does the jaundice of yellow fever.\r\n\r\n_Bilious Remittent Fever._—The jaundice appears rather earlier than\r\nthat of yellow fever but is rarely seen on the first day of the\r\nparoxysm as with blackwater fever.\r\n\r\n  Of great diagnostic value is the early appearance of bile-colored\r\n  urine as different from the haemoglobin-tinged urine of blackwater.\r\n  The albuminous urine of yellow fever is not apt to show any bile\r\n  coloring in the first three or four days of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fever._—There is a clinical type of relapsing fever\r\nassociated with jaundice and a high death rate which was first\r\ndescribed by Griesinger from Egypt. This icteric type is not\r\ninfrequent in Asia. This jaundice is late and the disease much\r\nresembles yellow fever. The enlarged painful spleen and the finding\r\nof spirochaetes in the peripheral circulation are essential to\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\n  _Weil’s disease._—Much interest has been recently aroused in\r\n  _Weil’s disease_, or epidemic jaundice, on account of the frequency\r\n  of the disease in soldiers in the Balkan campaign. While a\r\n  spirochaete has been shown by Inada and others to be the cause, yet\r\n  many workers have isolated paratyphoid B organisms from the blood\r\n  of such cases. Frugoni obtained cultures of this organism from the\r\n  duodenal fluid of 11 cases from 48 cases investigated. The accepted\r\n  cause of true Weil’s disease is _Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae_.\r\n  The jaundice begins about the third day of an irregular fever.\r\n  Like yellow fever these cases showed injection of the conjunctivae\r\n  and albuminuria. There were, however, usually a leucocytosis and\r\n  enlarged spleen.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases of _spotted fever of the Rocky Mountains_ we may\r\nhave a generalized jaundice. Rarely cases of _typhus fever_ may show\r\njaundice.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERATIONS IN SIZE OF THE LIVER\r\n\r\nThere is only a slight enlargement in the ordinary case of tropical\r\nliver but in some cases it may extend 3 or 4 fingers’ breadth below\r\nthe costal cartilages or rarely to the umbilicus.\r\n\r\n  In _liver abscess_ the enlargement is a rather late feature, and\r\n  the condition should be diagnosed before we have the assistance of\r\n  protruding ribs and distention of the intercostal spaces. As the\r\n  abscess is usually located in the upper portion of the right lobe\r\n  the enlargement is usually upwards and is best made out with the\r\n  X-ray, showing the cupola-like projection.\r\n\r\nIn _kala-azar_ the liver does not begin to enlarge until after about\r\nthree months from the time of onset at which time the spleen will\r\nbe quite large. Decided enlargement is generally noted by the sixth\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n  The liver cirrhoses due to _schistosomiasis_ or _malaria_ may show\r\n  slight enlargement or no particular change.\r\n\r\n  _Sprue_ is a disease which gives a decided atrophy of the liver.\r\n  Some authorities have noted a decrease of the size of the liver in\r\n  cholera. The liver of _yellow fever_ is of normal size and is not\r\n  associated with splenic enlargement.\r\n\r\n  In the tropics one must always keep in mind the possibility of a\r\n  liver enlargement being due to _syphilis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINS OF THE LIVER\r\n\r\nIn _tropical liver_ there is more a sensation of weight than one\r\nof pain. In _liver abscess_, however, there are painful dragging\r\nsensations and, at times, with abscess of the upper right lobe, pain\r\nreferred to the right shoulder. There is a marked tendency to splint\r\nthe liver as shown by the costal breathing and moderate rigidity of\r\nthe right rectus. The patient tends to lie on his back as shifting\r\nto either side, especially the left, causes pain. The legs are drawn\r\nup to relieve tension. Any jolting of the liver in palpation is\r\nexquisitely painful.\r\n\r\n  When active suppuration is going on in the liver the pain may be\r\n  of an acute throbbing character. With abscess of the left lobe the\r\n  pains may suggest gastric disease while with an abscess of the\r\n  concave surface of the liver there may be referred pain in the\r\n  appendix region.\r\n\r\nIn _blackwater fever_ and _bilious remittent fever_ there may be\r\ntenderness of the liver as well as the more prominent pain in the\r\nspleen.\r\n\r\n_Epidemic jaundice_ shows tenderness of the liver.\r\n\r\n  In _plague_ there is a marked congestion of the liver as of other\r\n  viscera and there may be some tenderness.\r\n\r\n  The liver becomes tender as well as showing enlargement in\r\n  infections with _Clonorchis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLENIC ENLARGEMENTS AND PAINS\r\n\r\nSplenic puncture has been carried out for diagnosis chiefly in\r\nkala-azar, malaria and Malta fever. Some authorities have reported\r\nfatalities from spleen puncture in kala-azar approximating 1% so that\r\nmany advise the safer liver puncture to that of the spleen.\r\n\r\n  Spleen puncture would only exceptionally be called for in malaria\r\n  as there is usually no difficulty in making the diagnosis from a\r\n  blood smear. Malta fever can usually best be diagnosed by blood\r\n  culture taken at the height of fever and recent work by Wenyon and\r\n  others would indicate that blood cultures on N. N. N. medium might\r\n  take the place of spleen puncture in kala-azar.\r\n\r\n_Kala-azar._—The splenic enlargement is the most conspicuous change\r\nin the disease, the spleen often reaching the umbilicus by the third\r\nmonth and later possibly filling up the entire left side of the\r\nabdomen. The coincident emaciation of the patient makes the splenic\r\ntumor more apparent. When first enlarging the spleen may be the\r\nsource of considerable pain and tenderness.\r\n\r\n  Fluctuations in the size of the spleen have been noted in the\r\n  course of the disease, diminution in size often attending severe\r\n  diarrhoeal attacks. In spleen or liver puncture the needle must be\r\n  dry so that the parasites shall not suffer distortion.\r\n\r\n_Malaria._—Splenic enlargement and tenderness are important points\r\nin diagnosis of malaria.\r\n\r\nIn acute malignant tertian infections the spleen is often diffluent\r\nso that it is liable to rupture upon slight injury. One should\r\neven exercise care not to palpate the spleen too violently and the\r\npossibility of accident should be thought of in making a spleen\r\npuncture.\r\n\r\n  The typical malaria spleen is the _ague cake_ of malarial cachexia.\r\n  Here we have a greatly enlarged spleen with a thickened capsule and\r\n  firm consistence. This spleen may fill up one side of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n_Malta Fever._—The splenic enlargement in this disease usually\r\ncorresponds about to that of typhoid fever. At times, however, the\r\nsize may be so great as even to suggest kala-azar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fever._—Splenic enlargement and tenderness are marked\r\nfeatures in this disease, often being noted early in the course.\r\n\r\n  _Blackwater Fever._—The spleen is painful and enlarged. The\r\n  splenic enlargement in this disease and relapsing fever is\r\n  important in differential diagnosis from yellow fever, a disease in\r\n  which the spleen is unaffected.\r\n\r\nThe spleen may be enlarged in _Japanese schistosomiasis_ as well as\r\nin rectal schistosomiasis.\r\n\r\n  Darling has recently noted that it may be difficult to\r\n  differentiate the anaemia of malarial cachexia from that due to\r\n  hookworm disease. As a matter of fact most authorities note a\r\n  diminution in the size of the spleen in _ancylostomiasis_ rather\r\n  than an increase and splenic enlargement would certainly favor a\r\n  diagnosis of malarial anaemia.\r\n\r\nOne point of distinction between spotted fever of the Rocky Mountains\r\nand typhus fever is that the spleen of the former disease is enlarged\r\nthree or four times the normal, while that of _typhus fever_ shows no\r\nincrease in size. The palpable spleen of _Rocky Mountain fever_ is\r\nfirm instead of soft as with typhus fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CUTANEOUS SYSTEM AND THE ORGANS OF THE SPECIAL SENSES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKIN\r\n\r\n_Ringworm infections_ of the skin are so common in the tropics\r\nthat one should always make an examination for the causative fungi\r\nwhen doubt as to the nature of the lesion exists. Another point is\r\nthat many hyperaemias, incident to other diseases, seem to furnish\r\na favorable soil for fungi; thus, not infrequently I have found\r\nabundant spores and mycelial structures in scrapings from the\r\nerythema of the early syphilitic secondaries. Again pruritic lesions\r\nmay become infected with fungi as the result of scratching, which\r\nscratching may not only have this result but furthermore may obscure\r\nthe dermatological characteristics of the primary disease.\r\n\r\n  The most expeditious way to examine for fungi is to treat the\r\n  scales or hairs with a 10% solution of caustic potash or soda.\r\n  Then crush between two slides; heat moderately over the flame and\r\n  examine after from 10 to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n  A very satisfactory method is to scrape the scales with a small\r\n  scalpel, and smear out the material so obtained in a loopful\r\n  of white of egg or blood serum on a glass slide. By scraping\r\n  vigorously the serum may be obtained from the patient. After the\r\n  smear has dried, treat it with alcohol and ether to get rid of\r\n  the fat. It may then be stained with Wright’s stain or by Gram’s\r\n  method. The ordinary Gram method may be used or the decolorizing\r\n  may be done with aniline oil, observing the decolorization under\r\n  the low power of the microscope.\r\n\r\n  _Hanging-block cultures._—To make these, pour melted agar in a\r\n  Petri dish and cut from the film so formed sections 1 cm. square.\r\n  Place a section on a slide, inoculate and drop on a cover-slip.\r\n  Another method is to allow a drop of melted agar, previously\r\n  inoculated, to spread over a cover-slip which is then inverted on a\r\n  concave slide.\r\n\r\n_Prickly heat_ is another condition extremely common in the tropics\r\nand the scratching to relieve the itching often leads to infection\r\nwith fungi or pyogenic cocci.\r\n\r\n_Pellagra._—In no other general disease is the skin eruption of such\r\nimportance in diagnosis and it is practically impossible to make\r\na sure diagnosis of pellagra in the absence of an eruption or the\r\nhistory of an eruption.\r\n\r\n  The eruption tends to show itself in the spring but may first\r\n  appear in the early fall. The lesions resemble a sunburn and burn\r\n  instead of itch. The characteristics of the eruption are bilateral\r\n  symmetry and sharp delimitation from the sound skin.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the lesions are dry and atrophic but more rarely, and\r\nusually in severe cases, the eruption may be moist and oedematous.\r\n\r\n  The backs of the hands are the most common sites for the eruption\r\n  but frequently there is an extension up the forearm. The neck,\r\n  the bridge and alae of the nose, the region back of the ears and\r\n  the front of the chest are often involved. In children the feet\r\n  and legs are frequently involved. Scrotal eruptions are early\r\n  manifestations.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—In _nodular leprosy_ we have the appearance of macules\r\nof greatly varying size and shape with a tendency sooner or later to\r\nsymmetry. They tend to appear and recur in association with febrile\r\naccessions and, even when they have become permanent spots, they show\r\nincreased redness, infiltration and tension when there is fever.\r\n\r\n  The color is rather that of a sunburn and may be uniform or the\r\n  center may be pale with copper-colored periphery. These spots\r\n  appear by preference on face, backs of hands, buttocks, extensor\r\n  surfaces of extremities and back. They may mark the location of\r\n  later developing nodules. At first they are oily rather than scaly.\r\n  We soon note a disappearance of hair within the spot. These spots\r\n  soon tend to become anaesthetic. The tubercles of leprosy are\r\n  usually of a reddish-brown color.\r\n\r\nIn _nerve leprosy_ the spots tend to appear on parts of the body\r\nusually covered by clothing, as scapular region, shoulders, arms,\r\nthighs or buttocks. The outline is ovoid rather than round and the\r\nspots may at first be hyperaesthetic rather than anaesthetic, as they\r\nlater tend to become.\r\n\r\n  In circinate eruptions we often note a pale center with\r\n  brownish-red borders. These borders may be hyperaesthetic while the\r\n  centers show anesthesia. Bilateral symmetry is more common in this\r\n  than in nodular leprosy.\r\n\r\n  Besides the spots nerve leprosy may show blister-like lesions on\r\n  backs of hands and feet especially in the region of the knuckles.\r\n  Ulceration may follow.\r\n\r\n_Malaria._—The most common cutaneous manifestation of malaria\r\nis herpes labialis. This is more common in benign types than in\r\nmalignant ones. Urticaria is next in frequency. Malaria has seemed to\r\nbe the cause of certain cases of purpura simplex.\r\n\r\n  In attributing skin manifestations to malaria one must always have\r\n  in mind the scarlatiniform, urticarial and erythematous rashes due\r\n  to quinine used in treatment.\r\n\r\n_Urticarial Fever._—In Japanese schistosomiasis the earliest\r\nsymptoms are the urticarial rash and fever.\r\n\r\n_Plague._—Rarely cases of bubonic plague may show a small vesicle\r\nmarking the site of the flea bite. Areas of necrosis of the skin,\r\nwhich are really sloughing patches, and incorrectly designated\r\n“carbuncles,” may be noted, especially over the site of the buboes.\r\n\r\n  In the later stages haemorrhages into the skin (petechiae) are\r\n  common.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosomiasis._—Patchy areas of erythema are often noted in\r\nEuropeans affected with this disease. These are frequently circinate\r\nwith fading in the center and tend to appear on the trunk.\r\n\r\n  In natives a dry skin is more often noted.\r\n\r\n_Rat Bite Disease._—An eruption of purplish spots may accompany the\r\nfever. There is a resemblance to erythema multiforme.\r\n\r\n_Dengue._—The true eruption of dengue is the one that appears about\r\nthe fourth or fifth day as a measles-like eruption, starting about\r\nwrists or ankles.\r\n\r\n_Kala-azar._—There is a darkening of the colored skin of the natives\r\nsuffering from this disease and it is to this feature that the\r\ndisease owes its name.\r\n\r\n  In Europeans the appearance is more that one sees in old malarial\r\n  cachectics, an earthy gray color. The characteristics of cutaneous\r\n  leishmaniasis are discussed under that heading.\r\n\r\n_Typhus Fever._—Gangrene is particularly a feature of _spotted fever\r\nof the Rocky Mountains_ and _typhus fever_, chiefly of the scrotum\r\nand prepuce with the former and of the extremities in the latter.\r\n\r\n  The distinctions of the eruptions of these two diseases and of\r\n  _tsutsugamushi_ are given on page 445.\r\n\r\n_Tsutsugamushi._—A small necrotic ulcer with a dusky red areola,\r\noften located in the armpits or region of the genitals, marks the\r\nsite of the bite of the infecting mite. From it a lymphangitis leads\r\nto the swollen glands. About the seventh day a macular eruption,\r\nwhich never becomes petechial, appears on face, then on trunk and\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\n_Tularaemia._—There is often a local lesion at the site of the bite\r\nof the infecting _Chrysops_. The tributary glands are swollen.\r\n\r\nIn _ancylostomiasis_ the site of entrance of the infecting stage of\r\nthe larvae is marked by a dermatitis—ground itch.\r\n\r\n  Tibial ulcers are also features of this disease.\r\n\r\nIn _filariasis_ we not only have the bleb-like lesion of guinea\r\nworm infection but also the calabar swellings of _Filaria\r\nloa_. Elephantiasis and lymph scrotum are the best known skin\r\nmanifestations of _F. bancrofti_, but there may also be present\r\nfilarial abscesses. The tumors of _O. volvulus_ are most often on\r\nsides of chest, are quite superficial with the skin freely movable\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n  _Epidemic Dropsy._—It is a question, whether such a disease as\r\n  epidemic dropsy is distinct from beriberi. An erythematous eruption\r\n  about the face and a macular one of the trunk and extremities are\r\n  usually stated to be features of this disease.\r\n\r\n_Juxta-articular Nodes._—This is a condition in which small tumors\r\nform under the skin especially in the region of the elbows. These\r\nbean to walnut-sized tumors of the subcutaneous tissues may also be\r\nnoted about the knees. A fungus has been reported as cause but the\r\npresent view is that the cause is unknown.\r\n\r\n_Oriental Sore._—This form of cutaneous leishmaniasis is especially\r\ncommon in Asiatic Turkey and Northern Africa. It begins as a small\r\npapule which eventually ulcerates, the sore scabbing over from time\r\nto time and again breaking down. Indolent granulations and a very\r\nprotracted course are rather characteristic features.\r\n\r\n_American Leishmaniasis._—The most important point of\r\ndifferentiation of this form of leishmaniasis from oriental sore\r\nis the occurrence of ulcerating lesions of the mucous membranes of\r\nmouth or nose subsequent to the appearance of the oriental sore-like\r\nlesions on forearm, legs, trunk, or rarely the face. In Peru the term\r\n_uta_ more properly belongs to the skin affections while _espundia_\r\nis the designation applied to the lesions of the mucous membranes.\r\nIt may be stated that a form of oriental sore has been reported from\r\nGreece where mucous membrane ulcerations have been associated with\r\nthe ordinary skin-type lesion.\r\n\r\n_Dermal Leishmanoid._—Brahmachari has described a form of\r\ngeneralized cutaneous leishmaniasis, bearing a superficial\r\nresemblance to leprosy, which may develop a variable number of\r\nmonths after apparent cure of kala-azar by antimony. Having found\r\nleishmania bodies in the lesions, he conjectured that some of the\r\nparasites survive the action of the drug, but with their virulence\r\nso attenuated that they can give rise only to a milder disease,\r\na variant of cutaneous leishmaniasis, to which he gives the name\r\n“dermal leishmanoid.”\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—The special tropical diseases of the skin are discussed\r\n  under their respective headings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYE\r\n\r\n_Glaucoma._—According to Elliott glaucoma is very much more\r\ncommon in the East than in Europe. He states that simple chronic\r\nglaucoma is extraordinarily common in India. Often the only\r\nsymptoms are retraction of the field, cupping of the disc and at\r\na later stage impairment of the central visual acuity. He notes\r\nthat the advancement of the disease is often as unobtrusive as it\r\nis relentless. These patients often only present themselves at the\r\nclinic in the late stages of the disease; thus at the Madras hospital\r\nthe vision was only that of hand perception, or less, in 40% of cases.\r\n\r\n_Cataract._—The general impression is that cataract is more frequent\r\nin the tropical regions than in Europe and as bearing out this view\r\nElliott notes that cataract among those Europeans who have served\r\nin India seems more frequent than among those who have remained in\r\nEngland. Cataract is also more common in the southern part of China\r\nthan in the northern portion.\r\n\r\n_Lachrymal Obstruction._—Elliott notes the extreme frequency of this\r\ncondition in India, and states that in the Madras Ophthalmic Hospital\r\n125 operations for excision of one or both lachrymal sacs were\r\nperformed in 1907.\r\n\r\n_Trachoma._—There are certain tropical countries where trachoma is a\r\ndisease of the greatest importance. Thus in China its prevalence is\r\ngreat, as is also true of India, Egypt and Japan.\r\n\r\n  Outside of imported cases it is very prevalent in many parts of the\r\n  United States.\r\n\r\nIn this disease there is hypertrophy of the conjunctiva, granule\r\nformation and subsequent cicatricial changes. Pannus and corneal\r\nulcerations are frequent complications.\r\n\r\n  The disease is contagious through transfer of the secretion by\r\n  hands or flies. It is usually considered as caused by the so-called\r\n  trachoma bodies or cell inclusions, which are best brought out by\r\n  Giemsa staining. The trachoma granules are yellowish, translucent\r\n  bodies set in the reddened conjunctiva.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—The eye is more frequently involved in nodular than in\r\nnerve leprosy. In the former we have infiltration of the conjunctiva\r\nwhich may extend to the cornea.\r\n\r\n  The leprous nodules invading the palpebral conjunctiva tend to\r\n  ulcerate and bring about various distortions of the eyelids,\r\n  producing ectropion. Iritis, irido-cyclitis and irido-choroiditis\r\n  are less frequent than conjunctivitis and keratitis. The optic\r\n  nerve and the retina are only rarely involved.\r\n\r\nIn nerve leprosy the eye changes are chiefly connected with the\r\nlesions of the fifth and facial nerves. Ptosis and paralytic\r\nectropion occur with frequency.\r\n\r\n  Ophthalmia and corneal ulcerations may lead to total destruction of\r\n  the eye. The cornea may be anaesthetic. Paralysis of one or more\r\n  ocular muscles may cause squint or diplopia.\r\n\r\n_Malaria._—It is questionable whether the forms of conjunctivitis\r\nand keratitis at times reported as due to malarial infection are not\r\nrather of other origin.\r\n\r\n  Iritis is rarely a complication of malaria.\r\n\r\nRetinal haemorrhages may occur in malarial cachexia and cerebral\r\ntypes of pernicious malaria.\r\n\r\n  Another rare malarial complication is amblyopia. In this there is\r\n  an optic neuritis with grayish-red disc and the loss of vision is\r\n  not complete, while in quinine amblyopia the disc is white and the\r\n  vision completely lost for a time.\r\n\r\n_Filariasis._—In that filarial infection caused by _Loa loa_,\r\nat one time designated _Filaria oculi_, there seems a special\r\ntendency for the adult worms to wander to the subcutaneous tissues\r\nin the neighborhood of the eyes or under the palpebral or ocular\r\nconjunctivae. When moving under the conjunctiva the worms cause\r\nmarked irritation and at times pain.\r\n\r\n  There may be considerable swelling so that the patient cannot for a\r\n  time see out of the invaded eye. It has been stated that the worms\r\n  may enter the anterior chamber of the eye but this is questionable.\r\n\r\n  It is believed that lesions of the cornea and iris may result from\r\n  the migrations through the body of the _Onchocerca volvulus_.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosomiasis._—Eye lesions are quite frequent in this disease\r\nthese being keratitis, irido-cyclitis or conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\n  Oedema about the eyes is of importance in diagnosis. Eye lesions\r\n  seem more common in Rhodesian trypanosomiasis. The atoxyl treatment\r\n  of the disease may cause optic neuritis and blindness.\r\n\r\n_Tick Fever._—In the relapsing fever of South Africa iritis has been\r\nnoted as occasionally occurring.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Fever._—In the period of onset a feature of the so-called\r\n“facies” of the disease is marked injection of the conjunctivae with\r\nsensitiveness to the light.\r\n\r\n  Rush likened it to the eye of a wild animal as contrasted with\r\n  the less ferocious eye of bilious remittent fever which more\r\n  resembled that of a domesticated animal. About the third day the\r\n  earliest manifestation of jaundice presents itself in the ocular\r\n  conjunctivae.\r\n\r\n_Ancylostomiasis._—Retinal haemorrhages may occur with marked\r\nhookworm anaemia. Stiles notes a fixed stare in hookworm cases, the\r\neye itself somewhat resembling the eye of a fish.\r\n\r\n  Among other diseases showing ocular manifestations may be mentioned\r\n  one associated with fibrous nodules in the upper lid due to a\r\n  larval dibothriocephalid, _Sparganum mansoni_.\r\n\r\n_Bacillary Dysentery._—Quite a number of cases have recently been\r\nreported where along with an arthritic complication there has been\r\nconjunctivitis. In 6 cases of dysenteric conjunctivitis, Maxwell\r\nnoted that 4 cases had arthritis and 3 of the latter showed anterior\r\nuveitis. The conjunctivitis lasted about a week. Relapses seem liable\r\nto occur. In none of the cases has there been recovered from the\r\nconjunctival secretion the organism of dysentery.\r\n\r\n_Cholera._—As a result of the loss of all body fluids the lachrymal\r\nsecretion is scanty or absent and we have various conjunctival and\r\ncorneal troubles unless the eye is frequently irrigated with normal\r\nsaline. Vitreous opacities and cataract may follow cholera.\r\n\r\n_Beriberi._—In this disease there have been reported the following\r\neye complications: (1) retrobulbar neuritis; (2) paralyses of the\r\nmuscles of the eye and (3) decreased sensibility of the cornea and\r\nconjunctiva.\r\n\r\n_Night Blindness and Xerophthalmia._—Both of these conditions are\r\nquite common in certain parts of the tropics and the view that the\r\nheat of the tropics and the tropical sunlight were potent factors\r\nhad precedence until our study of vitamine requirements showed the\r\netiology to rest in deficiency of fat soluble A. It is now known that\r\ncod-liver oil is particularly rich in this vitamine and that in this\r\nagent we have our best preventive and curative agent for these eye\r\nconditions. It is well known that rats fed on a diet deficient in fat\r\nsoluble A develop xerophthalmia.\r\n\r\n  Night blindness (nyctalopia) is best known among the crews of\r\n  sailing ships, especially when becalmed in tropical waters, and\r\n  some influence of sunlight was considered the cause, but we now\r\n  know that it is among such personnel that ship beriberi and scurvy\r\n  are prone to occur by reason of deficiencies in water soluble B and\r\n  the antiscorbutic vitamines. In such a dietary fat soluble A would\r\n  also probably be lacking.\r\n\r\n  In those parts of the tropics where famine conditions are common\r\n  both night blindness and xerophthalmia are frequent in young\r\n  children, not necessarily associated but frequently combined.\r\n\r\n  In a mild case of xerophthalmia there is a dry area of triangular\r\n  shape extending from either side of the cornea and covered with a\r\n  fine, whitish foam. In bad cases the whole eye may be dry, wrinkled\r\n  and opaque and eventually the cornea may slough away and bring\r\n  about destruction of the eye. There is very little pain attending\r\n  this frightful condition.\r\n\r\n  Elliot notes that from earliest times it was the custom in China\r\n  to treat these conditions with extracts of liver. We now know\r\n  that liver and kidneys are glandular organs rich in fat soluble A\r\n  although not so rich in this vitamine as cod-liver oil.\r\n\r\n_Typhus fever._—There may be a rapid development of cataract of\r\nthe soft variety, particularly in young patients. Ocular palsies,\r\nespecially of the third and sixth nerves may occur during the febrile\r\nperiod. Corneal ulcers are not uncommon during convalescence and may\r\nbe severe and very painful, often accompanied by conjunctivitis and\r\niritis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EAR\r\n\r\n_Aural Myiasis._—While the larva of _Chrysomyia macellaria_, known\r\nas the “screw worm,” is the one most frequently reported from the\r\nexternal auditory canal, yet many such cases have been connected\r\nwith the larvae of _Sarcophaga carnaria_, _Calliphora vomitoria_ and\r\n_Anthomyia pluvialis_. These larvae are usually deposited in the\r\nauditory canals of those with otorrhoea.\r\n\r\n  The symptoms are intense earache, giddiness and possibly\r\n  convulsions. The larvae tend to perforate the tympanic membrane.\r\n  Instillations of 10% chloroform in milk or the use of oils kill the\r\n  larvae.\r\n\r\nIn the stuporous states of _plague_ and _typhus fever_ there often\r\nappears to be a state of deafness.\r\n\r\n  One must always keep in mind the ringing of the ears indicative\r\n  of the physiological action of quinine. Permanent deafness may be\r\n  produced by the long continued use of quinine.\r\n\r\nIn leprosy the lobes of the ears are special sites of preference for\r\nthe nodules and I always palpate the lobes where the nodules are not\r\ndistinctly visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NOSE\r\n\r\n_Nasal Myiasis._—In cases of ozaena certain flies appear to be\r\nattracted and to deposit their eggs at the nasal orifices. The larvae\r\ndeveloping from the eggs of _Chrysomyia macellaria_, a fly common\r\nin tropical America, are known as “screw-worms” and cause frightful\r\ndestruction of the nasal structures.\r\n\r\n  They may bore into the adjacent sinuses. Marked frontal headache\r\n  and a purulent or bloody discharge are symptoms. Great swelling of\r\n  the nasal structures precedes the destruction of the cartilaginous\r\n  and bony tissues.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—The nasal mucosa is apt to be the seat of leprous\r\nnodules. Those located on the septum may ulcerate and material from\r\nthese ulcers show abundant leprosy bacilli. Alternations of dryness\r\nand hypersecretion of the Schneiderian membrane are among the early\r\nmanifestations of the disease.\r\n\r\n=Epistaxis.=—This is a feature of the early stages of _leprosy_\r\noften associated with rhinitis, in particular the alternation of\r\ncoryza-like conditions with others characterized by dryness of the\r\nnasal mucosa.\r\n\r\n  There is also a peculiar nasal tone to the voice of lepers.\r\n\r\nIn _yellow fever_ and _plague_ epistaxis is often the first sign of\r\nthe degeneration of the endothelial linings of the capillaries.\r\n\r\n  _Gangosa._—A disease of certain islands of the Pacific, especially\r\n  Guam, characterized by naso-pharyngeal lesions and a nasal voice,\r\n  is known as _gangosa_.\r\n\r\nIn _goundou_ we have exostoses from the nasal processes of the\r\nsuperior maxillary bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nTHE URINE AND THE GENITO-URINARY APPARATUS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF\r\nTROPICAL DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE URINE\r\n\r\nOf the chemical tests employed in the examination of urine that for\r\nthe presence of sugar is rarely of value, as there is no tropical\r\ndisease in which the presence or absence of sugar is of diagnostic\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe determination not only of the presence of albumin in the urine\r\nbut, as well, of the variations quantitatively from day to day\r\nis, however, most necessary in many of the tropical diseases and\r\nparticularly in yellow fever and blackwater fever.\r\n\r\n  =Tests for Albumin.=—The simplest and most reliable test for\r\n  albumin is the heat test with the subsequent addition of a\r\n  sufficient number of drops of 5% acetic acid to make the boiled\r\n  urine acid and incidentally to dissolve any phosphates which may\r\n  have separated out on boiling.\r\n\r\n  Ulrich’s test is a very simple one and only calls for reagents\r\n  which are usually at hand. Heat a saturated solution of common\r\n  salt, containing 2% of glacial acetic acid, and superimpose the\r\n  urine to be tested upon the hot reagent. A ring shows the presence\r\n  of albumin.\r\n\r\n  For Heller’s test, pour a small amount of nitric acid into a narrow\r\n  test tube and, while holding the tube at an angle of about 45°,\r\n  superimpose a layer of the urine to be tested, which is delivered\r\n  drop by drop from a pipette and allowed to flow down the side of\r\n  the tube.\r\n\r\n  This test can be converted into a quantitative one which is\r\n  sufficiently accurate for clinical purposes. It is based on the\r\n  fact that a specimen of urine containing 0.003% of albumin will\r\n  give a perceptible ring at the layering of the urine and acid in\r\n  two minutes. If the ring appears at once or in a few seconds the\r\n  albumin content is greater. From the qualitative test an idea can\r\n  be formed as to the amount of albumin which the urine contains,\r\n  a heavy ring forming immediately showing a considerable albumin\r\n  content. Probably the highest elimination of albumin is found in\r\n  chronic parenchymatous nephritis where it may run from 1 to 3%.\r\n  In an ordinary case of acute nephritis O.5% would be an average\r\n  content.\r\n\r\n  Recently I have been using for both qualitative and quantitative\r\n  albumin tests the following apparatus. This is simply a 5-inch\r\n  piece of ¼-inch soft glass tubing heated at a point 2 inches from\r\n  one end, drawn out for about 2 inches and bent to form a U-tube\r\n  with one end shorter than the other. This form of tube enables\r\n  one to perform two tests with the same column of nitric acid and\r\n  is easily cleaned and dried. They may be kept suspended around a\r\n  glass tumbler’s rim. Taking up a small amount of nitric acid with\r\n  a capillary bulb pipette it is deposited in the capillary curve\r\n  of the bent tube. This acid pipette should be kept attached to\r\n  the acid bottle. With a second pipette the urine is deposited in\r\n  the short arm of the U-tube and the presence of albumin shows by\r\n  a distinct ring at the junction of urine and acid in the clear\r\n  capillary tubing. The long arm will serve for the introduction of a\r\n  second specimen of urine for the albumin test.\r\n\r\n  For quantitative test we dilute the filtered urine with one or\r\n  more parts of normal salt solution according to the intensity of\r\n  the albumin ring. A very convenient way of making the dilution is\r\n  with a graduated centrifuge tube. Make a one to ten dilution of the\r\n  urine, mix and draw up with a bulb pipette and deposit in the short\r\n  arm of the U-tube. A distinct ring forms in two or three seconds.\r\n  Pour off one-half of the diluted urine and make up with an equal\r\n  amount of saline. Deposit this one to twenty dilution in the long\r\n  arm. The ring forms in about a minute. With further testing it is\r\n  found that a one to forty dilution shows a perceptible ring in\r\n  just two minutes. This final and successful dilution multiplied by\r\n  0.0033 gives the percentage of albumin in the urine (40 × 0.0033 =\r\n  0.13%).\r\n\r\n  Should it be desired to determine the nature of the proteids\r\n  present either in urine or in exudates or transudates the following\r\n  method is applicable. Determine the percentage of total proteid by\r\n  the method employed above. Then throw down the globulins by the\r\n  addition of an equal amount of a saturated solution of ammonium\r\n  sulphate, filter and estimate the proteid content of the filtrate.\r\n  The difference between that and the total gives the percentage of\r\n  globulin. The filtrate is now treated with 5% acetic acid until a\r\n  precipitate of nucleo-proteid ceases to form; the fluid is filtered\r\n  and the clear filtrate (which should not show any turbidity with a\r\n  drop of 5% acetic acid) is tested for its proteid content, which\r\n  represents the serum albumin. When the combined percentage of\r\n  globulins and serum albumin is subtracted from the total proteid\r\n  percentage we have the percentage of nucleo-proteid.\r\n\r\n=Tests for Blood.=—Very important in tests of the urine are those\r\nfor blood. With an unaided eye a smoky colored urine, more or less\r\nreddish-brown in color, is suggestive in cases of haematuria, while\r\nin haemoglobinuria we usually have a more or less porter-colored,\r\nturbid fluid which, however, shows a clear haemoglobin-tinged fluid\r\nwhen centrifuged to throw down the haemoglobin casts and granular\r\ndébris of the disintegrated red cells. Upon shaking such urine we get\r\na pinkish foam instead of the yellowish one of icteric urine.\r\n\r\n  A strip of white filter-paper when partially dipped into urine\r\n  shows pinkish-colored waves which are more deeply colored at the\r\n  summit of the waves while the paper which absorbs bile-containing\r\n  urine shows the yellowish color and waves less yellow at the\r\n  summits of the colored waves.\r\n\r\nFor haematuria we may use either the microscopic method for the\r\nrecognition of red cells or chemical ones. The red cell is best\r\nrecognized by the double contour of the 7.5 micron disk. Spores of\r\nmoulds, which greatly resemble red cells, are smaller, usually not\r\nmore than 5 microns.\r\n\r\n  The following technic is of the greatest value not only because\r\n  it makes the red cells more distinct but because by staining the\r\n  various epithelial elements it gives us more exact information as\r\n  to distinction between the segmented nucleus of pus cells and the\r\n  single one of renal cells. Make a streak of vaseline across a slide\r\n  one inch from one end. Then deposit a drop of urinary sediment,\r\n  taken up from the centrifuge tube with a pipette, about ¼ inch from\r\n  the grease line. Then drop a large drop of Gram’s iodine solution\r\n  on this sediment and then apply one side of a square cover-glass\r\n  to the vaseline line and allow it to fall gently on the drop of\r\n  sediment and stain. There is no current motion, and casts and other\r\n  urinary elements remain under the cover-glass instead of floating\r\n  out beyond the margins. It is well to examine the unstained\r\n  sediment with a ⅔ inch objective before adding the iodine and\r\n  applying the cover-glass, as one gets a better idea of casts with a\r\n  low power and unstained than in any other way.\r\n\r\nWith haemoglobinuria we necessarily turn to chemical or spectroscopic\r\ntests which are also applicable to microscopically doubtful cases of\r\nhaematuria.\r\n\r\n  For the detection of occult blood, the technique described on page\r\n  524 should be observed, and alkaline urines faintly acidified with\r\n  acetic acid before examination.\r\n\r\n=Indicanuria.=—In _sprue_ and _pellagra_ we have a rather marked\r\nincrease in indican. It is probable that many cases of vague\r\nmanifestations of neurasthenia with loss of physical and mental\r\nenergy are connected with auto-intoxication rather than tropical heat\r\nor intestinal parasites.\r\n\r\n=Urobilinuria.=—In conditions where there is a great destruction\r\nof red cells tests for urobilin are important. Plehn considers the\r\npresence of urobilin as of importance in the diagnosis of _latent\r\nmalaria_, which is true, provided other causes for red blood cell\r\ndestruction are excluded. _Blackwater fever_ cases usually show\r\nan intense urobilinuria. Urobilinuria is also a sign of deficient\r\nfunctioning of the liver.\r\n\r\n=Bile Pigment Tests.=—In conditions associated with the presence\r\nof bile pigments in the urine we may conveniently employ the Gmelin\r\ntest in the following manner. Filter the urine several times through\r\nthe filter and then touch the moist inner surface of the paper with\r\na glass rod dipped in commercial nitric acid. A ring-like play of\r\ncolors, green, blue, violet and red circle out from the spot touched.\r\nA green color must be noted for positive diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  Tests for bile acids seem to have but slight value in differential\r\n  diagnosis.\r\n\r\nA very simple and apparently quite reliable test for deficiencies in\r\nliver functioning is that known as Ehrlich’s aldehyde reaction. The\r\nreagent is a 2% solution of p. dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in equal\r\nparts of water and concentrated hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n  For the test treat 5 cc. urine with 5 to 10 drops of the reagent.\r\n  Agitate a few minutes and a positive reaction is shown by a fine\r\n  cherry-red color, thought to be due to urobilinogen.\r\n\r\n  The urine sample should be perfectly fresh and not long exposed to\r\n  light.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF URINE IN 24 HOURS\r\n\r\nNormally a man passes about 1200 cc. of urine in twenty-four hours,\r\na woman somewhat less. When the amount is under 750 cc. we have an\r\noliguria. To consider a polyuria as present the patient should pass\r\nmore than 3000 cc., as this amount may be considered the upper normal\r\nlimit. In anuria we have a cessation of renal activity.\r\n\r\nThe disease in which anuria is most characteristic is _cholera_.\r\nDuring the stage of evacuation the urinary secretion becomes less and\r\nless along with the progressive failure of circulation and, during\r\nthe algid stage, we have a suppression of urine.\r\n\r\n  The anuria seems to run parallel with an acidosis and intravenous\r\n  injections of bicarbonate of soda solutions tend to prevent anuria.\r\n  In the stage of reaction the favorable outcome is the reappearance\r\n  of urine, which increases in amount to become a polyuria. In\r\n  unfavorable cases the anuria continues.\r\n\r\nIn _blackwater fever_ anuria may result from the blocking up of the\r\nrenal tubules by haemoglobin casts.\r\n\r\nBlackwater fever also shows an acidosis and alkaline treatment is\r\nhere indicated. Blackwater urine is irritating so that there is\r\nvesical tenesmus with frequent urination.\r\n\r\n  The degree of renal involvement is of great prognostic value in\r\n  _yellow fever_, and those cases where the oliguria goes on to\r\n  suppression are apt to terminate fatally.\r\n\r\nIn _heat stroke_ there is an oliguria or anuria which may be\r\nfollowed, during convalescence, by a polyuria. Marked irritation\r\nof the bladder, associated with suppression of sweating, may be\r\nindicative of oncoming heat stroke.\r\n\r\n  In _dropsical beriberi_ there is an oliguria or, rarely, an anuria\r\n  which with the rapid disappearance of the general body oedema may\r\n  become an excessive polyuria.\r\n\r\nRarely one may observe a critical flow of urine in _dengue_ at the\r\ntime of the fall of the primary febrile accession.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBUMINURIA\r\n\r\nThe disease in which this is of peculiar diagnostic and prognostic\r\nvalue is _yellow fever_. We expect albumin about the second day with\r\na steady increase in amount during succeeding days of the fever.\r\nThe degree of oliguria or rather anuria is of greater prognostic\r\nvalue than the degree of albuminuria. The albuminuria is of great\r\ndiagnostic value in differentiating yellow fever from dengue.\r\n\r\n  _Blackwater fever_ shows a great abundance of albumin with the\r\n  appearance of the haemoglobinuria and diminishes as the color of\r\n  the urine clears up.\r\n\r\n  In _malaria_ albumin was present in 38% of benign tertian\r\n  infections and 58% of malignant ones at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\r\n\r\n  The absence of albumin in _beriberic urine_ is important in\r\n  differential diagnosis from acute nephritis.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAEMOGLOBINURIA\r\n\r\nParoxysmal haemoglobinuria or haemoglobinuria resulting from\r\npotassium chlorate poisoning, severe burns, intravenous injections\r\nof foreign sera, or—most commonly—syphilis, may be noted in the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of cases of true tropical haemoglobinuria, however,\r\nare due either to blackwater fever or to the administration of the\r\nacid salts of quinine to one predisposed to quinine haemoglobinuria.\r\nWhile it must be admitted that haemoglobinuria may result from\r\nquinine it is certainly so rare in subtropical countries, where great\r\namounts of quinine are administered in treatment of malaria, as to\r\nbe unimportant. It is only where the malignant tertian parasite\r\nflourishes that we have the question of the importance of quinine in\r\nproducing haemoglobinuria brought up.\r\n\r\n  Certain persons have isohaemolysins in their blood which dissolve\r\n  the red cells of other persons and in paroxysmal haemoglobinuria\r\n  autohaemolysins may be present which can destroy the patient’s\r\n  own red cells. This auto-haemolysis seems operative only when a\r\n  low temperature is followed by a high one. When haemoglobinaemia\r\n  exists the liver converts it into bile pigment causing bilious\r\n  stools and jaundice. If one-sixth of the red cells are destroyed\r\n  haemoglobinuria results.\r\n\r\n  The dark, porter-colored urine of blackwater is diagnostic even to\r\n  the patient. The urinary sediment consists of granular débris with\r\n  occasional haematoidin crystals. Albuminuria runs parallel with the\r\n  haemoglobinuria. Pain in the loins, probably, from the plugging\r\n  of the renal tubules by the detritus of red cell destruction, is\r\n  a feature of blackwater fever. In blackwater fever we have the\r\n  early appearance, even in a few hours, in a patient who is markedly\r\n  asthenic and miserable, of jaundice, porter-colored urine and\r\n  albuminuria.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAEMATURIA\r\n\r\nAmong tropical diseases that which immediately suggests haematuria\r\nis vesical bilharziasis. The blood in the urine is in the form\r\nof red cells; it is a haematuria and not a haemoglobinuria. The\r\npassage of blood usually occurs at the end of micturition and it is\r\neither in the last few drops of urine or in the sediment obtained\r\nafter centrifuging that we note the terminal spined eggs of _S.\r\nhaematobium_ which prove the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  Red blood cells in the urine may also be noted in the\r\n  haematochyluria of filarial disease.\r\n\r\n  When we have blood in the urine in yellow fever it is a haematuria\r\n  and comes on about the same time as the black vomit and other\r\n  haemorrhages resulting from degeneration of the endothelial linings\r\n  of the blood capillaries, which only takes place about the third or\r\n  fourth day of the disease.\r\n\r\nHaematuria may also be noted in plague at the time when the\r\nhaemorrhages into the skin occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHYLURIA\r\n\r\nVesical varices from lymphatic obstruction, due to filarial disease,\r\nare the most frequent cause of the milky urine of chyluria. The\r\nurine usually has a pinkish tinge from blood admixture so that the\r\ncondition is really a haematochyluria. The thoracic duct may not be\r\nthe seat of obstruction which has taken place elsewhere when the\r\ncondition is lymphuria instead of chyluria. Lymph and chyle differ\r\nin fat content, the former having from very little to about 3% while\r\nthe latter has 5% or more of emulsified fat. Chyle has also more than\r\ntwice as much proteid as does lymph.\r\n\r\n  In chyluria the morning urine is often clear while that at\r\n  night is milky. On standing, chylous urine separates into an\r\n  upper cream-like layer with a pinkish sediment and, between, a\r\n  pinkish-white fluid in which floats a clot. Filarial embryos may or\r\n  may not be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDNEY FUNCTION AND ITS DETERMINATION\r\n\r\nThe ability of the kidney to excrete substances from the blood stream\r\nis frequently affected by disease, especially such as disturbs the\r\nkidney, and is usually diminished after the age of 50 years. Disease\r\nof the kidney, however, does not necessarily imply an inability to\r\neliminate substances—the functional need not parallel the anatomical\r\nlesion. Function may be normal especially when the changes are of\r\nfocal type.\r\n\r\nImpairment of renal function does not affect the excretion of\r\ndifferent compounds to the same extent. It is well established\r\nthat functions for chlorides and for urea are independent of each\r\nother. In any urinary examination, then, one should bear in mind\r\nthe possible effect of an impaired excretory power relative only to\r\nthe substance under consideration. In this connection, we speak of\r\nthe _kidney threshhold_ for a substance, i.e., the concentration\r\nrequired in the blood stream before the kidney will excrete it, at\r\nleast in abnormal amounts. For chlorides, this is quite definite at\r\n562 for blood plasma; for sugar, it is about 160-180 for whole blood.\r\nThe threshold is not necessarily absolute, but simply indicates\r\nthat with less sugar, for instance, only the normal traces will be\r\npassed. Chloride excretion begins only when their concentration\r\npasses the threshold value, and the rate of elimination depends upon\r\ntheir excess. Other compounds, such as urea, for example, may have\r\nno definite threshold value. Disease may affect the value, either\r\nby raising it and causing abnormal retention, or by lowering it and\r\ngiving rise to depletion.\r\n\r\n  We can establish the status of the renal function in any given\r\n  case, and are then in a position to intelligently prescribe\r\n  dietetic and other treatment. Chemical analysis of the blood\r\n  indicates the metabolic products affected and guides us in the\r\n  adjustment of the diet, etc., to the excretory powers of the\r\n  kidneys. One must, however, not overlook the nutritive needs of the\r\n  body.\r\n\r\n  Many methods are employed for the determination of kidney function,\r\n  and their relative values are still debatable. Probably those\r\n  least open to criticism are chemical analysis of the blood, the\r\n  phenolsulphonephthalein test, and Mosenthal’s method. Ambard,\r\n  McLean, Van Slyke, and others have devised formulae to this\r\n  end, based upon chloride, urea, or sugar excretion, which have\r\n  many warm advocates as well as severe critics. A rough clinical\r\n  comparison of the two kidneys may be obtained by determining the\r\n  urea in specimens of urine simultaneously collected by the ureteral\r\n  catheter.\r\n\r\n_Blood Chemistry_, now that its value has been established, is\r\ngenerally given preference and allowed greater weight in case of\r\ndisagreement with other tests. It measures excretory function for\r\nnormal metabolic products, and has the additional value of an aid\r\nin diagnosis and prognosis and a guide to treatment, especially\r\ndietetic. It has the disadvantage of a possibly unfamiliar technique,\r\nand does not afford a comparison of the two kidneys.\r\n\r\n  The substances usually considered are the nitrogenous compounds\r\n  (nonprotein nitrogen, urea nitrogen, uric acid, etc.), but\r\n  retention of others (sugar, chlorides, cholesterin, etc.) are\r\n  also of significance in this connection. Of the nitrogenous\r\n  constituents, the kidney excretes creatinine most readily, urea\r\n  next, and uric acid with the most difficulty. As a consequence, an\r\n  impairment of function results first in the retention of uric acid,\r\n  then urea, and, finally, creatinine is also retained. Owing to the\r\n  relatively small amounts of uric acid and creatinine present, the\r\n  nonprotein nitrogen, which includes the nitrogen in them as well\r\n  as in other compounds, is not appreciably affected except by the\r\n  urea increase. This is the basis of an intelligent interpretation\r\n  of the findings. The urea and nonprotein nitrogen are so markedly\r\n  affected by diet, especially among nephritics, that judgment must\r\n  be exercised when they are employed as indices of renal function.\r\n  This fact was not properly appreciated until recently, and probably\r\n  accounts for much of the discredit cast upon blood chemistry in\r\n  this connection. The uric acid, being less exogenous in origin,\r\n  is perhaps the most delicate and the safest index; the increase\r\n  appears early, and 3.5 may be considered the high normal value.\r\n  On the usual restricted hospital diet, over 20 for urea nitrogen\r\n  should be considered suggestive of impaired kidney function; over\r\n  75 speaks decisively for renal involvement and probably uraemia.\r\n\r\n  _Phenolsulphonephthalein (Phthalein, or Red) Test._—This was\r\n  developed by Rowntree and Geraghty, and its simplicity makes\r\n  it very useful, especially to the isolated practitioner with\r\n  limited laboratory facilities. It estimates only function for a\r\n  foreign substance, is not considered quite as reliable as chemical\r\n  analysis of the blood, and, of course, does not give the additional\r\n  information that the latter supplies. It is, however, of much\r\n  value, has no contraindications, and does compare the kidneys when\r\n  combined with ureteral catheterization or use of a separator.\r\n  Positive results are of more significance than negative, and it is\r\n  less affected by glomerular than tubular changes. Values of more\r\n  than 75% for 2 hours may be accompanied by diuresis, and Frank\r\n  considers such a finding suggestive of renal disturbance with\r\n  irritation if there is any corroborative evidence.\r\n\r\n  The technique comprises administration of the dye, determination of\r\n  the interval before it appears in the urine, and the amount then\r\n  excreted during definite periods. The dye is employed in solution,\r\n  and is conveniently purchased already sterilized in ampules, each\r\n  containing slightly more than 1 cc. of a solution of its monosodium\r\n  salt of the strength of 6 mg. per cc. The patient drinks 200-400\r\n  cc. water, and 6 mg. of the dye are injected intramuscularly\r\n  (lumbar muscles), or intravenously, 20 minutes later. The bladder\r\n  is immediately emptied, and the urine discarded. The succeeding\r\n  portions of urine may be collected by voiding, but it is more\r\n  accurate to catheterize the bladder or ureters, and catheterization\r\n  is practically a necessity for determination of the “appearance\r\n  time.”\r\n\r\n  The appearance time is the interval of time elapsing between\r\n  injection of dye and its appearance in the urine. It is determined\r\n  by allowing the urine to drip from the catheter into a receiver\r\n  containing a drop of 10% NaOH. The first traces of the dye will\r\n  cause a pink color.\r\n\r\n  The time interval chosen for calculating excretion is then computed\r\n  from the instant of this appearance. There is considerable\r\n  diversity in practice as regards this time interval, and it would\r\n  seem that shorter intervals and quicker results are gaining in\r\n  preference, as well as being considered equal in value to longer\r\n  periods.\r\n\r\n  The percentage excretion of the dye is now measured in each sample\r\n  of urine. To do this, prepare a standard solution, made by diluting\r\n  0.5 cc. of the phenolsulphonephthalein solution mentioned above\r\n  to about 200 cc. with water, adding 5-10% NaOH until no further\r\n  intensification of the red color is produced (requires a few cc.),\r\n  diluting to one liter, and mixing. This standard then represents\r\n  50% (3 mg.) of the amount of the dye injected. The color of the\r\n  urine sample is similarly developed with alkali, and the mixture\r\n  diluted to 1 liter, mixed, and compared with the standard in a\r\n  colorimeter. The per cent excretion in the specimen equals the\r\n  reading of the standard solution multiplied by 50 and divided by\r\n  the reading of the urine mixture, when the colors are matched in\r\n  the instrument.\r\n\r\n  For accurate work, it is desirable to balance in the standard the\r\n  urine color of the unknown, and this is accomplished by including\r\n  in the standard a volume of urine (dye-free) _proportional_ to that\r\n  in the unknown. Also, with a low excretion, it is better not to\r\n  dilute the unknown to 1 liter, but to some lesser volume that will\r\n  give a tint closer to that of the standard, and then allow for the\r\n  variation in the calculation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.—Fibres, starch granules, etc., which may\r\nbe found in urine sediment.

It is satisfactory\r\n  unless the colors of the standards fade.\r\n\r\n  After intravenous injection, the normal appearance time is 4-6\r\n  minutes, and the normal elimination is 35-40% in 15 minutes, and\r\n  totals of 50-65% for 30 minutes and 65-80% for 60 minutes; or, for\r\n  the first 30 minutes, it may be stated as about 1% per minute from\r\n  each kidney.\r\n\r\n  After intramuscular injection, the normal appearance time is nearer\r\n  10 minutes, and the normal elimination is 30-40% in 30 minutes, and\r\n  totals of about 50% (40-60) for 60 minutes, and about 80% (60-85)\r\n  for 2 hours, or 20-25% during the second hour. If the appearance\r\n  time is not determined, it is customary to allow for it, collecting\r\n  the first hour’s specimen at 70 minutes after injection of dye and\r\n  the second hour’s 60 minutes later.\r\n\r\n  Impairment of kidney function, of course, increases appearance time\r\n  and lessens excretion, serious cases not unusually excreting less\r\n  than 1% during two hours.\r\n\r\n  When the question of the kidney involved arises, the urine must be\r\n  taken by ureteral catheterization or by a separator.\r\n\r\n  =Starches and Fibres.=—In examining urinary sediments it is\r\n  important to be familiar with the various textile fibres and starch\r\n  grains which are so frequently present, the fibres coming from the\r\n  clothing and the starch grains from dusting powders. Wool fibre\r\n  fragments show bark or scale-like imbrications and are round.\r\n  Cotton fibres are flattened and twisted, while linen ones show a\r\n  striated flattened fibre with frayed segments as of a cane stalk.\r\n  Silk shows a glass-like tube with mashed-in ends.\r\n\r\n  Corn and rice grains are the most common of the starch grains and\r\n  their nature is immediately disclosed by their blue color when\r\n  mounted in iodine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFECTIONS OF THE GENITO-URINARY ORGANS\r\n\r\nIn _blackwater fever_ we have marked pain in the region of the\r\nkidneys due to the plugging of the tubules with haemoglobin casts.\r\nVesical tenesmus and pain along the ureters may also be present.\r\n\r\n  In _malaria_ Thayer states that nephritis occurs in about 2% of\r\n  malignant tertian cases.\r\n\r\n  In _bilharziasis_ the kidneys are involved secondarily—the change\r\n  being brought about by stone in the bladder and cystitis leading to\r\n  hydronephrosis and pyelonephritis.\r\n\r\nCases of cystitis occurring in dysentery have been reported which\r\nshowed amoebae in the sediment of the urine. Such cases probably were\r\nconnected with recto-vesical fistulae caused by amoebic ulceration.\r\n\r\n  In _cholera_ the kidneys are markedly affected, especially the\r\n  epithelial lining of the tubules.\r\n\r\n  _Malta fever_ may rarely be attended by an orchitis.\r\n\r\nOne of the manifestations of filarial disease is _lymph scrotum_ in\r\nwhich the scrotum is covered with small blebs containing a chylous\r\nfluid which may possibly contain microfilariae. It is associated with\r\nrecurring attacks of lymphangitis. There is also a filarial orchitis\r\nand we may have a lymphangitis of the lymphatics of the cord. Again\r\nfilarial disease may show a chylocele in which the tunica vaginalis\r\ncontains a fluid similar to that seen in the varices of lymph\r\nscrotum. This fluid may also show filarial embryos.\r\n\r\n  In _endemic funiculitis_ there is a sudden onset with high\r\n  temperature and pain in spermatic cord and epididymis. The general\r\n  condition rapidly becomes grave with a hard, tender, cylindrical\r\n  swelling along the cord and also pain and swelling of epididymis.\r\n  It is a streptococcus infection usually engrafted on a filarial or\r\n  bilharzial process and demands immediate surgical measures.\r\n\r\n_Kala-azar_ may be accompanied by sloughing of the scrotum at the\r\ntime manifestations of cancrum oris are noted.\r\n\r\nCases of gangrene of the scrotum have been reported as connected with\r\n_malaria_.\r\n\r\n  Gangrene of the scrotum and penis is not infrequently noted in\r\n  _Rocky Mountain fever_.\r\n\r\nIn puzzling febrile cases in the tropics one should always think of a\r\npossible _pyelitis_. Then too keep in mind _renal tuberculosis_.\r\n\r\n  If _leprosy_ comes on before puberty the sexual organs remain in\r\n  an undeveloped condition. Leprous infiltrations are noted in the\r\n  testicles and ovaries. In nerve leprosy, which does not usually\r\n  come on until after puberty, the women may bear healthy children\r\n  and it is now thought that the view that leprosy markedly tends to\r\n  produce sterility is lacking in confirmation.\r\n\r\n  In _ancylostomiasis_ menstruation is markedly interfered with and\r\n  amenorrhoea is often a prominent symptom. Young men who have been\r\n  affected before puberty show lack of development of pubic hair\r\n  along with infantile genital organs. The girls do not show normal\r\n  breast development.\r\n\r\n  _Granuloma of the pudenda_ is a disease which is rather frequent in\r\n  British Guiana.\r\n\r\n  _Dhobie itch_ is characteristically located in the crotch region.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF URINE\r\n\r\nAbout the only tropical disease in which a bacteriological\r\nexamination of the urine is of particular value is that in connection\r\nwith _Malta fever_. It is advisable to cleanse the meatus with\r\nalcohol and then having discarded the first ounce or so of the urine\r\nto receive the remainder in a sterile salt mouth bottle. A drop of\r\nthis urine can be deposited on a poured agar plate and smeared out\r\nover the surface.\r\n\r\n  As dysentery bacilli and cholera spirilla are practically absent\r\n  from the blood, urine examination for the causative organisms in\r\n  these diseases is fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe culturing of the urine to find paratyphoid or typhoid organisms\r\nshould be carried out, as well as blood cultures, where we are\r\ndealing with puzzling fevers in the tropics. The Teague plating\r\nmedium described under the chapter on Faeces is a very satisfactory\r\none.\r\n\r\n  In culturing urine from a case of pyelitis blood agar is a most\r\n  excellent differentiating medium for streptococci.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nTHE FAECES AND THE ALIMENTARY TRACT IN TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAECES\r\n\r\n  It is advisable to examine a stool macroscopically before taking up\r\n  the microscopical examination. Pus or blood in stools may often be\r\n  noted without the aid of the microscope.\r\n\r\n  The normal stool is sausage-shaped and soft.\r\n\r\n  The mucus of bacillary dysentery is opaque and grayish from the\r\n  great number of pus and phagocytic cells. It is well to remember\r\n  that Charcot-Leyden crystals, which are practically always absent\r\n  from bacillary dysentery stools, are not infrequent findings in\r\n  the amoebae-containing stools; of course, these crystals appear in\r\n  other intestinal parasite infections.\r\n\r\n  In obstruction of the common bile duct we have acholic, whitish,\r\n  foul-smelling stools. If the putty color be due to bacterial change\r\n  exposure to the air will restore the brownish tinge.\r\n\r\n  Sprue stools are whitewash to putty-colored, pultaceous, and filled\r\n  with air bubbles. The amount is excessive.\r\n\r\n  A very practical way of obtaining amoebae is to pass a rectal tube\r\n  or a piece of drainage tube with fenestrations into the bowel, and\r\n  amoebae may be found in the mucus filling the perforations in the\r\n  tube.\r\n\r\n  Ordinarily the stool is best collected in quart fruit jars\r\n  and examined as soon after evacuation as possible. The wooden\r\n  spatula-like tongue depressors are well adapted for handling the\r\n  specimen.\r\n\r\n  In examining a stool, it is well to color the drop of faeces, which\r\n  is to be covered with the cover-glass, with a small loopful of ½%\r\n  solution of neutral red. If diluting fluid is used, it should be\r\n  salt solution, and not water. The neutral red tinges the granules\r\n  of the endoplasm of amoebae and flagellates a very striking\r\n  brown-red color, thus differentiating them from vegetable cells or\r\n  body cells.\r\n\r\n  Encysted protozoa are difficult to diagnose, unless one possesses\r\n  considerable experience. In examining for encysted amoebae as well\r\n  as for bringing out the number of flagella of flagellates I now use\r\n  the following method: Take a clean slide and make a vaseline line\r\n  across it about 1 inch from the end. A drop of the iodine solution\r\n  is placed on the slide about ½ inch from the vaselined line and a\r\n  suitable portion of the faeces to be examined is emulsified in it.\r\n  The edge of a square cover-glass is then applied to the vaselined\r\n  line and allowed to drop on the preparation. By pressure suitable\r\n  thicknesses of fluid can be examined. There is an absence of\r\n  current motion.\r\n\r\n  Epithelial cells are generally more or less disintegrated. In\r\n  the mucus of bacillary dysenteric stools, however, large intact\r\n  phagocytic cells are frequent, which may be mistaken for encysted\r\n  amoebae, and the polynuclear cell count averages 90% as contrasted\r\n  with the average polynuclear count of 7.5% in amoebic dysentery.\r\n\r\n  When a smear preparation is desired, we may smear out a fragment\r\n  of mucus and stain by Romanowsky’s or Gram’s method. Beautiful\r\n  preparations may be made by mixing the faeces with water, then\r\n  centrifuging for one minute. This throws down vegetable débris\r\n  and crystals. Now decant the supernatant fluid, which holds the\r\n  bacteria in suspension, and add an equal amount of alcohol. Again\r\n  centrifuge, decant, and smear out and examine the bacterial\r\n  sediment.\r\n\r\nSimply taking a small mass of faeces and emulsifying it with a wooden\r\ntoothpick on a concave slide in 70% alcohol—then, after the sediment\r\nsettles, taking up a loopful with platinum loop from the surface and\r\nsmearing out, gives a very satisfactory smear. Gram’s method, with\r\ndilute carbol fuchsin counterstaining, gives the best picture.\r\n\r\n  To culture for typhoid, dysentery, cholera, or other bacteria,\r\n  take up the material in a tube of sterile bouillon and smear it\r\n  out with a swab over a lactose litmus agar plate or an Endo or\r\n  Conradi-Drigalski plate. Before streaking the plates they should\r\n  be very dry on the surface. This can be best done by pouring the\r\n  melted agar into a plate with a circular piece of filter-paper in\r\n  the lid and placing in the incubator for one-half hour to dry. The\r\n  filter-paper absorbs the moisture. Then inoculate the surface of\r\n  the plate with the faecal material.\r\n\r\n=Teague Medium.=—We have formerly preferred the Endo plate for\r\ntyphoid work and the lactose litmus agar when culturing for dysentery\r\nbacilli. More recently we have obtained most satisfactory results\r\nwith the Teague medium. The colon colonies, after eighteen hours,\r\nare deep black and opaque while the typhoid-dysentery group show\r\ncolorless, transparent colonies.\r\n\r\n  The medium is prepared as follows: Nutrient agar is made in the\r\n  usual way, containing 1.5% agar, 1% Witte’s peptone, 0.5% sodium\r\n  chloride, and 0.5% Liebig’s meat extract, to the liter of distilled\r\n  water. It is cleared with egg-white, placed in flasks, and\r\n  sterilized in the Arnold sterilizer on three successive days. The\r\n  reaction is brought to plus 0.8. The agar is melted and saccharose\r\n  0.5% and lactose 0.5% are added. The medium is then heated for ten\r\n  minutes in the Arnold. To every 50 cc. of the medium are added 1\r\n  cc. of 2% yellowish eosin and 1 cc. of 0.5% methylene blue. The\r\n  mixture is shaken and plates poured. Eosin solution should be added\r\n  first.\r\n\r\n=Occult Blood.=—In performing the test for occult blood, one\r\nshould exclude the possibility of blood reaching the bowels from an\r\nextraneous source, such as ingested foods, mouth, nose, lungs and\r\nvagina, and the absence of interfering substances should be ensured.\r\nAn absolute milk diet, or, at least, a diet containing neither meat\r\nnor green vegetables, is indicated for two or three days prior to\r\nthe test, and all medication should be suspended. The technique noted\r\non page 524 should be followed scrupulously when dealing with faeces.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the absence of occult blood from the\r\nfaeces may be accepted as an indication of cure in ancylostomiasis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.—Cestodes and cestode ova.]\r\n\r\n=Ova in Faeces.=—It is in the faeces we examine either for the\r\nparasites or for their ova in connection with practically all the\r\nflukes, except the lung fluke and the bladder fluke; for intestinal\r\ntaeniases and for practically all the round-worms, except the\r\nfilarial ones.\r\n\r\n  In the tropics, the examination of the faeces exceeds in value that\r\n  of urine and is possibly more important than blood examinations.\r\n\r\n=Helminthiasis Statistics.=—There is one point in connection with\r\nthe statistical reports as to the presence of intestinal parasites in\r\na given section of the tropics that I desire to emphasize.\r\n\r\nBecause a limited district shows a certain prevalence of intestinal\r\nparasites we should not conclude that the entire country from which\r\nsuch findings emanate shows a similar extent and type of infection.\r\nTake for instance the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.—Trematode ova.]\r\n\r\n  In 1910, there were made in Cavite Province 932 stool examinations\r\n  upon specimens from cases of sick people and of these only such\r\n  patients as it was thought required such an examination for\r\n  diagnostic reasons were made to bring such a specimen of faeces.\r\n\r\n  Of the 932 examinations, 135 or 14.4% failed to show the presence\r\n  of intestinal parasites or their ova. The remaining positive\r\n  examinations gave findings as follows:\r\n\r\n  -------------------+----------------------+---------------\r\n       Organism      | Number of infections | Per cent.\r\n  -------------------+----------------------+---------------\r\n  _Ascaris_          |       627            |  67.2\r\n  _Trichocephalus_   |       607            |  65.1\r\n  Flagellates        |       135            |  14.4\r\n  Amoebae            |       111            |  10.9\r\n  Hookworm           |        23            |   2.4\r\n  _Taenia saginata_  |         3            |   0.3\r\n  _Balantidium_      |         1            |   0.1\r\n  _Strongyloides_    |         1            |   0.1\r\n  -------------------+----------------------+---------------\r\n\r\n  At Bilibid Prison, Garrison encountered amoebic infection in 23% of\r\n  the cases. In the medical survey of Taytay, his findings were 2.7%.\r\n  Rissler and Gomez report only 0.39% of amoebic infection in their\r\n  examinations in Las Piñas and no cases showing such infections in\r\n  Tuguegarao and Santa Isabel. Such numbers are in striking contrast\r\n  with those of former investigators, some of whom have reported as\r\n  high a percentage of infection as 70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.—Nematode ova.]\r\n\r\n  Our findings as regards flagellates (14.4%) corresponded fairly\r\n  closely with those of Garrison, namely, 21% at Bilibid and 5.5% at\r\n  Taytay.\r\n\r\n  Garrison, for _Trichocephalus_ infection, obtained 59% at Bilibid\r\n  and 77% at Taytay; Rissler and Gomez give 53% at Las Piñas; 25.9%\r\n  at Tuguegarao, and 6.23 at Santa Isabel. Our findings were 65.1%.\r\n\r\n  As regards _Ascaris_ we found a higher rate of infection than for\r\n  any other parasite (67.2%). Garrison encountered 26% at Bilibid and\r\n  82.9% at Taytay. The percentages of Rissler and Gomez are 77, 73,\r\n  and 60 respectively for Las Piñas, Tuguegaroa, and Santa Isabel.\r\n\r\n  Garrison noted at Bilibid an incidence second only to\r\n  _Trichocephalus_ for hookworm infection, namely 52%. His percentage\r\n  of infection at Taytay was 11.6. Rissler and Gomez found 11.14% of\r\n  all cases examined infected with hookworms at Las Piñas, 8.01%\r\n  in Tuguegarao, and 45.38% in Santa Isabel. We noted only 2.4% for\r\n  Cavite, San Roque, and Caridad.\r\n\r\n  Our findings as regards _Strongyloides_ (0.1%) were far below\r\n  those reported by Garrison at Bilibid (3%) and at Taytay (0.7%).\r\n  Rissler and Gomez found 2.24% infected in Las Piñas, but no cases\r\n  were encountered in Tuguegarao and Santa Isabel. The same factors\r\n  influencing hookworm infection in this locality may be operative\r\n  for _Strongyloides_. Garrison found 0.2% of the individuals\r\n  examined at Taytay to be infected with ciliates, while Gomez and\r\n  Rissler failed to find such infections at Tuguegarao or Santa\r\n  Isabel. We found a single case in the 932 examinations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.—Microscopical constituents of faeces.\r\n(_v.

Later on the tongue may become\r\nfissured and uniformly red. The buccal mucosa shows a carmine flush.\r\nThe gums are tender but there is not the tendency to aphthous ulcers\r\none sees in sprue. The flow of saliva is frequently increased.\r\n\r\nIn _sprue_ there is at first great sensitiveness of the buccal mucosa\r\nso that articles of moderate pungency give rise to painful burning\r\nsensations. The tongue becomes quite sore with vesicle formation\r\nalong borders and tip which soon turn into ulcers. Ulcerations also\r\noccur on the buccal mucosa, particularly at the site of the posterior\r\nupper and lower molar teeth (Crombie’s ulcer).\r\n\r\n  The congestion causes a great increase in mucus especially about\r\n  the faucial pillars and pharynx. Ulcers are common about the\r\n  fraenum of the tongue. While the tongue is coated at first with\r\n  red ulcerated tip and sides it later becomes bare of any coating,\r\n  red and finally even glazed as though varnished. It is at times\r\n  fissured.\r\n\r\n_Onyalai._—A very peculiar disease of Portuguese West Africa and\r\npossibly the Soudan region, known as _onyalai_ is characterized by\r\nthe appearance of blood-distended vesicles of the mucosa of the\r\ncheeks and hard palate. The tongue is often swollen. The skin may\r\nshow haemorrhages and haematuria is not infrequent. The mouth blebs\r\nvary in size from that of a split pea to a diameter of ½ inch or\r\nmore. The cause is unknown.\r\n\r\n_Herpes labialis_ is not so common in tropical as in temperate\r\nclimate malarias. It is absent in plague pneumonia.\r\n\r\n  In _leprosy_ the nodules which form on the inside of the cheeks and\r\n  fauces tend to show ulceration and thickenings. The discharges from\r\n  the ulcerations in the nose, especially that on the vomer, reach\r\n  the pharynx and such leprosy bacilli-containing discharges may be\r\n  expectorated and cause one to consider the material as coming from\r\n  the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn _yellow fever_ the bleeding from the gums usually precedes the\r\nblack vomit.\r\n\r\n  In _kala-azar_ and possibly in _malaria_ we may have gangrenous\r\n  conditions of the cheek, as cancrum oris.\r\n\r\nIn the miliary type of _verruga_ we may have the granulomatous\r\nlesions appearing on the mucous membranes of the mouth.\r\n\r\n  In _typhus_ fever the mouth is strikingly foul with marked sordes\r\n  covering the teeth. The dry brown tongue in this disease is known\r\n  as the “parrot tongue.”\r\n\r\nWe may rarely have parotid gland enlargement in _Malta fever_,\r\n_malaria_ and _tsutsugamushi_.\r\n\r\n  Parotitis is not uncommon in typhus fever. A type of parotitis\r\n  which differs from mumps in not being contagious has been reported\r\n  from the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\nStomach and Oesophagus\r\n\r\nVery important in diagnosis is a tenderness in the pyloric end of the\r\nstomach, which is brought out by attempting to palpate the epigastric\r\nregion. It is marked in yellow fever and acute pernicious beriberi\r\nas well as in blackwater fever and bilious remittent fever. We also\r\nfrequently have epigastric tenderness, extending to the right, in\r\nancylostomiasis.\r\n\r\n  Hookworms patients are often “pot-bellied” and the craving for\r\n  eating unusual articles, as earth, may be connected with the\r\n  gastric hyperacidity which the patient desired to neutralize with\r\n  alkaline earth.\r\n\r\n_Sprue_ gives a flatulent dyspepsia with gaseous eructations.\r\n\r\n_Pellagra_ gives eructations and pyrosis and very common is a burning\r\nsensation going up from the stomach along the line of the oesophagus.\r\n\r\n  The esophagus is raw in _sprue_ so that swallowing is painful.\r\n\r\n\r\nNausea and Vomiting\r\n\r\nSo many diseases are attended with nausea, besides those in which\r\nnausea is accompanied by rather constant vomiting, that it would\r\nhardly seem advisable to consider it alone. At the same time the\r\nslight nausea which often accompanies _bacillary dysentery_, as one\r\nof the manifestations of toxaemia, is of value in differentiating\r\nthis type of dysentery from the amoebic one.\r\n\r\n  In _yellow fever_ there may be early vomiting of whitish or\r\n  bile-stained mucus but the well-known black vomit is a later\r\n  feature, only occurring after the fourth day when the other\r\n  haemorrhagic manifestations set in.\r\n\r\n  Bilious vomiting is the feature in _bilious remittent fever_ which\r\n  causes the patient the greatest distress.\r\n\r\nIn _blackwater fever_ the frequent retching and bilious vomiting tend\r\nto exhaust the patient and the persistent vomiting of green bile\r\noften precedes death.\r\n\r\n  Bilious vomiting may be quite a feature of the icteric type of\r\n  _relapsing fever_.\r\n\r\n_Vomiting sickness._—There is a disease known as _vomiting sickness_\r\nwhich has been noted in Jamaica. It occurs chiefly in children\r\nand has a sudden onset with marked vomiting followed by cerebral\r\nsymptoms and great mortality. Some have thought the disease to be\r\nyellow fever but the fever and jaundice of that disease are absent.\r\nScott has thought it to be epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis, but\r\nmore recently has suggested that it is possibly due to the eating of\r\nsome poisonous substance, plant or otherwise, and that it is not an\r\ninfectious disease. It is now recognized as due to ackee poisoning.\r\n\r\n  Vomiting is often a sign of dangerous vagal involvement in _acute\r\n  pernicious beriberi_. Some consider that the extreme dilatation of\r\n  the right heart, pressing on the stomach, may be the excitant of\r\n  this vomiting.\r\n\r\nThe vomiting of _cholera_ follows the diarrhoea. The material vomited\r\nmay be of the same character as the rice-water stools.\r\n\r\n  In _ptomaine poisoning_ vomiting precedes the diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n  Rarely a _liver abscess_ may burst into the stomach, in which case\r\n  we would have the vomiting of pus. Of course the more common route\r\n  is by the lungs in which case the chocolate-colored liver abscess\r\n  pus would be coughed up instead of vomited up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Intestinal Tract\r\n\r\nIt is usual to consider constipation as a clinical feature of\r\nsuch diseases as plague, yellow fever, Malta fever, beriberi and\r\ntsutsugamushi, as well as typhus fever.\r\n\r\n  Abdominal pains are most often connected with _dysenteric_\r\n  conditions and it is customary to state that the greater the\r\n  tormina, or intestinal griping, the nearer is the dysenteric\r\n  process to the caecum.\r\n\r\nIn _cholera_ the cramping of the abdominal muscles may follow that of\r\nthe calf muscles.\r\n\r\n  In _sprue_ we may have a doughy sensation on palpating the abdomen\r\n  due to the fermenting contents of the intestine.\r\n\r\nIn the algid type of _pernicious malaria_ the abdominal griping may\r\nbe severe.\r\n\r\nTenesmus is the condition which along with tormina gives a diagnosis\r\nof some form of dysentery.\r\n\r\n  In rectal _schistosomiasis_ the thickenings and blood\r\n  extravasations, resulting from the eggs extruded by the fluke,\r\n  may give rise to prolapse of the rectum. This may also occur in\r\n  severe bacillary dysentery and in a disease of British Guiana\r\n  and Venezuela, known as _epidemic gangrenous rectitis_, prolapse\r\n  and gangrene of the rectum may occur. The symptoms are those of\r\n  gangrenous dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea\r\n\r\nThe chronic diarrhoeas of the tropics are often associated with\r\namoebic dysentery and in such cases we generally get a history of\r\nrecurring attacks of diarrhoea separated by periods of constipation.\r\n\r\nIn _sprue_ the condition generally sets in as a morning diarrhoea,\r\nvery profuse and painless. _Hill diarrhoea_ also shows frequent\r\nstools of whitish color from early morning until about noon.\r\n\r\n  The typical stool of _sprue_ is a gas-permeated, putty-colored,\r\n  offensive mass, extraordinarily copious.\r\n\r\n  In _cholera_ the rice-water stool, which is not attended by pain,\r\n  causes an unusual sense of prostration even at the onset of the\r\n  stage of evacuation.\r\n\r\n  In _pellagra_ we often have a recurring diarrhoea or mild\r\n  manifestations of dysentery.\r\n\r\n  The stool of pellagra is darker and less copious than that of sprue\r\n  and shows only a normal fat content while that of sprue is very\r\n  fatty—as much as 30% of ingested fat appearing in the sprue stool\r\n  as against the 5% for the normal one.\r\n\r\nIn _Japanese schistosomiasis_, following the stage of urticarial\r\nfever, we have our best diagnostic means in examining the\r\nblood-tinged bit of mucus capping the stool for the spineless ova of\r\nthe fluke.\r\n\r\n  The _fluke diseases_ of the liver and intestines give rise to\r\n  various disturbances. The diagnosis is by the finding of the\r\n  specific ova.\r\n\r\n  In infections with _Strongyloides stercoralis_ there may be vague\r\n  manifestations of neurasthenia and diarrhoeal disturbances. Cochin\r\n  China diarrhoea was once thought to be a _Strongyloides_ infection.\r\n\r\n  Infections with amoebae, intestinal flagellates and ciliates are\r\n  discussed under dysentery.\r\n\r\n  Intestinal flagellates are so common in the stools of well people\r\n  in the tropics that one should be very careful in assigning a\r\n  pathogenic rôle to them.\r\n\r\n  It is now generally accepted that _Lamblia (Giardia)_ can bring\r\n  about exhausting diarrhoeas.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntestinal Myiases\r\n\r\nIn the tropics vague intestinal disturbances or violent abdominal\r\ncramping may be brought about by dipterous larvae in the intestinal\r\ncanal. The symptoms may be those of a dysentery and may be attended\r\nwith fever and malaise. The biliary tract also may be invaded. For a\r\nmore detailed statement of the several myiases, see Chapter XXV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.—Larva of _Musca vomitoria_ (_Calliphora\r\nvomitoria_); below: of natural size; above, enlarged. (Leuckart.)\r\n(From Tyson.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 159.—Larva of _Anthomyia canicularis_, enlarged. Rarely found\r\nin the stool. (Gould.) (From Tyson.)]\r\n\r\n  The larvae usually obtain access to the alimentary tract in food\r\n  taken in by the mouth. Flies of the genus _Sarcophaga_ are prone\r\n  to deposit their larvae on food, especially meat that is somewhat\r\n  tainted. Other flies, as _Musca_ or _Anthomyia_, may lay their eggs\r\n  on food. Flies of the genus _Anthomyia_ tend to lay their eggs on\r\n  plants.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a fly to deposit its eggs or larvae about the anus\r\nwhile the man is at stool.\r\n\r\n  Great care must always be observed to assure one’s self that fly\r\n  larvae, which may be present in the stool, have not originated from\r\n  larvae deposited on the stool subsequent to its passage.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF DIPTEROUS LARVAE\r\n\r\nThere are certain points in the anatomy of dipterous larvae which\r\nmust be considered in recognition of the genus or family of the\r\nflies concerned in the various myiases. The broad extremity is the\r\nposterior one and the tapering one the anterior. The dark hook-like\r\nprocesses, which may be in pairs or fused, project from the anterior\r\nor head end and above them is a pair of projecting papillae. The\r\nsecond segment from the head has on either side projecting hand or\r\nfan-like structures with varying numbers of terminal divisions, 4 to\r\n40 or more. These are the anterior spiracles.\r\n\r\n  The large terminal segment has on its posterior surface two\r\n  chitinized plates with 3 slits of various architecture in each.\r\n  These are the posterior stigmal plates and are the structures we\r\n  pay particular attention to in identification. In the early larval\r\n  stages there is only one slit; in the second stage there are two.\r\n  It is only in the fully developed larval stage that we note the\r\n  characteristic 3 slit stigmal plates. The presence or absence of a\r\n  rounded protuberance or button at the base of each stigmal plate\r\n  should be looked for. The area carrying the stigmal plates may be\r\n  sunken to form a pit.

This definition is further expanded to\r\n  include joint affections of intestinal origin, and also those\r\n  in which neither the causal organism nor its focus of origin is\r\n  discoverable, but which by analogy we unhesitatingly recognize as\r\n  being due to an infective agent.\r\n\r\n  It is to be noted that the lesions of arthritis may develop either\r\n  in the intra-articular membranes or in the bony parts adjacent to a\r\n  joint, and that they may remain confined to their primary site or\r\n  eventually extend to involve other tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INFECTIOUS ARTHRITIS\r\n\r\n  A. Of known etiology.\r\n\r\n  May be acute or chronic. Examples are: Gonorrhoea, typhoid,\r\n  tuberculosis, bacillary dysentery, pneumococcus infections,\r\n  pyogenic cocci, filariasis, Malta fever, secondary to any\r\n  recognized focus.\r\n\r\n  B. Of unknown etiology.\r\n\r\n  May be acute or chronic: Examples are: Acute articular rheumatism,\r\n  rheumatoid arthritis, four types beginning with acute symptoms, one\r\n  type having insidious onset. These are often due to unidentified\r\n  foci.\r\n\r\n  NONINFECTIOUS ARTHRITIS\r\n\r\n  A. Traumatic.\r\n\r\n  1. Acute, due to known traumatism.\r\n\r\n  2. Chronic, generally static in origin, or due to chronic strain\r\n  or irritation. Possibly includes villous arthritis of the knee and\r\n  hypertrophic arthritis in the young.\r\n\r\n  B. Trophic.\r\n\r\n  1. Metabolic. Examples are gout, psoriasis and probably\r\n  hypertrophic arthritis.\r\n\r\n  2. Senile.\r\n\r\n  3. Neuropathic. Examples are tabes, leprosy, syringomyelia,\r\n  Raynaud’s disease, and scleroderma.\r\n\r\n  4. Arteriosclerotic.\r\n\r\n  C. Blood dyscrasias, as haemophilia, anaemias and scurvy.\r\n\r\n  D. Toxic, as lead poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of more peculiar importance for the tropics in which\r\njoint involvement must be considered in the diagnosis are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_Malta Fever._—This infection offers a good example of a disease\r\nin which joint symptomatology is of diagnostic and therapeutic\r\nimportance. A prolonged typhoid-like course with sudden and painful\r\nswelling of various joints, hip, shoulder, ankle or costo-vertebral\r\narticulations, if occurring in the endemic area of Malta fever,\r\nwould at once make one suspect this disease. Typhoid does not give\r\npainful joints, dengue is not accompanied by joint swelling, while\r\ngonorrhoeal polyarthritis will be accompanied by other evidence of\r\ngonorrhoeal infection.\r\n\r\n  The neuralgias, sciaticas and painful joints, together with the\r\n  sweats which exhaust the sufferer from Malta fever, often tempt\r\n  both patient and physician to resort to narcotics. Acute or\r\n  subacute effusion into one or more joints is present in at least\r\n  40 per cent of cases of Malta fever according to Rogers. The Malta\r\n  fever joint is not red, which fact, taken with its evanescent\r\n  character, differentiates it from the arthritis of acute rheumatic\r\n  fever.\r\n\r\n_Dengue._—Sporadic dengue is difficult to diagnose. In an epidemic\r\nthe characteristic pains referable to tendinous insertions about\r\njoints are present in at least 50 per cent of cases and is of great\r\ndiagnostic value. There is no swelling of the joints although the\r\nturgescence of the skin over them may give the impression of an\r\narthritis. The intensity of pain varies from a feeling of muscular\r\nsoreness to excruciating pain when muscles or joints are actively\r\nmoved. Passive movement is not usually painful. In addition to\r\nthe rachialgia, bone and joint pains, some writers have described\r\nswelling of the joints. This in my experience is unusual. Joint pains\r\nare so characteristic that they distinguish dengue from all other\r\neruptive fevers.\r\n\r\n  Joint pains during convalescence may produce stiffness and\r\n  crippling continuing for many weeks after the cessation of fever.\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fever._—Bone, muscle and joint pains are practically\r\nalways present in this disease. In addition rachialgia and headache\r\nare prominent symptoms and the aching gnawing pains in loins or nape\r\nof neck may make one think of beginning smallpox, dengue or yellow\r\nfever. There is no swelling of the joints in relapsing fever. As\r\nin dengue the pains in the neighborhood of the joints may be quite\r\npersistent.\r\n\r\n_Yaws._—This disease gives us bone, joint and muscle lesions\r\nsimilar to those of syphilis. From the mother lesion to the tertiary\r\nframboesioma the course and symptoms of the two diseases are\r\nsimilar. Thus we may have the flying pains and osteocopic pains of\r\nthe early days of infection and, as later events, chronic synovitis,\r\nframbroesial infiltration of perisynovial membranes, frambroesial\r\ninfiltration of synovial membranes, chondro-arthritis, epiphysitis\r\nand chronic frambroesial periostitis. These pathological processes\r\ncause such conditions as we know under the names dactylitis, saber\r\nshin, mutilating oro-rhino-palato-pharyngeal ulcerations, Parrot’s\r\nnodes and cranio-tabes.\r\n\r\n  The uncomplicated framboesioma must be pathologically similar\r\n  to the gumma. Certainly the later effects of bone and joint\r\n  destruction and scarring are wonderfully like some of the\r\n  middle-age European descriptions “when lues was in flower.” In\r\n  framboesial disease the damage from bone destruction or from\r\n  contracture following cicatrization may be so complete as to render\r\n  useless a finger, a hand, one of the large joints or even a whole\r\n  extremity.\r\n\r\n_Bacillary Dysentery._—As far back as the 17th century (Sydenham)\r\nit was noted that joint pains or actual arthritides were occasional\r\ncomplications of dysentery. We now know that the bacterial types\r\nof dysentery are those most likely to show joint complications.\r\nBecause the joint fluid in these lesions is usually sterile, it is\r\nassumed that they are the effect of toxins (or a toxin) produced by\r\n_B. dysenteriae_. Of the two hypothetical toxins of the dysentery\r\nbacillus one is supposed to produce neuritis and joint complications.\r\nArthritides are more common in some epidemics than in others and\r\nwith certain strains of bacilli than with others. The Shiga strain\r\nis the worst offender in this regard. Manson reports 27% of joint\r\ninvolvement in one epidemic.\r\n\r\n  Clinically, dysenteric arthritis is more apt to affect one of the\r\n  larger joints, the knee, ankle and hip, being most affected. The\r\n  elbow, wrist or shoulder joint may be affected, though this is\r\n  unusual. The pain and swelling may be an incident of the early part\r\n  of the attack. Usually it comes on when the acute symptoms are\r\n  abating or as a sequela. The joint is distended with effusion and\r\n  this involves the ligaments around the joint. Given an arthritis\r\n  in the course of a frank dysentery there is nothing it could\r\n  ordinarily be confused with. It is well to remember, however, that\r\n  patients with dysentery may have also a concurrent gonorrhoea or\r\n  arthritis from some focal infection. The dysenteric rheumatism\r\n  ordinarily completely subsides with the cure of the colitis.\r\n\r\n  In hepatic abscess following _amoebic_ colitis pain of some type is\r\n  a frequent symptom. Rheumatic-like pains and swelling of the hands\r\n  occur rarely, rapidly disappearing when the abscess is evacuated.\r\n\r\n_Filariasis._—Maitland and Bahr have noted a synovitis which is\r\napparently a complication of filariasis. Bahr has found a fibrotic\r\nankylosis often to follow such a joint condition. The synovitis may\r\nbe followed by pus formation with serious or fatal outcome.\r\n\r\n_Guinea Worm Disease._—Very rarely the female _Dracunculus_ may\r\npenetrate a joint and cause synovitis or arthritis.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—Occasionally there is joint involvement, especially of\r\nthe wrist and ankle joints, in which erosion of the cartilage and\r\nbone dislocation occur giving us a condition similar to the Charcot\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n  It will be remembered that the Charcot joint is most often seen\r\n  in tabes and may give one of the greatest joint swellings. As a\r\n  rule only one joint, usually knee or hip, is involved in tabes and\r\n  the affection is generally painless. The progress may be acute,\r\n  subacute or chronic. Syringomyelia, a disease which may be confused\r\n  with leprosy, may also show joint involvement, usually of the upper\r\n  extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONE AFFECTIONS\r\n\r\n_Mycetoma._—As the result of the invasion of an extremity—usually\r\nthe foot—with the causative fungi, disorganization of the tissues\r\ninvolved takes place. The granulomatous process invades muscles\r\nand bones and as a result of the sinus formation we have the bones\r\nconverted into a softened, cheesy mass. This disintegration of bone\r\nand other tissues is attended with little or no pain. The granules\r\ndischarging through the sinuses make for a proper diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Goundou._—In goundou the nasal bones and the nasal processes of the\r\nsuperior maxilla are the seat of symmetrical swellings of the nature\r\nof an hypertrophic osteitis. These exostoses may be quite large so\r\nthat there is interference with vision. There is little or no pain\r\nconnected with the bony growths and there is no invasive tendency.\r\n\r\n_Big Heel._—There has been observed in natives of the Gold Coast\r\nan affection of the os calcis somewhat like that involving the\r\nsuperior maxillary bones in goundou. The disease begins with pain and\r\ntenderness of one or both heels. The enlargement may involve only one\r\nos calcis or affect both bones. There is no joint involvement but\r\nlocomotion is interfered with. There are periods of improvement which\r\nare followed by return of the pains.\r\n\r\n_Ainhum._—In this disease there is thinning or absorption of the\r\nbones of the toe. A fibrous cord replaces the bony structures.\r\n\r\n_Oroya Fever._—In this very serious disease of certain areas of Peru\r\nthe bone pains may be excruciating. These bone pains are especially\r\nmarked in the sternum but also involve the long bones.\r\n\r\n_Trench Fever._—Pain over the shin bone is a prominent complaint in\r\nthis affection so that the term “trench shin” has been employed.\r\n\r\n_Relapsing Fever._—Bone pains, especially referred to the knees, are\r\ncomplained of by patients with the bilious typhoid of Griesinger.\r\nThis is a type of relapsing fever occurring in Egypt.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—The bone affections of leprosy are considered under the\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCLE INVOLVEMENT\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—In this ancient disease the course of which is marked\r\nby anaesthesia, atrophy, absorption and accidents (cigarette burns,\r\netc.), the lesions of bones, joints, muscles and indeed of all other\r\ntissues are, in great part, due to infiltration of nerves by the\r\norganism of leprosy. The effects are secondary and trophic on the\r\none hand, and on the other partly due to secondary infection of\r\nthe leproma by various bacterial agents. Leprosy was for centuries\r\nconfused with other diseases in which ulceration and mutilation\r\nare features. The value of mercury in differentiating syphilis,\r\nthe recognition of the importance of anaesthesia in this disease,\r\ntogether with the discovery of the bacillus of leprosy and of the\r\netiological factors of several other confusing diseases, have made of\r\nleprosy one of the easiest of all diseases to diagnose correctly. It\r\nis, however, essentially a laboratory diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  In nerve leprosy we often get atrophy of the small muscles of the\r\n  hand and of the muscles of the forearm. The contracture which\r\n  takes place under these circumstances gives the “claw hand.” In\r\n  tubercular and mixed forms of leprosy we may get in addition\r\n  trophic disturbances of the fingers and toes and also extraneous\r\n  infections which may ultimately result in amputation of fingers\r\n  or toes. This process, going on over a considerable time or being\r\n  repeated, results often in stumping of fingers or hands or toes and\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\n  In addition to these openly destructive processes there is often\r\n  seen in leprosy a condition of subcutaneous absorption of all the\r\n  tissues. In this way the distorted finger nail may come to occupy a\r\n  seat over the knuckle or even (though rarely) further up the back\r\n  of the hand or arm. Briefly in leprosy we have, as representing the\r\n  pathology, muscular atrophy from nerve involvement, periostitis\r\n  and arthritis, interstitial absorption of bone and contractures\r\n  resulting in mutilation of fingers, toes, hands and feet from\r\n  trophic disturbance and intercurrent bacterial infection.\r\n\r\n_Beriberi._—In this disease we have muscular atrophies, especially\r\nof the muscles innervated by the peroneal and ulnar nerves, similar\r\nto those following other forms of peripheral neuritis.\r\n\r\n_Amoebiasis._—There have been reported very rarely disintegrating\r\nlesions of muscles and cutaneous tissues in which amoebae have been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n_Heat Cramps._—In those working in firerooms or steel-mills,\r\nthe excessive heat to which they are subjected may cause various\r\nmanifestations of heat prostration, among which the painful muscle\r\ncramps are prominent. These cramps are similar to those which are\r\nsuch a feature of Asiatic cholera and in each instance are supposed\r\nto be the result of dehydration of muscle tissue.\r\n\r\n_Trichinosis._—Acute muscle pain is a feature of the stage of muscle\r\npenetration by the larval _Trichinella spiralis_. In the disease we\r\nhave a fever suggestive of typhoid fever and oedema about the face.\r\nA marked eosinophilia is characteristic. Another helminthic parasite\r\nwhich may invade the muscles of man is the larval _Taenia solium_.\r\nThis must be of extreme rarity because infection with the adult _T.\r\nsolium_ is most rare and it is only accidental that the embryonic\r\nstage would occur in man. It is a fact that the common tapeworm of\r\nman, _Taenia saginata_, is found in the human host only as a sexually\r\nmature parasite in the intestines; there is never a cysticercus stage\r\nin the muscles.\r\n\r\n_Myositis purulenta tropica._—We may have a suppurative myositis\r\nwith a single abscess formation or with disseminated foci or a\r\ndiffuse purulent infiltration. The attending fever and toxaemia\r\nare similar to those attending any deep abscess formation. Abscess\r\nformation in the muscles has been reported from various parts of\r\nthe tropics, especially the Gold Coast. It is possible that _F.\r\nbancrofti_ infections are concerned in some of these conditions.\r\n\r\n_Filariasis._—Filarial abscesses were found in the ilio-psoas\r\nmuscles in four cases. Wise and Minett found evidences of adult\r\nfilarial worms (_F. bancrofti_) in 22 out of 28 deep-seated\r\nabscesses, which were examined by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nNEUROLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN TROPICAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a great tendency in the tropics to ascribe neurological\r\nmanifestations to beriberi or malaria. It must be acknowledged,\r\nhowever, that various sensory and motor phenomena, which may show\r\nthemselves from time to time, in those who have suffered from\r\nberiberi, are common and prove sources of confusion in diagnosis.\r\nTropical sunlight with its ultra-violet rays had a vogue which held\r\nsway for a brief period as explaining most nervous conditions in\r\nEuropeans in the tropics. At present we are inclined to believe\r\nthat excesses in eating and drinking and late hours may be more\r\npotent in the production of nervous breakdowns than are factors less\r\ncosmopolitan.\r\n\r\n  While syphilis is rampant in many parts of the tropical world the\r\n  usual views are that the luetic neurological manifestations, so\r\n  common in temperate climates, are more or less nonexistent. At the\r\n  same time it would seem advisable with this point in view to study\r\n  the cases attributed to other causes along the line of laboratory\r\n  investigations of the cerebro-spinal fluid.\r\n\r\n  Clinically there are many points of difference between syphilis\r\n  as seen in the native races of tropical regions and as observed\r\n  in Europeans at home, and it would seem advisable to do more work\r\n  along the line of spinal fluid examinations. The examination of the\r\n  spinal fluid for syphilis should include a Wassermann test using\r\n  several concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 cc., a globulin\r\n  estimation, cell count and Langes colloidal gold reaction,—the\r\n  last not being necessary however, unless positive findings are\r\n  obtained in one or more of the other tests. Of course the most\r\n  important test is the Wassermann of the spinal fluid and every one\r\n  should bear in mind the marked complement fixation power of the\r\n  spinal fluid of paretics. In such a fluid we almost always obtain a\r\n  positive reaction where quantities of 0.2 cc. or less are employed,\r\n  while with locomotor ataxia or cerebro-spinal lues amounts of 0.5\r\n  to 1 cc. are generally required to give a positive test. It is not\r\n  necessary to inactivate spinal fluid.\r\n\r\n  These tests can only be carried out in a well equipped laboratory\r\n  and the same is true of the colloidal gold one. The tests for cell\r\n  increase and globulin increase, however, can be made by anyone\r\n  prepared to do ordinary clinical laboratory work.\r\n\r\n  _The normal spinal fluid_ is as clear as water, has a specific\r\n  gravity of about 1.010 and is under a pressure of about 5 to 7 mm.\r\n  of mercury or 60 to 100 mm. of water. The sugar content is about\r\n  0.07% and the proteid content about 0.03 to 0.04%.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREBRO-SPINAL FLUID EXAMINATIONS\r\n\r\n  To withdraw spinal fluid for bacteriological examination or\r\n  cytodiagnosis we use a sterile needle about 4 inches long for an\r\n  adult, preparing the skin as described for blood cultures from\r\n  a vein (see page 516). The patient is placed on the left side\r\n  with knees drawn up and head and shoulders carried forward to\r\n  give the greatest possible space between the spinous processes by\r\n  arching the spine. A line at the level of the iliac crests passes\r\n  between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Select a point\r\n  midway between the spinous processes of these lumbar vertebrae\r\n  and enter the needle two-fifths of an inch to the right of this\r\n  point, pushing the needle inward and upward. Collect the material\r\n  in two or three sterile test tubes, to avoid contamination of the\r\n  entire sample by a drop of blood which may come out in the first\r\n  portion. The presence of blood in very slight amount interferes\r\n  with cytodiagnosis and globulin tests and, if present in more than\r\n  a trace, it makes the colloidal gold test practically worthless.\r\n  Make cultures on blood serum at the earliest possible moment.\r\n  Centrifugalize a portion of the fluid at high speed and examine\r\n  the sediment for bacterial content. After the puncture the patient\r\n  should drink a glass or so of water and remain in bed for a day,\r\n  preferably with the head lower than the feet.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, excluding syphilis, it may be stated that:\r\n\r\n1. A lymphocytosis indicates a tuberculous or poliomyelitis process.\r\nWith these diseases, the fluid will probably be clear.\r\n\r\n2. An abundance of polymorphonuclear and eosinophilic leucocytes\r\nindicates an infection with pyogenic organisms, in which cloudy fluid\r\nis the rule.\r\n\r\nMeningism shows very few cells.\r\n\r\nTrypanosomiasis gives a cellular increase very similar to syphilis.\r\nIn the work of the French Sleeping Sickness Commission five cells per\r\ncubic millimeter was taken as normal.\r\n\r\n  Not only may trypanosomes be found in the spinal fluid, when\r\n  they mark the setting in of the “sleeping sickness” stage of\r\n  trypanosomiasis, but a case has been reported of the presence of\r\n  _Trichinella_ embryos in the spinal fluid. Recently a few cases\r\n  have been reported of anthrax meningitis, in which anthrax bacilli\r\n  have been found in the spinal fluid.\r\n\r\n=Cell Count.=—A method of examination considered by neurologists as\r\nof differential diagnostic value is to count the number of cells in a\r\ncubic millimeter of the cerebro-spinal fluid. The technic is to use a\r\ngentian-violet-tinged 3% solution of acetic acid. This is drawn up to\r\nthe mark 0.5, and the cerebro-spinal fluid is then sucked up to 11.\r\nAfter mixing, the cell count is made with the haemacytometer.\r\n\r\n  Count all the cells appearing in the entire ruled area (9 large\r\n  squares) and add one-sixth of this number to find the approximate\r\n  total number of cells per cubic millimeter of spinal fluid\r\n  examined as above. It is advisable to make the cell count of the\r\n  fluid as soon after obtaining it as possible, the cells tending\r\n  to degenerate or adhere to the glass of the tube. The latter can\r\n  be minimized by vigorous shaking before withdrawal of the fluid\r\n  for counting. Normally we have only two to ten cells per cubic\r\n  millimeter, but in tabes and general paresis this is increased to\r\n  50 or 100 cells, greatest at onset of disease.\r\n\r\n_Pleocytosis._—Miller gives the following table as to pleocytosis:—\r\n\r\nAVERAGE INCIDENCE OF LYMPHOCYTOSIS IN THE SPINAL FLUID\r\n\r\n(Plaut, Relim and Schottmuller)\r\n\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n   Clinical diagnosis | Frequency,|              Remarks\r\n                      | per cent. |\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n  Cerebro-spinal lues |  85-90    | Counts often over 100—may reach\r\n                      |           |   1000 per c.mm.\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n  Tabes dorsalis      |  90       | Counts usually under 100.\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n  General paresis     |  98       | Counts average 30-60 cells per c.mm.\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n  Secondary lues      |  30-40    | Moderate increase as a rule.\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n  Multiple sclerosis  |  25       | Border-line counts.\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n  Cerebral haemorrhage| {Frequency|\r\n  Cerebral tumors     | {   is    | Cellular increase is apt to be a\r\n  Sinus thrombosis    | { variable|    very moderate one.\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_Globulin Increase Tests._—Noguchi’s butyric acid test is very\r\nsatisfactory, but because of the objectionable odor of the butyric\r\nacid, we use the Ross-Jones and Pandy tests routinely in our\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\n  For the Ross-Jones method, one cc. of saturated solution of\r\n  ammonium sulphate is placed in a small test tube and one cc. of\r\n  spinal fluid placed on top of this column. If globulin increase\r\n  is present a turbid ring appears within a few seconds at the\r\n  junction. Normally there is no sign of a ring. This test is a\r\n  modification of Nonne’s Phase 1 reaction. For Pandy’s test, prepare\r\n  a saturated solution of carbolic acid crystals in distilled water.\r\n  Place 1 cc. of this reagent in a small test-tube and add 1 drop of\r\n  spinal fluid. In a normal fluid, only the faintest opalescence is\r\n  observed; but in a fluid with globulin increase a smoke-like white\r\n  cloud develops instantly where the drop comes in contact with the\r\n  reagent.\r\n\r\n=Colloidal Gold Test (Lange’s).=—It is now generally accepted that\r\nthis test is more diagnostic of general paresis than any other single\r\ntest. The color changes in the first five tubes (1-10 : 1-160)\r\nare so constant that the term “paretic curve” is applied to such\r\nfindings. Of less diagnostic value are the so-called cerebro-spinal\r\nlues curves where the color changes, though of less intensity than\r\nthe paretic ones, are most marked in the third, fourth, fifth and\r\nsixth tubes (1-40 to 1-320). In various types of meningitis, other\r\nthan luetic, the color changes are at times more marked in the tubes\r\nwith the higher dilutions of spinal fluids (from 1-320 to 1-2560).\r\n\r\n  The paretic curve of the colloidal gold test generally runs\r\n  parallel with a spinal fluid Wassermann and globulin increase. This\r\n  agreement does not exist at all constantly for positive blood serum\r\n  Wassermann tests and increased cell counts.\r\n\r\n  It may be stated that this test is of more importance in paresis\r\n  than any single one of the four reactions of Nonne, viz.: (_a_)\r\n  blood serum Wassermann; (_b_) spinal fluid Wasserman; (_c_)\r\n  globulin increase, and (_d_) increased cell count of spinal fluid\r\n  (pleocytosis). Of course, all of these tests should be carried out.\r\n\r\n  _Test._—The test is carried out by preparing a series of ten\r\n  test tubes containing dilutions of spinal fluid in 1 cc. of\r\n  normal saline, ranging from 1-10 to 1-5120, and adding 5 cc. of\r\n  the colloidal gold reagent to each tube and to a control tube\r\n  containing salt solution alone. The successful application of\r\n  the test is dependent upon (_a_) care in the preparation of the\r\n  reagent; (_b_) absolute cleanliness of all glassware used, and,\r\n  (_c_) on the entire absence of blood from the spinal fluid. Before\r\n  using a new colloidal gold solution, it should be tested with\r\n  spinal fluid of known reaction, so that it may be discarded if\r\n  too sensitive or not sufficiently so. The color changes usually\r\n  start almost immediately and if there is no change evident in half\r\n  an hour, there will probably be none later. The maximum change\r\n  occurs after several hours, so that readings are made after the\r\n  tubes have stood overnight at room temperature. The proper color\r\n  of the control in tube 11 should be salmon-red or old rose and the\r\n  fluid should be perfectly transparent. When the color is changed\r\n  in tubes containing dilutions of the spinal fluid we record one\r\n  showing a bluish tint as 1. When the change is to a lilac we record\r\n  it as 2. A distinct blue is marked as 3 and a pale blue as 4. When\r\n  decolorization is complete there is the highest color change, which\r\n  is noted as 5.\r\n\r\n  _Mastic Test._—The mastic test as devised by Cutting is apparently\r\n  of value as an aid in the diagnosis of syphilis of the nervous\r\n  system. The test is made by treating six dilutions of spinal fluid\r\n  in test tubes with an alcoholic extract of pure gum mastic, diluted\r\n  with distilled water before using. Its great value lies in the ease\r\n  of preparation from an effective gum mastic, and in the keeping\r\n  qualities of the stock alcoholic extract. After standing at room\r\n  temperature for twelve to eighteen hours or at 37°C., for six to\r\n  twelve hours, readings are made. In positive cases (paresis) the\r\n  mastic will be precipitated in the first one, two, three or four\r\n  tubes (higher in strongly positive cases) leaving the supernatant\r\n  fluid clear, with the mastic as a white flocculent precipitate at\r\n  the bottom of the tube. In some positive reactions the opalescence\r\n  of the fluid persists with a fine white precipitate at the bottom.\r\n  The control tube must remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWING THE AVERAGE FREQUENCY OF THE VARIOUS REACTIONS IN SYPHILIS OF\r\nTHE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (MILLER)\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+---------------+----------------+---------------\r\n                         |    Paresis    | Tabes dorsalis | Cerebro-spinal\r\n                         |   per cent.   |    per cent.   |   syphilis\r\n  -----------------------+---------------+----------------+---------------\r\n  Blood Wassermann       |    98-100     |      70        |     70-80\r\n  Spinal fluid Wassermann|      97       |    60-80       |     85-90\r\n  Pleocytosis            |      98       |    85-90       |     85-90\r\n  Positive globulin test |     100       |    90-95       |     90-95\r\n  Colloidal gold test    |    98-100     |    85-90       |     75-80\r\n                         | Paretic curves| Luetic type of | Luetic curve\r\n                         |               |    curve       |\r\n  -----------------------+---------------+----------------+---------------\r\n\r\n_Other Chemical Constituents._—Normally the fluid reduces Fehling’s\r\nor Benedict’s qualitative copper solutions. It is well for one to\r\ngain experience with the degree of reduction to be normally expected\r\nas the test is but slightly marked. Quantitatively, the reducing\r\nsubstance is equivalent to 60-70 mg. glucose per 100 cc.\r\n\r\nThe urea is practically the same as in the blood, parallels any\r\nchange in the latter, and has the same significance. Creatinine\r\nis about half that of the blood, and has apparently no clinical\r\nsignificance. Uric acid is present in still smaller proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIRIUM AND COMA\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to make a sharp distinction between a disease showing\r\ndelirium and one showing coma as delirious states tend to be followed\r\nby coma or such conditions may alternate.\r\n\r\nIn _yellow fever_ the alert, suspicious mental state may give way\r\nto one of marked delirium requiring close watching to prevent the\r\npatient throwing himself from his bed.\r\n\r\n  In _plague_ there is more of a mild delirious state in which the\r\n  patient has a great tendency to wander about. The mental state is\r\n  rather that of an intoxicated person with the thickness of speech\r\n  and retardation of mental processes.\r\n\r\n_Typhus fever_ and _spotted fever of the Rocky Mountains_ tend to\r\nproduce stuporous states.\r\n\r\n  A delirious state, especially at night, is often noted in\r\n  _tsutsugamushi_.\r\n\r\n  _Rat bite fever_ also tends to show delirium.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary paroxysm of _malignant tertian_ there is quite a\r\ntendency to flightiness during the prolonged hot stage. In the\r\ncerebral types of pernicious malaria there may be violent delirium\r\nfollowed by coma or the patient may be comatose from the onset of\r\nthe paroxysm. Such conditions are often mistaken for sun stroke. In\r\nthe comatose form of malaria we have a high temperature with sighing\r\nor stertorous breathing and at times Cheyne-Stokes respiration.\r\n\r\n  Following upon the algid stage of _cholera_ we may have a stage of\r\n  reaction without the disappearance of anuria, in which a typhoid\r\n  state, with low muttering delirium or even with an acute delirious\r\n  state, supervenes.\r\n\r\n  Toward the end of the sleeping sickness stage of _trypanosomiasis_\r\n  we have a subnormal temperature with a comatose state.\r\n\r\nComatose states following upon the acute confusional psychoses of\r\n_pellagra_ are not uncommon. Pellagra may show an acute collapse\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\nIn _heat stroke_ we may have either delirium or coma. There is no\r\nmore difficult problem encountered in the tropics than the one of\r\ndifferentiating cerebral malaria from heat stroke.\r\n\r\n_Oroya fever_ is frequently accompanied by delirium.\r\n\r\n  In _typhus fever_ (tabardillo) delirious or stuporous states are to\r\n  be expected about the end of the first week or even earlier. This\r\n  is a disease in which the clouding of the consciousness is almost\r\n  as marked as in plague. Delirium is more apt to occur at night.\r\n\r\n  In very toxic cases of _bacillary dysentery_ there may be a mild\r\n  delirium.\r\n\r\n=Insomnia.=—Sleeplessness or, at any rate, a condition where the\r\npatient only dozes is often seen in _dengue_. This mental alertness\r\nand wakefulness may also be noted in _yellow fever_. In malaria,\r\npossibly connected with quinine administration, we may have marked\r\ninsomnia although cases have been reported of insomnia due to malaria\r\nwhich has been relieved by quinine.\r\n\r\n  Just as cardiac decompensation from any cause will be attended by a\r\n  distressing insomnia so is this also a feature of _beriberi_ where\r\n  cardiac involvement is marked.\r\n\r\n_Liver abscess_ may be attended with insomnia.\r\n\r\n_Malta fever_ is often attended with a weariness from suffering with\r\nthe various joint and nerve pains so that insomnia is often marked.\r\n\r\n  Even in _trypanosomiasis_ insomnia may be present at first.\r\n  Insomnia is also one of the early neurasthenic manifestations of\r\n  _pellagra_.\r\n\r\n=Somnolence.=—The disease in which this symptom is best known is\r\n_sleeping sickness_. The patient may go to sleep lying in the bright\r\nsunlight or in the midst of eating a morsel of food. These cases can\r\nbe easily aroused but quickly drop off to sleep afterwards. They\r\noften deny that they were asleep. Later on in sleeping sickness the\r\npatient may sleep from 24 to 36 hours continuously and a more marked\r\ntendency to somnolence may be present by day than by night.\r\n\r\n  In the prodromal stage of _leprosy_ somnolence is often marked and\r\n  accompanied by a sensation of unaccountable weakness. Sweatings and\r\n  accessions of fever may also be noted at this time.\r\n\r\n  In _plague_ the rather stuporous state of the patient may give the\r\n  impression of somnolence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEPHALALGIA, RACHIALGIA AND OTHER PAINS\r\n\r\n_Yellow fever_ is marked by pains in the lumbar region, the _coup de\r\nbarre_ of the French. It is as if the patient had been beaten over\r\nthe small of the back with a bar of iron. The headache is rather\r\norbital and is often excruciating. There are also frequently heavy,\r\ndull pains of the extremities.\r\n\r\n_Blackwater fever_ also has marked pains in the lumbar region giving\r\nexpression to the kidney damage done by the haemoglobin detritus\r\nplugging the tubules.\r\n\r\n  In all forms of _malaria_, but especially in the paroxysms of\r\n  malignant malaria, there are severe headaches and pains in the\r\n  extremities. Intermittent neuralgia is often regarded as malarial.\r\n\r\n_Dengue_ gives rise to a marked post-orbital soreness rather than\r\npain. There is also a marked rachialgia with pains in the limbs\r\noften referred to the regions of the joints, which, however, are not\r\nswollen.\r\n\r\nIn _Malta fever_ the neuralgias, especially sciatica, often\r\nassociated with suddenly appearing, painful joint swellings, are\r\nprominent features.\r\n\r\n  In _trypanosomiasis_ headache is often marked, together with a\r\n  characteristic deep hyperaesthesia, so that the striking of a limb\r\n  against a hard object gives rise to excruciating pain, there being,\r\n  however, a delay in the experiencing of the painful sensation.\r\n\r\nIn _relapsing fever_ the headache is often intense with pains in the\r\nback and bones.\r\n\r\n  In _cholera_ one of the most striking phenomena of the disease\r\n  is the terrible cramping of the muscles, especially those of the\r\n  calves and feet. These pains actually torture the patient. Cramps\r\n  of abdominal muscles as well as those of extremities are often\r\n  noted in _heat stroke_ in men in firerooms.\r\n\r\nIn _beriberi_ there is often pain in the epigastric region so that\r\nthe slightest touch causes great distress. This epigastric tenderness\r\nis also a feature of yellow fever. The calf muscles are also\r\nmarkedly hyperaesthetic in beriberi.\r\n\r\nIn _leprosy_ the neuralgic pains may be very severe while the nerves\r\nare being pressed upon by the connective tissue increase of the\r\nendoneurium and perineurium. Mention has been made of excruciating\r\npains of toes, especially the big toe, even suggesting gout.\r\n\r\n  The excruciating pains of _Oroya fever_ are connected with the\r\n  changes taking place in the bone marrow. There is probably more\r\n  rapid alteration in the blood picture in this disease than in any\r\n  other. It might be designated a fulminating pernicious anaemia.\r\n\r\nPain on pressure on dorsal or lumbar spine is common in _pellagra_.\r\n\r\n_Plague_ may be associated, during the first day or two, with an\r\nexcruciating headache. This may even be prodromal but tends to\r\ndisappear with the rapidly developing stuporous state of the patient.\r\n\r\n  In _typhus fever_ boring headache, oppressive rather than\r\n  lancinating, is a feature of the first days. It is usually frontal\r\n  or temporal.\r\n\r\nIn _malignant tertian_ the headache is often quite intense during the\r\nprolonged hot stage. The headache of malaria is usually frontal or\r\nsuboccipital.\r\n\r\nIn _trench fever_ we may have a cutaneous hyperaesthesia over the\r\nshins. _Rocky Mountain fever_ shows joint pains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREMORS AND CONVULSIONS\r\n\r\nIt is in _trypanosomiasis_ that we have the most important tremor.\r\nIt is the fine tremors, which first are noticeable in the tongue\r\nand later in hands and even legs, that mark the onset of the stage\r\nof sleeping sickness with the trypanosomes in the cerebro-spinal\r\nfluid. At times an intention tremor may be noted in advanced cases\r\nof sleeping sickness. In addition we have epileptiform seizures in\r\nsleeping sickness.\r\n\r\n  In cerebral manifestations of _pernicious malaria_ there is a type\r\n  characterized by epileptiform convulsions.\r\n\r\n  In the acute stage of _Brazilian trypanosomiasis_ we may have\r\n  almost any type of cerebral or cord lesion.\r\n\r\nTremors of tongue and hands may be present in the second stage of\r\n_pellagra_.\r\n\r\nFibrillary tremors have been noted in the main-en-griffe of\r\n_beriberi_ but tremors of the tongue and hands, so common in\r\nalcoholic neuritis, are rare in beriberi.\r\n\r\n  Convulsive seizures are not uncommon in the hyperpyrexial type of\r\n  _heat stroke_.\r\n\r\nIn infantile beriberi the child often becomes rigid. There is not\r\na true convulsion but such cases are at times thought to have\r\nmeningitis.\r\n\r\n  In _schistosomiasis_ and _paragonomiasis_ as well as in infections\r\n  with the larval stage of _Taenia solium_ we may have brain\r\n  involvement and manifestations of Jacksonian epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERED REFLEXES INCLUDING SENSORY AND MOTOR DISTURBANCES\r\n\r\n_Beriberi._—It is usually stated that the tendon reflexes of the\r\nlower extremity, especially the patellar reflex, are absent. While\r\nthis is generally true they may at first show an exaggeration and\r\nsome cases do not seem to show any decided change. There may be\r\nstriking variation from day to day in the reflexes. The superficial\r\nreflexes, especially the cremasteric, are as a rule more active than\r\nnormally.\r\n\r\nThe sensory changes in beriberi are less marked than those of the\r\nmotor side. There is rarely complete anaesthesia but rather a\r\nblunting of sensation. Hyperaesthesia, particularly of the muscles of\r\nthe calf of the leg, is well marked when the muscles are grasped with\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n  The anaesthesia is earliest noted over the shin bone and dorsum of\r\n  the foot. A loss of tactile sense is often noted about finger tips\r\n  making it difficult for the patient to button his coat.\r\n\r\n  The most striking motor phenomena are the foot and wrist-drop,\r\n  especially the former. The extensor muscles are more markedly\r\n  involved than the flexors. There is marked muscular weakness of\r\n  foot as well as hands. The weakness of the muscles of the leg is\r\n  often the first symptom to be complained of. The type of palsy in\r\n  beriberi is mainly paraplegic although hemiplegic and monoplegic\r\n  types have been reported. The paralysis of the diaphragm is the\r\n  most serious of the muscle palsies.\r\n\r\nContractures of the muscles of the foot or calf of the leg may occur.\r\nContractures of the muscles of the upper extremity are more rare.\r\nMuscular atrophy of the leg muscles is often marked. In the upper\r\nextremity the muscles of the hand are most frequently atrophied.\r\n\r\n_Pellagra._—There is considerable variation from time to time in the\r\nreflexes. Some authorities attach diagnostic value to the appearance\r\nof an exaggerated reflex on one side and a diminution or absence\r\nof the corresponding reflex on the other side. Ankle clonus may be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n  Paraesthesias and in particular a burning sensation of the\r\n  erythematous areas are often noted. Hyperaesthesia of the dorsal\r\n  and lumbar regions is often noted. Pruritus is at times complained\r\n  of in the region of the perineum. We have muscular weakness.\r\n\r\n_Sleeping Sickness._—The deep reflexes are usually exaggerated and\r\nthe superficial ones diminished or absent.\r\n\r\n  There is no distinct alteration of motor or sensory function except\r\n  that of deep hyperaesthesia (Kérandel’s sign). There is usually\r\n  marked weakness of muscles of locomotion.\r\n\r\n_Leprosy._—The usual statement is that there is an exaggeration of\r\nthe deep reflexes. Ankle clonus has been rarely reported.\r\n\r\n  Anaesthesia is the most important symptom in the diagnosis of\r\n  leprosy. This loss of sensation is often for pain and temperature\r\n  with retention of tactile sense (dissociation of sensation—a\r\n  prominent symptom of syringomyelia). The anaesthesia is not only\r\n  found in the spots but associated with the leprous neuritis which\r\n  chiefly involves the ulnar, facial and peroneal nerves. Muscle\r\n  palsies and atrophies are common and the main-en-griffe appearance\r\n  of the hand is seen.\r\n\r\n  In _lathryism_ we have spasticity and an exaggeration of the\r\n  reflexes.\r\n\r\n  A very remarkable disease called _kubisagari_ or _paralytic\r\n  vertigo_ has been observed in Japan. This disease is thought to\r\n  affect those living in stables. The attacks only last a few minutes\r\n  and at other times the patient seems normal. An attack shows ptosis\r\n  and diplopia, speech disturbances and palsy of muscles of back of\r\n  neck, causing the head to fall forward. There may also be some\r\n  paresis of muscles of extremities. The disease is not fatal. Cases\r\n  have been observed in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAIT\r\n\r\nThere are no gaits in tropical diseases which can strictly speaking\r\nbe regarded as special types of gait. In beriberi we often note the\r\ndesignation _tripod gait_ of _beriberi_. This simply refers to the\r\nmanner in which a case of the paraplegic type of beriberi uses a\r\nstick held by his hands to assist him in dragging along his atrophied\r\nand enfeebled legs. The legs are widely separated and the stick\r\nplaced in front makes the two legs and stick resemble a tripod.\r\n\r\n  It is true that beriberics show the steppage gait of multiple\r\n  neuritis as, owing to more or less foot-drop and lack of power to\r\n  extend the toes, the patient lifts his foot high from the ground to\r\n  avoid scraping the toes, and bends to the other side. It is as if a\r\n  man were walking through a mire.\r\n\r\n  When other groups of muscles than the foot extensor ones become\r\n  involved the gait is that of extreme weakness—a shuffling one.\r\n\r\nIn _sleeping sickness_ it is a shuffling gait. It is as if one were\r\ndragging the feet along from pure muscular weakness.\r\n\r\nIn _pellagra_ we may see a gait in which the patient separates his\r\nlegs rather widely and uses a stick in front, shuffling his feet\r\nalong with knees slightly bent and soles of the feet scarcely raised\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nSome cases show a typical spastic paralytic gait.\r\n\r\n  We often note under _dengue_ the designation dandyfied gait. This\r\n  refers to the stilted, mincing gait of a dandy and is probably the\r\n  explanation of the derivation of the word dengue. The pains about\r\n  the site of the insertions of muscles with the slightest movement\r\n  make these patients walk in a stiff, self-conscious manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHIC AND NEURASTHENIC STATES\r\n\r\nA very remarkable fact is that in many tropical and subtropical\r\nregions where syphilis is rampant among the natives there is slight\r\nor absent incidence of general paresis and locomotor ataxia.\r\n\r\n  Jefferys and Maxwell state that the parasyphilitic manifestations\r\n  were absent in thousands of cases observed by them in Formosa.\r\n  In the Philippines one sees occasionally typical cases of these\r\n  parasyphilitic diseases but of course standard methods of treatment\r\n  of syphilis have been employed there for many years.\r\n\r\n  In China, where there is practically no treatment for syphilis,\r\n  luetic ulcerations are exceedingly common and it has been suggested\r\n  that insufficient treatment cures the skin lesions but adds to\r\n  the effects on the nervous system. It will be remembered that\r\n  skin and nerve tissue arise from similar embryological layers\r\n  (epiblast) hence a suppression of toxic effect on one tissue may\r\n  add to the burden on the other. It has been suggested that if the\r\n  surface lesions are allowed to develop to maturity, the skin,\r\n  which is the great elaborating center for antibodies, will produce\r\n  enough adequately to protect the whole body; whereas, if the\r\n  surface lesions are aborted, there is a diminished stimulus with\r\n  consequent diminished elaboration of protective bodies. The brain\r\n  is then liable to parenchymal invasion, since chemicals, owing to\r\n  difference in their physical properties, cannot replace natural\r\n  antibodies in controlling the disease in this location. This theory\r\n  takes no reckoning of differences exhibited by variant strains of\r\n  treponema in their tendencies toward selective localization. It has\r\n  been noted that the form of syphilis endemic in certain regions is\r\n  much less virulent than is the cosmopolitan form.\r\n\r\n_Pellagra._—Very important in diagnosis is a more or less\r\nprolonged prodromal period of neurasthenia which is apt to be more\r\nmarked in the winter at a time when the skin and alimentary tract\r\nmanifestations are in abeyance. Along with the anxiety and unrest of\r\nthis neurasthenia we have lack of mental concentration and depression\r\nof spirits.\r\n\r\n  A melancholic state is almost always present in the psychosis\r\n  of pellagra. There is not the indifferent, satisfied, more or\r\n  less happy mental state of the case of general paresis. Some\r\n  consider the pellagrous psychosis to belong to the toxic group,\r\n  as from alcohol or cocaine, while others place it in the group of\r\n  infective psychoses, as the post-influenzal one. Gregor regards it\r\n  as belonging to the infective-exhaustive group. The insanity of\r\n  pellagra is that of an acute confusional one.\r\n\r\n  In the final cachexia there is a dementia.\r\n\r\n_Sleeping Sickness._—It may be many months or even years before the\r\nmental changes follow the trypanosome fever stage. At first a change\r\nin disposition is noted, the patient becoming listless and apathetic.\r\n\r\n  There is great impairment of mental concentration and memory. There\r\n  may be later on catatonic manifestations as echolalia, mutism or\r\n  flexibilitas cerea. There may at times be paranoid manifestations\r\n  to be succeeded by states of profound melancholia. In the terminal\r\n  stage a comatose state overshadows the psychical manifestations.\r\n\r\n_Malaria._—Leaving out of account the acute delirious states which\r\naccompany cerebral malaria there have been reported cases showing\r\nvarious manifestations of psychic disturbances even to maniacal or\r\nmelancholic forms of insanity.\r\n\r\n  It is a common practice to attribute the irritability and lack of\r\n  mental concentration of those who have lived for a long time in\r\n  the tropics to the damage done the cerebral cortex by the malarial\r\n  parasite. It is certainly more reasonable to attribute these minor\r\n  psychic disturbances to malaria rather than to actinic rays of the\r\n  sun.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that quinine, given either for treatment or\r\nprophylaxis of malaria, is a cause as potent as alcohol and tobacco\r\nin tropical neurasthenia.\r\n\r\n_Insolation._—It is popular to assign neurasthenic manifestations to\r\nthe actinic rays of the sun or the tropical heat, as these influences\r\noperate on every resident of the tropics. It is very necessary to\r\nexclude derangements of the digestion due to errors in diet with\r\nresulting exhaustion of the pancreatic and hepatic functions.\r\n\r\n  Alcohol is a potent factor for tropical neurasthenia as the\r\n  tendency is for excess in this direction in those who in temperate\r\n  climates are only moderate drinkers.\r\n\r\n_Hookworm Disease._—The patients with this disease are apt to become\r\nhypochondriacal and even melancholic.\r\n\r\n  There is a correspondence between the physical and mental\r\n  backwardness of children with this disease, a child of twelve, who\r\n  by the Binet-Simon test will only be rated at 7 will also not seem\r\n  larger or better developed physically than a child of seven years\r\n  would be.\r\n\r\n_Malta Fever._—Owing to the neuralgic pains and insomnia patients\r\nwith this disease are apt to become neurasthenic. They are peculiarly\r\nliable to form the morphine habit if this drug be placed in their\r\nhands for the relief of pain.\r\n\r\n  The victims of _leprosy_ not only may show an indifference to their\r\n  condition but may also exhibit a moral apathy.\r\n\r\n_Dengue_ often shows a rather marked neurasthenia during\r\nconvalescence and this may be protracted if the patient tries to\r\nresume his active duties before his complete recovery.\r\n\r\nIn _latah_ there is echolalia and echopraxia, the patient repeating\r\nwords he hears and mimicking movements he sees. The mind is usually\r\nclear. As a matter of fact the symptoms show similarity to those of\r\nthe catatonic form of dementia praecox. The disease is more common in\r\nthat part of the world centering in the Malay peninsula. Suggestion\r\nis an important factor in this neurosis.\r\n\r\n  In _amok_, a sort of epileptiform seizure in which the patient is\r\n  obsessed with a desire to kill, there may be no recollection of the\r\n  running amok. After the attack the patient may be stuporous.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNACY IN THE TROPICS\r\n\r\nVan Loon, having examined over 200 cases from among 1100 insane\r\npatients in Java, found the most common types of mental disease to be\r\ndementia praecox, general paresis, various manifestations of cerebral\r\nsyphilis and acute maniacal or confusional states. Not only were all\r\nforms of mental disorder known in European countries represented,\r\nbut their comparative frequency and the types of conduct exhibited\r\nwere, on the whole, what might be expected in the study of a group of\r\nsimilar cases encountered in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\n  Overbeck-Wright in his book—“Lunacy in India”—notes that 44% of\r\n  cases were under treatment for various types of mania, 15.9% for\r\n  melancholia, 4.8% for delusional insanity, 5.2% for idiocy, 5.7%\r\n  for dementia and 6.6% for insanity following the use of _Cannabis\r\n  indica_. It is noted that dementia praecox is not included in the\r\n  statistical returns, but the author states that in his experience\r\n  hebephrenia and katatonia account for a much larger proportion of\r\n  cases than melancholia.\r\n\r\n  Overbeck-Wright is of the opinion that general paresis is quite\r\n  common in India notwithstanding the fact that for many years the\r\n  opinion has obtained that syphilis of the central nervous system\r\n  and the parasyphilitic diseases were exceedingly rare among\r\n  tropical natives. He regards the incidence of cerebral disease\r\n  in syphilitic natives as less than with Europeans, attributing\r\n  this fact to the existence of an immunity acquired through the\r\n  prevalence of syphilis among these people during a period of\r\n  several centuries. Cases of general paresis are generally reported\r\n  under the diagnosis of chronic mania.\r\n\r\n  Van Loon also notes the mistake made in most books on tropical\r\n  medicine as to the rarity of general paresis. General paresis\r\n  being a disease in which we have such characteristic laboratory\r\n  diagnostic tests, especially the colloidal gold test, there should\r\n  be little difficulty in settling this question of its absence or\r\n  relative infrequency among natives of tropical regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acanthocheilonema perstans, 339\r\n\r\n  Acidosis, 525\r\n    in
