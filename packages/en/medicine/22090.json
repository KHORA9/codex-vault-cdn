There can,\r\ntherefore, be no study more widely important or more generally\r\ninteresting. I fear, however, that by many persons social hygiene is\r\nvaguely regarded either as a mere extension of sanitary science, or else\r\nas an effort to set up an intolerable bureaucracy to oversee every\r\naction of our lives, and perhaps even to breed us as cattle are bred.\r\n\r\nThat is certainly not the point of view from which this book has been\r\nwritten. Plato and Rabelais, Campanella and More, have been among those\r\nwho announced the principles of social hygiene here set forth. There\r\nmust be a social order, all these great pioneers recognized, but the\r\nhealth of society, like the health of the body, is marked by expansion\r\nas much as by restriction, and, the striving for order is only justified\r\nbecause without order there can be no freedom. If it were not the\r\nmission of social hygiene to bring a new joy and a new freedom into life\r\nI should not have concerned myself with the writing of this book.\r\n\r\nWhen we thus contemplate the process of social hygiene, we are no longer\r\nin danger of looking upon it as an artificial interference with Nature.\r\nIt is in the Book of Nature, as Campanella put it, that the laws of\r\nlife and of government are to be read. Or, as Quesnel said two centuries\r\nago, more precisely for our present purpose, \"Nature is universal\r\nhygiene.\" All animals are scrupulous in hygiene; the elaboration of\r\nhygiene moves _pari passu_ with the rank of a species in intelligence.\r\nEven the cockroach, which lives on what we call filth, spends the\r\ngreater part of its time in the cultivation of personal cleanliness. And\r\nall social hygiene, in its fullest sense, is but an increasingly complex\r\nand extended method of purification--the purification of the conditions\r\nof life by sound legislation, the purification of our own minds by\r\nbetter knowledge, the purification of our hearts by a growing sense of\r\nresponsibility, the purification of the race itself by an enlightened\r\neugenics, consciously aiding Nature in her manifest effort to embody new\r\nideals of life. It was not Man, but Nature, who realized the daring and\r\nsplendid idea--risky as it was--of placing the higher anthropoids on\r\ntheir hind limbs and so liberating their fore-limbs in the service of\r\ntheir nimble and aspiring brains. We may humbly follow in the same path,\r\nliberating latent forces of life and suppressing those which no longer\r\nserve the present ends of life. For, as Shakespeare said, when in _The\r\nWinter's Tale_ he set forth a luminous philosophy of social hygiene and\r\napplied it to eugenics,\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"Nature is made better by no mean\r\n    But Nature makes that mean ...\r\n                          This is an art\r\n    Which does mend Nature, change it rather, but\r\n    The art itself is Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn whatever way it may be understood, however, social hygiene is now very\r\nmuch to the front of people's minds. The present volume, I wish to make\r\nclear, has not been hastily written to meet any real or supposed demand.\r\nIt has slowly grown during a period of nearly twenty-five years, and it\r\nexpresses an attitude which is implicit or explicit in the whole of my\r\nwork. By some readers, doubtless, it will be seen to constitute an\r\nextension in various directions of the arguments developed in the larger\r\nwork on \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" which is the final volume of my\r\n_Studies in the Psychology of Sex_. The book I now bring forward may,\r\nhowever, be more properly regarded as a presentation of the wider scheme\r\nof social reform out of which the more special sex studies have\r\ndeveloped. We are faced to-day by the need for vast and complex changes\r\nin social organization. In these changes the welfare of individuals and\r\nthe welfare of communities are alike concerned. Moreover, they are\r\nmatters which are not confined to the affairs of this nation or of that\r\nnation, but of the whole family of nations participating in the\r\nfraternity of modern progress.\r\n\r\nThe word \"progress,\" indeed, which falls so easily from our lips is not\r\na word which any serious writer should use without precaution. The\r\nconception of \"progress\" is a useful conception in so far as it binds\r\ntogether those who are working for common ends, and stimulates that\r\nperpetual slight movement in which life consists. But there is no\r\ngeneral progress in Nature, nor any unqualified progress; that is to\r\nsay, that there is no progress for all groups along the line, and that\r\neven those groups which progress pay the price of their progress. It was\r\nso even when our anthropoid ancestors rose to the erect position; that\r\nwas \"progress,\" and it gained us the use of hands. But it lost us our\r\ntails, and much else that is more regrettable than we are always able to\r\nrealize. There is no general and ever-increasing evolution towards\r\nperfection. \"Existence is realized in its perfection under whatever\r\naspect it is manifested,\" says Jules de Gaultier. Or, as Whitman put it,\r\n\"There will never be any more perfection than there is now.\" We cannot\r\nexpect an increased power of growth and realization in existence, as a\r\nwhole, leading to any general perfection; we can only expect to see the\r\ntriumph of individuals, or of groups of individuals, carrying out their\r\nown conceptions along special lines, every perfection so attained\r\ninvolving, on its reverse side, the acquirement of an imperfection. It\r\nis in this sense, and in this sense only, that progress is possible. We\r\nneed not fear that we shall ever achieve the stagnant immobility of a\r\ngeneral perfection.\r\n\r\nThe problems of progress we are here concerned with are such as the\r\ncivilized world, as represented by some of its foremost individuals or\r\ngroups of individuals, is just now waking up to grapple with. No doubt\r\nother problems might be added, and the addition give a greater semblance\r\nof completion to this book. I have selected those which seem to me very\r\nessential, very fundamental. The questions of social hygiene, as here\r\nunderstood, go to the heart of life. It is the task of this hygiene not\r\nonly to make sewers, but to re-make love, and to do both in the same\r\nlarge spirit of human fellowship, to ensure finer individual development\r\nand a larger social organization. At the one end social hygiene may be\r\nregarded as simply the extension of an elementary sanitary code; at the\r\nother end it seems to some to have in it the glorious freedom of a new\r\nreligion. The majority of people, probably, will be content to admit\r\nthat we have here a scheme of serious social reform which every man and\r\nwoman will soon be called upon to take some share in.\r\n\r\nHAVELOCK ELLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--INTRODUCTION\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\nThe aim of Social Hygiene--Social

here understood, may be said to be a\r\ndevelopment, and even a transformation, of what was formerly known as\r\nSocial Reform. In that transformation it has undergone two fundamental\r\nchanges. In the first place, it is no longer merely an attempt to deal\r\nwith the conditions under which life is lived, seeking to treat bad\r\nconditions as they occur, without going to their source, but it aims at\r\nprevention. It ceases to be simply a reforming of forms, and approaches\r\nin a comprehensive manner not only the conditions of life, but life\r\nitself. In the second place, its method is no longer haphazard, but\r\norganized and systematic, being based on a growing knowledge of those\r\nbiological sciences which were scarcely in their infancy when the era of\r\nsocial reform began. Thus social hygiene is at once more radical and\r\nmore scientific than the old conception of social reform. It is the\r\ninevitable method by which at a certain stage civilization is compelled\r\nto continue its own course, and to preserve, perhaps to elevate, the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe era of social reform followed on the rise of modern industrialism,\r\nand, no doubt largely on this account, although an international\r\nmovement, it first became definite and self-conscious in England. There\r\nwere perhaps other reasons why it should have been in the first place\r\nspecially prominent in England. When at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Muralt, a highly intelligent Swiss gentleman, visited England,\r\nand wrote his by no means unsympathetic _Lettres sur les Anglais_, he\r\nwas struck by a curious contradiction in the English character. They are\r\na good-natured people, he observed, very rich, so well-nourished that\r\nsometimes they die of obesity, and they detest cruelty so much that by\r\nroyal proclamation it is ordained that the fish and the ducks of the\r\nponds should be duly and properly fed. Yet he found that this\r\ngood-natured, rich, cruelty-hating nation systematically allowed the\r\nprisoners in their gaols to die of starvation. \"The great cruelty of\r\nthe English,\" Muralt remarks, \"lies in permitting evil rather than in\r\ndoing it.\"[1] The root of the apparent contradiction lay clearly in a\r\nsomewhat excessive independence and devotion to liberty. We give a man\r\nfull liberty, they seem to have said, to work, to become rich, to grow\r\nfat. But if he will not work, let him starve. In that point of view\r\nthere were involved certain fallacies, which became clearer during the\r\ncourse of social evolution.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious, indeed, that such an attitude, while highly favourable\r\nto individual vigour and independence, and not incompatible with fairly\r\nhealthy social life under the conditions which prevailed at the time,\r\nbecame disastrous in the era of industrialism. The conditions of\r\nindustrial life tore up the individual from the roots by which he\r\nnormally received strength, and crowded the workers together in masses,\r\nthus generating a confusion which no individual activity could grapple\r\nwith. So it was that the very spirit which, under the earlier\r\nconditions, made for good now made for evil. To stand by and applaud the\r\nefforts of the individual who was perhaps slowly sinking deeper and\r\ndeeper into a miry slough of degradation began to seem an even\r\ndiabolical attitude. The maxim of _laissez-faire_, which had once stood\r\nfor the whole unfettered action of natural activities in life, began to\r\nbe viewed with horror and contempt. It was realized that there must be\r\nan intelligent superintendence of social conditions, humane regulation,\r\nsystematic organization. The very intensity of the evils which the\r\nEnglish spirit produced led to a reaction by which that spirit, while\r\ndoubtless remaining the same at heart, took on a different form, and\r\nmanifested its energy in a new direction.\r\n\r\nThe modern industrial era, replacing domestic industry by collective\r\nwork carried out by \"hands\" in factories, began in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The era of social reform was delayed until the second quarter\r\nof the nineteenth century. It has proceeded by four successively\r\nprogressive stages, each stage supplementing, rather than supplanting,\r\nthe stage that preceded it. In 1842 Sir Edwin Chadwick wrote an official\r\nReport on the _Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great\r\nBritain_, in which was clearly presented for the first time a vivid,\r\ncomprehensive, and authoritative picture of the incredibly filthy\r\nconditions under which the English labouring classes lived. The times\r\nwere ripe for this Report. It attracted public attention, and exerted an\r\nimportant influence. Its appearance marks the first stage of social\r\nreform, which was mainly a sanitary effort to clear away the gross filth\r\nfrom our cities, to look after the cleansing, lighting, and policing of\r\nthe streets, to create a drainage system, to improve dwellings, and in\r\nthese ways to combat disease and to lower the very high death-rate.\r\n\r\nAt an early stage, however, it began to be seen that this process of\r\nsanitation, necessary as it had become, was far too crude and elementary\r\nto achieve the ends sought. It was not enough to improve the streets, or\r\neven to regulate the building of dwellings. It was clearly necessary to\r\nregulate also the conditions of work of the people who lived in those\r\nstreets and dwellings. Thus it was that the scheme of factory\r\nlegislation was initiated. Rules were made as to the hours of labour,\r\nmore especially as regards women and children, for whom, moreover,\r\ncertain specially dangerous or unhealthy occupations were forbidden, and\r\nan increasingly large number of avocations were brought under Government\r\ninspection. This second stage of social reform encountered a much more\r\nstrenuous opposition than the first stage. The regulation of the order\r\nand cleanliness of the streets was obviously necessary, and it had\r\nindeed been more or less enforced even in medieval times;[2] but the\r\nregulation of the conditions of work in the interests of the worker was\r\na more novel proceeding, and it appeared to clash both with the\r\ninterests of the employers and the ancient principles of English freedom\r\nand independence, behind which the employers consequently sheltered\r\nthemselves. The early attempts to legislate on these lines were thus\r\nfruitless. It was not until a distinguished aristocratic philanthropist\r\nof great influence, the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, took up the\r\nquestion, that factory legislation began to be accepted. It continues to\r\ndevelop even to-day, ever enlarging the sphere of its action, and now\r\nmeeting with no opposition. But, in England, at all events, its\r\nacceptance marks a memorable stage in the growth of the national spirit.\r\nIt was no longer easy and natural for the Englishmen to look on at\r\nsuffering without interference. It began to be recognized that it was\r\nperfectly legitimate, and even necessary, to put a curb on the freedom\r\nand independence which involved suffering to others.\r\n\r\nBut as the era of factory legislation became established, a further\r\nadvance was seen to be necessary. Factory legislation had forbidden the\r\nchild to work. But the duty of the community towards the child, the\r\ncitizen of the future, was evidently by no means covered by this purely\r\nnegative step. The child must be prepared to take his future part in\r\nlife, in the first place by education. The nationalization of education\r\nin England dates from 1870. But during the subsequent half century\r\n\"education\" has come to mean much more than mere instruction; it now\r\ncovers a certain amount of provision for meals when necessary, the\r\nenforcement of cleanliness, the care of defective conditions, inborn or\r\nacquired, with special treatment for mentally defective children, an\r\never-increasing amount of medical inspection and supervision, while it\r\nis beginning to include arrangements for placing the child in work\r\nsuited to his capacities when he leaves school.\r\n\r\nDuring the past ten years the movement of social reform has entered a\r\nfourth stage. The care of the child during his school-days was seen to\r\nbe insufficient; it began too late, when probably the child's fate for\r\nlife was already decided. It was necessary to push the process further\r\nback, to birth and even to the stage before birth, by directing social\r\ncare to the infant, and by taking thought of the mother. This\r\nconsideration has led to a whole series of highly important and fruitful\r\nmeasures which are only beginning to develop, although they have already\r\nproved very beneficial. The immediate notification to the authorities of\r\na child's birth, and the institution of Health Visitors to ascertain\r\nwhat is being done for the infant's well-being, and to aid the mother\r\nwith advice, have certainly been a large factor in the recent reduction\r\nin the infantile death-rate in England.[3]\r\n\r\nThe care of the infant has indeed now become a new applied science, the\r\nscience of puericulture. Professor Budin of Paris may fairly be regarded\r\nas the founder of puericulture by the establishment in Paris, in 1892,\r\nof Infant Consultations, to which mothers were encouraged to bring their\r\nbabies to be weighed and examined, any necessary advice being given\r\nregarding the care of the baby. The mothers are persuaded to suckle\r\ntheir infants if possible, and if their own health permits. For the\r\ncases in which suckling is undesirable or impossible, Budin established\r\nMilk Depots, where pure milk is supplied at a low price or freely.\r\nInfant Consultations and Milk Depots are now becoming common everywhere.\r\nA little later than Budin, another distinguished French physician,\r\nPinard, carried puericulture a step further back, but a very important\r\nstep, by initiating a movement for the care of the pregnant woman.\r\nPinard and his pupils have shown by a number of detailed investigations\r\nthat the children born to working mothers who rest during the last three\r\nmonths of pregnancy, are to a marked extent larger and finer than the\r\nchildren of those mothers who enjoy no such period of rest, even though\r\nthe mothers themselves may be equally robust and healthy in both cases.\r\nMoreover, it is found that premature birth, one of the commonest\r\naccidents of modern life, tends to be prevented by such rest. The\r\nchildren of mothers who rest enjoy on the average three weeks longer\r\ndevelopment in the womb than the children of the mothers who do not\r\nrest, and this prolonged ante-natal development cannot fail to be a\r\nbenefit for the whole of the child's subsequent life. The movement\r\nstarted by Pinard, though strictly a continuation of the great movement\r\nfor the improvement of the conditions of life, takes us as far back as\r\nwe are able to go on these lines, and has in it the promise of an\r\nimmense benefit to human efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the movement of puericulture initiated by Budin and\r\nPinard must be mentioned the institution of Schools for Mothers, for it\r\nis closely associated with the aims of puericulture. The School for\r\nMothers arose in Belgium, a little later than the activities of Budin\r\nand Pinard commenced. About 1900 a young Socialist doctor of Ghent, Dr.\r\nMiele, started the first school of this kind, with girls of from twelve\r\nto sixteen years of age as students and assistants. The School\r\neventually included as many as twelve different services, among these\r\nbeing dispensaries for mothers, a mothers' friendly society, milk depots\r\nboth for babies and nursing mothers, health talks to mothers with\r\ndemonstrations, courses on puericulture (including anatomy, physiology,\r\npreparation of foods, weighing, etc.) to girls between fourteen and\r\neighteen, who afterwards become eligible for appointment as paid\r\nassistants.[4] In 1907 Schools for Mothers were introduced into England,\r\nat first under the auspices of Dr. Sykes, Medical Officer of Health for\r\nSt. Pancras, London. Such Schools are now spreading everywhere. In the\r\nend they will probably be considered necessary centres for any national\r\nsystem of puericulture. Every girl at the end of her school life should\r\nbe expected to pass through a certain course of training at a School for\r\nMothers. It would be the technical school for the working-class mother,\r\nwhile such a course would be invaluable for any girl, whatever her\r\nsocial class, even if she is never called to be a mother herself or to\r\nhave the care of children.\r\n\r\nThe great movement of social reform during the nineteenth century, we\r\nthus see, has moved in four stages, each of which has reinforced rather\r\nthan replaced that which went before: (1) the effort to cleanse the\r\ngross filth of cities and to remedy obvious disorder by systematic\r\nattention to scavenging, drainage, the supply of water and of artificial\r\nlight, as well as by improved policing; (2) the great system of factory\r\nlegislation for regulating the conditions of work, and to some extent\r\nrestraining the work of women and of children; (3) the introduction of\r\nnational systems of education, and the gradual extension of the idea of\r\neducation to cover far more than mere instruction; and (4), most\r\nfundamental of all and last to appear, the effort to guard the child\r\nbefore the school age, even at birth, even before birth, by bestowing\r\ndue care on the future mother.[5]\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out that this movement of practical social reform has\r\nbeen accompanied, stimulated, and guided by a corresponding movement in\r\nthe sciences which in their application are indispensable to the\r\nprogress of civilized social reform. There has been a process of mutual\r\naction and reaction between science and practice. The social movement\r\nhas stimulated the development of abstract science, and the new progress\r\nin science has enabled further advances to be made in social practice.\r\nThe era of expansion in sanitation was the era of development in\r\nchemistry and physics, which alone enabled a sound system of sanitation\r\nto be developed. The fight against disease would have been impossible\r\nbut for bacteriology. The new care for human life, and for the\r\nprotection of its source, is associated with fresh developments of\r\nbiological science. Sociological observations and speculation, including\r\neconomics, are intimately connected with the efforts of social reform to\r\nattain a broad, sound, and truly democratic basis.[6]\r\n\r\nWhen we survey this movement as a whole, we have to recognize that it is\r\nexclusively concerned with the improvement of the conditions of life. It\r\nmakes no attempt to influence either the quantity or the quality of\r\nlife.[7] It may sometimes have been carried out with the assumption that\r\nto improve the conditions of life is, in some way or other, to improve\r\nthe quality of life itself. But it accepted the stream of life as it\r\nfound it, and while working to cleanse the banks of the stream it made\r\nno attempt to purify the stream itself.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that the arguments which, especially\r\nnowadays, are brought against the social reform of the condition of\r\nlife, will not bear serious examination. It is said, for instance, or at\r\nall events implied, that we need bestow very little care on the\r\nconditions of life because such care can have no permanently beneficial\r\neffect on the race, since acquired characters, for the most part, are\r\nnot transmitted to descendants. But to assume that social reform is\r\nunnecessary because it is not inherited is altogether absurd. The people\r\nwho make this assumption would certainly not argue that it is useless\r\nfor them to satisfy their own hunger and thirst, because their children\r\nwill not thereby be safeguarded from experiencing hunger and thirst. Yet\r\nthe needs which the movement of organized social reform seeks to satisfy\r\nare precisely on a level with, and indeed to some extent identical with,\r\nthe needs of hunger and thirst. The impulse and the duty which move\r\nevery civilized community to elaborate and gratify its own social needs\r\nto the utmost are altogether independent of the race, and would not\r\ncease to exist even in a community vowed to celibacy or the most\r\nabsolute Neo-Malthusianism. Nor, again, must it be said that social\r\nreform destroys the beneficial results of natural selection.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, we encounter a disputed point, and it may be admitted that\r\nthe precise data for absolute demonstration in one direction or the\r\nother cannot yet be found. Whenever human beings breed in reckless and\r\nunrestrained profusion--as is the case under some conditions before a\r\nfree and self-conscious civilization is attained--there is an immense\r\ninfantile mortality. It is claimed, on the one hand, that this is\r\nbeneficial, and need not be interfered with. The weak are killed off,\r\nit is said, and the strong survive; there is a process of natural\r\nsurvival of the fittest. That is true. But it is equally true, as has\r\nalso been clearly seen on the other hand, that though the relatively\r\nstrongest survive, their relative strength has been impaired by the very\r\ninfluences which have proved altogether fatal to their weaker brethren.\r\nThere is an immense infantile mortality in Russia. Yet, notwithstanding\r\nany resulting \"survival of the fittest,\" Russia is far more ravaged by\r\ndisease than Norway, where infantile mortality is low. \"A high infantile\r\nmortality,\" as George Carpenter, a great authority on the diseases of\r\nchildhood, remarks, \"denotes a far higher infantile deterioration rate\";\r\nor, as another doctor puts it, \"the dead baby is next of kin to the\r\ndiseased baby,\" The protection of the weak, so frequently condemned by\r\nsome Neo-Darwinians, is thus in reality, as Goldscheid terms it, \"the\r\nprotection of the strong from degeneration.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, however, more to be said. Not only must an undue struggle with\r\nunfavourable conditions enfeeble the strong as well as kill the feeble;\r\nit also imposes an intolerable burden upon these enfeebled survivors.\r\nThe process of destruction is not sudden, it is gradual. It is a\r\nlong-drawn-out process. It involves the multiplication of the diseased,\r\nthe maimed, the feeble-minded, of paupers and lunatics and criminals.\r\nEven natural selection thus includes the need for protecting the feeble,\r\nand so renders urgent the task of social reform, while the more\r\nthoroughly this task is carried out with the growth of civilization,\r\nthe more stupendous and overwhelming the task becomes.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that civilization, at a certain point in its course, renders\r\ninevitable the appearance of that wider and deeper organization of life\r\nwhich in the present volume we are concerned with under the name of\r\nSocial Hygiene. That movement is far from being an abrupt or\r\nrevolutionary manifestation in the ordinary progress of social growth.\r\nAs we have seen, social reform during the past eighty years may be said\r\nto have proceeded in four successive stages, each of which has involved\r\na nearer approach to the sources of life. The fourth stage, which in its\r\nbeginnings dates only from the last years of the nineteenth century,\r\ntakes us to the period before birth, and is concerned with the care of\r\nthe child in the mother's womb. The next stage cannot fail to take us to\r\nthe very source of life itself, lifting us beyond the task of purifying\r\nthe conditions, and laying on us the further task of regulating the\r\nquantity and raising the quality of life at its very source. The duty of\r\npurifying, ordering, and consolidating the banks of the stream must\r\nstill remain.[8] But when we are able to control the stream at its\r\nsource we are able to some extent to prevent the contamination of that\r\nstream by filth, and ensure that its muddy floods shall not sweep away\r\nthe results of our laborious work on the banks. Our sense of social\r\nresponsibility is developing into a sense of racial responsibility, and\r\nthat development is expressed in the nature of the tasks of Social\r\nHygiene which now lie before us.\r\n\r\nIt is the control of the reproduction of the race which renders possible\r\nthe new conception of Social Hygiene. We have seen that the gradual\r\nprocess of social reform during the first three quarters of the\r\nnineteenth century, by successive stages of movement towards the sources\r\nof life, finally reached the moment of conception. The first result of\r\nreform at this point was that procreation became a deliberate act. Up\r\ntill then the method of propagating the race was the same as that which\r\nsavages have carried on during thousands of years, the chief difference\r\nbeing that whereas savages have frequently sought to compensate their\r\nrecklessness by destroying their inferior offspring, we had accepted all\r\nthe offspring, good, bad, and indifferent, produced by our\r\nindiscriminate recklessness, shielding ourselves by a false theology.\r\nChildren \"came,\" and their parents disclaimed all responsibility for\r\ntheir coming. The children were \"sent by God,\" and if they all turned\r\nout to be idiots, the responsibility was God's. But when it became\r\ngenerally realized that it was possible to limit offspring without\r\ninterfering with conjugal life a step of immense importance was\r\nachieved. It became clear to all that the Divine force works through us,\r\nand that we are not entitled to cast the burden of our evil actions on\r\nany Higher Power. Marriage no longer fatally involved an endless\r\nprocession of children who, in so far as they survived at all, were in a\r\nlarge number of cases doomed to disease, neglect, misery, and ignorance.\r\nThe new Social Hygiene was for the first time rendered possible.\r\n\r\nIt was in France during the first half of the nineteenth century that\r\nthe control of reproduction first began to become a social habit. In\r\nSweden and in Denmark, the fall in the birth-rate, though it has been\r\nirregular, may be said to have begun in 1860. It was not until about the\r\nyear 1876 that, in so far as we may judge by the arrest of the\r\nbirth-rate, the movement began to spread to Europe generally. In England\r\nit is usual to associate this change with a famous prosecution which\r\nbrought a knowledge of the means of preventing conception to the whole\r\npopulation of Great Britain. Undoubtedly this prosecution was an\r\nimportant factor in the movement, but we cannot doubt that, even if the\r\nprosecution had not taken place, the course of social progress must\r\nstill have pursued the same course. It is noteworthy that it was about\r\nthis same period, in various European countries, that the tide turned,\r\nand the excessively high birth-rate began to fall.[9] Recklessness was\r\ngiving place to foresight and self-control. Such foresight and\r\nself-control are of the essence of civilization.[10]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be disputed that the transformation by which the propagation\r\nof the race became deliberate and voluntary has not been established in\r\nsocial custom without a certain amount of protestation from various\r\nsides. No social change, however beneficial, ever is established without\r\nsuch protestation, which may, therefore, be regarded as an inevitable\r\nand probably a salutary part of social change. Even some would-be\r\nscientific persons, with a display of elaborate statistics, set forth\r\nvarious alarmistic doctrines. If, said these persons, this new movement\r\ngoes on at the present pace, and if all other conditions remain\r\nunchanged, then all sorts of terrible results will ensue. But the\r\nalarming conclusion failed to ensue, and for a very sufficient reason.\r\nThe assumed premises of the argument were unsound. Nothing ever goes on\r\nat the same pace, nor do all other conditions ever remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe world is a living fire, as Heraclitus long ago put it. All things\r\nare in perpetual flux. Life is a process of perpetual movement. It is\r\nidle to bid the world stand still, and then to argue about the\r\nconsequences. The world will not stand still, it is for ever revolving,\r\nfor ever revealing some new facet that had not been allowed for in the\r\nneatly arranged mechanism of the statistician.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to dwell on a point which is now at last, one\r\nmay hope, becoming clear to most intelligent persons. But I may perhaps\r\nbe allowed to refer in passing to an argument that has been brought\r\nforward with the wearisome iteration which always marks the progress of\r\nthose who are feeble in argument. The good stocks of upper social class\r\nare decreasing in fertility, it is said; the bad stocks of lower social\r\nclass are not decreasing; therefore the bad stocks are tending to\r\nreplace the good stocks.[11]\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be pointed out that, even assuming that the facts are\r\nas stated; it is a hazardous assumption that the best stocks are\r\nnecessarily the stocks of high social class. In the main no doubt this\r\nis so, but good stocks are nevertheless so widely spread through all\r\nclasses--such good stocks in the lower social classes being probably the\r\nmost resistent to adverse conditions--that we are not entitled to regard\r\neven a slightly greater net increase of the lower social classes as an\r\nunmitigated evil. It may be that, as Mercier has expressed it, \"we have\r\nto regard a civilized community somewhat in the light of a lamp, which\r\nburns at the top and is replenished from the bottom.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe soundness of a stock, and its aptitude for performing efficiently\r\nthe functions of its own social sphere, cannot, indeed, be accurately\r\nmeasured by any tendency to rise into a higher social sphere. On the\r\nwhole, from generation to generation, the men of a good stock remain\r\nwithin their own social sphere, whether high or low, adequately\r\nperforming their functions in that sphere, from generation to\r\ngeneration. They remain, we may say, in that social stratum of which the\r\nspecific gravity is best suited for their existence.[13]\r\n\r\nYet, undoubtedly, from time to time, there is a slight upward social\r\ntendency, due in most cases to the exceptional energy and ability of\r\nsome individual who succeeds in permanently lifting his family into a\r\nslightly higher social stratum.[14] Such a process has always taken\r\nplace, in the past even more conspicuously than in the present. The\r\nNormans who came over to England with William the Conqueror and\r\nconstituted the proud English nobility were simply a miscellaneous set\r\nof adventurers, professional fighting men, of unknown, and no doubt for\r\nthe most part undistinguished, lineage. William the Conqueror himself\r\nwas the son of a woman of the people. The Catholic Church founded no\r\nfamilies, but its democratic constitution opened a career to men of all\r\nclasses, and the most brilliant sons of the Church were often of the\r\nlowliest social rank. We should not, therefore, say that the bad stocks\r\nare replacing the good stocks. There is not the slightest evidence for\r\nany such theory. All that we are entitled to say is that when in the\r\nupward progression of a community the vanishing point of culture and\r\nrefinement is attained the bearers of that culture and refinement die\r\noff as naturally and inevitably as flowers in autumn, and from their\r\nroots spring up new and more vigorous shoots to replace them and to pass\r\nin their turn through the same stages, with that perpetual slight\r\nnovelty in which lies the secret of life, as well as of art. An\r\naristocracy which is merely an aristocracy because it is \"old\"--whether\r\nit is an aristocracy of families, or of races, or of species--has\r\nalready ceased to be an aristocracy in any sound meaning of the term. We\r\nneed not regret its disappearance.\r\n\r\nDo not, therefore, let us waste our time in crying over the dead roses\r\nof the summer that is past. There is something morbid in the perpetual\r\ngroaning over that inevitable decay which is itself a part of all life.\r\nSuch a perpetual narrow insistence on one aspect of life is scarcely\r\nsane. One suspects that these people are themselves of those stocks over\r\nwhose fate they grieve. Let us, therefore, mercifully leave them to\r\nmanure their dead roses in peace. They will soon be forgotten. The world\r\nis for ever dying. The world is also for ever bursting with life. The\r\nspring song of _Sursum corda_ easily overwhelms the dying autumnal wails\r\nof the _Dies Irae_.\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that, even apart from any deliberate restraint from\r\nprocreation, as a family attains the highest culture and refinement\r\nwhich civilization can yield, that family tends to die out, at all\r\nevents in the male line.[15] This is, for instance, the result which\r\nFahlbeck has reached in his valuable demographic study of the Swedish\r\nnobility, _Der Adel Schwedens_. \"Apparently,\" says Fahlbeck, \"the\r\ngreater demands on nervous and intellectual force which the culture and\r\nrefinement of the upper classes produce are chiefly responsible for\r\nthis. For these are the two personal factors by which those classes are\r\ndistinguished from the lower classes: high education and refinement in\r\ntastes and habits. The first involves predominant activity of the brain,\r\nthe last a heightened sensitiveness in all departments of nervous life.\r\nIn both respects, therefore, there is increased work for the nervous\r\nsystem, and this is compensated in the other vital functions, especially\r\nreproduction. Man cannot achieve everything; what he gains on one side\r\nhe loses on the other.\" We should do well to hold these wise words in\r\nmind when we encounter those sciolists who in the presence of the finest\r\nand rarest manifestations of civilizations, can only talk of race\r\n\"decay.\" A female salmon, it is estimated, lays about nine hundred eggs\r\nfor every pound of her own weight, and she may weigh fifty pounds. The\r\nprogeny of Shakespeare and Goethe, such as it was, disappeared in the\r\nvery centuries in which these great men themselves died. At the present\r\nstage of civilization we are somewhat nearer to Shakespeare and Goethe\r\nthan to the salmon. We must set our ideals towards a very different\r\ndirection from that which commends itself to our Salmonidian sciolists.\r\n\"Increase and multiply\" was the legendary injunction uttered on the\r\nthreshold of an empty world. It is singularly out of place in an age in\r\nwhich the earth and the sea, if not indeed the very air, swarm with\r\ncountless myriads of undistinguished and indistinguishable human\r\ncreatures, until the beauty of the world is befouled and the glory of\r\nthe Heavens bedimmed. To stem back that tide is the task now imposed on\r\nour heroism, to elevate and purify and refine the race, to introduce\r\nthe ideal of quality in place of the ideal of quantity which has run\r\nriot so long, with the results we see. \"As the Northern Saga tells that\r\nOdin must sacrifice his eye to attain the higher wisdom,\" concludes\r\nFahlbeck, \"so Man also, in order to win the treasures of culture and\r\nrefinement, must give not only his eye but his life, if not his own life\r\nthat of his posterity.\"[16] The vulgar aim of reckless racial fertility\r\nis no longer within our reach and no longer commends itself as worthy.\r\nIt is not consonant with the stage of civilization we are at the moment\r\npassing through. The higher task is now ours of the regeneration of the\r\nrace, or, if we wish to express that betterment less questionably, the\r\naggeneration of the race.[17]\r\n\r\nThe control of reproduction, we see, essential as it is, cannot by\r\nitself carry far the betterment of the race, because it involves no\r\ndirect selection of stocks. Yet we have to remember that though this\r\ncontrol, with the limitation of offspring it involves, fails to answer\r\nall the demands which Social Hygiene to-day makes of us, it yet achieves\r\nmuch. It may not improve what we abstractly term the \"race,\" but it\r\nimmensely improves the individuals of which the race is made up. Thus\r\nthe limitation of the family renders it possible to avoid the production\r\nof undesired children. That in itself is an immense social gain, because\r\nit tends to abolish excessive infantile mortality.[18] It means that\r\nadequate care will be expended upon the children that are produced, and\r\nthat no children will be produced unless the parents are in a position\r\nto provide for them.[19] Even the mere spacing out of the children in a\r\nfamily, the larger interval between child-births, is a very great\r\nadvantage. The mother is no longer exhausted by perpetually bearing,\r\nsuckling, and tending babies, while the babies themselves are on the\r\naverage of better quality.[20] Thus the limitation of offspring, far from\r\nbeing an egoistic measure, as some have foolishly supposed, is\r\nimperatively demanded in the altruistic interests of the individuals\r\ncomposing the race.\r\n\r\nBut the control of reproduction, enormously beneficial as it is even in\r\nits most elementary shapes, mainly concerns us here because it furnishes\r\nthe essential condition for the development of Social Hygiene. The\r\ncontrol of reproduction renders possible, and leads on to, a wise\r\nselection in reproduction. It is only by such selection of children to\r\nbe born that we can balance our indiscriminate care in the preservation\r\nof all children that are born, a care which otherwise would become an\r\nintolerable burden. It is only by such selection that we can work\r\ntowards the elimination of those stocks which fail to help us in the\r\ntasks of our civilization to-day. It is only by such selection that we\r\ncan hope to fortify the stocks that are fitted for these tasks. More\r\nthan two centuries ago Steele playfully suggested that \"one might wear\r\nany passion out of a family by culture, as skilful gardeners blot a\r\ncolour out of a tulip that hurts its beauty.\"[21] The progress of\r\ncivilization, with the self-control it involves, has made it possible to\r\naccept this suggestion seriously.[22] The difference is that whereas the\r\nflowers of our gardens are bettered only by the control of an arbitrary\r\nexternal will and intelligence, our human flowers may be bettered by an\r\nintelligence and will, a finer sense of responsibility, developed within\r\nthemselves. Thus it is that human culture renders possible Social\r\nHygiene.\r\n\r\nThree centuries ago an inspired monk set forth his ideal of an ennobled\r\nworld in _The City of the Sun_. Campanella wrote that prophetic book in\r\nprison. But his spirit was unfettered, and his conception of human\r\nsociety, though in daring it outruns all the visions we may compare it\r\nwith, is yet on the lines along which our civilization lies. In the City\r\nof the Sun not only was the nobility of work, even mechanical\r\nwork,--which Plato rejected and More was scarcely conscious of,--for the\r\nfirst time recognized, but the supreme impulse of procreation was\r\nregarded as a sacred function, to be exercised in the light of\r\nscientific knowledge. It was a public rather than a private duty,\r\nbecause it concerned the interests of the race; only valorous and\r\nhigh-spirited men ought to procreate, and it was held that the father\r\nshould bear the punishments inflicted on the son for faults due to his\r\nfailure by defects in generation.[23] Moreover, while unions not for the\r\nend of procreation were in the City of the Sun left to the judgment of\r\nthe individuals alone concerned, it was not so with unions for the end\r\nof procreation. These were arranged by the \"great Master,\" a physician,\r\naided by the chief matrons, and the public exercises of the youths and\r\nmaidens, performed in a state of nakedness, were of assistance in\r\nenabling unions to be fittingly made. No eugenist under modern\r\nconditions of life proposes that unions should be arranged by a supreme\r\nmedical public official, though he might possibly regard such an\r\nofficial, if divested of any compulsory powers, a kind of public trustee\r\nfor the race, as a useful institution. But it is easy to see that the\r\nluminous conception of racial betterment which, since Galton rendered it\r\npracticable, is now inspiring social progress, was already burning\r\nbrightly three centuries ago in the brain of this imprisoned Italian\r\nmonk. Just as Thomas More has been called the father of modern\r\nSocialism, so Campanella may be said to be the prophet of modern\r\nEugenics.\r\n\r\nBy \"Eugenics\" is meant the scientific study of all the agencies by which\r\nthe human race may be improved, and the effort to give practical effect\r\nto those agencies by conscious and deliberate action in favour of better\r\nbreeding. Even among savages eugenics may be said to exist, if only in\r\nthe crude and unscientific practice of destroying feeble, deformed, and\r\nabnormal infants at birth. In civilized ages elaborate and more or less\r\nscientific attempts are made by breeders of animals to improve the\r\nstocks they breed, and their efforts have been crowned with much\r\nsuccess. The study of the same methods in their bearing on man proceeded\r\nout of the Darwinian school of biology, and is especially associated\r\nwith the great name of Sir Francis Galton, the cousin of Darwin. Galton\r\nfirst proposed to call this study \"Stirpiculture.\" Under that name it\r\ninspired Noyes, the founder of the Oneida Community, with the impulse to\r\ncarry it into practice with a thoroughness and daring--indeed a\r\nsimilarity of method--which caused Oneida almost to rival the City of\r\nthe Sun. But the scheme of Noyes, excellent as in some respects it was\r\nas an experiment, outran both scientific knowledge and the spirit of the\r\ntimes. It was not countenanced by Galton, who never had any wish to\r\noffend general sentiment, but sought to win it over to his side, and\r\nbefore 1880 the Oneida Community was brought to an end in consequence of\r\nthe antagonism it aroused. Galton continued to develop his conceptions\r\nslowly and cautiously, and in 1883, in his _Inquiries into Human\r\nFaculty_, he abandoned the term \"Stirpiculture\" and devised the term\r\n\"Eugenics,\" which is now generally adopted to signify Good Breeding.\r\n\r\nGalton was quite well aware that the improved breeding of men is a very\r\ndifferent matter from the improved breeding of animals, requiring a\r\ndifferent knowledge and a different method, so that the ridicule which\r\nhas sometimes been ignorantly flung at Eugenics failed to touch him. It\r\nwould be clearly undesirable to breed men, as animals are bred, for\r\nsingle points at the sacrifice of other points, even if we were in a\r\nposition to breed men from outside. Human breeding must proceed from\r\nimpulses that arise, voluntarily, in human brains and wills, and are\r\ncarried out with a human sense of personal responsibility. Galton\r\nbelieved that the first need was the need of knowledge in these matters.\r\nHe was not anxious to invoke legislation.[24] The compulsory presentation\r\nof certificates of health and good breeding as a preliminary to marriage\r\nforms no part of Eugenics, nor is compulsory sterilization a demand made\r\nby any reasonable eugenist. Certainly the custom of securing\r\ncertificates of health and ability is excellent, not only as a\r\npreliminary to marriage, but as a general custom. Certainly, also, there\r\nare cases in which sterilization is desirable, if voluntarily\r\naccepted.[25] But neither certification nor sterilization should be\r\ncompulsory. They only have their value if they are intelligent and\r\ndeliberate, springing out of a widened and enlightened sense of personal\r\nresponsibility to society and to the race.\r\n\r\nEugenics constitutes the link between the Social Reform of the past,\r\npainfully struggling to improve the conditions of life, and the Social\r\nHygiene of the future, which is authorized to deal adequately with the\r\nconditions of life because it has its hands on the sources of life. On\r\nthis plane we are able to concentrate our energies on the finer ends of\r\nlife, because we may reasonably expect to be no longer hampered by the\r\never-increasing burdens which were placed upon us by the failure to\r\ncontrol life; while the more we succeed in our efforts to purify and\r\nstrengthen life, the more magnificent become the tasks we may reasonably\r\nhope to attempt and compass.\r\n\r\nA problem which is often and justly cited as one to be settled by\r\nEugenics is that presented by the existence among us of the large class\r\nof the feeble-minded. No doubt there are some who would regret the\r\ndisappearance of the feeble-minded from our midst. The philosophies of\r\nthe Bergsonian type, which to-day prevail so widely, place intuition\r\nabove reason, and the \"pure fool\" has sometimes been enshrined and\r\nidolized. But we may remember that Eugenics can never prevent absolutely\r\nthe occurrence of feeble-minded persons, even in the extreme degree of\r\nthe imbecile and the idiot.[26] They come within the range of variation,\r\nby the same right as genius so comes. We cannot, it may be, prevent the\r\noccurrence of such persons, but we can prevent them from being the\r\nfounders of families tending to resemble themselves. And in so doing, it\r\nwill be agreed by most people, we shall be effecting a task of immense\r\nbenefit to society and the race.\r\n\r\nFeeble-mindedness is largely handed on by heredity. It was formerly\r\nsupposed that idiocy and feeble-mindedness are mainly due to\r\nenvironmental conditions, to the drink, depravity, general disease, or\r\nlack of nutrition of the parents, and there is no doubt an element of\r\ntruth in that view. But serious and frequent as are the results of bad\r\nenvironment and acquired disease in the parentage of the feeble-minded,\r\nthey do not form the fundamental factor in the production of the\r\nfeeble-minded.[27]\r\n\r\nFeeble-mindedness is essentially a germinal variation, belonging to the\r\nsame large class as all other biological variations, occurring, for the\r\nmost part, in the first place spontaneously, but strongly tending to be\r\ninherited. It thus resembles congenital cataract, deaf-mutism, the\r\nsusceptibility to tuberculous infection, etc.[28]\r\n\r\nExact investigation is now showing that feeble-mindedness is passed on\r\nfrom parent to child to an enormous extent. Some years ago Ashby,\r\nspeaking from a large experience in the North of England, estimated that\r\nat least seventy-five per cent of feeble-minded children are born with\r\nan inherited tendency to mental defect. More precise investigation has\r\nsince shown that this estimate was under the mark. Tredgold, who in\r\nEngland has most carefully studied the heredity of the feeble-minded,[29]\r\nfound that in over eighty-two per cent cases there is a bad nervous\r\ninheritance. In a large number of cases the bad heredity was associated\r\nwith alcoholism or consumption in the parentage, but only in a small\r\nproportion of cases (about seven per cent) was it probable that\r\nalcoholism and consumption alone, and usually combined, had sufficed to\r\nproduce the defective condition of the children, while environmental\r\nconditions only produced mental defect in ten per cent cases.[30]\r\nHeredity is the chief cause of feeble-mindedness, and a normal child is\r\nnever born of two feeble-minded parents. The very thorough investigation\r\nof the heredity of the feeble-minded which is now being carried on at\r\nthe institution for their care at Vineland, New Jersey, shows even more\r\ndecisive results. By making careful pedigrees of the families to which\r\nthe inmates at Vineland belong it is seen that in a large proportion of\r\ncases feeble-mindedness is handed on from generation to generation, and\r\nis traceable through three generations, though it sometimes skips a\r\ngeneration. In one family of three hundred and nineteen persons, one\r\nhundred and nineteen were known to be feeble-minded, and only forty-two\r\nknown to be normal. The families tended to be large, sometimes very\r\nlarge, most of them in many cases dying in infancy or growing up\r\nweak-minded.[31]\r\n\r\nNot only is feeble-mindedness inherited, and to a much greater degree\r\nthan has hitherto been suspected even by expert authorities, but the\r\nfeeble-minded thus tend (though, as Davenport and Weeks have found, not\r\ninvariably) to have a larger number of children than normal people. That\r\nindeed, we might expect, apart altogether from the question of any\r\ninnate fertility. The feeble-minded have no forethought and no\r\nself-restraint. They are not adequately capable of resisting their own\r\nimpulses or the solicitations of others, and they are unable to\r\nunderstand adequately the motives which guide the conduct of ordinary\r\npeople. The average number of children of feeble-minded people seems to\r\nbe frequently about one-third more than in normal families, and is\r\nsometimes much greater. Dr. Ettie Sayer, when investigating for the\r\nLondon County Council the family histories of one hundred normal\r\nfamilies and one hundred families in which mentally defective children\r\nhad been found, ascertained that the families of the latter averaged 7.6\r\nchildren, while in the normal families they averaged 5. Tredgold,\r\nspecially investigating 150 feeble-minded cases, found that they\r\nbelonged to families in which 1269 children had been born, that is to\r\nsay 7.3 per family, or, counting still-born children, 8.4. Nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of these abnormally large families were mentally defective,\r\nmany showing a tendency to disease, pauperism, criminality, or else to\r\nearly death.[32]\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, we have a counterbalancing influence, for, in the large\r\nfamilies of the feeble-minded, there is a correspondingly large\r\ninfantile mortality. A considerable proportion of Tredgold's group of\r\nchildren were born dead, and a very large number died early. Eichholz,\r\nagain, found that, in one group of defective families, about sixty per\r\ncent of the children died young. That is probably an unusually high\r\nproportion, and in Eichholz's cases it seems to have been associated\r\nwith very unusually large families, but the infant mortality is always\r\nvery high.\r\n\r\nThis large early mortality of the offspring of the feeble-minded is,\r\nhowever, very far from settling the question of the disposal of the\r\nmentally defective, or we should not find families of them propagated\r\nfrom generation to generation. The large number who die early merely\r\nserves, roughly speaking, to reduce the size of the abnormal family to\r\nthe size of a normal family, and some authorities consider that it\r\nscarcely suffices to do this, for we must remember that there is a\r\nconsiderable mortality even in the so-called normal family during early\r\nlife. Even when there is no abnormal fertility in the defective family\r\nwe may still have to recognize that, as Davenport and Weeks argue, their\r\ndefectiveness is intensified by heredity. Moreover, we have to consider\r\nthe social disorder and the heavy expense which accompany the large\r\ninfantile mortality. Illegitimacy is frequently the result of\r\nfeeble-mindedness, since feeble-minded women are peculiarly unable to\r\nresist temptation. A great number of such women are continually coming\r\ninto the workhouses and giving birth to illegitimate children whom they\r\nare unable to support, and who often never become capable of supporting\r\nthemselves, but in their turn tend to produce a new feeble-minded\r\ngeneration, more especially since the men who are attracted to these\r\nfeeble-minded women are themselves--according to the generally\r\nrecognized tendency of the abnormal to be attracted to the\r\nabnormal--feeble-minded or otherwise mentally defective. There is thus\r\ngenerated not only a heavy financial burden, but also a perpetual danger\r\nto society, and, it may well be, a serious depreciation in the quality\r\nof the community.[33]\r\n\r\nIt is not only in themselves that the feeble-minded are a burden on the\r\npresent generation and a menace to future generations. In large measure\r\nthey form the reservoir from which the predatory classes are recruited.\r\nThis is, for instance, the case as regards prostitutes. Feeble-minded\r\ngirls, of fairly high grade, may often be said to be predestined to\r\nprostitution if left to themselves, not because they are vicious, but\r\nbecause they are weak and have little power of resistance. They cannot\r\nproperly weigh their actions against the results of their actions, and\r\neven if they are intelligent enough to do that, they are still too weak\r\nto regulate their actions accordingly. Moreover, even when, as often\r\nhappens among the high-grade feeble-minded, they are quite able and\r\nwilling to work, after they have lost their \"respectability\" by having a\r\nchild, the opportunities for work become more restricted, and they drift\r\ninto prostitution. It has been found that of nearly 15,000 women who\r\npassed through Magdalen Homes in England, over 2500, or more than\r\nsixteen per cent--and this is probably an under-estimate--were\r\ndefinitely feeble-minded. The women belonging to this feeble-minded\r\ngroup were known to have added 1000 illegitimate children to the\r\npopulation. In Germany Bonhoeffer found among 190 prostitutes who passed\r\nthrough a prison that 102 were hereditarily degenerate and 53\r\nfeeble-minded. This would be an over-estimate as regards average\r\nprostitutes, though the offences were no doubt usually trivial, but in\r\nany case the association between prostitution and feeble-mindedness is\r\nintimate. Everywhere, there can be no doubt, the ranks of prostitution\r\ncontain a considerable proportion of women who were, at the very outset,\r\nin some slight degree feeble-minded, mentally and morally a little\r\nblunted through some taint of inheritance.[34]\r\n\r\nCriminality, again, is associated with feeble-mindedness in the most\r\nintimate way. Not only do criminals tend to belong to large families,\r\nbut the families that produce feeble-minded offspring also produce\r\ncriminals, while a certain degree of feeble-mindedness is extremely\r\ncommon among criminals, and the most hopeless and typical, though\r\nfortunately rare, kind of criminal, frequently termed a \"moral\r\nimbecile,\" is nothing more than a feeble-minded person whose defect is\r\nshown not so much in his intelligence as in his feelings and his\r\nconduct. Sir H.B. Donkin, who speaks with authority on this matter,\r\nestimates that, though it is difficult to obtain the early history of\r\nthe criminals who enter English prisons, about twenty per cent of them\r\nare of primarily defective mental capacity. This would mean that every\r\nyear some 35,000 feeble-minded persons are sent to English prisons as\r\n\"criminals.\" The tendency of criminals to belong to the feeble-minded\r\nclass is indeed every day becoming more clearly recognized. At\r\nPentonville, putting aside prisoners who were too mentally affected to\r\nbe fit for prison discipline, eighteen per cent of the adult prisoners\r\nand forty per cent of the juvenile offenders were found to be\r\nfeeble-minded. This includes only those whose defect is fairly obvious,\r\nand is not the result of methodical investigation. It is certain that\r\nsuch methodical inquiry would reveal a very large proportion of cases of\r\nless obvious mental defect. Thus the systematic examination of a number\r\nof delinquent children in an Industrial School showed that in\r\nseventy-five per cent cases they were defective as compared to normal\r\nchildren, and that their defectiveness was probably inborn. Even the\r\npossession of a considerable degree of cunning is no evidence against\r\nmental defect, but may rather be said to be a sign of it, for it shows\r\nan intelligence unable to grasp the wider relations of life, and\r\nconcentrated on the gratification of petty and immediate desires. Thus\r\nit happens that the cunning of criminals is frequently associated with\r\nalmost inconceivable stupidity.[35]\r\n\r\nClosely related to the great feeble-minded class, and from time to time\r\nfalling into crime, are the inmates of workhouses, tramps, and the\r\nunemployable. The so-called \"able-bodied\" inmates of the workhouses are\r\nfrequently found, on medical examination, to be, in more than fifty per\r\ncent cases, mentally defective, equally so whether they are men or\r\nwomen. Tramps, by nature and profession, who overlap the workhouse\r\npopulation, and are estimated to number 20,000 to 30,000 in England and\r\nWales, when the genuine unemployed are eliminated, are everywhere found\r\nto be a very degenerate class, among whom the most mischievous kinds of\r\nfeeble-mindedness and mental perversion prevail. Inebriates, the people\r\nwho are chronically and helplessly given to drink, largely belong to the\r\nsame great family, and do not so much become feeble-minded because they\r\ndrink, but possess the tendency to drink because they have a strain of\r\nfeeble-mindedness from birth. Branthwaite, the chief English authority\r\non this question, finds that of the inebriates who come to his notice,\r\nputting aside altogether the group of actually insane persons, about\r\nsixty-three per cent are mentally defective, and scarcely more than a\r\nthird of the whole number of average mental capacity. It is evident that\r\nthese people, even if restored to sobriety, would still retain their\r\nmore or less inborn defectiveness, and would remain equally, unfit to\r\nbecome the parents of the coming generation.\r\n\r\nThese are the kind of people--tramps, prostitutes, paupers, criminals,\r\ninebriates, all tending to be born a little defective--who largely make\r\nup the great degenerate families whose histories are from time to time\r\nrecorded. Such a family was that of the Jukes in America, who, in the\r\ncourse of five generations, by constantly intermarrying with bad stocks,\r\nproduced 709 known descendants who were on the whole unfit for society,\r\nand have been a constant danger and burden to society.[36] A still larger\r\nfamily of the same kind, more recently studied in Germany, consisted of\r\n834 known persons, all descended from a drunken vagabond woman, probably\r\nsomewhat feeble-minded but physically vigorous. The great majority of\r\nthese descendants were prostitutes, tramps, paupers, and criminals (some\r\nof them murderers), and the direct cost in money to the Prussian State\r\nfor the keep and care of this woman and her family has been a quarter of\r\na million pounds. Yet another such family is that of the \"Zeros.\" Three\r\ncenturies ago they were highly respectable people, living in a Swiss\r\nvalley. But they intermarried with an insane stock, and subsequently\r\nmarried other women of an unbalanced nature. In recent times 310 members\r\nof this family have been studied, and it is found that vagrancy,\r\nfeeble-mindedness, mental troubles, criminality, pauperism, immorality\r\nare, as it may be termed, their patrimony.[37]\r\n\r\nThese classes, with their tendency to weak-mindedness, their inborn\r\nlaziness, lack of vitality, and unfitness for organized activity,\r\ncontain the people who complain that they are starving for want of work,\r\nthough they will never perform any work that is given them.\r\nFeeble-mindedness is an absolute dead-weight on the race. It is an evil\r\nthat is unmitigated. The heavy and complicated social burdens and\r\ninjuries it inflicts on the present generation are without compensation,\r\nwhile the unquestionable fact that in any degree it is highly\r\ninheritable renders it a deteriorating poison to the race; it\r\ndepreciates the quality of a people. The task of Social Hygiene which\r\nlies before us cannot be attempted by this feeble folk. Not only can\r\nthey not share it, but they impede it; their clumsy hands are for ever\r\nbecoming entangled in the delicate mechanism of our modern civilization.\r\nTheir very existence is itself an impediment. Apart altogether from the\r\ngross and obvious burden in money and social machinery which the\r\nprotection they need, and the protection we need against them, casts\r\nupon the community,[38] they dilute the spiritual quality of the\r\ncommunity to a degree which makes it an inapt medium for any high\r\nachievement. It matters little how small a city or a nation is, provided\r\nthe spirit of its people is great. It is the smallest communities that\r\nhave most powerfully and most immortally raised the level of\r\ncivilization, and surrounded the human species (in its own eyes) with a\r\nhalo of glory which belongs to no other species. Only a handful of\r\npeople, hemmed in on every side, created the eternal radiance of Athens,\r\nand the fame of the little city of Florence may outlive that of the\r\nwhole kingdom of Italy. To realize this truth in the future of\r\ncivilization is one of the first tasks of Social Hygiene.[39]\r\n\r\nIt is here that the ideals of Eugenics may be expected to work\r\nfruitfully. To insist upon the power of heredity was once considered to\r\nindicate a fatalistic pessimism. It wears a very different aspect\r\nnowadays, in the light of Eugenics. \"To the eugenist,\" as Davenport\r\nobserves, \"heredity stands as the one great hope of the human race: its\r\nsaviour from imbecility, poverty, disease, immorality.\"[40] We cannot,\r\nindeed, desire any compulsory elimination of the unfit or any centrally\r\nregulated breeding of the fit.[41] Such notions are idle, and even the\r\nmere fact that unbalanced brains may air them abroad tends to impair the\r\nlegitimate authority of eugenic ideals. The two measures which are now\r\ncommonly put forward for the attainment of eugenic ends--health\r\ncertificates as a legal preliminary to marriage and the sterilization of\r\nthe unfit--are excellent when wisely applied, but they become\r\nmischievous, if not ridiculous, in the hands of fanatics who would\r\nemploy them by force. Domestic animals may be highly bred from outside,\r\ncompulsorily. Man can only be bred upwards from within through the\r\nmedium of his intelligence and will, working together under the control\r\nof a high sense of responsibility. The infinite cunning of men and women\r\nis fully equal to the defeat of any attempt to touch life at this\r\nintimate point against the wish of those to whom the creation of life is\r\nentrusted. The laws of marriage even among savages have often been\r\ncomplex and strenuous in the highest degree. But it has been easy to\r\nbear them, for they have been part of the sacred and inviolable\r\ntraditions of the race; religion lay behind them. And Galton, who\r\nrecognized the futility of mere legislation in the elevation of the\r\nrace, believed that the hope of the future lies in rendering eugenics a\r\npart of religion. The only compulsion we can apply in eugenics is the\r\ncompulsion that comes from within. All those in whom any fine sense of\r\nsocial and racial responsibility is developed will desire, before\r\nmarriage, to give, and to receive, the fullest information on all the\r\nmatters that concern ancestral inheritance, while the registration of\r\nsuch information, it is probable, will become ever simpler and more a\r\nmatter of course.[42] And if he finds that he is not justified in aiding\r\nto carry on the race, the eugenist will be content to make himself, in\r\nthe words of Jesus, \"a eunuch for the kingdom of Heaven's sake,\"\r\nwhether, under modern conditions, that means abstention in marriage from\r\nprocreation, or voluntary sterilization by operative methods.[43] For, as\r\nGiddings has put it, the goal of the race lies, not in the ruthless\r\nexaltation of a super-man, but in the evolution of a super-mankind. Such\r\na goal can only be reached by resolute selection and elimination.[44]\r\n\r\nThe breeding of men lies largely in the hands of women. That is why the\r\nquestion of Eugenics is to a great extent one with the woman question.\r\nThe realization of eugenics in our social life can only be attained with\r\nthe realization of the woman movement in its latest and completest phase\r\nas an enlightened culture of motherhood, in all that motherhood involves\r\nalike on the physical and the psychic sides. Motherhood on the eugenic\r\nbasis is a deliberate and selective process, calling for the highest\r\nintelligence as well as the finest emotional and moral aptitudes, so\r\nthat all the best energies of a long evolution of womanhood in the paths\r\nof modern culture here find their final outlet. The breeding of children\r\nfurther involves the training of children, and since the expansion of\r\nSocial Hygiene renders education a far larger and more delicate task\r\nthan it has ever been before, the responsibilities laid upon women by\r\nthe evolution of civilization become correspondingly great.\r\n\r\nFor the men who have been thus born and taught the tasks imposed by\r\nSocial Hygiene are in no degree lighter. They demand all the best\r\nqualities of a selectively bred race from which the mentally and\r\nphysically weak have, so far as possible, been bred out. The\r\nsubstitution of law for war alike in the relations of class to class,\r\nand of nation to nation, and the organization of international methods\r\nof social intercourse between peoples of different tongues and unlike\r\ntraditions, are but two typical examples of the tasks, difficult but\r\nimperative, which Social Hygiene presents and the course of modern\r\ncivilization renders insistent. Again, the adequate adjustment of the\r\nclaims of the individual and the claims of the community, each carried\r\nto its farthest point, can but prove an exquisite test of the quality of\r\nany well-bred and well-trained race. It is exactly in that balancing of\r\napparent opposites, the necessity of pushing to extremes both opposites,\r\nand the consequent need of cultivating that quality of temperance the\r\nGreeks estimated so highly, that the supreme difficulties of modern\r\ncivilization lie. We see these difficulties again in relation to the\r\nextension of law. It is desirable and inevitable that the sphere of law\r\nshould be extended, and that the disputes which are still decided by\r\nbrutal and unreasoning force should be decided by humane and reasoning\r\nforce, that is to say, by law. But, side by side with this extension of\r\nlaw, it is necessary to wage a constant war with the law-making\r\ntendency, to cherish an undying resolve to maintain unsullied those\r\nsacred and intimate impulses, all the finest activities of the moral\r\nsphere, which the generalizing hand of law can only injure and stain.\r\n\r\nIt is these fascinating and impassioning problems, every day becoming of\r\nmore urgent practical importance, which it is the task of Social Hygiene\r\nto solve, having first created the men and women who are fit to solve\r\nthem. It is such problems as these that we are to-day called upon to\r\nilluminate, as far as we may--it may not yet be very far--by the dry\r\nlight of science.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Muralt, _Lettres sur les Anglais_. Lettre V.\r\n\r\n[2] In the reign of Richard II (1388) an Act was passed for \"the\r\npunishment of those which cause corruption near a city or great town to\r\ncorrupt the air.\" A century later (in Henry VII's time) an Act was\r\npassed to prevent butchers killing beasts in walled towns, the preamble\r\nto this Act declaring that no noble town in Christendom should contain\r\nslaughter-houses lest sickness be thus engendered. In Charles II's time,\r\nafter the great fire of London, the law provided for the better paving\r\nand cleansing of the streets and sewers. It was, however, in Italy, as\r\nWeyl points out (_Geschichte der Sozialen Hygiene im Mittelalter_, at a\r\nmeeting of the Gesellschaft fuer Soziale Medizin, May 25, 1905), that the\r\nmodern movement of organized sanitation began. In the thirteenth century\r\nthe great Italian cities (like Florence and Pistoja) possessed _Codici\r\nSanitarii_; but they were not carried out, and when the Black Death\r\nreached Florence in 1348, it found the city altogether unprepared. It\r\nwas Venice which, in the same year, first initiated vigorous State\r\nsanitation. Disinfection was first ordained by Gian Visconti, in Milan,\r\nin 1399. The first quarantine station of which we hear was established\r\nin Venice in 1403.\r\n\r\n[3] The rate of infant mortality in England and Wales has decreased from\r\n149 per 1000 births in 1871-80 to 127 per 1000 births in 1910. In\r\nreference to this remarkable fall which has taken place _pari passu_\r\nwith the fall in the birth-rate, Newsholme, the medical officer to the\r\nLocal Government Board, writes: \"There can be no reasonable doubt that\r\nmuch of the reduction has been caused by that 'concentration' on the\r\nmother and the child which has been a striking feature of the last few\r\nyears. Had the experience of 1896-1900 held good there would have been\r\n45,120 more deaths of infants in 1910 than actually occurred.\" In some\r\nparts of the country, however, where the women go out to work in\r\nfactories (as in Lancashire and parts of Staffordshire) the infantile\r\nmortality remains very high.\r\n\r\n[4] Mrs. Bertrand Russell, \"The Ghent School for Mothers,\" _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, December, 1906.\r\n\r\n[5] It is scarcely necessary to say that other classifications of social\r\nreform on its more hygienic side may be put forward. Thus W.H. Allen,\r\nlooking more narrowly at the sanitary side of the matter, but without\r\nconfining his consideration to the nineteenth century, finds that there\r\nare always seven stages: (1) that of racial tutelage, when sanitation\r\nbecomes conscious and receives the sanction of law; (2) the introduction\r\nof sanitary comfort, well-paved streets, public sewers, extensive\r\nwaterworks; (3) the period of commercial sanitation, when the mercantile\r\nclasses insist upon such measures as quarantine and street-cleaning to\r\ncheck the immense ravages of epidemics; (4) the introduction of\r\nlegislation against nuisances and the tendency to extend the definition\r\nof nuisance, which for Bracton, in the fourteenth century, meant an\r\nobstruction, and for Blackstone, in the eighteenth, included things\r\notherwise obnoxious, such as offensive trades and foul watercourses; (5)\r\nthe stage of precaution against the dangers incidental to the slums that\r\nare fostered by modern conditions of industry; (6) the stage of\r\nphilanthropy, erecting hospitals, model tenements, schools, etc.; (7)\r\nthe stage of socialistic sanitation, when the community as a whole\r\nactively seeks its own sanitary welfare, and devotes public funds to\r\nthis end. (W.H. Allen, \"Sanitation and Social Progress,\" _American\r\nJournal of Sociology_, March, 1903.)\r\n\r\n[6] Dr. F. Bushee has pointed out (\"Science and Social Progress,\"\r\n_Popular Science Monthly_, September, 1911) that there is a kind of\r\nrelated progression between science and practice in this matter: \"The\r\nnatural sciences developed first, because man was first interested in\r\nthe conquest of nature, and the simpler physical laws could be grasped\r\nat an early period. This period brought an increase of wealth, but it\r\nwas wasteful of human life. The desire to save life led the way to the\r\nstudy of biology. Knowledge of the physical environment and of life,\r\nhowever, did not prevent social disease from flourishing, and did not\r\ngreatly improve the social condition of a large part of society. To\r\novercome these defects the social sciences within recent years have been\r\ncultivated with great seriousness. Interest in the social sciences has\r\nhad to wait for the enlarged sympathies and the sense of solidarity\r\nwhich has appeared with the growing interdependence of dense\r\npopulations, and these conditions have been dependent upon the advance\r\nof the other sciences. With the cultivation of the social sciences, the\r\nchain of knowledge will be complete, at least so far as the needs which\r\nhave already appeared are concerned. For each group of sciences will\r\nsolve one or more of the great problems which man has encountered in the\r\nprocess of development. The physical sciences will solve the problems of\r\nenvironment, the biological sciences the problems of life, and the\r\nsocial sciences the problems of society.\"\r\n\r\n[7] This exclusive pre-occupation with the improvement of the\r\nenvironment has been termed Euthenics by Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, who has\r\nwritten a book with this title, advocating euthenics in opposition to\r\neugenics.\r\n\r\n[8] Not one of the four stages of social reform already summarized can\r\nbe neglected. On the contrary, they all need to be still further\r\nconsolidated in a completely national organization of health. I may\r\nperhaps refer to the little book on _The Nationalization of Health_, in\r\nwhich, many years ago, I foreshadowed this movement, as well as to the\r\nrecent work of Professor Benjamin Moore on the same subject. The\r\ngigantic efforts of Germany, and later of England, to establish National\r\nInsurance systems, bear noble witness to the ardour with which these two\r\ncountries, at all events, are moving towards the desired goal.\r\n\r\n[9] In some countries, however, the decline, although traceable about\r\n1876, only began to be pronounced somewhat later, in Austria in 1883, in\r\nthe German Empire, Hungary and Italy in 1885, and in Prussia in 1886.\r\nMost of these countries, though late in following the modern movement of\r\ncivilization initiated by France, are rapidly making their way in the\r\nsame direction. Thus the birth-rate in Berlin is already as low as that\r\nof Paris ten years ago, although the French decline began at a very\r\nearly period. In Norway, again, the decline was not marked until 1900,\r\nbut the birth-rate has nevertheless already fallen as low as that of\r\nSweden, where the fall began very much earlier.\r\n\r\n[10] \"Foresight and self-control is, and always must be, the ground and\r\nmedium of all Moral Socialism,\" says Bosanquet (_The Civilization of\r\nChristendom_, p. 336), using the term \"Socialism\" in the wide and not in\r\nthe economic sense. We see the same civilized growth of foresight and\r\nself-control in the decrease of drunkenness. Thus in England the number\r\nof convictions for drunkenness, while varying greatly in different parts\r\nof the country, is decreasing for the whole country at the rapid rate of\r\n5000 to 8000 a year, notwithstanding the constant growth of the\r\npopulation. It is incorrect to suppose that this decrease has any\r\nconnection with decreased opportunities for drinking; thus in London\r\nCounty and in Cardiff the proportion of premises licensed for drinking\r\nis the same, yet while the convictions for drunkenness in 1910 were in\r\nLondon 83 per 10,000 inhabitants, in Cardiff they were under 6 per\r\n10,000.\r\n\r\n[11] Thus Heron finds that in London during the past fifty years there\r\nhas been 100 per cent increase in the intensity of the relation between\r\nlow social birth and high birth-rate, and that the high birth-rate of\r\nthe lower social classes is not fully compensated by their high\r\ndeath-rate (D. Heron, \"On the Relation of Fertility in Man to Social\r\nStatus,\" _Drapers' Company Research Memoirs_, No. I, 1906). As, however,\r\nNewsholme and Stevenson point out (_Journal Royal Statistical Society_,\r\nApril, 1906, p. 74), the net addition to the population made by the best\r\nsocial classes is at so very slightly lower a rate than that made by the\r\npoorest class that, even if we consent to let the question rest on this\r\nground, there is still no urgent need for the wailings of Cassandra.\r\n\r\n[12] _Sociological Papers_ of the Sociological Society, 1904, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[13] There is a certain profit in studying one's own ancestry. It has\r\nbeen somewhat astonishing to me to find how very slight are the social\r\noscillations traceable in a middle-class family and the families it\r\nintermarries with through several centuries. A professional family tends\r\nto form a caste marrying within that caste. An ambitious member of the\r\nfamily may marry a baronet's daughter, and another, less pretentious, a\r\nvillage tradesman's daughter; but the general level is maintained\r\nwithout rising or falling. Occasionally, it happens that the ambitious\r\nand energetic son of a prosperous master-craftsman becomes a\r\nprofessional man, marries into the professional caste, and founds a\r\nprofessional family; such a family seems to flourish for some three\r\ngenerations, and then suddenly fails and dies out in the male line,\r\nwhile the vigour of the female line is not impaired.\r\n\r\n[14] The new social adjustment of a family, it is probable, is always\r\ndifficult, and if the change is sudden or extreme, the new environment\r\nmay rapidly prove fatal to the family. Lorenz (_Lehrbuch der\r\nGenealogie_, p. 135) has shown that when a peasant family reaches an\r\nupper social class it dies out in a few generations.\r\n\r\n[15] See, on this point, Reibmayr, _Entwicklungsgeschichte des Talentes\r\nund Genies_, Vol. I, ch. VII.\r\n\r\n[16] Fahlbeck, _op. cit._, p. 168.\r\n\r\n[17] Regeneration implies that there has been degeneration, and it cannot\r\nbe positively affirmed that such degeneration has, on the whole,\r\noccurred in such a manner as to affect the race. Reibmayr (_Die\r\nEntwicklungsgeschichte des Talentes und Genies_, Bd. I, p. 400) regards\r\ndegeneration as a process setting in with urbanization and the tendency\r\nto diminished population; if so, it is but another name for\r\ncivilization, and can only be condemned by condemning civilization,\r\nwhether or not physical deterioration occurs. The Inter-departmental\r\nCommission on Physical Deterioration held in 1904, in London, concluded\r\nthat there are no sufficient statistical or other data to prove that the\r\nphysique of the people in the present, as compared with the past, has\r\nundergone any change; and this conclusion was confirmed by the\r\nDirector-General of the Army Medical Service. There is certainly good\r\nreason to believe that urban populations (and especially industrial\r\nworkers in factories) are inferior in height and weight and general\r\ndevelopment to rural populations, and less fit for military or similar\r\nservice. The stunted development of factory workers in the East End of\r\nLondon was noted nearly a century ago, and German military experience\r\ndistinctly shows the inferiority of the town-dweller to the\r\ncountry-dweller. (See e.g. Weyl, _Handbuch der Hygiene_, Supplement, Bd.\r\nIV, pp. 746 _et seq._; _Politisch-Anthropologische Revue_, 1905, pp. 145\r\n_et seq._) The proportion of German youths fit for military service\r\nslowly decreases every year; in 1909 it was 53.6 per cent, in 1910 only\r\n53 per cent; of those born in the country and engaged in agricultural or\r\nforest work 58.2 were found fit; of those born in the country and\r\nengaged in other industries, 55.1 per cent; of those born in towns, but\r\nengaged in agricultural or forest work, 56.2 per cent; of those born in\r\ntowns and engaged in other industries 47.9 per cent. It is fairly clear\r\nthat this deterioration under urban and industrial conditions cannot\r\nproperly be termed a racial degeneration. It is, moreover, greatly\r\nimproved even by a few months' training, and there is an immense\r\ndifference between the undeveloped, feeble, half-starved recruit from\r\nthe slums and the robust, broad-shouldered veteran when he leaves the\r\narmy. The term \"aggeneration\"--not beyond criticism, though it is free\r\nfrom the objection to \"regeneration\"--was proposed by Prof. Christian\r\nvon Ehrenfels (\"Die Aufsteigende Entwicklung des Menschen,\"\r\n_Politisch-Anthropologische Revue_, April, 1903, p. 50).\r\n\r\n[18] It is unnecessary to touch here on the question of infant mortality,\r\nwhich has already been referred to, and will again come in for\r\nconsideration in a later chapter. It need only be said that a high\r\nbirth-rate is inextricably combined with a high death-rate. The European\r\ncountries with the highest birth-rates are, in descending order: Russia,\r\nBulgaria, Roumania, Servia, and Hungary. The European countries with the\r\nhighest death-rates are, in descending order, almost the same: Russia,\r\nHungary, Spain, Bulgaria, and Servia, It is the same outside Europe.\r\nThus Chile, with a birth-rate which comes next after Roumania, has a\r\ndeath-rate that is only second to Russia.\r\n\r\n[19] Nystroem (_La Vie Sexuelle_, 1910, p. 248) believes that \"the time is\r\ncoming when it will be considered the duty of municipal authorities, if\r\nthey have found by experience or have reason to suspect that children\r\nwill be thrown upon the parish, to instruct parents in methods of\r\npreventive conception.\"\r\n\r\n[20] The directly unfavourable influences on the child of too short an\r\ninterval between its birth and that of the previous child has been\r\nshown, for instance, by Dr. R.J. Ewart (\"The Influence of Parental Age\r\non Offspring,\" _Eugenics Review_, October, 1911). He has found at\r\nMiddlesbrough that children born at an interval of less than two years\r\nafter the birth of the previous child still show at the age of six a\r\nnotable deficiency in height, weight, and intelligence, when compared\r\nwith children born after a longer interval, or with first-born children.\r\n\r\n[21] _Tatler_, Vol. II, No. 175, 1709.\r\n\r\n[22] \"Write Man for Primula, and the stage of the world for that of the\r\ngreenhouse,\" says Professor Bateson (_Biological Fact and the Structure\r\nof Society_, 1912, p. 9), \"and I believe that with a few generations of\r\nexperimental breeding we should acquire the power similarly to determine\r\nhow the varieties of men should be represented in the generations that\r\nsucceed.\" But Bateson proceeds to point out that our knowledge is still\r\nvery inadequate, and he is opposed to eugenics by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[23] E. Solmi, _La Citta del Sole di Campanella_, 1904, p. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n[24] Only a year before his death Galton wrote (Preface to _Essays in\r\nEugenics_): \"The power by which Eugenic reform must chiefly be effected\r\nis that of Popular Opinion, which is amply strong enough for that\r\npurpose whenever it shall be roused.\"\r\n\r\n[25] It may perhaps be necessary to remark that by sterilization is here\r\nmeant, not castration, but, in the male vasectomy (and a corresponding\r\noperation in the female), a simple and harmless operation which involves\r\nno real mutilation and no loss of power beyond that of procreation. See\r\non this and related points, Havelock Ellis, _Studies in the Psychology\r\nof Sex_, Vol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" chap. XII.\r\n\r\n[26] The term \"feeble-minded\" may be used generally to cover all degrees\r\nof mental weakness. In speaking a little more precisely, however, we\r\nhave to recognize three main degrees of congenital mental weakness:\r\n_feeble-mindedness_, in which with care and supervision it is possible\r\nto work and earn a livelihood; _imbecility_, in which the subject is\r\nbarely able to look after himself, and sometimes only has enough\r\nintelligence to be mischievous (the moral imbecile); and _idiocy_, the\r\nlowest depth of all, in which the subject has no intelligence and no\r\nability to look after himself. More elaborate classifications are\r\nsometimes proposed. The method of Binet and Simon renders possible a\r\nfairly exact measurement of feeble-mindedness.\r\n\r\n[27] Mott (_Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry_, Vol. V, 1911) accepts\r\nthe view that in some cases feeble-mindedness is simply a form of\r\ncongenital syphilis, but he points out that feeble-mindedness abounds in\r\nmany rural districts where syphilis, as well as alcoholism, is very\r\nrare, and concludes by emphasizing the influence of heredity; the\r\nprevalence of feeble-mindedness in these rural districts is thus due to\r\nthe fact that the mentally and physically fit have emigrated to the\r\ngreat industrial centres, leaving the unfit to procreate the race.\r\n\r\n[28] \"Whether germinal variations,\" remarked Dr. R.J. Ryle at a\r\nConference on Feeble-mindedness (_British Medical Journal_, October 3,\r\n1911), \"be expressed by cleft palate, cataract, or cerebral deficiency\r\nof the pyramidal cells in the brain cortex, they may be produced, and,\r\nwhen once produced, they are reproduced as readily as the perfected\r\nstructure of the face or eye or brain, if the gametes which contain\r\nthese potentialities unite to form the ovum. But Nature is not only the\r\nproducer. Given a fair field and no favour, natural selection would\r\nleave no problem of the unfit to perplex the mind of man who looks\r\nbefore and after. This we know cannot be, and we know, too, that we have\r\nno longer the excuse of ignorance to cover the neglect of the new duties\r\nwhich belong to the present epoch of civilization. We know now that we\r\nhave to deal with a growing group in our community who demand permanent\r\ncare and control as well for their own sakes as for the welfare of the\r\ncommunity. All are now agreed on the general principle of segregation,\r\nbut it is true that something more than this should be forthcoming. The\r\ndifficulties of theory are clearing up as our wider view obtains a\r\nfirmer grasp of our material, but the difficulties of practice are still\r\nbefore us.\" These remarks correspond with the general results reached by\r\nthe Royal Commission on the Feeble-minded, which issued its voluminous\r\nfacts and conclusions in 1908.\r\n\r\n[29] See, for instance, A.F. Tredgold, _Mental Deficiency_, 1908.\r\n\r\n[30] The investigation of Bezzola showing that the maxima in the\r\nconception of idiots occur at carnival time, and especially at the\r\nvintage, has been held (especially by Forel) to indicate that alcoholism\r\nof the parents at conception causes idiocy in the offspring. It may be\r\nso. But it may also be that the licence of these periods enables the\r\ndefective members of the community to secure an amount of sexual\r\nactivity which they would be debarred from under normal conditions. In\r\nthat case the alcoholism would merely liberate, and not create, the\r\nidiocy-producing mechanism.\r\n\r\n[31] Godden, _Eugenics Review_, April, 1911.\r\n\r\n[32] Feeble-mindedness and the other allied variations are not always\r\nexactly repeated in inheritance. They may be transmuted in passing from\r\nfather to son, an epileptic father, for instance, having a feeble-minded\r\nchild. These relationships of feeble-mindedness have been clearly\r\nbrought out in an important investigation by Davenport and Weeks\r\n(_Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease_, November, 1911), who have for\r\nthe first time succeeded in obtaining a large number of really thorough\r\nand precise pedigrees of such cases.\r\n\r\n[33] It may be as well to point out once more that the possibility of\r\nsuch limited depreciation must not be construed into the statement that\r\nthere has been any general \"degeneration of the race.\" It maybe added\r\nthat the notion that the golden age lay in the past, and that our own\r\nage is degenerate is not confined to a few biometricians of to-day; it\r\nhas commended itself to uncritical minds in all ages, even the greatest,\r\nas far back as we can go. Montesquieu referred to this common notion\r\n(and attempted to explain it) in his _Pensees Diverses_: \"Men have such\r\na bad opinion of themselves,\" he adds, \"that they have believed not only\r\nthat their minds and souls were degenerate, but even their bodies, and\r\nthat they were not so tall as the men of previous ages.\" It is thus\r\nquite logically that we arrive at the belief that when mankind first\r\nappeared, \"there were giants on the earth in those days,\" and that Adam\r\nlived to the age of nine hundred and thirty. Evidently no syndromes of\r\ndegenerescence there!\r\n\r\n[34] The Superintendent of a large State School for delinquent girls in\r\nAmerica (as quoted in the Chicago Vice Commission's Report on _The\r\nSocial Evil in Chicago_, p. 229) says: \"The girls who come to us\r\npossessed of normal brain power, or not infected with venereal disease,\r\nwe look upon as a prize indeed, and we seldom fail to make a woman worth\r\nwhile of a really normal girl, whatever her environment has been. But we\r\nhave failed in numberless cases where the environment has been all\r\nright, but the girl was born wrong.\"\r\n\r\n[35] See e.g. Havelock Ellis, _The Criminal_, 4th ed., 1910, chap IV.\r\n\r\n[36] R.L. Dugdale, _The Jukes_, 4th ed., 1910. It is noteworthy that\r\nDugdale, who wrote nearly forty years ago, was concerned to prove the\r\ninfluence of bad environment rather than of bad heredity. At that time\r\nthe significance of heredity was scarcely yet conceived. It remains\r\ntrue, however, that bad heredity and bad environment constantly work\r\ntogether for evil.\r\n\r\n[37] Joerger, _Archiv fuer Rassen-und Gesellschafts-Biologie_, 1905, p.\r\n294. Criminal families are also recorded by Aubry, _La Contagion du\r\nMeutre_.\r\n\r\n[38] Even during school life this burden is serious. Mr. Bodey, Inspector\r\nof Schools, states that the defective school child costs three times as\r\nmuch as the ordinary school child.\r\n\r\n[39] I have set forth these considerations more fully in a popular form\r\nin _The Problem of the Regeneration of the Race_, the first of a series\r\nof \"New Tracts for the Times,\" issued under the auspices of the National\r\nCouncil of Public Morals.\r\n\r\n[40] C.B. Davenport, \"Euthenics and Eugenics,\" _Popular Science Monthly_,\r\nJanuary, 1911.\r\n\r\n[41] The use of the terms \"fit\" and \"unfit\" in a eugenic sense has been\r\ncriticized. It is said, for instance, that in a bad environment it may\r\nbe precisely the defective classes who are most \"fit\" to survive. It is\r\nquite true that these terms are not well adapted to resist\r\nhyper-critical attack. The persistence with which they are employed\r\nseems, however, to indicate a certain \"survival of the fittest.\" The\r\nterms \"worthy\" and \"unworthy,\" which some would prefer to substitute,\r\nare unsatisfactory, for they have moral associations which are\r\nmisleading. Galton spoke of \"civic worth\" in this connection, and very\r\noccasionally used the term \"worthy\" (with inverted commas), but he was\r\ncareful to point out (_Essays in Eugenics_, p. 35) that in eugenics \"we\r\nmust leave morals as far as possible out of the discussion, not\r\nentangling ourselves with the almost hopeless difficulties they raise as\r\nto whether a character as a whole is good or bad.\"\r\n\r\n[42] Dr. Toulouse has devoted a whole volume to the results of a minute\r\npersonal examination of Zola, the novelist, and another to Poincare, the\r\nmathematician. Such minute investigations are at present confined to men\r\nof genius, but some day, perhaps, we shall consider that from the\r\neugenic standpoint all men are men of genius.\r\n\r\n[43] Sterilization for social ends was introduced in Switzerland a few\r\nyears ago, in order to enable some persons with impaired self-control to\r\nbe set at liberty and resume work without the risk of adding to the\r\npopulation defective members who would probably be a burden on the\r\ncommunity. It was performed with the consent of the subjects (in some\r\ncases at their urgent request) and their relations, so requiring no\r\nspecial legislation, and the results are said to be satisfactory. In\r\nsome American States sterilization for some classes of defective persons\r\nhas been established by statute, but it is difficult to obtain reliable\r\ninformation as regards the working and the results of such legislation.\r\n\r\n[44] When Professor Giddings speaks of the \"goal of mankind,\" it must, of\r\ncourse, be remembered, he is using a bold metaphor in order to make his\r\nmeaning clearer. Strictly speaking, mankind has no \"goals,\" nor are\r\nthere any ends in Nature which are not means to further ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGING STATUS OF WOMEN[45]\r\n\r\n     The Origin of the Woman Movement--Mary Wollstonecraft--George\r\n     Sand--Robert Owen--William Thompson--John Stuart Mill--The Modern\r\n     Growth of Social Cohesion--The Growth of Industrialism--Its\r\n     Influence in Woman's Sphere of Work--The Education of\r\n     Women--Co-education--The Woman Question and Sexual\r\n     Selection--Significance of Economic Independence--The State\r\n     Regulation of Marriage--The Future of Marriage--Wilhelm von\r\n     Humboldt--Social Equality of Women--The Reproduction of the Race as\r\n     a Function of Society--Women and the Future of Civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt was in the eighteenth century, the seed-time of modern ideas, that\r\nour great-grandfathers became conscious of a discordant break in the\r\ntraditional conceptions of women's status. The vague cries of Justice,\r\nFreedom, Equality, which were then hurled about the world, were here and\r\nthere energetically applied to women--notably in France by\r\nCondorcet--and a new movement began to grow self-conscious and coherent.\r\nMary Wollstonecraft, after Aphra Behn the first really noteworthy\r\nEnglishwoman of letters, gave voice to this movement in England.\r\n\r\nThe famous and little-read _Vindication of the Rights of Women_,\r\ncareless and fragmentary as it is, and by no means so startling to us as\r\nto her contemporaries, shows Mary Wollstonecraft as a woman of genuine\r\ninsight, who saw the questions of woman's social condition in their\r\nessential bearings. Her intuitions need little modification, even though\r\na century of progress has intervened. The modern advocates of woman's\r\nsuffrage have little to add to her brief statement. She is far, indeed,\r\nfrom the monstrous notion of Miss Cobbe, that woman's suffrage is the\r\n\"crown and completion\" of all progress so far as women's movements are\r\nconcerned. She looks upon it rather as one of the reasonable conditions\r\nof progress. It is pleasant to turn from the eccentric energy of so many\r\nof the advocates of women's causes to-day, all engaged in crying up\r\ntheir own particular nostrum, to the genial many-sided wisdom of Mary\r\nWollstonecraft, touching all subjects with equal frankness and delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant and successful exponent of the new revolutionary\r\nideas--making Corinne and her prototype seem dim and ineffectual--was\r\nundoubtedly George Sand. The badly-dressed woman who earned her living\r\nby scribbling novels, and said to M. du Camp, as she sat before him in\r\nsilence rolling her cigarette, \"Je ne dis rien parceque je suis bete,\"\r\nhas exercised a profound influence throughout Europe, an influence\r\nwhich, in the Sclavonic countries especially, has helped to give impetus\r\nto the resolution we are now considering. And this not so much from any\r\ndefinite doctrines that underlie her work--for George Sand's views on\r\nsuch matters varied as much as her political views--as from her whole\r\ntemper and attitude. Her large and rich nature, as sometimes happens in\r\ngenius of a high order, was twofold; on the one hand, she possessed a\r\nsolid serenity, a quiet sense of power, the qualities of a _bonne\r\nbourgeoise_, which found expression in her imperturbable calm, her\r\ngentle look and low voice. And with this was associated a massive,\r\nalmost Rabelaisian temperament (one may catch glimpses of it in her\r\ncorrespondence), a sane exuberant earthliness which delighted in every\r\nmanifestation of the actual world. On the other hand, she bore within\r\nher a volcanic element of revolt, an immense disgust of law and custom.\r\nThroughout her life George Sand developed her strong and splendid\r\nindividuality, not perhaps as harmoniously, but as courageously and as\r\nsincerely as even Goethe.\r\n\r\nRobert Owen, who, like Saint-Simon in France, gave so extraordinary an\r\nimpulse to all efforts at social reorganization, and who planted the\r\nseed of many modern movements, could not fail to extend his influence to\r\nthe region of sex. A disciple of his, William Thompson, who still holds\r\na distinguished position in the history of the economic doctrines of\r\nSocialism, wrote, under the inspiration of a woman (a Mrs. Wheeler),\r\nand published in 1825, an _Appeal of One Half of the Human Race, Women,\r\nagainst the Pretensions of the Other Half, Men, to retain them in\r\nPolitical, and thence in Civil and Domestic Slavery_. It is a thorough\r\nand logical, almost eloquent, demand for the absolute social equality of\r\nthe sexes.[46]\r\n\r\nForty years later, Mill, also inspired by a woman, published his\r\n_Subjection of Women_. However partial and inadequate it may seem to us,\r\nthis was at that day a notable book. Mill's clear vision and feminine\r\nsensibilities gave freshness to his observations regarding the condition\r\nand capacity of women, while his reputation imparted gravity and\r\nresonance to his utterances. Since then the signs in literature of the\r\nbreaking up of the status of women have become far too numerous to be\r\nchronicled even in a volume. It is enough to have mentioned here some\r\ntypical initiatory names. Now, the movement may be seen at work\r\nanywhere, from Norway to Italy, from Russia to California. The status\r\nwhich women are now entering places them, not, as in the old communism,\r\nin large measure practically above men, nor, as in the subsequent\r\nperiod, both practically and theoretically in subordination to men. It\r\nplaces them side by side, with like rights and like duties in relation\r\nto society.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCondorcet, Mary Wollstonecraft, George Sand, Owen, Mill--these were\r\nfeathers on the stream. They indicated the forces that had their source\r\nat the centre of social life. That historical movement which produced\r\nmother-law probably owed its rise, as well as its fall, to demands of\r\nsubsistence and property--that is, to economic causes. The decay of the\r\nsubsequent family system, in which the whole power is concentrated in\r\nthe male head, is being produced by similar causes. The early communism,\r\nand the modes of action and sentiment which it had produced, still\r\npractically persisted long after the new system had arisen. In the\r\npatriarchal family the woman still had a recognized sphere of work and a\r\nrecognized right to subsistence. It was not, indeed, until the sudden\r\ndevelopment of the industrial system, and the purely individualistic\r\neconomics with which it was associated, at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, that women in England were forced to realize that\r\ntheir household industries were gone, and that they must join in that\r\ngame of competition in which the field and the rules had alike been\r\nchosen with reference to men alone. The commercial and industrial\r\nsystem, and the general diffusion of education that has accompanied it,\r\nand which also has its roots in economic causes, has been the chief\r\nmotive force in revolutionizing the status of women; and the epoch of\r\nunrestricted competition on masculine lines has been a necessary period\r\nof transition.[47]\r\n\r\nAt the present time two great tendencies are visible in our social\r\norganization. On the one hand, the threads of social life are growing\r\ncloser, and organization, as regards the simple and common means of\r\nsubsistence, is increasing. On the other hand, as regards the things\r\nthat most closely concern the individual person, the sphere of freedom\r\nis being perpetually enlarged. Instead of every man digging a well for\r\nhis own use and at his own free pleasure, perhaps in a graveyard or a\r\ncesspool, we consent to the distribution of water by a central\r\nexecutive. We have carried social methods so far that, instead of\r\nproducing our own bread and butter, we prefer to go to a common bakery\r\nand dairy. The same centralizing methods are extending to all those\r\nthings of which all have equal need. On the other hand, we exercise a\r\nvery considerable freedom of individual thought. We claim a larger and\r\nlarger freedom of individual speech and criticism. We worship any god we\r\nchoose, after any fashion we choose. The same individual freedom is\r\nbeginning to invade the sexual relationships. It is extending to all\r\nthose things in regard to which civilized men have become so variously\r\ndifferentiated that they have no equal common needs. These two\r\ntendencies, so far from being antagonistic, cannot even be carried out\r\nunder modern conditions of life except together. It is only by social\r\nco-operation in regard to what is commonly called the physical side of\r\nlife that it becomes possible for the individual to develop his own\r\npeculiar nature. The society of the future is a reasonable anarchy\r\nfounded on a broad basis of Collectivism.\r\n\r\nIt is not our object here to point out how widely these tendencies\r\naffect men, but it is worth while to indicate some of their bearings on\r\nthe condition of women. While genuine productive industries have been\r\ntaken out of the hands of women who work under the old conditions, an\r\nincreasingly burdensome weight of unnecessary duties has been laid upon\r\nthem. Under the old communistic system, when a large number of families\r\nlived together in one great house, the women combined to perform their\r\nhousehold duties, the cooking being done at a common fire. They had\r\ngrown up together from childhood, and combination could be effected\r\nwithout friction. It is the result of the later system that the woman\r\nhas to perform all the necessary household duties in the most wasteful\r\nmanner, with least division of labour; while she has, in addition, to\r\nperform a great amount of unnecessary work, in obedience to traditional\r\nor conventional habits, which make it impossible even to perform the\r\nsimple act of dusting the rooms of a small house in less than perhaps an\r\nhour and a half. She has probably also to accomplish, if she happens to\r\nbelong to the middle or upper classes, an idle round of so-called\r\n\"social duties.\" She tries to escape, when she can afford it, by\r\nadopting the apparently simple expedient of paying other people to\r\nperform these necessary and unnecessary household duties, but this\r\nexpedient fails; the \"social duties\" increase in the same ratio as the\r\nservants increase and the task of overseeing these latter itself proves\r\nformidable. It is quite impossible for any person under these conditions\r\nto lead a reasonable and wholesome human life. A healthy life is more\r\ndifficult to attain for the woman of the ordinary household than for the\r\nworker in a mine, for he at least, when the work of his set is over, has\r\ntwo-thirds of the twenty-four hours to himself. The woman is bound by a\r\nthousand Lilliputian threads from which there seems no escape. She often\r\nmakes frantic efforts to escape, but the combined strength of the\r\nthreads generally proves too strong. There can be no doubt that the\r\npresent household system is doomed; the higher standard of intelligence\r\ndemanded from women, the growth of interest in the problems of domestic\r\neconomy, the movement for association of labour, the revolt against the\r\nsurvivals of barbaric complication in living--all these, which are\r\nsymptoms of a great economic revolution, indicate, the approach of a new\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe education of women is an essential part of the great movement we are\r\nconsidering. Women will shortly be voters, and women, at all events in\r\nEngland, are in a majority. We have to educate our mistresses as we once\r\nhad to educate our masters. And the word \"education\" is here used by no\r\nmeans in the narrow sense. A woman may be acquainted with Greek and the\r\nhigher mathematics, and be as uneducated in the wider relationships of\r\nlife as a man in the like case. How much women suffer from this lack of\r\neducation may be seen to-day even among those who are counted as\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nThere are extravagances in every period of transition. Undoubtedly a\r\npotent factor in bringing about a saner attitude will be the education\r\nof boys and girls together. The lack of early fellowship fosters an\r\nunnatural divergence of aims and ideals, and a consequent lack of\r\nsympathy. It makes possible those abundant foolish generalizations by\r\nmen concerning \"women,\" by women concerning \"men.\" St. Augustine, at an\r\nearly period of his ardent career, conceived with certain friends the\r\nnotion of forming a community having goods in common; the scheme was\r\nalmost effected when it was discovered that \"those little wives, which\r\nsome already had, and others would shortly have,\" objected, and so it\r\nfell through. Perhaps the _mulierculae_ were right. It is simply a rather\r\nremote instance of a fundamental divergence amply illustrated before our\r\neyes. If men and women are to understand each other, to enter into each\r\nother's natures with mutual sympathy, and to become capable of genuine\r\ncomradeship, the foundation must be laid in youth. Another wholesome\r\nreform, promoted by co-education, is the physical education of women. In\r\nthe case of boys special attention has generally been given to physical\r\neducation, and the lack of it is one among several artificial causes of\r\nthat chronic ill-health which so often handicaps women. Women must have\r\nthe same education as men, Miss Faithfull shrewdly observes, because\r\nthat is sure to be the best. The present education of boys cannot,\r\nhowever, be counted a model, and the gradual introduction of\r\nco-education will produce many wholesome reforms. If the intimate\r\nassociation of the sexes destroys what remnant may linger of the\r\nunhealthy ideal of chivalry--according to which a woman was treated as a\r\ncross between an angel and an idiot--that is matter for rejoicing.\r\nWherever men and women stand in each other's presence the sexual\r\ninstinct will always ensure an adequate ideal halo.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe chief question that we have to ask when we consider the changing\r\nstatus of women is: How will it affect the reproduction of the race?\r\nHunger and love are the two great motor impulses, the ultimate source,\r\nprobably, of all other impulses. Hunger--that is to say, what we call\r\n\"economic causes\"--has, because it is the more widespread and constant,\r\nthough not necessarily the more imperious instinct, produced nearly all\r\nthe great zoological revolutions, including, as we have seen, the rise\r\nand fall of that phase of human evolution dominated by mother-law. Yet\r\nlove has, in the form of sexual selection, even before we reach the\r\nvertebrates, moulded races to the ideal of the female; and reproduction\r\nis always the chief end of nutrition which hunger waits on, the supreme\r\naim of life everywhere.\r\n\r\nIf we place on the one side man, as we know him during the historical\r\nperiod, and on the other, nearly every highly organized member of the\r\nanimal family, there appears, speaking roughly and generally, a distinct\r\ndifference in the relation which these two motor impulses bear to each\r\nother. Among animals generally, economics are comparatively so simple\r\nthat it is possible to satisfy the nutritive instinct without putting\r\nany hard pressure on the spontaneous play of the reproductive instinct.\r\nAnd nearly everywhere it is the female who has the chief voice in the\r\nestablishment of sexual relationships. The males compete for the favour\r\nof the female by the fascination of their odour, or brilliant colour, or\r\nsong, or grace, or strength, as revealed in what are usually\r\nmock-combats. The female is, in these respects, comparatively\r\nunaccomplished and comparatively passive. With her rests the final\r\ndecision, and only after long hesitation, influenced, it seems, by a\r\nvaguely felt ideal resulting from her contemplation of the rivals, she\r\ncalls the male of her choice.[48] A dim instinct seems to warn her of the\r\npains and cares of maternity, so that only the largest promises of\r\npleasure can induce her to undertake the function of reproduction. In\r\ncivilized man, on the other hand, as we know him, the situation is to\r\nsome extent reversed; it is the woman who, by the display of her\r\nattractions, competes for the favour of the man. The final invitation\r\ndoes not come, as among animals generally, from the female; the decision\r\nrests with the man. It would be a mistake to suppose that this change\r\nreveals the evolution of a superior method; although it has developed\r\nthe beauty of women, it has clearly had its origin in economic causes.\r\nThe demands of nutrition have overridden those of reproduction; sexual\r\nselection has, to a large extent, given place to natural selection, a\r\nprocess clearly not for the advantage of the race. The changing status\r\nof women, in bestowing economic independence, will certainly tend to\r\nrestore to sexual selection its due weight in human development.\r\n\r\nIn so doing it will certainly tend also to destroy prostitution, which\r\nis simply one of the forms in which the merging of sexual selection in\r\nnatural selection has shown itself. Wherever sexual selection has free\r\nplay, unhampered by economic considerations, prostitution is\r\nimpossible. The dominant type of marriage is, like prostitution, founded\r\non economic considerations; the woman often marries chiefly to earn her\r\nliving; here, too, we may certainly expect profound modifications. We\r\nhave long sought to preserve our social balance by placing an\r\nunreasonable licence in the one scale, an equally unreasonable\r\nabstinence in the other; the economic independence of women, tending to\r\nrender both extremes unnecessary, can alone place the sexual\r\nrelationships on a sound and free basis.\r\n\r\nThe State regulation of marriage has undoubtedly played a large and\r\nimportant part in the evolution of society. At the present time the\r\nadvantages of this artificial control no longer appear so obvious\r\n(even when the evidence of the law courts is put aside); they will\r\nvanish altogether when women have attained complete economic\r\nindependence. With the disappearance of the artificial barriers in the\r\nway of friendship between the sexes and of the economic motive to\r\nsexual relationships--perhaps the two chief forces which now tend to\r\nproduce promiscuous sexual intercourse, whether dignified or not with\r\nthe name of marriage--men and women will be free to engage,\r\nunhampered, in the search, so complicated in a highly civilized\r\ncondition of society, for a fitting mate.[49]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this inevitable change will be brought about partly\r\nby the voluntary action of individuals, and in greater measure by the\r\ngradual and awkward method of shifting and ever freer divorce laws. The\r\nslow disintegration of State-regulated marriage from the latter cause\r\nmay be observed now throughout the United States, where there is, on the\r\nwhole, a developing tendency to frequency and facility of divorce. It\r\nis clear, however, that on this line marriage will not cease to be a\r\nconcern to the State, and it may be as well to point out at once the\r\nimportant distinction between State-_regulated_ and State-_registered_\r\nmarriage. Sexual relationships, so long as they do not result in the\r\nproduction of children, are matters in which the community has, as a\r\ncommunity, little or no concern, but as soon as a sexual relationship\r\nresults in the pregnancy of the woman the community is at once\r\ninterested. At this point it is clearly the duty of the State to\r\nregister the relationship.[50]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to remember that the kind of equality of the sexes\r\ntowards which this change of status is leading, is social equality--that\r\nis, equality of freedom. It is not an intellectual equality, still less\r\nis it likeness. Men and women can only be alike mentally when they are\r\nalike in physical configuration and physiological function. Even\r\ncomplete economic equality is not attainable. Among animals which live\r\nin herds under the guidance of a leader, this leader is nearly always a\r\nmale; there are few exceptions.[51] In woman, the long period of\r\npregnancy and lactation, and the prolonged helplessness of her child,\r\nrender her for a considerable period of her life economically dependent.\r\nOn whom shall she be dependent? This is a question of considerable\r\nmoment. According to the old conception of the family, all the members\r\nwere slaves producing for the benefit of the owner, and it was natural\r\nthat the wife should be supported by the husband when she is producing\r\nslaves for his service. But this conception is, as we have seen, no\r\nlonger possible. It is clearly unfair also to compel the mother to\r\ndepend on her own previous exertions. The reproduction of the race is a\r\nsocial function, and we are compelled to conclude that it is the duty of\r\nthe community, as a community, to provide for the child-bearer when in\r\nthe exercise of her social function she is unable to provide for\r\nherself. The woman engaged in producing a new member, who may be a\r\nsource of incalculable profit or danger to the whole community, cannot\r\nfail to be a source of the liveliest solicitude to everyone in the\r\ncommunity, and it was a sane and beautiful instinct that found\r\nexpression of old in the permission accorded to a pregnant woman to\r\nenter gardens and orchards, and freely help herself. Whether this\r\ninstinct will ever again be embodied in a new form, and the reproduction\r\nof the race be recognized as truly a social function, is a question\r\nwhich even yet lacks actuality. The care of the child-bearer and her\r\nchild will at present continue to be a matter for individual\r\narrangement. That it will be arranged much better than at present we\r\nmay reasonably hope. On the one hand, the reckless multiplication of\r\nchildren will probably be checked; on the other hand, a large body of\r\nwomen will no longer be shut out from maternity. That the state should\r\nundertake the regulation of the birth-rate we can scarcely either desire\r\nor anticipate. Undoubtedly the community has an abstract right to limit\r\nthe number of its members. It may be pointed out, however, that under\r\nrational conditions of life the process would probably be\r\nself-regulating; in the human races, and also among animals generally,\r\nfertility diminishes as the organism becomes highly developed. And,\r\nwithout falling back on any natural law, it may be said that the\r\nextravagant procreation of children, leading to suffering both to\r\nparents and offspring, carried on under existing social conditions, is\r\nlargely the result of ignorance, largely of religious or other\r\nsuperstition. A more developed social state would not be possible at all\r\nunless the social instincts were strong enough to check the reckless\r\nmultiplication of offspring. Richardson and others appear to advocate\r\nthe special cultivation of a class of non-childbearing women. Certainly\r\nno woman who freely chose should be debarred from belonging to such a\r\nclass. But reproduction is the end and aim of all life everywhere, and\r\nin order to live a humanly complete life, every healthy woman should\r\nhave, not sexual relationships only, but the exercise at least once in\r\nher life of the supreme function of maternity, and the possession of\r\nthose experiences which only maternity can give. That unquestionably is\r\nthe claim of natural and reasonable living in the social state towards\r\nwhich we are moving.\r\n\r\nTo deal with the social organization of the future would be to pass\r\nbeyond the limits that I have here set myself, and to touch on matters\r\nof which it is impossible to speak with certainty. The new culture of\r\nwomen, in the light and the open air, will doubtless solve many matters\r\nwhich now are dark to us. Morgan supposed that it was in some measure\r\nthe failure of the Greeks and Romans to develop their womanhood which\r\nbrought the speedy downfall of classic civilization. The women of the\r\nfuture will help to renew art and science as well as life. They will do\r\nmore even than this, for the destiny of the race rests with women. \"I\r\nhave sometimes thought,\" Whitman wrote in his _Democratic Vistas_, \"that\r\nthe sole avenue and means to a reconstructed society depended primarily\r\non a new birth, elevation, expansion, invigoration of women.\" That\r\nintuition is not without a sound basis, and if a great historical\r\nmovement called for justification here would be enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] This chapter was written so long ago as 1888, and published in the\r\n_Westminster Review_ in the following year. I have pleasure in here\r\nincluding it exactly as it was originally written, not only because it\r\nhas its proper place in the present volume, but because it may be\r\nregarded as a programme which I have since elaborated in numerous\r\nvolumes. The original first section has, however, been omitted, as it\r\nembodied a statement of the matriarchal theory which, in view of the\r\ndifficulty of the subject and the wide differences of opinion about it,\r\nI now consider necessary to express more guardedly (see, for a more\r\nrecent statement, Havelock Ellis, _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_,\r\nVol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" chap. X). With this exception,\r\nand the deletion of two insignificant footnotes, no changes have been\r\nmade. After the lapse of a quarter of a century I find nothing that I\r\nseriously wish to withdraw and much that I now wish to emphasize.\r\n\r\n[46] The following passage summarizes this _Appeal_: \"The simple and\r\nmodest request is, that they may be permitted equal enjoyments with men,\r\n_provided they can, by the free and equal development and exercise of\r\ntheir faculties, procure for themselves such enjoyments_. They ask the\r\nsame means that men possess of acquiring every species of knowledge, of\r\nunfolding every one of their faculties of mind and body that can be made\r\ntributary to their happiness. They ask every facility of access to every\r\nart, occupation, profession, from the highest to the lowest, without one\r\nexception, to which their inclinations and talents may direct and may\r\nfit them to occupy. They ask the removal of _all_ restraints and\r\nexclusions not applicable to men of equal capacities. They ask for\r\nperfectly equal political, civil, and domestic rights. They ask for\r\nequal obligations and equal punishments from the law with men in case of\r\ninfraction of the same law by either party. They ask for an equal system\r\nof morals, founded on utility instead of caprice and unreasoning\r\ndespotism, in which the same action, attended with the same\r\nconsequences, whether done by man or woman, should be attended with the\r\nsame portion of approbation or disapprobation; in which every pleasure,\r\naccompanied or followed by no preponderant evil, should be equally\r\npermitted to women and to men; in which every pleasure accompanied or\r\nfollowed by preponderant evil should be equally censured in women and in\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n[47] A period of transition not the less necessary although it is\r\ncertainly disastrous and tends to produce an unwholesome tension between\r\nthe sexes so long as men and women do not receive equal payment for\r\nequal work. \"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,\" as a working man in\r\nBlackburn lately put it, \"but when the thing of beauty takes to doing\r\nthe work for 16s. a week that you have been paid 22s. for, you do not\r\nfeel as if you cannot live without possessing that thing of beauty all\r\nto yourself, or that you are willing to lay your life and your fortune\r\n(when you have one) at its feet.\" On the other hand, the working girl in\r\nthe same town often complains that a man will not look at a girl unless\r\nshe is a \"four-loom weaver,\" earning, that is, perhaps, 20s. or 25s. a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n[48] See the very interesting work of Alfred Espinas, _Des Societes\r\nAnimales_, which contains many fruitful suggestions for the student of\r\nhuman sociology.\r\n\r\n[49] The subtle and complex character of the sexual relationships in a\r\nhigh civilization, and the unhappy results of their State regulation,\r\nwas well expressed by Wilhehm von Humboldt in his _Ideen zu einen\r\nVersuch, die Grenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staates zu bestimmen_, so long\r\nago as 1792: \"A union so closely allied with the very nature of the\r\nrespective individuals must be attended with the most hurtful\r\nconsequences when the State attempts to regulate it by law, or, through\r\nthe force of its institutions, to make it repose on anything save simple\r\ninclination. When we remember, moreover, that the State can only\r\ncontemplate the final results of such regulations on the race, we shall\r\nbe still more ready to admit the justice of this conclusion. It may\r\nreasonably be argued that a solicitude for the race only conducts to the\r\nsame results as the highest solicitude for the most beautiful\r\ndevelopment of the inner man. For after careful observation it has been\r\nfound that the uninterrupted union of one man with one woman is most\r\nbeneficial to the race, and it is likewise undeniable that no other\r\nunion springs from true, natural, harmonious love. And further, it may\r\nbe observed that such love leads to the same results as those very\r\nrelations which law and custom tend to establish. The radical error\r\nseems to be that the law commands; whereas such a relation cannot mould\r\nitself according to external arrangements, but depends wholly on\r\ninclination; and wherever coercion or guidance comes into collision with\r\ninclination, they divert it still farther from the proper path.\r\nWherefore it appears to me that the State should not only loosen the\r\nbonds in this instance, and leave ampler freedom to the citizen, but\r\nthat it should entirely withdraw its active solicitude from the\r\ninstitution of marriage, and both generally and in its particular\r\nmodifications, should rather leave it wholly to the free choice of the\r\nindividuals, and the various contracts they may enter into with respect\r\nto it. I should not be deterred from the adoption of this principle by\r\nthe fear that all family relations might be disturbed, for although such\r\na fear might be justified by considerations of particular circumstances\r\nand localities, it could not fairly be entertained in an inquiry into\r\nthe nature of men and States in general. For experience frequently\r\nconvinces us that just where law has imposed no fetters, morality most\r\nsurely binds; the idea of external coercion is one entirely foreign to\r\nan institution which, like marriage, reposes only on inclination and an\r\ninward sense of duty; and the results of such coercive institutions do\r\nnot at all correspond to the intentions in which they originate.\"\r\n\r\n[50] Such register should, as Bertillon rightly insisted, be of the most\r\ncomplete description--setting forth all the anthropological traits of\r\nthe contracting parties--so that the characteristics of a human group at\r\nany time and place may be studied and compared. Registration of this\r\nkind would, beside its more obvious convenience, form an almost\r\nindispensable guide to the higher evolution of the race. I may here add\r\nthat I have assumed, perhaps too rashly, that the natural tendency among\r\ncivilized men and women is towards a monogamic and more or less\r\npermanent union; preceded, it may be in most individuals, by a more\r\nrestless period of experiment. Undoubtedly, many variations will arise\r\nin the future, leading to more complex relationships. Such variations\r\ncannot be foreseen, and when they arise they will still have to prove\r\ntheir stability and their advantage to the race.\r\n\r\n[51] As among geese, and, occasionally, it is said, among elephants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ASPECT OF THE WOMAN'S MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n     Eighteenth-Century France--Pioneers of the Woman's Movement--The\r\n     Growth of the Woman's Suffrage Movement--The Militant Activities of\r\n     the Suffragettes--Their Services and Disservices to the\r\n     Cause--Advantages of Women's Suffrage--Sex Questions in\r\n     Germany--Bebel--The Woman's Rights Movement in Germany--The\r\n     Development of Sexual Science in Germany--the Movement for the\r\n     Protection of Motherhood--Ellen Key--The Question of\r\n     Illegitimacy--Eugenics--Women as Law-makers in the Home.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe modern conception of the political equality of women with men, we\r\nhave seen, arose in France in the second half of the eighteenth century.\r\nIts way was prepared by the philosophic thinkers of the _Encyclopedie_,\r\nand the idea was definitely formulated by some of the finest minds of\r\nthe age, notably by Condorcet,[52] as part of the great new programme of\r\nsocial and political reform which was to some small degree realized in\r\nthe upheaval of the Revolution. The political emancipation of women\r\nconstituted no part of the Revolution. It has indeed been maintained,\r\nand perhaps with reason, that the normal development of the\r\nrevolutionary spirit would probably have ended in vanquishing the claim\r\nof masculine predominance if war had not diverted the movement of\r\nrevolution by transforming it into the Terror. Even as it was, the\r\nrights of women were not without their champions even at this period. We\r\nought specially to remember Olympe de Gouges, whose name is sometimes\r\ndismissed too contemptuously. With all her defects of character and\r\neducation and literary style, Olympe de Gouges, as is now becoming\r\nrecognized, was, in her biographer's words, \"one of the loftiest and\r\nmost generous souls of the epoch,\" in some respects superior to Madame\r\nRoland. She was the first woman to demand of the Revolution that it\r\nshould be logical by proclaiming the rights of woman side by side with\r\nthose of her equal, man, and in so doing she became the great pioneer of\r\nthe feminist movement of to-day.[53] She owes the position more\r\nespecially to her little pamphlet, issued in 1791, entitled _Declaration\r\ndes Droits de la Femme_. It is this _Declaration_ which contains the\r\noft-quoted (or misquoted) saying: \"Women have the right to ascend the\r\nscaffold; they must also have the right to ascend the tribune.\" Two\r\nyears later she had herself ascended the scaffold, but the other right\r\nshe claimed is only now beginning to be granted to women. At that time\r\nthere were too many more pressing matters to be dealt with, and the only\r\nwomen who had been taught to demand the rights of their sex were\r\nprecisely those whom the Revolution was guillotining or exiling. Even\r\nhad it been otherwise, we may be quite sure that Napoleon, the heir of\r\nthe Revolution and the final arbiter of what was to be permanent in its\r\nachievements, would have sternly repressed any political freedom\r\naccorded to women. The only freedom he cared to grant to women was the\r\nfreedom to produce food for cannon, and so far as lay in his power he\r\nsought to crush the political activities of women even in literature, as\r\nwe see in his treatment of Mme de Stael.[54]\r\n\r\nAn Englishwoman of genius was in Paris at the time of the Revolution,\r\nwith as broad a conception of the place of woman side by side with man\r\nas Olympe de Gouges, while for the most part she was Olympe's superior.\r\nIn 1792, a year after the _Declaration des Droits de la Femme_, Mary\r\nWollstonecraft--it is possible to some extent inspired by the brief\r\n_Declaration_--published her _Vindication of the Rights of Women_. It\r\nwas not a shrill outcry, nor an attack on men--in that indeed\r\nresembling the _Declaration_--but just the book of a woman, a wise and\r\nsensible woman, who discusses many women's questions from a woman's\r\npoint of view, and desires civil and political rights, not as a panacea\r\nfor all evils, but simply because, as she argues, humanity cannot\r\nprogress as a whole while one half of it is semi-educated and only half\r\nfree. There can be little doubt that if the later advocates of woman's\r\nsuffrage could have preserved more of Mary Wollstonecraft's sanity,\r\nmoderation, and breadth of outlook, they would have diminished the\r\ndifficulties that beset the task of convincing the community generally.\r\nMary Wollstonecraft was, however, the inspired pioneer of a great\r\nmovement which slowly gained force and volume.[55] During the long\r\nVictorian period the practical aims of this movement went chiefly into\r\nthe direction of improving the education of girls so as to make it, so\r\nfar as possible, like that of boys. In this matter an immense revolution\r\nwas slowly accomplished, involving the entrance of women into various\r\nprofessions and employments hitherto reserved to men. That was a very\r\nnecessary preliminary to the extension of the franchise to women. The\r\nsuffrage propaganda could not, moreover, fail to benefit by the better\r\neducation of women and their increased activity in public life. It was\r\ntheir activity, indeed, far more than the skill of the women who fought\r\nfor the franchise, which made the political emancipation of women\r\ninevitable, and the noble and brilliant women who through the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century recreated the educational system for women, and\r\nso prepared them to play their proper part in life, were the best women\r\nworkers the cause of women's enfranchisement ever had. There was,\r\nhowever, one distinguished friend of the emancipation of women whose\r\nadvocacy of the cause at this period was of immense value. It is now\r\nnearly half a century since John Stuart Mill--inspired, like Thompson,\r\nby a woman--wrote his _Subjection of Women_, and it may undoubtedly be\r\nsaid that since that date no book on this subject published in any\r\ncountry--with the single exception of Bebel's _Woman_--has been so\r\nwidely read or so influential. The support of this distinguished and\r\nauthoritative thinker gave to the woman's movement a stamp of\r\naristocratic intellectuality very valuable in a land where even the\r\nfinest minds are apt to be afflicted by the disease of timidity, and was\r\ndoubtless a leading cause of the cordial reception which in England the\r\nidea of women's political emancipation has long received among\r\npoliticians. Bebel's book, speedily translated into English, furnished\r\nthe plebeian complement to Mill's.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the education of women and their introduction into\r\ncareers previously monopolized by men inevitably encouraged the movement\r\nfor extending the franchise to women. This political reform was\r\nremarkably successful in winning over the politicians, and not those of\r\none party only. In England, since Mill published his _Subjection of\r\nWomen_ in 1869, there have always been eminent statesmen convinced of\r\nthe desirability of granting the franchise to women, and among the rank\r\nand file of Members of Parliament, irrespective of party, a very large\r\nproportion have pledged themselves to the same cause. The difficulty,\r\ntherefore, in introducing woman's suffrage into England has not been\r\nprimarily in Parliament. The one point, at which political party feeling\r\nhas caused obstruction--and it is certainly a difficult and important\r\npoint--is the method by which woman's suffrage should be introduced.\r\nEach party--Conservative, Liberal, Labour--naturally enough desires that\r\nthis great new voting force should first be applied at a point which\r\nwould not be likely to injure its own party interests. It is probable\r\nthat in each party the majority of the leaders are of opinion that the\r\nadmission of female voters is inevitable and perhaps desirable; the\r\ndispute is as to the extent to which the floodgates should in the first\r\nplace be opened. In accordance with English tradition, some kind of\r\ncompromise, however illogical, suggests itself as the safest first step,\r\nbut the dispute remains as to the exact class of women who should be\r\nfirst admitted and the exact extent to which entrance should be granted\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThe dispute of the gate-keepers would, however, be easily overcome if\r\nthe pressure behind the gate were sufficiently strong. But it is not.\r\nHowever large a proportion of the voters in Great Britain may be in\r\nfavour of women's franchise, it is certain that only a very minute\r\npercentage regard this as a question having precedency over all other\r\nquestions. And the reason why men have only taken a very temperate\r\ninterest in woman's suffrage is that women themselves, in the mass, have\r\ntaken an equally temperate interest in the matter when they have not\r\nbeen actually hostile to the movement. It may indeed be said, even at\r\nthe present time, that whenever an impartial poll is taken of a large\r\nmiscellaneous group of women, only a minority are found to be in favour\r\nof woman's suffrage.[56] No significant event has occurred to stimulate\r\ngeneral interest in the matter, and no supremely eloquent or influential\r\nvoice has artificially stirred it. There has been no woman of Mary\r\nWollstonecraft's genius and breadth of mind who has devoted herself to\r\nthe cause, and since Mill the men who have made up their minds on this\r\nside have been content to leave the matter to the women's associations\r\nformed for securing the success of the cause. These associations have,\r\nhowever, been led by women of a past generation, who, while of\r\nunquestionable intellectual power and high moral character, have viewed\r\nthe woman question in a somewhat narrow, old-fashioned spirit, and have\r\nnot possessed the gift of inspiring enthusiasm. Thus the growth of the\r\nmovement, however steady it may have been, has been slow. John Stuart\r\nMill's remark, in a letter to Bain in 1869, remains true to-day: \"The\r\nmost important thing women have to do is to stir up the zeal of women\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile in some other countries where, except in the United\r\nStates, it was of much more recent growth, the woman's suffrage movement\r\nhas achieved success, with no great expenditure of energy. It has been\r\nintroduced into several American States and Territories. It is\r\nestablished throughout Australasia. It is also established in Norway. In\r\nFinland women may not only vote, but also sit in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt was in these conditions that the Women's Social and Political Union\r\nwas formed in London. It was not an offshoot from any existing woman's\r\nsuffrage society, but represented a crystallization of new elements. For\r\nthe most part, even its leaders had not previously taken any active part\r\nin the movement for woman's suffrage. The suffrage movement had need of\r\nexactly such an infusion of fresh and ardent blood; so that the new\r\nsociety was warmly welcomed, and met with immediate success, finding\r\nrecruits alike among the rich and the poor. Its unconventional methods,\r\nits eager and militant spirit, were felt to supply a lacking element,\r\nand the first picturesque and dashing exploits of the Union were on the\r\nwhole well received. The obvious sincerity and earnestness of these very\r\nfresh recruits covered the rashness of their new and rather ignorant\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBut a hasty excess of ardour only befits a first uncalculated outburst\r\nof youthfulness. It is quite another matter when it is deliberately\r\nhardened into a rigid routine, and becomes an organized method of\r\ncreating disorder for the purpose of advertising a grievance in season\r\nand out of season. Since, moreover, the attack was directed chiefly\r\nagainst politicians, precisely that class of the community most inclined\r\nto be favourable to woman's suffrage, the wrong-headedness of the\r\nmovement becomes as striking as its offensiveness.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the early friends of the new movement was inevitable.\r\nSome, who had hailed it with enthusiasm and proclaimed its pioneers as\r\nnew Joans of Arc, changed their tone to expostulation and protest, and\r\nfinally relapsed into silence. Other friends of the movement, even among\r\nits former leaders, were less silent. They have revealed to the world,\r\ntoo unkindly, some of the influences which slowly corrupt such a\r\nmovement from the inside when it hardens into sectarianism: the\r\nnarrowing of aim, the increase of conventionality, the jealousy of\r\nrivals, the tendency to morbid emotionalism.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to exaggerate the misdeeds and the weaknesses of the\r\nsuffragettes. It is undoubtedly true that they have alienated, in an\r\nincreasing degree, the sympathies of the women of highest character and\r\nbest abilities among the advocates of woman's suffrage. Nearly all\r\nEnglishwomen to-day who stand well above the average in mental\r\ndistinction are in favour of woman's suffrage, though they may not\r\nalways be inclined to take an active part in securing it. Perhaps the\r\nonly prominent exception is Mrs. Humphry Ward. Yet they rarely associate\r\nthemselves with the methods of the suffragettes. They do not, indeed,\r\nprotest, for they feel there would be a kind of disloyalty in fighting\r\nagainst the Extreme Left of a movement to which they themselves belong;\r\nbut they stand aloof. The women who are chiefly attracted to the ranks\r\nof the suffragettes belong to three classes: (1) Those of the well-to-do\r\nclass with no outlet for their activities, who eagerly embrace an\r\nexciting occupation which has become, not only highly respectable, but\r\neven, in a sense, fashionable; they have no natural tendency to excess,\r\nbut are easily moved by their social environment; some of these are\r\nrich, and the great principle--once formulated in an unhappy moment\r\nconcerning a rich lady interested in social reform--\"We must not kill\r\nthe goose that lays the golden eggs,\" has never been despised by the\r\nsuffragette leaders; (2) the rowdy element among women which is not so\r\nmuch moved to adopt the methods for the sake of the cause as to adopt\r\nthe cause for the sake of the methods, so that in the case of their\r\nspecial emotional temperament it may be said, reversing an ancient\r\nphrase, that the means justify the end; this element of noisy\r\nexplosiveness, always found in a certain proportion of women, though\r\nlatent under ordinary circumstances, is easily aroused by stimulation,\r\nand in every popular revolt the wildest excesses are the acts of women.\r\n(3) In this small but important group we find women of rare and\r\nbeautiful character who, hypnotized by the enthralling influence of an\r\nidea, and often having no great intellectual power of their own, are\r\neven unconscious of the vulgarity that accompanies them, and gladly\r\nsacrifice themselves to a cause that seems to be sacred; these are the\r\nsaints and martyrs of every movement.\r\n\r\nWhen we thus analyse the suffragette outburst we see that it is really\r\ncompounded out of quite varied elements: a conventionally respectable\r\nelement, a rowdy element, and an ennobling element. It is, therefore,\r\nequally unreasonable to denounce its vices or to idealize its virtues.\r\nIt is more profitable to attempt to balance its services and its\r\ndisservices to the cause of women's suffrage.\r\n\r\nLooked at dispassionately, the two main disadvantages of the suffragette\r\nagitation--and they certainly seem at the first glance very\r\ncomprehensive objections--lie in its direction and in its methods. There\r\nare two vast bodies of people who require to be persuaded in order to\r\nsecure woman's suffrage: first women themselves, and secondly their\r\nmen-folk, who at present monopolize the franchise. Until the majority of\r\nboth men and women are educated to understand the justice and\r\nreasonableness of this step, and until men are persuaded that the time\r\nhas come for practical action, the most violent personal assaults on\r\ncabinet ministers--supposing such political methods to be otherwise\r\nunobjectionable--are beside the mark. They are aimed in the wrong\r\ndirection. This is so even when we leave aside the fact that\r\npoliticians are sufficiently converted already. The primary task of\r\nwomen suffragists is to convert their own sex. Indeed it may be said\r\nthat that is their whole task. Whenever the majority of women are\r\npersuaded that they ought to possess the vote, we may be quite sure that\r\nthey will communicate that persuasion to their men-folk who are able to\r\ngive them the vote. The conversion of the majority of women to a belief\r\nin women's suffrage is essential to its attainment because it is only by\r\nthe influence of the women who belong to him, whom he knows and loves\r\nand respects, that the average man is likely to realize that, as Ellen\r\nKey puts it, \"a ballot paper in itself no more injures the delicacy of a\r\nwoman's hand than a cooking recipe.\" The antics of women in the street,\r\nhowever earnest those women may be, only leave him indifferent, even\r\nhostile, at most, amused.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that in any case it would be undesirable, even if\r\npossible, to bestow the suffrage on women so long as only a minority\r\nhave the wish to exercise it. It would be contrary to sound public\r\npolicy. It would not only discredit political rights, but it would tend\r\nto give the woman's vote too narrow and one-sided a character. To grant\r\nwomen the right to vote is a different matter from granting women the\r\nright to enter a profession. In order to give women the right to be\r\ndoctors or lawyers it is not necessary that women generally should be\r\nconvinced of the advantage of such a step. The matter chiefly concerns\r\nthe very small number of women who desire the privilege. But the women\r\nwho vote will be in some measure legislating for women generally, and it\r\nis therefore necessary that women generally should participate.\r\n\r\nBut even if it is admitted--although, as we have seen, there is a\r\ntwofold reason for not making such an admission--that the suffragettes\r\nare justified in regarding politicians as the obstacles in the way of\r\ntheir demands, there still remains the question of the disadvantage of\r\ntheir method. This method is by some euphemistically described as the\r\nintroduction of \"nagging\" into politics; but even at this mild estimate\r\nof its character the question may still be asked whether the method is\r\ncalculated to attain the desired end. One hears women suffragettes\r\ndeclare that this is the only kind of argument men understand. There is,\r\nhowever, in the masculine mind--and by no means least when it is\r\nBritish--an element which strongly objects to be worried and bullied\r\neven into a good course of action. The suffragettes have done their best\r\nto stimulate that element of obstinacy. Even among men who viewed the\r\nmatter from an unprejudiced standpoint many felt that, necessary as\r\nwoman's suffrage is, the policy of the suffragettes rendered the moment\r\nunfavourable for its adoption. It is a significant fact that in the\r\ncountries which have so far granted women the franchise no methods in\r\nthe slightest degree resembling those of the suffragettes have ever been\r\npractised. It is not easy to imagine Australia tolerating such methods,\r\nand in Finland full Parliamentary rights were freely granted, as is\r\ngenerally recognized, precisely as a mark of gratitude for women's\r\nhelpfulness in standing side by side with their men in a great political\r\nstruggle. The policy of obstruction adopted by the English suffragettes,\r\nwith its \"tactics\" of opposing at election times the candidates of the\r\nvery party whose leaders they are imploring to grant them the franchise,\r\nwas so foolish that it is little wonder that many doubted whether women\r\nat all understand the methods of politics, or are yet fitted to take a\r\nresponsible part in political life.\r\n\r\nThe suffragette method of persuading public men seems to be, on the\r\nwhole, futile, even if it were directed at the proper quarter, and even\r\nif it were in itself a justifiable method. But it would be possible to\r\ngrant these \"ifs\" and still to feel that a serious injury is done to the\r\ncause of woman's suffrage when the method of violence is adopted by\r\nwomen. Some suffragettes have argued, in this matter, that in political\r\ncrises men also have acted just as badly or worse. But, even if we\r\nassume that this is the case,[57] it has been one of the chief arguments\r\nhitherto for the admission of women into political life that they\r\nexercise an elevating and refining influence, so that their entrance\r\ninto this field will serve to purify politics. That, no doubt, is an\r\nargument mostly brought forward by men, and may be regarded as, in some\r\nmeasure, an amiable masculine delusion, since most of the refining and\r\nelevating elements in civilization probably owe their origin not to\r\nwomen but to men. But it is not altogether a delusion. In the virtues of\r\nforce--however humbly those virtues are to be classed--women, as a sex,\r\ncan never be the rivals of men, and when women attempt to gain their\r\nends by the demonstration of brute force they can only place themselves\r\nat a disadvantage. They are laying down the weapons they know best how\r\nto use, and adopting weapons so unsuitable that they only injure the\r\nusers.\r\n\r\nMany women, speaking on behalf of the suffragettes, protest against the\r\nidea that women must always be \"charming.\" And if \"charm\" is to be\r\nunderstood in so narrow and conventionalized a sense that it means\r\nsomething which is incompatible with the developed natural activities,\r\nwhether of the soul or of the body, then such a protest is amply\r\njustified. But in the larger sense, \"charm\"--which means the power to\r\neffect work without employing brute force--is indispensable to women.\r\nCharm is a woman's strength just as strength is a man's charm. And the\r\njustification for women in this matter is that herein they represent the\r\nprogress of civilization. All civilization involves the substitution in\r\nthis respect of the woman's method for the man's. In the last resort a\r\nsavage can only assert his rights by brute force. But with the growth of\r\ncivilization the wronged man, instead of knocking down his opponent,\r\nemploys \"charm\"; in other words he engages an advocate, who, by the\r\nexercise of sweet reasonableness, persuades twelve men in a box that\r\nhis wrongs must be righted, and the matter is then finally settled, not\r\nby man's weapon, the fist, but by woman's weapon, the tongue. Nowadays\r\nthe same method of \"charm\" is being substituted for brute force in\r\ninternational wrongs, and with the complete substitution of arbitration\r\nfor war the woman's method of charm will have replaced the man's method\r\nof brute force along the whole line of legitimate human activity. If we\r\nrealize this we can understand why it is that a group of women who, even\r\nin the effort to support a good cause, revert to the crude method of\r\nviolence are committing a double wrong. They are wronging their own sex\r\nby proving false to its best traditions, and they are wronging\r\ncivilization by attempting to revive methods of savagery which it is\r\ncivilization's mission to repress. Therefore it may fairly be held that\r\neven if the methods of the suffragettes were really adequate to secure\r\nwomen's suffrage, the attainment of the franchise by those methods would\r\nbe a misfortune. The ultimate loss would be greater than the gain.\r\n\r\nIf we hold the foregoing considerations in mind it is difficult to avoid\r\nthe conclusion that neither in their direction nor in their nature are\r\nthe methods of the suffragettes fitted to attain the end desired. We\r\nhave still, however, to consider the other side of the question.\r\n\r\nWhenever an old movement receives a strong infusion of new blood,\r\nwhatever excesses or mistakes may arise, it is very unlikely that all\r\nthe results will be on the same side. It is certainly not so in this\r\ncase. Even the opposition to woman's suffrage which the suffragettes\r\nare responsible for, and the Anti-Suffrage societies which they have\r\ncalled into active existence, are not an unmitigated disadvantage. Every\r\nmovement of progress requires a vigorous movement of opposition to\r\nstimulate its progress, and the clash of discussion can only be\r\nbeneficial in the end to the progressive cause.\r\n\r\nBut the immense advantage of the activity of the suffragettes has been\r\nindirect. It has enabled the great mass of ordinary sensible women who\r\nneither join Suffrage societies nor Anti-Suffrage societies to think for\r\nthemselves on this question. Until a few years ago, while most educated\r\nwomen were vaguely aware of the existence of a movement for giving women\r\nthe vote, they only knew of it as something rather unpractical and\r\nremote; its reality had never been brought home to them. When women\r\nwitnessed the eruption into the streets of a band of women--most of them\r\napparently women much like themselves--who were so convinced that the\r\nfranchise must be granted to women, here and now, that they were\r\nprepared to face publicity, ridicule, and even imprisonment, then \"votes\r\nfor women\" became to them, for the first time, a real and living issue.\r\nIn a great many cases, certainly, they realized that they intensely\r\ndisliked the people who behaved in this way and any cause that was so\r\npreached. But in a great many other cases they realized, for the first\r\ntime definitely, that the demand of votes for women was a reasonable\r\ndemand, and that they were themselves suffragists, though they had no\r\nwish to take an active part in the movement, and no real sympathy with\r\nits more \"militant\" methods. There can be no doubt that in this way the\r\nsuffragettes have performed an immense service for the cause of women's\r\nsuffrage. It has been for the most part an indirect and undesigned\r\nservice, but in the end it will perhaps more than serve to\r\ncounterbalance the disadvantages attached to their more conscious\r\nmethods and their more deliberate aims.\r\n\r\nIf, as we may trust, this service will be the main outcome of the\r\nsuffragette phase of the women's movement, it is an outcome to be\r\nthankful for; we may then remember with gratitude the ardent enthusiasm\r\nof the suffragettes and forget the foolish and futile ways in which it\r\nwas manifested. There has never been any doubt as to the ultimate\r\nadoption of women's suffrage; its gradual extension among the more\r\nprogressive countries of the world sufficiently indicates that it will\r\nultimately reach even to the most backward countries. Its accomplishment\r\nin England has been gradual, although it is here so long since the first\r\nsteps were taken, not because there has been some special and malignant\r\nopposition to it on the part of men in general and politicians in\r\nparticular, but simply because England is an old and conservative\r\ncountry, with a very ancient constitutional machinery which effectually\r\nguards against the hasty realization of any scheme of reform. This\r\nparticular reform, however, is not an isolated or independent scheme; it\r\nis an essential part of a great movement in the social equalization of\r\nthe sexes which has been going on for centuries in our civilization, a\r\nmovement such as may be correspondingly traced in the later stages of\r\nthe civilizations of antiquity. Such a movement we may by our efforts\r\nhelp forward, we may for a while retard, but it is a part of\r\ncivilization, and it would be idle to imagine that we can affect the\r\nultimate issue.\r\n\r\nThat the issue of women's suffrage may be reached in England within a\r\nreasonable period is much to be desired for the sake of the woman's\r\nmovement in the larger sense, which has nothing to do with politics, and\r\nis now impeded by this struggle. The enfranchisement of women, Miss\r\nFrances Cobbe declared thirty years ago, is \"the crown and completion\"\r\nof all progress in women's movement. \"Votes for women,\" exclaims, more\r\nyouthfully but not less unreasonably, Miss Christabel Pankhurst, \"means\r\na new Heaven and a new Earth.\" But women's suffrage no more means a new\r\nHeaven or even a new Earth than it means, as other people fear, a new\r\nPurgatory and a new Hell. We may see this quite plainly in Australasia.\r\nWomen's votes aid in furthering social legislation and contribute to the\r\npassing of acts which have their good side, and, no doubt, like\r\neverything else, their bad side. As Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who devoted\r\nher life to the political enfranchisement of women, declared, the ballot\r\nis, at most, only the vestibule to women's emancipation. Man's suffrage\r\nhas not introduced the millennium, and it is foolish to suppose that\r\nwoman's suffrage can. It is merely an act of justice and a reasonable\r\ncondition of social hygiene.\r\n\r\nThe attainment of the suffrage, if it is a beginning and not an end,\r\nwill thus have a real and positive value in liberating the woman's\r\nmovement from a narrow and sterilizing phase of its course. In England,\r\nespecially, the woman's movement has in the past largely confined itself\r\nto imitating men and to obtaining the same work and the same rights as\r\nmen. Putting the matter more broadly, it may be said that it has been\r\nthe aim of the woman's movement to secure woman's claims as a human\r\nbeing rather than as woman. But that is only half the task of the\r\nwoman's movement, and perhaps not the most essential half. Women can\r\nnever be like men, any more than men can be like women. It is their\r\nunlikeness which renders them indispensable to each other, and which\r\nalso makes it imperative that each sex should have its due share in\r\nmoulding the conditions of life. Woman's function in life can never be\r\nthe same as man's, if only because women are the mothers of the race.\r\nThat is the point, the only point, at which women have an uncontested\r\nsupremacy over men. The most vital problem before our civilization\r\nto-day is the problem of motherhood, the question of creating the human\r\nbeings best fitted for modern life, the practical realization of a sound\r\neugenics. Manouvrier, the distinguished anthropologist, who carries\r\nfeminism to its extreme point in the scientific sphere, yet recognizes\r\nthe fundamental fact that \"a woman's part is to make children.\" But he\r\nclearly perceives also that \"in all its extent and all its consequences\r\nthat part is not surpassed in importance, in difficulty, or in dignity,\r\nby the man's part.\" On the contrary it is a part which needs \"an amount\r\nof intelligence incontestably superior, and by far, to that required by\r\nmost masculine occupations.\"[58] We are here at the core of the woman's\r\nmovement. And the full fruition of that movement means that women, by\r\nvirtue of their supremacy in this matter, shall take their proper share\r\nin legislation for life, not as mere sexless human beings, but as women,\r\nand in accordance with the essential laws of their own nature as women.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThere is a further question. Is it possible to discern the actual\r\nembodiment of this new phase of the woman movement? I think it is.\r\n\r\nTo those who are accustomed to watch the emotional pulse of mankind,\r\nnothing has seemed so remarkable during recent years as the eruption of\r\nsex questions in Germany. We had always been given to understand that\r\nthe sphere of women and the laws of marriage had been definitely\r\nprescribed and fixed in Germany for at least two thousand years, since\r\nthe days of Tacitus, in fact, and with the best possible results.\r\nGermans assured the world in stentorian tones that only in Germany could\r\nyoung womanhood be seen in all its purity, and that in the German\r\n_Hausfrau_ the supreme ideal had been reached, the woman whose great\r\nmission is to keep alive the perennial fire of the ancient German\r\nhearth. Here and there, indeed, the quiet voice of science was heard in\r\nGermany; thus Schrader, the distinguished investigator of Teutonic\r\norigins, in commenting on the oft-quoted testimony of Tacitus to the\r\nchastity of the German women, has appositely referred to the detailed\r\nevidences furnished by the Committee of pastors of the Evangelical\r\nChurch as to the extreme prevalence of unchastity among the women of\r\nrural Germany, and argued that these widespread customs must be very\r\nancient and deep-rooted.[59] But Germans in general refused to admit that\r\nTacitus had only used the idea of German virtue as a stick to beat his\r\nown fellow-countrywomen with.\r\n\r\nThe Social-Democratic movement, which has so largely overspread\r\nindustrial and even intellectual Germany, prepared the way for a less\r\ntraditional and idealistic way of feeling in regard to these questions.\r\nThe publication by Bebel of a book, _Die Frau_, in which the leader of\r\nthe German Social-Democratic party set forth the Socialist doctrine of\r\nthe position of women in society, marked the first stage in the new\r\nmovement. This book exercised a wide influence, more especially on\r\nuncritical readers. It is, indeed, from a scientific point of view a\r\nworthless book--if a book in which genuine emotions are brought to the\r\ncause of human freedom and social righteousness may ever be so\r\ntermed--but it struck a rude blow at the traditions of Teutonic\r\nsentiment. With something of the rough tone and temper of the great\r\npeasant who initiated the German Reformation, a man who had himself\r\nsprung from the people, and who knew of what he was speaking, here set\r\ndown in downright fashion the actual facts as to the position of women\r\nin Germany, as well as what he conceived to be the claims of justice in\r\nregard to that position, slashing with equal vigour alike at the\r\nabsurdities of conventional marriage and of prostitution, the obverse\r\nand the reverse, he declared, of a false society. The emotional\r\nrenaissance with which we are here concerned seems to have no special\r\nand certainly no exclusive association with the Social-Democratic\r\nmovement, but it can scarcely be doubted that the permeation of a great\r\nmass of the German people by the socialistic conceptions which in their\r\nbearing on women have been rendered so familiar by Bebel's exposition\r\nhas furnished, as it were, a ready-made sounding-board which has given\r\nresonance and effect to voices which might otherwise have been quickly\r\nlost in vacuity.\r\n\r\nThere is another movement which counts for something in the renaissance\r\nwe are here concerned with, though for considerably less than one might\r\nbe led to expect. What is specifically known as the \"woman's rights'\r\nmovement\" is in no degree native to Germany, though Hippel is one of the\r\npioneers of the woman's movement, and it is only within recent years\r\nthat it has reached Germany. It is alien to the Teutonic feminine mind,\r\nbecause in Germany the spheres of men and women are so far apart and so\r\nunlike that the ideal of imitating men fails to present itself to a\r\nGerman woman's mind. The delay, moreover, in the arrival of the woman's\r\nmovement in Germany had given time for a clearer view of that movement\r\nand a criticism of its defects to form even in the lands of its origin,\r\nso that the German woman can no longer be caught unawares by the cry for\r\nwoman's rights. Still, however qualified a view might be taken of its\r\nbenefits, it had to be recognized, even in Germany, that it was an\r\ninevitable movement, and to some extent at all events indispensable from\r\nthe woman's point of view. The same right to education as men, the same\r\nrights of public meeting and discussion, the same liberty to enter the\r\nliberal professions, these are claims which during recent years have\r\nbeen widely made by German women and to some extent secured, while--as\r\nis even more significant--they are for the most part no longer very\r\nenergetically disputed. The International Congress of Women which met in\r\nBerlin in 1904 was a revelation to the citizens of Berlin of the skill\r\nand dignity with which women could organize a congress and conduct\r\nbusiness meetings. It was notable, moreover, in that, though under the\r\nauspices of an International Council, it showed the large number of\r\nGerman women who are already entitled to take a leading part in the\r\nmovements for women's welfare. Both directly and indirectly, indeed,\r\nsuch a movement cannot be otherwise than specially beneficial in\r\nGermany. The Teutonic reverence for woman, the assertion of the \"aliquid\r\ndivinum,\" has sometimes been accompanied by the openly expressed\r\nconviction that she is a fool. Outside Germany it would not be easy to\r\nfind the representative philosophers of a nation putting forward so\r\ncontemptuous a view of women as is set forth by Schopenhauer or by\r\nNietzsche, while even within recent years a German physician of some\r\nability, the late Dr. Moebius, published a book on the \"physiological\r\nweak-mindedness of women.\"\r\n\r\nThe new feminine movement in Germany has received highly important\r\nsupport from the recent development of German science. The German\r\nintellect, exceedingly comprehensive in its outlook, ploddingly\r\nthorough, and imperturbably serious, has always taken the leading and\r\npioneering part in the investigation of sexual problems, whether from\r\nthe standpoint of history, biology, or pathology. Early in the\r\nnineteenth century, when even more courage and resolution were needed to\r\nface the scientific study of such questions than is now the case, German\r\nphysicians, unsupported by any co-operation in other countries, were the\r\npioneers in exploring the paths of sexual pathology.[60] From the\r\nantiquarian side, Bachofen, more than half a century ago, put forth his\r\nconception of the exalted position of the primitive mother which,\r\nalthough it has been considerably battered by subsequent research, has\r\nbeen by no means without its value, and is of special significance from\r\nthe present standpoint, because it sprang from precisely the same view\r\nof life as that animating the German women who are to-day inaugurating\r\nthe movement we are here concerned with. From the medical side the late\r\nProfessor Krafft-Ebing of Vienna and Dr. Albert Moll of Berlin are\r\nrecognized throughout the world as leading authorities on sexual\r\npathology, and in recent times many other German physicians of the first\r\nauthority can be named in this field; while in Austria Dr. F.S. Krauss\r\nand his coadjutors in the annual volumes of _Anthropophyteia_ are\r\ndiligently exploring the rich and fruitful field of sexual folk-lore.\r\nThe large volumes of the _Jahrbuch fuer Sexuelle Zwischenstufen_, edited\r\nby Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld of Berlin, have presented discussions of the\r\ncommonest of sexual aberrations with a scientific and scholarly\r\nthoroughness, a practical competence, as well as admirable tone, which\r\nwe may seek in vain in other countries. In Vienna, moreover, Professor\r\nFreud, with his bold and original views on the sexual causation of many\r\nabnormal mental and nervous conditions, and his psycho-analytic method\r\nof investigating and treating them, although his doctrines are by no\r\nmeans universally accepted, is yet exerting a revolutionary influence\r\nall over the world. During the last ten years, indeed, the amount of\r\nGerman scientific and semi-scientific literature, dealing with every\r\naspect of the sexual question, and from every point of view, is\r\naltogether unparalleled. It need scarcely be said that much of this\r\nliterature is superficial or worthless. But much of it is sound, and it\r\nwould seem that on the whole it is this portion of it which is most\r\npopular. Thus Dr. August Forel, formerly professor of psychiatry at\r\nZurich and a physician of world-wide reputation, published a few years\r\nago at Munich a book on the sexual question, _Die Sexuelle Frage_, in\r\nwhich all the questions of the sexual life, biological, medical, and\r\nsocial, are seriously discussed with no undue appeal to an ignorant\r\npublic; it had an immediate success and a large sale. Dr. Forel had not\r\nentered this field before; he had merely come to the conclusion that\r\nevery man at the end of his life ought to set forth his observations and\r\nconclusions regarding the most vital of questions. Again, at about the\r\nsame time, Dr. Iwan Bloch, of Berlin, published his many-sided work on\r\nthe sexual life of our time, _Das Sexualleben Unserer Zeit_, a work less\r\nremarkable than Forel's for the weight of the personal authority\r\nexpressed, but more remarkable by the range of its learning and the\r\nsympathetic attitude it displayed towards the best movements of the day;\r\nthis book also met with great success.[61] Still more recently (1912) Dr.\r\nAlbert Moll, with characteristic scientific thoroughness, has edited,\r\nand largely himself written, a truly encyclopaedic _Handbuch der\r\nSexualwissenschaften_. The eminence of the writers of these books and\r\nthe mental calibre needed to read them suffice to show that we are not\r\nconcerned, as a careless observer might suppose, with a matter of supply\r\nand demand in prurient literature, but with the serious and widespread\r\nappreciation of serious investigations. This same appreciation is shown\r\nnot only by several bio-sociological periodicals of high scientific\r\nquality, but by the existence of a journal like _Sexual-Probleme_,\r\nedited by Dr. Max Marcuse, a journal with many distinguished\r\ncontributors, and undoubtedly the best periodical in this field to be\r\nfound in any language.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the new movement of German women, however it may arise\r\nfrom or be supported by political or scientific movements, is\r\nfundamentally emotional in its character. If we think of it, every great\r\nmovement of the Teutonic soul has been rooted in emotion. The German\r\nliterary renaissance of the eighteenth century was emotional in its\r\norigin and received its chief stimulus from the contagion of the new\r\nirruption of sentiment in France. Even German science is often\r\ninfluenced, and not always to its advantage, by German sentiment. The\r\nReformation is an example on a huge scale of the emotional force which\r\nunderlies German movements. Luther, for good and for evil, is the most\r\ntypical of Germans, and the Luther who made his mark in the world--the\r\nshrewd, coarse, superstitious peasant who blossomed into genius--was an\r\navalanche of emotion, a great mass of natural human instincts\r\nirresistible in their impetuosity. When we bear in mind this general\r\ntendency to emotional expansiveness in the manifestations of the\r\nTeutonic soul we need feel no surprise that the present movement among\r\nGerman women should be, to a much greater extent than the corresponding\r\nmovements in other countries, an emotional renaissance. It is not, first\r\nand last, a cry for political rights, but for emotional rights, and for\r\nthe reasonable regulation of all those social functions which are\r\nfounded on the emotions.[62]\r\n\r\nThis movement, although it may properly be said to be German, since its\r\nmanifestations are mainly exhibited in the great German Empire, is yet\r\nessentially a Teutonic movement in the broader sense of the word.\r\nGermans of Austria, Germans of Switzerland, Dutch women, Scandinavians,\r\nhave all been drawn into this movement. But it is in Germany proper that\r\nthey all find the chief field of their activities.\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to define in a single sentence the specific object of this\r\nagitation we may best describe it as based on the demands of woman the\r\nmother, and as directed to the end of securing for her the right to\r\ncontrol and regulate the personal and social relations which spring from\r\nher nature as mother or possible mother. Therein we see at once both the\r\nintimately emotional and practical nature of this new claim and its\r\ndecisive unlikeness to the earlier woman movement. That was definitely a\r\ndemand for emancipation; political enfranchisement was its goal; its\r\nperpetual assertion was that women must be allowed to do everything\r\nthat men do. But the new Teutonic woman's movement, so far from making\r\nas its ideal the imitation of men, bases itself on that which most\r\nessentially marks the woman as unlike the man.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the movement is significantly indicated by the title,\r\n_Mutterschutz_--the protection of the mother--originally borne by \"a\r\nJournal for the reform of sexual morals,\" established in 1905, edited by\r\nDr. Helene Stoecker, of Berlin, and now called _Die Neue Generation_. All\r\nthe questions that radiate outwards from the maternal function are here\r\ndiscussed: the ethics of love, prostitution ancient and modern, the\r\nposition of illegitimate mothers and illegitimate children, sexual\r\nhygiene, the sexual instruction of the young, etc. It must not be\r\nsupposed that these matters are dealt with from the standpoint of a\r\nvigilance society for combating vice. The demand throughout is for the\r\nregulation of life, for reform, but for reform quite as much in the\r\ndirection of expansion as of restraint. On many matters of detail,\r\nindeed, there is no agreement among these writers, some of whom approach\r\nthe problems from the social and practical side, some from the\r\npsychological and philosophic side, others from the medical, legal, or\r\nhistorical sides.\r\n\r\nThis journal was originally the organ of the association for the\r\nprotection of mothers, more especially unmarried mothers, called the\r\n_Bund fuer Mutterschutz_. There are many agencies for dealing with\r\nillegitimate children, but the founders of this association started from\r\nthe conviction that it is only through the mother that the child can be\r\nadequately cared for. As nearly a tenth of the children born in Germany\r\nare illegitimate, and the conditions of life into which such children\r\nare thrown are in the highest degree unfavourable, the question has its\r\nactuality.[63] It is the aim of the _Bund fuer Mutterschutz_ to\r\nrehabilitate the unmarried mother, to secure for her the conditions of\r\neconomic independence--whatever social class she may belong to--and\r\nultimately to effect a change in the legal status of illegitimate\r\nmothers and children alike. The Bund, which is directed by a committee\r\nin which social, medical, and legal interests are alike represented,\r\nalready possesses numerous branches, in addition to its head-quarters in\r\nBerlin, and is beginning to initiate practical measures on the lines of\r\nits programme, notably Homes for Mothers, of which it has established\r\nnearly a dozen in different parts of Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the first International Congress for the Protection of Mothers\r\nand for Sexual Reform was held at Dresden, in connection with the great\r\nExhibition of Hygiene. As a result of this Congress, an International\r\nUnion was constituted, representing Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, and\r\nHolland, which may probably be taken to be the countries which have so\r\nfar manifested greatest interest in the programme of sexual reform based\r\non recognition of the supreme importance of motherhood. This movement\r\nmay, therefore, be said to have overcome the initial difficulties, the\r\nantagonism, the misunderstanding, and the opprobrium, which every\r\nmovement in the field of sexual reform inevitably encounters, and often\r\nsuccumbs to.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to regard this Association as a merely\r\nphilanthropic movement. It claims to be \"An Association for the Reform\r\nof Sexual Ethics,\" and _Die Neue Generation_ deals with social and\r\nethical rather than with philanthropic questions. In these respects it\r\nreflects the present attitude of many thoughtful German women, though\r\nthe older school of women's rights advocates still holds aloof. We may\r\nhere, for instance, find a statement of the recent discussion\r\nconcerning the right of the mother to destroy her offspring before\r\nbirth. This has been boldly claimed for women by Countess Gisela von\r\nStreitberg, who advocates a return to the older moral view which\r\nprevailed not only in classic antiquity, but even, under certain\r\nconditions, in Christian practice, until Canon law, asserting that the\r\nembryo had from the first an independent life, pronounced abortion under\r\nall circumstances a crime. Countess von Streitberg takes the standpoint\r\nthat as the chief risks and responsibilities must necessarily rest upon\r\nthe woman, it is for her to decide whether she will permit the embryo\r\nshe bears to develop. Dr. Marie Raschke, taking up the discussion from\r\nthe legal side, is unable to agree that abortion should cease to be a\r\npunishable offence, though she advocates considerable modifications in\r\nthe law on this matter. Dr. Siegfried Weinberg, summarizing this\r\ndiscussion, again from the legal standpoint, considers that there is\r\nconsiderable right on the Countess's side, because from the modern\r\njuridical standpoint a criminal enactment is only justified because it\r\nprotects a right, and in law the embryo possesses no rights which can be\r\ninjured. From the moral standpoint, also, it is argued, its destruction\r\noften becomes justifiable in the interests of the community.\r\n\r\nThis debatable question, while instructive as an example of the radical\r\nmanner in which German women are now beginning to face moral questions,\r\ndeals only with an isolated point which has hardly yet reached the\r\nsphere of practical politics.[64] It is more interesting to consider the\r\ngeneral conceptions which underlie this movement, and we can hardly do\r\nthis better than by studying the writings of Ellen Key, who is not only\r\none of its recognized leaders, but may be said to present its aims and\r\nideals in a broader and more convinced manner than any other writer.\r\n\r\nEllen Key's views are mainly contained in three books, _Love and\r\nMarriage_, _The Century of the Child_, and _The Women's Movement_, in\r\nwhich form they enjoy a large circulation, and are now becoming well\r\nknown, through translations, in England and America. She carefully\r\ndistinguishes her aims from what she regards as the American conception\r\nof progress in woman's movements, that is to say the tendency for women\r\nto seek to capture the activities which may be much more adequately\r\nfulfilled by the other sex, while at the same time neglecting the far\r\nweightier matters that concern their own sex. Man and woman are not\r\nnatural enemies who need to waste their energies in fighting over their\r\nrespective rights and privileges; in spiritual as in physical life they\r\nare only fruitful together. Women, indeed, need free scope for their\r\nactivities--and the earlier aspirations of feminism are thus\r\njustified--but they need it, not to wrest away any tasks that men may be\r\nbetter fitted to perform, but to play their part in that field of\r\ncreative life which is peculiarly their own. Ellen Key would say that\r\nthe highest human unit is triune: father, mother, and child. Marriage,\r\ntherefore, instead of being, as it is to-day, the last thing to be\r\nthought of in education, becomes the central point of life. In Ellen\r\nKey's conception, \"those who love each other are man and wife,\" and by\r\nlove she means not a temporary inclination, but \"a synthesis of desire\r\nand friendship,\" just as the air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. It\r\nmust be this for both sexes alike, and Ellen Key sees a real progress in\r\nwhat seems to her the modern tendency for men to realize that the soul\r\nhas its erotic side, and for women to realize that the senses have. She\r\nhas no special sympathy with the cry for purity in masculine candidates\r\nfor marriage put forward by some women of the present day. She observes\r\nthat many men who have painfully struggled to maintain this ideal meet\r\nwith disillusion, for it is not the masculine lamb, but much more the\r\nspotted leopard, who fascinates women. The notion that women have higher\r\nmoral instincts than men Ellen Key regards as absurd. The majority of\r\nFrenchwomen, she remarks, were against Dreyfus, and the majority of\r\nEnglishwomen approved the South African war. The really fundamental\r\ndifference between man and woman is that he can usually give his best as\r\na creator, and she as a lover, that his value is according to his work\r\nand hers according to her love. And in love the demand for each sex\r\nalike must not be primarily for a mere anatomical purity, but for\r\npassion and for sincerity.\r\n\r\nThe aim of love, as understood by Ellen Key, is always marriage and the\r\nchild, and as soon as the child comes into question society and the\r\nState are concerned. Before fruition, love is a matter for the lovers\r\nalone, and the espionage, ceremony, and routine now permitted or\r\nenjoined are both ridiculous and offensive. \"The flower of love belongs\r\nto the lovers, and should remain their secret; it is the fruit of love\r\nwhich brings them into relation to society.\" The dominating importance\r\nof the child, the parent of the race to be, alone makes the immense\r\nsocial importance of sexual union. It is not marriage which sanctifies\r\ngeneration, but generation which sanctifies marriage. From the point of\r\nview of \"the sanctity of generation\" and the welfare of the race, Ellen\r\nKey looks forward to a time when it will be impossible for a man and\r\nwoman to become parents when they are unlikely to produce a healthy\r\nchild, though she is opposed to Neo-Malthusian methods, partly on\r\naesthetic grounds and partly on the more dubious grounds of doubt as to\r\ntheir practical efficiency; it is from this point of view also that she\r\nfavours sexual equality in matters of divorce, the legal assimilation of\r\nlegitimate and illegitimate children, the recognition of unions outside\r\nmarriage,--a recognition already legally established under certain\r\ncircumstances in Sweden, in such a way as to confer the rights of\r\nlegitimacy on the child,--and she is even prepared to advise women under\r\nsome conditions to become mothers outside marriage, though only when\r\nthere are obstacles to legal marriage, and as the outcome of deliberate\r\nwill and resolution. In these and many similar proposals in detail, set\r\nforth in her earlier books, it is clear that Ellen Key has sometimes\r\ngone beyond the mandate of her central conviction, that love is the\r\nfirst condition for increasing the vitality alike of the race and of the\r\nindividuality, and that the question of love, properly considered, is\r\nthe question of creating the future man. As she herself has elsewhere\r\nquite truly pointed out, practice must precede, and precede by a very\r\nlong time, the establishment of definite rules in matters of detail.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that a point with which Ellen Key and the leaders of\r\nthe new German woman's movement specially concern themselves is the\r\naffectional needs of the \"supernumerary\" woman and the legitimation of\r\nher children. There is an excess of women over men, in Germany as in\r\nmost other countries. That excess, it is said, is balanced by the large\r\nnumber of women who do not wish to marry. But that is too cheap a\r\nsolution of the question. Many women may wish to remain unmarried, but\r\nno woman wishes to be forced to remain unmarried. Every woman, these\r\nadvocates of the rights of women claim, has a right to motherhood, and\r\nin exercising the right under sound conditions she is benefiting\r\nsociety. But our marriage system, in the rigid form which it has long\r\nsince assumed, has not now the elasticity necessary to answer these\r\ndemands. It presents a solution which is often impossible, always\r\ndifficult, and perhaps in a large proportion of cases undesirable. But\r\nfor a woman who is shut out from marriage to grasp at the vital facts of\r\nlove and motherhood which she perhaps regards, unreasonably or not, as\r\nthe supreme things in the world, must often be under such conditions a\r\ndisastrous step, while it is always accompanied by certain risks.\r\nTherefore, it is asked, why should there not be, as of old there was, a\r\nrelationship established which while of less dignity than marriage, and\r\nless exclusive in its demands, should yet permit a woman to enter into\r\nan honourable, open, and legally recognized relationship with a man?\r\nSuch a relationship a woman could proclaim to the whole world, if\r\nnecessary, without reflecting any disesteem upon herself or her child,\r\nwhile it would give her a legal claim on her child's father. Such a\r\nrelationship would be substantially the same as the ancient concubinate,\r\nwhich persisted even in Christendom up to the sixteenth century. Its\r\nestablishment in Sweden has apparently been satisfactory, and it is now\r\nsought to extend it to other countries.[65]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare, or to contrast, the movement of which\r\nEllen Key has been a conspicuous champion with the futile movement\r\ninitiated nearly a century ago by the school of Saint-Simon and Prosper\r\nEnfantin, in favour of \"la femme libre.\"[66] That earlier movement had no\r\ndoubt its bright and ideal side, but it was not supported by a sound and\r\nscientific view of life; it was rooted in sand and soon withered up. The\r\nkind of freedom which Ellen Key advocates is not a freedom to dispense\r\nwith law and order, but rather a freedom to recognize and follow true\r\nlaw; it is the freedom which in morals as well as in politics is\r\nessential for the development of real responsibility.\r\n\r\nPeople talk, Ellen Key remarks, as though reform in sexual morality\r\nmeant the breaking up of a beautiful idyll, while the idyll is\r\nimpossible as long as the only alternative offered to so many young men\r\nand women at the threshold of life is between becoming \"the slave of\r\nduty or the slave of lust.\" In these matters we already possess licence,\r\nand the only sound reform lies in a kind of \"freedom\" which will correct\r\nthat licence by obedience to the most fundamental natural instincts\r\nacting in harmony with the claims of the race, which claims, it must be\r\nadded, cannot be out of harmony with the best traditions of the race.\r\nEllen Key would agree with a great German, Wilhelm von Humboldt, who\r\nwrote more than a century ago that \"a solicitude for the race conducts\r\nto the same results as the highest solicitude for the most beautiful\r\ndevelopment of the inner man.\" The modern revolt against fossilized laws\r\nis inevitable; it is already in progress, and we have to see to it that\r\nthe laws written upon tables of stone in their inevitable decay only\r\ngive place to the mightier laws written upon tables of flesh and blood.\r\nLife is far too rich and manifold, Ellen Key says again, to be confined\r\nin a single formula, even the best; if our ideal has its worth for\r\nourselves, if we are prepared to live for it and to die for it, that is\r\nenough; we are not entitled to impose it on others. The conception of\r\nduty still remains, duty to love and duty to the race. \"I believe in a\r\nnew ethics,\" Ellen Key declares at the end of _The Women's Movement_,\r\n\"which will be a synthesis growing out of the nature of man and the\r\nnature of woman, out of the demands of the individual and the demands\r\nof society, out of the pagan and the Christian points of view, out of\r\nthe resolve to mould the future and out of piety towards the past.\"\r\n\r\nNo reader of Ellen Key's books can fail to be impressed by the\r\nremarkable harmony between her sexual ethics and the conception that\r\nunderlies Sir Francis Galton's scientific eugenics. In setting forth the\r\nlatest aspects of his view of eugenics before the Sociological Society,\r\nGalton asserted that the improvement of the race, in harmony with\r\nscientific knowledge, would come about by a new religious movement, and\r\nhe gave reasons to show why such an expectation is not unreasonable; in\r\nthe past men have obeyed the most difficult marriage rules in response\r\nto what they believed to be supernatural commands, and there is no\r\nground for supposing that the real demands of the welfare of the race,\r\nfounded on exact knowledge, will prove less effective in calling out an\r\ninspiring religious emotion. Writing probably at the same time, Ellen\r\nKey, in her essay entitled _Love and Ethics_, set forth precisely the\r\nsame conception, though not from the scientific but from the emotional\r\nstandpoint. From the outset she places the sexual question on a basis\r\nwhich brings it into line with Galton's eugenics. The problem used to be\r\nconcerned, she remarks, with the insistence of society on a rigid\r\nmarriage form, in conflict with the demand of the individual to gratify\r\nhis desires in any manner that seemed good to him, while now it becomes\r\na question of harmonizing the claims of the improvement of the race with\r\nthe claims of the individual to happiness in love. She points out that\r\non this aspect real harmony becomes more possible. Regard for the\r\nennoblement of the race serves as a bridge from a chaos of conflicting\r\ntendencies to a truer conception of love, and \"love must become on a\r\nhigher plane what it was in primitive days--a religion.\" She compares\r\nthe growth of the conception of the vital value of love to the modern\r\ngrowth of the conception of the value of health as against the medieval\r\nindifference to hygiene. It is inevitable that Ellen Key, approaching\r\nthe question from the emotional side, should lay less stress than Galton\r\non the importance of scientific investigation in heredity, and insist\r\nmainly on the value of sound instincts, unfettered by false and\r\nartificial constraints, and taught to realize that the physical and the\r\npsychic aspects of life are alike \"divine.\"\r\n\r\nIt would obviously be premature to express either approval or\r\ndisapproval of the conceptions of sexual morality which Ellen Key has\r\ndeveloped with such fervour and insight. It scarcely seems probable that\r\nthe methods of sexual union, put forward as an alternative to celibacy\r\nby some of the adherents of the new movement, are likely to become\r\nwidely popular, even if legalized in an increasing number of countries.\r\nI have elsewhere given reasons to believe that the path of progress lies\r\nmainly in the direction of a reform of the present institution of\r\nmarriage.[67] The need of such reform is pressing, and there are many\r\nsigns that it is being recognized. We can scarcely doubt that the\r\nadvocates of these alternative methods of sexual union will do good by\r\nstimulating the champions of marriage to increased activity in the\r\nreform of that institution. In such matters a certain amount of\r\ncompetition sometimes has a remarkably vivifying effect.\r\n\r\nWe may be sure that women, whose interests are so much at stake in this\r\nmatter, and who tend to look at it in a practical rather than in a legal\r\nand theological spirit, will exert a powerful influence when they have\r\nacquired the ability to enforce that influence by the vote. This is\r\nsignificantly indicated by an inquiry held in England during 1910 by the\r\nWomen's Co-operative Guild. A number of women who had held official\r\npositions in the Guild were asked (among other questions) whether or not\r\nthey were in favour of divorce by mutual consent. Of 94 representative\r\nwomen conversant with affairs who were thus consulted, as many as 82\r\ndeliberately recorded their opinion in favour of divorce by mutual\r\nconsent, and only 12 were against that highly important marriage reform.\r\n\r\nIt is probably unnecessary to discuss the opinions of other leaders in\r\nthis movement, though there are several, such as Frau Grete Meisel-Hess,\r\nwhose views deserve study. It will be sufficiently clear in what way\r\nthis Teutonic movement differs from that Anglo-Saxon woman's rights'\r\nmovement with which we have long been familiar. These German women fully\r\nrecognize that women are entitled to the same human rights as men, and\r\nthat until such rights are attained \"feminism\" still has a proper task\r\nto achieve. But women must use their strength in the sphere for which\r\ntheir own nature fits them. Even though millions of women are enabled to\r\ndo the work which men could do better the gain for mankind is nil. To\r\nput women to do men's work is (Ellen Key has declared) as foolish as to\r\nset a Beethoven or a Wagner to do engine-driving.\r\n\r\nIt has probably excited surprise in the minds of some who have been\r\nimpressed by the magnitude and vitality of this movement that it should\r\nhave manifested itself in Germany rather than in England, which is the\r\noriginal home of movements for women's emancipation, or in America,\r\nwhere they have reached their fullest developments. This, however,\r\nceases to be surprising when we realize the special qualities of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon and Teutonic temperaments and the special conditions under\r\nwhich the two movements arose. The Anglo-Saxon movement was a special\r\napplication to women of the general French movement for the logical\r\nassertion of abstract human rights. That special application was not\r\nardently taken up in France itself, though first proclaimed by French\r\npioneers,[68] partly perhaps because such one-sided applications make\r\nlittle appeal to the French mind, and mainly, no doubt, because women\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century enjoyed such high social\r\nconsideration and exerted so much influence that they were not impelled\r\nto rise in any rebellious protest. But when the seed was brought over to\r\nEngland, especially in the representative form of Mary Wollstonecraft's\r\n_Vindication of the Rights of Women_, it fell in virgin soil which\r\nproved highly favourable to its development. This special application\r\nescaped the general condemnation which the Revolution had brought upon\r\nFrench ideas. Women in England were beginning to awaken to ideas,--as\r\nwomen in Germany are now,--and the more energetic and intelligent among\r\nthem eagerly seized upon conceptions which furnished food for their\r\nactivities. In large measure they have achieved their aims, and even\r\nwoman's suffrage has been secured here and there, without producing any\r\nnotable revolution in human affairs. The Anglo-Saxon conception of\r\nfeminine progress--beneficial as it has undoubtedly been in many\r\nrespects--makes little impression in Germany, partly because it fails to\r\nappeal to the emotional Teutonic temperament, and partly because the\r\nestablished type of German life and civilization offers very small scope\r\nfor its development. When Miss Susan Anthony, the veteran pioneer of\r\nwoman's movements in the United States, was presented to the German\r\nEmpress she expressed a hope that the Emperor would soon confer the\r\nsuffrage on German women; it is recorded that the Empress smiled, and\r\nprobably most German women smiled with her. At the present time,\r\nhowever, there is an extraordinary amount of intellectual activity in\r\nGermany, a widespread and massive activity. For the first time,\r\nmoreover, it has reached women, who are taking it up with characteristic\r\nTeutonic thoroughness. But they are not imitating the methods of their\r\nAnglo-Saxon sisters; they are going to work their own way. They are\r\nspending very little energy in waving the red flag before the fortresses\r\nof male monopoly. They are following an emotional influence which,\r\nstrangely enough, it may seem to some, finds more support from the\r\nbiological and medical side than the Anglo-Saxon movement has always\r\nbeen able to win. From the time of Aristophanes downwards, whenever they\r\nhave demonstrated before the masculine citadels, women have always been\r\nroughly bidden to go home. And now, here in Germany, where of all\r\ncountries that advice has been most freely and persistently given, women\r\nare adopting new tactics: they have gone home. \"Yes, it is true,\" they\r\nsay in effect, \"the home is our sphere. Love and marriage, the bearing\r\nand the training of children--that is our world. And we intend to lay\r\ndown the laws of our world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] In 1787 Condorcet declared (_Lettres d'un Bourgeois de New Haven_,\r\nLettre II) that women ought to have absolutely the same rights as men,\r\nand he repeated the same statement emphatically in 1790, in an article\r\n\"Sur l'Admission des Femmes au Droit de Cite,\" published in the _Journal\r\nde la Societe de 1789_. It must be added that Condorcet was not a\r\ndemocrat, and neither to men nor to women would he grant the vote unless\r\nthey were proprietors.\r\n\r\n[53] Leopold Lacour has given a full and reliable account of Olympe de\r\nGouges (who was born at Montauban in 1755) in his _Trois Femmes de la\r\nRevolution_, 1900.\r\n\r\n[54] It is noteworthy that the Empire had even a depressing effect on the\r\nphysical activities of women. The eighteenth-century woman in France,\r\nalthough she was not athletic in the modern sense, enjoyed a free life\r\nin the open air and was fond of physical exercises. During the\r\nDirectoire this tendency became very pronounced; women wore the\r\nscantiest of garments, were out of doors in all weathers, cultivated\r\nhealthy appetites, and enjoyed the best of health. But with the\r\nestablishment of the Empire these wholesome fashions were discarded, and\r\nwomen cultivated new ideals of fragile refinement indoors. (This\r\nevolution has been traced by Dr. Lucien Nars, _L'Hygiene_, September,\r\n1911.)\r\n\r\n[55] Concerning the rise and progress of this movement in England much\r\ninformation is sympathetically and vivaciously set forth in W. Lyon\r\nBlease's _Emancipation of English Women_ (1910), a book, however, which\r\nmakes no claim to be judicial or impartial; the author regards\r\n\"unregulated male egoism\" as the source of the difficulties in the way\r\nof women's suffrage.\r\n\r\n[56] Thus, in 1911 the National League for Opposing Women's Suffrage took\r\nan impartial poll of the women voters on the municipal register in\r\nseveral large constituencies, by sending a reply-paid postcard to ask\r\nwhether or not they favoured the extension to women of the Parliamentary\r\nfranchise. Only 5579 were in favour of it; 18,850 were against; 12,621\r\ndid not take the trouble to answer, and it was claimed, probably with\r\nreason, that a majority of these were not in favour of the vote.\r\n\r\n[57] It must not be too hastily assumed. Unless we go back to ancient\r\nplots of the Guy Fawkes type (now only imitated by self-styled\r\nanarchists), the leaders of movements of political reform have rarely,\r\nif ever, organized outbursts of violence; such violence, when it\r\noccurred, has been the spontaneous and unpremeditated act of a mob.\r\n\r\n[58] _Revue de l'Ecole d'Anthropologie_, February, 1909, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[59] O. Schrader, _Reallexicon_, Art. \"Keuschheit.\" He considers that\r\nTacitus merely shows that German women were usually chaste after\r\nmarriage. A few centuries later, Lea points out, Salvianus, while\r\npraising the barbarians generally for their chastity, makes an exception\r\nin the case of the Alemanni. (See also Havelock Ellis, _Studies in the\r\nPsychology of Sex_, Vol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" pp. 382-4.)\r\n\r\n[60] Thus Kaan, anticipating Krafft-Ebing, published a _Psychopathia\r\nSexualis_, in 1844, and Casper, in 1852, was the first medical authority\r\nto point out that sexual inversion is sometimes due to a congenital\r\npsychic condition.\r\n\r\n[61] Both Forel's and Bloch's books have become well known through\r\ntranslations in England and America. Dr. Bloch is also the author of an\r\nextremely erudite and thorough history of syphilis, which has gone far\r\nto demonstrate that this disease was introduced into Europe from America\r\non the first discovery of the New World at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[62] This attitude is plainly reflected even in many books written by\r\nmen; I may mention, for instance, Frenssen's well-known novel\r\n_Hilligenlei_ (_Holyland_).\r\n\r\n[63] In most countries illegitimacy is decreasing; in Germany it is\r\nsteadily increasing, alike in rural and urban districts. Illegitimate\r\nbirths are, however, more numerous in the cities than in the country. Of\r\nthe constituent states of the German Empire, the illegitimate birth-rate\r\nis lowest in Prussia, highest in Saxony and Bavaria. In Munich 27 per\r\ncent of the births are illegitimate. (The facts are clearly brought out\r\nin an article by Dr. Arthur Gruenspan in the _Berliner Tagblatt_ for\r\nJanuary 6, 1911, reproduced in _Die Neue Generation_, July, 1911.) Thus,\r\nin Prussia, while the total births between 1903 and 1908,\r\nnotwithstanding a great increase in the population, have only increased\r\n2.6 per cent, the illegitimate births have increased as much as 11.1 per\r\ncent. The increase is marked in nearly all the German States. It is\r\nspecially marked in Saxony; here the proportion of illegitimate births\r\nto the total number of births was, in 1903, 12.51 per cent, and in 1908\r\nit had already risen to 14.40 per cent. In Berlin it is most marked;\r\nhere it began in 1891, when there were nearly 47,000 legitimate births;\r\nby 1909, however, the legitimate births had fallen to 38,000, a decrease\r\nof 19.4 per cent. But illegitimate births rose during the same period\r\nfrom nearly 7000 to over 9000, an increase of 35 per cent. The\r\nproportion of illegitimate births to the total births is now over 20 per\r\ncent, so that to every four legitimate children there is rather more\r\nthan one illegitimate child. It may be said that this is merely due to\r\nan increasing proportion of unmarried women. That, however, is not the\r\ncase. The marriage-rate is on the whole rising, and the average age of\r\nwomen at marriage is becoming lower rather than higher. Gruenspan\r\nconsiders that this increase in illegitimacy is likely to continue, and\r\nhe is inclined to attribute it less to economic than to\r\nsocial-psychological causes.\r\n\r\n[64] I have discussed this point in _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_,\r\nVol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" chap. XII.\r\n\r\n[65] It is remarkable that in early times in Spain the laws recognized\r\nconcubinage (_barragania_) as almost equal to marriage, and as\r\nconferring equal rights on the child, even on the sons of the clergy,\r\nwho could thus inherit from their fathers by right of the privileges\r\naccorded to the concubine or _barragana_. _Barragania_, however, was not\r\nreal marriage, and in many regions it could be contracted by married men\r\n(R. Altamira, _Historia de Espana y de la Civilazacion Espanola_, Vol.\r\nI, pp. 644 et seq.).\r\n\r\n[66] \"La femme libre,\" in quest of whom the young Saint-Simonians\r\npreached a crusade, must be a woman of reflection and intellect who,\r\nhaving meditated on the fate of her \"sisters,\" knowing the wants of\r\nwomen, and having sounded those feminine capacities which man has never\r\ncompletely penetrated, shall give forth the confession of her sex,\r\nwithout restriction or reserve, in such a manner as to furnish the\r\nindispensable elements for formulating the rights and duties of woman.\r\nSaint Simon had asked Madame de Stael to undertake this role, but she\r\nfailed to respond. When George Sand published her first novels, one\r\nGueroult was commissioned to ascertain if the author of _Lelia_ would\r\nundertake this important service. He found a badly dressed woman who was\r\nusing her talents to gain a living, but was by no means anxious to\r\nbecome the high priestess of a new religion. Even after his\r\ndisappointment Enfantin looked eagerly forward to the publication of\r\nGeorge Sand's _Histoire de ma Vie_, hoping that at last the great\r\nrevelation was coming, and he was again disillusioned. But before this\r\nEmile Barrault had arisen and declared that in the East, in the solitude\r\nof the harem, \"la femme libre\" would be found in the person of some\r\nodalisque. The \"mission of the mother\" was formed, and with Barrault at\r\nthe head it set out for Constantinople. All were dressed in white as an\r\nindication of the vow of chastity they had taken before leaving Paris,\r\nand on the road they begged in the name of the Mother. They arrived at\r\nConstantinople and preached the faith of Saint-Simon to the Turks in\r\nFrench. But \"la femme libre\" seemed as far off as ever, and they\r\nresolved to go to Rotourma in Oceana, there to establish the religion of\r\nSaint-Simon and a perfect Government which might serve as a model to the\r\nStates of Europe. First, however, they felt it a duty to make certain\r\nthat the Mother was not hiding somewhere in Russia, and they went\r\ntherefore to Odessa, but the Governor, who was wanting in sympathy,\r\nspeedily turned them out, and having realized that Rotourma was some\r\ndistance off, the mission broke up, most of the members going to Egypt\r\nto rejoin Enfantin, whom the Arabs, struck by his beauty, had called\r\n_Abu-l-dhunieh_, the Father of the World. (This account of the movement\r\nis based on that given by Maxime du Camp, in his _Souvenirs\r\nLitteraires_)\r\n\r\n[67] _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_, Vol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to\r\nSociety,\" chap. X.\r\n\r\n[68] It is worth noting that a Frenchwoman has been called \"the mother of\r\nmodern feminism.\" Marie de Gournay, who died in 1645 at the age of\r\neighty, is best known as the adopted daughter of Montaigne, for whom she\r\ncherished an enthusiastic reverence, becoming the first editor of his\r\nessays. Her short essay, _Egalite des Hommes et des Femmes_, was written\r\nin 1622. See e.g. M. Schiff, _La Fille d'Alliance de Montaigne_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN IN RELATION TO ROMANTIC LOVE\r\n\r\n     The Absence of Romantic Love in Classic Civilization--Marriage as a\r\n     Duty--The Rise of Romantic Love in the Roman Empire--The Influence\r\n     of Christianity--The Attitude of Chivalry--The Troubadours--The\r\n     Courts of Love--The Influence of the Renaissance--Conventional\r\n     Chivalry and Modern Civilization--The Woman Movement--The Modern\r\n     Woman's Equality of Rights and Responsibilities excludes\r\n     Chivalry--New Forms of Romantic Love still remain possible--Love as\r\n     the Inspiration of Social Hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will be the ultimate effect of the woman's movement, now slowly but\r\nsurely taking place among us, upon romantic love? That is really a\r\nserious question, and it is much more complex than many of those who are\r\nprepared to answer it off-hand may be willing to admit.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that romantic love has not been a constant\r\naccompaniment of human relationships, even in civilization. It is true\r\nthat various peoples very low down in the scale possess romantic\r\nlove-songs, often, it appears, written by the women. But the classic\r\ncivilizations of Greece and Rome in their most robust and brilliant\r\nperiods knew little or nothing of romantic love in connection with\r\nnormal sexual relationships culminating in marriage. Classic antiquity\r\nreveals a high degree of conjugal devotion, and of domestic affection,\r\nat all events in Rome, but the right of the woman to follow the\r\ninspirations of her own heart, and the idealization and worship of the\r\nwoman by the man, were not only scarcely known but, so far as they were\r\nknown, reprehended or condemned. Ovid, in the opinion of some,\r\nrepresents a new movement in Rome. We are apt to regard Ovid as, in\r\nerotic matters, the representative of a set of immoral Roman\r\nvoluptuaries. That view probably requires considerable modification.\r\nOvid was not indeed a champion of morality, but there is no good reason\r\nto suppose that, before he appeared, the rather stern Roman mind had yet\r\nconceived those refinements and courtesies which he set forth in such\r\ncharming detail. If we take a wide survey of his work, we may perhaps\r\nregard Ovid as the pioneer of a chivalrous attitude towards women and of\r\na romantic conception of love not only new in Rome but of significance\r\nfor Europe generally. Ovid was a powerful factor in the Renaissance\r\nmovement, and not least in England, where his influence on Shakespeare\r\nand some others of the Elizabethans cannot easily be overrated.[69]\r\n\r\nFor the ordinary classic mind, Greek or Roman, marriage was intended for\r\nthe end of building up the family, and the family was consecrated to the\r\nState. The fulfilment of so exalted a function involved a certain\r\naustere dignity which excluded wayward inclination or passionate\r\nemotion. These might indeed occur between a man and a woman outside\r\nmarriage, but putting aside the very limited phenomena of Athenian\r\nhetairism, they were too shameful to be idealized. Some trace of this\r\nclassic attitude may be said to persist even to-day among the so-called\r\nLatin nations, notably in the French tradition (now dying out) of\r\ntreating marriage as a relationship to be arranged, not by the two\r\nparties themselves, but by their parents and guardians; Montaigne,\r\nattached as he was to maxims of Roman antiquity, was not very alien from\r\nthe ordinary French attitude of his time when he declared that, since we\r\ndo not marry so much for our own sakes as for the sake of posterity and\r\nthe race, marriage is too sacred a process to be mixed with amorous\r\nextravagance.[70] There is something to be said for that point of view\r\nwhich is nowadays too often forgotten, but it certainly fails to cover\r\nthe whole of the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in the West that a contemptuous attitude towards the\r\nromantic and erotic side of life has prevailed at some of the most\r\nvigorous moments of civilization. It is also found in the East. In\r\nJapan, for instance, even at the present day, romantic love, as a\r\nreputable element of ordinary life, is unknown or disapproved; its\r\nexistence is not recognized in the schools, and the European novels that\r\ncelebrate it are scarcely understood.[71]\r\n\r\nThe development of modern romantic love in connection with marriage\r\nseems to be found in the late Greek world under the Roman Empire.[72]\r\nThat is commonly called a period of decadence. In a certain limited\r\nsense it was. Greece had become subjugated to Rome. Rome herself had\r\nlost her military spirit and was losing her political power. But the\r\nfighting instinct, and even the ruling spirit, are not synonymous with\r\ncivilization. The \"decline and fall\" of empires by no means necessarily\r\ninvolves the decay of civilization. It is now generally realized that\r\nthe later Roman Empire was not, as was once thought, an age of social\r\nand moral degeneration.[73] The State indeed was dissolving, but the\r\nindividual was evolving. The age which produced a Plutarch--for fifteen\r\nhundred years one of the great inspiring forces of the world--was the\r\nreverse of a corrupt age. The life of the home and the life of the soul\r\nwere alike developing. The home was becoming more complex, more\r\nintimate, more elevated. The soul was being turned in on itself to\r\ndiscover new and joyous secrets: the secret of the love of Nature, the\r\nsecret of mystic religion, and, not least, the secret of romantic love.\r\nWhen Christianity finally conquered the Roman world its task very\r\nlargely lay in taking over and developing those three secrets already\r\ndiscovered by Paganism.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable, however, that in developing these new forms of the\r\nemotional life, the ascetic bent of Christianity should make itself\r\nfelt. It was not possible for Christianity to cast its halo around the\r\nnatural sexual life, but it was possible to refine and exalt that life,\r\nto lift it into a spiritual sphere. Neither woman the sweetheart nor\r\nwoman the mother were in ordinary life glorified by the Church; they\r\nwere only tolerated. But on a higher than natural plane they were\r\nsurrounded by a halo and raised to the highest pedestal of reverence and\r\neven worship. The Virgin was exalted, Bride and Bridegroom became terms\r\nof mystical import, and the Holy Mother received the adoring love of all\r\nChristendom. Even in the actual relations of men and women, quite early\r\nin the history of Christianity, we sometimes find men and women\r\ncultivating relationships which excluded that earthly union the Church\r\nlooked down on, but yet involved the most tender and intimate physical\r\naffection. Many charming stories of such relationships are found in the\r\nlives of the saints, and sometimes they existed even within the\r\nmarriage bond.[74] Christianity led to the use of ideas and terms\r\nborrowed from earthly love in a different and symbolic sense. But the\r\nundesigned result was that a new force and beauty were added to those\r\nideas and terms, however applied, and also that many emotions were thus\r\ncultivated which became capable of re-inforcing earthly human love. In\r\nthis way it happened that, though Christianity rejected the ideal of\r\nromantic love in its natural associations, it indirectly prepared the\r\nway for a loftier and deeper realization of that love.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the emotional training and refining of the\r\nfleshly instincts by Christianity was the chief cause of the rise of\r\nthat conception of romantic love which we associate with the institution\r\nof chivalry. Exalted and sanctified by contact with the central dogmas\r\nof religion, the emotion of love was brought down from this spiritual\r\natmosphere by the knightly lover, with something of its ethereal halo\r\nstill clinging to it, and directed towards an earthly mistress. The most\r\nextravagant phase of romantic love which has ever been seen was then\r\nbrought about, and in many cases, certainly, it was a real erotomania\r\nwhich passed beyond the bounds of sanity.[75] In its extreme forms,\r\nhowever, this romantic love was a rare, localized, and short-lived\r\nmanifestation. The dominant attitude of the chivalrous age towards\r\nwomen, as Leon Gautier has shown in his monumental work on chivalry, was\r\none of indifference, or even contempt. The knight's thoughts were more\r\nof war than of women, and he cherished his horse more than his\r\nmistress.[76]\r\n\r\nBut women, above all in France, reacted against this attitude, and with\r\nsplendid success. Their husbands treated them with indifference or left\r\nthem at home while they sought adventure in the world. The neglected\r\nwives proceeded to lay down the laws of society, and took upon\r\nthemselves the part of rulers in the domain of morals. In the eleventh,\r\nthe twelfth, the thirteenth centuries, says Meray in a charming book on\r\nlife in the days of the Courts of Love, we find women \"with infinite\r\nskill and an adorable refinement seizing the moral direction of French\r\nsociety.\" They did so, he remarks, in a spirit so Utopian, so ideally\r\npoetic, that historians have hesitated to take them seriously. The laws\r\nof the Courts of Love[77] may sometimes seem to us immoral and\r\nlicentious, but in reality they served to restrain the worst\r\nimmoralities and licences of the time. They banished violence, they\r\nallowed no venality, and they inculcated moderation in passion. The task\r\nof the Courts of Love was facilitated by the relative degree of peace\r\nwhich then reigned, especially by the fact that the Normans, holding\r\nboth coasts of the Channel, formed a link between France and England.\r\nWhen the murderous activities of French kings and English kings\r\ndestroyed that link, the Courts of Love were swept away in the general\r\ndisorder and the progress of civilization indefinitely retarded.[78] Yet\r\nin some degree the ideals which had been thus embodied still persisted.\r\nAs the Goncourts pointed out in their invaluable book, _La Femme au\r\nDix-huitieme Siecle_ (Chap. v), from the days of chivalry even on into\r\nthe eighteenth century, when on the surface at all events it apparently\r\ndisappeared, an exalted ideal of love continued to be cherished in\r\nFrance. This conception remained associated, throughout, with the great\r\nsocial influence and authority which had been enjoyed by women in France\r\neven from medieval times. That influence had become pronounced during\r\nthe seventeenth century, and at that time Sir Thomas Smith in his\r\n_Commonwealth of England_, writing of the high position of women in\r\nEngland, remarked that they possessed \"almost as much liberty as in\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nThere were at least two forms of medieval romantic love. The first arose\r\nin Provence and northern Italy during the twelfth century, and spread to\r\nGermany as _Minnedienst_. In this form the young knights directed their\r\nrespectful and adoring devotion to a high-born married woman who chose\r\none of them as her own cavalier, to do her service and reverence, the\r\ntwo vowing devotion to each other until death. It was a part of this\r\namorous code that there could not be love between husband and wife, and\r\nit was counted a mark of low breeding for a husband to challenge his\r\nwife's right to her young knight's services, though sometimes we are\r\ntold the husband risked this reproach, occasionally with tragic results.\r\nThis mode of love, after being eloquently sung and practised by the\r\ntroubadours--usually, it appears, younger sons of noble houses--died out\r\nin the place of its origin, but it had been introduced into Spain, and\r\nthe Spaniards reintroduced it into Italy when they acquired the kingdom\r\nof Naples; in Italy it was conventionalized into the firmly rooted\r\ninstitution of the _cavaliere servente_. From the standpoint of a strict\r\nmorality, the institution was obviously open to question. But we can\r\nscarcely fail to see that at its origin it possessed, even if\r\nunconsciously, a quasi-religious warrant in the worship of the Holy\r\nMother, and we have to recognize that, notwithstanding its questionable\r\nshape, it was really an effort to attain a purer and more ideal\r\nrelationship than was possible in a rough and warlike age which placed\r\nthe wife in subordination to her husband. A tender devotion that\r\ninspired poetry, an unalloyed respect that approached reverence, vows\r\nthat were based on equal freedom and independence on both sides--these\r\nwere possibilities which the men and women of that age felt to be\r\nincompatible with marriage as they knew it.\r\n\r\nThe second form of medieval romantic love was more ethereal than the\r\nfirst, and much more definitely and consciously based on a religious\r\nattitude. It was really the worship of the Virgin transferred to a\r\nyoung earthly maiden, yet retaining the purity and ideality of\r\nreligious worship. To so high a degree is this the case that it is\r\nsometimes difficult to be sure whether we are concerned with a real\r\nmaiden of flesh and blood or only a poetic symbol of womanhood. This\r\ndoubt has been raised, notably by Bartoli, concerning Dante's Beatrice,\r\nthe supreme type of this ethereal love, which arose in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and was chiefly cultivated in Florence. The poets of this\r\nmovement were themselves aware of the religious character of their\r\ndevotion to the _donna angelicata_ to whom they even apply, as they\r\nwould to the Queen of Heaven, the appellation Stella Maris. That there\r\nwas an element of flesh and blood in these figures is believed by Remy\r\nde Gourmont, but when we gaze at them, he remarks, we see at first, \"in\r\nplace of a body only two eyes with angel's wings behind them, on the\r\nbackground of an azure sky sown with golden stars\"; the lover is on his\r\nknees and his love has become a prayer.[79] This phase of romantic love\r\nwas brief, and perhaps mostly the possession of the poets, but it\r\nrepresented a really important moment in the evolution of modern\r\nromantic love. It was a step towards the realization of the genuinely\r\nhuman charm of young womanhood in real human relationships, of which we\r\nalready have a foretaste in the delicious early French story of Aucassin\r\nand Nicolette.\r\n\r\nThe re-discovery of classic literature, the movements of Humanism and\r\nthe Renaissance, swept away what was left of the almost religious\r\nidealization of the young virgin. The ethereal maiden, thin, pale,\r\nanaemic, disappeared alike from literature and from art, and was no\r\nlonger an ideal in actual life. She gave place to a new woman, conscious\r\nof her own fully developed womanhood and all its needs, radiantly\r\nbeautiful and finely shaped in every limb. She lacked the spirituality\r\nof her predecessors, but she had gained in intellect. She appears first\r\nin the pages of Boccaccio. After a long interval Titian immortalized her\r\nrich and mature beauty; she is Flora, she is Ariadne, she is alike the\r\nEarthly Love and the Heavenly Love. Every curve of her body was\r\nadoringly and minutely described by Niphus and Firenzuola.[80] She was,\r\nmoreover, the courtesan whose imperial charm and adroitness enabled her\r\nto trample under foot the medieval conception of lust as sin, even in\r\nthe courts of popes. At the great academic centre of Bologna, finally,\r\nshe chastely taught learning and science.[81] The people of the Italian\r\nRenaissance placed women on the same level as men, and to call a woman a\r\n_virago_ implied unalloyed praise.[82]\r\n\r\nThe very mixed conditions of what we have been accustomed to consider\r\nthe modern world then began for women. They were no longer\r\ncloistered--whether in convents or the home--but neither were they any\r\nlonger worshipped. They began to be treated as human beings, and when\r\nmen idealized them in figures of romantic charm or pathos--figures like\r\nShakespeare's Rosalind or Marivaux's Sylvia or Richardson's\r\nClarissa--this humanity was henceforth the common ground out of which\r\nthe vision arose. But, one notes, in nearly all the great poets and\r\nnovelists up to the middle of the last century, it was usually in the\r\nweakness of humanity that the artist sought the charm and pathos of his\r\nfeminine figures. From Shakespeare's Ophelia to Thackeray's Amelia this\r\nis the rule, more emphatically expressed in the literature of England\r\nthan of any other country. There had been no actual emancipation of\r\nwomen; though now they had entered the world of men, they were not yet,\r\nsocially and legally, of that world. Even the medieval traditions still\r\nlived on in subtly conventionalized forms. The \"chivalrous\" attitude\r\ntowards women was, as the word itself suggests, a medieval survival. It\r\nbelonged to a period of barbarism when brutal force ruled and when the\r\nman who magnanimously placed his force at the disposition of a woman was\r\nreally doing her a service and granting her a privilege. But\r\ncivilization means the building up of an orderly society in which\r\nindividual rights are respected, and force no longer dominates. So that\r\nas civilization advances the occasions on which women require the aid\r\nof masculine force become ever fewer and more unimportant. The\r\nconventionalized chivalry of men then tends to become an offer of\r\nservices which it would be better for women to do for themselves and a\r\nbestowal of privileges to which they are nowise entitled.[83] Moreover,\r\nthis same chivalry is, under these conditions, apt to take on a\r\ncharacter which is the reverse of its face value. It becomes the\r\nassertion of a power over women instead of a power on their behalf; and\r\nit carries with it a tinge of contempt in place of respect.\r\nTheoretically, a thousand chivalrous swords should leap from their\r\nscabbards to succour the distressed woman. In practice this may only\r\nmean that the thousand owners of these metaphorical weapons are on the\r\nalert to take advantage of the distressed woman.\r\n\r\nThus the romantic emotions based on medieval ideals gradually lost their\r\nworth. They were not in relation to the altered facts of life; they had\r\nbecome an empty convention which could be turned to very unromantic\r\nuses. The movement for the emancipation of women was not consciously or\r\ndirectly a movement of revolt against an antiquated chivalry. It was\r\nrather a part of the development of civilization which rendered chivalry\r\nantique. Medieval romantic love implied in women a weakness in the soil\r\nof which only a spiritual force could flourish. The betterment of social\r\nconditions, the subordination of violence to order, the growing respect\r\nfor individual rights, took away the reasons for consecrating weakness\r\nin women, and created an ever larger field in which women could freely\r\nseek to rival men, because it is a field in which knowledge and skill\r\nare of far more importance than muscular strength. The emancipation of\r\nwomen has simply been the later and more conscious phase of the process\r\nby which women have entered into this field and sought their share of\r\nits rights and its responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe woman movement of modern times, properly understood, has thus been\r\nthe effort of women to adapt themselves to the conditions of an orderly\r\nand peaceful civilization. Education, under the changed conditions, can\r\neffect what before needed force of arms; responsibility is now demanded\r\nwhere before only tutelage was possible. A civilized society in which\r\nwomen are ignorant and irresponsible is an anachronism, and, however\r\ngreat the wrench with the past might be, it was necessary that women\r\nshould be adjusted to the changing times. The ideal of the weak,\r\nignorant, inexperienced woman--the cross between an angel and an idiot,\r\nas I have elsewhere described her[84]--no longer fulfilled any useful\r\npurpose. Civilized society furnishes the conditions under which all\r\nadult persons are socially equal and all are free to give to society the\r\nbest they are capable of.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable, but unfortunate, that this movement should have\r\nsometimes tended to take the form of an attempt on the part of women to\r\nsecure, not merely equality with men, but actual imitation of men. These\r\nwomen said that since men had attained mastery in life, captured all the\r\nbest things, and adopted the most successful methods of living, it was\r\nnecessary for women to copy them at every point. That was a specious\r\nplea which even had in it a certain element of truth. But the fact\r\nremained that women and men are different, that the difference is based\r\nin fundamental natural functions, and that to place one sex in exactly\r\nthe same position as the other sex is to deform its outlines and to\r\nhamper its activities.\r\n\r\nFrom the present point of view we are only concerned with the influence\r\nof the woman's movement on love. On the traditional conception of\r\nromantic love inherited from medieval days there can be no doubt that\r\nthis influence has been highly dissolvent. Medieval romantic love, in\r\nits original form, had been part of a conception of womanhood made up of\r\nopposites, and all the opposites balanced each other. The medieval man\r\nlaid his homage at the feet of the great lady in the castle hall, but he\r\nhimself lorded it over the wife who drudged in his own home. On his\r\nknees he gazed up in devotion at the ethereal virgin, but when she\r\nceased to be a virgin, he asserted himself by cursing her as a demon\r\nsent from hell to seduce and torment him. All this was possible because\r\nthe woman was outside the orbit of the man's life, never on the same\r\nplane, necessarily higher or lower. It became difficult if woman was\r\nman's equal, absurdly impossible if she was of identical nature with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe medieval romantic tradition has come down to us so laden with beauty\r\nand mystery that we are apt to think, as we see it melt away, that human\r\nachievements are being permanently depreciated. That illusion occurs in\r\nevery age of transition. It was notably so in the eighteenth century,\r\nwhich represented a highly important stage in the emancipation of women.\r\nTo some that century seems to have been given up to empty gallantry and\r\nfacile pleasure. Yet it was not only the age in which women for the\r\nfirst time succeeded in openly attaining their supreme social\r\ninfluence,[85] it was an age of romantic love, and the noble or poignant\r\nlove-stories which have reached us from the records of that period\r\nsurpass those of any other age.\r\n\r\nIf we believe with Goethe that the religion of the future consists in a\r\ntriple reverence--the reverence for what is above us, the reverence for\r\nwhat is below us, and the reverence for our equals[86]--we need not\r\ngrieve overmuch if one form of this reverence, the first, and that which\r\nGoethe regarded as the earliest and crudest, has lost its exclusive\r\nclaim. Reverence is essential to all romantic love. To bring down the\r\nMadonna and the Virgin from their pedestals to share with men the common\r\nresponsibilities and duties of life is not to divest them of the claim\r\nto reverence. It is merely the sign of a change in the form of that\r\nreverence, a change which heralds a new romantic love.\r\n\r\nIt would be premature to attempt to define the exact outline of the new\r\nforms of romantic love, or the precise lineaments of the beings who will\r\nmost ardently evoke that love. In literature, indeed, the ideals of life\r\ncast their shadow before, and we may surely trace a change in the erotic\r\nideals mirrored in literature. The woman whom Dickens idealized in\r\n_David Copperfield_ is unlike indeed to the series of women of a new\r\ntype introduced by George Meredith, and the modern heroine generally\r\nexhibits more of the robust, open-eyed and spontaneous qualities of that\r\nlater type than the blind and clinging nature of the amiable simpletons\r\nof the older type. That the changed conditions of civilization should\r\nproduce new types of womanhood and of love is not surprising, if we\r\nrealize that, even within the ancient chivalrous forms it was possible\r\nto produce similar robust types when the qualities of a race were\r\nfavourable to them. Spain furnishes a notable illustration. Spanish\r\nliterature from Cervantes and Tirso to Valera and Blasco Ibanez reflects\r\na type of woman who stands on the same ground as man and is his equal\r\nand often his superior on that ground, alike in vigour of body and of\r\nspirit, acquiring all that she cares to of virility, while losing\r\nnothing feminine that is of worth.[87] In more than one respect the\r\nideal woman of Spain is the ideal woman our civilization now renders\r\nnecessary. The women of the future, Grete Meisel-Hess declares in her\r\nfemininely clever and frank discussion of present-day conditions, _Die\r\nSexuelle Krise_, will be full, strong, elementary natures, devoid alike\r\nof the impulse to destroy or the aptitude to be destroyed. She\r\nconsiders, moreover, that so far from romantic love being a thing of the\r\npast, \"love as a form of worship is reserved for the future.\"[88] In the\r\npast it has only been found among a few rare souls; in the future world,\r\nfostered by the finer selection of a conscious eugenics, and a new\r\nreverence and care for motherhood, we may reasonably hope for a truly\r\nefficient humanity, the bearers and conservers of the highest human\r\nemotions. It is in this sense, indeed, that the voices of the greatest\r\nand most typical leaders of the woman's movement of emancipation to-day\r\nare heard. Ellen Key, in her _Love and Marriage_, seeks to conciliate\r\nthe cultivation of a free and sacred sexual relationship with the\r\nworship of the child, as the embodiment of the future race, while Olive\r\nSchreiner proclaims in her _Woman and Labour_ that the woman of the\r\nfuture will walk side by side with man in a higher and deeper\r\nrelationship than has ever been possible before because it will involve\r\na new community in activity and insight.\r\n\r\nNor is it alone from the feminine side that these forecasts are made.\r\nCertainly for the most part love has been cultivated more by women than\r\nby men. Primacy in the genius of intellect belongs incontestably to men,\r\nbut in the genius of love it has doubtless oftener been achieved by\r\nwomen. They have usually understood better than men that in this matter,\r\nas Goethe insisted, it is the lover and not the beloved who reaps the\r\nchief fruits of love. \"It is better to love, even violently,\" wrote the\r\nforsaken Portuguese nun, in her immortal _Letters_, \"than merely to be\r\nloved.\" He who loses his life here saves it, for it is only in so far as\r\nhe becomes a crucified god that Love wins the sacrifice of human hearts.\r\nOf late years, by an inevitable reaction, women have sometimes forgotten\r\nthis eternal verity. The women of the twentieth century in their anxiety\r\nfor self-possession and their rightful eagerness to gain positions they\r\nfeel they have been too long excluded from, have perhaps yet failed to\r\nrealize that the women of the eighteenth century, who exerted a sway\r\nover life that the women of no age before or since have possessed, were,\r\nabove all women, great and heroic lovers, and that those two fundamental\r\nfacts cannot be cut asunder. But this failure, temporary as it is\r\ndoubtless destined to be, will work for good if it is the point of\r\ndeparture for a revival among men of the art of love.\r\n\r\nMen indeed have here fallen behind women. The old saying, so tediously\r\noften quoted, concerning love as a \"thing apart\" in the lives of men\r\nwould scarcely have occurred to a medieval poet of Provence or Florence.\r\nIt is not enough for women to proclaim a new avatar of love if men are\r\nnot ready and eager to learn its art and to practise its discipline. In\r\na profoundly suggestive fragment on love, left incomplete at his death\r\nby the distinguished sociologist Tarde,[89] he suggests that when\r\nmasculine energy dies down in the fields of political ambition and\r\ncommercial gain, as it already has in the field of warfare, the energy\r\nliberated by greater social organization and cohesion may find scope\r\nonce more in love. For too long a period love, like war and politics and\r\ncommerce, has been chiefly monopolized by the predatory type of man, in\r\nthis field symbolized by the figure of Don Juan. In the future, Tarde\r\nsuggests, the Don Juan type of lover may fall into disrepute, giving\r\nplace to the Virgilian type, for whom love is not a thing apart but a\r\nform of life embodying its best and highest activities.\r\n\r\nWhen we come upon utterances of this kind we are tempted to think that\r\nthey represent merely the poetic dreams of individuals, standing too far\r\nahead of their fellows to possess any significance for men and women in\r\ngeneral. But it is probable that Ovid, and certain that Dante, set forth\r\nerotic conceptions that were unintelligible to most of their\r\ncontemporaries, yet they have been immensely influential over the ideas\r\nand emotions of men in later ages. The poets and prophets of one\r\ngeneration are engaged in moulding ideals which will be realized in the\r\nlives of a subsequent generation; in expressing their own most intimate\r\nemotions, as it has been truly said, they become the leaders in a long\r\nfile of men and women. Whatever may yet be uncertain and undefined, we\r\nmay assuredly believe that the emotion of love is far too deeply rooted\r\nin the depth of man's organism and woman's organism ever to be torn out\r\nor ever to be thrust into a subordinate place. And we may also believe\r\nthat there is no measurable limit to its power of putting forth ever new\r\nand miraculous flowers. It is recorded that once, in James Hinton's\r\npresence, the conversation turned on music, and it was suggested that,\r\nowing to the limited number of musical combinations and the unlimited\r\nnumber of musical compositions, a time would come when all music would\r\nonly be a repetition of exhausted harmonies. Hinton remarked that then\r\nwould come a man so inspired by a new spirit that his feeling would be,\r\nnot that _all_ music has been written, but that no _music_ has yet been\r\nwritten. It was a memorable saying. In every field that is the perpetual\r\nproclamation of genius: Behold! I create all things new. And in this\r\nfield of love we can conceive of no age in which to the inspired seer it\r\nwill not be possible to feel: There has yet been no _love_!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[69] See especially Sidney Lee, \"Ovid and Shakespeare's Sonnets,\"\r\n_Quarterly Review_, April, 1909.\r\n\r\n[70] Montaigne, _Essais_, Book III, chap. V.\r\n\r\n[71] See e.g. Mrs. Fraser, _World's Work and Play_, December, 1906.\r\n\r\n[72] A more modern feeling for love and marriage begins to emerge,\r\nhowever, at a much earlier period, with Menander and the New Comedy.\r\nE.F.M. Benecke, in his interesting little book on _Antimachus of\r\nColophon and the Position of Women in Greek Poetry_, believes that the\r\nromantic idea (that is to say, the idea that a woman is a worthy object\r\nfor a man's love, and that such love may well be the chief, if not the\r\nonly, aim of a man's life) had originally been propounded by Antimachus\r\nat the end of the fifth century B.C. Antimachus, said to have been the\r\nfriend of Plato, had been united to a woman of Lydia (where women, we\r\nknow, occupied a very high position) and her death inspired him to write\r\na long poem, _Lyde_, \"the first love poem ever addressed by a Greek to\r\nhis wife after death.\" Only a few lines of this poem survive. But\r\nAntimachus seems to have greatly influenced Philetas (whom Croiset calls\r\n\"the first of the Alexandrians\") and Asclepiades of Samos, tender and\r\nexquisite poets whom also we only know by a few fragments. Benecke's\r\narguments, therefore, however probable, cannot be satisfactorily\r\nsubstantiated.\r\n\r\n[73] As I have elsewhere pointed out (_Studies in the Psychology of Sex_,\r\nVol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" chap. IX), most modern\r\nauthorities--Friedlaender, Dill, Donaldson, etc.--consider that there was\r\nno real moral decline in the later Roman Empire; we must not accept the\r\npictures presented by satirists, pagan or Christian, as of general\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n[74] I have discussed this phase of early Christianity in the sixth\r\nvolume of _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_, \"Sex in Relation to\r\nSociety,\" chap.

The\r\nfamous work of Firenzuola (born 1493) entitled _Dialogo delle Bellezze\r\ndelle Donne_, was published in 1548.

VI.\r\n\r\n[83] I may quote the following remarks from a communication I have\r\nreceived from a University man: \"I am prepared to show women, and to\r\nexpect from them, precisely the same amount of consideration as I show\r\nto or expect from other men, but I rather resent being expected to make\r\na preferential difference. For example, in a crowded tram I see no more\r\nadequate reason for giving up my seat to a young and healthy girl than\r\nfor expecting her to give up hers to me; I would do so cheerfully for an\r\nold person of either sex on the ground that I am probably better fit to\r\nstand the fatigue of 'strap-hanging,' and because I recognize that some\r\nrespect is due to age; but if persons get into over-full vehicles they\r\nshould not expect first-comers to turn out of their seats merely because\r\nthey happen to be men.\" This writer acknowledges, indeed, that he is not\r\nvery sensitive to the erotic attraction of women, but it is probable\r\nthat the changing status of women will render the attitude he expresses\r\nmore and more common among men.\r\n\r\n[84] _Ante_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n[85] \"Women then were queens,\" as Taine writes (_L'Ancien Regime_, Vol.\r\nI, p. 219), and he gives references to illustrate the point.\r\n\r\n[86] Goethe, _Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre_, Book II, ch.

The greater part of the Victorian period was\r\nmarked by this expansion of population, which reached its highest point\r\nin the early years of the second half of that period. While the\r\npopulation of England was thus increasing with ever greater rapidity at\r\nhome, at the same time the English-speaking peoples overspread the whole\r\nof North America, and colonized the fertile fringe of Australia. It was,\r\non a still larger scale, a phenomenon similar to that which had occurred\r\nthree hundred years earlier, when Spain covered the world and founded an\r\nempire upon which, as Spaniards proudly boasted, the sun never set.\r\n\r\nWhen now, a century later, we survey the situation, not only has\r\nindustrial and commercial activity ceased to be a special attribute of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons--since the Germans have here shown themselves to\r\npossess qualities of the highest order, and other countries are rapidly\r\nrivalling them--but within the limits of the English-speaking world\r\nitself the English have found formidable rivals in the Americans.\r\nUnderlying, however, even these great changes there is a still more\r\nfundamental fact to be considered, a fact which affects all branches of\r\nthe race; and that is, that the Anglo-Saxons have passed their great\r\nepoch of expansion and that their birth-rate is rapidly falling to a\r\nnormal level, that is to say, to the average level of the world in\r\ngeneral. Disregarding the extremely important point of the death-rate in\r\nits bearing on the birth-rate, England is seen to possess a medium\r\nbirth-rate among European countries, not among the countries with a high\r\nbirth-rate, like Russia, Roumania, or Bulgaria, nor among those with a\r\nlow birth-rate, like Sweden, Belgium, and France. It was in this last\r\ncountry that the movement of decline in the European birth-rate began,\r\nand though the rate of decline has in France now become very gradual the\r\nlong period through which it has extended has placed France in the\r\nlowest place, so far as Europe is concerned. In 1908 out of a total of\r\nover 11,000,000 French families, in nearly 2,000,000 there were no\r\nchildren, and in nearly 3,000,000 there was only one child.[91] The\r\ngeneral decline in the European birth-rate, during the years 1901-1905,\r\nwas only slight in Switzerland, Ireland and Spain, while it was large\r\nnot only in France, but in Italy, Servia, England and Wales, and\r\nespecially in Hungary (while, outside Europe, it was largest of all in\r\nSouth Australia). Since 1905 there has been a further general decline\r\nthroughout Europe, only excepting Ireland, Bulgaria, and Roumania. In\r\nPrussia in 1881-1885 the birth-rate was 37.4; in 1909 it was only 31.8;\r\nwhile in the German Empire as a whole it is throughout lower than in\r\nPrussia, though somewhat higher than in England. In Austria and Spain\r\nalone of European countries during the twenty years between 1881 and\r\n1901 was there any tendency for the fertility of wives to increase. In\r\nall other countries there was a decrease, greatest in Belgium, next\r\ngreatest in France, then in England.[92]\r\n\r\nIf we consider the question, not on the basis of the crude birth-rate,\r\nbut of the \"corrected\" birth-rate, with more exact reference to the\r\nchild-producing elements in the population, as is done by Newsholme and\r\nStevenson,[93] we find that the greatest decline has taken place in New\r\nSouth Wales, then in Victoria, Belgium, and Saxony, followed by New\r\nZealand. But France, the German Empire generally, England, and Denmark\r\nall show a considerable fall; while Sweden and Norway show a fall,\r\nwhich, especially in Norway, is slight. Norway illustrates the\r\ndifference between the \"crude\" and the \"corrected\" birth-rate; the crude\r\nbirth-rate is lower than that of Saxony, but the corrected birth-rate is\r\nhigher. Ireland, again, has a very low crude birth-rate, but the\r\npopulation of child-bearing age has a high birth-rate, considerably\r\nhigher than that of England.\r\n\r\nThus while forty years ago it was usual for both the English and the\r\nGermans to contemplate, perhaps with some complacency, the spectacle of\r\nthe falling birth-rate in France as compared with the high birth-rate in\r\nEngland and Germany, we are now seen to be all marching along the same\r\nroad. In 1876 the English birth-rate reached its maximum of 36.3 per\r\nthousand; while in France the birth-rate now appears almost to have\r\nreached its lowest level. Germany, like England, now also has a falling\r\nbirth-rate, though it will take some time to sink to the English level.\r\nThe birth-rate for Germany generally is still much higher than for\r\nEngland generally, but urbanization in Germany seems to have a greater\r\ninfluence than in England in lowering the birth-rate, and for many years\r\npast the birth-rate of Berlin has been lower than that of London. The\r\nbirth-rate in Germany has long been steadily falling, and the increase\r\nin the population of Germany is due to a concomitant steady fall in the\r\ndeath-rate, a fall to which there are inevitable natural limits.[94]\r\nMoreover, as Flux has shown,[95] urbanization is going on at a greater\r\nspeed in Germany than in England, and practically the entire natural\r\nincrease of the German population for a quarter of a century has drifted\r\ninto the towns. But the death-rate of the young in German towns is far\r\nhigher than in English towns, and the first five years of life in\r\nGermany produce as much mortality as the first twenty-five years in\r\nEngland.[96] So that a thousand children born in England add far more to\r\nthe population than a thousand children born in Germany. The average\r\nnumber of children per family in German towns is less than in English\r\ntowns of the same size. These results, reached by Flux, suggest that in\r\na few years' time the rate of increase in the German population will be\r\nlower than it is at present in England. In England, since 1876, the\r\ndecline has been so rapid as to be equal to 20 per cent within a\r\ngeneration, and in some of the large towns to 40 per cent. Against this\r\nthere has, indeed, to be set the general tendency during recent years\r\nfor the death-rate to fall also. But this saving of life has until\r\nlately been effected mainly at the higher ages; there has been but\r\nlittle saving of the lives of infants, upon whom the death-rate falls\r\nmost heavily. Accompanying this falling off in the number of children\r\nproduced there has often been, as we might expect, a fall in the\r\nmarriage-rate; but this has been less regular, and of late the\r\nmarriage-rate has sometimes been high when the birth-rate was low.[97]\r\nThere has, however, been a steady postponement of the average age at\r\nwhich marriage takes place. On the whole, the main fact that emerges is,\r\nthat nowadays in England we marry less and have fewer children.\r\n\r\nThis is now a familiar fact, and perhaps it should not excite very great\r\nsurprise. England is an old and fairly stable country, and it may be\r\nsaid that it would be unreasonable to expect its population to retain\r\nindefinitely a high degree of fertility. Whether this is so or not,\r\nthere is the further consideration to be borne in mind that, during\r\nnearly the whole of the Victorian period, emigration of the most\r\nvigorous stocks took place to a very marked extent. It is not difficult\r\nto see the influence of such emigration in connection with the greatly\r\ndiminished population of Ireland, as compared with Scotland; and we may\r\nreasonably infer that it has had its part in the decreased fertility of\r\nthe United Kingdom generally.\r\n\r\nBut we encounter the remarkable fact that this decreased fertility of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon populations is not confined to the United Kingdom. It is\r\neven more pronounced in those very lands to which so many thousand\r\nshiploads of our best people have been taken. In the United States the\r\nquestion has attracted much attention, and there is little disagreement\r\namong careful observers as to the main facts of the situation. The\r\nquestion is, indeed, somewhat difficult for two reasons: the\r\nregistration of births is not generally compulsory in the United States,\r\nand, even when general facts are ascertained, it is still necessary to\r\ndistinguish between the different classes of the population. Our\r\nconclusions must therefore be based, not on the course of a general\r\nbirth-rate, but on the most reliable calculations, based on the census\r\nreturns and on the average size of the family at different periods, and\r\namong different classes of the population. A bulletin of the Census\r\nBureau of the United States since 1860 was prepared a few years ago by\r\nWalter F. Wilcox, of Cornell University. It determines from the data in\r\nthe census office the proportion of children to the number of women of\r\nchild-bearing age in the country at different periods, and shows that\r\nthere has been, on the whole, a fall from the beginning to the end of\r\nthe last century. Children under ten years of age constituted one-third\r\nof the population at the beginning of the century, and at the end less\r\nthan one-fourth of the total population. Between 1850 and 1860 the\r\nproportion of children to women between fifteen and forty-nine years of\r\nage increased, but since 1860 it has constantly decreased. In 1860 the\r\nnumber of children under five years of age to one thousand women between\r\nfifteen and forty-nine years of age was 634; in 1900 it was only 474.\r\nThe proportion of children to potential mothers in 1900 was only\r\nthree-fourths as large as in 1860. In the north and west of the United\r\nStates the decline has been regular, while in the south the change has\r\nbeen less regular and the decline less marked. A comparison is made\r\nbetween the proportion of children in the foreign-born population and in\r\nthe American. The former was 710 to the latter's 462. In the coloured\r\npopulation the proportion of children is greater than in the\r\ncorresponding white population.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever that, from the eighteenth century to the\r\ntwentieth, there has been a steady decrease in the size of the American\r\nfamily. Franklin, in the eighteenth century, estimated that the average\r\nnumber of children to a married couple was eight; genealogical records\r\nshow that, while in the seventeenth century it was nearly seven, it was\r\nover six at the end of the eighteenth century. Since then, as Engelmann\r\nand others have shown, there has been a steady decrease in the size of\r\nthe family; in the earlier years of the nineteenth century there were\r\nbetween four and five children to each marriage, while by the end of the\r\ncentury the number of children had fallen to between four and but little\r\nover one. Engelmann finds that there is but a very trifling difference\r\nin this respect between the upper and the lower social classes; the\r\naverage for the labouring classes at St. Louis he finds to be about two,\r\nand for the higher classes a little less. It is among the foreign-born\r\npopulation, and among those of foreign parents, that the larger families\r\nare found; thus Kuczynski, by analysing the census, finds that in\r\nMassachusetts the average number of children to each married woman among\r\nthe American-born of all social classes is 2.7, while among the\r\nforeign-born of all social classes it is 4.5. Moreover, sterility is\r\nmuch more frequent among American women than among foreign women in\r\nAmerica. Among various groups in Boston, St. Louis, and elsewhere it\r\nvaries between 20 and 23 per cent, and in some smaller groups is even\r\nconsiderably higher, while among the foreign-born it is only 13 per\r\ncent. The net result is that the general natality of the United States\r\nat the present day is about equal to that of France, but that, when we\r\nanalyse the facts, the fertility of the old native-born American\r\npopulation of mainly Anglo-Saxon origin is found to be lower than that\r\nof France. This element, therefore, is rapidly dwindling away in the\r\nUnited States. The general level of the birth-rate is maintained by the\r\nforeign immigrants, who in many States (as in New York, Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, and Minnesota) constitute the majority of the population, and\r\naltogether number considerably over ten millions. Among these immigrants\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon element is now very small. Indeed, the whole North\r\nEuropean contingent among the American immigrants, which was formerly\r\nnearly 90 per cent of the whole, has since 1890 steadily sunk, and the\r\nmajority of the immigrants now belong to the Central, Southern, and\r\nEastern European stocks. The racial, and, it is probable, the\r\npsychological characteristics of the people of the United States are\r\nthus beginning to undergo, not merely modification, but, it may almost\r\nbe said, a revolution. If, as we may well believe, the influence of the\r\noriginal North-European racial elements--Anglo-Saxon, Dutch, and\r\nFrench--still continues to persist in the United States, it can only be\r\nthe influence of a small aristocracy, maintained by intellect and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to Canada, a land that is imposing, less by the actual size\r\nof the population than by the vast tracts it possesses for its\r\ndevelopment, the question has not yet been fully investigated; but such\r\nfacts and official publications as I have been able to obtain all\r\nindicate that, in this matter, the English Canadians approximate to the\r\nnative Americans. In the United States it is the European immigrants who\r\nmaintain the general population at a productive level, and thus\r\nindirectly oust the Anglo-Saxon element. In Canada the chief dividing\r\nline is between the Anglo-Saxon element and the old French element in\r\nthe population; and here it is the French Canadians who are gaining\r\nground on the English elements in the population. Engelmann ascertained\r\nthat an examination of one thousand families in the records of Quebec\r\nLife Assurance companies shows 9.2 children on the average to the French\r\nCanadian child-bearing woman. It is found also from the records of the\r\nFrench Canadian Society for Artisans that 500 families from town\r\ndistricts, taken at random, show 9.06 children per family, and 500\r\nfamilies from country districts show 9.33 children per family.[98] It\r\nmust be remembered that this average, which is even higher than that\r\nfound in Russia, the most prolific of European countries, is not quite\r\nthe same as the number of children per marriage; but it indicates very\r\ngreat fertility, while it may be noted also that sterile marriages are\r\ncomparatively rare among French Canadians, although among English\r\nCanadians the proportion of childless families is found to be almost\r\nexactly the same (nearly 20 per cent) as among the infertile Americans\r\nof Massachusetts. The annual Reports of the Registrar-General of\r\nOntario, a province which is predominantly of Anglo-Saxon origin, show\r\nthat the average birth-rate during the decade 1899-1908 has been 22.3\r\nper 1000; it must be noted, however, that there has been a gradual rise\r\nfrom a rate of 19.4 in 1899 to one of 25.6 in 1908. The report of Mr.\r\nPrevost, the recorder of vital statistics for the predominantly French\r\nprovince of Quebec, shows much higher rates. The general birth-rate for\r\nthe province for the year 1901 is high, being 35.2, much higher than\r\nthat of England, and nearly as high as that of Germany. If, however, we\r\nconsider the thirty-five counties of the province in which the\r\npopulation is almost exclusively French Canadian, we find that 35\r\nrepresents almost the lowest average; as many as twenty-two of these\r\ncounties show a rate of over forty, and one (Yamaska) reached 51.52. It\r\nis very evident that, in order to pull down these high birth-rates to\r\nthe general level of 35.2, we have to assume a much lower birth-rate\r\namong the counties in which the English element is considerable. It must\r\nbe remembered, however, that infant mortality is high among the French\r\nCanadians. The French Canadian Catholic, it has been said, would shrink\r\nin horror from such an unnatural crime as limiting his family before\r\nbirth, but he sees nothing repugnant to God or man in allowing the\r\nsurplus excess of children to die after birth. In this he is at one with\r\nthe Chinese. Dr. E.P. La Chapelle, the President of the Provincial\r\nConseil d'Hygiene, wrote some years ago to Professor Davidson, in\r\nanswer to inquiries: \"I do not believe it would be correct to ascribe\r\nthe phenomenon to any single cause, and I am convinced it is the result\r\nof several factors. For one, the first cause of the heavy infant\r\nmortality among the French Canadians is their very heavy natality, each\r\nfamily being composed of an average of twelve children, and instances of\r\nfamilies of fifteen, eighteen, and even twenty-four children being not\r\nuncommon. The super-abundance of children renders, I think, parents less\r\ncareful about them.\"[99]\r\n\r\nThe net result is a slight increase on the part of the French Canadians,\r\nas compared with the English element in the province, as becomes clear\r\nwhen we compare the proportion of the population of English, Scotch,\r\nIrish, and all other nationalities with the total population of the\r\nprovince, now and thirty years ago. In 1871 it was 21 per cent; in 1901\r\nit was only 19 per cent. The decrease of the Anglo-Saxons may here\r\nappear to be small, though it must be remembered that thirty years is\r\nbut a short period in the history of a nation; but it is significant\r\nwhen we bear in mind that the English element has here been constantly\r\nreinforced by immigrants (who, as the experience of the United States\r\nshows, are by no means an infertile class), and that such reinforcement\r\ncannot be expected to continue in the future.\r\n\r\nFrom Australia comes the same story of the decline of Anglo-Saxon\r\nfertility. In nearly all the Australian colonies the highest birth-rate\r\nwas reached some twenty or thirty years ago. Since then there has been a\r\nmore or less steady fall, accompanied by a marked decrease in the number\r\nof marriages, and a tendency to postpone the age of marriage. One\r\ncolony, Western Australia, has a birth-rate which sometimes fluctuates\r\nabove that of England; but it is the youngest of the colonies, and, at\r\npresent, that with the smallest population, largely composed of recent\r\nimmigrants. We may be quite sure that its comparatively high birth-rate\r\nis merely a temporary phenomenon. A very notable fact about the\r\nAustralian birth-rate is the extreme rapidity with which the fall has\r\ntaken place; thus Queensland, in 1890, had a birth-rate of 37, but by\r\n1899 the rate had steadily fallen to 27, and the Victorian rate during\r\nthe same period fell from 33 to 26 per thousand. In New South Wales, the\r\nstate of things has been carefully studied by Mr. Coghlan, formerly\r\nGovernment statistician of New South Wales, who comes to the conclusion\r\nthat the proportion of fertile marriages is declining, and that (as in\r\nthe United States) it is the recent European immigrants only who show a\r\ncomparatively high birth-rate. Until 1880, Coghlan states, the\r\nAustralasian birth-rate was about 38 per thousand, and the average\r\nnumber of children to the family about 5.4. In 1901 the birth-rate had\r\nalready fallen to 27.6 and the size of the family to 3.6 children.[100] It\r\nshould be added that in all the Australasian colonies the birth-rate\r\nreached its lowest point some years ago, and may now be regarded as in a\r\nstate of normal equipoise with a slight tendency to rise. The case of\r\nNew Zealand is specially interesting. New Zealand once had the highest\r\nbirth-rate of all the Australasian colonies; it is without doubt the\r\nmost advanced of all in social and legislative matters; a variety of\r\nsocial reforms, which other countries are struggling for, are, in New\r\nZealand, firmly established. Its prosperity is shown by the fact that it\r\nhas the lowest death-rate of any country in the world, only 10.2 per\r\nthousand, as against 24 in Austria and 22 in France; it cannot even be\r\nsaid that the marriage-rate is very low, for it is scarcely lower than\r\nthat of Austria, where the birth-rate is high. Yet the birth-rate in New\r\nZealand fell as the social prosperity of the country rose, reaching its\r\nlowest point in 1899.\r\n\r\nWe thus find that from the three great Anglo-Saxon centres of the\r\nworld--north, west, and south--the same story comes. We need not\r\nconsider the case of South Africa, for it is well recognized that there\r\nthe English constitute a comparatively infertile fringe, mostly confined\r\nto the towns, while the earlier Dutch element is far more prolific and\r\nfirmly rooted in the soil. The position of the Dutch there is much the\r\nsame as that of the French in Canada.\r\n\r\nThus we find that among highly civilized races generally, and not least\r\namong the English-speaking peoples who were once regarded as peculiarly\r\nprolific, a great diminution of reproductive activity has taken place\r\nduring the past forty years, and is in some countries still taking\r\nplace. But before we proceed to consider its significance it may be well\r\nto look a little more closely at our facts.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the \"crude\" birth-rate is not an altogether reliable\r\nindex of the reproductive energy of a nation. Various circumstances may\r\ncause an excess or a defect of persons of reproductive age in a\r\ncommunity, and unless we allow for these variations, we cannot estimate\r\nwhether that community is exercising its reproductive powers in a fairly\r\nnormal manner. But there is another and still more important\r\nconsideration always to be borne in mind before we can attach any\r\nfar-reaching significance even to the corrected birth-rate. We have,\r\nthat is, to bear in mind that a high or a low birth-rate has no meaning,\r\nso far as the growth of a nation is concerned, unless it is considered\r\nin relation to the death-rate. The natural increase of a nation is not\r\nthe result of its birth-rate, but of its birth-rate minus its\r\ndeath-rate. A low birth-rate with a low death-rate (as in Australasia)\r\nproduces a far greater natural increase than a low birth-rate with a\r\nrather high death-rate (as in France), and may even produce as great an\r\nincrease as a very high birth-rate with a very high death-rate (as in\r\nRussia). Many worthy people might have been spared the utterance of\r\nfoolish and mischievous jeremiads, if, instead of being content with a\r\nhasty glance at the crude birth-rate, they had paused to consider this\r\nfairly obvious fact.\r\n\r\nThere is an intimate connection between a high birth-rate and a high\r\ndeath-rate, between a low birth-rate and a low death-rate. It may not,\r\nindeed, be an absolutely necessary connection, and is not the outcome of\r\nany mysterious \"law.\" But it usually exists, and the reasons are fairly\r\nobvious. We have already encountered the statement from an official\r\nCanadian source that the large infantile mortality of French Canadian\r\nfamilies is due to parental carelessness, consequent, no doubt, not only\r\non the dimly felt consciousness that children are cheap, but much more\r\non inability to cope with the manifold cares involved by a large family.\r\nAmong the English working class every doctor knows the thinly veiled\r\nindifference or even repulsion with which women view the seemingly\r\nendless stream of babies they give birth to. Among the Berlin working\r\nclass, also, Hamburger's important investigation has indicated how\r\nserious a cause of infantile mortality this may be. By taking 374\r\nworking-class women, who had been married twenty years and conceived\r\n3183 times, he found that the net result in surviving children was\r\nrelatively more than twice as great among the women who had only had one\r\nchild when compared to the women who had had fifteen children. The women\r\nwith only one child brought 76.47 per cent of these children to\r\nmaturity; the women who had produced fifteen children could only bring\r\n30.66 of them to maturity; the intermediate groups showed a gradual fall\r\nto this low level, the only exception being that the mothers of three\r\nchildren were somewhat more successful than the mothers of two children.\r\nAmong well-to-do mothers Hamburger found no such marked contrast\r\nbetween the net product of large families as compared to small\r\nfamilies.[101]\r\n\r\nIt we look at the matter from a wider standpoint we can have no\r\ndifficulty in realizing that a community which is reproducing itself\r\nrapidly must always be in an unstable state of disorganization highly\r\nunfavourable to the welfare of its members, and especially of the\r\nnew-comers; a community which is reproducing itself slowly is in a\r\nstable and organized condition which permits it to undertake adequately\r\nthe guardianship of its new members. The high infantile mortality of the\r\ncommunity with a high birth-rate merely means that that community is\r\nunconsciously making a violent and murderous effort to attain to the\r\nmore stable and organized level of the country with a low birth-rate.\r\n\r\nThe English Registrar-General in 1907 estimated the natural increase by\r\nexcess of births over deaths as exceptionally high (higher than that of\r\nEngland) in several Australian Colonies, in the Balkan States, in\r\nRussia, the Netherlands, the German Empire, Denmark, and Norway, though\r\nin the majority of these lands the birth-rate is very low. On the other\r\nhand, the natural increase by excess of births over deaths is below the\r\nEnglish rate in Austria, in Hungary, in Japan, in Italy, in Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Ontario, though in the majority of\r\nthese lands the birth-rate is high, and in some very high.[102] In most\r\ncases it is the high death-rate in infancy and childhood which exercises\r\nthe counterbalancing influence against a high birth-rate; the death-rate\r\nin adult life may be quite moderate. And with few exceptions we find\r\nthat a high infantile mortality accompanies a high birth-rate, while a\r\nlow infantile mortality accompanies a low birth-rate. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that even an extremely high infantile mortality is no\r\nimpediment to a large natural increase provided the birth-rate is\r\nextremely high to a more than corresponding extent. But a natural\r\nincrease thus achieved seems to be accompanied by far more disastrous\r\nsocial conditions than when an equally large increase is achieved by a\r\nlow infantile death-rate working in association with a low birth-rate.\r\nThus in Norway on one side of the world and in Australasia on the\r\nopposite side we see a large natural increase effected not by a profuse\r\nexpenditure of mostly wasted births but by an economy in deaths, and the\r\nincrease thus effected is accompanied by highly favourable social\r\nconditions, and great national vigour. Norway appears to have the lowest\r\ninfantile death-rate in Europe.[103]\r\n\r\nRubin has suggested that the fairest measure of a country's well-being,\r\nas regards its actual vitality--without direct regard, of course, to the\r\ncountry's economic prosperity--is the square of the death-rate divided\r\nby the birth-rate.[104] Sir J.A. Baines, who accepts this test, states\r\nthat Argentina with its high birth-rate and low death-rate stands even\r\nabove Norway, and Australia still higher, while the climax for the world\r\nis attained by New Zealand, which has attained \"the nearest approach to\r\nimmortality yet on record.\"[105] The order of descending well-being in\r\nEurope is thus represented (at the year 1900) by Norway, Sweden,\r\nDenmark, Holland, England, Scotland, Finland, Belgium, Switzerland,\r\nGermany, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Austria, France, and Spain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in all the countries, probably without exception, in\r\nwhich a large natural increase is effected by the efforts of an immense\r\nbirth-rate to overcome an enormous death-rate the end is only effected\r\nwith much friction and misery, and the process is accompanied by a\r\ngeneral retardation of civilization.\r\n\r\n\"The greater the number of children,\" as Hamburger puts it, \"the greater\r\nthe cost of each survivor to the family and to the State.\"\r\n\r\nRussia presents not only the most typical but the most stupendous and\r\nappalling example of this process. Thirty years ago the mortality of\r\ninfants under one year was three times that of Norway, nearly double\r\nthat of England. More recently (1896-1900) the infantile mortality in\r\nRussia has fallen from 313 to 261, but as that of the other countries\r\nhas also fallen it still preserves nearly the same relative position,\r\nremaining the highest in Europe, while if we compare it with countries\r\noutside Europe we find it is considerably more than four times greater\r\nthan that of South Australia. In one town in the government of Perm,\r\nsome years ago if not still, the mortality of infants under one year\r\nregularly reached 45 per cent, and the deaths of children under five\r\nyears constituted half the total mortality. This is abnormally high even\r\nfor Russia, but for all Russia it was found that of the boys born in a\r\nsingle year during the second half of the last century only 50 per cent\r\nreached their twenty-first year, and even of these only 37.6 per cent\r\nwere fit for military service. It is estimated that there die in Russia\r\n15 per thousand more individuals than among the same number in England;\r\nthis excess mortality represents a loss of 1,650,000 lives to the State\r\nevery year.[106]\r\n\r\nThus Russia has the highest birth-rate and at the same time the highest\r\ndeath-rate. The large countries which, after Russia, have the highest\r\ninfantile mortality are Austria, Hungary, Prussia, Spain, Italy, and\r\nJapan; all these, as we should expect, have a somewhat high birth-rate.\r\n\r\nThe case of Japan is interesting as that of a vigorous young Eastern\r\nnation, which has assimilated Western ways and is encountering the evils\r\nwhich come of those ways. Japan is certainly worthy of all our\r\nadmiration for the skill and vigour with which it has affirmed its young\r\nnationality along Western lines. But when the vital statistics of Japan\r\nare vaguely referred to either as a model for our imitation or as a\r\nthreatening peril to us, we may do well to look into the matter a little\r\nmore closely. The infantile mortality of Japan (1908) is 157, a very\r\nhigh figure, 50 per cent higher than that of England, much more than\r\ndouble that of New Zealand, or South Australia. Moreover, it has rapidly\r\nrisen during the last ten years. The birth-rate of Japan in 1901-2 was\r\nhigh (36), though it has since fallen to the level of ten years ago. But\r\nthe death-rate has risen concomitantly (to over 24 per 1000), and has\r\ncontinued to rise notwithstanding the slight decline in the birth-rate.\r\nWe see here a tendency to the sinister combination of a falling\r\nbirth-rate with a rising death-rate.[107] It is obvious that such a\r\ntendency, if continued, will furnish a serious problem to Japanese\r\nsocial reformers, and at the same time make it impossible for Western\r\nalarmists to regard the rise of Japan as a menace to the world.\r\n\r\nIt is behind China that these alarmists, when driven from every other\r\nposition, finally entrench themselves. \"The ultimate future of these\r\nislands may be to the Chinese,\" incautiously exclaims Mr. Sidney Webb,\r\nwho on many subjects, unconnected with China, speaks with authority. The\r\nknowledge of the vital statistics of China possessed by our alarmists is\r\nvague to the most extreme degree, but as the knowledge of all of us is\r\nscarcely less vague, they assume that their position is fairly safe.\r\nThat, however, is an altogether questionable assumption. It seems to be\r\nquite true--though in the absence of exact statistics it may not be\r\ncertain--that the birth-rate in China is very high. But it is quite\r\ncertain that the infantile death-rate is extremely high. \"Out of ten\r\nchildren born among us, three, normally the weakest three, will fail to\r\ngrow up: out of ten children born in China these weakest three will die,\r\nand probably five more besides,\" writes Professor Ross, who is\r\nintimately acquainted with Chinese conditions, and has closely\r\nquestioned thirty-three physicians practising in various parts of\r\nChina.[108] Matignon, a French physician familiar with China, states that\r\nit is the custom for a woman to suckle her child for at least three\r\nyears; should pregnancy occur during this period, it is usual, and quite\r\nlegal, to procure abortion. Infants brought up by hand are fed on\r\nrice-flour and water, and consequently they nearly all die.[109]\r\n\r\nPutting aside altogether the question of infanticide, such a state of\r\nthings is far from incredible when we remember the extremely insanitary\r\nstate of China, the superstitions that flourish unchecked, and the\r\nfamines, floods, and pestilences that devastate the country. It would\r\nappear probable that when vital statistics are introduced into China\r\nthey will reveal a condition of things very similar to that we find in\r\nRussia, but in a more marked degree. No doubt it is a state of things\r\nwhich will be remedied. It is a not unreasonable assumption, supported\r\nby many indications, that China will follow Japan in the adoption of\r\nWestern methods of civilization.[110] These methods, as we know, involve\r\nin the end a low birth-rate with a general tendency to a lower\r\ndeath-rate. Neither in the near nor in the remote future, under present\r\nconditions or under probable future conditions, is there any reason for\r\nimagining that the Chinese are likely to replace the Europeans in\r\nEurope.[111]\r\n\r\nThis preliminary survey of the ground may enable us to realize that not\r\nonly must we be cautious in attaching importance to the crude birth-rate\r\nuntil it is corrected, but that even as usually corrected the birth-rate\r\ncan give us no clue at all to natural increase because there is a marked\r\ntendency for the birth-rate and the infantile death-rate to rise or sink\r\ntogether. Moreover, it is evident that we have also to realize that from\r\nthe point of view of society and civilization there is a vast difference\r\nbetween the natural increase which is achieved by the effort of an\r\nenormously high birth-rate to overcome an almost correspondingly high\r\ndeath-rate and the natural increase which is attained by the dominance\r\nof a low birth-rate over a still lower death-rate.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared the ground, we may proceed to attempt the\r\ninterpretation of the declining birth-rate which marks civilization, and\r\nto discuss its significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that it is not usual to consider the question of the\r\ndeclining birth-rate from a broad or scientific standpoint. As we have\r\nseen, no attempt is usually made to correct the crude birth-rate; still\r\nmore rarely is it pointed out that we cannot consider the significance\r\nof a falling birth-rate apart from the question of the death-rate, and\r\nthat the net increase or decrease in a nation can only be judged by\r\ntaking both these factors into account. It is scarcely necessary to add,\r\nin view of so superficial a way of looking at the problem, that we\r\nhardly ever find any attempt to deal with the more fundamental question\r\nof the meaning of a low birth-rate, and the problematical character of\r\nthe advantages of rapid multiplication. The whole question is usually\r\nleft to the ignorant preachers of the gospel of brute force, would-be\r\npatriots who desire their own country to increase at the cost of all\r\nother countries, not merely in ignorance of the fact that the crude\r\nbirth-rate is not the index of increase, but reckless of the effect\r\ntheir desire, if fulfilled, would have upon all the higher and finer\r\nends of living.\r\n\r\nWhen the question is thus narrowly and ignorantly considered, it is\r\nusual to account for the decreased birth-rate, the smaller average\r\nfamilies, and the tendency to postpone the age of marriage, as due\r\nmainly to a love of luxury and vice, combined with a newly acquired\r\nacquaintance with Neo-Malthusian methods,[112] which must be combated, and\r\nmay successfully be combated, by inculcating, as a moral and patriotic\r\nduty, the necessity of marrying early and procreating large families.[113]\r\nIn France, the campaign against the religious Orders in their\r\neducational capacity, while doubtless largely directed against\r\neducational inefficiency, was also supported by the feeling that such\r\neducation is not on the side of family life; and Arsene Dumont, one of\r\nthe most vigorous champions of a strenuously active policy for\r\nincreasing the birth-rate, openly protested against allowing any place\r\nas teachers to priests, monks, and nuns, whose direct and indirect\r\ninfluence must degrade the conception of sex and its duties while\r\nexalting the place of celibacy. In the United States, also, Engelmann,\r\nwho, as a gynaecologist, was able to see this process from behind the\r\nscenes, urged his fellow-countrymen \"to stay the dangerous and criminal\r\npractices which are the main determining factors of decreasing\r\nfecundity, and which deprive women of health, the family of its highest\r\nblessings, and the nation of its staunchest support.\"[114]\r\n\r\nWe must, however, look at these phenomena a little more broadly, and\r\nbring them into relation with other series of phenomena. It is almost\r\nbeyond dispute that a voluntary restriction of the number of offspring\r\nby Neo-Malthusian practices is at least one of the chief methods by\r\nwhich the birth-rate has been lowered. It may not indeed be--and\r\nprobably, as we shall see, is not--the only method. It has even been\r\ndenied that the prevalence of Neo-Malthusian practices counts at all.[115]\r\nThus while Coghlan, the Government Statistician of New South Wales,\r\nconcludes that the decline in the birth-rate in the Australian\r\nCommonwealth was due to \"the art of applying artificial checks to\r\nconception,\" McLean, the Government Statistician of Victoria, concludes\r\nthat it was \"due mainly to natural causes.\" [116] He points out that when\r\nthe birth-rate in Australia, half a century ago, was nearly 43 per 1000,\r\nthe population consisted chiefly of men and women at the reproductive\r\nperiod of life, and that since then the proportion of persons at these\r\nages has declined, leading necessarily to a decline in the crude\r\nbirth-rate. If we compare the birth-rate of communities among women of\r\nthe same age-periods, McLean argues, we may obtain results quite\r\ndifferent from the crude birth-rate. Thus the crude birth-rate of\r\nBuda-Pesth is much higher than that of New South Wales, but if we\r\nascertain the birth-rate of married women at different age-periods (15\r\nto 20, 20 to 25, etc.) the New South Wales birth-rate is higher for\r\nevery age-period than that of Buda-Pesth. McLean considers that in young\r\ncommunities with many vigorous immigrants the population is normally\r\nmore prolific than in older and more settled communities, and that\r\nhardships and financial depression still more depress the birth-rate. He\r\nfurther emphasizes the important relationship, which we must never lose\r\nsight of in this connection, between a high birth-rate and a high\r\ndeath-rate, especially a high infantile death-rate, and he believes,\r\nindeed, that \"the solution of the problem of the general decline in the\r\nbirth-rate throughout all civilized communities lies in the preservation\r\nof human life.\" The mechanism of the connection would be, he maintains,\r\nthat prolonged suckling in the case of living children increases the\r\nintervals between childbearing. As we have seen, there is a tendency,\r\nthough not a rigid and invariable necessity,[117] for a high birth-rate to\r\nbe associated with a high infantile death-rate, and a low birth-rate\r\nwith a low infantile death-rate. Thus in Victoria, we have the striking\r\nfact that while the birth-rate has declined 24 per cent the infantile\r\ndeath-rate has declined approximately to the still greater extent of 27\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the chief cause of the reduction of the birth-rate has been its\r\nvoluntary restriction by preventive methods due to the growth of\r\nintelligence, knowledge, and foresight. In all the countries where a\r\nmarked decline in the birth-rate has occurred there is good reason to\r\nbelieve that Neo-Malthusian methods are generally known and practised.\r\nSo far as England is concerned this is certainly the case. A few years\r\nago Mr. Sidney Webb made inquiries among middle-class people in all\r\nparts of the country, and found that in 316 marriages 242 were thus\r\nlimited and only 74 unlimited, while for the ten years 1890-9 out of 120\r\nmarriages 107 were limited and only 13 unlimited, but as five of these\r\n13 were childless there were only 8 unlimited fertile marriages out of\r\n120. As to the causes assigned for limiting the number of children, in\r\n73 out of 128 cases in which particulars were given under this head the\r\npoverty of the parents in relation to their standard of comfort was a\r\nfactor; sexual ill-health--that is, generally, the disturbing effect of\r\nchild-bearing--in 24; and other forms of ill-health of the parents in 38\r\ncases; in 24 cases the disinclination of the wife was a factor, and the\r\ndeath of a parent had in 8 cases terminated the marriage.[118] In the\r\nskilled artisan class there is also good reason to believe that the\r\nvoluntary limitation of families is constantly becoming more usual, and\r\nthe statistics of benefit societies show a marked decline in the\r\nfertility of superior working-class people during recent years; thus it\r\nis stated by Sidney Webb that the Hearts of Oak Friendly Society paid\r\nbenefits on child-birth to 2472 per 10,000 members in 1880; by 1904 the\r\nproportion had fallen to 1165 per 10,000, a much greater fall than\r\noccurred in England generally.\r\n\r\nThe voluntary adoption of preventive precautions may not be, however,\r\nthe only method by which the birth-rate has declined; we may have also\r\nto recognize a concomitant physiological sterility, induced by delayed\r\nmarriage and its various consequences; we have also to recognize\r\npathological sterility due to the impaired vitality and greater\r\nliability to venereal disease of an increasingly urban life; and we may\r\nhave to recognize that stocks differ from one another in fertility.\r\n\r\nThe delay in marriage, as studied in England, is so far apparently\r\nslight; the mean age of marriage for all husbands in England has\r\nincreased from 28.43 in 1896 to 28.88 in 1909, and the mean age of all\r\nwives from 26.21 in 1896 to 26.69 in 1909. This seems a very trifling\r\nrate of progression. If, however, we look at the matter in another way\r\nwe find that there has been an extremely serious reduction in the number\r\nof marriages between 15 to 20, normally the most fecund of all\r\nage-periods. Between 1876 and 1880 (according to the Registrar-General's\r\nReport for 1909) the proportion of minors in 1000 marriages in England\r\nand Wales was 77.8 husbands and 217.0 wives. In 1909 it had fallen to\r\nonly 39.8 husbands and 137.7 wives. It has been held that this has not\r\ngreatly affected the decline in the birth-rate. Its tendency, however,\r\nmust be in that direction. It is true that Engelmann argued that delayed\r\nmarriages had no effect at all on the birth-rate. But it has been\r\nclearly shown that as the age of marriage increases fecundity distinctly\r\ndiminishes.[119] This is illustrated by the specially elaborate statistics\r\nof Scotland for 1855;[120] the number of women having children, that is,\r\nthe fecundity, was higher in the years 15 to 19, than at any subsequent\r\nage-period, except 20 to 24, and the fact that the earliest age-group is\r\nnot absolutely highest is due to the presence of a number of immature\r\nwomen. In New South Wales, Coghlan has shown that if the average number\r\nof children is 3.6, then a woman marrying at 20 may expect to have five\r\nchildren, a woman marrying at 28 three children, at 32 two children, and\r\nat 37 one child. Newsholme and Stevenson, again, conclude that the\r\ngeneral law of decline of fertility with advancing age of the mother is\r\nshown in various countries, and that in nearly all countries the mothers\r\naged 15 to 20 have the largest number of children; the chief exception\r\nis in the case of some northern countries like Norway and Finland, where\r\nwomen develop late, and there it is the mothers of 20 to 25 who have the\r\nlargest number of children.[121] The postponement in the age of marriage\r\nduring recent years is, however, so slight that it can only account for\r\na small part of the decline in the birth-rate; Coghlan calculates that\r\nof unborn possible children in New South Wales the loss of only about\r\none-sixth is to be attributed to this cause. In London, however, Heron\r\nconsiders that the recognized connection between a low birth-rate and a\r\nhigh social standing might have been entirely accounted for sixty years\r\nago by postponement of marriage, and that such postponement may still\r\naccount for 50 per cent of it.[122]\r\n\r\nIt is not enough, however, to consider the mechanism by which the\r\nbirth-rate declines; to realize the significance of the decline we must\r\nconsider the causes which set the mechanism in action.\r\n\r\nWe begin to obtain a truer insight into the meaning of the curve of a\r\ncountry's birth-rate when we realize that it is in relation with the\r\nindustrial and commercial activity of the country.[123] It is sometimes\r\nstated that a high birth-rate goes with a high degree of national\r\nprosperity. That, however, is scarcely the case; we have to look into\r\nthe matter a little more closely. And, when we do so, we find that, not\r\nonly is the statement of a supposed connection between a high birth-rate\r\nand a high degree of prosperity an imperfect statement; it is altogether\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\nIf, in the first place, we attempt to consider the state of things among\r\nsavages, we find, indeed, great variations, and the birth-rate is not\r\ninfrequently low. But, on the whole, it would appear, the marriage-rate,\r\nthe birth-rate, and, it may be added, the death-rate are all alike high.\r\nKarl Ranke has investigated the question with considerable care among\r\nthe Trumai and Nahuqua Indians of Central Brazil.[124] These tribes are\r\nyet totally uncontaminated by contact with European influences;\r\nconsumption and syphilis are alike unknown. In the two villages he\r\ninvestigated in detail, Ranke found that every man over twenty-five\r\nyears of age was married, and that the only unmarried woman he\r\ndiscovered was feeble-minded. The average size of the families of those\r\nwomen who were over forty years of age was between five and six\r\nchildren, while, on the other hand, the mortality among children was\r\ngreat, and a relatively small proportion of the population reached old\r\nage. We see therefore that, among these fairly typical savages, living\r\nunder simple natural conditions, the fertility of the women is as high\r\nas it is among all but the most prolific of European peoples; while, in\r\nstriking contrast with European peoples, among whom a large percentage\r\nof the population never marry, and of those who do, many have no\r\nchildren, practically every man and woman both marries and produces\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIf we leave savages out of the question and return to Europe, it is\r\nstill instructive to find that among those peoples who live under the\r\nmost primitive conditions much the same state of things may be found as\r\namong savages. This is notably the case as regards Russia. In no other\r\ngreat European country do the bulk of the women marry at so early an\r\nage, and in no other is the average size of the family so large. And,\r\nconcomitantly with a very high marriage-rate and a very high birth-rate,\r\nwe find in Russia, in an equally high degree, the prevalence among the\r\nmasses of infantile and general mortality, disease (epidemical and\r\nother), starvation, misery.[125]\r\n\r\nSo far we scarcely see any marked connection between high fertility and\r\nprosperity. It is more nearly indicated in the high birth-rate of\r\nHungary--only second to that of Russia, and also accompanied by a high\r\nmortality--which is associated with the rapid and notable development of\r\na young nationality. The case of Hungary is, indeed, typical. In so far\r\nas high fertility is associated with prosperity, it is with the\r\nprosperity of a young and unstable community, which has experienced a\r\nsudden increase of wealth and a sudden expansion. The case of Western\r\nAustralia illustrates the same point. Thirty years ago the marriage-rate\r\nand the birth-rate of this colony were on the same level as those of the\r\nother Australian colonies; but a sudden industrial expansion occurred,\r\nboth rates rose, and in 1899 the fertility of Western Australia was\r\nhigher than that of any other English-speaking community.[126]\r\n\r\nIf now we put together the facts observed in savage life and the facts\r\nobserved in civilized life, we shall begin to see the real nature of the\r\nfactors that operate to raise or lower the fertility of a community. It\r\nis far, indeed, from being prosperity which produces a high fertility,\r\nfor the most wretched communities are the most prolific, but, on the\r\nother hand, it is by no means the mere absence of prosperity which\r\nproduces fertility, for we constantly observe that the on-coming of a\r\nwave of prosperity elevates the birth-rate. In both cases alike it is\r\nthe absence of social-economic restraints which conduces to high\r\nfertility. In the simple, primitive community of savages, serfs, or\r\nslaves, there is no restraint on either nutritive or reproductive\r\nenjoyments; there is no adequate motive for restraint; there are no\r\nclaims of future wants to inhibit the gratification of present wants;\r\nthere are no high standards, no ideals. Supposing, again, that such\r\nrestraints have been established by a certain amount of forethought as\r\nregards the future, or a certain calculation as to social advantages to\r\nbe gained by limiting the number of children, a check on natural\r\nfertility is established. But a sudden accession of prosperity--a sudden\r\nexcess of work and wages and food--sweeps away this check by apparently\r\nrendering it unnecessary; the natural reproductive impulse is liberated\r\nby this rising wave, and we here see whatever truth there is in the\r\nstatement that prosperity means a high birth-rate. In reality, however,\r\nprosperity in such a case merely increases fertility because its sudden\r\naffluence reduces a community to the same careless indifference in\r\nregard to the future, the same hasty snatching at the pleasures of the\r\nmoment, as we find among the most hopeless and least prosperous\r\ncommunities. It is a significant fact, as shown by Beveridge, that the\r\nyears when the people of Great Britain marry most are the years when\r\nthey drink most. It is in the absence of social-economic restraints--the\r\nabsence of the perception of such restraints, or the absence of the\r\nability to act in accordance with such perception--that the birth-rate\r\nis high.\r\n\r\nArsene Dumont seems to have been one of the first who observed this\r\nsignificance of the oscillation of the birth-rate, though he expressed\r\nit in a somewhat peculiar way, as the social capillarity theory. It is\r\nthe natural and universal tendency of mankind to ascend, he declared; a\r\nhigh birth-rate and a strong ascensional impulse are mutually\r\ncontradictory. Large families are only possible when there is no\r\nprogress, and no expectation of it can be cherished; small families\r\nbecome possible when the way has been opened to progress. \"One might\r\nsay,\" Dumont puts it, \"that invisible valves, like those which direct\r\nthe circulation of the blood, have been placed by Nature to direct the\r\ncurrent of human aspiration in the upward path it has prescribed.\" As\r\nthe proletariat is enabled to enjoy the prospect of rising it comes\r\nunder the action of this law of social capillarity, and the birth-rate\r\nfalls. It is the effort towards an indefinite perfection, Dumont\r\ndeclares, which justifies Nature and Man, consoles us for our griefs,\r\nand constitutes our sovereign safeguard against the philosophy of\r\ndespair.[127]\r\n\r\nWhen we thus interpret the crude facts of the falling birth-rate,\r\nviewing them widely and calmly in connection with the other social facts\r\nwith which they are intimately related, we are able to see how foolish\r\nhas been the outcry against a falling birth-rate, and how false the\r\nsupposition that it is due to a new selfishness replacing an ancient\r\naltruism.[128] On the contrary, the excessive birth-rate of the early\r\nindustrial period was directly stimulated by selfishness. There were no\r\nlaws against child-labour; children were produced that they might be\r\nsent out, when little more than babies, to the factories and the mines\r\nto increase their parents' income. The fundamental instincts of men and\r\nwomen do not change, but their direction can be changed. In this field\r\nthe change is towards a higher transformation, introducing a finer\r\neconomy into life, diminishing death, disease, and misery, making\r\npossible the finer ends of living, and at the same time indirectly and\r\neven directly improving the quality of the future race.[129] This is now\r\nbecoming recognized by nearly all calm and sagacious inquirers.[130] The\r\nwild outcry of many unbalanced persons to-day, that a falling birth-rate\r\nmeans degeneration and disaster, is so altogether removed from the\r\nsphere of reason that we ought perhaps to regard it as comparable to\r\nthose manias which, in former centuries, have assumed other forms more\r\nattractive to the neurotic temperament of those days; fortunately, it is\r\na mania which, in the nature of things, is powerless to realize itself,\r\nand we need not anticipate that the outcry against small families will\r\nhave the same results as the ancient outcry against witches.[131]\r\n\r\nIt may be proper at this stage to point out that while, in the foregoing\r\nstatement, a high birth-rate and a high marriage-rate have been regarded\r\nas practically the same thing, we need to make a distinction. The true\r\nrelation of the two rates may be realized when it is stated that, the\r\nmore primitive a community is, the more closely the two rates vary\r\ntogether. As a community becomes more civilized and more complex, the\r\ntwo rates tend to diverge; the restraints on child-production are\r\ndeeper and more complex than those on marriage, so that the removal of\r\nthe restraint on marriage by no means removes the restraint on\r\nfertility. They tend to diverge in opposite directions. Farr considered\r\nthe marriage-rate among civilized peoples as a barometer of national\r\nprosperity. In former years, when corn was a great national product, the\r\nmarriage-rate in England rose regularly as the price of wheat fell. Of\r\nrecent years it has become very difficult to estimate exactly what\r\neconomic factors affect the marriage-rate. It is believed by some that\r\nthe marriage-rate rises or falls with the value of exports.[132] Udny\r\nYule, however, in an expertly statistical study of the matter,[133] finds\r\n(in agreement with Hooker) that neither exports nor imports tally with\r\nthe marriage-rate. He concludes that the movement of prices is a\r\npredominant--though by no means the sole--factor in the change of\r\nmarriage-rates, a fall in prices producing a fall in the marriage-rates\r\nand also in the birth-rates, though he also thinks that pressure on the\r\nlabour market has forced both rates lower than the course of prices\r\nwould lead one to expect. In so far as these causes are concerned, Udny\r\nYule states, the fall is quite normal and pessimistic views are\r\nmisplaced. Udny Yule, however, appears to be by no means confident that\r\nhis explanation covers a large part of the causation, and he admits that\r\nhe cannot understand the rationale of the connection between\r\nmarriage-rates and prices. The curves of the marriage-rates in many\r\ncountries indicate a maximum about or shortly before, 1875, when the\r\nbirth-rate also tended to reach a maximum, and another rise towards\r\n1900, thus making the intermediate curve concave. There was, however, a\r\nlarge rise in money wages between 1860 and 1875, and the rise in the\r\nconsuming power of the population has been continuous since 1850. Thus\r\nthe factors favourable to a high marriage-rate must have risen from 1850\r\nto a maximum about 1870-1875, and since then have fallen continuously.\r\nThis statement, which Mr. Udny Yule emphasizes, certainly seems highly\r\nsignificant from our present point of view. It falls into line with the\r\nview here accepted, that the first result of a sudden access of\r\nprosperity is to produce a general orgy, a reckless and improvident\r\nhaste to take advantage of the new prosperity, but that, as the effects\r\nof the orgy wear off, it necessarily gives place to new ideals, and to\r\nhigher standards of life which lead to caution and prudence. Mr. N.A.\r\nHooker seems to have perceived this, and in the discussion which\r\nfollowed the reading of Udny Yule's paper he set forth what (though it\r\nwas not accepted by Udny Yule) may perhaps fairly be regarded as the\r\nsound view of the matter. \"During the great expansion of trade prior to\r\n1870,\" he remarked, \"the means of satisfying the desired standard of\r\ncomfort were increasing much more rapidly than the rise in the standard;\r\nhence a decreasing age of marriage and a marriage-rate above the normal.\r\nAfter about 1873, however, the means of satisfying the standard of\r\ncomfort no longer increased with the same rapidity, and then a new\r\nfactor, he thought, became important, viz. the increased intelligence of\r\nthe people.\"[134] This seems to be precisely the same view of the matter\r\nas I have here sought to set forth; prosperity is not civilization, its\r\nfirst tendency is to produce a reckless abandonment to the satisfaction\r\nof the crudest impulses. But as prosperity develops it begins to\r\nengender more complex ideals and higher standards; the inevitable result\r\nis a greater forethought and restraint.[135]\r\n\r\nIf we consider, not the marriage-rate, but the average age at marriage,\r\nand especially the age of the woman, which varies less than that of the\r\nman, the results, though harmonious, would not be quite the same. The\r\ngeneral tendency as regards the age of girls at marriage is summed up by\r\nPloss and Bartels, in their monumental work on Woman, in the statement:\r\n\"It may be said in general that the age of girls at marriage is lower,\r\nthe lower the stage of civilization is in the community to which they\r\nbelong.\"[136] We thus see one reason why it is that, in an advanced stage\r\nof civilization, a high marriage-rate is not necessarily associated\r\nwith a high birth-rate. A large number of women who marry late may have\r\nfewer children than a smaller number who marry early.\r\n\r\nWe may see the real character of the restraints on fertility very well\r\nillustrated by the varying birth-rate of the upper and lower social\r\nclasses belonging to the same community. If a high birth-rate were a\r\nmark of prosperity or of advanced civilization, we should expect to find\r\nit among the better social class of a community. But the reverse is the\r\ncase; it is everywhere the least prosperous and the least cultured\r\nclasses of a community which show the highest birth-rate. As we go from\r\nthe very poor to the very rich quarters of a great city--whether Paris,\r\nBerlin, or Vienna--the average number of children to the family\r\ndiminishes regularly. The difference is found in the country as well as\r\nin the towns. In Holland, for instance, whether in town or country,\r\nthere are 5.19 children per marriage among the poor, and only 4.50 among\r\nthe rich. In London it is notorious that the same difference appears;\r\nthus Charles Booth, the greatest authority on the social conditions of\r\nLondon, in the concluding volume of his vast survey, sums up the\r\ncondition of things in the statement that \"the lower the class the\r\nearlier the period of marriage and the greater the number of children\r\nborn to each marriage.\" The same phenomenon is everywhere found, and it\r\nis one of great significance.\r\n\r\nThe significance becomes clearer when we realize that an urban\r\npopulation must always be regarded as more \"civilized\" than a rural\r\npopulation, and that, in accordance with that fact, an urban population\r\ntends to be less prolific than a rural population. The town birth-rate\r\nis nearly always lower than the country birth-rate. In Germany this is\r\nvery marked, and the rapidly growing urbanization of Germany is\r\naccompanied by a great fall of the birth-rate in the large cities, but\r\nnot in the rural districts. In England the fall is more widespread, and\r\nthough the birth-rate is much higher in the country than in the towns\r\nthe decline in the rural birth-rate is now proceeding more rapidly than\r\nthat in the urban birth-rate. England, which once contained a largely\r\nrural population, now possesses a mainly urban population. Every year it\r\nbecomes more urban; while the town population grows, the rural\r\npopulation remains stationary; so that, at the present time, for every\r\ninhabitant of the country in England, there are more than three\r\ntown-dwellers. As the country-dweller is more prolific than the\r\ntown-dweller, this means that the rural population is constantly being\r\npoured into the towns. The larger our great cities grow, the more\r\nirresistible becomes the attraction which they exert on the children of\r\nthe country, who are fascinated by them, as the birds are fascinated by\r\nthe lighthouse or the moths by the candle. And the results are not\r\naltogether unlike those which this analogy suggests. At the present\r\ntime, one-third of the population of London is made up of immigrants\r\nfrom the country. Yet, notwithstanding this immense and constant stream\r\nof new and vigorous blood, it never suffices to raise the urban\r\npopulation to the same level of physical and nervous stability which\r\nthe rural population possesses. More alert, more vivacious, more\r\nintelligent, even more urbane in the finer sense, as the urban\r\npopulation becomes,--not perhaps at first, but in the end,--it\r\ninevitably loses its stamina, its reserves of vital energy. Dr. Cantlie\r\nvery properly defines a Londoner as a person whose grandparents all\r\nbelonged to London--and he could not find any. Dr. Harry Campbell has\r\nfound a few who could claim London grandparents; they were poor\r\nspecimens of humanity.[137] Even on the intellectual side there are no\r\ngreat Londoners. It is well known that a number of eminent men have been\r\nborn in London; but, in the course of a somewhat elaborate study of the\r\norigins of British men of genius, I have not been able to find that any\r\nwere genuinely Londoners by descent.[138] An urban life saps that calm and\r\nstolid strength which is necessary for all great effort and stress,\r\nphysical or intellectual. The finest body of men in London, as a class,\r\nare the London police, and Charles Booth states that only 17 per cent of\r\nthe London police are born in London, a smaller proportion than any\r\nother class of the London population except the army and navy. As Mr.\r\nN.C. Macnamara has pointed out, it is found that London men do not\r\npossess the necessary nervous stability and self-possession for police\r\nwork; they are too excitable and nervous, lacking the equanimity,\r\ncourage, and self-reliance of the rural men. Just in the same way, in\r\nSpain, the bull-fighters, a body of men admirable for their graceful\r\nstrength, their modesty, courage, and skill, nearly always come from\r\ncountry districts, although it is in the towns that the enthusiasm for\r\nbull-fighting is centred. Therefore, it would appear that until urban\r\nconditions of life are greatly improved, the more largely urban a\r\npopulation becomes, the more is its standard of vital and physical\r\nefficiency likely to be lowered. This became clearly visible during the\r\nSouth African War; it was found at Manchester (as stated by Dr. T.P.\r\nSmith and confirmed by Dr. Clayton) that among 11,000 young men who\r\nvolunteered for enlistment, scarcely more than 10 per cent could pass\r\nthe surgeon's examination, although the standard of physique demanded\r\nwas extremely low, while Major-General Sir F. Maurice has stated[139]\r\nthat, even when all these rejections have been made, of those who\r\nactually are enlisted, at the end of two years only two effective\r\nsoldiers are found for every five who enlist. It is not difficult to see\r\na bearing of these facts on the birth-rate. The civilized world is\r\nbecoming a world of towns, and, while the diminished birth-rate of towns\r\nis certainly not mainly the result of impaired vitality, these phenomena\r\nare correlative facts of the first importance for every country which\r\nis using up its rural population and becoming a land of cities.\r\n\r\nFrom our present point of view it is thus a very significant fact that\r\nthe equipoise between country-dwellers and town-dwellers has been lost,\r\nthat the towns are gaining at the expense of the country whose surplus\r\npopulation they absorb and destroy. The town population is not only\r\ndisinclined to propagate; it is probably in some measure unfit to\r\npropagate.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we must not too strongly emphasize this aspect of the\r\nmatter; such over-emphasis of a single aspect of highly complex\r\nphenomena constantly distorts our vision of great social processes. We\r\nhave already seen that it is inaccurate to assert any connection between\r\na high birth-rate and a high degree of national prosperity, except in so\r\nfar as at special periods in the history of a country a sudden wave of\r\nprosperity may temporarily remove the restraints on natural fertility.\r\nProsperity is only one of the causes that tend to remove the restraint\r\non the birth-rate; and it is a cause that is never permanently\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTo get to the bottom of the matter, we thus find it is necessary to look\r\ninto it more closely than is usually attempted. When we ask ourselves\r\nwhy prosperity fails permanently to remove the restraints on fertility\r\nthe answer is, that it speedily creates new restraints. Prosperity and\r\ncivilization are far from being synonymous terms. The savage who is\r\nable to glut himself with the whale that has just been stranded on his\r\ncoast, is more prosperous than he was the day before, but he is not more\r\ncivilized, perhaps a trifle less so. The working community that is\r\nsuddenly glutted by an afflux of work and wages is in exactly the same\r\nposition as the savage who is suddenly enabled to fill himself with a\r\nrich mass of decaying blubber. It is prosperity; it is not\r\ncivilization.[140] But, while prosperity leads at first to the reckless\r\nand unrestrained gratification of the simplest animal instincts of\r\nnutrition and reproduction, it tends, when it is prolonged, to evolve\r\nmore complex instincts. Aspirations become less crude, the needs and\r\nappetites engendered by prosperity take on a more social character, and\r\nare sharpened by social rivalries. In place of the earlier easy and\r\nreckless gratification of animal impulses, a peaceful and organized\r\nstruggle is established for securing in ever fuller degree the\r\ngratification of increasingly insistent and increasingly complex\r\ndesires. Such a struggle involves a deliberate calculation and\r\nforethought, which, sooner or later, cannot fail to be applied to the\r\nquestion of offspring. Thus it is that affluence, in the long run,\r\nitself imposes a check on reproduction. Prosperity, under the stress of\r\nthe urban conditions with which it tends to be associated, has been\r\ntransformed into that calculated forethought, that deliberate\r\nself-restraint for the attainment of ever more manifold ends, which in\r\nits outcome we term \"civilization.\"\r\n\r\nIt is frequently assumed, as we have seen, that the process by which\r\ncivilization is thus evolved is a selfish and immoral process. To\r\nprocreate large families, it is said, is unselfish and moral, as well as\r\na patriotic, even a religious duty. This assumption, we now find, is a\r\nlittle too hasty and is even the reverse of the truth; it is necessary\r\nto take into consideration the totality of the social phenomena\r\naccompanying a high birth-rate, more especially under the conditions of\r\ntown life. A community in which children are born rapidly is necessarily\r\nin an unstable position; it is growing so quickly that there is\r\ninsufficient time for the conditions of life to be equalized. The state\r\nof ill-adjustment is chronic; the pressure is lifted from off the\r\nnatural impulse of procreation, but is increased on all the conditions\r\nunder which the impulse is exerted. There is increased overcrowding,\r\nincreased filth, increased disease, increased death. It can never\r\nhappen, in modern times, that the readjustment of the conditions of life\r\ncan be made to keep pace with a high birth-rate. It is sufficient if we\r\nconsider the case of English towns, of London in particular, during the\r\nperiod when British prosperity was most rapidly increasing, and the\r\nbirth-rate nearing its maximum, in the middle of the great Victorian\r\nepoch, of which Englishmen are, for many reasons, so proud. It was\r\ncertainly not an age lacking in either energy or philanthropy; yet, when\r\nwe read the memorable report which Chadwick wrote in 1842, on the\r\n_Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain_, or\r\nthe minute study of Bethnal Green which Gavin published in 1848 as a\r\ntype of the conditions prevailing in English towns, we realize that the\r\nmagnificence of this epoch was built up over circles of Hell to which\r\nthe imagination of Dante never attained.\r\n\r\nAs reproductive activity dies down, social conditions become more\r\nstable, a comparatively balanced state of adjustment tends to be\r\nestablished, insanitary surroundings can be bettered, disease\r\ndiminished, and the death-rate lowered. How much may thus be\r\naccomplished we realize when we compare the admirably precise and\r\nbalanced pages in which Charles Booth, in the concluding volumes of his\r\ngreat work, has summarized his survey of London, with the picture\r\npresented by Chadwick and Gavin half a century earlier. Ugly and painful\r\nas are many of the features of this modern London, the vision which is,\r\non the whole, evoked is that of a community which has attained\r\nself-consciousness, which is growing into some faint degree of harmony\r\nwith its environment, and is seeking to gain the full amount of the\r\nsatisfaction which an organized urban life can yield. Booth, who\r\nappears to have realized the significance of a decreased fertility in\r\nthe attainment of this progress, hopes for a still greater fall in the\r\nbirth-rate; and those who seek to restore the birth-rate of half a\r\ncentury ago are engaged on a task which would be criminal if it were not\r\nbased on ignorance, and which is, in any case, fatuous.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of zoological evolution reveals a constantly\r\ndiminishing reproductive activity and a constantly increasing\r\nexpenditure of care on the offspring thus diminished in number.[141] Fish\r\nspawn their ova by the million, and it is a happy chance if they become\r\nfertilized, a highly unlikely chance that more than a very small\r\nproportion will ever attain maturity. Among the mammals, however, the\r\nfemale may produce but half a dozen or fewer offspring at a time, but\r\nshe lavishes so much care upon them that they have a very fair chance\r\nof all reaching maturity. In man, in so far as he refrains from\r\nreturning to the beast and is true to the impulse which in him becomes a\r\nconscious process of civilization, the same movement is carried forward.\r\nHe even seeks to decrease still further the number of his offspring by\r\nvoluntary effort, and at the same time to increase their quality and\r\nmagnify their importance.[142]\r\n\r\nWhen in human families, especially under civilized conditions, we see\r\nlarge families we are in the presence of a reversion to the tendencies\r\nthat prevail among lower organisms. Such large families may probably be\r\nregarded, as Naecke suggests, as constituting a symptom of degeneration.\r\nIt is noteworthy that they usually occur in the pathological and\r\nabnormal classes, among the insane, the feeble-minded, the criminal, the\r\nconsumptive, the alcoholic, etc.[143]\r\n\r\nThis tendency of the birth-rate to fall with the growth of social\r\nstability is thus a tendency which is of the very essence of\r\ncivilization. It represents an impulse which, however deliberate it may\r\nbe in the individual, may, in the community, be looked upon as an\r\ninstinctive effort to gain more complete control of the conditions of\r\nlife, and to grapple more efficiently with the problems of misery and\r\ndisease and death. It is not only, as is sometimes supposed, during the\r\npast century that the phenomena may be studied. We have a remarkable\r\nexample some centuries earlier, an example which very clearly\r\nillustrates the real nature of the phenomena. The city of Geneva,\r\nperhaps first of European cities, began to register its births, deaths,\r\nand marriages from the middle of the sixteenth century. This alone\r\nindicates a high degree of civilization; and at that time, and for some\r\nsucceeding centuries, Geneva was undoubtedly a very highly civilized\r\ncity. Its inhabitants really were the \"elect,\" morally and\r\nintellectually, of French Protestantism. In many respects it was a model\r\ncity, as Gray noted when he reached it in the course of his travels in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. These registers of Geneva show, in\r\na most illuminating manner, how extreme fertility at the outset,\r\ngradually gave place, as civilization progressed, to a very low\r\nfertility, with fewer and later marriages, a very low death-rate, and a\r\nstate of general well-being in which the births barely replaced the\r\ndeaths.\r\n\r\nAfter Protestant Geneva had lost her pioneering place in civilization,\r\nit was in France, the land which above all others may in modern times\r\nclaim to represent the social aspects of civilization, that the same\r\ntendency most conspicuously appeared. But all Europe, as well as all the\r\nEnglish-speaking lands outside Europe, is now following the lead of\r\nFrance. In a paper read before the Paris Society of Anthropology a few\r\nyears ago, Emile Macquart showed clearly, by a series of ingenious\r\ndiagrams, that whereas, fifty years ago, the condition of the birth-rate\r\nin France diverged widely from that prevailing in the other chief\r\ncountries of Europe, the other countries are now rapidly following in\r\nthe same road along which France has for a century been proceeding\r\nslowly, and are constantly coming closer to her, England closest of all.\r\nIn the past, proposals have from time to time been made in France to\r\ninterfere with the progress of this downward movement of the\r\nbirth-rate--proposals that were sufficiently foolish, for neither in\r\nFrance nor elsewhere will the individual allow the statistician to\r\ninterfere officiously in a matter which he regards as purely intimate\r\nand private. But the real character of this tendency of the birth-rate,\r\nas an essential phenomenon of civilization, with which neither moralist\r\nnor politician can successfully hope to interfere, is beginning to be\r\nrealized in France. Azoulay, in summing up the discussion after\r\nMacquart's paper[144] had been read at the Society of Anthropology,\r\npointed out that \"nations must inevitably follow the same course as\r\nsocial classes, and the more the mass of these social classes becomes\r\ncivilized, the more the nation's birth-rate falls; therefore there is\r\nnothing to be done legally and administratively.\" And another member\r\nadded: \"Except to applaud.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probably too much to hope that so sagacious a view will at once be\r\nuniversally adopted. The United States and the great English colonies,\r\nfor instance, find it difficult to realize that they are not really new\r\ncountries, but branches of old countries, and already nearing maturity\r\nwhen they began their separate lives. They are not at the beginning of\r\ntwo thousand years of slow development, such as we have passed through,\r\nbut at the end of it, with us, and sometimes even a little ahead of us.\r\nIt is therefore natural and inevitable that, in a matter in which we are\r\nmoving rapidly, Massachusetts and Ontario and New South Wales and New\r\nZealand should have moved still more rapidly, so rapidly indeed, that\r\nthey have themselves failed to perceive that their real natural increase\r\nand the manner in which it is attained place them in this matter at the\r\nvan of civilization. These things are, however, only learnt slowly. We\r\nmay be sure that the fundamental and complex character of the phenomena\r\nwill never be obvious to our fussy little politicians, so apt to\r\nadvocate panaceas which have effects quite opposite to those they\r\ndesire. But, whatever politicians may wish to do or to leave undone, it\r\nis well to remember that, of the various ideals the world holds, there\r\nare some that lie on the path of our social progress, and others that do\r\nnot there lie. We may properly exercise such wisdom as we possess by\r\nutilizing the ideals which are before us, serenely neglecting many\r\nothers which however precious they may once have seemed, no longer form\r\npart of the stage of civilization we are now moving towards.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nWhat are the ideals of the stage of civilization we of the Western world\r\nare now moving towards? We have here pushed as far as need be the\r\nanalysis of that declining birth-rate which has caused so much anxiety\r\nto those amongst us who can only see narrowly and see superficially. We\r\nhave found that, properly understood, there is nothing in it to evoke\r\nour pessimism. On the contrary, we have seen that, in the opinion of the\r\nmost distinguished authorities, the energy with which we move in our\r\npresent direction, through the exercise of an ever finer economy in\r\nlife, may be regarded as a \"measure of civilization\" in the important\r\nsphere of vital statistics. As we now leave the question, some may ask\r\nthemselves whether this concomitant decline in birth-rates and\r\ndeath-rates may not possibly have a still wider and more fundamental\r\nmeaning as a measure of civilization.\r\n\r\nWe have long been accustomed to regard the East as a spiritual world in\r\nwhich the finer ends of living were counted supreme, and the merely\r\nmaterialistic aspects of life, dissociated from the aims of religion and\r\nof art, were trodden under foot. Our own Western world we have humbly\r\nregarded as mainly absorbed in a feverish race for the attainment, by\r\nindustry and war, of the satisfaction of the impulses of reproduction\r\nand nutrition, and the crudely material aggrandizement of which those\r\nimpulses are the symbol. A certain outward idleness, a semi-idleness, as\r\nNietzsche said, is the necessary condition for a real religious life,\r\nfor a real aesthetic life, for any life on the spiritual plane. The\r\nnoisy, laborious, pushing, \"progressive\" life we traditionally associate\r\nwith the West is essentially alien to the higher ends of living, as has\r\nbeen intuitively recognized and acted on by all those among us who have\r\nsought to pursue the higher ends of living. It was so that the\r\nnineteenth-century philosophers of Europe, of whom Schopenhauer was in\r\nthis matter the extreme type, viewed the matter. But when we seek to\r\nmeasure the tendency of the chief countries of the West, led by France,\r\nEngland, and Germany, and the countries of the East led by Japan, in the\r\nlight of this strictly measurable test of vital statistics, may we not,\r\nperhaps, trace the approach of a revolutionary transposition? Japan,\r\nentering on the road we have nearly passed through, in which the\r\nperpetual clash of a high birth-rate and a high death-rate involves\r\nsocial disorder and misery, has flung to the winds the loftier ideals it\r\nonce pursued so successfully and has lost its fine aesthetic perceptions,\r\nits insight into the most delicate secrets of the soul.[145] And while\r\nJapan, certainly to-day voicing the aspirations of the East, is\r\nconcerned to become a great military and industrial power, we in the\r\nWest are growing weary of war, and are coming to look upon commerce as a\r\nnecessary routine no longer adequate to satisfy the best energies of\r\nhuman beings. We are here moving towards the fine quiescence involved by\r\na delicate equipoise of life and of death; and this economy sets free an\r\nenergy we are seeking to expend in a juster social organization, and in\r\nthe realization of ideals which until now have seemed but the\r\nimagination of idle dreamers. Asia, as an anonymous writer has recently\r\nput it, is growing crude, vulgar, and materialistic; Europe, on the\r\nother hand, is growing to loathe its own past grossness. \"London may yet\r\nbe the spiritual capital of the world, while Asia--rich in all that gold\r\ncan buy and guns can give, lord of lands and bodies, builder of railways\r\nand promulgator of police regulations, glorious in all material\r\nglories--postures, complacent and obtuse, before a Europe content in the\r\npossession of all that matters,\"[146] Certainly, we are not there yet, but\r\nthe old Earth has seen many stranger and more revolutionary changes than\r\nthis. England, as this writer reminds us, was once a tropical forest.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] It must be understood that, from the present point of view, the term\r\n\"Anglo-Saxon\" covers the peoples of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, as\r\nwell as of England.\r\n\r\n[91] The decline of the French birth-rate has been investigated in a\r\nLyons thesis by Salvat, _La Depopulation de la France_, 1903.\r\n\r\n[92] The latest figures are given in the Annual Reports of the\r\nRegistrar-General for England and Wales.\r\n\r\n[93] Newsholme and Stevenson, \"Decline of Human Fertility as shown by\r\ncorrected Birth-rates,\" _Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_,\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n[94] Werner Sombart, _International Magazine_, December, 1907.\r\n\r\n[95] A.W. Flux, \"Urban Vital Statistics in England and Germany,\" _Journ.\r\nStatist. Soc._, March, 1910.\r\n\r\n[96] German infantile mortality, Boehmert states (\"Die\r\nSaeuglingssterblichkeit in Deutschland und ihre Ursachen,\" _Die Neue\r\nGeneration_, March, 1908), is greater than in any European country,\r\nexcept Russia and Hungary, about 50 per cent greater than in England,\r\nFrance, Belgium, or Holland. The infantile mortality has increased in\r\nGermany, as usually happens, with the increased employment of women,\r\nand, largely from this cause, has nearly doubled in Berlin in the course\r\nof four years, states Lily Braun (_Mutterschutz_, 1906, Heft I, p. 21);\r\nbut even on this basis it is only 22 per cent in the English textile\r\nindustries, as against 38 per cent in the German textile industries.\r\n\r\n[97] In England the marriage-rate fell rather sharply in 1875, and showed\r\na slight tendency to rise about 1900 (G. Udny Yule, \"On the Changes in\r\nthe Marriage-and Birth-rates in England and Wales,\" _Journal of the\r\nStatistical Society_, March, 1906). On the whole there has been a real\r\nthough slight decline. The decline has been widespread, and is most\r\nmarked in Australia, especially South Australia. There has, however,\r\nbeen a rise in the marriage-rate in Ireland, France, Austria,\r\nSwitzerland, Germany, and especially Belgium. The movement for decreased\r\nchild-production would naturally in the first place involve decreased\r\nmarriage, but it is easy to understand that when it is realized the\r\nmarriage is not necessarily followed by conception this motive for\r\navoiding marriage loses its force, and the marriage-rate rises.\r\n\r\n[98] _Medicine_, February, 1904.\r\n\r\n[99] Davidson, \"The Growth of the French-Canadian Race,\" _Annals of the\r\nAmerican Academy_, September, 1896.\r\n\r\n[100] T.A. Coghlan, _The Decline of the Birth-rate of New South Wales_,\r\n1903. The New South Wales statistics are specially valuable as the\r\nrecords contain many particulars (such as age of parents, period since\r\nmarriage, and number of children) not given in English or most other\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n[101] C. Hamburger, \"Kinderzahl und Kindersterblichkeit,\" _Die Neue\r\nGeneration_, August, 1909.\r\n\r\n[102] Looked at in another way, it may be said that if a natural increase,\r\nas ascertained by subtracting the death-rate from the birth-rate, of 10\r\nto 15 per cent be regarded as normal, then, taking so far as possible\r\nthe figures for 1909, the natural increase of England and Scotland, of\r\nGermany, of Italy, of Austria and Hungary, of Belgium, is normal; the\r\nnatural increase of New South Wales, of Victoria, of South Australia, of\r\nNew Zealand, is abnormally high (though in new countries such increase\r\nmay not be undesirable) while the natural increase of France, of Spain,\r\nand of Ireland is abnormally low. Such a method of estimation, of\r\ncourse, entirely leaves out of account the question of the social\r\ndesirability of the process by which the normal increase is secured.\r\n\r\n[103] Johannsen, _Janus_, 1905.\r\n\r\n[104] Rubin, \"A Measure of Civilization,\" _Journal of the Royal\r\nStatistical Society_, March, 1897. \"The lowest stage of civilization,\"\r\nhe points out, \"is to go forward blindly, which in this connection means\r\nto bring into the world a great number of children which must, in great\r\nproportion, sink into the grave. The next stage of civilization is to\r\nsee the danger and to keep clear of it. The highest stage of\r\ncivilization is to see the danger and overcome it.\" Europe in the past\r\nand various countries in the present illustrate the first stage; France\r\nillustrates the second stage; the third stage is that towards which we\r\nare striving to move to-day.\r\n\r\n[105] Baines, \"The Recent Growth of Population in Western Europe,\"\r\n_Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_, December, 1909.\r\n\r\n[106] Various facts and references are given by Havelock Ellis, _The\r\nNationalization of Health_, chap. XIV.\r\n\r\n[107] These are the figures given by the chief Japanese authority,\r\nProfessor Takano, _Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_, July,\r\n1910, p. 738.\r\n\r\n[108] E.A. Ross, \"The Race Fibre of the Chinese,\" _Popular Science\r\nMonthly_, October, 1911. According to another competent and fairly\r\nconcordant estimate, the infantile death-rate of China is 90 per cent.\r\nOf the female infants, probably about 1 in 10 is intentionally\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[109] J.J. Matignon, \"La Mere et l'Enfant en Chine,\" _Archives\r\nd'Anthropologie Criminelle_, October to November, 1909.\r\n\r\n[110] Arsene Dumont, for instance, points out (_Depopulation et\r\nCivilization_, p. 116) that the very early marriages and the reckless\r\nfertility of the Chinese cannot fail to cease as soon as the people\r\nadopt European ways.\r\n\r\n[111] The confident estimates of the future population of the world which\r\nare from time to time put forward on the basis of the present birth-rate\r\nare quite worthless. A brilliantly insubstantial fabric of this kind, by\r\nB.L. Putnam Weale (_The Conflict of Colour_, 1911), has been justly\r\ncriticized by Professor Weatherley (_Popular Science Monthly_, November,\r\n1911).\r\n\r\n[112] It is sometimes convenient to use the term \"Neo-Malthusianism\" to\r\nindicate the voluntary limitation of the family, but it must always be\r\nremembered that Malthus would not have approved of Neo-Malthusianism,\r\nand that Neo-Malthusian practices have nothing to do with the theory of\r\nMalthus. They would not be affected could that theory be conclusively\r\nproved or conclusively disproved.\r\n\r\n[113] We even find the demand that bachelors and spinsters shall be taxed.\r\nThis proposal has been actually accepted (1911) by the Landtag of the\r\nlittle Principality of Reuss, which proposes to tax bachelors and\r\nspinsters over thirty years of age. Putting aside the arguable questions\r\nas to whether a State is entitled to place such pressure on its\r\ncitizens, it must be pointed out that it is not marriage but the child\r\nwhich concerns the State. It is possible to have children without\r\nmarriage, and marriage does not ensure the procreation of children.\r\nTherefore it would be more to the point to tax the childless. In that\r\ncase, it would be necessary to remit the tax in the case of unmarried\r\npeople with children, and to levy it in the case of married people\r\nwithout children. But it has further to be remembered that not all\r\npersons are fitted to have sound children, and as unsound children are a\r\nburden and not a benefit to the State, the State ought to reward rather\r\nthan to fine those conscientious persons who refrain from procreation\r\nwhen they are too poor, or with too defective a heredity, to be likely\r\nto produce, or to bring up, sound children. Moreover, some persons are\r\nsterile, and thorough medical investigation would be required before\r\nthey could fairly be taxed. As soon as we begin to analyse such a\r\nproposal we cannot fail to see that, even granting that the aim of such\r\nlegislation is legitimate and desirable, the method of attaining it is\r\nthoroughly mischievous and unjustifiable.\r\n\r\n[114] J.G. Engelmann, \"Decreasing Fecundity,\" _Philadelphia Medical\r\nJournal_, January 18, 1902.\r\n\r\n[115] It has, further, been frequently denied that Neo-Malthusian\r\npractices can affect Roman Catholic countries, since the Church is\r\nprecluded from approving of them. That is true. But it is also true\r\nthat, as Lagneau long since pointed out, the Protestants of Europe have\r\nincreased at more than double the annual rate of the Catholics, though\r\nthis relationship has now ceased to be exact. Dumont states\r\n(_Depopulation et Civilisation_, chap. XVIII) that there is not the\r\nslightest reason to suppose that (apart from the question of poverty)\r\nthe faithful have more children than the irreligious; moreover, in\r\ndealing with its more educated members, it is not the policy of the\r\nChurch to make indiscreet inquiries (see Havelock Ellis, _Studies in the\r\nPsychology of Sex_, Vol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" p. 590). A\r\nCatholic bishop is reported to have warned his clergy against referring\r\nin their Lent sermons to the voluntary restriction of conception,\r\nremarking that an excess of rigour in this matter would cause the Church\r\nto lose half her flock. The fall in the birth-rate is as marked in\r\nCatholic as in Protestant countries; the Catholic communities in which\r\nthis is not the case are few, and placed in exceptional circumstances.\r\nIt must be remembered, moreover, that the Church enjoins celibacy on its\r\nclergy, and that celibacy is practically a Malthusian method. It is not\r\neasy while preaching practical Malthusianism to the clergy to spend much\r\nfervour in preaching against practical Neo-Malthusianism to the laity.\r\n\r\n[116] McLean, \"The Declining Birth-rate in Australia,\" _International\r\nMedical Journal of Australasia_, 1904.\r\n\r\n[117] Thus in France the low birth-rate is associated with a high\r\ninfantile death-rate, which has not yet been appreciably influenced by\r\nthe movement of puericulture in France. In England also, at the end of\r\nthe last century, the declining birth-rate was accompanied by a rising\r\ninfantile death-rate, which is now, however, declining under the\r\ninfluence of greater care of child-life.\r\n\r\n[118] Sidney Webb, _Times_, October 11 and 16, 1906; also _Popular Science\r\nMonthly_, 1906, p. 526.\r\n\r\n[119] It is important to remember the distinction between \"fecundity\" and\r\n\"fertility.\" A woman who has one child has proved that she is fecund,\r\nbut has not proved that she is fertile. A woman with six children has\r\nproved that she is not only fecund but fertile.\r\n\r\n[120] They have been worked out by C.J. Lewis and J. Norman Lewis,\r\n_Natality and Fecundity_, 1905.\r\n\r\n[121] Newsholme and Stevenson, _op. cit._; Rubin and Westergaard,\r\n_Statistik der Ehen_, 1890, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[122] D. Heron, \"On the Relation of Fertility in Man to Social Status,\"\r\n_Drapers' Company Research Memoirs_, No. 1, 1906.\r\n\r\n[123] The recognition of this relationship must not be regarded as an\r\nattempt unduly to narrow down the causation of changes in the\r\nbirth-rate. The great complexity of the causes influencing the\r\nbirth-rate is now fairly well recognized, and has, for instance, been\r\npointed out by Goldscheid, _Hoeherentwicklung und Menschenoekonomie_, Vol.\r\nI, 1911.\r\n\r\n[124] In a paper read at the Brunswick Meeting of the German\r\nAnthropological Society (_Correspondenzblatt_ of the Society, November,\r\n1898); a great many facts concerning the fecundity of women among\r\nsavages in various parts of the world are brought together by Ploss and\r\nBartels, _Das Weib_, Vol I, chap. XXIV.\r\n\r\n[125] The proportion of doctors to the population is very small, and the\r\npeople still have great confidence in their quacks and witch-doctors.\r\nThe elementary rules of sanitation are generally neglected, water\r\nsupplies are polluted, filth is piled up in the streets and the\r\ncourtyards, as it was in England and Western Europe generally until a\r\ncentury ago, and the framing of regulations or the incursions of the\r\npolice have little effect on the habits of the people. Neglect of the\r\nordinary precautions of cleanliness is responsible for the wide\r\nextension of syphilis by the use of drinking vessels, towels, etc., in\r\ncommon. Not only is typhoid prevalent in nearly every province of\r\nRussia, but typhus, which is peculiarly the disease of filth,\r\novercrowding, and starvation, and has long been practically extinct in\r\nEngland, still flourishes and causes an immense mortality. The workers\r\noften have no homes and sleep in the factories amidst the machinery, men\r\nand women together; their food is insufficient, and the hours of labour\r\nmay vary from twelve to fourteen. When famine occurs these conditions\r\nare exaggerated, and various epidemics ravage the population.\r\n\r\n[126] It must, however, be remembered that in small and unstable\r\ncommunities a considerable margin for error must be allowed, as the\r\ncrude birth-rate is unduly raised by an afflux of immigrants at the\r\nreproductive age.\r\n\r\n[127] Arsene Dumont, _Depopulation et Civilisation_, 1890, chap. VI. The\r\nnature of the restraint on fertility has been well set forth by Dr.\r\nBushee (\"The Declining Birth-rate and its Causes,\" _Popular Science\r\nMonthly_, August, 1903), mainly in the terms of Dumont's \"social\r\ncapillarity\" theory.\r\n\r\n[128] Even Dr. Newsholme, usually so cautious and reliable an investigator\r\nin this field, has been betrayed into a reference in this connection\r\n(_The Declining Birth-rate_, 1911, p. 41) to the \"increasing rarity of\r\naltruism,\" though in almost the next paragraph he points out that the\r\nlarge families of the past were connected with the fact that the child\r\nwas a profitable asset, and could be sent to work when little more than\r\nan infant. The \"altruism\" which results in crushing the minds and bodies\r\nof others in order to increase one's own earnings is not an \"altruism\"\r\nwhich we need desire to perpetuate. The beneficial effect of legislation\r\nagainst child-labour in reducing an unduly high birth-rate has often\r\nbeen pointed out.\r\n\r\n[129] It may suffice to take a single point. Large families involve the\r\nbirth of children at very short intervals. It has been clearly shown by\r\nDr. R.J. Ewart (\"The Influence of Parental Age on Offspring,\" _Eugenics\r\nReview_, October, 1911) that children born at an interval of less than\r\ntwo years after the birth of the previous child, remain, even when they\r\nhave reached their sixth year, three inches shorter and three pounds\r\nlighter than first-born children.\r\n\r\n[130] For instance, Goldscheid, in _Hoeherentwicklung und\r\nMenschenoekonomie_; it is also, on the whole, the conclusion of\r\nNewsholme, though expressed in an exceedingly temperate manner, in his\r\n_Declining Birth-rate_.\r\n\r\n[131] If, however, our birth-rate fanatics should hear of the results\r\nobtained at the experimental farm at Roseville, California, by Professor\r\nSilas Wentworth, who has found that by placing ewes in a field under the\r\npower wires of an electric wire company, the average production of lambs\r\nis more than doubled, we may anticipate trouble in many hitherto small\r\nfamilies. Their predecessors insisted, in the cause of religion and\r\nmorals, on burning witches; we must not be surprised if our modern\r\nfanatics, in the same holy cause, clamour for a law compelling all\r\nchildless women to live under electric wires.\r\n\r\n[132] J. Holt Schooling, \"The English Marriage Rate,\" _Fortnightly\r\nReview_, June, 1901.\r\n\r\n[133] G. Udny Yule, \"Changes in the Marriage-and Birth-rate in England,\"\r\n_Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_, March, 1906.\r\n\r\n[134] At an earlier period Hooker had investigated the same subject\r\nwithout coming to any very decisive conclusions (\"Correlation of the\r\nMarriage-rate with Trade,\" _Journ. Statistical Soc._, September, 1901).\r\nMinor fluctuations in marriage and in trade per head, he found, tend to\r\nbe in close correspondence, but on the whole trade has risen and the\r\nmarriage-rate has fallen, probably, Hooker believed, as the result of\r\nthe gradual deferment of marriage.\r\n\r\n[135] The higher standard need not be, among the mass of the population,\r\nof a very exalted character, although it marks a real progress.\r\nNewsholme and Stevenson (_op. cit._) term it a higher \"standard of\r\ncomfort.\" The decline of the birth-rate, they say, \"is associated with a\r\ngeneral raising of the standard of comfort, and is an expression of the\r\ndetermination of the people to secure this greater comfort.\"\r\n\r\n[136] Ploss, _Das Weib_, Vol. I, chap. XX.\r\n\r\n[137] It must not, however, be assumed that the rural immigrants are in\r\nthe mass better suited to urban life than the urban natives. It is\r\nprobable that, notwithstanding their energy and robustness, the\r\nimmigrants are less suited to urban conditions than the natives.\r\nConsequently a process of selection takes place among the immigrants,\r\nand the survivors become, as it were, immunized to the poisons of urban\r\nlife. But this immunization is by no means necessarily associated with\r\nany high degree of nervous vigour or general physical development.\r\n\r\n[138] Havelock Ellis, _A Study of British Genius_, pp. 22, 43.\r\n\r\n[139] \"National Health: a Soldier's Study,\" _Contemporary Review_,\r\nJanuary, 1903. The Reports of the Inspector-General of Recruiting are\r\nsaid to show that the recruits are every year smaller, lighter, and\r\nnarrower-chested.\r\n\r\n[140] This has been well illustrated during the past forty years in the\r\nflourishing county of Glamorgan in Wales, as is shown by Dr. R.S.\r\nStewart (\"The Relationship of Wages, Lunacy, and Crime in South Wales,\"\r\n_Journal of Mental Science_, January, 1904). The staple industry here is\r\ncoal, 17 per cent of the population being directly employed in\r\ncoal-mining, and wages are determined by the sliding scale as it is\r\ncalled, according to which the selling price of coal regulates the\r\nwages. This leads to many fluctuations and sudden accesses of\r\nprosperity. It is found that whenever wages rise there is a concomitant\r\nincrease of insanity and at the same time a diminished output of coal\r\ndue to slacking of work when earnings are greater; there is also an\r\nincrease of drunkenness and of crime. Stewart concludes that it is\r\ndoubtful whether increased material prosperity is conducive to\r\nimprovement in physical and mental status. It must, however, be pointed\r\nout that it is a sudden and unstable prosperity, not necessarily a\r\ngradual and stable prosperity, which is hereby shown to be pernicious.\r\n\r\n[141] The relationship is sometimes expressed by saying that the more\r\nhighly differentiated the organism the fewer the offspring. According to\r\nPlate we ought to say that, the greater the capacity for parental care\r\nthe fewer the offspring. This, however, comes to the same thing, since\r\nit is the higher organisms which possess the increased capacity for\r\nparental care. Putting it in the most generalized zoological way,\r\ndiminished offspring is the response to improved environment. Thus in\r\nMan the decline of the birth-rate, as Professor Benjamin Moore remarks\r\n(_British Medical Journal_, August 20, 1910, p. 454), is \"the simple\r\nbiological reply to good economic conditions. It is a well-known\r\nbiological law that even a micro-organism, when placed in unfavourable\r\nconditions as to food and environment, passes into a reproductive phase,\r\nand by sporulation or some special type produces new individuals very\r\nrapidly. The same condition of affairs in the human race was shown even\r\nby the fact that one-half of the births come from the least favourably\r\nsituated one-quarter of the population. Hence, over-rapid birth-rate\r\nindicates unfavourable conditions of life, so that (so long as the\r\npopulation was on the increase) a lower birth-rate was a valuable\r\nindication of a better social condition of affairs, and a matter on\r\nwhich we should congratulate the country rather than proceed to\r\ncondolences.\"\r\n\r\n[142] \"The accumulations of racial experience tend to show,\" remarks Woods\r\nHutchinson (\"Animal Marriage,\" _Contemporary Review_, October, 1904),\r\n\"that by the production of a smaller and smaller number of offspring,\r\nand the expenditure upon those of a greater amount of parental care,\r\nbetter results can be obtained in efficiency and capacity for survival.\"\r\n\r\n[143] Toulouse, _Causes de la Folie_, p. 91; Magri, _Archivio di\r\nPsichiatria_, 1896, fasc. vi-vii; Havelock Ellis, _A Study of British\r\nGenius_, pp. 106 et seq.\r\n\r\n[144] Emile Macquart, \"Mortalite, Natalite, Depopulation,\" _Bulletin de la\r\nSociete d'Anthropologie_, 1902.\r\n\r\n[145] It is interesting to observe how Lafcadio Hearn, during the last\r\nyears of his life, was compelled, however unwillingly, to recognize this\r\nchange.

The\r\ngreat expansive movement in civilized countries is over. Whereas, fifty\r\nyears ago, France seemed to present a striking contrast to other\r\ncountries in her low and gradually falling birth-rate, to-day, though\r\nshe has herself now almost reached a stationary position, France is seen\r\nmerely to have been the leader in a movement which is common to all the\r\nmore highly civilized nations. They are all now moving rapidly in the\r\ndirection in which she moved slowly. It was inevitable that this\r\nmovement, world-wide as it is, should call forth energetic protests, for\r\nthere is no condition of things so bad but it finds some to advocate its\r\nperpetuation. There has, therefore, been much vigorous preaching against\r\n\"race suicide\" by people who were deaf to the small voice of reason,\r\nwho failed to understand that this matter could not be settled by mere\r\nconsideration of the crude birth-rates, and that, even if it could, we\r\nshould have still to realize that, as an economist remarks, it is to the\r\ndecline of the birth-rate only that we probably owe it that the modern\r\ncivilized world has been saved from economic disaster.[147]\r\n\r\nBut whatever the causes of the declining birth-rate it is certain that\r\neven when they are within our control they are of far too intimate a\r\ncharacter for the public moralist to be permitted to touch them, even\r\nthough we consider them to be in a disastrous state. It has to be\r\nrecognized that we are here in the presence, not of a merely local or\r\ntemporary tendency which might be shaken off with an effort, but of a\r\ngreat fundamental law of civilization; and the fact that we encounter it\r\nin our own race merely means that we are reaching a fairly high stage of\r\ncivilization. It is far from the first time, in the history of the\r\nworld, that the same phenomenon has been witnessed. It was seen in\r\nImperial Rome; it was seen, again, in the \"Protestant Rome,\" Geneva.\r\nWherever are gathered together an exceedingly fine race of people, the\r\nflower of the race, individuals of the highest mental and moral\r\ndistinction, there the birth-rate falls steadily. Vice or virtue alike\r\navails nothing in this field; with high civilization fertility\r\ninevitably diminishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was to be expected that a new ideal should\r\nbegin to flash before men's eyes. If the ideal of _quantity_ is lost to\r\nus, why not seek the ideal of _quality_? We know that the old rule:\r\n\"Increase and multiply\" meant a vast amount of infant mortality, of\r\nstarvation, of chronic disease, of widespread misery. In abandoning that\r\nrule, as we have been forced to do, are we not left free to seek that\r\nour children, though few, should be at all events fit, the finest, alike\r\nin physical and psychical constitution, that the world has seen?\r\n\r\nThus has come about the recent expansion of that conception of\r\n_Eugenics_, or the science and art of Good Breeding in the human race,\r\nwhich a group of workers, pioneered by Francis Galton[148]--at first in\r\nEngland and later in America, Germany and elsewhere--have been\r\ndeveloping for some years past. Eugenics is beginning to be felt to\r\npossess a living actuality which it failed to possess before. Instead of\r\nbeing a benevolent scientific fad it begins to present itself as the\r\ngoal to which we are inevitably moving.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Eugenics has sometimes been prejudiced in the public mind\r\nby a comparison with the artificial breeding of domestic animals. In\r\nreality the two things are altogether different. In breeding animals a\r\nhigher race of beings manipulates a lower race with the object of\r\nsecuring definite points that are of no use whatever to the animals\r\nthemselves, but of considerable value to the breeders. In our own race,\r\non the other hand, the problem of breeding is presented in an entirely\r\ndifferent shape. There is as yet no race of super-men who are prepared\r\nto breed man for their own special ends. As things are, even if we had\r\nthe ability and the power, we should surely hesitate before we bred men\r\nand women as we breed dogs or fowls. We may, therefore, quite put aside\r\nall discussion of eugenics as a sort of higher cattle-breeding. It would\r\nbe undesirable, even if it were not impracticable.\r\n\r\nBut there is another aspect of Eugenics. Human eugenics need not be, and\r\nis not likely to be, a cold-blooded selection of partners by some\r\noutside scientific authority. But it may be, and is very likely to be, a\r\nslowly growing conviction--first among the more intelligent members of\r\nthe community and then by imitation and fashion among the less\r\nintelligent members--that our children, the future race, the\r\ntorch-bearers of civilization for succeeding ages, are not the mere\r\nresult of chance or Providence, but that, in a very real sense, it is\r\nwithin our power to mould them, that the salvation or damnation of many\r\nfuture generations lies in our hands since it depends on our wise and\r\nsane choice of a mate. The results of the breeding of those persons who\r\nought never to be parents is well known; the notorious case of the Jukes\r\nfamily is but one among many instances. We could scarcely expect in any\r\ncommunity that individuals like the Jukes would take the initiative in\r\nmovements for the eugenic development of the race, but it makes much\r\ndifference whether such families exist in an environment like our own\r\nwhich is indifferent to the future of the race, or whether they are\r\nsurrounded by influences of a more wholesome character which can\r\nscarcely fail to some extent to affect, and even to control, the\r\nreckless and anti-social elements in the community.\r\n\r\nIn considering this question, therefore, we are justified in putting\r\naside not only any kind of human breeding resembling the artificial\r\nbreeding of animals, but also, at all events for the present, every\r\ncompulsory prohibition on marriage or procreation. We must be content to\r\nconcern ourselves with ideals, and with the endeavour to exert our\r\npersonal influence in the realization of these ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSuch ideals cannot, however, be left in the air; if they depend on\r\nindividual caprice nothing but fruitless confusion can come of them.\r\nThey must be firmly grounded on a scientific basis of ascertained fact.\r\nThis was always emphasized by Galton. He not only initiated schemes for\r\nobtaining, but actually to some extent obtained, a large amount of\r\nscientific knowledge concerning the special characteristics and\r\naptitudes of families, and his efforts in this direction have since been\r\nlargely extended and elaborated.[149] The feverish activities of modern\r\nlife, and the constant vicissitudes and accidents that overtake families\r\nto-day, have led to an extraordinary indifference to family history and\r\ntradition. Our forefathers, from generation to generation, carefully\r\nentered births, baptisms, marriages, and deaths in the fly-leaf of the\r\nFamily Bible. It is largely owing to these precious entries that many\r\nare able to carry their family history several centuries further back\r\nthan they otherwise could. But nowadays the Family Bible has for the\r\nmost part ceased to exist, and nothing else has taken its place. If a\r\nman wishes to know what sort of stocks he has come from, unless he is\r\nhimself an antiquarian, or in a position to employ an antiquarian to\r\nassist him, he can learn little, and in the most favourable position he\r\nis helpless without clues; though with such clues he might often learn\r\nmuch that would be of the greatest interest to him. The entries in the\r\nFamily Bible, however, whatever their value as clues and even as actual\r\ndata, do not furnish adequate information to serve as a guide to the\r\ndifferent qualities of stocks; we need far more detailed and varied\r\ninformation in order to realize the respective values of families from\r\nthe point of view of eugenics. Here, again, Galton had already realized\r\nthe need for supplying a great defect in our knowledge, and his\r\nLife-history Albums showed how the necessary information may be\r\nconveniently registered.\r\n\r\nThe accumulated histories of individual families, it is evident, will in\r\ntime furnish a foundation on which to base scientific generalizations,\r\nand eventually, perhaps, to justify practical action. Moreover, a vast\r\namount of valuable information on which it is possible to build up a\r\nknowledge of the correlated characteristics of families, already lies at\r\npresent unused in the great insurance offices and elsewhere. When it is\r\npossible to obtain a large collection of accurate pedigrees for\r\nscientific purposes, and to throw them into a properly tabulated form,\r\nwe shall certainly be in a position to know more of the qualities of\r\nstocks, of their good and bad characteristics, and of the degree in\r\nwhich they are correlated.[150]\r\n\r\nIn this way we shall, in time, be able to obtain a clear picture of the\r\nprobable results on the offspring of unions between any kind of people.\r\nFrom personal and ancestral data we shall be able to reckon the probable\r\nquality of the offspring of a married couple. Given a man and woman of\r\nknown personal qualities and of known ancestors, what are likely to be\r\nthe personal qualities, physical, mental and moral, of the children?\r\nThat is a question of immense importance both for the beings themselves\r\nwhom we bring into the world, for the community generally, and for the\r\nfuture race.\r\n\r\nEventually, it seems evident, a general system, whether private or\r\npublic, whereby all personal facts, biological and mental, normal and\r\nmorbid, are duly and systematically registered, must become inevitable\r\nif we are to have a real guide as to those persons who are most fit, or\r\nmost unfit, to carry on the race.[151] Unless they are full and frank such\r\nrecords are useless. But it is obvious that for a long time to come such\r\na system of registration must be private. According to the belief which\r\nis still deeply rooted in most of us, we regard as most private those\r\nfacts of our lives which are most intimately connected with the life of\r\nthe race, and most fateful for the future of humanity. The feeling is no\r\ndoubt inevitable; it has a certain rightness and justification. As,\r\nhowever, our knowledge increases we shall learn that we are, on the one\r\nhand, a little more responsible for future generations than we are\r\naccustomed to think, and, on the other hand, a little less responsible\r\nfor our own good or bad qualities. Our fiat makes the future man, but,\r\nin the same way, we are ourselves made by a choice and a will not our\r\nown. A man may indeed, within limits, mould himself, but the materials\r\nhe can alone use were handed on to him by his parents, and whether he\r\nbecomes a man of genius, a criminal, a drunkard, an epileptic, or an\r\nordinarily healthy, well-conducted, and intelligent citizen, must depend\r\nat least as much on his parents as on his own effort or lack of effort,\r\nsince even the aptitude for effective effort is largely inborn. As we\r\nlearn to look on the facts from the only sound standpoint of heredity,\r\nour anger or contempt for a failing and erring individual has to give\r\nway to the kindly but firm control of a weakling. If the children's\r\nteeth have been set on edge it is because the parents have eaten sour\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we certainly cannot bring legal or even moral force to\r\ncompel everyone to maintain such detailed registers of himself, his\r\nancestral stocks, and his offspring--to say nothing of inducing him to\r\nmake them public--there is something that we can do. We can make it to\r\nhis interest to keep such a record.[152] If it became an advantage in\r\nlife to a man to possess good ancestors, and to be himself a good\r\nspecimen of humanity in mind, character, and physique, we may be sure\r\nthat those who are above the average in these matters will be glad to\r\nmake use of that superiority. Insurance offices already make an\r\ninquisition into these matters, to which no one objects, because a man\r\nonly submits to it for his own advantage; while for military and some\r\nother services similar inquiries are compulsory. Eugenic certificates,\r\naccording to Galton's proposal, would be issued by a suitably\r\nconstituted authority to those candidates who chose to apply for them\r\nand were able to pass the necessary tests. Such certificates would imply\r\nan inquiry and examination into the ancestry of the candidate as well as\r\ninto his own constitution, health, intelligence and character; and the\r\npossession of such a certificate would involve a superiority to the\r\naverage in all these respects. No one would be compelled to offer\r\nhimself for such examination, just as no one is compelled to seek a\r\nuniversity degree. But its possession would often be an advantage. There\r\nis nothing to prevent the establishment of a board of examiners of this\r\nkind to-morrow, and we may be sure that, once established, many\r\ncandidates would hasten to present themselves.[153] There are obviously\r\nmany positions in life wherein a certificate of this kind of superiority\r\nwould be helpful. But its chief distinction would be that its possession\r\nwould be a kind of patent of natural nobility; the man or woman who held\r\nit would be one of Nature's aristocrats, to whom the future of the race\r\nmight be safely left without further question.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBy happy inspiration, or by chance, Galton made public his programme of\r\neugenic research, in a paper read before the Sociological Society, on\r\nFebruary 14, the festival of St. Valentine. Although the ancient\r\nobservances of that day have now died out, St. Valentine was for many\r\ncenturies the patron saint of sexual selection, more especially in\r\nEngland. It can scarcely be said that any credit in this matter belongs\r\nto the venerable saint himself; it was by an accident that he achieved\r\nhis conspicuous position in the world. He was simply a pious Christian\r\nwho was beheaded for his faith in Rome under Claudius. But it so\r\nhappened that his festival fell at that period in early spring when\r\nbirds were believed to pair, and when youths and maidens were accustomed\r\nto select partners for themselves or for others. This custom--which has\r\nbeen studied together with many allied primitive practices by\r\nMannhardt[154]--was not always carried out on February 14, sometimes it\r\ntook place a little later. In England, where it was strictly associated\r\nwith St. Valentine's Day, the custom was referred to by Lydgate, and by\r\nCharles of Orleans in the rondeaus and ballades he wrote during his long\r\nimprisonment in England. The name Valentins or Valentines was also\r\nintroduced into France (where the custom had long existed) to designate\r\nthe young couples thus constituted. This method of sexual selection,\r\nhalf playful, half serious, flourished especially in the region between\r\nEngland, the Moselle, and the Tyrol. The essential part of the custom\r\nlay in the public choice of a fitting mate for marriageable girls.\r\nSometimes the question of fitness resolved itself into one of good\r\nlooks; occasionally the matter was settled by lot. There was no\r\ncompulsion about these unions; they were often little more than a game,\r\nthough at times they involved a degree of immorality which caused the\r\nauthorities to oppose them. But very frequently the sexual selection\r\nthus exerted led to weddings, and these playful Valentine unions were\r\nheld to be a specially favourable prelude to a happy marriage.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to show how the ancient customs associated with\r\nSt. Valentine's Day are taken up again and placed on a higher plane by\r\nthe great movement which is now beginning to shape itself among us. The\r\nold Valentine unions were made by a process of caprice tempered more or\r\nless by sound instincts and good sense. In the sexual selection of the\r\nfuture the same results will be attained by more or less deliberate and\r\nconscious recognition of the great laws and tendencies which\r\ninvestigation is slowly bringing to light. The new St. Valentine will be\r\na saint of science rather than of folk-lore.\r\n\r\nWhenever such statements as these are made it is always retorted that\r\nlove laughs at science, and that the winds of passion blow where they\r\nlist.[155] That, however, is by no means altogether true, and in any case\r\nit is far from covering the whole of the ground. It is hard to fight\r\nagainst human nature, but human nature itself is opposed to\r\nindiscriminate choice of mates. It is not true that any one tends to\r\nlove anybody, and that mutual attraction is entirely a matter of chance.\r\nThe investigations which have lately been carried out show that there\r\nare certain definite tendencies in this matter, that certain kinds of\r\npeople tend to be attracted to certain kinds, especially that like are\r\nattracted to like rather than unlike to unlike, and that, again, while\r\nsome kinds of people tend to be married with special frequency other\r\nkinds tend to be left unmarried.[156] Sexual selection, even when left to\r\nrandom influences, is still not left to chance; it follows definite and\r\nascertainable laws. In that way the play of love, however free it may\r\nappear, is really limited in a number of directions. People do not tend\r\nto fall in love with those who are in racial respects a contrast to\r\nthemselves; they do not tend to fall in love with foreigners; they do\r\nnot tend to be attracted to the ugly, the diseased, the deformed. All\r\nthese things may happen, but they are the exception and not the rule.\r\nThese limitations to the roving impulses of love, while very real, to\r\nsome extent vary at different periods in accordance with the ideals\r\nwhich happen to be fashionable. In more remote ages they have been still\r\nmore profoundly modified by religious and social ideas; polygamy and\r\npolyandry, the custom of marrying only inside one's own caste, or only\r\noutside it, all these various and contradictory plans have been easily\r\naccepted at some place and some time, and have offered no more conscious\r\nobstacle to the free play of love than among ourselves is offered by the\r\nprohibition against marriage between near relations.\r\n\r\nThose simple-minded people who talk about the blind and irresistible\r\nforce of passion are themselves blind to very ordinary psychological\r\nfacts. Passion--when it occurs--requires in normal persons cumulative\r\nand prolonged forces to impart to it full momentum.[157] In its early\r\nstages it is under the control of many influences, including influences\r\nof reason. If it were not so there could be no sexual selection, nor any\r\nsocial organization.[158]\r\n\r\nThe eugenic ideal which is now developing is thus not an artificial\r\nproduct, but the reasoned manifestation of a natural instinct, which has\r\noften been far more severely strained by the arbitrary prohibitions of\r\nthe past than it is ever likely to be by any eugenic ideals of the\r\nfuture. The new ideal will be absorbed into the conscience of the\r\ncommunity, whether or not like a kind of new religion,[159] and will\r\ninstinctively and unconsciously influence the impulses of men and women.\r\nIt will do all this the more surely since, unlike the taboos of savage\r\nsocieties, the eugenic ideal will lead men and women to reject as\r\npartners only the men and women who are naturally unfit--the diseased,\r\nthe abnormal, the weaklings--and conscience will thus be on the side of\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be pointed out that those who advocate a higher and more\r\nscientific conscience in matters of mating are by no means plotting\r\nagainst love, which is for the most part on their side, but rather\r\nagainst the influences that do violence to love: on the one hand, the\r\nreckless and thoughtless yielding to mere momentary desire, and, on the\r\nother hand, the still more fatal influences of wealth and position and\r\nworldly convenience which give a factitious value to persons who would\r\nnever appear attractive partners in life were love and eugenic ideals\r\nleft to go hand in hand. It is such unions, and not those inspired by\r\nthe wholesome instincts of wholesome lovers, which lead, if not to the\r\nabstract \"deterioration of the race,\" at all events in numberless cases\r\nto the abiding unhappiness of persons who choose a mate without\r\nrealizing how that mate is likely to develop, nor what sort of children\r\nmay probably be expected from the union. The eugenic ideal will have to\r\nstruggle with the criminal and still more resolutely with the rich; it\r\nwill have few serious quarrels with normal and well constituted lovers.\r\n\r\nIt will now perhaps be clear how it is that the eugenic conception of\r\nthe improvement of the race embodies a new ideal. We are familiar with\r\nlegislative projects for compulsory certificates as a condition of\r\nmarriage. But even apart from all the other considerations which make\r\nsuch schemes both illusory and undesirable, these externally imposed\r\nregulations fail to go to the root of the matter. If they are voluntary,\r\nif they spring out of a fine eugenic aspiration, it is another matter.\r\nUnder these conditions the method may be carried out at once. Professor\r\nGrasset has pointed out one way in which this may be effected. We\r\ncannot, he remarks, follow the procedure of a military _conseil de\r\nrevision_ and compulsorily reject the candidate for a definite defect.\r\nBut it would be possible for the two families concerned to call a\r\nconference of their two family doctors, after examination of the\r\nwould-be bride and bridegroom, permitting the doctors to discuss freely\r\nthe medical aspects of the proposed union, and undertaking to accept\r\ntheir decision, without asking for the revelation of any secrets, the\r\nfamilies thus remaining ignorant of the defect which prevented this\r\nunion but might not prevent another union, for the chief danger in many\r\ncases comes from the conjunction of convergent morbid tendencies.[160] In\r\nFrance, where much power remains with the respective families, this\r\nmethod might be operative, provided complete confidence was felt in the\r\ndoctors concerned. In some countries, such as England, the prospective\r\ncouple might prefer to take the matter into their own hands, to discuss\r\nit frankly, and to seek medical advice on their own account; this is now\r\nmuch more frequently done than was formerly the case. But all compulsory\r\nprojects of this kind, and indeed any mere legislation, cannot go to the\r\nroot of the matter. For in the first place, what we need is a great body\r\nof facts, and a careful attention to the record and registration and\r\nstatistical tabulation of personal and family histories. In the second\r\nplace, we need that sound ideals and a high sense of responsibility\r\nshould permeate the whole community, first its finer and more\r\ndistinguished members and then, by the usual contagion that rules in\r\nsuch matters, the whole body of its members.[161] In time, no doubt, this\r\nwould lead to concerted social action. We may reasonably expect that a\r\ntime will come when if, for instance, an epileptic woman conceals her\r\ncondition from the man she is marrying it would generally be felt that\r\nan offence has been committed serious enough to invalidate the marriage.\r\nWe must not suppose that lovers would be either willing or competent to\r\ninvestigate each other's family and medical histories. But it would be\r\nat least as easy and as simple to choose a partner from those persons\r\nwho had successfully passed the eugenic test--more especially since such\r\npersons would certainly be the most attractive group in the\r\ncommunity--as it is for an Australian aborigine to select a conjugal\r\npartner from one social group rather than from any other.[162] It is a\r\nmatter of accepting an ideal and of exerting our personal and social\r\ninfluence in the direction of that ideal. If we really seek to raise the\r\nlevel of humanity we may in this way begin to do so to-day.\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE LIFE-HISTORY RECORD\r\n\r\nThe extreme interest of a Life-History Record is obvious, even apart\r\nfrom its eventual scientific value. Most of us would have reason to\r\ncongratulate ourselves had such records been customary when we were\r\nourselves children. It is probable that this is becoming more generally\r\nrealized, though until recently only the pioneers have here been active.\r\n\"I started a Life-History Album for each of my children,\" writes Mr.\r\nF.H. Perrycoste in a private letter, \"as soon as they were born; and by\r\nthe time they arrive at man's and woman's estate they will have valuable\r\nrecords of their own physical, mental, and moral development, which\r\nshould be of great service to them when they come to have children of\r\ntheir own, whilst the physical--in which are included, of course,\r\nmedical--records may at any time be of great value to their own medical\r\nadvisers in later life. I have reason to regret that some such Albums\r\nwere not kept for my wife and myself, for they would have afforded the\r\nnecessary data by which to 'size up' the abilities and conduct of our\r\nchildren. I know, for instance, pretty well what was my own Galtonian\r\nrank as a schoolboy, and I am constantly asking myself whether my boy\r\nwill do as well, better, or worse. Now fortunately I do happen to\r\nremember roughly what stages I had reached at one or two transition\r\nperiods of school-life; but if only such an Album had been kept for me,\r\nI could turn it up and check my boy against myself in each subject at\r\neach yearly stage. You will gather from this that I consider it of great\r\nimportance that ample details of school-work and intellectual\r\ndevelopment should be entered in the Album. I find the space at my\r\ndisposal for these entries insufficient, and consequently I summarize in\r\nthe Album and insert a reference to sheets of fuller details which I\r\nkeep; but it might be well, when another edition of the Album comes to\r\nbe published, to agitate for the insertion of extra blank pages after\r\nthe age of eight or nine, in order to allow of the transcription of full\r\nschool-reports. However, the great thing is to induce people to keep an\r\nAlbum that will form the nucleus round which any number of fuller\r\nrecords can cluster.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the Galtonian type of Album should be rigidly\r\npreserved, and I am indebted to \"Henry Hamill,\" the author of _The Truth\r\nWe Owe to Youth_, for the following suggestions as to the way in which\r\nsuch a record may be carried out:\r\n\r\n\"The book should not be a mere dry rigmarole, but include a certain\r\nappeal to sentiment. The subject should begin to make the entries\r\nhimself when old enough to do so properly, i.e. so that the book will\r\nnot be disfigured--though indeed the naivity of juvenile phrasing, etc.,\r\nmay be of a particular interest. From a graphological point of view, the\r\nevolution of the handwriting will be of interest; and if for no other\r\nreason, specimens of handwriting ought to appear in it from year to\r\nyear, while the parent is still writing the other entries. There may now\r\nbe a certain sacramental character in the life-history. The subject\r\nshould be led to regard the book as a witness, and to perceive in it an\r\nadditional reason for avoiding every act the mention of which would be a\r\ndisfigurement of the history. At the same time, the nature of the\r\nwitness may be made to correct the wrong notions prevailing as to the\r\nworthiness of acts, and to sanctify certain of them that have been\r\nfoolishly degraded. Thus there may be left several leaves blank before\r\nthe pages of forms for filling in anthropometric and physiological data,\r\nand the headings may be made to suggest a worthier way of viewing these\r\nthings. For instance, there may be the indication 'Place and time of\r\nconception,' and a specimen entry may be of service to lead commonplace\r\nminds into a more reverent and poetical view than is now usual--such as\r\nthe one I culled from the life-history of an American child: 'Our\r\nsecond child M---- was conceived on Midsummer Day, under the shade of a\r\nfriendly sycamore, beneath the cloudless blue of Southern California.'\r\nOr, instead of restricting the reference to the particular episode, it\r\nmay refer to the whole chapter of Love which that episode adorned, more\r\nespecially in the case of a first child, when a poetical history of the\r\nmating of the parents may precede. The presence of the idea that the\r\nbook would some day be read by others than the intimate circle, would\r\nrestrain the tendency of some persons to inordinate self-revelation and\r\n'gush.' Such books as these would form the dearest heirlooms of a\r\nfamily, helping to knit its bonds firmer, and giving an insight into\r\nindividual character which would supplement the more tangible data for\r\nthe pedigree in a most valuable way. The photographs taken every three\r\nmonths or so ought to be as largely as possible nude. The gradual\r\ntransition from childhood would help to prevent an abrupt feeling\r\narising, and the practice would be a valuable aid to the rehabilitation\r\nof the nude, and of genuineness in our daily life, no matter in what\r\nrespect. This leads to the difficult question of how far moral aspects\r\nshould be entertained. 'To-day Johnnie told his first fib; we pretended\r\nto disbelieve everything else he said, and he began to see that lying\r\nwas bad policy.' 'Chastised Johnnie for the first time for pulling the\r\nwings off a fly; he wanted to know why we might kill flies outright, but\r\nnot mutilate them,' and so on. For in this way parents would train\r\nthemselves in the psychology of education and character-building, though\r\nbooks by specially gifted parents would soon appear for their guidance.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, whatever relevant circumstances were available about the\r\nante-natal period or the mother's condition would be noted (but who\r\nwould expect a mother to note that she laced tight up to such and such a\r\nmonth? Perhaps the keeping of a log like this might act as a deterrent).\r\nSimilarly, under diet and regimen, year by year, the assumption of\r\nbreast-feeding--provision of columns for the various incidents of\r\nit--weight before and after feeding, etc., would have a great suggestive\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\"The provision under diet and regimen of columns for 'drug habits, if\r\nany'--tea, coffee, alcohol, nicotine, morphia, etc.--would have a\r\nsuggestive value and operate in the direction of the simple life and a\r\nreverence for the body. Some good aphorisms might be strewed in, such\r\nas:\r\n\r\n\"'If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred' (Whitman).\r\n\r\n\"As young people circulate their 'Books of Likes and Dislikes,' etc.,\r\nand thus in an entertaining way provide each other with insight into\r\nmutual character, so the Life-History need not be an _arcanum_--at least\r\nwhere people have nothing to be ashamed of. It would be a very trying\r\nordeal, no doubt, to admit even intimate friends to this confidence.\r\n_But as eugenics spread, concealment of taint will become almost\r\nimpracticable_, and the facts may as well be confessed. But even then\r\nthere will be limitations. There might be an esoteric book for the\r\nindividual's own account of himself. Such important items as the\r\nincidence of puberty (though notorious in some communities) could not\r\nwell be included in a book open even to the family circle, for\r\ngenerations to come. The quiescence of the genital sense, the sedatives\r\nnaturally occurring, important as these are, and occupying the\r\nconsciousness in so large a degree, would find no place; nevertheless, a\r\nprivate journal of the facts would help to steady the individual, and\r\nprove a check against disrespect to his body.\r\n\r\n\"As the facts of individual evolution would be noted, so likewise would\r\nthose of dissolution. The first signs of decay--the teeth, the\r\nelasticity of body and mind--would provide a valuable sphere for all who\r\nare disposed to the diary-habit. The journals of individuals with a gift\r\nfor introspection would furnish valuable material for psychologists in\r\nthe future. Life would be cleansed in many ways. Journals would not have\r\nto be bowdlerized, like Marie Bashkirtseff's, for the morbidity that\r\ngloats on the forbidden would have a lesser scope, much that is now\r\nregarded as disgraceful being then accepted as natural and right.\r\n\r\n\"The book might have several volumes, and that for the periods of\r\ninfancy and childhood might need to be less private than the one for\r\npuberty. More, in his _Utopia_, demands that lovers shall learn to know\r\neach other as they really are, i.e. naked. That is now the most Utopian\r\nthing in More's _Utopia_. But the lovers might communicate their\r\nlife-histories to each other as a preliminary.\r\n\r\n\"The whole plan would, of course, finally have to be over-hauled by the\r\nso-called 'man of the world.'\"\r\n\r\nNot everyone may agree with this conception of the Life-History Album\r\nand its uses. Some will prefer a severely dry and bald record of\r\nmeasurements. At the present time, however, there is room for very\r\nvarious types of such documents. The important point is to realize that,\r\nin some form or another, a record of this kind from birth or earlier is\r\npracticable, and constitutes a record which is highly desirable alike on\r\npersonal, social, and scientific grounds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[147] Dr. Scott Nearing, \"Race Suicide _versus_ Over-Population,\" _Popular\r\nScience Monthly_, January, 1911. And from the biological side Professor\r\nBateson concludes (_Biological Fact and the Structure of Society_, p.\r\n23) that \"it is in a decline in the birth-rate that the most promising\r\nomen exists for the happiness of future generations.\"\r\n\r\n[148] Galton himself, the grandson of Erasmus Darwin, and the half-cousin\r\nof Charles Darwin, may be said to furnish a noble illustration of an\r\nunconscious process of eugenics. (He has set forth his ancestry in\r\n_Memories of My Life_.) On his death, the editor of the _Popular Science\r\nMonthly_ wrote, referring to the fact that Galton was nominated to\r\nsucceed William James in the honorary membership of an Academy of\r\nScience: \"These two men are the greatest whom he has known. James\r\npossessed the more complicated personality; but they had certain common\r\ntraits--a combination of perfect aristocracy with complete democracy,\r\ndirectness, kindliness, generosity, and nobility beyond all measure. It\r\nhas been said that eugenics is futile because it cannot define its end.\r\nThe answer is simple--we want men like William James and Francis Galton\"\r\n(_Popular Science Monthly_, _March_, 1911.) Probably most of those who\r\nwere brought, however slightly, in contact with these two fine\r\npersonalities will subscribe to this conclusion.\r\n\r\n[149] Galton chiefly studied the families to which men of intellectual\r\nability belong, especially in his _Hereditary Genius_ and _English Men\r\nof Science_; various kinds of pathological families have since been\r\ninvestigated by Karl Pearson and his co-workers (see the series of\r\n_Biometrika_); the pedigrees of the defective classes (especially the\r\nfeeble-minded and epileptic) are now being accurately worked out, as by\r\nGodden, at Vineland, New Jersey, and Davenport, in New York (see e.g.\r\n_Eugenics Review_, April, 1911, and _Journal of Nervous and Mental\r\nDisease_, November, 1911).\r\n\r\n[150] \"When once more the importance of good birth comes to be recognized\r\nin a new sense,\" wrote W.C.D. Whetham and Mrs. Whetham (in _The Family\r\nand the Nation_, p. 222), \"when the innate physical and mental qualities\r\nof different families are recorded in the central sociological\r\ndepartment or scientifically reformed College of Arms, the pedigrees of\r\nall will be known to be of supreme interest. It would be understood to\r\nbe more important to marry into a family with a good hereditary record\r\nof physical and mental and moral qualities than it ever has been\r\nconsidered to be allied to one with sixteen quarterings.\"\r\n\r\n[151] The importance of such biographical records of aptitude and\r\ncharacter are so great that some, like Schallmayer (_Vererbung und\r\nAuslese_, 2nd ed., 1910, p. 389) believe that they must be made\r\nuniversally obligatory. This proposal, however, seems premature.\r\n\r\n[152] In many undesigned and unforeseen ways these registers may be of\r\nimmense value. They may even prove the means of overthrowing our\r\npernicious and destructive system of so-called \"education.\" A step in\r\nthis direction has been suggested by Mr. R.T. Bodey, Inspector of\r\nElementary Schools, at a meeting of the Liverpool branch of the Eugenics\r\nEducation Society: \"Education facilities should be carefully distributed\r\nwith regard to the scientific likelihood of their utilization to the\r\nmaximum of national advantage, and this not for economic reasons only,\r\nbut because it was cruel to drag children from their own to a different\r\nsphere of life, and cruel to the class they deserted. Since the\r\nactivities of the nation and the powers of the children were alike\r\nvaried in kind and degree, the most natural plan would be to sort them\r\nboth out, and then design a school system expressly in order to fit one\r\nto the other. At present there was no fixed purpose, but a perpetual\r\nriot of changes, resulting in distraction of mind, discontinuity of\r\npurpose, and increase of cost, while happiness decayed because desires\r\ngrew faster than possessions or the sense of achievement. The only\r\nreally scientific basis for a national system of education would be a\r\nfull knowledge of the family history of each child. With more perfect\r\nclassification of family talent the need of scholarships of\r\ntransplantation would become less, for each of them was the confession\r\nof an initial error in placing the child. Then there would be more money\r\nto be spared for industrial research, travelling and art studentships,\r\nand other aids to those who had the rare gift of original thought\"\r\n(_British Medical Journal_, November 18, 1911).\r\n\r\n[153] I should add that there is one obstacle, viz. expense. When the\r\npresent chapter was first published in its preliminary form as an\r\narticle in the _Nineteenth Century and After_ (May, 1906), Galton,\r\nalways alive to everything bearing on the study of Eugenics, wrote to me\r\nthat he had been impressed by the generally sympathetic reception my\r\npaper had received, and that he felt encouraged to consider whether it\r\nwas possible to begin giving such certificates at once. He asked for my\r\nviews, among others, as to the ground which should be covered by such\r\ncertificates. The programme I set forth was somewhat extensive, as I\r\nconsidered that the applicant must not only bring evidence of a sound\r\nancestry, but also submit to anthropological, psychological, and medical\r\nexamination. Galton eventually came to the conclusion that the expenses\r\ninvolved by the scheme rendered it for the present impracticable. My\r\nopinion was, and is, that though the charge for such a certificate might\r\nin the first place be prohibitive for most people, a few persons might\r\nfind it desirable to seek, and advantageous to possess, such\r\ncertificates, and that it is worth while at all events to make a\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n[154] Mannhardt, _Wald-und Feldkulte_, 1875, Vol. I, pp. 422 _et seq._ I\r\nhave discussed seasonal erotic festivals in a study of \"The Phenomena of\r\nSexual Periodicity,\" _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n[155] Thus we read in a small popular periodical: \"I am prepared to back\r\nhuman nature against all the cranks in Christendom. Human nature will\r\nendure a faddist so long as he does not interfere with things it prizes.\r\nOne of these things is the right to select its partner for life. If a\r\nman loves a girl he is not going to give her up because she happens to\r\nhave an aunt in a lunatic asylum or an uncle who has epileptic fits,\"\r\netc. In the same way it may be said that a man will allow nothing to\r\ninterfere with his right to eat such food as he chooses, and is not\r\ngoing to give up a dish he likes because it happens to be peppered with\r\narsenic. It may be so, let us grant, among savages. The growth of\r\ncivilization lies in ever-extended self-control guided by foresight.\r\n\r\n[156] I have summarized some of the evidence on these points, especially\r\nthat showing that sexual attraction tends to be towards like persons and\r\nnot, as was formerly supposed, towards the unlike, in _Studies in the\r\nPsychology of Sex_, Vol. IV, \"Sexual Selection in Man.\"\r\n\r\n[157] In other words, the process of tumescence is gradual and complex.\r\nSee Havelock Ellis, _Studies in the Psychology of Sex_, Vol. III, \"The\r\nAnalysis of the Sexual Impulse.\"\r\n\r\n[158] As Roswell Johnson remarks (\"The Evolution of Man and its Control,\"\r\n_Popular Science Monthly_, January, 1910): \"While it is undeniable that\r\nlove when once established defies rational considerations, yet we must\r\nremark that sexual selection proceeds usually through two stages, the\r\nfirst being one of mere mutual attraction and interest. It is in this\r\nstage that the will and reason are operative, and here alone that any\r\nconsiderable elevation of standard may be effective.\"\r\n\r\n[159] Galton looked upon eugenics as fitted to become a factor in religion\r\n(_Essays in Eugenics_, p. 68). It may, however, be questioned whether\r\nthis consummation is either probable or desirable. The same religious\r\nclaim has been made for socialism. But, as Dr. Eden Paul remarks in a\r\nrecent pamphlet on _Socialism and Eugenics_, \"Whereas both Socialism and\r\nEugenics are concerned solely with the application of the knowledge\r\ngained by experience to the amelioration of the human lot, it seems\r\npreferable to dispense with religious terminology, and to regard the two\r\ndoctrines as complementary parts of the great modern movement known by\r\nthe name of Humanism.\" Personally, I do not consider that either\r\nSocialism or Eugenics can be regarded as coming within the legitimate\r\nsphere of religion, which I have elsewhere attempted to define\r\n(Conclusion to _The New Spirit_).\r\n\r\n[160] J. Grasset, in Dr. A. Marie's _Traite International de Psychologie\r\nPathologique_, 1910, Vol. I, p. 25. Grasset proceeds to discuss the\r\nprinciples which must guide the physician in such consultations.\r\n\r\n[161] This has been clearly realized by the German Society of Eugenics or\r\n\"Racial Hygiene,\" as it is usually termed in Germany (Internationale\r\nGesellschaft fuer Rassen-Hygiene), founded by Dr. Alfred Ploetz, with the\r\nco-operation of many distinguished physicians and men of science, \"to\r\nfurther the theory and practice of racial hygiene.\" It is a chief aim of\r\nthis Society to encourage the registration by the members of the\r\nbiological and other physical and psychic characteristics of themselves\r\nand their families, in order to obtain a body of data on which\r\nconclusions may eventually be based; the members undertake not to enter\r\non a marriage except they are assured by medical investigation of both\r\nparties that the union is not likely to cause disaster to either partner\r\nor to the offspring. The Society also admits associates who only occupy\r\nthemselves with the scientific aspects of its work and with propaganda.\r\nIn England the Eugenics Education Society (with its organ the _Eugenics\r\nReview_) has done much to stimulate an intelligent interest in\r\neugenics.\r\n\r\n[162] How influential public opinion may be in the selection of mates is\r\nindicated by the influence it already exerts--in less than a century--in\r\nthe limitation of offspring. This is well marked in some parts of\r\nFrance. Thus, concerning a rural district near the Garonne, Dr. Belbeze,\r\nwho knows it thoroughly, writes (_La Neurasthenie Rurale_, 1911):\r\n\"Public opinion does not at present approve of multiple procreation.\r\nLarge families, there can be no doubt, are treated with contempt.\r\nCouples who produce a numerous progeny are looked on, with a wink, as\r\n'maladroits,' which in this region is perhaps the supreme term of\r\nabuse.... Public opinion is all-powerful, and alone suffices to produce\r\nrestraint, when foresight is not adequate for this purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nRELIGION AND THE CHILD\r\n\r\n     Religious Education in Relation to Social Hygiene and to\r\n     Psychology--The Psychology of the Child--The Contents of Children's\r\n     Minds--The Imagination of Children--How far may Religion be\r\n     assimilated by Children?--Unfortunate Results of Early Religious\r\n     Instruction--Puberty the Age for Religious Education--Religion as\r\n     an Initiation into a Mystery--Initiation among Savages--The\r\n     Christian Sacraments--The Modern Tendency as regards Religious\r\n     Instruction--Its Advantages--Children and Fairy Tales--The Bible of\r\n     Childhood--Moral Training.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fact as strange as it is unfortunate that the much-debated\r\nquestion of the religious education of children is almost exclusively\r\nconsidered from the points of view of the sectarian and the secularist.\r\nIn a discussion of this question we are almost certain to be invited to\r\ntake part in an unedifying wrangle between Church and Chapel, between\r\nreligion and secularism. That is the strange part of it, that it should\r\nseem impossible to get away from this sectarian dispute as to the\r\nabstract claims of varying religious bodies. The unfortunate part of it\r\nis that in this quarrel the interests of the community, the interests of\r\nthe child, even the interests of religion are alike disregarded.\r\n\r\nIf we really desire to reach a sound conclusion on a matter which is\r\nunquestionably of great moment, both for the child and for the community\r\nof which he will one day become a citizen, we must resolutely put into\r\nthe background, as of secondary importance, the cries of contending\r\nsects, religious or irreligious. The first place here belongs to the\r\npsychologist, who is building up the already extensive edifice of\r\nknowledge concerning the real nature of the child and the contents and\r\ngrowth of the youthful mind, and to the practical teacher who is in\r\ntouch with that knowledge and can bring it to the test of actual\r\nexperience. Before considering what drugs are to be administered we must\r\nconsider the nature of the organism they are to be thrust into.\r\n\r\nThe mind of the child is at once logical and extravagant, matter-of-fact\r\nand poetic or rather mytho-poeic. This combination of apparent\r\nopposites, though it often seems almost incomprehensible to the adult,\r\nis the inevitable outcome of the fact that the child's dawning\r\nintelligence is working, as it were, in a vacuum. In other words, the\r\nchild has not acquired the two endowments which chiefly give character\r\nto the whole body of the adult's beliefs and feelings. He is without the\r\npubertal expansion which fills out the mind with new personal and\r\naltruistic impulses and transforms it with emotion that is often\r\ndazzling and sometimes distorting; and he has not yet absorbed, or even\r\ngained the power of absorbing, all those beliefs, opinions, and mental\r\nattitudes which the race has slowly acquired and transmitted as the\r\ntraditional outcome of its experiences.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual processes of children, the attitude and contents of the\r\nchild's mind, have been explored during recent years with a care and\r\ndetail that have never been brought to that study before. This is not a\r\nmatter of which the adult can be said to possess any instinctive or\r\nmatter-of-course knowledge. Adults usually have a strange aptitude to\r\nforget entirely the facts of their lives as children, and children are\r\nusually, like peoples of primitive race, very cautious in the deliberate\r\ncommunication of their mental operations, their emotions, and their\r\nideas. That is to say that the child is equally without the internally\r\nacquired complex emotional nature which has its kernel in the sexual\r\nimpulse, and without the externally acquired mental equipment which may\r\nbe summed up in the word tradition. But he possesses the vivid\r\nactivities founded on the exercise of his senses and appetites, and he\r\nis able to reason with a relentless severity from which the\r\ntraditionalized and complexly emotional adult shrinks back with horror.\r\nThe child creates the world for himself, and he creates it in his own\r\nimage and the images of the persons he is familiar with. Nothing is\r\nsacred to him, and he pushes to the most daring extremities--as it seems\r\nto the adult--the arguments derived from his own personal experiences.\r\nHe is unable to see any distinction between the natural and the\r\nsupernatural, and he is justified in this conviction because, as a\r\nmatter of fact, he himself lives in what for most adults would be a\r\nsupernatural atmosphere; most children see visions with closed and\r\nsometimes with open eyes;[163] they are not infrequently subject to\r\ncolour-hearing and other synaesthetic sensations; and they occasionally\r\nhear hallucinatory voices. It is possible, indeed, that this is the case\r\nwith all children in some slight degree, although the faculty dies out\r\nearly and is easily forgotten because its extraordinary character was\r\nnever recognized.\r\n\r\nOf 48 Boston children, says Stanley Hall,[164] 20 believed the sun, moon,\r\nand stars to live, 16 thought flowers could feel, and 15 that dolls\r\nwould feel pain if burnt. The sky was found the chief field in which the\r\nchildren exercise their philosophic minds. About three-quarters of them\r\nthought the world a plain with the sky like a bowl turned over it,\r\nsometimes believing that it was of such thin texture that one could\r\neasily break through, though so large that much floor-sweeping was\r\nnecessary in Heaven. The sun may enter the ground when it sets, but half\r\nthe children thought that at night it rolls or flies away, or is blown\r\nor walks, or God pulls it higher up out of sight, taking it up into\r\nHeaven, according to some putting it to bed, and even taking off its\r\nclothes and putting them on again in the morning, or again, it is\r\nbelieved to lie under the trees at night and the angels mind it. God, of\r\nwhom the children always hear so much, plays a very large part in these\r\nconceptions, and is made directly responsible for all cosmic phenomena.\r\nThus thunder to these American children was God groaning or kicking or\r\nrolling barrels about, or turning a big handle, or grinding snow, or\r\nbreaking something, or rattling a big hammer; while the lightning is due\r\nto God putting his finger out, or turning the gas on quick, or striking\r\nmatches, or setting paper on fire. According to Boston children, God is\r\na big, perhaps a blue, man, to be seen in the sky, on the clouds, in\r\nchurch, or even in the streets. They declare that God comes to see them\r\nsometimes, and they have seen him enter the gate. He makes lamps,\r\nbabies, dogs, trees, money, etc., and the angels work for him. He looks\r\nlike a priest, or a teacher, or papa, and the children like to look at\r\nhim; a few would themselves like to be God. His house in the sky may be\r\nmade of stone or brick; birds, children, and Santa Claus live with God.\r\n\r\nBirds and beasts, their food and their furniture, as Burnham points out,\r\nall talk to children; when the dew is on the grass \"the grass is\r\ncrying,\" the stars are candles or lamps, perhaps cinders from God's\r\nstove, butterflies are flying pansies, icicles are Christmas candy.\r\nChildren have imaginary play-brothers and sisters and friends, with whom\r\nthey talk. Sometimes God talks with them. Even the prosiest things are\r\nvivified; the tracks of dirty feet on the floor are flowers; a creaking\r\nchair talks; the shoemaker's nails are children whom he is driving to\r\nschool; a pedlar is Santa Claus.\r\n\r\nMiss Miriam Levy once investigated the opinions of 560 children, boys\r\nand girls, between the ages of 4 and 14, as to how the man in the moon\r\ngot there. Only 5 were unable to offer a serious explanation; 48 thought\r\nthere was no man there at all; 50 offered a scientific explanation of\r\nthe phenomena; but all the rest, the great majority, presented\r\nimaginative solutions which could be grouped into seventeen different\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nSuch facts as these--which can easily be multiplied and are indeed\r\nfamiliar to all, though their significance is not usually\r\nrealized--indicate the special tendencies of the child in the religious\r\nsphere. He is unable to follow the distinctions which the adult is\r\npleased to make between \"real,\" \"spiritual\" and \"imaginary\" beings. To\r\nhim such distinctions do not exist. He may, if he so pleases, adopt the\r\nnames or such characteristics as he chooses, of the beings he is told\r\nabout, but he puts them into his own world, on a footing of more or less\r\nequality, and he decides himself what their fate is to be. The adult's\r\nsupreme beings by no means always survive in the struggle for existence\r\nwhich takes place in the child's imaginative world. It was found among\r\nmany thousand children entering the city schools of Berlin that Red\r\nRiding Hood was better known than God, and Cinderella than Christ. That\r\nis the result of the child's freedom from the burden of tradition.\r\n\r\nYet at the same time the opposite though allied peculiarity of\r\nchildhood--the absence of the emotional developments of puberty which\r\ndeepen and often cloud the mind a few years later--is also making itself\r\nfelt. Extravagant as his beliefs may appear, the child is an\r\nuncompromising rationalist and realist. His supposed imaginativeness is\r\nindeed merely the result of his logical insistence that all the new\r\nphenomena presented to him shall be thought of in terms of himself and\r\nhis own environment. His wildest notions are based on precise, concrete,\r\nand personal facts of his own experience. That is why he is so keen a\r\nquestioner of grown-up people's ideas, and a critic who may sometimes be\r\nas dangerous and destructive as Bishop Colenso's Zulus. Most children\r\nbefore the age of thirteen, as Earl Barnes states, are inquirers, if not\r\nsceptics.\r\n\r\nIf we clearly realize these characteristics of the childish mind, we\r\ncannot fail to understand the impression made on it by religious\r\ninstruction. The statements and stories that are repeated to him are\r\neasily accepted by the child in so far, and in so far only, as they\r\nanswer to his needs; and when accepted they are assimilated, which means\r\nthat they are compelled to obey the laws of his own mental world. In so\r\nfar as the statements and stories presented to him are not acceptable or\r\ncannot be assimilated, it happens either that they pass by him\r\nunnoticed, or else that he subjects them to a cold and matter-of-fact\r\nlogic which exerts a dissolving influence upon them.\r\n\r\nNow a few of the ideas of religion are assimilable by the child, and\r\nnotably the idea of a God as the direct agent in cosmic phenomena; some\r\nof the childish notions I have quoted illustrate the facility with which\r\nthe child adopts this idea. He adopts, that is, what may be called the\r\nhard precise skeleton of the idea, and imagines a colossal magician, of\r\nanthropomorphic (if not paidomorphic) nature, whose operations are\r\ncurious, though they altogether fail to arouse any mysterious reverence\r\nor awe for the agent. Even this is not very satisfactory, and Stanley\r\nHall, in the spirit of Froebel, considers that the best result is\r\nattained when the child knows no God but his own mother.[165] But for the\r\nmost part the ideas of religion cannot be accepted or assimilated by\r\nchildren at all; they were not made by children or for children, but\r\nrepresent the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of men, and sometimes\r\neven of very exceptional and abnormal men. \"The child,\" it has been\r\nsaid, \"no doubt has the psychical elements out of which the religious\r\nexperience is evolved, just as the seed has the promise of the fruit\r\nwhich will come in the fullness of time. But to say, therefore, that the\r\naverage child is religious, or capable of receiving the usual advanced\r\nreligious instruction, is equivalent to saying that the seed is the\r\nfruit or capable of being converted into fruit before the fullness of\r\ntime.\"[166] The child who grows devout and becomes anxious about the state\r\nof his soul is a morbid and unwholesome child; if he prefers praying for\r\nthe conversion of his play-fellows to joining them in their games he is\r\nnot so much an example of piety as a pathological case whose future must\r\nbe viewed with anxiety; and to preach religious duties to children is\r\nexactly the same, it has been well said, as to exhort them to imagine\r\nthemselves married people and to inculcate on them the duties of that\r\nrelation. Fortunately the normal child is usually able to resist these\r\ninfluences. It is the healthy child's impulse either to let them fall\r\nwith indifference or to apply to them the instrument of his unmerciful\r\nlogic.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the adult, in self-defence, is compelled to react against\r\nthis indifferent or aggressive attitude of the child. He may be no match\r\nfor the child in logic, and even unspeakably shocked by his daring\r\ninquiries, like an amiable old clergyman I knew when a Public School\r\nteacher in Australia; he went to a school to give Bible lessons, and was\r\none day explaining how King David was a man after God's own heart, when\r\na small voice was heard making inquiries about Uriah's wife; the small\r\nboy was hushed down by the shocked clergyman, and the cause of religion\r\nwas not furthered in that school. But the adult knows that he has on his\r\nside tradition which has not yet been acquired by the child, and the\r\ninner emotional expansion which still remains unliberated in the child.\r\nThe adult, therefore, fortified by this superiority, feels justified in\r\nfalling back on the weapon of authority: \"You may not _want_ to believe\r\nthis and to learn it, but you've _got_ to.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that the adult wins the battle of religious education.\r\nIn the deeper and more far-seeing sense he has lost it. Religion has\r\nbecome, not a charming privilege, but a lesson, a lesson about\r\nunbelievable things, a meaningless task to be learnt by heart, a\r\ndrudgery. It may be said that even if that is so, religious lessons\r\nmerely share the inevitable fate of all subjects which become school\r\ntasks. But that is not the case. Every other subject which is likely to\r\nbecome a school task is apt to become intelligible and attractive to\r\nsome considerable section of the scholars because it is within the range\r\nof childish intelligence. But, for the two very definite reasons I have\r\npointed out, this is only to an extremely limited degree true as regards\r\nthe subject of religion, because the young organism is an instrument not\r\nas yet fitted with the notes which religion is most apt to strike.\r\n\r\nOf all the school subjects religion thus tends to be the least\r\nattractive. Lobsien, at Kiel, found a few years since, in the course of\r\na psychological investigation, that when five hundred children (boys and\r\ngirls in equal numbers), between the ages of nine and fourteen, were\r\nasked which was their favourite lesson hour, only twelve (ten girls and\r\ntwo boys) named the religious lesson.[167] In other words, nearly 98 per\r\ncent children (and nearly all the boys) find that religion is either an\r\nindifferent or a repugnant subject. I have no reports at hand as regards\r\nEnglish children, but there is little reason to suppose that the result\r\nwould be widely different.[168] Here and there a specially skilful\r\nteacher might bring about a result more favourable to religious\r\nteaching, but that could only be done by depriving the subject of its\r\nmost characteristic elements.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, not by any means the whole of the mischief which, from\r\nthe religious point of view, is thus perpetrated. It might, on _a\r\npriori_ grounds, be plausibly argued that even if there is among healthy\r\nyoung children a certain amount of indifference or even repugnance to\r\nreligious instruction, that is of very little consequence: they cannot\r\nbe too early grounded in the principles of the faith they will later be\r\ncalled on to profess; and however incapable they may now be of\r\nunderstanding the teaching that is being inculcated in the school, they\r\nwill realize its importance when their knowledge and experience\r\nincrease. But however plausible this may seem, practically it is not\r\nwhat usually happens. The usual effect of constantly imparting to\r\nchildren an instruction they are not yet ready to receive is to deaden\r\ntheir sensibilities to the whole subject of religion.[169] The premature\r\nfamiliarity with religious influences--putting aside the rare cases\r\nwhere it leads to a morbid pre-occupation with religion--induces a\r\nreaction of routine which becomes so habitual that it successfully\r\nwithstands the later influences which on more virgin soil would have\r\nevoked vigorous and living response. So far from preparing the way for a\r\nmore genuine development of religious impulse later on, this precocious\r\nscriptural instruction is just adequate to act as an inoculation against\r\ndeeper and more serious religious interests. The commonplace child in\r\nlater life accepts the religion it has been inured to so early as part\r\nof the conventional routine of life. The more vigorous and original\r\nchild for the same reason shakes it off, perhaps for ever.\r\n\r\nLuther, feeling the need to gain converts to Protestantism as early as\r\npossible, was a strong advocate for the religious training of children,\r\nand has doubtless had much influence in this matter on the Protestant\r\nchurches. \"The study of religion, of the Bible and the Catechism,\" says\r\nFiedler, \"of course comes first and foremost in his scheme of\r\ninstruction.\" He was also quite prepared to adapt it to the childish\r\nmind. \"Let children be taught,\" he writes, \"that our dear Lord sits in\r\nHeaven on a golden throne, that He has a long grey beard and a crown of\r\ngold.\" But Luther quite failed to realize the inevitable psychological\r\nreaction in later life against such fairy-tales.\r\n\r\nAt a later date, Rousseau, who, like Luther, was on the side of\r\nreligion, realized, as Luther failed to realize, the disastrous results\r\nof attempting to teach it to children. In _La Nouvelle Heloise_,\r\nSaint-Preux writes that Julie had explained to him how she sought to\r\nsurround her children with good influences without forcing any religious\r\ninstruction on them: \"As to the Catechism, they don't so much as know\r\nwhat it is.\" \"What! Julie, your children don't learn their Catechism?\"\r\n\"No, my friend, my children don't learn their Catechism.\" \"So pious a\r\nmother!\" I exclaimed; \"I can't understand. And why don't your children\r\nlearn their Catechism?\" \"In order that they may one day believe it. I\r\nwish to make Christians of them.\"[170]\r\n\r\nSince Rousseau's day this may be said to be the general attitude of\r\nnearly all thinkers who have given attention to the question, even\r\nthough they may not have viewed it psychologically. It is an attitude by\r\nno means confined to those who are anxious that children should grow up\r\nto be genuine Christians, but is common to all who consider that the\r\nmain point is that children should grow up to be, at all events, genuine\r\nmen and women. \"I do not think,\" writes John Stuart Mill, in 1868,\r\n\"there should be any _authoritative_ teaching at all on such subjects. I\r\nthink parents ought to point out to their children, when the children\r\nbegin to question them or to make observations of their own, the various\r\nopinions on such subjects, and what the parents themselves think the\r\nmost powerful reasons for and against. Then, if the parents show a\r\nstrong feeling of the importance of truth, and also of the difficulty of\r\nattaining it, it seems to me that young people's minds will be\r\nsufficiently prepared to regard popular opinion or the opinion of those\r\nabout them with respectful tolerance, and may be safely left to form\r\ndefinite conclusions in the course of mature life.\"[171]\r\n\r\nThere are few among us who have not suffered from too early familiarity\r\nwith the Bible and the conceptions of religion. Even for a man of really\r\nstrong and independent intellect it may be many years before the\r\nprecociously dulled feelings become fresh again, before the fetters of\r\nroutine fall off, and he is enabled at last to approach the Bible with\r\nfresh receptivity and to realize, for the first time in his life, the\r\ntreasures of art and beauty and divine wisdom it contains. But for most\r\nthat moment never comes round. For the majority the religious education\r\nof the school as effectually seals the Bible for life as the classical\r\neducation of the college seals the great authors of Greece and Rome for\r\nlife; no man opens his school books again when he has once left school.\r\nThose who read Greek and Latin for love have not usually come out of\r\nuniversities, and there is surely a certain significance in the fact\r\nthat the children of one's secularist friends are so often found to\r\nbecome devout church-goers, while, according to the frequent\r\nobservation, devout parents often have most irreligious offspring, just\r\nas the bad boys at school and college are frequently sons of the clergy.\r\n\r\nAt puberty and during adolescence everything begins to be changed. The\r\nchange, it is important to remember, is a natural change, and tends to\r\ncome about spontaneously; \"where no set forms have been urged, the\r\nreligious emotion,\" as Lancaster puts it, \"comes forth as naturally as\r\nthe sun rises.\"[172] That period, really and psychologically, marks a \"new\r\nbirth.\" Emotions which are of fundamental importance, not only for the\r\nindividual's personal life but for his social and even cosmic\r\nrelationships, are for the first time born. Not only is the child's body\r\nremoulded in the form of a man or a woman, but the child-soul becomes a\r\nman-soul or a woman-soul, and nothing can possibly be as it has been\r\nbefore. The daringly sceptical logician has gone, and so has the\r\nimaginative dreamer for whom the world was the automatic magnifying\r\nmirror of his own childish form and environment. It has been revealed to\r\nhim that there are independent personal and impersonal forces outside\r\nhimself, forces with which he may come into a conscious and\r\nfascinatingly exciting relationship. It is a revelation of supreme\r\nimportance, and with it comes not only the complexly emotional and\r\nintellectual realization of personality, but the aptitude to enter into\r\nand assimilate the traditions of the race.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly emphasized that this is the moment, and the\r\nearliest moment, when it becomes desirable to initiate the boy or girl\r\ninto the mysteries of religion. That it is the best moment is indicated\r\nby the well-recognized fact that the immediately post-pubertal period of\r\nadolescence is the period during which, even spontaneously, the most\r\nmarked religious phenomena tend to occur.[173] Stanley Hall seems to think\r\nthat twelve is the age at which the cultivation of the religious\r\nconsciousness may begin; \"the age, signalized by the ancient Greeks as\r\nthat at which the study of what was comprehensively called music should\r\nbegin, the age at which Roman guardianship ended, at which boys are\r\nconfirmed in the modern Greek, Catholic, Lutheran and Episcopal\r\nChurches, and at which the Child Jesus entered the Temple, is as early\r\nas any child ought consciously to go about his Heavenly Father's\r\nbusiness.\"[174] But I doubt whether we can fix the age definitely by\r\nyears, nor is it indeed quite accurate to assert that so early an age as\r\ntwelve is generally accepted as the age of initiation; the Anglican\r\nChurch, for example, usually confirms at the age of fifteen. It is not\r\nage with which we ought to be concerned, but a biological epoch of\r\npsychic evolution. It is unwise to insist on any particular age, because\r\ndevelopment takes place within a considerably wide limit of years.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the introduction to religion at puberty as the\r\ninitiation into a mystery. The phrase was deliberately chosen, for it\r\nseems to me to be not a metaphor, but the expression of a truth which\r\nhas always been understood whenever religion has been a reality and not\r\na mere convention. Among savages in nearly all parts of the world the\r\nboy or girl at puberty is initiated into the mystery of manhood or of\r\nwomanhood, into the duties and the privileges of the adult members of\r\nthe tribe. The youth is taken into a solitary place, for a month or\r\nmore, he is made to suffer pain and hardship, to learn self-restraint,\r\nhe is taught the lore of the tribe as well as the elementary rules of\r\nmorality and justice; he is shown the secret things of the tribe and\r\ntheir meaning and significance, which no stranger may know. He is, in\r\nshort, enabled to find his soul, and he emerges from this discipline a\r\ntrained and responsible member of his tribe. The girl receives a\r\ncorresponding training, suited to her sex, also in solitude, at the\r\nhands of the older women. A clear and full description of a typical\r\nsavage initiation into manhood at puberty is presented by Dr. Haddon in\r\nthe fifth volume of the _Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological\r\nExpedition to Torres Straits_, and Dr. Haddon makes the comment: \"It is\r\nnot easy to conceive of more effectual means for a rapid training.\"\r\n\r\nThe ideas of remote savages concerning the proper manner of initiating\r\nyouth in the religious and other mysteries of life may seem of little\r\npersonal assistance to superiorly civilized people like ourselves. But\r\nlet us turn, therefore, to the Greeks. They also had preserved the idea\r\nand the practice of initiation into sacred mysteries, though in a\r\nsomewhat modified form because religion had ceased to be so intimately\r\nblended with all the activities of life. The Eleusinian and other\r\nmysteries were initiations into sacred knowledge and insight which, as\r\nis now recognized, involved no revelation of obscure secrets, but were\r\nmysteries in the sense that all intimate experiences of the soul, the\r\nexperiences of love quite as much as those of religion, are mysteries,\r\nnot to be lightly or publicly spoken of. In that feeling the Greek was\r\nat one with the Papuan, and it is interesting to observe that the\r\nprocedure of initiation into the Greek mysteries, as described by Theon\r\nof Smyrna and other writers, followed the same course as the pubertal\r\ninitiations of savages; there was the same preliminary purification by\r\nwater, the same element of doctrinal teaching, the same ceremonial and\r\nsymbolic rubbing with sand or charcoal or clay, the same conclusion in a\r\njoyous feast, even the same custom of wearing wreaths.\r\n\r\nIn how far the Christian sacraments were consciously moulded after the\r\nmodel of the Greek mysteries is still a disputed point;[175] but the first\r\nChristians were seeking the same spiritual initiation, and they\r\nnecessarily adopted, consciously or unconsciously, methods of procedure\r\nwhich, in essentials, were fundamentally the same as those they were\r\nalready familiar with. The early Christian Church adopted the rite of\r\nBaptism not merely as a symbol of initiation, but as an actual component\r\npart of a process of initiation; the purifying ceremony was preceded by\r\nlong preparation, and when at last completed the baptized were sometimes\r\ncrowned with garlands. When at a later period in the history of the\r\nChurch the physical part of the initiation was divorced from the\r\nspiritual part, and baptism was performed in infancy and confirmation at\r\npuberty, a fatal mistake was made, and each part of the rite largely\r\nlost its real significance.\r\n\r\nBut it still remains true that Christianity embodied in its practical\r\nsystem the ancient custom of initiating the young at puberty, and that\r\nthe custom exists in an attenuated form in all the more ancient\r\nChristian Churches. The rite of Confirmation has, however, been\r\ndevitalized, and its immense significance has been almost wholly lost.\r\nInstead of being regarded as a real initiation into the privileges and\r\nthe responsibilities of a religious communion, of an active fellowship\r\nfor the realization of a divine life on earth, it has become a mere\r\nmechanical corollary of the precedent rite of baptism, a formal\r\ncondition of participation in the Sacrament of Holy Communion. The\r\nsplendid and many-sided discipline by which the child of the savage was\r\ninitiated into the secrets of his own emotional nature and the sacred\r\ntradition of his people has been degraded into the learning of a\r\ncatechism and a few hours' perfunctory instruction in the schoolroom or\r\nin the parlour of the curate's lodgings. The vital kernel of the rite is\r\ndecayed and only the dead shell is left, while some of the Christian\r\nChurches have lost even the shell.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely probable that in no remote future the State in England\r\nwill reject as insoluble the problem of imparting religious instruction\r\nto the young in its schools, in accordance with a movement of opinion\r\nwhich is taking place in all civilized countries.[176] The support which\r\nthe Secular Education League has found in the most various quarters is\r\nwithout doubt a fact of impressive significance.[177] It is well known\r\nalso that the working classes--the people chiefly concerned in the\r\nmatter--are distinctly opposed to religious teaching in State schools.\r\nThere can be little doubt that before many years have passed, in England\r\nas elsewhere, the Churches will have to face the question of the best\r\nmethods of themselves undertaking that task of religious training which\r\nthey have sought to foist upon the State. If they are to fulfil this\r\nduty in a wise and effectual manner they must follow the guidance of\r\nbiological psychology at the point where it is at one with the teaching\r\nof their own most ancient traditions, and develop the merely formal rite\r\nof confirmation into a true initiation of the new-born soul at puberty\r\ninto the deepest secrets of life and the highest mysteries of religion.\r\n\r\nIt must, of course, be remembered that, so far as England is concerned,\r\nwe live in an empire in which there are 337 millions of people who are\r\nnot even nominally Christians,[178] and that even among the comparatively\r\nsmall proportion (about 14 per cent) who call themselves \"Christians,\" a\r\nvery large proportion are practically Secularists, and a considerable\r\nnumber avowedly so. If, however, we assume the Secularist's position,\r\nthe considerations here brought forward still retain their validity. In\r\nthe first place, the undoubtedly frequent hostility of the Freethinker\r\nto Christianity is not so much directed against vital religion as\r\nagainst a dead Church. The Freethinker is prepared to respect the\r\nChristian who by free choice and the exercise of thought has attained\r\nthe position of a Christian, but he resents the so-called Christian who\r\nis merely in the Church because he finds himself there, without any\r\neffort of his will or his intelligence. The convinced secularist feels\r\nrespect for the sincere Christian, even though it may only be in the\r\nsense that the real saint feels tenderness for the hopeless sinner. And\r\nin the second place, as I have sought to point out, the facts we are\r\nhere concerned with are far too fundamental to concern the Christian\r\nalone. They equally concern the secularist, who also is called upon to\r\nsatisfy the spiritual hunger of the adolescent youth, to furnish him\r\nwith a discipline for his entry into life, and a satisfying vision of\r\nthe universe. And if secularists have not always grasped this necessity,\r\nwe may perhaps find therein one main reason why secularism has not met\r\nwith so enormous and enthusiastic a reception as the languor and\r\nformalism of the churches seemed to render possible.\r\n\r\nIf the view here set forth is sound,--a view more and more widely held\r\nby educationists and by psychologists trained in biology,--the first\r\ntwelve years must be left untouched by all conceptions of life and the\r\nworld which transcend immediate experience, for the child whose\r\nspiritual virginity has been prematurely tainted will never be able to\r\nawake afresh to the full significance of those conceptions when the age\r\nof religion at last arrives. But are we, it may be asked, to leave the\r\nchild's restless, inquisitive, imaginative brain without any food during\r\nall those early years? By no means. Even admitting that, as it has been\r\nsaid, at the early stage religious training is the supreme art of\r\nstanding out of Nature's way, it is still not hard to find what, in this\r\nmatter, the way of Nature is. The life of the individual recapitulates\r\nthe life of the race, and there can be no better imaginative food for\r\nthe child than that which was found good in the childhood of the race.\r\nThe child who is deprived of fairy tales invents them for himself,--for\r\nhe must have them for the needs of his psychic growth just as there is\r\nreason to believe he must have sugar for his metabolic growth,--but he\r\nusually invents them badly.[179] The savage sees the world almost exactly\r\nas the civilized child sees it, as the magnified image of himself and\r\nhis own environment; but he sees it with an added poetic charm, a\r\ndelightful and accomplished inventiveness which the child is incapable\r\nof. The myths and legends of primitive peoples--for instance, those of\r\nthe British Columbian Indians, so carefully reproduced by Boas in German\r\nand Hill Tout in English--are one in their precision and their\r\nextravagance with the stories of children, but with a finer\r\ninventiveness. It was, I believe, many years ago pointed out by Ziller\r\nthat fairy-tales ought to play a very important part in the education of\r\nyoung children, and since then B. Hartmann, Stanley Hall and many others\r\nof the most conspicuous educational authorities have emphasized the same\r\npoint. Fairy tales are but the final and transformed versions of\r\nprimitive myths, creative legends, stories of old gods. In purer and\r\nless transformed versions the myths and legends of primitive peoples are\r\noften scarcely less adapted to the child's mind. Julia Gayley argues\r\nthat the legends of early Greek civilization, the most perfect of all\r\ndreams, should above all be revealed to children; the early traditions\r\nof the East and of America yield material that is scarcely less fitted\r\nfor the child's imaginative uses. Portions of the Bible, especially of\r\nGenesis, are in the strict sense fairy tales, that is legends of early\r\ngods and their deeds which have become stories. In the opinion of many\r\nthese portions of the Bible may suitably be given to children (though it\r\nis curious to observe that a Welsh Education Committee a few years ago\r\nprohibited the reading in schools of precisely the most legendary part\r\nof Genesis); but it must always be remembered, from the Christian point\r\nof view, that nothing should be given at this early age which is to be\r\nregarded as essential at a later age, for the youth turns against the\r\ntales of his childhood as he turns against its milk-foods. Some day,\r\nperhaps, it may be thought worth while to compile a Bible for childhood,\r\nnot a mere miscellaneous assortment of stories, but a collection of\r\nbooks as various in origin and nature as are the books of the\r\nHebraic-Christian Bible, so that every kind of child in all his moods\r\nand stages of growth might here find fit pasture. Children would not\r\nthen be left wholly to the mercy of the thin and frothy literature which\r\nthe contemporary press pours upon them so copiously; they would possess\r\nat least one great and essential book which, however fantastic and\r\nextravagant it might often be, would yet have sprung from the deepest\r\ninstincts of the primitive soul, and furnish answers to the most\r\ninsistent demands of primitive hearts. Such a book, even when finally\r\ndropped from the youth's or girl's hands, would still leave its vague\r\nperfume behind.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out, finally, that the fact that it is impossible to\r\nteach children even the elements of adult religion and philosophy, as\r\nwell as unwise to attempt it, by no means proves that all serious\r\nteaching is impossible in childhood. On the imaginative and spiritual\r\nside, it is true, the child is re-born and transformed during\r\nadolescence, but on the practical and concrete side his life and thought\r\nare for the most part but the regular and orderly development of the\r\nhabits he has already acquired. The elements of ethics on the one hand,\r\nas well as of natural science on the other, may alike be taught to\r\nchildren, and indeed they become a necessary part of early education, if\r\nthe imaginative side of training is to be duly balanced and\r\ncomplemented. The child as much as the adult can be taught, and is\r\nindeed apt to learn, the meaning and value of truth and honesty, of\r\njustice and pity, of kindness and courtesy; we have wrangled and worried\r\nfor so long concerning the teaching of religion in schools that we have\r\nfailed altogether to realize that these fundamental notions of morality\r\nare a far more essential part of school training. It must, however,\r\nalways be remembered that they cannot be adequately treated merely as an\r\nisolated subject of instruction, and possibly ought not to be so treated\r\nat all. As Harriet Finlay-Johnson wisely says in her _Dramatic Method of\r\nInstruction_: \"It is impossible to shut away moral teaching into a\r\ncompartment of the mind. It should be firmly and openly diffused\r\nthroughout the thoughts, to 'leaven the whole of the lump.'\" She adds\r\nthe fruitful suggestion: \"There is real need for some lessons in which\r\nthe emotions shall not be ignored. Nature study, properly treated, can\r\ntouch both senses and emotions.\"[180]\r\n\r\nThe child is indeed quite apt to acquire a precise knowledge of the\r\nnatural objects around him, of flowers and plants and to some extent of\r\nanimals, objects which to the savage also are of absorbing interest. In\r\nthis way, under wise guidance, the caprices of his imagination may be\r\nindirectly restrained and the lessons of life taught, while at the same\r\ntime he is thus being directly prepared for the serious studies which\r\nmust occupy so much of his later youth.\r\n\r\nThe child, we thus have to realize, is, from the educational point of\r\nview of social hygiene, a being of dual nature, who needs ministering to\r\non both sides. On the one hand he demands the key to an imaginative\r\nparadise which one day he must leave, bearing away with him, at the\r\nbest, only a dim and haunting memory of its beauty. On the other hand he\r\npossesses eager aptitudes on which may be built up concrete knowledge\r\nand the sense of human relationships, to serve as a firm foundation when\r\nthe period of adolescent development and discipline at length arrives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] De Quincey in his _Confessions of an Opium Eater_ referred to the\r\npower that many, perhaps most, children possess of seeing visions in the\r\ndark. The phenomenon has been carefully studied by G.L. Partridge\r\n(_Pedagogical Seminary_, April, 1898) in over 800 children. He found\r\nthat 58.5 of them aged between thirteen and sixteen could see visions or\r\nimages at night with closed eyes before falling asleep; of those aged\r\nsix the proportion was higher. There seemed to be a maximum at the age\r\nof ten, and probably another maximum at a much earlier age. Among adults\r\nthis tendency is rudimentary, and only found in a marked form in\r\nneurasthenic subjects or at moments of nervous exhaustion. See also\r\nHavelock Ellis, _The World of Dreams_, chap. II.\r\n\r\n[164] G. Stanley Hall, \"The Contents of Children's Minds on Entering\r\nSchool,\" _Pedagogical Seminary_, June, 1891.\r\n\r\n[165] \"The mother's face and voice are the first conscious objects as the\r\ninfant soul unfolds, and she soon comes to stand in the very place of\r\nGod to her child. All the religion of which the child is capable during\r\nthis by no means brief stage of its development consists of these\r\nsentiments--gratitude, trust, dependence, love, etc.--now felt only for\r\nher, which are later directed towards God. The less these are now\r\ncultivated towards the mother, who is now their only fitting if not\r\ntheir only possible object, the more feebly they will later be felt\r\ntowards God. This, too, adds greatly to the sacredness of the\r\nresponsibilities of motherhood.\" (G. Stanley Hall, _Pedagogical\r\nSeminary_, June, 1891, p. 199).\r\n\r\n[166] J. Morse, _American Journal of Religious Psychology_, 1911, p. 247.\r\n\r\n[167] Lobsien, \"Kinderideale,\" _Zeitschrift fuer Paed. Psychologie_, 1903.\r\n\r\n[168] Mr. Edmond Holmes, formerly Chief Inspector of Elementary Education\r\nin England, has an instructive remark bearing on this point in his\r\nsuggestive book, _What Is and What Might be_ (1911, p. 88): \"The first\r\nforty minutes of the morning session are given in almost every\r\nelementary school to what is called _Religious Instruction_. This goes\r\non, morning after morning, and week after week. The fact that the\r\nEnglish parent, who must himself have attended from 1500 to 2000\r\nScripture lessons in his schooldays, is not under any circumstance to be\r\ntrusted to give religious instruction to his own children, shows that\r\nthose who control the religious education of the youthful 'masses' have\r\nbut little confidence in the effects of their system on the religious\r\nlife and faith of the English people.\" Miss Harriet Finlay-Johnson, a\r\nhighly original and successful elementary school teacher, speaks (_The\r\nDramatic Method of Teaching_, 1911, p. 170) with equal disapproval of\r\nthe notion that any moral value attaches to the ordinary school\r\nexaminations in \"Scripture.\"\r\n\r\n[169] If it were not so, England, after sixty years of National Schools,\r\nought to be a devout nation of good Church people. Most of the criminals\r\nand outcasts have been taught in Church Schools. A clergyman, who points\r\nthis out to me, adds: \"I am heartily thankful that religion was never\r\nforced on me as a child. I do not think I had any religion, in the\r\nethical sense, until puberty, or any conscious realization of religion,\r\nindeed, until nineteen.\" \"The boy,\" remarks Holmes (_op. cit._, p. 100),\r\n\"who, having attended two thousand Scripture lessons, says to himself\r\nwhen he leaves school: 'If this is religion I will have no more of it,'\r\nis acting in obedience to a healthy instinct. He is to be honoured\r\nrather than blamed for having realized at last that the chaff on which\r\nhe has so long been fed is not the life-giving grain which, unknown to\r\nhimself, his inmost soul demands.\"\r\n\r\n[170] _La Nouvelle Heloise_, Part V, Letter 3. In more recent times Ellen\r\nKey remarks in a suggestive chapter on \"Religions Education\" in her\r\n_Century of the Child_: \"Nothing better shows how deeply rooted religion\r\nis in human nature than the fact that 'religious education' has not been\r\nable to tear it out.\"\r\n\r\n[171] J.S. Mill, _Letters_, Vol. II, p. 135.\r\n\r\n[172] Lancaster found (\"The Psychology and Pedagogy of Adolescence,\"\r\n_Pedagogical Seminary_, July, 1897) that among 598 individuals of both\r\nsexes in the United States, as many as 518 experienced new religious\r\nemotions between the ages of 12 and 20, only 80 having no such emotions\r\nat this period, so that more than 5 out of 6 have this experience; it is\r\nreally even more frequent, for it has no necessary tendency to fall into\r\nconventional religious moulds.\r\n\r\n[173] Professor Starbuck, in his _Psychology of Religion_, has well\r\nbrought together and clearly presented much of the evidence showing this\r\nintimate association between adolescence and religious manifestations.\r\nHe finds (Chap. III) that in females there are two tidal waves of\r\nreligious awakening, one at about 13, the other at 16, with a less\r\nsignificant period at 18; for males, after a wavelet at 12, the great\r\ntidal wave is at 16, followed by another at 18 or 19. Ruediger's results\r\nare fairly concordant (\"The Period of Mental Reconstruction,\" _American\r\nJournal of Psychology_, July, 1907); he finds that in women the average\r\nage of conversion is 14, in men it is at 13 or 14, and again at 18.\r\n\r\n[174] G. Stanley Hall, \"The Moral and Religious Training of Children and\r\nAdolescents,\" _Pedagogical Seminary_, June, 1891, p. 207. From the more\r\nnarrowly religious side the undesirability of attempting to teach\r\nreligion to children is well set forth by Florence Hayllar (_Independent\r\nReview_, Oct., 1906). She considers that thirteen is quite early enough\r\nto begin teaching children the lessons of the Gospels, for a child who\r\nacted in accordance with the Gospels would be \"aggravating,\" and would\r\ngenerally be regarded as \"an insufferable prig.\" Moreover, she points\r\nout, it is dangerous to teach young children the Christian virtues of\r\ncharity, humility, and self-denial. It is far better that they should\r\nfirst be taught the virtues of justice and courage and self-mastery, and\r\nthe more Christian virtues later. She also believes that in the case of\r\nthe clergy who are brought in contact with children a preliminary course\r\nof child-study, with the necessary physiology and psychology, should be\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\n[175] The varying opinions on this point have been fairly and clearly\r\npresented by Cheetham in his Hulsean lectures on the _Mysteries Pagan\r\nand Christian_.\r\n\r\n[176] Thus at the first Congress of Italian Women held at Rome in 1908--a\r\nvery representative Congress, by no means made up of \"feminists\" or\r\nanti-clericals, and marked by great moderation and good sense--a\r\nresolution was passed against religious teaching in primary schools,\r\nthough a subsequent resolution declared by a very large majority in\r\nfavour of teaching the history of religions in secondary schools. These\r\nresolutions caused much surprise at the time to those persons who still\r\ncherish the superstition that in matters of religion women are blindly\r\nprejudiced and unable to think for themselves.\r\n\r\n[177] See e.g. an article by Halley Stewart, President of the Secular\r\nEducation League, on \"The Policy of Secular Education,\" _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, April, 1911.\r\n\r\n[178] So far as numbers go, the dominant religion of the British Empire,\r\nthe religion of the majority, is Hinduism; Mohammedanism comes next.\r\n\r\n[179] \"Not long ago,\" says Dr. L. Guthrie (_Clinical Journal_, 7th\r\nJune, 1899), \"I heard of a lady who, in her desire that her children\r\nshould learn nothing but what was true, banished fairy tales from her\r\nnursery. But the children evolved from their own imagination fictions\r\nwhich were so appalling that she was glad to divert them with\r\nJack-the-Giant-Killer.\"\r\n\r\n[180] In his interesting study of comparative education (_The Making of\r\nCitizens_, 1902, p. 194), Mr. R.E. Hughes, a school inspector, after\r\ndiscussing the methods of settling the difficulties of religious\r\neducation in England, America, Germany, and France, reasonably\r\nconcludes: \"The solution of the religious problem of the schools of\r\nthese four peoples lies in the future, but we believe it will be found\r\nnot to be beyond human ingenuity to devise a scheme of moral and ethical\r\ntraining for little children which will be suitable. It is the moral\r\nprinciples underlying all conduct which the school should teach. Indeed,\r\nthe school, to justify its existence, dare not neglect them. It will\r\nteach them, not dogmatically or by precept, but by example, and by the\r\ncreation of a noble atmosphere around the child.\" Holmes also (_op.\r\ncit._, p. 276) insists that the teaching of patriotism and citizenship\r\nmust be informal and indirect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL HYGIENE\r\n\r\n     The New Movement for giving Sexual Instruction to Children--The\r\n     Need of such a Movement--Contradictions involved by the Ancient\r\n     Policy of Silence--Errors of the New Policy--The Need of Teaching\r\n     the Teacher--The Need of Training the Parents--And of\r\n     Scientifically equipping the Physician--Sexual Hygiene and\r\n     Society--The far-reaching Effects of Sexual Hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to doubt the vitality and the vigour of the new\r\nmovement of sexual hygiene, especially that branch of it concerned with\r\nthe instruction of children in the essential facts of life.[181] In the\r\neighteenth century the great educationist, Basedow, was almost alone\r\nwhen, by practice and by precept, he sought to establish this branch of\r\ninstruction in schools.[182] A few years ago, when the German Duerer Bund\r\noffered prizes for the best essays on the training of the young in\r\nmatters of sex, as many as five hundred papers were sent in.[183] We may\r\nsay that during the past ten years more has been done to influence\r\npopular feeling on this question than during the whole of the preceding\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWhenever we witness a sudden impulse of zeal and enthusiasm to rush into\r\na new channel, however admirable the impulse may be, we must be prepared\r\nfor many risks and perhaps even a certain amount of damage. This is,\r\nindeed, especially the case when we are concerned with a new activity in\r\nthe sphere of sex. The sexual relationships of life are so ancient and\r\nso wide, their roots ramify so complexly and run so deep, that any\r\nsudden disturbance in this soil, however well-intentioned, is certain to\r\nhave many results which were not anticipated by those responsible for\r\nit. Any movement here runs the risk of defeating its own ends, or else,\r\nin gaining them, to render impossible other ends which are of not less\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIn this matter of sexual hygiene we are faced at the outset by the fact\r\nthat the very recognition of any such branch of knowledge as \"sexual\r\nhygiene\" involves not merely a new departure, but the reversal of a\r\npolicy which has been accepted, almost without question, for centuries.\r\nAmong many primitive peoples, indeed, we know that the boy and girl at\r\npuberty are initiated with solemnity, and even a not unwholesome\r\nhardship, into the responsibilities of adult life, including those which\r\nhave reference to the duties and privileges of sex.[184] But in our own\r\ntraditions scarcely even a relic of any such custom is preserved. On the\r\ncontrary, we tacitly maintain a custom, and even a policy, of silent\r\nobscurantism. Parents and teachers have considered it a duty to say\r\nnothing and have felt justified in telling lies, or \"fairy tales,\" in\r\norder to maintain their attitude. The oncoming of puberty, with its\r\nalarming manifestations, especially in the girl, has often left them\r\nunmoved and still silent. They have taken care that our elementary\r\ntextbooks of anatomy and physiology, even when written by so independent\r\nand fearless a pioneer as Huxley, should describe the human body\r\nabsolutely as though the organs and functions of reproduction had no\r\nexistence. The instinct was not thus suppressed; all the inevitable\r\nstimulations which life furnishes to the youthful sexual impulse have\r\ncontinued in operation.[185] Sexual activities were just as liable to\r\nbreak out. They were all the more liable to break out, indeed, because\r\nfostered by ignorance, often unconscious of themselves, and not held in\r\ncheck by the restraints which knowledge and teaching might have\r\nfurnished. This, however, has seemed a matter of no concern to the\r\nguardians of youth. They have congratulated themselves if they could\r\npilot the youths, and especially the maidens, under their guardianship\r\ninto the haven of matrimony not only in apparent chastity, but in\r\nignorance of nearly everything that marriage signifies and involves,\r\nalike for the individual and the coming race.\r\n\r\nThis policy has been so firmly established that the theory of it has\r\nnever been clearly argued out. So far as it exists at all, it is a\r\ntheory that walks on two feet pointing opposite ways: sex things must\r\nnot be talked about because they are \"dirty\"; sex things must not be\r\ntalked about because they are \"sacred.\" We must leave sex things alone,\r\nthey say, because God will see to it that they manifest themselves\r\naright and work for good; we must leave sex things alone, they also say,\r\nbecause there is no department in life in which the activity of the\r\nDevil is so specially exhibited. The very same person may be guilty of\r\nthis contradiction, when varying circumstances render it convenient.\r\nSuch a confusion is, indeed, a fate liable to befall all ancient and\r\ndeeply rooted _tabus_; we see it in the _tabus_ against certain animals\r\nas foods (as the Mosaic prohibition of pork); at first the animal was\r\ntoo sacred to eat, but in time people came to think that it is too\r\ndisgusting to eat. They begin the practice for one reason, they continue\r\nit for a totally opposed reason. Reasons are such a superficial part of\r\nour lives!\r\n\r\nThus every movement of sexual hygiene necessarily clashes against an\r\nestablished convention which is itself an inharmonious clash of\r\ncontradictory notions. This is especially the case if sexual hygiene is\r\nintroduced by way of the school. It is very widely held by many who\r\naccept the arguments so ably set forth by Frau Maria Lischnewska, that\r\nthe school is not only the best way of introducing sexual hygiene, but\r\nthe only possible way, since through this channel alone is it possible\r\nto employ an antidote to the evil influences of the home and the\r\nworld.[186] Yet to teach children what some of their parents consider as\r\ntoo sacred to be taught, and others as too disgusting, and to begin this\r\nteaching at an age when the children, having already imbibed these\r\nparental notions, are old enough to be morbidly curious and prurient, is\r\nto open the way to a complicated series of social reactions which demand\r\ngreat skill to adjust.\r\n\r\nLargely, no doubt, from anxiety to counterbalance these dangers, there\r\nhas been a tendency to emphasize, or rather to over-emphasize, the moral\r\naspects of sexual hygiene. Rightly considered, indeed, it is not easy to\r\nover-value its moral significance. But in the actual teaching of such\r\nhygiene it is quite easy, and the error is often found, to make\r\nstatements and to affirm doctrines--all in the interests of good morals\r\nand with the object of exhibiting to the utmost the beneficial\r\ntendencies of this teaching--which are dubious at the best and often at\r\nvariance with actual experience. In such cases we seem to see that the\r\nsexual hygienist has indeed broken with the conventional conspiracy of\r\nsilence in these matters, but he has not broken with the conventional\r\nmorality which grew out of that ignorant silence. With the best\r\nintention in the world he sets forth, dogmatically and without\r\nqualification, ancient half-truths which to become truly moral need to\r\nbe squarely faced with their complementary half-truths. The inevitable\r\ndanger is that the pupil sooner or later grasps the one-sided\r\nexaggeration of this teaching, and the credit of the sexual hygienist is\r\ngone. Life is an art, and love, which lies at the heart of life, is an\r\nart; they are not science; they cannot be converted into clear-cut\r\nformulae and taught as the multiplication table is taught. Example here\r\ncounts for more than precept, and practice teaches more than either,\r\nprovided it is carried on in the light of precept and example. The rash\r\nand unqualified statements concerning the immense benefits of\r\ncontinence, or the awful results of self-abuse, etc., frequently found\r\nin books for young people will occur to every one. Stated with wise\r\nmoderation they would have been helpful. Pushed to harsh extravagance\r\nthey are not only useless to aid the young in their practical\r\ndifficulties, but become mischievous by the injury they inflict on\r\nover-sensitive consciences, fearful of falling short of high-strung\r\nideals. This consideration brings us, indeed, to what is perhaps the\r\nchief danger in the introduction of any teaching of sexual hygiene: the\r\nfact that our teachers are themselves untaught. Sexual hygiene in the\r\nfull sense--in so far as it concerns individual action and not the\r\nregulative or legislative action of communities--is the art of imparting\r\nsuch knowledge as is needed at successive stages by the child, the youth\r\nand maiden, the young man and woman, in order to enable them to deal\r\nrightly, and so far as possible without injury either to themselves or\r\nto others, with all those sexual events to which every one is naturally\r\nliable. To fulfil his functions adequately the master in the art of\r\nteaching sexual hygiene must answer to three requirements: (1) he must\r\nhave a sufficing knowledge of the facts of sexual psychology, sexual\r\nphysiology, and sexual pathology, knowledge which, in many important\r\nrespects, hardly existed at all until recently, and is only now\r\nbeginning to become generally accessible; (2) he must have a wise and\r\nbroad moral outlook, with a sane idealism which refrains from demanding\r\nimpossibilities, and resolutely thrusts aside not only the vulgar\r\nplatitudes of worldliness, but the equally mischievous platitudes of an\r\noutworn and insincere asceticism, for the wise sexual hygienist knows,\r\nwith Pascal, that \"he who tries to be an angel becomes a beast,\" and is\r\nless anxious to make his pupils ineffective angels than effective men\r\nand women, content to say with Browning, \"I may put forth angels'\r\npinions, once unmanned, but not before\"; (3) in addition to sound\r\nknowledge and a wise moral outlook, the sexual hygienist must possess,\r\nfinally, a genuine sympathy with the young, an insight into their\r\nsensitive shyness, a comprehension of their personal difficulties, and\r\nthe skill to speak to them simply, frankly, and humanly. If we ask\r\nourselves how many of the apostles of sexual hygiene combine these\r\nthree essential qualities, we shall probably not be able to name many,\r\nwhile we may suspect that some do not even possess one of the three\r\nqualifications. If we further consider that the work of sexual hygiene,\r\nto be carried out on a really national scale, demands the more or less\r\nactive co-operation of parents, teachers, and doctors, and that parents,\r\nteachers, and doctors are in these matters at present all alike\r\nuntrained, and usually prejudiced, we shall realize some of the dangers\r\nthrough which sexual hygiene must at first pass.\r\n\r\nIt is, I hope, unnecessary for me to say that, in thus pointing out some\r\nof the difficulties and the risks which must assail every attempt to\r\nintroduce an element of effective sexual hygiene into life, I am far\r\nfrom wishing to argue that it is better to leave things as they are.\r\nThat is impossible, not only because we are realizing that our system of\r\nincomplete silence is mischievous, but because it is based on a\r\nconfusion which contains within itself the elements of disruption. We\r\nhave to remember, however, that the creation of a new tradition cannot\r\nbe effected in a day. Before we begin to teach sexual hygiene the\r\nteachers must themselves be taught.\r\n\r\nThere are many who have insisted, and not without reason, on the right\r\nof the parent to control the education of the child. Sexual hygiene\r\nintroduces us to another right, the right of the child to control the\r\neducation of the parents. For few parents to-day are fitted to exercise\r\nthe duty of training and guiding the child in the difficult field of sex\r\nwithout preliminary education, and such education, to be real and\r\neffective, must begin at an early age in the parents' life.[187]\r\n\r\nThe school teacher, again, on whom so many rely for the initial stage in\r\nsexual hygiene, is at present often in almost exactly the same stage of\r\nignorance or prejudice in these matters as his or her pupils. The\r\nteacher has seldom been trained to impart even the most elementary\r\nscientific knowledge of the facts of sex, of reproduction, and of sexual\r\nhygiene, and is more often than not without that personal experience of\r\nlife in its various aspects which is required in order to teach wisely\r\nin such a difficult field as that of sex, even if the principle is\r\nadmitted that the teacher in class, equally whether addressing one sex\r\nor both sexes, is not called upon to go beyond the scientific, abstract,\r\nand objective aspects of sex.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty of the lack of suitable teachers is not, indeed,\r\ninsuperable. It would be largely settled, no doubt, if a wise and\r\nthorough course of sexual hygiene and puericulture formed part of the\r\ntraining of all school teachers, as, in France, Pinard has proposed for\r\nthe Normal schools for young women. Dr. W.O. Henry, in a paper read\r\nbefore the Nebraska State Medical Association in May, 1911, put forward\r\nthe proposal: \"Let each State have one or more competent physicians\r\nwhose duty it shall be to teach these things to the children in all the\r\npublic schools of the State from the time they are eight years of age.\r\nThe boys and girls should be given the instruction separately by means\r\nof charts, pictures, and stereopticon views, beginning with the lower\r\nforms of life, flowers, plants, and then closing with the organs in man.\r\nThese lectures and illustrations should be given every year to all the\r\nboys and girls separately, having those from eight to ten together at\r\none time, and those from ten to twelve, and those from over twelve to\r\nsixteen.\" Dr. Henry was evidently not aware that the principle of a\r\nspecial teacher appointed by Government to give special instruction in\r\nmatters of sex in all State schools had already been adopted in Canada,\r\nin the province of Ontario; the teacher thus appointed goes from school\r\nto school and teaches the elements of sexual physiology and anatomy, and\r\nthe duty of treating sexual matters with reverence, to classes of boys\r\nand of girls from the age of ten. The course is not compulsory, but any\r\nSchool Board may call upon the special teacher to deliver the lectures.\r\nThis appointment has met with so much approval that it is proposed to\r\nappoint further teachers on the same lines, women as well as men.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the school teacher of sex should be a\r\nphysician. For personal and particular advice on the concrete\r\ndifficulties of sex, however, as well as for the more special and\r\ndetailed hygiene of the sexual relationship and the precautions demanded\r\nby eugenics, we must call in the physician. Yet none of these things so\r\nfar enter the curriculum through which the physician passes to reach\r\nhis profession; he is often only a layman in relation to them. Even if\r\nwe are assured that these subjects form part of his scientific\r\nequipment, that fact by no means guarantees his tact, sympathy, and\r\ninsight in addressing the young, whether by general lectures or\r\nindividual interviews, both these being forms of imparting sexual\r\nhygiene for which we may properly call upon the physician, especially\r\ntowards the end of the school or college course, and at the outset of\r\nany career in the world.[188]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly we have amongst us many mothers, teachers, and physicians\r\nwho are admirably equipped to fulfil their respective parts--elementary,\r\nsecondary, and advanced--in the work of sexual hygiene. But so long as\r\nthey are few and far apart their influence is negatived, if it is not\r\neven rendered harmful.\r\n\r\nIt must often be useless for a mother to instil into her little boy\r\nrespect for his own body, reverence for the channel of motherhood\r\nthrough which he entered the world, any sense of the purity of natural\r\nfunctions or the beauty of natural organs, if outside his home the\r\nlittle boy finds that all other little boys and girls regard these\r\nthings as only an occasion for sniggering. It is idle for the teacher to\r\ndescribe plainly the scientific facts of sex as a marvellous culmination\r\nin the natural unfolding of the world if, outside the schoolroom, the\r\npupil finds that, in the newspapers and in the general conversation of\r\nadults, this sacred temple is treated as a common sewer, too filthy to\r\nbe spoken of, and that the books which contain even the most necessary\r\ndescriptions of it are liable to be condemned as \"obscene\" in the law\r\ncourts.[189] It is vain for the physician to explain to young men and\r\nwomen the subtle and terrible nature of venereal poisons, to declare the\r\nright and the duty of both partners in marriage to know, authoritatively\r\nand beforehand, the state of each other's health, or to warn them that a\r\nproper sense of responsibility towards the race must prevent some\r\nill-born persons from marrying, or at all events from procreating, if\r\nthe young man and woman find, on leaving the physician, that their\r\nacquaintances are prepared to accept all these risks, light-heartedly,\r\nin the dark, in a heedless dream from which they somehow hope there will\r\nbe no awful awakening.\r\n\r\nThe moral to which these observations point is fairly clear. Sex\r\npenetrates the whole of life. It is not a branch of mathematics, or a\r\nperiod of ancient history, which we can elect to teach, or not to teach,\r\nas may seem best to us, which if we teach we may teach as we choose, and\r\nif we neglect to teach it will never trouble us. Love and Hunger are the\r\nfoundations of life, and the impulse of sex is just as fundamental as\r\nthe impulse of nutrition. It will not remain absent because we refuse to\r\ncall for its presence, it will not depart because we find its presence\r\ninconvenient. At the most it will only change its shape, and mock at us\r\nfrom beneath masks so degraded, and sometimes so exalted, that we are no\r\nlonger able to recognize it.\r\n\r\n\"People are always writing about education,\" said Chamfort more than a\r\ncentury ago, \"and their writings have led to some valuable methods. But\r\nwhat is the use, unless side by side with the introduction of such\r\nmethods, corresponding reforms are not introduced in legislation, in\r\nreligion, in public opinion? The only object of education is to conform\r\nthe child's reason to that of the community. But if there is no\r\ncorresponding reform in the community, by training the child to reason\r\nyou are merely training him to see the absurdity of opinions and customs\r\nconsecrated by the seal of sacred authority, public or legislative, and\r\nyou are inspiring him with contempt of them.\"[190] We cannot too often\r\nmeditate on these wise words.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to attempt to introduce sexual hygiene as a subject apart,\r\nand in some respects it may be dangerous. When we touch sex we are\r\ntouching sensitive fibres which thrill through the whole of our social\r\norganism, just as the touch of love thrills through the whole of the\r\nbodily organism. Any vital reform here, any true introduction of sexual\r\nhygiene to replace our traditional policy of confused silence, affects\r\nthe whole of life or it affects nothing. It will modify our social\r\nconventions, enter our family life, transform our moral outlook, perhaps\r\nre-inspire our religion and our philosophy.\r\n\r\nThat conclusion need by no means render us pessimistic concerning the\r\nfuture of sexual hygiene, nor unduly anxious to cling to the policy of\r\nthe past. But it may induce us to be content to move slowly, to prepare\r\nour movements widely and firmly, and not to expect too much at the\r\noutset. By introducing sexual hygiene we are breaking with the tradition\r\nof the past which professed to leave the process by which the race is\r\ncarried on to Nature, to God, especially to the devil. We are claiming\r\nthat it is a matter for individual personal responsibility, deliberately\r\nexercised in the light of precise knowledge which every young man and\r\nwoman has a right, or rather a duty, to possess. That conception of\r\npersonal responsibility thus extended to the sphere of sex in the\r\nreproduction of the race may well transform life and alter the course of\r\ncivilization. It is not merely a reform in the class-room, it is a\r\nreform in the home, in the church, in the law courts, in the\r\nlegislature. If sexual hygiene means that, it means something great,\r\nthough something which can only come slowly, with difficulty, with much\r\nsearching of hearts. If, on the other hand, sexual hygiene means nothing\r\nbut the introduction of a new formal catechism, and an occasional\r\ngoody-goody perfunctory exhortation, it may be introduced at once, quite\r\neasily, without hurting anyone's feelings. But, really, it will not be\r\nworth worrying about, one way or the other.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[181] For a full discussion of the movement, see Havelock Ellis, _Studies\r\nin the Psychology of Sex_, Vol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" chaps.\r\nII and III.\r\n\r\n[182] Basedow (born at Hamburg 1723, died 1790) set forth his views on\r\nsexual education--which will seem to many somewhat radical and advanced\r\neven to-day--in his great treatise Elementarwerk (1774). His practical\r\neducational work is dealt with by Pinloche, _La Reforme de l'Education\r\nen Allemagne au Dix-huitieme Siecle_.\r\n\r\n[183] The best of these papers have been printed in a volume entitled _Am\r\nLebensquell_.\r\n\r\n[184] The elaborate and admirable initiation of boys among the natives of\r\nTorres Straits furnishes a good example of this education, and has been\r\nfully described by Dr. A.C.

VII and XII.\r\n\r\n[185] Moll in his wise and comprehensive work, _The Sexual Life of the\r\nChild_ (German ed., p. 225), lays it down emphatically that \"_we must\r\nclearly realize at the outset that the complete exclusion of sexual\r\nstimuli in the education of children is impossible_.\" He adds that the\r\ndemands made by some \"fanatics of hygiene\" would be dangerous even if\r\nthey were practicable. Games and physical exercises induce in many cases\r\na considerable degree of sexual stimulation. But this need not cause us\r\nundue alarm, nor must we thereby be persuaded to change our policy of\r\nrecommending such games and exercises.\r\n\r\n[186] See Frau Maria Lischnewska's excellent pamphlet, _Geschlechtliche\r\nBelehrung der Kinder_, first published in _Mutterschutz_, 1905, Heft 4\r\nand 5. This is perhaps the ablest statement of the argument in favour of\r\ngiving the chief place in sexual hygiene to the teacher. Frau\r\nLischnewska recognizes three factors in the movement for freeing the\r\nsexual activities from degradation: (1) medical, (2) economic, and (3)\r\nrational. But it is the last--in the broadest sense as a comprehensive\r\nprocess of enlightenment--which she regards as the chief. \"The views and\r\nsentiments of people must be changed,\" she says. \"The civilized man must\r\nlearn to gaze at this piece of Nature with pure eyes; reverence towards\r\nit must early sink into his soul. In the absence of this fundamental\r\nrenovation, medical and social measures will merely produce refined\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\n[187] \"We parents of to-day,\" as Henriette Fuerth truly says (\"Erotik und\r\nElternpflicht,\" _Am Lebensquell_, p. 11), \"have not yet attained that\r\nbeautiful naturalness out of which in these matters simplicity and\r\nfreedom grow. And however willing we may be to learn afresh, most of us\r\nhave so far lost our inward freedom from prejudice--the standpoint of\r\nthe pure to whom all things are pure--that we cannot acquire it again.\r\nWe parents of to-day have been altogether wrongly brought up. The\r\ninoculated feeling of shame still remains even after we have recognized\r\nthat shame in this connection is false.\"\r\n\r\n[188] The method of imparting a knowledge of sexual hygiene (especially in\r\nrelation to venereal diseases) at the outset of adult life has most\r\nactively been carried out in Germany and the United States. In Germany\r\nlectures by doctors to students and others on these matters are\r\nfrequently given. In the United States information and advice are spread\r\nabroad chiefly by the aid of societies. The American Society of Sanitary\r\nand Moral Prophylaxis, with which the name of Dr. Morrow is specially\r\nconnected, was organized in 1905. The Chicago Society of Social Hygiene\r\nwas established in 1906. Since then many other similar societies have\r\nsprung up under medical auspices in various American cities and states.\r\n\r\n[189] Many flagrant cases in point are set forth from the legal point of\r\nview by Theodore Schroeder, _\"Obscene\" Literature and Constitutional\r\nLaw_, New York, 1911, chap.

That method of attempting to\r\nfurther social progress is not new. It has been practised with signal\r\nlack of success for several thousand years. Therefore, if Social Hygiene\r\nis really to progress among us on sane and fundamental lines, it is\r\nnecessary for us to realize clearly the mistakes of the past. Again and\r\nagain the blind haste of over-zealous reformers has led not to\r\nprogress, but to retrogression. The excellent intentions of such social\r\nreformers have been defeated, not so much by the evils they have sought\r\nto overcome, as by their own excesses of ignorant zeal. As our knowledge\r\nof history and of psychology increases, we learn that, in dealing with\r\nhuman nature, what seems the longest way round is sometimes the shortest\r\nway home.\r\n\r\nAmong savages, and no doubt in primitive societies generally, the social\r\nreaction against injurious or even unusual acts on the part of\r\nindividuals is regulated by the binding force of custom. The ruling\r\nopinion is the opinion of all, the ruling custom is the duty for all.\r\nThe dictates of custom, even of ritual and etiquette, are stringent\r\ndictates of morality binding upon all, and the breach of any is\r\nequivalent to what we should consider a crime. The savage man is held in\r\nthe path of duty by a much more united force of public opinion than is\r\nthe civilized man. But, as Westermarck points out, in a suggestive\r\nchapter on customs and laws as the expression of moral ideas, \"custom\r\nnever covers the whole field of morality, and the uncovered space grows\r\nlarger in proportion as the moral consciousness develops.... The rule of\r\ncustom is the rule of duty at early stages of development. Only progress\r\nin culture lessens its sway.\"[191] As a community increases in size and in\r\ncultivation, growing more heterogeneous, it adheres rigidly to\r\nfundamental conceptions of right and wrong, but in less fundamental\r\nmatters its moral ideas become both more subjective and more various. If\r\na man kills another man out of love to that man's wife, all civilized\r\nsociety is of opinion that the homicide is a \"crime\" to be severely\r\npunished; but if the man should make love to the wife without killing\r\nthe husband, then, although in some savage societies the act would still\r\nhave been a \"crime,\" in a civilized society it would usually be regarded\r\nas more properly a case for civil action, not for criminal action; while\r\nshould it come to be known that the wife had from the first been in love\r\nwith the man, and was married by compulsion to a husband who had\r\nbrutally ill-used her, then a very considerable section of the civilized\r\ncommunity would actually transfer their sympathies to the offending\r\ncouple and look upon the husband as the real offender.\r\n\r\nThis is why the vestigial relics of the ancient ecclesiastical view of\r\nadultery as a \"crime\" are no longer supported by public opinion;[192] they\r\nare no longer enforced, or else the penalty is reduced to ridiculous\r\ndimensions (as in France, where a fine of a few francs may be imposed),\r\nand there is a general inclination to abolish them altogether. Penalties\r\nfor adultery are not nowadays enacted afresh, except in the United\r\nStates, where medieval regulations are enabled to survive through the\r\nstrength of the Puritan tradition. Thus in the State of New York a law\r\nwas passed in 1907 rendering any person guilty of adultery punishable by\r\nsix months' imprisonment, or a heavy fine, or both. The law was largely\r\ndue to agitation by the National Christian League for the Promotion of\r\nPurity; it was supposed the law would act to prevent adultery. Less than\r\nthree months after the Act became law, lawyers reached the conclusion\r\nthat it was a dead letter. During the two years after its enactment,\r\nnotwithstanding the large number of divorces, only three persons were\r\nsent to prison, for a few days, under this Act, and only four fined a\r\nsmall sum. The Committee of Fourteen state that it is \"of practically no\r\neffect,\" and add: \"The preventive values of this statute cannot be\r\ndetermined, but, judging from the prosecutions, it has proved an\r\nineffective weapon against immorality, and has practically no effect\r\nupon commercialized vice.\"[193] When such laws remain on the Statute Book\r\nas relics of practically medieval days they deserve a certain respect,\r\neven if it is impossible to enforce them; to re-enact them in modern\r\ntimes is a gratuitous method of bringing law into contempt.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that all such cases affecting morals are not only altered by\r\ncircumstances, and by consideration of the psychic state of the\r\nindividual, but that in regard to them different sections of the\r\ncommunity hold widely different views. The sanctions of the criminal law\r\nto be firm and unshakeable must be capable of literal interpretation\r\nand of unfailing execution, and in that interpretation and execution be\r\naccepted as just by the whole community. But as soon as law enters the\r\nsphere of morals this becomes impossible; law loses all its certainty\r\nand all the reverence that rightly belongs to it. It no longer voices\r\nthe conscience of the whole community; it tends to be merely an\r\nexpression of the feelings of a small upper-class social circle; the\r\nfeelings and the habits and the necessities of the mass of the\r\npopulation are altogether ignored.[194] Nor are such legislative\r\nincursions into the sphere of morals any more satisfactory from the\r\npoint of view of the class which is responsible for them. It very soon\r\nbegins to be felt that, as Hagen puts it, \"the formulas of penal law are\r\nstiff and clumsy instruments which can only in the rarest instance serve\r\nto disentangle the delicate and manifoldly interwoven threads of the\r\nhuman soul, and decide what is just and what unjust. Formulas are\r\nadopted for simple, uncomplicated, rough everyday cases. Only in such\r\ncases do they achieve the conquest of justice over injustice.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that no sharp line divides criminal acts from merely immoral\r\nacts, and the latter tend to be indirectly, even when not directly,\r\nanti-social. It would be highly convenient if we could draw a sharp\r\ndistinction between major anti-social acts, which may properly be\r\ndescribed as \"crime,\" and justly be pursued with the full rigour of the\r\nlaw, and minor anti-social acts, which may be left to the varying\r\nreaction of the social environments since they cannot properly be\r\nvisited by the criminal law.[195] Such a distinction exists, but it cannot\r\nbe made sharply because there are a large number of intermediate\r\nanti-social acts which some sections of the community regard as major,\r\nwhile others regard them as minor, or even, in some cases, as not\r\nanti-social at all. The only convenient test we can apply is the\r\nstrength of the social reaction--provided we are dealing with an act\r\nwhich is definitely anti-social, injuring recognized rights, and not\r\nmerely an unusual or disgusting act.[196] When an anti-social act meets\r\nwith a reaction of social indignation which is fairly universal and\r\npermanent, it may be regarded as a crime coming under the jurisdiction\r\nof the law. If opinion varies, if a considerable section of the\r\ncommunity revolt against the punishment of the alleged anti-social act,\r\nthen we are not entitled to dignify it with the appellation of \"crime.\"\r\nThis is not an altogether sure or satisfactory criterion because there\r\nare frequently times and places, especially under the stimulation of\r\nsome particular occurrence evoking an outburst of increased public\r\nemotion, when a section of the community succeeds by its noisy vigour in\r\ncreating the impression that it voices the universal will. But, on the\r\nwhole, it works out justly. Ethical standards differ in different places\r\nat different times. They are, indeed, always changing. Therefore, in\r\nregard to all matters which belong to the sphere of what we commonly\r\ncall morals, there are in every community some who approve of a given\r\nact, others who disapprove of it, yet others who regard it with\r\nindifference. In such a shifting sphere we cannot legislate with the\r\ncertainty of carrying the whole community with us, nor can we properly\r\nintroduce the word \"crime,\" which ought to indicate only an action of so\r\ngravely anti-social nature that there can be no possibility of doubt\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, important to understand the marked national differences\r\nin the reaction to these slightly or dubiously anti-social acts, for\r\nsuch differences rest on ancient tradition, and are to some extent the\r\nexpression of the genius of a people, though they are not the absolutely\r\nimmutable product of racial constitution, and, within limits, they\r\nundergo transformation. It thus happens that acts which in some\r\ncountries are pursued by the law and punished as crime, are in other\r\ncountries untouched by the law, and left to the social reaction of the\r\ncommunity. It becomes, therefore, of some importance to compare national\r\ndifferences in the attitude towards immorality, to find out whether the\r\nattempt to repress it directly, by law, is more effective, or less\r\neffective, than the method of leaving it to social reaction.\r\n\r\nIn many respects France and Germany present a remarkable contrast in\r\ntheir respective methods of dealing with immorality. The contrast has\r\nonly existed since the sweeping legal reforms which followed the\r\nRevolution in France. In old France the laws against sexual and\r\nreligious offences were extremely severe, involving in some cases death\r\nat the stake, and even during the eighteenth century this extreme\r\npenalty of the law was sometimes carried out. The police were active,\r\ntheir methods of investigation elaborate and thorough, yet the rigour of\r\nthe law and the energy of the police signally failed to suppress\r\nirreligion and immorality in eighteenth-century France. The Revolution,\r\nby popularizing the opinions of the more enlightened men of the time,\r\nand by giving to the popular voice an authority it had never possessed\r\nbefore, remoulded the antiquated ecclesiastical laws in accordance with\r\nthe ideas of the average modern man. In 1791 nearly all the ancient laws\r\nagainst immorality, which had proved so ineffectual, were flung away,\r\nand when in 1810 Napoleon established the great penal code which bears\r\nhis name, he was careful to limit to a minimum the moral offences of\r\nwhich the law was empowered to take cognisances, and--acting certainly\r\nin accordance with deeply rooted instincts of the French people--he\r\navoided any useless or dangerous interference with private life and the\r\nfreedom of the individual. The penal code in France remains\r\nsubstantially the same to-day, while the other countries which have\r\nconstructed their codes on the French model have shown similar\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, and more especially in Prussia, which now dominates German\r\nopinion, a very different tendency prevails. The German feels nothing of\r\nthat sensitive jealousy with which the French seek to guard private life\r\nand the rights of the individual. He tolerates a police system which, as\r\nFuld has pointed out, is the most military police system in the world,\r\nand he makes little complaint of the indiscriminating thoroughness, even\r\nharshness, with which it exercises its functions. \"The North German,\" as\r\na German lawyer puts it, \"gazes with sacred respect on every State\r\nauthority, and on every official, especially on executive and police\r\nfunctionaries; he complacently accepts police inquisition into his\r\nprivate life, and the regulation of his behaviour by law and police\r\naffects his impulse of freedom in a relatively slight manner. Hence the\r\nlaw-maker's interference with his private life seems to him a customary\r\nand not too injurious encroachment on his individuality.\"[197] It thus\r\ncomes about that a great many acts, of for the most part unquestioned\r\nimmoral character--such as incest, the procuring of women for immoral\r\npurposes, and acts of a homosexual character--which, when adults are\r\nalone concerned, the French leave to be dealt with by the social\r\nreaction, are in Germany directly dealt with by the law. These things\r\nand the like are viewed in France with fully as much detestation as in\r\nGermany, but while the German considers that that detestation is itself\r\na reason for inflicting a legal penalty on the detested act, the\r\nFrenchman considers that to inflict a punishment upon such acts by law\r\nis an inadmissible interference of the State in private affairs, and an\r\nunnecessary interference since the social reaction is quite adequate. In\r\nGermany, Dr. Wilhelm points out, a man who allows his daughter's\r\n_fiance_ to stay overnight in his house with her is liable to be dragged\r\nbefore the police court and sent to prison for procuring immorality;[198]\r\nto a Frenchman this is a shocking and inconceivable insult to private\r\nrights.[199] So also with the German legal attitude towards sexual\r\ninversion. The German method of dragging private scandals into the\r\nglare of day and investigating them at interminable length in the law\r\ncourts is a perpetual source of astonishment to Frenchmen. They point\r\nout that not only does this method defeat its own end by concentrating\r\nattention on the abnormal practices it attacks, but it adds dignity to\r\nthem; a certain small section of the community justifies and upholds\r\nthese practices, but while in France this section has no reason to come\r\nprominently before the public since it has no grievances demanding\r\nredress, in Germany the existence of a cause to advocate in the name of\r\njustice has produced a serious and imposing body of literature which has\r\nno parallel in France.[200] Thus, as Wilhelm points out, we find exactly\r\nopposite methods adopted in Germany and France to obtain the same ends:\r\n\"In Germany, punishment on account of alleged injury to general\r\ninterests; in France absence of punishment in order to avoid injury to\r\ngeneral interests; in Germany the police baton is called for in order to\r\nward off threatened injury, while in France it is feared that the use of\r\nthe police baton will itself cause the injury.\"\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises: Which method is the more effective?\r\nWilhelm finds that these differences in national attitude towards\r\nimmorality have not by any means rendered immorality more prevalent in\r\nFrance than in Germany; on the contrary, though extra-conjugal\r\nintercourse is in Germany almost a crime, sexual offences against\r\nchildren are far more prevalent than in France, while family life is at\r\nleast as stable in France as in Germany, and more intimate. \"The freer\r\nway of regarding sexual matters and its results in legislation have, as\r\ncompared to Germany, in no respect led to more immoral conditions,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, it has been the reason why the vigorous\r\nagitation which we find in Germany for certain legal reforms in respect\r\nto sexuality are quite unknown.\"\r\n\r\nIt is forgotten, in Germany and in some other countries, sometimes even\r\nin France, that to bring immorality within reach of the arm of the law\r\nis not necessarily by any means to make the actual penalty, in the\r\nlargest sense of the term, more severe. So long as he retains the good\r\nopinion of his fellows, imprisonment is no injury to a man; it has\r\nhappened to some of our most distinguished and respected public men. The\r\nbad opinion of his fellows, even when the law is powerless to touch him,\r\nis often an irretrievable injury to a man. We do not fortify the social\r\nreaction, in most matters, when we attempt to give it a legal sanction;\r\nwe do not even need to fortify it, for it is sometimes harsher and more\r\nsevere than the law, overlooking or not knowing all the extenuating\r\ncircumstances. In France, as in England, the force of social opinion,\r\nindependently of the law, is exceedingly and perhaps excessively\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nIn England, however, we see an attitude towards immorality which differs\r\nalike from the French attitude and the German attitude, though it has\r\npoints of contact with both. The distinctive feature of the Englishman's\r\nattitude is his spirit of extreme individualism (which distinguishes him\r\nfrom the German) combined with the religious nature of his moral fervour\r\n(which distinguishes him from the Frenchman), both being veiled by a shy\r\nprudery (which distinguishes him alike from the Frenchman and the\r\nGerman). The Englishman's reverence for the individual's rights goes\r\nbeyond the Frenchman's, for in France there is a tendency to subordinate\r\nthe individual to the family, and in England the interests of the\r\nindividual predominate. But while in France the laws have been\r\nre-moulded to the national temperament, this has not been the case to\r\nanything like the same extent in England, where in modern times no great\r\nrevolution has occurred to shake off laws which still by their\r\nantiquity, rather than by their reasonableness, retain the reverence of\r\nthe people. Thus it comes about that, on the legal side the English\r\nattitude towards immorality in many respects resembles the German\r\nattitude. Yet undoubtedly the most fundamental element in the English\r\nattitude is the instinct for personal freedom, and even the religious\r\nfervour of the moral impulse has strengthened the individualistic\r\nelement.[201] We see this clearly in the fact that England has even gone\r\nbeyond France in rejecting the control of prostitutes. The French are\r\nstriving to abolish such control, but in England where it was never\r\nextensively established it has long been abolished, leaving only a few\r\nfaint traces behind. It is abhorrent to the English mind that even the\r\nmost degraded specimens of humanity should be compulsorily deprived of\r\nrights over their own persons, even when it is claimed that the\r\ndeprivation of such rights might be for the benefit of the community. In\r\nno country, perhaps, is the prostitute so free to parade the streets in\r\nthe exercise of her profession as in England, and in no country is\r\npublic opinion so intolerant of even the suspicion of a mistake by the\r\npolice in the exercise of that very limited control over prostitutes\r\nwhich they possess. The freedom of the prostitute in England is further\r\nguaranteed by the very fervour of English religious feeling; for active\r\ninterference with prostitutes involves regulation of prostitution, and\r\nthat implies a national recognition of prostitution which to a very\r\nlarge section of the English people would be altogether repellant. Thus\r\nEnglish love of freedom and English love of God combine to protect the\r\nprostitute. It has to be added that this result is by no means, as some\r\nhave imagined, hostile to morality. It is the opinion of many foreign\r\nobservers that in this matter London, for all its freedom, compares\r\nfavourably with many other large cities where prostitution is severely\r\nregulated by the police and so far as possible concealed. For the police\r\ncan never become the agents of any morality of the heart, and all the\r\nrepression in the world can only touch the surface of life.\r\n\r\nThe English attitude, again, is characteristically seen in the method of\r\ndealing with homosexual practices and other similar sexual aberrations.\r\nHere, legally, England is closer to Germany than to modern France. No\r\ncountry in the world, it is often said, has preserved by tradition and\r\neven maintained by recent accretion such severe penalties against\r\nhomosexual offences as England. Yet, unlike the Germans, the English do\r\nnot actively prosecute in these cases and are usually content to leave\r\nthe law in abeyance, so long as public order and decency are reasonably\r\nmaintained. English people, like the French people, are by no means\r\nimpressed by the advantages of the German system by which purely private\r\nscandals are made public scandals, to be set forth day after day in all\r\ntheir details before the court, and discussed excitedly by the whole\r\npopulation. Yet the English law in this matter is still very widely\r\nupheld. There are very many English people who think that the fact that\r\nhomosexuality is disgusting to most people is a reason for punishing it\r\nwith extreme severity. Yet disgust is a matter of taste, we cannot\r\nproperly impart it into our laws; a disgusting person is not necessarily\r\na criminal person, or we shall have to enact that many inmates of our\r\nhospitals and lunatic asylums be hanged. There is thus a fundamental\r\ninconsistency in the English method of dealing with immorality; it is\r\nmade up of opposite views, some of them extreme in contrary directions.\r\nBut by virtue of the national tendency to compromise, these conflicting\r\ntendencies work in a fairly harmonious manner. The result is that the\r\ngeneral state of English morality--notwithstanding, and perhaps partly\r\nby reason of, its prudish anxiety to leave unpleasant matters alone--is\r\nat least as satisfactory as that of countries where much more logical\r\nand thorough methods are in favour.\r\n\r\nIn the United States we see yet another attitude towards immorality. It\r\nis, indeed, related to the English attitude, necessarily so, since the\r\nmost ancient and fundamental element of it was carried over to America\r\nby the English Puritans, who cherished in the extreme form alike the\r\nEnglish passion for individualism and the English fervour of religious\r\nidealism. These germs have been too potent for destruction even under\r\nall the new influences of American life. But they are not altogether in\r\nharmony with those influences, and the result has been that the American\r\nattitude towards immorality has sometimes looked rather like a\r\ncaricature of the English method. The influx of a vast and racially\r\nconfused population with the over-rapid development of urbanization\r\nwhich has necessarily followed, opens an immense field for idealistic\r\nindividualism to attempt reforms. But this individualism has not been\r\nheld in check by the English spirit of compromise, which is not a part\r\nof Puritanism, and it has thus tended alike to excess and to impotence.\r\nThis result is brought about partly by facilities for individualistic\r\nlegislation not voicing the tendencies of the whole population, and\r\ntherefore fatally condemned to sterility, and partly by the fact that in\r\na new and rapidly developed civilization it is impossible to secure an\r\narmy of functionaries who may be trusted to deal with the regulation of\r\ndelicate and complex moral questions in regard to which the community\r\nis not really agreed. The American police are generally admitted to be\r\nopen with special frequency to the charge of ineffectiveness and\r\nvenality. It is not so often realized that these defects are fostered by\r\nthe impossible nature of the tasks which are imposed on the American\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the matter has been very clearly set forth by Dr. Fuld,\r\nof Columbia University, in his able and thorough book on police\r\nadministration.[202] He shows that, though the American police system as a\r\nsystem has defects which need to be remedied, it is not true that the\r\nindividual members of the American police forces are inferior to those\r\nof other countries; on the contrary, they are, in some respects,\r\nsuperior; it is not a large proportion which sells the right to break\r\nthe law.[203] Their most serious defects are due to the impracticable laws\r\nand regulations made by inexperienced legislators. These laws and\r\nordinances in many cases cannot possibly be enforced, and the weak\r\npolice officers accept money from the citizen for not enforcing rules\r\nwhich in any case they could not enforce. \"The American police forces,\"\r\nsays Fuld, \"have been corrupted almost solely by the statutes.... The\r\nreal blame attaches not to the policeman who accepts a bribe temptingly\r\noffered him, nor to the bribe-giver who seeks by giving a bribe to make\r\nthe best possible business arrangement, but rather to the law, which by\r\ngiving the police a large and uncontrolled discretion in the enforcement\r\nof the law places a premium upon bribe-giving and bribe-taking.\" This\r\nstate of things is rendered possible by the fact that the duties of the\r\npolice are not confined to matters affecting crime and public\r\norder--matters which the whole community consider essential, and in\r\nregard to which any police negligence is counted a serious charge--but\r\nare extended to unessential matters which a considerable section of the\r\ncommunity, including many of the police themselves, view with complete\r\nindifference. It is impossible to regard seriously a conspiracy to\r\ndefeat laws which a large proportion of citizens regard as unnecessary\r\nor even foolish. It thus unfortunately comes about that the charge\r\nbrought against the American police that \"it sells the right to break\r\nthe law\" has not the same grave significance which it would have in most\r\ncountries, for the rights purchased in America may in most countries be\r\nobtained without purchase. \"An act ought to be made criminal,\" as Fuld\r\nrightly lays down, \"only when it is socially expedient to punish its\r\ncriminality.... The American people, or at least the American\r\nlegislators, do not make this clear distinction between vice and crime.\r\nThere seems to be a feeling in America that unless a vice is made a\r\ncrime, the State countenances the vice and becomes a party to its\r\ncommission. There are unfortunately a large number of men in the\r\ncommunity who believe that they have satisfied the demands made upon\r\nthem to lead a virtuous life by incorporating into some statute the\r\ncondemnation of a particular vicious act as a crime.\"[204] This special\r\ncharacteristic of American laws, with its failure to distinguish between\r\nvice and crime, is clearly a legacy of the early Puritans. The Puritans\r\ncarried over to New England independent autonomous laws of morality, and\r\nwere contemptuous of external law. The sturdy pioneers of the first\r\ngeneration were faithful to that attitude, and were not even guilty of\r\npunishing witches. But, when the opportunity came, their descendants\r\ncould not resist the temptation to erect an external law of morals, and,\r\nlike the Calvinists of Geneva, they set up an inquisition backed by the\r\nsecular arm. It was not until the days of Emerson that American\r\nPuritanism regained autonomous freedom and moved in the same air as\r\nMilton. But in the meantime the mischief had been done. Even to-day an\r\ninquisition of the mails has been established in the United States. It\r\nis said to be unconstitutional, and one can well believe that that is\r\nso, but none the less it flourishes under the protection of what a\r\nfamous American has called \"the never-ending audacity of elected\r\npersons.\" But to allow subordinate officials to masquerade in the Postal\r\nDepartment as familiars of the inquisition, in the supposed interests of\r\npublic morals, is a dangerous policy.[205] Its deadening influence on\r\nnational life cannot fail sooner or later to be realized by Americans.\r\nTo moralize by statute is idle and unsatisfactory enough; but it is\r\nworse to attempt to moralize by the arbitrary dicta of minor government\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the methods which find favour in some parts\r\nof the United States for dealing with the trade in alcoholic liquors.\r\nAlcohol is, on the one hand, a poison; on the other hand, it is the\r\nbasis of the national drinks of every civilized country. Every state has\r\nfelt called upon to regulate its sale to more or less extent, in such a\r\nway that (1) in the interests of public health alcohol may not be too\r\neasily or too cheaply obtainable, that (2) the restraints on its sale\r\nmay be a source of revenue to the State, and that (3) at the same time\r\nthis regulation of the sale may not be a vexatious and useless attempt\r\nto interfere unduly with national customs. States have sought to attain\r\nthese ends in various ways. The sale of alcohol may be made a State\r\nmonopoly, as in Russia, or, again, it may be carried on under\r\ndisinterested municipal or other control, as by the Gothenburg system of\r\nSweden or the Samlag system of Norway.[206] In England the easier and more\r\nusual plan is adopted of heavily taxing the sale, with, in addition,\r\nvarious minor methods for restraining the sale of alcoholic drinks and\r\nattempting to improve the conditions under which they are sold.\r\n\r\nIn France an ingenious method of influencing the sale of alcohol has\r\nlately been adopted, in the interests of public health, which has proved\r\ncompletely successful. The French national drink is light wine, which\r\nmay be procured in abundance, of excellent and wholesome quality and\r\nvery cheaply, provided it is not heavily taxed. But of recent years\r\nthere has been a tendency in France to consume in large quantity the\r\nheavy alcoholic spirits, often of a specially deleterious kind. The plan\r\nhas been adopted of placing a very high duty on distilled beverages and\r\nreducing the duty on the light wines, as well as beer, so that a\r\nwholesome and genuine wine can be supplied to the consumer at as low a\r\nprice as beer. As a result the French consumer has shown a preference\r\nfor the cheap and wholesome wine which is really his national drink, and\r\nthere is an enormous fall in the consumption of spirits. Whereas\r\nformerly the consumption of brandy in French towns amounted to seven or\r\neight litres of absolute alcohol per head, it has now fallen in the\r\nlarge towns to 4.23 litres.[207]\r\n\r\nIn America, however, there is a tendency to deal with the sale of\r\nalcohol totally opposed to that which nearly everywhere prevails in\r\nEurope. When in Europe a man abandons the use of alcohol he makes no\r\ndemand on his fellow men to follow his example, or, if he does, he is\r\nusually content to employ moral suasion to gain this end. But in the\r\nUnited States, where there is no single national drink, a large number\r\nof people have abandoned the use of alcohol, and have persuaded\r\nthemselves that its use by other people is a vice, for it is not\r\nuniversally recognized that--\"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to\r\nlive, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.\" Moreover, as\r\nin the United States the medieval confusion between vice and crime still\r\nsubsists among a section of the population, being a part of the national\r\ntradition, it became easy to regard the drinking of alcohol as a crime\r\nand to make it punishable. Hence we have \"Prohibition,\" which has\r\nprevailed in various States of the Union and is especially associated\r\nwith Maine, where it was established in a crude form so long ago as 1846\r\nand (except for a brief interval between 1856 and 1858) has prevailed\r\nuntil to-day. The law has never been effective. It has been made more\r\nand more stringent; the wildest excuses of arbitrary administration have\r\nbeen committed; scandals have constantly occurred; officials of iron\r\nwill and determination have perished in the faith that if only they put\r\nenough energy into the task the law might, after all, be at last\r\nenforced. It was all in vain. It has always been easy in the cities of\r\nMaine for those to obtain alcohol who wished to obtain it. Finally, in\r\n1911, by a direct Referendum, the majority by which the people of Maine\r\nare maintaining Prohibition has been brought down to 700 in a total poll\r\nof 120,000, while all the large towns have voted for the repeal of\r\nProhibition by enormous majorities. The people of Maine are evidently\r\nbecoming dimly conscious that it is worse than useless to make laws\r\nwhich no human power can enforce. \"The result of the vote,\" writes Mr.\r\nArthur Sherwell, an English social Reformer, not himself opposed to\r\ntemperance legislation, \"from every point of view, and not least from\r\nthe point of view of temperance, is eminently unsatisfactory, and it\r\nunquestionably creates a position of great difficulty and embarrassment\r\nfor the authorities. A majority of 700 in a total poll of 120,000 is\r\nclearly not a sufficient mandate for a drastic law which previous\r\nexperience has conclusively shown cannot be enforced successfully in the\r\nurban districts of the State.\" Successful enforcement of prohibition on\r\na State basis would appear to be hopeless. The history of Prohibition in\r\nMaine will for ever form an eloquent proof of the mischief which comes\r\nwhen the ancient ecclesiastical failure to distinguish between the\r\nsphere of morals and the sphere of law is perpetuated under the\r\nconditions of modern life. The attempt to force men to render unto Caesar\r\nthe things which are God's must always end thus.\r\n\r\nIn these matters we witness in America the survival of an ancient\r\ntradition. The early Puritans were individualists, it is true, but their\r\nindividualism took a theocratic form, and, in the name of God, they\r\nlooked upon crimes and vices equally and indistinguishably as sins. We\r\nsee exactly the same point of view in the Penitentials of the ninth\r\ncentury, which were ecclesiastical codes dealing, exactly in the same\r\nspirit and in the same way, with crime and with vice, recognizing\r\nnothing but a certain difference in degree between murder and\r\nmasturbation. In the ninth century, and even much later, in Calvin's\r\nGeneva and Cotton Mather's New England, it was possible to carry into\r\npractice this theocratic conception of the unity of vices and crimes and\r\nthe punishment as sins of both alike, for the community generally\r\naccepted that point of view. But that is very far from being the case in\r\nthe United States of to-day. The result is that in America in this\r\nrespect we find a condition of things analogous to that which existed in\r\nFrance, before the Revolution remoulded the laws in accordance with the\r\ntemperament of the nation. Laws and regulations of the medieval kind,\r\nfor the moral ordering of the smallest details of life, are still\r\nenacted in America, but they are regarded with growing contempt by the\r\ncommunity and even by the administrators of the laws. It is realized\r\nthat such minute inquisition into the citizen's private life can only be\r\neffectively carried out where the citizen himself recognizes the divine\r\nright of the inquisitor. But the theocratic conception of life no longer\r\ncorresponds to American ideas or American customs; this minute moral\r\nlegislation rests on a basis which in the course of centuries has become\r\nrotten. Thus it has come about that nowhere in the world is there so\r\ngreat an anxiety to place the moral regulation of social affairs in the\r\nhands of the police; nowhere are the police more incapable of carrying\r\nout such regulation.\r\n\r\nWhen we thus bear in mind the historical aspect of the matter we can\r\nunderstand how it has come about that the individualistic idealist in\r\nAmerica has been much more resolute than in England to effect reforms,\r\nmuch more determined that they shall be very thorough and extreme\r\nreforms, and, especially, much more eager to embody his moral\r\naspirations in legal statutes. But his tasks are bigger than in England,\r\nbecause of the vast, unstable, heterogeneous and crude population he has\r\nto deal with, and because, at the same time, he has no firmly\r\nestablished centralized and reliable police instrument whereby to effect\r\nhis reforms. The fiery American moral idealist is determined to set out\r\nfor the Kingdom of Heaven at once, but every steed he mounts proves\r\nbroken-winded, and speedily drops down by the wayside. Don Quixote sets\r\nthe lance at rest and digs his spurs into Rosinante's flanks, but he\r\nfails to realize that, in our modern world, he will never bear him\r\nanywhere near the foe.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to see a totally different national method of regarding\r\nimmorality we may turn to Russia. Here also we find idealism at work,\r\nbut it is not the same kind of idealism, since, far from desiring to\r\nexpress itself by force, its essential basis is an absolute disbelief in\r\nforce. Russia, like France, has inherited from an ancient ecclesiastical\r\ndomination an extremely severe code of regulations against immorality\r\nand all sexual aberrations, but, unlike France, it has not cast them off\r\nin order to mould the laws in accordance with national temperament. The\r\nessence of the Russian attitude in these matters is a sympathy with the\r\nindividual which is stronger than any antipathy aroused by his immoral\r\nacts; his act is a misfortune rather than a sin or a crime. We may\r\nobserve this attitude in the kindly and helpful fashion in which the\r\nRussian assists along the streets his fellow-man who has drunk too much\r\nvodka, and, on a higher plane, we see the same spirit of forgiving human\r\ntenderness in the Russian novelists, most clearly in the greatest and\r\nmost typically national, in Dostoieffsky and in Tolstoy. The harsh\r\nrigidity of the old Russian laws had not the slightest influence, either\r\nin changing this national attitude or in diminishing the prevalence, at\r\nthe very least as great as elsewhere, of sexual laxity or sexual\r\naberration. Nowadays, as Russia attains national self-consciousness,\r\nthese laws against immorality are being slowly remoulded in accordance\r\nwith the national temperament, and in some respects--as in its attitude\r\ntowards homosexuality and the introduction in 1907 of what is\r\npractically divorce by mutual consent--they allow a freedom and latitude\r\nscarcely equalled in any other country.[208]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there is, within certain limits, mutual action and reaction\r\nin these matters among nations. Thus the influence of France has led to\r\nthe abolition of the penalty against homosexual practices in many\r\ncountries, notably Holland, Spain, Portugal, and, more recently, Italy,\r\nwhile even in Germany there is a strong and influential party, among\r\nlegal as well as medical authorities, in favour of taking the same step.\r\nOn the other hand, France has in some matters of detail departed from\r\nher general principle in these matters, and has, for instance--without\r\ndoubt in an altogether justifiable manner--taken part in the\r\ninternational movement against what is called the white slave trade.\r\nThis mutual reaction of nations is well recognized by the more alert and\r\nprogressive minds in every country, jealous of any undue interference\r\nwith liberty. When, for instance, a Bill is introduced in the English\r\nParliament for promoting inquisitorial and vexatious interference with\r\nmatters that are not within the sphere of legislation it is eagerly\r\ndiscussed in Germany before even its existence is known to most people\r\nin England, not so much out of interest in English Affairs as from a\r\nsensitive dread that English example may affect German legislation.[209]\r\n\r\nNot only, indeed, have we to recognize the existence of these clearly\r\nmarked and profound differences in legislative reaction to immorality.\r\nWe have also to realize that at different periods there are general\r\nmovements, to some extent overpassing national bounds, of rise and of\r\nfall in this reaction.\r\n\r\nA sudden impulse seizes on a community, and spreads to other\r\ncommunities, to attempt to suppress some form of immorality by law. Such\r\nattempts, as we know, have always ended in failure or worse than\r\nfailure, for laws against immorality are either not carried out, or, if\r\nthey are carried out, it is at once realized that new evils are created\r\nworse than the original evils, and the laws speedily fall into abeyance\r\nor are repealed. That has been repeatedly seen, and is well illustrated\r\nby the history of prostitution, a sexual manifestation which for two\r\nthousand years all sorts of persons in authority have sought to suppress\r\noff-hand by law or by administrative fiat. From the time when\r\nChristianity gained full political power, prostitution has again and\r\nagain been prohibited, under the severest penalties, but always in vain.\r\nThe mightiest emperors--Theodosius, Valentinian, Justinian, Karl the\r\nGreat, St. Louis, Frederick Barbarossa--all had occasion to discover\r\nthat might was here in vain, and worse than in vain, that they could not\r\nalways obey their own moral ordinances, still less coerce their subjects\r\ninto doing so, and that even so far as, on the surface, they were\r\nsuccessful they produced results more pernicious than the evils they\r\nsought to suppress. The best known and one of the most vigorous of these\r\nattempts was that of the Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna; but all the\r\ncruelty and injustice of that energetic effort, and all the stringent,\r\nridiculous, and brutal regulations it involved--its prohibition of short\r\ndresses, its inspection of billiard-rooms, its handcuffing of\r\nwaitresses, its whippings and its tortures--proved useless and worse\r\nthan useless, and were soon quietly dropped.[210] No more fortunate were\r\nmore recent municipal attempts in England and America (Portsmouth,\r\nPittsburgh, New York, etc.) to suppress prostitution off-hand; for the\r\nmost part they collapsed even in a few days.\r\n\r\nThe history of the legal attempts to suppress homosexuality shows the\r\nsame results. It may even be said to show more, for when the laws\r\nagainst homosexuality are relaxed or abolished, homosexuality becomes,\r\nnot perhaps less prevalent (in so far as it is a congenital anomaly we\r\ncannot expect its prevalence to be influenced by law), but certainly\r\nless conspicuous and ostentatious. In France, under the Bourbons, the\r\nsexual invert was a sacrilegious criminal who could legally be burnt at\r\nthe stake, but homosexuality flourished openly in the highest circles,\r\nand some of the kings were themselves notoriously inverted. Since the\r\nCode Napoleon was introduced homosexual acts, _per se_, have never been\r\nan offence, yet instead of flourishing more vigorously, homosexuality\r\nhas so far receded into the background that some observers regard it as\r\nvery rare in France. In Germany and England, on the other hand, where\r\nthe antiquated laws against this perversion still prevail, homosexuality\r\nis extremely prominent, and its right to exist is vigorously championed.\r\nThe law cannot suppress these impulses and passions; it can only sting\r\nthem into active rebellion.[211]\r\n\r\nBut although it has invariably been seen that all attempts to make men\r\nmoral by law are doomed to disappointment, spasmodic attempts to do so\r\nare continually being made afresh. No doubt those who make these\r\nattempts are but a small minority, people whose good intentions are not\r\naccompanied by knowledge either of history or of the world. But though a\r\nminority they can often gain a free field for their activities. The\r\nreason is plain. No public man likes to take up a position which his\r\nenemies may interpret as favourable to vice and probably due to an\r\nanxiety to secure legal opportunities for his own enjoyment of vice.\r\nThis consideration especially applies to professional politicians. A\r\nMember of Parliament, who must cultivate an immaculately pure\r\nreputation, feels that he is also bound to record by his vote how\r\nanxious he is to suppress other people's immorality. Thus the philistine\r\nand the hypocrite join hands with the simple-minded idealist. Very few\r\nare left to point out that, however desirable it is to prevent\r\nimmorality, that end can never be attained by law.\r\n\r\nDuring the past ten years one of these waves of enthusiasm for the\r\nmoralization of the public by law has been sweeping across Europe and\r\nAmerica. Its energy is scarcely yet exhausted, and it may therefore be\r\nworthwhile to call attention to it. The movement has shown special\r\nactivity in Germany, in Holland, in England, in the United States, and\r\nis traceable in a minor degree in many other countries. In Germany the\r\nLex Heintze in 1900 was an indication of the appearance of this\r\nmovement, while various scandals have had the result of attracting an\r\nexaggerated amount of attention to questions of immorality and of\r\ntightening the rigour of the law, though as Germany already holds moral\r\nmatters in a very complex web of regulations it can scarcely be said\r\nthat the new movement has here found any large field of activity. In\r\nHolland it is different. Holland is one of the traditional lands of\r\nfreedom; it was the home of independent intellect, of free religion, of\r\nautonomous morals, when every other country in Europe was closed to\r\nthese manifestations of the spirit, and something of the same tradition\r\nhas always inspired its habits of thought, even when they have been\r\nlargely Puritanic. So that there was here a clear field for the movement\r\nto work in, and it has found expression, of a very thorough character\r\nindeed, in the new so-called \"Morals Law\" which was passed in 1911 after\r\nseveral weeks' discussion. Undoubtedly this law contains excellent\r\nfeatures; thus the agents of the \"white slave trade,\" who have hitherto\r\nbeen especially active in Holland, are now threatened with five years'\r\nimprisonment. Here we are concerned with what may fairly be regarded as\r\ncrime and rightly punishable as such. But excellent provisions like\r\nthese are lost to sight in a great number of other paragraphs which are\r\nat best useless and ridiculous, and at worst vexatious and mischievous\r\nin their attempts to limit the free play of civilization. Thus we find\r\nthat a year's imprisonment, or a heavy fine, threatens any one who\r\nexposes any object or writing which \"offends decency,\" a provision which\r\nenabled a policeman to enter an art-pottery shop in Amsterdam and remove\r\na piece of porcelain on which he detected an insufficiently clothed\r\nhuman figure. Yet this paragraph of the law had been passed with\r\nscarcely any opposition. Another provision of this law deals extensively\r\nwith the difficult and complicated question of the \"age of consent\" for\r\ngirls, which it raises to the age of twenty-one, making intercourse with\r\na girl under twenty-one an offence punishable by four years'\r\nimprisonment. It is generally regarded as desirable that chastity should\r\nbe preserved until adult age is well established. But as soon as sexual\r\nmaturity is attained--which is long before what we conventionally regard\r\nas the adult age, and earlier in girls than in boys--it is impossible to\r\ndismiss the question of personal responsibility. A girl over sixteen,\r\nand still more when she is over twenty, is a developed human being on\r\nthe sexual side; she is capable of seducing as well as of being seduced;\r\nshe is often more mature than the youth of corresponding age; to\r\ninstruct her in sexual hygiene, to train her to responsibility, is the\r\nproper task of morals. But to treat her as an irresponsible child, and\r\nto regard the act of interfering with her chastity when her consent has\r\nbeen given, as on a level with an assault on an innocent child merely\r\nintroduces confusion. It must often be unjust to the male partner in the\r\nact; it is always demoralizing and degrading to the girl whom it aims at\r\n\"protecting\"; above all, it reduces what ought to be an extremely\r\nserious crime to the level of a merely nominal offence when it punishes\r\none of two practically mature persons for engaging with full knowledge\r\nand deliberation in an act which, however undesirable, is altogether\r\naccording to Nature. There is here a fatal confusion between a crime and\r\nan action which is at the worst morally reprehensible and only properly\r\ncombated by moral methods.\r\n\r\nThese objections are not of a purely abstract or theoretical character.\r\nThey are based on the practical outcome of such enactments. Thus in the\r\nState of New York the \"age of consent\" was in former days thirteen\r\nyears. It was advanced to fourteen and afterwards to sixteen. This is\r\nthe extreme limit to which it may prudently be raised, and the New York\r\nSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which had taken the\r\nchief part in obtaining these changes in the law, was content to stop at\r\nthis point. But without seeking the approval of this Society, another\r\nbody, the White Cross and Social Purity League, took the matter in hand,\r\nand succeeded in passing an amendment to the law which raised the age of\r\nconsent to eighteen. What has been the result? The Committee of\r\nFourteen, who are not witnesses hostile to moral legislation, state that\r\n\"since the amendment went into effect making the age of consent eighteen\r\nyears there have been few successful prosecutions. The laws are\r\npractically inoperative so far as the age clause is concerned.\" Juries\r\nnaturally require clear evidence that a rape has been committed when the\r\ncase concerns a grown-up girl in the full possession of her faculties,\r\npossibly even a clandestine prostitute. Moreover, as rape in the first\r\ndegree involves the punishment of imprisonment for twenty years, there\r\nis a disinclination to convict a man unless the case is a very bad one.\r\nOne judge, indeed, has asserted that he will not give any man the full\r\npenalty under the present law, so long as he is on the bench. The\r\nnatural result of stretching the law to undue limits is to weaken it.\r\nInstead of being, as it should be, an extremely serious crime, rape\r\nloses in a large proportion of cases the opprobrium which rightly\r\nbelongs to it. It is, therefore, a matter for regret that in some\r\nEnglish dominions there is a tendency to raise the \"age of consent\" to\r\nan unduly high limit. In New South Wales the Girls' Protection Act has\r\nplaced the age of consent at sixteen, and in the case of offences by\r\nguardians, schoolmasters, or employers at seventeen years,\r\nnotwithstanding the vigorous opposition of a distinguished medical\r\nmember of the Legislative Council (the Hon. J.M. Creed), who presented\r\nthe arguments against so high an age. Not a single prosecution has so\r\nfar occurred under this Act.\r\n\r\nIn England the force of the moral legislation wave has been felt, but it\r\nhas been largely broken against the conservative traditions of the\r\ncountry, which make all legislation, good or bad, very difficult. A\r\nlengthy, elaborate and high-strung Prevention of Immorality Bill was\r\nintroduced in the House of Commons by a group of Nonconformists mainly\r\non the Liberal side. This Bill was very largely on the lines of the\r\nDutch law already mentioned; it proposed to raise the age of consent to\r\nnineteen; making intercourse with a girl under that age felony,\r\npunishable by five years' penal servitude, and any attempt at such\r\nintercourse by two years' imprisonment. Such a measure would be, it may\r\nbe noted, peculiarly illogical and inconsistent in England and Scotland,\r\nin both of which countries (though their laws in these matters are\r\nindependent) even a girl of twelve is legally regarded as sufficiently\r\nmature and responsible to take to herself a husband. At one moment the\r\nBill seemed to have a chance of becoming law, but a group of enlightened\r\nand independent Liberals, realizing that such a measure would introduce\r\nintolerable social conditions, organized resistance and prevented the\r\nacceptance of the Bill.\r\n\r\nThe chief organization in England at the present time for the promotion\r\nof public morality is the National Council of Public Morals, which is a\r\nvery influential body, with many able and distinguished supporters.\r\nLaw-enforced morality, however, constitutes but a very small part of the\r\nreforms advocated by this organization, which is far more concerned with\r\nthe home, the school, the Church, and the influences which operate in\r\nthose spheres. It has lately to a considerable extent joined hands with\r\nthe workers in the eugenic movement, advocating sexual hygiene and\r\nracial betterment, thus allying itself with one of the most hopeful\r\nmovements of our day. Certainly there may be some amount of zeal not\r\naccording to knowledge in the activities of the National Council of\r\nPublic Morals, but there is also very much that is genuinely\r\nenlightened, and the very fact that the Council includes representatives\r\nfrom so many fields of action and so many schools of thought largely\r\nsaves it from running into practical excesses. Its influence on the\r\nwhole is beneficial, because, although it may not be altogether averse\r\nto moral legislation, it recognizes that the policeman is a very feeble\r\nguide in these matters, and that the fundamental and essential way of\r\nbettering the public morality is by enlightening the private conscience.\r\n\r\nIn the United States conditions have been very favourable, as we have\r\nseen, for the attempt to achieve social reform by moral legislation, and\r\nnowhere else in the world has it been so clearly demonstrated that such\r\nattempts not only fail to cure the evils they are aimed at, but tend to\r\nfurther evils far worse than those aimed at. A famous example is\r\nfurnished by the so-called \"Raines Law\" of New York. This Act was passed\r\nin 1896, and was intended to regulate the sale of alcoholic liquor in\r\nall its phases throughout the State. The grounds for bringing it forward\r\nwere that the number of drinking saloons was excessive, that there was\r\nno fixed licensing fee, that too much discretionary power was allowed to\r\nthe local commissioner; while, above all, the would-be Puritanic\r\nlegislators wished so far as possible to suppress the drinking of\r\nalcoholic liquors on Sunday. To achieve these objects the licensing fee\r\nwas raised to four times its usual amount previously to this enactment;\r\nheavy penalties, including the forfeiture of a large surety-bond, were\r\nestablished, and more surely to prevent Sunday drinking only hotels, not\r\nordinary drinking bars, were allowed, with many stringent restrictions,\r\nto sell drink on that day. In order that there should be no mistake, it\r\nwas set forth in the Act that the hotel must be a real hotel with at\r\nleast ten properly furnished bedrooms. The legislators clearly thought\r\nthat they had done a fine piece of work. \"Seldom,\" wrote the Committee\r\nof Fourteen, who are by no means out of sympathy with the aims of this\r\nlegislation, \"has a law intended to regulate one evil resulted in so\r\naggravated a phase of another evil directly traceable to its\r\nprovisions.\"[212]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the passing of this law alarmed the saloon keepers;\r\nthey realized that it had them in a very tight grip, and they suspected\r\nthat it might be strictly enforced. They came to the conclusion,\r\ntherefore, that their best policy would be to accept the law and to\r\nconform themselves to its provisions by converting their drinking bars\r\ninto real hotels, with ten properly furnished bedrooms, kitchen, and\r\ndining-room. The immediate result was the preparation of ten thousand\r\nbedrooms, for which there was of course no real demand, and by 1905\r\nthere were 1407 certificated hotels in Manhattan and the Bronx alone,\r\nabout 1150 of these hotels having probably been created by the Raines\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\nBut something had to be done with all these bedrooms, properly furnished\r\naccording to law, for it was necessary to meet the heavy expenses\r\nincurred under the new conditions created by the law. The remedy was\r\nfairly obvious. These bedrooms were excellently adapted to serve as\r\nplaces of assignation and houses of prostitution. Many hotel proprietors\r\nbecame practically brothel keepers, the women in some cases becoming\r\nboarders in the hotels; and saloons and hotels have entered into a kind\r\nof alliance for their mutual benefit, and are sometimes indeed under the\r\nsame management. When a hotel is thus run in the interests of\r\nprostitution it has what may be regarded as a staff of women in the\r\nneighbouring streets. In some districts of New York it is found that\r\npractically all the prostitutes on the street are connected with some\r\nRaines Law hotel. These wise moral legislators of New York thought they\r\nwere placing a penalty on Sunday drinking; what they have really done\r\nis to place a premium on prostitution[213].\r\n\r\nAn attempt of a different kind to strike a blow at once at alcohol and\r\nat prostitution has been made in Chicago, with equally unsatisfactory\r\nresults. Drink and prostitution are connected, so intimately connected,\r\nindeed, that no attempt to separate them can ever be more than\r\nsuperficially successful even with the most minute inquisition by the\r\npolice, least of all by police officers, who, in Chicago, we are\r\nofficially told, are themselves sometimes found, when in uniform and on\r\nduty, drinking among prostitutes in \"saloons.\" On May 1, 1910, the\r\nChicago General Superintendent of Police made a rule prohibiting the\r\nsale of liquor in houses of prostitution. On the surface this rule has\r\nin most cases been observed (though only on the surface, as the\r\nfield-workers of the Chicago Vice Commission easily discovered), and a\r\nblow was thus dealt to those houses which derive a large profit from the\r\nsale of drinks on account of the high price at which they retail them.\r\nYet even so far as the rule has been obeyed, and not evaded, has it\r\neffected any good? On this point we may trust the evidence of the Vice\r\nCommissioners of Chicago, a municipal body appointed by the Mayor and\r\nCity Council, and not anxious to discredit the actions of their Police\r\nSuperintendent. \"As to the benefits derived from this order, either to\r\nthe inmates or the public, opinions differ,\" they write. \"It is\r\nundoubtedly true that the result of the order has been to scatter the\r\nprostitutes over a wide territory and to transfer the sale of liquor\r\ncarried on heretofore in houses to the near-by saloon-keepers, and to\r\nflats and residential sections, but it is an open question whether it\r\nhas resulted in the lessening of either of the two evils of prostitution\r\nand drink.\"[214] That is a mild statement of the results. It may be noted\r\nthat there are over seven thousand drinking saloons in Chicago, so that\r\nthe transfer is not difficult, while the migration to flats--of which an\r\nenormous number have been taken for purposes of prostitution (five\r\nhundred in one district alone) since this rule came into force--may\r\nindeed enable the prostitute to live a freer and more humanizing life,\r\nbut in no faintest degree diminishes the prevalence of prostitution.\r\nFrom the narrow police standpoint, indeed, the change is a disadvantage,\r\nfor it shelters the prostitute from observation, and involves an\r\nentirely new readjustment to new conditions.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that either the State of New York or the city of\r\nChicago has been in any degree more fortunate in its attempts at moral\r\nlegislation against prostitution than against drinking. As we should\r\nexpect, the laws of New York regard prostitution and the prostitute with\r\nan eye of extreme severity. Every prostitute in New York, by virtue of\r\nthe mere fact that she is a prostitute, is technically termed a\r\n\"vagrant.\" As such she is liable to be committed to the workhouse for a\r\nterm not exceeding six months; the owner of houses where she lives may\r\nbe heavily fined, as she herself may be for living in them, and the\r\nkeeper of a disorderly house may be imprisoned and the disorderly house\r\nsuppressed. It is not clear that the large number of prostitutes in New\r\nYork have been diminished by so much as a single unit, but from time to\r\ntime attempts are made in some district or another by an unusually\r\nenergetic official to put the laws into execution, and it is then\r\npossible to study the results. When disorderly houses are suppressed on\r\na large scale, there are naturally a great number of prostitutes who\r\nhave to find homes elsewhere in order to carry on their business. On one\r\noccasion, under the auspices of District-Attorney Jerome, it is stated\r\nby the Committee of Fourteen that eight hundred women were reported to\r\nbe turned out into the street in a single night. For many there are the\r\nRaines Law hotels. A great many others take refuge in tenement houses.\r\nSuch houses in congested districts are crowded with families, and with\r\nthese the prostitute is necessarily brought into close contact.\r\nConsequently the seeds of physical and mental disorder which she may\r\nbear about her are disseminated in a much more fruitful soil than they\r\nwere before. Moreover, she is compelled by the laws to exert very great\r\nenergy in the pursuit of her profession. As it is an offence to harbour\r\nher she has to pay twice as high a rent as other people would have to\r\npay for the same rooms. She may have to pay the police to refrain from\r\nmolesting her, as well as others to protect her from molestation. She is\r\nsurrounded by people whom the law encourages to prey upon her. She is\r\ncompelled to exert her energies at highest tension to earn the very\r\nlarge sums which are necessary, not to gain profits for herself, but to\r\nfeed all the sharks who are eager to grab what is given to her. The\r\nblind or perverse zeal of the moral legislators not only intensifies the\r\nevils it aims at curing, but it introduces a whole crop of new evils.\r\n\r\nHow large these sums are we may estimate by the investigation made by\r\nthe Vice Commissioners of Chicago. They conclude after careful inquiry\r\nthat the annual profits of prostitution in the city of Chicago alone\r\namount to between fifteen to sixteen million dollars, and they regard\r\nthis as \"an ultra-conservative estimate.\" It is true that not all this\r\nactually passes through the women's hands and it includes the sales of\r\ndrinks. If we confine ourselves strictly to the earnings of the girls\r\nthemselves it is found to work out at an average for each girl of\r\nthirteen hundred dollars per annum. This is more than four times as much\r\nas the ordinary shop-girl can earn in Chicago by her brains, virtue, and\r\nother good qualities. But it is not too much for the prostitute's needs;\r\nshe is compelled to earn so large an income because the active hostility\r\nof society, the law, and the police facilitates the task of all those\r\npersons--and they are many--who desire to prey upon her. Thus society,\r\nthe law, and the police gain nothing for morals by their hostility to\r\nthe prostitute. On the contrary, they give strength and stability to\r\nthe very vice they nominally profess to fight against. This is shown in\r\nthe vital matter of the high rents which it is possible to obtain where\r\nprostitution is concerned. These high rents are the direct result of\r\nlegal and police enactments against the prostitute. Remove these\r\nenactments and the rents would automatically fall. The enactments\r\nmaintain the high rents and so ensure that the mighty protection of\r\ncapital is on the side of prostitution; the property brings in an\r\nexorbitant rate of interest on the capital invested, and all the forces\r\nof sound business are concerned in maintaining rents. So gross is the\r\nignorance of the would-be moral legislators--or, some may think, so\r\nskilful their duplicity--that the methods by which they profess to fight\r\nagainst immorality are the surest methods for enabling immorality not\r\nmerely to exist--which it would in any case--but to flourish. A vigorous\r\ncampaign is initiated against immorality. On the surface it is\r\nsuccessful. Morality triumphs. But, it may be, in the end we are\r\nreminded of the saying of M. Desmaisons in one of Remy de Gourmont's\r\nwitty and profound _Dialogues des Amateurs_: \"Quand la morale triomphe\r\nil se passe des choses tres vilaines.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason why the \"triumphs\" of legislative and administrative morality\r\nare really such ignominious failures must now be clear, but may again be\r\nrepeated. It is because on matters of morals there is no unanimity of\r\nopinion as there is in regard to crime. There is always a large section\r\nof the community which feels tolerant towards, and even practises, acts\r\nwhich another section, it may be quite reasonably, stigmatizes as\r\n\"immoral.\" Such conditions are highly favourable for the exercise of\r\nmoral influence; they are quite unsuitable for legislative action, which\r\ncannot possibly be brought to bear against a large minority, perhaps\r\neven majority, of otherwise law-abiding citizens. In the matter of\r\nprostitution, for instance, the Vice Commissioners of Chicago state\r\nemphatically the need for \"constant and persistent repression\" leading\r\non to \"absolute annihilation of prostitution.\" They recommend the\r\nappointment of a \"Morals Commission\" to suppress disorderly houses, and\r\nto prosecute their keepers, their inmates, and their patrons; they\r\nfurther recommend the establishment of a \"Morals Court\" of vaguely large\r\nscope. Among the other recommendations of the Commissioners--and there\r\nare ninety-seven such recommendations--we find the establishment of a\r\nmunicipal farm, to which prostitutes can be \"committed on an\r\nindeterminate sentence\"; a \"special morals police squad\"; instructions\r\nto the police to send home all unattended boys and girls under sixteen\r\nat 9 p.m.; no seats in the parks to be in shade; searchlights to be set\r\nup at night to enable the police to see what the public are doing, and\r\nso on. The scheme, it will be seen, combines the methods of Calvin in\r\nGeneva with those of Maria Theresa in Vienna.[215]\r\n\r\nThe reason why any such high-handed repression of immorality by force is\r\nas impracticable in Chicago as elsewhere is revealed in the excellent\r\npicture of the conditions furnished by the Vice Commissioners\r\nthemselves. They estimate that the prostitutes in disorderly houses\r\nknown to the police--leaving out of account all prostitutes in flats,\r\nrooms, hotels and houses of assignation, and also taking no note of\r\nclandestine prostitutes--receive 15,180 visits from men daily, or\r\n5,540,700 per annum. They consider further that the men in question may\r\nbe one-fourth of the adult male population (800,000 in the city itself,\r\nleaving the surrounding district out of the reckoning), and they rightly\r\ninsist that this estimate cannot possibly cover all the facts. Yet it\r\nnever occurs to the Vice Commissioners that in thus proposing to brand\r\none-third or even only one quarter of the adult male population as\r\ncriminals, and as such to prosecute them actively, is to propose an\r\nabsurd impossibility.\r\n\r\nIt is not by any means only in the United States that an object lesson\r\nin the foolishness of attempting to make people moral by force is set up\r\nbefore the world. It has often been set up before, and at the present\r\nday it is illustrated in exactly the same way in Germany. Unlike as are\r\nthe police systems and the national temperaments of Germany and the\r\nUnited States, in this matter social reformers tell exactly the same\r\nstory. They report that the German laws and ordinances against\r\nimmorality increase and support the very evil they profess to attack.\r\nThus by making it criminal to shelter, even though not for purposes of\r\ngain, unmarried lovers, even when they intend to marry, the respectable\r\ngirl is forced into the position of the prostitute, and as such she\r\nbecomes subject to an endless amount of police regulation and police\r\ncontrol. Landlords are encouraged to live on her activities, charging\r\nvery high rates to indemnify themselves for the risks they run by\r\nharbouring her. She, in her turn, to meet the exorbitant demands which\r\nthe law and the police encourage the whole environment to make upon her,\r\nis forced to exercise her profession with the greatest activity, and to\r\nacquire the maximum of profit. Law and the police have forged the same\r\nvicious circle.[216]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations thus furnished by Germany, Holland, England, and the\r\nUnited States, will probably suffice to show that there really is at the\r\npresent time a wave of feeling in favour of the notion that it is\r\npossible to promote public morals by force of law. It only remains to\r\nobserve that the recognition of the futility of such attempts by no\r\nmeans necessarily involves a pessimistic conservatism. To point out that\r\nprostitution never has been, and never can be, abolished by law, is by\r\nno means to affirm that it is an evil which must endure for ever and\r\nthat no influence can affect it. But we have to realize, in the first\r\nplace, that prostitution belongs to that sphere of human impulses in\r\nwhich mere external police ordinances count for comparatively little,\r\nand that, in the second place, even in the more potent field of true\r\nmorals, which has nothing to do with moral legislation, prostitution is\r\nso subtly and deeply rooted that it can only be affected by influences\r\nwhich bear on all our methods of thought and feeling and all our social\r\ncustom. It is far from being an isolated manifestation; it is, for\r\ninstance, closely related to marriage; any reforms in prostitution,\r\ntherefore, can only follow a reform in our marriage system. But\r\nprostitution is also related to economics, and when it is realized how\r\nmuch has to be altogether changed in our whole social system to secure\r\neven an approximate abolition of prostitution it becomes doubtful\r\nwhether many people are willing to pay the price of removing the \"social\r\nevil\" they find it so easy to deplore. They are prepared to appoint\r\nCommissions; they have no objection to offer up a prayer; they are\r\nwilling to pass laws and issue police regulations which are known to be\r\nuseless. At that point their ardour ends.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible to guard the community by statute against the\r\ncentral evil of prostitution, still more hopeless is it to attempt the\r\nlegal suppression of all the multitudinous minor provocations of the\r\nsexual impulse offered by civilization. Let it be assumed that only by\r\nsuch suppression, and not by frankly meeting and fighting temptations,\r\ncan character be formed, yet it would be absolutely impossible to\r\nsuppress more than a fraction of the things that would need to be\r\nsuppressed. \"There is almost no feature, article of dress, attitude,\r\nact,\" Dr. Stanley Hall has truly remarked, \"or even animal, or perhaps\r\nobject in nature, that may not have to some morbid soul specialized\r\nerogenic and erethic power.\" If, therefore, we wish to suppress the\r\nsexually suggestive and the possibly obscene we are bound to suppress\r\nthe whole world, beginning with the human race, for if we once enter on\r\nthat path there is no definite point at which we can logically stop. The\r\ntruth is, as Mr. Theodore Schroeder has so repeatedly insisted,[217] that\r\n\"obscenity\" is subjective; it cannot reside in an object, but only in\r\nthe impure mind which is influenced by the object. In this matter Mr.\r\nSchroeder is simply the follower, at an interval, of St. Paul. We must\r\nwork not on the object, but on the impure mind affected by the object.\r\nIf the impure heart is not suppressed it is useless to suppress the\r\nimpure object, while if the heart is renewed the whole task is achieved.\r\nCertainly there are books, pictures, and other things in life so unclean\r\nthat they can never be pure even to the purest, but these things by\r\ntheir loathsomeness are harmless to all healthy minds; they can only\r\ncorrupt minds which are corrupt already. Unfortunately, when ignorant\r\npolice officials and custom-house officers are entrusted with the task\r\nof searching for the obscene, it is not to these things that their\r\nattention is exclusively directed. Such persons, it seems, cannot\r\ndistinguish between these things and the noblest productions of human\r\nart and intellect, and the law has proved powerless to set them right;\r\nin all civilized countries the list is indeed formidable of the splendid\r\nand inspiring productions, from the Bible downwards, which officials or\r\nthe law courts have been pleased to declare \"obscene.\" So that while the\r\ntask of moralizing the community by force must absolutely fail of its\r\nobject, it may at the same time suffice to effect much mischief.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the ironies of history that the passion for extinguishing\r\nimmorality by law and administration should have arisen in what used to\r\nbe called Christendom. For Christianity is precisely the most brilliant\r\nproof the world has ever seen of the truth that immorality cannot so be\r\nsuppressed. From the standpoint of classic Rome Christianity was an\r\naggressive attack on Roman morality from every side. It was not so only\r\nin appearance, but in reality, as modern historians fully recognize.[218]\r\nMerely as a new religion Christianity would have been received with calm\r\nindifference, even with a certain welcome, as other new religions were\r\nreceived. But Christianity denied the supremacy of the State, carried on\r\nan anti-military propaganda in the army, openly flouted established\r\nsocial conventions, loosened family life, preached and practised\r\nasceticism to an age that was already painfully aware that, above all\r\nthings, it needed men. The fatal though doubtless inevitable step was\r\ntaken of attempting to suppress the potent poison of this manifold\r\nimmorality by force. The triumph of Christianity was largely due to the\r\nfine qualities which were brought out by that annealing process, and the\r\nsplendid prestige which the process itself assured. Yet the method of\r\nwarfare which it had so brilliantly proved to be worthless was speedily\r\nadopted by Christianity itself, and is even yet, at intervals,\r\nspasmodically applied.\r\n\r\nThat these attempts should have such results as we see is not surprising\r\nwhen we remember that even movements, at the outset, mainly inspired by\r\nmoral energy, rather than by faith in moral legislation, when that\r\nenergy becomes reckless, violent and intolerant, lead in the end to\r\nresults altogether opposed to the aims of those who initiated them. It\r\nwas thus that Luther has permanently fortified the position of the Popes\r\nwhom he assailed, and that the Reformation produced the\r\nCounter-Reformation, a movement as formidable and as enduring as that\r\nwhich it countered. When Luther appeared all that was rigid and inhuman\r\nin the Church was slowly dissolving, certainly not without an inevitable\r\nsediment of immorality, yet the solution was in the highest degree\r\nfavourable to the development of the freer and larger conceptions of\r\nlife, the expansion of science and art and philosophy, which at that\r\nmoment was pre-eminently necessary for the progress of civilisation,\r\nand, indirectly, therefore, for the progress of morals.[219] The violence\r\nof the Reformation not only resulted in a new tyranny for its own\r\nadherents--calling in turn for fresh reformations by Puritans, Quakers,\r\nDeists, and Freethinkers--but it re-established, and even to-day\r\ncontinues to support, that very tyranny of the old Church against which\r\nit was a protest.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to regulate the morals of men on the same uniform pattern we\r\nhave to remember that we are touching the most subtle, intimate, and\r\nincalculable springs of action. It is useless to apply the crude methods\r\nof \"suppression\" and \"annihilation\" to these complex and indestructible\r\nforces. When Charles V retired in weariness from the greatest throne in\r\nthe world to the solitude of the monastery at Yuste, he occupied his\r\nleisure for some weeks in trying to regulate two clocks. It proved very\r\ndifficult. One day, it is recorded, he turned to his assistant and said:\r\n\"To think that I attempted to force the reason and conscience of\r\nthousands of men into one mould, and I cannot make two clocks agree!\"\r\nWisdom comes to the rulers of men, sometimes, usually when they have\r\nceased to be rulers. It comes to the moral legislators not otherwise\r\nthan it comes to the immoral persons they legislate against. \"I act\r\nfirst,\" the French thief said; \"then I think.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to some people almost a paradox to assert that immorality\r\nshould not be encountered by physical force. The same people would\r\nwillingly admit that it is hopeless to rout a modern army with bows and\r\narrows, even with the support of a fanfare of trumpets. Yet that\r\nmetaphor, as we have seen, altogether fails to represent the inadequacy\r\nof law in the face of immorality. We are concerned with a method of\r\nfighting which is not merely inadequate, but, as has been demonstrated\r\nmany times during the last two thousand years, actually fortifies and\r\neven dignifies the foe it professes to attack. But the failure of\r\nphysical force to suppress the spiritual evil of immorality by no means\r\nindicates that a like failure would attend the more rational tactics of\r\nopposing a spiritual force by spiritual force. The virility of our\r\nmorals is not proved by any weak attempt to call in the aid of the\r\nsecular arm of law or the ecclesiastical arm of theology. If a morality\r\ncannot by its own proper virtue hold its opposing immorality in check\r\nthen there is something wrong with that morality. It runs the risk of\r\nencountering a fresh and more vigorous movement of morality. Men begin\r\nto think that, if not the whole truth, there is yet a real element of\r\ntruth in the assertion of Nietzsche: \"We believe that severity,\r\nviolence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy,\r\nstoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind, everything wicked,\r\ntyrannical, predatory and serpentine in man, serves as well for the\r\nelevation of the human species as its opposite.\"[220] To ignore altogether\r\nthe affirmation of that opposing morality, it may be, would be to breed\r\na race of weaklings, fatally doomed to succumb helplessly to the first\r\nbreath of temptation.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are passing through a wave of moral legislation, there are\r\nyet indications that a sounder movement is coming into action. The\r\ndemand for the teaching of sexual hygiene which parents, teachers, and\r\nphysicians in Germany, the United States and elsewhere, are now striving\r\nto formulate and to supply will, if it is wisely carried out, effect far\r\nmore for public morals than all the legislation in the world.\r\nInconsistently enough, some of those who clamour for moral legislation\r\nalso advocate the teaching of sexual hygiene. But there is no room for\r\ncompromise or combination here. A training in sexual hygiene has no\r\nmeaning if it is not a training, for men and women alike, in personal\r\nand social responsibility, in the right to know and to discriminate,\r\nand in so doing to attain self-conquest. A generation thus trained to\r\nself-respect and to respect for others has no use for a web of official\r\nregulations to protect its feeble and cloistered virtues from possible\r\nvisions of evil, and an army of police to conduct it homewards at 9 p.m.\r\nNor, on the other hand, can any reliable sense of social responsibility\r\never be developed in such an unwholesome atmosphere of petty moral\r\nofficialdom. The two methods of moralization are radically antagonistic.\r\nThere can be no doubt which of them we ought to pursue if we really\r\ndesire to breed a firmly-fibred, clean-minded, and self-reliant race of\r\nmanly men and womanly women.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[191] Westermarck, _Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas_, Vol. I, p.\r\n160; see also chapter on sexual morality in Havelock Ellis, _Studies in\r\nthe Psychology of Sex_, Vol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society,\" chap. IX.\r\n\r\n[192] It must be remembered that in medieval days not only adultery but\r\nthe smallest infraction of what the Church regarded as morality could be\r\npunished in the Archdeacon's court; this continued to be the case in\r\nEngland even after the Reformation. See Archdeacon W.W. Hales'\r\ninteresting work, _Precedents and Proceedings in Criminal Causes_\r\n(1847), which is, as the author states, \"a History of the Moral Police\r\nof the Church.\"\r\n\r\n[193] _The Social Evil in New York City_, p. 100.\r\n\r\n[194] This has been emphasized in an able and lucid discussion of this\r\nquestion by Dr. Hans Hagen, \"Sittliche Werturteile,\" _Mutterschutz_,\r\nHeft I and II, 1906. Such recognition of popular morals, he justly\r\nremarks, is needed not only for the sake of the people, but for the sake\r\nof law itself.\r\n\r\n[195] Grabowsky, in criticizing Hiller's book, _Das Recht ueber sich Selbst_\r\n(_Archiv fuer Kriminalanthropologie und Kriminalistik_, Bd. 36, 1809),\r\nargues that in some cases immorality injures rights which need legal\r\nprotection, but he admits it is difficult to decide when this is the\r\ncase. He does not think that the law should interfere with homosexuality\r\nin adults, but he does consider it should interfere with incest, on the\r\nground that in-breeding is not good for the race. But it is the view of\r\nmost authorities nowadays that in-breeding is only injurious to the race\r\nin the case of an unsound stock, when the defect being in both partners\r\nof the same kind would probably be intensified by heredity.\r\n\r\n[196] The occurrence of, for instance, incestuous, bestial, and homosexual\r\nacts--which are generally abhorrent, but not necessarily\r\nanti-social--makes it necessary to exercise some caution here.\r\n\r\n[197] I quote from a valuable and interesting study by Dr. Eugen Wilhelm,\r\n\"Die Volkspsychologischen Unterschiede in der franzoesischen und\r\ndeustchen Sittlichkeits-Gesetzgebung und Rechtsprechung,\"\r\n_Sexual-Probleme_, October, 1911. It may be added that in Switzerland,\r\nalso, the tyranny of the police is carried to an extreme. Edith Sellers\r\ngives some extraordinary examples, _Cornhill_, August, 1910.\r\n\r\n[198] The absurdities and injustice of the German law, and its\r\ninterference with purely private interests in these matters, have often\r\nbeen pointed out, as by Dr. Kurt Hiller (\"Ist Kuppelei Strafwuerdig?\"\r\n_Die Neue Generation_, November, 1910). As to what is possible under\r\nGerman law by judicial decision since 1882, Hagen takes the case of a\r\nwidow who has living with her a daughter, aged twenty-five or thirty,\r\nengaged to marry an artisan now living at a distance for the sake of his\r\nwork; he comes to see her when he can; she is already pregnant; they\r\nwill marry soon; one evening, with the consent of the widow, who looks\r\non the couple as practically married, he stays over-night, sharing his\r\nbetrothed's room, the only room available. Result: the old woman becomes\r\nliable to four years' penal servitude, a fine of six thousand marks,\r\nloss of civil rights, and police supervision.\r\n\r\n[199] In another respect the French code carries private rights to an\r\nexcess by forbidding the unmarried mother to make any claim on the\r\nfather of her child. In most countries such a prohibition is regarded as\r\nunreasonable and unjust. There is even a tendency (as by a recent Dutch\r\nlaw) to compel the father to provide for his illegitimate child not on\r\nthe scale of the mother's social position but on the scale of his own\r\nsocial position. This is, possibly, an undue assertion of the\r\nsuperiority of man.\r\n\r\n[200] The same point has lately been illustrated in Holland, where a\r\nrecent modification in the law is held to press harshly on homosexual\r\npersons. At once a vigorous propaganda on behalf of the homosexual has\r\nsprung into existence. We see here the difference between moral\r\nenactments and criminal enactments. Supposing that a change in the law\r\nhad placed, for instance, increased difficulties in the way of burglary.\r\nWe should not witness any outburst of literary activity on behalf of\r\nburglars, because the community, as a whole, is thoroughly convinced\r\nthat burglary ought to be penalized.\r\n\r\n[201] Apart from the attitude towards immorality, we have an illustration\r\nof the peculiarly English tendency to unite religious fervour with\r\nindividualism in Quakerism. In no other European country has any similar\r\nmovement--that is, a popular movement of individualistic mysticism--ever\r\nappeared on the same scale.\r\n\r\n[202] E.F. Fuld, Ph.D., _Police Administration_, 1909.\r\n\r\n[203] Ex-Police Commissioner Bingham, of New York, estimated (_Hampton's\r\nMagazine_, September, 1909) that \"fifteen per cent. or from 1500 to 2000\r\nmembers of the police force are unscrupulous 'grafters' whose hands are\r\nalways out for easy money.\" See also Report of the Committee of Fourteen\r\non _The Social Evil in New York City_, p. 34.\r\n\r\n[204] Fuld, _op. cit._, pp. 373 _et seq._ This last opinion by no means\r\nstands alone. Thus it is asserted by the Committee of Fourteen in their\r\nReport on The _Social Evil in New York City_ (1910, p. xxxiv) that \"some\r\nlaws exist to-day because an unintelligent, cowardly public puts\r\nunenforceable statutes on the book, being content with registering their\r\nhypocrisy.\"\r\n\r\n[205] It is also a blundering policy. Its blind anathema is as likely as\r\nnot to fall on its own allies. Thus the Report of the municipally\r\nappointed and municipally financed Vice Commission of Chicago is not\r\nonly an official but a highly moral document, advocating increased\r\nsuppression of immoral literature, and erring, if it errs, on the side\r\nof over-severity. It has been suppressed by the United States Post\r\nOffice!\r\n\r\n[206] This system applies only to spirits, not to beer and wine, but it\r\nhas proved very effective in diminishing drunkenness, as is admitted by\r\nthose who are opposed to the system. A somewhat similar system exists in\r\nEngland under the name of the Trust system, but its extension appears\r\nunfortunately to be much impeded by English laws and customs.\r\n\r\n[207] Jacques Bertillon, in a paper read to the Academie des Sciences\r\nMorales et Politiques, 30th September, 1911.\r\n\r\n[208] During the present century a great wave of immorality and sexual\r\ncrime has been passing over Russia. This is not attributable to the\r\nlaws, old or new, but is due in part to the Russo-Japanese War, and in\r\npart to the relaxed tension consequent on the collapse of the movement\r\nfor political reform. (See an article by Professor Asnurof, \"La Crise\r\nSexuelle en Russie,\" _Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle_, April,\r\n1911.)\r\n\r\n[209] It was by this indirect influence that I was induced to write the\r\npresent chapter. The editor of a prominent German review wrote to me for\r\nmy opinion regarding a Bill dealing with the prevention of immorality\r\nwhich had been introduced into the English Parliament and had aroused\r\nmuch interest and anxiety in Germany, where it had been discussed in all\r\nits details. But I had never so much as heard of the Bill, nor could I\r\nfind any one else who had heard of it, until I consulted a Member of\r\nParliament who happened to have been instrumental in causing its\r\nrejection.\r\n\r\n[210] J. Schrank, _Die Prostitution in Wien_, Bd. I, pp. 152-206.\r\n\r\n[211] The history of this movement in Germany may be followed in the\r\n_Vierteljahrsberichte des Wissenschaftlich-humanitaeren Komitees_, edited\r\nby Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, a great authority on the matter.\r\n\r\n[212] Report on _The Social Evil in New York City_, p. 38; see also Rev\r\nDr. J.P. Peters, \"Suppression of the 'Raines Law Hotels,'\" _American\r\nAcademy of Political and Social Science_, November, 1908.\r\n\r\n[213] It is probably needless to add that the specific object of the\r\nAct--the Puritanic observance of Sunday--was by no means attained. On\r\nSunday, the 8th December, 1907, the police made a desperate attempt to\r\nenforce the law; every place of amusement was shut up; lectures,\r\nreligious concerts, even the social meetings of the Young Men's\r\nChristian Association, were rigorously put a stop to. There was, of\r\ncourse, great popular indignation and uproar, and the impromptu\r\nperformances got up in the streets, while the police looked on\r\nsympathetically, are said to have been far more outrageous than any\r\nentertainment indoors could possibly have been.\r\n\r\n[214] _The Social Evil in Chicago_, p. 112.\r\n\r\n[215] The methods of Maria Theresa never had any success; the methods of\r\nCalvin at Geneva had, however, a certain superficial success, because\r\nthe right conditions existed for their exercise. That is to say, that a\r\ntheocratic basis of society was generally accepted, and that the\r\nsuppression of immorality was regarded by the great mass of the\r\npopulation, including in most cases, no doubt, even the offenders\r\nthemselves, as a religious duty. It is, however, interesting to note\r\nthat, even at Geneva, these \"triumphs of morality\" have met the usual\r\nfate. At the present day, it appears (Edith Sellers, _Cornhill_, August,\r\n1910), there are more disorderly houses in Geneva, in proportion to the\r\npopulation, than in any other town in Europe.\r\n\r\n[216] See e.g. P. Hausmeister, \"Zur Analyse der Prostitution,\" _Geschlect\r\nund Gesellschaft_, 1907, p. 294.\r\n\r\n[217] Theodore Schroeder, _\"Obscene\" Literature and Constitutional Law_,\r\nNew York, 1911.\r\n\r\n[218] Thus Sir Samuel Dill (_Roman Society_, p. 11) calls attention to the\r\nletter of St. Paulinus who, when the Empire was threatened by\r\nbarbarians, wrote to a Roman soldier that Christianity is incompatible\r\nwith family life, with citizenship, with patriotism, and that soldiers\r\nare doomed to eternal torment. Christians frequently showed no respect\r\nfor law or its representatives. \"Many Christian confessors,\" says Sir\r\nW.M. Ramsay (_The Church in the Roman Empire_, chap. xv), \"went to\r\nextremes in showing their contempt and hatred for their judges. Their\r\nanswers to plain questions were evasive and indirect; they lectured\r\nRoman dignitaries as if the latter were the criminals and they\r\nthemselves the judges; and they even used violent reproaches and coarse,\r\ninsulting gestures.\" Bouche-Leclercq (_L'Intolerance Religieuse et le\r\nPolitique_, 1911, especially chap. X) shows how the early Christians\r\ninsisted on being persecuted. We see much the same attitude to-day among\r\nanarchists of the lower class (and also, it may be added, sometimes\r\namong suffragettes), who may be regarded as the modern analogues of the\r\nearly Christians.\r\n\r\n[219] It may well be, indeed, that in all ages the actual sum of\r\nimmorality, broadly considered--in public and in private, in thought and\r\nin act--undergoes but slight oscillations. But in the nature of its\r\nmanifestations and in the nature of the manifestations that accompany\r\nit, there may be immense fluctuations. Tarde, the distinguished thinker,\r\nreferring to the \"delicious Catholicism\" of the days before Luther,\r\nasks: \"If that amiable Christian evolution had peacefully continued to\r\nour days, should we be still more immoral than we are? It is doubtful,\r\nbut in all probability we should be enjoying the most aesthetic and the\r\nleast vexatious religion in the world, in which all our science, all our\r\ncivilization, would have been free to progress\" (Tarde, _La Logique\r\nSociale_, p. 198). As has often been pointed out, it was along the lines\r\nindicated by Erasmus, rather than along the lines pursued by Luther,\r\nthat the progress of civilization lay.\r\n\r\n[220] Nietzsche, _Beyond Good and Evil_, chap. II. A century earlier\r\nGodwin had written in his _Political Justice_ (Book VII, chap. VIII):\r\n\"Men are weak at present because they have always been told they are\r\nweak and must not be trusted with themselves. Take them out of their\r\nshackles, bid them enquire, reason, and judge, and you will soon find\r\nthem very different beings. Tell them that they have passions, are\r\noccasionally hasty, intemperate, and injurious, but that they must be\r\ntrusted with themselves. Tell them that the mountains of parchment in\r\nwhich they have been hitherto entrenched, are fit only to impose upon\r\nages of superstition and ignorance, that henceforth we will have no\r\ndependence but upon their spontaneous justice; that, if their passions\r\nbe gigantic, they must rise with gigantic energy to subdue them; that if\r\ntheir decrees be iniquitous, the iniquity shall be all their own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AGAINST WAR\r\n\r\n     Why the Problem of War is specially urgent To-day--The Beneficial\r\n     Effects of War in Barbarous Ages--Civilization renders the Ultimate\r\n     Disappearance of War Inevitable--The Introduction of Law in\r\n     disputes between Individuals involves the Introduction of Law in\r\n     disputes between Nations--But there must be Force behind Law--Henry\r\n     IV's Attempt to Confederate Europe--Every International Tribunal of\r\n     Arbitration must be able to enforce its Decisions--The Influences\r\n     making for the Abolition of Warfare--(1) Growth of International\r\n     Opinion--(2) International Financial Development--(3) The\r\n     Decreasing Pressure of Population--(4) The Natural Exhaustion of\r\n     the Warlike Spirit--(5) The Spread of Anti-military Doctrines--(6)\r\n     The overgrowth of Armaments--(7) The Dominance of Social\r\n     Reform--War Incompatible with an Advanced Civilization--Nations as\r\n     Trustees for Humanity--The Impossibility of Disarmament--The\r\n     Necessity of Force to ensure Peace--The Federated State of the\r\n     Future--The Decay of War still leaves the Possibilities of Daring\r\n     and Heroism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, special reasons why at the present time war and the\r\narmaments of war should appear an intolerable burden which must be\r\nthrown off as soon as possible if the task of social hygiene is not to\r\nbe seriously impeded. But the abolition of the ancient method of\r\nsettling international disputes by warfare is not a problem which\r\ndepends for its solution on the conditions of the moment. It is implicit\r\nin the natural development of the process of civilization. At one stage,\r\nno doubt, warfare plays an important part in constituting states and so,\r\nindirectly, in promoting civilization. But civilization tends slowly\r\nbut surely to substitute for war in the later stages of this process the\r\nmethods of law, or, in any case, methods which, while not always\r\nunobjectionable, avoid the necessity for any breach of the peace.[221] As\r\nsoon, indeed, as in primitive society two individuals engage in a\r\ndispute which they are compelled to settle not by physical force but by\r\na resort to an impartial tribunal, the thin end of the wedge is\r\nintroduced, and the ultimate destruction of war becomes merely a matter\r\nof time. If it is unreasonable for two individuals to fight it is\r\nunreasonable for two groups of individuals to fight.[222]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty has been that while it is quite easy for an ordered\r\nsociety to compel two individuals to settle their differences before a\r\ntribunal, in accordance with abstractly determined principles of law and\r\nreason, it is a vastly more difficult matter to compel two groups of\r\nindividuals so to settle their differences. A large part of the history\r\nof all the great European countries has consisted in the progressive\r\nconquest and pacification of small but often bellicose states outside,\r\nand even inside, their own borders.[223] This is the case even within a\r\ncommunity. Hobbes, writing in the midst of a civil war, went so far as\r\nto lay down that the \"final cause\" of a commonwealth is nothing else but\r\nthe abolition of \"that miserable condition of war which is necessarily\r\nconsequent to the natural passions of men when there is no visible power\r\nto keep them in awe.\" Yet we see to-day that even within our highly\r\ncivilized communities there is not always any adequately awful power to\r\nprevent employers and employed from engaging in what is little better\r\nthan a civil war, nor even to bind them to accept the decision of an\r\nimpartial tribunal they may have been persuaded to appeal to. The\r\nsmallest state can compel its individual citizens to keep the peace; a\r\nlarge state can compel a small state to do so; but hitherto there has\r\nbeen no guarantee possible that large states, or even large compact\r\ngroups within the state, should themselves keep the peace. They commit\r\nwhat injustice they please, for there is no visible power to keep them\r\nin awe. We have attained a condition in which a state is able to enforce\r\na legal and peaceful attitude in its own individual citizens towards\r\neach other. The state is the guardian of its citizens' peace, but the\r\nold problem recurs: _Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?_\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this difficulty increases as the size of states\r\nincreases. To compel a small state to keep the peace by absorbing it if\r\nit fails to do so is always an easy and even tempting process to a\r\nneighbouring larger state. This process was once carried out on a\r\ncomplete scale, when practically the whole known world was brought under\r\nthe sway of Rome. \"War has ceased,\" Plutarch was able to declare in the\r\ndays of the Roman Empire, and, though himself an enthusiastic Greek, he\r\nwas unbounded in his admiration of the beneficence of the majestic _Pax\r\nRomana_, and never tempted by any narrow spirit of patriotism to desire\r\nthe restoration of his own country's glories. But the Roman organization\r\nbroke up, and no single state will ever be strong enough to restore it.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to establish orderly legal relationships between states\r\nmust, therefore, be carried out by the harmonious co-operation of those\r\nstates. At the end of the sixteenth century a great French statesman,\r\nSully, inspired Henry IV with a scheme of a Council of Confederated\r\nEuropean Christian States; each of these states, fifteen in number, was\r\nto send four representatives to the Council, which was to sit at Metz or\r\nCologne and regulate the differences between the constituent states of\r\nthe Confederation. The army of the Confederation was to be maintained in\r\ncommon, and used chiefly to keep the peace, to prevent one sovereign\r\nfrom interfering with any other, and also, if necessary, to repel\r\ninvasion of barbarians from without. The scheme was arranged in concert\r\nwith Queen Elizabeth, and twelve of the fifteen Powers had already\r\npromised their active co-operation when the assassination of Henry\r\ndestroyed the whole plan. Such a Confederation was easier to arrange\r\nthen than it is now, but probably it was more difficult to maintain, and\r\nit can scarcely be said that at that date the times were ripe for so\r\nadvanced a scheme.[224]\r\n\r\nTo-day the interests of small states are so closely identified with\r\npeace that it is seldom difficult to exert pressure on them to maintain\r\nit. It is quite another matter with the large states. The fact that\r\nduring the past half century so much has been done by the larger states\r\nto aid the cause of international arbitration, and to submit disputes to\r\ninternational tribunals, shows how powerful the motives for avoiding war\r\nare nowadays becoming. But the fact, also, that no country hitherto has\r\nabandoned its liberty of withdrawing from peaceful arbitration any\r\nquestion involving \"national honour\" shows that there is no constituted\r\npower strong enough to control large states. For the reservation of\r\nquestions of national honour from the sphere of law is as absurd as\r\nwould be any corresponding limitation by individuals of their liability\r\nfor their acts before the law; it is as though a man were to say: \"If I\r\ncommit a theft I am willing to appear before the court, and will\r\nprobably pay the penalty demanded; but if it is a question of murder,\r\nthen my vital interests are at stake, and I deny altogether the right of\r\nthe court to intervene.\" It is a reservation fatal to peace, and could\r\nnot be accepted if pleaded at the bar of any international tribunal with\r\nthe power to enforce its decisions. \"Imagine,\" says Edward Jenks, in his\r\n_History of Politics_, \"a modern judge 'persuading' Mr. William Sikes to\r\n'make it up' with the relatives of his victim, and, on his remaining\r\nobdurate, leaving the two families to fight the matter out.\" Yet that is\r\nwhat was in some degree done in England until medieval times as regards\r\nindividual crimes, and it is what is still done as regards national\r\ncrimes, in so far as the appeal to arbitration is limited and voluntary.\r\nThe proposals, therefore--though not yet accepted by any\r\nGovernment--lately mooted in the United States, in England, and in\r\nFrance, to submit international disputes, without reservation, to an\r\nimpartial tribunal represent an advance of peculiar significance.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of collective fighting is so desirable an extension of the\r\nabolition of individual fighting, and its introduction has waited so\r\nlong the establishment of some high compelling power--for the influence\r\nof the Religion of Peace has in this matter been less than nil--that it\r\nis evident that only the coincidence of very powerful and peculiar\r\nfactors could have brought the question into the region of practical\r\npolitics in our own time. There are several such factors, most of which\r\nhave been developing during a long period, but none have been clearly\r\nrecognized until recent years. It may be worth while to indicate the\r\ngreat forces now warring against war.\r\n\r\n(1) _Growth of International Opinion._ There can be no doubt whatever\r\nthat during recent years, and especially in the more democratic\r\ncountries, an international consensus of public opinion has gradually\r\ngrown up, making itself the voice, like a Greek chorus, of an abstract\r\njustice. It is quite true that of this justice, as of justice generally,\r\nit may be said that it has wide limits. Renan declared once, in a famous\r\nallocution, that \"what is called indulgence is, most often, only\r\njustice,\" and, at the other extreme, Remy de Gourmont has said that\r\n\"injustice is sometimes a part of justice;\" in other words, there are\r\nvarying circumstances in which justice may properly be tempered either\r\nwith mercy or with severity. In any case, and however it may be\r\nqualified; a popular international voice generously pronouncing itself\r\nin favour of justice, and resonantly condemning any Government which\r\nclashes against justice, is now a factor of the international situation.\r\nIt is, moreover, tending to become a factor having a certain influence\r\non affairs. This was the case during the South African War, when\r\nEngland, by offending this international sense of justice, fell into a\r\ndiscredit which had many actual unpleasant results and narrowly escaped,\r\nthere is some reason to believe, proving still more serious. The same\r\nvoice was heard with dramatically sudden and startling effect when\r\nFerrer was shot at Barcelona. Ferrer was a person absolutely unknown to\r\nthe man in the street; he was indeed little more than a name even to\r\nthose who knew Spain; few could be sure, except by a kind of intuition,\r\nthat he was the innocent victim of a judicial murder, for it is only now\r\nthat the fact is being slowly placed beyond dispute. Yet immediately\r\nafter Ferrer was shot within the walls of Monjuich a great shout of\r\nindignation was raised, with almost magical suddenness and harmony,\r\nthroughout the civilized world, from Italy to Belgium, from England to\r\nArgentina. Moreover, this voice was so decisive and so loud that it\r\nacted like those legendary trumpet-blasts which shattered the walls of\r\nJericho; in a few days the Spanish Government, with a powerful minister\r\nat its head, had fallen. The significance of this event we cannot easily\r\noverestimate. For the first time in history, the voice of international\r\npublic opinion, unsupported by pressure, political, social, or\r\ndiplomatic, proved potent enough to avenge an act of injustice by\r\ndestroying a Government. A new force has appeared in the world, and it\r\ntends to operate against those countries which are guilty of injustice,\r\nwhether that injustice is exerted against a State or even only against a\r\nsingle obscure individual. The modern developments of telegraphy and the\r\nPress--unfavourable as the Press is in many respects to the cause of\r\ninternational harmony--have placed in the hands of peace this new weapon\r\nagainst war.\r\n\r\n(2) _International Financial Development._ There is another\r\ninternational force which expresses itself in the same sense. The voice\r\nof abstract justice raised against war is fortified by the voice of\r\nconcrete self-interest. The interests of the propertied classes, and\r\ntherefore of the masses dependent upon them, are to-day so widely\r\ndistributed throughout the world that whenever any country is plunged\r\ninto a disastrous war there arises in every other country, especially in\r\nrich and prosperous lands with most at stake, a voice of self-interest\r\nin harmony with the voice of justice. It is sometimes said that wars are\r\nin the interest of capital, and of capital alone, and that they are\r\nengineered by capitalists masquerading under imposing humanitarian\r\ndisguises. That is doubtless true to the extent that every war cannot\r\nfail to benefit some section of the capitalistic world, which will\r\ntherefore favour it, but it is true to that extent only. The old notion\r\nthat war and the acquisition of territories encouraged trade by opening\r\nup new markets has proved fallacious. The extension of trade is a matter\r\nof tariffs rather than of war, and in any case the trade of a country\r\nwith its own acquisitions by conquest is a comparatively insignificant\r\nportion of its total trade. But even if the financial advantages of war\r\nwere much greater than they are, they would be more than compensated by\r\nthe disadvantages which nowadays attend war. International financial\r\nrelationships have come to constitute a network of interests so vast, so\r\ncomplicated, so sensitive, that the whole thrills responsively to any\r\ndisturbing touch, and no one can say beforehand what widespread damage\r\nmay not be done by shock even at a single point. When a country is at\r\nwar its commerce is at once disorganized, that is to say that its\r\nshipping, and the shipping of all the countries that carry its freights,\r\nis thrown out of gear to a degree that often cannot fail to be\r\ninternationally disastrous. Foreign countries cannot send in the imports\r\nthat lie on their wharves for the belligerent country, nor can they get\r\nout of it the exports they need for their own maintenance or luxury.\r\nMoreover, all the foreign money invested in the belligerent country is\r\ndepreciated and imperilled. The international voice of trade and finance\r\nis, therefore, to-day mainly on the side of peace.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that this voice is not, as it might seem, a selfish\r\nvoice only. It is justifiable not only in immediate international\r\ninterests, but even in the ultimate interests of the belligerent\r\ncountry, and not less so if that country should prove victorious. So far\r\nas business and money are concerned, a country gains nothing by a\r\nsuccessful war, even though that war involves the acquisition of immense\r\nnew provinces; after a great war a conquered country may possess more\r\nfinancial stability than its conqueror, and both may stand lower in this\r\nrespect than some other country which is internationally guaranteed\r\nagainst war. Such points as these have of late been ably argued by\r\nNorman Angell in his remarkable book, _The Great Illusion_, and for the\r\nmost part convincingly illustrated.[225] As was long since said, the\r\nancients cried, _Vae victis_! We have learnt to cry, _Vae victoribus_!\r\n\r\nIt may, indeed, be added that the general tendency of war--putting aside\r\npeoples altogether lacking in stamina--is to moralize the conquered and\r\nto demoralise the conquerors. This effect is seen alike on the material\r\nand the spiritual sides. Conquest brings self-conceit and intolerance,\r\nthe reckless inflation and dissipation of energies. Defeat brings\r\nprudence and concentration; it ennobles and fortifies. All the glorious\r\nvictories of the first Napoleon achieved less for France than the\r\ncrushing defeat of the third Napoleon. The triumphs left enfeeblement;\r\nthe defeat acted as a strong tonic which is still working beneficently\r\nto-day. The corresponding reverse process has been at work in Germany:\r\nthe German soil that Napoleon ploughed yielded a Moltke and a\r\nBismarck,[226] while to-day, however mistakenly, the German Press is\r\ncrying out that only another war--it ought in honesty to say an\r\nunsuccessful war--can restore the nation's flaccid muscle. It is yet\r\ntoo early to see the results of the Russo-Japanese War, but already\r\nthere are signs that by industrial overstrain and the repression of\r\nindividual thought Japan is threatening to enfeeble the physique and to\r\ndestroy the high spirit of the indomitable men to whom she owed her\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Decreasing Pressure of Population._ It was at one time commonly\r\nsaid, and is still sometimes repeated, that the pressure of\r\nover-population is the chief cause of wars. That is a statement which\r\nrequires a very great deal of qualification. It is, indeed, possible\r\nthat the great hordes of warlike barbarians from the North and the East\r\nwhich invaded Europe in early times, sometimes more or less overwhelming\r\nthe civilized world, were the result of a rise in the birth-rate and an\r\nexcess of population beyond the means of subsistence. But this is far\r\nfrom certain, for we know absolutely nothing concerning the birth-rate\r\nof these invading peoples either before or during the period of their\r\nincursions. Again, it is certain that, in modern times, a high and\r\nrising birth-rate presents a favourable condition for war. A war\r\ndistracts attention from the domestic disturbances and economic\r\nwretchedness which a too rapid growth of population necessarily\r\nproduces, while at the same time tending to draw away and destroy the\r\nsurplus population which causes this disturbance and wretchedness. Yet\r\nthere are other ways of meeting this over-population beside the crude\r\nmethod of war. Social reform and emigration furnish equally effective\r\nand much more humane methods of counteracting such pressure. No doubt\r\nthe over-population resulting from an excessively high birth-rate, when\r\nnot met, as it tends to be, by a correspondingly high death-rate from\r\ndisease, may be regarded as a predisposing cause of war, but to assert\r\nthat it is the pre-eminent cause is to go far beyond the evidence at\r\npresent available.\r\n\r\nTo whatever degree, however, it may have been potent in causing war in\r\nthe past, it is certain that the pressure of population as a cause of\r\nwar will be eliminated in the future. The only nations nowadays that can\r\nafford to make war on the grand scale are the wealthy and civilized\r\nnations. But civilization excludes a high birth-rate: there has never\r\nbeen any exception to that law, nor can we conceive any exceptions, for\r\nit is more than a social law; it is a biological law. Russia, a still\r\nimperfectly civilized country, stands apart in having a very high\r\nbirth-rate, but it also has a very high death-rate, and even should it\r\nhappen that in Russia improved social conditions lower the death-rate\r\nbefore affecting the birth-rate, there is still ample room within\r\nRussian territory for the consequent increase of population. Among all\r\nthe other nations which are considered to threaten the world's peace,\r\nthe birth-rate is rapidly falling. This is so, for instance, as regards\r\nEngland and Germany. Germany, especially, it was once thought--though in\r\nactual fact Germany has not fought for over forty years--had an interest\r\nin going to war in order to find an outlet for her surplus population,\r\ncompelled, in the absence of suitable German colonies, to sacrifice its\r\npatriotism and lose its nationality by emigrating to foreign countries.\r\nBut the German birth-rate is falling, German emigration is decreasing,\r\nand the immense growth of German industry is easily able to absorb the\r\nnew generation. Thus the declining birth-rate of civilized lands will\r\nalone largely serve in the end to eliminate warfare, partly by removing\r\none of its causes, partly because the increased value of human life will\r\nmake war too costly.\r\n\r\n(4) _The Natural Exhaustion of the Warlike Spirit._ It is a remarkable\r\ntendency of the warlike spirit--frequently emphasized in recent years by\r\nthe distinguished zoologist, President D.S. Jordan, who here follows\r\nNovikov[227]--that it tends to exterminate itself. Fighting stocks, and\r\npeoples largely made up of fighting stocks, are naturally killed out,\r\nand the field is left to the unwarlike. It is only the prudent, those\r\nwho fight and run away, who live to fight another day; and they transmit\r\ntheir prudence to their offspring. Great Britain is a conspicuous\r\nexample of a land which, being an island, was necessarily peopled by\r\npredatory and piratical invaders. A long series of warlike and\r\nadventurous peoples--Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, Normans--built\r\nup England and imparted to it their spirit. The English were, it was\r\nsaid, \"a people for whom pain and death are nothing, and who only fear\r\nhunger and boredom.\" But for over eight hundred years they have never\r\nbeen reinforced by new invaders, and the inevitable consequences have\r\nfollowed. There has been a gradual killing out of the warlike stocks, a\r\nprocess immensely accelerated during the nineteenth century by a vast\r\nemigration of the more adventurous elements in the population, pressed\r\nout of the overcrowded country by the reckless and unchecked increase of\r\nthe population which occurred during the first three-quarters of that\r\ncentury. The result is that the English (except sometimes when they\r\nhappen to be journalists) cannot now be described as a warlike people.\r\nOld legends tell of British heroes who, when their legs were hacked\r\naway, still fought upon the stumps. Modern poets feel that to picture a\r\nBritish warrior of to-day in this attitude would be somewhat\r\nfar-fetched. The historian of the South African War points out, again\r\nand again, that the British leaders showed a singular lack of the\r\nfighting spirit. During that war English generals seldom cared to engage\r\nthe enemy's forces except when their own forces greatly outnumbered\r\nthem, and on many occasions they surrendered immediately they realized\r\nthat they were themselves outnumbered. Those reckless Englishmen who\r\nboldly sailed out from their little island to face the Spanish Armada\r\nwere long ago exterminated; an admirably prudent and cautious race has\r\nbeen left alive.\r\n\r\nIt is the same story elsewhere. The French long cherished the tradition\r\nof military glory, and no country has fought so much. We see the result\r\nto-day. In no country is the attitude of the intellectual classes so\r\ncalm and so reasonable on the subject of war, and nowhere is the popular\r\nhostility to war so strongly marked.[228] Spain furnishes another instance\r\nwhich is even still more decisive. The Spanish were of old a\r\npre-eminently warlike people, capable of enduring all hardships, never\r\nfearing to face death. Their aggressively warlike and adventurous spirit\r\nsent them to death all over the world. It cannot be said, even to-day,\r\nthat the Spaniards have lost their old tenacity and hardness of fibre,\r\nbut their passion for war and adventure was killed out three centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn all these and the like cases there has been a process of selective\r\nbreeding, eliminating the soldierly stocks and leaving the others to\r\nbreed the race. The men who so loved fighting that they fought till they\r\ndied had few chances of propagating their own warlike impulses. The men\r\nwho fought and ran away, the men who never fought at all, were the men\r\nwho created the new generation and transmitted to it their own\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nThis selective process, moreover, has not merely acted automatically; it\r\nhas been furthered by social opinion and social pressure, sometimes very\r\ndrastically expressed. Thus in the England of the Plantagenets there\r\ngrew up a class called \"gentlemen\"--not, as has sometimes been\r\nsupposed, a definitely defined class, though they were originally of\r\ngood birth--whose chief characteristic was that they were good fighting\r\nmen, and sought fortune by fighting. The \"premier gentleman\" of England,\r\naccording to Sir George Sitwell, and an entirely typical representative\r\nof his class, was a certain glorious hero who fought with Talbot at\r\nAgincourt, and also, as the unearthing of obscure documents shows, at\r\nother times indulged in housebreaking, and in wounding with intent to\r\nkill, and in \"procuring the murder of one Thomas Page, who was cut to\r\npieces while on his knees begging for his life.\" There, evidently, was a\r\nstate of society highly favourable to the warlike man, highly\r\nunfavourable to the unwarlike man whom he slew in his wrath. Nowadays,\r\nhowever, there has been a revaluation of these old values. The cowardly\r\nand no doubt plebeian Thomas Page, multiplied by the million, has\r\nsucceeded in hoisting himself into the saddle, and he revenges himself\r\nby discrediting, hunting into the slums, and finally hanging, every\r\ndescendant he can find of the premier gentleman of Agincourt.\r\n\r\nIt must be added that the advocates of the advantages of war are not\r\nentitled to claim this process of selective breeding as one of the\r\nadvantages of war. It is quite true that war is incompatible with a high\r\ncivilization, and must in the end be superseded. But this method of\r\nsuppressing it is too thorough. It involves not merely the extermination\r\nof the fighting spirit, but of many excellent qualities, physical and\r\nmoral, which are associated with the fighting spirit. Benjamin Franklin\r\nseems to have been the first to point out that \"a standing army\r\ndiminishes the size and breed of the human species.\" Almost in\r\nFranklin's lifetime that was demonstrated on a wholesale scale, for\r\nthere seems little reason to doubt that the size and stature of the\r\nFrench nation have been permanently diminished by the constant levies of\r\nyoung recruits, the flower of the population, whom Napoleon sent out to\r\ndeath in their first manhood and still childless. Fine physical breed\r\ninvolves also fine qualities of virility and daring which are needed for\r\nother purposes than fighting. In so far as the selective breeding of war\r\nkills these out, its results are imperfect, and could be better attained\r\nby less radical methods.\r\n\r\n(5) _The Growth of the Anti-Military Spirit._ The decay of the warlike\r\nspirit by the breeding out of fighting stocks has in recent years been\r\nreinforced by a more acute influence of which in the near future we\r\nshall certainly hear more. This is the spirit of anti-militarism. This\r\nspirit is an inevitable result of the decay of the fighting spirit. In a\r\ncertain sense it is also complementary to it. The survival of\r\nnon-fighting stocks by the destruction of the fighting stocks works most\r\neffectually in countries having a professional army. The anti-military\r\nspirit, on the contrary, works effectually in countries having a\r\nnational army in which it is compulsory for all young citizens to serve,\r\nfor it is only in such countries that the anti-militarist can, by\r\nrefusing to serve, take an influential position as a martyr in the cause\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nAmong the leading nations, it is in France that the spirit of\r\nanti-militarism has taken the deepest hold of the people, though in\r\nsome smaller lands, notably among the obstinately peaceable inhabitants\r\nof Holland, the same spirit also flourishes. Herve, who is a leader of\r\nthe insurrectional socialists, as they are commonly called in opposition\r\nto the purely parliamentary socialists led by Jaures,--though the\r\ninsurrectional socialists also use parliamentary methods,--may be\r\nregarded as the most conspicuous champion of anti-militarism, and many\r\nof his followers have suffered imprisonment as the penalty of their\r\nconvictions. In France the peasant proprietors in the country and the\r\norganized workers in the town are alike sympathetic to anti-militarism.\r\nThe syndicalists, or labour unionists with the Confederation Generale du\r\nTravail as their central organization, are not usually anxious to\r\nimitate what they consider the unduly timid methods of English trade\r\nunionists;[229] they tend to be revolutionary and anti-military. The\r\nCongress of delegates of French Trade Unions, held at Toulouse in 1910,\r\npassed the significant resolution that \"a declaration of war should be\r\nfollowed by the declaration of a general revolutionary strike.\" The same\r\ntendency, though in a less radical form, is becoming international, and\r\nthe great International Socialist Congress at Copenhagen has passed a\r\nresolution instructing the International Bureau to \"take the opinion of\r\nthe organized workers of the world on the utility of a general strike\r\nin preventing war.\"[230] Even the English working classes are slowly\r\ncoming into line. At a Conference of Labour Delegates, held at Leicester\r\nin 1911, to consider the Copenhagen resolution, the policy of the\r\nanti-military general strike was defeated by only a narrow majority, on\r\nthe ground that it required further consideration, and might be\r\ndetrimental to political action; but as most of the leaders are in\r\nfavour of the strike policy there can be no doubt that this method of\r\ncombating war will shortly be the accepted policy of the English Labour\r\nmovement. In carrying out such a policy the Labour Party expects much\r\nhelp from the growing social and political power of women. The most\r\ninfluential literary advocate of the Peace movement, and one of the\r\nearliest, has been a woman, the Baroness Bertha von Suttner, and it is\r\nheld to be incredible that the wives and mothers of the people will use\r\ntheir power to support an institution which represents the most brutal\r\nmethod of destroying their husbands and sons. \"The cause of woman,\" says\r\nNovikov, \"is the cause of peace.\" \"We pay the first cost on all human\r\nlife,\" says Olive Schreiner.[231]\r\n\r\nThe anti-militarist, as things are at present, exposes himself not only\r\nto the penalty of imprisonment, but also to obloquy. He has virtually\r\nrefused to take up arms in defence of his country; he has sinned against\r\npatriotism. This accusation has led to a counter-accusation directed\r\nagainst the very idea of patriotism. Here the writings of Tolstoy, with\r\ntheir poignant and searching appeals for the cause of humanity as\r\nagainst the cause of patriotism, have undoubtedly served the\r\nanti-militarists well, and wherever the war against war is being urged,\r\neven so far as Japan, Tolstoy has furnished some of its keenest weapons.\r\nMoreover, in so far as anti-militarism is advocated by the workers, they\r\nclaim that international interests have already effaced and superseded\r\nthe narrower interests of patriotism. In refusing to fight, the workers\r\nof a country are simply declaring their loyalty to fellow-workers on the\r\nother side of the frontier, a loyalty which has stronger claims on them,\r\nthey hold, than any patriotism which simply means loyalty to\r\ncapitalists; geographical frontiers are giving place to economic\r\nfrontiers, which now alone serve to separate enemies. And if, as seems\r\nprobable, when the next attempt is made at a great European war, the\r\norder for mobilization is immediately followed in both countries by the\r\ndeclaration of a general strike, there will be nothing to say against\r\nsuch a declaration even from the standpoint of the narrowest patriotism,\r\nalthough there may be much to say on other grounds against the policy of\r\nthe general strike.[232]\r\n\r\nIf we realize what is going on around us, it is easy to see that the\r\nanti-militarist movement is rapidly reaching a stage when it will be\r\neasily able, even unaided, to paralyse any war immediately and\r\nautomatically. The pioneers in the movement have played the same part as\r\nwas played in the seventeenth century by the Quakers. In the name of the\r\nBible and their own consciences, the Quakers refused to recognize the\r\nright of any secular authority to compel them to worship or to fight;\r\nthey gained what they struggled for, and now all men honour their\r\nmemories. In the name of justice and human fraternity, the\r\nanti-militarists are to-day taking the like course and suffering the\r\nlike penalties. To-morrow, they also will be revered as heroes and\r\nmartyrs.\r\n\r\n(6) _The Over-growth of Armaments._ The hostile forces so far enumerated\r\nhave converged slowly on to war from such various directions that they\r\nmay be said to have surrounded and isolated it; its ultimate surrender\r\ncan only be a matter of time. Of late, however, a new factor has\r\nappeared, of so urgent a character that it is fast rendering the\r\nquestion of the abolition of war acute: the over-growth of armaments.\r\nThis is, practically, a modern factor in the situation, and while it is,\r\non the surface, a luxury due to the large surplus of wealth in great\r\nmodern states, it is also, if we look a little deeper, intimately\r\nconnected with that decay of the warlike spirit due to selective\r\nbreeding. It is the weak and timid woman who looks nervously under the\r\nbed for the burglar who is the last person she really desires to meet,\r\nand it is old, rich, and unwarlike nations which take the lead in\r\nlaboriously protecting themselves against enemies of whom there is no\r\nsign in any quarter. Within the last half-century only have the nations\r\nof the world begun to compete with each other in this timorous and\r\ncostly rivalry. In the warlike days of old, armaments in time of peace\r\nconsisted in little more than solid walls for defence, a supply of\r\nweapons stored away here and there, sometimes in a room attached to the\r\nparish church, and occasional martial exercises with the sword or the\r\nbow, which were little more than an amusement. The true fighting man\r\ntrusted to his own strong right arm rather than to armaments, and\r\nconsidered that he was himself a match for any half-dozen of the enemy.\r\nEven in actual time of war it was often difficult to find either zeal or\r\nmoney to supply the munitions of war. The _Diary_ of the industrious\r\nPepys, who achieved so much for the English navy, shows that the care of\r\nthe country's ships mainly depended on a few unimportant officials who\r\nhad the greatest trouble in the world to secure attention to the most\r\nurgent and immediate needs.\r\n\r\nA very difficult state of things prevails to-day. The existence of a\r\nparty having for its watchword the cry for retrenchment and economy is\r\nscarcely possible in a modern state. All the leading political parties\r\nin every great state--if we leave aside the party of Labour--are equally\r\neager to pile up the expenditure on armaments. It is the boast of each\r\nparty, not that it spends less, but more, than its rivals on this source\r\nof expenditure, now the chief in every large state. Moreover, every new\r\nstep in expenditure involves a still further step; each new improvement\r\nin attack or defence must immediately be answered by corresponding or\r\nbetter improvements on the part of rival powers, if they are not to be\r\noutclassed. Every year these moves and counter-moves necessarily become\r\nmore extensive, more complex, more costly; while each counter-move\r\ninvolves the obsolescence of the improvements achieved by the previous\r\nmove, so that the waste of energy and money keeps pace with the\r\nexpenditure. It is well recognized that there is absolutely no possible\r\nlimit to this process and its constantly increasing acceleration.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to illustrate this point, for it is familiar to all.\r\nAny newspaper will furnish facts and figures vividly exemplifying some\r\naspect of the matter. For while only a handful of persons in any country\r\nare sincerely anxious under present conditions to reduce the colossal\r\nsums every year wasted on the unproductive work of armament; an\r\nincreasing interest in the matter testifies to a vague alarm and anxiety\r\nconcerning the ultimate issue. For it is felt that an inevitable crisis\r\nlies at the end of the path down which the nations are now moving.\r\n\r\nThus, from this point of view, the end of war is being attained by a\r\nprocess radically opposite to that by which in the social as well as in\r\nthe physical organism ancient structures and functions are outgrown. The\r\nusual process is a gradual recession to a merely vestigial state. But\r\nhere what may perhaps be the same ultimate result is being reached by\r\nthe more alarming method of over-inflation and threatening collapse. It\r\nis an alarming process because those huge and heavily armed monsters of\r\nprimeval days who furnish the zoological types corresponding to our\r\nmodern over-armed states, themselves died out from the world when their\r\nunwieldy armament had reached its final point of expansion. Will our own\r\nmodern states, one wonders, more fortunately succeed in escaping from\r\nthe tough hides that ever more closely constrict them, and finally save\r\ntheir souls alive?\r\n\r\n(7) _The Dominance of Social Reform._ The final factor in the situation\r\nis the growing dominance of the process of social reform. On the one\r\nhand, the increasing complexity of social organisation renders necessary\r\na correspondingly increasing expenditure of money in diminishing its\r\nfriction and aiding its elaboration; on the other hand, the still more\r\nrapidly increasing demands of armament render it ever more difficult to\r\ndevote money to such social purposes. Everywhere even the most\r\nelementary provision for the finer breeding and higher well-being of a\r\ncountry's citizens is postponed to the clamour for ever new armaments.\r\nThe situation thus created is rapidly becoming intolerable.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone the future of civilization which is for ever menaced by\r\nthe possibility of war; the past of civilization, with all the precious\r\nembodiments of its traditions, is even more fatally imperilled. As the\r\nworld grows older and the ages recede, the richer, the more precious,\r\nthe more fragile, become the ancient heirlooms of humanity. They\r\nconstitute the final symbols of human glory; they cannot be too\r\ncarefully guarded, too highly valued. But all the other dangers that\r\nthreaten their integrity and safety, if put together, do not equal war.\r\nNo land that has ever been a cradle of civilization but bears witness to\r\nthis sad truth. All the sacred citadels, the glories of\r\nhumanity,--Jerusalem and Athens, Rome and Constantinople,--have been\r\nravaged by war, and, in every case, their ruin has been a disaster that\r\ncan never be repaired. If we turn to the minor glories of more modern\r\nages, the special treasure of England has been its parish churches, a\r\ntreasure of unique charm in the world and the embodiment of the\r\npeople's spirit: to-day in their battered and irreparable condition they\r\nare the monuments of a Civil War waged all over the country with\r\nruthless religious ferocity. Spain, again, was a land which had stored\r\nup, during long centuries, nearly the whole of its accumulated\r\npossessions in every art, sacred and secular, of fabulous value, within\r\nthe walls of its great fortress-like cathedrals; Napoleon's soldiers\r\nover-ran the land, and brought with them rapine and destruction; so that\r\nin many a shrine, as at Montserrat, we still can see how in a few days\r\nthey turned a Paradise into a desert. It is not only the West that has\r\nsuffered. In China the rarest and loveliest wares and fabrics that the\r\nhand of man has wrought were stored in the Imperial Palace of Pekin; the\r\nsavage military hordes of the West broke in less than a century ago and\r\nrecklessly trampled down and fired all that they could not loot. In\r\nevery such case the loss is final; the exquisite incarnation of some\r\nstage in the soul of man that is for ever gone is permanently\r\ndiminished, deformed, or annihilated.\r\n\r\nAt the present time all civilized countries are becoming keenly aware of\r\nthe value of their embodied artistic possessions. This is shown, in the\r\nmost decisive manner possible, by the enormous prices placed upon them.\r\nTheir pecuniary value enables even the stupidest and most unimaginative\r\nto realize the crime that is committed when they are ruthlessly and\r\nwantonly destroyed. Nor is it only the products of ancient art which\r\nhave to-day become so peculiarly valuable. The products of modern\r\nscience are only less valuable. So highly complex and elaborate is the\r\nmechanism now required to ensure progress in some of the sciences that\r\nenormous sums of money, the most delicate skill, long periods of time,\r\nare necessary to produce it. Galileo could replace his telescope with\r\nbut little trouble; the destruction of a single modern observatory would\r\nbe almost a calamity to the human race.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations as these are, indeed, at last recognized in all\r\ncivilized countries. The engines of destruction now placed at the\r\nservice of war are vastly more potent than any used in the wars of the\r\npast. On the other hand, the value of the products they can destroy is\r\nraised in a correspondingly high degree. But a third factor is now\r\nintervening. And if the museums of Paris or the laboratories of Berlin\r\nwere threatened by a hostile army it would certainly be felt that an\r\ninternational power, if it existed, should be empowered to intervene, at\r\nwhatever cost to national susceptibilities, in order to keep the peace.\r\nCivilization, we now realize, is wrought out of inspirations and\r\ndiscoveries which are for ever passed and repassed from land to land; it\r\ncannot be claimed by any individual land. A nation's art-products and\r\nits scientific activities are not mere national property; they are\r\ninternational possessions, for the joy and service of the whole world.\r\nThe nations hold them in trust for humanity. The international force\r\nwhich will inspire respect for that truth it is our business to create.\r\n\r\nThe only question that remains--and it is a question the future alone\r\nwill solve--is the particular point at which this ancient and overgrown\r\nstronghold of war, now being invested so vigorously from so many sides,\r\nwill finally be overthrown, whether from within or from without, whether\r\nby its own inherent weakness, by the persuasive reasonableness of\r\ndeveloping civilization, by the self-interest of the commercial and\r\nfinancial classes, or by the ruthless indignation of the proletariat.\r\nThat is a problem still insoluble, but it is not impossible that some\r\nalready living may witness its solution.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries ago the Abbe de Saint-Pierre set forth his scheme for a\r\nfederation of the States of Europe, which meant, at that time, a\r\nfederation of all the civilised states of the world. It was the age of\r\ngreat ideas, scattered abroad to germinate in more practical ages to\r\ncome. The amiable Abbe enjoyed all the credit of his large and\r\nphilanthropic conceptions. But no one dreamed of realizing them, and the\r\nforces which alone could realize them had not yet appeared above the\r\nhorizon.[233] In this matter, at all events, the world has progressed,\r\nand a federation of the States of the world is no longer the mere\r\nconception of a philosophic dreamer. The first step will be taken when\r\ntwo of the leading countries of the world--and it would be most\r\nreasonable for the states having the closest community of origin and\r\nlanguage to take the initiative--resolve to submit all their differences\r\nwithout reserve to arbitration. As soon as a third power of magnitude\r\njoined this federation the nucleus would be constituted of a world\r\nstate. Such a state would be able to impose peace on even the most\r\nrecalcitrant outside states, for it would furnish that \"visible power to\r\nkeep them in awe,\" which Hobbes rightly declared to be indispensable; it\r\ncould even, in the last resort, if necessary, enforce peace by war. Thus\r\nthere might still be war in the world. But there would be no wars that\r\nwere not Holy Wars. There are other methods than war of enforcing peace,\r\nand these such a federation of great states would be easily able to\r\nbring to bear on even the most warlike of states, but the necessity of a\r\nmighty armed international force would remain for a long time to come.\r\nTo suppose, as some seem to suppose, that the establishment of\r\narbitration in place of war means immediate disarmament is an idle\r\ndream. At Conferences of the English Labour Party on this question, the\r\nmost active opposition to the proposed strike method for rendering war\r\nimpossible comes from the delegates representing the workers in arsenals\r\nand dockyards. But there is no likelihood of arsenals and dockyards\r\nclosing in the lifetime of the present workers, and though the\r\nestablishment of peaceful methods of settling international disputes\r\ncannot fail to diminish the number of the workers who live by armament,\r\nit will be long before they can be dispensed with altogether.\r\n\r\n[1] The Abbe de Saint-Pierre (1658-1743), a churchman without vocation,\r\nwas a Norman of noble family, and first published his _Memoires pour\r\nrendre la Paix Perpetuelle a l'Europe_ in 1722. As Siegler-Pascal well\r\nshows (_Les Projets de l'Abbe de Saint-Pierre_, 1900) he was not a mere\r\nvisionary Utopian, but an acute and far-seeing thinker, practical in his\r\nmethods, a close observer, an experimentalist, and one of the first to\r\nattempt the employment of statistics. He was secretary to the French\r\nplenipotentiaries who negotiated the Treaty of Utrecht, and was thus\r\nprobably put on the track of his scheme. He proposed that the various\r\nEuropean states should name plenipotentiaries to form a permanent\r\ntribunal of compulsory arbitration for the settlement of all\r\ndifferences. If any state took up arms against one of the allies, the\r\nwhole confederation would conjointly enter the field, at their conjoint\r\nexpense, against the offending state. He was opposed to absolute\r\ndisarmament, an army being necessary to ensure peace, but it must be a\r\njoint army composed of contingents from each Power in the confederation.\r\nSaint-Pierre, it will be seen, had clearly grasped the essential facts\r\nof the situation as we see them to-day. \"The author of _The Project of\r\nPerpetual Peace_\" concludes Prof. Pierre Robert in a sympathetic summary\r\nof his career (Petit de Julleville, _Histoire de la Langue et de la\r\nLitterature Francaise_, Vol. VI), \"is the precursor of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\" His statue, we cannot doubt, will be a conspicuous object,\r\nbeside Sully's, on the future Palace of any international tribunal.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, so common to regard the person who points out the\r\ninevitable bankruptcy of war under highly civilized conditions as a mere\r\nUtopian dreamer, that it becomes necessary to repeat, with all the\r\nemphasis necessary, that the settlement of international disputes by law\r\ncannot be achieved by disarmament, or by any method not involving force.\r\nAll law, even the law that settles the disputes of individuals, has\r\nforce behind it, and the law that is to settle the disputes between\r\nnations cannot possibly be effective unless it has behind it a mighty\r\nforce. I have assumed this from the outset in quoting the dictum of\r\nHobbes, but the point seems to be so easily overlooked by the loose\r\nthinker that it is necessary to reiterate it. The necessity of force\r\nbehind the law ordering international relations has, indeed, never been\r\ndisputed by any sagacious person who has occupied himself with the\r\nmatter. Even William Penn, who, though a Quaker, was a practical man of\r\naffairs, when in 1693 he put forward his _Essay Towards the Present and\r\nFuture Peace of Europe by the Establishment of a European Diet,\r\nParliament or Estate_, proposed that if any imperial state refused to\r\nsubmit its pretensions to the sovereign assembly and to abide by its\r\ndecisions, or took up arms on its own behalf, \"all the other\r\nsovereignties, united as one strength, shall compel the submission and\r\nperformance of the sentence, with damages to the suffering party, and\r\ncharges to the sovereignties that obliged their submission.\" In\r\nrepudiating some injudicious and hazardous pacificist considerations put\r\nforth by Novikov, the distinguished French philosopher, Jules de\r\nGaultier, points out that law has no rights against war save in force,\r\non which war itself bases its rights. \"Force _in abstracto_ creates\r\nright. It is quite unimaginable that a right should exist which has not\r\nbeen affirmed at some moment as a reality, that is to say a force....\r\nWhat we glorify under the name of right is only a more intense and\r\nhabitual state of force which we oppose to a less frequent form of\r\nforce.\"[234] The old Quaker and the modern philosopher are thus at one\r\nwith the practical man in rejecting any form of pacification which rests\r\non a mere appeal to reason and justice.\r\n\r\n[1] Jules de Gaultier, \"Comment Naissent les Dogmes,\" _Mercure de\r\nFrance_, 1st Sept., 1911. Jules de Gaultier also observes that \"conflict\r\nis the law and condition of all existence.\" That may be admitted, but it\r\nceases to be true if we assume, as the same thinker assumes, that\r\n\"conflict\" necessarily involves \"war.\" The establishment of law to\r\nregulate the disputes between individuals by no means suppresses\r\nconflict, but it suppresses fighting, and it ensures that if any\r\nfighting occur the aggressor shall not profit by his aggression. In the\r\nsame way the existence of a tribunal to regulate the disputes between\r\nnational communities of individuals can by no means suppress conflict;\r\nbut unless it suppresses fighting, and unless it ensures that if\r\nfighting occurs the aggressor shall not profit by his aggression, it\r\nwill have effected nothing.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the progress of civilization has so far had any\r\ntendency to render unnecessary the point of view adopted by Penn and\r\nJules de Gaultier. The acts of states to-day are apt to be just as\r\nwantonly aggressive as they ever were, as reckless of reason and of\r\njustice. There is no country, however high it may stand in the comity of\r\nnations, which is not sometimes carried away by the blind fever of war.\r\nFrance, the land of reason, echoed, only forty years ago, with the mad\r\ncry, \"A Berlin!\" England, the friend of the small nationalities,\r\njubilantly, with even an air of heroism, crushed under foot the little\r\nSouth African Republics, and hounded down every Englishman who withstood\r\nthe madness of the crowd. The great, free intelligent people of the\r\nUnited States went to war against Spain with a childlike faith in the\r\npreposterous legend of the blowing up of the _Maine_. There is no\r\ncountry which has not some such shameful page in its history, the record\r\nof some moment when its moral and intellectual prestige was besmirched\r\nin the eyes of the whole world. It pays for its momentary madness, it\r\nmay valiantly strive to atone for its injustice, but the damaging record\r\nremains. The supersession of war is needed not merely in the interests\r\nof the victims of aggression; it is needed fully as much in the\r\ninterests of the aggressors, driven by their own momentary passions, or\r\nby the ambitious follies of their rulers, towards crimes for which a\r\nterrible penalty is exacted. There has never been any country at every\r\nmoment so virtuous and so wise that it has not sometimes needed to be\r\nsaved from itself. For every country has sometimes gone mad, while\r\nevery other country has looked on its madness with the mocking calm of\r\nclear-sighted intelligence, and perhaps with a pharisaical air of\r\nvirtuous indignation.\r\n\r\nDuring the single year of 1911 the process was unrolled in its most\r\ncomplete form. The first bad move--though it was a relatively small and\r\ninoffensive move--was made by France. The Powers, after much\r\ndeliberation, had come to certain conclusions concerning Morocco, and\r\nwhile giving France a predominant influence in that country, had\r\ncarefully limited her power of action. But France, anxious to increase\r\nher hold on the land, sent out, with the usual pretexts, an unnecessary\r\nexpedition to Fez. Had an international tribunal with an adequate force\r\nbehind it been in existence, France would have been called upon to\r\njustify her action, and whether she succeeded or failed in such\r\njustification, no further evils would have occurred. But there was no\r\nforce able or willing to call France to account, and the other Powers\r\nfound it a simpler plan to follow her example than to check it. In\r\npursuance of this policy, Germany sent a warship to the Moroccan port of\r\nAgadir, using the same pretext as the French, with even less\r\njustification. When the supreme military power of the world wags even a\r\nfinger the whole world is thrown into a state of consternation. That\r\nhappened on the present occasion, though, as a matter of fact, giants\r\nare not given to reckless violence, and Germany, far from intending to\r\nbreak the world's peace, merely used her power to take advantage of\r\nFrance's bad move. She agreed to condone France's mistake, and to resign\r\nto her the Moroccan rights to which neither country had the slightest\r\nlegitimate claim, in return for an enormous tract of land in another\r\npart of Africa. Now, so far, the game had been played in accordance with\r\nrules which, though by no means those of abstract justice, were fairly\r\nin accordance with the recognized practices of nations. But now another\r\nPower was moved to far more openly unscrupulous action. It has long been\r\nrecognized that if there must be a partition of North Africa, Italy's\r\nshare is certainly Tripoli. The action of France and of Germany stirred\r\nup in Italy the feeling that now or never was the moment for action, and\r\nwith brutal recklessness, and the usual pretexts, now flimsier than\r\never, Italy made war on Turkey, without offer of mediation, in flagrant\r\nviolation of her own undertakings at the Hague Peace Convention of 1899.\r\nThere was now only one Mohammedan country left to attack, and it was\r\nRussia's turn to make the attack. Northern Persia--the most civilized\r\nand fruitful half of Persia--had been placed under the protection of\r\nRussia, and Russia, after cynically doing her best to make good\r\ngovernment in Persia impossible, seized on the pretext of the bad\r\ngovernment to invade the country. If the Powers of Europe had wished to\r\ndemonstrate the necessity for a great international tribunal, with a\r\nmighty force behind it to ensure the observance of its decisions, they\r\ncould not have devised a more effective demonstration.\r\n\r\nThus it is that there can be no question of disarmament at present, and\r\nthat there can be no effective international tribunal unless it has\r\nbehind it an effective army. A great army must continue to exist apart\r\naltogether from the question as to whether the army in itself is a\r\nschool of virtue or of vice. Both these views of its influence have been\r\nheld in extreme forms, and both seem to be without any great\r\njustification. On this point we may perhaps accept the conclusion of\r\nProfessor Guerard, who can view the matter from a fairly impartial\r\nstandpoint, having served in the French army, closely studied the life\r\nof the people in London, and occupied a professorial chair in\r\nCalifornia. He denies that an army is a school of all the vices, but he\r\nis also unable to see that it exercises an elevating influence on any\r\nbut the lowest: \"A regiment is not much worse than a big factory.\r\nFactory life in Europe is bad enough; military service extends its evils\r\nto agricultural labourers, and also to men who would otherwise have\r\nescaped these lowering influences. As for traces of moral uplift in the\r\narmy, I have totally failed to notice any. War may be a stern school of\r\nvirtue; barrack life is not. Honour, duty, patriotism, are feelings\r\ninstilled at school; they do not develop, but often deteriorate, during\r\nthe term of compulsory service.\"[235]\r\n\r\nBut, as we have seen, and as Guerard admits, it is probable that wars\r\nwill be abolished generations before armies are suppressed. The question\r\narises what we are to do with our armies. There seem to be at least two\r\nways in which armies may be utilized, as we may already see in France,\r\nand perhaps to some slight extent in England. In the first place, the\r\narmy may be made a great educational agency, an academy of arts and\r\nsciences, a school of citizenship. In the second place, armies are\r\ntending to become, as William James pointed out, the reserve force of\r\npeace, great organized unemployed bodies of men which can be brought\r\ninto use during sudden emergencies and national disasters. Thus the\r\nFrench army performed admirable service during the great Seine floods a\r\nfew years ago, and both in France and in England the army has been\r\ncalled upon to help to carry on public duties indispensable to the\r\nwelfare of the nation during great strikes, though here it would be\r\nunfortunate if the army came to be regarded as a mere strike-breaking\r\ncorps. Along these main lines, however, there are, as Guerard has\r\npointed out, signs of a transformation which, while preserving armies\r\nfor international use, yet point to a compromise between the army and\r\nmodern democracy.\r\n\r\nIt is feared by some that the reign of universal peace will deprive them\r\nof the opportunity of exhibiting daring and heroism. Without inquiring\r\ntoo carefully what use has been made of their present opportunities by\r\nthose who express this fear, it must be said that such a fear is\r\naltogether groundless. There are an infinite number of positions in life\r\nin which courage is needed, as much as on a battlefield, though, for the\r\nmost part, with less risk of that total annihilation which in the past\r\nhas done so much to breed out the courageous stocks. Moreover, the\r\ncertain establishment of peace will immensely enlarge the scope for\r\ndaring and adventure in the social sphere. There are departments in the\r\nhigher breeding and social evolution of the race--some perhaps even\r\ninvolving questions of life and death--where the highest courage is\r\nneeded. It would be premature to discuss them, for they can scarcely\r\nenter the field of practical politics until war has been abolished. But\r\nthose persons who are burning to display heroism may rest assured that\r\nthe course of social evolution will offer them every opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[221] The respective parts of war and law in the constitution of states\r\nare clearly and concisely set forth by Edward Jenks in his little\r\nprimer, _A History of Politics_. Steinmetz, who argues in favour of the\r\npreservation of the method of war, in his book _Die Philosophie des\r\nKrieges_ (p. 303) states that \"not a single element of the warlike\r\nspirit, not one of the psychic conditions of war, is lacking to the\r\ncivilized European peoples of to-day.\" That may well be, although there\r\nis much reason to believe that they have all very considerably\r\ndiminished. Such warlike spirit as exists to-day must be considerably\r\ndiscounted by the fact that those who manifest it are not usually the\r\npeople who would actually have to do the fighting. It is more important\r\nto point out (as is done in a historical sketch of warfare by A.\r\nSutherland, _Nineteenth Century_, April, 1899) that, as a matter of\r\nfact, war is becoming both less frequent and less ferocious. In England,\r\nfor instance, where at one period the population spent a great part of\r\ntheir time in fighting, there has practically been no war for two and a\r\nhalf centuries. When the ancient Germans swept through Spain (as\r\nProcopius, who was an eye-witness, tells) they slew every human being\r\nthey met, including women and children, until millions had perished. The\r\nlaws of war, though not always observed, are constantly growing more\r\nhumane, and Sutherland estimates that warfare is now less than\r\none-hundredth part as destructive as it was in the early Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[222] This inevitable extension of the sphere of law from the settlement\r\nof disputes between individuals to disputes between individual states\r\nhas been pointed out before, and is fairly obvious. Thus\r\nMougins-Roquefort, a French lawyer, in his book _De la Solution\r\nJuridique des Conflits Internationaux_ (1889), observes that in the\r\ndays of the Roman Empire, when there was only one civilized state, any\r\nsystem of international relationships was impossible, but that as soon\r\nas we have a number of states forming units of international society\r\nthere at once arises the necessity for a system of international\r\nrelationships, just as some system of social order is necessary to\r\nregulate the relations of any community of individuals.\r\n\r\n[223] In England, a small and compact country, this process was completed\r\nat a comparatively early date. In France it was not until the days of\r\nLouis XV (in 1756) that the \"last feudal brigand,\" as Taine calls the\r\nMarquis de Pleumartin in Poitou, was captured and beheaded.\r\n\r\n[224] France, notwithstanding her military aptitude, has always taken the\r\npioneering part in the pacific movement of civilization. Even at the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century France produced an advocate of\r\ninternational arbitration, Pierre Dubois (Petrus de Bosco), the Norman\r\nlawyer, a pupil of Thomas Aquinas. In the seventeenth century Emeric\r\nCruce proposed, for the first time, to admit all peoples, without\r\ndistinction of colour or religion, to be represented at some central\r\ncity where every state would have its perpetual ambassador, these\r\nrepresentatives forming an assembly to adjudicate on international\r\ndifferences (Dubois and Cruce have lately been studied by Prof.\r\nVesnitch, _Revue d'Histoire Diplomatique_, January, 1911). The history\r\nof the various peace projects generally has been summarily related by\r\nLagorgette in _Le Role de la Guerre_, 1906, Part IV, chap. VI.\r\n\r\n[225] The same points had previously been brought forward by others,\r\nalthough not so vigorously enforced. Thus the well-known Belgian\r\neconomist and publicist, Emile de Laveleye, pointed out (_Pall Mall\r\nGazette_, 4th August, 1888) that \"the happiest countries are\r\nincontestably the smallest: Switzerland, Norway, Luxembourg, and still\r\nmore the Republics of San Marino and Val d'Andorre\"; and that \"countries\r\nin general, even when victorious, do not profit by their conquests.\"\r\n\r\n[226] Bismarck himself declared that without the deep shame of the German\r\ndefeat at Jena in 1806 the revival of German national feeling would have\r\nbeen impossible.\r\n\r\n[227] D. Starr Jordan, The Human Harvest, 1907; J. Novikov, La Guerre et\r\nses Pretendus Bienfaits, 1894, chap. IV; Novikov here argued that the\r\nselection of war eliminates not the feeble but the strong, and tends to\r\nproduce, therefore, a survival of the unfittest.\r\n\r\n[228] \"The most demoralizing features in French military life,\" says\r\nProfessor Guerard, a highly intelligent observer, \"are due to an\r\nincontestable progress in the French mind--its gradual loss of faith and\r\ninterest in military glory. Henceforth the army is considered as\r\nuseless, dangerous, a burden without a compensation. Authors of school\r\nbooks may be censured for daring to print such opinions, but the great\r\nmajority of the French hold them in their hearts. Nay, there is a\r\nprevailing suspicion among working men that the military establishment\r\nis kept up for the sole benefit of the capitalists, and the reckless use\r\nof troops in case of labour conflicts gives colour to the contention.\"\r\nIt has often happened that what the French think to-day the world\r\ngenerally thinks to-morrow. There is probably a world-wide significance\r\nin the fact that French experience is held to show that progress in\r\nintelligence means the demoralization of the army.\r\n\r\n[229] The influence of Syndicalism has, however, already reached the\r\nEnglish Labour Movement, and an ill-advised prosecution by the English\r\nGovernment must have immensely aided in extending and fortifying that\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n[230] Some small beginnings have already been made. \"The greatest gain\r\never yet won for the cause of peace,\" writes Mr. H.W. Nevinson, the\r\nwell-known war correspondent (_Peace and War in the Balance_, p. 47),\r\n\"was the refusal of the Catalonian reservists to serve in the war\r\nagainst the Riff mountaineers of Morocco in July, 1909.... So Barcelona\r\nflared to heaven, and for nearly a week the people held the vast city. I\r\nhave seen many noble, as well as many terrible, events, but none more\r\nnoble or of finer promise than the sudden uprising of the Catalan\r\nworking people against a dastardly and inglorious war, waged for the\r\nbenefit of a few speculators in Paris and Madrid.\"\r\n\r\n[231] J. Novikov, _Le Federation de l'Europe_, chap. iv. Olive Schreiner,\r\n_Woman and Labour_, chap. IV. While this is the fundamental fact, we\r\nmust remember that we cannot generalize about the ideas or the feelings\r\nof a whole sex, and that the biological traditions of women have been\r\nassociated with a primitive period when they were the delighted\r\nspectators of combats. \"Woman,\" thought Nietzsche, \"is essentially\r\nunpeaceable, like the cat, however well she may have assumed the\r\npeaceable demeanour.\" Steinmetz (_Philosophie des Krieges_, p. 314),\r\nremarking that women are opposed to war in the abstract, adds: \"In\r\npractice, however, it happens that women regard a particular war--and\r\nall wars are particular wars--with special favour\"; he remarks that the\r\nmajority of Englishwomen fully shared the war fever against the Boers,\r\nand that, on the other side, he knew Dutch ladies in Holland, very\r\nopposed to war, who would yet have danced with joy at that time on the\r\nnews of a declaration of war against England.\r\n\r\n[232] The general strike, which has been especially developed by the\r\nsyndicalist Labour movement, and is now tending to spread to various\r\ncountries, is a highly powerful weapon, so powerful that its results are\r\nnot less serious than those of war. To use it against war seems to be to\r\ncast out Beelzebub by Beelzebub. Even in Labour disputes the modern\r\nstrike threatens to become as serious and, indeed, almost as sanguinary\r\nas the civil wars of ancient times. The tendency is, therefore, in\r\nprogressive countries, as we see in Australia, to supersede strikes by\r\nconciliation and arbitration, just as war is tending to be superseded by\r\ninternational tribunals. These two aims are, however, absolutely\r\ndistinct, and the introduction of law into the disputes between nations\r\ncan have no direct effect on the disputes between social classes. It is\r\nquite possible, however, that it may have an indirect effect, and that\r\nwhen disputes between nations are settled in an orderly manner, social\r\nfeeling will forbid disputes between classes to be settled in a\r\ndisorderly manner.\r\n\r\n[233] The Abbe de Saint-Pierre (1658-1743), a churchman without vocation,\r\nwas a Norman of noble family, and first published his Memoires pour\r\nrendre la Paix Perpetuelle a l'Europe in 1722. As Siegler-Pascal well\r\nshows (Les Projets de l'Abbe de Saint-Pierre, 1900) he was not a mere\r\nvisionary Utopian, but an acute and far-seeing thinker, practical in his\r\nmethods, a close observer, an experimentalist, and one of the first to\r\nattempt the employment of statistics. He was secretary to the French\r\nplenipotentiaries who negotiated the Treaty of Utrecht, and was thus\r\nprobably put on the track of his scheme. He proposed that the various\r\nEuropean states should name plenipotentiaries to form a permanent\r\ntribunal of compulsory arbitration for the settlement of all\r\ndifferences. If any state took up arms against one of the allies, the\r\nwhole confederation would conjointly enter the field, at their conjoint\r\nexpense, against the offending state. He was opposed to absolute\r\ndisarmament, an army being necessary to ensure peace, but it must be a\r\njoint army composed of contingents from each Power in the confederation.\r\nSaint-Pierre, it will be seen, had clearly grasped the essential facts\r\nof the situation as we see them to-day. \"The author of The Project of\r\nPerpetual Peace\" concludes Prof. Pierre Robert in a sympathetic summary\r\nof his career (Petit de Julleville, Histoire de la Langue et de la\r\nLitterature Francaise, Vol. VI), \"is the precursor of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\" His statue, we cannot doubt, will be a conspicuous object,\r\nbeside Sully's, on the future Palace of any international tribunal.\r\n\r\n[234] Jules de Gaultier, \"Comment Naissent les Dogmes,\" Mercure de\r\nFrance, 1st Sept., 1911. Jules de Gaultier also observes that \"conflict\r\nis the law and condition of all existence.\" That may be admitted, but it\r\nceases to be true if we assume, as the same thinker assumes, that\r\n\"conflict\" necessarily involves \"war.\" The establishment of law to\r\nregulate the disputes between individuals by no means suppresses\r\nconflict, but it suppresses fighting, and it ensures that if any\r\nfighting occur the aggressor shall not profit by his aggression. In the\r\nsame way the existence of a tribunal to regulate the disputes between\r\nnational communities of individuals can by no means suppress conflict;\r\nbut unless it suppresses fighting, and unless it ensures that if\r\nfighting occurs the aggressor shall not profit by his aggression, it\r\nwill have effected nothing.\r\n\r\n[235] A.L. Guerard, \"Impressions of Military Life in France,\" _Popular\r\nScience Monthly_, April, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE\r\n\r\n     Early Attempts to Construct an International Language--The Urgent\r\n     Need of an Auxiliary Language To-day--Volapuek--The Claims of\r\n     Spanish--Latin--The Claims of English--Its Disadvantages--The\r\n     Claims of French--Its Disadvantages--The Modern Growth of National\r\n     Feeling opposed to Selection of a Natural Language--Advantages of\r\n     an Artificial Language--Demands it must fulfil--Esperanto--Its\r\n     Threatened Disruption--The International Association for the\r\n     adoption of an Auxiliary International Language--The First Step to\r\n     Take.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since the decay of Latin as the universal language of educated\r\npeople, there have been attempts to replace it by some other medium of\r\ninternational communication. That decay was inevitable; it was the\r\noutward manifestation of a movement of individualism which developed\r\nnational languages and national literatures, and burst through the\r\nrestraining envelope of an authoritarian system expounded in an official\r\nlanguage. This individualism has had the freest play, and we are not\r\nlikely to lose all that it has given us. Yet as soon as it was achieved\r\nthe more distinguished spirits in every country began to feel the need\r\nof counterbalancing it. The history of the movement may be said to begin\r\nwith Descartes, who in 1629 wrote to his friend Mersenne that it would\r\nbe possible to construct an artificial language which could be used as\r\nan international medium of communication. Leibnitz, though he had solved\r\nthe question for himself, writing some of his works in Latin and others\r\nin French, was yet all his life more or less occupied with the question\r\nof a universal language. Other men of the highest distinction--Pascal,\r\nCondillac, Voltaire, Diderot, Ampere, Jacob Grimm--have sought or\r\ndesired a solution to this problem.[236] None of these great men, however,\r\nsucceeded even in beginning an attempt to solve the problem they were\r\nconcerned with.\r\n\r\nSome forty years ago, however, the difficulty began again to be felt,\r\nthis time much more keenly and more widely than before. The spread of\r\ncommerce, the facility of travel, the ramifications of the postal\r\nservice, the development of new nationalities and new literatures, have\r\nlaid upon civilized peoples a sense of burden and restriction which\r\ncould never have been felt by their forefathers in the previous century.\r\nAdded to this, a new sense of solidarity had been growing up in the\r\nworld; the financial and commercial solidarity, by which any disaster or\r\ndisturbance in one country causes a wave of disaster or disturbance to\r\npass over the whole civilized globe, was being supplemented by a sense\r\nof spiritual solidarity. Men began to realize that the tasks of\r\ncivilization cannot be carried out except by mutual understanding and\r\nmutual sympathy among the more civilized nations, that every nation has\r\nsomething to learn from other nations, and that the bonds of\r\ninternational intercourse must thus be drawn closer. This feeling of the\r\nneed of an international language led in America to several serious\r\nattempts to obtain a consensus of opinion among scientific men regarding\r\nan international language. Thus in 1888 the Philosophical Society of\r\nPhiladelphia, the oldest of American learned societies, unanimously\r\nresolved, on the initiative of Brinton, to address a letter to learned\r\nsocieties throughout the world, asking for their co-operation in\r\nperfecting a language for commercial and learned purposes, based on the\r\nAryan vocabulary and grammar in their simplest forms, and to that end\r\nproposing an international congress, the first meeting of which should\r\nbe held in Paris or London. In the same year Horatio Hale read a paper\r\non the same subject before the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science. A little later, in 1890, it was again proposed at a meeting\r\nof the same Association that, in order to consider the question of the\r\nconstruction and adoption of a symmetrical and scientific language, a\r\ncongress should be held, delegates being in proportion to the number of\r\npersons speaking each language.\r\n\r\nThese excellent proposals seem, however, to have borne little fruit. It\r\nis always an exceedingly difficult matter to produce combined action\r\namong scientific societies even of the same nation. Thus the way has\r\nbeen left open for individuals to adopt the easier but far less decisive\r\nor satisfactory method of inventing a new language by their own unaided\r\nexertions. Certainly over a hundred such languages have been proposed\r\nduring the past century. The most famous of these was undoubtedly\r\nVolapuek, which was invented in 1880 by Schleyer, a German-Swiss priest\r\nwho knew many languages and had long pondered over this problem, but who\r\nwas not a scientific philologist; the actual inception of the language\r\noccurred in a dream. Volapuek was almost the first real attempt at an\r\norganic language capable of being used for the oral transmission of\r\nthought. On this account, no doubt, it met with great and widespread\r\nsuccess; it was actively taken up by a professor at Paris, societies\r\nwere formed for its propagation, journals and hundreds of books were\r\npublished in it; its adherents were estimated at a million. But its\r\nsuccess, though brilliant, was short-lived. In 1889, when the third\r\nVolapuek Congress was held, it was at the height of its success, but\r\nthereafter dissension arose, and its reputation suddenly collapsed. No\r\none now speaks Volapuek; it is regarded as a hideous monstrosity, even by\r\nthose who have the most lively faith in artificial languages. Its\r\ninventor has outlived his language, and, like it, has been forgotten by\r\nthe world, though his achievement was a real step towards the solution\r\nof the problem.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Volapuek discouraged thoughtful persons from expecting\r\nany solution of the problem in an artificial language. It seemed\r\nextremely improbable that any invented language, least of all the\r\nunaided product of a single mind, could ever be generally accepted, or\r\nbe worthy of general acceptance, as an international mode of\r\ncommunication. Such a language failed to carry the prestige necessary to\r\novercome the immense inertia which any attempt to adopt it would meet\r\nwith. Invented languages, the visionary schemes of idealists, apparently\r\nreceived no support from practical men of affairs. It seemed to be among\r\nactual languages, living or dead, that we might most reasonably expect\r\nto find a medium of communication likely to receive wide support. The\r\ndifficulty then lay in deciding which language should be selected.\r\n\r\nRussian had sometimes been advocated as the universal language for\r\ninternational purposes, and it is possible to point to the enormous\r\nterritory of Russia, its growing power and the fact that Russian is the\r\nreal or official language of a larger number of people than any other\r\nlanguage except English. But Russian is so unlike the Latin and Teutonic\r\ntongues, used by the majority of European peoples; it is so complicated,\r\nso difficult to acquire, and, moreover, so lacking in concision that it\r\nhas never had many enthusiastic advocates.\r\n\r\nThe virtues and defects of Spanish, which has found many enthusiastic\r\nsupporters, are of an opposite character. It is an admirably vigorous\r\nand euphonious language, on a sound phonetic basis, every letter always\r\nstanding for a definite sound; the grammar is simple and exceptionally\r\nfree from irregularities, and it is the key to a great literature.\r\nBillroth, the distinguished Austrian surgeon, advocated the adoption of\r\nSpanish; he regarded English as really more suitable, but, he pointed\r\nout, it is so difficult for the Latin races to speak non-Latin tongues\r\nthat a Romance language is essential, and Spanish is the simplest and\r\nmost logical of the Romance tongues.[237] It is, moreover, spoken by a\r\nvast number of people in South America and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA few enthusiasts have advocated Greek, and have supported their claim\r\nwith the argument that it is still a living language. But although Greek\r\nis the key to a small but precious literature, and is one of the sources\r\nof latter-day speech and scientific terminology, it is difficult, it is\r\nwithout special adaptation to modern uses, and there are no adequate\r\nreasons why it should be made an international language.\r\n\r\nLatin cannot be dismissed quite so hastily. It has in its favour the\r\npowerful argument that it has once already been found adequate to serve\r\nas the universal language. There is a widespread opinion to-day among\r\nthe medical profession--the profession most actively interested in the\r\nestablishment of a universal language--that Latin should be adopted, and\r\nbefore the International Medical Congress at Rome in 1894, a petition to\r\nthis effect was presented by some eight hundred doctors in India.[238] It\r\nis undoubtedly an admirable language, expressive, concentrated, precise.\r\nBut the objections are serious. The relative importance of Latin to-day\r\nis very far from what it was a thousand years ago, for conditions have\r\nwholly changed. There is now no great influence, such as the Catholic\r\nChurch was of old, to enforce Latin, even if it possessed greater\r\nadvantages. And the advantages are very mixed. Latin is a wholly dead\r\ntongue, and except in a degenerate form not by any means an easy one to\r\nlearn, for its genius is wholly opposed to the genius even of those\r\nmodern languages which are most closely allied to it. The world never\r\nreturns on its own path. Although the prestige of Latin is still\r\nenormous, a language could only be brought from death to life by some\r\nwidespread motor force; such a force no longer exists behind Latin.\r\n\r\nThere remain English and French, and these are undoubtedly the two\r\nnatural languages most often put forward--even outside England and\r\nFrance--as possessing the best claims for adoption as auxiliary\r\ninternational mediums of communication.\r\n\r\nEnglish, especially, was claimed by many, some twenty years ago, to be\r\nnot merely the auxiliary language of the future, but the universal\r\nlanguage which must spread all over the world and supersede and drive\r\nout all others by a kind of survival of the fittest. This notion of a\r\nuniversal language is now everywhere regarded as a delusion, but at that\r\ntime there was still thought by many to be a kind of special procreative\r\nactivity in the communities of Anglo-Saxon origin which would naturally\r\ntend to replace all other peoples, both the people and the language\r\nbeing regarded as the fittest to survive.[239] English was, however,\r\nrightly felt to be a language with very great force behind it, being\r\nspoken by vast communities possessing a peculiarly energetic and\r\nprogressive temperament, and with much power of peaceful penetration in\r\nother lands. It is generally acknowledged also that English fully\r\ndeserves to be ranked as one of the first of languages by its fine\r\naptitude for powerful expression, while at the same time it is equally\r\nfitted for routine commercial purposes. The wide extension of English\r\nand its fine qualities have often been emphasized, and it is unnecessary\r\nto dwell on them here. The decision of the scientific societies of the\r\nworld to use English for bibliographical purposes is not entirely a\r\ntribute to English energy in organization, but to the quality of the\r\nlanguage. One finds, indeed, that these facts are widely recognized\r\nabroad, in France and elsewhere, though I have noted that those who\r\nforetell the conquest of English, even when they are men of intellectual\r\ndistinction and able to read English, are often quite unable to speak it\r\nor to understand it when spoken.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to a point which is overlooked by those who triumphantly\r\npointed to the natural settlement of this question by the swamping of\r\nother tongues in the overflowing tide of English speech. English is the\r\nmost concise and laconic of the great languages. Greek, French and\r\nGerman are all more expansive, more syllabically copious. Latin alone\r\nmay be said to equal, or surpass English in concentration, because,\r\nalthough Latin words are longer on the average, by their greater\r\ninflection they cover a larger number of English words. This power of\r\nEnglish to attain expression with a minimum expenditure of energy in\r\nwritten speech is one of its chief claims to succeed Latin as the\r\nauxiliary international language. But it furnishes no claim to\r\npreference for actual speaking, in which this economy of energy ceases\r\nto be a supreme virtue, since here we have also to admit the virtues of\r\neasy intelligibility and of persuasiveness. Greek largely owed its\r\nadmirable fitness for speech to the natural richness and prolongation of\r\nits euphonious words, which allowed the speaker to attain the legitimate\r\nutterance of his thought without pauses or superfluous repetition.\r\nFrench, again, while by no means inapt for concentration, as the\r\n_pensee_ writers show, most easily lends itself to effects that are\r\nmeant for speech, as in Bossuet, or that recall speech, as in Mme de\r\nSevigne in one order of literature, or Renan in another. But at Rome, we\r\nfeel, the spoken tongue had a difficulty to overcome, and the\r\nmellifluously prolonged rhetoric of Cicero, delightful as it may be,\r\nscarcely seems to reveal to us the genius of the Latin tongue. The\r\ninaptitude of English for the purposes of speech is even more\r\nconspicuous, and is again well illustrated in our oratory. Gladstone was\r\nan orator of acknowledged eloquence, but the extreme looseness and\r\nredundancy into which his language was apt to fall in the effort to\r\nattain the verbose richness required for the ends of spoken speech,\r\nreveals too clearly the poverty of English from this point of view. The\r\nsame tendency is also illustrated by the vain re-iterations of ordinary\r\nspeakers. The English intellect, with all its fine qualities, is not\r\nsufficiently nimble for either speaker or hearer to keep up with the\r\nswift brevity of the English tongue. It is a curious fact that Great\r\nBritain takes the lead in Europe in the prevalence of stuttering; the\r\nlanguage is probably a factor in this evil pre-eminence, for it appears\r\nthat the Chinese, whose language is powerfully rhythmic, never stutter.\r\nOne authority has declared that \"no nation in the civilized world speaks\r\nits language so abominably as the English.\" We can scarcely admit that\r\nthis English difficulty of speech is the result of some organic defect\r\nin English nervous systems; the language itself must be a factor in the\r\nmatter. I have found, when discussing the point with scientific men and\r\nothers abroad, that the opinion prevails that it is usually difficult to\r\nfollow a speaker in English. This experience may, indeed, be considered\r\ngeneral. While an admirably strong and concise language, English is by\r\nno means so adequate in actual speech; it is not one of the languages\r\nwhich can be heard at a long distance, and, moreover, it lends itself in\r\nspeaking to so many contractions that are not used in writing--so many\r\n\"can'ts\" and \"won'ts\" and \"don'ts,\" which suit English taciturnity, but\r\nslur and ruin English speech--that English, as spoken, is almost a\r\ndifferent language from that which excites admiration when written. So\r\nthat the exclusive use of English for international purposes would not\r\nbe the survival of the fittest so far as a language for speaking\r\npurposes is concerned.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it must be remembered that English is not a democratic\r\nlanguage. It is not, like the chief Romance languages and the chief\r\nTeutonic languages, practically homogeneous, made out of one block. It\r\nis formed by the mixture of two utterly unlike elements, one\r\naristocratic, the other plebeian. Ever since the Norman lord came over\r\nto England a profound social inequality has become rooted in the very\r\nlanguage. In French, _boeuf_ and _mouton_ and _veau_ and _porc_ have\r\nalways been the same for master and for man, in the field and on the\r\ntable; the animal has never changed its plebeian name for an\r\naristocratic name as it passed through the cook's hands. That example is\r\ntypical of the curious mark which the Norman Conquest left on our\r\nspeech, rendering it so much more difficult for us than for the French\r\nto attain equality of social intercourse. Inequality is stamped\r\nindelibly into our language as into no other great language. Of course,\r\nfrom the literary point of view, that is all gain, and has been of\r\nincomparable aid to our poets in helping them to reach their most\r\nmagnificent effects, as we may see conspicuously in Shakespeare's\r\nenormous vocabulary. But from the point of view of equal social\r\nintercourse, this wealth of language is worse than lost, it is\r\ndisastrous. The old feudal distinctions are still perpetuated; the \"man\"\r\nstill speaks his \"plain Anglo-Saxon,\" and the \"gentleman\" still speaks\r\nhis refined Latinized speech. In every language, it is true, there are\r\nsocial distinctions in speech, and every language has its slang. But in\r\nEnglish these distinctions are perpetuated in the very structure of the\r\nlanguage. Elsewhere the working-class speak--with a little difference in\r\nthe quality--a language needing no substantial transformation to become\r\nthe language of society, which differs from it in quality rather than in\r\nkind. But the English working man feels the need to translate his common\r\nAnglo-Saxon speech into foreign words of Latin origin. It is difficult\r\nfor the educated person in England to understand the struggle which the\r\nuneducated person goes through to speak the language of the educated,\r\nalthough the unsatisfactory result is sufficiently conspicuous. But we\r\ncan trace the operation of a similar cause in the hesitancy of the\r\neducated man himself when he attempts to speak in public and is\r\nembarrassed by the search for the set of words most suited for dignified\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nMost of those who regarded English as the coming world-language admitted\r\nthat it would require improvement for general use. The extensive and\r\nfundamental character of the necessary changes is not, however,\r\nrealized. The difficulties of English are of four kinds: (1) its special\r\nsounds, very troublesome for foreigners to learn to pronounce, and the\r\nuncertainty of its accentuation; (2) its illogical and chaotic spelling,\r\ninevitably leading to confusions in pronunciation; (3) the grammatical\r\nirregularities in its verbs and plural nouns; and (4) the great number\r\nof widely different words which are almost or quite similar in\r\npronunciation. A vast number of absurd pitfalls are thus prepared for\r\nthe unwary user of English. He must remember that the plural of \"mouse\"\r\nis \"mice,\" but that the plural of \"house\" is not \"hice,\" that he may\r\nspeak of his two \"sons,\" but not of his two \"childs\"; he will\r\nindistinguishably refer to \"sheeps\" and \"ships\"; and like the preacher a\r\nlittle unfamiliar with English who had chosen a well-known text to\r\npreach on, he will not remember whether \"plough\" is pronounced \"pluff\"\r\nor \"plo,\"[240] and even a phonetic spelling system would render still more\r\nconfusing the confusion between such a series of words as \"hair,\"\r\n\"hare,\" \"heir,\" \"are,\" \"ere\" and \"eyre.\" Many of these irregularities\r\nare deeply rooted in the structure of the language; it would be an\r\nextremely difficult as well as extensive task to remove them, and when\r\nthe task was achieved the language would have lost much of its character\r\nand savour; it would clash painfully with literary English.\r\n\r\nThus even if we admitted that English ought to be the international\r\nlanguage of the future, the result is not so satisfactory from a British\r\npoint of view as is usually taken for granted. All other civilized\r\nnations would be bilingual; they would possess the key not only to their\r\nown literature, but to a great foreign literature with all the new\r\nhorizons that a foreign literature opens out. The English-speaking\r\ncountries alone would be furnished with only one language, and would\r\nhave no stimulus to acquire any other language, for no other language\r\nwould be of any practical use to them. All foreigners would be in a\r\nposition to bring to the English-speaking man whatever information they\r\nconsidered good for him. At first sight this seems a gain for the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples, because they would thus be spared a certain\r\nexpenditure of energy; but a very little reflection shows that such a\r\nsaving of energy is like that effected by the intestinal parasitic worm\r\nwho has digested food brought ready to his mouth. It leads to\r\ndegeneracy. Not the people whose language is learnt, but the people who\r\nlearn a language reap the benefit, spiritual and material. It is now\r\nadmitted in the commercial world that the ardour of the Germans in\r\nlearning English has brought more advantage to the Germans than to the\r\nEnglish. Moreover, the high intellectual level of small nations at the\r\npresent time is due largely to the fact that all their educated members\r\nmust be familiar with one or two languages besides their own. The great\r\ndefect of the English mind is insularity; the virtue of its boisterous\r\nenergy is accompanied by lack of insight into the differing virtues of\r\nother peoples. If the natural course of events led to the exclusive use\r\nof English for international communication, this defect would be still\r\nmore accentuated. The immense value of becoming acquainted with a\r\nforeign language is that we are thereby led into a new world of\r\ntradition and thought and feeling. Before we know a new language truly,\r\nwe have to realize that the words which at first seem equivalent to\r\nwords in our own language often have a totally different atmosphere, a\r\ndifferent rank or dignity from that which they occupy in our own\r\nlanguage. It is in learning this difference in the moral connotation of\r\na language and its expression in literature that we reap the real\r\nbenefit of knowing a foreign tongue. There is no other way--not even\r\nresidence in a foreign land if we are ignorant of the language--to take\r\nus out of the customary circle of our own traditions. It imparts a\r\nmental flexibility and emotional sympathy which no other discipline can\r\nyield. To ordain that all non-English-speaking peoples should learn\r\nEnglish in addition to their mother tongue, and to render it practically\r\nunnecessary for English-speakers (except the small class of students) to\r\nlearn any other language, would be to confer an immense boon on the\r\nfirst group of peoples, doubling their mental and emotional capacity; it\r\nis to render the second group hidebound.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a broad and impartial survey of the question we thus see\r\nthat there is reason to believe that, while English is an admirable\r\nliterary language (this is the ground that its eulogists always take),\r\nand sufficiently concise for commercial purposes, it is by no means an\r\nadequate international tongue, especially for purposes of oral speech,\r\nand, moreover, its exclusive use for this purpose would be a misfortune\r\nfor the nations already using it, since they would be deprived of that\r\nmental flexibility and emotional sympathy which no discipline can give\r\nso well as knowledge of a living foreign tongue.\r\n\r\nMany who realized these difficulties put forward French as the auxiliary\r\ninternational language. It is quite true that the power behind French is\r\nnow relatively less than it was two centuries ago.[241] At that time\r\nFrance by its relatively large population, the tradition of its military\r\ngreatness, and its influential political position, was able to exert an\r\nimmense influence; French was the language of intellect and society in\r\nGermany, in England, in Russia, everywhere in fact. During the\r\neighteenth century internal maladministration, the cataclysm of the\r\nRevolution, and finally the fatal influence of Napoleon alienated\r\nforeign sympathy, and France lost her commanding position. Yet it was\r\nreasonably felt that, if a natural language is to be used for\r\ninternational purposes, after English there is no practicable\r\nalternative to French.\r\n\r\nFrench is the language not indeed in any special sense of science or of\r\ncommerce, but of the finest human culture. It is a well-organized\r\ntongue, capable of the finest shades of expression, and it is the key to\r\na great literature. In most respects it is the best favoured child of\r\nLatin; it commends itself to all who speak Romance languages, and, as\r\nAlphonse de Candolle has remarked, a Spaniard and an Italian know\r\nthree-quarters of French beforehand, and every one who has learnt Latin\r\nknows half of French already. It is more admirably adapted for speaking\r\npurposes than perhaps any other language which has any claim to be used\r\nfor international purposes, as we should expect of the tongue spoken by\r\na people who have excelled in oratory, who possess such widely diffused\r\ndramatic ability, and who have carried the arts of social intercourse to\r\nthe highest point.\r\n\r\nParis remains for most people the intellectual capital of Europe; French\r\nis still very generally used for purposes of intercommunication\r\nthroughout Europe, while the difficulty experienced by all but Germans\r\nand Russians in learning English is well known. Li Hung Chang is\r\nreported to have said that, while for commercial reasons English is far\r\nmore widely used in China than French, the Chinese find French a much\r\neasier language to learn to speak, and the preferences of the Chinese\r\nmay one day count for a good deal--in one direction or another--in the\r\nworld's progress. One frequently hears that the use of French for\r\ninternational purposes is decaying; this is a delusion probably due to\r\nthe relatively slow growth of the French-speaking races and to various\r\ntemporary political causes. It is only necessary to look at the large\r\nInternational Medical Congresses. Thus at one such Congress at Rome, at\r\nwhich I was present, over six thousand members came from forty-two\r\ncountries of the globe, and over two thousand of them took part in the\r\nproceedings. Four languages (Italian, French, German and English) were\r\nused at this Congress. Going over the seven large volumes of\r\nTransactions, I find that fifty-nine communications were presented in\r\nEnglish, one hundred and seventy-one in German, three hundred and one\r\nin French, the rest in Italian. The proportion of English communications\r\nto German is thus a little more than one to three, and the proportion of\r\nEnglish to French less than one to six. Moreover, the English-speaking\r\nmembers invariably (I believe) used their own language, so that these\r\nfifty-nine communications represent the whole contribution of the\r\nEnglish-speaking world. And they represent nothing more than that;\r\nnotwithstanding the enormous spread of English, of which we hear so\r\nmuch, not a single non-English speaker seems to have used English. It\r\nmight be supposed that this preponderance of French was due to a\r\npreponderance of the French element, but this was by no means the case;\r\nthe members of English-speaking race greatly exceeded those of\r\nFrench-speaking race. But, while the English communications represented\r\nthe English-speaking countries only, and the German communications were\r\nchiefly by German speakers, French was spoken not only by members\r\nbelonging to the smaller nations of Europe, from the north and from the\r\nsouth, by the Russians, by most of the Turkish and Asiatic members, but\r\nalso by all the Mexicans and South Americans. These figures may not be\r\nabsolutely free from fallacy, due to temporary causes of fluctuation.\r\nBut that they are fairly exact is shown by the results of the following\r\nCongress, held at Moscow. If I take up the programme for the department\r\nof psychiatry and nervous disease, in which I was myself chiefly\r\ninterested, I find that of 131 communications, 80 were in French, 37 in\r\nGerman and 14 in English. This shows that French, German and English\r\nbear almost exactly the same relation to one another as at Rome. In\r\nother words, 61 per cent of the speakers used French, 28 per cent\r\nGerman, and only 11 per cent English.\r\n\r\nIf we come down to one of the most recent International Medical\r\nCongresses, that of Lisbon in 1906, we find that the supremacy of\r\nFrench, far from weakening, is more emphatically affirmed. The language\r\nof the country in which the Congress was held was ruled out, and I find\r\nthat of 666 contributions to the proceedings of the Congress, over 84\r\nper cent were in French, scarcely more than 8 per cent in English, and\r\nless than 7 per cent in German. At the subsequent Congress at Budapesth\r\nin 1909, the French contributions were to the English as three to one.\r\nSimilar results are shown by other International Congresses. Thus at the\r\nthird International Congress of Psychology, held at Munich, there were\r\nfour official languages, and on grounds of locality the majority of\r\ncommunications were in German; French followed with 29, Italian with 12,\r\nand English brought up the rear with 11. Dr. Westermarck, who is the\r\nstock example of the spread of English for international purposes, spoke\r\nin German. It is clearly futile to point to figures showing the prolific\r\nqualities of English races; the moral quality of a race and its language\r\ncounts, as well as mere physical capacity for breeding, and the moral\r\ninfluence of French to-day is immensely greater than that of English.\r\nThat is, indeed, scarcely a fair statement of the matter in view of the\r\ntypical cases just quoted; one should rather say that, as a means of\r\nspoken international communication for other than commercial purposes,\r\nEnglish is nowhere.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which serves to give prestige to French: its\r\nliterary supremacy in the modern world. While some would claim for the\r\nEnglish the supreme poetic literature, there can be no doubt that the\r\nFrench own the supreme prose literature of modern Europe. It was felt by\r\nthose who advocated the adoption of English or French that it would\r\nsurely be a gain for human progress if the auxiliary international\r\nlanguages of the future should be one, if not both, of two that possess\r\ngreat literatures, and which embody cultures in some respects allied,\r\nbut in most respects admirably supplementing each other.[242]\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Volapuek stimulated the energy of those who believed that\r\nthe solution of the question lay in the adoption of a natural language.\r\nTo-day, however, there are few persons who, after carefully considering\r\nthe matter, regard this solution as probable or practicable.[243]\r\n\r\nConsiderations of two orders seem now to be decisive in rejecting the\r\nclaims of English and French, or, indeed, any other natural language, to\r\nbe accepted as an international language: (1) The vast number of\r\npeculiarities, difficulties, and irregularities, rendering necessary so\r\nrevolutionary a change for international purposes that the language\r\nwould be almost transformed into an artificial language, and perhaps not\r\neven then an entirely satisfactory one. (2) The extraordinary\r\ndevelopment during recent years of the minor national languages, and the\r\njealousy of foreign languages which this revival has caused. This latter\r\nfactor is probably alone fatal to the adoption of any living language.\r\nIt can scarcely be disputed that neither English nor French occupies\r\nto-day so relatively influential a position as it once occupied. The\r\nmovement against the use of French in Roumania, as detrimental to the\r\nnational language, is significant of a widespread feeling, while, as\r\nregards English, the introduction by the Germans into commerce of the\r\nmethod of approaching customers in their own tongue, has rendered\r\nimpossible the previous English custom of treating English as the\r\ngeneral language of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe natural languages, it became realized, fail to answer to the\r\nrequirements which must be made of an auxiliary international language.\r\nThe conditions which have to be fulfilled are thus formulated by Anna\r\nRoberts:[244]\r\n\r\n\"_First_, a vocabulary having a maximum of internationality in its\r\nroot-words for at least the Indo-European races, living or bordering on\r\nthe confines of the old Roman Empire, whose vocabularies are already\r\nsaturated with Greek and Latin roots, absorbed during the long centuries\r\nof contact with Greek and Roman civilization. As the centre of gravity\r\nof the world's civilization now stands, this seems the most rational\r\nbeginning. Such a language shall then have:\r\n\r\n\"_Second_, a grammatical structure stripped of all the irregularities\r\nfound in every existing tongue, and that shall be simpler than any of\r\nthem. It shall have:\r\n\r\n\"_Third_, a single, unalterable sound for each letter, no silent\r\nletters, no difficult, complex, shaded sounds, but simple primary\r\nsounds, capable of being combined into harmonious words, which latter\r\nshall have but a single stress accent that never shifts.\r\n\r\n\"_Fourth_, mobility of structure, aptness for the expression of complex\r\nideas, but in ways that are grammatically simple, and by means of words\r\nthat can easily be analysed without a dictionary.\r\n\r\n\"_Fifth_, it must be capable of being, not merely a literary\r\nlanguage,[245] but a spoken tongue, having a pronunciation that can be\r\nperfectly mastered by adults through the use of manuals, and in the\r\nabsence of oral teachers.\r\n\r\n\"_Finally_, and as a necessary corollary and complement to all of the\r\nabove, this international auxiliary language must, to be of general\r\nutility, be exceedingly easy of acquisition by persons of but moderate\r\neducation, and hitherto conversant with no language but their own.\"\r\n\r\nThus the way was prepared for the favourable reception of a new\r\nartificial language, which had in the meanwhile been elaborated. Dr.\r\nZamenhof, a Russian physician living at Warsaw, had been from youth\r\noccupied with the project of an international language, and in 1887 he\r\nput forth in French his scheme for a new language to be called\r\nEsperanto. The scheme attracted little notice; Volapuek was then at the\r\nzenith of its career, and when it fell, its fall discredited all\r\nattempts at an artificial language. But, like Volapuek, Esperanto found\r\nits great apostle in France. M. Louis de Beaufront brought his high\r\nability and immense enthusiasm to the work of propaganda, and the\r\nsuccess of Esperanto in the world is attributed in large measure to him.\r\nThe extension of Esperanto is now threatening to rival that of Volapuek.\r\nMany years ago Max Mueller, and subsequently Skeat, notwithstanding the\r\nphilologist's prejudice in favour of natural languages, expressed their\r\napproval of Esperanto, and many persons of distinction, moving in such\r\nwidely remote spheres as Tolstoy and Sir William Ramsay, have since\r\nsignified their acceptance and their sympathy. Esperanto Congresses are\r\nregularly held, Esperanto Societies and Esperanto Consulates are\r\nestablished in many parts of the world, a great number of books and\r\njournals are published in Esperanto, and some of the world's classics\r\nhave been translated into it.\r\n\r\nIt is generally recognized that Esperanto represents a great advance on\r\nVolapuek. Yet there are already signs that Esperanto is approaching the\r\nclimax of its reputation, and that possibly its inventor may share the\r\nfate of the inventor of Volapuek and outlive his own language. The most\r\nserious attack on Esperanto has come from within. The most intelligent\r\nEsperantists have realized the weakness and defects of their language\r\n(in some measure due to the inevitable Slavonic prepossessions of its\r\ninventor) and demand radical reforms, which the conservative party\r\nresist. Even M. de Beaufront, to whom its success was largely due, has\r\nabandoned primitive Esperanto, and various scientific men of high\r\ndistinction in several countries now advocate the supersession of\r\nEsperanto by an improved language based upon it and called Ido.\r\nProfessor Lorenz, who is among the advocates of Ido, admits that\r\nEsperanto has shown the possibility of a synthetic language, but states\r\ndefinitely that \"according to the concordant testimony of all unbiased\r\nopinions\" Esperanto in no wise represents the final solution of the\r\nproblem. This new movement is embodied in the Delegation pour l'Adoption\r\nd'une Langue Auxiliaire Internationale, founded in Paris during the\r\nInternational Exhibition in 1900 by various eminent literary and\r\nscientific men, and having its head-quarters in Paris. The Delegation\r\nconsider that the problem demands a purely scientific and technical\r\nsolution, and it is claimed that 40 per cent of the stems of Ido are\r\ncommon to six languages: German, English, French, Italian, Russian and\r\nSpanish. The Delegation appear to have approached the question with a\r\nfairly open mind, and it was only after study of the subject that they\r\nfinally reached the conclusion that Esperanto contained a sufficient\r\nnumber of good qualities to furnish a basis on which to work.[246]\r\n\r\nThe general programme of the Delegation is that (1) an auxiliary\r\ninternational language is required, adapted to written and oral language\r\nbetween persons of different mother tongues; (2) such language must be\r\ncapable of serving the needs of science, daily life, commerce, and\r\ngeneral intercourse, and must be of such a character that it may easily\r\nbe learnt by persons of average elementary education, especially those\r\nof civilized European nationality; (3) the decision to rest with the\r\nInternational Association of Academies, and, in case of their refusal,\r\nwith the Committee of the Delegation.[247]\r\n\r\nThe Delegation is seeking to bring about an official international\r\nCongress which would either itself or through properly appointed experts\r\nestablish an internationally and officially recognized auxiliary\r\nlanguage. The chief step made in this direction has been the formation\r\nat Berne in 1911 of an international association whose object is to take\r\nimmediate steps towards bringing the question before the Governments of\r\nEurope. The Association is pledged to observe a strict neutrality in\r\nregard to the language to be chosen.\r\n\r\nThe whole question seems thus to have been placed on a sounder basis\r\nthan hitherto. The international language of the future cannot be, and\r\nought not to be, settled by a single individual seeking to impose his\r\nown invention on the world. This is not a matter for zealous propaganda\r\nof an almost religious character. The hasty and premature adoption of\r\nsome privately invented language merely retards progress. No individual\r\ncan settle the question by himself. What we need is calm study and\r\ndeliberation between the nations and the classes chiefly concerned,\r\nacting through the accredited representatives of their Governments and\r\nother professional bodies. Nothing effective can be done until the\r\npressure of popular opinion has awakened Governments and scientific\r\nsocieties to the need for action. The question of international\r\narbitration has become practical; the question of the international\r\nlanguage ought to go hand in hand with that of international\r\narbitration. They are closely allied and both equally necessary.\r\n\r\nWhile the educational, commercial, and official advantages of an\r\nauxiliary international language are obvious, it seems to me that from\r\nthe standpoint of social hygiene there are at least three interests\r\nwhich are especially and deeply concerned in the settlement of this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe first and chief is that of international democracy in its efforts to\r\nattain an understanding on labour questions. There can be no solution of\r\nthis question until a simpler mode of personal communication has become\r\nwidely prevalent. This matter has from time to time already been brought\r\nbefore international labour congresses, and those who attend such\r\ncongresses have doubtless had occasion to realize how essential it is.\r\nPerhaps it is a chief factor in the comparative failure of such\r\ncongresses hitherto.\r\n\r\nScience represents the second great interest which has shown an active\r\nconcern in the settlement of this question. To follow up any line of\r\nscientific research is already a sufficiently gigantic work, on account\r\nof the absence of proper bibliographical organization; it becomes almost\r\noverwhelming now that the search has to extend over at least half a\r\ndozen languages, and still leaves the searcher a stranger to the\r\nimportant investigations which are appearing in Russian and in Japanese,\r\nand will before long appear in other languages. Sir Michael Foster once\r\ndrew a humorous picture of the woes of the physiologist owing to these\r\ncauses. In other fields--especially in the numerous branches of\r\nanthropological research, as I can myself bear witness--the worker is\r\neven worse off than the physiologist. Just now science is concentrating\r\nits energies on the organization of bibliography, but much attention has\r\nbeen given to this question of an international language from time to\r\ntime, and it is likely before long to come pressingly to the front.\r\n\r\nThe medical profession is also practically concerned in this question;\r\nhitherto it has, indeed, taken a more lively interest in the effort to\r\nsecure an international language than has pure science. It is of the\r\nfirst importance that new discoveries and methods in medicine and\r\nhygiene should be rendered immediately accessible; while the now\r\nenormously extended domain of medicine is full of great questions which\r\ncan only be solved by international co-operation on an international\r\nbasis. The responsibility of advocating a number of measures affecting\r\nthe well-being of communities lies, in the first place, with the medical\r\nprofession; but no general agreement is possible without full facilities\r\nfor discussion in international session. This has been generally\r\nrecognized; hence the numerous attempts to urge a single language on the\r\norganizers of the international medical congresses. I have already\r\nobserved how large and active these congresses were. Yet it cannot be\r\nsaid that any results are achieved commensurate with the world-wide\r\ncharacter of such congresses. Partly this is due to the fact that the\r\norganizers of international congresses have not yet learnt what should\r\nbe the scope of such conferences, and what they may legitimately hope to\r\nperform; but very largely because there is no international method of\r\ncommunication; and, except for a few seasoned cosmopolitans, no truly\r\ninternational exchange of opinions takes place. This can only be\r\npossible when we have a really common and familiar method of\r\nintercommunication.\r\n\r\nThese three interests--democratic, scientific, medical--seem at present\r\nthose chiefly concerned in the task of putting this matter on a definite\r\nbasis, and it is much to be desired that they should come to some common\r\nagreement. They represent three immensely important modes of social and\r\nintellectual activity, and the progress of every nation is bound up with\r\nan international progress of which they are now the natural pioneers. It\r\ncannot be too often repeated that the day has gone by when any progress\r\nworthy of the name can be purely national. All the most vital questions\r\nof national progress tend to merge themselves into international\r\nquestions. But before any question of international progress can result\r\nin anything but noisy confusion, we need a recognized mode of\r\ninternational intelligence and communication. That is why the question\r\nof the auxiliary international language is of actual and vital interest\r\nto all who are concerned with the tasks of social hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION ON INTERNATIONAL COINAGE\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the international auxiliary language is an\r\norganic part of a larger internationalization which must inevitably be\r\neffected, and is indeed already coming into being. Two related measures\r\nof intercommunication are an international system of postage stamps, and\r\nan international coinage, to which may be added an international system\r\nof weights and measures, which seems to be already in course of\r\nsettlement by the increasingly general adoption of the metric system.\r\nThe introduction of the exchangeable international stamp coupon\r\nrepresents the beginning of a truly international postal system; but it\r\nis only a beginning. If a completely developed international postal\r\nsystem were incidentally to deliver some nations, and especially the\r\nEnglish, from the depressingly ugly postage stamps they are now\r\ncondemned to use, this reform would possess a further advantage almost\r\nas great as its practical utility. An international coinage is, again, a\r\nprime necessity, which would possess immense commercial advantages in\r\naddition to the great saving of trouble it would effect. The progress of\r\ncivilization is already working towards an international coinage. In an\r\ninteresting paper on this subject (\"International Coinage,\" _Popular\r\nScience Monthly_, March, 1910) T.F. van Wagenen writes; \"Each in its\r\nway, the great commercial nations of the day are unconsciously engaged\r\nin the task. The English shilling is working northwards from the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, has already come in touch with the German mark and the\r\nPortuguese peseta which have been introduced on both the east and west\r\nsides of the Continent, and will in due time meet the French franc and\r\nItalian lira coming south from the shores of the Mediterranean. In Asia,\r\nthe Indian rupee, the Russian rouble, the Japanese yen, and the\r\nAmerican-Philippine coins are already competing for the patronage of the\r\nMalay and the Chinaman. In South America neither American nor European\r\ncoins have any foot-hold, the Latin-American nations being well supplied\r\nby systems of their own, all related more or less closely to the coinage\r\nof Mexico or Portugal. Thus the plainly evolutionary task of pushing\r\ncivilization into the uneducated parts of the world through commerce is\r\nas badly hampered by the different coins offered to the barbarian as are\r\nthe efforts of the evangelists to introduce Christianity by the\r\nexistence of the various denominations and creeds. The Church is\r\nbeginning to appreciate the wastage in its efforts, and is trying to\r\nminimize it by combinations among the denominations having for their\r\nobject to standardize Christianity, so to speak, by reducing tenet and\r\ndogma to the lowest possible terms. Commerce must do the same. The white\r\nman's coins must be standardized and simplified.... The international\r\ncoin will come in a comparatively short time, just as will arrive the\r\ninternational postage stamp, which, by the way, is very badly needed.\r\nFor the upper classes of all countries, the people who travel, and have\r\nto stand the nuisance and loss of changing their money at every\r\nfrontier, the bankers and international merchants who have to cumber\r\ntheir accounts with the fluctuating item of exchange between commercial\r\ncentres will insist upon it. All the European nations, with the\r\nexception of Russia and Turkey, are ready for the change, and when these\r\nreach the stage of real constitutionalism in their progress upward,\r\nthey will be compelled to follow, being already deeply in debt to the\r\nFrench, English, and Germans. Japan may be counted upon to acquiesce\r\ninstantly in any unit agreed upon by the rest of the civilized world.\"\r\n\r\nThis writer points out that the opening out of the uncivilized parts of\r\nthe world to commerce will alone serve to make an international coinage\r\nabsolutely indispensable.\r\n\r\nWithout, however, introducing a really new system, an auxiliary\r\ninternational money system (corresponding to an auxiliary international\r\nlanguage) could be introduced as a medium of exchange without\r\ninterfering with the existing coinages of the various nations. Rene de\r\nSaussure (writing in the _Journal de Geneve_, in 1907) has insisted on\r\nthe immense benefit such a system of \"monnaie de compte\" would be in\r\nremoving the burden imposed upon all international financial relations\r\nby the diversity of money values. He argues that the best point of union\r\nwould be a gold piece of eight grammes--almost exactly equivalent to one\r\npound, twenty marks, five dollars, and twenty-five francs--being, in\r\nfact, but one-third of a penny different from the value of a pound\r\nsterling. For the subdivisions the point of union must be decimally\r\ndivided, and M. de Saussure would give the name of speso to a\r\nten-thousandth part of the gold coin.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[236] The history of the efforts to attain a universal language has been\r\nwritten by Couturat and Leau, _Histoire de la Langue Universelle_, 1903.\r\n\r\n[237] The distinguished French physician, Dr. Sollier, also, in an address\r\nto the Lisbon International Medical Congress, on \"La Question de la\r\nLangue Auxiliaire Internationale,\" in 1906, advocating the adoption of\r\none of the existing Romance tongues, said: \"Spanish is the simplest of\r\nall and the easiest, and if it were chosen for this purpose I should be\r\nthe first to accept it.\"\r\n\r\n[238] It has even been stated by a distinguished English man of science\r\nthat Latin is sometimes easier for the English to use than is their own\r\nlanguage. \"I have known Englishmen who could be trusted to write a more\r\nintelligible treatise, possibly even to make a more lucid speech, in\r\nLatin than in English,\" says Dr. Miers, the Principal of London\r\nUniversity (_Lancet_, 7th October, 1911), and he adds: \"Quite seriously,\r\nI think some part of the cause is to be sought in the difficulty of our\r\nlanguage, and many educated persons get lost in its intricacies, just as\r\nthey get lost in its spelling.\" Without questioning the fact, however, I\r\nwould venture to question this explanation of it.\r\n\r\n[239] Thus in one article on the growing extension of the English language\r\nthroughout the world (_Macmillan's Magazine_, March, 1892) we read:\r\n\"English is practically certain to become the language of the world....\r\nThe speech of Shakespeare and Milton, of Dryden and Swift, of Byron and\r\nWordsworth, will be, in a sense in which no other language has been, the\r\nspeech of the whole world.\" We do not nowadays meet with these wild\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\n[240] The stumbling-stones for the foreigner presented by English words in\r\n\"ough\" have often been referred to, and are clearly set forth in the\r\nverses in which Mr. C.B. Loomis has sought to represent a French\r\nlearner's experiences--and the same time to show the criminal impulses\r\nwhich these irregularities arouse in the pupil.\r\n\r\n    \"I'm taught p-l-o-u-g-h\r\n      Shall be pronounced 'plow,'\r\n    'Zat's easy when you know,' I say,\r\n      'Mon Anglais I'll get through.'\r\n\r\n    \"My teacher say zat in zat case\r\n      O-u-g-h is 'oo,'\r\n    And zen I laugh and say to him\r\n      'Zees Anglais make me cough.'\r\n\r\n    \"He say, 'Not coo, but in zat word\r\n      O-u-g-h is \"off,\"'\r\n    Oh, _sacre bleu_! such varied sounds\r\n      Of words make me hiccough!\r\n\r\n    \"He say, 'Again, mon friend ees wrong!\r\n      O-u-g-h is \"up,\"\r\n    In hiccough,' Zen I cry, 'No more,\r\n      You make my throat feel rough,'\r\n\r\n    \"'Non! non!' he cry, 'you are not right--\r\n      O-u-g-h is \"uff.\"'\r\n    I say, 'I try to speak your words,\r\n      I can't prononz zem though,'\r\n\r\n    \"'In time you'll learn, but now you're wrong,\r\n      O-u-g-h is \"owe.\"'\r\n    'I'll try no more. I sall go mad,\r\n      I'll drown me in ze lough!'\r\n\r\n    \"'But ere you drown yourself,' said he,\r\n      'O-u-g-h is \"ock.\"'\r\n    He taught no more! I held him fast,\r\n      And killed him wiz a rough!\"\r\n\r\n[241] It is interesting to remember that at one period in European\r\nhistory, French seemed likely to absorb English, and thus to acquire, in\r\naddition to its own motor force, all the motor force which now lies\r\nbehind English. When the Normans--a vigorous people of Scandinavian\r\norigin, speaking a Romance tongue, and therefore well fitted to\r\naccomplish a harmonizing task of this kind--occupied both sides of the\r\nEnglish Channel, it seemed probable that they would dominate the speech\r\nof England as well as of France. \"At that time,\" says Meray (_La Vie aux\r\nTemps des Cours d'Amour_, p. 367), who puts forward this view, \"the\r\npeople of the two coasts of the Channel were closer in customs and in\r\nspeech than were for a long time the French on the opposite banks of the\r\nLoire.... The influential part of the English nation and all the people\r\nof its southern regions spoke the _Romance_ of the north of France. In\r\nthe Crusades the Knights of the two peoples often mixed, and were\r\ngreeted as Franks wherever their adventurous spirit led them. If Edward\r\nIII, with the object of envenoming an antagonism which served his own\r\nends, had not broken this link of language, the two peoples would\r\nperhaps have been united to-day in the same efforts of progress and of\r\nliberty.... Of what a fine instrument of culture and of progress has not\r\nthat fatal decree of Edward III deprived civilization!\"\r\n\r\n[242] I was at one time (_Progressive Review_, April, 1897) inclined to\r\nthink that the adoption of both English and French, as joint auxiliary\r\ninternational languages--the first for writing and the second for\r\nspeaking--might solve the problem. I have since recognized that such a\r\nsolution, however advantageous it might be for human culture, would\r\npresent many difficulties, and is quite impracticable.\r\n\r\n[243] I may refer to three able papers which have appeared in recent years\r\nin the _Popular Science Monthly_: Anna Monsch Roberts, \"The Problem of\r\nInternational Speech\" (February, 1908); Ivy Kellerman, \"The Necessity\r\nfor an International Language,\" (September, 1909); Albert Leon Guerard,\r\n\"English as an International Language\" (October, 1911). All these\r\nwriters reject as impracticable the adoption of either English or French\r\nas the auxiliary international language, and view with more favour the\r\nadoption of an artificial language such as Esperanto.\r\n\r\n[244] A.M. Roberts, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n[245] It should be added, however, that the auxiliary language need not\r\nbe used as a medium for literary art, and it is a mistake, as Pfaundler\r\npoints out, to translate poems into such a language.\r\n\r\n[246] See _International Language and Science_, 1910, by Couturat,\r\nJespersen, Lorenz, Ostwald, Pfaundler, and Donnan, five professors\r\nliving in five different countries.\r\n\r\n[247] The progress of the movement is recorded in its official journal,\r\n_Progreso_, edited by Couturat, and in De Beaufront's journal, _La\r\nLangue Auxiliaire_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUALISM AND SOCIALISM\r\n\r\n     Social Hygiene in Relation to the Alleged Opposition between\r\n     Socialism and Individualism--The Two Parties in Politics--The\r\n     Relation of Conservatism and Radicalism to Socialism and\r\n     Individualism--The Basis of Socialism--The Basis of\r\n     Individualism--The seeming Opposition between Socialism and\r\n     Individualism merely a Division of Labour--Both Socialism and\r\n     Individualism equally Necessary--Not only Necessary but\r\n     Indispensable to each other--The Conflict between the Advocates of\r\n     Environment and Heredity--A New Embodiment of the supposed Conflict\r\n     between Socialism and Individualism--The Place of Eugenics--Social\r\n     Hygiene ultimately one with the Hygiene of the Soul--The Function\r\n     of Utopias.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe controversy between Individualism and Socialism, the claim of the\r\npersonal unit as against the claim of the collective community, is of\r\nancient date. Yet it is ever new and constantly presented afresh. It\r\neven seems to become more acute as civilization progresses. Every scheme\r\nof social reform, every powerful manifestation of individual energy,\r\nraise anew a problem that is never out of date.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable, indeed, that with the development of social hygiene\r\nduring the past hundred years there should also develop a radical\r\nopposition of opinion as to the methods by which such hygiene ought to\r\nbe accomplished. There has always been this opposition in the political\r\nsphere; it is natural to find it also in the social sphere. The very\r\nfact that old-fashioned politics are becoming more and more transformed\r\ninto questions of social hygiene itself ensures the continuance of such\r\nan opposition.\r\n\r\nIn politics, and especially in the politics of constitutional countries\r\nof which England is the type, there are normally two parties. There is\r\nthe party that holds by tradition, by established order and solidarity,\r\nthe maintenance of the ancient hierarchical constitution of society, and\r\nin general distinguishes itself by a preference for the old over the\r\nnew. There is, on the other side, the party that insists on progress, on\r\nfreedom, on the reasonable demands of the individual, on the adaptation\r\nof the accepted order to changing conditions, and in general\r\ndistinguishes itself by a preference for the new over the old. The first\r\nmay be called the party of structure, and the second the party of\r\nfunction. In England we know the adherents of one party as Conservatives\r\nand those of the other party as Liberals or Radicals.\r\n\r\nIn time, it is true, these normal distinctions between the party of\r\nstructure and the party of function tend to become somewhat confused;\r\nand it is precisely the transition of politics into the social sphere\r\nwhich tends to introduce confusion. With a political system which\r\nproceeds ultimately out of a society with a feudalistic basis, the\r\nnormal attitude of political parties is long maintained. The party of\r\nstructure, the Conservative party, holds by the ancient feudalistic\r\nideals which are really, in the large sense, socialistic, though a\r\nsocialism based on a foundation of established inequality, and so\r\naltogether unlike the democratic socialism promulgated to-day. The\r\nparty of function, the Liberal party, insists on the break-up of this\r\nstructural socialism to meet the new needs of progressive civilization.\r\nBut when feudalism has been left far behind, and many of the changes\r\nintroduced by Liberalism have become part of the social structure, they\r\nfall under the protection of Conservatives who are fighting against new\r\nLiberal innovations. Thus the lines of delimitation tend to become\r\nindistinct.\r\n\r\nIn the politics of social hygiene there are the same two factors: the\r\nparty of structure and the party of function. In their nature and in\r\ntheir opposition to each other they correspond to the two parties in the\r\nold political field. But they have changed their character and their\r\nnames: the party of structure is here Socialism or Collectivism,[248] the\r\nparty of function is Individualism.[249] And while the Tory, the\r\nConservative of early days, was allied to Collectivism, and the Whig,\r\nthe Liberal of early days, to Individualism, that correspondence has\r\nceased to be invariable owing to the confused manner in which the old\r\npolitical parties have nowadays shifted their ground. We may thus see a\r\nLiberal who is a Collectivist when a Collectivist measure may involve\r\nthat innovation to secure adjustment to new needs which is of the\r\nessence of Liberalism, and we may see a Conservative who is an\r\nIndividualist when Individualism involves that maintenance of the\r\nexisting order which is of the essence of Conservatism. Whether a man is\r\na Conservative or a Liberal, he may incline either to Socialism or to\r\nIndividualism without breaking with his political tradition. It is,\r\ntherefore, impossible to import any political animus into the\r\nfundamental antagonism between Individualism and Socialism, which\r\nprevails in the sphere of social hygiene.\r\n\r\nWe cannot hope to see clearly the grave problems involved by the\r\nfundamental antagonism between Socialism and Individualism unless we\r\nunderstand what each is founded on and what it is aiming at.\r\n\r\nWhen we seek to inquire how it is that the Socialist ideal exerts so\r\npowerful an attraction on the human mind, and why it is ever seeking new\r\nmodes of practical realization, we cannot fail to perceive that it\r\nultimately proceeds from the primitive need of mutual help, a need which\r\nwas felt long before the appearance of humanity.[250] If, however, we keep\r\nstrictly to our immediate mammalian traditions it may be said that the\r\nearliest socialist community is the family, with its trinity of father,\r\nmother, and child. The primitive family constitutes a group which is\r\nconditioned by the needs of each member. Each individual is subordinated\r\nto the whole. The infant needs the mother and the mother needs the\r\ninfant; they both need the father and the father needs both for the\r\ncomplete satisfaction of his own activities. Socially and economically\r\nthis primitive group is a unit, and if broken up into its individual\r\nparts these would be liable to perish.\r\n\r\nHowever we may multiply our social unit, however we may enlarge and\r\nelaborate it, however we may juggle with the results, we cannot disguise\r\nthe essential fact. At the centre of every social agglomeration, however\r\nvast, however small, lies the social unit of the family of which each\r\nindividual is by himself either unable to live or unable to reproduce,\r\nunable, that is to say, to gratify the two fundamental needs of hunger\r\nand love.\r\n\r\nThere are many people who, while willing to admit that the family is, in\r\na sense, a composite social unit to which each part has need of the\r\nother parts, so that all are mutually bound together, seek to draw a\r\nfirm line of distinction between the family and society. Family life,\r\nthey declare, is not irreconcilable with individualism; it is merely _un\r\negoisme a trois_. It is, however, difficult to see how such a\r\ndistinction can be maintained, whether we look at the matter\r\ntheoretically or practically. In a small country like Great Britain, for\r\ninstance, every Englishman (excluding new immigrants) is related by\r\nblood to every other Englishman, as would become clearer if every man\r\npossessed his pedigree for a thousand years back. When we remember,\r\nfurther, also, that every nation has been overlaid by invasions, warlike\r\nor peaceful, from neighbouring lands, and has, indeed, been originally\r\nformed in this way since no people has sprung up out of the soil of its\r\nown land, we must further admit that the nations themselves form one\r\nfamily related by blood.\r\n\r\nOur genealogical relation to our fellows is too remote and extensive to\r\nconcern us much practically and sentimentally, though it is well that we\r\nshould realize it. If we put it aside, we have still to remember that\r\nour actual need of our fellows is not definitely to be distinguished\r\nfrom the mutual needs of the members of the smallest social unit, the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn practice the individual is helpless. Of all animals, indeed, man is\r\nthe most helpless when left to himself. He must be cared for by others\r\nat every moment during his long infancy. He is dependent on the\r\nexertions of others for shelter and clothes, while others are occupied\r\nin preparing his food and conveying it from the ends of the world. Even\r\nif we confine ourselves to the most elementary needs of a moderately\r\ncivilized existence, or even if our requirements are only those of an\r\nidiot in an asylum, yet, for every one of us, there are literally\r\nmillions of people spending the best of their lives from morning to\r\nnight and perhaps receiving but little in return. The very elementary\r\nneed of the individual in an urban civilization for pure water to drink\r\ncan only be attained by organized social effort. The gigantic aqueducts\r\nconstructed by the Romans are early monuments of social activity typical\r\nof all the rest. The primary needs of the individual can only be\r\nsupplied by an immense and highly organized social effort. The more\r\ncomplex civilization becomes, and the more numerous individual needs\r\nbecome, so much the more elaborate and highly organized becomes the\r\nsocial response to those needs. The individual is so dependent on\r\nsociety that he needs not only the active work of others, but even their\r\nmere passive good opinion, and if he loses that he is a failure,\r\nbankrupt, a pauper, a lunatic, a criminal, and the social reaction\r\nagainst him may suffice to isolate him, even to put him out of life\r\naltogether. So dependent indeed on society is the individual that there\r\nhas always been a certain plausibility in the old idea of the Stoics,\r\ncountenanced by St. Paul, and so often revived in later days (as by\r\nSchaeffle, Lilienfeld, and Rene Worms), that society is an organism in\r\nwhich the individuals are merely cells depending for their significance\r\non the whole to which they belong. Just as the animal is, as Hegel, the\r\nmetaphysician, called it, a \"nation,\" and Dareste, the physiologist, a\r\n\"city,\" made up of cells which are individuals having a common ancestor,\r\nso the actual nation, the real city, is an animal made up of individuals\r\nwhich are cells having a common ancestor, or, as Oken long ago put it,\r\nindividuals are the organs of the whole.[251] Man is a social animal in\r\nconstant action and reaction with all his fellows of the same group--a\r\ngroup which becomes ever greater as civilization advances--and socialism\r\nis merely the formal statement of this ultimate social fact.[252]\r\n\r\nThere is a divinity that hedges certain words. A sacred terror warns the\r\nprofane off them as off something that might blast the beholder's sight.\r\nIn fact it is so, and even a clear-sighted person may be blinded by such\r\na word. Of these words none is more typical than the word \"socialism.\"\r\nNot so very long ago a prominent public man, of high intelligence, but\r\nevidently susceptible to the terror-striking influence of words, went to\r\nGlasgow to deliver an address on Social Reform. He warned his hearers\r\nagainst Socialism, and told them that, though so much talked about, it\r\nhad not made one inch of progress; of practical Socialism or\r\nCollectivism there were no signs at all. Yet, as some of his hearers\r\npointed out, he gave his address in a municipally owned hall,\r\nilluminated by municipal lights, to an audience which had largely\r\narrived in municipal tramcars travelling through streets owned,\r\nmaintained, and guarded by the municipality. This audience was largely\r\neducated in State schools, in which their children nowadays can receive\r\nnot only free education and free books, but, if necessary, free food and\r\nfree medical inspection and treatment. Moreover, the members of this\r\nsame audience thus assured of the non-existence of Socialism, are\r\nentitled to free treatment in the municipal hospital, should an\r\ninfective disease overtake them; the municipality provides them freely\r\nwith concerts and picture galleries, golf courses and swimming ponds;\r\nand in old age, finally, if duly qualified, they receive a State\r\npension. Now all these measures are socialistic, and Socialism is\r\nnothing more or less than a complicated web of such measures; the\r\nsocialistic State, as some have put it, is simply a great national\r\nco-operative association of which the Government is the board of\r\nmanagers.\r\n\r\nIt is said by some who disclaim any tendency to Socialism, that what\r\nthey desire is not the State-ownership of the means of production, but\r\nState-regulation. Let the State, in the interests of the community, keep\r\na firm control over the individualistic exploitation of capital, let it\r\ntax capital as far as may be desirable in the interests of the\r\ncommunity. But beyond this, capital, as well as land, is sacred. The\r\ndistinction thus assumed is not, however, valid. The very people who\r\nmake this distinction are often enthusiastic advocates of an enlarged\r\nnavy and a more powerful army. Yet these can only be provided by\r\ntaxation, and every tax in a democratic State is a socialistic measure,\r\nand involves collective ownership of the proceeds, whether they are\r\napplied to making guns or swimming-baths. Every step in the regulation\r\nof industry assumes the rights of society over individualistic\r\nproduction, and is therefore socialistic. It is a question of less or\r\nmore, but except along those two lines, there is no socialism at all to\r\nbe reckoned with in the practical affairs of the world. That\r\nrevolutionary socialism of the dogmatically systematic school of Karl\r\nMarx which desired to transfer society at a single stroke by taking over\r\nand centralizing all the means of production may now be regarded as a\r\ndream. It never at any time took root in the English-speaking lands,\r\nthough it was advocated with unwearying patience by men of such force of\r\nintellect and of character as Mr. Hyndman and William Morris. Even in\r\nGermany, the land of its origin, nearly all its old irreconcilable\r\nleaders are dead, and it is now slowly but steadily losing influence, to\r\ngive place to a more modern and practical socialism.\r\n\r\nAs we are concerned with it to-day and in the future, Socialism is not a\r\nrigid economic theory, nor is it the creed of a narrow sect. In its wide\r\nsense it is a name that covers all the activities--first instinctive,\r\nthen organized--which arise out of the fundamental fact that man is a\r\nsocial animal. In its more precise sense it indicates the various\r\norderly measures that are taken by groups of individuals--whether States\r\nor municipalities--to provide collectively for the definite needs of the\r\nindividuals composing the group. So much for Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe individualist has a very different story to tell. From the point of\r\nview of Individualism, however elaborate the structure of the society\r\nyou erect, it can only, after all, be built up of individuals, and its\r\nwhole worth must depend on the quality of those individuals. If they are\r\nnot fully developed and finely tempered by high responsibilities and\r\nperpetual struggles, all social effort is fruitless, it will merely\r\ndegrade the individual to the helpless position of a parasite. The\r\nindividual is born alone; he must die alone; his deepest passions, his\r\nmost exquisite tastes, are personal; in this world, or in any other\r\nworld, all the activities of society cannot suffice to save his soul.\r\nThus it is that the individual must bear his own burdens, for it is\r\nonly in so doing that the muscles of his body grow strong and that the\r\nenergies of his spirit become keen. It is by the qualities of the\r\nindividual alone that work is sound and that initiative is possible. All\r\ntrade and commerce, every practical affair of life, depend for success\r\non the personal ability of individuals.[253] It is not only so in the\r\neveryday affairs of life, it is even more so on the highest planes of\r\nintellectual and spiritual life. The supreme great men of the race were\r\ntermed by Carlyle its \"heroes,\" by Emerson its \"representative men,\"\r\nbut, equally by the less and by the more democratic term, they are\r\nalways individuals standing apart from society, often in violent\r\nopposition to it, though they have always conquered in the end. When any\r\ngreat person has stood alone against the world it has always been the\r\nworld that lost. The strongest man, as Ibsen argued in his _Enemy of the\r\nPeople_, is the man who stands most alone. \"He will be the greatest,\"\r\nsays Nietzsche in _Beyond Good and Evil_, \"who can be the most solitary,\r\nthe most concealed, the most divergent.\" Every great and vitally\r\norganized person is hostile to the rigid and narrow routine of social\r\nconventions, whether established by law or by opinion; they must ever be\r\nbroken to suit his vital needs. Therefore the more we multiply these\r\nsocial routines, the more strands we weave into the social web, the more\r\nclosely we draw them, by so much the more we are discouraging the\r\nproduction of great and vitally organized persons, and by so much the\r\nmore we are exposing society to destruction at the hands of such\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nBeneath Socialism lies the assertion that society came first and that\r\nindividuals are indefinitely apt for education into their place in\r\nsociety. Socialism has inherited the maxim, which Rousseau, the\r\nuncompromising Individualist, placed at the front of his _Social\r\nContract_: \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.\" There is\r\nnothing to be done but to strike off the chains and organize society on\r\na social basis. Men are not this or that; they are what they have been\r\nmade. Make the social conditions right, says the thorough-going\r\nSocialist, and individuals will be all that we could desire them to be.\r\nNot poverty alone, but disease, lunacy, prostitution, criminality are\r\nall the results of bad social and economic conditions. Create the right\r\nenvironment and you have done all that is necessary. To some extent that\r\nis clearly true. But the individualist insists that there are definite\r\nlimits to its truth. Even in the most favourable environment nearly\r\nevery ill that the Socialist seeks to remove is found. Inevitably, the\r\nIndividualist declares, because we do not spring out of our environment,\r\nbut out of our ancestral stocks. Against the stress on environment, the\r\nIndividualist lays the stress on the ascertained facts of heredity. It\r\nis the individual that counts, and for good or for ill the individual\r\nbrought his fate with him at birth. Ensure the production of sound\r\nindividuals, and you may set at naught the environment. You will,\r\nindeed, secure results incomparably better than even the most anxious\r\ncare expended on environment alone can ever hope to secure.\r\n\r\nSuch are the respective attitudes of Socialism and Individualism. So far\r\nas I can see, they are both absolutely right. Nor is it even clear that\r\nthey are really opposed; for, as happens in every field, while the\r\naffirmations of each are sound, their denials are unsound. Certainly,\r\nalong each line we may be carried to absurdity. The Individualism of Max\r\nStirner is not far from the ultimate frontier of sanity, and possibly\r\neven on the other side of it;[254] while the Socialism of the Oneida\r\nCommunity involved a self-subordination which it would be idle to expect\r\nfrom the majority of men and women. But there is a perfect division of\r\nlabour between Socialism and Individualism. We cannot have too much of\r\neither of them. We have only to remember that the field of each is\r\ndistinct. No one needs Individualism in his water supply, and no one\r\nneeds Socialism in his religion. All human affairs sort themselves out\r\nas coming within the province of Socialism or of Individualism, and each\r\nmay be pushed to its furthest extreme.[255]\r\n\r\nIt so happens, however, that the capacity of the human brain is limited,\r\nand a single brain is not made to hold together the idea of Socialism\r\nand the idea of Individualism. Ordinary people have, it is true, no\r\npractical difficulty whatever in acting concurrently in accordance with\r\nthe ideas of Socialism and of Individualism. But it is different with\r\nthe men of ideas; they must either be Socialists or Individualists; they\r\ncannot be both. The tendency in one or the other direction is probably\r\ninborn in these men of ideas.\r\n\r\nWe need not regret this inevitable division of labour. On the contrary,\r\nit is difficult to see how the right result could otherwise be brought\r\nabout. People without ideas experience no difficulty in harmonizing the\r\ntwo tendencies. But if the ideas of Socialism and Individualism tended\r\nto appear in the same brain they would neutralize each other or lead\r\naction into an unprofitable _via media_. The separate initiative and\r\npromulgation of the two tendencies encourages a much more effective\r\naction, and best promotes that final harmony of the two extremes which\r\nthe finest human development needs.\r\n\r\nThere is more to be said. Not only are both alike indispensable, and\r\nboth too profoundly rooted in human nature to be abolished or abridged,\r\nbut each is indispensable to the other. There can be no Socialism\r\nwithout Individualism; there can be no Individualism without Socialism.\r\nOnly a very fine development of personal character and individual\r\nresponsibility can bear up any highly elaborated social organization,\r\nwhich is why small Socialist communities have only attained success by\r\nenlisting finely selected persons; only a highly organized social\r\nstructure can afford scope for the play of individuality. The\r\nenlightened Socialist nowadays often realizes something of the\r\nrelationship of Socialism to Individualism, and the Individualist--if he\r\nwere not in recent times, for all his excellent qualities, sometimes\r\nlacking in mental flexibility and alertness--would be prepared to admit\r\nhis own relationship to Socialism. \"The organization of the whole is\r\ndominated by the necessities of cellular life,\" as Dareste says. That\r\ntruth is well recognized by the physiologists since the days of Claude\r\nBernard. It is absolutely true of the physiology of society. Social\r\norganization is not for the purpose of subordinating the individual to\r\nsociety; it is as much for the purpose of subordinating society to the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nBetween individuals, even the greatest, and society there is perpetual\r\naction and reaction. While the individual powerfully acts on society, he\r\ncan only so act in so far as he is himself the instrument and organ of\r\nsociety. The individual leads society, but only in that direction\r\nwhither society wishes to go. Every man of science merely carries\r\nknowledge or invention one further step, a needed and desired step,\r\nbeyond the stage reached by his immediate predecessors. Every poet and\r\nartist is only giving expression to the secret feelings and impulses of\r\nhis fellows. He has the courage to utter for the first time the intimate\r\nemotion and aspiration which he finds in the depth of his own soul, and\r\nhe has the skill to express them in forms of radiant beauty. But all\r\nthese secret feelings and desires are in the hearts of other men, who\r\nhave not the boldness to tell them nor the ability to embody them\r\nexquisitely. In the life of man, as in nature generally, there is a\r\nperpetual process of exfoliation, as Edward Carpenter calls it, whereby\r\na latent but striving desire is revealed, and the man of genius is the\r\nstimulus and the incarnation of this exfoliating movement. That is why\r\nevery great poet and artist when once his message becomes intelligible,\r\nis acclaimed and adored by the crowd for whom he would only have been an\r\nobject of idle wonderment if he had not expressed and glorified\r\nthemselves. When the man of genius is too far ahead of his time, he is\r\nrejected, however great his genius may be, because he represents the\r\nindividual out of vital relation to his time. A Roger Bacon, for all his\r\nstupendous intellect, is deprived of pen and paper and shut up in a\r\nmonastery, because he is undertaking to answer questions which will not\r\nbe asked until five centuries after his death. Perhaps the supreme man\r\nof genius is he who, like Virgil, Leonardo, or Shakespeare, has a\r\nmessage for his own time and a message for all times, a message which is\r\nfor ever renewed for every new generation.\r\n\r\nThe need for insisting on the intimate relations between Socialism and\r\nIndividualism has become the more urgent to-day because we are reaching\r\na stage of civilization in which each tendency is inevitably so pushed\r\nto its full development that a clash is only prevented by the\r\nrealization that here we have truly a harmony. Sometimes a matter that\r\nbelongs to one sphere is so closely intertwined with a matter that\r\nbelongs to the other that it is a very difficult problem how to hold\r\nthem separate and allow each its due value.[256]\r\n\r\nAt times, indeed, it is really very difficult to determine to which\r\nsphere a particular kind of human activity belongs. This is notably the\r\ncase as regards education. \"Render unto Caesar the things that be\r\nCaesar's, and unto God the things that be God's.\" But is education among\r\nthe things that belong to Caesar, to social organization, or among the\r\nthings that belong to God, to the province of the individual's soul?\r\nThere is much to be said on both sides. Of late the Socialist tendency\r\nprevails here, and there is a disposition to standardize rigidly an\r\neducation so superficial, so platitudinous, so uniform, so\r\nunprofitable--so fatally oblivious of what even the word _education_\r\nmeans[257]--that some day, perhaps, the revolted Individualist spirit will\r\narise in irresistible might to sweep away the whole worthless structure\r\nfrom top to bottom, with even such possibilities of good as it may\r\nconceal. The educationalists of to-day may do well to remember that it\r\nis wise to be generous to your enemies even in the interests of your own\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nIn every age the question of Individualism and Socialism takes on a\r\ndifferent form. In our own age it has become acute under the form of a\r\nconflict between the advocates of good heredity and the advocates of\r\ngood environment. On the one hand there is the desire to breed the\r\nindividual to a high degree of efficiency by eugenic selection,\r\nfavouring good stocks and making the procreation of bad stocks more\r\ndifficult. On the other hand there is the effort so to organize the\r\nenvironment by collectivist methods that life for all may become easy\r\nand wholesome. As usual, those who insist on the importance of good\r\nenvironment are inclined to consider that the question of heredity may\r\nbe left to itself, and those who insist on the importance of good\r\nheredity are indifferent to environment. As usual, also, there is a real\r\nunderlying harmony of those two demands. There is, however, here more\r\nthan this. In this most modern of their embodiments, Socialism and\r\nIndividualism are not merely harmonious, each is the key to the other,\r\nwhich remains unattainable without it. However carefully we improve our\r\nbreed, however anxiously we guard the entrance to life, our labour will\r\nbe in vain if we neglect to adapt the environment to the fine race we\r\nare breeding. The best individuals are not the toughest, any more than\r\nthe highest species are the toughest, but rather, indeed, the reverse,\r\nand no creature needs so much and so prolonged an environing care as\r\nman, to ensure his survival. On the other hand, an elaborate attention\r\nto the environment, combined with a reckless inattention to the quality\r\nof the individuals born to live in that environment can only lead to an\r\noverburdened social organization which will speedily fall by its own\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century the Socialists of the school for bettering the\r\nenvironment have for the most part had the game in their own hands. They\r\nfounded themselves on the very reasonable basis of sympathy, a basis\r\nwhich the eighteenth-century moralists had prepared, which Schopenhauer\r\nhad formulated, which George Eliot had passionately preached, which had\r\naround its operations the immense prestige of the gospel of Jesus. The\r\nenvironmental Socialists--always quite reasonably--set themselves to\r\nimprove the conditions of labour; they provided local relief for the\r\npoor; they built hospitals for the free treatment of the sick. They are\r\nproceeding to feed school children, to segregate and protect the\r\nfeeble-minded, to insure the unemployed, to give State pensions to the\r\naged, and they are even asked to guarantee work for all. Now these\r\nthings, and the likes of them, are not only in accordance with natural\r\nhuman impulses, but for the most part they are reasonable, and in\r\nprotecting the weak the strong are, in a certain sense, protecting\r\nthemselves. No one nowadays wants the hungry to hunger or the suffering\r\nto suffer. Indeed, in that sense, there never has been any\r\n_laissez-faire_ school.[258]\r\n\r\nBut as the movement of environmental Socialism realizes itself, it\r\nbecomes increasingly clear that it is itself multiplying the work which\r\nit sets itself to do. In enabling the weak, the incompetent, and the\r\ndefective to live and to live comfortably, it makes it easier for those\r\non the borderland of these classes to fall into them, and it furnishes\r\nthe conditions which enable them to propagate their like, and to do\r\nthis, moreover, without that prudent limitation which is now becoming\r\nuniversal in all classes above those of the weak, the incompetent, and\r\nthe defective. Thus unchecked environmental Socialism, obeying natural\r\nimpulses and seeking legitimate ends, would be drawn into courses at the\r\nend of which only social enfeeblement, perhaps even dissolution, could\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nThe key to the situation, it is now beginning to be more and more widely\r\nfelt, is to be found in the counterbalancing tendency of Individualism,\r\nand the eugenic guardianship of the race. Not, rightly understood, as a\r\nmethod of arresting environmental Socialism, nor even as a counterblast\r\nto its gospel of sympathy. Nietzsche, indeed, has made a famous assault\r\non sympathy, as he has on conventional morality generally, but his\r\n\"immoralism\" in general and his \"hardness\" in particular are but new and\r\nfiner manifestations of those faded virtues he was really seeking to\r\nrevive. The superficially sympathetic man flings a coin to the beggar;\r\nthe more deeply sympathetic man builds an almshouse for him so that he\r\nneed no longer beg; but perhaps the most radically sympathetic of all is\r\nthe man who arranges that the beggar shall not be born.\r\n\r\nSo it is that the question of breed, the production of fine individuals,\r\nthe elevation of the ideal of quality in human production over that of\r\nmere quantity, begins to be seen, not merely as a noble ideal in itself,\r\nbut as the only method by which Socialism can be enabled to continue on\r\nits present path. If the entry into life is conceded more freely to the\r\nweak, the incompetent, and the defective than to the strong, the\r\nefficient, and the sane, then a Sisyphean task is imposed on society;\r\nfor every burden lifted two more burdens appear. But as individual\r\nresponsibility becomes developed, as we approach the time to which\r\nGalton looked forward, when the eugenic care for the race may become a\r\nreligion, then social control over the facts of life becomes possible.\r\nThrough the slow growth of knowledge concerning hereditary conditions,\r\nby voluntary self-restraint, by the final disappearance of the lingering\r\nprejudice against the control of procreation, by sterilization in\r\nspecial cases, by methods of pressure which need not amount to actual\r\ncompulsion,[259] it will be possible to attain an increasingly firm grip\r\non the evil elements of heredity. Not until such measures as these,\r\nunder the controlling influence of a sense of personal responsibility\r\nextending to every member of the community, have long been put into\r\npractice, can we hope to see man on the earth risen to his full stature,\r\nhealthy in body, noble in spirit, beautiful in both alike, moving\r\nspaciously and harmoniously among his fellows in the great world of\r\nNature, to which he is so subtly adapted because he has himself sprung\r\nout of it and is its most exquisite flower. At this final point social\r\nhygiene becomes one with the hygiene of the soul.[260]\r\n\r\nPoets and prophets, from Jesus and Paul to Novalis and Whitman, have\r\nseen the divine possibilities of Man. There is no temple in the world,\r\nthey seem to say, so great as the human body; he comes in contact with\r\nHeaven, they declare, who touches a human person. But these human\r\nthings, made to be gods, have spawned like frogs over all the earth.\r\nEverywhere they have beslimed its purity and befouled its beauty,\r\ndarkening the very sunshine. Heaped upon one another in evil masses,\r\npreying upon one another as no other creature has ever preyed upon its\r\nkind, they have become a festering heap which all the oceans in vain\r\nlave with their antiseptic waters, and all the winds of heaven cannot\r\npurify. It is only in the unextinguished spark of reason within him that\r\nsalvation for man may ever be found, in the realization that he is his\r\nown star, and carries in his hands his own fate. The impulses of\r\nIndividualism and of Socialism alike prompt us to gain self-control and\r\nto learn the vast extent of our responsibility. The whole of humanity is\r\nworking for each of us; each of us must live worthy of that great\r\nresponsibility to humanity. By how fine a flash of insight Jesus\r\ndeclared that few could enter the Kingdom of Heaven! Not until the earth\r\nis purified of untold millions of its population will it ever become the\r\nHeaven of old dreamers, in which the elect walk spaciously and nobly,\r\nloving one another. Only in such spacious and pure air is it possible\r\nfor the individual to perfect himself, as a rose becomes perfect,\r\naccording to Dante's beautiful simile,[261] in order that he may spread\r\nabroad for others the fragrance that has been generated within him. If\r\none thinks of it, that seems a truism, yet, even in this twentieth\r\ncentury, how few, how very few, there are who know it!\r\n\r\nThis is why we cannot have too much Individualism, we cannot have too\r\nmuch Socialism. They play into each other's hands. To strengthen one is\r\nto give force to the other. The greater the vigour of both, the more\r\nvitally a society is progressing. \"I can no more call myself an\r\nIndividualist or a Socialist,\" said Henry George, \"than one who\r\nconsiders the forces by which the planets are held to their orbits could\r\ncall himself a centrifugalist or a centripetalist.\" To attain a society\r\nin which Individualism and Socialism are each carried to its extreme\r\npoint would be to attain to the society that lived in the Abbey of\r\nThelema, in the City of the Sun, in Utopia, in the land of Zarathustra,\r\nin the Garden of Eden, in the Kingdom of Heaven. It is a kingdom, no\r\ndoubt, that is, as Diderot expressed it, \"diablement ideal.\" But to-day\r\nwe hold in our hands more certainly than ever before the clues that were\r\nimperfectly foreshadowed by Plato, and what our fathers sought\r\nignorantly we may attempt by methods according to knowledge. No Utopia\r\nwas ever realized; and the ideal is a mirage that must ever elude us or\r\nit would cease to be ideal. Yet all our progress, if progress there be,\r\ncan only lie in setting our faces towards that goal to which Utopias and\r\nideals point.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[248] In the narrow sense Socialism is identical with the definite\r\neconomic doctrine of the Collectivistic organization of the productive\r\nand distributive work of society. It also possesses, as Bosanquet\r\nremarks (in an essay on \"Individualism and Socialism,\" in _The\r\nCivilization of Christendom_), \"a deeper meaning as a name for a human\r\ntendency that is operative throughout history.\" Every Collectivist is a\r\nSocialist, but not every Socialist would admit that he is a\r\nCollectivist. \"Moral Socialism,\" however, though not identical with\r\n\"Economic Socialism,\" tends to involve it.\r\n\r\n[249] The term \"Individualism,\" like the term \"Socialism,\" is used in\r\nvarying senses, and is not, therefore, satisfactory to everyone. Thus\r\nE.F.B. Fell (_The Foundations of Liberty_, 1908), regarding\r\n\"Individualism,\" as a merely negative term, prefers the term\r\n\"Personalism,\" to denote a more positive ideal. There is, however, by no\r\nmeans as any necessity to consider \"Individualism,\" a more negative term\r\nthan \"Socialism.\"\r\n\r\n[250] The inspiring appeal of Socialism to ardent minds is no doubt\r\nethical. \"The ethics of Socialism,\" says Kirkup, \"are closely akin to\r\nthe ethics of Christianity, if not identical with them.\" That, perhaps,\r\nis why Socialism is so attractive to some minds, so repugnant to others.\r\n\r\n[251] This idea was elaborated by Eimer in an appendix to his _Organic\r\nEvolution_ on the idea of the individual in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n[252] The term \"socialism\" is said to date from about the year 1835.\r\nLeroux claimed that he invented it, in opposition to the term\r\n\"individualism,\" but at that period it had become so necessary and so\r\nobvious a term that it is difficult to say positively by whom it was\r\nfirst used.\r\n\r\n[253] An important point which the Individualist may fairly bring forward\r\nin this connection is the tendency of Socialism to repress the energy of\r\nthe best worker among its officials at the expense of the public. Alike\r\nin government offices at Whitehall and in municipal offices in the town\r\nhalls there is a certain proportion of workers who find pleasure in\r\nputting forth their best energies at high pressure. But the majority\r\ntake care that work shall be carried on at low pressure, and that the\r\noutput shall not exceed a certain understood minimum. They ensure this\r\nby making things uncomfortable for the workers who exceed that minimum.\r\nThe gravity of this evil is scarcely yet realized. It could probably be\r\ncounteracted by so organizing promotion that the higher posts really\r\nwent to the officials distinguished by the quantity and the quality of\r\ntheir work. Pensions should also be affected by the same consideration.\r\nIn any case, the evil is serious, and is becoming more so since the\r\nnumber of public officials is constantly increasing. The Council of the\r\nLaw Society found some years ago that the cost of civil administration\r\nin England had increased between the years 1894 and 1904 from 19\r\nmillions to 25 millions, and, excluding the Revenue Departments, it is\r\nnow said to have gone up to 42 millions. It is an evil that will have to\r\nbe dealt with sooner or later.\r\n\r\n[254] Max Stirner wrote his work, _Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum_ (_The\r\nEgo and His Own_, in the English translation of Byington), in 1845. His\r\nlife has been written by John Henry Mackay (_Max Stirner: Sein Leben und\r\nSein Werk_), and an interesting study of Max Stirner (whose real name\r\nwas Schmidt) will be found in James Huneker's _Egoists_.\r\n\r\n[255] In the introduction to my earliest book, _The New Spirit_ (1889), I\r\nset forth this position, from which I have never departed: \"While we are\r\nsocializing all those things of which all have equal common need, we are\r\nmore and more tending to leave to the individual the control of those\r\nthings which in our complex civilization constitute individuality. We\r\nsocialize what we call our physical life in order that we may attain\r\ngreater freedom for what we call our spiritual life.\" No doubt such a\r\npoint of view was implicit in Ruskin and other previous writers, just as\r\nit has subsequently been set forth by Ellen Key and others, while from\r\nthe economic side it has been well formulated by Mr. J.A. Hobson in his\r\n_Evolution of Capital_: \"The _very raison d'etre_ of increased social\r\ncohesiveness is to economize and enrich the individual life, and to\r\nenable the play of individual energy to assume higher forms out of which\r\nmore individual satisfaction may accrue.\" \"Socialism will be of value,\"\r\nthought Oscar Wilde in his _Soul of Man_, \"simply because it will lead\r\nto Individualism.\" \"Socialism denies economic Individualism for any,\"\r\nsays Karl Noetzel (\"Zur Ethischen Begrundung des Sozialismus,\"\r\n_Sozialistische Monatshefte_, 1910, Heft 23), \"in order to make moral\r\nintellectual Individualism possible for all.\" And as it has been seen\r\nthat Socialism leads to Individualism, so it has also been seen that\r\nIndividualism, even on the ethical plane, leads to Socialism. \"You must\r\nlet the individual make his will a reality in the conduct of his life,\"\r\nBosanquet remarks in an essay already quoted, \"in order that it may be\r\npossible for him consciously to entertain the social purpose as a\r\nconstituent of his will. Without these conditions there is no social\r\norganism and no moral Socialism.... Each unit of the social organism has\r\nto embody his relations with the whole in his own particular work and\r\nwill; and in order to do this the individual must have a strength and\r\ndepth in himself proportional to and consisting of the relations which\r\nhe has to embody.\" Grant Allen long since clearly set forth the harmony\r\nbetween Individualism and Socialism in an article published in the\r\n_Contemporary Review_ in 1879.\r\n\r\n[256] An instructive illustration is furnished by the question of the\r\nrelation of the sexes, and elsewhere (_Studies in the Psychology of\r\nSex_, Vol. VI, \"Sex in Relation to Society\") I have sought to show that\r\nwe must distinguish between marriage, which is directly the affair of\r\nthe individuals primarily concerned, and procreation, which is mainly\r\nthe concern of society.\r\n\r\n[257] See, for instance, the opinion of the former Chief Inspector of\r\nElementary Schools in England, Mr. Edmond Holmes, _What Is and What\r\nMight Be_ (1911). He points out that true education must be\r\n\"self-realization,\" and that the present system of \"education\" is\r\nentirely opposed to self-realization. Sir John Gorst, again, has\r\nrepeatedly attacked the errors of the English State system of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n[258] The phrase _Laissez faire_ is sometimes used as though it were the\r\nwatchword of a party which graciously accorded a free hand to the Devil\r\nto do his worst. As a matter of fact, it was simply a phrase adopted by\r\nthe French economists of the eighteenth century to summarize the\r\nconclusion of their arguments against the antiquated restrictions which\r\nwere then stifling the trade and commerce of France (see G. Weuleresse,\r\n_Le Mouvement Physiocratique en France_, 1910, Vol. II, p. 17). Properly\r\nunderstood, it is not a maxim which any party need be ashamed to own.\r\n\r\n[259] I would again repeat that I do not regard legislation as a channel\r\nof true eugenic reform. As Bateson well says (_op. cit._ p. 15); \"It is\r\nnot the tyrannical and capricious interference of a half-informed\r\nmajority which can safely mould or purify a population, but rather that\r\nsimplification of instinct for which we ever hope, which fuller\r\nknowledge alone can make possible.\" Even the subsidising of\r\nunexceptionable parents, as the same writer remarks, cannot be viewed\r\nwith enthusiasm. \"If we picture to ourselves the kind of persons who\r\nwould infallibly be chosen as examples of 'civic worth' the prospect is\r\nnot very attractive.\"\r\n\r\n[260] \"Aristotle, herein the organ and exponent of the Greek national\r\nmind,\" remarks Gomperz, \"understood by the hygiene of the soul the\r\navoidance of all extremes, the equilibrium of the powers, the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of aptitudes, none of which is allowed to starve or paralyse\r\nthe others.\" Gomperz points out that this individual morality\r\ncorresponded to the characteristics of the Greek national religion--its\r\ninclusiveness and spaciousness, its freedom and serenity, its\r\nennoblement alike of energetic action and passive enjoyment (Gomperz,\r\n_Greek Thinkers_, Eng. Trans., Vol. III, p. 13).\r\n\r\n[261] _Convito_, IV, 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n(_Names of Authors quoted are italicized._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbortion, facultative, 99\r\n\r\nAge of consent, 288 _et seq._\r\n\r\nAggeneration, 24\r\n\r\nAlcohol, legislative control of, 277 _et seq._, 295 _et seq._\r\n\r\nAlcoholism, 33, 41\r\n\r\n_Allen, Grant_, 394\r\n\r\n_Allen, W.H._, 11\r\n\r\nAncestry, the study of, 2\r\n\r\n_Angell, Norman_, 321\r\n\r\n_Anthony, Susan_, 111\r\n\r\nAntimachus of Colophon, 117\r\n\r\nAnti-militarism, 328\r\n\r\n_Aristotle_, 403\r\n\r\n_Ashby_, 33\r\n\r\n_Asnurof_, 283\r\n\r\n_Aubry_, 42\r\n\r\n_Augustine_, St., 5\r\n\r\nAustralia, birth-rate in, 146 _et seq._, 162;\r\n  moral legislation in, 291\r\n\r\n_Azoulay_, 188\r\n\r\n\r\nBachofen, 91\r\n\r\n_Baines, Sir J.A._, 153\r\n\r\n_Barnes, Earl_, 223\r\n\r\n_Basedow_, 244\r\n\r\n_Bateson_, 27, 194, 402\r\n\r\nBeatrice, Dante's, 122\r\n\r\nBeaufront, L. de, 372, 373\r\n\r\nBebel, 71, 88\r\n\r\n_Becker, R._, 118\r\n\r\n_Belbeze_, 211\r\n\r\n_Benecke, E.F.M._, 117\r\n\r\nBergsonian philosophy, 31\r\n\r\n_Bertillon, G._, 63\r\n\r\n_Bertillon, J._, 278\r\n\r\n_Beveridge_, 171\r\n\r\nBible in religious education, 230, 240\r\n\r\n_Billroth_, 353\r\n\r\n_Bingham_, 274\r\n\r\nBirth-rate, in France, 17, 136, 188;\r\n  in England, 17, 137;\r\n  in Germany, 17, 138;\r\n  in Russia, 25;\r\n  in United States, 141;\r\n  in Canada, 144;\r\n  in Australasia, 146, 162;\r\n  in Japan, 155;\r\n  in China, 156;\r\n  among savages, 167;\r\n  significance of a falling, 134 _et seq._;\r\n  in relation to death-rate, 7, 150\r\n\r\n_Blease, W.
