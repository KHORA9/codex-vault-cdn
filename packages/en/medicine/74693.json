It thrilled me to meet the creator of my\r\nboyhood’s admiration, “Hashimura Togo,” and I was pleased if unprepared\r\nwhen he wanted me to put my adventures--then half completed--into\r\na book. I remember our three days’ trip to Mbengga to see the\r\nfire-walkers; all the way I was enthralled with his experiences as a\r\nwriter on the other side of the world; he could talk two hundred words\r\nto the minute, a record that surpasses mine. Our meeting resulted in a\r\ndesultory correspondence that covered several years. When I came home\r\nwith a trunkful of my own data I naturally turned to him for help; and\r\nI want to thank him for the patient editorial advice through which I\r\nhave been able to assemble a quantity of rather mixed material, and to\r\nput it into some form.\r\n\r\nI have so many to thank besides those mentioned in the text--few have\r\nbeen other than helpful. Probably I am the most grateful to the British\r\nin the South Pacific colonies, officials and laymen. If a Britisher had\r\ncome to an American colony and assumed the critical role to which my\r\njob compelled me, he would have been tarred and feathered and ridden\r\nout of bounds. Their long tolerance reminds me of the Arizona saloon\r\nmotto: “Don’t Shoot the Pianist. He’s Doing His Damndest.”\r\n\r\nWe were made to feel welcome in the various communities as we moved\r\nalong. My daughter, Sara Celia, was born in Suva, Fiji; I owned a house\r\nthere, and on momentous occasions had my vote solicited by Henry Marks,\r\nAlport Barker and Pat Costello. I belonged to the Fiji Club. Uncle Bill\r\nPaley and I settled mine and the world’s affairs in a few minutes every\r\nmorning. What more has the future to offer?\r\n\r\nSpace did not permit me to emphasize the admiration I have for New\r\nZealand’s high conduct in native affairs. I had the best advice\r\nand cooperation, from the Permanent Head of the Prime Minister’s\r\nDepartment and the Director General of Health down through the Civil\r\nService.\r\n\r\nIf I had the privilege of making out my Personal Honor Role I should\r\ncertainly put Fiji’s Colonial Sugar Refining Company close to the\r\nhead of it. Without their W. P. Dixon and F. C. T. Lord I could not\r\nhave progressed far in my Fijian endeavors; for in 1922 the island\r\ncommunications were next to nothing, and almost every hookworm district\r\nwas over the cane lands they controlled, and opened up for me. We\r\nlived in their quarters, used their track-cars and railroad, had the\r\nassistance of the managers and underofficials of this whacking big\r\nAustralian concern, operating in both Fiji and North Queensland.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to thank my Field Inspectors, young fellows who knew how\r\nto do about anything--except complain; men like Chris Kendrick, Kenny\r\nFooks and Bill Tully,--whose Irish mother said, “Doctor, you’ll take\r\ncare of Willie, won’t you?”--and the wild American lad, Byron Beach.\r\n\r\nAnd Malakai, the Fijian practitioner with an inflexible medical\r\nconscience. In jungle, swamp or canoe, nobody would wish for a stronger\r\nheart or a better brain.\r\n\r\nI was just an item in the Rockefeller Foundation’s globe-circling\r\nhumanitarianism. Dr. Victor Heiser gave me my first job in the South\r\nPacific; Dr. Sawyer, now Director for the International Health\r\nDivision, turned the tide for me when my favorite plan seemed about to\r\nfail. With Dr. Heiser I have tramped over Fiji and Samoa, agreeing or\r\ndisagreeing on various questions of tropical health. Once or twice he\r\nturned to me and asked, “Lambert, why don’t you write a book?”\r\n\r\nWell, this is the book.\r\n\r\n  S. M.

I’m sending you to\r\nPapua.”\r\n\r\nDr. Victor G. Heiser, the Rockefeller Foundation’s famous Director of\r\nthe East, made this announcement as if Papua were across the street.\r\n\r\n“That’s fine, Doctor,” I said, “perfectly fine.”\r\n\r\nPapua? Where was Papua? Vainly I fished for scraps of geography and\r\npulled up impressions of palmy islands where black warriors asked\r\nguests how they liked their missionary, rare or well done.\r\n\r\nDr. Heiser sat behind a modest desk in one of the smallest rooms at\r\n61 Broadway, delivering a sort of curtain speech to an act that had\r\ntaken longer than a Chinese play, an act which had played through the\r\nwar summer of 1918. I had finally found a successor and resigned my\r\nsuperintendency of the United Fruit Company’s hospital in Costa Rica; I\r\nwas in New York to offer my services. But Uncle Sam wasn’t looking for\r\nmedical officers with weak eyes.\r\n\r\nNow Dr. Heiser’s kindly voice was praising and instructing one of the\r\nfamily, for at last I had joined up with the Foundation. There he was,\r\nkneeing his desk, telling me nothing about Papua, saying that my Costa\r\nRican and Mexican experience had particularly fitted me for work with\r\nthe International Health Board, not mentioning that war had taken away\r\nmany of their physicians. He dwelt on the preparatory three months’\r\nhookworm training I had already taken, under the Foundation’s auspices,\r\namong the hillbillies of Mississippi ... kept me moving, didn’t it,\r\ncanvassing from door to door?... Lambert, you can work a lot faster\r\ndown in the South Pacific, where you’ll lecture and treat in batches\r\nof from fifty to five hundred.... You’ll have to cover a lot of ground\r\ndown there.... Take along plenty of khaki, and no evening clothes....\r\nGet your family ready and start day after tomorrow.\r\n\r\n“And on your way to Papua, Lambert, you’d better report to Waite,\r\nwho’s in charge of our work in Australia. There’s quite a hookworm\r\ncampaign going on in North Queensland. Good place to brush up on what\r\nyou’ll need in Papua. You’ll find the Australians good fellows, like\r\nour Westerners, rough and generous and tolerant--they haven’t had to\r\njam together in big cities and get small-minded.”\r\n\r\nDuring our argumentative stage, I had told Dr. Heiser about a mining\r\nsyndicate’s offer to take me down to Peru. I didn’t bring that up\r\nagain, or mention General Gorgas’ half-promise to forgive my blinky\r\neyes and commission me in the venereal section of the Medical Corps.\r\n\r\nWhen I left that morning I was under the spell of the Heiser charm;\r\na charm that has sent armies of scientific men, great and small, to\r\nfollow jungle trails all over this planet, and work until they drop.\r\nIn later years I walked with him along some of those trails, and my\r\nadmiration for him increased every step of the way. There is a godlike\r\nsomething about Heiser that will never let him fall from the pedestal\r\nhe deserves. Grant him clay toes if you wish, he is still a colossus\r\nwho has bestridden the field of public health for twenty years--and\r\nbeen the target of much professional jealousy. In 1937 when I was at a\r\nLeague Conference in Java I heard an envious Yankee voice say, “Yes,\r\nI’ve read his _American Doctor’s Odyssey_, and I wonder why he didn’t\r\ncall it _Alone in the Orient_.” Which gave me the luxury of a reply:\r\n“Did you watch him inaugurate public health work in the Philippines?\r\n_Alone in the Orient_ describes it rather well.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI found an atlas and looked up Papua. Rather dully I was informed that\r\nPapua lay on the southeastern edge of New Guinea, the second largest\r\nisland in the world--the Australian Continent’s hottest neighbor, no\r\ndoubt, since its northern shoulder jogged the equator. The extremely\r\nsavage names of its numerous tribes, the aimless fertility of its soil,\r\nits wealth of gold, copper and pearls, struck only dull fire on my\r\nimagination. I was going to a place called Papua, not to flirt with\r\nrubber-bellied brunettes in grass skirts, but to search sensibly for\r\nyaws, malaria, dysentery, tuberculosis and intestinal parasites. And\r\nto rout out the hookworm as tamely as I had poked him up in polluted\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nThat was 1918, when a trip to Paris and back was something to talk\r\nabout. The armistice hadn’t yet sent back a million doughboys with a\r\nsmattering of obscene French. The world cruise hadn’t risen as a major\r\nindustry. Today any debutante who has sauntered around the globe can\r\ntell you more about Fiji fire-walking and Arabian sword-swallowers than\r\nanybody but a professional explorer knew then.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo, the hereditary Lambert is not a geographer. We are a homebody\r\nfamily, and I often wonder how the colonial Lamberts ever found courage\r\nto cross over from England to seventeenth-century New Jersey. They\r\ncertainly stayed put when they got here; nothing but hunger and Indian\r\nraids could budge them. My father, who was a tanner and often used his\r\nbest leather trying to teach me civility, was looked upon as something\r\nof a sea rover because he once drove mules along the Delaware and\r\nHudson Canal towpath. Relatives in Ellenville, New York, where I was\r\nborn, paled when they learned that Father was moving us to Little Falls.\r\n\r\nOur pious Methodists always regarded Father as a freethinker; and\r\nwasn’t it like him to want Sylvester to be a doctor? Mr. Babcock, head\r\nof our Free Academy in West Winfield, was even more radical. A boy\r\nought to have a college education before he started studying medicine.\r\nI had worked with the tannery gang long enough, and had learned too\r\nmany of the rich, brown oaths they spat out with their chewing tobacco.\r\nHamilton College was the place to smooth me out for medical school.\r\nHamilton College! My mother’s hands went up at the spectral idea of a\r\nplace so remote that Sylvester would have to go overnight, by train.\r\n\r\nI entered with the class of 1903, and the thought of all my father\r\nsacrificed to send me there made me a rather earnest student--that, and\r\nhis threat of more tannery, if I didn’t make good. I am thankful that\r\nHamilton and the Syracuse Medical, which I later attended, were both\r\nsmall, for in small classes the instructor knows the needs and failings\r\nof every student. I was a hard worker, but not a grind. I found time\r\nfor football, which toughened the tannery boy for harder years to come.\r\nTrips with the team to rival colleges were early adventures in foreign\r\ntravel. Colgate, swollen with toothpaste money, was easy fruit for us\r\nthen. Williams rubbed our noses in the mud to the tune of 4-0--and I\r\nwept, limping off the field.\r\n\r\nSometimes in my late middle age I awake from sleep swearing. I have\r\nbeen dreaming of a game with the Carlisle Indians. That big Injun, Red\r\nWater, is on the line opposite me, tall as a church, never losing his\r\ngrin. The ball is snapped and his long arm reaches tenderly over me,\r\ngets the seat of my britches....\r\n\r\nIn 1904 I was prepared for Johns Hopkins, but Mother wanted to know\r\nwhat I’d be doing with myself, ’way over in Maryland. Syracuse was in\r\nNew York State, anyhow, and that was far enough for anybody.\r\n\r\nSyracuse had a faculty disproportionately large and able for so small\r\nan enrollment. The ideal of scholarship was Spartan; if a student’s\r\nnose roved from the grindstone it was pushed back again. The quizzes\r\nwere little inquisitions, the recitations no place for a sleepwalker.\r\nTo study under Elsner, Jacobson and Levy was to appreciate Jewish\r\nrespect for scholarship. Dr. Steenson, of the Department of Pathology,\r\nhad a time-keeper’s complex and you missed his eight-thirty bell at\r\nyour own risk. We called him “Johnnie Cockeye,” for his devotion to\r\nthe gonococcus germ. I stared through the microscope for interminable\r\nhours, seeing but little on the slides. My eyes were already going,\r\nbut I could read easily. Before I came to class I knew, theoretically,\r\nwhat I was supposed to see under the glass--and that’s how I coped with\r\nSteenson’s sudden quizzes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe very distinguished Dr. Frank William Marlow, graduate of the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons, is dead now, but he crowned his career with a book\r\ncalled _The Relative Position of Rest of the Eyes_. A course under him\r\nput my eyesight, quite literally, on the blink. And this is how it came\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nToward the end of my third year my brother became seriously ill,\r\nand I had to take him to Arizona. There I discovered, to my bald\r\nastonishment, that this Lambert had a wandering foot. In Tucson\r\nI obeyed a mad impulse and joined the crazy medical unit of a\r\nconstruction gang, working down the West Coast of Mexico. I had time to\r\ngrow romantic when I came to the fine old hacienda of Mr. Eugene Tays,\r\nan American mining engineer. The dark eyes of his pretty daughter,\r\nEloisa, melted my every ambition to go home and plug again at a stiff\r\nmedical course. She was half Spanish, one of the influential Vegas\r\naround San Blas; but she had enough Scotch common sense to tell me to\r\ngo home and graduate. When I had a practice of my own, she said, I\r\ncould come back and marry her. She had to wait five years, but she kept\r\nher promise.\r\n\r\nSo I went back to Syracuse, weeks behind in my work and facing the\r\nfinal examination in ophthalmology. There were only three days and\r\nnights to make up lost time. I had nothing but a photographic memory to\r\nhelp me out. With a shrewdness born of despair I cracked the book at\r\nMarlow’s pet subjects. When I finally blinked my way into the classroom\r\nI had committed to memory a half-dozen picked pages. I was in luck;\r\niritis, conjunctivitis, glaucoma and myopia were all there to be dealt\r\nwith. I wrote the answers almost word for word from the pages my mind\r\nhad photographed. Doctor Marlow was so impressed that he showed my\r\npaper around the faculty; it was fairly well decided that I had been\r\ncribbing. I might just as well have been, for after a long, tired sleep\r\nI found that I had forgotten half the stuff I had crammed. And my eyes\r\nwere never the same after that ordeal.\r\n\r\nNo use going so early into the technicalities of my half-ruined\r\nsight. Microscopy became all-important to me over twenty-five years\r\nof service. I have been very fortunate in the assistants I found or\r\ntrained to operate the lens for me. With glasses, my middle vision and\r\nfar vision remained fairly good. And this was fortunate, too, for in my\r\nwanderings I have been required to look on many beautiful and horrible\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nPhotographic memory-plates are apt to fade rapidly. Several years\r\nlater, I was admitted to the Costa Rica Medical Faculty, after another\r\nfeat of intensive cramming. Costa Rican professional standards are\r\nhigh, and not too friendly to Yankee doctors. Though I passed the\r\nvery severe examination, I am not sure it was my learning that won\r\nmy degree; my initiation included many cocktails with a great many\r\ninfluential medical officers. Those things help in Central America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was in the calmer period, following four years in Mexico, where I\r\npractised medicine between raids by Carranzistas, Villistas, Yaquis.\r\nTwice I established myself with my wife and baby on the West Coast,\r\nnear Eloisa’s home. Twice, because the United States Navy ordered us to\r\nescape with our lives, we left the country as refugees.\r\n\r\nThose years were heavy with adventure. There was the time when smallpox\r\nbroke over the helpless people like a cloud of poison gas; I worked\r\nalone among hundreds of peons who were anti-vaccinationists to a man\r\nand died in their own stench, hidden under dirty clothes. Time and\r\ntime again I performed emergency amputations on kitchen tables, my\r\nChinese cook giving the anesthetic. I diagnosed malaria on myself, and\r\nfound my mistake when I came down with a bug of an atypical typhoid\r\ngroup. I lost forty pounds from dysentery and Donna Angela nourished\r\nmy convalescence with iguana stew. I brought an hysteria-stricken girl\r\nback from a state like death by scaring her with a sharp knife. One\r\nday I gasped with horror, seeing a native midwife promoting childbirth\r\nby tying a woman to high rafters and jerking her legs. One afternoon\r\nI barricaded my wife and baby behind sacked beans, and performed a\r\ntonsilectomy while the Yaquis broke into a liquor warehouse. Still,\r\nthere were sweet, mild months under a benevolent Aztec sun; then there\r\ncame a night when I smelled burning houses and heard the wild-horse\r\nsqueal of women being raped by Indians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne adventure I might record, if briefly. The dreaded Yaquis had joined\r\nforces with General Obregón. Colonel Antunez, like a good fellow, was\r\nbossing the Indians. They had been letting us alone at Mochis, but\r\ndanger was always brooding in a place that never knew which side it was\r\non. One day, to my discomfiture, this Colonel Antunez came limping in.\r\nHe complained of pain in his groin, and a large swelling indicated an\r\noperation. He urged me to be quick; he had to be at the front, he was\r\nthe only man whom Obregón trusted with the wild Yaquis.\r\n\r\nWhen I got in with the knife I found a tumor that extended into the big\r\nblood vessels. Removing it was a serious major operation. As soon as he\r\nwas out from under the anesthetic the war horse snorted again. He must\r\nbe up and back at the front. I told him that his condition necessitated\r\nthree weeks of complete rest; he got so excited that his temperature\r\nshot up and I had to stop arguing. As he recovered, his officers and\r\ntheir Yaquis were always around.\r\n\r\nOne morning I found his bed empty. They had smuggled him away in a\r\njolting truck, through a cold rain. He died at Navajoa, of peritonitis\r\nor phlebitis, one of the inevitable results.\r\n\r\nNext day I was called to the office of His Honor, the _Sindico_ of\r\nMochis, and was surprised by a captain’s tap on my shoulder. I was\r\nunder arrest. It was a long trip toward the death-house. They jailed me\r\nfirst at Mochis, where I managed to have three words with Meade Lewis,\r\na little red-headed friend of mine who was American consul. I told him\r\nwhat I guessed: I was booked to be shot because one of Obregón’s most\r\nvalued officers had died after my operation.\r\n\r\nMy tumbrel to Topolobampo was a track car, bristling with rifles; half\r\nthe population and their dogs tagged along for a look at the gringo who\r\nwas going to be tried--which was a synonym for being executed. I had\r\nbeen allowed one glance at Eloisa and our baby. The cell in which I\r\nspent ten days was a Yaqui butcher shop when it wasn’t occupied by the\r\ncondemned. Into a fragrance of spoiled meat my jailor came at last to\r\ninform me that the trial and shooting were set for Saturday morning.\r\nAnd here it was Friday.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning I had prepared my sinful Methodist-born soul for\r\na stern hereafter, when the officer in command swung wide the door,\r\nsaluted deferentially and proclaimed, “Doctor, you are free!”\r\n\r\nNot until I had rejoined my family did I learn what this, or anything\r\nelse, was about. I had become an international affair, they said.\r\nConsul Meade Lewis had fairly pulled the cables loose between\r\nTopolobampo and Washington. William Jennings Bryan had sent a cruiser\r\ndown from San Diego. The captain of that cruiser burned the wires to\r\nMexico City with a Richard Harding Davis sort of message: “Release\r\nLambert at once or I’m coming to get him.”\r\n\r\nIt made a ripping newspaper story. Away up in Newark my brother Fred\r\nhad been visiting some Mexican friends who told him how wonderfully I\r\nwas doing in Mochis. After the party Fred passed a subway newsstand and\r\nsaw the black headline, “JAIL DOOR SWINGS WIDE FOR LAMBERT.” He was\r\nproud of the family when he read how William Jennings Bryan had taken\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have jotted down these few facts about myself so that my readers\r\nmay try to decide how well experience had equipped me to be an\r\ninternational health physician. I hope they’re not as unsure as I was\r\nthat day in September, 1918, when I put my family aboard the train for\r\nour first long pull toward Papua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBY THE RAM’S HORN ROUTE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was early May, 1920, before I saw the sterile hills and corrugated\r\niron roofs of Papua’s capital, Port Moresby. As they traveled in\r\nthose days it would have taken the ordinary voyager six weeks from\r\nSan Francisco. I was no ordinary voyager, it turned out. The little\r\nstopover in North Queensland, which Dr. Heiser had suggested for me,\r\nheld me there a year and a half in one of the most strenuous hookworm\r\ncampaigns in the history of the parasite. The minute I saw Dr. Waite,\r\nwho was our chief worker there, I was shocked by the picture of what\r\nthe tropics can do to a man engaged in the benevolent business of\r\npublic health. Malaria had yellowed his skin, and a horrid fungus\r\ncalled “sprue” had ravaged him so that he was going home to die. He\r\ndidn’t die; but I did very nearly, of the same foul blight that lays\r\nbare a man’s intestinal tract from mouth to anus.\r\n\r\nFieldworkers for the Foundation don’t go about bragging of the bugs\r\nthey pick up along the way. In twenty-one years I think I caught\r\neverything the tropics have to offer, with the exception of yaws,\r\nvenereal and leprosy. I’m not sure about leprosy. It’s so slow to\r\ndevelop you can’t be sure you haven’t got it until you’ve died of\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were leaving North Queensland at last, in the seagoing washtub\r\n_Morinda_, Papua bound. In the Australian hot country I had been the\r\nBuffalo Bill and the Jim Farley of a whirlwind campaign. I had acted as\r\ndirector there until October, 1919, when Dr. W. A. Sawyer came out to\r\ntake charge of Australasia. Then there were six months of it, helping\r\nhim organize.\r\n\r\nThe North Queensland campaign had offered the combined excitement of\r\na _Blitzkrieg_ and a Methodist revival. I had shouted my sprue-sore\r\nmouth raw. I had ballyhooed a Yankee’s message to Australasia--privies\r\nand more privies! Our greatest popular hygienist, Mr. Chic Sale,\r\ncould never have been prouder of his Temple of Necessity than I of\r\nmy fly-proof, worm-tight w.c. when it was accepted as a model by the\r\ncommittees of North Queensland. I was preaching a crusade, and I was\r\nheeded. At Shire Council meetings, soil-pollution questions flamed like\r\ntorches; labor unions called strikes on and off, excited by thousands\r\nof feet of lumber to be hauled and nailed together into latrines;\r\ncommercial travelers took up the cause and were asking their customers,\r\n“Have you got one of those things the Yankees are peddling up and down\r\nthe coast?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow it was May, 1920, and that was over. The little _Morinda_ was\r\noff Cairns; we would be moving, maybe, when the tide rose. I laughed\r\nwickedly, remembering what the shattered Dr. Waite said when he left\r\nNorth Queensland to my tender care. “Lambert, if you stick, you’ll\r\nprobably go out feet-first.” Well, my feet were still under the deck\r\nchair where I loafed and totaled up eighteen months of hard campaigning.\r\n\r\nWe had supervised the building of 4,000 model latrines and repaired\r\n4,000 more up to the standard. We had treated thousands and thousands\r\nof hookworm cases; from Proserpine to Cooktown we had examined 98\r\nper cent of the population for intestinal parasites. We hadn’t found\r\ninfection heavy, but I gloated over the change wrought in many\r\npeople by the humble expedient of a decent privy behind every house.\r\nBrightness was coming back to eyes and skin. Healthy children were\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\nYes, the Australians are like our Westerners. When there is work to\r\nbe done they go at it wholeheartedly. Subsequent improvement in North\r\nQueensland’s health shows what these people can do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story of the hookworm disease and its cure is a twice-told tale, or\r\na thousand times told in the medical libraries. But because the subject\r\nis pertinent to my years of work, let me say a little about a scourge\r\nwhich was so widespread in 1918 that it had but one rival--malaria.\r\nJust as Dr. Heiser said, one third of our planet’s inhabitants had\r\nhookworm.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the oldest diseases recorded in history. The Ebers\r\npapyrus, dating back to 1500 B.C., speaks of “worms in the abdomen”\r\nand makes the hieroglyphic guess that the trouble was caused by “much\r\nhandling of sand.” It is more likely that the infection came from the\r\nsacred scarab, a creature so unclean that it is commonly called the\r\n“dung beetle.” Moses said to his wanderers in the wilderness, “And\r\nthou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou\r\nwilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back\r\nand cover that which cometh from thee.” Without that wise precaution\r\nagainst the infesting parasite, the Children of Israel might never have\r\nseen their Promised Land.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks probably had a name for it; ages later an Italian doctor\r\ncalled it _Ankylostoma_, which is fairly good Greek for “hookmouth.”\r\nCaesar’s legions carried it from Africa into Italy. In 1838 Dr. Dubini\r\nof Milan found 105 infected post mortems, and a year later it was\r\ndiscovered that Italian laborers had conveyed hookworm into the Alps.\r\nAustralia got her dose of it when she imported Orientals and Islanders\r\nto work her plantations.\r\n\r\nHookworm and his wife came to America with Africa’s compliments to\r\nslavery. No worm travels far on its own belly; it is the human belly,\r\nto mix a metaphor, that gives wings to the pest. During the Spanish\r\nAmerican War Colonel Bailey K. Ashford of our Medical Corps studied\r\n“coffee picker’s anemia” in Puerto Rico; he segregated the hookworm in\r\nthese cases and wired the news to Dr. Charles W. Stiles of the United\r\nStates Health Service. Stiles became our pioneer investigator in the\r\nSouth, something of a martyr to science. He called this variety of\r\nworm _Necator americanus_ (American murderer), although he might more\r\nproperly have named it _Necator africanus_. The Negro’s habitation of\r\nour soil could be proved by the infection he has left behind, even\r\nthough the race should disappear. Scientific investigators like Darling\r\nhave studied hookworm--content to trace great racial migrations.\r\n\r\nInvestigation and treatment of the hookworm disease is no job for a\r\nflorist. Much of the work has to do with microscopic examination of\r\nhuman excreta. But the physician is a realist, and every function of\r\nthe body has, for him, the equal rights of a true democracy.\r\n\r\nHere is the life cycle of this dreadful little bloodsucker: Its eggs\r\ncannot hatch in the intestine, where the hungry mother clings and lays\r\nthem by thousands. They must pass out with the bowel movement and lie\r\nexposed to moist, warm, shady air; under these conditions, they hatch\r\nin from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, and begin their progress as\r\ntiny larvae in search of human flesh. They infest the soil for several\r\nfeet around the filth in which they have incubated. Enterprising ones\r\ncrawl up weeds and will even bore their way into ankles under thin\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the skin the embryo finds the blood stream and makes its\r\nlong pilgrimage--through the heart, through the lungs, up the throat;\r\nthen down into its destined home, the upper intestine, where it fastens\r\nits teeth and grows by what it feeds on, human blood. On one drop of\r\nblood a day it grows almost to the size of a pin and develops jaws as\r\nsteely strong as wire-cutters. Multiply these blood-drops by a hundred,\r\nby a thousand, and watch the pale anemia that lays the sufferer open to\r\nthe first epidemic that comes along.\r\n\r\nIn infected districts the health physician’s job was routine diagnosis\r\nand routine treatment. When we had to treat and survey whole villages\r\nand tribes within a limited time we gathered as many as we could into\r\nan audience and lectured them in whatever language they happened to\r\nspeak. After the lecture we would hand them out small tin containers,\r\neach marked with a person’s name. We told them carefully how to put\r\na small portion of each individual’s next bowel movement into the\r\ntin with his name. We urged that all tins be returned next morning.\r\nThese specimens we usually examined by the “Willis salt flotation”\r\nmethod. This routine was invented by a brilliant young Dr. Willis, an\r\nAustralian whom I broke in during the campaign in 1919. In the Willis\r\ntest a specimen of excreta the size of a small filbert is mixed in a\r\ntin container with saturated salt solution. The solution comes level\r\nwith the top of the container, and a glass slide is laid over it.\r\nThe eggs concentrate by floating to the surface and are lifted with\r\nthe salt solution when the glass is raised. Under the microscope the\r\nfloating eggs can be seen. When the Willis test proved positive the\r\npatients were set aside for treatment--if we had the time and the\r\ndrugs to finish the job. Those were the days of “the awful oil of\r\nchenopodium,” as it was often called. It was regarded as a specific; it\r\nwas relatively ineffective, and dangerous to use with large groups. I\r\nshall go into that later.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work planned for Papua was the making of “surveys,” which\r\nmeans a medical census of vast areas as remote from our usual earthly\r\nexperience as so many lunar landscapes. Perhaps I am running a little\r\nahead of my story and putting too much stress on ankylostomiasis, the\r\nhookworm disease. Our later work carried us into investigations of\r\nevery tropical malady, from ringworm to leprosy.\r\n\r\nAt last Papua and novel adventures lay ahead of me, if we ever got\r\nthere. The _Morinda_ was poking her distracted snub nose into blue\r\nwater, doing her darnedest. It was Sunday morning and our skipper was\r\nan old-fashioned practical joker. Captain Teddy Hillman, brief of\r\nbone and round of belly, solemnly invited me to his cabin to hear his\r\nphonograph play “Shall We Gather at the River?” Sadly he asked me how\r\nI liked it, and when I said, “Fine, you old so-and-so,” it was somehow\r\nthe perfect reply, for he spatted my knee and crowed, “Then we’ll make\r\nyou a member of the Gin Club!” Gin Club initiates ordered drinks by\r\npushing buttons that had needles concealed in them. The drinks came in\r\nthe sort of glasses you order at trick-stores; lift one and it squirts\r\ngin over your shirt-front. All very adolescent, but anything went on\r\nslow-going junks like the _Morinda_.\r\n\r\nThe job ahead was much on my mind. We had been given seven months to\r\ncover a Territory which, to a large part, had defied explorers, where\r\nthe census had been little more than guesswork, where estimates placed\r\na thousand natives for every two Europeans. The inspectors I brought\r\nwith me were four of the six men I had planned to put in charge of\r\nseparate surveys or use for laboratory work. They were Australian boys,\r\nexcept Chris Kendrick, a tropics-seasoned Englishman and one of the\r\nablest helpers I have ever sent into the field; with a sort of planned\r\nrecklessness he used his head so well that he might have gone through\r\nhell and brought back the Devil’s hookworms. With few exceptions all\r\nmy inspectors had that sporting spirit--“Tomorrow, by the living God,\r\nwe’ll try the game again.” The youngest of the ones who came with me\r\non the _Morinda_ was Bill Tully, only eighteen; the oldest was thirty.\r\nA terrific shortage in tropical physicians had made helpers like these\r\nan absolute necessity. They had been trained to diagnose and treat a\r\nlimited number of native diseases and to lead our dark safaris wherever\r\nthe work called them, from gloomy swamp to savage mountaintop. A man’s\r\njob, and they were men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe stood on a Port Moresby dock and blinked at a collection of hot\r\ntin roofs, the white man’s gift to the tropics. Sweltering, steaming.\r\nThe town was on the dry fringe of an island famous for moisture; the\r\nmerciless sun seemed to dry up everything but sweat. A crew of Papuans\r\ncame to our relief, thunderously pushing along small flat cars to\r\ncarry our freight and baggage. They were big blacks with oiled skins\r\nand nothing on but _lavalavas_. Their bushes of hair were two or three\r\nfeet in diameter; jolly smiles relieved the savage look. These were the\r\nfirst Papuans I had seen, and already I was learning a word of their\r\nlanguage. Glancing respectfully toward me they repeated it, “_Bogabada,\r\nBogabada!_” This, I thought, was some native honorific. I took the\r\nsalute gracefully. “Just what does _Bogabada_ mean?” I asked the Irish\r\ncustoms inspector. “Big belly,” he said.\r\n\r\nSome of my 235 pounds I dropped in the strenuous months that were to\r\nfollow. However, I knew that _Bogabada_ would still stick by me.\r\n\r\nMy Papuans rolled the luggage up a corrugated iron street to the\r\ncorrugated iron hotel. Ryan’s Hotel became my headquarters. The bedroom\r\nwalls ran about seven feet high; above them to the ceiling was a great\r\nopen space which let in breezes, bats and mosquitoes. If elephants\r\ncould fly they would have made it, too. These ventilation holes\r\nbreathed the very breath of scandal, for you could hear every whisper,\r\nand wonder who were paired off now. Like most tropical hotels it was\r\nthe home of dissatisfied customers; they drank excessively, they said,\r\nto drown the taste of Ryan’s food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost at once I assumed the role of lobbyist for human health.\r\nFinancial details had been arranged. Papua, Australia and the\r\nFoundation were to share expenses equally. When I saw Governor Murray I\r\nfound him polite but vague, with a smile that let me know that our work\r\nhad been thrust upon him, and that every hookworm we might find would\r\nbe an added insult to his administration, something that would lead to\r\ntrouble with the overlords in Melbourne.\r\n\r\nHe quoted discouraging figures, and said that census-taking in Papua\r\ncouldn’t be much more than an estimate. When you put the population\r\nfigure at 300,000 you always had to say “more or less.” There were\r\nso many places that white men seldom or never saw. How could you be\r\naccurate about a Territory that covered 87,786 square miles on the\r\nmainland alone, and 90,540 when you counted in the outlying islands?\r\nYou had to tackle mountains that were practically unclimbable, streams\r\nthat were unnavigable and tribes that even explorers couldn’t dig out.\r\nHe stroked a graying mustache over a withering mouth.... Yes, his own\r\nmedical service was quite adequate, he thought. (Fading eyes strayed a\r\nlittle, peering to see which way Parliament was going to jump.) Yes,\r\nLambert, this Rockefeller idea might do some good here.... When could\r\nwe dine?\r\n\r\nI have had time to reverse my first opinion of Governor Murray, who\r\nlived to be over eighty and died with a fine administrative record.\r\nHe didn’t happen to like us, that was all. So I had to go to the very\r\ncompetent Chief Medical Officer, who understood the situation exactly\r\nand gave us the most generous help. The planters backed us all the way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI decided to begin with short surveys of plantations lying around\r\nPort Moresby. Heiser and Waite had told me I needn’t fool with the\r\nvillages; all the parasites were on the plantations. I hadn’t been out\r\na week before I realized they had reached this conclusion only because\r\nthey hadn’t gone beyond Papua’s freakish little dry belt, where the\r\nAnkylostoma cannot thrive. I found the villages in the moist area alive\r\nwith hookworm.\r\n\r\nAfter our short tour was finished, we were to push into the wild\r\ninterior. We had decided to give mass treatments where we could;\r\notherwise we must leave medicine and instructions with planters and\r\nmissionaries along the way. It was talk, talk, talk these first few\r\ndays, and I was like a wild horse, rarin’ to go. I got plenty of going\r\nbefore my seven months were up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of madness in this little hot-spot of\r\nsemi-civilization where Queenslanders had come to build up another\r\nAustralia. The superintendent of the hospital, Dr. Mathews--(“Dr.\r\nMathews, one _t_ in the name, please”) halted operations to quote a\r\nBiblical passage proving, to him, that the world would end in 1925. He\r\nhad worked it out mathematically; exactly 144,000 souls would be spared\r\nfrom fire by a race-conscious Creator. These would be mostly Papuans,\r\nwho would rise and inherit the earth from England. He hated England.\r\nHis prophecy of destruction, he told me, had come to him when a boy of\r\nfifteen, in the midst of a football scrimmage.\r\n\r\nPort Moresby, during the war scare of 1914, earnestly believed that\r\nGerman New Guinea might at any minute cross the border to burn and\r\nloot. At the Papuan Club they could laugh it off after the third\r\nwhisky-soda. They told about native sentries posted around town,\r\ninstructed to shoot at sight. One gray dawn a sentry spied an\r\nexcessively smelly scavenger’s wagon rolling up, and took it for\r\nthe enemy. The password was “_Vailala_.” The guard leveled his rifle\r\nnervously and said, “You no talkim _Vailala_ me shoot.” The baffled\r\nMotu driver replied, “Me no sabe _Vailala_. This no shoot-cart. This\r\nshit-cart,”--and rolled away into the mist.\r\n\r\nThe Motu is a tamed and pleasant savage who only murders when it is\r\nconscientiously necessary. In the Port he is quite a city fellow,\r\nwearing his great bush of hair with style, but not aggressively. His\r\nkind brown eyes hold no reproach for the white folks who set him to\r\nminor household drudgeries. He is inclined to be timid; but in Papua\r\nyou mustn’t put too much faith in kind brown eyes. Even the butcherous\r\nKoiaris and the cannibal Goaribaris can look at you with winning\r\ngentleness when you visit their villages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nViewed from all angles,--geographical, political, medical,--our\r\nsituation was not easy.\r\n\r\nHere were three thousand miles of coast, with mountains massed so near\r\nthat roads by the sea were impossible; the nineteen-mile road that ran\r\nfrom Port Moresby to Sapphire Creek was the only one that wasn’t a goat\r\npath or a postman’s trail. The Governor’s yacht was out of my reach,\r\nand we hired or borrowed the canoes that took us up rivers; therefore,\r\nfor transportation we were largely at the mercy of recruiters and\r\nplanters.\r\n\r\nWe were only there on sufferance, for the Australian Government which\r\nran the Territory chose to snub local authority. The depression of\r\n1920 had set the planters yammering for subsidies to help a Territory\r\nwhich, for the tropics, is strangely unfertile. Governor Murray was at\r\nhis wits’ end to carry on his pinch-penny policy with the aid of ships’\r\nengineers and stewards whom he had made into roughly able magistrates\r\nand district officers.\r\n\r\nThe whole medical service was pared down to an excellent Chief Medical\r\nOfficer with nothing to work with, a Judgment Day prophet in charge\r\nof the local hospital, and one physician for each of three far-flung\r\ndistricts. These five, with a couple of nurses and two European\r\ndispensers, were supposed to service the 90,000-odd square miles. The\r\nofficer at Samarai was efficiently modern; the other three were elderly\r\nhacks. This was typical of the general medical situation over the South\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder how we ever got our units organized. At last we\r\nimported two extra inspectors from Australia and scattered like scalded\r\ndogs from a steaming kettle. In my weeks of preparation, I found that\r\nI had the Papuan Club behind me. That meant support from the ablest\r\ncolonials in the South Pacific: Loudon, Bertie, Sefton, Jewel, Tom\r\nNesbitt and a dozen more. I couldn’t have moved a finger without the\r\nhelp of these men and their friends. These were the forward-looking\r\nones who wanted native labor restored to health, to revitalize races\r\nfor whom, at that time, there seemed no future but extinction.\r\n\r\nAt the Papuan Club I couldn’t open my mouth for any fly-blown anecdote\r\nwithout there being wild laughter and shouts of “More! More!” A new\r\nman would come in. “Harrigan, have you heard the Doc’s latest? Doc,\r\ntell it again.” I was rather puffed up until I found out what they were\r\nlaughing at: it was my funny Yankee accent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWHERE THE DEAD MEN TALK\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly a day by motor lorry from the galvanized iron of Port Moresby, and\r\nuntamed Papua was pressing around us--a brute that could throw sudden\r\ntremendous cliffs into tangled drylands that were flat as your hand,\r\na country where the souls of men seemed forever broken between gross\r\nmaterialism and fantastic belief in ghosts and magic. Perhaps the black\r\nman’s mystic spirit imparted to his white conqueror a shuddering faith\r\nin the walking dead.\r\n\r\nPapua isn’t rich in the things that man needs. Either it is parched\r\nwith drought or reeking with wetness that produces giant weedy growths\r\nwith no nourishment in them. A hemp plantation, big as a Texas ranch,\r\nwas one of a certain development company’s failures; almost every\r\nenterprise in Papua seemed to be on the downgrade. Over yonder, a\r\nclosed and battered factory revealed the company’s vain attempt to\r\nmanufacture a trade tobacco that would be foul enough to suit the\r\nnative taste.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in the Pacific trade tobacco is native coin and currency. A\r\nfew sticks of it will buy a man’s labor for the week, a woman’s virtue\r\nfor the night. Government regulations have set a standard ration: two\r\nsticks a week. But the natives will accept only the stinking twist that\r\ntraders import from Virginia. The development company had a bright\r\nidea: they would make a trade tobacco of their own and corner the\r\nbusiness. They spent £50,000 trying to reproduce that exquisite dung\r\nflavor. The black boys put it in their pipes, but couldn’t be fooled.\r\n“Me want tabac!” they yelled. So the company imported an expert from\r\nVirginia. That didn’t work either. Maybe the local tobacco was a grade\r\ntoo good. The factory shut down and more shillings dropped out of the\r\npockets of hopeful stockholders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn one trip to these regions I went with Inspector Chris Kendrick, a\r\nplanter named Sefton, and Archie McAlpin, who was chief inspector for\r\nthe big development. There was also my “boy,” Ahuia.\r\n\r\nIn Port Moresby I had designed a uniform for my native interpreters. It\r\nwas a jumper and skirt in gaudy blue edged with bright yellow braid,\r\nand on the breast was a large yellow =H=. The =H=, of course,\r\nstood for HOOKWORM; but it made boys throw out their chests and strut\r\nas if it meant HARVARD at least.\r\n\r\nDown there they call every male native a “boy”; Ahuia was my chief boy.\r\nSplendid in his new uniform, he had the look of a Malay pirate coming\r\nover the side with a big knife in his teeth. He wore more hair than\r\nI had ever seen on anything, living or dead. On special occasions he\r\nloved to decorate it with lilies. To the natives he was an oppressor,\r\nto me a tender guardian. He could wash clothes, hookworm specimens,\r\ncamp dishes. He could cook and sew. He could put the fear of devils\r\ninto the gang of carriers who bore our equipment. He spoke Motu\r\nfluently when he interpreted. Motu is the _lingua franca_ along the dry\r\nbelt. In remoter villages they didn’t understand Motu. But in every\r\nsettlement under government control Ahuia would engage the services\r\nof the village constable, usually a murderer who had graduated with\r\nhonors from Port Moresby jail. Jail was the native’s university, where\r\nhe could learn more in three years than the home folks could teach him\r\nin a lifetime. The authorities always had a job waiting for a good\r\njailbird. Ahuia, who was a great traveler, knew that any constable with\r\na Port Moresby jail degree could speak Motu. A handy boy was Ahuia,\r\nand, like most natives, as afraid of ghosts and magic as a rabbit of a\r\nhound-dog.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the big hemp plantation, field hands thronged around our lorry to\r\nhelp us with our load--queer fellows with sloping foreheads crowned\r\nwith tight Negro wool. Long beaked noses gave them an ironic look; they\r\nhad the appealing eyes of beaten hunting dogs, and were not healthy\r\nmen. Some of them showed the dreadful ulcers of that false syphilis we\r\ncall “yaws.” Others were too pallid for brown men--hookworm infection\r\nand malaria.\r\n\r\n“What name dis fellow?” I asked Ahuia.\r\n\r\n“Him Goaribari.” Ahuia spat contemptuously.\r\n\r\nGoaribaris! I had heard bloodcurdling stories of these savages. It\r\nmust have been a long haul for them--seven hundred miles or so from\r\nthe Delta country which they terrorized. Here they labored along with\r\ndowncast eyes, or looked up almost fawningly.\r\n\r\nThe plantation manager arrived and invited me to his comfortable,\r\nbalconied house. These planters have the generous hearts of all good\r\nAustralians. “And it’s a God’s blessing that you Yankees are jogging\r\nthe Government up a bit. Half a million natives, maybe, and not half of\r\n’em fit to lift a bloody hand.” When I asked about the Goaribaris who\r\nhad so sedately helped us with our gear, the manager said: “Cannibals?\r\nWell, just a bit. When they’re home they’ll eat anything, from maggots\r\nto raw eels.”\r\n\r\nI inquired into hygienic conditions. He said, “When the recruiters\r\nbring these boys in they’re lousy with the diseases they’ve caught in\r\ntheir blighted villages. The ones you saw are newcomers. Six months on\r\na good plantation and they’ll pick up.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me studiously. “The plantation’s a bit seedy now, but we\r\nhave two sanitary features we’re proud of.”\r\n\r\nBack of the cabins he led me into one of those latrines designed by\r\nDr. Strong, the Papuan Chief Medical Officer, who strove so well for\r\nthe people and never got a breath of credit. It was built with a rough\r\nwooden rail and the pit was some twenty-five feet deep. Darkness below\r\nwas unattractive to the dysentery-carrying fly, the sides too steep and\r\nhigh for the hookworm larvae to climb.\r\n\r\nThat was admirable, I said. And what was the second sanitary\r\nimprovement in which he took so much pride?\r\n\r\nBeyond the hemp fields untidy black women loafed in the shade,\r\nrevealing their baggy breasts; they were spitting bloody streams of\r\nbetel-juice or smoking short clay pipes. “We have fourteen now,” the\r\nplanter said. “We’ve sent some away--gonorrhea, you know. Bring a few\r\nmore in this week. Yes, they have the ration of trade tobacco, rice and\r\ntinned food. They’re all married, so it’s just a matter of seeing the\r\nhusband.”\r\n\r\nAdmirable. But what had that to do with sanitation?\r\n\r\nThe manager held me with clean gray eyes, and said: “Do you know what\r\nhappens to men without women? These natives are only animals. You’ve\r\nseen how animals behave, when they can’t get what they want naturally?\r\nIndenturing men, taking them in herds away from the wives and the\r\nwhores, teaches them a lot of tomfoolery. Europeans don’t think that\r\nthe primitive man goes homosexual. Humbug! The missionaries think the\r\nsavages will live like Christ, and they’ve made it illegal to have\r\nprostitutes on plantations. Well, these ladies here are just good\r\nhard-working wives. Ask any of the big planters--and they’re he-men if\r\never there were any--ask ’em about the native boys that weave their\r\nhips and ogle at the work-gangs going by. We call ’em ‘queens,’ and\r\nthey’re a nuisance we’ve jolly well got to get rid of.”\r\n\r\nThe planter’s idea was brutal, like Papua. But his object was kindly,\r\nand, in its way, scientific. Since then I have seen much of the\r\nturning of simple people to the ways of perversion. The hard-hitting\r\nQueenslander, manly as a frontiersman can be, was doing his best to\r\nsquare the vicious circle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night I saw my first ghost. We had sat up rather late with the\r\nmanager, who mumbled in a corner with Archie McAlpin. Once I heard\r\nhim ask, “Is it still around?” Heads were together, voices lowered.\r\nFinally Archie McAlpin, who had finished his share of whisky, and mine,\r\nrambled upstairs. I rambled up too, for I was tired. That evening\r\nthere had been a long lecture before an audience of sedate cannibals,\r\nearnestly attentive to what I told Ahuia to say in Motu to a Goaribari\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\nThe Papuan servant never wakes you harshly, because when you sleep your\r\nsoul has left your body to wander among dreams. Wake the body suddenly,\r\nand where is the soul? Still loitering with a dream. Therefore you\r\ndie. When Ahuia wished to rouse me he would move a chair or give a\r\npolite cough. His cough woke me and I saw him, shadowy in a patch of\r\nmoonlight. His jittery voice was imploring the _taubada_ to “Look along\r\nveranda.... Devil-devil belong him outside.”\r\n\r\nA voice was yammering somewhere. I looked out and saw a white figure\r\nthat appeared to float as it gestured. I hadn’t many hairs to stand\r\nup, but they all stood. Yammering, yammering, the voice of the pale\r\napparition beat out a long speech in Motu, then in English. “_No, don’t\r\ncome here again!_”\r\n\r\nThe specter turned. It was Archie McAlpin. The voice hadn’t been that\r\nof a drunken man; under the white moon his look was sober. He shook his\r\nhead, the debate was over. He didn’t see me, he appeared not to see\r\nanything as he went back to bed.\r\n\r\n“Ahuia, what was he seeing?” I whispered, because the natives know\r\nso much of devils. Dark eyes were expressionless in the white night.\r\n“Maybe he see nothing, Taubada,” he whispered.\r\n\r\nIn three days I finished dosing two hundred Goaribaris. I had found\r\nthat newcomers bore the heaviest load of worms, reversing a prevalent\r\nmedical theory that plantations were infected and villages clean. Labor\r\nwas bringing disease from the towns to the farms.\r\n\r\nThe plantation that was sanitated by prostitutes and model latrines,\r\nworked by tame cannibals and haunted by invisible things, disappeared\r\nin a dust cloud as our lorry rumbled away toward the unbelievable\r\ncliffs of Hombrom Bluff. When I spoke of ghosts to Archie McAlpin he\r\nturned his steel-gray eyes the other way.\r\n\r\nWe slept at the little inn at Sapphire Creek, where the specters wailed\r\nagain, if only in the imagination of the English landlady whom I\r\ntreated for a slight attack of alcoholism. Poor woman, she had raised\r\ntwo husbands and fourteen children, and had been a rough Florence\r\nNightingale to the sick miners in the last flu epidemic. She stared\r\nup from her pillow and said, “No, Doctor, I’m not seeing things--only\r\nwhat’s all around us, all the time. Strange things happen in Papua.”\r\nShe closed her eyes to shut them away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHombrom Bluff hangs over the seared scrub of flatlands below. All\r\nPapua is like that, a vast bear-rug, shaggy and tumbled in a hundred\r\nfolds; man is the louse that must crawl up and down, down and up, to\r\ncross these endless entanglements. Craning my neck to look up Hombrom’s\r\nforehead I saw the change in vegetation from strangling tropic vines\r\nat the base to temperate evergreens that shagged its top. Blinking at\r\nthree thousand feet of it, I said to Archie McAlpin, “How do we get\r\naround to the Sogari District?”\r\n\r\nArchie said, “We don’t get around. We go over.”\r\n\r\nThey brought us horses and I mounted clumsily, being thirty pounds too\r\nheavy for the little shaggy animal. Then it was up, four breakneck\r\nmiles of cliffside trail that was seldom more than a yard wide. It\r\nwould have been a hard scramble for a man, but my Papuan horse must\r\nhave been bred of a goat. On the one side we were elbowed by monstrous\r\nvines; on the other side loosened pebbles flew into empty air. At one\r\nhigh twist the forests were sliding down to Port Moresby harbor, where\r\nthe reefs were fine spun lace, tattered over the expanse of lapis\r\nlazuli sea. Another turn and one of the world’s great waterfalls,\r\nRona, joined diamond necklace to diamond necklace as it met the wild\r\nLaloki River, slicing through savage green.\r\n\r\nNow at the top we dismounted on a narrow ridge. “What’s that lake over\r\nthere?” I asked Archie McAlpin. The lake was a Venus’ mirror, framed\r\nin the lips of a dead volcano. Archie’s eyes were still as the lake;\r\nhe stood silent at the marge of a cliff. Then I heard it again, heard\r\nthe queer babble in Motu. I turned and saw that it was Archie, speaking\r\nto the sky. I whispered to Sefton, “Is he a bit off his head?” Sefton\r\nanswered gravely: “No. But that lake over there is where dead men go.\r\nArchie’s saying the invocation. It keeps ghosts from following us. You\r\ncan’t get a native to go within a mile of that lake. They know what’s\r\ngood for them.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the lake had put its curse on me too; maybe it didn’t like to\r\nbe photographed. When I was remounting my horse the saddle slipped and\r\nleft me dangling in midair. Two hundred and thirty-odd pounds of me\r\nhung by a creaking stirrup. Quick-thinking Chris Kendrick caught me in\r\ntime and shoved me back into the saddle. What I liked best about Chris\r\nwas his way with an emergency.\r\n\r\nFar away across a vertigo of green depths Mt. Victoria, a tall landmark\r\nin New Guinea, was in a misty shroud. On this silent trail the sudden\r\nflutter of a bird’s wing sounded like a shot.\r\n\r\n“The mountain’s like a ghost,” I said to Archie McAlpin.\r\n\r\nThe trail had widened, we could ride closer together. “Along here I\r\nlike it best in daylight,” he said. I asked him if he was afraid of\r\nKoiaris--for they were the killers with long spears. No, he wasn’t\r\nafraid of Koiaris. Their country was farther on.\r\n\r\nSefton stared into the pale mountain light. “There’s a trail that leads\r\ndown from Jawavere where the Koiaris wait for anything that comes\r\nalong. You don’t linger on the Jawavere trail.\r\n\r\n“I have a station on the trail,” he said, “and always look for anybody\r\npassing to have a drink with me. It’s a bit lonesome. About four one\r\nafternoon, a native runs in and says he saw a _taubada_ (white man) who\r\nhad been riding along there, taking his time, just staring ahead. His\r\nhorse didn’t make any noise, the bush didn’t flutter. I thought that\r\nwas a lot of native humbug, and was annoyed that the man didn’t drop in\r\nfor a drink. I asked around among the other plantations. Yes, they’d\r\nall seen the rider, and at about four o’clock the same afternoon--in\r\nplaces miles apart. Finally we searched the bush and found the bones\r\nof a man and a horse, around some smoky stones. The Koiaris had done\r\nhim in, weeks before we saw him riding.”\r\n\r\nArchie said thoughtfully, “Yes, and there was the woman dressed in\r\nwhite. I couldn’t sleep one night, and there she was in the garden,\r\nbending over picking flowers. I spoke to her, but she didn’t look up.\r\nShe was the Englishwoman who married that chap from Cairns. She made\r\na little English garden, but it never suited her. Always wanted to go\r\nhome; you know how the English are. Her man thought Papua was good\r\nenough for her, until she died. Then he shot himself.”\r\n\r\n“Do you ever see his ghost?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No. He’s too deep in hell, I fancy, to get out.”\r\n\r\nThey believed earnestly in the horseman who rode over the bluff. They\r\nbelieved that lights appeared in the deserted house from which another\r\nwoman had run away with her baby.\r\n\r\nWe were riding along silently when our horses stopped, snorted and\r\nsat on their tails. At first I thought it was a fallen vine, then I\r\nsaw it wiggle. I slid off and threw a handy stone at eight black feet\r\nof snake; which was a diplomatic blunder, for the thing made straight\r\nat me. Sefton broke its back with a whip. “Venomous?” I asked. I hate\r\nsnakes. “Rather,” Sefton said, and poked the poison sacks.\r\n\r\nWe rode on. Ghosts were real, snakes only a nuisance in a country where\r\nanything could happen. Except mules. According to the planters there\r\nwas just one mule in Papua; and his long ears waved over a fence at\r\nthe Seventh Day Adventist Mission. Natives marveled and fed him votive\r\nyams; because he was a member of God’s house, locally presided over by\r\na missionary they called “Smiling Charley.”\r\n\r\nThe first time his celebrated animal strayed away, Charley organized\r\nhis black men to search for it. They hunted until they were tired out.\r\nSmiling Charley went on over the brow of the next hill, and there\r\nwas the mule. Charley thought this was an opportunity to demonstrate\r\nthe power of prayer, so he went back and said, “Boys, let’s pray for\r\nguidance.” They prayed, and in a few minutes overtook the mule. A week\r\nor two later it strayed again, much to the chagrin of the boys who had\r\nto do all the carrying when it wasn’t there. Smiling Charley tried to\r\norganize another search, but the boys were unwilling. He questioned\r\nthem and they said, “More better you pray first time, Taubada.” So\r\nCharley had to pray, but it didn’t work so well, for it was a week\r\nbefore the mule came home.\r\n\r\nDusk was falling when we left Smiling Charley’s Seventh Day joyfulness.\r\nAfter shadows began blackening the hills, Archie McAlpin said, “We’re\r\nin the Koiari country now, and we’d better push along. On the slope\r\nthere, you can see the graveyard.” Stones were like skulls among the\r\nscrub. “Those are planters that the jungle got the best of.” Everybody\r\nwho’s been a week in Papua knows how the jungle defeats all but the\r\nstrongest--malaria, accidents, bites and infections, all take their\r\ntoll of the pioneering white.\r\n\r\nA mountain chill blew from the pale stones. A tall horseman came toward\r\nus, and I tried to forget the mounted ghost. But Archie McAlpin sang\r\nout, “Hello, Sam!” The horseman stopped. Archie said, “Seems to me,\r\nSam, that you’re not giving this graveyard a very wide berth.” “Me?\r\nArchie, I never see ghosts.”\r\n\r\n“Then I suppose, Sam, you wouldn’t mind sleeping among the graves?”\r\n\r\n“I may be crazy,” Sam said, “but I’m not a bloody fool. If I see any\r\nghosts there’ll be one more horseman riding over the Bluff. He won’t be\r\nback, either.”\r\n\r\nHe galloped on. No, people don’t loiter on the Jawavere trail. I was\r\nstill thinking of the lonely Englishwoman who couldn’t go home; her\r\npoor shadow was earth-bound to Papua.\r\n\r\nHow about the ghosts of indentured natives, confused spirits that can\r\nnever find their way back to the villages they loved because they were\r\nborn there? Here’s a scrap from my diary, written from a survey which I\r\nmade a little later:--\r\n\r\n On Saturday P.M. gave lecture to natives. Back of the boys’ houses\r\n found evidences of gross soil pollution ... natives must be educated\r\n to some idea of sanitation.... Seem well fed and contented, save for\r\n a lot from the Dutch border, some of whom have died for no apparent\r\n cause, other than homesickness....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHEY WALK ALONG DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn those first short trips our main effort was to count and report the\r\ndiseased. I often had a deep sense of personal guilt when I left the\r\nvillages just as I had found them, crying out for the healing I had no\r\ntime to give. All I could do was lecture them, hand out the tins and\r\ngather them up for tests in the next place I stopped. Sometimes the\r\ncontainers were returned in fifteen minutes--such is the celerity of\r\nthe savage gut. Faces would be wreathed in smiles. They had filled the\r\nmagic boxes, just as I had ordered, had they not? To them that was all\r\nthat was needed for the cure; fill the magic boxes, hand them over to\r\nthe white medicine man who would say an incantation--and lo! sickness\r\nwould vanish from the tribe.\r\n\r\nThis was a sort of Heathen Science point of view which would have been\r\nfunny, had it not been so tragic. I got used to it, and left the people\r\nwith a smile as cheery as their own. After all, the drug would be\r\ncoming soon, and I had told the missionary or planter how to administer\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen we had sufficient oil of chenopodium we did not waste an overnight\r\nstop in making diagnoses; in this district wherever there were villages\r\nthe infection was obviously so heavy that we could call it 100 per\r\ncent. Therefore we lined them up and dosed every man, woman and child.\r\nWith great gusto they swallowed down the nasty oil, in a spoonful of\r\nsugar, and smacked their lips. They laughed over the bitter purge that\r\nfollowed. More than once they lingered to steal the leavings of Epsom\r\nsalts solution, on the principle that the more you take the sooner\r\nyou get well. Only the children held back. I won’t forget the naked\r\nfour-year-old who knew enough missionary English to yell, “Oh, Jesus,\r\nno!” when his elders dragged him forward.\r\n\r\nMany of these first trips took us no farther from Port Moresby’s tinny\r\norderliness than it would be from New York’s city hall to Trenton. Yet\r\nwith every mile we found some curious or savage twist to the human\r\nanimal’s makeup. There was always the white man, standing one against\r\nfive hundred natives, in an urge to develop a resisting wilderness.\r\nKeep the tribes alive for another day’s work, that was the problem. My\r\nearly expeditions were all zigzags. There was a plunge into the sawmill\r\ncountry along the Laloki River to inspect a mining company’s Kiwais,\r\nbig jolly fellows like Virginia Negroes; I stayed there long enough to\r\nadvise the operators on the use of their lumber for pit latrines. I\r\nwon’t forget the cleanest native village I ever saw. The Company had\r\nsurrounded it with a stockade fence and commanded the people to sweep\r\nthe streets and throw their rubbish away. I had only one fault to find:\r\nthe dark villagers polluted the trash-heaps they piled on the other\r\nside. These people should have been crawling with hookworms. Actually,\r\nthe infection was extremely light. Another medical paradox....\r\n\r\nI sometimes came upon pathological freaks. There was the paralytic at\r\nKabadi plantation, who seemed to have lost muscular control of one\r\nside at a time; when he turned he grimaced horribly with the conscious\r\neffort. His walk was like pushing forward two sticks of wood. I\r\nwondered why they kept such a monster, then they told me. Oh, he was\r\nvery useful. The Koiaris were so afraid of him they didn’t dare raid\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nIn the black belt of the South Pacific dreams are very real things.\r\nWhen you sleep your soul goes walking into living adventures. If you\r\nlove a girl in sleep, then she is no longer a maiden when you meet\r\nher in the morning. A nightmare murder is no mere fancy; you have\r\nkilled your enemy dead as dead. When you happen to meet him tomorrow\r\nsauntering down the glen, that is nothing. What you are seeing is\r\nmerely a fancy. Your dream has killed the man you hate. And take\r\ncare how you treat that frightful paralytic who leers at you in the\r\nhemp-fields. He may “walk along your dreams.”\r\n\r\nToo many things I saw walked along my dreams. There was that pageant at\r\nBoera....\r\n\r\nBoera was a dismal beach and supported a London Missionary Society\r\nstation, presided over by two Samoans. Samoa was a far cry from that\r\nlost spit of sand. Alien to the soil, these imported teachers grow to\r\nbe like many white missionaries, muddling along with Christ’s work.\r\nTheir impulses are as fine as their results are vague in a dingy\r\nroutine of bell-ringing, prayer-saying, Sunday school reading and more\r\nbell-ringing. This pair, Mosea and Emma, were meekly discouraged, but\r\nwith the beautiful manners of the Polynesian aristocrat. Mosea was\r\nalready heavy-legged with elephantiasis. His cousin Samueli dropped\r\nin to report with Christian cheerfulness that conditions were “very\r\nbad.”... Queer how they travel. Years later this same Samueli came to\r\nme on an Ellice Island beach far away from Papua, and made me a present\r\nof a fresh-killed chicken. When I asked him how conditions were, he\r\nsaid, “Very bad.”\r\n\r\nAt Boera I got my first real look at a yaws-stricken community. This\r\nhideous thing was apparent on the bodies and faces of at least a third\r\nof the people, men and women with noses reduced to yawning holes in the\r\nmiddle of a flat scar. Fingers and toes curled like withering twigs.\r\nSwarms of flies carried the filth-born germ. I looked into baby faces\r\nand saw how the process of healing had drawn their lips together into a\r\nfeatureless surface with an opening so small that you could hardly get\r\na lead-pencil through.\r\n\r\nYes, these Papuan specters walk along your dreams. The tropics are\r\ndreamlands, released from the balance of Northern things. Life down\r\nthere moves between poetic loveliness and monstrous disgust. I have\r\nsince seen many other villages like Boera; and I should have become\r\ncallous, seeing so much of it. I could get used to the maimed adults,\r\nbut the children always wrung my heart.\r\n\r\nIt is quite understandable that the early voyagers should have confused\r\nyaws with syphilis. That such confusion still persists is reasonable.\r\nFor all we know of yaws, it may be syphilis modified by Stone Age\r\nconditions. We call it _framboesia tropica_ (tropical raspberry). When\r\nyou speak of yaws you must always speak of syphilis--the two are so\r\nalike, with wide differences.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cook, who first visited the Pacific in 1773, wisely wrote:\r\n“Another disease of more mischievous consequences, which is also very\r\nfrequent, and appears on every part of the body, in large broad ulcers,\r\ndischarging a thin, clear pus ... it being certainly known and even\r\nacknowledged by themselves that the natives are subject to this disease\r\nbefore they were visited by the English, it cannot be the result of\r\nvenereal contagion, notwithstanding the similarity of the symptoms....”\r\n\r\nHere at least is illness you can’t blame on the whites.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened traders and missionaries who followed Cook sketchily\r\njotted down “syphilis.” All my work in Papua and my following years\r\nof careful research over the whole Pacific failed to find one case\r\nof syphilis, although I have run across one or two rather doubtful\r\ndiagnoses. I have never found the tell-tale chancre scar, which is the\r\nsure mark. The manifestations of the two diseases run so parallel that\r\ncarelessness or ignorance have put a libel on the native races.[1]\r\n\r\nYaws is not a venereal disease, nor is it hereditary. It is usually\r\nacquired in early childhood. Native mothers expose their babies to it\r\nin hopes of “getting it out of their systems,” much as some Yankee\r\nmothers do when measles come around.\r\n\r\nNow here’s the confusing resemblance. The yaws germ _Treponema\r\npertenue_ is so closely related to the syphilis germ _Treponema\r\npallidum_ that the two are hard to tell apart. Both diseases progress\r\nin three of four stages. The “mother yaw” first appears on any part\r\nof the body, and its secondary manifestation is a great number of\r\n“daughter yaws” which are widely distributed over the skin and progress\r\ninto the third stage, which is remarkably syphilitic in appearance.\r\nArterial changes and nerve lesions (as in syphilis) sometimes cause the\r\ngeneral paralysis of the insane.\r\n\r\nMissionaries have an easy way of accounting for yaws: it’s a curse\r\ninherited from cannibal ancestors. Certainly it is ugly enough to have\r\ncome to the world through that black door.\r\n\r\nAnd here’s another parallel. The treatment for yaws is exactly the same\r\nas the treatment for syphilis--arsenical injections. Framboesia was\r\nquite beyond the reach of medicine until Professor Ehrlich produced his\r\nsalvarsan. There is nothing more dramatic in medicine than the almost\r\nvisible growth of healthy tissue over a yaws sore after an arsenical\r\ninjection.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific is the one place in the world where yaws is in no way\r\ncomplicated by syphilis. I am told that in Tahiti the two diseases\r\nthrive, but the same person never has both. On the Islands there\r\nseems to be a cross-immunity, so that the two germs cannot prosper in\r\nthe same host. Certainly the native has been abundantly exposed to\r\nsyphilis; East Indian labor, when it came to Fiji, brought with it 75\r\nper cent infection. The Chinese and the white sailors fetched their\r\nshare and did their amatory best to spread it, but nothing happened.\r\nSomething had made the native immune, and that something is quite\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe stamping out of yaws is largely a matter of intensive campaigning.\r\nBut what will happen when the fight is won? Will syphilis slip in to\r\ntake the place of the spirochete it could never meet--on equal terms?\r\nThat is another doctor’s dilemma.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe morning after we heard the planters’ ghost stories I sent Kendrick\r\nto ride ahead for preliminary inspection of the rubber plantations. On\r\na rough sea or a jungle trail, Chris was at home. I made short surveys\r\nalong the trail, resting my raw posterior when I could. Then horseback\r\nagain, clenching my teeth at every bump on the saddle-sores. Imagine a\r\nConey Island roller coaster magnified a hundred times, and you have our\r\nslide and scramble, up and down, down and up, to attain an elevation of\r\n3,000 feet. Down, down would go the coaster on a grade so steep that a\r\nfly, if he tried it, would fall over on his nose; and I marveled again\r\nat the adhesive footing of my horse. On the final upgrade I spared my\r\nbuttocks and skinned my heels, for even the horse surrendered.\r\n\r\nNow the rubber trees were all around, above and below me, their coarse,\r\nhard leaves like green glass that blinded the eyes in afternoon sun.\r\nUnderneath was a grotto of soft light, upheld by pale trunks like\r\npillars of snakeskin. Naked men worked in silent preoccupation, sharp\r\nknives making incisions in the bark; neatly they would rip down\r\npaper-thin slices, and the tree’s milk-white blood would trickle\r\ninto cups. Watching, I was thinking: they are natural surgeons. Down\r\nthe ages they have learned so much, dissecting human flesh with the\r\nrazor-edges of split bamboo. Train men like these to use the knife\r\nto save instead of kill, and what couldn’t they accomplish for their\r\npeople?...\r\n\r\nThe man nearest to me turned. His wooly hair, his sloping brow, his\r\nlong, hooked nose told me that he was a Goaribari. I looked at his\r\ncompanions. All Goaribaris, with that undeniably Hebrew profile\r\nwhich gave them the name “the Lost Tribes of Israel.” But these were\r\ndifferent from the scrawny cannibals I had seen on the hemp plantation.\r\nThey were fatter, better-muscled, and their brown skins were beginning\r\nto show silk. They were not newcomers, and the planters had taken care\r\nof them. Back home, where they pursued the jolly business of going\r\nto war and dining on the enemy, they hadn’t eaten very regularly. On\r\nthe farms the white man had fed them, and done his best to teach them\r\nsanitary ways; an uphill job among primitives who were naïve as cattle\r\nin their bodily functions. In subsequent surveys all over the Territory\r\nI could tell, almost at a sweep of the eye, the men who had been on\r\nplantations. They were the upstanding, healthy specimens.\r\n\r\nRubber plantations have a smell of their own, something like the aroma\r\nof fried overshoes. It drifts from the factory where the sap is being\r\nsmoked and reduced to the wide, dirty-gray ribbons that go forward to\r\nmarket. Here my cannibals worked like hiving bees, swarming in and out\r\nof the door on the commonplace business of supplying crude material for\r\nthe raincoat trade. I looked around and saw Chris Kendrick, smiling and\r\nself-assured, pushing his way through the throng.\r\n\r\n“You missed something yesterday afternoon,” Kendrick said. “The Koiaris\r\ncame down and staged a raid on the Goaribaris. A lot of workmen were\r\nloafing in a field, then a naked devil was in the midst of them, poking\r\naway with a long spear in either hand. There was just one of him, mind\r\nyou, and there must have been twenty Goaribaris. They may be tough\r\nbastards in their home towns, but here they were taking it like frozen\r\nlambs--till somebody ran in with a shovel and a hoe handle. Next you\r\nknew the Koiari was making for the woods, naked and howling, shaking\r\nhis long spears.\r\n\r\n“But the Goaribaris caught him and--what do you think?--turned him over\r\nto the management! What the hell did he care? He’d got his man.” Like\r\nso many of the fiercer tribes, Koiaris kill because murder is a proof\r\nof manhood, and a warrior who has not bloodied his spear is laughed at,\r\neven by the women.\r\n\r\n“I got a snapshot of the fellow he left behind,” Kendrick said, and\r\nshowed me the print he had developed. A broken body lay in the scrub.\r\nThe plantation manager came up just then and grinned, “We buried him\r\ndeep. His brother Goaribaris might take a notion to eat him, you know.\r\nOf course, they’re pretty well fed, but.... Yo-hum, farming’s so full\r\nof little problems like that!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYes, farming in Papua, even at its best, offered many problems never\r\ndreamed of in the philosophy of a Secretary of Agriculture. The old\r\nhands were far from hookworm-free, although vastly improved in general\r\nhealth. New recruits were coming in with fresh loads of parasites\r\nto be hatched from the filth they scattered in spite of managerial\r\nwatchfulness. Green laborers regarded the well-built privies as queer\r\ntraps set by the white man for their undoing ... pretty, but look out!\r\n\r\nThat night I lectured by the light of hurricane lanterns swung from the\r\nbeams of a great, empty warehouse. The audience sat cross-legged in a\r\nwide crescent, their oily faces gleaming up at us. The front row was\r\nsolid Goaribari with natives of gentler tribes behind. These, being\r\nmore nearly civilized, understood Motu, which was so much Greek to the\r\nDelta savages. Therefore it had been up to Ahuia to fetch the local\r\nconstable, a very ugly man in a G-string and a policeman’s cap.\r\n\r\nSuch occasions were Ahuia’s hour to shine. Out on the trail he went\r\nstripped to the waist, but at lectures the gaudy yellow =H= on his\r\nbright blue jumper stretched with every expansion of his chest. And he\r\nhadn’t forgotten to put lilies in his hair. He had set the stage with\r\nour regulation International Health Board chart, loosely bound pages\r\nwith simple illustrations of the hookworm’s course to the intestines;\r\nthere were drawings, greatly enlarged, of the male and female parasite\r\nand the egg their mutual love produced. There were big photographs of\r\na sick boy and a well boy--something like the patent-medicine man’s\r\n“Before and After Treatment.”\r\n\r\nAhuia quelled the Goaribaris with his pirate’s scowl, and in\r\nimpressive silence brought out our prize number, a large bottle of\r\nadult hookworms, pickled in alcohol. This was a stage property which\r\nwe carried for purposes of demonstration. Cannibal eyes popped as the\r\ncollection was passed from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nAhuia was getting his lesson by heart, but I still felt it safer to\r\nprompt him. “Tell them first,” I said, “that they must look carefully\r\nat what is in the bottle.” He spoke Motu, straight into the mouth of\r\nthe interpreter: “_Tatau bona, memero, umui iboumuiai inai gaigai ba\r\nitaia_....” The native constable was saying it after him, in the queer\r\nlingo of the Goaribaris: “Men and boys, all of you look at these little\r\nsnakes.”\r\n\r\nEducation strained through three languages. The row of man-eaters sat\r\nvery still; their long noses, pointed up, were like the muzzles of\r\nwistful hounds. Ahuia was telling them how the lady snake laid very bad\r\neggs that fell out of the black boy and the black “mary”; how the eggs\r\nhatched tiny baby snakes that nipped the black boy’s foot and crawled\r\nback into his belly. Now see the picture of the sick boy and the well\r\nboy--they are both the same boy. The well boy took the medicine the\r\n_taubada_ brings, and the snakes came out of his belly. Now he will\r\nkeep well, because he is a wise boy. He goes to the clean privy the\r\nwhite man built him, so that the snake cannot come out and crawl into\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\nPatiently drumming simple words into woolly heads, we tried to make\r\nsimple men understand cause, cure and prevention of a disease they\r\nmight have brought from Africa, ages ago; a disease so wasting that\r\nthe mills, rivers, the plantations were calling upon half-invalids to\r\nfurnish brawn for Europe’s driving ambition.\r\n\r\nSometimes in my early lectures as I looked over the stooped dark\r\nfigures I would have moments of weakening. I would wonder if it was\r\nworth while to save these curious beings, so out of touch with anything\r\nour Northern civilization knew.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, I came to realize how very much worth while it was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lecture was over and I started alone across an open swathe of dim\r\nmoonlight that pointed toward the plantation house. I was anxious to\r\nget to headquarters where I could write up my notebook and tumble into\r\nbed. On both sides of me rubber trees made high black walls, like\r\nsomething built of coal. My conscious mind was concerned only with the\r\nday’s work and tomorrow’s; somewhere in the back of my dreams I may\r\nhave sensed the danger of another such Koiari spear as had butchered a\r\nman yesterday.\r\n\r\nI looked up and saw the outline of three men, emerging out of the\r\nshadows. Even to my defective eyes they made a grotesque group, all\r\nlocked together in a shambling stride. There was nothing for me but\r\ntrust in the white man’s prestige. I was unarmed. If I had shouted for\r\nhelp it would have been a sign of fear, and these fellows, I knew,\r\nworked in a hurry. When they came closer I saw that they carried no\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nTwo of them, who had been holding to the third, began jabbering in\r\nGoaribari, making friendly sounds. Was this a trap? Fortunately Ahuia\r\nand the native constable came swinging up with hurricane lanterns--even\r\nin moonlight they carried lanterns to scare away ghosts. Ahuia pointed\r\nto the man in the middle. “That fellow broke his hand in a fight. There\r\nwere not enough women to go around.”\r\n\r\nAll right, let’s have a look at it. We led the foiled lover to my\r\nquarters where I examined the wrist and found a bad Colles’s fracture.\r\nIn dim lantern-light I did a careful job of bonesetting, even though\r\nthe fellow had just scared the living lights out of me. If he had shown\r\nup in the dispensary at Rochester with the pick of the faculty looking\r\non, he couldn’t have had more meticulous surgical attention. I even\r\ntook time to give him Doctor Moore’s famous dressing, which is fussy,\r\nbut perfect.\r\n\r\n“All right, boy,” I said, “run along.” He stood there patiently,\r\nholding out his unwounded hand. What the devil was he waiting for?\r\n“Does he want to thank me?” I asked Ahuia.\r\n\r\n“No, master.” Ahuia looked fiercely sad. “He is waiting for you to pay\r\nhim. That fashion belong this fellow.”\r\n\r\n“What fashion?” My short temper was getting shorter. “What should I pay\r\nhim for?”\r\n\r\n“For mending his sick hand, Taubada.”\r\n\r\nI growled and Ahuia shoved him out into the night. When I was around\r\nAhuia feared neither ghosts nor Goaribaris. The incident seemed to be\r\nclosed, but I was aware that the cubicle next to Kendrick’s, where I\r\nslept, was quite doorless and exposed to pale moonlight.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was aroused by softly arguing Motu voices. Ahuia and\r\nQuai, who was with Kendrick, had missed something from our bags. Quite\r\nlikely. For there was a gentleman’s agreement among Motuan servants:\r\nNever steal from your master--oh, that was very tabu. But you could\r\ntake a little something from your master’s host, or from some stranger\r\n_taubada_, sleeping near you, if he happened to leave his bags open.\r\nIt was honorable to snitch a handkerchief or a pair of new shorts and\r\ndrop the small loot into your bag. When two white men were bunking\r\nadjacently, their boys working with the bags would watch each other as\r\ncat watches mouse. It was all right for the good servant to get away\r\nwith a few of the stranger’s cigarettes, for personal smoking.\r\n\r\nThere were other guests on the plantation, and I was wondering whose\r\nboy had gotten by Ahuia’s watchfulness when a sleepy glance through the\r\nsunlit window awoke me to a real annoyance. There sat the Goaribari\r\nwith the bandaged hand, serenely chewing betel-nut. “For the love of\r\nGod, Ahuia, what does he want now?”\r\n\r\nAhuia’s funny English informed me, “Taubada, he still wishes to be\r\npaid. He has slept all night on the porch.”\r\n\r\nI jumped out of bed, dragging the mosquito netting with me. Like a\r\nfishwife in a bridal veil I exhausted all the arts of profanity. With\r\nan amiable smile on his betel-red mouth the cannibal listened--and held\r\nout his good hand. Then I checked myself in mid-oath and laughed as I\r\nhave never laughed before. This was socialized medicine with a reverse\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n“Ahuia,” I shouted, “give this cheeky bastard two sticks of trade\r\ntobacco.”\r\n\r\nQuite unemotionally the savage accepted his fee and departed.\r\n\r\nI was still laughing when the planter came in, and he grinned. “It’s\r\nthe fashion--that’s all a bush fellow will say. They’re pretty much\r\nconfused about money values. To them a white man’s a sort of cross\r\nbetween Simon Legree and Santa Claus; when he comes around it’s either\r\nto send ’em to jail or pay ’em off.”\r\n\r\nI grumbled: “Next thing they’ll expect me to pass around free tobacco\r\nbefore every hookworm lecture.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly they will,” he said. Then he rang the changes the planters\r\nhad rung all along the line. “Anything can happen in Papua.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nJUST THIS SIDE OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July I decided to lead my own expedition as far into the interior as\r\npossible and get a proper picture of infestation in districts remote\r\nfrom the influence of white traders and planters. I had worked like\r\na beaver along the coast, up rivers, into plantations, sea villages,\r\nhill villages. My inspectors were always away, leading surveys and\r\ncampaigns that spread out fanwise across the country. Communications\r\nwere crude. Canoes, whaleboats and jiggery launches plied their\r\nprecarious way among the infinite shoals, or lost themselves under lush\r\npalisades where an all-wise Creator saw fit to turn on the shower at\r\nthe slightest excuse.\r\n\r\nI moved ahead of my inspectors, surveyed the districts, turned them\r\nover to my men and passed on to the next. Although the Government was\r\ninclined to look on me as a secret agent of John D. Rockefeller, they\r\noffered me a sort of mild indulgence. Our main handicap was supplies,\r\nas the Foundation’s Dr. Sawyer, then my over-director, could not\r\nbelieve that such great quantities of drugs were necessary to treat\r\ninfected Papua. Where was all the stuff going? In Australia, where\r\ntreatments had been comparatively few, expenditures had been small.\r\nSawyer simply couldn’t grasp the immenseness of that sick population in\r\nthe Territory. Yet to treat them _en masse_ would have been the only\r\nanswer. At that time mass treatments had been tried among laborers in\r\nJava; but a wholesale curative campaign was unheard of.\r\n\r\nOur work had been so heavy that we had exhausted Central Office\r\nsupplies. Even in the following year there weren’t enough to go around.\r\nWe had to carry on with what we had.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn July 21 I was more than glad to be setting out for Yule Island, a\r\nsplotch of land some sixty miles from Port Moresby. This island is\r\nseparated by a thin gut of water from the prodigious jungle-covered\r\nmountains that stalk beyond Mafulu to the mysterious border some still\r\ncall “German New Guinea.” Again we were jogging along on the little\r\n_Morinda_, with Captain Teddy Hillman and his Gin Club in command. With\r\nme I had the two boys, Ahuia and Quai. We took with us a quantity of\r\n“gear,” which was our term for the variety of things we must carry with\r\nus into the field.\r\n\r\nA white man, bent on an excursion straight into the thick of Papua,\r\nrequires several swag bags--one for his bed, mattress and mosquito\r\nnetting; another for scientific equipment; a smaller bag to hold\r\nincidentals. The number of tucker boxes for food depends on the time\r\none spends in the field. There will be no chance to replace anything\r\nafter the start is made. These must be included: frying pan, teapot,\r\nbilly-cans, a tin opener, a lantern with kerosene, an ax and an\r\nassortment of tinned food. Absorbing topics around a Papuan campfire\r\nare the relative merits of different brands of tinned meats, and\r\ncunning ways to disguise the taste of tin.\r\n\r\nThe tins for hookworm specimens, packed by hundreds, were little\r\nhalf-ounce cylinders about the diameter of a silver dollar. The gear\r\nmade a load for many carriers, burdened too with their own food for the\r\nwhole trip. And don’t forget the trade tobacco that must be doled out\r\neverywhere as strike insurance. We were prepared for almost anything;\r\nthe going up to Mafulu would be hard.\r\n\r\nGetting carriers for these long pulls was always a part of Papua’s\r\nlabor problem. Ask a Motu boy to pack and follow you into the jungle\r\nand he’d begin to shuffle, roll his big eyes and move away. There\r\nwas _puri-puri_, bad magic, in those hills out there. It was not\r\n“our fashion” to go among the Mondo or the Kuni people. They have\r\nenchantments, you die under a spell. The same fear lay across every\r\ndistrict border; we had to change our carriers as we went along.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYule Island, flat and green as a dish of parsley, lay separated by a\r\nthread of salt water from the distant panorama of tumbled mountains\r\nthat climbed the wilds of Papua. It was an exotic and frightening\r\nbeauty over there, peak after peak, their height exaggerated by\r\ncloseness to shore. The tallest looked taller than Mt. Everest, and\r\nmore unattainable.\r\n\r\nThree white men waited for me on flat Yule Island beach. I recognized\r\ntwo of my inspectors, the Orr brothers, Jack and Ron. Their food supply\r\nhad been spoiled by surprise tumbles from canoes. They greeted me with\r\nunrestrained shouts of joy; they would eat again! The third greeter was\r\nMr. Connelly, the jolly, hard-boiled District Officer. When I mentioned\r\nthe giant mountains across the stream he said casually:--\r\n\r\n“They’re a bit of a climb. When you’ve finished with Yule Island I’ll\r\nshow you up, part of the way. Business and pleasure. I’ll have to push\r\nbeyond Mafulu--after a batch of murderers, you know. Come over to the\r\nhouse and we’ll have a spot of tea or something.”\r\n\r\nI was no sooner in Mr. Connelly’s house than I heard a strain of sweet,\r\nfamiliar music. An American accent! It was young Mrs. Connelly saying,\r\n“Pleased to meet you.” She was a native of New Jersey. How she came\r\nhere to be the wife of a man who scaled crags to round up murderers was\r\njust another in the grab-bag we call marriage. My own wife, after all,\r\nwas born in Mexico, educated in California--and was now waiting for me\r\nin a Port Moresby bungalow.\r\n\r\nConnelly knew the ropes, as needs must be when one man combines the\r\nduties of sheriff, judge advocate, postmaster, tax collector and\r\njustice of the peace in a country where the people are hard to count as\r\nwild pigs. After an evening of bridge he told me, casually, that he’d\r\nfix me up with the forty-seven carriers I needed. How? Just leave it to\r\nhim. “I’m Government, you know”--with a dry smile.\r\n\r\nDuring our week’s survey of Yule Island the Orr brothers and I were\r\nlodged in the patrol officer’s house, walls and floors of split bamboo,\r\nceiling of nipa palm thatch. The shower bath was two Standard Oil\r\ncans (“petrol tins” over there) hung one below the other. Can Number\r\n1 is filled with fresh water, and when you pull a string a plug comes\r\nout and empties it into Can Number 2, which has been drilled full of\r\nnail-holes to give a fountain effect. The first time you use this Rube\r\nGoldberg invention you soap yourself carefully under the spray--and the\r\nwater gives out. The next time you try soaping yourself in your own\r\nsweat, which can’t be done. The third try you just say “Oh, hell,” and\r\npull the string.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Mission of the Sacred Heart has a business name which I have\r\nremembered accurately: Company of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Ltd. Its\r\nholdings ran all the way from Yule Island to a point some 130 miles\r\ndistant across the channel, up into the wild mountain-heart of Papua,\r\nand its practical label was a key to its practical Christianity. The\r\nSacred Heart was, and still is, about the best mission establishment\r\nin the Pacific, and should serve as a model for the numerous jarring\r\nsects and creeds--Church of England, Calvinist, Wesleyan, Seventh Day\r\nAdventist, London Missionary Society and even Mormon--that confused the\r\nnative mind with conflicting roads to salvation.\r\n\r\nI grew to admire these curiously devoted Fathers, thirty-one in all,\r\nwho usually put aside their priestly robes for the frontiersman’s rough\r\nkhaki. Fierce beards relieved them entirely of the soft ecclesiastical\r\nlook. In little convents, strewn along the broken trails up to Mafulu\r\nand beyond, there were twenty-six nuns living the same rigorous life.\r\n\r\nThere was almost every European nationality in this French order:\r\nFrench, German, Swiss, Dutch, one Italian, one Spaniard. They were\r\nunderstaffed, hideously overworked; in faces around the luncheon table\r\nI could see the look of men who were not going to last much longer.\r\nThey were short-lived because they followed their incessant work\r\nwithout considering illness or the demands of a difficult climate. They\r\nall died in Papua. With them I visited two cases of typhoid which they\r\nsaid had been brought in from Port Moresby, despite their efforts to\r\nquarantine against the germ. I operated on one Father for a bad case of\r\nhydrocele, and on others for injuries and infections common to their\r\nhard life.\r\n\r\nThey had solved the food problem troubling the rest of Papua, which was\r\nstuffed with American and Australian canned goods. Here they had their\r\nown truck gardens, bountifully yielding, so that they could feed their\r\n120 pupils wholesomely and at minimum cost. There were nearly a hundred\r\nhalf-castes in this school. The Sacred Heart method of dealing with\r\nmixed blood was practical.\r\n\r\nThe half-caste too often comes into the world with no father willing\r\nto attend the baptism. Bishop Boismenu, a fighting priest, carried\r\nthis question to the Government; his persistence was responsible for\r\na law requiring the registration of every half-caste child’s white\r\nparent. And, my word, what a hullabaloo! Major Jones-Smith and Judge\r\nBrown-White had to do some tall explaining when sons or daughters\r\nsuddenly materialized at the Mission of the Sacred Heart. One high\r\nGovernment official had a hard time facing his wife and his public; one\r\nrich American decided that he had loitered too long and had pressing\r\nengagements back in the States.\r\n\r\nThe half-caste problem is increasing in Papua. When the Melanesian\r\nwas 100 per cent cannibal his women were chaste; the husband carried\r\nan ironwood club, and the tribe was never lax in enforcing blue laws.\r\nPoaching lovers were firmly lashed together with vines and laid across\r\nthe liveliest ant-heap in the neighborhood. Or experienced tormentors\r\nwould hobble the wandering bride permanently; they would just tie a hot\r\nstone under one of her knees. Nevada in the early days was almost as\r\nrough with domestic incontinence (if female). And look at Nevada today.\r\n\r\nIt was a strict mission rule that half-caste children should speak no\r\nlanguage but English. Britishers they were; the law had acknowledged\r\nthem. When they came of age the girls and boys were encouraged to marry\r\neach other, or to go into orders. They were to have a respectable place\r\nin society, and no handicaps.\r\n\r\nI take off my old white helmet to the men and women of the Sacred\r\nHeart. There was Sister Magdalena, aged seventy-six. I found her sweet\r\nold face bent over a busily clicking typewriter. She had been stone\r\nblind for two years. “It was hard at first,” she said, “learning the\r\ntouch system. But it’s like playing a musical instrument. I write\r\npoetry when I have time, and letters home. I’m useful too. One of the\r\ngirls dictates to me, and I keep accounts for the mission.”\r\n\r\nAnd there was Brother Heinrich, the jolly undertaker. Sallow and\r\nmalarial, he had the smile of the artist who loves his work and has\r\nplenty of orders. Papuan fevers never bothered him so long as he had\r\ncoffins to build. Bang, bang went his lusty hammer, doing a neat\r\nhardwood job. “Don’t forget a solid lid,” I said, coming up to him.\r\nBrother Heinrich chuckled and said, “I try not to forget anything. For\r\ninstance, Doctor, you’ll need lots of brass nails on those shoes, if\r\nyou’re going up to Mafulu. Won’t you send that pair to me before you\r\ngo? I’m a cobbler too.”\r\n\r\nMother Ligouri, who presided over the neat little hospital, was\r\nanother jolly one, round and rosy in spite of hell and high water.\r\nHer housekeeping was immaculate; she isolated typhoid cases, and was\r\nalways in comic despair over sanitary arrangements, primitive latrines,\r\nflies and mosquitoes that infected her patients. Brother Heinrich was\r\none of her favorite pests. “I have to shoo him away,” she said. “When\r\nanybody’s sick he gets the measurements somehow. I never knew him to\r\nfail to have a coffin ready, and a perfect fit. That man Heinrich!”\r\n\r\nThe day before we set out for the mountains I let Brother Heinrich\r\nhave my shoes, and asked him if he had me on his list of measurements.\r\n“Oh, I can tell your size from your shoes,” he said with a glow of\r\nprofessional pride. That night he presented me with a remarkably fine\r\njob of hobnailing.\r\n\r\nDuring the week I had talked to the half-castes, and it gave me\r\npleasure to lecture in English. Already I was looking forward to\r\nmy surveys in New Guinea Territory, where, I was told, the people\r\nunderstood pidgin English. I carelessly believed that pidgin would be\r\neasy to pick up. I little knew.\r\n\r\nAll I saw of that enterprise on Yule Island, and of its far-flung\r\nstations among the peaks and gorges of Mafulu, never failed to remind\r\nme of what Herman Melville, who didn’t like missionaries as a class,\r\nhad said of the South Sea Catholics a hundred years ago. They were to\r\nhim the great missioners. And they are the great missioners still, as\r\nlong as they live in the purity of self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAhuia came to me with the air of a certified cruise conductor; he was\r\nwearing his full-dress jumper with the =H=, and had lilies in his\r\nhair. Would the Taubada care to see the natives dance tonight? I wanted\r\nto know if it would be any good. Ahuia puffed his chest and shrugged\r\naway the commonness of all bush natives. Oh, pretty fair, he admitted,\r\nbut the girls around here didn’t do a lot of things they did in the\r\nEast. We passed between aristocratic trunks of betel-nut palms. With\r\neach step the drum-pulse was louder, that jungle beat which can stir\r\nthe same animal-soul that bares its sensuality before the repetitious\r\nchant of a camp-meeting revivalist. A slow cadence, _tum_ teetee, _tum_\r\nteetee, _tum_ teetee _tum_, speeding up to a rapid _tum_ tee-_tum_\r\ntee-_tum_ tee-_tum_. Light shone above oily shoulders, things moved and\r\ntossed like shaggy pillows that had been dyed with every color in the\r\nrainbow. Musicians were slapping hour-glass drums.\r\n\r\nThen with a gasp I realized what those moving pillow-things were.\r\nHeaddresses.... Headdresses made of bird of paradise plumes, hundreds\r\nof the lovely things flowing and flaming in every bushy ball of\r\nhair. Parrot feathers--blue, fire-green and crimson--accentuated the\r\nunearthly hues; and cassowary feathers, built up into high crowns like\r\nglittering sheaves of wheat....\r\n\r\nMen and women danced in two close lines, facing one another. Mouths\r\nwere red with betel-nut, eyes were fixed, intoxicated. Golden skin\r\nflashed through stripes of gaudy paint adorning their hips; golden\r\nbreasts bubbled through showers of bright shells. Yet this was no\r\nblatant exhibition. Each man faced his woman, and if he touched her it\r\nwas according to the rote and rule of tradition; their passions are\r\nnever on public show. Bright skins and delicate bodies revealed the\r\nPolynesian strain which gives the Motuan his urge to laugh and sin with\r\nevery change of the moon. Melanesian women drudge at home and let their\r\nmen wear all the feathers. But the Polynesian wife is nobody’s squaw.\r\n\r\nSlim-waisted, straight, demi-nude, more handsome than grotesque in\r\ntheir paint, each man had his girl opposite him. Her arms and ankles\r\nwere bangled with polychrome shells that tinkled with every suggestive\r\nmovement. It was sensuality expressed in grace and rhythm. Under the\r\nleast of grass skirts women’s buttocks wove with sly languor as couples\r\nmoved in a curious shuffling gait--her hips quivering in retreat, his\r\nin attack: the sex struggle, the male forever in pursuit, the female\r\nalways in flight, yet drawing him on by every allurement within her\r\npower.\r\n\r\nA voice said, “It’s what Yankees call a Marathon dance. The people of\r\nTsiria are competing with the people of Pinapuka. It’ll last until\r\nthey drop--into each other’s arms, a lot of ’em.” I looked around\r\nto see Ron Orr, my inspector, who had been beating along the coast.\r\n“Watch that couple,” he said. A man and girl vanished under the shadowy\r\npalms. “They’ll be back after a while, maybe. During the Marathons here\r\nit’s the fashion for a man to take the one he picks. But only during\r\nthis set period. If they forget and break the rule it’s just too bad.\r\nSometimes a married man loses his head and takes his ‘mary’ away for a\r\nweek end that lasts a month. Then there’s more trouble for the District\r\nOfficer.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Connelly’s going up in the hills tomorrow after a bunch of\r\nmurderers,” Ron said. “That’s the sort of trouble.”\r\n\r\nThere were no priests hovering about to give the pagan spectacle a\r\ndisapproving eye. Protestant missionaries, Wesleyans or Church of\r\nEngland, might have broken up the performance, clothed the ladies in\r\nMother Hubbards and sent them home to brood in sanctity--and secrete\r\ntheir vices. The people of Tsiria, possibly, were not among the Sacred\r\nHeart’s 8,000 converts; and if not, the Church of Rome, with its\r\nbalanced system of discipline and tolerance, would bide its time before\r\ngathering them in. The people would still dance, maybe with a churchly\r\ncurb on their orgiac moments--but they would still dance.\r\n\r\nNight wore on, drums grew wilder. Everybody was chewing the betel-nut\r\nthat natives can go drunk on. My good boy Ahuia was chewing, and his\r\neyes were like live coals as he slavered red and gazed hungrily at the\r\ndancers. I smacked him on the arm and brought him to his senses. We\r\nwere starting for the mountains tomorrow, and I didn’t want Ahuia to go\r\nnative on me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext afternoon, as a floundering whaleboat took us across the narrow\r\nchannel toward the looming mainland, I had a comfortable feeling that\r\nBrother Heinrich had secretly measured me for a coffin which he’d have\r\nto use on somebody else of my size and weight. I might as well say here\r\nand now that I have been the undertaker’s disappointment in twenty-one\r\nyears of knocking about down there. I’m afraid that I offer pretty poor\r\nmaterial for Hollywood.\r\n\r\nConnelly and I, perched in our whaleboat, were off on a murder hunt;\r\nhis quarry would be the human type of killer, mine the assassin-worm\r\nthat yearly laid low more natives than cannibal wars could demolish in\r\na generation. The looming mainland melted to a lace of Papuan bayous;\r\nwe went on nosing up Ethel River, searching for Bioto Creek, a needle\r\nin a haystack of house-high tropical grass. Bloodthirsty mosquitoes\r\nwelcomed us; we could find the miserable town of Bioto, if we could see\r\nit through that buzzing cloud.\r\n\r\nConnelly had elaborated on a number of gruesome things which the\r\nFathers had told me. Somewhere along this coast was the Pacific’s\r\nonly native educational institution, a School of Poisoners, in the\r\nremarkably stinking village of Mou. _Puri-puri_ men graduated with\r\nhonors and knew about arsenic and strychnine to the last dying gasp.\r\nThey were accomplished in “dead-man’s-poison,” which was a spearhead\r\ndipped into a rotting corpse; they made toxic applications by sticking\r\nspears through a floor to pierce the sleeper on his mat. If the natives\r\nbuilt their houses on stilts to keep out evil spirits, the _puri-puri_\r\nmen would crawl under and prong them from below; if they built on the\r\nground, the first malevolent ghost that came along would walk in and do\r\nhis dirtiest. They were between the devil and the deep blue spear.\r\n\r\nPostgraduates of the Mou school had a specialty which required much\r\nstudy, and they prided themselves on it accordingly. It was the\r\nsnake-in-bamboo trick, worked like this: First get on the confidential\r\nside of a certain venomous yellow-striped wriggler, and train him to\r\nlie inside a hollow bamboo wand; then look around for a client who\r\nwants somebody killed. When the time comes, drop your poison pet into\r\nan uncomfortably heated earthen jar; work him up to a frenzy; throw\r\nin scraps of clothes or bodily material from the chosen victim. The\r\nstriking, tormented snake confuses these things with the cause of his\r\npain; so he is ready, he has the scent. Pop him back in the bamboo and\r\nturn him loose in the accustomed path of the man who is about to die.\r\nThe snake, like the elephant, never forgets, according to Connelly and\r\nFather Gerbout. By scent he can pick his man from a long file on the\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nAs we fought our way through the mosquitoes defending Bioto Creek the\r\nDistrict Officer gestured toward the mountains. The Kuni people were\r\nup there--bloody little dwarfs, rather cook a man than fry an egg. The\r\nGovernment holds ’em down a bit, Connelly said, and the priests have\r\ntamed a few. But never trust a Kuni behind your back.\r\n\r\nBioto, when we found it, was a tumbledown huddle of huts. At first we\r\ncouldn’t see a living thing but mosquitoes, then crocodiles, wallowing\r\nin the stream or basking on the mudbanks. All the way up the Ethel\r\nRiver we had counted them by half-dozens, too bold and too lazy to roll\r\noff the sandspits when we came within thirty feet. Bioto was almost\r\na deserted village because of the mosquitoes. D’Albertis, an early\r\nItalian explorer, was the first white man to sleep here; after one\r\nnight he told his father confessor that he wasn’t afraid to go to hell.\r\n\r\nAt last a few scrawny natives, naked except for a coating of mud, came\r\nambling in. Their chief made a melancholy speech, but the message was\r\ncheery enough. We shouldn’t worry, we’d have our forty-seven carriers\r\nin the morning. He repeated this sententiously, as though announcing\r\nbad news. The energetic anopheles pecked their way through the netting\r\nwhen we crawled under for protection. Even Ahuia as he cooked our\r\nsupper looked reduced and crestfallen. He vented his spite by throwing\r\na billycan at a baby crocodile under our house.\r\n\r\nMorning blossomed hot and bright; the chief was back with a motley\r\ncollection of nudes. I saw Connelly marching up and down and telling\r\nthe interpreter dirty words to say to the chief. “Call him a pig’s\r\ntit--no, better go easy on that--but ask him if he can’t count. I\r\nsaid forty-seven and he’s only brought twenty-three. Where’s the rest\r\nof ’em?” There was some mysterious form of native strike. Connelly\r\nordered his police to beat the grass for the absentees. When we got up\r\nto Kubuna Mission Station, he said, he’d hold court and sentence those\r\nbloody runaways to work for me. And at Kubuna that was what he did. The\r\nthirteen or so he sentenced might or might not have been the deserters,\r\nbut they were with me for the balance of that strange month.\r\n\r\nWe left the bulk of our gear with the corporal’s policeman and went\r\non through reed-grass so tall that it arched over our heads. It was\r\nsuffocating between those swishing walls, but we were well quit of\r\nBioto. I don’t know whether Ahuia or I was gladder to get away. The\r\npriests of Yule had filled me with crocodile stories. The beasts were\r\nbolder at nightfall, they said, and they had a bad habit of putting\r\ntheir front paws over the sides of a canoe and grabbing the first\r\nnative who fell into the water. Once a fifteen-footer, basking in the\r\nsun, had challenged Brother George, who was riding a bicycle. Brother\r\nGeorge turned his wheel just in time, and for a long span felt the\r\nmonster’s breath puffing behind. Saint George and the dragon in modern\r\nclothes, only this time the dragon had the saint on the run.\r\n\r\nTwo hours in sweltering grass, then because it was Papua we had to\r\nclimb 800 feet of ridge and climb down again before we could reach the\r\nknoll which was Father Rossier’s mission, all scattered wooden houses\r\naround the chapel’s simple cross. Father Rossier, kind, bearded and\r\nkhaki clad, showed us a little stream down the glen which they had\r\ndammed to make a swimming pool. Connelly, Ron Orr and I undressed,\r\ncackling that the last one in was a nigger. Then plop! Ron Orr dove\r\ninto crystal water--and was out again in record time, swearing under\r\nhis breath. Some bloody fool had left a log in there. Just look at the\r\nway it had skinned his wrist. Yes, the wrist was certainly skinned....\r\n\r\nSlowly, languidly, a crocodile rose and appraised us with cold green\r\neyes. We decided to go to dinner a little dirty.\r\n\r\nAround the mission table with its bare boards and coarse crockery we\r\nwere gratefully aware of being among Frenchmen; they could have broiled\r\nthe crocodile out of their pool and given it the flavor of filet\r\nmignon. In the kitchen were two Sisters who worked Parisian marvels\r\nwith taro and yams and a surprisingly good native asparagus. No canned\r\ngoods here, everything fresh, and that included heart of palm salad\r\npepped up with lime juice. There was some sort of idealized pork, two\r\nkinds of birds, a rich, sound claret, and black coffee far too good\r\nto come out of a French kitchen. The mission grew its own coffee, and\r\nthe berries were ground hot from the oven every morning. Incidentally,\r\nchicory doesn’t thrive in Papua.\r\n\r\nSipping my share of Australian wine--and it can be good--I was thinking\r\nirreverently, “The Fathers manage to do themselves pretty well up\r\nhere,” when I noticed that Father Rossier had watered his glass to a\r\nthin, pale ghost of what every Frenchman must have with his meals or\r\nstarve. They drank sparingly because wine cost money. They ate well--it\r\ncost only labor to raise good crops. On their penny-saving system they\r\nsmoked trade tobacco, and had learned to love its rank kick. They\r\nrefused our cigarettes politely.\r\n\r\nFather Rossier gathered in the people, and to a scanty audience I gave\r\na lantern-light lecture which Ahuia interpreted to an interpreter.\r\nWhen I lectured the priests on their own infections and commented on\r\nthe sparsity of the population Father Rossier told me that they were\r\nslowly increasing. “And that’s because we have discouraged cannibalism,\r\ninfanticide and abortions.”\r\n\r\nI had heard many stories of some magic weed which the native women used\r\nto promote race suicide. I suppose now I wore a cynical smile. “Oh,\r\nbut it’s so,” he said solemnly. “I have seen it happen too often.” He\r\nshowed me curled dry leaves powdered in his hand. “Fortunately European\r\nwomen don’t know about this.”\r\n\r\nI asked him if he knew the relation between yaws and syphilis. These\r\nclosely related diseases affect the procreative functions so that\r\nabortions are apt to occur. Now these dry leaves that the witch doctors\r\nsupply might or might not have a mild action. Certainly they could not\r\neffect an abortion on a normally healthy woman, because modern medicine\r\nhas never found a non-poisonous drug that can. I was making up my\r\ntheory as I went along, but my later observations proved that it was\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the carriers Connelly had sentenced to serve me took on\r\ntheir loads as Ahuia was going through the last motions of packing my\r\nbags. “Look, Taubada!” He held up my extra pair of shoes. One of the\r\npriests had spent the night hobnailing the soles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou read of tropic beauty and smile at the flourishes with which a\r\nwriter attempts to put ecstasy on cold white paper. There are no\r\nwords in our dictionary too fantastic or farfetched to describe that\r\nman-killing climb to the valley of Popo Popo. Milton would have funked\r\nit in his blind visions of Paradise, and De Quincey would have given it\r\nup for lack of words and opium.\r\n\r\nThe region takes its name from some jungle-hidden bird that cries\r\n“Popo-popo-popo-popo,” a bell-like sound that gives a thrill of\r\nmusic. Paradise as we saw it on those days of puffing and scrambling\r\nwas always joy to the mind and pain to the body. Thousands of feet\r\nup, thousands down, with hardly room for a tiny house on any of the\r\nrazor-sharp ridges. Down in a Valley of Eden the “Popo-popo-popo-popo”\r\nsounded, ringing a welcome to the mission’s resthouse somewhere in the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nUp through the giant mass of lawyer-vine with knotted trunks thick\r\nand hard as a walking stick and supple as a morning-glory; from their\r\nstems exotic orchids hung so richly that blossoms whipped your face\r\nas you struggled through greenish twilight. Tree ferns were fine as\r\ncobwebs. The trail was like a slippery stairway running through a\r\ntunnel of opalescent gauze. Rain sifted over clothes that were bogged\r\nin perspiration. Then a small clearing. An awful shriek--What was that?\r\nThe air was all trailing plumes and angel wings, flying colors that\r\nyou can’t believe, even when you see them. Birds of paradise, dozens\r\nand dozens of them, whirling away to the mysterious nests which no\r\nhunter-ornithologist has ever found.\r\n\r\nWith every hundred feet of climb we seemed to see a new variety, plumed\r\nwith white and rose and gold. Much higher were the rare blue ones,\r\nwhich they say are worth twenty-five pounds--if a hunter dares shoot\r\nprotected game. With every flight there was that fierce, dissonant\r\n“Caw-caw-caw.” My eyes were tired of miracles; I was aware of the\r\noozing blisters on my heels, the miserable wetness of my shirt. “Oh,\r\ngo along!” I scolded. “You’re nothing but a lot of painted crows.” We\r\nappreciate beauty best from a padded chair.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, dead to the world, we flopped down in the resthouse\r\n2,400 feet in air. These resthouses are among the mercies which the\r\npriests have scattered for their own long tours and for the comfort of\r\ntravelers. Little bamboo huts are closed with combination locks; the\r\nFathers give you the combination before you start on a trip. Houses are\r\nprovided with chairs and beds, and set at distances that measure off a\r\nstrong man’s endurance for the day. No Alpine traveler, coming upon a\r\nhospice of St. Bernard, could have been more gratified than we, sitting\r\nin real chairs while we opened blisters in our heels and covered them\r\nwith adhesive plaster. Tea revived us, and we squatted around the door.\r\n\r\nWe were over the clouds. Far above them was the crazy pattern of zigzag\r\npoints and ridges. Everything was angled into steeps without even a\r\nhand’s breadth of level ground. Waterfalls cascaded through the glossy\r\njade and emerald. People go crazy in Papua. Why not? All that journey,\r\nwe had struggled past cliffs honeycombed with caves that were stuffed\r\nwith orchids and draped with crimson begonias; birds of paradise flew,\r\narabesques through slanting sun. Now that I am an older man, retired\r\nand with time to think it over, I wonder if I really saw it. This was\r\nnot the land of human beings. When I was a small boy my mother used to\r\nscare me, singing:--\r\n\r\n  Up the airy mountain,\r\n    Down the rushy glen,\r\n  We daren’t go a-hunting\r\n    For fear of little men.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t meet the little men until the day we scaled a higher ridge\r\ntoward Dilava. Dark figures were stealing toward us across a breakneck\r\nstretch of open ground. “They’re Kunis,” Connelly said. This might\r\nhave caused a shudder, but these tiny people--the tallest was no more\r\nthan midget-size--were unarmed and mostly women. They carried loads\r\non their backs, suspended by straps across their foreheads; baskets\r\nof vegetables, bundles of firewood piled on top, and on top of that a\r\nbaby. The women were naked except for a G-string. They had chic, pretty\r\nlittle faces; their bodies were curiosities of distortion: powerful\r\nthighs, short legs, pigeon breasts, sway backs. Their feet were\r\nstranger still, with toes that spread out like the claws of clutching\r\nbirds. The few men who were with them showed the same anatomical\r\nfreakishness, the same G-string.\r\n\r\nThey made gestures toward their fallen loads and let us know that they\r\nhad come to sell vegetables and not to eat us. I studied them and\r\nlearned the secret of their odd shapes. The Kuni people never follow\r\nthe zigzag trails as other tribesmen do. When they cross a ridge they\r\ngo straight up it, straight down the other side. The continual strain\r\nof hillside walking had thrown their whole skeletal structure out of\r\nline. When I saw them walking across one of the few level places in the\r\ndistrict I was struck by their clumsy waddling gait. Yet give them a\r\nmountainside and they speed up like so many goats. They are a study for\r\nevolutionists; the effect of environment on physical characteristics. I\r\nwonder if their babies are born that way?\r\n\r\nDuring our last day’s approach into this incredible Kuni country some\r\nof the trails were no more than wrinkles across mountain brows that\r\nwere all but cliffs; the soil, where there was any on the surface,\r\nhad a greasy texture in the wet, and the least slip might grow into a\r\nskid, then a giddy fall into the milky fog. The mountains had a way of\r\nbreaking suddenly into gaping ravines, a thousand sheer feet down to\r\nthe pouring river.\r\n\r\nAt last we saw Dilava mission station, like a collection of birdhouses\r\nnailed to the crags. It perched on a mat of ground which the priests\r\nhad blasted off the peak. Away up there, when we had panted to the\r\nheight and our sweating bearers had thrown themselves down beside their\r\nloads, we could look over range after range, up through thin air to\r\nMount Yule and Mount St. Mary--maybe 100 miles away, looming 12,000\r\nfeet into calm evening like tall queens, with cloaks of mist that\r\nfoamed from the cavernous valleys.\r\n\r\n(Note from my diary: “If I stay here a week longer I’ll go stark mad\r\nand take to writing poetry.”)\r\n\r\nFather Chabot had just come from the valley, where they were setting\r\nup a sawmill. He pointed down the slopes where small square gardens\r\nstuck like colored rags. Naked Kuni people, forgetful of the days when\r\nhuman flesh was their meat, worked like beavers among their growing\r\nvegetables. “It’s good for them to work,” Father Chabot said; an echo\r\nof the old monkish _Laborare est orare_.\r\n\r\nIt was time to gather them for the lecture, so Father Chabot sent\r\nmessengers to various high points around the ravines. They yelled from\r\ncliff to cliff--high, echoing cries: “Come to the mission station! The\r\nDoctor is at the mission station!” Nature’s telephone, connected by\r\nthe shortest way, took hours to bring the people in; they had to go\r\nroundabout, because the cliffs were too steep for even Kuni feet to\r\nclimb.\r\n\r\nFather Chabot said much the same thing that Father Rossier had said in\r\nthe station below. “Before the mission came this district had dwindled\r\nto less than two thousand. The Kunis would have disappeared if we had\r\nnot discouraged cannibalism, infanticide and abortion.” I wondered if\r\nthe good priests were not fooling themselves. Abortion and infanticide\r\nmay reduce a population, but cannibalism and continual tribal warfare\r\nmay be blessings in hideous disguise. They keep the tribes apart.\r\nWarfare is a sort of rough quarantine. _In times of peace strangers\r\nwander in and out, and bring infections with them. Native races die off\r\nnot through their own suicidal customs, but through diseases introduced\r\nfrom the outside world._\r\n\r\nLecturing that night, my attention was caught by something that gave my\r\naudience a troll-like look: several little pigs followed the women with\r\nthe affection of lap dogs. When the women sat down the pigs jumped in\r\ntheir laps. And what in the world was that one doing? I stopped talking\r\nto look again--one of the women had picked up her pig and was holding\r\nit to her breast, nursing it. There was a second woman doing the same\r\nthing, and a third. This might have taken a deal of explaining, but its\r\nreason was purely economic. A sow had died in pig-birth and left an\r\norphan litter.\r\n\r\nTaller, darker people who came in for the second lecture--we gave three\r\nthat night--were as curious to me as the pig-nursing women. The young\r\nbucks were wearing corsets, tight-strapped arrangements of bark that\r\nsqueezed them to the perfect hour-glass figure. I asked Father Chabot\r\nif these were effeminates and he chuckled, “The fellows in this tribe\r\nnever do a lick of work--the women are the field hands. Well, if a\r\nwoman sees a man with an especially small belly she says, ‘He doesn’t\r\neat much. He ought to be easy to support.’ But he takes off his corset\r\nthe day they’re married--and she goes on working.”\r\n\r\nI had to change carriers again before we went on to Deva Deva. No use\r\narguing; these fellows knew that there was very bad sorcery over the\r\nmountains. I paid them off with three sticks of trade tobacco per man.\r\nBut the thirteen who had run away and been rounded up again stayed\r\nfaithfully by me. They had to. Before Connelly pushed on he said,\r\n“Hang on to that bag of salt. From now on trade tobacco’s no good.”\r\nEverywhere I went I found the people stampeding for salt. They would\r\nput it in water, rank, and drink it as you would lemonade. When I doled\r\nout a spoonful in payment for something there were always children\r\nreaching up in hopes that I would spill some. The priests of Yule had\r\nwarned me not to be too generous with the precious stuff. I might start\r\na high-price epidemic. A Kuni or Mondo or Mafulu man who had his own\r\nbag of salt might retire on what we’d call a million dollars. They\r\nsay that these mountain people drink themselves sick with sea water\r\nwhenever they get to it. But the Government has forbidden the practice\r\nof recruiting them for labor; most of the few who ever reached the\r\ncoast died of malaria.\r\n\r\nThe high-price epidemic had already struck Deva Deva. For an assortment\r\nof food which included sweet potatoes, yams, taro, pumpkins, bananas,\r\nsugar cane, pawpaws and two chickens they unreasonably asked two\r\ntablespoonfuls of salt. That wasn’t right. Last year the price had been\r\none teaspoonful, and glad to take it. They were getting spoiled. But\r\nhad they known it, I would have given bushels of solid brine for one of\r\nthe delicious okari nuts which they usually threw in as a bonus. These\r\nthings, in the husk, are as large as lemons; crack them open and you\r\nhave something the size and shape of a cigar, with the flavor of an\r\nalmond, only twice as good.\r\n\r\nAll along the tumbled way I tried to investigate recent epidemics of\r\ndysentery. The germs were probably fly-borne to a large extent; also\r\none might blame the local habit of eating with dirty fingers. Though\r\nsoil pollution was common enough to cause a large hookworm infection,\r\nthere was stream pollution too, because like many other Melanesians\r\nthe mountain folk stand in water to perform their natural functions;\r\notherwise, they tell you, the _puri-puri_ man will get some of their\r\nbowel movement for his black magic.\r\n\r\nIn giving out tins to these villagers I encountered a kind of shyness\r\nnew to me. They hadn’t the least prejudice or tabu against our form of\r\nexamination, but when Ahuia asked this man or that what name should be\r\nwritten on his specimen he would simper and wriggle and shut up like\r\na clam. Ahuia told me grimly, “He shamed to tell name belong him.”\r\nFinally he would manage to cajole the reticent one into whispering\r\nhis name to his neighbor, who passed it on, whispering. In the land\r\nof ghosts frightened men will change their names, often two or three\r\ntimes, to fool the evil spirits of their dead relatives who come\r\nsearching in the dark. Fiend-haunted natives have so many aliases that\r\nthey can’t remember the last one, if asked suddenly. I lost a great\r\ndeal of time trying to pump the name from one blushing warrior. Finally\r\na mission boy bawled out, “Oh, Joni!” (meaning Johnnie)--and the man\r\nstepped up.\r\n\r\nI found the Kunis only too anxious to listen and obey instructions.\r\nThey were firm believers in the “se-nake in bell’” theory, and we were\r\nmagicians who had come to relieve their bellies. There were old women,\r\nthey said, who could remove the snake by sucking it from your ears,\r\nyour nose, your navel. Did anybody ever see the snakes? No, Taubada,\r\nsuch magic only removed “the ghost of a snake”--and the serpent was so\r\nvery tabu that you would surely die if you even looked at him as he\r\ncrawled out of you.\r\n\r\nJestingly one of the Sacred Heart priests said that the witches were\r\nworking in competition with the Rockefeller Foundation. That sounded\r\nfunny; but I discovered that it was true.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAhuia told me that a magician was coming to a house “over there”\r\nand had asked to have me see him cure a woman of her snake. It was\r\nlike a call to a medical consultation. The house over there was a\r\nleaf-thatched hut, spooky with faint lights through mountain dark.\r\nAmong the branches queer birds croaked like frogs.\r\n\r\nInside the dirt-floored room, lit by a hurricane lantern, a nude woman\r\nlay on her back. Her abdomen was puffed; it looked like a gastric case,\r\nsuperinduced by intestinal parasites. There were other witnesses, men\r\nin the all-prevalent G-string, and among them the black local constable\r\nwhose services I might appreciate. Dead silence reigned, except for the\r\nwoman’s painful breathing.\r\n\r\nA wizened little man came in quietly. He wore no paint or feathers, and\r\nhis air was professional, as if he intended to put on rubber gloves\r\nand lecture before a class in surgery. A small boy followed with an\r\nearthen pot and a basket; he set these near where the woman lay. The\r\nwitch doctor was businesslike, striking a trade match and dropping it\r\ninto the pot, his face lit by the red flame. Daintily he reached into\r\nhis basket and took out dried leaves, which he scattered over the fire.\r\nThe room was fragrant with smoke. He crouched and said an incantation.\r\nEven though he was speaking in the strangest of strange languages his\r\nvoice had a thick sound, as if he were talking through a mouthful of\r\nyams. Suddenly he sprang to his feet, went over to the patient and put\r\nhis mouth tightly on her navel. There was a series of sucking sounds.\r\nHe lifted his head and out of his mouth fell a little brown snake. It\r\nwriggled across the swollen abdomen, then glided to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe wizard rose and turned to me with a professional bow. “How was\r\nthat, Doctor?” “Very good indeed, Doctor,” my eyes replied. The native\r\nconstable asked the woman how she felt now, and she said, “Oh, so much\r\nbetter!” Even in the dim light it was easy to see what the sorcerer had\r\ndone. It isn’t hard to carry a small snake in your mouth, if you don’t\r\nmind understudying Bosco.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was giving my own exhibition of magic. We had lingered\r\nhere long enough to administer chenopodium and Epsom salts and to\r\nwash the specimens for observation. In the throng I recognized my\r\nrival physician, and he was a long time studying the slides. At last\r\nhe turned away with a stony face. Was he convinced that my method was\r\nsuperior to his? I doubt it. It takes a great deal to change the mind\r\nof an old-school doctor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find that Dilava, Deva Deva and Mafulu ran over 90\r\nper cent infections. This upset all my previous convictions, but when I\r\nstopped to consider it, this was not so remarkable. One carrier, coming\r\nin from the outside world, could easily infect a village, for these\r\nsettlements were perched on narrow ridges not over twenty feet wide.\r\nIn Okaka, for example, there was barely elbow room and no attempt at\r\nsanitation. Here, when the natives left home, they must all follow the\r\nsame trail. They lived like animals, and like animals they died.\r\n\r\nIf I were a sentimentalist I would think of Father Fastre with a smile\r\nand a tear. He was the giant priest who presided over Popolo Mission;\r\nhe was all brawn, with the great red beard of a bush frontiersman.\r\nSometimes a fey look would come into his eyes; for here is tremendous\r\nloneliness for a white man, which neither work nor prayer can quite\r\nbanish from a mind that consorts with spirits and grows more morbid\r\nyear by year. But Father Fastre had a sense of humor which saved him, I\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nWhen he first talked to me he braced his big shoulders against the\r\nguest house porch and told me about the sacred G-string. The G-string\r\nis not only a stingily concealing garment; in these mountains it is\r\nthe mark of a “true man.” With it he is respected, a tribesman in good\r\nstanding; without it he is a pariah--he isn’t properly dressed, that’s\r\nall. With Biblical simplicity they say of the G-string wearer, “He is a\r\ntrue man and belongs to the true people.”\r\n\r\nNow Father Fastre and a colleague were the first white men to penetrate\r\nthis Kuni country, and they were great curiosities because they came\r\nin their priestly robes, to impress their faith upon the savages. At\r\nDeva Deva they were shown to a native house which was about as private\r\nas a goldfish bowl; they were no sooner in it than the dwarfish Kunis\r\ncame crowding in, gibbering and peering at the strangers in the long\r\nskirts. After a spell of whispering one of them stole up behind the\r\npriest, who had just leaned over to tie his shoelace. Slyly the little\r\nsavage lifted Father Fastre’s robe, and went suddenly across the room,\r\npropelled by the Frenchman’s big fist. The situation was tense. The\r\nonlookers were all armed killers. A dread silence fell. Then the crowd\r\nburst into a gale of laughter.\r\n\r\n“They were trying to find out if I was a man,” Father Fastre grinned.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he told me to take a good look at an approaching native.\r\n“A few years ago he brought his little boy to our school and we dressed\r\nhim up for mass in clean European clothes. His father saw him and flew\r\ninto a frenzy. ‘I want to take him home,’ he said, ‘he’s not properly\r\ndressed.’ When I asked what was indecent about a nice white shirt\r\nand trousers the man gasped, ‘But where’s his G-string?’ and made a\r\nterrible scene. He wasn’t going to let neighbors say that his son\r\nwasn’t of the True People.”\r\n\r\nThe Mafulu folk divide the world into three parts, Missionaries,\r\nBelitan (British) and True People. Up here crocodiles have been killed\r\nat an altitude of 5,000 feet and the natives “know their name.” True\r\nPeople have an annoying way of high-hatting unfamiliar things. They\r\nmerely say “We do not know its name.” They have a name for salt, which\r\nis _ama_. Once they ate it the way native traders from the coast\r\npalmed it off on them, mixed with sand. When white salt came they “did\r\nnot know its name”--but brine hunger got the better of them and they\r\nlearned to love it. In their gardens mere women are not allowed to\r\nplant yams because these are “true gardens,” and women are considered\r\ntoo dirty either to plant or eat the precious vegetable. They are\r\npermitted to plant taro, but yam work and yam eating are for True Men.\r\nIt’s all very confusing, and as ridiculous as some of our civilized\r\nconventions.\r\n\r\nAhuia was never quite the man of the world among these stranger tribes.\r\nFather Fastre’s jolly Mondos were piling lumber, down below Popolo.\r\nThe first night we stopped there Ahuia and Quai came creeping up to my\r\ndoor. “Taubada,” they whimpered, “we scared, we like sleep along you.”\r\nWith no further explanation they curled up on the floor and slept the\r\nvelvet sleep of the native.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Father Fastre about this he laughed. “My Mondo boys acted\r\nthe same way last night. They wouldn’t come within a mile of your boys.\r\nYou know why that is, don’t you? Witchcraft. They ‘do not know the\r\nname’ of strange people, and keep away from them for fear they’ll cast\r\nsome evil spell.”\r\n\r\nFather Fastre could smile at evil spells, but Papua was getting him.\r\nOne night he stood in front of his mission and looked down over a\r\nveil of moonlight. He seemed to be talking to himself. “Ten years ago\r\nI could count ten thousand people along those hills. They are gone.\r\nSometimes I hear their voices.”\r\n\r\nHe told me that he often heard voices. The Bishop had better send him\r\nhome for a while, I thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were a hundred miles inland when I decided that the mountains beyond\r\nwould offer no new health problems. We had found hookworms enough for\r\nten years. There were plenty of mosquitoes, but no malaria, although\r\nconditions were ideal for it. But the _Anopheles punctulatus_ of the\r\ncoast had not penetrated so far inland. There were no enlarged spleens.\r\nOnly one reasonable conclusion offered itself--malaria must be a recent\r\nimportation to Papua.\r\n\r\nHow Father Fastre’s big Mondo boys could sing! What a splendid chorus\r\nof rich, deep voices, the only really native harmony singing I heard\r\nin the South Pacific. In other tribes, and on other islands, too often\r\nthey chant monotonously in unison; or they borrow syrupy chords from\r\nmission hymnals and Tin Pan Alley. Here among the Mondos their ballads\r\nand war songs were beautiful, soul-stirring things. One of the priests,\r\nFather Morin, who was an able musician and a nobleman in France, tried\r\nin vain to set down these songs; he failed because the Mondo has\r\nquarter-notes which the European scale does not recognize. But it is\r\ntrue harmony--I say this in the face of many learned anthropologists\r\nwho have decided that there are no chords in primitive music. A troop\r\nof naked Mondos, war dancing, swinging sticks as they used to swing\r\nspears, filling the air with their big organ-notes, is a sound and a\r\nspectacle that fills the heart with rapturous fear.\r\n\r\nThey marched with me to their boundary singing and holding both my\r\nhands as we swung along. I could have done without the hand-holding,\r\nfor I had heard of a certain honored custom: two men hold the\r\nstranger’s hands while a third steals up behind him with a club. Not so\r\nthese merry fellows, who left me with a cheer and marched away, still\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the tuneful Mondos my stride was snappy and sure-footed.\r\nThe priests had put a brand-new set of hobnails in my shoes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have snake stories to remind me of that mountain trail. The last\r\nthree feet of an anaconda was visible in the slippery mud; my foot\r\nmissed him by an inch; if I hadn’t stopped suddenly with one leg in\r\nair, he might have squeezed out my life. Again, when I wandered a\r\nlittle ahead of my carriers--they usually thrashed around so that they\r\nscared _gaigais_ away--I felt a whirring under my foot, and something\r\nlike a tack-hammer struck my leg. It was one of those deadly little\r\nstriped fellows that the _puri-puri_ men train to bite. Fortunately I\r\nwas wearing heavy leather puttees....\r\n\r\nA crocodile bade us farewell at dusk as we were swinging downriver in a\r\nfrail canoe. We were moving philosophically along when a native paddler\r\npushed me flat. A scissor-like snout horned up, a foot from where I\r\nhad been sitting. He had been attracted by my white shirt, extremely\r\ntempting bait. Brother Heinrich might have used my coffin after all.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t go back by way of Bioto. I’d rather die of one crocodile than\r\na million mosquitoes. We went over to the Aropiquina sawmill and picked\r\nup a whaleboat for Yule Island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the priests of Yule I found Brother Heinrich grinning away his\r\ndisappointment. I was a pretty tired doctor when the good men put me\r\nto bed. Brother Heinrich managed to get hold of my best heavy shoes,\r\nand looked ruefully at the soles when he mentioned pulling out the\r\nhobnails. In the morning he brought them back. He hadn’t stopped at\r\nhobnails. He had resoled them, and beautifully.\r\n\r\nAll that month of tramping, up to Mafulu and back again, the priests\r\nof the Sacred Heart had showered me with these simple kindnesses. They\r\nrefused all payment and modestly waved aside my thanks. Hereditary\r\nMethodist though I am, I honor them as the best missionaries and the\r\nbest hosts in New Guinea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER ON CONTRASTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Papua the dryest statistician might easily burst into the literary\r\nstyle of Sinbad the Sailor. At the time of year that folks back in\r\nUtica call “autumn” I had traversed great areas of ragged mountains and\r\nboggy shores, and had done my best to hold on to my statistical mind in\r\na land where census figures were evasive as blowing chaff. Meanwhile my\r\nfield units had been working all over the Territory, and the inspectors\r\nwho led them were often lost to me for months at a time. Aside from my\r\nfact-finding studies of hookworm I was following the course of malaria,\r\nwhich is Melanesia’s deadliest blight.\r\n\r\nField technique may seem monotonous to the reader, for it is just a\r\nmatter of making the same tests over and over, moving on and continuing\r\nthe motion in another tribe or village. But it was never monotonous to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCompare the mountains of Mafulu with the delightful little village of\r\nGaile, not more than twenty-five miles from Port Moresby. The Gaile\r\nfolk lived Venetian-style, their houses stilted over tidewater. They\r\nwere gentle, industrious and generous Motuans, and with no evil history\r\nbehind them. An invading maritime race, they had built over water\r\nto avoid their savage enemies; and the water had always been their\r\nblessing, for it carried away the bodily waste that breeds so many\r\nworms and germs. Gaile I remember as one of the few truly restful spots\r\nI have visited in the Pacific. There were no diseases worth worrying\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThen, since I’m dwelling on comparisons, let’s look at Tepusilia, a\r\nfew miles away. My whaleboat got stranded there on the way to Gaile,\r\notherwise I should never have seen the row of dirty chicken coops\r\nthat leaned crazily over the inlet. I hadn’t much time to look into\r\ntheir case, but I found the inhabitants covered with tropical ringworm\r\nthat had turned their skins into a brownish crêpe. But there was\r\nno hookworm, because they evacuated into the sea, as the Gaile folk\r\ndid. A few miles inland, where the people had no access to the water,\r\nankylostomiasis was very prevalent.\r\n\r\nI can’t pass Tepusilia by without mentioning the lone policeman there.\r\nBecause his house was the only clean one, I was glad to sleep in it. He\r\nsat in a chair not quite wide enough for Shirley Temple, and kept me\r\nawake with a constant stream of questions. How had the World War come\r\nout? (That, mind you, was 1920.) Sleepily I informed him that Britannia\r\nstill ruled the waves, and he seemed surprised. He told me that he had\r\nserved his time in Port Moresby jail, and had come out well-educated.\r\nThen he looked wistfully at my chin and asked if I shaved with a razor.\r\n“Yes,” I said, “and don’t you?” “No,” he said, “I shave with a shark’s\r\ntooth.” He showed me the shark’s tooth and asked me if I wouldn’t give\r\nhim a real razor, a nice sharp one. The subject was growing a bit\r\nmorbid, so I sat up and asked him what he had gone to jail for. “Oh,”\r\nhe sighed, “I was falsely accused of killing a man. Taubada, don’t you\r\nthink you can give me a razor?” “No,” I said softly and turned my face\r\nto the wall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom pleasant Gaile I followed the course of the lakatoi for 700 miles\r\nacross the Gulf of Papua into the land of the Goaribari savages. The\r\nlakatoi was already growing extinct. From time immemorial the watermen\r\nin the Motu district had been building these giant vessels, from five\r\nto ten long canoes lashed side by side and covered with a platform that\r\nwould support houseroom for maybe twenty men. Every spring, when the\r\nwind blew toward the northwest, Motuan traders would carry a load of\r\npots and jars over to the wretched Purari Delta and exchange them for\r\nlogs and sago. They would stay until Christmas, when the hot monsoon\r\ncould blow them home again. During the trading season there was a\r\ntruce between the peaceful Motuans and the man-eating Goaribaris. The\r\nannual voyages in these raft-ships were among the strangest things that\r\ncharmed a Polynesian wanderer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnromantically in a chugging steamer I crossed the Gulf and came upon\r\nthe terrible land of terrible people. The business of public health\r\ncalled me there; Kenny Fooks had been surveying the Delta region for\r\nmonths, and was so lost to me that he might have been sucked into\r\nthe prevalent mud. The Delta region is ravaged by rivers that pour\r\nmud upon mud or throw up shifting sand banks that wallow and stink\r\nlike dead sea monsters. As I came ashore with Ahuia, long-nosed faces\r\nstared hungrily. These were the type of Goaribaris I had seen on the\r\nplantations, but dirtier, skinnier. You think of cannibals as tiger\r\nmen, fierce-faced and lusty. But these were brothers to the jackal.\r\n\r\nI was interested in something curiously inhuman that wagged from the\r\nbuttocks of the queer fellows. The old men around Port Moresby had told\r\nme that Goaribaris grew tails as long as monkeys’ tails, and let them\r\nhang down through holes bored in their floors; and the way to catch a\r\nGoaribari was to sneak under the house, tie a knot in his tail then\r\nrun up top and grab him at your leisure. This story, unfortunately, is\r\nanother nature fake. What this Delta savage wears at the stern of his\r\nbreechclout probably gave rise to the yarn. It is a sort of dangler,\r\nnot unlike a horse’s tail, and, with his long hair done in ringlets\r\nstuck together with mud, adds to his mildly demoniac look.\r\n\r\nThe customary nude policeman, distinguished by a cap and an entirely\r\nempty cartridge belt, told Ahuia that his house, where we would sleep,\r\nwas in Dopima where the famous martyr missionary, James Chalmers,\r\nwas murdered in 1901. But our policeman gallantly assured us that we\r\nneedn’t be afraid now, because Government took care of everything.\r\nThe house was stilted very high to keep devil-devils out. A sickly\r\nlooking native stood at the foot of the ladder, wistfully waiting. In\r\nthe background were a pack of the most repulsive women I have ever\r\nseen. Their breasts hung like empty bags, their greasy black faces were\r\npuckered to an animal look--a picture of lost femininity.\r\n\r\nKenny asked the policeman to go tell the fellow that it wasn’t the\r\nfashion to solicit white men. I looked at Kenny’s soiled legs and\r\nremarked that he was inviting hookworms. “Inviting them? They accepted\r\nthe invitation weeks ago, and I’m all fed up with chenopodium and\r\nsalts. My score was twenty-six good ones--Necators, of course. You’ve\r\ngot to go barefoot in this bloody country or you’ll be sucked under,\r\nfeet-first.”\r\n\r\nThe popular name for these Delta people is Goaribari, but there are\r\nreally several related tribes, many of them of a somewhat higher type.\r\nThey are named after their principal or central village--like the\r\nKaimares, for instance. The Kaimares are much the better builders, but\r\nthey get none of the benefits of over-water sanitation and live quite\r\ninnocent of anything like a latrine. The hookworm infestation was\r\nprobably much less general in the old days of unchecked cannibalism and\r\nwarfare. Even when I inspected various sections and compared notes with\r\nKenny Fooks I found that some places reeked with worms, others were\r\ncomparatively free. It was spreading, I could venture. The Goaribaris\r\nno longer hunt each other openly, and they do a great deal of visiting\r\naround.\r\n\r\nA village consists of three houses, one of them 100 to 150 yards long\r\nand 30 yards wide. These are “crocodile houses”; the main entrance\r\nis a gaping mouth, the rear narrows to a long tail. A corridor\r\nruns full-length; small cubicles open on either side, in the less\r\npretentious dwellings, and each cubicle suffices for an entire family.\r\nBut the largest of the houses is a sort of clubhouse where the men live\r\nand teach pubescent boys the arts of Delta manhood. In this building\r\nthere is a smaller door halfway down the passage; beside it a niche\r\ncontains an altar painted with the frightful face of a devil-devil, and\r\nin front of it is an offering of human skulls.\r\n\r\nI did not quite believe the grisly tales of peddling women’s hacked\r\nbodies around the sandspits and offering choice cuts to willing\r\npurchasers. They said a lot of things about these miserable creatures.\r\nAs to cannibalism, the Government had hanged so many of them for it\r\nthat if they ate “long-pig” at all they must have conducted their\r\nbanquets with Masonic secrecy. Yet I saw the pile of skulls around\r\nthe devil-devil altar. The interpreter told me they were “skulls of\r\nancestors.” Perhaps.... I had a mental picture of Missionary Chalmers,\r\nwhose bones had been very hard to recover, according to one eyewitness.\r\n\r\nWe were quite unarmed. The man with the cap and cartridge belt seemed\r\nto exercise a remarkable control over the other natives. Along the line\r\nof publicity he was another P. T. Barnum. After his fireside chats the\r\npeople came slinking in, droves of them, milling around the imported\r\nmagician who could take snakes from the belly. We didn’t recover many\r\nsnakes, for our job was to make microscopic examinations and determine\r\nthe ratio of infection. However, from a lad named Komo, I recovered\r\n107, and Kenny Fooks did better still. Now and then as I looked over my\r\nscrawny audience I would see a man with clean skin and good muscle; and\r\nI would know that he had just returned from indentured service on one\r\nof the plantations.\r\n\r\nKaimare houses looked more like crocodiles than the Goaribari jumbles.\r\nIn going through one of their larger buildings I found a sort of\r\nsanctum, completely shut off. As I started through the door my guides,\r\nwho had been pleasant enough, suddenly showed their teeth and attempted\r\nto block my entrance. I pushed my way through; perhaps my prestige as\r\na magician saved me from rough handling. Then I jumped back. The room\r\nwas full of crocodiles, big ones, little ones, on the floor, crawling\r\nup the walls. I blinked, and saw what these things really were--woven\r\nof some sort of pliable reed, they were artfully modeled; and as I\r\nsighed my relief I remembered scraps of what Cushing, who lived among\r\nthe Zuni Indians, had written: “Primitive peoples generally conceive of\r\neverything made ... as living ... a still sort of life, but as potent\r\nand aware nevertheless and as capable of functioning....”\r\n\r\nThere were more human skulls. I decided to get out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Bamu country beyond, I saw the most repulsive people in all\r\nPapua. The Bamus live in mud, and nature seems to have fitted them for\r\ntheir environment. They are as skinny and long as dead eels, and appear\r\nto be split clear to the breastbone in order to give their storklike\r\nlegs a chance to hoist them out of the muck.\r\n\r\nNo white man can stay long in this blighted country without a feeling\r\nof extreme depression and hopelessness for the ill-favored branches of\r\nthe human race. It was fortunate for my peace of mind one morning when\r\nour canoe swept into a deep estuary and I saw something that blossomed\r\nlike a flower garden in a city dump: a lakatoi from the Gaile region!\r\nA big, seven-canoe one, and a crowd of laughing, gesturing, bargaining\r\nMotu men busily trading with the Delta folk. The shore was bright with\r\npots and jars, the water was jammed with loose logs which the savages\r\nhad floated down from faraway hills, hundreds of miles from Mudland. A\r\ncurious trading.\r\n\r\nThere was a carnival air. Even the Goaribaris puckered their jackal\r\nfaces into a smile. I asked a Motu trader if he wasn’t getting tired of\r\nit; and didn’t he want to go home? He laughed and answered in effect,\r\n“And how!” Soon the hot December wind would be blowing homeward to fill\r\ntheir coco sails and take them blundering back to their clean little\r\nVenice. Then the long truce would be over and the Goaribari would be\r\nhis old sweet self again.\r\n\r\nI was glad when the Purari Delta and I parted company. If professional\r\nwork had called me back I would have gone, but not without a secret\r\nwish for some cleaner, greener land. This is probably the lousiest\r\nplace that God ever made and didn’t quite finish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had been closely watching the principal carrier of malaria, a lady\r\nmosquito of the _Anopheles punctulatus_ tribe, and the odder varieties\r\nof flies and mosquitoes I had been sending to Dr. Francis Root,\r\nbiologist of Johns Hopkins. Since quinine was malaria’s one known\r\nspecific, I was rather fussy about teaching my inspectors to take their\r\ndaily dose. I knew what a delirious wreck an attack can make of a white\r\nman in the jungle, and I had impressed upon my young inspectors that I\r\nwould not forgive any carelessness about quinine--five grains a day as\r\na prophylactic, and at the slightest symptom increase the dose until\r\nthe temperature swings back to normal. Those were written orders.\r\n\r\nThen as I worked down the coast on the last leg of my Papuan adventure,\r\nI came down with malaria, in spite of large precautionary doses of\r\nquinine which swamp and jungle conditions had made necessary. I was too\r\nmiserable to laugh at myself when I got to the snug little settlement\r\non Samarai, the eastern tip of Papua’s tail. I was a bilious wreck; I\r\nsaw yellow. The neat British town was pretty as a bride, but I was in\r\nno bridegroom mood. One of my inspectors, a new one who had already\r\nproven shiftless, also showed up with malaria. I had to be restrained\r\nfrom throwing him downstairs. Why? Because he hadn’t taken his quinine,\r\nand had allowed himself to get sick. At the Widow Henderson’s hotel,\r\nthe town’s only meeting place, I invited another fight. A one-armed\r\nplanter and I sat in the barroom, the only possible place to talk, and\r\nwere discussing a survey in his district when a dough-faced stranger\r\npoked his head between us and asked if the planter was afraid of\r\nhim, or what? Instead of brushing him off I kicked over my chair and\r\nreverted to common Australian: “Open your mouth to say one word and I’m\r\ninta you, right now!” The stranger departed. A couple of days later\r\nthe Widow Gofton, who served the bar, said: “When that man gets tough\r\naround here now I just say to him, ‘Look out, or I’ll call the Doctor.’”\r\n\r\nI saw Samarai through jaundiced eyes, and biliousness gave me a sort\r\nof malign power when it came to an argument. However, I managed to\r\nbe diplomatic when I found that Samarai was having a City Beautiful\r\ncampaign and didn’t want its view spoiled by a row of over-water\r\nlatrines. To the health officer, of course, that was nonsense; Paradise\r\nmight be lined with those coquettish little shrines and he would call\r\nit perfect--at least, that was what the esthetes implied when I argued.\r\n\r\nSwallowing bile, I combined architecture with diplomacy and devised\r\nsome dainty palm-thatched sanctums to sit over the tide, with rustic\r\nbridges running out to them and clumps of croton to act as screens. I\r\nbecame an engineer and sketched out plans for deep pits to be dug into\r\nthe coral and filled with rubble so that the contents would be sifted\r\ngently out to sea. I left too soon to find out whether or not they\r\nfollowed my plan. It was just another quarrel between Hygeia and Mrs.\r\nGrundy. In such a fracas Mrs. G. usually comes out the winner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two fights in Samarai were more than counterbalanced by two\r\nfortunate meetings. One night I came into Bob Whitten’s sheet-iron\r\ntrading store and saw a figure quite out of harmony with the smelly\r\nhurricane lamps and piled-up canned goods. His smart dinner suit gave\r\nhim a clubby look which stirred the old bile, for I had been out in the\r\nfield and was a mass of dirt and scratches. He turned a wind-hardened\r\nbusiness face and a pair of Scotch-gray eyes. “Are you Dr. Lambert?” he\r\nasked. I said that I was. “My name’s George Fulton,” he said. George\r\nFulton was executive head of the powerful Lever Brothers firm, who\r\nbought and sold islands, controlled supplies and shipping, over a great\r\nwatery empire. He began popping keen, intelligent questions at me, and\r\nI forgot his evening clothes after one exciting revelation.\r\n\r\n“Know anything about Rennell Island, Doctor?” I had heard of it\r\nsketchily from a skipper who said that nobody ever went ashore, for\r\nfear of the natives, and that there was nothing worth trading for.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fulton said: “It’s just off the blue-black Solomons, but the\r\npeople aren’t black. Nobody knows what they are. They’re primitive\r\nas monkeys, but rather superior humans. Sleep in caves, worship an\r\ninvisible god, have traditions that may be either Polynesian or\r\nCaucasian. Since the white man came to the Pacific, there hasn’t been\r\na landing party that’s penetrated Rennell farther than the beach. They\r\nsimply won’t let strangers get in. Why? Maybe they’re protecting\r\nthemselves against foreign disease, or maybe it’s the same old tabu.\r\nFor ages they’ve been practically untouched.\r\n\r\n“Missionaries tried it not long ago, and three of them got knocked on\r\nthe head. I know more about this island than most. It’s a sort of lost\r\nworld, terrible cliffs all around it, one small beach protected by a\r\nreef. Last year we were short on labor and thought we might recruit\r\nsome of the men. Fine, strapping fellows--incidentally, the women are\r\nvery pretty. Well, we picked up a handful of laborers, bribed them with\r\nhatchets and jackknives. They’re crazy for steel and iron. They do\r\ntheir carving with shells.”\r\n\r\nI asked what became of the men he took away; I was afraid he’d stop\r\ntalking and go to somebody’s bridge table, but he said:\r\n\r\n“Around the Solomons we would put a few of them ashore here and there\r\nto work on the plantations. Before we could up-anchor they would\r\nplump into the sea and swim back to the ship. Finally we gave them up\r\nand took the survivors home. Interesting folk? Rather! They’re not\r\ncastaways or newcomers. They’ve been there since God made them. They\r\nmight be worth a scientific man’s time.”\r\n\r\nHe moved away but I almost tripped him up. “Mr. Fulton, if they are an\r\nuntouched people, they must be free from imported diseases. I’ve pretty\r\nwell decided that the natives are dying off from the worms and germs\r\nthat white men, orientals, and friendly tribes bring in.” He nodded\r\napprovingly, and I plunged on, “It would be very valuable to me, and\r\nto the world too, if I could study these Rennellese. Hookworm, for\r\ninstance ... If they have it at all it might be a variety we have never\r\nseen ...”\r\n\r\n“Well, Doctor--some time when one of our boats swings your way....”\r\n\r\nGeorge Fulton was a super-businessman. I decided not to let him forget\r\nhis offer, and for half a year I showered his Australian office with\r\nremindful letters. Finally my insistence bore fruit--of a mixed variety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe young inspector whom I had found guilty of idleness and malaria and\r\nejected from my staff had been scheduled to survey the Trobriands, two\r\nor three days sailing to the north. The shortage of help compelled me\r\nto take my headache and a supply of quinine and cover the job myself.\r\nBut in the South Pacific you don’t just buy a ticket and start. You\r\nplay Micawber until something turns up. In this case the turn-up\r\nwas the fantastic little cutter _Bomada_, owned in partnership by a\r\nprofessional butterfly collector and a hairy-chested planter-adventurer\r\nnamed Bob Bunting. The butterfly collector had a German name and\r\nlooked rather Chinese. Bob Bunting was something of a slave driver\r\nwhen he managed plantations; if native laborers lay down to die of\r\nwitch-doctoring he revived them with a bull-whip. Bob’s sort survive in\r\nthe tropics.\r\n\r\nSo we were off in the crazy craft, which promptly broke down in a\r\nmushy, drizzly rain. And that was where I had the other pleasant\r\nmeeting. Out of the glazed mist loomed a whaleboat, steadily rowed.\r\nA gorgeously American voice yelled, “Hey, can I do anything for you\r\nfellows?” A young man sprang aboard; almost before he spoke again I was\r\nthinking, “I just kicked out an incompetent, and there’s the boy to\r\ntake his place.”\r\n\r\nHis name, he said, was Byron Beach. Enthusiastically he scrambled into\r\nhis whaleboat and brought back an outdated pile of _Saturday Evening\r\nPost_ copies, and Theodore Roosevelt’s book on the “River of Doubt.”\r\nAmericanism stuck out all over the boy. He had graduated from one of\r\nthe better New England preparatory schools, then war broke out and he\r\ndecided to “travel.” Possibly he was a conscientious objector; but\r\nByron Beach was no slacker. His headlong bravery and resourcefulness in\r\na later adventure proved that.\r\n\r\nBob Bunting, who knew everybody, accused him of being too keen for the\r\nMilne Bay traders; they were ganging up against him. Beach had been\r\nout after copra and had bought so much under competitive noses that\r\nlocal dealers were swearing vengeance. An enterprising lad. When the\r\nold engine came to life again I said, “Beach, if they make it too hot\r\nfor you here, why not join my outfit?” His young face flushed with\r\npleasure. “Golly, Doctor, that would be swell!”\r\n\r\nI was afraid that would be the last I’d ever see of him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur breakdown at Dobu gave us a view of the geyser field at Seymour Bay\r\nwhich matches the Yellowstone. The greatest spouter is Seo-seo-kuna,\r\nwhich roars like a hundred menageries. Beside one of the boiling\r\npools I saw a group of natives kneeling reverently. Ah, this would be\r\nsomething worth seeing; the primitive heart bowed down to some powerful\r\ngoddess of fire and water.... When I came closer I soon found what\r\nthey were doing. They were cooking yams.\r\n\r\nProbably they did say a little heathen prayer--if the missionary was\r\nnot looking. Unofficial paganism is the custom everywhere in the\r\nChristianized Pacific. In choosing my native assistants I usually\r\nrejected the mission-trained boys, who were too often slackers, liars\r\nand hypocrites. “Him Mission” meant “He’s a Christian,” and was a\r\nscornful term.\r\n\r\nI do not underrate the work of missionaries, the best of them; I have\r\nknown so many who tackled their problems cheerfully on the pittance\r\ndoled out by Foreign Boards. They had volunteered for a life so\r\nbitterly hard and so meagerly paid that it might easily have brought\r\nout something more petty than the helpful generosity which the best of\r\nthem showed me. But the days of the great missioners like Chalmers and\r\nBrown, who fought and died in the midst of ferocious savagery, have\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nThe man of God down there, when he went in for selfish profit, usually\r\nmade his investments in his wife’s name and took advantage of special\r\nconcessions allotted by the Government for legitimate mission work;\r\nor he used the funds from good Christian collection plates at home.\r\nProfessional traders had a right to complain of unfair competition in\r\nthe labor market, for the business-missions often secured labor for\r\nnothing under a forced system of “donating” work. Among the missions\r\nwhich “came clean” were the Catholics, who were accustomed to look to\r\nEurope for their support; but when 1914’s war came on that support was\r\ncut off. They faced the music manfully, and did their bit toward paying\r\ntheir own way. The fruits of this labor were turned back to the native,\r\nin the form of an intelligent attempt to better his condition. But too\r\noften the missionaries were wrapped in a dream of heavenly perfection,\r\nseeing nothing, hearing nothing, smelling nothing. It was refreshing to\r\nmeet an honest-minded one, who could be fair enough to rationalize his\r\nideals....\r\n\r\nOur cutter _Bomada_ had staged her terminal breakdown in one of the\r\nTrobriands’ divine lagoons which seemed to take its color from the\r\npearls that lay below. The _Bomada_, I felt, had killed every noble\r\nimpulse in my heart. Especially that rainy day when we tried to\r\nhoist sail and saw the rotten thing--which hadn’t been looked at for\r\ntwo years--fall to pieces in the first breeze. And now I was taking\r\nafternoon tea in the pleasant garden of a pleasant missionary. The\r\nprettily formed native girls who served us wore single garments, brief\r\nfiber skirts. The only shamed person present was the missionary’s\r\nwife, who kept chirping, “Isn’t it disgusting, Doctor!” Her husband,\r\nwho had entered the ministry from Oxford, had educated these people\r\nin cleanliness and right living. He had taught them many things that\r\nnatives must know in order to meet the perils of European civilization.\r\nOn purely scientific grounds he had opposed the missionary custom\r\n(encouraged by the traders) of dolling the women up in disease-breeding\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nI asked this sensible messenger of Christ, “How many converts, in our\r\nsense of the word, have you made here?” He rubbed his tired forehead\r\nand replied, “Doctor, not one in twenty years.” I honored him for that,\r\nand was willing to wager that he had won his way many times over a\r\n“civilizer.” He was human, and he knew humanity.\r\n\r\nHe was in refreshing contrast to at least one luxuriously living\r\nChristian who had entertained me in Samarai. He “instructed” the\r\nnatives in collecting nuts, cutting copra and building boats. His\r\nfine house and teeming acres revealed how well he had profited by his\r\ninstructions. If he had made any attempt to civilize the people, the\r\neffect was not apparent. Except in the case of the lone missionary who\r\nhonestly despaired of making converts, there seemed to be no attempt to\r\nteach the natives English.\r\n\r\nBut there must have been another exception once, for on a small\r\nTrobriand island a native boy addressed me primly: “Undoubtedly, sir,\r\nyou will find more clement weather for the remainder of your voyage.”\r\nStartled, I asked, “Where did you learn to talk like that?” The boy\r\nsaid, “My missionary taught me. Unfortunately he expired in an insane\r\nasylum. He had been irrational for quite a long time.”\r\n\r\nThe Trobriands, land of pearls and parrots, were romantic. The fertile\r\nsoil put the rest of Papua to shame and the delightful lagoons abounded\r\nin fish and oysters--also sharks. I shall not compete with ten\r\nthousand travelogue-poets in describing lagoons, but I never went in\r\nan outrigger over one of these beautiful sheets of crystal without a\r\nfeeling of complete rest and detachment.\r\n\r\nHowever, when you go on medical inspection you had best leave romance\r\noutside. I wish that a crew of Jack London’s admirers had followed me\r\nthrough the local hospitals and seen the cases of venereal granuloma,\r\na disease still called “tropical.” I wish they had helped me count\r\nthe cases of hospitalized gonorrhea, and helped me guess at the\r\nprevalence of that disease in villages and on plantations. I have heard\r\nsentimentalists say that the islanders are morally like ancient Greeks.\r\nPerhaps. But when Greek meets Greek, see what the doctor sees.\r\n\r\nDr. Bellamy, the District Medical Officer, took me over to look at\r\nthe wreck of a sturdy Scot, once a wealthy pearl trader. When hard\r\nluck came with tropical ulcers he had squatted in one position so long\r\nthat his joints ankylosed, and he was now unable to move except on all\r\nfours. An un-Scottish generosity had been the cause of his downfall.\r\nBecause he had married a native wife and had several children, he\r\nthought of the natives as his own people. When famine came, he gave\r\neverything he had to relieve hunger. White friends warned him of native\r\ningratitude, but it was too late. Sick and useless, he didn’t notice\r\nhow his wife and children sneered when they passed him. He had taken to\r\nchewing betel-nuts because they were a cheaper anodyne than gin. A look\r\ninto his eye-sockets made me ashamed of my race.\r\n\r\nIn the Trobriands, the pearl was the beautiful breeder of disease and\r\ncrime. Every trading store had pearls to sell, and French buyers from\r\nParisian jewelry firms came every year to bargain. The Government\r\nprotected native fishers from the traders’ rapacity; most of the\r\nstories of greed and treachery had white men or half-castes as\r\nprincipal actors.\r\n\r\nThere was the one about the Britisher who married an extremely pretty\r\nhalf-caste and had a collection of pearls ready to show the Parisians.\r\nHis little wife, who was French on the white side, was extremely fond\r\nof the short, tight-waisted corsets then in style. After her husband\r\nfound that she had flaunted that corset up and down the beach to\r\nthe gratification of many, he did what white men too often do there\r\nunder strain. He shot himself. His wife disappeared; so did his\r\npearls. A couple of years later the authorities found her in Sydney,\r\nliving rather too well. But oh, what an innocent little lady! She had\r\ninherited the money, and what were they accusing a poor, sick widow of\r\ndoing? A Sherlock Holmes could have told her how she had sneaked into\r\nthe house right after the suicide, hidden some rich double handfuls\r\ninside her corset, and flitted away. The case was dropped; after all,\r\nshe was the man’s legitimate widow.\r\n\r\nI summed up this trip with a line or two in my notebook:--\r\n\r\n Trobriands rich prize for trade. Hence heavily diseased. Am feeling\r\n much better, letting up on quinine. If I had not stuck to regular\r\n dosage feel sure that I would have died.\r\n\r\nTo economize on my budget I paid Skipper Billy Carson of the _Ruby_\r\nenough fuel to take me back to Samarai. When we came up from the beach\r\nthe Widow Henderson’s barroom piano was thrashing out a music hall\r\nditty, and an American voice in the doorway said, “Hello, Doctor! Gee,\r\nit _is_ the Doctor! I was just telling the guy in there that you’d\r\nforgotten all about me. You _are_ going to take me along, aren’t you?”\r\n\r\nI caught young Byron Beach’s enthusiasm. I was well again, resolved\r\nthat when I got back to Port Moresby I’d go on with the Foundation for\r\nanother campaign, or a dozen. It was wonderful work after all, and I\r\nwasn’t going to let the tropics lick me.\r\n\r\nAfter a good supper I asked, “How many of us can sing?” They all could.\r\nWe were a male quartet with Beach’s pleasant voice to carry the air\r\nagainst Carson’s sad bass, my raw baritone and the squeaky tenor of the\r\nyoung man at the piano--he was the one Byron Beach called “the guy in\r\nthere.” “Guy” is sufficient name for him. Drink didn’t interfere with\r\nhis fingers on the keys, and he seemed to know the old standard tunes,\r\n“I’ve been working on the railroad,” “I was see-eee-ing Nelly home,”\r\nand “Farewell, my own true love.” We were happy as four men can be,\r\nmaking close harmony in the shadow of an admiring bar. It was late when\r\nthe guy at the piano banged a fist on the keys and muttered, “That’s\r\nenough.” We had been singing about any little girl being a nice little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nI asked Beach what was the matter with him. He said, “Back from the\r\nwar, living on booze. He’s really quite a nice guy.”\r\n\r\nThat night the guy shot himself, but his aim was ineffective. I took\r\ncare of him long enough to tell him that liquor is a poor substitute\r\nfor quinine. I heard later that he sobered up and married some little\r\ngirl who was a nice little girl. I like to record one story with a\r\nhappy ending. But Billy Carson, who sang bass for us, had a grimmer\r\nfinish. He had married a wealthy half-caste, and when he sent his\r\nchildren to Australia to be educated he had found that they were being\r\nset aside as “blackfellows.” One morning on Samarai wharf a loiterer\r\nfound a neat bundle of clothes. Billy was always methodical.\r\n\r\nIn our tidy Port Moresby bungalow, comforted by my dear wife, whom\r\nI had seen too little during my restless months in Papua, I told my\r\nsenior, Dr. Sawyer of the Foundation, that I would undertake a year’s\r\nsurvey of what some still called German New Guinea. Sawyer said,\r\n“Lambert, you’re certainly a hard man to kill!”\r\n\r\nMy farewell to Ahuia may supply a good finishing scene. Eloisa, like\r\nthe perfect housekeeper she is, always packed and unpacked my boxes in\r\nhis presence. She would give him the keys; when we returned from the\r\nfield he would hand them over to her for inspection. On this day of\r\nparting the boy was proud as a chancellor, delivering the keys. How\r\ncould anything be missing? Hadn’t he served the best doctors in Papua\r\nand acted as the Governor’s orderly? And when he started out on his\r\nexpeditions with me hadn’t he stopped his ears against the wail of his\r\nfriends, howling that he’d never come back alive?\r\n\r\nCounting the wash, Eloisa giggled. Mine was all there, plus many\r\nunidentified shirts, socks, shorts and singlets. It was hardly worth\r\nwhile asking him the names of various hosts he had borrowed them from.\r\nAhuia had conveniently forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about to depart with my bonus of cash and tobacco he\r\nmaintained his fierce expression, but there were tears in his eyes.\r\nMelanesians weep rather easily. Could he serve the _taubada_ again? He\r\nwould so like to serve the _taubada_ if he came back....\r\n\r\nI was a little rough, pushing him out of the place. I didn’t want him\r\nto see that white men can also weep. I would miss Ahuia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo ended the Papuan chapter, with a few hard figures. I had covered\r\n2,284 miles on foot and horse, in motor cars, canoes, whaleboats,\r\nsailing boats, motor launches and steamers. Fourteen miles of it I\r\nhad done in the quaint vehicles they call “track cars,” iron-wheeled\r\nbone-breakers pushed by cannibal labor. With my inspectors we had\r\ncovered 8,461 miles. Nor did my official report include the few miles\r\nwe swam when our canoes heeled over. In villages and plantations we had\r\nexamined people by tens of thousands. We had marked down a grand total\r\nof 59.2 per cent infection. We had upset an old theory that hookworm is\r\ncarried from the plantations into the villages; our survey had gone to\r\nprove that quite the reverse was true.\r\n\r\nThe Papuan people by the Government’s reckoning of 1920-21 had been\r\nroughly estimated at 300,000. More likely, in the light of what a few\r\nexplorers had found among the lost mountains, the population figures\r\nshould have run nearer 500,000. The estimate of 166,721 for New Guinea\r\nTerritory was ridiculously low; it was more reasonable to put it\r\naround the half million mark. The immense Dutch end of the island held\r\nsomething like a million more; but Dutch New Guinea was outside my\r\nitinerary.\r\n\r\nThe tens of thousands we inspected and the thousands to whom we gave\r\nfirst treatment may be just a splash in a huge puddle of disease. But\r\nthe very careful instruction in treatment which we offered to planters,\r\nofficials and missionaries (in fact to everybody whose heart was in\r\nthe work of bringing back a failing population) might have been more\r\nimportant than anything else we did. I hope so. Month after month we\r\nhad been hammering into the white man’s head the grave necessity for\r\npollution-proof sanitary arrangements under conditions which varied\r\nbetween mushy swamp soil and solid rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWHERE NEW GUINEA WAS NEW\r\n\r\n\r\nRounding the northern edge of the great island you come upon the\r\nTerritory of New Guinea, which was German New Guinea until 1914, when\r\nAustralia took it over. To simplify the confusion in a few words: the\r\neastern half of the island is Australian-governed, divided into Papua\r\nand the Territory. The western half (roughly half) is Dutch New Guinea.\r\nThat was how the land lay in 1921. Perhaps the horrors of the Second\r\nWorld War will change its geography again.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1921, when I boarded the _Melusia_, bound for Rabaul, the\r\ncapital, our decks and cabins were thronged with seventy officials\r\nof the civil government, coming in to relieve a military government\r\nof evil repute. The newcomers were centered by the Administrator,\r\nBrigadier-General Evan Alexander Wisdom, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., V.D.,\r\nwhom his King later adorned with an added set of initials and a\r\nknighthood. Despite this alphabet train, General Wisdom had a character\r\nthat went well with his name. He was an Australian Scot, veteran of\r\nGallipoli and the French campaign. I felt that he was a man who could\r\nlisten to reason and exercise his own. He needed all he had, for he was\r\nsetting out to face a tangle which would have confused King Solomon.\r\n\r\nThe physicians he had brought with him for public health work were\r\ncompetently educated men, but inexperienced in tropical diseases.\r\nColonel Honman, the new Chief Medical Officer, was another Aussie-Scot\r\nI didn’t forget in a day. A hard-crusted, soft-hearted old regular, all\r\nhe knew about tropical medicine was what he had learned as personal\r\nphysician to Prime Minister Billy Hughes. He wasn’t afraid of liquor or\r\nanything else. For seven months I was to be very close to Honman, and\r\nto love him for his contradictory qualities.\r\n\r\nAboard ship I had no sooner met him than he suggested that I give\r\nthem a talk on malaria. I felt that here on the _Melusia_ it might be\r\nof service to the incoming officials. That night they gathered on the\r\nmain deck and I told them of my experiences with the disease. How the\r\n_Anopheles punctulatus_, whose female is more deadly than the male,\r\ntravels in the Pacific with mankind in his restless journeying from\r\nvillage to village, from island to island. How I had run my fingers\r\nunder the lower ribs of thousands of natives and felt the sagging\r\nspleen which tells the tale. I went into a subject which the medical\r\nmen present knew as well as I did--through book knowledge: blackwater\r\nfever. This quickly fatal disease gets its name from the dark\r\ncoloration of bloody urine, caused by the oxidization of hemoglobin,\r\nand the bladder condition is called hemoglobinuria.\r\n\r\nI had found very few cases of genuine blackwater fever, I told them.\r\nEven when it occurs the patient is often dead before diagnosis. The\r\ncondition, when it comes, is frequently caused by a blind misuse of\r\nquinine. Malarial people sometimes neglect the remedy for a couple\r\nof months, then swallow a handful. And here I tried to drive home\r\nmy favorite point. I even had the temerity to quote a German; the\r\nworld-renowned Dr. Robert Koch had come to New Guinea in 1910 and\r\nproved, for the first time in medical history, that epidemic malaria\r\ncan be reduced by _quinine alone_. Here I took my chance to say that in\r\nfever-bitten countries quinine in regular moderate doses is an absolute\r\nnecessity. Liquor is no substitute. If you abuse your constitution with\r\na daily dozen bottles of beer or a habitual quart of whisky, don’t cry\r\n“blackwater fever.” A white man in the tropics can remain as healthy as\r\nin the temperate zones, provided he exercises and takes care of himself.\r\n\r\nWasn’t it Kate Douglas Wiggin who said, “It is hard to be agreeable\r\nand instructive at the same time”? However, most of the medical men\r\nseemed to like the talk. I heard one District Officer for the Admiralty\r\nsaying, “This quinine business is all bloody nonsense.” Perhaps I had\r\ngone afoul of his prejudice. You can’t talk quinine without arousing\r\nsome bitter criticisms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Papua’s bleak capital I found Rabaul a picture of\r\ntropical delight: regular streets were bordered with poinciana, royal\r\npalms, coconut palms; betel-nut palms raised graceful, slender stems\r\nand flaunted their feathery tops just above clusters of fruit that\r\nwere like hothouse grapes; Indian laurels loomed graciously over\r\nthriving fig trees. The Germans had drained all this land, relieved it\r\nof mosquitoes, planted the groves; they had set Government House on a\r\nfine eminence overlooking a stretch of water that might have been a\r\nScottish lake.\r\n\r\nRabaul was an extremely shaky Garden of Eden, geologically and\r\npolitically. Jolly earthquakes came and went with seismic whimsicality,\r\nand were so frequent that every hotel, house and office had its heavy\r\nfurniture lashed to the walls. Otherwise, one might have waked up any\r\nmorning and found a large German wardrobe in one’s lap. Right inside\r\nRabaul’s port, Vulcan Island was a particularly bad actor. The Reverend\r\nGeorge Brown, the fighting missionary, records its beginning back in\r\n1878 when it blew the twenty-mile channel full of pumice; thousands\r\nof boiled fish were washed ashore, and great sea turtles with their\r\ntortoise-shell cooked to a pulp. The next big show was in 1937, when\r\nVulcan covered the town with ashy vomit; after that there was talk of\r\nmoving the capital, but the colonial becomes a fatalist. He has to be.\r\n\r\nOne morning in 1921 I saw some lumber that had been piled on Vulcan\r\ngo scattering into the sea like a box of matches, and I saw the huge\r\nsheet-iron D.H. & P.G. store curl like a withered leaf. After that\r\nEloisa and I agreed that at the next tremor we’d pick up little\r\nHarriette and make for the hills.... And let’s not forget two very\r\nwicked “Shaker ladies,” two tall peaks about three miles from town on\r\nthe mainland, and officially named Mother and Daughter. On the night\r\nof Vulcan’s birth there was a volcanic growl at the mouth of the Bay,\r\nand in the morning Vulcan loomed from the sea, shoved 600 feet from the\r\nwater and venomous as a newborn cobra. Vulcan is now popularly known as\r\n“The Bastard,” and so he will be called until he takes a notion to sink\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhere Papua with her probable 500,000 natives had five official\r\nmedical men, New Guinea Territory, equally populous, had eight or\r\nten government doctors to serve it. The hospital at Rabaul I found\r\nespecially well equipped, thanks to a retired German medical staff. The\r\nAustralians had adopted a German expedient. Well-trained orderlies,\r\nunder the supervision of medical officers, were sent out to run the\r\nlesser hospitals. These orderlies were called “_lik-lik_ doctors” or\r\n“small doctors”--_lik-lik_ means “little.” They had a high sense of\r\nduty and were remarkably competent. When I was there the natives were\r\nbeing trained simply in bandaging, treating sores and administering\r\nphysic; then they were given a uniform cap and _lavalava_ and sent back\r\nto their villages to apply their useful knowledge. They had the title\r\nof “Tultul” and their salary was a pound or so a year.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Tultul was a modest beginning in an important system that\r\nwas destined to go on. I had studied the mind of the higher type\r\nMelanesian and had begun to see that he was far from a fool. I had\r\nwatched the work of my head boys in the field--men like Ahuia, for\r\ninstance. What except race prejudice stood in the way of their being\r\neducated in medicine and equipped to practise among their own people,\r\nwhose language and customs no white physician would ever understand?\r\n\r\nEven in those days I heard reports of the more progressive Fiji Islands\r\nwhere for a long time they had been giving a sketchy medical training\r\nto Melanesians. Most of the South Pacific received the idea with a\r\ncynical smile. In Papua I had broached the plan of sending out picked\r\nnatives, under the direction of laymen, to administer yaws and hookworm\r\ntreatments over a country so vast that the few white doctors were\r\nridiculously inadequate to cover it. This plan was later adopted. In\r\nthe Territory of New Guinea I had still better luck; crusty old Colonel\r\nHonman had sufficient faith in me to permit the experiment at once.\r\nThe black boys I chose and instructed in the administration of oil of\r\nchenopodium proved remarkably useful, considering the inadequacy of\r\ntheir training.\r\n\r\nConditions we had to meet were similar to those in Papua, only the\r\npeople were far nearer to the Stone Age than were most of the Papuan\r\nnatives. Cannibalism was still practised within forty miles of Rabaul.\r\nWe had to move cautiously out in the bush, but we never carried\r\nfirearms--with the exception of Chris Kendrick, who faced one or two\r\nsituations where a pistol proved a very useful tool.\r\n\r\nNew Guinea Territory, in fact, was at that time harder to deal with\r\nthan it was before the abrupt political change of 1914. The coastal\r\nnative, more sophisticated than his brother of the jungle, was dumbly\r\nwondering what had become of the Germans, who had ruled them well, all\r\nthings considered. Natives had been servants of the padroons, and had\r\nlearned to like them. And what was this new set of white men with a\r\nnew set of laws which they seemed unable to enforce?\r\n\r\nThe military administration, which came in with the first World War\r\nand lasted for seven years, was a great political blunder, as the\r\nbest minds of Australia knew from the first; but what could be done\r\nabout it until Billy Hughes’s home Government decided on something\r\nless fantastic? The whole business had the nasty look of any sudden\r\npolitical overturn.\r\n\r\nLong before 1885, when the Kaiser’s Government officially occupied\r\nGerman New Guinea, his thrifty subjects had been working the\r\nplantations. This was no pumped-up Sudetenland, for the Germans were\r\nhonestly in control. They were good planters who studied the soil under\r\ntropical conditions on this favored side of the big island. Their\r\ncolonial treasury showed a surplus; they had increased their acres and\r\nbecome rich padroons; they lived luxuriously. Their Governor’s Palace\r\nat Rabaul (which the new military administration seized) was a fine\r\nexample of tropical architecture. Out of a fever-ridden swamp they had\r\nmade a Rabaul that was malaria-free.\r\n\r\nIn our time Germany has committed so many crimes against civilization\r\nthat a crime against Germany may be worth putting on record. Its\r\ncriminality reacted on all concerned, and especially on hordes of young\r\nwar veterans whom the Australian Government “rewarded” with free grants\r\nof land.\r\n\r\nI was settled in Rabaul and enjoying the generous privileges which\r\nColonel Honman gave me in the fine German-made hospital when I learned\r\nsome details of that military occupation, which a hard working civil\r\nadministration was by now trying to live down. Everybody was talking\r\nabout a scandal which compared with our own postbellum days in the\r\nSouth. Field-tried old soldiers were referring with scorn to the\r\n“Coconut Anzacs” whom Australia, for lack of better men, had sent to\r\ntake possession in 1914. The Coconut Anzacs seemed to have been mostly\r\nmen who hadn’t gone to the real war, for one reason or another--raw\r\namateurs without the slightest sense of discipline. Military power\r\ninspired many to wanton acts of cruelty and the stupidest sort of\r\nblunders.\r\n\r\nMy daring young man Byron Beach was eyewitness to one outrage. He\r\npresented himself as a medical officer to a punitive expedition,\r\nand was taken along. A company of Coconut Anzacs had been sent\r\nout to chasten a native village, accused of cannibalism. Led by\r\na hard-drinking officer, himself frightened of the poor, scared\r\ncannibals, the troops surrounded a certain inland village to teach\r\nthe black beggars a lesson. Maybe they were pretty drunk when they\r\nproceeded to shoot up everything they saw. Men were shot as they ran,\r\nwomen and children were gunned out of trees. Beach saw the leader of\r\nthe party put a pistol to the head of a girl who lay flat on the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd next day the commanding officer found that he had made a little\r\nmistake. He had attacked the wrong village.\r\n\r\nAnother expedition went to see about a German anthropologist who lived\r\nalone in the bush. He had been there for years and had a way of locking\r\nhis books and papers in the little house and going away on tours of\r\nresearch. When war was declared he was so far away from his home base\r\nthat he didn’t hear the news. In his absence the frenzied patriots\r\nbroke down his door, found great stacks of carefully written papers and\r\nmade a bonfire of them. They didn’t understand German, and the writing\r\nlooked like spy stuff. On his return the scientist found his lifework\r\nreduced to ashes. They say he went crazy.\r\n\r\nMaybe the new civil government was too bitter, looking over the\r\nmischief the military administration had wrought. There had been a\r\ngreat deal of aimless sabotage. For instance, they had demolished the\r\napparatus in the great radio station. The excuse was that it might be\r\nsending messages to Berlin. It hadn’t occurred to the conquerors that\r\nthey might save these costly things for their own use.\r\n\r\nNow what to do with the German planters? Prime Minister Hughes’s\r\nTerritorial Government was taking care of that. When I established\r\nmyself at Rabaul in 1921 the farce was in full swing, and through\r\nno fault of Governor Wisdom’s, who had to make the best of a policy\r\nalready framed. The policy was starkly this: Encourage the thrifty\r\nGermans to improve their land with the promise that they might retain\r\nit. In 1921 something called an Expropriation Board arrived, called in\r\nthe anxious Germans, and gave them vouchers enabling them to sell their\r\nproperty back to the Territory, at their own valuation. But when the\r\nGermans turned in these vouchers the Territory’s Treasury Department\r\npaid for them in orders on the German Government--to be applied on\r\nAustralia’s reparations claim!\r\n\r\nBankrupt Germans were selling their household goods for anything\r\nthey could get. During my stay in New Guinea it was a commonplace\r\nto see vessels departing for Australia, laden with pictures, rugs,\r\nsilverware. Returning ships were bringing back the same old load:\r\nhard liquor and fresh contingents of war veterans to stray into the\r\nplantations, sicken and go home.\r\n\r\nLiquor and malaria, malaria and liquor--a vicious circle to worry the\r\npublic health physician. These brave soldiers, who never wanted to hear\r\nthe word “war” again, were taking Billy Hughes’s advice: “Just go to\r\nNew Guinea and pick out a fine plantation.” They didn’t know how to\r\neat, drink or live in the tropics. There were many stories, funny and\r\nsad. One returned soldier was blithely dumped on the beach and sent to\r\nthe wilds with nothing more substantial than a case of tinned beef, a\r\ncase of mixed pickles and six cases of beer. Babes in the wood, what\r\ndid they know about malaria? Men who should have known said to them,\r\n“Shaky in the morning? Then scoff off a tot of whisky or a bottle\r\nof beer, and you’ll feel fit as a fiddle.” Green as grass, the poor\r\nfellows thought that coconuts grew underground like potatoes or on\r\nvines like grapes. They starved, they drank, they let the natives take\r\nadvantage of their ignorance. They swallowed the popular “fever cure”\r\nand finally tottered back to the returning ship--if they could.\r\n\r\nI looked over the annual import of alcoholic beverages--beer 102,204\r\ngallons, spirits 7,534 gallons, wines 1,500 gallons, stout 1,056\r\ngallons. This was to serve a European population totaling 1,265. The\r\nnatives didn’t drink, and you must discount the women, children and\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was hardly established in Rabaul when Colonel Honman began urging\r\nme to take full charge of the hospital. That was a flattering offer,\r\nwhich I at first declined. Between my medical units and myself, we had\r\nto make some sense out of the half million neglected natives we had\r\ncome there to study. But I shall never forget the grand old Colonel’s\r\nmorning calls at my house. A soldier to the bone, he never complained,\r\nbut I could see that he was suffering from “New Guinea fever”--in\r\nshort, he needed a pick-me-up. It was a habit of my neighbors to borrow\r\na bottle of whisky in the morning, return it at noon, and borrow it\r\nagain at night. But Colonel Honman always drank his tonic on the\r\nspot. Without a word I would administer the usual dose, a drinking\r\nglass filled one third with gin and the other two thirds with French\r\nand Italian vermouth. Straight as a ramrod he’d toss it off, smack\r\nsatisfied lips over his double row of false teeth, and bellow, “We\r\nbreed men in Australia!”\r\n\r\nHe had a leather stomach, a golden heart and a head that nothing seemed\r\nto affect. Already we were sympathizing with Governor Wisdom’s job,\r\nfor he was breaking up a racket which was as crude as any invented by\r\nBrooklyn union leaders. It was the bird of paradise racket--which may\r\nsound fantastic, but it was there, and had been ever since the military\r\nadministration did its worst for New Guinea. In German days it had been\r\ncustomary for newcomers to shoot and sell enough birds to earn the\r\nprice of a plantation. But the new Territorial Government passed a law\r\nto protect the birds. Like all prohibitions this invited bootleggers\r\nwho, like all bootleggers, were followed by highjackers. It was so\r\neasy to make a rich kill and pass it across the Dutch border, where\r\nthere were no game-protection laws!--and very convenient for a Chinese\r\ntrader to wait on the Dutch side and pay cash for the bag. Or you\r\ncould smuggle the feathered pelts into the hands of a ship’s steward.\r\nStewards were getting rich; one of them was able to run thoroughbreds\r\non the track.\r\n\r\nDistrict Officers were up to their necks in poaching. One of them came\r\nback from the Dutch border with £10,000 in his pocket. He started\r\nfor Sydney, fell ill on the boat and had to be taken off at Cairns.\r\nA sympathetic friend offered to take the easy money to the invalid’s\r\nfamily. The “friend” was a highjacker, of course, and had arranged a\r\nclever get-away. The poacher died in the hospital.\r\n\r\nDistrict Officers had been up to many things never dreamed of in the\r\nphilosophy of Tammany Hall. One of them revived “blackbirding,” the\r\nold-time slavery. He got a little island offshore, made raids on\r\nnatives, stored his prisoners there and proceeded to sell them in job\r\nlots. When this human meat ran short through brisk sales the official\r\nused his police authority and arrested a lot more. Several succeeding\r\nDistrict Officers went in for this thriving trade. The military\r\nadministration tried to break it up. There were some records, for the\r\nKeop (District Officer) always made the deals look very legal. But when\r\nthe Military Governor demanded these records, a handy filing clerk\r\nconfessed that they had been mislaid.\r\n\r\nThese abuses were on the wane when Wisdom stepped in, but, even so, he\r\nhad inherited a pretty kettle of fish. Colonel Honman’s principal worry\r\nwas a lack of doctors who knew anything about tropical medicine. If I\r\ndidn’t take over the hospital, he said, he’d have to draft my services.\r\nWell, he did finally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy right and left hands, Bill Tully and Chris Kendrick, were still\r\nwith me. Without those two I could never have got through Melanesia.\r\nAs laboratory assistant Bill used his fine eyes at the microscope,\r\nto supplement my dull ones. I had Kenny Fooks too, always good for a\r\nbarefoot excursion into the swamps, gifted with a constitution that\r\nkept him plump through months of hardship. And there was young Byron\r\nBeach, an erratic fund of energy. I had picked up two new inspectors,\r\nvery competent men, whom I had sent out with the other field units. I\r\ntook out a unit of my own. Between us, we swept north and east over the\r\nbig hook formed by New Britain and New Ireland; we traveled west under\r\nthe Equator to Manus and the Admiralty Group; west again to the string\r\nof flyspecks, Marou and Ninigo, Matty and Ana.\r\n\r\nChris Kendrick, through fat and lean--usually lean--remained his\r\nquiet, reliable self. After his long absences in the bogs and streams\r\nand jungles, he’d show up smiling and slap down his neatly written\r\nreports, pregnant with a Britisher’s genius for understatement. “Had\r\nto climb face of cliff. Waited between jumps till surf stopped pouring\r\nover it, then jumped again. Tricky business.” “Horse broke leg in\r\nvolcanic rock. Had to shoot him. Too bad, fine animal.” “Had to use\r\na lawyer-vine stick on black assistant. First time I ever struck\r\na native. The _lik-lik_ doctor here brought me a boy he said had\r\nberi-beri. It proved to be a champion hookworm case. In 5 days counted\r\n1,237 worms. Dosed him again in a week. Chenopodium very slow. Got only\r\n25 first dose. Second yielded 1,122. Score going up. Left assistant in\r\ncharge of patient, instructions to watch stools. When I got back I was\r\nannoyed to find that the idiot had thrown the whole mess away. Jungle\r\nhousekeeping. I might have recovered 4,000 worms.” This item gave me\r\na bitter laugh. Things like that have happened to us so often, with\r\nill-trained assistants.\r\n\r\nWhen Chris was with me in New Britain I saw him severely bitten--by\r\na parrot, pet of the Samoan wife of a German planter. Chris was busy\r\nmaking friends when the bird nipped him square across the nose. I\r\ntreated it, and Chris’s diary tersely records: “You never know what to\r\nexpect down here.”\r\n\r\nHe jotted down one item which a garrulous explorer might have turned\r\ninto a chapter, and a thrilling one:--\r\n\r\n Alone with native crew, big, sulky devils. Couldn’t understand\r\n trouble. Maybe short on food. They turned on me, with spears and\r\n paddles. Covered them with my service pistol, but was a bit nervy for\r\n fear 2 or 3 would get me from behind. Finally the D.O. showed up with\r\n police. It was rather tricky.\r\n\r\nOne day en route Kenny Fooks lost his temper and told a coastwise\r\nskipper what he thought of him. The skipper retaliated by dumping\r\nKenny off on a sort of desert island. Nothing to do for weeks but\r\ncount the sparse hookworms and write a weather report. Most of that\r\ndiary read: “June 14, weather fine.” “June 21, weather still fine.”\r\n“July 1, weather cloudy.” “July 9, raining like hell and glad of it.”\r\nMy other inspectors were more active, and I had to scold Byron Beach\r\noccasionally for his daredevil tendencies. But he was learning fast and\r\nhis young vitality made him a splendid worker. My new acquisitions were\r\nW. J. McErlane and R. V. Sunners. Fooks and Beach were later sent to\r\nthe mainland, and McErlane covered the field in Bougainville, an island\r\nfar to the east and formerly part of the Solomons. These men were not\r\nheard from for half a year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had been studying pidgin English for nearly a year, but had not\r\nreached the point where I could use it in my lectures, as I knew I\r\nmust. Until I had mastered the idiom I had to depend on a faithful\r\ninterpreter. Therefore I chose a very cross-eyed native named Jerope;\r\nI got him because nobody else in Rabaul seemed to want him. Jerope was\r\nso cross-eyed that when he poured my coffee I had to follow the spout\r\nwith my cup, otherwise he would have poured it in my lap. He was a bush\r\nfellow with none of Ahuia’s sophistication, and was obsessed by every\r\nwitch and devil that flies over the Pacific. Before I could take him\r\ninto the field he got himself arrested for stealing a red lantern off a\r\nsewer-digging in Rabaul. When the judge asked him what he wanted with a\r\nred lantern he blandly explained. He thought the white men had put them\r\non the streets so that natives could use them to scare off devils. For\r\neverybody knows that devils won’t attack a man with a lantern.\r\n\r\nJerope languished awhile in jail and improved his education. Because\r\nthe boy was brighter than the average the Keop who ruled the jail\r\nput him in charge of the bulla-ma-cows (cattle herd) and Jerope was\r\nfaithful to his trust. The day I called and accused him of milking the\r\ncows, his eyes crossed in great sadness when he replied, “No, master,\r\nhim no woman cow, him man cow.”\r\n\r\nJerope was not a mission boy; he despised their kind for a lot of\r\nsissies. Once when we were inspecting Ninigo away up in the northeast\r\nwe had with us a well-known English anthropologist, nephew of a great\r\none. Like the Catholic missionaries he had a soft voice and a full\r\nbeard. He was far too dainty. The Australians called him “Birdie”\r\nbecause he wore a feather in his Alpine hat. Birdie shrank from\r\ncold baths, so every morning he minced back and forth across the\r\ndeck, carrying a little bowl of hot water for his tub. Once when the\r\nbowl-bearing Birdie minced by, Jerope turned and spat into the sea.\r\n“Him mission!” he growled.\r\n\r\nFrom a medical point of view the Ninigo group was interesting. I\r\nmade a count of palpable spleens and found an index of 54 per cent;\r\nconsiderable malaria for so remote a spot. In fact this was about the\r\nsame proportion that I found among the assorted natives brought to the\r\nhospital in Rabaul. Hookworm, on the other hand, was only 8.4 per cent\r\nas against 74.2 for the whole Territory. Why? Because the group was\r\nmade up of narrow atolls, where the beaches were the latrines and the\r\ntide carried the infecting material away. Malaria and elephantiasis are\r\nboth mosquito diseases (if you can call elephantiasis a disease--it is\r\nmerely a symptom of filarial infection). On one of the islands here I\r\nsaw a woman’s breasts so enlarged that when she sat they touched the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nNinigo might serve as a type example of a region with no protection\r\nagainst the insect carriers that are today scattering plague among all\r\nthe sons of Adam. Rapid transit, open ports, borders wide open.... It’s\r\nthe same old story, to us of the Health Service.\r\n\r\nDo you remember the alarm of ten years ago--how our most modern\r\ninstrument of speed, the airplane, had carried the deadly _Anopheles\r\ngambiae_ from Natal in Africa across to Brazil? Brazil was too busy\r\nwith a revolution to fool with mosquitoes until three or four years\r\nlater when death-without-bullets felled the population in wet areas.\r\nFortunately the infection reached a comparatively dry belt, so that the\r\nmosquitoes were slowed up. Then Brazil joined with the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation in a gigantic campaign. In 1939 a million dollars was spent\r\ndown there, and this year they expect to double that sum in an attempt\r\nto check the scourge before it spreads, heaven knows how far....\r\n\r\nDr. Marshall Barber, the great authority on malaria, says: “There is\r\nno doubt that this invasion of _gambiae_ threatens the Americas with a\r\ncatastrophe in comparison with which ordinary pestilence, conflagration\r\nor even war are but small and temporary calamities.” I have had no\r\nexperience with the _gambiae_ in my corner of the tropics: but I am\r\nusing him as a bogie to make a point. How tropical are “tropical\r\ndiseases”? Germs and worms love to visit around. The northern-born\r\ninfluenza has swept away thousands in the South Pacific; neglected,\r\nits germ may bide its time for a plunge back into the North. Amoebic\r\ndysentery is a “tropical disease”--yes, and a few years ago it appeared\r\nin Chicago. The distinctly tropical filariasis (often manifested in\r\nelephantiasis) has been identified in several cases in an incomplete\r\nsurvey of the Carolinas. Dr. Boyd, investigating in Florida, asserted\r\nthat our temperate-climate mosquito can carry a tropical strain of\r\nmalaria. I saw how inguinal (venereal) granuloma spread from island to\r\nisland in the Pacific; recently I was not surprised to hear of cases in\r\nthe United States. Leprosy, which curses the Polynesian, was brought to\r\nhim by the oriental; the Polynesian may pass it around--there is plenty\r\nof it in New York today. The white man gave tuberculosis to the black\r\nSolomon Islander, who awaits an opportunity to return the generous gift.\r\n\r\nA few millions of Rockefeller dollars, a few hundreds of Rockefeller\r\nscientists, have gone forth into the seed-beds of disease, to work\r\nand study, and cure, if possible. I say this for the benefit of smug\r\nstay-at-homes who ask us, “Why do you waste your time and money on\r\nthese niggers, who live in another world from ours?” Yes, but do they?\r\nOur little planet is moving faster every day. If sanitarians go on\r\nbungling their way through bogs and forests and mountains, maybe it is\r\nto save you from a peck of trouble some fine morning, Mr. Homebody. Or\r\nat least we can wave the danger flag.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Kaiser’s day, I was told, the German planters sent to Ninigo to\r\nreplenish their harems. Certainly the people were terribly thinned out.\r\nI found an island where they were reduced to thirteen, one girl and\r\ntwelve men; and all eaten with venereal granuloma. The Hermit Islands\r\nhad lost their hermit; a friendly planter had taken off the last\r\ninhabitant, a healthy young fellow who became a personal servant, too\r\ngentle to meet the invasion.\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty Group is north of the mainland, under the Equator. Manus,\r\na fairly large island, is the center of a wealth of little dots. Some\r\nvillages here were built over water in the Venetian style of Gaile.\r\nParadoxically, the women were chaste, domestically speaking, yet in\r\nManus I found the only public prostitution I ever saw in the South\r\nPacific. It was an ancient custom here. Discouraged by the Germans, it\r\nhad come back under the military administration. The incoming civil\r\nadministration crushed it for a while; but when I was there the custom\r\nwas flourishing again.\r\n\r\nManus had a certain Gaile-like charm, especially noticeable in the\r\nhouses. Your canoe entered in the front through a covered opening, so\r\nlow and narrow that once in you had to crawl on hands and knees. The\r\nobject of this was simple and practical; if you were an enemy you could\r\nbe conveniently clubbed as you poked your head into the living room.\r\nThe houses set aside for young girls were quaint, too. With almost\r\nSpanish sternness the maidens were watched over by local duennas, and\r\nwere carefully caged to the age of puberty. After sunset they were\r\npermitted to take the air, still under guard. At first I thought that\r\nthis was the Manus method of preserving chastity; then I found that it\r\nwas a mere matter of complexion. Indoor living bleached the skin, and\r\nin Manus a pale young bride was quoted at rather a high figure.\r\n\r\nA weakness for canoes increased my fondness for this pretty Admiralty\r\nGroup. I snatched every minute to drop my trouble in the serenity\r\nof bright lagoons; great Manus outriggers were wide enough to hold\r\ncomfortable deckhouses below their coco sails.\r\n\r\nContrast this lagoon-bound holiday with my return trip on the cutter\r\n_Siar_, a capable craft with a capable captain; Skipper Bell was the\r\nbest of the Australian type, raw-boned, handsome, brave. We had reached\r\nthe New Hanover Group when a hurricane came down on us with a sudden\r\nferocity that seemed to bring sea and sky together. That we stayed\r\nafloat those three mad days is one of God’s mercies. Our engine was\r\ndrowned out, we lost all sense of direction, all sense of everything\r\nexcept what was needed to hang on and pray--or swear. When a calm\r\ncame, almost as violently sudden as the storm, we found that we had\r\ndrifted over reefs and banks and heaven knows what--we had been blown\r\nclean around the large island of New Hanover and were lying in an inlet\r\nbetween it and New Ireland, which we had passed three days before.\r\nThere wasn’t a dry thing on the boat; our cookstove had been doused\r\nwith the first wave that swept over us.\r\n\r\nI have been caught in more tropical storms than I can remember, but\r\nthis was the worst. With quaking Jerope and such of my gear as I had\r\nrecovered I went ashore and flagged a schooner bound for Rabaul. Bell\r\nand his staunch little ship deserved a better fate than that which\r\nlater overtook them. The battered _Siar_ was towed to Sydney, where she\r\nfell a-prey to a favorite island trick: the calkers stopped the leaks\r\nwith concrete, to save the expense of honest calking. On the return\r\nvoyage she struck another storm and went down like a flatiron--with\r\npoor Bell at the wheel. He was a fine, clean young man who adored his\r\npretty new bride. Well, he was one of the many.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy American medicine frequently competed with native witchcraft,\r\nwhich though it was never an open challenge, was something I felt all\r\naround me. Here and there I would catch whispers of this and that\r\nlaborer who had sickened and died in the field; some _puri-puri_ doctor\r\nhad “pointed a bone” at him. Belief in magic, black and white, had\r\npenetrated into some odd places.\r\n\r\nThere’s an elegant little chain of islands off New Britain which\r\nold-timers called “Queen Emma’s Kingdom.” Emma was a self-made queen,\r\nthe half-caste Polynesian daughter of an American consul. She bought a\r\ndomain for a few guineas and made a prince consort out of the German\r\nnobleman she married. Her descendants were educated in European\r\nschools, married Europeans of good family, and came home to enjoy their\r\nshare in the inherited kingdom. I talked with one of these descendants,\r\na lady who knew Wagnerian opera and Ibsen plays. When it came to\r\nmedicine her faith was all bound up in the old family witch doctor.\r\nEarnestly she told me about some herbs which worked the medically\r\nimpossible. She was offended at my incredulous smile when I transposed\r\nfrom what Lincoln said of General Grant: “I’d like to know the bottle\r\nhe gets it from.”\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that cross-eyed Jerope was anxious to carry a lantern\r\nafter dark.\r\n\r\nOne evening we paused for rest on the tangled brow of a high mountain\r\nin New Britain. Incidentally, that had been a most interesting day;\r\nI had found rather puzzling evidence of modern sanitation. The tribe\r\nhere was fierce, savage, cannibalistic--and surprisingly free of\r\nintestinal parasites. At some risk I searched behind the village\r\nhouses and found latrines as scientifically constructed as if endorsed\r\nby the International Health Board! The pits were dug twenty-five to\r\nthirty feet into the soil, and over them was a support of timber. The\r\ndeposit fell so far underground that hookworm larvae had no opportunity\r\nto invade the surface. The common housefly, bearer of dysentery and\r\ntyphoid, dared not penetrate that dark well. Rude screens separated the\r\nmen’s latrine from the women’s. My compliments to the wise old witch\r\ndoctor who invented that.\r\n\r\nByron Beach had been to this mountain before me, with a punitive\r\nexpedition, armed to chasten man-eating. They had climbed 7,000 feet\r\nand had forced themselves among tribes that had never before looked\r\non a white face. Beach reported that every village he entered had\r\nbeen equipped with these deep cesspits. They were not mere archaic\r\nornaments, either; the people were using them.\r\n\r\nI tried to find out who had taught them, but all I got was “It is the\r\nfashion.” I had to remember what the immortal Captain Cook said of the\r\nNew Zealand Maoris when he first saw them--that this primitive people\r\nwere obeying sanitary laws when the housewives of Paris and Madrid were\r\nemptying chamber pots into the streets. It set me thinking. Was not the\r\nislander, before the whites came to unsettle his traditions, reasonably\r\nself-preserving in his daily habits? My visits to lost Rennell Island,\r\nsome years later, confirmed the theory.\r\n\r\nBut that evening, lolling on the mountain brow, I talked with Jerope\r\nabout dream magic and heard the beginning of a story which, when it was\r\nfinished, touched me deeply. I looked up and saw that his crossed eyes\r\nwere not funny any more.\r\n\r\nI had asked him if evil spirits could “walk along dreams” and curse\r\nyou while you were awake. Oh, yes, master, they could do that. But\r\ndevil-devils can do your dreams great favors, he said. He gazed\r\ncrookedly at the sunset and told me, quietly as you tell of a proposed\r\nsubway trip, how tonight in his dream he would visit his mother in the\r\nlittle local heaven. He explained the witch charm which would bring\r\nthis about. From a great magician, who had been to the Evil One’s home\r\non the wild Sepik River, Jerope had bought the skin of a great bat, the\r\nenchanted flying fox that could carry you into the land of the dead.\r\n“Tonight,” he said, “I shall burn the bat’s hairs and paint the ashes\r\non my eyes. Then I shall go.”\r\n\r\nNext morning I asked him if he had gone to his mother. Yes, he had\r\ngone; and he told me how, earnestly:--\r\n\r\n“Master, me fastem head belong bat close under head belong me, then rub\r\neye belong me along ashes and make fass (shut) eye belong me, and then\r\nme tink, and tink, and tink, then me like sleep....”\r\n\r\nJerope’s head had begun to whirl then--“Me all a same pidgeon.”\r\nThe flying fox became a swift-winging god. “He catch me allesame\r\npickaninny. Me hang on fass too much, then he go up and up and he go\r\nquick-feller too much. Him quick allesame nothing.\r\n\r\n“Bym-by me come along place where Mamma belong me stop; this one place\r\nbelong people who die finish.” Heaven was filled with Jerope’s dead\r\nkinsmen. “Master, this place he good feller too much. All man he got\r\ngood feller garden, good feller house, plenty dog, plenty pig. Mamma\r\nbelong me he come, he kiss me.” (Throughout he referred to Mamma as\r\n“he,” which is correct pidgin.) “Now me go inside along house belong\r\nhim. Mamma he got good feller house too much, and yam he big one\r\nallesame tree. Suppose altogether people along Heaven he like kaikai\r\nfish, he tink, dass all, and good feller fish he must come along\r\nsaucepan. Man dis place, Mamma dis place he no can work. Suppose Mamma\r\nlike ’em something; he tink, dass all, and altogether something he\r\ntink, he must come.... Dis heaven belong Mamma him good feller too\r\nmuch!”\r\n\r\nI made no attempt to deny anything, his whole tone was so convincing.\r\nHe hadn’t been dreaming; he had been there and seen a worn old woman\r\nhaving the fine rewards that come by wishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nI SAY IT IN PIDGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the time came when my vanity was tickled to the verge of\r\nhysteria; I had actually learned pidgin English. To the native English\r\nis pidgin, and if you do not speak it with classic exactitude he\r\nsimply fails to understand you. Once I had thought that I could pick\r\nit up in a week or two, it sounded so like laundry Chinese. Studying\r\nit, I learned how iron-bound its rules of idiom and grammar actually\r\nare. Twice, before I had mastered the lingo, I had tried it on native\r\naudiences and had been, as the actors say, laughed off the stage. But\r\nI was tired of having my lectures hashed by casual interpreters; I\r\nknew that I must talk straight to the people in the trade language\r\nwhich was common over the larger part of Melanesia. It took a year of\r\nhard grinding to learn it. Superior natives, kindly missionaries and\r\nDistrict Officers were my tutors.\r\n\r\nI must be fair to the reader and show him a few of the simpler twists\r\nin the language, and interpret a few peculiarities. Otherwise, the\r\nforthcoming sample of what became my standard pidgin hookworm lecture\r\nmight be difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nThe verb “go,” for instance. The future is “by-and-by me go,” and the\r\npast is “me go finish.” “Finish” is trickily used to express finality.\r\nWhen a boy is “dead finish” he is dead. When you bury a body you “plant\r\n’im finish.” (When a houseboy says he is “killed” it merely means that\r\nhis mistress has taken a stick to him.)\r\n\r\n“Him” is masculine, feminine or neuter, generally pronounced “im,”\r\nbut sometimes “um.” “Im” may be joined to a verb, as in “lookim,” or\r\nseparated as in “look im,” (“look at him”).\r\n\r\n“Fellow” or “feller” is another tricky one. “Feller” precedes almost\r\nevery noun--“One feller house,” and so on. “Me go three feller Sunday”\r\nmeans “I was gone three weeks.”\r\n\r\nA man is usually a “boy,” a woman a “mary.” But often, linguistically,\r\na man’s a “man,” for a’ that. The personal pronoun is always masculine:\r\n“Dis feller mary he go.” Repetition gives a verb an increasing value.\r\nWhen you say, “He go, go, go, _go_, GO,” that’s a long, tired journey.\r\nThen for effect you add, “long way too much.” “Too much” means “very.”\r\nExample: “Him good feller too much”--quite a compliment.\r\n\r\n“Senake” is “snake” or “worm,” and in hookworm lectures you refer to\r\nhatched larvae as “pickaninny senake.” “Gelass” is “glass,” and refers\r\nto a microscope, telescope or anything else with a lens in it.\r\n\r\nThe frequent use of “belong” (or “belonga”) is confusing, and “along”\r\nis worse. Loosely speaking, “belong” is possessive. “Knifie belong me”\r\nis “my knife” and about the only way to translate “Dis fellow knifie\r\nbelong dis fellow mary belong house belong Keop” would be “The knife of\r\nthe native woman who lives in the Captain’s house”--a pretty clumsy way\r\nof making your point. “Along” generally expresses movement or approach:\r\n“Ship stop along place.” On some remote islands, God is expressed by\r\n“Big Feller Walk along Top.”\r\n\r\n“Blut” is blood (German), and is combined with “sabe” (Spanish) in “You\r\naltogether fellow, you sabe string belong blut?” when you want to know\r\nif everybody understands the nature of the blood stream. “Altogether\r\nfellow” expresses “everybody.”\r\n\r\n“Kaikai” is “eat.” Your heart is a “pump,” your lungs “wind,” and when\r\nyou show a hookworm picture in your lecture the “illustration” is a\r\n“ficshure.”\r\n\r\nTheir use of “behind” doesn’t express much until you are informed that\r\nit may mean either “afterward” or “pretty soon.” “Behind me show you\r\ndis feller” equals “After I have shown you this.”\r\n\r\nTo the uninitiated, pure pidgin does not make the slightest sense.\r\nGerman priests have learned it--and naïvely used its Chaucerian\r\nobscenities--without knowing a word of English.\r\n\r\nIn giving you just a flash of my first public success with the\r\nlanguage, I assure you that I have anglicized it down to a point where\r\nthe pidgin-wise native would have a hard time making head or tail out\r\nof it. But head or tail would be lost to the reader if I gave the\r\nunedited version.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the native hospital at Rabaul and told Colonel\r\nHonman that I was prepared to lecture in pidgin, he gnashed pleasantly\r\nand said, “Try it on them.” Honman was behind me in everything now.\r\n\r\nA packed audience was gathered that night to hear my attempt at a new\r\nand dreadful language. I mopped cold sweat from my bald spot. Jerope\r\nhad hung the hookworm chart to a post; it was like nailing your flag to\r\nthe mast--fight or sink, no turning back. Assistants had passed around\r\nour two property bottles, pickled hookworms and ascarides. The natives\r\nalways admired the bottled ascarides most; they were larger and looked\r\nmore dangerous. The pause settled my stomach. My natural brazenness\r\nreturned and I bawled for order.\r\n\r\n“You altogether boy, you listen good. Me come talk along one big feller\r\nsick....”\r\n\r\nI felt the listening silence. They were taking in every word.\r\n\r\n“Altogether boy he got um plenty senake he stop along inside bell’\r\nbelong boy, he kaikai bell’, blut he come, he kaikai blut. Blut belong\r\nboy him kaikai belong senake.\r\n\r\n“Place belonga me him stop long way too much. You ketchum one feller\r\nsteamer, you go one feller Sunday, now you come up along Sydney. Now\r\nyou ketchum one feller steamer, big more (larger), now you go, go, go\r\nthree feller Sunday, now you come up along place belong me....”\r\n\r\nIn the native mind I had visualized the distance I had traveled\r\nfrom New York to New Guinea. And now for a word picture of John D.\r\nRockefeller, Senior:--\r\n\r\n“Master belonga me him make im altogether kerosene, him make im\r\naltogether benzine. Now he old feller. He got im plenty too much belong\r\nmoney. Money belong him allesame dirt. Now he old feller, close up him\r\nhe die finish. He look about. Him he tink, ‘Me like make im one feller\r\nsomething, he good feller belong altogether boy he buy im kerosene\r\nbelonga me.’ Now Gubment (Government) he talk along master belonga me.\r\nMaster belonga me him he talk, ‘You, you go killim altogether senake\r\nbelong bell’ belong boy belong island.’”\r\n\r\n(I passed around the bottle of pickled hookworms.)\r\n\r\n“Now, you boy, lookim good along dis feller bottle. Dis small feller\r\nsenake he bad feller too much.... He got im tooth belongim. He kaikai\r\nbell’ belong altogether boy. Blut he come he kaikai blut....”\r\n\r\n(Turning chart to enlargement of male and female hookworms.)\r\n\r\n“You look along dis feller ficshure. Two feller senake. You look;\r\none feller he man-senake, one feller him he mary-senake. Dis feller\r\nmary, him he bad feller too much. Him he stop along inside bell’; him\r\nhe kaikai blut; him he makim too much small feller egg. Boy he makim\r\nsomething along ground. Egg he come out. Dis egg he small feller too\r\nmuch....”\r\n\r\nOpen eyes and open mouths confronted me. And now to describe a\r\nmicroscope in pidgin English:--\r\n\r\n“He no allesame glass belong Keop (Captain) belong steamer--he nother\r\nkind. Glass belong Keop, he make one feller something he stop too\r\nfar, more big; glass belonga me, he make one feller something too\r\nsmall, more big. Behind (pretty soon) you sabe lookim along dis feller\r\nglass....”\r\n\r\n(Attentive eyes followed the microscope, and I told of the dropping of\r\nthe egg, the birth of the larva and its destiny....)\r\n\r\n“Now boy he make im something along ground, egg he come out. Rain\r\nhe come down. Egg, him he stop. Now sun he cookim. Now small feller\r\npickaninny (larva), close up he broke-im dis feller egg. Him, he\r\nwalkabout along ground, quick feller too much. You no sabe lookim--he\r\nsmall feller too much. Eye belonga you no good. Now boy he come. Him he\r\nputim foot belongim along ground. Now pickaninny senake him come inside\r\nfoot belong boy, quick feller too much. Boy he scratchim, but he no\r\ncan catchim dis feller senake. Now he go along string belong blut. Now\r\nhe go, he go, he go, he go go go go, now he come up along pump belong\r\nblut; now he come to wind; him he come up along troat; boy he kaikai\r\nhim....”\r\n\r\n(Pointing to internal organs outlined on the chart.)\r\n\r\n“Now he come along bell’ belong you, now he big feller little bit; now\r\nhe gettim tooth belong im; now he sabe kaikai bell’ belong boy; he sabe\r\nkaikai blut. Suppose you gottim plenty good kaikai--dis feller kaikai\r\nno belong you; him belong senake. You eatim, senake he catchim first\r\ntime....\r\n\r\n“Senake him kaikai blut belong boy, now boy he no strong; he weak\r\nfeller too much; him he no like walkabout; him he no like work; him he\r\nlike sleep all time.

Now quick time skin belong boy good, now he sabe walkabout, him\r\nhe strong feller too much....”\r\n\r\nWhen at last I had finished I heard the frightened sigh that fluttered\r\nthrough my audience. A heavy load seemed to fall from my shoulders. I\r\nhad said it in pidgin, I had made them understand!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis was the hookworm lecture which, with some improvements, I gave\r\nhundreds of times throughout Melanesia, wherever pidgin was spoken;\r\nin New Guinea, in the Solomon Islands, in the New Hebrides. Yes, and\r\nI took it to New York in 1922, and demonstrated it to the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation. When I was asked to address a body of extremely dignified\r\nscientific men, Dr. George Vincent encouraged me to repeat my hookworm\r\nlecture, for its fame seemed to have arrived before I did. “Give it to\r\nthem straight,” Dr. Heiser suggested when I took the platform. If my\r\nperformance added nothing to science, it was at least a comedy success.\r\nIt panicked ’em, as the actors say. When I came to the part that\r\ndescribed Mr. Rockefeller as “Master belonga me him make im altogether\r\nkerosene.... Now he old feller.... Money belong him allesame dirt,”\r\nsolemn scientists who hadn’t smiled for years had to be held up to keep\r\nthem from falling into the aisles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n“ME CUTTIM WIND, ME CUTTIM GUT!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest of pidgin cheered me up mightily; and I needed cheering.\r\nToward the close of the New Guinea campaign (October, 1921) I began to\r\nrealize more and more, through daily practice, that oil of chenopodium\r\nwas inadequate for the mighty job cut out for it. To do it justice,\r\nit did remove worms, quantities of them. The standard method of\r\nadministering chenopodium was to starve the patient the night before\r\nand give him a purge in preparation for next morning’s treatment,\r\nwhich was 15 minims, given at two-hour intervals, at 6 A.M., 8 A.M.\r\nand 10 A.M. This was followed by another purge at noon, and he was not\r\npermitted to eat until the purge had taken effect.\r\n\r\nIn North Queensland I had found that even these heroic measures had not\r\nreduced the rate of infection, because the people were not taking the\r\ndrug. Then I decreed that no treatment would count unless inspectors\r\nstood by and saw the medicine swallowed. In the early morning hours\r\none could get track of a treatment unit by the sight and sound of\r\nfront doors bursting open and children running wildly down the street.\r\nSo I decided to modify the dose by one half, followed by a purge.\r\nRe-examination showed somewhat better results.\r\n\r\nOld-timers who ran the standard chenopodium campaigns were unsung\r\nheroes, and the grinding disappointments drove many good men out\r\nof public health work. Examination, treatment, re-examination and\r\nretreatment--repeated half a dozen times in any given area--made up\r\na method so extremely slow that by the time work in one region was\r\ncompleted the unremoved female worms had again laid eggs inside our\r\npatients; eggs which fell with the excreta to infect the soil once more\r\nand permit another horde of larvae to crawl back to the human intestine.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Honman at last drafted my services and put me in charge\r\nof the native hospital at Rabaul, I was given an ideal chance to\r\nexperiment and observe. Groups of native patients were chosen and\r\nlocked behind barbed wire; each was given his dose and a gasoline can\r\nfor his stools. The latter were washed every twenty-four hours for\r\nthree days, and the worms counted. After an interval each man would\r\nbe given a very large dose to remove the remaining worms, so that a\r\npercentage of effectiveness of the first dose could be estimated.\r\nWe tried various combinations of chenopodium: thymol, betanaphthol,\r\neven betel-nut (which has a certain degree of vermifuge action). We\r\nstudied the relation of purge and drug, to find out on what ratio they\r\ncould be given. At best chenopodium was nauseous and produced many\r\nsevere symptoms like tingling toes, temporary deafness, vomiting; and\r\nthere was always the danger of profound poisoning inherent in the\r\npowerful drug,--untrained dispensers might grow careless and omit the\r\npurge,--and that might prove fatal.\r\n\r\nTo sum up chenopodium, it was about as popular as the Hammer and Sickle\r\nat a Republican rally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTaking charge of the native hospital, although it was added to my\r\nduties in the field, was the job I liked best of all I had--new things\r\nturning up every day, and plenty to swing to.\r\n\r\nI swung to Colonel Honman with ever increasing faith, for he was\r\nmy mainstay when it came to an argument with Governor Wisdom. The\r\nGovernor’s troubles were piling up on him, and I never blamed him for\r\nhis stubborn spells. If Wisdom’s moods interfered with urgent medical\r\nwork, it was the Colonel’s delight to set his artificial teeth firmly\r\nand jump into the scrimmage. He wasn’t afraid to go to the mat with the\r\nGovernor, and at the finish he usually came out winner. I cannot forget\r\nhis loyalty to me any more than I can forget a set of eccentricities\r\npeculiarly his own.\r\n\r\nHere is one of my favorite pictures of the Colonel in action. I was in\r\ncharge of quarantine while he was away, and always on the _qui vive_\r\nfor any alarm that might come in. Early one morning a disturbing cable\r\ncame: bubonic plague had broken out in Brisbane, and we must keep a\r\nstrict lookout for ships from that port. The Colonel was away, making\r\na trip around the group, so when the regular boat from Brisbane pulled\r\nin I went aboard and talked it over with a worried skipper. How was he\r\nto unload her? Certainly it would be inconvenient if he had to dump his\r\ncargo on lighters and move it piecemeal to the dock. I saw his point,\r\nand was wondering if I should take chances and let her come in before\r\ndark, when I saw the Medical Chiefs ship poking around the heads. I\r\nwent over to it and found the Colonel in his pajamas. I asked him what\r\nwe were supposed to do about the caller from Brisbane. He hadn’t put\r\nin his false teeth yet, and his mouth was sunken like a dead crater.\r\n“Keep her out in the thtream,” he lisped. So I carried the orders back\r\nto the Australian skipper, and went home to breakfast. But I said to my\r\nwife, “Eloisa, I’ll bet that ship will be alongside the wharf before\r\nnoon.” It was; and I knew why. Down in the Australian’s hold there was\r\na new Ford sedan for the Colonel, and he wasn’t going to risk having it\r\nunloaded on a lighter, away out in the stream.\r\n\r\nColonel Honman had his faults, but I grew to love and admire them, with\r\nthe firm belief that “even his failings leaned to virtue’s side.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had more and more cases of yaws sent in and were administering\r\nintravenous arsenicals. The natives called these injections “needla,”\r\nand it became a popular craze with them--a craze which spread over the\r\nSouth Pacific. It was better than magic; a native would gladly have\r\nanything poked under his skin through a needle, no matter what. In\r\nRabaul the native orderlies were always there on injection days; their\r\ntongues hung out with eagerness to get a shot of any salvarsan solution\r\nthat happened to be left over. I have heard them arguing, “Why waste\r\nthat bully stuff on a lot of ignorant bush fellows who are no good to\r\nanyone?” White men were queer in their preferences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe primitive Melanesians have a holy horror of mutilation--except when\r\nthey mutilate their noses for decorative purposes, or their foreskins\r\nfrom custom. The man who has lost an arm or leg is damned eternally,\r\nfor he must go to the local heaven armless or legless and be the\r\nlaughingstock of the gods. This belief is a nuisance to the surgeon\r\ndown there. A native with a gangrenous limb will fight against the\r\nknife, tooth and claw. Slow and painful death by blood poisoning is far\r\npreferable. Die with both your legs on and you can walk into Paradise,\r\na true man....\r\n\r\nWhen a white man has anything artificial, like a glass eye, a realistic\r\nwooden leg, or a set of false teeth, the back-country fellow looks upon\r\nhim as a miracle worker. One of the oldest stories along this line\r\noriginated in Papua--how the plantation manager took out his glass eye\r\nand put it on a stump to glare at his lazy field hands while he was\r\nabsent; it kept the crew busy until a native genius thought of just the\r\nright thing--he put a hat over the magic eye, and they all went back to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nToward the end of my term in New Guinea a situation arose in a native\r\nward which compelled me to take advantage of this popular dread of\r\nmutilation. Influenza had flared up on the plantations. The plague that\r\nlaid our soldiers low in American training camps had visited the South\r\nPacific also, in 1918-1919, and played havoc with these non-resistant\r\npeople. Since then, it had broken out sporadically; but health officers\r\nhad learned more about it and were holding it down better than before.\r\n\r\nI had returned from the field and found the native hospital filled with\r\nflu cases; many were dying in the collapse from pneumonia. The sudden\r\ndeaths among seemingly mild cases puzzled me, until I probed into the\r\ncause. Our native attendants hated to lose sleep; as soon as they were\r\nsnoring, the sick men, hot with fever, would sneak out of a side door\r\nand go down to lie in the sea and cool off under the stars. Then they\r\nwould sneak back to bed and die of shock.\r\n\r\nI put a stop to all that. Native attendants had told them how I slit\r\nopen dead men’s bellies. (I had performed thirty-three postmortems to\r\ndetermine the average native content of whipworms.) My ogreish fame had\r\nspread among a simple folk who would far rather lose a life than a leg.\r\nTo them I was master of life and death--_and_ the postmortem table.\r\n\r\nTherefore I profited by my foul reputation and marched through the\r\nward brandishing a large amputation knife, and as I passed along rows\r\nof quaking cots I shouted: “Suppose you no stop along bed, you sons of\r\nbitches, suppose you no takim medicine good feller, now you die finish,\r\nme cuttim bell’ belong altogether, me cuttim heart, me cuttim wind, me\r\ncuttim gut belong you feller. But suppose you good feller altogether,\r\nnow you die finish, me no cuttim you.”\r\n\r\nDark faces turned green. If they died in a state of disobedience their\r\nbodies would go to butchery on the postmortem table; what chance would\r\ntheir gutted souls have in a heaven where true men walk high, wide\r\nand handsome?... After my threat they turned into completely docile\r\npatients, and we had hardly a case of pneumonia when they were dying of\r\nit elsewhere, all over Rabaul.\r\n\r\nTwenty men in this ward had been rounded up and jailed for cannibalism.\r\nI went to Colonel Honman and described an experiment I wished to\r\nmake. We all knew of Dr. Heiser’s brilliant success in the treatment\r\nof leprosy. Chaulmoogra oil was no new thing; lepers had been given it\r\n_by mouth_ for a couple of thousand years. When Heiser experimented\r\nwith it in the Philippines he didn’t change the remedy--_he changed the\r\nmethod_. He tried chaulmoogra oil in intramuscular injections, with\r\ntremendously improved results.\r\n\r\nI didn’t expect to obtain any such startling effects. What I wanted to\r\nknow mainly was whether chenopodium acted directly on hookworms in the\r\nbowel, or whether it was absorbed into the blood stream first and was\r\nthen ingested by bloodsucking.\r\n\r\nThe twenty cannibals were on the road to recovery from influenza,\r\nand for experimentation Colonel Honman selected six who were heavily\r\ninfected with hookworm. They had already been condemned to hang as an\r\nexample to their outlaw village, so it didn’t matter whether the poor\r\ndevils died in bed or at a rope’s end. My plan was to try intramuscular\r\nand intravenous injections of chenopodium.\r\n\r\nThe result proved harmless to the patients and surprising to the rest\r\nof us. In our tests on three of the patients chenopodium was mixed with\r\ncamphorated oil and resorcin, following Heiser’s formula for preparing\r\nchaulmoogra oil. These three men were given intramuscular injections\r\nin this form, followed by purgatives, and their stools were examined\r\nfor a period of six days. From Case Number 1 we got only four hookworms\r\nin five days; from Case Number 2 two hookworms and one Ascaris. But\r\nCase Number 3 offered the main interest. To him we gave an intravenous\r\ninjection of chenopodium undiluted. After six days we had recovered\r\ntwenty-two whipworms and only three hookworms, although this patient,\r\nlike the other two, was heavily infected with hookworm. In Case 3,\r\nthen, injections of unmixed chenopodium had a far greater effect on\r\nwhipworms than on hookworms.\r\n\r\nIn the three who were given intravenous injections results were:\r\n\r\n  Case 1:--Hookworms: None. Trichuris: 11.\r\n  Case 2:--Hookworms: None. Trichuris: 19. Ascaris: 2.\r\n  Case 3:--Hookworms: None. Trichuris: 30. Ascaris: 2.\r\n\r\nOur experiences with all six cases showed that injections of\r\nchenopodium have little effect intramuscularly on hookworm, and no\r\neffect on that parasite when given intravenously. But in both ways it\r\nhad a marked effect on trichuris.\r\n\r\nWhy was this? Obviously the answer must be in the habits of the two\r\nparasites. The hookworm is a superficial feeder, sucking blood from\r\nthe surface of the gut. The whipworm has a very long head which he\r\nburies half an inch into the intestinal wall; possibly he fed only on\r\nlymph, which may have taken up a heavier charge of the chenopodium.\r\nOrdinarily the whipworm is very resistant to chenopodium, as to all\r\nvermifuges. Yet here he showed a high mortality to the drug when it\r\nwas administered through a new route. Whereas the hookworm, which\r\nis affected by chenopodium given in the usual way, showed a high\r\nresistance to it in the new method.\r\n\r\nI had no time to continue experiments, which were interesting because\r\nthey were the first attempt to give anthelmintics by intramuscular or\r\nintravenous injections, a new route for treating intestinal parasites.\r\nSuperficially at least, I had settled an argument which had arisen\r\namong investigators with more claims to learning than my own. I had\r\nestablished that the action of chenopodium is by direct contact with\r\nthe hookworm in the gut, not by absorption in the blood stream and\r\nsubsequent absorption by the parasite. The experimental cases showed\r\nthat fact clearly, and still more clearly revealed that chenopodium\r\nin intramuscular and intravenous injections has a decided effect on\r\nwhipworm. For the latter there is no other satisfactory treatment. I\r\nmade these tests without the sanction of the Rockefeller Foundation,\r\nwhose letterhead should bear the motto, “We Do Not Experiment with\r\nHuman Beings.” When 61 Broadway learned of what I had been doing there\r\nmight have been trouble for me, but Dr. Maurice C. Hall, chief of the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry at Washington, became my advocate. In a later\r\nchapter I shall have much more to say about this Dr. Hall: we are\r\nindebted to him for one of the world’s great medical discoveries.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, my experimental cannibals never went to the gallows.\r\nAfter leaving New Guinea I learned that another flu epidemic had struck\r\nthe hospital. I was rather glad that the six of them died in bed and\r\ncould go to the Happy Land with all their vertebrae in good order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hated to leave the native hospital, which had taught me so many\r\nvaluable things with which to carry on. I had been working in team with\r\nthe _lik-lik_ doctors and was more than pleased with the technical\r\nprogress they were making.\r\n\r\nNobody could have blamed Governor Wisdom if he had gone stark staring\r\nmad under the pressure of territorial politics. He kept his reason, did\r\nhis work well, and was retired with a title. The white population was\r\nmore of a problem than the black; this new government was still in the\r\ngrab-bag period, every hand feeling out for a prize--anything from an\r\nisland to a fruit cake.\r\n\r\nAt one of the Governor’s receptions, the fine house on the hill was\r\nall in party trim. At an end of the great hall there was a long table,\r\nheavy with cakes, sandwiches and bon-bons. After a pleasant hour,\r\nEloisa and I were about to say good-by, but were waiting for our car to\r\ndrive up in the rain. A minor official’s wife sidled over to the big\r\ntable and said to Eloisa, “Look at those beautiful cakes. I’m going to\r\ngive a party myself tomorrow.” Fitting action to words, she slipped\r\nan eighteen-inch fruitcake under her raincoat. We were at the door,\r\ntelling General and Mrs. Wisdom what a nice party it had been, when\r\nthe lady with the raincoat joined us. “Oh, Governor, such a lovely\r\ntime....” Her hand went out and the fruitcake slipped. _Splunk!_ it\r\nmessed all over the polished floor at the Governor’s feet. Still\r\nholding his hand, she trilled, “I wonder where _that_ came from!” And\r\nfluttered away to her car.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur little house at Rabaul was a meeting and eating place for my\r\ninspectors, drifting in from the field. For a week or two before we\r\nleft, the lot of them were at my table. In the kitchen their boys\r\ngathered around Jerope, matching their tall stories against his.\r\nWe were a busy, uproarious family, getting ready to push on or say\r\ngood-by. We had added up our mileage for that New Guinea campaign:\r\n9,958 for all of us, traveling on everything that would walk, pull\r\nor float. My score was 3,523, not counting steamer trips to and from\r\nAustralia--and Beach came next with 1,893.\r\n\r\nWhen young Byron Beach joined our farewell house party he looked like\r\na schoolboy fresh from tennis and a shower. He didn’t show a scratch,\r\nalthough by all the laws of chance he should have been dead. For our\r\nyoung adventurer had gone alone 165 miles up the Sepik River, a region\r\nso wild and dangerous that only armed expeditions dared it in 1921, and\r\nthey came back with shuddering horror stories. Beach had tackled it in\r\na frail canoe, paddled by jittering natives--he wasn’t literally alone,\r\nbut he was the solitary white man. Beach had no business risking his\r\nfool neck without a white companion. If he had waited for me I would\r\nhave joined him.\r\n\r\nAlmost his first act when he came to our house was to hand Eloisa £400\r\nfor safekeeping overnight. He grinned nonchalantly next morning when he\r\ntook the money back, and doubled it in a tortoise-shell investment. The\r\nboy had heroic qualities, but he never forgot that he was a trader.\r\n\r\nI wish I had the space to show you the diary he kept on that fantastic\r\ntrip. I had sent him up to inspect Father Kirschbaum’s mission, not far\r\nfrom the wide brown mouth of that mysterious river whose upper waters\r\nlie in the howling darkness of the unexplored. With the good Father\r\npraying for his soul Beach set out on July 17, carrying plenty of tins\r\nfor hookworm specimens and blandly intending to offer his wares to a\r\njungle full of naked killers. The lad had the cheek of the devil, and\r\nthat probably saw him through.\r\n\r\nSome of the villages were unexpectedly friendly. In one of them the men\r\nwere fiercely armed and hideously painted, awaiting another attack from\r\nan enemy who had burned half their houses and carried away thirty-seven\r\nvillagers just before lunchtime. Beach distributed tins among these\r\npeople, and told them, through a scared interpreter, how to use them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sepik folk were good to Beach they let him sleep in a\r\nTambarand House, which is a tribal chamber of horrors, decorated with\r\nthe skulls of relatives and valorous foemen. Artists decorated the\r\nfamily skulls to a semblance of life, and the good tribesmen took them\r\nto bed with them.\r\n\r\nThe natives were disappointed when they found that Beach’s specimen\r\ntins did not contain red paint for sale. Some of them punched holes\r\nthrough the tins and hung them around their necks. He had to scold them\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\nThere were days of paddling into queerer and queerer regions. Time and\r\nagain Beach saw headless corpses floating down stream. Probably they\r\nwere the bodies of relatives; enemy meat would have been otherwise\r\ndisposed of. In another village, bristling with spears, Beach made so\r\nbold as to prick a boy’s finger for a blood test. At sight of blood\r\nthe warriors began to howl like wolves, but Beach was there with his\r\neverready salesmanship. He smiled winsomely as he presented the tribe\r\nwith a collection of mirrors and fishhooks. As he wrote in his diary,\r\n“I’ll say I was thankful. Things were almost jolly when I left.”\r\n\r\nAt Timbunke, twenty-five miles farther up, it wasn’t so jolly. On the\r\nshore was a reception committee of 200 painted devils, brandishing\r\nspears and yelling at the top of their lungs. “I tried not to be in a\r\nhurry getting back in the canoe,” he wrote, “but the boys paddled for\r\ntheir lives, with all that bellowing mob scampering along the shore.\r\nPerhaps they were just wishing me a safe journey. No white man has ever\r\nslept there.”\r\n\r\nAll along it was playing poker with death. A fire on the shore might\r\nmean that friendly people were guiding your canoe to a safe landing. Or\r\nit might mean that the oven was heating up for a neighborhood roasting.\r\nBeach visited dozens of these places, and in most instances carried\r\naway the specimen tins, properly filled. Some of the villagers were\r\ntimid, in deadly fear of their neighbors; others were so dangerous that\r\nBeach never let them get behind his back. In one of the tamest villages\r\nhe was knocked down--by an earthquake. At the tip end of his journey\r\n165 miles up the Sepik, he scored his triumph. He cajoled a warrior\r\ninto submitting to the whole treatment, and recovered 105 worms.\r\n\r\nOn his swing back, he revisited some of the spots which had seemed\r\nespecially hostile. At Moim, for instance, he had used his diplomacy,\r\nplus a liberal gift of gimcracks, and distributed 95 tins. When he\r\nreturned a few days later he got them all back in good order. On August\r\n11, after having his canoe swamped in a gale, he reached the mouth\r\nof the Sepik and paid off his canoe boys. They charged him thirty\r\nshillings apiece, and Beach rounded off his diary by saying that it was\r\nno trouble at all to handle the Sepik natives, if you used a little\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\nWell, the young cub got back to me, smiling and cheerful. It was a mad\r\ntrip, but I rather envied him the adventure. I think its outstanding\r\nfeature was Beach’s nonchalance in returning to the savage villages and\r\ncollecting the tins he had left behind.\r\n\r\nNow about that roll of £400 which he left in Eloisa’s keeping, just\r\novernight. I learned about that later. In approximately three weeks of\r\nvoyaging to hell and back, he had found time to shoot down a collection\r\nof birds of paradise which he sold to a handy trader somewhere on the\r\nway home. I sometimes wonder if poaching didn’t motivate that fearless\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nByron Beach left me as picturesquely as he had come into my life. One\r\nfine afternoon, off the Solomon Islands, he sailed into the sunset in a\r\ntrim little schooner that he had borrowed for the joy ride. He had also\r\nborrowed a trim little native girl. Neither Byron, boat nor beauty ever\r\ncame back to that port, or any other that I know of. But I am inclined\r\nto believe that wherever he landed he landed on his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nKING SOLOMON’S GOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Guinea was my jumping off place for the Solomon Islands, and\r\n“jumping off” well describes my first trip around that great island\r\nchain. I had only a few weeks to work in, and to draw conclusions\r\nwhich were to lead up to years of campaigning along 700 miles of\r\nthat wild archipelago. If you will recall George Fulton, the man in\r\nevening dress whom I met in a smelly trader’s store, you will remember\r\nhis half-promise to send me down to lost Rennell Island on the Lever\r\nBrothers’ yacht. Well, he had kept his promise--with reservations--and\r\nI was at last on the Levers’ _Koonakarra_, heading southeast. I had\r\nplanned to go on the Government’s _Bellama_, but she was wrecked in\r\na hurricane. To be transferred to George Fulton’s boat seemed like a\r\nstroke of luck. Now I could see Rennell Island....\r\n\r\nIt was nine years before I saw Rennell, for the very good reason that\r\nGeorge Fulton didn’t want me to see it. He had changed his mind since I\r\ntalked with him. Rennell might turn out to be a phosphate island, one\r\nof those volcanic freaks which quantities of bird guano and submersion\r\nin sea water have loaded with valuable crystalline fertilizer. Fulton\r\ndidn’t want Rockefeller people snooping around his potential bonanza. A\r\nfew years later he found that Rennell’s wealth was just another myth of\r\nKing Solomon’s gold.\r\n\r\nAlvaro Mendaña, who found these islands in 1568, returned to Spain\r\nand told King Philip that he had discovered the place where King\r\nSolomon got his gold. Philip rewarded the naughty liar by sending him\r\non a second expedition; but when he returned to the isles of specious\r\nwealth he found that they had disappeared. Just another case of bad\r\nRenaissance navigation, but Mendaña died hunting for the vanished\r\nSolomons. They were lost for 200 years. Monsieur de Bougainville found\r\nthem again in 1768.\r\n\r\nAs far as Rennell Island was concerned, for a long while I felt that I\r\nhad been cheated of my gold. It was not idle curiosity which drew me\r\ntoward that mysterious spot. If the people had been, as George Fulton\r\nsaid, “practically untouched for ages,” I might find there a clue to\r\nthe origin of the Polynesian race. Many of the ancient invasions have\r\nbeen traced through the evidence of the hookworm. The public health\r\nphysician, you see, must be a bit of an anthropologist, a bit of a\r\npolitician and a bit of a historian....\r\n\r\nBut I had to wait until 1930 to see Rennell Island.\r\n\r\nThe _Koonakarra_ of 1921 was so busy trading, recruiting and\r\nsupervising plantations that I had to pick up what information I could\r\nget between stops. I had an opportunity to draw one large conclusion:\r\nthat natives from the big islands to the north, near the infesting\r\ntrade routes, were much the more heavily diseased. Disease diminished\r\nsteadily as we moved down toward the less frequented parts. My\r\nsuperficial look at a population which, for lack of an accurate census,\r\nwas estimated at 100,000, verified my theory: _Epidemics are the fruits\r\nof island hospitality._\r\n\r\nIn those days little could be done to improve conditions. That group\r\nof a half-dozen enormous islands, and the many little outlying ones,\r\nwas served by one lone Medical Officer, and some missionary doctors who\r\nstrove with a bravery against conditions that should have broken their\r\nvaliant spirits.\r\n\r\nAmong the unsung heroes--but no missionary--was my friend J. C. Barley,\r\nOxford M.A., who had voluntarily given his life to a God-forsaken post\r\nat Kirakira. In his jungle house he was like something out of Kipling,\r\ndressing for the evening, having his spot of gin and bitters before\r\ndinner, his sound cigar afterward. He might have gone anywhere in the\r\ncolonial service, for as a young Oxonian he had outranked hundreds in\r\ncompetitive examinations. But he was too clean a sportsman to play\r\npolitics. His passion for ethnology and his affectionate responsibility\r\nfor the natives kept him where he was. He had become the people’s\r\nadvocate, and knew more about the Solomons than any official report\r\ncould ever tell. His trips for inspection and research were his only\r\nrelief from solitude.\r\n\r\nI only speak of Barley because he was so useful to my future work and\r\nbecause of pleasant memories of his charming mind; in fact I should\r\nnot write at all of this brief survey, except that I wish to point out\r\na few spots where in later years I returned and marked the changes\r\nwrought by contact with the outer world.\r\n\r\nBill Tully and I worked mostly at night, lecturing by lantern light.\r\nThe ship would be off in the early morning. At Star Harbour on San\r\nCristoval, the largest island on the unfrequented southeast, the naked\r\npeople carried candlenut torches as they wound down the mountain\r\ntrail. It was like something out of “A Midsummer-Night’s Dream,” that\r\ntwisting stream of light. Few traders and no missionaries had come to\r\nthem, and they showed a low rate of infection. A friendly, backward\r\nNegroid people, they were endangered by their own hospitality. Charley\r\nOne Arm, the policeman, our fierce black guide, couldn’t understand us\r\nwhen we refused the temporary gift of two island daughters. I went away\r\ndreading what might happen when more trading ships came in.\r\n\r\nSanta Ana lay so near that one of their canoes, bastard ebony with\r\nmother-of-pearl insets, could take you there in an hour or two. Yet the\r\nSanta Ana folk were light-skinned and their features almost Caucasian.\r\nThey wore bones in their noses and shark’s teeth around their necks.\r\nThere was more trading, hence more hookworm. I gave treatments to\r\nTrader Kuper’s two little half-caste sons. It was a good investment,\r\nand later I shall tell you why.\r\n\r\nGraciosa Bay was so wild that Mr. Mathews, Lever Brothers’\r\nrepresentative who had lived there fifteen years with an armed guard,\r\nwarned us not to come ashore. With knives and fishhooks we lured a few\r\nof the untamed to come aboard the launch and be examined. In fifteen\r\nyears the population had dropped from 3,000 to 500. Somehow, in spite\r\nof their savagery, they had allowed vicious malaria and tuberculosis to\r\nget in.\r\n\r\nNear-by Reef Island showed a different, lighter breed. Somewhat\r\nmissionized, largely pagan, it had a murderous reputation. It was in\r\nits harbor, Mohawk Bay, that an incident occurred which I remembered\r\nfor twelve years. After a lantern-light lecture I was resting in the\r\nwhaleboat. In the dim moonlight a naked man came floundering toward me.\r\nI reached for a hatchet, and a mild voice told me that it was only Sam,\r\nthe Christian teacher. I had made a mistake, Sam told me, and gone to a\r\nheathen village. His was the Christian village I should have given my\r\nmagic tins to. And wouldn’t I come? It was too late for that, so I let\r\nhim stand waist-high in the water while I taught him the outline of my\r\npidgin English lecture. I gave him tins and told him to bring them back\r\nto me in the morning. He brought them to me at dawn, and I admired his\r\nChristian fortitude. Poor devil--like the others, he thought our tins\r\nwere magic boxes that would cure the people. I waited twelve years to\r\nhear the sequel to that story....\r\n\r\nAt Mohawk Bay I found that a young native was selling the services\r\nof his fiancée to our sailors. Brides were expensive there, and he\r\nhad formed a syndicate to buy her, then rent her out until she had\r\nearned the price. It was “the fashion.” Not as a moralist, but as a\r\ndoctor I asked the question: Who would educate people like these, upon\r\nfast-opening trade routes? Who would teach them self-protection? The\r\nmissionaries? Perhaps. But the doctor must follow, or there would be\r\nnobody left to educate.\r\n\r\n“Recruiting,” that legalized form of contract labor, might act as an\r\neducator. The High Commission Government was already requiring that\r\nplantation hands should be well-cared-for medically and sufficiently\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nIn a lonely bay I saw recruiters at work. One man with a rifle lay\r\nflat in the bow of a cutter, covering every movement of another man\r\nwho approached the shore in a whaleboat. The whaleboat backed water\r\nall the way, and the man sent to parley stood up, carefully facing the\r\nnaked savages who waited on the beach. All during the long powwow the\r\nhidden rifle was carefully aimed. These labor conferences were no job\r\nfor a coward. So many lone recruiters had been killed on duty that the\r\nGovernment had made it a law that they must hunt in pairs.\r\n\r\nConsidering the vast work which we must soon undertake in the Solomon\r\nIslands, I was encouraged when I found that the intelligent native\r\nlooked upon indentured labor service as a blessing, just as it had\r\nbeen in Papua. An island boy said to me, “I wish the _Hawk_ would come\r\nsoon.” The _Hawk_ was a recruiting ship. I asked him why he wanted\r\nit to come soon, and he said, “There are so many sore-legs in the\r\nvillage.” This boy knew what was good for his people, and I hoped that\r\nthere would be many more like him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI never think of Sikiana without a little sadness. Three small atolls\r\nall but link. The Sikiana Group was the last land to be discovered in\r\n1791 and since then very few vessels had touched there. The inhabitants\r\nwere pure Polynesian people; and because our crew was composed of\r\nSikiana men our landing was a joyous homecoming. Every man-jack in\r\nthe village was lightly lit on homemade toddy; the Ellice Islanders,\r\ntheir blood-cousins, had taught them how to cut the central spathe of\r\nthe coconut, catch the drip, and trust in fermentation. Unfermented, it\r\nmakes a fine baby food. In toddy form, it is intoxicating.\r\n\r\nThere was some heathen religious festival going on, hence the bibulous\r\nhilarity. The women, who never drank, couldn’t speak pidgin. Much\r\ngesturing, and the aid of our Sikiana sailors, who were sharing the\r\ntoddy, sent swimmers and canoemen to the neighboring atolls to spread\r\nthe news. And the people danced. Not lewdly, but with the natural grace\r\nof unspoiled bodies. They were completely pagan. No missionary had ever\r\nsettled here. Traders hadn’t debauched them; the soil was too poor to\r\nproduce anything worth trading for.\r\n\r\nThe girls were lovely with their long, fine, glossy hair; they hadn’t\r\nlearned to bob it as they were doing on the missionized islands. They\r\nwore modest _lavalavas_ from waist to ankles, and a kerchief which they\r\nknotted around the neck and drew under one arm. Some of the men wore\r\ntheir hair long, too, in ancient Polynesian fashion. I made friends\r\nwith a splendid young fellow named Lautaua, who talked fair pidgin\r\nand told me how “in the time of his grandfather” (that might mean a\r\nthousand years ago; they had a habit of reckoning time by grandfathers)\r\nthe Tongafiti had come to Sikiana and killed everybody except the\r\nwomen, and how succeeding migrations from Ongtong Java and the Ellices\r\nhad drifted there in lost canoes.\r\n\r\nI only mention their drinking because it was something of a freak\r\nin that corner of the Pacific. The Sikiana folk only made toddy on\r\nfestival occasions, and never took it beyond the point of exhilaration.\r\nLater on, taking the advice of Mr. Barley, who was always their\r\ngenerous friend, they stopped making and drinking toddy. In Sikiana\r\nthey were gay enough without false stimulation--a friendly, virtuous,\r\nlovable people; perhaps their custom of keeping women away from liquor\r\nhelped maintain their racial self-respect. By and large, I have found\r\nthe tribes on comparatively sterile islands superior in health and\r\ncharacter to their neighbors who had little to do but lie in the shade\r\nand catch bananas. It’s the same the wide world over; those of Adam’s\r\nsons who work for a living are better fitted to cope with the cruelties\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nYoung children held our hands and drew our arms around them. The moon\r\nswung high over the lagoon and our returned sailors, quite sober now,\r\ndaintily walked with their girls, up and down the beach. As we sat on\r\nthe sand, waiting for the lecture audience to come on, young girls put\r\ngarlands around our necks, chains which would bind our memories to\r\nSikiana; these were ropes of hair, a strand from the head of every girl.\r\n\r\nI had given lectures under odd conditions, but never before like this.\r\nWhite moonlight, pretty, laughing faces, simple people who took it\r\nall as the greatest joke in the world, but were so kind-hearted that\r\nthey followed our instructions faithfully, as one might indulge a\r\nfeeble-minded person of whom one is fond. Everybody smiled, even the\r\ndignified patriarch whom we called Old Number One; he was an unsalaried\r\nofficial representative of the Government. Between Old Number One and\r\nLautaua, everything was arranged for us. Next day when we departed all\r\nwas in order.\r\n\r\nA simple people, allowed to grow up in their own way. Were they\r\nthe uncivilized ones, or were we? They were not entirely free from\r\ntuberculosis; but they seemed to have set up an immunity. Here was a\r\nGovernment without the need of officialdom; no discord, no poverty,\r\nno distress, no taxes, no clothing to speak of; and no vices more\r\nobnoxious than a little toddy-drinking on national holidays.\r\n\r\nI left happy Sikiana with a certain fear for its future. I saw it again\r\nin 1933....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI returned by way of Sydney to pick up my family. In a week or so\r\nI would be pointing toward Suva, which was the cultural center of\r\nthe South Pacific--if you disregard the scientifically advanced\r\nuniversities in Australia and New Zealand. Suva was to be headquarters\r\nfor the rest of my professional career.\r\n\r\nThus far I had worked toward proving my favorite point: Depopulation\r\nfollows the visitor. I believed what I still believe--that the item\r\nwhich looms over everything else in the question of failing native\r\nraces _is the introduction of diseases to which they have no immunity_.\r\nI had seen its effects so often, right under my eyes.\r\n\r\nMoving toward Sydney, I took stock of my South Sea experience, which\r\nhad covered less than four years. I was beginning to see that one bad\r\nold theory was losing ground--the belief that the native, especially\r\nthe Melanesian, is an economic unit to be exploited till he dies.\r\nGovernments once blind and cruel were beginning to see light. The\r\nBritish High Commission, controlling five island groups, was struggling\r\ntoward better things. So was progressive New Zealand with her mandates\r\nand possessions over wide stretches of Polynesia.\r\n\r\nI considered the stumbling blocks in the way of curing sick Oceania.\r\nThe Rockefeller Foundation, a vast scientific machine tuned up to deal\r\nout mercy in a practical, businesslike way, must have a co-operation\r\nwhich the Pacific administrations of that day were not offering. There\r\nmust be teamwork, or nothing could be accomplished. Medical authority\r\nmust come from a central brain. As things stood, the health physicians\r\nwere political appointees, either lazy and incompetent time-servers\r\nor good men baffled by overwork and the whims of local government.\r\nWhen one good health officer retired a successor would come in to\r\nundo whatever he had begun. It was medical chaos, and I felt that the\r\nFoundation’s liberal share in cleaning up the Pacific must be backed up\r\nby some unified control. Else the work would be as futile as sweeping\r\nfog off a back porch. Suva, capital of Fiji, was headquarters for the\r\nBritish High Commission, and the Governor of Fiji was its head. Suva\r\nwould be the ideal center for such medical authority.\r\n\r\nI considered the problem of leprosy. All along the way I had\r\nencountered this imported disease, but there was no census to tell\r\nwhether or not it was increasing. The cure and prevention of leprosy is\r\nmethodical treatment with the one known remedy, and segregation of the\r\ninfected. In all the South Pacific except Fiji there was nothing like a\r\nmodern leper colony. The island governments should combine to support\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe shortage of doctors had been very discouraging. Few competent white\r\nmen cared to endure tropical hardships for starvation pay. From sheer\r\nboredom and despair many of them became quacks and drunkards--even\r\nif they hadn’t started out that way. The answer to that was educated\r\nnative medical men.... I have talked about that a great deal, because\r\nthat idea never left me. And now I was going to Fiji, where there had\r\nalready been a crude attempt to teach medicine to Fijians.\r\n\r\nAs our ship neared Suva, a larger worry was in the back of my mind.\r\nThrough years of study, from North Queensland to Papua, from Papua\r\nto New Guinea, from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands, I had found\r\nthat oil of chenopodium was not working well enough or fast enough to\r\nrelieve the million patients who reached out for a cure. In Rabaul’s\r\nhospital I had given injections of it, hoping to make the drug more\r\neffective through a new channel. The experiment had removed whipworms,\r\nbut almost no hookworms.\r\n\r\nI had to look these facts in the face. Chenopodium, on which we had\r\nrelied as a cure for one of the world’s most prevalent blights, was not\r\ncoming up to our expectations. There seemed no answer to that, until\r\nhelp came from an unexpected quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n“SO YOU’VE COME TO FIJI!”\r\n\r\n\r\nI have such a collection of hurricanes that in self-searching moments I\r\ncall myself “The Storm King’s Target.” The wind that blew us around an\r\nisland, that time we were trying to make Rabaul, is an example. Another\r\nwas one hot day in Fiji, years later, when our half-caste skipper\r\ndemonstrated his share of brains: He saw the storm coming and poked our\r\ncockleshell into a sheltering cove. For three days we “holed up” with\r\nDistrict Officer Bob and his wife Elaine, and watched a Fiji village\r\ntake wings; the big palm-thatched meeting-house looked like a flying\r\nhaystack. On the way home I searched for landmarks. Two rivers on Viti\r\nLevu had plunged together; an East Indian village had been swept away,\r\neverybody drowned. A Fijian town had vanished under a sliding mountain.\r\n\r\nOnce in North Queensland I saw a galvanized iron roof wrap itself\r\naround a telephone pole as you wrap paper around a pencil. I’ve been\r\nlucky; never has a ship gone down under me--quite. Several ships,\r\nthough, have been wrecked before I had time to get aboard.\r\n\r\nTwo refuges for the soul in a hurricane are the Power of Prayer and\r\nthe Power of Swear. Take your choice. Once the big wind roared over\r\na mission station, and the missioner, who didn’t care to go himself,\r\nsent loyal converts down to bring in his launch, and they saved the\r\nboat from the gale’s fury. Neighbors made scandal of the wanton risk,\r\nbut the missionary smiled, “Oh, no. It was no risk. I saw the Spirit\r\nhovering over them when they went down to the water.”\r\n\r\nAnother hurricane met our ship coming toward Fiji from Sydney, and I\r\nfell back on the Power of Swear. With every comber that plowed through\r\nthe dining saloon of the old 1,100-ton _Suva_ I dug up long-forgotten\r\noaths. My wife and child got through; Eloisa comes of a pithy stock,\r\notherwise she could never have followed me in my curious career. This\r\ntrip was a soul-shaker. The Fijians have a _meke_ song in which they\r\naddress the powers of the hurricane, “blown from the black mouths of\r\nthe Ladies of the West.” For three horrible days the Ladies of the West\r\ngave it to us, straight. The captain tied our propeller-shaft in a\r\nbowknot, heading straight into the volley, trying to drag us out of an\r\ninvisible grip.\r\n\r\nI had my hands full, seeing that my eight-year-old Harriette wasn’t\r\ndrowned in our stateroom. An Australian lady furnished a touch “of\r\nromance.” A hard one would shiver our timbers, she would cling to me,\r\nher children would cling to her. “Oh, Doctor, I’m so glad”--she would\r\nshriek above the tempest--“that you’re here on the ship. I feel so much\r\nsafer.” I imagined myself swimming with Eloisa and Harriette in one\r\nhand and the Australian lady (with family) in the other.\r\n\r\nWhen we limped into Suva harbor the sea had turned to glass. Hurricanes\r\nhave an annoying way of doing things like that.\r\n\r\nThere on our starboard hand lay the jumbled little waterfront; and\r\non our portside a craggy peak they call The Devil’s Thumb; perpetual\r\nlandslides had marked its face with a perfect =Y=, as though Yale\r\nsophomores had been working overnight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuva, capital of Fiji, has advanced a great deal in the last eighteen\r\nyears. Nowadays occasional passenger liners dock there and allow\r\ntourists to straighten out their sea legs. The men can buy their\r\nfavorite brand at Piccadilly tobacconists or London bars. The\r\ndebutantes can play tennis, while their mothers visit little jewel\r\nshops and squander a few shillings on a small handful of silver-gilt\r\npearls that are lovely and have no respectable commercial rating, or\r\ntake in the museum and shudder at the collection of savage iron-wood\r\nclubs which ex-cannibals traded for hymnals,--or buy a four-shilling\r\nguidebook at the Carnegie Library,--or inspect the Government Building,\r\nthat cost about $1,500,000 and looks a size too large for Pittsburgh;\r\nthat structure was built after the gold rush of ’32 when the colony\r\nwent madder than Californians and started things on a grand scale--for\r\na while. Suva today is like any small colonial capital. Whiskered Sikh\r\npolicemen in staring red tunics guide the traffic; along the orderly\r\nstreets walk orderly Fijians, short white _sulus_ and bare legs under\r\nEnglish coats, their immense, smoothly cut headdresses of kinky hair\r\ngiving them the appearance of English guardsmen in regimental bearskin\r\nbusbies. Dignified, broad-shouldered, small-waisted, they seem to be\r\nheading for some savage war-dance. Actually they are going to church,\r\nor to the native motion picture palace.\r\n\r\nSuva in 1922 had one dirt road that ran to Nausori, fifteen miles away.\r\nThe taxi fare was about $7.50. Your director, to save Rockefeller\r\nfunds, usually went there on the little _Andi Roronga_, which took\r\nfrom 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. with a stop along the mangrove-tangled Rewa. She\r\nstarted back at two. When you went by taxi you had to cross the river\r\non a funny pontoon with a submerged cable.\r\n\r\nI was no longer under the loose-handed control of Australia. Now it\r\nwas the British High Commission that owned Fiji’s 250-odd islands, had\r\na grip on the Solomons, a tiny toehold on the independent Kingdom of\r\nTonga, controlled the Gilbert and Ellice Group and ran some curiously\r\ndistant isles, like Rotumah and Pitcairn and Christmas Island. The\r\nGovernor of Fiji was (and is) the temporal head of the High Commission.\r\nHowever, the real government comes from London. Colonials as a rule\r\ndon’t understand Englishmen. Americans, after what happened about 1776,\r\ncan sympathize. The Yankee slides comfortably into the ways of the\r\nCanadian, the Australian, the New Zealander or South African. The born\r\nEnglishman with his hauteur and peculiarity is another fish to fry. He\r\nhas ruled his far-flung dominions uncannily well, but his colonials\r\ntender him more respect than love.\r\n\r\nYet down there I have worked with Englishmen for whom I felt the\r\ndeepest loyalty and friendship. Chris Kendrick is one of them. Barley\r\nis another, and there are many more. Pretty soon I am going to tell you\r\nof another, who was my associate for eight years in Fiji.\r\n\r\nColonials in Suva used to grumble, “Back in London they don’t know\r\nwe’re alive.” But the politicians knew. Fiji became a dumping place\r\nfor younger sons and Ministry favorites. Young chaps, green as grass\r\nand fresh as paint, were called “cadets,” and there was always a new\r\ncadet to fill the desk left vacant by retirement or promotion. Against\r\nthe cadet system the experienced colonial, who knew the land and the\r\npeople, hadn’t the ghost of a show.\r\n\r\nWhere the English are respected and not liked, the Americans are\r\nliked but not respected. Colonials regard us as too evangelical,\r\ntoo insistent on modern shower baths in every room and on having\r\neverybody’s trousers creased in the same way. They speak of us as\r\nrotten colonizers; and these arguments are in the face of our record\r\nin Cuba, for instance, where we cleaned up yellow fever and gave the\r\nisland real sanitation.... I remember what an educated Cuban once said\r\nto me, “Of course we don’t like you, Doctor. You found us dirty and\r\ncontented; now we are clean and unhappy.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNaturally the British Empire must exact tribute from her dominions or\r\nshe could not survive. All over Britain’s Pacific empire “Buy English”\r\nwas behind the sale of all the machinery, all the material used in\r\npublic improvements. Yet it was astonishing how popular American\r\nproducts remained, in spite of the high preferential tariff against\r\nthem. American cars, burdened with a 45 per cent duty, were eagerly\r\nsought in New Zealand, Australia, Fiji. Loyal colonials had their\r\ntongues hanging out in their desire to buy British automobiles, yet\r\npig-headed English manufacturers were sending low-powered, poorly\r\nsprung cars, built for smooth, hill-less roads. Our own Henry Ford\r\nwould have adapted his article to geographical requirements. Not so the\r\nBritish maker with his cry, “Buy English!”\r\n\r\nSunkist oranges were everywhere, an example of American trade-genius\r\nunder difficulties. New Zealand, with her own tropical possessions and\r\naccess to Australia’s and Jamaica’s supplies, displayed Sunkist oranges\r\nin every remote village. It’s still an unfathomable mystery to me, how\r\nthese California go-getters can drag oranges eight or nine thousand\r\nmiles, and profit under adverse conditions. Maybe it is because their\r\nfruit is obtainable all year round, or because its uniform size makes\r\nit attractive.\r\n\r\nAs my work went on in Fiji I had to put up a fight for one important\r\ndrug, the arsenical derivative neosalvarsan, often conveniently called\r\n“salvarsan,” although it is Ehrlich’s improvement on his own salvarsan\r\ndiscovery. It is indispensable in the treatment of yaws. On one of my\r\nbrief trips to the United States I argued the high cost of neosalvarsan\r\nwith wholesale drug manufacturers who came to a meeting of the American\r\nMedical Association. Could the price be cut down if we ordered it in\r\nlarge quantities? I promised that if they would give us a good price\r\nwe could use $7500 worth a year. When our purchasing agent struck a\r\nbargain I don’t think the wholesalers regretted it. We used the order\r\nsoon after the first shipment, and cabled for more. When we ceased to\r\nbuy in driblet lots, the cost of neosalvarsan was cut four times, and\r\neach price was lower than that set by the Crown Agent in London--he\r\nbeing the gentleman whom the Mother Country appoints to collect a\r\nlarge part of the tax on colonies and dominions. Through the deal our\r\npurchasing agent made with American wholesalers natives of the South\r\nPacific were saved more than the Foundation’s expenditure on building\r\nprograms, health campaigns and my salary.\r\n\r\nThis sudden attack on the high price of drugs caused a mild sensation\r\nin London, which had governed the purchase of arsenicals up to that\r\ntime. The Crown Agent responsible for disbursements compared our\r\neconomical prices with those the colony had been paying. The reaction\r\nwas true to form. Representatives of the Home Government wanted to\r\nknow, unofficially, if we were in cahoots with some big Yankee chemical\r\nfirm. At first an attempt was made to discredit my drug; then the price\r\nof salvarsan came tobogganing all through the British Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy reception in official Suva, though polite, was never emotional.\r\nThere had been a short Rockefeller campaign there in 1917-1918, which\r\nhad left the Administration markedly unenthusiastic. The Governor, Sir\r\nCecil Hunter Rodwell, was a fine fellow, and I owe much to him and to\r\nSir Maynard Hedstrom, a wealthy merchant who could see much further\r\nahead of his nose than most I met; Hedstrom was with me in all my\r\nendeavors.\r\n\r\nThe Suva Hospital was not stately--a creaky old shack tinkered up\r\nsomehow. The new War Memorial was finished a few months later when\r\nthe Medical Department took it over; in spite of its newness it was\r\na makeshift, and so small that it was overcrowded until the building\r\nprogram of 1934. The native nurses, for example, were jammed into an\r\nancient wooden structure, where they had to carry their own firewood\r\nand do their own cooking in most primitive style; and these were the\r\ngirls we must depend upon to raise Fijian standards of living.\r\n\r\nThere were between twenty-two and twenty-four medical officers whose\r\naverage brains and conscientiousness were of a high order. I called\r\nthem “the Old Guard” and was sorry that so many of them were retired\r\nsoon afterwards; younger ones who replaced many of them had neither the\r\nsocial, educational nor ethical ideals of their predecessors. And it\r\nseemed to me that cadets who came out for the civil administration were\r\nalso a step-down in quality.\r\n\r\nThere were forty Native Medical Practitioners--natives given a\r\nthree-year course in simple medicine and surgery. They had no\r\nclassroom, no charts, only one small book of simple medicine and\r\nhygiene, and that was written in Fijian. Teaching paraphernalia was\r\npractically nil. These boys attended out-patients, acted as male\r\nnurses, attended the doctors on their rounds. Their lectures were given\r\nat the hospital by the Chief Medical Officer and the Resident Medical\r\nOfficer. When these officers spoke Fijian and were interested, the\r\nresults were good; when they were not interested the formal education\r\nwas very sketchy.\r\n\r\nI studied this system, developed for over thirty years, and wondered if\r\nit wasn’t an answer to my prayer for something constructive. Some of\r\nthese boys, though taught so little surgical practice, developed great\r\nability; it was almost as though their cannibal ancestry had given them\r\na particular flair for human anatomy. One Native Medical Practitioner\r\n(N.M.P.) was Sowani, who was lent to the Gilbert Island Colony and made\r\na famous reputation as a surgeon; I shall tell of him in the proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThere was a system of native obstetrical nursing as well as a training\r\nschool for European nurses. The native nurses had lectures from a\r\nFijian with the same educational background as their own. One lecture\r\na week for six months each of two years, then the girls were sent with\r\nN.M.P.’s to assist Fijian mothers in confinement. Bed-pan carrying for\r\nEuropean probationers, mopping, and doorknob cleaning made up their\r\nonly other training. They spoke no English.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chief Medical Officer sat pining at his desk when I made my first\r\ncall. He was about to retire, and that splendid Englishman, Dr. Aubrey\r\nMontague, with twenty years of local experience, was about to take his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe soon-retiring C.M.O. rose from his work, offered me his hand and\r\nsaid mournfully, “So you’ve come to Fiji!”\r\n\r\nYes, we’d come to Fiji. The Chief Medical Officer retained the hairline\r\nbalance of politeness. The Foundation was a nice philanthropic\r\ninstitution, and it was sweet of us to be interested and all that; but\r\nthere was no enthusiasm for chenopodium. I heartily agreed with him. We\r\ncompared notes--without profit. You can’t invent a cure-all overnight.\r\nThere was nothing to take the place of what we had, and nothing to do\r\nbut go on.\r\n\r\nIt was a boon to me and to Fiji when Dr. Aubrey Montague took over the\r\ndesk of the Chief Medical Officer. He was the best of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nbreed, one of the most helpful influences that ever touched my life.\r\nClear-headed, clear-eyed, he was spiritually incapable of lying even to\r\nhimself. I never knew him to do an underhand thing or go back on his\r\nword--quite a record for an official in the tropics. He was one of the\r\nthree ablest men I have known in the Pacific and he didn’t take third\r\nplace. A naturally shy man walls himself in. I put a high value on the\r\nintimacy we formed when the wall was broken and I could look in on his\r\nwell-controlled intellect.\r\n\r\nHis clean life and ideals were free from intolerance; he judged\r\nmen leniently. I have often seen them fail him, and be forgiven\r\ntomorrow after he had weighed them in his kindly practical mind. His\r\nadministration opened an era of large expansion, especially along lines\r\nof preventive medicine. A routine politician would have thrown money\r\naround. Montague was economical, almost parsimonious. It was a wondrous\r\nthing in those days to see government funds protected by a gentleman’s\r\ndeep responsibility to King and Country.\r\n\r\nGovernors continually came to him with questions outside his\r\ndepartment; advice from his clear mind was never less than valuable. So\r\nit was a great shock to me when Montague, after thirty years of service\r\nto the Empire, was allowed to retire and to die without the honors\r\nhe richly deserved. He had done his job unobtrusively and lacked the\r\nself-seeking qualities that bid for titles. The only monument he left\r\nbehind him was an unfillable gap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough those first few months we agreed on three ambitious plans.\r\nMontague wanted an improved native medical school for his Fijians, a\r\nreal one instead of a makeshift. His wish was mine, and uppermost in my\r\nthoughts; but I wanted this educational project to reach out over all\r\nthe South Pacific. It was a big idea which might have seemed audacious,\r\nbut we discussed its possibilities from every angle. He saw clearly the\r\nadvantage of sending competently educated islanders back to their homes\r\nto work among their own people.\r\n\r\nWe went into the subject of asylum for lepers at Mokogai,[2] a near-by\r\nisland where the old establishment had been moldering for years. I\r\npointed out that all the poor, small Pacific groups might combine their\r\nresources co-operatively and make Mokogai the center, a modernized and\r\nenlarged plant where patients could be cared for at minimum cost and\r\nwith maximum results. Here would be teamwork, the thing most needed\r\nover those wide blue waters.\r\n\r\nAnd we agreed on another design for teamwork. High Commission control\r\nshould be centralized more, particularly in health matters. Quick\r\ncommunications, radio especially, were bringing the islands together.\r\nWe saw a far vision of a unified medical service; one that would make\r\nsense out of the bedlam that existed from New Guinea to the Society\r\nIslands. Montague and I were for this plan, and before our preliminary\r\ntalks were over we had decided that he, Montague, was to secure the\r\nbacking of the Fiji Government and that I was to bring in the financial\r\nand moral support of governments controlling the many Pacific groups\r\naround us.\r\n\r\nThese were long, long thoughts. But before his retirement Montague\r\nsaw two of his dreams, and mine, come true. The third was partially\r\nrealized and may be worked out fully in the end. I hope so, for the\r\nsake of a million patients.... I know that no man was ever more\r\ngenerously helped than I was, with the friendship of Montague on\r\nthe Government side and with Sir Maynard Hedstrom backing me in the\r\nLegislative Council. Hedstrom, by the way, always stood ready to act as\r\ninterpreter for my Yankee lingo and Yankee methods when I had to argue\r\nbefore cautious governors.\r\n\r\nThe practicability of a modernized native medical school came home\r\nto me. I had had a white man’s peep into the Melanesian mind;\r\nanthropologists rank him as the mental equal of the Caucasian; the\r\nPolynesian stands a grade higher intellectually, with the Japanese;\r\nwhile the Chinese heads the list. Environment, geography and tradition\r\nhave held so many races back that it is impossible to compare them with\r\nour own ingenious and self-destructive civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had gone over all this when Malakai, N.M.P., was sent to me, and my\r\nmind was made up.\r\n\r\nMalakai had been made Native Practitioner by the hit-or-miss of the\r\nold school. More than half self-educated, his inquisitive mind would\r\nnever let a subject go until he had mastered it. He was a cannibal’s\r\ngrandson, I have no doubt; so many of the best ones were. His favorite\r\ndish was scientific books, which he devoured.\r\n\r\nHe came to me, a slim young man of twenty with the fine bronze skin\r\nof the Melano-Polynesian mixture. Something of a dude, he wore a silk\r\n_lavalava_ down to his good Fijian knees. His English was imperfect\r\nthen. In 1924 when I went out on my series of group surveys, I showed\r\nhim around as a model for the proposed Native Medical Practitioner. He\r\nbecame the best microscopist among the thirty-odd I have trained; his\r\naccurate eyes became mine in a work for which poor sight unfitted me.\r\nMoreover, he was father, mother, son and valet to me. It was unseemly\r\nto set him to small drudgery. Malakai settled that question; when we\r\nwere in the field he invariably laid out my clean clothes, and did\r\nlaundry work among savages who were too ignorant for such things. At\r\nnight he gave me my quinine, and he was always the first up in the\r\nmorning. The old-time missionary who spoke of the Fijian as “inclined\r\nto indolence” should have met Malakai. Once when we were out in the\r\njungle my model N.M.P. fired the native cook and took over the job.\r\nCould he cook? Of course!\r\n\r\nI’m showing you Malakai, but not as a great exception among Fijians.\r\nThere are thousands of him on his home islands, only awaiting their\r\nchance; they’re the handiest people I’ve ever seen, adaptable, clever,\r\nwilling, loyal, dependable in emergency. Never once has a trusted\r\nFijian let me down, or failed to put up with hardship and smile in\r\nadversity. Treat them with the consideration they deserve, trust them\r\nas they should be trusted.... Well, I’ve seen many of their fine young\r\nmen come on, and I’m watching many on their way up....\r\n\r\nOn my return visit to Sikiana I was troubled by the number of enlarged\r\nspleens I found among the people. Malakai was the first to suggest a\r\nwide infection of malaria, but I pooh-poohed. Where were the anopheline\r\nmosquitoes? Malakai disappeared and came back smiling. “Doctor, I’ve\r\nlet them bite me. They stand on their heads to feed, and they have\r\nspotted wings.” He showed me several captured anopheles and saved me\r\nfrom being ridiculous in my report.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget his appearance when he came back from a later\r\nmission to the New Hebrides. He had served for a year and a half as\r\nthe only purely Condominium medical officer. Suddenly there came a\r\ncable: “HAVE QUITTED CONDOMINIUM, MALAKAI.” It was a matter of color.\r\nA newly-appointed official had been born on an island where nobody was\r\nexactly lily-white; so he was extremely race-sensitive, and insisted\r\non putting the boy from Fiji in his place. We welcomed Malakai back to\r\nSuva because we had let him go at a sacrifice in order to demonstrate\r\nthe efficiency of native doctors.\r\n\r\nThe picture of his getting off the boat was something to remember. He\r\nhad discarded the proud _lavalava_ for a pair of trousers. He merely\r\nsaid he liked them, and nobody could pry the real reason out of him.\r\nAbout a year later he showed up with a new silk _lavalava_, and was\r\nready to tell about the trousers. Down in the New Hebrides he had\r\nexperimented once too often with mosquitoes; an attack of malaria had\r\nmade his legs so thin that he was ashamed of them. The Fijian dandy’s\r\npride is in his swelling calves and slim ankles.\r\n\r\nIn 1926 when I was going from the New Hebrides to Sydney on the\r\n_Makambo_, Captain Tom Brown moved Malakai from second class to the\r\ncaptain’s table, a gesture of respect. On my return to the Cook Islands\r\nin 1932, the natives asked only two questions: Where was Malakai and\r\nwhat had I done with my big camera? I had been the fifth wheel in the\r\nwagon. For three years Malakai ran our yaws unit in Fiji. A European\r\ndoctor couldn’t have done the work as well with four times the money.\r\nMalakai’s unit was a model.\r\n\r\nA European Medical Officer on the Ellice group went alcoholic, so I\r\nsent Malakai down for six months. After we had to call him home the\r\nlocal District Officer almost challenged me to a duel; he was going\r\nhalf-crazy, he said, because deputations from surrounding islands were\r\npouring in, clamoring for Malakai’s services.\r\n\r\nMy young doctor’s addiction to silk neckties, silk shirts, silk\r\n_lavalavas_, fine coats, wrist watches, mandolins and guitars, once\r\nran him afoul of a Fijian custom called _kere kere_. The clans are\r\ncommunistic, and if you happen to be a clansman anything you have is\r\ntheirs by divine right. That’s why he returned from his home town\r\nlooking like a cat that had been dipped into the sea. His family\r\nhad trimmed him down to a ragged shirt and a cotton _lavalava_. The\r\nhighest-born Fijian may get this rummage sale welcome if he ventures\r\ninto the land of his birth. It quells ambition.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, belonged to the private life of Malakai. So did his\r\nmarriage to a handsome wife, who used to accompany him on his trips.\r\nWhen he started sailing alone I was afraid of trouble; Malakai,\r\ntemperamentally, would have made an ideal guardian for a very old\r\nTurk with a very large harem--no outside assistant would have been\r\nnecessary. Then there was the matter of his savings. Like all Pacific\r\nIslanders he had no idea of a money economy. Why save for a rainy day?\r\nThe sun will come out; it always does.\r\n\r\nLove came to Malakai’s life and money flew out of the window. I had\r\nbadgered him into putting £119 in a savings account; but Malakai got\r\nhold of the book. He was having wife-trouble. The first Mrs. Malakai\r\nwas barren, and the Fijian who hasn’t fathered a child is jeered at as\r\nsomething less than a proper man; sterility is grounds for divorce.\r\nMalakai had gone courting a native nurse, and the romance had dug\r\ndeep into his £119. He blew his whole remaining balance on a party to\r\nproclaim an approaching heir--on the sinister side. His fiancée was far\r\nfrom sterile--but how to give an honest name to the unborn Malakai,\r\nJunior?\r\n\r\nWell, I talked to Magistrate Burrowes, who obligingly called two\r\ndivorce hearings--and dismissed them both because neither Malakai nor\r\nhis friends, for inscrutable Fijian reasons, would testify to the fact.\r\nAt a third hearing Burrowes was in a sour temper. Bari and Rafaeli,\r\nMalakai’s friends, remained mum, but Malakai loosened up a little.\r\nAnnoyed, the magistrate penalized him three pounds a month out of his\r\nN.M.P. salary of nine pounds--probably the first alimony ever paid by\r\na Fijian. On the first of every month the retired Mrs. Malakai showed\r\nup to collect. She bled her ex-husband white as a Swede; then came\r\nto me for six months’ payment in advance to take her on a holiday\r\ntrip. I argued that three months’ cash in hand is worth a lifetime\r\nof installments in the bush. She fancied the idea, and finally for\r\nfifteen pounds spot-on-the-counter surrendered Malakai for life. Now\r\nshe could buy presents, buy clothes, go home, save her face. And, quite\r\nnaturally, pick out a husband. Honor was satisfied. Another instance of\r\nnative money psychology.\r\n\r\nIn 1936 Malakai went to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands as Senior\r\nMedical Practitioner. When he left there, it required two Europeans\r\nto fill his post. He came back to Fiji in 1939, a few days before I\r\nretired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his ability and in his foibles Malakai was all Fijian. He settled my\r\ndetermination on higher education for such men. Dr. Montague was in the\r\nmood for it. If we could have taken that bull by the horns in 1922-1923\r\nour enthusiasm might have swept in the political consent and money\r\nbacking of at least eight great island groups. All we needed was the\r\npartnership of the Rockefeller Foundation. That, I guessed, was merely\r\na matter of asking.\r\n\r\nMy guess was wrong. I wrote a detailed letter to Dr. Victor Heiser and\r\noutlined our plan. Just a little school with forty undergraduates, to\r\nstart with. It could be an adjunct to the new hospital in Suva, but\r\nneed not be an expensive set of buildings. Dr. Montague’s plans were\r\nmodest in price and extremely practical. Governor Sir Eyre Hutson was\r\nenthusiastic. Administrators on distant island groups were begging for\r\nit. Now was the time.\r\n\r\nArdently I wrote:\r\n\r\n The Foundation gives cheerfully to help medical schools for Chinese,\r\n Spanish, English and what you please, to people who are better able to\r\n help themselves than these poor blacks out here who are as eager for a\r\n chance of this sort as ever a white man was. The Board could give this\r\n school and fund half of a teacher’s salary; the other half might be\r\n made up by the different groups ... the money would produce results at\r\n a far higher rate than in England or Canada....\r\n\r\nThe reply came from 61 Broadway. Dr. Heiser with his usual sagacity\r\nhad found the plan reasonable and practical. But the Foundation is so\r\nvast that it must be zoned into many divisions, such as a Division of\r\nMedical Sciences, a Division of Social Sciences, a Division of the\r\nHumanities, and so on. And the Division of Medical Sciences was dead\r\nagainst us; it was out for ambitious projects, and thought mine very\r\nthird-rate indeed. Rockefeller millions were going into the great\r\nestablishment in Peking. No use throwing good money after bad, on\r\nlittle squirt schools in the Pacific. After years of my dinging away at\r\nthe subject, Heiser himself grew cold and asked me to forget it. Peking\r\nand many others were the big health investments....\r\n\r\nWell, where is Peking today, after the Japanese have finished? And\r\nFiji? I’m saving that information for dessert.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the ironies of our times, and a quaint one, that the\r\nRockefeller Foundation mailed the Japanese a large check for their\r\nPublic Health School on the same day the Mikado’s army bombed to powder\r\na beautiful library which the Foundation had given to Chungking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA DOCTOR EX OFFICIO\r\n\r\n\r\nI was a dog without a collar, medically speaking. Official Fiji\r\nhad heard about the avaricious Yankee, planting himself on foreign\r\nsoil to amass a dishonest fortune. In 1922 a law was passed, for\r\nmy personal benefit, to the effect that no American could practise\r\nmedicine in Fiji without a “special permit.” The special permit was\r\nfar less potent than a chauffeur’s license, and my official status,\r\nif any, was somewhat lower than that of the N.M.P. (Native Medical\r\nPractitioner). Until 1937 I was not legally qualified to treat anything\r\nbut hookworm. In the meantime I had treated and been responsible for\r\nthe care of hundreds of thousands of cases of hookworm, yaws, malaria,\r\ntuberculosis, ringworm and so on. Come to think of it, I hadn’t been a\r\nlawfully qualified physician in Papua and New Guinea. When Dr. McGusty\r\ncame to power in Suva, he huffed and he puffed and he said, “All\r\nnonsense!”--and proceeded to get me a respectable license. In 1937 the\r\nEmpire discovered that I was in Fiji, and I joined the British Medical\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nNot that it mattered. Montague and I were together, never slipping a\r\ncog. He wasn’t the sort who fishes for praise, and he never failed to\r\ngive me credit, if credit were due.\r\n\r\nFiji was a case of racial decline, with a trend upward. Briefly, the\r\npopulation fell from its 200,000 in the hearty cannibal days of 1870\r\nto 105,000 in the Christian year 1891. The census of 1905 showed an\r\nappalling drop to 87,000; epidemics of endemic dysentery and whooping\r\ncough had decimated them every year; then measles swooped down on these\r\nnon-immunes. A pause in the death rate, and in 1911 a slight increase\r\nin population which was to continue until 1917 when there were 91,000\r\nliving Fijians. They might have risen in eight years to the 1891 level\r\nbut for the withering blast of influenza in 1918-1919. Once again they\r\nrecovered from a low of around 82,000 until the New Year of 1937 showed\r\na population of 98,291.\r\n\r\nDiscounting the World War’s gift of flu, which baffled all medicine,\r\nFiji shows how the gradual fall in the death rate can almost be\r\nmeasured in terms of medical effort. I wish we could be smug and say\r\nthat the trick is turned, both in Fiji and Western Polynesia. But\r\nthere’s the other puzzling factor: the East Indian.\r\n\r\nToday in Suva the tourist admires the picturesqueness of these\r\nAsiatics, brightening the streets with turbans and silken _saris_. In\r\nthe early ’80’s they were first brought in as laborers, and succeeding\r\nshiploads increased them to 50,000. With natural progeny they grew to\r\nsome 85,000, by the 1936 census. Fiji colonials began by believing that\r\nsuch immigrants were needed for industrial development; but in 1916 the\r\nindenturing of Indians ceased. Since then more of them have left than\r\nhave entered. Those who leave are usually old; the re-entering ones are\r\nusually young adults.\r\n\r\nDuring forty-five years the Indian birth rate far surpassed the Fijian.\r\nThe steadier Fijian rate shows a rise. In the early ’90’s there was\r\nan excess of 7,000 native males over females, but the margin steadily\r\nnarrowed until 1936 when the excess was reduced to 2,087. This\r\nindicates a healthy tendency. But wait. The Colony’s annual medical and\r\nhealth reports, 1921-1936, show that the Indian woman outbreeds the\r\nFijian woman by 25 per cent; soon the Indian population must overtake\r\nthe native Fijian. There is a greater loss by death among Fijians than\r\namong Indians. The Fijians lose more people from tuberculosis than the\r\nIndians do _from all causes_; the Fijians lose more children under\r\nfive than the Indians do _from all causes_; the Fijians lose more from\r\ncauses other than tuberculosis and death under five than the Indians do\r\n_from all causes_.\r\n\r\nAdd this up. Fijian mortality is three times that of the Indian, and\r\nthe fertility of the Indian woman is 25 per cent higher than that of\r\nthe Fijian woman.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in Fiji are survivals of thousands of ancestral generations\r\nof exposure to disease. Fiji with her better food, wages, housing and\r\nfree medical attention was an unmixed blessing to these newcomers.\r\nFar from the teeming Punjab they dropped the shackles of caste, and\r\nbrought with them a devouring hunger for land and freedom. The larger\r\nthe family the larger the workable holdings; and there is no stigma on\r\nillegitimacy.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 the East Indians were spreading. Today they are spreading\r\neven faster until Fiji is threatened with becoming an annex to India.\r\nThe Asiatic population is running about neck-and-neck with the native.\r\nSomething should be done about it, of course, but what? Is it survival\r\nof the fittest? Not entirely. It is partly the artificial stimulation\r\ngiven to the oriental through medical science and a vastly improved\r\nenvironment. Some evils have come with the banishment of their old\r\ncaste system. There is no longer the invisible barrier between Hindu,\r\nBrahman, Chamar, Pariah--and Moslem. The Indian found a new freedom\r\nin the tropic isles, and the immigrants were mostly very low-caste.\r\nTheir ideals were vague, their women scarce, the recruiting system led\r\nto degeneracy, the marriage tie weakened, little girls were offered\r\nfor barter. Cult priests from India would froth up fanaticism and\r\nloud-mouthed little Gandhis kept the pot boiling. India’s Nationalist\r\nMovement made a pretty mess of attempted social equality. The Indians\r\nhad been allotted three seats on the Legislative Council on an\r\nequality with elected Fijian chiefs. The Asiatic members put up a howl\r\nfor a common franchise, and when this was defeated in council, they\r\npromptly resigned. Then came the school question. It was fantastically\r\nimpossible for the Government to build the hundred schools which the\r\nIndians demanded, while they declined to contribute their share to\r\nGovernment-fostered mission and private schools. So about a sixth of\r\ntheir children went without education.\r\n\r\nI am taking no sides. I only report that the Indians are becoming\r\nconquerors by infiltration of an archipelago where the native deserves\r\nhis own land and customs. In Fiji the Asiatic is developing a kindly\r\nfraternalism which Mother India never quite crushed out of him. Very\r\noften when one of them has been stranded in India, after a holiday, his\r\nfriends in Fiji--Hindu, Pariah and Moslem--will chip in on a purse to\r\nfetch him back. At one time in our Suva household we had three Indian\r\nservants of three discordant faiths: a Hindu cook, a Moslem gardener,\r\na Christian chambermaid. Back in the old home-town they might have cut\r\neach other’s throats every morning before breakfast. But here it was\r\nthe song of songs, close harmony. I wish Eloisa had them now....\r\n\r\nNo, I am not against the experiment to bring back the East Indian. Only\r\nI wish they hadn’t tried it on Fiji, whose native people I have learned\r\nto love deeply.\r\n\r\nNow how about the Fijian?\r\n\r\nWhen you number his islands at 250 you include large Viti Levu, which\r\nbulks about 4,000 square miles, and its slenderer, somewhat smaller\r\nsister Vanua Levu to the northeast; then there is a scattering of\r\nfair-sized fellows scaling down to mere pin-points on the map. If some\r\nsuper-Hitler should decide to combine them there would be enough to\r\nfill New Jersey, almost. They are heavenly things, the tiny islands,\r\nwith rounded bases of iron-brown rock and palms dipping toward the sea;\r\nso many fern baskets set around surprising blue inlets--blue and silver\r\nin the morning. Then you coast around toward larger footholds, elegant\r\ncliffs with threads of waterfall and great white shells on the shore,\r\nlike bleaching skulls. In summer, which is December, the thermometer\r\nseldom rises above ninety-two degrees, and July Fourth is in the very\r\necstasy of spring. I have no real estate to sell in Fiji. So I speak\r\nonly out of a homesick heart when I say that it is the best winter\r\nclimate in the world, and the best climate, any time, for me.\r\n\r\nEarly discoverers called it “Feejee,” although the official name is\r\nFiji--and that, too, is wrong. The correct name for it is Viti. Captain\r\nCook made the mistake when he touched at the Tongan Islands, near\r\nneighbors, and heard the Polynesians say “Viti” in their own way. This\r\ngroup was honestly named “the Cannibal Islands.” The transit of fierce\r\ntribes from man-eating to prayer-meeting is miraculous. In 1927 when\r\nMartin Egan, as a traveler, saw a long file of sedate natives going\r\nto church, he remarked, “From Cannibalism to Calvinism!” And this\r\ndescribes it, although the predominant Church happens to be Wesleyan.\r\nIt is almost impossible to believe that these quiet, law-abiding people\r\nhave emerged so soon and gone so far.\r\n\r\nThe Fijians not only were cannibals, but were inordinately cruel. When\r\na chief’s dwelling was being built captives were made to stand in the\r\npostholes “to hold up the house,” and were buried alive. A chief’s\r\ncanoe was launched over living bodies, human rollers. When there was\r\na shortage of enemy meat, hunters would stalk women and children of\r\ntheir own tribe; women and children were regarded as delicacies fit for\r\nvisiting chiefs. When there were plenty of captives the resident chief\r\nwould order out his livestock in the morning, to choose his meat. If\r\none of them sneezed, which was considered an evidence of cowardice,\r\nthe chief would cry “_Mbula!_” which meant, disdainfully, “I give\r\nyou life.” No proper man ever ate coward-meat. Then the sneezer would\r\nreply, “_Moli_,” which meant, in effect, “Your words are like the sweet\r\njuice of the orange to me.” The word “_Mbula_” is often heard today,\r\na pleasant greeting: “How’s your health?” “_Mbula vinaka_” is like a\r\ncasual “My health is good.”\r\n\r\nI am not so sure that their cannibalism was not caused originally by a\r\nprotein shortage. There were no four-footed animals, with the possible\r\nexception of the rat. The Fijian fainted at sight of the first horse,\r\nas the Aztec did before Cortes’ ponies. Old tales tell of a maniacal\r\nblood-lust: How the father of King Thakombau cut out a disobedient\r\nbrother’s tongue, roasted and ate it. How Thakombau (Evil of Mbau)\r\nperformed the same feat on the severed arm of a living captive....\r\nWidowhood was handled with frightful practicality: during a husband’s\r\nfuneral the widow would lay her head in the lap of a seated woman, who\r\nwould put one hand over the widow’s mouth, the other at the back of her\r\nneck; and a relative, sometimes a son, would string a vine around her\r\nneck and finish the job.\r\n\r\nIf some man of the tribe would come forward and claim her, the widow\r\nwas spared. The very word for widow, _dawai_, is still an abusive term.\r\nLittle girls who were betrothed to little boys had the vine-noose\r\nalways waiting. If the boy happened to die it was etiquette to strangle\r\nthe girl and toss her in his grave. Sometimes she was given a chance to\r\nreturn to her parents and try another marriage. Frequently the parents\r\nwere so devil-ridden that they sent her back to the executioner. Yet\r\nthe Fijians were, and are, a child-loving people. I cannot believe that\r\nthe custom-bound parents who led their daughter back to death were not\r\ntorn with genuine grief; the nice name for daughter is “rafter of the\r\nhouse.” The widow who was nursing a child or was pregnant was sent home\r\nto her father’s house and lived out her natural life.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial over a dead chief would go on for a long time, at\r\nintervals. In a hundred days came the final feast. Some of the warriors\r\nwould show up with a finger or two missing. They had cut them off as an\r\nexpression of grief.\r\n\r\nThe first and last King of the Cannibal Islands was named Thakombau,\r\nand since most history books spell him “Cakobau” I must dwell on a\r\ntrick of Fijian spelling that has driven native schoolboys to despair.\r\nJohann Sebastian Bach, descendant of the great composer and for years\r\nFiji’s public printer, told me how this mad spelling came about so that\r\nthe island of Mbengga, for instance, is printed “Beqa.” In the early\r\ndays the man who did the missionaries’ printing ran short of type. In\r\nFijian every _g_ and _d_ has an _n_ sound in front of it, so to save\r\n_n’s_, none were used, the _n_ sound being understood in front of each\r\n_g_ and _d_. Every Fijian _b_ has an _m_ sound in front of it so that\r\nletter was understood there and dropped. The plentiful _th_ sound ran\r\nthe printer out of that character, so he substituted _c_ for _th_ as\r\nthere is no other use for _c_ in Fijian. The common _ngg_ was replaced\r\nby a handy _q_. A full account of this typographical theory would\r\nrequire pages, but I hope I have outlined the principle, which shows\r\nsome remarkable results.\r\n\r\nThis King called Thakombau (and spelled Cakobau) offers an example of\r\nthe native money sense, that perfect vacuum. His warriors had been\r\nmerrily destroying American trading establishments, and missions,\r\noccasionally pausing to eat the inhabitants. In 1858 President Buchanan\r\nsent the _Vandalia_ to press a claim for a $45,000 indemnity. The\r\nwarships looked mighty strong, and Thakombau wasn’t getting on very\r\nwell with his revolutions; the one way out seemed to be to sell his\r\nmess of empire for the debt. He offered the bargain to the United\r\nStates and to England, but found no takers.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 home politics changed the British mind. According to current\r\nmyth Thakombau was beleaguered on Mbau’s Gibraltar-rock when a British\r\nman o’ war lay handily offshore. A well-armed landing party scattered\r\nthe besiegers, brought the King back to his tapa-lined house, and saw\r\nhim make a cross on a paper which mentioned the payment of debt and\r\nthe delivery of the Fijis, body, soul and breeches. The story is close\r\nenough to the truth. A little later Britain accepted the Fijis. King\r\nThakombau finished with a pretty gesture when he handed over his war\r\nclub as a present to Queen Victoria. Probably she never used it, but\r\nher heart was gratified when she learned that the deposed monarch had\r\nexchanged cannibalism for Christianity. He burned most of the heathen\r\ntemples in his fading realm, but saved his own on Mbau--for sentiment’s\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nThe chastened Thakombau took to travel, and did his bit toward\r\nimporting foreign disease. In 1876 he came back from Australia with a\r\ndose of measles, which he spread far and wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHOW THE ANSWER CAME\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Fiji we started out directly for cure and prevention, an active\r\ncampaign. Chris Kendrick was still with me, my gem of the first water;\r\nMalakai was a newly discovered diamond.\r\n\r\nOn my first tour I saw filthy sanitary arrangements, or none at all.\r\nBy education we tried to induce the natives and oriental transplant\r\nto use ordinary cesspit latrines; our efforts met with more success\r\nafter the discovery of a new internal remedy had rewarded us with\r\npublic approval and made the Fijians health-conscious. From then on\r\nthe pathway was cleared for all our efforts. Dr. Heiser, when he\r\nvisited us in 1928, introduced the bored-hole latrine, which was the\r\nFoundation’s enthusiasm at that time. It was a twenty-five-foot hole\r\ndug with an eighteen-inch auger, which was a practical benefit to the\r\nEast Indian in Fiji; but, for the native, the deep pit, covered with a\r\npolished concrete slab--which we were by then making and distributing\r\nby thousands--was by far the better sanitation.\r\n\r\nDr. Heiser came out again in 1934. In his _An American Doctor’s\r\nOdyssey_ he was kind enough to report those two visits at some length.\r\nOn his latter trip we made the surveys together and looked over results\r\nof our bored-hole work. I have a pleasant memory of our expeditions;\r\nhow he belied his sixty-third birthday when his long legs walked me\r\nlame in Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. We argued like a pair of plumbers on\r\na holiday; subject, Bored Latrine versus Cesspit. I contended that\r\nthe deep auger-hole was all right for the delicately built Indian,\r\nbut, even then, in rocky or sandy soil it was no good at all. And for\r\nFijians it wouldn’t work. Why? In a land where the natives use palm\r\nleaves, breadfruit leaves, stones, coconut husks and hanks of wild\r\ngrass for toilet purposes, a narrow tube in the ground gets stopped\r\nup in less time than it takes to bore it. Then the chap takes to the\r\nbush, as of old. It has nothing to do with science, it’s just practical\r\nmechanics, plus tradition. Our debate had this effect at least; we\r\nlater modified the bored-hole latrine with a much larger hole, but\r\nretained the concrete slab, which was admired by barefoot natives for\r\nits reliable cleanliness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut in 1922, as a newcomer in Fiji and with only such authority as I\r\ncould get by talking myself into it, this broken jigsaw puzzle looked\r\nto me like something no mere human hands could put together. I was\r\na health officer on a rather large scale with nothing so much as a\r\ndog license to show for it. It was pretty discouraging, at first.\r\nI was like a fireman with a leaky hose, trying to stop a blaze at\r\none end of a building while an incendiary poured gasoline on the\r\nother. The government health authorities had a right to mourn over\r\nthe Foundation’s recent attempt to kill the all-pervading parasite.\r\nEverywhere I went I saw how little the good work had accomplished.\r\nChris Kendrick would come back from treatments in outlying districts\r\nand smile ruefully. “They’re quite a mess out there.” Like all of us,\r\nhe was losing faith in chenopodium; and Chris Kendrick’s faith would\r\nstand a good deal of punishment.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I was working vigorously to educate the natives in the\r\nnature of various parasites and the virtue of treatment. And I was\r\npumping up British enthusiasm with every publicity device I could lay\r\nmy hands on. As I tooted the Horn of Health they began to look upon\r\nme as Barnum’s little brother with a rich strain of Rockefeller in me\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nOne of my less dignified efforts along the line of health-advertising\r\nwas a window display I devised for Pop Swann’s drugstore, prominent\r\non Suva’s main street. Pop was a stanch friend of medical progress.\r\nSo it didn’t take long to convince him that an attractive display of\r\nintestinal parasites would help both his business and mine. Most of\r\nhis customers were Fijians and East Indians, so nothing could be more\r\nlogical. “Anything in the world to push things along, my boy,” said\r\nenthusiastic Pop. Between us we set up a charming arrangement in the\r\ntwo windows on either side of his street door, where all who passed\r\ncould wonder and admire: worms of every variety in the big gallon\r\nbottles they call “Winchesters.” Tapeworms of infinite length slithered\r\naround in alcohol; families of _Necator americanus_ swam cozily beside\r\na jugful of oriental Ankylostoma; there was a large bottle devoted\r\nto the fat roundworms, nearly a foot long, and to the screw-headed\r\nwhipworms, and to other, less notorious wrigglers. Pop Swann rubbed his\r\nhands as we stood outside gloating over our work in the two windows\r\nthat fledged his main door. “Doc,” chuckled Pop, “that ought to draw\r\ncustomers, if anything will!”\r\n\r\nThen a very busy week, uphill and down dale, organizing the campaign\r\nand pushing it along. One day, going by Pop Swann’s, my way was\r\nblockaded by a semicircle of Indians and Fijians, standing at a\r\nrespectful distance from the great exhibition. Out of the door burst\r\nPop, hair on end. “Doc,” he shouted, “for the love of God take those\r\nthings out of my windows. The natives are so scared they won’t pass in\r\nbetween those worms. You’re ruining my trade!”\r\n\r\nSo I dewormed the window and time marched on. But it wasn’t marching\r\nwell for me, or in the right direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne late afternoon in February, 1922, I keeled back in my office chair\r\nand appreciated the soreness a middle-aged prize fighter must feel\r\nafter he has taken the count in round one. With a sanitary squad of\r\nnine native and Indian assistants and the invaluable Chris Kendrick\r\nI had again made a round and seen the dank hopelessness of two races\r\nweakened by their own customs and by the unfriendly acts of nature.\r\nIt was just as Paley had shown: rainfall flooded their shallow wells\r\nand mixed with the foulness of their latrines so that both wells and\r\nlatrines had the same bacterial flora. In some districts hookworm\r\ninfection ran as high as 98 per cent. This condition was not limited to\r\nprimitive natives by any means; the Hindu and Moslem of ancient culture\r\nwere quite as ignorant of sanitation, and more worm-laden than their\r\ndark brown brothers.\r\n\r\nThis filthy stable must be cleaned, but the baffling thing was to find\r\nthe cure. Our International Health Board was sharing expenses with\r\nthe Government for a three-year campaign. The question of throwing\r\ngood money after bad had come up again. Officially, I should have been\r\npro-chenopodium. Actually that drug was the first word in my Hymn of\r\nHate. And the discouraging thing was this: despite the crucial need of\r\nhygienic improvements, an effective cure must take first place as an\r\neducational demonstration. If you destroy all the hookworms inside the\r\nhuman body, no more of their eggs will fall to the ground to hatch the\r\nlarvae that make the worms that suck the blood.... The whole Jack-built\r\nsong of consequences with a tropical setting. Sounds very simple,\r\ndoesn’t it? So does astronomy.\r\n\r\nI sat at my desk, facing facts and not liking a single one of them.\r\nEvening was coming on and I should have been home for dinner. I was too\r\nsick of myself and my work to move a muscle. Three more years of this,\r\nand where would it get us? Nowhere.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was my guardian angel who stole up and laid a still hand over\r\nmine. Without knowing what I did or why I did it, I moved my hand\r\nacross the desk and woke, blinking. I had picked up the Journal of the\r\n_American Medical Association_, a November 1921 issue, and an invisible\r\nfinger seemed to point the page for me. And there was the title: “The\r\nUse of Carbon Tetrachloride in the Removal of Hookworm ... by Maurice\r\nC. Hall.” Hall was the man who approved my experiment down in Rabaul\r\nwhen I gave those injections to six cannibal prisoners. I respected\r\nhim, as most of the profession did. As Senior Zoologist of the United\r\nStates Bureau of Animal Industry, his researches had gone far in his\r\nown field. He didn’t talk unless he knew what he was talking about.\r\n\r\nHere was Hall’s report in the modest gray of scientific language,\r\nrevealing years of most careful observation. His tests had led him\r\nto a novel drug--carbon tetrachloride. Queer, humble thing to have\r\nfished out of the pharmacopoeia! Hitherto it had been useful only\r\nin dry-cleaning fluids and fire extinguishers. He had observed that\r\npatients under chloroform anesthesia frequently emit a number of\r\nintestinal parasites. Chloroform, then, would be a successful vermifuge\r\nwere it not for its poisonous qualities. Hall made hundreds of tests\r\ndown the list of Hydrocarbons until he came to chloroform’s close\r\nrelation. Chloroform’s chemical initials are CHCl₃. Tetrachloride’s\r\nlaboratory name is CCl₄.\r\n\r\nTetrachloride touched the spot Hall had been looking for. He tried it\r\nfirst on dogs, then on swine, horses, monkeys. He carefully gauged\r\nthe dosage to 3 cc. for every 10 pounds of animal weight; later he\r\nfound that O.3 cc. to every kilogram of body-weight expelled the\r\nworms in surprising quantities. After treatment he had performed\r\npostmortems on many animals and had examined internal organs which\r\nshowed no pathological changes that could be traced to CCl₄. In animal\r\nexperimentation it had been an unqualified success.\r\n\r\nIn animals, yes. But what of man?\r\n\r\nThe answer came like a clap of thunder out of Hall’s quietest\r\nparagraph. _He had tried the stuff on himself._ Audaciously he had\r\ntaken a 3 cc. dose, gone to bed and wakened in the morning with no\r\npathological symptoms. The dangerous drops he had swigged the night\r\nbefore had had none of the nauseous effects of chenopodium. His animal\r\nexperiments had shown him that it worked as fast, as safely and more\r\nthoroughly. And here was another point in its favor: tetrachloride\r\ntried on animals seemed to have no ill effects on pregnancy.\r\nChenopodium had always been a dangerous thing to give a woman with\r\nchild. It was, at times, among the unsafe abortifacients--often\r\neffective if used up to the poison point.\r\n\r\nThe message of tetrachloride came to me like an answer to prayer. But\r\nwould the dog-cure turn out to be a man-killer? Probably not. _Hall had\r\ntried it on himself._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a hop, skip and jump I went to the laboratory used by the Medical\r\nOfficer of Health. Naturally old Carment, who presided over the\r\ncollection, wouldn’t have the drug. Why should he? Yes, but there it\r\nwas! A big, brown bottle with the label CCl₄. It had never been opened,\r\nof course, and how it got there nobody knows. Strange, useless things\r\ndrift onto laboratory shelves.\r\n\r\nWhen I went up to Dr. Montague’s office I had the brown bottle under\r\none arm and the _Medical Journal_ under the other. “Read that and look\r\nat this,” I said. He read the article painstakingly, then turned the\r\nbottle in his hand. “Lambert, try anything,” he sighed. That was about\r\nthe way we all felt those days.\r\n\r\nWe had been trained in the empirical school. Try anything, if evidence\r\nis in its favor. Even the jungle medicine man, for all his black\r\nmagic, has herbs and simples which the respectable practitioner might\r\ninclude in his remedies. A thousand years before Harvey demonstrated\r\nthe blood’s circulation Asiatic wizards were giving chaulmoogra oil\r\nfor leprosy--true, they gave it wrong, but they gave it. The Incas of\r\nPeru taught us the value of quinine for malaria; they chewed the bark.\r\nBefore the Crusades, corner barbers were giving mercury to syphilitic\r\nnoblemen. Up to fifty years ago the medical profession depended pretty\r\nmuch on the household remedies your grandmother used to choke down\r\nyou; as long as they worked they saved many a fine prescription in\r\nabbreviated Latin.\r\n\r\nThe old empiricals had moved along that line. But men of the new\r\nthought, like Pasteur, like Ehrlich, had set out deliberately to fit a\r\ndrug to a condition. And that was how Hall had worked.\r\n\r\nSo we were trying to cure hookworm disease with a cleaning fluid. A\r\nveterinary had recommended it. True, he was about the greatest vet in\r\nthe world. I have to laugh now, remembering how we, as green young\r\nundergraduates at Syracuse Medical, used to snoot veterinaries and\r\ndentists as “hoss doctors” and “tooth yankers.” We didn’t take the\r\ntrouble to remember that modern anesthesia originated in a dentist’s\r\nbrain. And since we lacked the gift of prophecy, how were we to know\r\nwhat a horse doctor would someday do with something out of a fire\r\nextinguisher?\r\n\r\nMy mind was made up, but my heart wasn’t doing any too well when I\r\nwent to the native ward and picked out four hookwormy East Indians.\r\nI wasn’t sure how these follows would behave, for Mr. Gandhi’s Civil\r\nDisobedience had become their evening prayer. However, they felt pretty\r\nsick and were ready, like Montague, to say, “Try anything.” I started\r\nthem off with a stiff dose of salts.\r\n\r\nAt seven next morning my faltering hand administered to each of them 3\r\ncc. out of the brown bottle. The minute they swallowed it I felt like\r\na Borgia. It was too late to do anything about it, unless I gave them\r\na quick emetic. If tetrachloride went back on me I’d be responsible\r\nfor the death of a man, maybe four. Doctors have to become hardened to\r\ndeath, otherwise they couldn’t remain in practice. But experimental\r\nkilling is a different thing. If any of these Hindus died I’d have the\r\nweight on my soul. Not only that, I’d lose my job.... Already I saw\r\nmy resignation from the International Health Board being requested by\r\ncable.\r\n\r\nI steadied myself with an argument: If the Fiji campaign failed along\r\nthe old line that wouldn’t be any feather in my cap either. Well, I\r\nwas deciding something on a very long chance.... My stomach went back\r\non me, foolishly reflecting the pain of my victims. Solid food didn’t\r\nappeal, so I breakfasted on a pint of coffee, embittered with a new\r\ntorment. Why hadn’t I taken tetrachloride myself, before I tried it on\r\nthose Indians?[3]\r\n\r\n_Dr. Hall had taken a dose of it._\r\n\r\nI had dosed my four Indians at seven, and time was wearing on.\r\nTetrachloride, which is a purgative, should have acted quicker. The men\r\nwere dumb and drowsy. Would this be coma? I felt their lean wrists,\r\nlistened to their lean chests; pulse and respiration normal. How soon\r\nwould they take a turn for the worse?\r\n\r\n_Dr. Hall had taken a dose of it._\r\n\r\nYes, but Hall had been in the prime of health, able to throw off toxic\r\npoisoning. These poor fellows were like dry leaves. The very thing that\r\nmade treatment necessary had weakened them to the exhaustion point....\r\nThen I thought: Even if I had drugged myself with the stuff it wouldn’t\r\nhave proved much; what I was trying to find out was its actual effect\r\non hookworm....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had wandered back to my office, hoping that solitude and a cigarette\r\nmight tell me what to do next.... The door burst open and Chris\r\nKendrick tumbled in on me. His look was grave as he said, “That\r\ntetrachloride--”\r\n\r\n“Are they dead?” I asked stiffly.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” Chris waved his hands. “They’re all jumping out of bed, and\r\nsimply spouting hookworms!”\r\n\r\nThat was how the news came to me. I had been watching them for hours\r\nwhile local medical officers passed their beds and made long faces\r\nwhich said to my fevered imagination, “See what Lambert’s done now!”\r\nThen the minute I turned my back CCl₄ had begun to work. For three\r\ndays while my Indians were, as Chris exaggerated it, “fairly spouting\r\nworms,” the result was a constant wonder. Cordiality glowed in an\r\natmosphere which had been none too warm. Doctors gathered around our\r\nhookworm count like baseball fans around the box score. The native\r\norderlies were as excited as the rest. First day, second day, third....\r\nI had gambled with four lives, and won. I call that Tetrachloride\r\nExperiment Number 2, since Hall swallowed the first dose; and\r\nExperiment Number 2 was a surprising success. Between them my patients\r\nhad expelled 244 worms after a single dose. The following week we gave\r\nthem a test treatment with chenopodium--and only got four Necators. The\r\nman I mark down as Case 1 expelled none at all. The other three needed\r\nno follow-up treatment. In three days Case 1 had shed ninety-five\r\nhookworms, and all were discharged as cured. One dose of CCl₄, mind\r\nyou, had proven 99 per cent perfect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMine was the embarrassment of riches. I had worked for the Foundation\r\ntoo long to believe that they would approve of wholesale treatments\r\nwith so new and untried a drug. If I went on with tetrachloride, as I\r\nfelt I must do, the only way was to go ahead and say nothing about it.\r\n\r\nDr. Montague’s enthusiasm was as great as mine, but I moved\r\ncautiously at first. The next set of East Indians I tried it on was\r\nless satisfactory than the original four. It wasn’t the fault of\r\ntetrachloride, but of Gandhi; his sick disciples were so independent\r\nthat they threw their specimens out of the window before we could make\r\nan accurate worm-count. We recovered enough, however, to keep Kendrick\r\nand his force of Fijian helpers pretty busy going over the thin\r\nwashings spread out on tightly stretched gauze.\r\n\r\nI look over some of the reports of those experimental days and read:--\r\n\r\n ... Almost total lack of symptoms in the group that received the purge\r\n after the drug. Not one of them was incapacitated for his regular\r\n duties ... with no after-purge there were some who had minor symptoms.\r\n Many were sleepy for several hours....\r\n\r\n ... Young Indian working in our office given 3 cc. at 7:45 A.M. ...\r\n by 10:15 gave 85 hookworms. Total for three days 101. Test treatment\r\n showed he was cured. This illustrates the rapid expulsion of worms by\r\n this drug, which we have observed generally.\r\n\r\nThe time came when I felt that the whole thing was too important to\r\nkeep to myself, so I wrote a careful letter to the Foundation. The\r\nanswer from 61 Broadway with its code-name “Rockfound” was cabled back\r\nso fast that it burned a streak across the Pacific: “FORBID USE. WE DO\r\nNOT EXPERIMENT WITH HUMAN LIFE.”\r\n\r\nI took the limp message to Dr. Montague and said, “Well, the jig’s up.\r\nI’m forbidden to play with fire extinguishers.”\r\n\r\nMontague thought a long time. Tetrachloride was God’s gift to Fiji, he\r\nsaid, and he didn’t intend to give it up. He was recommending it for\r\nall the institutions under his authority.\r\n\r\nThen I found an out. I asked, “Do you authorize me, as your\r\nsubordinate, to continue its use? Would you O.K. a letter to that\r\neffect?” He said he would, and he did. After that I heard no more\r\nobjections from the Foundation, whose administrators were only too\r\nglad, of course, to have the drug tried out on a large scale, as long\r\nas the Government of Fiji took the responsibility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp to the time when I grew bolder and dosed a whole large Indian\r\nschool, the new treatment had been tried very quietly. Then it got\r\ntoo public to be kept away from the press. It was at the Dilkusha\r\nMission that we gave this first “mass treatment”--the only practical\r\nway of administering a cure to the many. Before that it had been a\r\nmatter of tedious house-to-house canvas. At Dilkusha we lined up 400\r\nchildren, and I was about as jittery as I had been when I tackled the\r\nfour adults at the War Memorial. But I went away smiling, a little\r\ncocky about myself. One dose of tetrachloride had removed 99 per cent\r\nof the infestation. Meanwhile in Suva Jail Dr. Kalamkar, East Indian\r\nphysician, had run up a score of 94.5.\r\n\r\nAll this was news, and Suva had an editor with a keenly developed\r\nnews-sense. His name was Victor Abel, and among other bold enterprises\r\nhe ran a paper called the _Pacific Age_. A daring young chap of a\r\ngood Anglo-Jewish family, he had raised mules in South Africa, made\r\na failure of it, then come to Fiji to raise hogs, and made a failure\r\nof that too. His influential father-in-law was Sir Henry Marks, who\r\nworried a great deal about the _Pacific Age_.\r\n\r\nSir Henry had set his cap for a place on the Executive Council, and\r\nyou never could tell what the incorrigible Victor would say next to\r\nstir up the Government. The town was always agog, waiting for some new\r\noutbreak in his personal correspondence column. It was a completely\r\nopen forum, that column; under all sorts of fancy _noms de plume_\r\ncitizens let each other have it, straight in the nose. Then, just to\r\nkeep the pot boiling, they would change their _noms de plume_ overnight\r\nand start thundering on the left. When Victor decided to write anything\r\nup he trimmed it artistically. For example, there was his famous\r\naccount of the government yacht left in Suva harbor with her seacocks\r\nopen. She gently sank, while the officers and crew were ashore seeing a\r\nfootball game.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of our growing campaign Victor came to me and said he was\r\npretty sure he had hookworm. He had; and tetrachloride did its work\r\nvery nicely. “Listen, Doctor,” he said, “what about this magic stuff?\r\nWhere did it come from? What’s the story? Are you going to bury big\r\nnews like that in Suva? Tell me about it, let me put it on the wire and\r\nI’ll have the whole world sitting up.”\r\n\r\nBy that time Fiji was certainly sitting up. Natives were clamoring for\r\ntreatment. Not until the gold rush of ’32 was anything more generally\r\ntalked about. I wanted Victor to have the story; I said to Victor, “You\r\ncan run the story provided you keep me out of it--and don’t mention the\r\nFoundation, either. Just say that Maurice C. Hall’s treatment is being\r\ngiven. If that’s understood, here are the facts.”\r\n\r\nVictor kept his word in an appropriately sensational style, proclaiming\r\nthat Maurice C. Hall was curing hookworm with a thing called\r\ntetrachloride. The news thrilled the medical world, scientific men were\r\nmulling over the possibilities of a new and novel drug. How would it\r\ncome out in Fiji? That was the question.\r\n\r\nWhen the tidings came to Washington, friendly biologists crowded\r\nDr. Maurice C. Hall’s office to congratulate him, and his reply was\r\ncharacteristic. “You say I’ve been curing hookworm in Fiji? Hell, I’ve\r\nnever been near the place.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a month I had treated more cases than my predecessor had in fourteen\r\nmonths, and with no increased expense. Tetrachloride worked with such\r\naccuracy that there was no need of repeated doses, as with chenopodium.\r\nBy the end of 1922 the Rockefeller Foundation, which had untangled the\r\nHall-Lambert collaboration and duly forgiven my disobedience, reported\r\n52,000 treatments by tetrachloride.\r\n\r\nOf these 50,000 had been given in Fiji, under my supervision.\r\n\r\nThe history of public health cannot be written by the sure-cure\r\npatent-medicine man. We had our bumps, at first, but they were\r\namazingly few. In every district where the Willis salt flotation method\r\nshowed a hookworm frequency of over 60 per cent we rounded the people\r\nup and gave the treatment _en masse_. In regions like the dirty Rewa\r\nand Navua districts infection was particularly heavy. In one place we\r\ndosed 1,243, and came back in a month to find 1,111 villagers showing\r\nnegative--about the average sample of our work as it increased to large\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nPrimitive folk made a carnival of our coming; drums sounded and they\r\nall reached out for the wizard drops. They called it “toddy” and said\r\nit was fine because it made them drunk. Possibly it did, a little.\r\nAfter a child’s-size dose small boys would run around like wild dogs,\r\ntear up the flower beds in mission compounds, throw mud and have a\r\nperfectly bully time. Full-grown “marys” would caper and dance like\r\nAunt Dinah at an old-fashioned revival; but when their big buck\r\nhusbands smacked them they would come back to normal with surprising\r\nalacrity. Most of the demonstrations were merely put on; our patients\r\nusually went wild before the drug could have had time to take effect.\r\nHowever, tetrachloride has a mildly intoxicating reaction, especially\r\nif it is not administered with some technical care. But these\r\ndemonstrations were mostly psychological--the native craving for a big\r\njoy party. The British have been more than wise in keeping alcohol away\r\nfrom these people.\r\n\r\nAfter the first two years of wholesale treatments we had to report\r\nseven deaths. Postmortems under the observation of able physicians\r\nrevealed the causes. These seven were all East Indians. One of them, it\r\nturned out, hadn’t taken tetrachloride at all; it had been chenopodium.\r\nOne lad who died had a congenital malformation of the intestine, a\r\ndeformity which would have prevented his living to maturity. Another\r\nwas a woman who was addicted to the use of alcohol. The remainder were\r\nchildren heavily infected with _Ascaris lumbricoides_ (roundworm).\r\n\r\nWhen the deaths came, after forty thousand treatments, I took it pretty\r\nhard. I had gambled for success with everything I had, my job, and\r\nmy professional good name. I felt as though I hadn’t a friend in the\r\nworld. Then who came unexpectedly to my support? Dr. Basil Wilson,\r\nwhom I had always thought of as a queer sort of Englishman with an\r\naversion to me, if any feeling at all. Stanchly Dr. Wilson did the\r\nfriendly thing; he postmortemed the bodies and developed theories as\r\nto the cause of death so sound that they stand on record today. Among\r\nhis medical colleagues he became my champion. Worry was aging me years\r\nin a day until Wilson’s support renewed my youth with courage. Funny\r\nEnglishman; I could have kissed his long, homely face.\r\n\r\nSince that first setback tetrachloride has not caused one death among\r\nthe thousands of Melanesians, Polynesians, East Indians and Europeans\r\nwhom we treated.\r\n\r\nThe fatalities were limited to victims of alcoholism and roundworm.\r\nThat was interesting; more especially in Ascaris cases. Alcohol was\r\ncontra-indicated; a few drinks before or after treatment brought\r\ncomplications. Lingering headaches which came to many of the\r\nnondrinkers were easy to relieve with an after-dose of salts. But\r\nwhat about the roundworm? Why did his presence in the intestine turn\r\ntetrachloride into an active poison? I don’t think that question has\r\nbeen settled yet. One theory says that CCl₄, while it does not kill\r\nthe Ascaris, irritates him to a point where he secretes lethal toxic\r\njuices. According to Dr. Lamson and his collaborators, poisoning with\r\ntetrachloride occurs in dogs when there is a lowered blood calcium.\r\nThis chemical poverty may have something to do with it; I make the\r\nconjecture, without being able to substantiate it, that there is a\r\nrelation between a large number of ascarides and a lowered blood\r\ncalcium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next ten years 286,486 Pacific Islanders were\r\ntreated, under my personal observation, with carbon tetrachloride and\r\nthe later drug, tetrachlorethylene.\r\n\r\nFor the gifted Dr. Hall had come across with an improvement on\r\nhis discovery, and he asked me to give it its first tryout when I\r\ncampaigned in the wild New Hebrides in 1925. I used it extensively down\r\nthere, and optimism sounded in my conservatively worded report. Its\r\nwork was faster, its toxic effect less than that of his original find.\r\nThere is no 100 per cent in medicine, but Hall’s new polysyllabic drug\r\nwas hitting an average that was uncanny.\r\n\r\nWhat a wizard he was, this pre-eminent zoologist, who was Washington’s\r\nNumber One horse doctor! Every pet dog wags his tail (or should) in\r\ngratitude for his two deworming remedies. The dog’s pal, the human,\r\nis Hall’s debtor--all but the fur dealers. The price of silver\r\nfox has taken a terrific slump. Do you know why? Dr. Hall sent his\r\ntetrachlorides to the fox farms where so many hookwormy bitches and\r\npups used to die that pelts had become a luxury for the wives of steel\r\nbarons. When Hall’s treatments came to Foxville the breed picked up\r\nrapidly and its fur went to the lower department stores; so now every\r\nstenographer can have her silver fox--and on her own salary, too. Ask\r\nyour furrier.\r\n\r\nDr. Hall is dead now. I know it’s trite to say that such men don’t\r\nreally die. He has put his own spark into millions of men, women and\r\nchildren who would be in their graves today were it not for what he\r\nfreely gave. He was an untold benefit to the human race. Most of the\r\nhuman race, of course, have never heard of him.\r\n\r\nThen let’s sum up the work of tetrachloride over seventeen years since\r\nthe enterprising Victor Abel first put it on the wire. Dr. Heiser,\r\nauthority on public health, used to call hookworm the world’s most\r\nprevalent disease; in all Earth’s population one out of three had it,\r\nhe said. Then the figures on tetrachloride (and tetrachlorethylene)\r\ntreatments went up and up; 654,896 in 1924; 3,000,000 in 1936. In 1937\r\nI attended a League of Nations conference in Java. A group of us were\r\ndiscussing hookworm treatments. I was pretty cocky about the 500,000\r\ndone in the Pacific; so I asked Dr. Chellapa of Ceylon how many they\r\nwere doing there. Last year had been a pretty bad one, he said--they\r\nhad only given 1,400,000 treatments on account of the malaria epidemic.\r\nThey usually got 2,000,000 he explained. I just said, “Very fine,\r\nindeed,” in a manner I hope wasn’t patronizing. I never mentioned our\r\nfigures. However, in Ceylon they are using the same old Fiji formula\r\nand dosage.\r\n\r\nOne statement may be simpler than these figures. Every year the\r\nRockefeller Foundation used to publish a bulletin of the number of\r\nhookworm treatments. In 1938 hookworm was not even mentioned in the\r\nFoundation’s report, except for data on some still undefined parasite\r\nrecently found in Egypt. The report had no general heading for\r\nankylostomiasis. The worm which had been the source and inspiration of\r\ntheir world campaigns had dropped out of their ken.\r\n\r\nMy application of Hall’s discovery immediately heightened my prestige\r\nall over the Pacific. I don’t claim credit. I happened to be the man\r\nwho stood at the crossroads when a wonderful sort of salvation came my\r\nway. I would have been a fool if I hadn’t seized it and carried it\r\non. And what a lucky afternoon that was, early in 1922, when I read a\r\nlittle article and found a brown bottle labeled CCl₄. It gave me the\r\ncourage I needed to strengthen me for a message of my own, which I knew\r\nI must work out and make clear in the hard days that were to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDEATH AND THE DEVIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation between modern medicine and primitive witchcraft became\r\nso important to me during my years of health campaigning in the\r\nSouth Pacific that I think I should say something here to indicate\r\nthe islander’s daily reliance on sorcery’s touch with the powers\r\nof darkness. During all my work among the remoter tribes I was not\r\nreceived and respected as a university M.D., but as a novel sort of\r\nwitch doctor who had come among them with a stronger magic than the\r\nold. Otherwise I could have made no headway at all. My assistants and I\r\nwere professional sorcerers, backed by Government; we were that, or we\r\nwere nothing.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I got a glimmer of this native point of view,\r\nthen I began to take advantage of it. I had to. I had to let them\r\nbelieve that I was a mystic with a ritual that would take away the\r\ndiseases with which sorcery had cursed them. When I gave tuberculin\r\ninjections to the wild men of Malaita they believed that I was doing\r\nsomething to remove a wicked spell. In thousands and thousands of cases\r\nwhich I have treated, either for cure or diagnosis, they have gone away\r\nwith the same simple faith. Good magic has been working against bad.\r\nAt first I worried about fooling all the people all the time. Then I\r\nfollowed the only expedient that is practical in jungle medicine.\r\n\r\nWhen we regard the native tribe as a unit we must not push the witch\r\ndoctor aside as a buffoon and a faker. Let’s give the devil-man his due\r\nand mark the fallacy of the smug European who sits among dark races\r\nwith the idea of “giving them good laws” and “teaching them morality.”\r\nThis white man forgets that from the dawn of time the medicine man\r\nhas held a position that is both useful and important to the tribe.\r\nCommunities with no prison system must be controlled by a hand which,\r\nto them, reaches into the Invisible. In the old days sorcery was the\r\nprerogative of the chief, and sorcery was a hereditary and honored\r\nprofession. And even today the wizard, either a chief or a commoner,\r\nis there to fend the people from epidemics, to cure their ills, to\r\ncurse the enemy and to shield his flock from the invasion of evil\r\nspells--“and to sustain all those subtle influences that go to form the\r\nsocial cement that marks the difference between a community and a horde\r\nof men,” as Pitt-Rivers expressed it.\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer occupies, in his way, the same position as the Christian\r\npriests who bless the armies and the harvests and metes out spiritual\r\njustice to the sheep and the goats. When he tells the natives of\r\nancient Christian miracles, why should they value his words beyond\r\nthose of their own miracle workers?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have remarked on the crude killings of the _puri-puri_ men, and their\r\nmore subtle methods of removing unwanted tribesmen by what seemed to\r\nbe the power of suggestion; the Pacific native is almost universally a\r\nbeliever in ghosts and devils. Am I going too far when I say that man’s\r\nfirst religion was a form of spiritualism? Life departs, but the soul\r\nlingers, and the simple believer listens to hear the testimony of the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nI had been working in Melanesia for years before I began to appreciate\r\nhow much they are governed by the powers of darkness, by the casting\r\nof spells to kill or cure. In the days when cannibalism and war were\r\nunchecked, tribal and personal grudges were settled in a more horrid\r\nway. In these milder times it is enchantment upon which the clansman\r\ndepends for vengeance.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Dr. Walter Bradford Cannon of Harvard’s Physiology\r\nDepartment, in reply to a query of his:--\r\n\r\n“Your letter brings up a very interesting question which is much in\r\ndispute. Dr. A. Montague, Chief Medical Officer of Fiji and a resident\r\nin the group for thirty years, did not believe in ‘voodoo death,’ that\r\nis, death caused by fear. Personally, I believe he was wrong, as I know\r\nof several instances.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Phillip S. Clarke, of North Queensland, formerly practised just\r\nnorth of Cairns where he had a kanaka come to his hospital and announce\r\nthat he was going to die; that he had had a spell put on him, and there\r\nwas nothing that could be done about it. Dr. Clarke had been acquainted\r\nwith this man for some time. He gave him a most thorough examination\r\nincluding examination of stool and urine, and found everything normal.\r\nThe man kept on eating and smoking, but lay in bed and gradually seemed\r\nto grow weaker. Clarke was friendly with a better-educated kanaka, a\r\nforeman, whom he brought to the hospital ward; this man leaned over the\r\npatient, then turned to Clarke and said, “Yes, Doctor, close up [soon]\r\nhe die.” The bewitched man died at eleven next morning, lying in bed\r\nwith a cigarette in his mouth. Clarke did a postmortem on him and found\r\nnothing that could in any way account for the death.\r\n\r\n“I stayed ten days at a Seventh Day Adventist mission station, Mona\r\nMona, a few miles above Cairns. On the outskirts was a group of\r\nnon-converts, among them Nebo, a famous witch doctor. The missionary’s\r\nright hand man was Rob, a convert. I had been there before and knew\r\nRob. Now the missionary told me that Rob was ill in bed and wanted me\r\nto see him. I found that he had no temperature, no pain, no symptoms\r\nor signs; but he was evidently quite ill. He had told the missionary\r\nthat Nebo had ‘pointed a bone’ at him, therefore he was going to die\r\n‘close up.’ We got Nebo in, put the fear of God in him and--more\r\nimportant--told him that his supply of food would be shut off if\r\nanything happened to Rob; so Nebo leaned down and assured Rob that it\r\nwas all a mistake, a joke, and that he had never pointed a bone at him.\r\nThe relief was almost instantaneous; that afternoon Rob was back at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n“The witch doctor can ‘point a bone’ from a great distance and the\r\nbone is supposed to pierce his victim’s body. However, it is necessary\r\nfor the victim to know that he has been worked upon. Volumes have been\r\nwritten upon this subject, and I can recall endless illustrations of\r\nthis magic, many of which have come under my personal observation.\r\n\r\n“Among native medical students in the senior year I devote one\r\nperiod to the subject of magic, partly because of personal interest\r\nin the reactions I get, partly for the emphasis I try to lay on the\r\nfoolishness of sorcery. There are records of Native Practitioners\r\nthemselves having died of _draunikau_, and the medical class is always\r\ncomposed about half of Fijians and the rest Polynesians with an\r\noccasional Micronesian. The Polynesians of the present generation do\r\nnot know this magic; but to the Fijians, even to the educated ones,\r\n_draunikau_ is a dreadful word. When it is mentioned the student’s face\r\nbecomes a mask; I catch the look of worry and fear.\r\n\r\n“The practice is still in evidence back in the hills and remote places\r\nwhere in Christian Fiji, with 93 per cent literacy, there are still\r\nfamous witch doctors. _The only Fijian I have ever known to be unafraid\r\nof draunikau[4] is a man named Malakai, who has been working for me now\r\nfor thirteen years._ He has actually defied one of the most powerful\r\nwitch doctors in Fiji to do him any harm. Incidentally, the native\r\ntheory is that magic cannot affect the white man.”\r\n\r\n_Ndrau-ni-kau_ is the Fijian word meaning “magic-of-leaves.” You might\r\ncall it the foundation of the old-time religion. No Melanesian believes\r\nthat he can grow ill or die from natural causes like dysentery or\r\ninfluenza--look for the enemy who has hired a sorcerer to lay you low.\r\nEven the diagnosis of the District Medical Officer will not change the\r\nnative mind. The curse is on him, therefore the cursed will die unless\r\nsome more potent witch doctor is called in to magic away the spell. The\r\nMelanesian’s ghost-religion is dreadful. When a man dies and is planted\r\nunderground his soul loses its kindly nature; your sweet and gentle\r\nmother or father or grandfather turns into a _tevoro_, a fiend plotting\r\nmischief to his own. And the _tevoro_ becomes a principal actor in the\r\nlong ritual which brings a plague on your house.\r\n\r\nThe professional making of a _draunikau_ is as complicated a process\r\nas that used by the demonologists of medieval Europe. As in the cruder\r\nmagic of the _puri-puri_ men, the practitioner obtains a bit of\r\nclothing or hair or feces from his victim’s person. These things, mixed\r\nwith leaves, are shut up in a bamboo joint--or more modernly, in a\r\nbottle. The mage who follows this craft is merely employed by the hater\r\nto work evil on the hated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the approved methods might be roughly classified as the Seven\r\nWays of Cursing, one general practice is for the performer to take\r\nhis bottle of _draunikau_ to some chosen graveyard where the _tevoro_\r\nlies underground. The curse called _tava vatu_ is said to be the most\r\ndifficult to beat. Among the graves grows a special plant called _uthi_\r\nwhose leaves the magician roasts on hot stones, and calls out that this\r\nis the _draunikau_ by which So-and-so must die; out of the smoking\r\nleaves the voice of the victim cries aloud. Then the _draunikau_ is\r\nburied and the victim will die in about four days, unless the curse is\r\nprayed off by a rival expert, who sprinkles his own special brew on\r\nthe hot stones and repeats, “This is the _sorosorovi_ by which the man\r\nshall live.” The _sorosorovi_, wrapped in leaves, is taken to the sick\r\nman’s house and displayed so prominently that the _tevoro_ will mistake\r\nit for the _draunikau_ and float into it. So now he’s caught, and the\r\nbenevolent witch doctor throws the package into water. The devil is\r\nfoiled, and becomes so angry that he will enter the body of the witch\r\ndoctor who first summoned him, and this man will die in four days.\r\n\r\n_Kena balavu_ is a slower torment; every time you heat the _draunikau_\r\nthe object of hatred becomes ill; when it cools he becomes better. The\r\npatient’s sickness is determined by the mixture put in the bottle.\r\nIf it is a hair from his head, then he will have head-sickness, if\r\nparings from his toenails, then foot-sickness, and so on. A rival\r\ndoctor may lift the spell by finding the bamboo where the hell’s broth\r\nis buried; he will heat the bamboo and rinse it in salt water, then\r\ndose and massage the sufferer with magic leaves. The sorcerer who comes\r\nto cure is called the “antagonist.” Before the antagonist digs up the\r\n_draunikau_ he must pour kava for four nights over the spot where it is\r\nburied. But if the patient dies, then the witch doctor who cursed him\r\nmust save his own life by stealing to the victim’s body and jabbing it\r\nwith some sharp instrument, or, after the man is buried, he must pierce\r\nthe grave with a spear. Otherwise the magician will die in four nights.\r\nAnd if friends wrap a breadfruit in mummy-apple leaves and put it under\r\nthe corpse’s arm, the evil wizard will die of heart disease.\r\n\r\n_Kena leka_ is another hot-stone _draunikau_, very swift because the\r\ndeath ritual has been said by moonlight. The _tevoro_ floats from the\r\ngrave to some large tree by a lake or river. _Sova yanggona_ is among\r\nthe most popular of the curses. On the grave of one of the victim’s\r\nancestors a libation of kava is poured, with supplications for death.\r\n_Tei nia_, the coconut curse, is said to have no antagonism. The\r\noperator waters sacred ground with kava, then plants a coconut. When it\r\nsprouts he transplants it--and his man is dead.\r\n\r\n_Ndrimi_ is a Solomon Island importation. Dip your finger in the\r\nmagic-of-leaves and touch the hated one. The more potent _ndrimi_\r\ndoctors can bring sickness by pointing a finger. This power gives\r\nSolomon Islanders a prestige in Fiji. If a black boy from Bougainville\r\nwants a pretty local girl he merely says _ndrimi_--and gets her.\r\n\r\nThe classic forms have often inter-pollenized, and Christianity\r\nand water-front trading have added comedy. There are a number of\r\nspecialists who mix whisky and the Bible with their efforts to kill\r\nor cure. Hard liquor is forbidden the natives, so a full bottle adds\r\ncharm to necromancy. One of our native medical practitioners witnessed\r\nthe work of an up-to-date witch doctor, called in to antagonize a\r\n_draunikau_. He prescribed a tablespoonful of whisky and a verse from\r\nthe New Testament, then began taking his own medicine, in liquid form.\r\nAs our N.M.P. reported it, “He seemed quite drunk.”\r\n\r\nThis modern technique, plus the dreadful _sova yanggona_, had to do\r\nwith a recent _cause célèbre_, which I am leading up to. Here the\r\nmagicians used the lantern-and-mirror technique. They went by night to\r\nan ancestral cemetery where one man held a lantern, another a mirror\r\nand the third poured kava with the death-prayer. Pleased with his\r\ndrink, the _tevoro_ awoke.... Look in the mirror and see his cruel\r\nface! See, he is shaking the grave-dust from his body! Now ask him to\r\nfollow you!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat I have heard has come to me after much curious prying. I had been\r\ndown there nearly twenty years before I could dig any of it out. It is\r\nnot general knowledge among the whites. The missionaries should have\r\nknown, but too many of them never turn to see what’s going on behind\r\ntheir backs. Superior natives, especially Fijians, have furnished\r\nthe most valuable data. Benuve Vakatawa, N.M.P., whose work had been\r\namong his people, became quite an authority. Once I asked him how the\r\nnative reconciled the two religions, the old gods and the new God. Did\r\nthey not call upon Jehovah and Jesus to protect them from the evil\r\nold Fijian divinities? He shook his head. I asked, “What is the true\r\nreligion in Fiji, Christianity or Magic?” He said unhesitatingly,\r\n“Magic.” Christianity was just a cloak, held up before European eyes\r\nto hide the worship of devils and satanic miracles. The people did\r\nnot want Europeans to interfere with ancient demonology, he said, but\r\nChristianity had its place--it was “society,” as the European knows it\r\nin his dances, theaters and ouija-board parties. It had an amusement\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have told how native medical students reacted to my lectures on\r\nmagic. Vakatawa, however, thought that the old-time religion was losing\r\nground; that the N.M.P.’s as well as the native pastors were drifting\r\naway from it. The pastors, for instance, had learned to keep a little\r\niodine and a few simple home remedies around the house and were going\r\nto the N.M.P. for medical treatment. But many of these native Christian\r\nteachers still saw the witch doctor first, and only got around to the\r\nscientifically trained practitioners when the old way didn’t seem\r\nto work. However, the Native Medical Practitioner with his better\r\neducation and better methods is getting about, and modern medicine is\r\nslowly commencing to take its place in Fijian lives.\r\n\r\nWhat Pitt-Rivers said in defense of the witch doctors is certainly\r\ntrue of the influence they still exert. The old tribal habit of\r\nkilling strangers because they had “salt water in their eyes” probably\r\ndates back to sorcerers who noticed that epidemics followed visitors.\r\nLet’s say this for the primitive medicine man. He had his own kit\r\nof remedies, many of them effective--probably herbs, massage and\r\nhydrotherapeutic treatments. He knew about fractures and their care;\r\neven today you rarely find there a deformity following a fracture, yet\r\nin native life there are many cracked and broken bones.\r\n\r\nThe witch doctor still bolsters the old moral code. Vakatawa has seen\r\na witch woman tell a sick girl that the gods had cursed her for loose\r\nliving. The girl was weak with dysentery and confessed that she had\r\ncohabited with more than twenty youngsters. The witch said, “Tell\r\neverything or you will die.” But the poor child died with the last\r\nsin unconfessed. Here was a recorded failure in magic in a district\r\nwhere Vakatawa had his hands full; the inhabitants were going to the\r\nwitch doctor and the medical doctor at the same time. If the patient\r\nrecovered the magician was praised; if he died the physician was blamed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho is the god of gods to whom the Fijian secretly prays for harm\r\nto his enemies? Maybe he is Dengei, most powerful of their evil\r\npantheon--yet who is to say, when there are so many? Several of them\r\nappear as great sharks, making mischief, bearing ill tidings. There are\r\nthe two siren goddesses, Yalewamatagi, who lure handsome young men to\r\nsin with them, then leave them dead in the bush. Daucina, an oversexed\r\nman-god, is the dread of young girls who wander by night. Death often\r\nfollows his brutal ravishing.\r\n\r\nDuring the gold rush on Viti Levu in 1932 many natives were afraid\r\nto go into the mines. Wasn’t it known to all magicians that Tui\r\nMateinagata, the Snake-bodied One who hides in gold, was lurking in\r\na cave at Tavua, and that his seven heads of gold and silver would\r\ndestroy all trespassers? And the witch doctors whispered that the\r\nveins would soon play out, for Tui Mateinagata knows how to hide his\r\ntreasure. There’s the old crab-goddess, too, whose bite is poison; but\r\nit is to Dengei, lord of origins and of evil, that the magicians fondly\r\nturn. He too is a great serpent, and frequents the caves of Nakauvandra\r\nin the north. His magic made and populated Fiji. The god admired two\r\neggs in the nest of the kitu bird, and decided to hatch them himself;\r\nthe issue was a boy and a girl, whom he separated for five years by the\r\ntrunk of a giant tree. One day they peeped around the tree and said,\r\n“Great Dengei has hatched us that we may people the land.” Dengei,\r\ncomplimented, produced growing things for food, flowers for adornment,\r\nfire for cooking. The first humans would have been immortal, but they\r\ndisobeyed their god and were punished with sickness and death.\r\n\r\nAnother story of origins is not so flattering to the Fijian who,\r\naccording to the tale, was born before all others. But he acted\r\nwickedly and his skin darkened, so he received little clothing. The\r\npeople of Tonga,--Polynesians, by the way,--were not so naughty with\r\nDengei, who rationed out clothes to them which kept their skins much\r\nlighter. The white man was the great beneficiary. He was born last,\r\nbehaved like a perfect gentleman, and Dengei rewarded him with so much\r\nto wear that his complexion became the beau ideal.\r\n\r\nThe Polynesians of Tonga say that the gods held a meeting and decided\r\nto create humanity. They baked three figures of clay. The first to come\r\nout didn’t seem to have baked long enough; he was disagreeably white\r\nand looked half-raw. The second was a Tongan, a beautiful olive-brown,\r\nand the gods admired him so much that they forgot the third figure\r\nuntil a voice from the oven cried, “I am burning!” Sure enough, the\r\npoor fellow was roasted nearly black; so they sent him west and he\r\nbecame a Fijian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe absent treatment of sorcerers has no effect on the white man, so\r\nnatives say; but old Thakombau, inwardly infuriated by a snub, might\r\nor might not have been the instrument that changed England’s royal\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nIn the early ’80’s, _H.M.S. Bacchante_ brought two royal midshipmen\r\nto Fiji. They were the Duke of Clarence, heir to the throne, and his\r\nyounger brother Prince George, who later became King George V. Ex-King\r\nThakombau was the nearest thing to a monarch that Fiji could produce,\r\nand now he was a Christian. He entertained the visitors at a great kava\r\nceremony where the long line of _meke_ singers sat cross-legged and\r\nclapped hands to the chanted welcome, “_Mbula, mbula mai!_” Dancers had\r\nimpersonated the animals, birds and fishes, comedians had impersonated\r\ndogs quarreling over a bone, long lines of men had coiled across the\r\ngreen in the contortions of the snake-god Dengei, or undulated in the\r\nbeautiful surf dance. There was the presentation of the _tambua_. To\r\nthe Fijian this sacred whale’s tooth is the prize of prizes; it is\r\ngold, it is magic. If a tribesman offers a _tambua_ to you, you may\r\nrefuse the gift; if you take it you must grant any boon the giver\r\nasks--even the murder of your best friend, the yielding up of your\r\nfavorite wife. There’s a long tale of crime and punishment connected\r\nwith the giving of the _tambua_.\r\n\r\nThis was royal ceremony. Maybe in the back of Thakombau’s sly head\r\nthere was a picture of another _meke_ over which he had presided often\r\nin his days of power. The Dance of the Cannibals.... Massed warriors\r\nwere roaring out the notes to the boom of heavy drums.... Human meat\r\nwas about to be cooked.... High voices in a savage tenor would cry out,\r\n“_Puaka balavu!_”... The bodies were ready for the oven.... Then, “_Sa\r\nrawa tu!_”--“It is prepared.”\r\n\r\nThe English royal visitors had settled under the flower-pavilion and\r\nthe makers of _yanggona_ were at work. They were making kava by the old\r\nmethod--chew the root and spit the juice into a great bowl. The drink\r\nwas ready. The honorable cupbearer knelt and received a portion in a\r\npolished coconut shell, rose and bore the cup to the more important\r\nguest. Offering it, he knelt before Britain’s heir apparent. But\r\nClarence, who had seen native saliva go into the bowl, was not amused,\r\nso the story goes. He pushed the cup aside and made a wry face. Grim\r\nsilence followed. The cupbearer rose and knelt before young George,\r\nwhose tact was equal to the occasion. He took the shell and tossed\r\nhis portion off with gusto; then reached down and spun the cup across\r\nthe mat--the highest compliment. Loud clapping of hands with cries of\r\n“_Mbula vinaka!_”\r\n\r\nThe time came for King Thakombau to make his speech. With florid\r\ngenerosity he dwelt upon the greatness of England and the benefits\r\nVictoria had conferred upon his people. Then abruptly he turned to\r\nthe Duke of Clarence and said, “You have been afraid to drink the\r\n_yanggona_ of Fiji. A true man knows no fear. Because you are not brave\r\nyou will never become King of Veretania.” Then pointing to George, “You\r\nare a brave young man, you are not afraid of our customs. You will be\r\nthe King, and a great one.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Clarence died without succeeding to the throne. George\r\nbecame King of England. Yet they say that the native _draunikau_ has no\r\neffect on a white man, and that puts a big hole in the story. From time\r\nimmemorial, on the other hand, the chief has had the right to bewitch.\r\nThakombau, on or off the throne, was a king; and there is some reason\r\nto believe that he used his ancient right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA recent case of witchcraft struck in high places and involved two of\r\nThakombau’s grandsons, Ratu Pope (pronounced _Pope-ee_) and Ratu Sukuna.\r\n\r\nRatu Sukuna graduated from Oxford with a degree in law. Caucasian in\r\nfeature, handsome by any standard, Sukuna offered himself to the Empire\r\nin 1914; because his Empire refused the service of natives, he enlisted\r\nin the Foreign Legion, gained his sergeancy and a decoration, and came\r\nhome with a well-earned wound-stripe. He was one of the few properly\r\neducated Fijians. True, Ratu Devi, his brother, later studied medicine\r\nin New Zealand. Devi’s annoyance was his great personal charm with\r\nwomen in the wards, who wouldn’t let him alone. In Fiji he is now an\r\nunusually successful District Medical Officer.\r\n\r\nRatu Sukuna holds important government positions in Fiji, where he\r\nis in the anomalous position of one who tries to carry two races on\r\nhis shoulders. In England and France he adapted himself to foreign\r\nlanguages and customs. In his heart, under the borrowed gloss of alien\r\nculture, he is still sufficiently Melanesian to avoid the ancestral\r\ngraveyard after dusk; the educated half of him scoffs at the idea of\r\nghosts, yet he admits freely that when he passes the family plot in\r\nthe dark of the moon he feels an unpleasant something clawing at his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nHis cousin, Ratu Pope, was a famous character in Fiji, and was always\r\nintimate with Sukuna, whom he admired prodigiously. By nature a\r\nsportsman, in youth he was a great cricketer. He was schooled at the\r\nMethodist College in Sydney, but had the accent of the English country\r\ngentleman. His athletic figure was impressive in the short, white\r\n_sulu_, above sturdy bare legs and feet; from the hips up he dressed in\r\nthe British tradition, sports coat for the morning, dinner jacket or\r\ntails for ceremonial occasions--much as the well-born Highlander wears\r\nhis kilt with all the conventional fixings.\r\n\r\nHe had the charm and wit which we associate with exiled kings. When\r\nthe Duke of Windsor visited Fiji as Prince of Wales he was delighted\r\nwith Pope. Pope was, by courtesy, banished for many years to Mbau, the\r\nenchanting island his wise ancestors had chosen for their capital;\r\nsoft winds cool it, blow away mosquitoes; above the royal _bure_ looms\r\na great rock, the little Gibraltar where Grandfather Thakombau was\r\nsupposed to have been hemmed in before he gave his domain to England.\r\nGovernor Sir Eyre Hutson decided to exile Pope because he had rather\r\ninnocently defaulted. As chief of his province he had been Assistant\r\nDistrict Commissioner, hence a tax collector. It was his free-hearted\r\nMelanesian generosity that put him on a bad spot: When you have money,\r\nspend it on your people and your friends. Generosity is godlike,\r\nstinginess is for the worms. Let me tell it in Pope’s own way:--\r\n\r\n“I had no trouble at all collecting the silly taxes. Tax gathering is\r\na royal prerogative. So the Government sent me up a little iron safe,\r\nto put the money in, you understand. Well, months went by and one day\r\na chap from the Government came in a launch--rather a blighter, I\r\nthought. We had a spot of whisky and a cigar and he said, ‘Ratu, the\r\ntide’s turning and I must be pushing on. I’ve called, you know, to take\r\nback that tax money.’ I said, ‘I’m rather afraid, old boy, that I can’t\r\nlay my hands on it now.’ He seemed a bit miffed and said, ‘But didn’t\r\nwe send you an iron safe to put it in?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ I said, ‘it’s over\r\nthere in the corner. If you look at it you’ll see that the door’s wide\r\nopen.’”\r\n\r\nRoyal prerogative had scattered the money in several ways--but always\r\nfor the good of the people of Mbau. Ratu Pope had set up shower baths\r\nin all the village houses, and built a reservoir to supply fresh water.\r\nThe reservoir remained dry while an offended Government interned Pope\r\non his ancestral isle--until he paid the bill. “It’s only a few hundred\r\npounds,” he complained, laughing at himself, “and as all I have is\r\ninvested in rather poor coconuts, I’ll be Methuselah, I fancy, before\r\nI’m free again.” However, a relenting Government allowed him to come to\r\nSuva to see the cricket matches--he’d have died without that. Also they\r\nlet him meet the tourist boats, the best possible advertisement for the\r\nFiji Islands.\r\n\r\nWhen the late Martin Egan and his traveling partner Wallace Irwin\r\nwere his guests at Mbau, in 1927, they brought back stories that\r\nillustrated Pope’s quick come-back. One night they were sitting by\r\nlantern light under the breadfruit trees, smoking the long Coronas Pope\r\nadored. He said, “It’s a bit tiresome, being cooped up here. One longs\r\nfor travel. I am very fond of the _National Geographic Magazine_.”\r\nHe called for copies, turned to a back page. “I think I prefer your\r\nclever advertisements. Look at this, for instance”--showing the New\r\nYork Life Insurance Company’s stock advertisement, the one with the\r\nmodest skyscraper. “My word, it seems to go up twenty-five or thirty\r\nstories!” Martin Egan told him that Al Smith and his pals were building\r\na skyscraper that would be about a hundred stories high. Pope objected,\r\n“But doesn’t one get blood pressure, going so high in a lift?” Egan\r\nsaid that everybody in New York had high blood pressure so what was the\r\ndifference?\r\n\r\nRatu Pope looked at him gravely. “That fellow Frederick O’Brien who\r\nwrote the White Shadows twaddle visited me last year. When he left I\r\nwondered if all Americans were such damned liars.”\r\n\r\nHe showed his guests Thakombau’s cannibal temple, the one he preserved\r\nfor sentiment’s sake. The shaggy thing, on a base of high stone\r\nterraces, is immensely out of scale with the low village houses. Pope\r\ntook an honest pride in the deeds of his grandfather, much as Grant’s\r\ndescendants might in the surrender at Appomattox. He pointed out a\r\nhole in the ground, right in front of the temple, and said, “The stone\r\nof sacrifice used to stand here. It was built rather like a very wide\r\ngravestone, with a depression in the top for the--er--victim’s head.\r\nI gave it to our local church to use as a baptismal font. Would you\r\nlike to hear the ceremony of a cannibal execution? Grandfather sat on\r\nthe second tier and the people formed a semicircle below. Around the\r\nstone the priests drew lots as to whether the poor fellow was to be\r\nburied or--er--eaten. The latter usually won, I’m afraid. It was purely\r\neconomic, you see. Well, four powerful executioners came along carrying\r\nthe victim lashed to a plank. They held him in the correct position,\r\nand when Grandfather gave the word they would bash the fellow’s head\r\nsmartly against the stone. They were so very skillful that I doubt if\r\nthe poor chap even felt it.”\r\n\r\nThat was Ratu Pope, playboy king who spoke up-to-date King’s English,\r\nliked American magazines, excelled at cricket, brought European ideas\r\nto a cannibal capital, and then....\r\n\r\nLate in 1936 he was taken to the hospital in Suva, far gone with\r\ndiabetes and cirrhosis of the liver. He should have had faith in the\r\nBritish doctors; he knew them all, and respected their work. As he\r\nweakened he called for his wife, Andi Torika, and whispered, “I have\r\nbeen bewitched. They have put a _draunikau_ on me.” His wife nodded.\r\nBut who was working the black magic? Pope whispered, “My cousin Sukuna.”\r\n\r\nThe accusation, by way of native grapevine telegraph, soon reached\r\nthe ears of Ratu Sukuna, who was horrified. Why in the world would he\r\nwant to put a _draunikau_ on good old Pope? What silly nonsense! They\r\nhad been pals ever since they were knee-high. Sukuna went straight to\r\nRatu Pope’s bedside. A gifted speaker with a feeling for the niceties\r\nof language, he sat beside the dying man and strove with him, gently.\r\nAt last Pope nodded and asked forgiveness. No, Sukuna could not have\r\nbrought about the evil spell. But somebody had paid a witch doctor for\r\nthis _draunikau_. Yes, agreed Sukuna, and went sadly away from the man\r\nwho had been cursed--by somebody.\r\n\r\nA short time afterward Sukuna was in his schooner, sailing from Viti\r\nLevu to Lakeba. Suddenly he called out, “Turn back!” For in the water,\r\nskimming along his course, he had seen the family totem shark. That\r\ncould mean only one thing--death of a near relative. When he returned\r\nto Suva, his cousin Ratu Pope was dead.\r\n\r\nThere followed a battle of magic and countermagic, ghost against ghost,\r\nthroughout Thakombau’s old empire. The persons concerned in it were\r\ntoo noble to be ignored. All this, mind you, happened only about three\r\nyears ago. It began with Ratu Pope’s dying whisper into the ear of his\r\nfaithful wife, Andi Torika. She belonged to the same _matangali_ as\r\nRatu Wailala, powerful sub-chief in Taveuni. To Wailala the widow sent\r\na present of ten _tambuas_, a dangerous gift, for under the eyes of the\r\ngods the recipient must grant a favor. Ratu Lala, Lord of Taveuni, was\r\non Andi’s bad books; he stood in royal succession; if he lived his son\r\nmight sit on Pope’s shadow-throne.\r\n\r\nThis was politics, in a conflict between two branches of an old ruling\r\nfamily. Seventy-five years ago it would have meant war. Today it was\r\n_draunikau_. Ratu Wailala took Andi’s _tambuas_, which had come with\r\na request to put a _draunikau_ on Ratu Lala, accused of Pope’s death\r\nby magic. Wailala was also jealous of Lala’s title, and went about the\r\ncurse in classic style. He presented a _tambua_ to another chief, with\r\nthe request that a _draunikau_ be arranged for Lala. This chief took\r\nthe _tambua_ to Mosese, a very able witch doctor.\r\n\r\nThat was in mid-April, 1938. In the dark of night Mosese and Kalepi,\r\nhis assistant, with a local chief, stole over to the grave of Ratu\r\nLala’s grandfather and carried with them the proper leaves and kava\r\nroot for the _Sova Yanggona_ (the Pouring Kava) ritual. They crouched\r\nat the foot of the mound where the dead man’s legs would be pointing.\r\nMosese, seated between his two associates, lifted the bowl to his\r\nlap, then six times raised it to his head. Kava was made according to\r\nceremony. Now it was ready. The performers clapped three times; Kalepi\r\nfilled a drinking bowl and presented it to the dead chief with the\r\nrequest that Ratu Lala’s life be taken away. Six times the libation was\r\npoured on the head of the grave to fill the mouth of a thirsty _tevoro_.\r\n\r\nThe tattler was a woman who had started out before the break of day\r\nto fish for prawns. She lost her way, shuddered by the cemetery,\r\nthen paused in a paralysis of fear. There were voices by the grave\r\nof Nagolea, there was the scent of _uthi_, the graveyard flower. She\r\npeered, she saw three crouching figures making _draunikau_. For days\r\nshe was too frightened to tell.\r\n\r\nThen, on April 15, 1938, Ratu Lala went to Suva and grew dizzy as he\r\nwalked. He knew why, and sent for the powerful sorcerer Ngio from\r\nNgau, whom he employed to combat the evil magic. Ngio told him that\r\nhis sickness started from Taveuni, and there the _draunikau_ would be\r\nfound. That night Ratu Lala had a dreadful dream. A chief who had been\r\ndead twelve years came in and poked him with his walking stick, saying,\r\n“Who is this man sleeping in my house?” Lala returned to his home in\r\nTaveuni, and when another sick spell came on he heard gossip about the\r\nthree men who had made _draunikau_. He sent for the sorcerers, ignored\r\ntheir pleas of innocence and had them beaten with ropes. They went to\r\nthe hospital, still denying their share in black magic. Wailala also\r\nfeigned innocence, but a constable included him with the others.\r\n\r\nRatu Lala’s witch doctor, the gifted sorcerer from Ngau, assembled his\r\ncolleagues, hoping that their combined magic would offset the dreadful\r\n_Sova Yanggona_. One night Lala dreamed that he saw the gods in a\r\nmeeting; a short man knelt at Lala’s doorway, holding up a _tambua_\r\nwith the request for death. A voice wailed, “Ratu Wailala’s _tambua_\r\ncannot be returned with mercy on Lala’s life!”\r\n\r\nIt was on September 17, to be exact, when I was with Dr. Strode,\r\ninspecting the hospital at Suva. We found Ratu Lala in bed with an\r\nabscess of the neck, and his morale completely shattered. He had told\r\nthe world that he expected to die of a _draunikau_.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, September 21, Dr. Strode and I went to a luncheon at\r\nGovernment House. And what did we see? Sitting calmly beside Mr.\r\nMonckton, Secretary of Native Affairs, was Ratu Lala. Only four days\r\nhad passed since he had about given up the ghost, and now he was in\r\nhigh spirits, telling the Governor fine stories and eating with gusto.\r\nHis explanation was straightforward. Oh, that witch doctor, Ngio\r\nfrom Ngau, had an antagonism that was too strong for black magic to\r\nwithstand. He had worked from the Bible, and that was big medicine;\r\nhe would open the Good Book at random and interpret past, present and\r\nfuture; but invariably he would return to the Gospel according to Saint\r\nMatthew, and from that he could foil any ghost or devil that ever flew\r\nover Fiji.\r\n\r\nNgio the gospel-wizard came to Suva later and boasted of his holy magic\r\nto all and sundry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExhibitions of fire walking, given by a priestly cult from the island\r\nof Mbengga, are too well known now to permit much discussion. Before\r\nthese shows became popular features for tourist ships and visiting\r\nroyalty I saw them dozens of times on their native ground. There have\r\nbeen any number of scientific treatises written to account for the\r\nphenomenon of bare Fijian feet which remain unscorched after contact\r\nwith burning stones. As a physician I have studied the condition of the\r\nfire walkers before and after the ordeal, and I have always gone away\r\nwith the feeling that I have seen a miracle. The old Mbengga myth which\r\nsays that Ra Duna the Eel taught the hero Koma how to do the trick\r\nseems about as good an explanation as any I have heard.\r\n\r\nAmong the dark islanders magic things are usually grim, although there\r\nis a faded myth about the _neli_ people, a race of elves with long\r\ngolden hair. They dance by moonlight, and if one of the golden hairs\r\ntouches a peeping mortal he forgets how to find his way home. They say\r\nthat native boys and girls who stayed out late usually blamed it on the\r\n_neli_. But belief in the little folk is passing.\r\n\r\nThe giving of curses is a serious everyday affair. In groups less\r\nadvanced than Fiji the witch doctor commits simple murder. I have\r\nmentioned the Poisoner’s College at Mou. And there is the celebrated\r\ncase of Captain Bell, Government tax collector, who went out in the\r\nSolomons on his unpopular errand and was speared by savages, sent to\r\ncarry out a practical _draunikau_.\r\n\r\nInspector Bill Tully was down in the primitive New Hebrides. One\r\nmorning his breakfast had been laid on a veranda; below many natives\r\nwere gathered for a lecture. Tully sat down to breakfast when a witch\r\ndoctor, in full paint, stepped up and flourished a bamboo wand, telling\r\nthe world he held the magic that would kill. “Go ahead,” challenged\r\nTully, so the magician tapped his wand on a plate. A little powder\r\nsifted out. Scornfully the young inspector blew it away and ordered his\r\nboy to bring bacon and eggs.\r\n\r\nBill finished his breakfast in full view of a very watchful audience.\r\nSo far so good. But he had scarcely bolted the last scrap when he felt\r\na griping in his stomach; cold sweat broke out, and he knew that he had\r\nturned pale green. He must have been a sickening sight, for the gawping\r\nnatives screamed and scampered to the woods. It took Bill some minutes\r\nto recover equilibrium. Then he remembered. He had taken a rather large\r\ndose of calomel, and the darned stuff had begun to operate shortly\r\nafter the wizard tapped his plate.\r\n\r\nPolynesian magic is not so black, perhaps, as that you’ll find all\r\nover Melanesia; but it is always there, hiding behind Christianity\r\nor even higher education. In the Cook Islands a father cursed his\r\npretty daughter. He had elephantiasis, and she had jeered him for his\r\n“big-leg.” “Very well,” he said, “and may your especially beautiful\r\nlegs, which have caused too much trouble already, swell up and become\r\nbig as mine.” Accordingly her legs swelled, and she was disfigured.\r\nTrue, she had been sleeping in her father’s house for years, and the\r\nfilarial mosquito is no respecter of persons.\r\n\r\nThe Maoris of New Zealand are superior Polynesians. When I was making\r\na survey there Dr. Ellison, himself half Maori, told me of a case that\r\nhad come under his direct observation. The Polynesians, he reminded me,\r\nare practically all spiritualists, and the average Maori has forgotten\r\nmore about spiritualism than the European medium will ever know. Among\r\nthe Tohunga cult there is power to bring death by a secret wish; in the\r\nMelanesian _draunikau_ the victim is not affected until he knows that\r\nthe curse is on him. But the Tohungas never telegraph their punches.\r\n\r\nDr. Ellison told me that a Mr. Haberley, half-Maori and an acquaintance\r\nof mine, was interested in the Wellington Museum and in search of fine\r\nMaori carvings. The quest took him to the region where Rua the Prophet\r\nheld forth. Haberley found many neglected and rotting relics, but Rua\r\ndefied him to lay hands on them. However, the collector took them to\r\nthe museum. It wasn’t long before a serious illness overtook Haberley,\r\nwho fell back on the customs of his mother’s people. He was of the\r\nTaranaki Maoris, so it was all in good form when he called in another\r\nTohunga necromancer from Taranaki. Out of Mr. Haberley’s suavely\r\neducated lips came the command, “Save me if you can, and if you can’t,\r\nfinish off Rua.” Very promptly the Tohunga put the bee on Rua the\r\nProphet, who died during my survey of New Zealand. Haberley also died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGILBERT AND SULLIVAN, 1924\r\n\r\n\r\nMy share in the application of carbon tetrachloride had been a decided\r\nstep forward for me, and I had spent two very busy years in Fiji,\r\ncampaigning both for cure and prevention. But what most engaged my\r\nheart and mind was the plan for an improved medical school for natives.\r\nThrough thick and thin I preached my crusade and hung to the idea like\r\na terrier. In this plan I saw the only salvation for the island peoples.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1924, when I set out for a brief survey of the Gilbert and\r\nEllice Islands, the idea was still foremost in my thoughts. That was\r\nthe first time I took Malakai along, just to show them.\r\n\r\nThe G and E Group, as it is conveniently called, is satirized by young\r\ncadets over the Fiji Club bar as “Gilbert and Sullivan.” It has a\r\ncertain comic appeal. Dr. Walter E. Traprock, America’s glamour boy\r\namong nature fakers, chose these dots on the sea for his _Cruise of\r\nthe Kawa_, where the national bird of the Filbert Islands was supposed\r\nto lay square eggs and cackle “Ouch!” Robert Louis Stevenson was far\r\nmore serious, describing scenes of blood and beauty along the threading\r\natolls.\r\n\r\nSamoans, who once stigmatized as ghosts and slaves all folk who lived\r\nbeyond them, called their islands “The World’s Navel.” In this they\r\nwere somewhat off their bearings, for their Samoa is a bit too far\r\nsoutheast to center the earth. The Gilbert and Ellice group is strung\r\nin faint tattoo marks along the very middle of Earth’s belly. In all\r\nit covers 1,000 miles of sea, with islands so sparsely scattered that\r\nthe easternmost is some 600 miles from the westernmost. A white man’s\r\ngovernment has combined these two archipelagoes, but as a matter\r\nof geography they lie about 100 miles apart. The Gilbertese are a\r\nMicronesian stock, the Ellice folk are typically Polynesian and have a\r\nphysique, a language and a social organization entirely different from\r\nthe Gilbertese.\r\n\r\nThe Gilberts, which have been the meeting place of the races, have\r\nbecome the meeting place of the anthropologists. Originally, these men\r\nagree, the inhabitants were a black, smallish, flat-nosed mouse-eared\r\npeople, called “the Spider Folk” because their divinities appeared in\r\nthe form of spiders--also of turtles. The Spider Folk were supposed\r\nto be dreadful magicians, therefore they were avoided. Then came the\r\ninvaders, great of stature, red of skin (that is, light brown), who\r\nfought them like devils, but still feared the Spider Magic. Songs\r\nsurvive, telling of the conquerors’ prowess as sailors; in them they\r\nare extolled as Children of the Sea, Fierce Fish of the West.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mystery of Polynesian or other Pacific migrations is a puzzle\r\nthat may never be solved. The Gilberts formed a bottle neck through\r\nwhich many waves of migration must have come from the ancestral home,\r\nHawaiki--from which are derived the modern names Hawaii and Savaii.\r\nSome pressure, some social convulsion on the continent must have driven\r\nthem off of the southeast tip of Asia and sent them out in migratory\r\nwaves--no turning back, a fierce starving horde in a quest for land and\r\na home in the Pacific. Another stream undoubtedly crossed the Behring\r\nSea and traveled southward along the coast; Mexican legends told of\r\ntheir coming from the north. Probably they passed as far as to South\r\nAmerica. Our red Indian race must be the mixture resulting from these\r\ninvasions. They must have reached the continent across the Pacific, or\r\nsome must have returned from the west coast of the Americas, to have\r\nbrought the sweet potato to the Pacific. In this time we can appreciate\r\nthe thrill of horror that went over the peaceful Pacific islands,\r\nwaking to see strange fleets of enormous canoes pouring forth their\r\nhordes of death-driven warriors.\r\n\r\nIn the sterile Gilberts the invaders found little that they\r\nwanted--except women. They lingered for a generation or so, then\r\nconquered the Ellices, captured Rotumah, fought their way into Savaii\r\nand Upolu in Samoa.\r\n\r\nTradition and genealogy tell the story plainly. About twenty-four to\r\ntwenty-eight generations ago a return invasion rolled back from Samoa,\r\nmoving northward. It overwhelmed the Ellices, but was repulsed by the\r\nGilbertese; except that small Nui in the Ellices still retains much of\r\nthe Gilbertese language and customs.\r\n\r\nIn total area the Gilberts won’t measure much more than 170 square\r\nmiles. They hardly seem worth fighting over, these bare coral rocks\r\nwith an occasional drift of soil where coco palms can just hang on.\r\nThe people must subsist largely on fish and coconut products; in\r\naddition, they have the stringy, unsatisfactory fruit of the pandanus\r\nand _babai_. The latter is a bastard taro, eaten in other groups only\r\nwhen famine drives the people to it. Yet it takes a mighty struggle for\r\nthe Gilbertese to raise even these poor things. Over 28,000 population,\r\ncrowded together on a little land, are never more than a jump away from\r\nstarvation. Rainfall is sparse, and on the islands nearest the Equator\r\ndroughts may last for two or three years; at times even the coconut\r\npalms have died, and the people have been reduced to sucking the few\r\ndrops of moisture from fish-eyes. Even after large churches have been\r\nbuilt, with a competent watershed from the roofs, many have died of\r\nthirst, because they were afraid to drink the water from holy places.\r\n\r\nYet what did I find in the Gilberts? Very healthy specimens,\r\nstrapping copper-colored fellows with hair from straight to curly;\r\nbig-shouldered, but not particularly tall. They had the look of men\r\nwho grow what they eat, and work for it. Their average health was in\r\ncontrast to that of the naturally handsome, pale-skinned Polynesians\r\nin the Ellices to the southeast. To these food came more easily from a\r\nricher soil. And must I say it again? There were fewer missions in the\r\nGilberts, whereas the Ellice Islanders were all nominally Christian--as\r\nwitness once more the greasy Mother Hubbards, layer on layer, pressing\r\noil and germs into their beautiful bodies. Dirt and laziness seemed\r\nto have followed the Cross into charming lagoons which once inspired\r\nStevenson’s prose poems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were traveling on the High Commission yacht _Pioneer_, where Printer\r\nJohann Sebastian Bach’s son Bill shared the cabin de luxe with me;\r\nwe had a bathroom of our own, but when the portholes leaked in one\r\ndirection the toilet leaked in another. I envied Malakai, who bunked on\r\ndeck. It was one of the morning’s ceremonies for Malakai to come down\r\nand see to it that young Bach got his bath. Bill was of the age when\r\nall boys are anti-soap, and it was worth getting up to see a cannibal’s\r\nscientific grandson enforcing hygiene on a great composer’s descendant;\r\nBill’s treble, “Ow, ow!” against Malakai’s grim bass, “You aren’t\r\nfinished till you wash the other ear!”\r\n\r\nThat got us to Rotumah, an island which for some mystic reason is\r\nconsidered a part of Fiji, but lies nearer the Ellice group. Because\r\npublic health is concerned with sociology, politics, geography, history\r\nand anthropology as well as worms and germs, let me use Rotumah as an\r\nexample of what lavish Nature can do to a people.\r\n\r\nThe Rotumans were among the world’s laziest, their island among the\r\nworld’s richest. Crops grew while you slept; therefore the natives\r\nslept or went to a party. This was coconut wealth, prodigal and wasted.\r\nUp in the volcanic mountains it took a little work to get at the palms,\r\nso they were never gotten at. Nuts ripened, dropped, rotted or fed the\r\nisland’s expensive pigs. Ask an owner about his wealth in coconuts and\r\nhe’d guess he had plenty.\r\n\r\nThey were a delightfully mixed race. Their ancestors had been generous\r\nto ships that stopped there to “refresh” their crews. In the unwritten\r\nhistory of Oceania the Tongafiti conquerors used Rotumah as one of the\r\nsteppingstones that let them spread the Polynesian race over the South\r\nPacific. As I found Rotumah, there was little evidence of that fierce\r\nand noble background.\r\n\r\nTo get things done they hired Fijian labor at eight or ten shillings\r\na day. If a Rotuman ran into debt he merely sent his hirelings out to\r\ngather a few more nuts--or that was what they were doing when I got\r\nthere. Some 900 acres of land produced 2,000 tons of copra annually.\r\nMild efficiency could have boosted the output to 6,000 tons. But why be\r\nefficient?\r\n\r\nDid you want to buy a pig? Well, he would cost you about fourteen\r\npounds. What a price for a pig! Yes, sir, but remember that he’s been\r\nfed on very expensive copra, and has already eaten twice his value. But\r\nwhy not fatten him on something else? That would be a lot of trouble,\r\nsir, and our pigs are used to copra. There’s plenty of copra. And\r\nmaybe, sir, we couldn’t afford to sell you a pig anyhow. We’re giving\r\nanother feast tomorrow, and what’s a feast without a pig?\r\n\r\nIn the Rotuman’s Melano-Poly-Malay-European veins there was a dash of\r\nNegro, and right royal. In the blackbirding days an Afro-American,\r\nprobably a slave himself, was cast ashore and proceeded to make himself\r\nking. He seemed a kindly monarch, and didn’t have the tragic finish\r\nof the other Emperor Jones. He taught the people how to work,--they\r\nsay,--but he’s been a long time dead.\r\n\r\nWhen I got there they were all Christians; maybe that was because it\r\nwas so easy to find a church. The Catholic church had a £600 belfry\r\nand a splendid mosaic altar. Things like that were prosperity’s\r\nblow-off, and when the Rotumans didn’t know what else to do with\r\ntheir surplus they built another fine concrete monument. There were\r\nmonuments everywhere, mortuary, honorary, sumptuary. It was like our\r\nwealth-parade in the Coolidge Administration. Rotuman pig-feasts were\r\ncostly milestones in every life. It cost £100 worth of celebration for\r\na baby to be born, £200 for a man to die, £800 for him to be properly\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nAnd on the doctor’s side of this generous picture I found Rotumah\r\nheavily laden with hookworm, yaws, tuberculosis and leprosy. Over 90\r\nper cent of the inhabitants were covered with scabies. A sticky, hot,\r\nfly-and-mosquito-ridden island, with hardly a breeze to break the dead\r\nmonotony of climate.... A stone wall, built along the shore road, kept\r\nin the pigs and kept out whatever breeze might blow. That didn’t matter\r\nmuch in Rotumah, where the people seemed too lazy to draw a deep breath.\r\n\r\nMost of the elderly men, by the way, had elephantiasis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBecause elephantiasis was something I had to meet as I went along,\r\nit may be apropos to explain what I have mentioned before: that it\r\nis not a disease, but the manifestation of a disease. The disease is\r\nfilariasis, caused by the filarial worm, a long, threadlike creature\r\nthat lives in the lymphatic glands. The eggs pass into the lymphatic\r\nand blood streams and hatch into microfilariae. The low power of a\r\nmicroscope will show them in a drop of blood, but their sex cannot be\r\ndistinguished. They take on sexual form in the body of the mosquito\r\nwhich has drawn up infected blood, and the mosquito injects them into\r\nthe veins of the next victim.\r\n\r\nNow definitely male and female, they make their way into the lymph\r\nglands, grow and breed by millions. The female lays her fertile eggs,\r\nwhich complete the cycle by becoming microfilariae. Because there is\r\nmuch destruction of microfilariae in the mosquito’s body, and because\r\nthere is much wastage of the parasites in the reinfection of a human,\r\nthe disease is rather slow to develop. Mosquitoes may bite millions of\r\ntimes before enough male and female worms accumulate to cause symptoms.\r\nIt usually takes years of residence in a mosquito-infected native\r\ncommunity before these ideal conditions meet.\r\n\r\nWith the proper number of parasites comes filarial fever, which\r\nis accompanied by inflammation and abscesses in the lymphatic and\r\nsubcutaneous tissues. The inflammation subsides, but some of the\r\nswelling remains in dependent members of the body, arms, legs, breasts,\r\nvulva and scrotum. These swellings may be caused by dead filaria worms,\r\nwhich block the glands whose function it is to drain a dependent area;\r\nthus the dead worms might impede the return flow of lymph and cause an\r\novergrowth of skin and subcutaneous tissue, slowly piling up to a huge\r\nsize. The skin grows rough like an elephant’s hide, and the monstrous\r\nlimbs add to the elephantine look.\r\n\r\nFilarial fever seems to have little effect on longevity, but causes\r\na lassitude which results in a great labor loss. And when it becomes\r\nelephantoid it impedes any form of activity.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phenomenon is connected with these minute organisms.\r\nThe activity of the microfilariae which the mosquito puts into the\r\nblood stream is similar, in one way, to the habits of the mosquito that\r\nhas carried them. That is to say, if the mosquito is a night-biter,\r\nthe microfilariae are active during the night only. During the day\r\nthey seem to rest quiescent, deep in the recesses of the body. But\r\nif they have been introduced by a day-biting mosquito their behavior\r\nis just the reverse--they are day-active. In the Pacific the disease\r\nis transmitted by the _Culex fatigans_ and by members of the _Aedes_\r\nfamily. The Pacific branch of the _Aedes_ clan is a daytime feeder\r\nwhile the _Culex fatigans_ is a night worker. So afflicted island\r\npeople suffer from an infection that does twenty-four-hour duty.\r\n\r\nIn the Ellice group so many elderly husbands were disabled by\r\nelephantiasis of the scrotum that they often asked for surgical\r\noperations in order to restore domestic harmony; for it was “the\r\nfashion” for old men to marry young wives. At Funafuti Dr. Mac Finney\r\ntold me that one swollen applicant, who had come quite a distance,\r\ngave his age as ninety. (They date their ages from the coming of the\r\nmissionary.) The patient looked a trifle passé, but Mac Finney did a\r\nclean job, and hoped he would recover.\r\n\r\nOn a return voyage Mac Finney saw the old boy coming back on the boat\r\nto Funafuti. The ancient confessed that he was on his way to jail. Why?\r\nWell, when he got off the boat for home, he felt so vigorous that he\r\nhad attacked the first woman he saw.\r\n\r\nThe twin groups, Gilberts and Ellices, were a special problem in the\r\nspread of this disease. The dark-skinned Gilbertese, living a hundred\r\nmiles northwest of the light-skinned Ellice Islanders, seem to have\r\nbeen free of filariasis until modern civilization arrived, although\r\nthe Ellices had been infected for a long time. The writer found this\r\ndisease moving slowly northward in the Gilbert group. Primitive\r\nsavagery and that thin strip of water had long kept the Gilberts in a\r\nstate of quarantine. Then barriers were down, and filariasis reached\r\nthe Gilberts. The British administration made several attempts to\r\nre-establish quarantine, but conditions made it difficult, and they\r\nprobably knew that it was a bit too late; the mischief had already been\r\ndone. Only recently has the machinery of infection been understood. In\r\nseveral groups British medical authorities have made valiant efforts\r\nto check the blight. Their problem has been made more difficult by the\r\nfact that the principal carrier is the “wild mosquito,” a creature that\r\nlives and breeds in the bush. The domestic mosquito is easier to run\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn those ten weeks of inspection we covered 6,500 miles, crossed the\r\nEquator six times and touched the globe’s four hemispheres. In both\r\ngroups the islands are so low-lying that a few miles away they are\r\ninvisible; first you see a plumage of palms, then the border of white\r\nsand; then the glory of lagoons, some of them looking no bigger than\r\nyour hand, others stretching a quarter of a mile, brushing their faint\r\npastel colors against the feathering reef that divides them from the\r\nPacific’s royal blue. I love lagoons.\r\n\r\nOther white men have loved them too. At Funafuti, for example, one of\r\nthe boys who helped us ashore had a tinge of red in his hair and said\r\nhis name was O’Brien. The headman of the town and the native magistrate\r\nwere also O’Briens. O’Briens flocked from every corner until I hoped\r\nto hear a trace of the brogue. But the original O’Brien, who must have\r\nbeen a broth of a boy, had long since passed away and left good deeds\r\nbehind him. In the wicked blackbirding days he had promptly deserted\r\nhis ship and taken up with an island girl. He saved the people with the\r\nadvice that they had better stick by him, as his vessel had come to\r\ntake them into slavery. Blessings on his red head. To keep his Irish\r\nmemory green, fifty-four O’Briens flourished in Funafuti, out of 250\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nExcept for Funafuti all the Ellice Islands had closed lagoons, and to\r\ncome ashore one must run the surf in native canoes, which usually\r\nmeant a ducking, and always a wet bottom. I have never seen so many\r\nchurches to the square mile, for the Ellices are highly Christianized,\r\nas witness the layer upon layer of dragging Mother Hubbards that\r\ncover the women. On small Vaitupu I counted three expensive concrete\r\nchurches, and found that the London Missionary Society’s Samoan teacher\r\nhadn’t liked the acoustics of the first two, so he had had a third\r\nbuilt to suit his voice. In one year, the Ellice Islands had sent\r\n$6,000 to _foreign_ missions! And $60,000 had been devoted to the piety\r\nof 3,000 inhabitants. Churches were objects of superstitious awe. It\r\nwould be sacrilege, they said, to drink rain water from church roofs,\r\nand something awful would happen if they did; their livers might swell\r\nup and burst, for instance.\r\n\r\nUp in the Gilberts, on the other hand, they were only a few years\r\nremoved from the absolute savagery of an era when one island waged\r\nfierce war against another. As it was, about half of them were\r\nnominally Christianized. The Sunday parade to church was a sight worth\r\nwhile. The native ladies wore short fiber skirts and nothing else,\r\nexcept dinky little English hats perked on top of their bushy heads.\r\nFor hadn’t St. Paul said distinctly that no bareheaded woman should\r\nenter the House of God?\r\n\r\nAt Tabatauea on the Gilberts I made a postmortem examination of a\r\ndead king. Since the king had been dead a thousand years, I was not\r\nsurprised that the results were spectacular.\r\n\r\nI was led to a palm-thatched shrine where the bones of Korave, heroic\r\nancestor of the island’s chiefs, were held in veneration; legend tells\r\nof his gigantic size and heroic strength when he led the people of\r\nBeru to the invasion. Before I could be admitted District Commissioner\r\nAnderson had to get the consent of Korave’s entire family connection.\r\nWe came in a canoe, waded through mud, and as very wet spectators got\r\nat last to the assembly hall, the _muniapa_.\r\n\r\nThe whole village had turned out. The Gilbertese converse in shouts,\r\nand the palaver around us sounded like a football game until Mr.\r\nAnderson silenced them to explain how important this occasion was. I\r\nsat there, looking as majestic as a large fat man can after a dousing\r\nin sea water and a sweaty walk. Then the big question. The exalted\r\nvisitor wished to see great Korave’s bones. Immediately the people of\r\nTabatauea went into noisy conference. Abruptly the huddle parted. A\r\nheadman came forward and said yes, we could see the bones.\r\n\r\nHung to the ridgepole was a large basket decorated with white shells.\r\nTwo men carefully washed their hands and lowered the great chief’s\r\nremains. After one glance at the bones, which they had spread on a mat,\r\nI had a keen desire to examine them for myself. But could I? There was\r\na terrible hubbub, every branch of the Korave family yelling at each\r\nother. Then the headman said “all right” with variations.\r\n\r\nThere was a remarkably fine skull, indicating that somebody had had a\r\ngenerous brain pan with plenty of room above the eyebrows. At first I\r\nfound two thigh bones and two tibias, just as any hero should have.\r\nWhen I got around to the two fibulas, the small leg-bones, I found\r\nthem smaller than their mates, and was tactless enough to ask if\r\ntheir ancestor didn’t walk with a limp. Indignant denials. I was more\r\nimpressed still when I picked up another fibula and tibia--golly, the\r\nman must have been three-legged! Also three radii and extra pelvic\r\nbones turned up. It looked as if the late king had three of everything\r\nto the common man’s two. There was a collection of small ribs that\r\nmight have fitted a great many people, but if they had been assembled\r\non Korave’s skeleton they would have presented a new problem in anatomy.\r\n\r\nI disturbed Tabatauea’s faith as gently as I could by asking if they\r\nwere _sure_ these bones all came from the same man. They were very\r\npositively certain. Hadn’t the relics been carefully passed down\r\nthrough the generations? And this simple faith may cast light on some\r\nof the holy relics worshiped in our Christian churches.\r\n\r\nAnderson’s flowery introduction had won much respect for my opinion,\r\nit appeared, for they asked what I could tell them about their mighty\r\nancestor. Already they had allowed me to sit, just for a moment, on\r\nthe enchanted stone where Korave used to sit; it was supposed to have\r\na magic quality of coolness. Sure enough, it was quite cool. So I\r\nmust tell them of their ancestor. The safe bet was to fall back on\r\ngeneralities. I told them that he was a very big man indeed, much\r\nbigger than one of his very large descendants whom I saw in the\r\naudience. Quite truthfully I praised the size of great Korave’s head;\r\nno commonplace man could have worn a skull like that. But my praise\r\nof the bones _in toto_ made the hit of the day. Not only was Korave\r\nremarkable in other things, I said, but he had more bones than any man\r\nI had ever seen. After Anderson translated this he told me that they\r\nwere very grateful for the information, which would be treasured among\r\ntheir legends of the hero.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Kuria it was my professional duty to confer with one of Robert\r\nLouis Stevenson’s least appreciated characters, District Commissioner\r\nMurdock, who had emerged from the days of piracy. Stevenson had\r\nactively disliked Murdock; somewhere in his tales of Apamama and\r\nKing Timbinoka, the novelist had referred to Murdock as “a rat-faced\r\nScotchman with a secretive disposition,” and “Timbinoka’s cook.” The\r\nfeud stemmed on Murdock’s refusal to tell of a thousand and one nights\r\nhe had been concerned in. He had plentiful reason to keep his mouth\r\nshut, for at the time the other Scot was snooping for adventure stories\r\nMurdock was a sort of business manager to the savage king who conquered\r\nKuria and terrorized all surrounding islands. Murdock had also acted\r\nas contact man between the terrible Timbinoka and the terrible Bully\r\nHayes, pirate and blackbirder extraordinary.\r\n\r\nAll the pirate I saw in Murdock was his flaring white mustache; the\r\nmouth below it stayed pretty tight, and he only grunted, until I won\r\nhim over with a fancy new spinner for his fishing. Then he opened up\r\nand talked about himself.\r\n\r\nAs a consumptive lad of nineteen he had come there on a sailing ship\r\nand won Timbinoka’s heart by cooking him a good meal of vittles,\r\nand was hired on the spot. From frying fish he had graduated into\r\ndiplomacy, mostly with Bully Hayes and his slaving deals with\r\nTimbinoka. Hayes, who probably hailed from San Francisco, would clean\r\nout whole islands and carry away the inhabitants to die in the fields\r\nand mines of Australia, Fiji, South America. As a side line, he would\r\nswoop down on the pearl fisheries, gathering the pearls and the girls.\r\nOut at sea he would repaint his ship with a new set of colors, to fool\r\npursuing naval vessels. He often baited his trap with pretty girls; the\r\nladies of Aitutaki were especially tempting, so he would take on a load\r\nof them and keep them in full view as he loitered by various islands.\r\nThen the native men, poor fools, would swim out to be captured and\r\nchained.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, at least, Murdock went as the King’s agent to an\r\nisland where Bully Hayes had carried a shipload of Timbinoka’s warriors\r\nto punish some of His Majesty’s disobedient subjects. When Bully took\r\ncaptives he had the privilege of buying them from Timbinoka. The\r\nmonarch prospered on this industry, and was a tyrant of the old school.\r\nOnce he sent Murdock with 300 slaves for coffee plantations in Mexico\r\nand Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe King’s harem was extensive, and uninvited males were promptly\r\nslain. A splendid rifle shot, Timbinoka kept in practice by pinking\r\ndisobedient wives, usually on the run. He owned every blade of grass,\r\nchased competitors out of his trading stores, forbade missionaries.\r\nHe could be hospitable, but when he said, “Get out!” his guest said\r\ngood-by. He bought liquor, boats and gadgets wholesale. His grand\r\npassion was sewing machines; he had a royal collection in various\r\nstages of decay; and a trader with music boxes to sell received a royal\r\nwelcome. European clothes charmed him, and he couldn’t wait for the\r\nlatest styles to come by boat. So he sent two natives to Auckland to\r\nlearn tailoring. Alas for Timbinoka’s vanity! He got so very fat so\r\nvery soon that the broadest coats and trousers split on him. He spent\r\nhis declining years in an ornamental Mother Hubbard. Murdock showed me\r\na photograph of him wearing one; so fat he couldn’t walk, he was being\r\ncarried by eight men.\r\n\r\nOnce he sent Murdock to investigate a wreck on Apamama. The crew was\r\nfound in a sorry plight; natives had given them food and shelter--but\r\nthey had run out of liquor. So Murdock got a large demijohn and filled\r\nit with rum from one of the King’s hogsheads. He reported this to\r\nTimbinoka, who asked, “Where you catch im dis feller rum?” Murdock\r\nidentified the hogshead and his King said, “Hum hum, hum. One time one\r\nfeller man belong Sydney he like im one feller head belong kanaka. So\r\nhe pickle him along dis feller rum.”\r\n\r\nIn short, Timbinoka had severed some enemy heads which a trader bought,\r\npickled and sent to a scientist in Australia. After this transaction\r\nthe enterprising trader sold the rum back to Timbinoka. The monarch\r\nfound out about it, so he didn’t use the liquor. But the shipwrecked\r\nsailors got their share of it and His Majesty was vastly amused when\r\nhe told them what they had been drinking and saw them get sick. He\r\ncommissioned Murdock to buy their ship for five pounds. Timbinoka\r\nassembled the whole kingdom with everything that would float. By main\r\nstrength and awkwardness they raised the ship, which was repaired and\r\nbecame the Royal Navy. With a regal gesture Timbinoka sent the crew\r\nback to Australia, at his expense.\r\n\r\nBefore his death the King got his useful cook a job as District\r\nOfficer, a post he served well the rest of his life. Once, he told me,\r\nhe found an extremely leprous village, so he burned it down and moved\r\nthe inhabitants to new quarters. From these particular people, he said,\r\nhe never heard of leprosy again. It sounds a bit fishy, for to this day\r\nno experimenter has found out how the leprosy germ is imparted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of Timbinoka’s royal descendants was at Kuria when we were there.\r\nA big man, he had once been handsome, but he was going to fat and his\r\nbaldness rivaled mine. His morals were everybody’s business, even among\r\nthe Gilbertese, who are remarkably sophisticated for so primitive\r\na folk. Maybe their vices had drifted in from Tahiti, or from an\r\nespecially low crop of beachcombers. Possibly the discouragement of the\r\nharem system had demoralized them. At any rate, the Royal Descendant\r\nwas no match for a nice girl.\r\n\r\nHe served as background for a story that came to me as island tales do.\r\nYears later I found a Frenchman, Mr. X, looking for a job, and wondered\r\nwhy a man of his education and intelligence should be out of work.\r\nHe seemed so pitifully anxious that I pulled wires and got him a job\r\nmanaging a trading station. He didn’t keep it very long. And this is\r\nwhy:--\r\n\r\nHe had been a priest, serving faithfully on these islands. Marie\r\nwas an extremely attractive half-caste girl in his school. With his\r\nBishop’s consent he encouraged her wish to become a nun; she preferred\r\nthis choice to marrying the Royal Descendant, her family’s selection.\r\nIf Father X was in love with her, it was a passion he religiously\r\ndenied, although he went on with her education while she was a novice.\r\nThe European nuns in the convent made her life especially hard; they\r\ndisliked the idea of a half-caste in the intimacy of full sisterhood.\r\nShe worked for years as a drudge, scrubbing floors. Meanwhile her\r\nfamily were constantly nagging her to leave the convent and marry the\r\naristocrat.\r\n\r\nOne night she went to Father X, who had been her only earthly friend.\r\nHer tears and his efforts to console her were too much for both of\r\nthem. The Devil he had downed so long came forth. A few weeks later\r\nFather X went to his Bishop, a wise and worldly churchman. “Don’t take\r\nit so seriously,” said the Bishop, “those things will happen. Let me\r\ntransfer you to Australia until it blows over.” “No,” insisted Father\r\nX, “she’s going to have my baby, and my child must be legitimate.” The\r\nBishop shrugged it off; he shrugged off Father X’s priestly frock, too.\r\n\r\nFather X, now a layman, went out into the world. The first thing he did\r\nwas to marry Marie, and when the baby was born he did his level best to\r\nraise and educate the child. That might have been easy in a land where\r\nclever white men are scarce, but Mr. X came up against a stone wall.\r\nHe was an unfrocked priest, he had married a half-caste under queer\r\nconditions. He wandered from pillar to post, getting small jobs, losing\r\nthem, feeding his family as best he could.\r\n\r\nThen things brightened for him. With his wife and child he wandered\r\nto Australia. A clever agriculturist, he invented a cure for some\r\nprevalent tree blight, and cashed in. He was now laying aside enough\r\nmoney to support his family; then he would go back to France to reenter\r\nhis order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ambassador without portfolio, a doctor without a license, I went\r\nover the leper situation on the Gilberts and Ellices. The twin groups\r\nhad their small share of the disease, but when I spoke to certain\r\nauthorities and asked for co-operation in the model colony we were\r\nplanning for Mokogai, the response was not too encouraging. Years later\r\na sort of compromise affair was started on Tarawa on the Gilberts, but\r\nit proved such a dismal failure that we finally got our way and had the\r\npatients transferred to Mokogai.\r\n\r\nOn this first G and E survey I had gone on preaching my crusade for\r\nmodernized native practitioners. Government schools in the two groups\r\nwere effective, although European training can be overdone; the scope\r\nof the native mind is circumscribed by the shadow of the coconut tree.\r\nGilbertese intelligence was high. When I looked over such schools as\r\nthe one at Bairiki and saw bright faces knit in an earnest desire to\r\nlearn, and when I observed their steady progress, I knew that here were\r\npotential N.M.P.’s. They were the sort who could learn medicine, and\r\ncould return to their home islands to practise and to teach. Malakai\r\nwas with me everywhere, an object lesson to them.\r\n\r\nAt Funafuti one of our old school N.M.P.’s, a giant from Tonga named\r\nJosaia, came aboard ship. I had known him as a pharmacist’s assistant\r\nin Auckland before he took up medicine, and we were renewing our\r\nfriendship when Josaia paused and scowled at a well muscled native\r\nwho had shuffled around me. Josaia said, “You have just insulted the\r\nDoctor. You have walked across his shadow.” Whereupon Josaia picked\r\nthe man up, tossed him over his head and through an open door. Josaia\r\nwas something of a storm king, and he was temporarily out of a job.\r\nHe was an excellent surgeon. If he operated too often for tubercular\r\nglands in the neck, it was because of his lack of proper training. In\r\nthose days many practitioners confused yaws with tuberculosis and acted\r\naccordingly. Josaia had been on the G and E group for a half-dozen\r\nyears, working his head off for six pounds a month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the highly missionized Ellices there was much religious confusion,\r\nalthough I cannot vouch for the current story about the London\r\nMissionary Society lady. She kept her girls carefully guarded on a\r\nsmall island with a lagoon. When several showed signs of approaching\r\nmaternity she asked who was to blame. “The Holy Ghost,” they replied.\r\nImmaculate conception was all right, they thought, and didn’t mention\r\nboys who crossed the lagoon in the dark of night.\r\n\r\nOn the less missionized Gilberts, religious affairs once took a more\r\nviolent turn. An island had been having the usual squabble between\r\nCatholics and the London Missionary Society--the latter prevailed,\r\ncontrolled by native teachers. A native preacher fanned up a religious\r\nmania which swept the people. Self-appointed “Apostles and Angels of\r\nGod” took over the works, led by a local “Virgin Mary.” The Angels\r\nrounded up all the Romanists they could find and killed several. They\r\nhad locked up the native Catholic magistrate, were marching on him\r\nwith a cross, and would have used it had it not been for the courage\r\nof one villager who went by canoe for the District Officer and white\r\nmissionaries. The rescue, a few Europeans facing a mass of howling\r\nsavages, required tactful argument. Subsequent investigation, which\r\nresulted in the island’s paying a fine, revealed scandal among the\r\nAngels. John the Baptist had been intimate with the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\nWhere the religious problem puzzled the righteous, the medical\r\nquestions confounded the doctor. Ocean Island, one of the world’s great\r\nphosphate bonanzas, was headquarters for the Gilbert and Ellice groups.\r\nA British syndicate mined the product. Arthur Grimble, Cambridge M.A.,\r\nwas acting District Commissioner and an ethnologist who had made useful\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nFrom the doctor’s point of view too many Chinese had been imported\r\nto Ocean Island, although the Government’s very good hospital was\r\ndoing more than its share. The trouble was that Gilbertese and Ellice\r\nIslanders worked beside the orientals; they caught the imported\r\ndiseases and carried them home. All through the twin groups I saw\r\nevidence of infections which the strangers were bringing to a lovely\r\npeople. Pathologically, the march of disease was beginning to show.\r\nYaws, which seemed to have been brought by civilization, was making\r\nheavy inroads. Tuberculosis was working its way into handsome youths,\r\nwho lacked the European’s immunity. Filariasis was a vexing puzzle,\r\nbecause it seemed impossible to control the mosquitoes that carried it.\r\nIntestinal parasites were fortunately few; the people lived near the\r\nbeaches, and tidewater is Nature’s handy sewage system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn my notebook I jotted down “interesting items”:--\r\n\r\n Gilbertese stick-throwers.... One man with wreaths of flowers over\r\n head and shoulders, the other with pointed, fire-hardened stick\r\n about a yard long. Stick-thrower stood away from wreath-bearer only\r\n five yards, poised the stick, and _after it had left his hand_ named\r\n the wreath that would be cut off. He never missed. If a man is\r\n accidentally killed by this, there is no legal penalty....\r\n\r\n Concrete-topped graves to keep the _tevoro_ from getting out. Graves\r\n decorated with dear possessions of deceased, derby hats, bottles,\r\n bicycles, spectacles, pipes. Saw one piano....\r\n\r\n Wreckage that had floated to Tarawa from San Francisco ... common\r\n occurrence because of ocean currents....\r\n\r\n Spiritualistic séance ... two old men and a hag sit in a one-room\r\n native house ... smoking short pipes, they go into a trance ... you\r\n ask them to make prophecies, simple ones like what’s tomorrow’s\r\n weather or when will the boat get in ... there’s a short silence, then\r\n you hear the queerest, eeriest whistling along the ridgepole ... pipes\r\n never leave their mouths. You run out to see if there is somebody\r\n on the roof ... bright moonlight, no accessory visible ... their\r\n prophecies are all wrong. They say it will rain tomorrow, but it’s\r\n clear, and the boat they name for Tuesday is a week late.... Probably\r\n ventriloquism....\r\n\r\n All over the Pacific you hear brave stories of divers who cut the\r\n throats of man-eating sharks. When I ask about it they usually say\r\n “They do it in the Gilberts.” Made a standing offer of £5 for anybody\r\n who could do the trick. No takers. In Santa Ana, Solomons, I once saw\r\n boys thump sharks on the nose and take fish away from them. Here,\r\n when a canoe upsets, the natives climb into the wet sail, to avoid\r\n sharks....\r\n\r\n But wonderful canoeing. Government is reviving the old custom of giant\r\n building. Saw one 109 feet long, sheer as a knife blade and with an\r\n outrigger float big as a young canoe. Could carry 150 natives; same\r\n people that once steered vast distances by the stars and with charts\r\n made of twigs and string. Gilbertese boys now prefer bicycles, but\r\n they’re making canoes on a grand scale....\r\n\r\n District Officer of Tabatauea has one with accommodations like a\r\n yacht. I went out in a 30-footer, very fast. When they tack they\r\n disengage the mast in the stern and step it into a socket in the bow.\r\n Outrigger lifted clean out of the water, three men on it to keep it\r\n steady.... I got on to add my heavy weight. As we neared the ship,\r\n showing off, the outrigger’s framework stood almost upright, like a\r\n fence. We scooted around again and one of the native “captains” ran\r\n around on the uplifted outrigger. Seeing is believing. The swiftest of\r\n these canoes can make 18 knots. At the regatta in Sydney Harbor they\r\n rule them out--too fast, they always win....\r\n\r\nI also made notes on the white inhabitants, and with a touch of\r\nsadness. Many of them had been so long away from the outer world\r\nand were so hungry for the sight of new faces that they joined the\r\n_Pioneer_ at the slightest excuse until the boat looked like a picnic\r\nexcursion. The resident physician was with us. A young cadet named\r\nJones kept sending messengers, saying that he must be seen at once, as\r\nhe’d had a serious accident. In mercy’s name we went to his island,\r\n200 miles off our course--and found that he had nothing worse than a\r\nsplinter in his leg and a slightly wrenched back. What he really wanted\r\nwas an invitation for himself and his wife to join the joy ride, and I\r\ncertainly sympathized with them. But the ship was already crowded to\r\nthe gunwales.\r\n\r\nThe island group’s treasurer made the trip to check each island’s\r\nfinances. He was a pleasant man, with a decided character of his own.\r\nSomehow I wasn’t surprised when he mildly informed me that he was a\r\ngrandson of the frightful Bully Hayes. I had my phonograph along and\r\ndelighted him by turning on the latest ditties from New York. Yes,\r\nhe had a Victrola, he said, but the tunes it played were so mildewed\r\nthat even his children were tired of them. When he got off the boat I\r\ngave him a record of “Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean,” and he was ever so\r\ngrateful.... About the time our ship was turning back toward Fiji I\r\nheard of his death. For some morbid tropical reason he had taken his\r\nown life.\r\n\r\nHis story had a ghostly finish. When I reached my office in Suva I\r\nfound a letter from him, dated a few weeks back, thanking me for the\r\nrecord. It had given the children so much fun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was forced to conclude that white colonists of the Gilbert group\r\nneeded a doctor more than the natives did. Monotony of life there must\r\neventually depress the health of every European. The food was a trial\r\nto the civilized stomach; nothing but coconuts, fish and that stringy,\r\ntasteless root, the _babai_; and for variety whatever tinned goods the\r\ntrader happened to have. If the Devil gave me a bad choice, I should\r\nrather live on the Ellices than the Gilberts--and rather on Rotumah\r\nthan on the Ellices. Those are the three spots on the Pacific that I’m\r\nleast fond of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA LITTLE KINGDOM AND A GREAT QUEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chief Medical Officer of the Tongan Islands was away on leave.\r\nDr. Minty, his competent assistant and the only other medical officer\r\non Tongatabu, called me in to assist in an emergency operation on Her\r\nMajesty, Salote Tubou, monarch of the last surviving native kingdom on\r\nthe South Pacific. This was at Nukualofa, the capital.\r\n\r\nDr. Minty had no anesthetist, and asked me to help him out; it was a\r\njob I didn’t relish, for the responsibility would be pretty heavy,\r\nand surgical operations in the hot tropics are always something of\r\na gamble. The Queen lay on a bed in one of the royal chambers. Her\r\nbeautiful eyes turned toward me, her friendly lips said that she was\r\nglad that I had come. Her consort, Prince Tungi, bent his huge Tongan\r\nframe over her, consoling her and buoying her courage. It was my first\r\npersonal medical service to reigning royalty, an adventure among\r\ngiants, for the Queen of Tonga was two-and-a-half inches over six feet\r\nand weighed over 300 pounds. She came of a family of giants; her father\r\nhad been even larger, and her great-grandfather George Tubou the First\r\nhad been over six feet five inches and built in proportion. She wasn’t\r\nfat, either. The breadth of her shoulders showed tremendous physical\r\nstrength. She was a woman of heroic size, a proper mother of Polynesian\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready. I said, “Your Majesty, breathe regularly, and\r\ndeeply. If you find the anesthetic is coming too fast, raise your\r\nhand and I’ll give you a breath of air; but not too often.” I started\r\nthe stuff going and she raised her hand. I gave her air and started\r\nagain. Again she raised her hand and kept on raising it until I said as\r\ndeferentially as I could, “Remember, Your Majesty, there is no royal\r\nway of taking an anesthetic.” After that she was still as a mouse, an\r\nideal patient. Her marvelous chest expansion, breathing in the vapor,\r\nwas like the opening and shutting of a great accordion; her chest\r\nseemed to lift a foot.\r\n\r\nGetting her in her bed was no job for a weakling. Prince Tungi was for\r\ncarrying her in his arms; he was quite capable of it, but I wanted to\r\nkeep an eye on her breathing and said, “Don’t be a hog, Tungi, move\r\ndown and give me a share.” My arms hardly reached under her shoulders\r\nand I was relieved when the move was completed safely. She was one of\r\nthe handsomest, biggest women I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nMinty’s rapid, efficient job should have been nobody’s business; but\r\nan operation on royalty is always of great national moment, and the\r\nkingdom was agog. Especially in the European section; for Tonga was\r\nprosperous enough to employ a great many foreigners to fill government\r\nposts. Next morning Bob Denny, the picturesque Scottish postmaster,\r\ngave me the first inquisition. “Doctor, didn’t the Queen have an\r\noperation? What was it for?” I said, “I only gave her the anesthetic.”\r\nHe couldn’t understand my obtuseness and shouted, “BUT WHAT WAS\r\nTHE MATTER WITH HER?” I said, “That’s the Queen’s and Dr. Minty’s\r\nbusiness.” I knew that if he asked Minty he would be rounded up with a\r\nshort turn.\r\n\r\nIn the South Pacific, where everybody’s business is your own,\r\nAesculapian secrecy was never quite understood. When Postmaster Denny\r\nfound that I wouldn’t talk about the royal operation he generously\r\nforgave me by offering me some pamphlets addressed to a lady who was\r\naway. “They might be interesting,” he said, “but you’d better get them\r\nback in a week. She’s due about then, and she’s cranky about her mail.”\r\n\r\nFor my share in the much-discussed operation I was rewarded in royal\r\nTongan fashion. The house we lived in was loaded down with gifts\r\nof appreciation: rolls of fine tapa, huge chunks of roast pork and\r\nquantities of selected Tongan fruit.\r\n\r\nThese gifts had become familiar to me; in May of the previous year I\r\nhad accepted an invitation to make a hookworm survey of the Kingdom\r\nof Tonga. I spent three months there the first year of the survey.\r\nMy family and Malakai accompanied me. We showed the Foundation film\r\n“Unhooking the Hookworm” with great effectiveness in the local movie\r\ntheater to large crowds which assembled, docile to the Queen’s command.\r\nIn the remoter areas we fell back on the hookworm charts. The response\r\nin specimens was splendid. This was what the Tongans liked--they were\r\nalready interested in health, and here was something new for nothing.\r\nOur examinations yielded little noteworthy in the way of hookworm\r\ndisease. The infection rate was low and the number of worms per head\r\nwas low. I judged this was because the Tongans still obeyed the old\r\nPolynesian tabus about the disposal of excrement; we also found that\r\nmost houses in community groups had latrines of a sort, though these\r\nwere inadequate. But their water supplies were awful. There are almost\r\nno running streams and the drinking water was largely obtained from\r\nshallow wells, which were subject to great contamination because pigs,\r\nfowls, horses and humans shared them.\r\n\r\nThe pig question came up right away. The Chief Medical Officer wanted\r\nme to say that pigs carry hookworm to human beings, and that theory ran\r\nafoul of my conviction to the contrary. The C.M.O. and I ceased to be\r\nfriends after I refused to agree with him. He was a Scot. Scots have\r\nabout the best medical minds. When they find that a theory is right\r\nnothing can budge them. You seldom run across one who will devote all\r\nhis native stubbornness to a shaky hypothesis.\r\n\r\nWell, I’m a bit stubborn myself, and on the question of pigs I had my\r\nreasons. One of the weaknesses in native diet is the shortage of meat,\r\nfresh or otherwise. Europeans coming into native life immediately\r\nwant to put pigs in corrals. I knew an Irish doctor who didn’t rest\r\nsatisfied until he had enforced such a regulation. He hailed from a\r\nland where, according to legend, “they keep the pig in the parlor”; but\r\nto the native such intimacy isn’t good form. My observation has been\r\nthat when pigs are enclosed in the corral, the meat supply soon runs\r\nout. Why? Because one man objects to feeding the other man’s pig; keep\r\nthem in a common enclosure and they are gradually killed off, with no\r\nreplacements. When pigs are allowed to run loose in the villages they\r\npick up their own food, or most of it. This is the native way. Much as\r\nI have looked into the subject, I know no Pacific island disease that\r\nis carried by pigs. Had I agreed with statements to the contrary, to\r\nsatisfy the esthetics of a few foreigners, I could not have been honest\r\nwith my own convictions.\r\n\r\nTongans are notably robust and resistant to disease, as we shall see,\r\nand I attribute it in no small measure to a generous supply of pork,\r\nadded to their other foods.\r\n\r\nTongan good feeding and abundant hospitality almost made a wreck of a\r\nvisiting Fijian football team. I saw the first match of that series,\r\nmuch to my sorrow, for I am Fijian to the bone. When the boys came\r\nto Tonga they were regarded as much the superior team, and when I\r\ntalked with Native Practitioner Savanada, one of the players, all\r\nwas confidence. But on the field of glory Fiji was dull and heavy as\r\nlead. Then the saddened Savanada told me why. On the thirty-six-hour\r\nsteamer trip to Tonga the Fijians had had little to eat. The minute\r\nthey stepped ashore they were confronted with a feast. Poor, starved\r\nFijians! There were more roast pigs than they had ever seen at one\r\ntime, heaped up with trimmings of yams and succulent breadfruit, and\r\nchickens and fish to fill in the crevices.\r\n\r\nWhen they went on the field they were a little like Mark Twain’s\r\nJumping Frog of Calaveras County, artfully weighted down. The crafty\r\nTongans, by the way, played on empty stomachs. All over the South\r\nPacific, a sharp trick like this is known as “Tongafiti.”\r\n\r\nTonga won the second game, too, with me yelling my head off for the\r\nglory of Fiji. This time Savanada explained it away with a dignity\r\nworthy of his chiefly rank: “Queen Salote was present, and it wouldn’t\r\nhave been courteous for us, as her guests, to win.” But Fiji won the\r\nlast game hands down, and every time the Tongan team came to Fiji the\r\nkingdom’s athletic pride was lowered a hitch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpeaking of “Tongafiti,” as far as I can find out the word is a\r\ncompound of _Tonga_ and _Viti_ (Fiji), and it is probable that the\r\nPacific’s ancient conquerors took Fijian warriors along with them in\r\nthe days when they were the Huns and Vandals of their time.\r\n\r\nSikiana had been cleaned out by “Tongafiti” people; there was evidence\r\nthat they had fought their way via the fringing Polynesian islands\r\nto the west, conquering as they went; at the tip of the Solomons the\r\npeople of little Rennell Island had beaten these warriors by luring\r\nthem up on the sharp coral, which mangled their bare feet. One end\r\nof Rotumah is still settled by a chief who is descended from Tongan\r\ninvaders, so is one end of Mangaia on the Cooks. For two or three\r\ncenturies the Tongans made slaves of the Samoans; at last Malietoa\r\ndrove them off, and they promised never to return except in peace. Then\r\nTonga forgot the arts of war, but in the seventeenth century it became\r\nfashionable for their chiefs to go over to Fiji and join forces with\r\none or the other of their warring provinces. These trips were a sort\r\nof Grand Tour, a part of their education. They were always welcome\r\nbecause they were unafraid of charging a fortified position, something\r\nthat the Fijian always dreaded. Chief Ma’afu, descending on Fiji, would\r\nhave unseated Thakombau had the British not intervened.\r\n\r\nContact with Melanesia has given the Tongan a slightly browner coloring\r\nthan the golden skin of the pure Polynesian; those portions of dark\r\nFiji where Tongan warriors and mission teachers were most frequent can\r\nstill be picked by lighter skins and other Tongan stigmata. Tongans\r\nhave a stoutness, a fiber, that excels that of all other Polynesians.\r\nIn many ways they are the superior natives of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cook discovered them in 1770, although seventeenth-century\r\nnavigators had sighted them. Because of their kindly reception Cook\r\ncalled them “the Friendly Islands”; he didn’t know that he would have\r\nbeen butchered and his boats seized if the chiefs had not disagreed\r\namong themselves. A few years later the _Port au Prince_ was less\r\nlucky. A young boy appropriately named Mariner was the only one saved;\r\nFinau Ulukalala, the leading chief, happened to take a fancy to him.\r\nMariner lived there for four years, and after his escape a Dr. Martin\r\ntook down his enthralling story, which reads like a dime novel.\r\n\r\nThe missionary followed the white trader, and Tonga was a cockpit for\r\nreligious factions. The last chapter of that bitter feud was written\r\nas late as 1924. It was Methodist against Catholic at first; finally\r\nMethodist against Methodist--actually Wesleyan against Wesleyan.\r\nTaufahau, a giant chief of the Kanakupolu family and destined to be\r\nking, first saw the writing on the wall and joined the Wesleyans; by\r\nthat time the Tongans had lost their old religion, the worship of\r\nPolynesian deities. Taufahau may have yielded to a greater magic than\r\nhe knew. He may have become a true Christian, although this seems\r\ndifficult to believe. Certainly he seized the opportunity to weld the\r\ngroup into a political unit. A great warrior, a great strategist, a\r\ngreat man, he was enthroned in 1826 and lived until 1894. Under his\r\nkingship all Tonga became Christian, mostly Wesleyan.\r\n\r\nIn his later years, around the seventies and eighties, scandals arose\r\nin the Church. Much money was exacted in religious offerings, and\r\nafter the missioners had feathered their own nests, the balance was\r\nsent out of the country. Tonga, mind you, was just emerging from the\r\nStone Age--yet she was supporting foreign missions! Finally Taufahau,\r\nnow King George the First, decided to head his own state Church, the\r\nFree Church of Tonga. There were cruel persecutions of Wesleyans who\r\nwouldn’t recant; many were killed, thousands driven out of Tonga.\r\nGeorge the First had a renegade Wesleyan missionary named Baker as his\r\nguide, and the guide became Prime Minister. Although Prime Minister\r\nBaker served the kingdom with some permanently wholesome laws, his rule\r\ndegenerated in the course of years. As much appears to have been wasted\r\nthrough him as through the former rule of the missions, and things\r\ncame to such a pass that the British High Commission had to intervene\r\nand institute a protectorate over Tonga. The Free Church pursued its\r\nerratic way through the reign of George the Second of Tonga, who died\r\nin 1918, and into the reign of Queen Salote. In 1924 she joined the\r\nWesleyan Church, and the Free Church ceased to be Tonga’s official\r\nfaith. The Free Church left a bad financial record, and had little\r\nregard for honest business practices. For many years Tongan religion\r\nhad been largely a matter of politics. Whenever a monarch switched his\r\nreligion there had been a corresponding switch in the opposition to the\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nThe Tubous are the sole survivors of numerous native dynasties which\r\nthe first white men found in the Pacific. The Tongan kingdom has\r\noutlived the greedy gobblings of Western powers, and the people have\r\nkept their identity through every political crisis.\r\n\r\nThe Tubous have a past longer than that of any other ruling dynasty\r\ntoday. Their kings first came from Eastern Samoa, probably from Ta’u,\r\nwhich seems to have been the cradle of great Polynesian kings. The Tui\r\nTonga was the spiritual and temporal head of the state, and Aho’-itu\r\nwas the first of the Tui Tonga. A later Tui Tonga wearied of the double\r\nburden and turned temporal affairs over to his brother Tui Haatakalaua,\r\nand Haatakalaua finally passed his power over to another brother, Tui\r\nKanakupolu. When King George the First took the throne, he abolished\r\nthe title of Tui Tonga. Joeli, last claimant to that ancient title,\r\ndied after my first visit to the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis seems a pretty sketchy way to pass over a thousand years of\r\nhistory. When I first saw Tonga its two great historical strains were\r\njoined in marriage. The Haatakalaua and the Kanakupolu families united\r\nin Tungi and Salote. The royal wedding was in 1918. With three sons the\r\ndynastic succession seemed safe.\r\n\r\nIn 1924 the reigning couple were more highly educated than most of\r\ntheir subjects. Salote had studied in Auckland and Tungi had gone to\r\nan excellent school in Sydney. Ata, one of the great nobles, had also\r\nbeen to Sydney for his education. Otherwise only a few half-caste\r\nchildren had enjoyed foreign advantages. Generally speaking, the people\r\nknew only a few words of English.\r\n\r\nThe Tongans were great nationalists with a mortal dread of being taken\r\nover by one of the Powers. They were even afraid of England, although\r\nthey seemed quite safe in that direction. The British protectorate over\r\nthe kingdom was (and is) a very light one. Great Britain was selecting\r\nChief Justices and Auditors for them, and quite naturally the Tongans\r\npaid the salaries. The British Consul and Agent acted as adviser to the\r\nQueen, and it was his duty to approve any financial expenditures. With\r\nthese restrictions, Tonga is today a free constitutional monarchy, with\r\na parliament and the Queen’s privy council.\r\n\r\nThe point of friction has always been the British Consul’s right to\r\nveto expenditures. If he was well trained in the British civil service\r\nthe plan worked out well. But the job occupies not more than an hour\r\nof the Consul’s day, and too many of them have used the leisure to\r\nindulge in petty statesmanship and tyrannies far beyond their official\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe financial veto is a powerful weapon, but the check in expenditure\r\nhas been Tonga’s salvation. It is hard for Western civilization\r\nto understand the Polynesian’s utter lack of money sense--or the\r\nMelanesian’s, for that matter. From early childhood the European has\r\nlearned the art of getting and spending. Not so the Pacific Islander.\r\nAlthough in many ways they may excel us intellectually, it is next to\r\nimpossible to make them understand that coined metal isn’t something\r\nyou pick off trees and throw around for the moment’s enjoyment. It’s\r\nall great fun, while the party lasts. Only by hard knocks will the\r\nnative learn money economy. Oftentimes his education comes in jail,\r\nwhere he can study at leisure the disadvantages of Western methods over\r\nhis old-time communal system.\r\n\r\nWild extravagances of Church and State forced Great Britain to set\r\nup a protectorate to prevent Tonga from falling into other hands.\r\nThe British Consul, with keys to the treasury, had to span the great\r\nvoid which is the Tongan money sense. Today I know of no other nation\r\nso financially sound as Tonga--no debt, internal or external, and a\r\nsurplus of £150,000, about twenty-five dollars per head. For the United\r\nStates this would be a capital of well over three billions, with no\r\ndebts at all. Not so bad for Tonga, a land that saw iron for the first\r\ntime about 250 years ago. And the kingdom’s wealth is well distributed,\r\ntoo. Every Tongan male at the age of eighteen receives from his\r\ngovernment eight-and-a-half acres of fertile land and a town lot to\r\nbuild his home on.\r\n\r\nThe white man goes through these islands and sees many things that may\r\nbe comic from his biased viewpoint. But shouldn’t we turn the laugh\r\non ourselves in the light of New Deals and Planned Economies? While\r\nWestern civilization is eating its accumulated fat and beginning to\r\ngnaw its own vitals, I wonder if some Tongan Brain Trust might not lead\r\nus out of our wilderness of bureaucratic taxes, and teach us what the\r\nAbundant Life really means.\r\n\r\nIn 1924 Queen Salote was in her young twenties, but her mind was\r\nmatured by experience in government, and she was quick to see the help\r\nour Foundation could give her little realm of 25,000 souls. We were\r\nworking like devils to give Tonga an adequate water supply, and I wore\r\nmy diplomacy threadbare trying to convince the Scottish C.M.O. of the\r\nobvious need. Although I am a chronic admirer of the Scots--and haven’t\r\nI seen them survive and carry on in posts that would have demolished\r\na less sturdy breed?--this Medical Officer remained a prickly thistle\r\nthat drove me to distraction. I’m a peaceable man, as the Irish say.\r\nCertainly I’ve managed somehow to get along with a great variety of\r\nhuman types.\r\n\r\nBut not with this one. The few faint hairs that remained on my head\r\nbristled at the sight of him. He bothered those hairs worse than\r\nthe Tongan flies that swarmed around breakfast at Bill Smith’s\r\nboarding house; there I learned to cover my bald spot with a\r\nknotted handkerchief. No handkerchief could shield me from the\r\nScot’s irritating perversity. I had to confer with him, of course,\r\nor I couldn’t have worked at all. He was a very competent surgeon,\r\nparticularly skillful in eye surgery--a rare accomplishment in the\r\nSouth Pacific. As a health officer he had done some splendid work,\r\nespecially with yaws. But I had got off on the wrong foot when I\r\ndisagreed with him about pig hookworm. His great fault--if it be\r\na fault--was his firm conviction that he was a final authority on\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nOne of his assistants, a brilliant young fellow who suffered as long\r\nas he could endure it, then accepted a high post in Australia, gave\r\nme all the help he dared, and that was useful. But the Scot had an\r\nanti-Lambert complex. We were trying to install model latrines all\r\nover the Tongan Islands, and we had to choose a type that met with his\r\napproval. Nothing I offered was satisfactory, and it was impossible to\r\nfind out what he wanted. If I hadn’t finally resorted to a “Tongafiti”\r\ntrick I feel sure that nothing would have been accomplished. At last,\r\nin complete despair, I went to him with one of the plans he had\r\nrejected and said suavely, “Well, Doctor, I’ve finally come around\r\nto your original idea, and I’ll go with you on this plan.” Without a\r\nmurmur he accepted it. I had discovered a system.\r\n\r\nProbably Tonga was fortunate in having so good a man at the helm. For\r\nthe kingdom had been hospitable to some quacks, both clerical and\r\nmedical.\r\n\r\nA prominent trader was saying good-by to friends at the boat and\r\nremarking, “Glad you’re going while you have so good an impression\r\nof the women,” when a well-dressed stranger with a lady on his arm\r\nstrolled up and said, “No man is good enough for a good woman.” This\r\nknightly champion’s name doesn’t matter, except that it went on the\r\nTongan medical register with the string of initials “M.D., Phy. D.O.,\r\nM.S.R.U.I., S.A. and Harvard University D.O.” The S.A. might have\r\nmeant something, but his fantastic list of degrees remained as much a\r\nmystery as why the Tongan Government appointed him to a high medical\r\npost. Later on he admitted to me that he learned all his medicine as a\r\nhospital wardsman.\r\n\r\nHe was the only physician available when Queen Salote gave birth\r\nto the Crown Prince. His elegant bedside manner combined with his\r\nofficial prestige had elevated him beyond criticism. The accouchement\r\ntook place, according to tradition, in the royal suite; following\r\nold custom, the great nobles waited in an antechamber to hear the\r\nbirth proclaimed. Now and then the much-titled physician would pop\r\nin to take a look at his patient, then pop out to smoke a cigarette\r\nand shoot his cuffs. Finally a capable half-caste nurse, who had\r\nbeen constantly in attendance, poked her head out and announced that\r\nthe baby was coming. The titled one hurried to the bedside a minute\r\nlate; the child was already born. He stepped over to the nurse and\r\nwhispered confidentially, “And what shall I do next?” It was his first\r\nobstetrical case.\r\n\r\nWell, the nurse must have taken care of it, for when I was in Tonga the\r\nCrown Prince was a charming little boy. The obstetrical curiosity was\r\nnot dismissed; he served the kingdom for quite a while. When Fatafehi,\r\nfather of the late king, finally succumbed to his family’s hereditary\r\ndisease (old age) our hero was on something of a spot. He was told of\r\none royal funeral where the body lay so long awaiting the family’s\r\narrival that the pallbearers had had an unpleasant task in bearing away\r\nthe casket. It was decided to embalm the remains of Fatafehi--which\r\nstumped the poor fellow again. Finally he compromised by filling the\r\nlead coffin with formaldehyde solution. On the way to the grave the\r\npallbearers wondered why it was too heavy to manage. They had to bore\r\nholes in the side and let out the solution before they could lower the\r\ncoffin into the grave.\r\n\r\nAt last the good doctor was faced by a flu epidemic. He couldn’t handle\r\nit, so he went to Fiji for “medical supplies,” and never came back.\r\nI didn’t know much about him when he came around to me in Suva and\r\nimpressed me with his charming manner. I wanted a competent doctor\r\nto take my place while I was home on leave, and his fine talk almost\r\ndecided me to take him on. “All I want,” he said, “is a chance to treat\r\nthe natives. Just for my board and keep. I love the natives.” When I\r\nasked the Tongan Consul about him the answer didn’t quite satisfy me,\r\nso I changed my mind.\r\n\r\nHe went the way of all flash: a very minor sanitary inspector in Fiji;\r\nthen a job as little doctor on a little ship; then a move back to Tonga\r\nto settle down to beachcombing with a native wife. He could at least\r\nlay some claim to having brought a royal heir into the world. Even\r\nthough he hadn’t known what to do next.\r\n\r\nIf the Saga of Tropical Medicine has a comic section, some of the\r\nTongan M.D.’s legitimately graduated from the pick of the universities\r\ndeserve a place in it. One very able physician was a practical-joke\r\naddict. In his office was a skeleton, jointed and movable, with which\r\nhe scared natives by jerking the strings. At night he would rub\r\nphosphorus on his bony playmate and take him driving in his buggy; the\r\nghastly hell-light threw the town in a panic. When old Bridges was\r\nCollector of Customs the fun-loving doctor brought in a “drug order”\r\nwhich included a great many household furnishings. To dodge duty, he\r\ngave the furniture large Latin names: like _Carpetorum brusselorum_ and\r\n_Hattus rackus_. This got by the native inspector, to whom Latin was\r\nall Greek, but Collector Bridges stopped the racket.\r\n\r\nThey told me of another doctor who was anxious to become C.M.O. Over\r\nin Haapai he quarreled with Chief Israeli, who was a great swell in\r\nTonga and closely related to the King. Some minor skin disease took\r\nIsraeli to this doctor, who found his revenge in saying, “Man, you’ve\r\ngot leprosy!” He kept poor Israeli interned for six months outside the\r\nvillage and started a dicker with the Tongan Government. He craved\r\npromotion to Chief Medical Officer, he said, and if they handed him\r\nthat, Israeli would be pronounced cured. The doctor got what he wanted,\r\nand proclaimed that his treatment had saved the patient from a leper’s\r\ntragic end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I began hookworm treatments the royal family were the first to\r\ntake the medicine, as a good example to Tonga. For me that was a\r\ndelicate assignment. The household numbered forty in all, for Tongan\r\nhospitality kept the palace bulging with relatives and near-relatives.\r\nKeeping up the establishment must have been quite a drain, although\r\nSalote had a competent income and Prince Tungi was well-salaried as\r\nPremier; both had landed estates. But they were rich relations to two\r\nlarge families, and feudal tradition imposed on their generosity.\r\n\r\nFeudal tradition encountered modern medicine when it came to dosing the\r\nQueen. The tetrachloride had to be mixed in a special mug; for custom\r\ndemanded that no common mortal should eat or drink from any dish or\r\ncup that royalty had used. However, the Queen and Consort took their\r\nmedicine gracefully, and allowed themselves to be photographed taking\r\nit. An anxious populace waited outside the palace, and there was a\r\nmurmur of relief when it was announced that our medicine had taken its\r\nnormal course.\r\n\r\nAs a special favor I was given “back-door privileges” at the palace,\r\nand it was an honor I valued highly. Here on quiet mornings I would\r\nfind Salote sitting in loose, easy clothes, a relief from the\r\nBritish-made silks and satins of her state appearances. Our talks got\r\nme very close to her quick mind and her eager desire to learn what was\r\nbest for her people. Taufaahau, the heir apparent, and his two brothers\r\nwould be playing around the place. Sometimes I would see them riding\r\nthe giant turtle which has never left the palace grounds since Captain\r\nCook brought him from the Galapagos in 1773, a gift for the King of\r\nTonga. I always had chocolate bars or some other sweet for the children\r\nto nibble when they decided to sit on my knee. That was sixteen years\r\nago. The turtle is still alive and the Crown Prince has graduated with\r\nhonors from Sydney University. He is going to Oxford to study law and\r\nanthropology. Salote and Tungi have a right to be proud of this tall,\r\nsplendid young man. Lord, how time has slipped along....\r\n\r\nMany and many times I talked my plans over with Salote, and especially\r\nmy fixed idea that there must be a modernized Central Medical School in\r\nFiji. She was a constructive listener. She looked upon the people as\r\nher children, and was grieved by the tricks that had been played upon\r\nthem by alien races. Once I asked her if politics and religion weren’t\r\nthe same thing in Tonga, and she said: “Doctor, I think you’re about\r\nright.”\r\n\r\nA true Christian, she had an intense admiration for Queen Victoria.\r\nOnce a year, robed for the occasion, she would open Parliament, and be\r\nseated in the red chair of state, with her adored Tungi at her side.\r\nShe insisted on ceremonial black for the parliamentarians assembled,\r\nand before the great day there was a tremendous scrambling for European\r\nclothes. Once a small boy scampered into a trader’s store and demanded\r\na pair of silk stockings. He was a Queen’s page and had to put on full\r\nregalia.\r\n\r\nAncient suits were hired or borrowed for the occasion; dress suits,\r\ndinner jackets, antique cutaways and obsolete Prince Alberts, anything\r\nso long as it was black. Once I contributed my winter-weight dress\r\nclothes to an appealing noble and watched him join the long, sweaty\r\nline of lawgivers that filed in to the boiling ceremony. And the minute\r\nit was over ministers of state sneaked away crosslots, suffocating\r\ncoats over their arms, tight shoes in their hands. They were stealing\r\nhome to their comfortable and sensible _lavalavas_.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir George Richardson, Governor of Western Samoa, told\r\nme of his presentation at court when the Queen was very new to the\r\nthrone. Richardson, a crusty Britisher who had gone through the mill\r\nat the Court of St. James’s, may have exaggerated the incident. In\r\nthe presence of young Salote, he said, he had approached the throne,\r\nmade the proper bow and backed the prescribed distance. Out of the\r\nsilence the Queen clapped her hands: “Johnnie, bring the gentleman a\r\nwhisky-soda!” She hadn’t yet learned all the European formalities, but\r\nhospitality told her what a Britisher seldom refuses.\r\n\r\nSalote, with the pride of an ancient dynasty behind her and the\r\nproblems of a modern world facing her realm, was the connecting link\r\nbetween the old and the new.\r\n\r\nStrangers, dropping off at Nukualofa, have looked over the ancient\r\nstone relics there, have wondered at their monumental size and have\r\nheard, perhaps, smatterings of their legend. They have seen the great\r\nHaamonga (Burden on the Shoulders), a trilithon with side pieces\r\nfifteen feet high; one piece is twelve feet wide by four feet eight\r\ninches thick, the other is nine feet seven inches wide by three feet\r\neight inches thick. These are above-the-ground measurements, as they\r\nare set very deep. They stand ten feet apart and are grooved at the top\r\nto support a crosspiece that is fifteen feet long, five feet wide and\r\ntwenty-one inches thick. These stupid, literal measurements describe a\r\ncolossus, and nobody knows where the stones came from. Tradition says\r\nthat they were brought from Wallis Island in ancient Tongan canoes.\r\n\r\nThe great squared arch is the gateway to the old sacred _marai_ (family\r\nceremonial ground) where the Tui Tonga worshipped until the rise of\r\ntemporal power moved them to another _marai_, a few miles away. On the\r\nold _marai_ where the Burden on the Shoulders stands there is another\r\nrelic important to the lost religious history of Polynesia. This is\r\ncalled the Leaning Stone, and is a slablike pillar nine feet high, five\r\nwide, two thick.\r\n\r\nThe Tongans, you must remember, were fast losing their old religion\r\nwhen the white man came. They knew that the trilithon and the leaning\r\npillar were of sacred memory, but what they signified was not clear. It\r\nwas not until I visited the Cook Islands, where I saw similar relics\r\nand heard the young chiefs recite their poetic myths, that I realized\r\nwhat Tonga’s stone relics signified in the old paganism.\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere in Polynesia the symbols were the same. The arch\r\nrepresented Hina, goddess of fertility, and the leaning pillar was\r\nTangaloa her husband, god of life’s origin. After I found similar\r\npillars and arches on the Cook Islands I concluded that Tonga’s ancient\r\nworship must have been phallicism. I submitted my theory to Prince\r\nTungi and he consulted with keepers of the old tradition; they all\r\nagreed that this was probably the explanation. Tungi told me that\r\nthere were caves on Tongatabu which were called Hina because of their\r\narchlike shape, and that on Vavau there was a very realistic cleft\r\nstone, also called Hina.\r\n\r\nWhen I describe the Cook Islands I shall elaborate a little more on the\r\nHina (or Ina) and Tangaloa myth, for the Cook Islander still remembers.\r\n\r\nTonga’s third wonder is the Royal Tombs, the Langi. There are five\r\nLangi, generally pyramidal in shape, and covered with from three to\r\nfive layers of stone. They measure about two hundred feet on a side;\r\ntheir outer stones, some of them twenty feet long, are nicely squared\r\nand fitted. Each was built for a Tui Tonga.\r\n\r\nDuring one of our back-porch conferences Queen Salote told me that she\r\nhad recently allowed one of her relatives to be buried there, because\r\nhe was of the Tui Tonga line. The Queen was also of the same ancient\r\nfamily, so she was the only witness, except the Haatufunga, honorable\r\nburiers of the royal dead. The chamber into which the body was to be\r\nlowered was deep down in the center of the Langi. It was covered with\r\nan immense slab that had lain there four hundred years, and was raised\r\nwith great difficulty. They found a vault, about twelve feet long by\r\nfour wide and three deep, walled with artfully fitted stonework.\r\n\r\nI beg Her Majesty’s pardon if I misquote her, but this is what I\r\nremember her saying: “I saw the body go down into the dark vault. When\r\nit was first opened we found the skeletons of three men. One lay face\r\ndown, and must have belonged to a very powerful man. The other two\r\nwere more slender, and their bones showed that they died in a sitting\r\nposition.”\r\n\r\nThe seated skeletons were probably those of the Haatafunga, whose duty\r\nit was to prepare the bodies and wrap them in fine mats. In the old\r\ndays they were permitted to remove the costly cerements and take them\r\naway as perquisites of office--if they could work fast enough. They\r\nwere given just the time it took to poise the slab over the tomb, and\r\nlower it. The pair squatted on either side of the noble skeleton had\r\nbeen a minute too slow, and had been sealed in.\r\n\r\nLater Tonga grew more humane, and the funeral workers were not\r\npermitted to touch the mats; they were given safe exit before the lid\r\nfell. Certain valuable things, equivalent to the funerary spoils,\r\nwere set aside as their reward. The Queen told me that Joeli, lineal\r\ndescendant of the Tui Tonga, had opened a tomb a short time before and\r\nfound a beautifully carved ivory pillow. She had wanted to present it\r\nto the scientific world, but Joeli had re-interred it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Tongan people, always having lived under communism qualified by\r\nan aristocracy, still offered an example of socialized medicine in\r\ndaily practice. Sickness was treated free. If it was often not treated\r\nat all, that fact was partly due to the wide scatteration of little\r\nislands, and partly to the incapacity of an understaffed medical\r\ndepartment. Voyaging around the small, forgotten islands I groaned\r\nover dirt and flies and the ignorance of simple hygiene which spread\r\nyaws, dysentery and typhoid. General weakening from these diseases had\r\nmade the people easy prey to the influenza epidemic of 1918, which\r\nswept away eight per cent of the population. What they needed most was\r\nproper soil sanitation, proper water supplies, _and education in these\r\nnecessities_. So many deaths were unattended by a physician that it\r\nwas difficult to estimate the mortality figures covering typhoid, for\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nThe question of infant mortality--deaths of children under five--was\r\nto grow less crucial year by year. I have learned that by stimulating\r\none branch of public health the physician is apt to stimulate many\r\nothers. Our hookworm campaigns in Fiji, for example, worked toward the\r\nreduction of infant mortality; from 200 per 1,000 it fell below 100,\r\nand in one banner year was as low as 89.\r\n\r\nThe Tongans were a pithy breed with a will to live and an eagerness\r\nto learn--if you got around their ancient prejudices and the new\r\npeculiarities imparted by various mission sects. Proselytizing Mormons\r\nand Seventh Day Adventists had confused the issue. The Adventists had\r\nbeen popular when natives found that this faith gave them two workless\r\ndays a week. They were less ardent believers, however, when their\r\npreachers forbade smoking and the eating of pig. The Mormons were\r\nanti-tobacco, too. Visitors at the mission stations of either sect had\r\nto keep cigarettes and tobacco locked away from light-fingered converts.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wondered if civilization had done these people any good\r\nat all, except to shake off the abuses of the nobles. The ancient\r\ncommunism with nobody rich, nobody poor in a self-contained island\r\ngroup that fought away intruders--would that be the simple answer\r\ntoday? Over a hundred years ago Mariner thought so, when he asked\r\ngood Dr. Martin to write into his book: “Captain Cook brought the\r\nintermittent fever, the crooked backs and the scrofula.” (Probably\r\ntuberculosis.)\r\n\r\n And Vancouver brought the bloody flux, which in a few months killed a\r\n great number of them.... To any man of humanity, nothing can be more\r\n distressing than to cast his eye on the island of Otaheite, a spot\r\n blessed by nature with everything that can make life pleasing ... but\r\n now become a scene of general mortality, and a prey to disease, which\r\n to all human appearance, will in a few years render it a desolate\r\n wilderness.\r\n\r\nBut when you run a thumb over Mariner’s _Tonga Islands_ you are forced\r\nto believe that the old cures were sometimes super-Spartan, although\r\nthe savage doctors recognized tetanus long before the discovery of\r\nbacteria. Says Mariner:--\r\n\r\n In all cases of considerable wounds produced by pointed instruments\r\n the patient is not allowed to wash himself until he is tolerably well\r\n recovered, nor to shave, cut his hair, nor his nails; for all these\r\n things are supposed to produce _gita_ (tetanus).\r\n\r\nMariner reported that convalescents “happening to wash themselves too\r\nsoon, spasms supervened, and death was the consequence.” Observers\r\ntold him that “wounds in the extremities ... are liable to produce\r\ntetanus.... They never allow females to be near men thus wounded, lest\r\nthe mere stimulus of venereal desire should induce this dangerous\r\ncomplaint....” One man was “eight months without being washed, shaved\r\nor having his hair or nails cut....”\r\n\r\nNow for the old treatment of tetanus, an art they learned from Fiji,\r\nwhere warlike habits made _gita_ very common.\r\n\r\n ... consists in the operation of _tocolo’si_, or passing a reed first\r\n wetted with saliva into the urethra, so as to occasion a considerable\r\n irritation and loss of blood; and if the general spasm is violent,\r\n they make a seton of this passage, by passing down a double thread,\r\n looped over the end of the reed, and when it is felt in the perineum\r\n they cut down upon it, seize hold of the thread ... the thread is\r\n occasionally drawn backwards and forwards, which excites great pain,\r\n and an abundant discharge of blood....\r\n\r\nSeveral times Mariner saw this cruel operation; the jaws, he said, were\r\nviolently closed for a few seconds, but lockjaw never developed. The\r\nrecoveries, he thought, were about forty per cent. They also let blood\r\nin this way for ridiculous reasons, like wounds in the abdomen; but\r\nthey had a theory (rather in line with some of our advanced scientists)\r\nthat passing a reed into the urethra had a rejuvenating effect on the\r\ndebilitated. The King of Tonga, in Mariner’s time, had this operation\r\nperformed “and two or three days later he felt himself quite light, and\r\nfull of spirits.”\r\n\r\nThe operation called _boca_ was castration in cases of enlarged\r\ntesticles (probably elephantiasis). Tourniquets were skillfully made\r\nof native cloth and the instruments were razor-edges of split bamboo.\r\nDr. Martin wrote:--\r\n\r\n A profuse hemorrhage is mostly the consequence of this operation; it\r\n was performed seven times within the sphere of Mr. Mariner’s knowledge\r\n ... to three of which he was witness. Not one of the seven died....\r\n\r\nSounds gory enough, doesn’t it? But those native sorcerers, working\r\nwith tapa and banana-leaf bandages, cutting with split bamboo,\r\ndisplayed an art and a knowledge of surgery which had been cultivated\r\nthrough generations of experience. This wasn’t just voodoo. It was\r\napplied surgery, practised by men who needed only the touch of modern\r\nscience to equip them for the great work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn contradiction to what I have said about native deficiency in money\r\nsense, I found the Tongan developing into a keen trader in a small way.\r\nThe _Tongafiti_ game wasn’t lacking in his deals, and many European\r\ntraders were going bankrupt because the native was too sharp for\r\nthem. The old Tongan was a babe unborn when it came to expenditures,\r\nand there are stories of primitive natives playing pitch-game with\r\nshipwrecked trade dollars. Not so today.\r\n\r\nSalote and Tungi were studying finance methodically, patiently, to\r\nlearn modern economics. Up and down the beaches their subjects were\r\nsometimes sharpening their wits in a very practical way.\r\n\r\nTrader Algy Slocombe told me of the only times he ever got around a\r\nnative in a deal. Living next door, a Tongan family let a couple of\r\ntheir trees hang over his fence and interfere with his tennis. He\r\napproached the native wife, who talked to her husband, and there was a\r\nlong Tongan dicker. The husband admitted that he was grateful for the\r\nwater he got from the Slocombe well; so that was something to bargain\r\nwith. Algy said to the native’s wife, “If you’ll cut down those trees\r\nI’ll let you have all the coconuts that drop into your yard from the\r\npalms on my side.” The Tongans say, “_Fa moli moli_,” when they mean\r\n“Many thanks,” and there was a far-off look in the woman’s eyes when\r\nshe said it. For years she had been gathering those same nuts, and no\r\nquestions asked. But a trade was a trade.\r\n\r\nA native from Vavau came to Algy’s office proposing to deposit some\r\ntobacco against a loan of one pound. He said he was mayor of his\r\ntown, had a good plantation, dealt with Lever Brothers. Algy wanted a\r\nday before closing this big transaction; just for curiosity he wired\r\nVavau and found that this man had never had credit there. The customer\r\nreturned--without the tobacco, of course--and said he must have the\r\nmoney at once, as the boat was leaving for Vavau. Algy merely smiled,\r\n“_Fa moli moli_,” and his applicant departed without the slightest sign\r\nof ill-feeling. His five-dollar build-up had been as elaborate as that\r\nof the New York confidence man. But that was all right. He’d find a\r\ntouch somewhere before the boat left.\r\n\r\nNeither in Fiji nor Tonga did the natives have family names; though\r\nsome of the better-educated were beginning to affect the European way.\r\nI ran across a Tongan named Joni Motocawiah. If you say it fast it\r\nsounds like “Johnnie Motor Car Wire”--just what it means. The day Joni\r\nwas born his mother saw her first automobile, and a roll of barbed wire\r\nwas washed up on their beach. There was also a baby named Atalosa,\r\nwhich sounded sweet. Before the baby came her mother had sniffed\r\nsomething they told her was attar of roses; “Atalosa” was the way she\r\nsaid it.\r\n\r\nRemodeling the English language wasn’t confined to Tongans. Eloisa and\r\nI were quartered for a while at Bill Smith’s boarding house, where\r\nfood was delicious and flies abundant. Bill Smith was the reigning Mr.\r\nMalaprop. Once when he cornered me in a learned medical discussion he\r\nreferred to “A man’s tentacles and pinnace.” He knew more about the\r\ncookbook than the dictionary, and told me how to bake ham under a layer\r\nof mud so that it “brought out the intersticine juices.”\r\n\r\nA Tongan’s own language served him well if he didn’t happen to like\r\nyou. Needy aristocrats, beginning to learn the value of money and\r\nliquor, had perfected a little trick of giving a high title to visiting\r\nEuropeans and making them “members of the family.” If the European was\r\nromantic snob enough for the game, he freely lent money and whisky to\r\nthe noble donor of titles. When money and whisky played out the titles\r\nvanished also, and the once-honored one was unceremoniously removed\r\nfrom the family. This old army game was a bit of _Tongafiti_ that\r\nwas practised in Samoa as well as Tonga. The generous Polynesian was\r\nbeginning to learn that you don’t give something for nothing in this\r\nwicked world. Chief Ulukalala, a pretender to the throne, had titles\r\nto give that sounded extremely noble. He gave one to an official, and\r\nanother to a resident doctor’s wife. Between the two honored ones there\r\nwas contention as to which should rank the other at native ceremonies.\r\nHer title was _To’e Umu_, literally “Scraps from the Oven.” His was\r\n_Kuli Haapai_, which in English is “Dog of Haapai.”\r\n\r\nThe relics of early missionary blue laws made it very easy to go to\r\njail. It was forbidden to do any sort of work on Sunday, even on your\r\nown premises. When I was there Dr. Ruhen, a medical officer, was\r\narrested for breaking the Sabbath by picking a bunch of bananas in his\r\nown yard. Despite his protest that he was only gathering food, he was\r\nduly fined. Sunday games were prohibited. Algy Slocombe’s tennis court\r\ngot him into trouble with the puritans. We had some splendid Sunday\r\ngames there, and Algy felt secure because his court was screened by a\r\nhedge. Some holy peeper caught him finally, and all his players were\r\nhaled before a native magistrate and fined. Fortunately that happened\r\nafter I went home.\r\n\r\nAll crimes lead to jail, or are supposed to. Going to jail in Tonga\r\nseemed to be quite a merry social affair. Back in the days of old\r\nGeorge Tubou one of the royal relatives was a prisoner. Every afternoon\r\nthe King’s carriage would wheel up, take the culprit for a drive and\r\nfor tea in the Palace, then return him at six o’clock, the closing hour.\r\n\r\nA friend told me that when he first saw the Vavau jail there was a\r\nsign over the door “All prisoners not in by six o’clock will be locked\r\nout for the night.” When I was there the jailers complained bitterly\r\nbecause there were no prisoners, and they had to do all the work.\r\nTongan prisoners were great gadabouts. In one village there had been\r\nseveral burglaries of provision stores, and the police were baffled\r\nfor days. At last they located the loot, hidden under the jail where\r\nthe inmates could delve in, when they pleased, for a midnight snack.\r\nIt seemed rather remarkable that such good boarding houses were losing\r\nboarders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was Tonga as I saw it, going in and out for many years. Like all\r\nPacific groups, it was a land of marked contrasts. At sunset an old\r\nwitch woman would stand on the cliffs “calling the sharks.” She would\r\nthrow scraps into the water, then raise a high, queer chant and the\r\nbeasts would poke their noses through the surf. And in the palace at\r\nNukualofa an educated, civilized woman sat with her consort, planning\r\nto meet the conditions which a new world had imposed on her kingdom.\r\nBecause their rule was good, and the British Protectorate a wise one,\r\nTonga continued to improve greatly, both in health and in understanding.\r\n\r\nI never let Salote and Tungi forget that the native medical talent\r\nwas right there in the kingdom, waiting to be developed. Every time\r\nI visited her islands I told the Queen how the pick of her young\r\nmen could go to Fiji for a first-class medical education, if we had\r\nthe money to back such an enterprise. There was always that big If.\r\nSalote’s common sense and patriotism told her that I was right. Her\r\ngenerous wish was not limited to her own realm; she saw how the native\r\nraces of Oceania could not be helped until they learned to help\r\nthemselves. But when I talked this problem over with her I realized\r\nthat little Tonga was not rich enough to effect a program that would\r\ncover the whole wide Pacific.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne day in 1926 I was very discouraged when I came to Queen Salote with\r\nmy troubles. I told her of a letter I had just received from Heiser; he\r\nhad decided that I must abandon the School idea altogether. It was no\r\nfault of his, he had done what he could. But the case was hopeless.\r\n\r\nQueen Salote listened carefully to what I had to say. In her thoughtful\r\nhesitation I saw that she was agreeing with Heiser. I had put up a\r\nfour-year fight for an impractical ideal.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly she raised her kind eyes and asked, “Doctor, is it such a\r\ntremendous amount that we can’t bear our share?”\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t a spendthrift Tongan speaking. It was the voice of a woman\r\nwho had considered the question carefully, and had come to see the\r\nroad to a sick kingdom’s recovery. She knew that there was a competent\r\ntreasury balance. She had been with us from the first. Her influence\r\nhad helped reduce Tongan infant mortality until it had become the\r\nlowest in the Pacific; she had encouraged mothers to come to doctors or\r\ngovernment dispensers for supplies of baby food; this had given medical\r\nofficers a chance to check up on the condition of young children.\r\nSalote had encouraged war on tuberculosis, and had seen that every\r\nhouse in her realm should have sanitary arrangements, even if they\r\nwere still crude. The medical men she backed with moral support were\r\ncleaning up yaws with arsenicals. No one more than Salote knew the\r\nhealth situation in Tonga.\r\n\r\nAnd couldn’t Tonga bear its share in our School, so that the Pacific\r\nwould at least have competent native medical service? Before she had\r\nspoken, my School had been taking its last gasp. Now it was alive again.\r\n\r\nI went to Samoa and quoted her offer to the old Governor, Major-General\r\nSir George Richardson. “Well,” he grunted, “if Tonga is willing to do\r\nthat we’ll come in too.”\r\n\r\nThe fight wasn’t over, even then, but the wall was breached.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I left Tonga for the last time the Crown Prince Taufaahau was\r\non the ship with us. He had come home to the celebration of his\r\ntwenty-first birthday and had been given the high title of Tubou Toa.\r\nHe was a splendid boy, one I would have been proud to have claimed\r\nas my son. Two young anthropology professors from the University of\r\nChicago were with us and were charmed with his conversation, always\r\non an intellectual footing with theirs. Gigantic as his ancestors, he\r\nkept fit by exercising with fifty-six-pound dumbbells. He laughed,\r\nremembering the chocolate bars I used to feed him. I was telling him\r\nabout a chief of a lost Pacific island who had asked me to come back\r\nand be his guest for life; the Crown Prince fell into a long study, the\r\nway his mother did when she was deciding something for herself. Then he\r\nsaid, “Doctor, I invite you to make your home with me in Tonga. But of\r\ncourse,” he said, “that will be after I have assumed my place in Tongan\r\nsociety.”\r\n\r\nI know of no happier place for my old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE LAND OF THE TALKING MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nI only stretch the long-bow lightly when I say that Western Samoa’s\r\npolitical troubles began with a small medical problem and ended with a\r\ngreat one. Certainly the finish of the Mau Rebellion was a picture of\r\nhatred’s reaction upon public health.\r\n\r\nThe _malanga_ of 1924 was in full swing, and I was one of the party.\r\nFrom days of old the _malanga_ has been a royal progress, an annual\r\nwindow-dressing on the march, as it was in England when a grateful\r\npopulace turned out to greet Henry VIII with polished hauberks and\r\nfreshly dry-cleaned plumes. In Samoa’s year of plenty, 1924, the\r\n_malanga_ was still an impressive show. His Britannic Majesty’s\r\nproconsul, Governor of New Zealand’s ten-year-old Mandate, had\r\nfull-costumed a military display and was accepting the feasts or\r\nlistening to the bands and musical orators all around Savaii.\r\n\r\nSince Samoa’s dawn of time the _Tulafale_ (the orator or “talking man”)\r\nhad commanded leadership. No funeral, wedding or political controversy\r\nin the _Fono_ (meeting place) has been official without a competition\r\nof orators, first on one side, then on the other, showering palaver\r\nor threats neatly wrapped in compliments. In the years of the Mandate\r\nthe Talking Men were still importantly featured, and that wolf-gray,\r\nbullet-headed old British soldier, Major-General Sir George S.\r\nRichardson, had made many stops along his two weeks’ march, to examine\r\nthe well-being of a people he governed all too kindly.\r\n\r\nUnder this _malanga’s_ careless pageantry I witnessed a small pregnant\r\nincident. It dropped another of the seeds which, in a few years,\r\nsprouted into the wicked flower of an insurrection already germinating.\r\nIn my report to the Foundation I described this official tour as\r\n“unique in my experience and remarkable for its results in obtaining\r\nthe confidence of the native and his co-operation in measures for his\r\nown benefit. In the party there was the Governor, the Commissioner for\r\nNative Affairs, the Resident Commissioner of Savaii, the Chief Medical\r\nOfficer, the Collector of Customs and Taxes, the Governor’s A.D.C.,\r\nDr. Buxton and myself.” Fau’mui’na, high chief, led thirty Boy Scouts\r\ncalled “_Fetu o Samoa_,” the Star of Samoa; there were native police,\r\ncarriers and attendants. The Fetu went in front, beating a drum, behind\r\nthem was the flagbearer, next the Governor with his retinue, then the\r\nendless queue of followers. It was a parade to touch the imagination of\r\na people susceptible to pomp and ceremony.\r\n\r\nIn the village reception house there would be the usual kava ceremony,\r\nthe food presentation, the long hour devoted to exchange of courtesies.\r\nThen the _Tulafale_, the professional orators, would unlimber their\r\neloquence for the benefit of the Governor: “We in our ignorance and\r\nhumility turn to you for the light of your wisdom, as the flower turns\r\nto the sun. We are the children, you are the father upon whom we depend\r\nfor guidance. We know that you love us, and we return your love....”\r\nWhen you hear this doled out day after day you begin to believe the\r\nOrator. The simple Samoan child of nature--and watch out or he’ll have\r\nthe shirt off your back. Witness how his shrewd diplomacy all but had\r\nthe United States, Germany and Britain tearing at each other’s throats\r\nin 1900. When Germany got her cut in the colony the Samoan’s connivance\r\nworried her to a point where she only tried to control them with\r\npunitive raids....\r\n\r\nBut in the Governor’s _malanga_ of 1924 the Orators were laying it on\r\nthick. They would look into every gift-basket, call out the donor’s\r\nname with praise if the taro were big and the fish well-cooked. If the\r\ncontribution looked stingy they would be very frank about it, amidst\r\npopular mirth.\r\n\r\nPublic health was never relaxed in this bright journey of inspection.\r\nThe Boy-Scoutish Fetu, wearing nothing but the _lavalava_ and a\r\ncap with the emblem Star, would give the people exhibition games,\r\nobject lessons in simple sports that would keep the villagers away\r\nfrom picture shows and dissipations in Apia. The Administration was\r\nsensible in showing the all but naked bodies of the young Fetu, to\r\nillustrate the health advantages of light clothing in the tropics. The\r\nAdministration was always rational and kind.\r\n\r\nAt one of the settlements the orations and ceremonies had been\r\nunusually long. As in every place we stopped, the doctors had lined\r\nup the population for quick inspection of ulcers, skin lesions, eye\r\nconditions, enlarged spleens, or any other sign of disease. Our time\r\nwas more than up, we had to be pushing on. What happened then was\r\ncertainly no fault of Dr. Ritchie, a Medical Officer whose patient\r\nand enlightened work in restoring a failing race had earned him a\r\ncrown in Heaven, twice over. It was a fault of tact, reacting on that\r\ninteresting intangible, the Samoan temperament.\r\n\r\nWe had been there long enough for the natives to report any sickness\r\nin the region. Now we were hurrying to board the launch. What happened\r\nthen was characteristic of Samoan dilly-dally. Several natives came\r\nrunning up with the cry: “There’s a woman who has been having a baby\r\nfor five days! It’s half in, half out!” (They were describing, I\r\nsuppose, a “hand presentation.”) All Savaii had known that we were\r\nthere, but it had just occurred to them to call a doctor. Dr. Ritchie,\r\non the march, had no instruments with him, and experience told him\r\nthat the woman was as good as dead. To examine her would mean an\r\nout-of-the-way trip, and Governor Richardson was impatient for the\r\npompous _malanga_ to move on. So it moved.\r\n\r\nEven then I felt the seriousness of that diplomatic blunder. Here was\r\na chance for the Administration, out for show, to make a beautiful\r\ngesture. Of course there was no hope for the woman, but it would have\r\nmade an immense impression of kindness if the party had turned their\r\nlaunch around and wasted a day with the dying mother. It would have had\r\nthe dramatic effect they wanted.\r\n\r\nBut the mistake was made among a people who were nursing many\r\ngrievances, most of them imaginary. When the calamitous Mau Rebellion\r\nbroke in 1927 that incident was remembered. Years later, after the\r\nmessy thing had subsided, one of the Mau leaders, Fau’mui’na--since\r\npromoted to a good government post--told me that official neglect of\r\nthe woman did much toward fomenting revolt. That and the shooting of\r\nTamasese, exiled as a nuisance and a royal pretender....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo war-captured country ever had a better government than these islands\r\nenjoyed after New Zealand’s soldiery took over in 1914 a group which\r\nthe League of Nations later changed from German Samoa to the mandate of\r\nWestern Samoa. It was in refreshing contrast to Australia’s early rule\r\nin New Guinea. Even before the uniformed Anzacs had left Samoa there\r\nwas a clear-headed scientific attempt to look into social and health\r\nconditions. New Zealand, with her high cultural standards, had long\r\nstudied the splendid race of Maoris, whom she had governed well. At\r\nhome a million-and-a-half New Zealanders lived alongside 70,000 Maoris\r\nwhose population had increased and whose rights had been maintained\r\nunder a benevolent rule. Yes, Western Samoa was fortunate in her new\r\ngovernment which had never shown a selfish financial motive behind any\r\nof its acts. But the Mau Rebellion came, and its “cruel oppressions”\r\nhave been so sensationalized by newspaper propagandists that the\r\naverage reader asks: How did the administrators come to grow hoofs and\r\nhorns overnight? Well, they didn’t.\r\n\r\nIn 1923 Dr. T. Russell Ritchie came in as Chief Medical Officer and\r\nhis four years there were as remarkable for scientific achievement\r\nas anything accomplished by Gorgas in cleaning up Cuba and Panama.\r\nIn civil administration you’ll find mistakes everywhere this side of\r\nHeaven. But even the mistakes were motivated by a fiery zeal to show\r\nthe world New Zealand’s disinterestedness. Education and public health\r\nwere the features in a program so thorough that it should not be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nIt was a demonstration of preventive medicine unexcelled in the\r\ntropics. By 1926 a death rate of over thirty per thousand was reduced\r\nto twenty in four Samoan districts. Yaws was practically eliminated,\r\ninfant welfare work had brought down the average mortality under five\r\nyears to the lowest in the Pacific--before Tonga worked out that\r\nproblem. Soil sanitation had become the rule instead of the exception;\r\nin 1921 New Zealand had sent a commission to Australia to study the\r\nFoundation’s hookworm campaigns there; Ritchie had adapted it to\r\nWestern Samoa with marvelous results. He was bringing in pure piped\r\nwater; on islands like Savaii, which is very rainy but so lava-porous\r\nthat it has no streams, he had overridden Polynesia’s superstition\r\nand used church roofs as watersheds for storage tanks. New Zealand’s\r\nsuccessful medical work was becoming a model for other island groups.\r\nThere could not have been a better one. Germany’s last census in\r\n1911 showed a population of 33,476. In 1917, after three years in\r\npossession, New Zealanders counted 37,196. In 1918 pandemic influenza,\r\na scourge that baffled world medicine, mowed the natives down. But the\r\nMandate’s care brought them back so steadily that in 1933--despite the\r\nhellish work of the Mau Rebellion--our yaws campaign workers counted\r\n48,300. This last estimate, I think, was about 1,500 short of the\r\nactual number. Confused conditions, following years of revolt, made\r\nthe count extremely difficult. In 1936 the census showed 55,000.\r\n\r\nFrom 1921 to 1931, half of those years consumed by the Mau’s hateful\r\ndestruction, New Zealand had given to Samoa between £12,500 and £14,000\r\nannually for medical purposes alone. None of this was in the form of\r\na loan; it was free as a birthday present. Add to this New Zealand’s\r\ngifts of public works,--like the native piped water supplies, for\r\ninstance,--and you have a total of some £250,000 devoted to Western\r\nSamoa with no expectation of any return but the moral satisfaction of\r\nseeing a race revived.\r\n\r\nThen what was the matter with Samoa that she wanted to rebel?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSamoa has been plowed over so often by romance-hawkers, big and little,\r\nthat it would hardly be worth my time or yours to try to revisualize\r\nthe moonlight and song, the deep-grooved valleys, the lacy waterfalls\r\ninfested by golden girls with tumbled raven hair. On my frequent\r\nprofessional visits I saw their unromantic side, yet always admired\r\na people who refused to be coaxed or slave-driven into the sort of\r\nwork which, to them, seemed unnecessary. Don’t dismiss the Samoan as\r\na happy good-for-nothing. On sterile Savaii I have seen them carrying\r\nfarm produce on their backs, mile after mile; it was the old way, and\r\nthey were working their own land. If Samoan racial pride seems to you\r\nto be no more than backwoods vanity, remember the Polynesian brain,\r\none of humanity’s best. And remember that in both Samoas, Western and\r\nAmerican, there are as many people, perhaps, as you’ll find in one of\r\nNew York’s longer streets. The old days are done for; the days of brave\r\ncanoe-voyaging over uncharted blue waters. Among their ancestors were\r\nbaffled Alexanders, weeping for more worlds to conquer. The worlds they\r\nfound were so small, so scattered....\r\n\r\nThey have settled down to a small-town complex. For hours on end they\r\nsit around the kava circle, talking, talking. We are outnumbered,\r\nthey say, but we are still Samoans. The New Faith is well enough. We\r\nmust still observe our ancient ceremonies, our rules of courtesy, our\r\ncarefully graded social distinctions, and every complication of our\r\npolitical structure. Listen to that old chief over there. He can recite\r\nhis ancestry for thirty or more generations back. He is an aristocrat,\r\nand his memory is long, they say. All our memories are long.\r\n\r\nThis is not all poppycock. The Samoan is a born gentleman. Although\r\nbooks have been a stranger to him since the dawn of history, he is\r\nreading now. He is a nationalist and his reasoning mind has told him\r\nthat his nationalism will have international support. Inwardly he\r\nbelieves that he is smarter than a European, and he wants a Samoa that\r\nis governed by Samoans. He looks across toward the Kingdom of Tonga and\r\nasks, “If they govern themselves, why can’t we? Tongans don’t work for\r\nEuropeans. They hire them.”\r\n\r\nAll such ideas are splendid, if impractical and slightly ridiculous.\r\nThey had much to do with the disastrous Mau.\r\n\r\nThe good Samoan mind is still factional. When the Dutch explorers first\r\nsaw Apia they found a people who lacked the solidarity that welded\r\nTonga. Each of Samoa’s three main islands had its own complicated\r\naristocracy and tribal intrigue. It was Japan without a Mikado. You\r\nwould have thought that the descendants of voyaging warriors would have\r\ndeveloped the leadership that pulls a country together. Perhaps the\r\nSamoans were too innately civilized to crave a Hitler and a generation\r\nof massacres. It was the European’s job to drag them out of the Stone\r\nAge into the Bomb Age--all in a century and a half. By 1900 they could\r\nuse rifles well, as witness the small butchery of Marines that led to\r\nthe partition of the two Samoas between Germany and the United States.\r\n\r\nCloying praise has shared in spoiling the native Samoan. Robert Louis\r\nStevenson was the worst sinner. It was too easy to sentimentalize\r\ntheir sweet and gentle women, their courteous patriarchal chiefs, the\r\nwaterfalls that sang like fountains day and night. Before Hollywood\r\nwent South Sea and flattered them with the camera, Stevenson had told\r\nus in charming, balanced sentences how he had lived among Greeks in\r\nEden’s Vale. Samoan conceit became elephantoid under this pretty\r\ncoddling, and the abundant orators around the kava ring told them\r\nagain that they occupied the Navel of the World. It was never raucous\r\nboasting. As I have said, the Samoans are a race of gentlefolk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe medical problem in Western Samoa was more than a matter of lining\r\nthem up, treating them, sending them home. In American Samoa, our Navy\r\ntried the efficiency method, but it didn’t work very well with a people\r\nwho live on ceremony as much as Japan did under the Shogunate. A sick\r\nSamoan, if he has rank, pays for his operation a thousandfold before he\r\nis home and recovered.\r\n\r\nThe Samoan social system could ramify its way across a hundred library\r\nshelves. To be brief, its core is the _Matai_, or master. This title\r\ngoes to the head of the _Ainga_, or family, and is handed down like an\r\nheirloom. The title _Tufunga_ is high, and carries with it the greatest\r\ndignity, and the honors that go with it have always been recognized.\r\n\r\nTo the practical modern doctor the old ceremonial is what can’t be\r\ncured and must be endured. Take the ceremonial journey they call the\r\n_malanga_--if a Samoan goes visiting relatives and takes the whole\r\nvillage along, it becomes a _malanga_, and the visitors are apt to eat\r\nthe host’s provisions down to the last taro, while he bites his nails\r\nin secret and publicly implores his guests to stay longer. But this\r\ngenerosity has a true Christmas spirit--you give something and expect\r\nsomething back. Pretty soon the host will be on a _malanga_ of his\r\nown--then it will be his turn to do the feasting, and yours to pay for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTreating a sick Samoan is an ordeal for the doctor and it is not always\r\nso easy on the patient. N.M.P. Ielu Kuresa, an honored graduate of our\r\nSchool, wrote an article for our medical journal, the _Native Medical\r\nPractitioner_, in which he described the rigmarole which surrounds a\r\nsimple surgical operation. This is his account, in brief:--\r\n\r\n“To be operated on by a doctor does not mean the doctor’s bill only.\r\nCustom and etiquette must be complied with. In the first place,\r\nthe scene will be at the patient’s own home.... Having come to the\r\nconclusion that he must be operated on, he will first inform his\r\nimmediate family of his intentions. At this stage a daughter or son,\r\nperhaps residing some distance away, will have to be sent for in order\r\nto participate in a family meeting to decide whether the sick person’s\r\nwishes should be carried out, or whether a further try of other\r\nnative medicine or treatment be applied.” Every Matai, under these\r\ncircumstances, must make peace with his kinsmen; otherwise “it means\r\ncarrying with you bad luck and perhaps better chances of dying. Samoans\r\nare very particular about their selection of physicians and will travel\r\nmiles to get to a good surgeon, leaving another doctor who might be\r\nclose to their village.”\r\n\r\nAll the related Matais are informed of the coming event. Then the\r\nOrators are brought into play. They assemble at the sick man’s house,\r\nand there is a contest of eloquence, wishing the patient “all good\r\nluck and God’s never-failing help....” So the Orators must get their\r\npork and the sympathizers must feast--“... food in such a quantity as\r\nbefits the title of the sick person ... a whole roasted pig, or even\r\ntwo, bread or biscuits and of course taro by the score ... the first\r\ninstallment on operating expenses.” Any other stricken member of the\r\n_Ainga_, a wife or child, gets the same ceremony, scaled down to the\r\nsocial importance of the sufferer.\r\n\r\n“The first expense, then, can be from £1 to £5, to be conservative.”\r\nIf the Matai happens to be hard up he must borrow pigs from his\r\nin-laws. “At times, just to conform with Samoan customs, if no pigs are\r\nforthcoming from the son-in-law or the daughter-in-law, or the sister,\r\nthe _Ainga_ must resort to parting with a share of the family lands, or\r\nsome other form of property.”\r\n\r\nThis blow-off ends the first scene. A boat is probably necessary\r\nto carry the patient to the hospital. The crew offers its services\r\nfree--But wait. The expedition is called _ole si’ingama’i_,\r\n“party-carrying-the-sick.” The boating expedition swells to a\r\nheavy-laden fleet. And don’t forget the _Tulafale_, the all-pervading\r\nOrators, bringing their wives and children and in-laws.\r\n\r\nEtiquette demands that there shall be a stop or two on the way.\r\nEtiquette also demands that leading families provide a splendid\r\nbarbecue. Samoan hospitality, carefully gauged by the family code,\r\nholds the patient long enough to get well--or else. The visitors know\r\nthat it is their ancient right to demand food, and that their hosts\r\nwill be their guests someday and there’ll be another big picnic. The\r\nvisitors make gifts, too; usually fine mats and tapa cloths. These\r\ngifts are a part of the prevalent gentleman’s code.\r\n\r\nThe patient gets to the hospital--alive, let’s say.\r\n“Parties-carrying-the-sick” are not allowed in wards, so they are\r\nsettled in a base-camp in a near-by village, as guests of the _Ainga_\r\nthere. The visitors contribute more pigs, and mats which cost from one\r\npound up, according to historic value. These expenses, Ielu writes,\r\n“will no doubt appear absurd to the European mind.... It may all be in\r\nthe course of life, according to the Samoan way of living, yet a pig is\r\na pig and a fine mat is a fine mat.”\r\n\r\nThen comes the operation. The native pastor and an Orator have been\r\nat the patient’s bedside. The parson and the _Tulafale_ have said\r\ntheir prayer, made their speeches. Back in the camp there is wholesale\r\ncooking. The occasion demands ... “something to mark the occurrence.\r\nThe presentation will be done publicly and the food announced aloud\r\nwherever it is being presented. The announcing is usually done when\r\nthe patient has been brought back to the ward after the operation.”\r\n\r\nThe sick man, if he got well, was in for such an entertainment bill\r\nas never faced Lucullus. If he died the funeral would be on the same\r\nlavish scale and his family would have to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIelu tells of operating on I’inga, an aristocrat. Ielu was a brilliant\r\nsurgeon, and the patient’s elephantoid scrotum was such a simple matter\r\nthat he let him walk a short distance to the hospital. That should have\r\ncut the cost. He didn’t need boats or a base camp or a lusty entourage.\r\nHowever, this proud I’inga was compelled by custom to make a large food\r\npresentation every day of his illness; daily 100 loaves of bread with\r\nsugar and butter and two whole roast pigs went down to his account. His\r\ntitle of Matai was a high one, therefore he had to pay in fine mats for\r\nthe daily _sua_ (pig) presentations. The party cost him five pounds in\r\nbread, and pigs were worth about seven pounds apiece. The whole job set\r\nhim back forty-four pounds, thirteen shillings.\r\n\r\nSurgical and hospital fees came to four pounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne night in 1924 I was dining at Vailima with Governor Richardson,\r\nwho lived in the romantic house which Robert Louis Stevenson used to\r\noccupy. Above it loomed the steep hill which is topped by Stevenson’s\r\ntomb. So many tourist-ladies have climbed the mud-slippery trail to\r\nvisit this shrine that I blush to mention it.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sir George had risen to high office by force of sheer ability.\r\nWar had advanced him from the rank of drill sergeant to general\r\ncommand. A born Englishman, he had immediately won New Zealand’s\r\nrespect for his Mandate administration. You had to admire him. He had\r\nthe middle-class Englishman’s anti-Yankee prejudices; a brush with\r\nour United States Navy control in American Samoa hadn’t helped. Don’t\r\nthink that he was any martinet when it came to native administration.\r\nDevotedly, honestly he wished to be the father of his flock. But he\r\nseemed rather too self-satisfied. Touchy Samoa politely resented\r\nhis attitude, “See what we are doing for you. Come to us if there’s\r\nanything you want done.” I longed to tell him that he was doing too\r\nmuch for the Samoan, feeding him with modernism faster than he could\r\ndigest it. But you didn’t tell things to Governor Richardson. He told\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nAt that meeting, as at many others, we had discussed the need of a\r\nmodern native medical school in Fiji, and as usual Richardson had been\r\nfavorable to the plan. The expenses of governing a country that had\r\n3,000 chiefs to 40,000 population was the only thing that held him back\r\nuntil Queen Salote’s generous offer in 1926, when he pledged Samoa to\r\nshare in a scheme in which he had always heartily believed. During\r\nthat long evening’s talk in 1924 I didn’t mention the woman on Savaii\r\nwho died in childbirth. But if a competent Native Medical Practitioner\r\nhad been on the spot that day the story of Richardson’s administration\r\nmight have had a happier ending. I think he had a right to feel proud\r\nof the medical situation, for the Mandate was already training native\r\nnurses in the model hospitals, was using one of our old-school Native\r\nMedical Practitioners, and had socialized medicine to a point where\r\nevery Samoan paid a head-tax of about five dollars a year for all\r\ntreatments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYears of administering that model colony bred a certain smugness in\r\nthe good Governor Richardson; and smugness is always dangerous in\r\nhandling native affairs. Early in 1927 he went to the New Hebrides on\r\na Royal Commission with Governor Sir Eyre Hutson of Fiji. Richardson\r\nwas on the crest of the wave, feeling his oats in every pore. When\r\nthe party got back to Fiji I wanted to return his Samoan hospitality,\r\nbut Richardson’s mind harbored a single thought: go up to Government\r\nHouse again and tell Sir Eyre how to run Fiji. Hutson was one of the\r\nsmoothest products of the colonial school, and he had learned enough\r\nabout the treatment of native races to have made Fiji a model for\r\nall students of island administration. However, Richardson got to\r\nGovernment House and told Hutson; and Hutson smiled rosily, suavely\r\nagreeing that he ought to study Samoa and get some tips on how to run\r\nFiji.\r\n\r\nWhen Richardson finished telling Hutson and returned to Apia, the Mau\r\nRebellion broke right in his face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a doctor I cannot diagnose Samoa’s illness without looking further\r\ninto the causes that led up to it. The status of the half-caste in\r\nPolynesia was at the root of the disturbance. While in dark-skinned\r\nMelanesia a touch of white is often a stigma, it is a matter of pride\r\nto the peach-tan Maoris, Cook Islanders and Samoans. The European may\r\nturn his shoulder on the half-caste, but the Polynesian forgets his\r\ninsular pride in an eager mating with Europeans; every child with a\r\ntrace of Northern blood is looked upon as something which approaches\r\nthe racial ideal. The Samoan highly respects the child of a mixed\r\nunion--provided the native mother has not been deserted by her husband\r\nor mate. There is the case of one distinguished British scientist\r\nwho experimented with going native, chose a Samoan woman, wore a\r\n_lavalava_ around his belly and a hibiscus flower over his ear. Called\r\nback to London to account for himself, he left the girl where he found\r\nher--and the baby. It was no disgrace that she had to do washing;\r\nneedy aristocrats often do that. Nor was she ashamed that she couldn’t\r\nshow a marriage license. She hung her head because Johnson (I’ll call\r\nhim) had deserted her, and before the baby was born. Johnson wandered\r\nto Chicago, where he died; but his beach-widow carefully guards her\r\nbeautiful son for fear that some of his father’s relatives may come\r\nalong and claim him.\r\n\r\nI heard two half-caste boys quarreling. One howled, “Jonisoni!” and\r\nthe other yelled, “Anisoni!” They were not accusing one another of\r\nbastardy, but raising the accusation that their mothers had been\r\ndeserted by Johnson and Anderson.\r\n\r\nWhen Germany ruled Samoa every man whose father was registered as a\r\nEuropean could himself register as a European. Some so classified were\r\nless than one thirty-second white, and many of them could not speak\r\na word of English. When New Zealand took over she had to accept the\r\nMade-in-Germany rule. The mental and moral worth of these mixed bloods\r\ndepended, of course, on the quality of their parents. The product\r\nvaries; but the more I travel the more I see the brilliant results when\r\ntwo superior beings of opposing races are bred together. After a while\r\nI’m going to tell about a few New Zealanders who are legally classed as\r\nMaoris.\r\n\r\nThe fuse that led up to the Mau explosion carried one very dangerous\r\ncombustible--half-caste jealousy of European social prestige. The\r\njealousy was mutual, I think, for the European wife grew watchful of\r\nthe lovely half-caste girl with her soft, long-lashed eyes and velvet\r\nskin. This girl was getting an education and her parents were grumbling\r\nbecause she could not step into the social sphere which her mind, her\r\nmanners and her beauty demanded, in all fairness.\r\n\r\nInsurgency centered in O. F. Nelson, a half-caste who possessed genius\r\nboth for business and for political leadership. The chain of Nelson\r\ntrading stores had bulked him about $1,500,000, an unthinkable fortune\r\nto be gathered out of Samoa. Like Nelson, the discontented half-castes\r\nhad educated their daughters in colleges and upper schools, yet had\r\ngained no status for them in European society. The full-blooded Samoan\r\nlooked up to Nelson, one derived from their own race and so powerful\r\nthat the Government had to come to him for favors. When he rode out in\r\nhis handsome car he displayed a coat of arms as large and gaudy as the\r\nGovernor’s own, and his A.D.C. was in uniform. The native majority was\r\nunder his control.\r\n\r\n_Mau_ means “Stand Fast,” and the stand was against real and fancied\r\nwrongs. Trouble brewed when Western Samoan traders howled because\r\nAmerican Samoa was outbuying them in the copra market. The quarrel\r\nbecame a crazy patchwork, with Richardson trying to patch the patches.\r\nHalf-castes were clamoring to be counted as Europeans, even though\r\nthe change would have endangered their rights. Then Prohibition, that\r\nindomitable mischief-maker, raised its old silk hat. Because the\r\nCustoms House, through an error, got more than its share of liquor on\r\none consignment, the League of Nations, which controlled the Mandate’s\r\nthirst, ordained that Western Samoa’s Europeans should have liquor\r\nfor medical purposes only. Up to then strong drink had been wisely\r\nforbidden the natives. Under Prohibition, indignant Europeans taught\r\nSamoans to make a vile intoxicant called “bush beer,” and to help\r\nthemselves to a share of it. All this added native drunkenness to the\r\npattern of revolt.\r\n\r\nThe Orators were putting their heads together. At every _Fono_ the\r\nTalking Men intoned “Samoa for the Samoans” and suavely asked the\r\naristocrats, “How can nobles and chiefs serve under this common fellow\r\nRichardson?” The mess, which largely interests me from a medical\r\npoint of view, harked back again to the Governor’s _Malanga_, which I\r\ndescribed at the opening of this chapter; it included two officials\r\nwho were later accused of corrupting Samoan youths. A schoolteacher\r\nwho showed us around Savaii was also involved. Two suicides resulted\r\nfrom the scandal, which set the Talking Men off again, asking why the\r\nEuropeans sent such people to teach them morals.\r\n\r\nOn top of these grievances, and dozens of smaller ones, came the Mau.\r\nAt first it was passive resistance, then in 1928 there was bloodshed.\r\nTamasese, a justly exiled pretender to Samoa’s shadow-throne, came back\r\nto Apia with a howling demonstration. Richardson, tired and sick, had\r\nresigned in favor of Colonel Allen, a New Zealander with a cool blue\r\neye and guts to spare. When the mob battered in Officer Abram’s head\r\nwith a stone Allen’s police fired on them, as they were ordered to do\r\nin case of violence.\r\n\r\nThat was all the blood spilled; but it might have been better for the\r\nSamoans if the rebellion had been stifled by force of arms. It went\r\non for years, passively. Nelson was banished to New Zealand, where he\r\nmanaged his revolt by wire. After the quarrel was settled, over the\r\nfestering carcass of Samoa, there came Nelson’s Napoleonic return. But\r\nthere was no Waterloo; only a popular clamor to give him the place of\r\nleader in the native parliament as well as to admit him to the European\r\nLegislative Council. The new Administration refused him this bi-racial\r\nprivilege with the remark, “You can’t wear trousers and a _lavalava_ at\r\nthe same time.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs you study small life under the lens and watch the microcosm work out\r\nits cycle, so you can look at Western Samoa and see the after-effects\r\nof war over this wrongheaded world. The doctor rushes in afterwards\r\nand tries to patch up the innocent and the guilty. Samoa, when the Mau\r\nsubsided, knew a terrible aftermath. The Samoans hadn’t got back Samoa;\r\nall they had received was a resurgence of the native diseases which a\r\ncareful Mandate had struggled so valiantly and successfully to cleanse.\r\nDevoted men had worked for many years to accomplish what five years of\r\nrebellion had undone.\r\n\r\nIt was five years after the Mau began before co-operation between\r\nthe Government and the Rockefeller Foundation could begin salvage\r\noperations. When I returned to Samoa to have the Foundation’s share\r\nin cleaning up the Mau pigsty, I shook my head at the sorry change.\r\nThe beautiful Samoan children--and nothing can be more beautiful--were\r\npitiful little things, their skins a scab, their faces eaten with yaws.\r\nThe tea-rose skin had faded to gray; intestinal parasites were sucking\r\nagain at their blood and lymph. The Mau had turned against its own\r\npeople instead of its enemy. Argument had triumphed over reason, the\r\nPolynesian had junked his high intelligence and become an Intellectual.\r\n\r\nSamoa for the Samoans! Ignore every order of the white intruder with\r\nall their nosy medical men, dinging away at keeping clean, keeping the\r\nwater pure, reporting sickness. Ignore their impudent instructions\r\nabout repairing fly-proof latrines. Ignore vital statistics. Tear them\r\nup. Ignore everything but Samoa for Samoans.\r\n\r\nThe latrines rotted or were torn down by the indignant. Water supplies\r\nfestered. Clean in his habits from days of old, the Samoan jettisoned\r\nthe ancient tabu and gave over mischievously to soil pollution. Fields\r\nand villages stank with a foulness which defied the Administration\r\nwhile it killed the Samoans. It was hard to approach some of the\r\nsettlements, they were so odorous of decay. Samoa had certainly cut off\r\nher nose to spite her face.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to collect vital statistics during that spell of\r\nmadness. The death toll was a matter of eye measurement. We plunged in\r\nwith rolled-up sleeves to give all possible help. Tragic as it was,\r\nthe devastation proved to be less than that of the influenza epidemic\r\nin 1918. Yaws was the principal problem, almost universal with the\r\nyoung. A giant campaign was organized, our combined workers gave 89,000\r\ninjections, including treatments and re-treatments. For experience\r\nhas taught medicine that this disease is stubborn and may reappear in\r\ndeep-seated conditions after the superficial symptoms have vanished.\r\nHowever, in our wide mass treatments our main effort was to cure the\r\nopen sores which spread infection.\r\n\r\nIn 1933, when New Zealand took its yaws census of Samoa, the figures\r\nshowed the population on the upgrade again. The forward march will go\r\non, I think, unless some Liberator decides to turn these islands over\r\nto Germany or Russia or Italy. Then again there will be hell in warm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmerican Samoa, Uncle Sam’s split in the three-cornered deal of 1900,\r\nI did not survey until my Pacific adventures were nearing a close,\r\nalthough after 1926 I visited it briefly every year. The reason for my\r\ndelay is simple; I had to wait for Uncle Sam’s invitation. Working so\r\nlong on the other side of the line and rather feeling the American lack\r\nof interest in an American enterprise, I’m afraid that I was rather\r\nprejudiced against the administration of our lovely little possession,\r\ncentered in Pago Pago.\r\n\r\nIn many ways I was happily disappointed when I came at last to make\r\na short survey--all in spite of the fact that I was annoyed by the\r\nunfairness of our home folks in their comparison of the two Samoas. So\r\nmany sweet lady-tourists from Boston and Keokuk have sailed into Pago\r\nPago’s bright waters, which lie smooth as a lake inside the leafy oval\r\nof a dead volcano. There’s the old Flag again and our gallant sailors\r\nin white. Why, this is the naughty land of Miss Sadie Thompson! Why,\r\nwe’ve all seen that lovely, wicked play called “Rain”--but the scenery\r\ndoesn’t do Pago Pago anything like justice.... It’s all so peaceful\r\nand orderly, isn’t it? Quite different from Western Samoa over there,\r\nwhere they’ve certainly made a hash of it. See the handsome Commandant,\r\nwho seems to boss Pago Pago with a velvet glove. Let’s call him “Uncle\r\nSamoa”!\r\n\r\nThis is a sort of autopropaganda, born of national pride. Overnight\r\ntrippers cannot see--how can they?--that Uncle Sam has guinea-pigged a\r\nrace, or that part of a race which is identical to the people on the\r\nwestern islands. The tourists haven’t had time to find out that the New\r\nZealand Administration, working against great odds with a population\r\nabout four times as large as that which America controls, is a shining\r\nexample of government for the people who must be governed. And in\r\nspite of the Mau Rebellion, New Zealand is building up a better racial\r\nspirit. The people in their Samoa are better educated, better prepared\r\nto meet civilized conditions. They speak better English and are far,\r\nfar better mannered.\r\n\r\nUncle Samoa, in fact, is an honest quarterdeck hero. His real interest\r\nin his share of the islands is to maintain a naval base; and that, in\r\nall common sense, is extremely necessary. He salutes the Regulations\r\nand does the best he can. It is certainly no fault of his if some\r\nantediluvian chapter in the book limits his service to eighteen months\r\nand orders him to sea duty or paper work or rolling hoops. Orders is\r\norders, and tomorrow he’ll be saluting the next man that comes along\r\nto hang his cap on the official hat-rack. It’s the same all down the\r\nline. The Governor is just getting the swing of his job, then he’s off;\r\nthe Chief Medical Officer is just beginning to organize his theories\r\nof native diseases--then good-by. In the schools there’s a continual\r\nchange of teachers, hence a general sloppiness of instruction. The\r\nimpermanence affects the enlisted man, often not unpleasantly. He\r\nchooses a temporary mate, raises a few children, and when the time\r\ncomes to sail back to the States he hands his family over to some newly\r\narrived buddy. Pago Pago is full of wistful college widows, scanning\r\nthe sea with dreamy Samoan eyes and wondering what the next ship will\r\nbring.\r\n\r\nA great many of our “administered” natives, I found, were enlisted\r\nin the Marines with the same pay as American boys. The results were\r\noften unfortunate. Certainly it was another move toward taking away the\r\nSamoan’s national character.\r\n\r\nThis is all on the black side of the slate,--to mix a metaphor,--the\r\nwhite side showed a great deal to American credit. In 1918 our Navy\r\nsuccessfully quarantined influenza when it was almost decimating\r\nWestern Samoa. But I must remind you that only one ship arrived in our\r\nSamoa during that year, whereas the New Zealanders’ group had the job\r\nof overhauling vessels from all the Seven Seas. However, our work was\r\nthorough and promptly quelled the scourge.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable to me how well the Navy’s medicos carried on, in\r\nspite of handicaps. The newcomer would pick up his predecessor’s\r\nunfinished business, work it out in his own way, and hand the job over\r\nto the next one. Of the twelve thousand inhabitants whom he was there\r\nto supervise he would find twelve thousand spoiled by coddling on the\r\none hand, unexplained discipline on the other. We had been pursuing\r\nthe American way, serving them large doses of democracy overnight,\r\nforgetting that democracy to the aristocratic Samoan is like raw\r\nwhisky to a newborn babe. From the chiefs down to the humblest kanakas\r\na “Hello, buddy” attitude was all too general. Nobody could tell the\r\nnatives anything. False prosperity had come with the Navy’s colossal\r\nexpenditures, and among a people to whom a handful of pennies had once\r\nmeant fortune this easy money was demoralizing. The native official and\r\nthe native houseworker clamored for higher pay and shorter hours. The\r\n“gimme” habit was an ubiquitous nuisance.\r\n\r\nFour Chief Medical Officers, coming and going, had developed some good\r\nteamwork. The first of the four had very sensibly framed a policy\r\nhe could hand on to the next one, and the results were good. The\r\nindifference of the people was always a stumbling block. It was up to\r\nthe Navy to install a decent latrine system, and no native would lend a\r\nhelping hand. They expected everything to be done for them--and it was.\r\n\r\nI admired the field and hospital work of the chief pharmacists’ mates\r\nand the petty officers under them. Most of them were university\r\ngraduates, technicians in dentistry, entomology, pathology,\r\nbacteriology, X-ray and all the other necessaries. Watching their\r\nperformance, you had to bulge your chest and say, “That’s a Navy job.\r\nNo American parents could ask a better training for their sons.”\r\n\r\nOne superior of these medical gobs had had rather a crude way of\r\ndistributing benefits. If natives didn’t show up for treatment they\r\nwere hauled out and given the get-well-damn-you orders. In case an\r\ninhabitant refused to be hauled out, lusty police came and hauled him\r\nproperly. Education by force stopped a general yaws infection, which\r\nwas good. But it dampened Samoan confidence in America’s kindly rule,\r\nwhich was bad.\r\n\r\nThere was an organized body of trained Samoan nurses; the regulation\r\npay was fifteen dollars a month, increased by a monthly dollar for\r\neach year’s service. Good pay, but the tendency was to get married and\r\ngo home. This wasn’t at all bad, since it brought new blood into the\r\nwork, and those who retired formed an alumnae body and became health\r\nmissionaries in their villages. Their training was excellent and\r\nincluded the all-important items, baby feeding and dietetics.\r\n\r\nAn acute conjunctivitis generally called “Samoan eye” was prevalent in\r\nboth groups. One school of thought still maintains that it is a form of\r\ntrachoma. When you say “_Fa’a Samoa_” down there you are saying “Samoan\r\nfashion,” and that style of treating the eyes isn’t so good. When\r\nnatives go blind, as so many do, it is usually due to their inherited\r\nwitch-doctoring. They use a _Fa’a Samoa_ treatment, which consists in\r\nscrubbing the eyes with coco fiber soaked in salt water. After a good\r\ncourse of this the entire eyeball is destroyed. It was encouraging to\r\nsee how the chief pharmacists’ mates, who ranked as District Officers,\r\nwere going at the problem. Every newborn baby got its drop of argyrol,\r\nand school children had their daily treatment. Adults were harder to\r\nhandle; they were apt to wander away and try _Fa’a Samoa_, then come\r\nback stone-blind.\r\n\r\n_Fa’a Samoa_ for deafness was another medical annoyance. It consisted\r\nin tucking small shells into the afflicted ear and, in most cases,\r\ndestroying the drum. Commander Paul Crosby, then Senior Medical\r\nOfficer, deserves high praise for his supervision of eye and ear cases,\r\nand for the improvement all around in native health.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Mau was shorter in American Samoa than on the other side, but\r\nit came to the Naval Administration before it reached New Zealand’s\r\nmandate. Part of our Mau was a sad story, and promptly hushed-up for\r\nthe good of the Service. Trouble started among half-castes and traders.\r\nThen it was known that some of the Naval staff were in the conspiracy.\r\nZealots even confined Governor Terhune in his house. I knew Terhune\r\nback in the days when I practised in Mexico, and remembered him as\r\nan upright officer and a square-shooter. But a Board of Inquiry came\r\nsailing down to Pago and would have called Terhune to account for\r\nsomething or other, if he had been alive. Over his dead body he was\r\nabsolved of all blame. The guilty officer was punished; and I hope that\r\ntardy justice cleansed the memory of poor Terhune, who had decided to\r\ndie like an officer and a gentleman.\r\n\r\nBut it was a curious finish for the ruler of what one colonial news\r\nlady headlined “A Kindly Despotism,” commenting on the Governor who\r\nhappened to be in office, “With astonishing disregard of American\r\nconstitutional principles he combines in his person executive,\r\nlegislative and judicial authority.” The lady otherwise flattered our\r\nNaval Administration, and made allowances for the difficulties it had\r\novercome. I make allowances too. It’s a bitter thing to be responsible\r\nfor the work of colonial empire.\r\n\r\nAlong Miss Sadie Thompson’s haunted beach I was reassured by a fringe\r\nof modern privies, built firmly. Tourists might have been offended by\r\nthis, but to me it was far more beautiful than if the beach had been\r\nleft to pure romance and soil pollution, which have combined to destroy\r\nso many tribes.\r\n\r\nI was glad to scribble in my notes:--\r\n\r\n Medical conditions excellent--have never seen schools so clean as at\r\n Ofu and Olosenga under Chief Pharmacist’s Mate Campbell. _Ta’u_ under\r\n Harris far better than the average, but not so good as Campbell’s\r\n work. Little or no ringworm and no conjunctivitis among 300 school\r\n children. Campbell and Harris had reached independent conclusion that\r\n eye manifestations in Samoa can be controlled by argyrol, therefore no\r\n trachoma. Teachers instill drops daily in children’s eyes. Scars on\r\n lids and cataracts are due to native treatment....\r\n\r\nAnd to go on:\r\n\r\n Mrs. Harris told about The Sanctified in L.M.S. mission here. If\r\n you’re Sanctified it means you’ve led a pure life, so you’re socially\r\n exalted and allowed to wear a hat to church. You’re not in the Club\r\n unless you keep up your dues, $1.50 every six months. Before communion\r\n The Sanctified meet and confess, to find out if they’re still fit\r\n members. The ones who admit that their morals have slipped during\r\n the month are fined twenty-five cents, which entitles them to be\r\n re-sanctified and take communion. Mrs. Harris tells of her servant who\r\n had been wrestling with her soul. Question: Should she blow $1.50 to\r\n get herself sanctified, or save her money and have fun? Finally she\r\n decided to have fun.\r\n\r\nThese two Samoas, because the population was so small, were like\r\nhandy laboratories for the study of racial breeding, its decline\r\nand its rise. They offered such opportunities for new knowledge on\r\nthe subject of one all-important disease--filariasis and resultant\r\nelephantiasis--that I suggested to the International Health Board a\r\nspecial study there, as the debility caused by filarial fever was\r\ncutting into labor efficiency all over the Pacific. Commander Phelps,\r\nan extraordinarily able physician, found that in Samoa the daytime\r\nmicrofilariae did not differ from the night variety. Dr. Buxton of the\r\nLondon School of Tropical Medicine thought the _Aedes variagatus_ the\r\nprincipal offender. No satisfactory cure has been found, but Commander\r\nPhelps experimented with intramuscular injections of chenopodium, and\r\nwith good results. These were much the same as the ones I gave the six\r\ncannibals down in New Guinea, with a decided effect on whipworms.\r\n\r\nThe roundworm question was an important one in Samoa, and always had\r\nbeen. An early observer, nearly a hundred years ago, remarked that\r\nthe natives were infested with “_lumbrici_.” In my time the Governor\r\nhimself vomited one up, much to the sailor’s delight. Strangely enough,\r\nhookworm was scarce; moisture, heat and soil pollution invited the\r\npest, which did not seem to respond. In spite of Pago Pago’s handsome\r\nfringe of waterside latrines, the building of them was a problem among\r\nthe islands. If they were made of wood, fierce winds blew them down.\r\nConcrete was fairly expensive. Lieutenant Commander P. J. Halloran came\r\nacross with the best idea yet for tropical arrangements, and although\r\nthe humorists called them “Halloran’s Privies,” many were set up and\r\nproved entirely satisfactory. A unit cost $400 and would accommodate\r\nten, five on a side. Molded in quantity--for they were practically all\r\nconcrete--they would cost about $250 per unit, built over a concrete\r\ntrough with an automatic flushing system. I lack space to go into\r\ndetail, but to tropical administrators of public health this plan ought\r\nto be a boon.\r\n\r\nThe Navy was going at the job in its own way, and in many regards was\r\nextremely thorough. In the hospitals it even made blood tests to\r\ndetermine Samoa’s racial origin. Hawaiians, as blood-examination has\r\nfound, are in Group A, the world’s largest racial stock, the Caucasian\r\nor Caucasoid. But some of the Pacific blacks are also heavy in “A.” The\r\naborigines are usually in Group O, as witness the American Indian. But\r\nblood donors in the hospital at Pago Pago revealed such a predominance\r\nof Group O that, from that angle at least, it would prove that the\r\nPolynesians are of a mixed stock.\r\n\r\nMixed in blood or mixed in ideals, I still have faith in the\r\nPolynesian’s ability to survive against a civilization that has been\r\nthrust upon him. To our credit, the native population of American Samoa\r\nhas about doubled since we took command. In 1900 it was 5,679, and in\r\nless than forty years it had risen to 11,638. America’s experiment is\r\nrestoring health to our Polynesians. In doing so, I hope we have not\r\nlost them their way of living, which was a very good way indeed.\r\n\r\nAlthough quite unfortified, American Samoa, centering in Pago Pago,\r\nis a powerful link in that chain of steel we are drawing across the\r\nPacific. And what if an aggressor should happen to want it? Well, it’s\r\none of the great fueling stations, and oil is the food of war nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPIG ARISTOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adventist pastor who had only two converts led me into a dark,\r\ngnarled jungle. With every step I was forced to remember that this was\r\nnot Samoa with its kindly government and courteous natives. We were\r\non one of the blackest spots in the New Hebrides, and right across\r\nthe stream was wild Malekula where the Big Nambas had added liquor\r\nand firearms to the ancient art of man-eating. “This way, please,”\r\nwhispered the Pastor, as if it were a prayer meeting. Ahead of us broke\r\na light from many torches, moving ceremoniously around a great square.\r\n\r\nNow and then a rifle cracked. Musicians were whistling on reeded Pan’s\r\npipes; _oom, oom_ sounded the enormous wooden drums. Over the spectacle\r\ntowered graven images, demoniacal human shapes and forms of swooping\r\nbirds. It was a barbaric choral scene, everything centered on the star\r\nperformers. Then I turned my eyes--and saw it. A painted man stood on\r\na high stone pulpit, gesturing and counting. Below him another painted\r\nman wielded a mallet. Victims were being hauled up, screaming, only\r\nto be silenced by a crack on the skull. There was a chanted hymn of\r\npraise. The donor, who had contributed the sacrifice, held an honored\r\nplace apart. Crack went the mallet again. Another body was dragged\r\naway....\r\n\r\nThey were killing pigs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is a glimpse of the New Hebrides as I saw them in 1925. On other\r\ngroups we had already launched curative campaigns as wide as our\r\nnumbers would permit. My plans for an advanced School to train Native\r\nPractitioners had not come to anything definite, and there I stood\r\nalone on one of Oceania’s plague spots. Well, not alone, for I had\r\nMalakai with me.\r\n\r\nI had come full of curiosity, hoping to check up some of the causes\r\nof racial decay in the New Hebrides, that unfortunate double chain\r\nof islands where the population had been dwindling for well over a\r\nhundred years. Jogging shoulders with suave Samoa on the one hand\r\nand tamed Fiji on the other, these thirty wild islands remained the\r\nlawless stepchildren of a bad government called the Condominium\r\n(aptly nicknamed “Pandemonium”), a sort of Siamese-twin arrangement\r\nmade between England and France in 1907. There was a Frenchman in one\r\nGovernment House, a Britisher in the other. The only occasions I ever\r\nsaw the Condominium get together were on the King’s Birthday and July\r\nFourteenth.\r\n\r\nThe heroic pig-killing was a rather open session of one of the native\r\nsecret societies, which have controlled the New Hebrides from time\r\nimmemorial. In my study of depopulation I was glad to have seen it.\r\nBecause it was a cause of racial decline? Quite to the contrary. For\r\nuncounted generations it had been the social pulse of tribal life.\r\nEuropean meddling was weakening the fabric of these mystic orders and\r\ngiving the native no substitute. Let me remind you again that races\r\ndie out for three established reasons: imported disease, the decay of\r\ncustom, and a lack of will to live. Imported disease is easily the most\r\nimportant of the killers, but the three together produce results dismal\r\nto behold.\r\n\r\nIt was on the tiny island of Atchin, off wild Malekula, that I saw the\r\npig ceremony. My survey was half over, and I had already seen enough\r\ndemoralization to understand what happens when the ruling white man\r\nis too indifferent or poorly equipped to take up his burden. In Vila,\r\nthe little capital where M. D’Arbousier, a cultured mulatto gentleman,\r\ngoverned for the French, and Mr. Smith-Rewse, a kindly Britisher,\r\ndid his lonely best to hold up his end, I had seen a comic-opera\r\ndemonstration of authority. The French half of the twin, it seems, was\r\nselling the natives their worst enemies, liquor and firearms. It wasn’t\r\nlawful, but what of the law? The native liked to drink and shoot, so\r\nwhy not accommodate him? The British pretended to frown on this. How\r\nmuch their frowns meant is herein illustrated:--\r\n\r\nWe were playing tennis behind the neat British Residency when a police\r\nofficial was suddenly called from the game. He sauntered away and\r\nfound the trouble, a noisy altercation over a police patrol which, for\r\nunexplained reasons, he had set in front of a trading store. Trader Le\r\nMeskime was in a dither; the show of arms was scaring away natives who\r\nhad come to buy toddy. A large number of them, mixed with Tonkinese,\r\nwere huddled outside, not daring to approach. _Incroyable!_ What an\r\noutrage to keep an honest Frenchman from his honest profits! So the\r\naccommodating British police official moved his guard and the dark\r\ncustomers filed in to spend a week’s wages on a Saturday-night jag, as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nThe sale of booze and bullets to a Stone Age people made the French\r\nvery popular, you may be sure. French ships with supplies of opium\r\nfor the Tonkinese, and some for the natives, were popular, too. Ask\r\na discouraged official if there were no laws in the New Hebrides and\r\nhe’d groan, “Plenty of them.” Perhaps he would show you a “Joint\r\nResolution,” passed in May, 1922, for the Island of Tanna and\r\nbeginning, “The Joint Order of January 2nd is repealed.” It was a nice\r\npiece of paper, which seemed to cover everything in the way of land\r\nclaims. The only trouble was that the French and British settlers\r\nbetween them had put in more claims for property than there was land\r\nin the New Hebrides. In the old days any pioneer who came along would\r\ntrade a bauble with a native chief for “all the land from here to there\r\nand as far back as I can see.” The native, who probably had no claim on\r\nthe land, would cheerfully make his mark on a piece of paper, call in\r\na friend as witness--and another rainbow sale would be more or less on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nThe Joint Court was supposed to settle the quarrels that rose over\r\nshaky claims. But since the Court postponed its meetings from year to\r\nyear, the witness who opposed a claim was usually dead before they met.\r\nThe judicial body could not function unless all members were present,\r\nand some were always on leave. Soreheads proclaimed that the Court\r\npreferred it that way--the fewer witnesses the less trouble.\r\n\r\nThe French had a way of shooting the natives off land on which a\r\n“legal” claim had been filed. The dazed aborigines, of course, hadn’t\r\nthe vaguest idea what it was all about. But the canny Frenchmen knew.\r\nThey always raided native plantations where the trees were bearing and\r\ngathered the nuts until their own newly planted acres began to yield.\r\n\r\nBlack men on Malekula, Santo, and Malo were doing as little as possible\r\nto help the unwelcome white man, though their murderers ran to the\r\nmissions to be handily converted and missionaries often sheltered\r\nrefugees from the rough work of “recruiting” for contract labor. French\r\nplanters were tricking men into service, holding them indefinitely in\r\nthe chains of drink and debt. Only about 13,000 of the possible 50,000\r\ninhabitants were under any semblance of government control. There were\r\neight government agents to enforce what order they could with a handful\r\nof sketchy native police. In a perfect climate, blessing a soil that\r\nflowed with milk and honey, there were but four British plantations.\r\nThe French had crowded the others out.\r\n\r\nThe public health physician must study a population from all angles,\r\nand New Hebridean angles were odd. It would require volumes of\r\nanthropological data, with charts, to outline the cobweb of family\r\nstructure on these islands.[5] In one rough sentence: The northern\r\nand more Polynesian half of this double archipelago was matrilinear\r\n(inheriting through the mother) while the negroid folk of the south\r\nwere patrilinear (inheriting from the father’s side). Among the bearded\r\nnatives of Malekula the wives were squaws, while their lords slept with\r\nrifles and bottles of toddy. Women were forbidden the men’s sacred\r\nenclosure. A true man cooked for himself and never let female hands\r\ndefile his food.\r\n\r\nWomen had their value, however. On one island off Malekula I watched\r\nnative boats every morning, being shoved off; the women were rowing\r\nacross to work the “gardens” (truck farms) on the opposite shore. Their\r\nhusbands sat at bow and stern, bristling with rifles; they took no\r\nchances on their drudges being picked off by rival Nambas, sniping from\r\nthe bush.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a roundabout way I have Mr. Smith-Rewse, the British Resident\r\nCommissioner, to thank for Pastor Parker’s hospitality and for the\r\npains that earnest Adventist took to show me the cannibalistic\r\npig-killing. With the Commissioner’s party I had set out from Vila on\r\nan inspection tour of Malekula and Santo, for health conditions on\r\nthese notoriously savage islands demanded my attention.\r\n\r\nExcept for two excellent physicians in the Presbyterian hospitals,\r\noverworked and always embarrassed by a shortage of medicine, I found\r\nwhite men in the New Hebrides grossly ignorant of the causes, cures\r\nand prevention of tropical diseases. In Papua plantations were places\r\nwhere sick men came to be cured; in the New Hebrides plantations\r\nwere seed-beds for infections that the workers carried back to the\r\nvillages. Natives had become so enfeebled that the French were\r\nimporting Tonkinese. These yellow strangers were contributing a new\r\ndisease-picture to a land that had not yet set up an immunity to the\r\nscourges brought in by Europeans 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nAs to hookworm, the _Necator americanus_, I found the prospects pretty\r\ndoleful. I was told that if I asked for specimens on Malekula the Big\r\nNambas would either take a pot shot at me or run howling to the jungle.\r\nEven the missionized ones feared that I was collecting fragments of\r\nexcreta for purposes of witch-doctoring. One of them, whom I tried to\r\nconvince to the contrary, shook his bushy head stubbornly. “No, master.\r\nDis would spoil me fellow altogether.” However, through the help of a\r\nfew responsible white residents, I made enough worm counts to suspect\r\nthat the general infection in the New Hebrides would run to something\r\nover 94 per cent. That meant that on our future curative campaign we\r\nwould have to treat the whole population.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Malekula the government yacht _Euphrosyne_ touched at\r\nlittle Atchin. The mission bell was ringing lustily, but when services\r\nwere over only four sad natives came out of church. Pastor Parker took\r\nus to his house and fed us on the fat of the land--strictly vegetable\r\nfat. After dinner we smoked pipes and cigarettes around the table, and\r\nneither the Pastor nor his wife said a word. The Commissioner’s sins\r\nwere to be respected. Anyhow, we’d be off for Malekula in a day or so.\r\n\r\nBut on the hour when the _Euphrosyne_ was about to depart Smith-Rewse\r\nsaid to our host, “Parson Parker, I expect you to see that Dr. Lambert\r\ndoesn’t go into the Big Nambas country.” A bush war was going on over\r\nthere, and the Commissioner’s word was law.\r\n\r\nThe Big Nambas and the Little Nambas, let me explain, are two savage\r\ncults among the innumerable divisions and subdivisions in the New\r\nHebrides. They go naked, except for a wrapping of dried banana leaves\r\naround their genitals. This wrapping, called the _nambas_, is large\r\nwith the Big Nambas and small with the Little Nambas. Both cults were\r\nrather untamed in those days. Mr. Smith-Rewse told me about his last\r\ntrip to Malekula, and the murderer he brought back. The man couldn’t\r\nunderstand why he was arrested, although he had just buried his infant\r\ndaughter alive. All the way back to Vila he pleaded, “Master, me no\r\nlike go jail. More better you make me belong police.” That happened in\r\npeacetime, the Commissioner said. In wartime Malekula needed a major\r\ngeneral more than it needed a doctor.\r\n\r\nLater on I saw plenty of Malekula.\r\n\r\nSo I was left alone with Pastor Parker. I went out on the veranda, lit\r\nmy pipe and heard his gentle voice saying, “Doctor, I’m afraid you’ll\r\nhave to stop smoking in the house or on the veranda. I must enforce\r\nthe rules of our faith.” A chronic smoker, I struck a compromise.\r\nI’d move to the lawn and let the Pastor talk to me from the veranda,\r\nif he didn’t mind shouting. This was quite satisfactory, except when\r\nit rained. I had much idle time on my hands. Atchin was too small to\r\nafford many conclusions, except that the people were pretty heavily\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\nMostly in shouts, Pastor Parker unloaded his peck of troubles. How\r\nhis predecessor had moved to another station and all his converts had\r\nbackslid when he stopped paying them a salary. He had worked on the\r\npatronage system, and his expensive conversions had drained the mission\r\nexchequer. Pastor Parker had never had enough money to make a wide\r\nappeal. In several years of purely spiritual effort he had only made\r\ntwo converts, a pair of primitives who were living in sin with heathen\r\nwives. The wives always accompanied them to church.\r\n\r\nTrouble had been waiting for Pastor Parker when he took charge. The\r\nweek they moved in, the place was raided by Big Nambas, who had plenty\r\nof guns and did plenty of shooting. The barricaded Parkers might have\r\nfurnished long pig for the pig lovers but for a rescuing party of\r\nPresbyterians. To Parker’s Adventist mind Presbyterians were limbs of\r\nSatan, but they saved him just the same, and advised him to move out.\r\nThe Pastor informed them that he had come there to preach the True\r\nGospel, and by Jehovah, he’d stay.\r\n\r\nHe was brave according to his lights. Once, in a desperate appeal\r\nfor converts, he went alone among the Big Nambas and invited them to\r\nshoot him. It was a sort of sanctified attempt at suicide with all the\r\ncharm of martyrdom. The savages laughed and sent him home. Either they\r\nadmired his courage or they thought he was “touched.”\r\n\r\nHe told me that he believed there was a great deal of cannibalism\r\non Atchin. Offered a meatless Adventist diet as an alternative to\r\nman-eating, I could well understand their attitude. Flatulent with\r\nthree windy meals a day, I gazed morbidly at my host. I asked him\r\nif the pig-killing ceremony he had shown me was not a symbol of\r\ncannibalism. He thought so, vaguely. Later talks with ethnologists\r\nassured me that my guess was right. In the Pre-Pig Era, when man-eating\r\nwas the rule instead of the exception, human beings were led up to the\r\nsacrificial stone, and with every stroke of the mallet were counted off\r\nto the credit of the fortunate donor. The pig is a comparative newcomer\r\nin the Pacific, but the ritualistic ceremonies are old as Time. It is\r\nremarkable how the pig took center-stage in New Hebridean life. He\r\nbecame the unit of wealth, of social position, of tribal power. When\r\nI was there, although his cult was vanishing with other folk ways, he\r\nwas still being bred in strange shapes for sacrifice. Wives were still\r\nvalued as swineherds, chiefs exalted for the number and odd variety of\r\ntheir hogs. Murders were committed more often over pigs than over women.\r\n\r\nIt was something out of _Gulliver’s Travels_. Up to the time when\r\nmisapplied Government and applied Christianity had weakened the pulse\r\nof the tribe, the secret society ruled these islands with a power that\r\nwas super-Masonic. There were numerous lodges, each designated by some\r\nemblem-leaf and special tabus. A boy coming of age passed the harsh\r\ninitiation, which included circumcision or, more often, incision. Among\r\nthe incisionists the medicine men were still operating on the young\r\ninitiate by standing him in water up to his waist, thrusting a blunt\r\nstick under the prepuce to stretch the skin and using a feather-edge\r\nof split bamboo to cut the foreskin longitudinally from end to end.\r\nThe wound was packed with herbs, which might have been astringent and\r\nantiseptic. The boys, treated _en masse_, were locked away for long\r\ndays of fasting. I never heard of one who died.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony I first saw was to celebrate the return of a boy from\r\nthe sacred island of Aoba, where he had gone through the cruel final\r\ntests which would admit him into the lowest rank of the secret order.\r\nHe might work for years, maybe a lifetime, to accumulate enough pigs\r\nto raise him a degree in native Masonry. Now he was distinguished\r\nby a woven strip of fiber, worn something like an apron. Initiated\r\nboys danced in front of him. Yams were stacked like cordwood around\r\nthe space where torches flared. Musicians pounded ten-foot wooden\r\ndrums, shaped like fat cigars. The tops of the drums were painted with\r\nidentical faces; the face of Tamaz, the Unseen God of All.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious native bought his way into high position in the order,\r\nand to chieftainship, through his contribution of pig monstrosities,\r\nespecially raised for sacrifice. It was near Bushman’s Bay, Malekula,\r\nthat I first saw one of these freaks, a boar with artificially curled\r\ntusks. These tusks had grown toward the upper jaw, then turned in\r\na circle backward as far as the lower jaw, where they were growing\r\nupward again to form a spiral. He was fourteen years old; if he lived\r\nto be twenty-one, he would be prized beyond money valuation--the pig\r\nwith the three-curled tusks. The curl is produced by knocking out what\r\ncorrespond to our eye-teeth. With these gone, the teeth below have full\r\nplay, and begin to twist backward at the end of the climb. Sometimes\r\nthe curving ivory grows into the lip and tissues of the jaw, sometimes\r\ninto the jaw itself. The animal must suffer constant pain. By the time\r\nhe is ready for the altar he is fairly tough food, yet the man who\r\ncan offer such a sacrifice to the noble dead is well on the way to\r\nmastership of his lodge.\r\n\r\nThe donor of several boars with curled tusks is immediately exalted.\r\nSuch things are important to the great Tamaz; for when a high-grade\r\nnative dies his soul goes to a high-grade heaven. The commoner, known\r\nas “man rubbish,” must do with a pretty cheap Hereafter. Spiritual\r\nmerit is achieved at the great ritual, but there is a minor ceremony\r\nknown as “killing small,” which is more practical. Here the donor\r\nmerely taps his pigs on the back, to show that they will be sacrificed\r\nwhen the time comes. The idea is to hold a surplus of pork, which might\r\notherwise all be eaten at one grand party.\r\n\r\nThe Big Pig Ceremony goes on for weeks of splendidly rhythmed dancing,\r\nwarriors chanting the saga of the tribe, grandees parading in elaborate\r\nmasks while many curl-tuskers die for glory.\r\n\r\nSometimes a white man with an eye to business has gained chieftainship\r\nthrough feats of pig culture. One I knew attained high nobility by\r\noffering his collection of freaks. He took his rank seriously and went\r\nabout in complete undress, save for a _nambas_ and a pair of curled\r\ntusks around his neck. A friend who had known him in his other life\r\nasked him aboard his yacht, and was so shocked by the white chiefs\r\nfashionable nudity that he wouldn’t let him stay to dinner unless he\r\nput on a bath towel.\r\n\r\nAll through the New Hebrides there is a carefully guarded strain of\r\nsows which produce a certain number of pseudo-hermaphrodites with every\r\nlitter; they produce them consistently and have a special name among\r\nbreeders. I didn’t believe this until I saw several alleged bisexuals\r\nbeing tenderly cared for. Undoubtedly they had both male and female\r\ncharacteristics, but in every case one sex or the other predominated.\r\nThey could not breed, of course; but I was informed that they were\r\namorous. There was a general opinion that only the matrilinear people\r\nbred these _ragwe_ for high sacrifice and that the patrilinear groups\r\nshunned them as devil-devils.\r\n\r\nThe communistic New Hebridean builds a stockade around his vegetable\r\npatch in order to keep out the roving pigs. With no knowledge of\r\ncrop rotation he moves his garden every year. Neighbors pile in to\r\nhelp him break ground, and he reciprocates. He cleans his patch when\r\nthe _neurav_ blossoms and harvests his yams when the cicada sings.\r\nAnd here’s where the pig comes in, literally. Tribal law permits the\r\nyam-grower to shoot the low-bred trespassing hog. But if the interloper\r\nhappens to be a tusked boar, hands off. Shoot him and you’re fined in\r\npigs of equivalent value; or else the owner goes gunning for you. Hence\r\nmany very ugly pig wars.\r\n\r\nThe pig-poor commoner can’t afford polygamy; women are scarce. Multiple\r\nmarriage is a luxury for the rich, and for surprising reasons. I asked\r\na wealthy chief on Aoba how many wives he had. Oh, about six, he\r\nguessed, but one of them might have died “of a pain in the heart.” He\r\nhad about a hundred pigs to take care of and they were increasing so\r\nfast he’d need at least two more wives.\r\n\r\nPigs were increasing, humans thinning out. That was true of almost\r\nall the islands I visited. In most districts the birth of boys far\r\nexceeded the birth of girls--a danger signal that marks the decline of\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally we were working into the forests of Malekula which Mr.\r\nSmith-Rewse thought too dangerous for a white doctor to tackle. Shaggy\r\nblack men, each wearing a chronic scowl and a beard that would rival a\r\nScottish terrier’s, lurked and peered or trooped down on us with their\r\nhandy muskets. To make even an approximately accurate hookworm-survey\r\nwas like trying to pry buttons from a live rattlesnake. When it came to\r\nyaws I found the men more obliging, for here as elsewhere they admired\r\nthe needle, which New Hebridean pidgin called “stick medicine.” It was\r\na trifle disconcerting, however, to “needle” a man who squatted with a\r\nloaded rifle across his knees, ready to repel a surprise attack from\r\nLittle Nambas or to rebuke a Foundation doctor whose technique proved\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nA few years earlier the Nambas, Big or Little, had fallen upon white\r\nplanters, butchered and eaten them. Then an Anglo-French naval force\r\nlanded on a punitive expedition. They made about fifteen miles inland,\r\nburned some houses--and never saw a native. Another night came on,\r\nand the Commander knew that people were hiding in the bush; there was\r\ndesultory firing and a few casualties. The landing party retreated\r\nin the early morning, the bush-fellows picking them off as they ran\r\nhelter-skelter for their ship and safety. Their retreat was scattered,\r\nwith wounded men and abandoned firearms. The forest cackled its jeering\r\nlaughter, “Why don’t you come and get us?” The hidden savages had tied\r\nguns to the trees so that muzzles covered the trail. They had fastened\r\nlong strings to the triggers and sheltered themselves behind rocks\r\nwhere they could pull at a safe distance--an old Malekula trick. There\r\nwas plenty of meat for the ovens that night; and when the bad news\r\nstraggled back to Vila the bi-national Government decided that there\r\nshould be no more reprisals. Natives must be approached with tact.\r\nThat was about the only policy the Condominium ever decided on, and we\r\nfollowed it, you may believe, in our subsequent task of cleaning the\r\nuncleanable. Working on my findings of 1925, I sent Inspector Tully\r\ndown there, and later some of our best N.M.P.’s. What they accomplished\r\nin the face of native perversity was quite remarkable, and they had\r\ngood government backing. Tully reported that one mission body rather\r\nresented his coming into their areas, because they had been charging a\r\nfairly stiff price for yaws injections, and we were giving them free.\r\nThe missionary attitude was understandable, for we were buying the drug\r\nmuch cheaper than they could; and after we furnished them our source\r\nof supply and gave them the advantage of exchange, the difficulty was\r\nironed out. When the missionaries charged for treatments the natives\r\nwere more than willing to pay. The “needle” was always immensely\r\npopular with them.\r\n\r\nBefore I left Suva for the 1925 survey Dr. Maurice C. Hall had\r\nrequested me to try his latest discovery, tetrachlorethylene, on\r\nhookworm patients. I was the first to use it. Malakai and I selected\r\na number of patients at the Residency at Vila, treated them, counted\r\nthe worms, then re-treated them to see the percentage of efficiency.\r\nResults were splendid, and physical reactions to the drug were few.\r\n\r\nLater on a shipping strike in Sydney stranded us at Bushman’s Bay,\r\nMalekula, and there I was able to make a field test to determine how\r\nwell tetrachlorethylene would work if given by laymen. On the fine\r\nMatevan Plantation I examined 102 laborers and found 97 infected with\r\nthe Necator. We were working all over the island, so we had to move\r\ninto the interior, but before I left Matevan I gave Fleming, the\r\nplanter, a supply of the new drug with instructions as to dosage.\r\nMalakai and I got back in two weeks; again I rounded up my 97 patients,\r\nand was delighted to find that only 16 of them were even lightly\r\ninfected with the worm. When I considered that the work had not been\r\ndone by medical men, the results were very gratifying.\r\n\r\nOn this Matevan plantation I found that filariasis was so general that\r\none force of 69 field hands had lost a total of 34 days in the past\r\nmonth. No wonder the French were importing Indo-Chinese. But a bad\r\ncompromise.... The natives seemed to enjoy it when we took blood smears\r\nand let them peer through the lens at swimming microfilariae. “Snakes\r\nin the blood!” they shouted admiringly. Back in the bush villages, when\r\nwe were making hookworm tests, the old snake-in-belly argument always\r\nworked. What worked still better was the growing opinion that our\r\nmedicine was some sort of booze. Results were often disconcerting. With\r\nthirty Big Nambas milling around, flourishing guns and shouting praise\r\nto Tamaz, it was up to your director to sit very tight and remember\r\nwhat the Government had said: Use tact.\r\n\r\nHookworm lectures in the villages, when we could drum up an audience,\r\nnever lacked the element of surprise. One day we expected a fair number\r\nof natives but nobody showed up. Then a shy pagan sauntered in and\r\nexplained that they couldn’t come today “because an old man had to hang\r\nhimself.” We set out with police and missionaries, but the party was\r\nover when we arrived. The old man had had all his pigs slaughtered and\r\ngiven the neighbors a splendid feast. In the flush of revelry he had\r\ngone into the house, put a noose around his neck and thrown the end out\r\nof a window. His friends had obligingly pulled the string, then gone on\r\nwith the free feed, vowing that he was a nice, generous fellow, but too\r\nold to be much good.\r\n\r\nIn the back country the old and feeble were often buried alive. A\r\nCatholic priest told me how he had started his congregation. He dug up\r\nan antiquated couple who had just been dug in, revived them, baptized\r\nthem and gained two splendid converts.\r\n\r\nOn Santo I saw one man who had been arrested for planting his father in\r\na deep hole. This patricide was just as puzzled as the Malekula fellow\r\nwho had buried his newborn child.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a divertissement in pandemonium we had on our hands Dr. P. T.\r\nBuxton of the London School of Tropical Medicine. A distinguished\r\nscholar, Buxton was often a thorn in the side because of his definitely\r\npro-Buxton opinions. I first met him in Samoa where he was patronizing\r\nNew Zealand’s great medical work, then London sent him with us to the\r\nNew Hebrides. Before our boat touched land he endeared himself to his\r\nfellow passengers by remarking, “Aren’t colonials quare people!” At a\r\ntea party in Vila his hostess asked, “Which of the Colonies do you come\r\nfrom, Doctor?” Buxton’s eyebrows went up. “I only come from England!”\r\n\r\nMalakai, who had been busy as a bird dog, was guardedly polite to\r\nthis very learned entomologist, and I wondered what black revenge was\r\nsimmering in the Melanesian heart. Malakai owed Buxton a grudge; up in\r\nSamoa the Londoner had twitted him about having hookworm. To disprove\r\nthe accusation Malakai had examined his specimen by our regulation\r\nfield method, and had found his case negative. “Suppose you try my\r\nClayton Lane technique,” challenged Buxton--this method was splendid\r\nfor hospital examinations, but too complicated for fieldwork. Malakai\r\nwas game. He tried Buxton’s method on himself--and got one solitary,\r\nsmallish hookworm. So Dr. Buxton had told the world how he had the\r\nlaugh on a poor N.M.P.\r\n\r\nMalakai bided his time. The malaria situation was not acute, because\r\nMay to November is the “dry season” in the New Hebrides--meaning that\r\nit doesn’t rain very hard and mosquitoes are comparatively few. We were\r\non Malekula, and Dr. Buxton had returned from a month’s tour, combing\r\nthe islands for anopheles. In all his search he had only found two\r\ndamaged-looking specimens. Where were the mosquitoes? Malakai looked\r\nover the sad little exhibit and never turned a hair.\r\n\r\nThen one morning on Bushman’s Bay my favorite N.M.P. turned up with a\r\nlarge number of anopheles in his specimen case. Buxton wanted to know\r\nwhere he got them. Oh, explained Malakai, he had just cut a hole in\r\nhis mosquito net and used himself for bait. Having had their fill of\r\nblood they had gone to rest inside the net, so in the morning Malakai\r\nhad gathered them in. With a pretty gesture he handed the scientist\r\neighty-seven specimens to carry back to London. I wonder if this gave\r\nour visitor a little more respect for the N.M.P.\r\n\r\nThis neat rebuke was all too subtle for a land where murder was the\r\npopular way of showing annoyance. If I wished to get rid of anybody in\r\nparticular I would just lure him to the New Hebrides, push him off a\r\nboat and forget it. Should anybody get around to questioning me--which\r\nthey probably wouldn’t--I would blame the disappearance to “blackwater\r\nfever,” always a handy explanation for missing persons. Or if I were a\r\nnative I would shoot first, then run to a mission and get converted.\r\nTo bask in righteousness was always fairly safe for the escaped\r\ntrigger-man. (At one mission service the Nambas lurked in the woods,\r\nwell supplied with ammunition for a couple of sanctified runaways,\r\nwhile the congregation inside was singing with much fervor: “Anywhere\r\nwith Jesus I may safely go.”)\r\n\r\nAnother, if less popular, refuge for the guilty was to “recruit” into\r\ncontract labor. Women offered themselves to recruiters, too, but for a\r\ndifferent reason; they were usually in flight from “old men” husbands\r\nor embarrassing family troubles. I saw one big black girl approach\r\na house and ask the planter’s wife to take her on indefinitely. She\r\nwas a runaway, quaintly wild, naked except for a G-string pad and a\r\nsmall mat on her head; she used the mat for a pillow. Down her back,\r\nsuspended from her forehead, she carried a calico bag and there were a\r\nfew coppers in a leaf-purse at her throat. The bag contained all her\r\nearthly possessions encased in sections of bamboo (_bahbu_). She showed\r\nus her treasures: a piece of taro and a hatchet. She was all ready to\r\nset up housekeeping.\r\n\r\nAt the British Residency in Vila there was an excellent servant I\r\ncalled “Bush-Fellow Santo,” just to watch him grin. A few years before\r\na chief had ordered him to shoot a rival chief, so obedient Santo had\r\npoked a rifle through the bush, a foot from the doomed one’s head. Poor\r\nSanto pulled the trigger, and the thing missed fire. The annoyed chief\r\npicked up the fallen gun and Santo made for the shore under a rain\r\nof bullets. Luckily the Government’s yacht lay in the stream. He was\r\npulled aboard, swearing eternal devotion to the white man. And he kept\r\nhis word.\r\n\r\nThe general practitioner, who attends one patient at a time, must know\r\nsomething of the sick man’s habits, environment and psychic condition.\r\nThe health physician in primitive countries has these problems\r\nmultiplied by thousands. He must regard mass behavior--and examine the\r\nfiles for the rate of tribal advance or decay. He must know something\r\nof the history of his multiple patient to form a workable theory\r\nconcerning the dangers or benefits of foreign contact. He must strive\r\nto be a diplomat and make whatever contact he can with the Government\r\nin power.... Then he must work with the best tools and knowledge that\r\nare at hand.\r\n\r\nIn the mad Condominium, where there was no reliable census, we had to\r\npit fact-finding against an estimated population of around 55,000.\r\nThe real figure, as we estimated it, was under 45,000, and steadily\r\nsinking. Evidences of depopulation showed in the long-deserted villages\r\nand in the discontinuance of many tribal ceremonies because there were\r\nso few old men left who knew enough of the mysteries to perform the\r\nrites. Long since these grand masters had been swept away by epidemics.\r\nOld planters would point out spots where they had seen tribes almost\r\nblotted out in the course of thirty years.\r\n\r\nYaws was second to hookworm and malaria. On pleasant Tanna, to the\r\nextreme south of the group, it was a painful sight to see the poor\r\nfellows hobbling to the fields, as though walking on hot coals. They\r\nwere suffering from “crab yaws,” which causes the feet to split\r\noddly. Others, further gone with the disease, were given sitting down\r\njobs, cutting copra near their quarters. Little attention--except in\r\nthe hospital here--was paid to the condition and its cure, but what\r\ninformation I gave was welcomed. In more settled sections of the island\r\na few injections with arsenicals were being given with the usual\r\nstriking results. On parts of Tanna I found the natives themselves so\r\neager for a cure that they were paying for the cost of salvarsan, and\r\nso earnestly asking for it that the supply was constantly giving out.\r\nWhen our outfit returned on later visits to give mass treatments the\r\npeople were so grateful for the improvement in their health that they\r\ntook up a collection and tried to present Tully with thirty pounds.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we were busied by a variety of cases. We discovered an\r\nodd dozen of lepers and decided that the disease was spreading\r\nthrough the unprotected shores; there was no attempt to segregate\r\nthe patients, although two at the Presbyterians’ Tanna hospital were\r\nbeing successfully treated with chaulmoogra injections. Queer cases\r\nswam into our ken. Here was a sick warrior who had tried to dry up his\r\nyaws by smoking them over a fire. Here were patients being treated for\r\ntuberculosis when they were suffering from tertiary yaws, or treated\r\nfor malaria when they were sick with filariasis. Here were missionaries\r\ncomplaining of prevalent syphilis--and it was yaws again. Here we\r\nbecame emergency dentists and examined pyorrhea, one result of anemia.\r\nHere were Christian teachers who wondered why so many children died,\r\nespecially girls in a land where more women were needed. We tried to\r\nlecture them on the rudiments of infant feeding; the Presbyterians\r\nwere doing their best to supply milk. On Tanna I found that good Dr.\r\nNicholson had been breeding goats and teaching the babies to suckle\r\nthe nannies, direct from producer to consumer. It was a sensible idea,\r\nsince there was no effective way of storing milk out of reach of\r\nfilth-carrying flies. The nannies had come to regard the youngsters\r\nas their own kids. Once, experimentally, I picked up a small baby and\r\ngrowled at it. There was a worried “_Baah!_” and the mothering she-goat\r\ncame at me, tail up and horns down. No foreigner was allowed to fool\r\nwith _her_ children.\r\n\r\nWhere there was a scarcity of drugs there was always a plenitude of\r\nwitch doctors. These wizards lacked the dignity of the ancient tribal\r\nseers, who undoubtedly exerted a certain protective influence over the\r\nflock. Now they had degenerated to annoying rain-makers, windmakers,\r\nsun-makers, generally called “poisoners.” If rain, wind or sun failed\r\nto appear on schedule, the Nambas had a jolly habit of shooting these\r\nspecialists and calling in new ones.\r\n\r\nI went with the Commissioner to round up a couple of wizards at\r\nMalua Bay, Malekula. They had been making mischief, setting family\r\nagainst family; then shooting had begun. Mr. Smith-Rewse, personally\r\nconducting the arrest, said that he would have let it blow over if the\r\nAdventists hadn’t kicked up such a row. We went up to a plateau where\r\nthe missioners were starting a village, and there was Pastor Parker,\r\noffering his services. Natives hung around in a wide circle, but they\r\nhad left their rifles in the bush. They were not allowed to carry guns\r\nto public meetings.\r\n\r\nIf they had wished they could have picked us off like tender fowls\r\nfor Sunday dinner, for nobody knew how many were hiding behind cover.\r\nWe were entirely unarmed, except for four policemen in dungaree\r\nuniforms--opposed to a whole island of untamed savages who openly\r\nboasted of cannibalism. It was surprising to see their frightened faces\r\nas they came up and shook hands with the missionaries; they were too\r\nshy to talk to government officials. Then with the suddenness of all\r\nsavage things a thin, tall old man appeared. His beard and his eyes\r\nwere somehow alike, wildly roving. He was the first of the accused\r\nwizards. I had expected an arrogant figure, threatening us with all\r\nthe powers of sea and air. He slunk up, a picture of abject fright.\r\nThe other, who followed soon after, dragged back at every step like a\r\nschoolboy about to be spanked.\r\n\r\nThey had fallen into a trap. The Resident Commissioner had given it out\r\nthat he had come to discuss some abuses on the part of the “recruiters”\r\nwho haul in contract labor. The natives huddled around, hanging on\r\nSmith-Rewse’s words--then abruptly he turned his questions on the two\r\nwitch doctors, who seemed to have lost the power of invisibility. Four\r\npolicemen seized them, and as they were dragged to the boat the air was\r\nfilled with pleas for mercy. I was only sorry for them.\r\n\r\nFor three days, going toward the Vila jail, the older one was just a\r\nplaintive, seasick old man. He gave me a nicely curled pig’s tusk, a\r\npledge of friendship, and admitted with the artlessness of a child that\r\nhe had planned to kill off the converts in the new Adventist mission.\r\nHe grew more and more downcast, and as we neared Vila he asked in\r\nquavering pidgin, “How soon will you eat us?” I didn’t know whether to\r\nlaugh or to cry. The poor old devil thought that our expedition was a\r\ncannibal raid.\r\n\r\nThe Vila authorities sentenced him to a jail term long enough to\r\nuntwist his imagination. When I saw him in the jail yard he was\r\nvery docile. He even allowed me to treat him for hookworm. That was\r\nsomething of a triumph for modern medicine.\r\n\r\nThe witch-doctor affair didn’t end with the arrest. Nine days later an\r\nAdventist convert named Harry, working in his garden, was shot from\r\nambush. He had been spokesman for Mr. Smith-Rewse during the capture\r\nof the magicians; also friends of the sorcerers accused him of having\r\ninformed on them. After the shooting he lay for a long time on the\r\nbeach; riflemen in the bush dared the rescuing Adventists to come\r\nashore. Then one missionary recognized an acquaintance and arranged a\r\ntruce. I don’t know whether Harry lived. He had gone to the village\r\nof the magicians to assure the women that the wizards were only under\r\narrest and would come back. The villagers had decided that he was there\r\nto seduce their wives--or that was the story they told.\r\n\r\nI offer these scenes as samples of a country where a Foundation\r\ndoctor was trying to make medical sense. Later on, when I made my\r\nreturn visits, we met every possible condition, good and bad--mostly\r\nbad--and often went alone among the most backward savages. None of\r\nus was murdered, but there was still a chance of a white man’s blood\r\nbeing shed, if some fanatic should arise with a crusade against the\r\noppressor. It had happened before.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there was the prophet Ronivira. Once in the early yam\r\nseason he awoke to find that his navel was blown out. The uninitiated\r\nwould have put it down to too much yam, but Ronivira arose and\r\nproclaimed that ghosts in his belly had given him power to raise the\r\ndead; price one pound to revivify a male relative, ten shillings for a\r\nfemale, five bob for a child. He didn’t do any revivifying, but made a\r\nhuge impression. His platform was the Bible, his program anti-white. He\r\nbuilt warehouses to receive goods from a sympathetic United States--for\r\nthe New Hebridean believes that all Americans are black men.\r\n\r\nFinally the Resident Commissioner took him aboard the government yacht.\r\nIn the midst of cross-questioning a storm broke with a clap of thunder;\r\nand thunder was so unusual in those parts that the Commissioner, so I\r\nwas told, lost his nerve and let Ronivira go. After a time doubting\r\nThomases began asking the prophet why he didn’t raise any dead. When\r\nhis wife died he stood over the corpse and made all the passes in his\r\nrepertory, but Mrs. Ronivira didn’t respond. To bolster his falling\r\nstocks he said that white magicians were working against him. Therefore\r\nall white men and their sympathizers must die. A high mast was erected\r\non the beach for the hanging of all native skeptics; and when a white\r\nrag fluttered from the yard-arm it meant a European must die before\r\nsundown.\r\n\r\nThey murdered one white, at least, ate part of the body and threw the\r\nrest to the dogs. Finally the Resident Commissioner arrested Ronivira\r\nin earnest; but the yacht taking him to Vila met a storm that all\r\nbut wrecked it. Although his trial was prolonged by witnesses afraid\r\nto testify, the authorities finally hanged the Great Resurrector.\r\nOtherwise the Condominium’s frail hold on the native might have\r\ncollapsed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAny white man’s stories of cannibal revels should be checked with\r\ncare. The primitive is a shy bird, and he knows that cannibalism has\r\nbeen blacklisted. Therefore he works cautiously. Old-timers in the New\r\nHebrides say casually, “Oh, yes, it is going on.” But I have never\r\nfound one who has actually seen it.\r\n\r\nWhen Bill Tully was running our yaws campaign in a remote part of\r\nMalekula, guards appeared around his house one day and forbade his\r\ngoing out. Through the chinks he could see a glow of fire, hear\r\ndrumming and fierce cries. Bill knew, as if he had seen it, that they\r\nwere cooking long pig. The patients who came to him next day were\r\nespecially quiet and subdued.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, on Atchin, Malakai came back from an inspection across\r\nthe island and said that work had been delayed by a ceremony. The\r\nmessenger of a chief on Malekula had come with a gift for a chief on\r\nAtchin. It had come carefully rolled in pandanus leaves. Maybe the\r\nchief was less secretive than he would have been before a European, for\r\nhe allowed Malakai to look on while he opened the package. It contained\r\na human hand.\r\n\r\nWhat Malakai saw was part of an old courtesy-custom. When a chief\r\nmakes a kill he sends some part of the body, like a hand or foot, to a\r\nchief bound to him by kin or friendship. Within a certain period the\r\nrecipient is supposed to return the gift in kind. There is a delicate\r\ncode: If the meat of a common native is sent to A, then in due time\r\nA sends to B flesh of a similar social status. If the cut is from a\r\nchief, then chief-meat is expected in return. In old days when white\r\nmen were easy game the exchange was often in white-man’s flesh. But\r\nnowadays bagging Europeans is a dangerous sport, so the meat of a\r\n“clothed man” takes the place of this delicacy. A “clothed man” means\r\nany native who has been educated to European dress.\r\n\r\nThis pernicious round-robin, I was told, had got on the nerves of\r\nsome chiefs, who had learned to prefer peace and pig. But when the\r\npandanus-wrapped package came they knew what was expected of them.\r\n\r\nMan-eating is far from an everyday amusement in the New Hebrides,\r\nbut in 1923 even white men were not entirely safe. Ewan Corlette,\r\na planter on Bushman’s Bay, Malekula, sent his native wife to the\r\nneighboring island of Santo to visit at the home of his friend,\r\nKlapcott, who had a trading store, and a native family. Later the place\r\nwas found a shambles, a welter of blood. Klapcott had always kept a\r\nrifle handy, but evidence proved that, when he turned to take down some\r\ngoods, one of his native customers had brained him with a hatchet.\r\nEvidence also showed how the women and children had run, trying to\r\nescape, before the savages finished them.\r\n\r\nTraders didn’t like to tell cannibal yarns because it “gave the place a\r\nblack eye.” They were something like the San Franciscans who saved face\r\nby calling their earthquake a fire. The face-savers along the beach\r\nwere inclined to scoff at tales of white men having taken photographs\r\nof man-eating revels, although some such pictures, I am told, have been\r\nshown to the public.\r\n\r\nThe Negroid folk, if they ever talk about man-eating, will tell you\r\nthat it has a religious significance. The merrier, slightly Polynesian\r\npeople to the north and east are more candid. One of their chiefs, who\r\nhad probably finished a quart of bad French wine, said simply, “Me like\r\nim long pig too much.” He just liked what he liked. His people had a\r\nrecord for cruelty. In the bad old days their trained garroters went\r\non long hunts, stole upon sleeping islands and strangled the sleepers,\r\nquietly, with a looped vine. They were reputed to have kept their\r\nprizes in pens to fatten them. Island peoples with a higher mental\r\ncapacity than their neighbors have often been the bloodiest cannibals\r\nand tormentors. Witness Fiji, witness the New Zealand Maoris. Cruelty\r\nseems to be the brat of young imagination. The ape-man bashes his enemy\r\nwith a club; he can think of nothing cleverer. His more gifted neighbor\r\nbecomes a virtuoso in the art of giving pain. Yet superior peoples like\r\nthe Samoans and Cook Islanders have not been notorious man-eaters;\r\nwhereas the flat-headed Goaribaris are still at it. In spite of this\r\nparadox, I have found some of my most enlightened native friends among\r\ngrandsons of cannibals.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile anthropologists debate the subject: Do men eat men to satisfy\r\nan animal hunger, or has cannibalism a religious significance? Scholars\r\nwho associate the Christian Church’s sacramental bread and wine with\r\nthe ancient custom of devouring a sacrificial hero will appreciate the\r\nremark of one big black convert. It was Communion Sunday, and when the\r\nwine cup was passed to him he drained it and shouted lustily, “Fill um\r\nup anudder time, Master. Me like im dis fellow Jesus too much!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps at times I have given the missionary less than his due. I\r\nstand rebuked by a letter I picked out of a recent _Pacific Island\r\nMonthly_. It quoted an eminent authority who wrote in the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century and reminded his readers that the missions had\r\nappreciably reduced “the power of an idolatrous priesthood--a system\r\nof profligacy unparalleled ... infanticide ... bloody wars where the\r\nconquerors spared neither women nor children.... In a voyager to forget\r\nthese things is base ingratitude; for should he chance to be at the\r\npoint of shipwreck on some unknown coast, he will most devoutly pray\r\nthat the lesson of the missionary may have reached thus far.”\r\n\r\nThe letter-writer reminds us that the author of these words was no\r\nmissionary, nor was he rated a good Christian. Many called him an\r\natheist or freethinker. He was Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\nI have criticized some missionaries as I have criticized some of my\r\nown profession. But I have stumbled so often, late at night, into\r\nlittle lonely mission houses, to be welcomed by their poor best; I have\r\ndepended so much on the missionary’s co-operation in my medical work,\r\nand so frequently seen his eagerness to learn the nature and the cure\r\nof diseases that were afflicting the tribes, that I do not wish to seem\r\nunfair.\r\n\r\nI am speaking of the best. And I shall not take back a word I have said\r\nin disparagement of the others. Even among the best there was frequent\r\njealousy and backbiting. Opposing missionaries were too often “sheep\r\nstealing.” Once on Ambrym I heard Smith-Rewse ask a missionary why he\r\nhadn’t been to Vila lately. “I can’t get away,” he said. “Every time I\r\nleave, those Seventh Day Adventists steal one of my villages.”\r\n\r\nMissionaries are excellent men, average men, poor men and evil\r\nmen--about like the rest of us. I do not agree with their claims of\r\nmaking such large numbers of _true_ converts; but their claims as\r\neducators, humanizers and civilizers are often justly founded. Not\r\nso long ago in the Pacific the whole burden of education was left\r\nto them. And as humanitarians I praise the Presbyterians in the New\r\nHebrides--without their intervention over the past hundred years the\r\nlast native there would have died. And I have seen the quiet work of\r\nthe Melanesian Mission in the Solomons where the workers are High\r\nChurch, yet drudge and slave with evangelical zeal. The Melanesian\r\nMission, I think, is doing better medical work than any of the other\r\nsectarians down there. And, not excepting the devoted Fathers of the\r\nSacred Heart in Papua, I would call the Presbyterians of the New\r\nHebrides the best religious civilizers.\r\n\r\nIn the Melanesian Mission were educated men and women giving their\r\nlives and all for the Cause, which paid them £40 a year. They were\r\noften short on equipment, but their hospitals were better than could be\r\nexpected. Brave people, mostly celibates. I can almost forgive Bishop\r\nBaddeley for helping to wreck a great humanitarian plan by writing,\r\nin effect, “I will accept no boundaries to the Kingdom of Christ.”\r\nBaddeley had served as a colonel in the First World War, and he guarded\r\nhis boundaries with a soldier’s sense of duty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me offer the Reverend Frederick J. Paton as the best example of a\r\nPresbyterian missionary. A frail-looking man of fifty-eight, crippled\r\nby a missing leg and a twisted arm, he took me in his creaky little\r\nmotorboat over to Onua on Malekula. Before he had unlatched his gate I\r\ncaught a scent of roses and verbena. The rich soil of the New Hebrides\r\nhad grown a garden that might have smiled in Kent or Massachusetts. But\r\nhis fragrant little garden contrasted with the awful untidiness inside\r\nhis house. Items in the litter were too numerous to mention, except to\r\nsay that he dined off one end of a long table in his big living room,\r\nand the rest of the table was given over to books, binoculars, scraps\r\nof food, discarded watches, a typewriter, some clothes--in fact about\r\neverything that Mr. Paton had put there and forgotten. He usually did\r\nhis own cooking, but in our honor he brought in a couple of native\r\nteachers who stirred up a frightful mess in a very dirty kitchen. He\r\nhad a bathtub, which Malakai insisted on giving a triple scrub with\r\ndisinfectants before he would let me get in. I don’t know where Mr.\r\nPaton bathed, but he was always neat and clean, if shabby.\r\n\r\nWhen I talked with him I realized why he was the most useful\r\nmissionary in the New Hebrides. His father before him was the famous\r\nmissionary-bishop, and his son Frederick’s life was devoted to\r\ndistributing the John D. Paton Fund. Mr. Paton was too busy with good\r\nworks to bother about his surroundings. His doors were always open to\r\nstray natives, who wandered in day and night; they just curled up on\r\nthe floor and slept. While provisions held out Paton never let them go\r\naway hungry. This Australian Scot had inherited some money; however,\r\nhis pocket never held two pennies to rub together.\r\n\r\nI think it was his ambition to die poor; but when money was needed for\r\nhis work he could be shrewd. He would pack and go to Sydney, where a\r\nMission Board was never quite able to resist his plea.\r\n\r\nMedical experience had taught me that a pure spirit often dwells in a\r\nbroken body. When he was a baby a careless nurse had spoiled one of\r\nhis arms; he had lost a leg when a motorboat fouled a hidden rock,\r\nduring an emergency call. His success in handling natives was envied,\r\neven by his co-religionists. His converts were nearer Christians than\r\nmost I saw.... I don’t know why I speak of him in the past, for as I\r\nwrite he is very much alive, seventy-three and going strong. We have\r\nbeen corresponding for years, and I bless him for the way he took up my\r\ncause for the Central Medical School. His daily work had shown him the\r\nneed of it.\r\n\r\nI can’t forget the way Mr. Paton had the laugh on me one night when\r\nI was lecturing the natives in a church at the quaint village of\r\nPangkumu. With unique co-operation he had assigned the contribution box\r\nto receive hookworm specimens. The people were pretty badly infected,\r\nso I strained my pidgin English to express the horrible fecundity of\r\nthe female Necator. See the hundreds of snake-eggs she could lay in\r\ntwenty-four hours.... “Look out!” Paton whispered. Right in front of me\r\na woman with scared eyes was holding a baby. In her fright she let it\r\ndrop. I had to stop the lecture to look over the casualty, and when I\r\nfound that no bones were broken Paton laughed softly, “It doesn’t pay\r\nto be too sensational.”\r\n\r\nPaton knew his natives, and he knew the Condominium well enough to\r\nhave an incompetent district agent removed now and then. When my\r\nNative Medical Practitioners ran afoul of European prejudice Paton\r\nnever failed to take their part. A French physician objected to our\r\nN.M.P. Peni visiting the villages when a whooping cough epidemic was\r\nraging--and whooping cough can be deadly down there. The Frenchman\r\nwanted the sick to come to his hospital, to sleep outside in leaky\r\nshacks until he was ready to treat them. Paton advised Peni to go\r\nstraight to the villages and save the patients from the shock of being\r\nmoved, and he acted on that advice. When Mesalume was there--the poor\r\nboy who died on duty--Paton often got out his motorboat at small hours\r\nin the morning and hurried him to emergency calls. The Government had\r\nno launch to send.\r\n\r\nDuring my first visit to Onua I treated 300 hookworm cases, and nearly\r\nhalf of them were women; a remarkable record in a land where women\r\nwere especially guarded by the feces tabu. Whenever I found a people\r\nsusceptible to medical advice I always found a good mission in charge.\r\nPaton’s was 100 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe New Hebrides needed dozens of Patons. And Patons don’t come in\r\ndozen lots.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had finally the meager satisfaction of knowing that the population\r\nwas taking a slow turn upward--but too slow to hold its own. The men\r\nstill outnumbered the women; there were not enough of the latter to\r\ncarry on the breed. In some regions where public health was beginning\r\nto pick up I found that the sex balance was working toward a normal\r\nequilibrium. That was a good sign, though all too faint. Its promise\r\nwas dimmed by graver threats of racial annihilation. You can’t draw\r\nclean water from a stream that is polluted at the source. The New\r\nHebrides, with no enforced quarantines, no concerted effort to look\r\ninto the causes of epidemics, no program for restoring the best and\r\nhealthiest of the native customs, no educational system, and apparently\r\nno sincere wish to divorce the savage from liquor and firearms, were\r\nwell on the road to racial extinction. The slum-scum of the Orient\r\nwould take over all the jobs of the sick islanders, and succumb to the\r\nsame diseases. That’s a gloomy picture--but an illustration of what may\r\nbefall any community, tropical or temperate, where public health and\r\neducation are not enforced by a strong central authority.\r\n\r\nWhen I was working among the plantations around Male I stayed with M.\r\nPeletier, who owned a wide domain, 800 acres of it rich with coffee,\r\ncacao, cotton and copra. M. Peletier was equally rich in children from\r\nwives and concubines. He had come there as a stranded French sailor,\r\nand in middle age his ambition was to retire and live in Los Angeles.\r\nThe sanitary habits of his laborers were fairly well looked out\r\nfor--which was refreshing, since I had just seen indescribable filth on\r\nnear-by plantations.\r\n\r\nWell, on Saturday night I retired early in one of M. Peletier’s clean\r\nrooms, and had just fallen asleep when the quiet was shattered by\r\ndrunken native voices. Next morning the natives who had promised to\r\ncome for a lecture failed to show up. They were sleeping it off.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I drove with the Peletiers to the home of M. Margot,\r\nwho had the usual store in the back of his house. We were having a\r\nglass of wine on the front porch when a crowd of natives appeared and\r\nbegan to file around toward the store. They were none too steady and\r\nit was obvious that they had come for more liquor. The Margots gave\r\nme an embarrassed glance. _Comme c’était embêtant!_ With a Foundation\r\ndoctor looking on, knowing that they were selling grog to the heathen!\r\nM. Margot rose to the emergency and staged a powerful scene. Blue\r\nwith indignation, he faced the rioters and asked them what they meant\r\nby coming on Sunday, of all days, to buy kerosene and tobacco? Then,\r\nturning to me, he explained gently, “They’re just children. If they\r\nhappen to want kerosene and tobacco they pay no attention to my rules.\r\nSuch children!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the children were howling some island French word that\r\nsounded like “Poison,” or maybe “Boisson,” but obviously referred to\r\nbooze. Their college cheer, “Me want Boisson,” was pointed-up by one\r\nbig voice in the bedlam: “Suppose you no pay me my five pounds wages\r\nalong grog--me want Boisson!” And the Margots were loudly protesting\r\nthat they had never heard of such a thing. Neighbors ought to be\r\nashamed to give grog to those poor boys.\r\n\r\nWe left in the midst of the embarrassing scene; left Margot to unbolt a\r\nside door and begin serving the customers. I let out a vulgar American\r\nhorse-laugh. How furious the Margots must have been at Peletier for\r\ntaking me there on Sunday! Peletier drove moodily away and tried to\r\ncontinue the argument about natives wanting kerosene and tobacco. When\r\nI asked him if I looked like a jackass he changed his tune. You had to\r\nsell grog, he said, if you wanted to keep anybody on your plantation.\r\nEven the British did it on the sly.\r\n\r\nM. Margot’s side-door trade was mild compared to what I saw on another\r\nisland. Saturday night again. Nude figures were dancing around a fire.\r\nIn the center of the group was a fat Frenchman, naked except for a\r\ngrass skirt. He was leading them all, contorting and howling. The\r\nground was strewn with empty bottles. I asked the man with me if this\r\nfellow had “gone native.” “Oh, no,” he said, “he is the owner of a big\r\nplantation. But he prefers to dance with the people. It keeps them\r\ncontented.”\r\n\r\nIn going among the islands we would come occasionally upon scenes of\r\nwell-being that raised our hopes for the future. Even now I stroke\r\nmy waistcoat, remembering the large hospitality of F. J. Fleming’s\r\nplantation at Bushman’s Bay. Here was a New Zealander who had\r\nsucceeded against all odds. His acres were lush with luxury. Blooded\r\ncattle grazed in his fields, his yards were filled with fancy ducks,\r\nturkeys, chickens and guineas. One native boy was devoted to a single\r\njob--supplying Matevan Plantation with fish. Dinner at Mr. Fleming’s\r\ntable was something I often remembered on hard cross-island hikes. It\r\nwas here that I made the tetrachlorethylene experiments, for in spite\r\nof the plantation’s prosperity there was much disease.\r\n\r\nMr. Fleming dwelt in the Land of Canaan and knew all the ropes. He\r\nkept his plantation clean with blooded Herefords which multiplied so\r\nrapidly that there was a surplus over the needs of his menage and his\r\nlabor quarters. Once a week he had a young bullock slaughtered, and he\r\nknew how to keep the meat tender and wholesome. The only provisions he\r\nhad to buy were tea, sugar, wine and flour. Matevan baked its bread\r\nin its own ovens, and was not bothered by labor shortage, because the\r\ngood eating was famous among the natives. This project flourished on\r\ndangerous Malekula, a smiling picture of what the New Hebrides offered\r\nto the right man.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Fleming fed on the fat of the land discouraged planters over\r\nthe hill were starving on tinned beef.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis survey didn’t end with very cheerful conclusions. The New Hebrides\r\ngroup offered a picture of a race being murdered by European invasion.\r\nFiji and Samoa had been invaded too, but their conquerors had set about\r\nmaking amends. Outside of sporadic attempts to discourage cannibalism,\r\nwhat had the pale-faced intruders done to improve this race whose labor\r\nthey so bitterly needed?... I had worked my level best and given all\r\nthe advice I had to give.\r\n\r\nWe were coming back to the New Hebrides someday, with all the medicine\r\nand all the knowledge at our command. I told that to Mr. Paton just\r\nbefore I left, and he was mightily pleased. I couldn’t prophesy any\r\nresults, but now that I look back on our subsequent years of work down\r\nthere I know that in many regions we turned the tide of health. Yet it\r\nhas still not turned fast enough to restore a dying population. And if\r\nit dies, what then? Well, the Axis Powers can always pour in slaves to\r\nupset Oceania’s racial and economic balance again. I hate to think\r\nof that as a solution. But the Condominium Government as I saw it was\r\ninviting its own fall.\r\n\r\nI didn’t dwell on doleful things when I said good-by to Mr. Paton and\r\ntold him that we were coming back to cure and not to question. Before\r\nwe shook hands he smiled and said, “Mr. Rockefeller has given us so\r\nmuch in the work you are doing for my people that I want to give him\r\nsomething in return.” He brought a package and when he opened it I\r\nsaw a roll of tapa cloth, very old and unusual with a faded velvety\r\ntexture. The markings were so faint and frail that he had to trace them\r\nout. He said, “This came from Efate over in the east where there’s\r\nquite a mixture of Polynesian. The missionaries who first touched there\r\nover a hundred years ago found the natives worshiping this cloth.\r\nNobody knows where it came from, but there’s a myth that it was brought\r\nin a foreign canoe.” Mr. Paton rolled up the tapa and handed it to me,\r\nwith a letter to John D. Rockefeller. “Just to thank him,” he said. “I\r\ndon’t think there’s another tapa like it in the world.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn my way for a month’s leave in the States I went by Sydney, Fiji\r\nand Tonga, carrying the old tapa back along the course it must have\r\nfollowed centuries ago. At Tonga I unwrapped it and showed it to Queen\r\nSalote. She looked it over carefully, and so did the wise old ones.\r\nThey all said that it must have come from Futuna, one of the French\r\nPolynesian islands just north and west of Tonga; they told me that it\r\nwas of a type made nowhere else. “It must be very old,” Salote said,\r\n“because it was not pounded with a stone, as they do it nowadays. It\r\nwas scraped with a shell, and that gives it the velvet texture. And the\r\nstenciling is finer than the modern style.” She marked out the graceful\r\nfeather design, almost indistinguishable. “They never made feather\r\ndesigns in Tonga. Tapa is still scraped in Samoa,” she said, “but this\r\none is a double tapa, and they do not make that kind.” The old people\r\npointed out the thin reddish color that still tinted the surface and\r\nsaid that it was _lengo_, which is turmeric, a sacred plant-juice worn\r\nonly by chiefs. Futuna was on the old route where traders brought in\r\nturmeric for the body and garments of royal personages. “The feather\r\ndesign is royal too,” the old people said. “This tapa was worn by a\r\nking. So a king must have visited Efate.”\r\n\r\nI went on my way, carrying something that amounted to a lost crown\r\njewel, a proof that Tongafiti conquerors had once touched the New\r\nHebrides. When I reached New York I sent that tapa with Mr. Paton’s\r\nletter to Mr. Rockefeller, who dropped me a note saying that he was\r\nputting the relic in a museum. I hope he did. I hope it wasn’t tucked\r\nin the family attic where a housekeeper would junk it someday among\r\nunidentified family scraps. If that should happen, the Rockefeller\r\nestate would lose a unique treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND’S LITTLE SISTER\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I take you into the Cook Islands, where our war on disease\r\nlanded me late in 1925, I must deal briefly with Polynesia’s humane and\r\nthoughtful big sister, New Zealand. The kinship of her native Maoris\r\nwith those she was called upon to govern in the Cooks is so close that\r\none can scarcely refrain from naming the two in the same breath. I have\r\nmade several visits to the Dominion, both to learn and to teach, and\r\nhave written hundreds of pages of reports, never without admiration for\r\nthe Government’s progress in rehabilitating a magnificent race which,\r\nbut for a generous conqueror, might have perished from the earth.\r\n\r\nI grant you that their program for education and health has been\r\nmarked by errors of judgment, and that their pioneering was like most\r\nPacific conquests, selfishly concerned with taking away a native\r\npeople’s God-given right to its own land and its own way of life.\r\nPerhaps New Zealand’s temperate climate worked on the temperate mind\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon when he finally set himself to govern the greatest\r\nnumber of Polynesians in any of Oceania’s racial zones. This might have\r\nbrought about the bright change. But I am more inclined to believe\r\nthat it came largely through the native Maori’s natural genius for\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nConsider the lusty fighting Maori of two centuries ago. They numbered\r\nperhaps between 200,000 and 300,000 souls. In 1896, when Government\r\nconscience awoke, the Maoris had fallen to 40,000. Then came the\r\nresurgence, forced through channels of education and public health,\r\nso that today the Polynesians on the mainland have passed the 85,000\r\nmark and are steadily increasing. In the year 1937 the Dominion spent\r\nwell over £1,000,000 on education, building, sanitary improvements\r\nand pensions for the Maoris. Public schools were thrown open to their\r\nchildren. Industrial training fostered the Maori’s natural ingenuity\r\nwith tools. Too much, perhaps, was being done for the native; it is\r\nonly human for a spoon-fed people to do as little as possible to lift\r\nthe spoon.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific New Zealand is unique: her million-and-a-half Europeans\r\noutnumber her natives by tremendous odds. This may sound easy for the\r\nDominion, but Government, every step of the way, has been forced to\r\ntackle a variety of problems: ancient and well-earned grudges against\r\nthe _Pakeha_ (white man), a tendency to lean on a dole, carefree\r\nindifference to modern hygiene--a hundred and one cross-currents.\r\nI have seen the subsidized Maori farmer on the East Coast, dressed\r\nin British clothes, looking like any tanned European and proud of\r\nmodern farm machinery. I have seen the model dwelling houses which the\r\nauthorities set in the back yards of native schools to inspire the\r\nMaori housekeeper. I have seen British ladies striving to teach back\r\nnative arts which the natives had forgotten. I have seen lazy boys\r\nplaying pool during work hours and pertly asking, “Why work when the\r\n_Pakeha_ pays?” And all this time, in the primitive village which he\r\nruled with a rod of fear, Rua the Prophet lay dying of a rival witch’s\r\ncurse; when he died his followers sat for days, expecting him to rise\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn 1926 New Zealand was governing her own Maoris, their cousins on the\r\nCook Islands and beautiful Niue, and had control of Western Samoa. She\r\nwas ruling 152,000 Polynesians. It would be better for the Polynesians,\r\nI think, if she were to govern them all.\r\n\r\nThe British New Zealander is not especially race-tolerant, nor has he\r\nalways been an idealist. The surprising thing is that the Maori’s rise\r\nfrom death to life came about largely through the genius of certain\r\nMaoris, of one generation at least, who seized the opportunity and so\r\nbrilliantly improved it that their zeal revived the flagging soul of a\r\nconquered people.\r\n\r\nLet me name a few of that generation. Some had a light strain of\r\nBritish blood, but their minds and hearts were Maori. There was “Jimmie\r\nTaihoa,” later knighted as Sir James Carrol, a lawyer whose scarifying\r\nlogic so outmaneuvered Parliament that the _Pakeha’s_ unjust land laws\r\nwere enfeebled by _reductio ad absurdum_. Sir Apirana Ngata, probably\r\nthe greatest of these Maoris, deliberately set himself to learn\r\nEuropean ways that he might protect his race against the _Pakeha_. With\r\na cabinet portfolio he served for years as Minister to the Maoris. When\r\nhis fire blazed too hot the Prime Minister put him out. But only to\r\ninvite him back, because as an outsider he was even more destructive.\r\nHis land laws stand today, a bulwark between the Maoris and the\r\nland-grabbers. He is still living and fighting. Highly Europeanized,\r\nhis great wish is to have his people return to their tribal ways.\r\n\r\nDr. E. P. Ellison, a Maori, was last Director of Maori Hygiene, and\r\nserved in the Cook Islands with distinction as Chief Medical Officer.\r\nDr. Peter Buck (Te Rangiheroa) began in the same post, developing later\r\ninto one of the world’s great ethnologists. He was visiting professor\r\nat Yale for two years, and in Honolulu he became director of the famous\r\nBishop Museum. I have heard that he is returning to New Haven.\r\n\r\nThese distinguished Maoris graduated from Te Aute College, and the new\r\ngeneration has not produced such leaders. Possibly it is the fault of a\r\nchanged educational system for natives. Possibly it is because unusual\r\nmen are born, not made.\r\n\r\nSir Maui Pomare died a few years ago. We were close friends from the\r\nday I met him with Lady Pomare, also a Maori aristocrat. He held down\r\nthree ministerial positions at one time; but for his racial origin he\r\nwould have been Prime Minister. Graduate of an American medical school,\r\nhe began his career as Maori Medical Officer. Once young Dr. Pomare\r\nhandled a three months’ typhoid epidemic without a soul to help him.\r\nAs Director of Maori Hygiene he treated a whole race over scattered\r\nareas. His preachment of modern sanitation and racial self-respect were\r\nlasting things. Often Pomare’s theories ran counter to Ngata’s, for his\r\ngreat desire was to close the gap between two races.\r\n\r\nMemories of an ancestral thoroughbred always pleased Sir Maui. About\r\nthe time the Ministry of Health for New Zealand and the Ministry of\r\nthe Cook Islands were conjoined under his authority, there was an\r\nanniversary service in one of Wellington’s oldest churches. Eloquently\r\nthe preacher dwelt on the Christian beatification of a certain old-time\r\nsavage, Pomare’s great-granduncle, who had given the ground the church\r\nwas built on and money to endow it. The sermon so honeyed the good\r\nworks of the converted barbarian that the news got around to Pomare,\r\nwho asked the clergyman to come to his office and hear the real story.\r\n\r\nGreat-granduncle, a cannibal and head hunter, had led the first Maori\r\nWar and held the British at bay so long that an embarrassed Crown\r\nGovernor put a price of five hundred pounds on the rebel’s head.\r\nThe Maori King called in a few chiefs, who might have been a bit\r\npro-British, and made this counter-proposal: “I am honored by the offer\r\nof five hundred pounds on my head. Five hundred pounds is a lot of\r\nmoney, and if any of you want my head, suppose you come and get it.”\r\nThe chiefs made no reply. “Well,” said the King, “I think I know the\r\nvalue of heads. Suppose I put my price on the Governor’s, an exchange\r\nof courtesies. My offer is sixpence.”\r\n\r\nSir Maui informed the clergyman that his ancestor had endowed the\r\nold church after he had laid aside his well-worn spear and become a\r\nChristian. The gift had to do with horse-racing. The British had built\r\ntheir race track in Wellington, and the craze had spread among the\r\nmore prosperous chiefs. The retired King, old and feeble, had imported\r\na thoroughbred and entered it for the great meeting of the year. The\r\nelderly Maori lay on his deathbed too ill to go near the track, so he\r\nposted relays of runners all the way from the course to his bedside.\r\nWhen a messenger proclaimed that the horse had won, the old man\r\nstraightened up, shouted, “A victor to the last!” and fell dead. His\r\nsuccess on the track enriched a church endowment, and a winning horse\r\nhad crowned his string of victories over the white man.\r\n\r\nWith relish Sir Maui told me how the old gentleman did a stroke of\r\nbusiness. He sold the present site of Wellington to the granduncle of\r\nSir Francis Bell. The deed is recorded, and the price was something\r\nlike this: two kegs niggerhead tobacco; three dozen red flannel\r\nnightcaps; a dozen pipes; a dozen umbrellas; two flintlock pistols;\r\nassorted muskets with powder; half a gross of jew’s harps.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Pomare if it didn’t make him sick to think of his ancestor\r\nselling the site of a great modern city for a mess of junk, he said,\r\n“It was only a fraction of the land Great-granduncle had. And he got\r\nwhat he wanted. Can’t you imagine the old man walking away, wearing\r\nhis red nightcap, hoisting his umbrella, playing his jew’s harp and\r\nlaughing over the way he stuck the white man in that deal? Everything’s\r\nrelative in this world, and when it came to money-sense--well, he was a\r\nPolynesian.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was at Pomare’s request that I visited the Cook Islands toward the\r\nend of 1925 and into the early months of 1926. He asked me especially,\r\nas a director for the Foundation, to look into the hookworm situation\r\nthere, but also to include in my survey the general aspect of native\r\ndiseases. He had not then been long enough in office to organize the\r\npublic health work as thoroughly as he desired, and there was the usual\r\nshortage of competent doctors. Sir Maui had a special affection for the\r\nCook Islanders, as he was closely related to them. He often suggested\r\nmy looking into the pre-Christian religion on the Cooks and the relics\r\nit left behind.\r\n\r\nMedically speaking, the Cooks were a great relief after the New\r\nHebrides. Although conditions were far from perfect, I found no\r\nserious problems. Public health was above the Pacific average, but\r\nthere were some indicated dangers, and I was obliged to raise the\r\nred flag. Population had begun to fall in the eighties, but had been\r\nslowly coming back since 1900, when New Zealand took over. Up to then\r\nthe group had been utterly neglected, save by the usual despoilers.\r\nTwenty-five years is too short a time to work a radical change in any\r\npeople. The Maoris on these tiny, graceful clumps of land now numbered\r\nover 10,000. The group lies some twenty degrees below the Equator,\r\ncheek-by-jowl with Tahiti--too close, perhaps, for health.\r\n\r\nRarotonga, so often described by romantic novelists, has suffered some\r\ninjustice from flights of imagination. It is the main island in the\r\nlittle Cooks and is a collection of small towns, one of which harbors\r\nGovernment Headquarters. To the native mind it had the lure of Paris\r\nfor the Peorian. Cinemas, public entertainment and private vice drew\r\nwith the loadstone’s charm, and the combination was probably dangerous\r\nfor the pleasure-loving Maori. Gonorrhea, imported from generous\r\nTahiti, was on the increase. That was true of Rarotonga, but not of the\r\nless populated and more primitive islands. The Polynesian is a great\r\ngossip, and when an infected townsman came home from his big spree the\r\nwhole village knew it, and shunned him accordingly.\r\n\r\nDr. Ellison was working like a beaver with an understaffed department,\r\nyet what could he do but just shuffle along and make the best of it? I\r\nhad Malakai along, my Exhibit Number One. At once he became a popular\r\nidol, a social and scientific success. When Ellison saw his work and\r\nrealized what a native physician could accomplish, and I told him that\r\nour Central Medical School, once it got going, could turn out hundreds\r\nlike Malakai, Ellison was all for the School; he’d do anything to put\r\nit through.\r\n\r\nMy hopes were running high then. Dr. Montague had just written a\r\nletter, announcing that all the High Commission groups, five of them,\r\nand all the groups controlled by New Zealand were ready to sign on\r\nthe dotted line. And there was Sir Maui Pomare, clear-thinking and\r\npowerful in his faith that the native mind was receptive to the highest\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nMy hope was to be blasted by an act of Pomare himself. He had suffered\r\na slap in the face, something no well-born Maori will endure. I shall\r\ngo into that later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Rarotonga it was pleasing to see the young people, the boys in white\r\ntrousers, the girls in simple frocks, throwing their souls into the\r\ndances of 1925. European clothes and European ways seemed to be their\r\ndestiny, and the Government had encouraged innocent dances, away from\r\nthe temptations of bush-beer and petting parties on the beach. This\r\nmusic and youthful pleasure was in sharp contrast with the plight of\r\nthe unhappy New Hebridean, robbed of his tribal ceremony and given\r\nnothing to take its place.\r\n\r\nIn less conventional surroundings girls were still dancing the hura,\r\nmore graceful than the Hawaiian hula, but they were contorting for the\r\nleer of visiting sailors. Gonorrhea, already gaining in 1925-1926, was\r\nnot entirely blameable on that old scapegoat, Tahiti. The Hollywood\r\nmovie had become the popular notion of European behavior. Imitate\r\nclothes, imitate morals. The local girl had acquired a craving for silk\r\nstockings and high heels, things that must be paid for with _Pakeha_\r\nmoney, however she got it.\r\n\r\nDisease-bearing Tahitian boys were coming over with a bribe which\r\nfew Rarotongan girls could resist--bottles of French perfume. For\r\nthis the girls deserted their local sweethearts and husbands, flew to\r\nthe scented strangers, and were sorry afterward. The bright lights\r\nof Rarotonga were luring so many from surrounding islands that\r\novercrowding threatened a higher infection of tuberculosis. Polynesian\r\nhospitality invited the germ, for relatives came pouring to be packed\r\nlike sardines in the coral houses. They ate so much that many hosts\r\nwent undernourished between parties.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of forced sophistication, a little native nurse in one of\r\nthe best hospitals approached me shyly and asked for an examination.\r\nI brought in assistants, had her put on the table and ignored her\r\nprotests over the delicate job at hand. When I had finished I asked her\r\nwhy she had made such a fuss; she ought to be used to doctors. “Oh,\r\nbut Doctor,” she said, “I thought you were going to examine my chest!”\r\nShe had expected me to use a stethoscope. It was the same all over the\r\nCooks. Put a stethoscope to a native’s chest and he thought it was\r\nmagic to cure whatever ailed him. What ailed the little nurse happened\r\nto be pregnancy.\r\n\r\nHere’s another example of the naïve sophisticate. I was with a local\r\nmerchant, admiring the beautiful sunset, when a pretty native girl\r\nstopped her bicycle. She was trig and slim in a white duck dress,\r\nwhite shoes and a flaming red scarf around her neck. What she said\r\nsounded like something you learn by rote: “I-am-looking-for-the-doctor,\r\nto-come-to-my-mother, who-is-very-ill.” I asked my friend if her mother\r\nwas ill and he said, “That’s something she learned at school and is\r\ntrying on us.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled primly and my friend asked her where her lover was. She\r\nsaid, “Luff? That is no good. Some boys talk luff, I say ‘Go way, I am\r\ntoo strong. I no go down to the beach.’” Her name, she told us, was\r\nNgapuku, and she was sixteen, fancy free. “I am a Girl Guide,” she\r\nannounced. With every breath she went on talking about “luff,” which\r\ndid not interest her because she was a proper Girl Guide. Where and how\r\nshe guided the stranger came out in the next sentence. Last week when a\r\nNew Zealand gunboat came in she met a sailor who talked “luff” and was\r\nindignantly repelled. However, since Jack ashore wished to be guided,\r\nshe took him around to the other sort of girl and charged a fee of\r\ntwenty-five shillings, five for girl friend and twenty for herself.\r\n\r\nThe Cook Islands had no half-caste question because there were\r\nno half-castes, socially speaking. All were members of the local\r\ncommunity, and a light-skinned baby was a welcome arrival. There was\r\nno slightest stigma on illegitimacy. Married natives were eager to\r\nadopt such children. One British trader I knew had a native wife and\r\nfour daughters; long before a newcomer was born a delegation came\r\nto the house and begged for the privilege of adopting the baby. The\r\nprospective mother finally promised it to a childless couple, if it\r\nshould be a girl. But if it was a boy she would keep it. She had no\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nI heard of one native who quarreled with his wife and left her. But\r\nwhen he learned that she had been living with a white man he returned\r\nand implored to be taken back. He wanted the privilege of fathering\r\nher expected child. The Maori here seemed to be moving toward another\r\nrace, and I hoped that it would be for his betterment. Children with\r\na European strain usually got ahead faster, not because they had more\r\nbrilliance or character, but because their lighter skin seemed to cast\r\nan aura of superiority. Parents favored them, schoolteachers, however\r\nfair-minded, unconsciously moved them toward the head of the class.\r\nI am not sure that the full-blooded Cook Islanders were not the best\r\ntype I saw in the Pacific. Although the women were inclined to sloth\r\nand fat, the men were thin and well-muscled, hard workers and innately\r\nindustrious. All day long they labored in their gardens, or carried\r\nproduce miles to load it on the steamers offshore. At home they did the\r\ncooking for their lazy wives, who, like most Polynesian wives, were\r\nspoiled by their husbands.\r\n\r\nAs an inquiring physician I noted the fine condition of the men;\r\nhandicapped by imported disease, inadequately defended by a medical\r\nsystem not yet well organized, they seemed to be building up their\r\nbodies against many of the ills that attacked them. The principal\r\noccupational disease among them was hernia, result of lifting heavy\r\nloads.\r\n\r\nOn my second visit there, 1932, I wrote to the Secretary of the Cook\r\nIslands, urging him to take advantage of the larger number of Native\r\nMedical Practitioners we were then able to offer. I pointed out one\r\nparadox: sophisticated Rarotonga showed less confidence in European\r\nphysicians than I usually found in the primitive outlying islands.\r\nEverywhere there was a faith in witch-doctor remedies, which was\r\nastonishing considering that these places had been in contact with\r\nEurope for over a hundred years. During my first visit I used Malakai\r\nmore than once to scold and wheedle sick natives away from their\r\nancient superstitions. He could talk to them as man to man, which was\r\nmore than any European could ever do. I missed him on my second trip.\r\n\r\nSome of the impressions I am giving deal with my later stay on these\r\nislands, but they are mainly true of the Cooks as I saw them in\r\n1925-1926.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Andy Thompson of the _Tagua_, which took us from atoll to\r\natoll, was a Yankee from Minnesota. As confirmed fishermen, Andy and\r\nI were soulmates. In those waters you might land anything from a\r\nminnow to a hammerhead shark. What happened one afternoon might serve\r\nas a Polynesian parable, and Andy was the philosopher to interpret\r\nit. Andy’s line grew rather taut, and as he pulled it lazily in he\r\nsaid, “Just a little one!” The fish was halfway in when the line\r\nstarted out to sea. “Guess it’s a big one,” Andy decided, holding on.\r\nThen as suddenly the line slacked; there was some dead weight on it.\r\nAndy pulled it in, 300 pounds of kingfish, which might have weighed\r\nconsiderably more if half its tail end hadn’t been bitten off while\r\nit was being hauled into the boat. Put me down for a liar, but this\r\nis what I saw. The big fish had swallowed the hook so deeply that we\r\nhad to slit its belly. In the postmortem we found a thirty-pound cod\r\nattached to the hook, which it had just gobbled when the kingfish\r\ngrabbed it. Further scientific curiosity caused us to open the cod and\r\nfind a two-pound mackerel. “Well,” drawled Andy, “that’s the Pacific\r\nall over again! England swallows New Zealand, New Zealand swallows the\r\nCooks....” He was like a Roman augur, interpreting guts at the altar.\r\nI studied the kingfish and wondered what sea monster had eaten its\r\ntail. And would this be the fate of Pacific empire when its shrinking\r\npopulation had grown too feeble to serve European needs and hordes\r\nof orientals swarmed over the plantations to overthrow the economic\r\nbalance until some monster military machine would swim up and kill a\r\nfish it was not quite able to swallow? 1940 was to threaten the world\r\nwith that very thing.\r\n\r\nThis fishing interlude came when we were approaching low-lying Mauke,\r\nwhere I was entertained by hospitable traders, many of whom had native\r\nwives. The Cook Islands might well be named after the prevalent good\r\ncooking; the tenderly roasted sucking pig and Mitiaro eels, found\r\nnowhere else, are something to recall with watering mouth.\r\n\r\nOur work in the New Hebrides was sometimes delayed by native hostility,\r\nbut more often it was native hospitality that set us back, in the\r\nCooks. Not all native, either. On the beach at Aitutaki was Whiskey\r\nSmith, reputed to be the Pacific’s most disagreeable trader. Sourly he\r\ndefied us to have a drink of his home-brew bush beer, and in vain hopes\r\nof establishing cordial relations I tasted it. Whenever I think of it\r\nmy head begins to ache. In subsequent meetings Smith refused to know\r\nme, then one day he barked, “Come in and meet the wife!” He produced a\r\ndingy grotesque of womanhood and said with a flourish, “Ah, a perfect\r\ntype of native beauty!”\r\n\r\nAs soon as our ship was sighted whole islands would put on gala dress.\r\nThey were going to have official visitors, a chance to entertain\r\ncompany! Everybody turned out, from the schoolmaster to the village\r\nidiot. Houses were decked with flowers, pretty girls wore fashionable\r\ndresses that traders had brought from Wellington. Out came the local\r\nstring orchestra, playing American jazz and British hymn tunes.\r\n\r\nThen the anticlimax. What a blight fell over the festival scene when\r\nit was known that the foreign doctor had come only to examine them for\r\nhookworm! That was a tedious test, likely to spoil any party, for it\r\nrequired forty-eight hours of dull dosing and unpleasant purging; when\r\nit was over we should have been about as popular as Mussolini after\r\nhis castor-oily march on Rome. But the Maori has a reasoning mind. One\r\nof my patients, a chief with a wide white smile, said, “Now we’ll feel\r\nbetter, so we can go on with the dances in your honor.” They would line\r\nup the girls and regale us with remarkably loose-muscled huras. Then\r\nthe orchestra would play prewar tunes from Broadway or Piccadilly.\r\nAll over the Cooks, wherever I found boys and girls who co-operated\r\nin my treatments, I would give them lessons in the fox-trot, the\r\nlatest wrinkle. I carried this fancy step with me, like a message from\r\nanother world, and gave dancing lessons on every island I visited. If\r\nI wasn’t popular as a doctor, I was a toast as a dancing master. And\r\nthere was always a feast. Stuffed with tender pork, chicken, turkey,\r\nfish, tomatoes, taro, native oranges, I politely ate my way through the\r\nislands. This was no place for a fat man.\r\n\r\nIn Rarotonga’s hard-working, understaffed hospital they were beginning\r\nto work out the New Zealand plan of visiting nurses. There were two\r\nEuropean nurses, one who supervised the Rarotonga hospital, another who\r\ntook care of babies and other things at Aitutaki. One schoolmaster’s\r\nwife was a Government Nurse.\r\n\r\nOn that first trip I was covering the ground and studying the needs,\r\nand on the later visit we campaigned for a latrine back of every house\r\nin the Cooks. It was all prearranged and set to go; and it did go\r\nin all the lower group. The Foundation was sharing in the overhead;\r\notherwise a paternal government paid for the whole job, with the\r\nexception of the labor which the natives contributed. The buildings\r\nwere made according to the best economical design, and the islanders\r\nrivaled one another in producing decorative effects. They were becoming\r\nesthetically health-conscious.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of esthetics, I must mention a social event among the\r\nEuropeans, known as “the Privy Tea-party.” Its host was Mr. David\r\nBrown of the Cook Island Native Store. It was an official opening of\r\nthe model latrine which had been endorsed by New Zealand and built\r\non the Foundation’s plans. The building, garlanded with flowers, was\r\nset up on one end of the lawn while at convenient tables tea was\r\nserved to Rarotonga’s élite. The ceremonial unlocking of the door was\r\nspectacular. Then the master of ceremonies delivered his speech from\r\nthe throne. This was horseplay, but splendid propaganda; for the whole\r\nofficial personnel was there and heard a clear outline of the benefits\r\nwhich more little throne rooms would bring to the Cook Islands. There\r\nwere some jokes at my expense, but I didn’t mind in the least. The core\r\nof the speaker’s argument was something that I had preached a thousand\r\ntimes: “When you build a house, build a sanitary latrine first, then\r\na sanitary kitchen; then parlor and bedroom arrangements to suit\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Mauke, above-mentioned for its hospitality, I lived with the\r\nResident Commissioner, Mr. Dwyer, who not only showed me that young\r\noctopus served with sauce of salted ground coconut can be a dish for\r\nthe sea gods, but made us the guests of the island. Mana, son of King\r\nTamuero the Second, made a fine point of Polynesian courtesy when he\r\nmoved in with his wife and took charge of the household, to see that\r\nwe were comfortable. Like most good husbands, he was confidential only\r\nwhen his wife wasn’t listening; if she heard him explaining things to\r\nme she would warn him not to talk to strangers. However, he found a\r\nchance to tell me about the three kings of Mauke who built the London\r\nMissionary Society’s famous old church.\r\n\r\nRemembering what Sir Maui Pomare had said about the old religion and\r\nthe new, I was anxious to see that church. Mana took me there and\r\nshowed me the big structure of coral and lime with two separate paths\r\nleading like low causeways up to the door. He pointed and said, “That\r\npath is for the men.” I looked again. Two fourteen-foot stone phallic\r\npillars were planted on either side of it, and on top of each was a\r\nroughly hewn stone hat. The other path was for the women; across it was\r\na heavy stone arch, Ina’s phallic sign. Strange wedding of paganism and\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nInside the church, the altar rail was set with hand-carved panels of\r\nhardwood; there were thirteen panels, and each was studded with a\r\nsilver disk. Looking closer, I saw what they were--old Chilean trade\r\ndollars. Figures of the sun and moon were painted on the ceiling,\r\nsymbols of the procreative divinities, Tangaloa and Ina. I have\r\nmentioned the priapic images, male and female, which I saw in Tonga.\r\nBut here, in the sanctity of a puritanical church....\r\n\r\nMana, son of Tamuero, explained. The first missionaries who came to\r\nMauke did much prosperous trading. Their store paid Chilean trade\r\ndollars for copra, then got them back when the natives bought axes and\r\ncalico. The Maoris saw how the good men cherished the silver tokens. So\r\nwhen the natives built the edifice out of respect for the missionaries,\r\nthey finished the chancel reverently--and into the panels they set the\r\ndollars, each one an image of what they considered the white man’s God.\r\n\r\nThe pillars and the arch outside had their own story. The three kings\r\nwere converted and the people followed _en masse_, as Polynesians will.\r\nThe leader of the kings studied his Gospel devoutly. But in the back\r\nof his head he wondered what Tangaloa and Ina would think of these\r\ndoings. Well, it was safe to drop an anchor to windward. So he set up\r\nthe pillars for the men to touch when they went in to church, and the\r\narch for the women. Thus they could worship the new God and still give\r\nno offense to the old divinities.\r\n\r\nAnd how about the stone hats on top of the pillars? The business\r\nmissionaries gave English straw hats to the three kings with the\r\nunderstanding that hats were something like crowns; only kings and\r\nEnglishmen could wear them. King Tamuero, the most enterprising of\r\nthe three, decided that he might offend Tangaloa by wearing a royal\r\nheaddress when the god had none. Therefore he wove two coco-fiber hats\r\nin imitation of his own and set them on top of the twin pillars. So the\r\ngod was again appeased. It took a generation or so for the missionaries\r\nto realize what the strange stones outside the church really stood\r\nfor, then they were so shocked and grieved that they ordered them torn\r\ndown. A common-sense New Zealand government was in control by that\r\ntime and protected the Maori’s right to do as he pleased with a church\r\nhe himself had built. Tangaloa’s two straw hats had worn out after a\r\nwhile, and admiring natives had replaced them with permanent stone\r\nones. I hope they are still there.\r\n\r\nIt would require a Homer to recite the endless myths of Tangaloa and\r\nIna. Like the Greek Apollo, Tangaloa could walk the earth as a man or\r\nride the heavens as a god. He had two wives. One controlled the sun,\r\nand since Tangaloa was the sun, she darkened the land to wintry gray\r\nwhen she took him on pleasure trips. His more illustrious wife, Ina,\r\nhad a father named Rangomatane, the Club.\r\n\r\nThis information, and a great deal more, came from Mana, who was at\r\nfirst extremely reticent. It wasn’t cricket for a Christian Maori to\r\ntalk too much about things which, in his heart, he believed. When I\r\njourneyed to Atiu, second largest island in the group and magnificently\r\nwalled with coral cliffs, Mana referred me to a man named Maka, who\r\nwould know more. The aristocratic young Maka served as sergeant of\r\npolice for the District Agent, and was heir to the chieftainship. He\r\nwas outwardly so missionized that it was hard to make him talk--at\r\nfirst. But Maka was too much of a goodfellow Maori to offend me with\r\nsecrecy, and he was renowned for knowledge of the old ways. One\r\nafternoon he led me down among the coral walls on the beach and showed\r\nme two curious niches cut in the formation. Deep inside these recesses\r\nwere the Tangaloa and the Ina symbols, sculptured with anatomic\r\nrealism. On this island, and others, I saw women bowing to upright\r\nstones, offering up prayers for fertility.\r\n\r\nMaka told me more of the myth than I could translate and put down in\r\nthat short visit. _Tanga-loa_ meant Man Everlasting. His first-born son\r\nwas called The Beginning. Tangaloa gave fishing tackle to this god-boy\r\nand bade him cast his line into outer darkness. The lad gave a mighty\r\ntug, and when the Cook Islands came to the surface he cried, “Father, I\r\nhave brought up the land!” In another aspect Tangaloa was called Maui\r\n(He Baited the Hook). The first name he gave the Cooks was Nukatea\r\n(Fruit of the Land), but he changed it to Tepapa (Firm Rock) for this\r\nreason: proud Tangaloa bade the land to come to him, but it defied him\r\nsaying, “I am the firm rock.” Then the angered god seized hold of Ina’s\r\nfather, The Club, and beat the land until it split open and his second\r\nson, god of southern winds, came forth. Tangaloa had seven sons with\r\nmighty names like The Shelter, The King of Peace and The King of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe aristocrats of Mauke and Atiu claimed divine ancestry. Ina loved\r\nbest her youngest son, Ariki, and for ages the islanders favored\r\nhim. Maka knew that his heavenly ancestor was Rangomatane, the Club,\r\nand spoke of him as you would of a distinguished grandfather. The\r\nlordly sergeant of police took me up to the flat ground and showed\r\nme an interesting relic of the old cult, ruins of Tangaloa’s Worship\r\nHouse, two long stone walls some half-mile apart, one side shorter\r\nthan the other. And here had been the sacred _marai_ called Arangirea,\r\nor Heaven, where the people gathered, calling out the names of the\r\nheavenly sons, and of Tangaloa, and of Ina. They sacrificed pigs, and\r\ncried, “Tangaloa, Everlasting, Everlasting!” When the great priapic\r\nsign was raised the women danced the hura, sacred to the god.\r\n\r\nOne point in his long story confused me, and I wanted to know who was\r\nthe mother of all Tangaloa’s sons. He looked self-conscious, and I knew\r\nI was treading on delicate ground. I had touched the family skeleton,\r\nfor Maka was descended from Rangomatane, the Club, therefore Ina was\r\nhis ancestress. Once upon a time Tangaloa was so insistent in his\r\nhusbandly demands that Ina descended from the moon on a banyan tree;\r\nlook at the full moon and you will see the shadowed banyan. Ina fled\r\nin vain, for Tangaloa followed her, and seven sacred sons were the\r\nresult. Maka told me earnestly that he only revealed the scandal in the\r\ninterest of truth, and it was nothing to be proud of. By many signs, he\r\nsaid, you knew when Ina was near. White clouds were her tapa, and when\r\nthey grew red it was her father’s signal, “Come to earth.” Thunder and\r\nlightning meant that she had obeyed and her divine feet had touched the\r\nground. The rain was her tears, the emerging sun meant that she was\r\ndrying her clothes.\r\n\r\nMaka told me how Ina, like the Phœnix, renews her youth--but not by\r\nfire, by a dip into the sea. When I asked him who created Tangaloa he\r\npuzzled a moment, then said, “He was the son of the Unknown God. And\r\nnobody will ever know who created God.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of leprosy on the Cook Islands interested me\r\nimpersonally, as a medical investigator; as a human being it interested\r\nme because of an unpleasant incident which threatened to wreck my plans\r\nfor the Central Medical School.\r\n\r\nTwenty years before my first visit there Dr. Maui Pomare made a leprosy\r\nsurvey and took some interesting notes. Penrhyn Island was a notorious\r\ntype case; five per cent of the inhabitants were afflicted when I\r\nsaw it in 1926. On Penrhyn the great Maori physician looked into the\r\nlocal history of the disease and found that a Penrhyn Islander who had\r\nlived with a leprous woman in Samoa brought it back with him in 1885.\r\nForty-four cases stemmed from this man; over a course of twenty years\r\nthirty-one of them had died, for leprosy is a slow killer. One boy\r\ncame down with itch, was declared “unclean” and shut away with a real\r\nleper for many miserable years. When the sick man died his companion\r\nburied him. Pomare found that this boy showed no trace of leprosy.\r\n\r\nAt that time lepers were isolated on the rim of Aitutaki as well as on\r\nPenrhyn, where through fear of the disease they received no medical or\r\nsurgical care, and scarcely any food. Once a month a whaleboat would\r\ndump rations on the beach. The only contact the sufferers had with the\r\noutside world and their families was a few words shouted to the boys in\r\nthe boat, lying safely offshore. An inlet on Penrhyn lagoon, connected\r\nwith the main island at low tide, had become a trash-heap for lepers.\r\n\r\nPomare wrote:--\r\n\r\n The poor unfortunates do not get enough to eat. There will be no need\r\n to ask for a volunteer keeper, as we have already an unrecognized\r\n Father Damien, in Meka and his young wife, who volunteered to live\r\n on the island in order to be near their adopted son. I really do not\r\n know what would have happened to these unfortunate British subjects\r\n if Meka had not volunteered. He does all the fishing and looks after\r\n the sufferers; for this he receives no recognition from the civilized\r\n world in either funds or praise. Perhaps when the great Master will\r\n call His own He will say unto him, “Good and faithful servant, enter\r\n into the rest of the Lord.... Greater love hath no man than this, that\r\n a man lay down his life for his friends.”\r\n\r\nWorld-wide experimentation has shown us very little of the etiology of\r\nthis disease. The cause of infection remains almost as mysterious as\r\nthe cause of cancer; but unlike cancer it is definitely contagious.\r\nFor thousands of years it has been treated with chaulmoogra oil, taken\r\nby mouth, which showed better results than any other drug, but was\r\nso nauseous that an adequate dose was impossible. In 1900 Dr. Victor\r\nHeiser, working at Manila, gave it in injections intramuscularly, and\r\nmade the first step forward in the long history of the disease. Today\r\nmodified chaulmoogra oil is the chosen treatment.\r\n\r\nConventionally, we shrink away from leprosy. Biblical stories of the\r\n“unclean” and lurid passages from popular novels like _Ben Hur_ have\r\nplayed upon the imagination until we have given leprosy leadership\r\namong the bogies. Among primitives, where the treatment is not\r\nunderstood and the extremities gradually slough away, growing so\r\nanesthetic they do not respond to the touch of a red-hot instrument,\r\nthe picture is unpleasant. But the disease is so leisurely that\r\nit takes years for it to arrive at its final horrifying aspect.\r\nTo the experienced physician diagnosis in the early stages is a\r\nmatter of routine, and the modern method is simple. Today, if I were\r\nforced to choose, I would rather have leprosy in an early stage\r\nthan tuberculosis. But the world was slow in taking up preventive\r\nwork. Isolation and treatment were everything until recently when\r\nthe American Leper Association began to study the mode of leprosy’s\r\ntransmission. They could only find a few old men who knew anything\r\nabout the disease, so the Association had to train young investigators\r\nto look into the causes.\r\n\r\nIts transmission is a knotty problem. We know that infection is general\r\nin leprous communities, but how does it infect? Medical martyrs have\r\ntried to infect themselves by wearing leper’s clothes and sleeping in\r\nleper’s beds, but these tests have brought no results. Natives have\r\nlived with leprous women for twenty years without contracting the\r\ndisease, but Pomare found forty-two cases that had been conveyed to\r\nPenrhyn Island by a man who had lived with a leprous woman. There is\r\na theory that it is acquired in early infancy and does not manifest\r\nitself until later life, under circumstances favorable for the disease.\r\nBut what are favorable circumstances? Nobody seems to have found out.\r\n\r\nIt takes a keen expert eye to mark out leprosy in its early stages;\r\nthe experienced sisters on Makogai can spot it at once; slight\r\ndiscolorations, slight skin anaesthesias. In the Pacific where\r\ncivilized early treatment is given you see no such horrid sights as\r\nmeet you at every turn in India and China. In 1926 we were rounding up\r\nCook Island lepers and sending them to the Mokogai colony.\r\n\r\nLeprosy is not indigenous to the Pacific, and there are evidences\r\nof its rather recent importation. It has been there long enough to\r\nhave a folklore, and natives generally believe that a leper can will\r\nhis sickness on an enemy. These natives know that the disease is\r\ntransmissible, but if the patient is your friend you can live and eat\r\nwith him. If he is your foe, do not touch anything he has touched. In\r\nTahiti they tell of a goatherd who was caught in a sudden rain and\r\nborrowed a shirt from his pal, who happened to be a leper. When people\r\nasked him if he wasn’t afraid of catching it he said, “Why? He’s my\r\nbest friend. Why should he want to pass it on to me?”\r\n\r\nAitutaki offered a plain picture of two diseases which have only\r\nrecently scourged the Cooks--elephantiasis and leprosy. They seemed\r\nto have no native name for the disfiguring offshoot of filariasis;\r\nit was too new for them to have given it a name. Aitutaki’s burying\r\nplaces showed that they had been a larger race only a few generations\r\nback. The bones were longer and sturdier and the skulls showed clean\r\nwhite teeth. Among the living, I found all too many cases of dental\r\ndecay. Their white-toothed forefathers had not tasted sugar, nor become\r\ndependent on the trader’s white flour. From what I could find out, the\r\nAitutaki of 150 years ago had known no serious infections except yaws,\r\nwhich they called _tona_, as all Polynesians did.\r\n\r\nAbout seventy-five years ago a man from Tahiti imported leprosy and\r\nnobody could make out what it was. Then the belief grew that the curse\r\ncame to those who defiled the sanctity of those family ceremonial\r\ngrounds, the _marai_. They tell of a European who burned a trash-pile\r\non an ancient _marai_, and was cursed. Nobody felt sorry for him; they\r\nhad warned him of what would happen. The _marai_ was so sacrosanct\r\nthat none but members of the family were allowed to weed the plot,\r\nand _nobody_ could build a fire on it. One on Amuri was so vengeful\r\nthat its black stones poisoned the nuts falling from surrounding\r\ntrees. Those who ate these nuts would be afflicted with swollen lips.\r\nAncestral ghosts are jealous guardians.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1925, I gave a party for the natives who had helped\r\nme generously with my work. To foster competition and please myself\r\nwith a pretty show, I offered a prize for the best hura dancer among\r\nthe girls. One of the prettiest creatures that ever shook a grass skirt\r\nwas a light-colored native named Ann Masters, winner from the start.\r\nAfter her lovely hura she put on European clothes, and looked as though\r\nshe had just walked off Park Avenue. In my role as dancing master I\r\ntaught her the fox-trot. We danced for two hours, I imagine.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, one of the residents asked me if I knew about Palmerston\r\nIsland. Palmerston? Well, yes; it had a bad reputation for leprosy. And\r\nmy friend asked if I knew that an Englishman named Masters had brought\r\nthe disease there, and that his descendants were known as “the leprous\r\nMasters”? Did I know that Ann was the daughter of a Masters who had\r\nmoved to Rarotonga? I wasn’t much flustered, hearing about Ann. Why\r\nworry the doctor who had given reward-of-merit fox-trot parties all\r\nover the Cooks?\r\n\r\nTwo years later I went with Dr. Heiser to inspect the rapidly improving\r\nleper colony at Mokogai. The island was divided into a “clean” side\r\nand a “dirty” side. On the clean side lived the resident natives and\r\nthe hospital staff, a respectful distance from where the lepers were\r\nkept. I had no sooner crossed the deadline to the “dirty” than I heard\r\na sweet voice in the peculiar jargon of Palmerston calling out, “How do\r\nyou do, Doctor?” It was Ann Masters, still trig and young to outward\r\nappearances. The doctors said she was too far gone to get well, but\r\nlater I was happy to hear that she was on the road to recovery. I\r\nhave a photograph of her, one I took at the Christmas party. Today,\r\nwith my increased experience in spotting the symptoms, I can see many\r\nindications of the disease in that pretty face.\r\n\r\nOn that same visit to Mokogai I had another surprise. Two familiar\r\nfigures strolled down the beach and waved their hands at me. I\r\nrecognized the cook and housemaid who had served me so well when I\r\nlived on Aitutaki in 1932.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is a slow, conservative germ, and I stand as a human\r\nexample. A dozen years ago I must have been exposed to it a number of\r\ntimes, yet I show no leprous symptoms.\r\n\r\nOne woman I examined on Atiu haunts my dreams. Because she showed\r\nsuspicious signs I made a hasty bare-handed examination--conditions\r\nwere too crude for the physician to protect himself with rubber gloves.\r\nMy fingers went under her arm to examine the ulnar nerve--and struck a\r\nbig, mushy ulcer. I couldn’t find soap or even fresh water, so I walked\r\nfor nearly an hour until I could wash my hands.\r\n\r\nIn 1938 Dr. Ellison conducted New Zealand’s last big roundup in the\r\nCooks, combing the islands for lepers. On Penrhyn he was entertained\r\nby Phil Winton, a wealthy pearl trader. Winton fed Ellison royally,\r\nand at the end of his stay the Doctor went to thank the cook for her\r\ndistinguished meals. He took one look at her and said, “You’d better\r\npack up and come with me on the boat.” Winton had made the mistake of\r\nforgetting that leprosy could come in by the back door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few months after my return to Fiji I went on leave to the States, to\r\nbe gone until the beginning of 1927. Meanwhile Sir Maui Pomare, always\r\nanxious about the leper situation in the Cooks, had chartered a ship\r\nand gone there to take patients off for Mokogai. Leaving Suva for home,\r\nI was on the crest of a wave. The Central Medical School was an assured\r\nfact--practically. Now I could boast to New York and Utica that four\r\nyears of propagandizing and wire-pulling had achieved the unachievable.\r\nAll the groups controlled by the High Commission and by New Zealand\r\nwould send the money, send their quota of students. Soon we would be\r\nbreaking ground for the long-deferred project.\r\n\r\nIt was a case of crowing before you are out of the woods.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Suva Dr. Montague’s long face proclaimed bad news.\r\nWhat had happened in my absence was worse than I had expected. The Cook\r\nIslands had withdrawn from the Medical School scheme, and not through\r\nany fault of parliamentary politics. It was Sir Maui Pomare himself\r\nwho had suddenly quit the game. But when I learned the truth I held no\r\nresentment against the great Maori.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that Pomare had gone in his rescue ship to a spot in the Cook\r\nIslands where they dumped lepers and left them to die in their own way.\r\nUnder his administration the situation had bettered somewhat, but it\r\nwas still a poor makeshift. Pomare’s one desire was to get the poor\r\ndevils to the modern leper colony.\r\n\r\nThe boat you charter for the haulage of lepers isn’t exactly a luxury\r\nliner, and the trip to Mokogai was slow, dirty and dangerous. At last\r\nhe got them there, some thirty patients, and was taking the greatest\r\ncare to see that they were properly landed. When that job was over he\r\ncame down the gangplank, not a very presentable Cabinet Minister; rough\r\ntravel in a rough boat had soiled his clothes, exposure had darkened\r\nhis complexion and he hadn’t shaved for a week. Down on the wharf he\r\nwas stopped by a dandified young Medical Officer, obviously fresh from\r\nLondon, who held up an arresting hand and twittered commandingly,\r\n“Colored people this way, please!” I don’t know how many kinds of hell\r\nNew Zealand’s Minister of Health gave the efficient youth, but plenty I\r\nimagine. Pomare inherited temper from a long line of Maori chiefs.\r\n\r\nPomare took the next boat to Suva, went straight to Montague, then to\r\nthe Governor. To both he said that the High Commission hadn’t sense\r\nenough to keep these brats away from responsible positions. He had seen\r\nwhat he saw on Mokogai, and he was through. So long as he remained in\r\noffice, he declared, no health project favored by the High Commission\r\nwould ever get the shadow of a red cent out of his ministry. And that\r\nbroad ultimatum withdrew the Cook Islands’ co-operation from the\r\nCentral Medical School. Without the Cooks, we were just where we had\r\nbeen before, helpless to go on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChildren say, “He’ll get over being mad.” With a strong and stubborn\r\ncharacter like Pomare’s, this softening of the temperament was\r\nnot so sure. I tried to steady myself with the knowledge that at\r\nleast six important Pacific groups were still behind our plan. I\r\nremembered Queen Salote’s generous question which had given me the\r\nfirst big encouragement: “Are we too small to do our share?” But time\r\nwas precious now, and whatever we did must be done at once. Pomare\r\ncontrolled a section of Polynesia which we must include, or quit.\r\n\r\nIt was January, 1927, when Montague retailed the bad news, and I\r\ngave myself a few days to worry. Then I went over to his office and\r\nasked, “What about it?” He said, “Lambert, you know Pomare, and I\r\ndon’t. You’ve worked with him, he likes you and he’ll probably respect\r\nwhatever you have to say.” I had already thought over what Montague\r\nproposed next. “Why don’t you take the boat for New Zealand, see Pomare\r\nand try to talk him over? It won’t be easy, but I can’t see any other\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nIn about two weeks I was in Wellington, where I went straight to\r\nPomare’s office in the Government Building. I hadn’t announced my\r\ncoming, and when I reached his desk I saw his look of friendly\r\nsurprise. (I made the mental note, “At least he’s smiling.”) Well, he\r\nsaid, he didn’t know I was in New Zealand; and what had brought me\r\nthere at this time of year? I said “I have come down to get better\r\nacquainted with you. The last time I was here it was so cold that I\r\nwent to Auckland to write my Cook Island Report. Now I just want to\r\nvisit.” Impulse was urging me to bring up the subject which I knew was\r\nforemost in both our minds. But it would be fatal to seem too eager.\r\nOur conversation drifted into impersonal channels; Dominion politics,\r\nwelfare work among the children, native health problems--a little of\r\neverything except what had brought me there.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to play the first card. Then gracefully, as if there\r\nhad never been the slightest difference between him and the High\r\nCommission, he asked me how the School was progressing. This was my\r\nopening. I eased into the subject, as though he had never heard of it\r\nbefore. He listened for an hour, interrupting occasionally to make his\r\nown comments. In every detail this great Maori showed the same grasp\r\nof essential points that he displayed on a later visit to Fiji when\r\nwe gave him the honors of a chief and Eloisa cooked her best dinner;\r\nMontague was there, a superb physician himself, and was convinced at\r\nlast that a Maori could excel. He was even more convinced when we took\r\nPomare over to Mokogai and landed him, in state, at the same spot where\r\na whippersnapper had once said, “Colored people this way.”\r\n\r\n... After that hour with Pomare in his Wellington office the difference\r\nwas surprisingly smoothed out. He was cordial, beaming. Why, of\r\ncourse the Cook Islands would be in on the Medical School. Of course\r\nwell-trained Native Practitioners would be the only solution. Of course\r\nthe Cooks were in.\r\n\r\nWhen I left his office, dazed by this splendid turn of luck, I could\r\nnot restrain a chuckle. Had Pomare ever intended to hold aloof? Hadn’t\r\nhe withdrawn from the High Commission scheme merely as a demonstration,\r\nto show the _Pakeha_ that he could not insult a Maori without the\r\ndanger of reprisals? He had shown them that he held the power, and that\r\nhe could use it. Then with a magnanimous gesture he gave them what they\r\nasked for.\r\n\r\nOut on a Wellington street I mopped my brow and tried to realize that\r\nwe had crossed the last bridge. The hard pull of four years was over.\r\nI was going to have my School. Now ground-breaking would begin in\r\nearnest. Now we could send all over the Pacific, bring in eligible\r\nnative boys and teach them what modern medicine really means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHALF A LOAF AND A SLICE OFF\r\n\r\n\r\nI should be sloppily sentimental and call the scene which is to follow\r\n“My Dream Come True.” The dream had backed in a little crookedly,\r\nknocking over a few ideals and dumping at my feet a short measure\r\nof fine gold. But who was I to complain? Something substantial had\r\nmaterialized out of six hard years of constant hammering for results.\r\nI think I was excited, for I could scarcely follow the earnest,\r\ndedicatory voice that rang through the new lecture hall, fragrant with\r\nfresh paint and plaster.\r\n\r\nThat was the morning of December 29, 1928. I sat on the platform with\r\nbigwigs of the Colony: Sir Maynard Hedstrom, U. S. Consul Roberts,\r\nthe Secretary of Native Affairs, the Colonial Secretary and sundry\r\nothers. His Excellency Sir Eyre Hutson, Governor General of the High\r\nCommission, was making a speech.\r\n\r\n“It is fitting that there should be this meeting today to record the\r\nopening of the new Medical School in Suva, which has really been in\r\nbeing for some weeks, from November first, but officially as a Central\r\nNative Medical School in the Western Pacific will enter on its career,\r\nwhich we hope can be no other than a successful one, from January\r\nfirst, 1929 ... had its origin some years ago with Dr. Lambert, a\r\nmember of the Medical Staff of the Rockefeller International Health\r\nFoundation ... whole-heartedly supported by Dr. Montague.... And the\r\nvarious Administrations in the Pacific, who have co-operated in the\r\nscheme, owe a deep debt of gratitude to Dr. Lambert for his strong\r\nfaith, for his persistent advocacy of the proposal with the governing\r\nbody of the Rockefeller Foundation ... without which we should not be\r\nin this building today....”\r\n\r\nI looked over the upturned faces, brown and white. I counted the\r\neight native boys of the graduating class, and thanked God that all\r\nthe undergraduates wouldn’t have to sleep in the little firetrap of\r\na dormitory, which would only accommodate twelve. The new dormitory\r\ncould pack in twenty-eight, and there was room for forty in the dining\r\nroom. The new main building, over which we were making such a fuss,\r\nwould be fairly cramped quarters. It needed space for laboratories,\r\npathological, bacteriological, biochemical. And the dissecting room\r\nwasn’t much bigger than my grandmother’s cupboard....\r\n\r\nJust the same, my dream had come true, even with a string on it. The\r\nmodest buildings we had achieved were modern-built and filled with\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nNow the Governor, his kindly, eupeptic face rather flushed with\r\nDecember heat, was addressing the student body:--\r\n\r\n“... You are receiving opportunities with limitations, which are\r\nunavoidable, of becoming members of a very honorable profession, not\r\nonly for your personal benefit but mainly for the good of those men,\r\nwomen and children to whom you will be called on to give medical\r\nand surgical aid and treatment to the best of your ability and\r\nknowledge....”\r\n\r\nThen it was over, everybody had shaken hands, and I was being\r\ninterviewed by the press. I told the reporters what I felt, that his\r\nExcellency had been too modest in disclaiming his own important share\r\nin bringing the School to life; how the project had been a partnership\r\nbetween Dr. Montague and myself, and how I might have given up early\r\nexcept for his quiet persistence; and how Queen Salote of Tonga and\r\nher Prince Consort had offered financial aid in my hour of deepest\r\ndiscouragement; how their loyalty to all the South Pacific had inspired\r\nother groups until at last they had touched the purse-strings of the\r\nFoundation....\r\n\r\nOutside on the half-finished grounds I saw students filing into the\r\nclassrooms. There was a score of dark-skinned Fijian boys with shocks\r\nof kinky black hair, sport shirts and _sulus_. They had the look I\r\nhave always admired in their race, that of intellectual honesty and\r\nwill to learn. The Polynesian boys were in _lavalavas_, and like\r\nthe Melanesians they were bare-legged and unshod; some of them had\r\nthe pale, even features and straight hair of Caucasians. There were\r\na couple of boys from the Solomon Islands, wooly-haired and almost\r\nplum-black. The light-faced, worldly-looking ones were from the Cooks.\r\nThere were a couple of well-dressed East Indians. The Condominium\r\nwas sending us New Hebridean students, but they hadn’t come yet. The\r\nFijians outnumbered the others, for there were twenty in all, and\r\ntwelve of them were graduating from the old school, which had only\r\naccommodated sixteen students in all. Almost overnight the enrollment\r\nhad increased to forty, and I was wondering how the boys from far-off\r\ngroups would get on with the Fijians, when more of the outsiders came\r\nin. The fair-skinned boys from the Cooks and Samoa had one great\r\nadvantage; they knew more English, whereas the Fijians were handicapped\r\nthere and would have to learn hard lessons in a strange tongue. For\r\nthe same reason all the Melanesian lads would have a tough time at\r\nfirst. New Zealand had been wise in giving her mother tongue to the\r\nPolynesians.... But I knew the Fijians, men like Malakai and Charley,\r\nwho had mastered every hard subject that came their way.\r\n\r\nMore boys would be eligible for the school. We would have to refuse\r\nsome for lack of space, and look very carefully into the mental\r\nqualifications of every applicant.... There would be a tendency on\r\nthe home islands, I knew, to play favorites for political reasons.\r\nSome of the officials would promote candidates because they were “good\r\nbatmen”--meaning that they had served them well personally.\r\n\r\nAll that must be straightened out, for we would never have room for\r\nslackers.... I wondered how soon we could promote a decent school for\r\nnative nurses; that was a part of my plan for enlargement. Now they\r\nwere living in a crazy shack where they did their own cooking, and in\r\nthe hospital they scrubbed and emptied slops for dainty British nurses.\r\nSamoa was giving her native girls an adequate training. We could do no\r\nbetter than follow her lead.... I wondered if students would ever come\r\nfrom Papua and New Guinea, where N.M.P.’s were dreadfully needed. The\r\nCanberra Government was standing pat on White Man’s Australia, and the\r\n“blackfellow” was not supposed to have a head on his shoulders. Papuan\r\nand New Guinea natives, they said, were not adequately prepared for\r\nhigher education. I knew better, for I had seen those boys, and worked\r\nwith them.... According to Australia’s yardstick students from the New\r\nHebrides and the Solomons were also inadequately prepared; but they\r\nwere entering our first class. Australia forgot that her Territories\r\nhad been missionized by Fijians, Tongans and Samoans.... Dr. Strong,\r\nthe progressive C.M.O. at Port Moresby, had offered to pay the expenses\r\nof Papuan students, if Canberra would consent.... But why argue the\r\npoint? Australia was jealous of little Fiji’s rise as a medical center,\r\nand had decided not to send a student or to permit an N.M.P. to work\r\nin her possessions.... I wondered if she would ever change her mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp to the day I retired the Foundation was always a little nervous\r\nabout what I was going to do next. They were usually asking, by\r\ninference, “Where is Lambert going to pop up now?” Dr. Heiser’s\r\nimmediate reaction to whatever I put up to him was a simple, “No,” and\r\nI had to pound away at him until he gave up. As I have said before, he\r\nwas very careful with Mr. Rockefeller’s silver dimes, and his honest\r\nstubbornness deserves great credit. Dr. Sawyer, who bossed me during\r\nmy early days in the Pacific, was a strong advocate of the Central\r\nMedical School, for he knew the needs of the islands. Sawyer is now\r\nthe Foundation’s Director of the International Health Division, and\r\nstill a little nervous about me. He wants me settled on a Californian\r\nfarm where I’ll be out of mischief. Sawyer is one of the most brilliant\r\nresearch scientists of our time. Considering his environmental\r\nbackground he is extremely broad-minded--he comes of a family of\r\nclergymen. I shall never forget the time I led him up to a North\r\nQueensland bar where the Australians were sneering “Wowser!” at every\r\nprohibitionist. Sawyer ordered ginger ale, drank it and made them like\r\nhim. With the same puritanical gusto he backed me up in the Medical\r\nSchool. I shall always be grateful to him.\r\n\r\nI had estimated that it could be financed by a contribution of £1,500\r\neach from seven island groups. Fiji’s sudden decision that she could\r\nstart a School of her own on a one-horse scale had given more point\r\nto my argument when I went back to the States and put it up to the\r\nFoundation. I had talked pretty steadily for half a year, informing the\r\nunsympathetic ones that Fiji’s stingy plan would set the School back\r\nabout twenty years.\r\n\r\nIn 1927 I had come back to Suva with the Board’s promise in my\r\npocket. They would fund half the expense of the larger plan. This was\r\neconomical still, and hardly adequate for what we needed; but we had\r\nenough now to get things going. I had wrestled with the Foundation’s\r\nDepartment of Medical Sciences, to whom I had to appeal for the sort of\r\nfunds required. To give out money to the very finest medical schools\r\nand raise their already high standards was the Department’s end and\r\naim. To finance a little idea like ours gave them an almost physical\r\nnausea. I didn’t get anything out of them, except to make them admit\r\nthat some lower grade of medical education might be useful, until their\r\nhigh-flown notions had time to turn out crack specialists to serve the\r\nteeming millions who lacked anything but witch doctors to care for them.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Medical Sciences remained adamant. I finally got\r\nthe money from the International Health Board itself. This was the\r\nfirst time they had given financial support to the building of medical\r\nschools. Up to then it had always been in the hands of the Department\r\nof Medical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe time would come when we would need more buildings and equipment,\r\nthat was obvious. The time might also come when some jealous local\r\npolitician would attempt to wreck the School, or drain it white. A\r\nlittle man can do big mischief, as we found later when a domestic\r\ncolonial secretary worked his political best to destroy our planned\r\nUnified Health Commission, for the petty reason that Fiji’s Chief\r\nMedical Officer would head it with a few pounds larger salary than his\r\nown. He was of the old anti-American type, which has done so much to\r\npromote ill feeling both between England and her colonies and England\r\nand America. His kind, I hope, is passing. This little man was not\r\nquite able to interfere with co-operation in the Mokogai Leper Colony,\r\nwhich we started back in 1923 and saw built into one of the finest\r\nleprosaria in the world.\r\n\r\nBut the School was open, and we were down to the realism of immediate\r\nfigures. We could admit forty, and the cost per student would be ninety\r\npounds. There was a wooden dormitory, a main building seventy-six by\r\nthirty feet, and the Principal’s house. We were well staffed with the\r\nChief Medical Officer, the pick of the government physicians and local\r\npractitioners. We also had the Government’s pharmacist, a dentist,\r\nthe Government’s bacteriologist and chemist, and the Rockefeller\r\nFoundation’s modest representative. We had plenty of textbooks and\r\nscientific instruments. In fact we had about everything but room to\r\nturn around in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wasn’t dissatisfied that afternoon in 1928 when I made another\r\ninspection of the buildings. Our feet were on the ladder, we were going\r\nup. The other things would come, though there was plenty of fighting\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nI had to reflect on the slow and painful beginnings of the Native\r\nPractitioner system, some forty-two years before. In 1875 the Colony\r\nwas frightened by the measles epidemic which burned the Fijians down,\r\nand with only the puniest attempt at medical aid. Thirteen years later\r\nthe British residents were appalled by the danger of smallpox, brought\r\nin by the East Indian invasion. The Government well knew that the most\r\nimportant medical need was vaccination, but the expense of European\r\nvaccinators in this work seemed overwhelming. Health in those days was\r\nin the charge of Dr. Corney, Fiji’s second great Medical Officer. Sir\r\nWilliam Macgregor, later Governor of Papua, was the first, and Dr.\r\nMontague was the third of the great ones. In Corney’s day the Colony,\r\nin desperate need, was sending out natives to administer vaccine to an\r\nendangered population.\r\n\r\nCorney saw how dextrous these men could be with instruments and how\r\nquickly they won the confidence of half-wild villagers. Perhaps the\r\nColony’s financial embarrassment was what touched off his imagination.\r\nAt any event, in the late eighties, after the Government had voted\r\nsmall sums for vaccination purposes, Corney surprised them all by\r\nsuggesting that the native boys be given some systematic medical\r\neducation. In January, 1889, eight Fijians passed the examination and\r\nwere given certificates.\r\n\r\nThese early students got only the bare bones of a living. They were\r\nhuddled together in a _bure_ in the old Colonial Hospital grounds,\r\nand spent a good deal of their time working their gardens for enough\r\nvegetables to keep going. They had no lecture room, no models or\r\ndiagrams; postmortem examinations were not easily obtained and almost\r\nthe only apparatus for anatomical study was a set of bones. When\r\nmedical officials had time to teach these boys they casually handed\r\nthem some practical work in the Hospital. Most of the nursing duties\r\nfell on their shoulders, as the Matron was the only trained nurse\r\nin Fiji. There was some improvement in 1900, when a lecture room\r\nwas built. Somewhat later improvements advanced as far as a wooden\r\nstudents’ quarters.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the students went on strike, which resulted in the improvements\r\nof 1900. As a body they called upon the officials and announced that\r\nthey wanted the whole-time services of a cook, otherwise they were\r\ngoing back home. The authorities concluded that they were probably\r\nhuman beings, so the point was carried. After several years the\r\neight-student school had turned out approximately twenty Native Medical\r\nPractitioners. These men were working for something like seven pounds\r\na year, all told, but they were given free gardens to cultivate for\r\nthemselves. They earned two pounds ten as Provincial Vaccinators, and\r\nin 1905 their salaries jumped to between eighteen pounds and fifty\r\npounds. Seven years later their usefulness was recognized by another\r\nincrease in salary; this time they were divided into first, second and\r\nthird class. A first-class N.M.P. was getting as much as one hundred\r\npounds a year. When the new School was opened, they were making around\r\none hundred and fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe products of this low-paid, rough-and-ready education won their\r\nspurs early. In the devastating influenza epidemic of 1918 three of\r\nthe old students died at their posts as dispensers in the Colonial\r\nHospital. Eight in all died, out of a total of forty-eight. In no case\r\nwas there any complaint that an N.M.P. had failed in his duty so long\r\nas he was able to lift a hand.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1928, a new order was coming to pass, I hoped. The door\r\nwas open, not too wide, but young men were passing through with a\r\nkeen desire to get the best that modern methods could give. That door\r\nwould have to swing wider. It mustn’t close again. Neither politics\r\nnor prejudice nor indifference must slam it shut in the faces of those\r\nwho had come so earnestly to learn. I was canny enough to suspect that\r\nthere would be the same percentage of failures you will find in any\r\ncollege anywhere--ten following years of experience taught me that the\r\naverage was less. They had something more than the desire to get on\r\nin the world, which inspires so many European professional students.\r\nThat December evening I talked with several of the incoming class, the\r\nboys who were not too shy to speak out. Why did they want to go into\r\nmedicine? The answer I got from them was usually the same: “Because I\r\nwant to do something for my own people.”\r\n\r\nIt was about then that I pulled in my belt and promised myself that so\r\nlong as I was alive and in Fiji I wouldn’t let them down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nOLD BRANDY AND NEW EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst let’s try to peg the story down to the spring of 1931, when I put\r\na bottle of rare old brandy under my arm and went up a very New Yorkish\r\nelevator to see Mr. Raymond Fosdick. The brandy, worth its weight in\r\ngold, if you could price it at all, had been given to me in exchange\r\nfor three dozen fresh eggs.\r\n\r\nMr. Fosdick, as legal advisor to the Rockefellers, was also an\r\nimportant trustee of the Foundation, therefore my business with him was\r\nlegitimate. So was the brandy, although America was then in the throes\r\nof Amendment Eighteen.\r\n\r\nAs I waited outside his office I almost asked his amiable secretary if\r\nI hadn’t better smuggle the bottle under her desk and say nothing about\r\nit. I was conscious that Mr. Fosdick’s brother was the Reverend Harry\r\nEmerson Fosdick, pastor of Mr. Rockefeller’s great temple of sobriety\r\non Riverside Drive, and the Rockefeller family were honestly in favor\r\nof prohibition. And how about the big Rockefeller executive in his\r\noffice over there? Representative of a great temperance family, brother\r\nof a great preacher.... No, I had better hide that bottle somewhere....\r\n\r\nThen his secretary said “Dr. Lambert,” meaning me, so I picked up the\r\nbottle and went into his office. I had been told that I would meet one\r\nof the most charming men on earth, and I wasn’t disappointed. But our\r\nconversation hadn’t gone very far before I noticed his eyes straying\r\ntoward the wrapped bottle I was holding in my lap; he was wondering,\r\nI suppose, if South Sea doctors always carried their own liquor.\r\nMaybe I was getting off on the wrong foot, but something had to be\r\ndone. I pulled off the wrapper and handed him the brandy. I began, “I\r\ndon’t know how you stand on prohibition. This happens to be rare old\r\nstuff--but if you have any prejudices--”\r\n\r\n“Prejudices!” He stared at the faded label. “It’s 1835! Yes, I have\r\nprejudices--in its favor.” Relieved, I said, “Well, it’s for the black\r\nsheep of the Fosdick family.”\r\n\r\nStill nursing the bottle, he laughed, “My brother Harry is so strict\r\nI have to balance the ship. Now let me uncover a family skeleton. My\r\ngreat-grandfather was a distiller before he became a preacher. His\r\ndistillery failed because he endorsed bad notes for friends, so he\r\nturned to the Baptist pulpit for consolation. In those days they had\r\nhigh pulpits with a steep stairway in the back. My ancestor used to\r\nkeep a bottle under those stairs, and before sermons he would brace\r\nhimself with a couple of good spots; then he would mount the ladder\r\nand give his congregation and the distillers hellfire for two solid\r\nhours.... No, Doctor, I don’t mind your telling all about the family.\r\nI’ve often said to Brother Harry that it would be a good thing for him\r\nif he imitated the old gentleman. But Harry seldom listens to my wiser\r\nsuggestions.”\r\n\r\nThe brandy perched on the desk like a silent diplomat, opening the\r\nway to confidences. Mr. Fosdick had studied at Colgate when I was at\r\nHamilton, and when I told him that I was on the team that knocked the\r\nliving perfume out of Colgate our entente was established. He asked\r\nabout progress over my six million square miles of sea. Maybe he had\r\nread my reports, but there were so many reports blowing in from all\r\npoints that I sought briefly to refresh his memory. With education and\r\ntetrachloride, I said, the hookworm disease was getting under control\r\nand populations were on the upgrade, where the High Commission and the\r\nFoundation had a free hand. Wherever we worked with the New Zealand\r\nhealth authorities we got fine results. We expected the Cook Island\r\nnatives would show an increase of 20 per cent in the decade between\r\n1926 and 1936. The Mau Rebellion had set back New Zealand’s work in\r\nWestern Samoa, but they were making good headway again, the Foundation\r\ndoing its share. The awful Condominium was still making a mess of the\r\nNew Hebrides; and the Australians--well, they weren’t playing ball.\r\n\r\nThe Central Medical School had graduated two classes, but without the\r\nthorough curriculum which the new students would have. Soon we would\r\nbe able to throw more well-educated N.M.P.’s into the work.... I am\r\nnot sure that Mr. Fosdick remembered our little School at all. Fiji\r\nis a long way from lower Broadway. When he had commended our modest\r\nproject, a few years before, he had thought of it as romantic; yet\r\nwhen he fixed his signature to the plan, buried among the vaster\r\nprojects, it was one of the most fruitful acts of all his useful life.\r\nMany Rockefeller millions, for instance, had gone into the great school\r\nin Peking, and into field work in China. Five or six years later the\r\nSino-Japanese war blasted away those handsome contributions. The little\r\nschool at Suva was destined to grow steadily and bear an annual crop of\r\ntrained native talent.\r\n\r\nI told him that our work was now directed toward mass treatments for\r\nboth cure and prevention. The big, shaggy Solomon Islands were black\r\nspots in the Pacific which we were doing our best to penetrate with\r\nmodern medicine, and with what few responsible white men we could find.\r\nThey were injecting thousands with neoarsphenamine, for yaws, dosing\r\nthousands with tetrachloride and tetrachlorethylene for hookworm. I\r\nhad made a short survey of the Solomons in 1921 and later on, through\r\nMontague, had started things going that way. I had visited there\r\nagain in 1930 and this trip had taken me at last to the lost Rennell\r\nIsland.... I tried to tell him about Rennell Island, small as a mustard\r\nseed in a pond, yet unique in all the world because it was inhabited by\r\na people who were 20,000 years behind our modern times....\r\n\r\nI told him of two of our excellent men, working in the more attainable\r\nSolomon Islands--if anything down there is “attainable.” Gordon White\r\nand Dr. Steenson were outstanding. White was an Australian small doctor\r\nmade over from a pharmacist, and he was doing wonders with the hardest\r\nassignment in the world, “blackfellow treatment.” Dr. Steenson was a\r\nscientist of large caliber, although physically he was about vestpocket\r\nsize. The Dean of the New Zealand Medical School knew what he was about\r\nwhen he recommended Steenson to me.\r\n\r\nThese men would send me their journals, written from the field when\r\nthey worked up and down the double chain of six or seven big, wild\r\nislands. There were plantations and missions around the edges, but the\r\ninteriors were usually inhabited by unregenerate killers. Malaita,\r\nfor instance, was a little larger than Long Island, and twice as\r\ntough. When black Malaitamen worked on the plantations they had to\r\nbe carefully watched; they had a nasty habit of turning on their\r\nstraw-boss. No Malaitaman ranked as a true male until he had killed\r\nhis man. There was the case in 1927 which newspapers played up as\r\n“The Malaita Murders.” Captain Bell, a tax collector, with his white\r\nassistant and fourteen native police, fell under massed spear-points,\r\nand when the guilty ones were tried for murder they made no attempt to\r\ndeny anything. Hill-grown Malaitamen don’t know how to lie. Somebody\r\nhad “sent” them to do murder--a witch doctor, most likely. Without a\r\nsign of fear they walked up to the hangman.\r\n\r\nDr. Steenson had drawn a very accurate map of Malaita, in four colors.\r\nThe colors, he explained, had been made for him by mission boys, out\r\nof plant juices. He and White both carried phonographs, and when\r\npatients came in too slowly the white medicine men would turn on stale\r\nmusic-hall pieces. “Show Me the Way to Go Home” was a favorite. Mission\r\nboys learned it, formed male quartets and butchered the tune horribly,\r\nfar into the night. Malaitamen loved the needle--sick or well, they\r\ndemanded it. But on adjacent islands they would run and hide, scared\r\nto death of it. When audiences failed to show up the interpreter would\r\nsay, “Big kaikai”--whether they were eating men or pigs was never\r\nrevealed. Earthquakes were a commonplace, leaf houses tumbling, young\r\nparrots falling out of the trees, natives scrambling under a barrage\r\nof coconuts. Lollipops were always in demand; stalwart warriors would\r\nwait for a dole of candy before they would talk business. Sometimes a\r\nnative, who had never been near a treatment, would curl up and die of\r\na heart attack or gallstone colic or whatever ailed him. Invariably\r\nhis fellow tribesmen would blame the death on “stick medicine,”\r\nhypodermics, and it would take a wealth of diplomacy to argue them\r\ndown. This situation was never less than dangerous. Steenson carried\r\nhis Bible with him, and on Sunday mornings, when the missions enforced\r\nleisure, he would open it at Genesis and pull out a file of papers\r\nentitled “Yaws Campaign Notes.” He wrote me: “There is one thing\r\nin this Bible with which I do not agree. I refer to a sentence in\r\n‘The Equipment and Working of a Yaws Unit (Samoan Experience).’” Dr.\r\nSteenson was basically religious.\r\n\r\nQuaint letters came from native mission teachers, White and Steenson\r\nsent them to me as comic bits: “_My deer friend Dr. Steenson_, I am\r\nDavid Ikala write this letter to you, about all your boys, on this\r\nnight, you put Goaril to look after all your things, now behind you he\r\nwent down to Raresu, he going on Mother’s house and he do a trouble\r\nthere, he catch hold the girls.... And another time he brake the roof\r\nof there house....”\r\n\r\nThis letter was signed “With a great love.”\r\n\r\nIt was a horse of a darker color when surreptitious notes were slipped\r\ninto Gordon White’s hand, saying, “Don’t go down to Wanderer Bay,”\r\nand telling how the natives there were waiting to club the white men.\r\nGordon White wrote casually, “Wherever I go the local lads come along\r\nwith their various relations, and there is no sign of trouble or\r\ndiscontent.”\r\n\r\nWhite had the services of Charlie One Arm, the policeman, who with his\r\nsingle arm could knock out all comers. Charlie’s maxim was “Treat ’em\r\nrough.” Around mission stations he would shock the pious by shouting\r\nto women who wouldn’t take their medicine, “Listen, you sunnabitch\r\nfellow!” But when I read White’s reports of threatening letters I saw\r\nMontague; we had White, Steenson and Charlie One Arm moved to safer,\r\ntamer ground. We couldn’t afford to have another Malaita murder....\r\n\r\nGordon White rounded off his report by telling how a flock of\r\nnaked cannibals, well armed with clubs and spears, swarmed down\r\nand surrounded his tent. Had they come to finish him off? No, it\r\nturned out, they were bearing gifts. Gordon wrote, “The Malaitaman\r\ngenerally wants as much as he can get for anything he has to dispose\r\nof, and giving things away he looks on as sheer madness. But here\r\nthey were showering me with presents, and with no apparent strings on\r\nthem--cowrie shells, kai-kai spoons, a bow and a few arrows, a basket\r\nof fruit, and a middle aged rooster--I should say about forty-five.”\r\nJust a little tribute to modern medicine, and no flowery speeches;\r\nsolemnly the Malaitamen strode back to their jungle....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI did not tell all this to Mr. Fosdick, a busy man on a busy day. But\r\nI had time to outline enough of it to hint at the problems we had\r\nto face among the howling pagans of the Solomon Islands, where the\r\nmissionaries, good, bad and confused, were merely nibbling around the\r\nedges. Tuberculosis was prevalent in the Solomons, and we expected to\r\ntackle it on a grand scale when there were more N.M.P.’s.\r\n\r\nBefore we shook hands Raymond Fosdick asked: “But what about this\r\nwonderful 1835 brandy? Is it so easy down there to get hold of such\r\nrare stuff?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” I said, “if you find the right man. I got four bottles of it\r\nin exchange for three dozen strictly fresh eggs.”\r\n\r\nThen I told him how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nANOTHER ISLAND NIGHT’S ENTERTAINMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in 1930, shortly before I broached the egg-and-brandy riddle to\r\nMr. Fosdick, the beautiful yacht _Zaca_ pulled in at Suva. Templeton\r\nCrocker, who had inherited richly from banks and mines in California,\r\nwas taking friends on a world cruise. He had a thirst for anthropology\r\nand scientific exploration, and it was rumored that he might later\r\nequip his fine ship for research in far places. I am afraid my sigh\r\nwas a bit envious as I watched the _Zaca_ steam gracefully in. I had\r\nscoured the southern seas in so many tubs, junks, bumboats, leaky\r\nlaunches and cockroach-ridden steamers that my bones ached at the very\r\nthought of them. Crocker’s explorations were _de luxe_; most of mine\r\nhad been _de louse_.\r\n\r\nTempleton Crocker came to my office, a well-favored man in his late\r\nforties, pleasant and almost boyishly anxious to learn. He seemed\r\nmuch impressed because I was just back from Rennell Island and its\r\nlittle neighbor, Bellona. Did they come up to my expectations? Yes, I\r\nsaid, when you fly to the moon you may be sure it will come up to your\r\nexpectations. His curiosity was on edge; had I taken notes, could he\r\nsee some of them? I handed him a small batch of rough dictation, not\r\nenough to tell him all by any means. I could see by his excitement that\r\nRennell Island had the same pull on his imagination that it had had on\r\nmine all the eight years that I had awaited an opportunity to see it.\r\n\r\nWhen we dined on the _Zaca_ the owner showed me around and explained\r\nthat she was an enlarged “bluenose.” The main dining room was also\r\nthe lounge, but the Crocker party ate mostly on deck, tropical style.\r\nEverything was roomy, the cabins plain but comfortable, equipped with\r\nelectric lights and fans. Gus Schmidt, who managed the galley, was\r\na real chef, and there were quantities of refrigerators to help him\r\nout. The ship carried what they called “frozen foods”--Idaho steaks,\r\nLong Island duck, fresh peas and strawberries--about all the luxuries\r\nfor which we tropicals were hungry. Crocker had a plentiful supply of\r\nwines, used with judgment; when there was an occasion for it he could\r\nsurprise you with a rare vintage.\r\n\r\nHe was at our house a great deal, always asking about Rennell Island.\r\nWhen he didn’t dine with us he dropped in for a rum cocktail. We played\r\nbridge, and I was surprised to find that he was making money; a rare\r\nfeat in Suva, where the game is sharp as a razor blade. When we dined\r\non the _Zaca_ my inner mind kept exclaiming, “Think of following a\r\nhealth campaign on a ship like this!”\r\n\r\nThe night before his boat sailed he came around with my notes; I knew\r\nhe couldn’t have made much out of them, the stuff was so scrambled.\r\nAt dinner I complimented him on the _Zaca’s_ cook, and he said the\r\ngreat trouble was getting fresh eggs. On the _Zaca’s_ long hauls even\r\nrefrigeration wouldn’t keep them fresh. I mentioned doing something\r\nabout it--then Eloisa gave me the matrimonial look. Wherever Eloisa\r\nsettled down, she started to raise chickens; she had a way with\r\nchickens.\r\n\r\nBut on Crocker’s mind there was something heavier than an egg. It was\r\nRennell Island, I knew before he had said a word. Finally he said,\r\n“I wish you would tell me all about that trip.” He and I were having\r\ncoffee on the veranda, and I said, “You remember that girl of the\r\nArabian Nights who had to tell the sultan a story between dark and\r\ndawn--or else? Well, we’d better have a fresh pot of coffee, because\r\nthis story is going to be pretty long.”\r\n\r\n“I can stand it,” he said, and waited for me to begin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLast May [I said] I was in Tulagi, capital of the Solomon Islands,\r\nlooking over our health campaign. I don’t have to tell you how long I\r\nhad waited for a chance to see Rennell Island; and mine wasn’t all an\r\nexplorer’s curiosity. When George Fulton told me, back in 1920, that\r\nthe Rennellese were “practically untouched” I had wondered if these\r\nseemingly archaic people were infected with one of the known varieties\r\nof hookworm. Or if they were infected at all, would it be a variety\r\nhitherto undiscovered? If so, I might be able to furnish valuable data\r\non the origin of a race that had been so long lost to the world.\r\n\r\nFrom inquiry and general reading I knew that Rennell Island, and its\r\ntiny companion Bellona, had been visited in the past; but those visits\r\nwere few and far between, even in the Pacific sense of the term. Some\r\nsailors might have penetrated to the interior. Two brave bishops,\r\nSelwyn and Patterson, touched there in 1856, and fifty years later\r\nC. M. Woodford and A. G. Stephens had made geological surveys around\r\nthe shore. Dr. Northcote Deck, of the South Sea Evangelists, visited\r\nseveral times with a companion missioner, between 1908 and 1911; Deck\r\nmade a gory mess of proselytizing. Resident Commissioner Kane, on his\r\nofficial inspection of 1925, might have been the first white man that\r\never went into the interior. A few years before that, the powerful\r\nLever Brothers had “recruited” some labor from offshore; but the\r\nnatives were so unresistant to disease that the recruiters had decided\r\nto take back the ones who survived. In 1928 Stanley and Hogbin made a\r\ngeological survey for the High Commission, and reported that they had\r\nfound absolutely nothing of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe next year the Whitney South Sea Expedition went there collecting\r\nbirds for New York’s Natural History Museum. The young men from this\r\nexpedition, on its second trip, were the ones who brought me into the\r\nstory. Rennell lay only 150 miles to the southeast of Tulagi; it was\r\nhard to realize that it was so near, or that in 1930 one could turn\r\nback the book of mankind’s history for thousands of years and read the\r\nliving page; that the voyager of today might thrill as Captain Cook\r\nthrilled when he first saw a Pacific island.\r\n\r\nWell, I talked about Rennell to Captain Ashley, Resident Commissioner\r\nat Tulagi, and he offered to take me there on his next cruise. He’d\r\nhave to drop me on the beach and pick me up when his yacht swung around\r\nthat way again. But Rennell Island wasn’t very safe for strangers, he\r\nsaid. A few years ago when Dr. Deck of the South Sea Evangelists had\r\nsent three native missionaries there the Rennellese had killed them\r\noff; eaten them, probably, for nobody ever found the bodies. No, the\r\nsafest way to see Rennell would be behind an armed guard.\r\n\r\nTime was precious and there was no telling when Captain Ashley’s boat\r\nwould take a notion to come. Then I saw a stout but battered little\r\nauxiliary schooner lying offshore. It looked like a turn of Providence,\r\nfor she was the same _France_ that had taken the Whitney Expedition to\r\nRennell three years before. A crowd of young men came ashore, looking\r\nmore like hoboes than naturalists. Their leader was Hannibal Hamlin,\r\ngrandson of Lincoln’s Vice President, and an old Yale football player.\r\nI pricked up my ears when Hamlin said that they were heading the\r\n_France_ for Rennell Island again, if they could make it. My ears stood\r\nhigher still when he said that he was the second white man, perhaps, to\r\nhave gone inland as far as the Lake.\r\n\r\nI wasted no time, you can well believe, in asking them what dicker I\r\ncould make to go along. Hamlin showed true American generosity. They\r\nwere indebted to Captain Ashley for a lot of things, and if I was his\r\nfriend they’d do anything to oblige me; only trouble was the Whitney\r\nExpedition backers hadn’t come across with their check. They were out\r\nof provisions. All right, said I, provisions and trade were on me.\r\nLet’s take them on and get started. At the Burns-Phillip Store Hamlin\r\ntook on some very odd supplies, including a great number of adzes,\r\nhatchets and trade knives with wooden handles and blades six inches\r\nlong. When I asked him if we were going to use them on the savages he\r\nsaid, “No, but that’s what they’ll want.” I could understand the jumble\r\nof cheap mirrors and scissors. When he called for calico and beads\r\nhe always asked for red. Why red? “That’s the color they’ll want,”\r\nhe said, and started dickering for three pasteboard trade boxes with\r\nflimsy locks.\r\n\r\nOur only stop was at Gaudalcanar where Gordon White was heading one\r\nof my Solomon Islands treatment units. He was an especially valuable\r\naddition to the party, as he had been to Rennell Island on the Stanley\r\nExpedition, two years before. On this trip he was to act as my\r\nmicroscopist.\r\n\r\nWe were a careless, happy company, getting dirtier every hour. We had\r\nwith us a youngish German named Walter--I can’t remember the rest of\r\nit--who was a shell collector and looked the part. Our skipper was an\r\nancient Scot, sour with religion. Gordon White had brought on three\r\nSolomon Island attendants, and he lent me a very black one named Ga’a,\r\nfour feet high, aged fourteen, and proud as Punch to be serving a white\r\ngentleman. Service consisted mostly in opening tinned food and throwing\r\nthe empty tins overboard--or letting them roll. The main cabin was\r\nso small that you couldn’t stretch without banging your elbows; here\r\nwe ate amidst fumes from the engine. We only used the engine in dead\r\ncalm, when it could make four miles an hour. We had a small lavatory\r\nand a shower, neither of which worked. I was more than grateful to\r\nmy companions when they allotted me--out of respect to my superior\r\ngirth--the largest berth on the ship. It was right off the cabin, and\r\nthere was no privacy. But privacy was a stranger to the _France_.\r\n\r\nThere was a place for nothing, and nothing in its place. Walter the\r\nGerman strewed shells, Hamlin and Coultas stuffed birds and scattered\r\nfeathers so that some of them always managed to get into the stew. Our\r\nnative deck-hands slept in places where you couldn’t help stumbling\r\nover them. Gordon White, when he wasn’t trying to find where he had\r\nstowed his microscopic outfit, turned on the phonograph and shouted.\r\n\r\nWe were on our way to Rennell Island--maybe. And just another touch\r\nto our oddity: We had a stumpy black Hercules who helped the cook by\r\nspilling soup, waited on table by dropping dishes, cleaned the cabin by\r\npushing the dirt across into another corner. He was an ebony figure of\r\nthe Masculine. And his name was Bella.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the report came that we would reach our destination next day\r\nI began looking into the physical condition of all aboard. If the\r\nRennellese were as primitive as I had heard, any introduced germ would\r\ncatch like wild fire, and we might spread a scourge. Harry, our Solomon\r\nIsland cook, had developed a nasty eye condition; he was a spectacle\r\nin the galley, with that dirty rag over his eye. White and I treated\r\nhim and he began to improve. Still I was worried, wondering how his\r\ninfection would react on the people we were about to visit.\r\n\r\nI looked them all over. There were no common colds, and that was\r\nsatisfactory. How about that quick-moving venereal contagion,\r\ngonorrhea? To the embarrassment of some, and the merriment of many,\r\nI lined them all up, from black crew to white captain, and gave them\r\nwhat the Army calls “short-arm inspection.” They were all negative.\r\nSatisfactory again. Also there were no visible signs of skin infection.\r\nWe seemed to be, all told, a very healthy lot.\r\n\r\nThen I got my thrill when Hamlin called me on deck, pointed over the\r\nbow and said, “There she is!” It lay isolated in the sea. I saw a\r\nstraight line of cliff, sheer as a prison wall, lifted some 400 feet\r\nand running as far as the eye could travel. Scraggly foliage showed\r\nfaintly at the top. What except an airplane could get anybody up there?\r\n\r\nHamlin, all out of patience, told me that there was only one dent in\r\nthe cliff, a narrow passage called Kungava Bay, the “White Sands.”\r\nIf the Scotch skipper hadn’t been so stubborn we could have sailed\r\nstraight into it. As it was that day was gone and most of the next\r\nbefore we made our final tack and found the opening in the cliffs which\r\nmarked Rennell’s only landing place, a pin-point approach to an island\r\nthat was fifty miles long and some fifteen wide. Those guardian cliffs\r\nwere relics of a strange volcanic action which pushed the Pacific’s\r\nlargest atoll into high prominence. The island was so tightly ringed\r\nwith a collar of coral-stone that Sinbad himself could not have found\r\nthe entrance without a chart. Fortunately Hamlin had one which his\r\nnavigator on the former trip had made for him.\r\n\r\nWe shot through the reef and found anchorage inside a beautiful,\r\nsheltered bay; it was especially serene because the cliffs protected\r\nit on two sides; below their impressive height the beach curved like a\r\nwhite necklace. Things began to move. Two rudely built outrigger canoes\r\ncame paddling up to us, and I got my first glimpse of these strange\r\npeople. There were two men, a woman and a couple of small boys. They\r\nwere not like anything I had ever seen before, and I remembered what\r\nFulton had said: “About twenty thousand years behind modern history.”\r\nAt the risk of being trite, let me say that the men, very tall and\r\nhandsomely muscled, had the figures of Greek gods. Around the loins\r\nthey were swaddled in folds of clumsy tapa (_kongoa_), made grotesque\r\nby a palm-leaf fan stuck in the back. The fans, I learned later, were\r\nfor protecting the hair when it rained, or for brushing away flies when\r\nit shone. Their heads were impressive, dark as to hair and brows, and\r\nwith strong, well-modeled features. Their hair, almost straight, was\r\ncoiled in a bun at the back. Their dark, expressive eyes were somewhat\r\nslanting, but not Mongoloid fashion, more like the American Indians’.\r\nAlthough they wore small tortoise-shell ornaments stuck through the\r\nseptum, their noses were slenderly arched. There was nothing negroid\r\nabout their gracefully cut mouths. What were they like? Somehow you\r\ncouldn’t call them either Polynesian or Caucasian. Yet there was\r\nsomething indefinitely Caucasian in their features.\r\n\r\nThe woman was shorter, nude save for a long strip of tapa, bound so\r\ntightly around her hips that it seemed to hold her legs together.\r\nThose legs were her imperfection, for they were short, stocky and\r\nknock-kneed. I wondered if this peculiarity, which I saw later in\r\nthe majority of the women here, had something to do with the tight\r\nbinding of the thighs. Or was it an occupational distortion, caused\r\nby carrying heavy loads? In the Kuni dwarfs of Papua I have remarked\r\non another sort of occupational distortion--they were pigeon-breasted\r\nand duck-footed from climbing hills all their lives. This Rennellese\r\nwife, like the man, was well tattooed except for her face and back The\r\ndesigns seemed to be all in the same pattern.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly gotten aboard before they were all over the ship,\r\nprying into everything, handling everything, including ourselves.\r\nDelicate, dirty fingers felt of our shirts, felt of the buttons on\r\nour shorts, patted us all over to see if these strange beings were\r\nreal. One of the small boys patted my stomach, not satirically, but in\r\nadmiring surprise that it could be so big. One of the men went into the\r\ngalley where he tunked the tin pans and chuckled strange words in a\r\ndialect which was not quite Polynesian.\r\n\r\nHamlin and I went down the ladder to look at their canoes, strange\r\nhulks gnawed from thick logs--gnawed is the word, for they had been\r\nhollowed out in the most primitive possible way.\r\n\r\nHamlin said, “Yes, they char the wood and hack it with shells. But\r\nthese canoes are better made than the ones I saw before. I gave them\r\nsome hatchets, and they’re working with them. They’re crazy to get iron\r\nand steel. They’ll do anything for it, give you anything they’ve got,\r\nand that isn’t much--mostly women.”\r\n\r\nBack on deck I saw the woman making up to Bella, the cook’s powerful\r\nhelper. There was danger ahead, I feared. Not the danger of being\r\nclubbed to death, as they had clubbed the mission teachers; but the\r\ntrouble that comes to any island visitor when crews go ashore to\r\n“refresh.”\r\n\r\nThe people who had come aboard spoke a little queer pidgin English,\r\njust a word here and there which they had picked up God knows where.\r\nThey didn’t know much of it, for when we first spoke to them they\r\nreturned a polite, blank stare. Then the woman saw an empty beer\r\nbottle, and said “Me want,” in a pretty, husky contralto. But when we\r\ntried more pidgin on her she was dumb. “What does she want with an\r\nempty beer bottle?” I asked Hamlin, and he explained, “The men break\r\nthem up to shave with. Until beer bottles came the older men were all\r\nbearded. The young bucks pulled ’em out by using clam shells, like\r\ntweezers. I guess you could buy the island for a dozen razor blades.”\r\n\r\nThen a few more canoes straggled out to let men, women and children\r\nclamber aboard, to make themselves at home. They had never heard of\r\nprivacy. Why should they have heard of it? They were the primitives\r\nof primitives, therefore naïvely communistic. They poked their\r\nfingers into every hole in the main cabin, turned up our mattresses\r\nand wondered what they were, tried to find out why locked boxes and\r\ncupboards wouldn’t open. Occasionally they would slip some small thing\r\nlike a shoelace or a beer-bottle cap into their tapa sashes. A few of\r\nthe girls could say, “Me want knifie,” putting a caress into their\r\nvoices as they handled our shirt collars. Late that night unmistakable\r\nsounds from the crew’s quarters indicated that some local beauties had\r\nremained to earn a knife or bottle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Here I paused to give Templeton Crocker the last cup of coffee in the\r\npot. Then I went on.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we were at meals they’d leave us alone--and that was the only\r\ntime, why I don’t know. Right after dinner or breakfast they’d be back.\r\nWe tried to play cards, but with beautiful torsos pressing against\r\nour shoulders, backs and arms, it was hard to concentrate.... Two new\r\narrivals came into the cabin, and Hamlin recognized a friend of his\r\nformer trip. He got up and rubbed noses solemnly with a bright-eyed,\r\nnuggety little fellow, whose look was quick with intelligence. “This\r\nis Buia of Kanava,” Hamlin said, and then of the taller, younger one,\r\n“he’s named Buia too. He’s Buia the Bastard. Buia of Kanava is heir to\r\none of the Big Masters--that’s what they call their chiefs here--and he\r\nspeaks a little pidgin.”\r\n\r\nAt once I decided that Buia of Kanava should be my very own for the\r\nduration of the trip. His pidgin was quite bad, but intelligible. When\r\nI asked him how he learned it, he said the Japanese sailors had taught\r\nhim. He was a progressive spirit, far beyond the island average. One\r\nday he had swum out to a Japanese pearler, lying offshore, and offered\r\nhis services for a trip of a few hundred miles. He was there to learn\r\nthe white man’s ways; Japanese or Swedes were all the same to him.\r\n\r\nTo bind his service securely I took Buia to my cabin and laid an\r\noffering out on my berth; an adze, a hatchet, a trade-knife with a\r\nsix-inch blade and one of the pasteboard lock-boxes Hamlin had been\r\nforesighted enough to buy. He gazed, dumb with fascination; he was\r\nlike Aladdin at first sight of the jewel-filled cave. “Belong me?”\r\nhe murmured. Yes, they were all for him, _if_ he would be goodfellow\r\nboy, show me everything and tell me everything. When I got a key and\r\nopened the box Buia was mine for a lifetime, if I wanted him that long.\r\nI replaced the treasures in a cupboard, but every afternoon while we\r\nwere on the island he would appear in my cabin and beseech me to let\r\nhim look at them again. I would lay them out on the berth and watch him\r\ngloat, rubbing his hands. He would be a very rich man.\r\n\r\nBy piecing Buia’s words together I gained some knowledge of a religious\r\nand social structure which had only moved forward a third of the\r\ndistance from the Glacial Period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBuia told me that Rennell Island was divided into five districts, each\r\nruled by a kingly chief called a Big Master. The two most powerful Big\r\nMasters were Tahua, Lord of the White Sands, and Taupangi, Lord of the\r\nLake--the lake was Tenggano, lying in the center of the island. The\r\npeople did not worship images and they had few devils. They adored\r\nan unseen God (Big Master Walk along Sky, according to pidgin). The\r\nBig Masters were the most powerful because God lived in their heads.\r\n(“God does _what_?” I asked.) God lived in their heads, Buia insisted\r\nearnestly; so they were wiser and stronger than other men. Once a\r\nyear, at the harvest festival up by the Lake, Tahua and Taupangi could\r\nwish God to leave their heads, just for the period, and dwell behind\r\nthe brows of some chosen subordinate. Then the subordinates were very\r\nstrong and wise, but God always came back to the Big Masters. The\r\nharvest festival was being celebrated right now, Buia said, and that\r\nwas why Big Master Tahua was not on the White Sands.\r\n\r\nThen Buia came out with a scandal which somewhat alarmed me for the\r\nfuture of these “untouched” people. It was a real-estate deal with more\r\nof Hollywood’s flavor than Rennell’s. Probably the five big chiefs were\r\ndescendants of five sons of the early conquerors, and Taupangi, Lord of\r\nthe Lake, was of the eldest line; at least he was the most powerful.\r\nOnce he ruled both the Lake and the White Sands; but the beach looked\r\nuseless to him. Perhaps God told Tahua of Kanava that beach property\r\nhad a future. At any rate Taupangi was induced to give Tahua temporary\r\nuse of the White Sands, but when he saw vessels anchoring there, with\r\ngood trading in iron, Taupangi realized his mistake and ordered Tahua\r\nout. This started a war, and the enterprising Tahua must have won it,\r\nfor when we got there he was well established as Lord of the White\r\nSands.\r\n\r\nThe yams on the Lake were small and poor, but the beach was a different\r\nmatter. Iron was gold. Iron would put Rennell on its feet. Rennell had\r\ngirls, the incoming ships had knives, axes, scrap iron. With a corner\r\non iron Tahua could become master of the Big Masters.\r\n\r\nAs a public health physician I didn’t like the sound of this. Trading\r\nlove for iron was going to work havoc with these natives, unless this\r\nform of commercialism was soon discouraged.\r\n\r\nSince the main object of my visit was to look into hookworm infection,\r\nif it existed, and to study the nature of the parasite which, if they\r\nhad it, must have been borne by their ancestors generations before\r\nthe dawn of our modern history, it was necessary to use Buia as a\r\ngo-between. If he could get it through his head that we were here to\r\nexamine feces specimens, he could explain it to his people. But after\r\ntwo patient hours of careful pidgin I saw that I was making no headway.\r\nBuia simply didn’t understand what I wanted. I had been using the lingo\r\nalmost daily for thirteen years, and had never before had such trouble\r\nin making myself clear. Then it dawned upon me that it wasn’t entirely\r\nthe man’s faulty knowledge of pidgin. He had no conception of disease,\r\nas we view it. All sickness was punishment from their offended god,\r\npenalizing the evildoer. That was the only reaction that I got from him\r\nafter steady pegging away. Finally we changed the subject.\r\n\r\nGordon White and three boys went ashore and erected a tent and fly\r\nwhere we could go properly to work on our examinations. Walking along\r\nthe sparkling beach I was surprised to find only one house, such as\r\nit was, a leaf-building with a steep-sloping roof, eaves that almost\r\ntouched the ground and no doors. But where did the people sleep? In\r\ncaves? On the bare ground, with the rain sifting over them? When I knew\r\nthem better I found that was what they did.\r\n\r\nI got around to the subject of murder, for I never quite forgot Dr.\r\nDeck’s three murdered evangelists. I asked Buia what he would do if\r\nsomebody tried to kill him. “Who would want to kill me?” he asked,\r\nsurprised. Suppose somebody should steal his land? “But who would want\r\nto steal my land?” Then I got around to Mr. Deck’s slain teachers;\r\nRennell people had certainly killed them--and I had heard that they had\r\neaten them, too. Buia’s face clouded. “Those mission boys were very\r\nbad fellows. They asked our people to build them a house, and when the\r\nwork did not suit those mission people they were very cross. They gave\r\nno presents although they were rich. So our people killed them.” And\r\nate the bodies? “No!” Indignantly. “My people have never eaten men. It\r\nis not the fashion.” I knew he was telling the truth. Cannibalism might\r\nbe like many another curse, imported. The Rennellese had never acquired\r\na taste for long pig, or for pig of any kind. Their diet was simple in\r\nthe extreme: the small variety of fruit and vegetables they could grow,\r\nwhat fish their clumsy wooden hooks could bring in, what birds their\r\narrows reached. They ate just one thing at a meal. If it was fish, it\r\nwas fish and nothing else. If it was yams, it was yams alone.\r\n\r\nThere were many things they couldn’t understand, but their bright minds\r\nwere quick to learn. Our ornithologists were out for specimens, and\r\nHamlin had given a few native boys their first lessons with a shotgun,\r\nhalf an hour’s target practice on the rare birds flying about. Then he\r\nhad casually handed guns to the boys and told them to go to it. They\r\ncame back loaded with feathery game. What was still more wonderful was\r\nthat nobody had shot himself in the foot.\r\n\r\nSo I sat down at my typewriter to write a report, something that\r\ncouldn’t be done in sociable Kungava Bay. The boat was swarming. Native\r\nheroes and their women had gone into about everything on board, and\r\nwere helping themselves rather freely. It was neither politic nor\r\npolite to offend these charming people by telling them to go home and\r\nstay there until they were invited. As a counter-attraction I had set\r\nthe phonograph up in the bow and ordered little Ga’a to keep the needle\r\ngoing till it wore out. The ghost-music attracted part of the crowd\r\npart of the time, but they always came back to me. The phonograph was\r\nall right as a miracle, but what really puzzled and charmed them was my\r\nportable typewriter.\r\n\r\nA baker’s dozen of the brown-skinned young things lolled over my\r\nshoulders, touching the keys as they flew, drawing their fingers over\r\nthe ribbon to see the ink come off. What was this strange box that made\r\nsuch straight tattoo marks across a very white sheet? Finally I gave\r\nup all pretense of working and called Buia. His eyes, like all the\r\nothers’, were fixed on my portable. He said that they all wanted to\r\nknow what I was doing. I told him that if he would push the girls back\r\na few inches I would try to show him. This machine, I said, made talk.\r\nThose things I was tattooing on the white sheet were words; if Buia\r\nwere to carry the sheet as far as the albatross flies, a man on the\r\nother end would just look at it and the words would talk to him. Buia’s\r\nbright eyes were standing out of his head as he murmured, “Me no sabe\r\ndis fellow talk.” “I’ll show you,” I said, and tick-tacked on a piece\r\nof paper, “_Hamlin, please give Buia a tin of cigarettes_.” I told what\r\nthe paper would say to Hamlin, and sent Buia below.\r\n\r\nPresently he staggered back, a tin of Chesterfields shuddering in his\r\nhand. Furtively he whispered the miracle to the huddled islanders. And\r\nit _was_ a miracle in a land where there had never been the slightest\r\ntrace of a written language, not even picture writing. In their excited\r\nfaces I saw a hungry eagerness to learn. Experimentally I lined them\r\nup, and as each one told me his name or hers I would typewrite it and\r\nhave the bearer take it down to a man in the engineroom, who would read\r\nit out to them. This game lasted until my fingers were tired of hitting\r\nthe keyboard. Some of them tried to help me; mischievous fingers\r\nwould poke at random, and the ship would be a gale of rough contralto\r\nlaughter when a key flew up and struck the paper.\r\n\r\nThat night I wrestled with Buia again over the subject of hookworm.\r\nCarefully I told him of the snake that hung to the human intestine and\r\nsent its eggs out with the bowel motion. In my jungle campaigns I had\r\ninformed the most backward and savage Melanesians that they had “senake\r\nin bel’” which their witch doctors could not cure because they only\r\nremoved the ghost of a snake, but we could fetch the real thing. I had\r\nworked in safety among tough cannibals and found that they were afraid\r\nto attack a man who could do such magic.\r\n\r\nI thought that my detailed explanation had at last got under Buia’s\r\nskin. He was politely impressed, and I felt sure that he would act as\r\nmy friend and interpreter tomorrow when I would begin the delicate work\r\nof collecting specimens of feces.\r\n\r\nNext morning Gordon White and I went to the beach with our microscope\r\nand little tin containers; the first thing I did was to give a\r\ncontainer to Buia, and ask him if he remembered what I had told\r\nhim. Now Buia seemed unable to understand. Gordon White came to my\r\nrescue and said, “Doctor, I’ll go and demonstrate to these bastards,\r\npersonally.” With Buia and a retinue of small boys he retired into the\r\nbushes. Silence. Then a perfect bedlam of frightened yells. Small boys\r\ncame scampering out, hands in air, mouths open, screaming. And Buia\r\nfollowed the panicky retreat. They ran as though a mad dog were after\r\nthem, nipping.\r\n\r\nAt last Gordon came out, dejectedly holding a tin. “When I put the\r\nspecimen in and closed the lid,” he said, “they stared as if they were\r\naccusing me of an atrocious crime.” The natives of the beach kept away\r\nfrom us for a bad half-hour; we were isolated among a lot of savages\r\nwho had interpreted our well meant attempt as the grossest insult.\r\nThese men carried spears and clubs; we knew how they dealt with those\r\nwho offended them. Whether or not they had eaten Deck’s missioners was\r\nonly of academic importance. What happens after you’re dead doesn’t\r\nmatter much. The main thing was to keep alive....\r\n\r\nThen Buia came sidling back to our tent. His look was portentous. He\r\nsaid, “Master, dis fellow he something altogether tabu. Him he tabu too\r\nmuch. Suppose Big Master Tahua sabe something belong dis fashion, he\r\naltogether too bad along you fellow me fellow”--Meaning that if we went\r\non with our search for hookworm eggs Tahua would kill us all, including\r\nBuia. We heard the noise of people scrambling down the precipice. Buia\r\ntold us that they were from Lake Tenggano. And as we valued our lives,\r\nhe said, we mustn’t even hint at what happened in the bushes. Otherwise\r\nterrible things would befall us for breaking their tabu.\r\n\r\nWell, there we were, on the third day, absolutely bunkered on the main\r\nobject of our trip. When I went back to the _France_, feeling that my\r\ninvestment had turned out a total loss, I found the people of the Lake\r\nswarming over everything, and among them a grandee of the White Sands,\r\nan adopted son of Tahua. And there was Tamata, too, adopted son of\r\nTaupangi. They seemed to be a reception committee from the Big Masters,\r\ninviting us to the harvest festival at the Lake.\r\n\r\nHamlin had warned me of difficulties going overland to the Lake. But\r\nour failure of that morning had roused all the mule blood in me. If I\r\nwent to the Lord of the Lake and prevailed on him to cancel the tabu\r\nand let me make the necessary examinations I might accomplish the\r\npurpose of my visit. After all, it was only a walk of seven or eight\r\nmiles, I was in fair condition, and impatient when Hamlin argued that I\r\nhad better not try it. I didn’t know what I was in for....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Here I paused and looked at the empty coffeepot. “Guess I’d better\r\nmake some more,” I said to Templeton Crocker. When I got back with the\r\ncoffee I asked, “Are you tired of listening?” “Lord, no!” said Crocker.\r\n“And I hope you’re not tired of talking.” “I’m never tired of talking,”\r\nI said, and went on.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was rather glad to be away from the _France_ for a while. The\r\nsociability on board was getting on my nerves. I had already learned\r\nthat their dialect was akin to Polynesian and that the word _tabu_ was\r\nfeared and respected. But it wasn’t at all like the German _verboten_.\r\nWe didn’t use _tabu_ properly or understand it properly. A thing could\r\nbe tabu one minute, I discovered, and not tabu the next. When I found\r\nstanding room only in my cabin, everything in it being pulled up or\r\npulled down by curious island fingers, I would smile mildly and say,\r\n“Tabu, tabu!” It wouldn’t do to lose patience and push them out. They\r\nwould be tabu-ed out of the main cabin, but we only had to wait a\r\nlittle before a head, then an arm, then a leg would appear slyly in the\r\ncompanionway. Then they would all ooze in again. We had talked it over\r\namong ourselves and had decided that they were Polynesians, kind and\r\ncourteous to friends; but an uncouth word might rouse their tempers to\r\na fury.\r\n\r\nWe started on our little stroll to the Lake. At Hamlin’s suggestion\r\nI put on a pair of heavy army shoes with stout brass screws in soles\r\nand heels--seemed rather a silly precaution. Buia was guiding us and\r\nwe had a few carriers for our light packs. A tin of sardines and two\r\nship’s biscuits would be enough for each of us, in case of famine. My\r\npack included a light change of clothes and toilet necessities. Also\r\nwe had a bundle of tribute-gifts for Tahua and Taupangi. Hamlin had\r\nbeen foresighted enough to include tea, butter, sugar, salt, pepper and\r\na benzine tin to make tea in. Otherwise we expected to live off the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOur march began with a climb up 400 feet of cliff, up a sort of ladder\r\ntrail which generations had scooped out with shells. The coral stone\r\nseemed to be so many little daggers, slicing at me until my hands and\r\nknees began to bleed. Once on the summit, there were slopes of coral;\r\neverything on the island was coral, except thin patches of earth that\r\nhad caught on the surface. I think that the people got what they ate by\r\nmoving from patch to patch and picking whatever grew there. We found a\r\ngrove of pawpaws. The carriers were eating the fruit green, so I tried\r\na paw. They were not bad. Green pawpaws are full of papain, with an\r\naction similar to that of pepsin.... Walking along, nibbling, I began\r\nto feel that the difficulties of the trip had been overrated. Then\r\nbeyond the grove I looked across the bleakness of the land from which a\r\nhealthy people had hacked their bare living through ages of struggle.\r\nOver the trail in front of us was a mass of briary vines. Must we go\r\nthrough that? Buia led the way.\r\n\r\nI wore a helmet and was sorry, for the rest of the way we had to walk\r\nat a crouch through a tunnel of close-woven twigs. Vines pulled off my\r\nhelmet, tripped me up, flung me about. Two good men with machetes could\r\nhave cleared this trail; but there were no machetes in this land of\r\nlittle iron. There was always coral underfoot, cutting with thousands\r\nof minute edges. Beyond the vines trees were growing out of solid\r\ncoral; the forest was so dense that we were in twilight, all the way\r\nto the Lake. Perspiration oozed out of us, rain oozed in, wetting us\r\nthrough. Yet we were so thirsty that we must stop every half-mile or so\r\nto swig from our water-bottles. A cigarette would have helped, but they\r\nwere saturated by misty rain the instant they came out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe barefoot carriers didn’t seem to mind the jagged stuff; they would\r\nstep daintily around a bristling lump which could have opened an\r\nartery. Now I knew why Rennellese legs were always scarred up to the\r\nknee. The gods of Rennell Island had thrown up another barrier against\r\nstrangers. When we approached an especially bad lump Buia would point\r\nit out in time for me to balance myself on my cane to avoid a fall that\r\nmight have scraped me to death.\r\n\r\nMaybe you have scared your children to sleep by telling of obstacles,\r\nnatural and supernatural, which the hero must overcome in his climb to\r\nthe ogre’s castle. On that walk to the Lake fissures would appear in\r\nthe rock, spanned by rain-slippery, mossy logs. Buia would stand on the\r\nslimy thing, agile as a monkey, and pleasantly help us across the void.\r\nI wore two pairs of woolen stockings when I started out; now they hung\r\nin shreds against my bleeding calves. At the first step on a log I saw\r\nthat the thick leather of my shoes was torn as if it had been scraped\r\nacross yards of barbed wire. Now I knew why Hamlin had thought that\r\nI couldn’t finish this little tour. By the time we reached the muddy\r\nshores of the Lake my dreadnaught shoes had about gone back on me, and\r\nthe brass-studded soles were flopping about like broken wings.\r\n\r\nOn a knoll some fifty yards from the Lake we came upon another of those\r\nqueer Rennell houses, practically all roof with eaves a couple of feet\r\nfrom the ground. There were no doors or windows, so you got in by\r\ncrawling under the eaves. There was nothing inside but a great pile of\r\ncoconuts. We were told not to touch them because they were extra tabu.\r\nCoconuts were very scarce. Hog-dirty, dog-tired, White and Hamlin and\r\nI tumbled down and panted, quite willing to die among the coconuts, if\r\nonly they let us alone.\r\n\r\nSomebody was crawling in after us. It was Buia with a couple of\r\nhandsome natives. Buia said that we had better hurry up, as the Big\r\nMasters, Tahua and Taupangi, were waiting to receive us. So we were\r\nup again, mucking our way through a mile of lakeside and up to a\r\nso-called village. There were shackly palm-leaf canopies on crooked\r\npoles--where people slept, perhaps. There were caverns in the coral\r\nover yonder, which might serve as apartments. We came to another\r\nRennell house, slightly larger than the one we had been in. In a palace\r\nlike this there is no question of Majesty having obeisance paid it or\r\nof a court officer instructing one how to bow and kneel. You crawl\r\nin on all fours, and on all fours you greet the reigning sovereign.\r\nTaupangi, Lord of the Lake, sat in state on a pile of native mats, and\r\nwas properly dressed for the religious ceremonies. Around his waist\r\nhe wore a wide tapa and a fancifully woven mat. His hair was in a\r\nknot at the back of his head and he was smeared all over with sacred\r\nyellow turmeric. He was still young, and about the biggest man I saw\r\non Rennell Island, with shoulders like an ox’s yoke and a wonderfully\r\nproportioned body. All of the Big Masters that I saw were handsome men,\r\nnone of them running to fat as Polynesians do in middle age.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the house sat a younger, still handsomer man,\r\nenthroned on mats. He had the perfect classic profile and his tattooed\r\ntorso was magnificent. This was Tekita, who had acted as the Big\r\nMaster’s substitute during the ceremonies of the week; during the\r\nritual God had passed from Taupangi’s head and into Tekita’s. He was\r\nbeing king for a day, as it were, for the great spirit (Tainatua)\r\nowned every stick and stone on Rennell Island, and the man whose head\r\npossessed him spoke with the voice of God. Taupangi, for the nonce, was\r\nonly human. Soon, when Divinity resumed its seat in his brain, he would\r\nagain be all powerful over the division of labor, crops and everything\r\nelse in his little realm.\r\n\r\nTekita, the substitute, had been chewing betel-nuts, and seemed\r\nexcited, as well he might be considering his lofty rise. Superficially\r\nhe behaved like quite a conceited young fellow. He spoke pidgin English\r\nfairly well--he might have been one of those whom Lever Brothers’ yacht\r\nhad taken away on an unsuccessful attempt at recruiting. With all the\r\ngestures of royalty Tekita seated himself next to the Big Master and\r\ngraciously did some interpreting. As he talked he rolled his eyes\r\nand every few moments he would go into a silent semi-trance. He was\r\ngoing on much like any charlatan trying to impress an audience. In\r\na prophetic voice he admitted that he was glad to see Hamlin again.\r\n“Hamlin fadder belong me,” he said. And promptly wanted to know what\r\npresent “fadder belong him” had brought. This honorary fatherhood,\r\nalthough it cemented our friendship with Taupangi’s people, was\r\nbecoming a bit of a nuisance.\r\n\r\nI found more pidgin than I had expected, at first. It was gradually\r\nfiltering in. (I can’t forget Tekita’s lordly farewell, spoken between\r\ntrances: “Me too sorry belong you fellow you come along here.” Meaning,\r\nof course, that he was glad; but he had somehow mixed his adjectives.)\r\n\r\nI wanted to see Tahua, Lord of the White Sands, but when I asked this\r\nfavor of Taupangi, the Lord of the Lake, he was jealously evasive. Our\r\ntribute of an adze and axe changed his mind (which was Tekita, speaking\r\nwith the voice of God). Guides led us over to a miserable little hut\r\nof sticks and vines. Apparently Taupangi wasn’t being too lavish with\r\nhis rival. But there was enough room inside for the bearded, muscular\r\nTahua to sit in state opposite his divinely inspired substitute. Tahua\r\nrelaxed to a somewhat cupidinous smile when we presented him with an\r\nadze. This meeting wasn’t much, but it was what a bond salesman would\r\ncall a “contact.” I knew that I would have to gain Tahua’s good will\r\nbefore I could even attempt hookworm examinations on his side of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nTomorrow would end the festival, with the ceremony of putting God\r\nback into the heads of the Big Masters. I was too tired to care. I\r\nhad sloshed through mud until I found fresh water, made a pretense\r\nof washing my face and hands and came back dirtier than before. Now\r\nI could see why the inland Rennellese went unbathed, except when it\r\nhappened to rain on them. I crawled into the guest house--not daring to\r\ntouch the pile of sacred coconuts--and eased my feet with clean socks\r\nand tennis shoes. Then I spread out my blanket and got on it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sleep! it is a gentle thing,” said the Ancient Mariner. In\r\nTaupangi’s domain it was a mixed blessing. When I started to drowse,\r\nour courteous hosts came in with a rough wooden bowl filled with\r\n_pana_, a glorified sweet potato. Although they had peeled the\r\nvegetables with their dirty fingers, the smell of food woke me\r\npleasantly. Since leaving the _France_ we had had nothing but a few\r\nsardines and one sea-biscuit apiece. I had watched the natives cooking;\r\nRennellese fire-sticks were pieces of rotten wood which they rubbed\r\nuntil the spark came. They lined a hole with coral stones, started a\r\nfire on them and kept it going until the stones were white hot. Then\r\nthey wrapped food in leaves, laid it on the stones, covered it with\r\nearth and let nature take its course.\r\n\r\nExcept for a small clamshell, which they used mostly to scrape the\r\nmeat from coconuts, the wooden bowl was their only eating utensil. At\r\nfestival dances they used the bowls as drums. These, and big wooden\r\ndrums, were the only musical instruments they had. I was sorry that we\r\nhad forgotten to bring them jew’s harps, which would have charmed them\r\ninto ecstasies.\r\n\r\nTo say that I slept that night would be a gross exaggeration. Every\r\nman, woman and child who could crowd in became our bedmate. Communism\r\nand comfort seem to be strangers. We lay all coiled together, Gordon\r\nWhite and I sharing the common lot. The rest of our crowd had had sense\r\nenough to find some sort of shelter outside. Before we slept--if it\r\ncould be called sleeping--a burly, blustery fellow named Panio came\r\nin and showed all the specious heartiness of the typical politician.\r\nInstinctively I felt that we might have trouble with Panio. If I had\r\nknown, as I learned later, that he belonged on the beach, a henchman of\r\nTahua, and was one of the three that had killed Deck’s missionaries, I\r\nmight have slept even more lightly than I did.\r\n\r\nLying on the floor, cuddled very close to me, was Tamata, son of\r\nTaupangi, and on the other side, equally intimate, was Tahua’s adopted\r\nson. I could see why the house was so popular, for the night was quite\r\ncool; outside in the ridiculous leaf-and-stick shelters only a mat\r\nprotected the sleeper. I had seen women lying in the open, babes in\r\narms, snoring serenely with cold rain sifting all over them.\r\n\r\nThe house inside reminded me of Mark Twain’s description of Brigham\r\nYoung’s bed; if anybody turned they all had to turn. Far into the\r\nnight, pidgin English questions were pegged at me from this side\r\nand that. They all wanted to learn a little more while they had the\r\nopportunity. Indoors or out, it was the crudest existence imaginable,\r\nnot far removed from the animal. Yet they thrived on it, to all\r\nappearances....\r\n\r\nNext morning, after we had implored our hosts to break their\r\none-meal-a-day custom and cook us a fish, we went over to the harvest\r\nfestival, which was drawing to a dramatic close.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(I paused to light a cigarette, and Crocker prompted me with “What\r\nhappened then?”)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell (I said) the show was held near Taupangi’s house. He and his\r\nrival, Tahua, with several other Big Masters, were the features. They\r\nhad laid aside their bunchy loin coverings and wore nothing but strips\r\nof tapa between their buttocks and around their waists. From head to\r\nfoot they were yellow with royal turmeric. Tahua’s first gesture, when\r\nhe saw me, was to point at my bare legs. I didn’t understand, until I\r\nlearned that Resident Commissioner Dick Kane, the first white man known\r\nto have penetrated as far as the Lake, had worn woolen stockings. When\r\nthe natives were curious, he told them that in civilization only big\r\nchiefs were allowed to wear stockings. Next time I visited Taupangi I\r\nrestored my status by covering my calves.\r\n\r\nThere was a rough dirt court, about fifty yards by ten. They had\r\nfenced it with sticks and leaves, higher than a man’s head. This was\r\nto keep women out. If any female looked in on the ceremony she would\r\nsurely die, they said. There was some trouble about letting us into\r\nthe enclosure. We were told that the gods, angered at our presence,\r\nmight do us harm. Finally, as a measure of protection, Taupangi sat\r\nbetween us and danger. Before he rose to take part in the ceremonies he\r\ninsisted that another Master, a very old one, should sit in his place,\r\nso that at all times we were well insulated against the supernatural.\r\n\r\nThe precious coconuts which we had been sleeping with were now piled in\r\nthe center of the court; beside them was a rude platform where sat the\r\ntwo young men who had substituted as godheads for the two Big Masters.\r\n\r\nThen the Masters--there were about twenty of the minor ones in\r\nall--began filing slowly around the coconut pile, their faces turned\r\nheavenward as they chanted. First Taupangi would take up the theme,\r\nthen the others would join in a sort of obbligato. The walk sped up\r\ngradually to a curious leaping, first on one foot then the other; they\r\nhopped by rule, two on the right leg, two on the left. The pounding of\r\ndrums and food-bowls, the howling song and general yelling increased\r\nto a hubbub. Abruptly the dancers would sit down, and the racket would\r\ncease. Finally Tekita (still monarch pro tem) rose from his platform\r\nand distributed coconuts from the pile.\r\n\r\nThe big moment came. The celebrants began working God out of the two\r\nsubstitutes and back into the heads of Taupangi and Tahua. The faces\r\nof both Big Masters were set in earnest religious devotion. The lesser\r\nMasters formed a line, four abreast, and hopped some distance toward\r\nthe house where Tekita had been sitting. Singing at the top of their\r\nlungs, their hands outstretched toward Heaven, they hopped back. Their\r\nslow retreat and progress brought them nearer the house each time; they\r\ncame at last within six feet of the eaves. At last with a bloodcurdling\r\nhowl they rushed up and struck the roof with the flat of their hands.\r\nThen, apparently, God flew from his temporary dwelling back into the\r\nheads of Tahua and Taupangi.\r\n\r\nThe minute this transfer was made Taupangi’s substitute seemed to come\r\nback to normal. He had lost the superiority complex altogether, and was\r\na relaxed, courteous and jolly fellow.\r\n\r\nThat night our bird hunters brought in some ducks, which we ate half\r\nraw, because the natives only knew how to scorch them. Themselves, they\r\nnever ate ducks; ducks were unclean feeders, the people said. Thinking\r\nthat we might protect ourselves from the sociability of the house, we\r\nset up a tent. In fifteen minutes our tent was jammed with self-invited\r\nguests. The frail canvas came down two or three times during the night\r\nfrom the pressure of those inside getting out and those outside getting\r\nin. In the weary, dreary morning, plagued with thirst, I tried drinking\r\nwater from the Lake, where the natives seemed to get theirs. On the\r\ncoral-jagged march back to the beach, I found to my embarrassment that\r\nthe Lake was quite unfriendly to a white man’s digestion.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the White Sands some interesting gossip was going the\r\nrounds. It was about Tekita, who had been substituting for Taupangi. By\r\nall the rules a substitute was supposed to be very tabu during that\r\nperiod, especially for women. But when God got back into Taupangi’s\r\nhead he told on Tekita, who had broken his tabu with a certain village\r\nmaiden. So God visited his punishment on Taupangi, not Tekita, and told\r\nhim that he could not go down to the _France_ while she was in the bay.\r\nSomehow the Almighty must have reversed himself, for Taupangi visited\r\nus a few days later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile I was at the Lake I never for a moment overlooked the problem\r\nof hookworm examinations, nor did I fail to put in a great deal of\r\ntime making a census of the people for apparent diseases. Since Buia\r\nhad warned me not to mention hookworms to the Big Master, I was still\r\nsearching for a way to go ahead. Then Buia fixed it. My guess was that\r\nhe spoke to Mua, son of Taupangi; for both the Lord of the Lake and his\r\nson had first class minds. Tahua, Lord of the White Sands, was reputed\r\nto have less “power” than Taupangi; that is to say, he was unable to\r\ngo into a “sweating trance” as the chief of Lake Tenggano could, they\r\nsaid. Mua told me that Taupangi could kill by wishing, through his\r\ncloser connection with the Grandson God.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, when we were back on the beach Buia told me that if I\r\ncould give him and Mua the specimen tins, and would make examinations\r\nbefore the two Big Masters came, maybe it would be all right. I had\r\noffered a large fishhook and a small fishhook for every specimen,\r\nwhich may have been why we got a few. We found a light infection, but\r\nunder such adverse conditions we were unable to determine whether the\r\nhookworms were ancient, modern or what. It was interesting to observe\r\nthe watchful care with which our tin containers were returned. Each man\r\nwould squat in front of our worktable and never take his eyes off the\r\nspecimen until we had finished and thrown it into a hole in the sand.\r\nThey were taking no chances on our being witch doctors, come to make\r\nblack magic.\r\n\r\nIf I had been given the ghost of an opportunity I might have reached\r\nsome conclusion; I might have washed out their specimens according to\r\nthe regulation field technique and studied the parasites under the\r\nmicroscope. This might have added important clues in the search for\r\nRennell Island’s history, for the hookworm contents of a race may tell\r\na great deal about the origins and migrations of a people. Dr. S. T.\r\nDarling, eminent in tropical medicine, had developed theories on this\r\nparasite, which he collected all over the globe. He demonstrated that\r\nthe original habitat of the _Ankylostoma duodenale_ was north of twenty\r\ndegrees north latitude, while the _Necator americanus_ stemmed from a\r\nregion south of that line. This is a point which has not been given\r\ndue weight by anthropologists. All my work over the Pacific added\r\nvalidity to Darling’s theory. Certainly I found that both Melanesians\r\nand Polynesians living south of twenty degrees north latitude--provided\r\nthat they had not been contaminated by Asiatics--carried only the\r\n_Necator americanus_--an evidence that their origin and migration must\r\nhave been from south of this latitude.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine my disappointment in learning so little from the\r\ntabu-haunted Rennellese, to whom the intimate details of a worm-count\r\nwould have been a capital offense. On all the island there was nothing\r\nlike a latrine; like the followers of Moses, these primitives dug holes\r\nin the sand and carefully covered “that which they had done”--this as\r\na precaution against some witch’s charm. Sand, however, is far too\r\nporous to hold down the enterprising larvae, especially when the hole\r\nis only a surface scratch. We devoted much time to examining blood\r\nfor filariasis, which was conspicuous for its absence. Our spleen\r\nexaminations revealed no malaria, either on Rennell or its little\r\nneighboring sister, Bellona, although both were definitely in the\r\nmalaria belt. Neither did we find an anopheline mosquito.\r\n\r\nThe complete absence of dysentery was interesting, because it had once\r\nbeen brought there by an apparently clean ship, and had decimated\r\nthe population. It had died out, probably because the Rennell flies,\r\nalthough they flew in swarms, did not seem to light on human beings;\r\nalso there was no water supply to be contaminated--the beach natives\r\ndrew water from holes at the bottom of the cliffs, the interior natives\r\ndrank out of the Lake. Food was no carrier, for it was cooked in the\r\nskins.\r\n\r\nThere was little sign of past devastations, although there was evidence\r\nthat the few visiting ships had brought them influenza and an infection\r\nof gonorrhea, from which they had recovered.\r\n\r\nWandering about, I finally came upon a few miserable beings, hidden\r\naway from intruders. They were suffering from yaws. The people had\r\nnot talked about yaws. They seemed to be ashamed of it. It was quite\r\nevident that they had kept the disease from spreading by an age-old,\r\nself-taught practice of segregation.\r\n\r\nThe Rennellese wore their one garment until it was threadbare; by day\r\nit was trousers, by night pajamas. Since the water in the Lake was hard\r\nto get at and the water below the cliffs came in driblets, only expert\r\nswimmers knew the pleasures of bathing. They rather disliked the touch\r\nof salt water, but this prejudice was not responsible for a certain\r\nskin condition.\r\n\r\nScabies was present, but not serious. The prevalent disease on Rennell,\r\nI think, was something they called _onga-onga_, a sort of itch. The\r\ninhabitants claimed that it had been brought there by Dr. Deck’s\r\nunpopular missionaries. Apparently it only appeared as a dermatitis,\r\nthe result of scratching. Constant scratching was a native gesture.\r\nWhen the disease first came, they told me, everyone went mad, ran to\r\nthe bush, threw away their clothes and dug their nails into every part\r\nof their bodies.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after we left the island all of us came down with it.\r\nTo me it was a most unpleasant visitor. It began at my thighs and\r\ncovered me from knees to waist, like a pair of shorts. I could see\r\nno discoloration, save where my nails had torn my skin. Hot baths\r\nirritated it. Successive days of treating myself with saturated\r\nsolution of salicylic acid in strong tincture of iodine, then with\r\nDeek’s ointment, brought relief. My skin peeled completely away from\r\nthe infected area, and I haven’t heard from _onga-onga_ since....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after we had re-established headquarters on the _France_\r\nnatives from the interior came flocking to trade mats and baskets for\r\nbeads and knives and fishhooks. Obviously the situation was growing\r\ntouchy, with jealousy between inland-dweller and beach-dweller. There\r\nwere one or two wrestling matches, not too good-natured--strange\r\ncombats, in which two strong men pulled each other’s hair until the\r\nweaker fell. These were dogfights, and we were the bone of contention.\r\n\r\nThe situation tightened when Panio, Tahua’s strong-arm who had helped\r\ndo away with Deck’s missioners, came aboard and proceeded to make\r\nhimself obnoxious. Panio was unlike the other islanders. He dramatized\r\nhimself as a murderer. With much diplomacy we had reached a point where\r\nwe could keep the people out of our cabins for short intervals--but not\r\nPanio. In blustering ward-heeler style he would walk in, throw out his\r\nchest and take possession. He was angry with Buia for getting more than\r\nhis share of good things; also he had a social bee in his bonnet; his\r\ndaughter wasn’t being recognized by the local _haut monde_.\r\n\r\nYes, it was getting ticklish. Like all bullies, Panio was putting up a\r\ndangerous front because, probably, his gang was behind him. For all I\r\nknew we were a dozen against fifteen hundred. All the rights were on\r\ntheir side; we had come unasked, and they had entertained us with the\r\nbest they had; on the _France_ they were merely returning our visit,\r\nand it was impossible for them to understand why we shouldn’t give them\r\nthe run of the ship and whatever they fancied in the way of food. When\r\nwe asked for privacy they no doubt thought of us as stingy, grasping\r\nstrangers. Remember, these people were all born communists.\r\n\r\nOur nerves were wearing thin. Something must be done about Panio. One\r\nnight when we cleared the cabin he refused to budge. This time I made\r\nmy voice firmer than Rennell diplomacy required; he stood his ground,\r\nlooking not at all pretty. I told Hamlin and White what I was going\r\nto do, and when they nodded I used my clearest pidgin on Panio. Would\r\nhe get out or be thrown out? Rather a ridiculous question, for he was\r\nyears younger than I, immensely powerful and in the pink. Facing him, I\r\nthought, “I’m in for it now. I’ll _have_ to put him out....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Here I paused to drip cold coffee into my cup. Templeton Crocker\r\nasked, “And did you?”)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat happened next (I said) was a sort of psychic curiosity. Panio\r\nstood firm and looked for a long time straight through my glasses into\r\nmy furious eyes. My glance didn’t swerve. Suddenly his nerve seemed to\r\nooze away. He dropped his eyes, shuffled, turned and marched out of the\r\ncabin and up the stairs. When I got on deck he was gone.\r\n\r\nI don’t mind confessing that after the thing was over I had the “wind\r\nup,” as the British say; so much so that I went to my grip and found\r\nmy pistol. Next morning the relations between us and our guests seemed\r\na bit strained, and I was dreading the consequences--when back came\r\nPanio, carrying a broad grin and a tribute of baked _panas_ for me. To\r\nthis day I don’t know how I subdued him, with only a look. Possibly he\r\nwas afraid that my glasses would slay him with the spell of the evil\r\neye. Possibly I had quelled him the way, I am told, you can quell wild\r\nbeasts, by a fixed and powerful stare.... I should hate to try it on a\r\nBengal tiger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe native name for Rennell Island is Mungava (Big Rennell) and for\r\nBellona Island it is Mungiki (Little Rennell). The _France_ hadn’t\r\nvisited Bellona on its other trip; very few Europeans had ever dared\r\nto go ashore there. After Buia told us that one of the kings of\r\nBellona was his cousin and might make things easy for us, Hamlin was\r\nparticularly anxious to touch there. Then all the population of Rennell\r\nIsland clamored to be taken along. Mua, son of Taupangi, was the most\r\nclamorous of all. I promised to take these two young men, provided and\r\nagreed that they would smooth the way for me to get plenty of hookworm\r\nspecimens. If we hadn’t taken Mua, his father would have been furious\r\nbecause his son had been left behind and Tahua’s representative had\r\ngone with us.\r\n\r\nAfter talking things over with their two Big Masters, Buia and Mua\r\nmade a quaint suggestion. The people of Bellona might be “cross too\r\nmuch.” As we were approaching the shore Mua and Buia had decided that\r\nit would be a good idea to dress up in European clothes, put shotguns\r\nover their shoulders and look like hunting naturalists. This disguise\r\nwould impress the natives, for some undisclosed reason, and after that\r\neverything would be smooth going.\r\n\r\nWe reached the little bay in the little island, which was a\r\nstone-walled Rennell in miniature--about four miles long and three\r\nwide. It had much more soil on it and looked much more fertile. When\r\nwe found anchorage we shouted and fired guns to attract attention, but\r\nnothing stirred. Jagged masses of coral endangered our anchorage; on\r\na windy day we would have been beaten to pieces. As it was, our keel\r\ngot a terrific bump on a hidden snag, the anchor chain parted and we\r\nwere set adrift. The four-mile engine got us around at last; we worked\r\nall night and finally dropped an improvised anchor. Our survival was a\r\ncompliment to the stout teakwood hull of the _France_.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning canoes appeared, coming out to us. Buia and Mua\r\nhastily arrayed themselves in white men’s raincoats and hats, and when\r\nthe natives drew alongside our amateur detectives began shouting at\r\nthem in the vilest and most profane pidgin English--evidently their\r\nconception of trading skippers approaching an island. Buia and Mua\r\nlooked their parts so little that you wouldn’t have thought they could\r\nfool a baby. But the Bellona folk stared anxiously up at them, and\r\nwhen our impersonators began to address them in their native language\r\nthe listeners were bewildered. Who were these foreigners who spoke so\r\nfluently in the speech of Bellona?\r\n\r\nSuddenly Buia and Mua threw off their disguise. A sigh of wonder went\r\nover the reception committee, then a shout of welcome swelled to an\r\novation. It was a breath-taking occasion: native boys had actually\r\ncome as guides to a European vessel! The people of Mungiki, very like\r\ntheir relatives of Mungava, swarmed aboard and rubbed noses with their\r\nheroes. Every visitor bristled with bows and arrows, spears and clubs;\r\nthey looked fiercer and wilder than the Rennell folk. Surrounding us,\r\nmore curious than hostile, their every gesture seemed a threat. The\r\nfew who could speak pidgin went anxiously among us, asking, “Captain,\r\nCaptain?” They wanted to know which of our party was top dog.\r\n\r\nFinally Buia led us ashore, and we were surprised at the neat little\r\nhouses among the heavy palms. Everything we saw was clean and well\r\nkept, including the villagers. For some lost reason they seemed to have\r\nlearned the art of taking care of themselves. When we returned to the\r\nboat Buia’s cousin, one of the three kings, sent word that he was ready\r\nto receive us. We returned the compliment by asking him aboard, only to\r\nbe told that it was tabu for a king to come on a stranger’s ship. There\r\nhad been war between the three kings; and how in the world there was\r\nroom for three wars between three kings is another South Sea mystery.\r\n\r\nAs the soil looked richer, so the people looked healthier than those of\r\nRennell, where epidemics had killed many elderly folk. On Bellona there\r\nwere many of the old and wizened. They were fine-looking, very light in\r\ncolor, their features well cut. When I sent again to the three kings,\r\ntelling Buia to say that they wouldn’t get an ax or an adze or any\r\nother dainty unless they came, their Triple Majesties showed up. They\r\nwere polite enough, and after I bribed them with an ax apiece I told\r\nBuia to tell them the object of my visit: hookworms. Whereupon they\r\ninformed me that they did not want doctors, they did not want missions,\r\nthey did not want government, and they would give me no census. Quite\r\ncourteously, they preferred our room to our company.\r\n\r\nEven an overnight inspection showed the good results of quarantine\r\nagainst foreign-borne disease and custom. Although pathologically I\r\nwas unable to look into the case, they seemed to have nothing to fear,\r\nexcept petty wars. Their teeth were poor in comparison to the handsome\r\nmouths of the Rennellese. This was due, perhaps, to a different method\r\nof betel-nut chewing.\r\n\r\nThen we sailed back to the White Sands, where by the demonstration they\r\nmade we might have been to Peru and back. Big Master Taupangi grabbed\r\nmy shoulders and tenderly rubbed noses with me. Marking my surprise,\r\nhe shook with laughter and extended me an invitation to attach myself\r\nto his court and stay there the rest of my life. For one with God\r\nin his head, he was feeling very jovial and stood back to back with\r\nme to prove that he was an inch taller. When I went over his chest,\r\nthighs and belly with a tape-line he was proud as a peacock to know\r\nthat he was larger all around than the largest European on the vessel.\r\nEach day before we left he came back, as God’s vicar in Tenggano, and\r\npresented me with a basket of yams and a basket of _pana_ in trade for\r\na tin of bully beef, a tin of salmon and a few ship’s biscuits. This\r\nhuman reservoir of divinity was extremely fond of tinned fish. So were\r\nthey all. Every few minutes a Rennellese brave would show up and say,\r\n“Master, belly belonga me he hongry too much.” Our Solomon Island crew\r\nlooked down on these people. Once Hamlin said to me, “Doctor, these\r\nRennellese live almost like dogs.” Whereupon little Ga’a chipped in,\r\n“Master, dis fellow he no dog. Dog he know somet’ing.”\r\n\r\nOur departure was the end of a field day. Tahua, always a businessman,\r\nhad been selling us the finer mats and baskets which the Lake people\r\nhad made. Mats were coming in faster than we could handle them, but\r\nwe still gave in exchange the best we had to these kindly, likable\r\nislanders. Everybody wanted a lock-box, because I had promised one to\r\nBuia. I had only one left, and that I gave to Tahua, out of respect\r\nfor his superior station. Tekita and Mua were clamoring for ones just\r\nlike it. Then down came my old college chum, Taupangi. If Tahua had\r\na lock-box, where was his? Imagine my embarrassment. Finally I found\r\nan old wooden box in the engineroom, got Bella to hinge a cover on it\r\nand to nail on the brass locks of my own tucker-box. The Lake people\r\ncheered _en masse_ at the presentation, but Buia and Tahua looked very\r\nglum. The small pressed-paper boxes I had given them were nothing\r\ncompared to the grand prize which the Lord of the Lake carried away.\r\n\r\nThe people saw that we were actually going, and the prices of mats and\r\nbaskets fell to almost nothing. Rennell’s little stock exchange was\r\nhaving a slump. Before we started for Tulagi I doled out fishhooks\r\nto the two rival kings. I served out the hooks with Spartan justice,\r\nfirst two to Tahua, then two to Taupangi. I started in with a box of\r\nlarge-sized ones, and when that was finished Tahua hastily picked up\r\nthe box of smaller ones and thrust it in my hand. He was afraid I might\r\nforget about it, or change my mind. Appreciative laughter from the\r\ncrowd, who probably realized that Tahua was a chronic go-getter.\r\n\r\nLock-boxes, however, were the treasures of treasures. It wasn’t until\r\nwe were out at sea that I realized why. To them these things, with lids\r\nthat you could fasten with your own key, represented privacy. Here was\r\nsomething where you could store away small objects that were your very\r\nown. From birth to death in Rennell’s primitive society there was no\r\nsuch thing as a door to close or a curtain to draw when you wished to\r\nbe alone and mind your own business. Instinctively the untaught savage\r\nlonged for a sanctuary, away from prying eyes. I had to have lived\r\non communistic Rennell Island to understand and value civilization’s\r\ngreatest boon--privacy.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the comparative civilization of Tulagi we found\r\nthat Resident Commissioner Ashley had worried because we were overdue\r\nand had started out on an expedition to find us. He had taken thirty\r\narmed policemen aboard the _Renadi_, for the luck of former visitors\r\nto Rennell Island had given the place such an evil reputation that the\r\nProtectorate had ordered that nobody should approach it without an\r\narmed guard. Captain Ashley had put a machine gun on the _Renadi_, and\r\nDr. Steenson had gone along with a hospital unit.\r\n\r\nI wish Ashley had seen me rubbing noses with the chiefs when we bade\r\nfarewell to Rennell....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Templeton Crocker looked around the porch and said, “Good heavens,\r\nit’s daylight!” Sure enough, it was. “I’d better be getting back to the\r\n_Zaca_,” he said. “We sail at noon. But tell me one thing, Doctor. Will\r\nthese queer Rennellese go on, pretty healthy and contented, just as\r\nthey’ve always been? Or what?”)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Something will have to be done about them,” I said, “and the thing\r\nto do is to let them alone. What worried me most was the business\r\nenterprise that the Lord of the White Sands was showing. Anything\r\nfor iron. Trade the women’s services for a knife or a busted chisel.\r\nRennell is leaping from the Shell Age into the Iron Age. They’ve\r\nnever touched the Stone Age, because they hardly know what stone is.\r\nBefore somebody brought in the white man’s ax they did surprisingly\r\nwell with a clamshell on the end of a stick. They don’t seem to like\r\nmissionaries, but they’re mad to learn European ways because that\r\nknowledge will bring more trade. Their ‘virtue’ as we call it? Well,\r\nvirtue is about the same the world over. In some countries women are\r\ntabu. They don’t happen to be in Rennell, where the women are the only\r\nthing that appeals to the white man as trade. From a doctor’s angle,\r\nvirtue’s great virtue is this: It’s prophylactic.\r\n\r\n“Imported disease; that’s what threatens Rennell, sure as God made\r\nlittle apples. Now they’re healthier than the average in San Francisco,\r\nsay. From what I could find out, their only ills have come from the few\r\nvisits white men or Japanese have made there--except hookworm. I wish I\r\nknew more about that parasite on Rennell.\r\n\r\n“They’re so susceptible to imported germs that I’ll tell you what\r\nhappened. Before the _France_ came to the White Sands, remember,\r\nI examined everybody on board for the slightest trace of anything\r\n‘catching.’ Except for the sore-eyed cook, whom we tried to keep out\r\nof the way, we were all apparently clean as a whistle. Yet we hadn’t\r\nbeen on the island ten days before an epidemic of head colds swept the\r\npeople. They didn’t know what was the matter with them; they didn’t\r\neven know how to blow their noses.”\r\n\r\n“Where did they pick up those colds?” Crocker asked.\r\n\r\n“They caught them from us. Our noses and throats were full of latent\r\ngerms to which we had an immunity, whereas the Rennellese had none.\r\nThey wore few clothes, they slept out in the rain, they were exposed to\r\nwinds and drafts, yet the common cold was an absolute stranger to them.\r\nThey had had an influenza epidemic, once; the white man brought it.\r\nThey had had gonorrhea, once; the white man brought that too. Once they\r\ncaught dysentery, from a ship that was supposedly clean of it. Bring in\r\nmore ships and Rennell will go down and out, as so many other islands\r\nhave. And I don’t want Rennell to go down and out.”\r\n\r\n“Because they’re a unique people?” Crocker asked.\r\n\r\n“Because they’re the only living relic, that I know, of a prehistoric\r\nrace, changed so little that they will make an invaluable study for\r\nscientific research. But not for casual sailors and traders. There’s\r\nnothing on Rennell Island worth trading for.... What I should like\r\nto see done is this: Have the Government put ‘NO ADMITTANCE’ on both\r\nRennell and Bellona--except for an honest scientific expedition, coming\r\nthere for no other reason than legitimate research. For those islands\r\nare nothing more or less than studies in the history of mankind.”\r\n\r\nSo Templeton Crocker went back to his ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd all this led up to my brandy-and-eggs conversation with Raymond\r\nFosdick. In fact, it also led up to one of my most interesting\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nFor when morning broke, after my Arabian night with Crocker, Eloisa\r\nreminded me again that he was in need of fresh eggs and that we had\r\nplenty in the hen-house. “I’ve gathered three dozen,” she said, “and\r\nyou might put them on the _Zaca_ when you go down to the office.”\r\n\r\nI took the eggs over to the _Zaca_, which was busily preening herself\r\nfor a long haul. I left them with my compliments and best wishes. The\r\n_Zaca_ sailed at noon.\r\n\r\nA few days later a messenger came over from the Fiji Club with\r\nsomething wrapped in the _Times and Herald_. Unwrapping, I found four\r\nbottles of 1835 brandy. There was no address on the package, and I\r\nthought there was some mistake. I asked Amos, secretary of the Club,\r\nand he said: “Well, if you don’t want the stuff, I do. But Mr. Crocker\r\nseemed to say that it was for you.”\r\n\r\nI wrote my thanks to Templeton Crocker, and this opened up a lively\r\ncorrespondence. He was about the way I had been when I first heard\r\nabout Rennell Island. He couldn’t drop the subject, and as months went\r\nby his keenness seemed to grow. Early in 1933, he wrote that he had\r\nmade some changes in the _Zaca_ so that it would be more handy for\r\ncollecting scientific specimens. He finished by asking me to go along\r\nand show him the strange country I had told him about. Of course I\r\nwanted to see Rennell Island again, but I secured an invitation from\r\nthe High Commission first, then wrote Mr. Crocker, “I’ll go willingly,\r\nif you’ll spot me around where I can inspect our work in the Solomons\r\nand make a tuberculin survey.” I also suggested that he bring an\r\nanthropologist along. He found the man and added a plant collector and\r\nan entomologist to the _Zaca_ party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was the way Eloisa’s eggs came to roost, if I may scramble a\r\nmetaphor. In a roundabout way they gave me a chance to revisit a spot\r\nwhich interested me more, perhaps, than anything I had seen in the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE SOLOMONS TO RENNELL\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me begin with a scrap from my diary of May 4, 1933. We had been on\r\nthe water three days, moving toward Vanikoro.\r\n\r\n ... We are a little crowded, but not too much. _Zaca_ is beautiful;\r\n 118 feet long, 23 feet beam, 125 tons, 22 tons lead on keel, draws\r\n just under 15 feet of water. I have had my share of fortune in\r\n vessels on survey trips and plenty of hard times ... now I blink,\r\n looking around me, and wonder if I’m awake. I should like to keep\r\n the daily menus, they are so varied and excellent. First night we\r\n had grilled steak, perfect; next night Long Island duckling, and I\r\n gorged--Christmas dinner every night. Always fresh vegetables, just\r\n like home (U. S., not Fiji). All Frosted Foods....\r\n\r\n Roomy cabin, electric fan over bunk, reading light over bed. Two\r\n bunks, one of which I use for scientific gear, a chiffonier and two\r\n drawers, under the bunk, which Malakai and I share, as well as a roomy\r\n clothes closet with hangers etc. I share Mr. Crocker’s elaborate\r\n bathroom with Maury. We eat on deck at two bridge tables under an\r\n awning, as the mainsail is not raised.\r\n\r\n ... Was somewhat worried, coming on this trip, for fear we might have\r\n to conform to millionaire standards of dress. This would have been\r\n cruelty to me and would have hindered, as it always does, the success\r\n of the work. On some small boats I have been on trips with Resident\r\n Commissioners who felt that they must uphold good old British prestige\r\n by putting on black coats and choker collars every night; I remember\r\n one who ran out of boiled shirts and had to eat in his stateroom to\r\n conceal his shame. But Crocker out-Herods Herod. _Lavalavas_ are the\r\n order of the day, and in the evening a singlet if it is too cool.\r\n Day and evening, Crocker wears a _lavalava_ or a very short pair of\r\n shorts--nothing else but a bandanna handkerchief around his neck....\r\n\r\nWe did not lack scientific equipment or scientific brains. Mr. Crocker\r\nand his secretary Maurice (Maury) Willowes collected specimens of\r\nanthropological and marine-life interest. Norton Stuart was a botanist,\r\nand Toschio Aseida a Japanese photographer of submarine and surface\r\nphenomena. Gordon Macgregor was an anthropologist from the Bishop\r\nMuseum, and our ship’s surgeon, Dr. John B. Hynes, did blood groupings\r\non the various islands we visited. This may sound like a hero list out\r\nof the “Iliad,” and I may add Homerically, “with me always were Gordon\r\nWhite and my long-tried henchman, Malakai Veisamasama.” Malakai found\r\nthe stateroom so comfortable that it rather surprised him. Between\r\nisland visits he sprawled on his bunk, always reading. It was usually\r\n_The Martyrdom of Man_, which I gave him once for a birthday present.\r\nHe carried it with him as you’d carry a Bible.\r\n\r\nThe _Zaca’s_ white crew had been mostly enlisted in California. The\r\nstewards were soft-footed and dextrous. When we sat under the awning\r\nof long, starlit evenings I had the impression of being on a crack\r\nocean liner. We had everything but an orchestra, but there was a\r\nphonograph wired throughout the _Zaca_, and a very powerful Morse\r\nstation of R.C.A.... No, this wasn’t real. I wasn’t the Lambert who had\r\nslapped mosquitoes in a Papuan whaleboat and been stranded on a New\r\nHebrides island, waiting for anything with steam-power or gas-power or\r\npaddle-power to take him off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wanted to see the Solomon Islands again, for my inspection in 1921\r\nhad been a hurry-up affair, at the whim of Lever Brothers’ busy island\r\ninspector. My visit to Tulagi in 1930 had been mostly directed toward\r\nRennell Island. In 1921 ill luck had kept me from seeing Malaita, the\r\nmost savage spot in the savage Solomons. On the Crocker trip Gordon\r\nWhite and I were equipped to make tuberculin tests, for little was\r\nknown of its prevalence in the group. Above all things, I was anxious\r\nto compare my new notes with my old ones. What had happened to the\r\nhealth of the islands I had seen twelve years ago? And what had\r\nhappened to Rennell Island in three years?\r\n\r\nIn the _Zaca’s_ comfortable lounge my only worry was that I might get\r\ntoo fat to waddle ashore, what with Mexican beer and a snack at 11\r\nA.M., cocktails and a snack before dinner, highballs and a snack in\r\nthe evening. Being by nature a sensualist, I had to pray to my Puritan\r\nforefathers to save me from myself until our ship touched the White\r\nSands.\r\n\r\nVisiting Tucopia, a dot on the southeast tip of the Solomons, I met\r\na problem almost unique in the Pacific--overpopulation. This island,\r\ntoo small to warrant a stop-over, was another Rennell in miniature,\r\nwith the same lake in the center. And the people who came paddling\r\nout in canoes were strikingly like Rennellese, perhaps more like the\r\ntribes of Bellona--more Melanesian than either. They had the same\r\nstyle of tapa breechclout, the same palm-fan sticking in the back,\r\nthe same way of knotting their hair. The Fijians have another island,\r\nThikombia (Tucopia in Fijian), which lies just north of Vanua Levu. It\r\nis undoubtedly one of the old steppingstones to this second Tucopia and\r\nRennell. The Tucopians whom we found here spoke a language with so much\r\nFijian in it that Malakai could speak a few words with them; he said\r\nthat they looked like the light-skinned tribe on Thikombia, who were\r\nsupposed to have come from Futuna.\r\n\r\nA native missionary informed us that “people were growing like weeds.”\r\nDistrict Officer Garvey had been there shortly before and wondered what\r\nto do with a race that was increasing faster than their food grew. For\r\nthis fertility the missions were responsible, indirectly; when they\r\ncame they said that every man should have a wife. Formerly only one\r\nson in the family was allowed to marry, the restriction being aimed\r\nat keeping the population within the bounds of subsistence. After\r\ntheir Christian teachers changed the rules Tukopia’s birth crop became\r\nembarrassing.... Well, that was something I couldn’t settle for them,\r\nexcept to suggest more recruiting for work on faraway plantations. That\r\nwouldn’t have been so practical, either, for the Tucopian had the same\r\nsavage home-love as his Rennellese cousin. I went away chuckling. Here\r\nwas a native race whom missionizing had increased. The men who came to\r\nour ship had a well-fed look. They seemed to be on the upgrade, though\r\novercrowding might endanger their future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe sailed toward Vanikoro, and saw Tinakula flaming across the sea, a\r\nvolcano that seemed to be in constant eruption. Black smoke obscured\r\nit, then winds would clear it so that we could look to its sharp\r\nsummit; at night it was a pillar of fire. Vanikoro, which lay beyond,\r\nhad a total population of ninety-five. It was a noteworthy illustration\r\nof the decay of native races. When the early voyager La Pérouse was\r\nwrecked there, the island teemed with people.\r\n\r\nWe saw the Duffs, where the dark people looked Melanesian and spoke\r\nPolynesian; Macgregor told me that they chewed their words so that he\r\ncouldn’t understand them. They scorned our tobacco because it was a\r\ngrade too good; it seemed that the Burns-Phillip store had sold Crocker\r\nsome of the better sort of rope-tobacco made by East Indians in Fiji.\r\nThe minute the natives smelled it they turned in disgust. They wanted\r\nthe rank trade tobacco made in America, and you couldn’t fool them with\r\na substitute. A disappointment to our anthropologists, when they tried\r\nto collect museum specimens on the Duffs, and got nothing....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe swung around to the little land I learned to love on my visit there\r\ntwelve years before. Sikiana with its three charming atolls, three\r\nlinks in a chain. I remembered its unspoiled, laughing Polynesians,\r\nits modest, pretty girls who had draped us with wreaths of flowers. I\r\nremembered its jolly, handsome men, who had been inoffensively drunk\r\nwith toddy the day we got there. I remembered the bearded patriarch\r\nwe had called Old Number One; I had thought of him as one who ruled\r\nonly by example in a pagan democracy which had no laws, no worries, no\r\ndebts, no crimes, no serious diseases. I was full of forebodings as our\r\nship neared a palm-fringed lagoon. What had happened to little Sikiana\r\nsince last I saw it?\r\n\r\nTwo canoes came out across the reef, and I recognized an old friend,\r\nLautaua, who had done me many favors on my last visit. We were glad to\r\nsee each other, and his pidgin was garrulous, describing his trips over\r\nmany waters during that dozen years. Most of the Sikiana men who had\r\nbeen our sailors on the Lever Brothers’ cruise had died or strayed away.\r\n\r\nAnd did I know what had happened? Well, the Melanesian Mission had come\r\nto their little Polynesia. Over the ten miles of soft lagoon Lautaua\r\ntold the story. How they had sent in preachers and teachers to improve\r\nthem. As Missioner-in-Chief a very black boy had come from Guadalcanar.\r\nHis name was Daniel Sande. At first the people would not join the\r\nChurch, and many were still holding out; but the Polynesian will yield\r\nto persuasion, if only for a show of politeness. Lautaua had offended\r\nBlack Daniel by moving to another island; then he got so homesick that\r\nhe came back, a shorn lamb, and found four black Melanesian teachers\r\nruling the roost for Lautaua’s proud, light-skinned neighbors and\r\nrelatives. I asked Lautaua his confidential view on the new religion.\r\nHe bowed his handsome head. “Master, some fellow he talk man die he\r\ncome back; me tink man he die he go along ground finish. He no come\r\nback. Me no go along school [catechism]. Me no go along water behind\r\n[baptism]. Me tink Story [Birth of Christ and miracles] he altogether\r\ngammon. Mission he spoil him altogether people.”\r\n\r\nSikiana, where once they had danced by the light of the moon, had a\r\nlook of dull propriety. Good heavens, there was a church! A conch\r\nshell sounded--and the Sikiana girls were filing in, dressed in\r\nwhite pinafores. Beside them marched sad-looking Sikiana men. It was\r\nedifying, it was shocking. Salvation had entered Paradise. Government\r\nhad entered, too, for here was the official shack where we were to bunk\r\nand try to eat the awful messes a native cook had thrown together.\r\nMalakai took one sniff at the mound of indigestibles, then he did what\r\nMalakai would. He shouldered out the cook and took over the saucepans.\r\nFor the rest of our stay there we ate wholesomely and well.\r\n\r\nThere was an undercurrent of discontent in Sikiana because a hurried\r\nGovernment Secretary had swooped down on them when Old Number One died\r\nand had asked in haste, “Who’s chief now?” An enterprising impostor\r\nnamed Tuana had presented himself and made a glib selling talk which\r\ngot him appointed in twenty minutes, more or less. The Honorable\r\nSecretary went back to his boat, too full of business to wait and\r\nfind out that he had broken Sikiana’s traditional line of chiefly\r\nsuccession. Such a miscarriage of justice is not characteristically\r\nBritish; but there are always puffy officials, meaning well and doing\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\nI learned about Black Daniel, who seemed to be a hard-bitten slaver\r\nin the name of the Lord. This was his day’s routine: Sound the conch\r\nat 6 A.M. for church; sound it a little later for the children’s\r\nschool; sound it again at ten for the bigger boys and girls; school\r\nfor grown-ups at 4 P.M., where the study was catechism; church again\r\nat 6 P.M., with much singing and a long, strong sermon. This was the\r\nweek-day program. Sunday, of course, furnished a constant grist for the\r\nmill that never ceased turning. When religious duties didn’t interfere\r\nthe inhabitants could work; but they weren’t working very hard. Sikiana\r\nwas getting lazy.\r\n\r\nWhen I had audience with Black Daniel I found him a big, smiling fellow\r\nwith a boil on his nose. Several Sikiana girls were fanning away the\r\nflies; these light-skinned damsels had the look of trained nurses who\r\ndidn’t much care for their assignment. Daniel had something of a Father\r\nDivine technique, a way of bursting into ecstatic patter, then coming\r\ndown to practical affairs. Quite an able man, I thought. He had a\r\nrecord of births and deaths by age and sex, which he had kept since he\r\ncame there three years ago. Also he had kept a census, very useful to\r\nme when I started to work.\r\n\r\nArcady had vanished under the heel of religio-totalitarianism. I\r\nwondered if the dark-browed missioners were “taking advantage” of the\r\npretty girls around them. But I found that this was not so. The girls\r\nwere looking out for that. They were too Polynesian not to shrink in\r\ndisdain from black-skinned lovers. Not that their hearts were as pure\r\nas the Bishop of Melanesia might have wished. They cast yearning eyes\r\ntoward our good-looking sailors; those were white men, and quite a\r\ndifferent matter. I heard one sailor speak softly to a pretty girl\r\nnamed Ana, who looked nervously toward the mission. “Master,” she said,\r\n“me fright too much come along you. Big Master Stop along Top he look\r\nalong night too.”\r\n\r\nOur sailor learned, however, that these affairs could be arranged\r\nthrough special dispensation from Black Daniel. If he liked you, and\r\nthe girl was a heathen, the church would bless the temporary mating.\r\nDaniel liked the sailor, so that was a granted privilege. However,\r\nthe romance fell unripened. When the couple decided that their love\r\nwas sanctified they were discouraged by a crowd which followed them\r\nconstantly. It was all very funny, and tragic. I wondered how long\r\nthese people would remain purely Polynesian. Their Melanesian teachers\r\nhad the Supernatural on their side, and the time would come, I thought,\r\nwhen the breed would become very mixed.\r\n\r\nPoor Old Number One, how his bearded ghost must have worried! A year\r\nbefore our visit a fanatical trader named Buchanan had run amuck and\r\nburned down all the heathen temples. Not only that, but a crew of\r\nJapanese pearl fishers had insisted on coming ashore. When the people\r\ntold them that they were not welcome, they turned a machine gun on a\r\nvillage and forced a landing. Machine-gunning islands seemed to be a\r\nJapanese habit. They stayed long enough to fish all the shell out of\r\nthe lagoon and quartered themselves in Lautaua’s house. When they left\r\nthey became generous, gave Lautaua 1,500 cigarettes, a toothbrush and\r\nan old pair of swimming goggles. He was clever enough to imitate the\r\nglasses with wood and scraps of windowpanes.\r\n\r\nPukena, the cook whom Malakai had discharged forthwith, but who\r\nremained as humble helper, told about Tuana, the misappointed chief.\r\nTuana was a grafter, and like many grafters, lazy. The Administration\r\nhad entrusted him with medicine for the people. When the sick applied\r\nfor help, Tuana would reply that his stock had all run out. In short,\r\nhe was keeping the good stuff for himself and his henchmen. Lautaua,\r\nbeing obviously the superior man on Sikiana, should have been entrusted\r\nwith these things.\r\n\r\nWe were there four days, all of us very busy except Crocker, who had a\r\nbadly infected foot.\r\n\r\nI had been carrying on wholesale injections of tuberculin, and had\r\nfound that the prevalence of tuberculosis was alarmingly high. On my\r\nfirst visit I had had only time to make sketchy tests, but certainly\r\nthe disease had gained great headway. Gordon White and I went over the\r\nwhole population. Lautaua, the religious rebel, blamed the missionaries\r\nfor the disease. Yet the population had made a satisfactory increase\r\nin the past twenty years; and that was hard to understand. There was\r\nplenty of malaria, and we were finding acute, unguarded pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis. Possibly the change in custom, brought in by the\r\nmissions, possibly added infections which may have resulted from\r\ncontact with them, or with the Japanese, might have resulted in the\r\nmany acute chests we saw. Or possibly it was due to the small amount of\r\nadditional clothing which had come in with the new way of living.\r\n\r\nThere had been almost no traders, and few foreign vessels came that\r\nway. But the very isolation of these atolls, plus Black Daniel’s\r\nscientific inadequacy, added to the weight of native ills. Among the\r\nplentiful mosquitoes we found the malaria carriers. One afternoon\r\nMalakai held out his bare arm and showed me a probing little insect.\r\n“She stands on her head when she feeds,” he said, “and she has spotted\r\nwings.” _Anopheles punctulatus_, sure little poisoner, conveying\r\ndisease from the sick to the well. It was impossible to get anything\r\nlike an adequate supply of quinine from Tulagi.\r\n\r\nLautaua in his own way described the symptoms and testified that\r\nmalaria was an old inhabitant. Did the sickness begin with a chill?\r\n“Oh, master, plenty too much.” Realistically he acted out a malaria\r\nchill. Had it been here long? “Yes, master, fader belong me, fader\r\nbelong him, all same.” Did the children have it too? “Small fellow, my\r\nwort! Him shake too much all same dis.” More synthetic chills. “Behind\r\n(after) him he hot too much; now water he come out all same rain.”\r\n\r\nTheir light contact with trading ships and their habit of using the\r\ntidewater for toilet purposes had saved them from hookworm. There were\r\nonly two cases of yaws, secondary and in children. The people called it\r\n_matona_ instead of _tona_, the usual Polynesian name. They said that\r\n_tona_ was an old-timer, but had died down. I saw no evidences of it\r\namong the adults.\r\n\r\nIn lighter vein let me tell you about Black Daniel’s other boil, for\r\nhe had developed a lusty carbuncle on his hip. I opened it with the\r\ncleverest instrument at hand, a razor blade; and with no anesthetic, of\r\ncourse. Daniel had no ambition to be a Christian martyr. It took four\r\nof his disciples to hold him down while I drained out the pus, and he\r\ncalled on his Saviour in the voice of a wounded lion.\r\n\r\nHis Sikiana flock was a contrast in stoicism. Their beautiful teeth\r\nwere going--ill-balanced diet, probably--and in one afternoon Malakai\r\nand I extracted thirty teeth. We had only straight forceps, and it\r\nwas a pretty mangling job; but we didn’t hear a moan during the whole\r\nordeal.\r\n\r\nLike all primitives, the people of Sikiana confused the diagnosis with\r\nthe cure; remember how the Cook Islanders had thought I could make them\r\nwell by putting a stethoscope on their chests? Tuberculin injections\r\nare merely given for negative or positive reactions. But to them the\r\nneedle was a sovereign remedy, and they always went away smiling. Only\r\nthe very young children objected when the point was jabbed under their\r\nskin. As to the others their faith was rather heartrending. It was the\r\nsame all over the Solomons.\r\n\r\nAfter the boil operation Black Daniel so far relented as to let\r\nhis congregation dance for us, with the beautiful old-fashioned\r\nabandon--but with plenty of clothes on. It was the first time in three\r\nyears that they had been allowed to revert to this pretty, jolly\r\npaganism. Before our otter boat pulled us back to the _Zaca_, Daniel\r\nand his three dusky assistants occupied four chairs and consented to\r\nbe photographed. Gathered around them a group of Sikiana girls in\r\nwhite pinafores and white capes looked for all the world like tropical\r\nGirl Scouts. Templeton Crocker, suffering from a lame foot and feeling\r\nsatirical, watched the photographic group, a drift of snow with a\r\nbucket of coal in the middle. “The Four Black Crows,” he said, thinking\r\nof a popular vaudeville team. But the holy dictator and his followers\r\nwere speeding us on our way with “God be with you till we meet again.”\r\n\r\nGod be with Sikiana, I thought glumly. For twelve years that little\r\nplace had been one of the pets of my memory. I decided that it would\r\nneed a hustling Native Medical Practitioner, if anything was to be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe interrupted our work and turned back to Tulagi. Dr. Hynes had\r\nreported that Toschio, our Japanese photographer, was so ill that he\r\nneeded hospital attention. Crocker’s sore foot had caused a friendly\r\ndisagreement between Hynes and me. Before he reached Suva, the _Zaca’s_\r\nowner had scratched his foot on some submerged coral. He had pluckily\r\nsaid nothing about it until the infection had begun heating up. As a\r\nyoung graduate of New York’s Presbyterian Hospital, Dr. Hynes might\r\nhave been a bit more interested in major operations than in minor\r\nbruises. But I had seen many coral scratches and knew that they could,\r\nif neglected, prove as stubbornly hard to cure as a gastric ulcer.\r\n\r\nAt Tulagi--in the humble little capital, very neat and British--we ran\r\ninto a mess of colonial politics. My very good friend J. C. Barley,\r\nwho had won the general approval of the High Commission and had\r\naided the natives in so many kindly ways that they thought of him as\r\n“Government,” had been sidetracked again. Captain Ashley had come back\r\nas Resident Commissioner, and that had left Barley, the obvious choice,\r\nout in his small post on Auki; Barley, who knew more about the customs,\r\nlanguage and social traditions of the people than any white man who had\r\never lived on the Solomons; Barley, whose affection for the natives was\r\nfatherly, and who had devoted his splendid life to them.\r\n\r\nAt last I got around to see Captain Ashley, who had been so kind\r\nabout helping me on my first Rennell trip and had sent out a relief\r\nboat to find me. What I wanted to talk about more than anything else\r\nwas Solomon Island candidates for our Central Medical School. We had\r\ntwo native practitioners working on the group. Dr. Hetherington,\r\nthe C.M.O., had only one white physician whom he could put in the\r\nfield. There were a few medical missionaries, some of them very\r\ngood--especially those of the Melanesian Mission, which had a leper\r\nasylum of sorts on Malaita.\r\n\r\nHow about getting some more Solomon Island students into our school at\r\nSuva? Well, the Protectorate was about broke--stony truth--and even our\r\nsmall tuition would be burdensome. Norman Wheatley of New Georgia had\r\nsent his two sons, Trader Kuper of Santa Ana was educating his older\r\nboy, Geoffrey, in a New Zealand school. Geoffrey seemed especially\r\nbright, and ought to make a fine N.M.P.\r\n\r\nI reminded Captain Ashley of how I had first looked those boys over,\r\nback in 1921. Norman Wheatley, retired blackbirder, had settled\r\nsedately on Roviana Lagoon, where he had married a native woman.\r\nHis early adventures should have made him rich, but a ruling vice\r\nhad reduced his surplus to near the vanishing point. His vice was\r\ncollecting prize-winning small craft in Sydney. All around the lagoon\r\nwere his ancient yachts, racing schooners and launches, rotting away\r\nfor lack of use and attention. Wheatley’s sons were pretty small then,\r\nbut he had listened to me when I said that he ought to make doctors out\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nTrader Kuper was then living on Santa Ana with his native wife, a\r\nfine woman who had posed for my camera in her tribal costume. Her two\r\nboys, the older not more than four, were running wild on the beach,\r\nabsolutely naked. The mother was bare from the top of her head to the\r\nwaistband of her _lavalava_; around her neck were shark’s teeth, and\r\na long pencil of polished shell ran through the septum of her nose.\r\nTenderly she picked the children up and told me that they were nice\r\nboys, but not strong. I had found that they had hookworm, and I delayed\r\nmy departure to dose them with chenopodium. When I left I had given\r\nMrs. Kuper instructions as to further treatment. I saw Mr. Kuper a few\r\nyears later and he told me that they had grown to be fine husky kids,\r\nand he was grateful because we had saved their lives. I had reminded\r\nhim, as I had Norman Wheatley, that his sons ought to go to Suva and\r\nstudy medicine.\r\n\r\nWell, so young Geoffrey Kuper was studying in New Zealand. Certainly he\r\nwould be an ideal candidate for the Medical School, Ashley said.\r\n\r\nAgain I heard the old story of benevolent Dr. Fox of the Melanesian\r\nMission. Earnestly wishing to help the natives and to understand them,\r\nFox specialized in ethnology. In order to put himself in closer touch\r\nwith native family ways, he offered to change lives with Joni, one of\r\nhis dark parishioners. Joni agreed to change his name to Dr. Fox; Dr.\r\nFox to become Joni. The real Dr. Fox handed the real Joni his bankbook\r\nand so on, while the metamorphosed clergyman moved into the native\r\nhouse and took over all the family with all the duties, except the\r\nintimate matrimonial ones. He didn’t learn much, because the natives\r\nremained secretive. The French farce situation became intolerable when\r\nthe simon-pure Fox discovered that his counterfeit had been strutting\r\nall over the island using Dr. Fox’s name and prestige so successfully\r\nthat there were many newborn infants being called “Dr. Fox.” So\r\n_lavalava_ was immediately exchanged for clerical garb, and all bets\r\nwere off. That was a classic yarn around Tulagi, but still good for a\r\nwicked smile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe coasted down the shore of Malaita, a great hulk of mountainous\r\nwoods 110 miles long, beautiful and forbidding. When I had covered\r\nthe Solomons in 1921 a convenient hurricane had beaten us away from\r\nthe shore. This island held a horrid fascination. Twelve years ago no\r\nwhite man had dared the interior jungles, and there was still little\r\nknowledge of its wild hill tribes. The splendid black Malaitamen were\r\ngood workers, when you could get them. Recruiters, there to pick up\r\nfield hands for the plantations, always worked in pairs; wise laws of\r\nthe Protectorate compelled them to do so, for bloody experience had\r\nproved the necessity of armed caution.\r\n\r\nThe luxurious _Zaca_ skirted the savagery of Malaita, which the\r\nSpaniards called “Mala” for short; and it was “Bad” to them, as ghastly\r\nstories reveal. Over there lay Sinarango where Tax Collector Bell with\r\nCadet Lilies and fourteen native police had been butchered in 1927.\r\nThere were some missionaries, planters and traders scattered along the\r\ncoastline. The spread of disease was diminishing the Malaitamen, and my\r\nobject in visiting them would be to learn, if possible, the role played\r\nby tuberculosis. Also I was keen to look over the Melanesian Mission’s\r\nleper establishment, for I had been told that about one per cent of\r\nMalaita’s population was afflicted.\r\n\r\nAround Malaita are many artificial islands, time-old and mysterious as\r\nthe people who inhabit them. A long native canoe, with no outrigger,\r\nlanded us on one of them, about three acres built of huge coral-chunks\r\nthat had been planted on the reef and filled in with soil and rubble.\r\nDr. Macgregor pointed out children with bright yellow hair; no, it\r\nhadn’t been sunburned to that color, or bleached with lime to destroy\r\nlice. This was natural hair. When we examined a grown girl’s hair down\r\nat the roots, where the sun could never reach it, the color was almost\r\nas yellow as straw. There were gray eyes, too, flashing out of dark\r\nbrown faces. Gray eyes are often found among Polynesians who have had\r\nno intimate contact with Europeans. But these were no Polynesians. They\r\nwere almost as dark as the other Solomon Islanders.\r\n\r\nWhite and Malakai and I had all day ashore at Tai Harbor, lining up\r\nhundreds for tuberculin tests. I was aboard ship again when I learned\r\nthat my much-admired friend J. C. Barley was at Tai on inspection. When\r\nI told Crocker about Barley my host suggested that I go ashore and ask\r\nhim to dinner on the _Zaca_. That was a pleasant assignment, for I must\r\nhave a talk with the man who knew his natives inside and out.\r\n\r\nHe came around the side of a leaf-house, cool, clean and physically\r\nfit. Shaking hands, I knew that he was glad to see me again, as I was\r\nto see him. Yes, the Solomons were in a bit of a jam and all that, he\r\nsaid, and a jolly good thing, Lambert, that you’re looking over our\r\ntuberculosis. He spoke with gratitude, as though I had been treating\r\nhim personally. That was Barley all over, responsible for every man,\r\nwoman and child under his care. He had been District Commissioner for\r\nMalaita--splendid job. There were over 50,000 natives on Malaita, and\r\nwe must have treated nearly 40,000 of them for prevalent diseases. Not\r\nthat they wouldn’t stand a lot more of it. Naturally those wild fellows\r\nup in the hills weren’t so tubercular as the coast dwellers, he said,\r\nbut they’d bear looking over. The news had spread to them that the\r\nwhite doctors jabbed them with a needle. They were all crazy for the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nBarley was going to be married; nice Australian girl--he hoped she\r\nwouldn’t be lonely out here. (As if anybody could be lonely with him.)\r\nHe had just gotten back from Rennell Island, he said, and had brought\r\nBuia with him. Buia! Sure enough, there was Buia, somewhat disguised\r\nin a pair of shorts, but the same muscular hunky figure. We didn’t rub\r\nnoses this time, but shook hands, European style. Buia was becoming a\r\nman of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd how was Rennell? Well, said Barley, what had happened there might\r\nhave sounded funny, only it was rather terrible. Too many visiting\r\nships, of course, with Tahua’s charming girls to lure them into the\r\nWhite Sands. But there was something much worse. The Seventh Day\r\nAdventist outfit had gotten at them, rather. Pastor Borgas landed\r\non the White Sands and informed the Big Masters that they had come\r\nto “teach” them. “You know,” said Barley, “how crazy the Rennellese\r\nare to learn English. They thought teaching meant just that. When\r\nthe Adventists taught them to say ‘Me want skula’--meaning ‘We want\r\na school’--they didn’t know that school was the Adventist word for\r\nbatches of New Testament and vegetarian diet. Old Testament for a\r\npeople living in an age that’s older than Isaac and Rebecca; vegetarian\r\ndiet for a race that’s starving for meaty proteins! Well, before Mr.\r\nBorgas went home he gave strips of white cloth for Tahua and Taupangi\r\nto wear; white arm bands with ‘M.V.’ marked on them in big black\r\nletters.”\r\n\r\n“What’s ‘M.V.’?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Mission Volunteer,” said Barley with a wry smile.\r\n\r\nI let out a whoop. Imagine those archaic and bearded kings strutting\r\naround with Mission Volunteer on their arms!\r\n\r\nBut Barley couldn’t see the comic side. Neither could I after he told\r\nme the rest. “When Taupangi and Tahua found out what those cranks had\r\nbeen up to, they flew into a rage and vowed that no missionary should\r\never again come within bow-shot of their island. I say, this thing is\r\nbreeding trouble. Next thing you know they’ll be killing off another\r\nparcel of Christian teachers. Then there’ll be hell to pay. I don’t\r\nwant to see a punitive expedition go into Rennell Island and hang a lot\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\nBarley seemed to be reading my thoughts when he said: “If I had my\r\nway I’d put a reliable N.M.P. or two on that island, with plenty of\r\nmedicine. And I’d keep everybody else out, except scientists, maybe.\r\nYou won’t find the people in as good condition as they were when you\r\nsaw them last. Sea-changes are very sudden in the Pacific.”\r\n\r\nSo Barley went back with me to the _Zaca_. It was one of Crocker’s\r\ncompany dinners--grilled steak which had come frosted from Montana, and\r\n1922 Perrier-Jouët. Barley was answering a shower of questions. The\r\nMalaita warriors, he said, were Proper Men, and took no nonsense from\r\nanybody. They didn’t know how to lie. When you asked them how many they\r\nhad killed they either told you that it was none of your business, or\r\ncandidly counted over the murders to their credit....\r\n\r\nUnder softly shaded table lamps our stewards were delicately pouring\r\nvintage wine. Right over there, blacker than the darkness, lay\r\nMalaita....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith Gordon White and Malakai I went to the leper colony at Quaibaita.\r\nI knew that leprosy, of comparatively recent importation, ran about\r\none per cent on Malaita. Whenever colonists mentioned the Melanesian\r\nMission doctors, they usually said, “Wonderful work!” I was not\r\ndisappointed when I saw the mission colony, order in the midst of\r\ngreen chaos: a hospital and church built of concrete, and the leper\r\ninstitution set a little too near for safety. The Empire Leper\r\nAssociation subsidized them for drugs, the Protectorate furnished\r\nsome medical supplies and a tiny dole for food. I was astonished at\r\nfirst when I found that two of their orderlies were arrested cases\r\nof leprosy; then I realized the stringent economy under which these\r\ndevoted men and women must work in order to keep their mission\r\nenterprise on its feet. Educated and gently reared, they slaved out\r\ntheir lives in genuine Christian cheerfulness. Some of them, I fancied,\r\nhad not had a square meal for years.\r\n\r\nI had lunch with them. If they had been French priests they would have\r\ngathered a delicious meal somewhere out of the jungle, for that’s\r\nFrench genius. Here the missioners chatted gaily over the poor things\r\nthat came on the table. I knew it was the very best they had, for we\r\nwere their guests.\r\n\r\nThe doctors and the nursing sisters told me that it was hard to suit\r\nMalaitamen, when they got a notion in their heads--which was most\r\nof the time. The mission here was treating 73 lepers, but they had\r\nhad as high as 147. Many of them were out-patients; that is to say\r\nthey preferred to live in their own village, about a mile away. They\r\ndropped in for treatment about when they felt like it; or else just\r\nwandered away. The Melanesian Mission was trying to get a law passed\r\nthat would compel lepers to stay put. Natives loved everything that was\r\ntreated with the “needle,” but they couldn’t be cured with two or three\r\ninjections, as they could for yaws. The leprosy treatment took a great\r\ndeal of time, and after a couple of injections the Malaitaman would say\r\nto his brothers, “What the hell? This fellow’s magic isn’t working.”\r\n\r\nAll this was uphill for the brave medical missionaries. My only\r\nsuggestion was that the leper establishment was too near the “clean”\r\nhospital, where they were treating a little of everything else. And it\r\nlooked tricky to me, having a leper acting as head warder. The obvious\r\nthing to say was: Round them up and send them to Mokogai. But that\r\nwould have been out of the question for a government whose finances\r\nwere already strained. Without going into figures, it would have cost\r\nthe Protectorate a large share of its revenue, if they had gone to\r\nthe expense of shipping away an estimated 950 lepers. Add to that the\r\nphysical impossibility of taking the sick away from regions so wild\r\nthat the Government itself did not dare to penetrate; regions where\r\nfierce savages were warring, tribe against tribe, and the white man an\r\nhereditary enemy. It was just another tragedy of European rule over a\r\nnative race.\r\n\r\nAround the Quaibaita Mission Station I wish to put a bright red mark of\r\napproval. Striving against heavy odds, it has done the Lord’s work in\r\na practical way, and every year it has shown improvement. Its workers,\r\nkeeping body and soul together on forty pounds a year, reveal the\r\nmissionary at his classic best: a civilizer, a healer and a defender of\r\nthe helpless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had been injecting around Tai Harbor, and our technique was so\r\npopular that it drew wild men from the hills many miles away. Our\r\nneedles wore out and our fingers grew stiff from puncturing the skin\r\nof hundreds who applied, clamoring for “neela” (needle). A tuberculin\r\ntest, to prove anything, required two applications and two inspections,\r\nfive days in all. The difficulty was to get the people back for the\r\nsecond injection and the last inspection, and I was fascinated by\r\nGordon White’s orations in lively pidgin. “This big fellow doctor along\r\nFiji, him he come dis time for giving nother kind neela. Now dis nother\r\nkind neela, him for stop dis sick along coughie where some fellow he\r\nspit blut....” And in the elaborate roundabouts he was telling them\r\nthat they’d had their two injections, but must be back at the “house\r\ntakis” (tax house) for the third inspection on Tuesday. The heavy rate\r\nof tuberculosis, shown in fierce reactions, made it quite obvious\r\nthat Malaita needed a tuberculosis sanitarium. That, considering the\r\nProtectorate’s finances, would have been no more available than a\r\ngeneral roundup of lepers.\r\n\r\nOur investigations, I hope, threw some light on the prevalence of\r\ntuberculosis. Those we examined on Tai Lagoon ran over 77 per cent\r\ninfection. Those we were able to get from the bush village showed 60\r\nper cent. The very unpopular officials who had gone out to collect\r\nthe head tax reported that taxpayers on Malaita had fallen from\r\n14,000 to 10,000 in a decade. Since the Solomon Islands plantations\r\nrelied on Malaita for nearly three quarters of their plantation\r\nlabor, this falling off was disastrous. Run the gamut of diseases,\r\nfrom tuberculosis to ringworm, and you have the medical problem that\r\nfaced the land-poor Protectorate. The only salvation--I must repeat\r\nmyself--would be to send the largest possible number of native students\r\nto study medicine in Suva. That time was coming, I felt sure, for my\r\nSchool was beginning to draw a deep breath.\r\n\r\nWhile we worked ashore Templeton Crocker remained a true sportsman,\r\nenjoying himself as best a temporary cripple could. For weeks he sat\r\non deck, his sore foot propped up on a chair, and had the vicarious\r\npleasure of hearing what the doctors and anthropologists and other\r\n-ologists had been doing on their expeditions. For an active and\r\nadventurous man it must have been torment. The foot was improving, very\r\nslowly as a neglected infection must in a damp, hot climate. Now and\r\nthen, when British residents invited us for tea or cocktails, Crocker\r\nwould get himself into the sedan chair Dr. Hetherington had given him,\r\nand be carried ashore. Sitting aloft with four black men lifting the\r\npoles, Crocker looked for all the world like a Roman proconsul on his\r\nway to a banquet or a temple, or wherever proconsuls went.\r\n\r\nFor hours he would sit on deck, listening to Buia’s descriptions of\r\nRennell Island and his reasons for not liking Adventist missionaries.\r\n“Fish he tabu; meat he tabu; walk about he tabu; tobacco he tabu;\r\naltogether along dis fellow he tabu.” Crocker, a confirmed hater of\r\ntabus, was sympathetic, and liked to hear Buia declare that Mr. Borgas,\r\nwho had tacked “M.V.” on the arms of Tahua and Taupangi, might have\r\nfooled those old men, but he hadn’t fooled Buia for a second. He well\r\nremembered what Mr. Hamlin and Dr. Lambert had said about them: “That\r\nmission he altogether no good along Mungava.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTempleton Crocker had gone to the greatest pains and expense to\r\norganize this expedition. All along the way he had been annoyed by a\r\nquaint turn in customs regulations, which suddenly whimmed to charge\r\nduties on a little of everything. Never before had the _Zaca_ been\r\nbothered that way by a British Colony. We were out serving the High\r\nCommission by invitation and deserved the freedom of the port.\r\nHowever, you never can tell which way island politics are going to turn.\r\n\r\nThose of us working ashore had our basket of troubles also, and trouble\r\non Malaita means that you’d better run for your life.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, tuberculin tests take five days. We inject one day,\r\nthen skip a day, and on the third inject the cases found negative with\r\na stronger solution; then we skip another day and on the fifth get our\r\nfinal negative cases--those thought not to have an infection and never\r\nto have had one. A positive reaction, showing that a person has, or\r\nhas had, tuberculosis, is revealed by a small and slightly raised pink\r\ncircle around the site of injection. The confused natives thought that\r\nthe pink circle was the desirable thing, and they would strut proudly\r\naway to show their friends. It was very difficult to make the final\r\nnegatives understand that they had had the full works--for where was\r\nthe pink spot they were after?\r\n\r\nWell, we had been at it four days, and the course was almost over. Then\r\nwho should show up but several native teachers with a note from the\r\nSeventh Day Adventist white missionary, asking us to inject his people.\r\nWe knew that we wouldn’t have time to finish the five-day job, but a\r\nsingle injection to the new lot might prove something. Also one always\r\nwants to sustain a white man’s authority before the natives, and it\r\nwouldn’t do to refuse this request. Remember, the Malaitamen thought\r\nthat our tests were a cure, for God knows what--tuberculosis or leprosy\r\nor yaws, it was all about the same, so long as they got the magic\r\n“neela.” No, one jab wouldn’t do them any harm; it might buck them up\r\nspiritually. So on that sophistry, we decided to inject the Adventist’s\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nTo complicate matters, we had been obliged to refuse injections to the\r\nmultitude of natives who had come after the first day, and they were\r\npretty sullen about it. Who could blame them, considering their long\r\ntrudge over mountaintops, probably without food? They gathered around\r\nus with black scowls, inwardly wondering why if five days did a lot\r\nof good, four or three wouldn’t do _some_ good, anyhow. Then the word\r\ngot around that we were making an exception in favor of the Adventist\r\ncrowd--and things started to boil.\r\n\r\nNewcomers had been flocking in daily, and in front of our “house takis”\r\nthere was a jam almost as far as one could see: black, ugly faces,\r\ndetermined to have their share of injections, if we started another\r\nlot. We had already tested about 1,500, and eight native policemen had\r\nguarded us every minute of the time. They changed guard every hour,\r\nwith impressive swinging of rifles, always with fixed bayonets. I was\r\nsoon to realize good old Barley’s common sense in sending them along\r\nunder John White’s direction, for John knew his job.\r\n\r\nBut here we were on a tough spot. I had promised to inject the\r\nAdventist’s natives. Looking around at the angry black men, crowding in\r\non us, I changed my mind. Not only did we have to save our own skins,\r\nbut if the mob set on us the Adventist converts would be the first to\r\ngo. I had thought that the native police were a joke, until I saw them\r\nspring into line. I yelled to an interpreter, “Tell the Adventists that\r\nwe haven’t got time!”\r\n\r\nHe told them. Arms flourished and waved and there was a deafening\r\nracket from a thousand husky throats. “Neela! Neela! Me want im neela!”\r\nThe noise was so great that John White had to shout in my ear, “Better\r\ngive it to them. Just jab them any way, never mind if it doesn’t\r\nmean anything. If you don’t treat them all, and the mission natives\r\nespecially, they’ll certainly kill the lot of us.” I stood my ground\r\nwith nothing more defensive than a hypodermic syringe. Maybe it was\r\nlong medical discipline that made me shake my head; I wasn’t going to\r\nwaste a batch of expensive tuberculin on any wholesale fake. “What have\r\nwe got an armed guard for?” I asked.\r\n\r\nMuch to my surprise the native police began doing their duty. With\r\nbayonets leveled they formed a rough cordon between us and the mass of\r\nhowling hill-fellows. Then we stood not upon the manner of our beating,\r\nbut beat it at once, an undignified scramble into the otter boat and\r\na frantic paddling back to the ship. A bedlam of threatening yells\r\nfollowed us out to sea.\r\n\r\nWhen I found Crocker resting his foot on deck he asked me what sort of\r\nmob scene we had been pulling over there. I told him that it was the\r\nkind of melodrama most explorers were looking for, but I didn’t care\r\nfor it. I was sweating freely, very cold sweat for so warm a day. It\r\nreminded me, I said, of what Winston Churchill once told a certain\r\nCommissioner from a certain Pacific island group, who came back to\r\nLondon to explain a lot of things. Churchill was Colonial Secretary\r\nthen and the Commissioner was an old friend. “Winston,” said the\r\nCommissioner, “they accuse me of keeping women.” “But Charles, my dear\r\nboy,” said Winston, “why shouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\nI was in trouble with Malaita, but why I shouldn’t be was an open\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToo often on that voyage I was forced to say “I told you so,” comparing\r\nwhat I saw with what I had seen twelve years before. Stevenson’s\r\n“Drink and the devil had done for the rest” might have been transposed\r\ninto “Disease and the traders.” Casual islands, where casual ships\r\ndropped in and the people had no moral barriers against strangers, were\r\nobviously on the downgrade. In 1921, when we had made an overnight\r\nsurvey around Star Harbour, my medical mind had worried over the\r\ncarefree sex-generosity of the women there. It was none of my business\r\nthat, according to native custom, young men hired their fiancées out\r\nlong enough to earn a marriage dowry. That was the fashion, and there\r\nseemed to be no ill results--so long as they confined their promiscuity\r\nto their own tribesmen. Their freedom with visiting sailors, black,\r\nwhite or yellow, caused me to foresee what I found there in 1933. That\r\nhorrid visitor, venereal granuloma, had come to play and stayed to\r\nkill. A Chinaman, they said, had brought it there. Life was shortening,\r\nthe birth rate was almost nil. The abundant missionaries were doing\r\nwhat they could to curb immorality. What they could do wasn’t much.\r\nStar Harbour was too good a trading station to keep away from.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the _Zaca_ lay at anchor in the colored waters of Mohawk Bay\r\nI came upon the end of a short story which had taken twelve years\r\nto tell. It was here, you remember, that back in 1921 I had given a\r\nmidnight hookworm lecture, in what I thought was a mission village;\r\nafter the lecture I was resting in a whaleboat near the beach when a\r\nnaked man, darker than the darkness, had waded out to me and told me\r\nthat he was Sam, a mission teacher; and his lively pidgin had informed\r\nme of my mistake--that I had gone to a heathen village; his was the\r\nChristian community, where I should have lectured in the name of the\r\nLord. So I had given him a number of tins, told him what to say in his\r\nlecture, and asked him to bring me the specimens in the morning, and he\r\nhad obeyed. Poor devil, like so many others, he had thought his people\r\nwould be cured merely by filling the tins. He was foolish, but a true\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\nWell, as Templeton Crocker’s luxury yacht now idled in this bay a\r\nmissionary came aboard with a number of natives. One of them kept\r\ncrouching close to my chair, and I recognized him. He was Sam the\r\nChristian. “So you’re still the mission teacher here,” I said. “No,\r\nmaster,”--softly,--“you talk along me that night in whaleboat, but me\r\nno mission.” I liked the old rascal, and spent a day with him, looking\r\nover his village and getting at the truth of his story, which was just\r\nthis: When he had waded out to my boat with the Christian yarn, he had\r\nbeen a pagan, living among pagans; he had come to me with his pious\r\nline of talk because, he explained, the heathens never got any plums\r\nfrom the whites; plums all went to the missionized ones. His people had\r\nhookworm, and he didn’t care what he said so long as he got the cure.\r\n\r\nSam was goodfellow too much, so I gave him some more lessons in\r\nhookworm treatment and some drugs to help out. He was still a heathen,\r\nhe told me, although the native teacher had marked him for an extremely\r\nhot Eternity....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much for scenes revisited, and all not happy ones. We had weighed\r\nanchor and were churning out to sea, heading now once more toward\r\nRennell Island. I had seen the mischief done in gentle Sikiana and in\r\nother unprotected places. What had happened to Rennell? Buia, coming\r\nhome with us, said some disturbing things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF A RACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain the great coral wall with its skimpy crown of trees; again the\r\nmysterious crack in the cliffs that marked Kungava Bay. Buia, who had\r\nacquired malaria on his trip, had been running a temperature all night.\r\nHe was quite normal now, but excited. His eyes glistened, his white\r\nteeth shone as he pointed out familiar landmarks. Over there was Ungu\r\nUngu (Head Head) point. He had a place there, but no house; the piece\r\nof land he had inherited from his father’s line. On Kanava he had\r\nthree pieces of land and a fine, big house. Yes, Buia had improved a\r\nlot since last night, when he had mourned, “Belly belong me he no good\r\nkaikai belong white man. Now me no look him Kanava again.” Part of that\r\ndepression was malaria, the rest sea-sickness, for the ship had rolled\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\nCanoes began pulling out toward us. Friends were coming aboard, and the\r\nforemost among them was Buia the Bastard, full of news, because the\r\nBig Master of Mengehenua was dead. God, who was “Master along Sky,”\r\nhad cursed the chief for neglecting to send him gifts of food. Another\r\nBig Master had also forgotten his God, and was pretty sick. “Sick\r\nbelong wind, him he too cold.” Whether he was describing influenza or\r\ntuberculosis it was hard to say.\r\n\r\nAfter we had anchored inside the reef and come ashore we were permitted\r\nto approach Tahua, whom we found seated in state on a soapbox. On\r\nbehalf of Mr. Crocker I made a presentation speech and laid an adze, a\r\nstring of red beads, two razor blades and a butcher knife before the\r\nPresence. Tahua said simply, “Thank you.” The men of Rennell have no\r\ntaste for the echo-ringing oratory of Samoa and Tonga.\r\n\r\nBecause it was raining, Tahua took us to his “house,” merely a tiny\r\nshelter, open at one end. “House him all bugger up,” he apologized,\r\nand showed a pile of beams cleverly hewn with the axes we had left on\r\nour former trip; all ready for the grand new architectural effect he\r\nwas planning, to be Rennell’s show place, and to Tahua the largest\r\nbuilding in the world. There was a ridgepole thirty-five feet long and\r\nseveral curved ribs to support the sloping pandanus-leaf roof. Tahua\r\nwas getting to be a very rich man.\r\n\r\nHe was nobody’s fool. When I told him about the needles we wanted to\r\nuse for the good of the people he understood and said that he would\r\nsummon many for the stick-medicine. Shrewdly he added that when so\r\nmany came around he could put them to work building his new house. He\r\nobliged Macgregor, there to inquire into racial origins, by reciting\r\ntwenty-four generations of his ancestors and scraps of mouth-to-mouth\r\nhistory which, I think, had been garbled by European recorders. He\r\ntold us that all the people of his district were blood kin, related to\r\nhim. A common ancestor had come from Uvea (Wallis Island, directly to\r\nthe west) and had crossed Rotumah and the Solomons. Tahua’s history,\r\nliberally salted with myth and demonology, might have been partly\r\nauthentic. Undoubtedly all the Rennellese were first or second cousins;\r\na picture of an inbred people who were far from physically degenerate.\r\nTheir tabu against incestuous unions was so strict that brother and\r\nsister were not allowed to take medicine out of the same glass.\r\n\r\nMacgregor, who talked with Tahua whenever he could, told me that the\r\nBig Master had named a great many of the islands where his ancestor had\r\ntouched on his long voyage to Rennell. This was interesting, but threw\r\nno light on the racial origin. Their language was so nearly Polynesian\r\nthat Macgregor could piece out whole sentences; his Polynesian was so\r\nlike their own tongue that the people thought that he must have come\r\nfrom Rotumah, and took it for granted that he knew much more than he\r\ndid of their customs and theogony. For this reason they showed him many\r\nsacred places hidden in the bush, forbidden to all but the initiate.\r\n\r\nTahua was grimly silent about Mr. Borgas, the missionary who had tagged\r\nhim “M.V.,” but when the inhabitants came crowding into our ship we\r\nsoon found that the missionary scandal was the biggest news that had\r\nbroken on Rennell since the day of the famous murder. Superficially\r\nthese natives had not changed much, except that they spoke more pidgin\r\nand had somehow lost their light-fingered habit of carrying away every\r\nlittle thing they happened to fancy. Already the girls were approaching\r\nthe personable members of our crew, and by their clamorous “Me want\r\nknifie” and “Me want akis (axe)” it was plain to see that the price of\r\nlove had gone up. Razor blades were coming in, so empty beer bottles\r\nhad lost their market value.\r\n\r\nIn all his wide travel Crocker had never seen anything like the\r\nRennellese. Aside from their racial oddity, he said, they were the\r\nfriendliest people he had yet encountered. I mentioned a doctor\r\nI once knew who was so darned sociable--always poking me with a\r\ntoothbrush--that I learned to dislike him. Crocker didn’t understand my\r\nsimile--then. Later on he did.\r\n\r\nOne big man, kneeling beside my table, talked volubly about missionary\r\nBorgas. He called him “Bawgus” as in the tone in which you’d mention\r\nsome unmentionable disease. Bawgus had baited the hook by asking them\r\naboard ship--“You like lookim along shippie?” So they looked along\r\nshippie. “Then he go ashore he putim tabu along shippie.” Mr. Borgas\r\nhadn’t offered any tribute to Tahua, either in the way of food or\r\ntobacco. The only thing he had to offer gratis was Salvation--and\r\n“M.V.” armbands.... My faith in Rennell was somewhat renewed when the\r\nkneeling man beside me said, “Mission he come, Master he finish. Big\r\nMaster along Sky he finish too.” Meaning, in plain English, that if\r\nRennell became missionized its past would vanish; and they were on the\r\nalert.\r\n\r\nI hope I haven’t satirized the friendliness of these people. Their\r\ngenerosity surpassed anything I have seen anywhere, the Cook Islands\r\nnot excepted. They may have seemed overeager in grasping for the things\r\nthey wanted--mostly things of steel; but in their trades they gave\r\naway the best they had, and with the faith of little children. I was\r\nfairly sickened by the sight of their carefree swapping with some of\r\nour crew--precious heirlooms for a few cigarettes or a tin rattle. I\r\nsaw one beautifully carved and polished ebony “Big Master’s stick”--a\r\nroyal scepter to them--go to a sailor for a penny stick of rank twist.\r\nThe sailor wanted the stick, and the owner just couldn’t refuse. There\r\nwere many fine museum pieces frittered away like that. Why argue about\r\nthe price, when visitors were so pleasant?\r\n\r\nFrom a doctor’s point of view, the traffic in women was still more\r\ndiscouraging. Tahua, as a mark of extreme favor, offered me his\r\ndaughter, although, he explained, she was promised to Buia the Bastard.\r\nWhen I informed him that I was married and had a “mary” of my own, he\r\nlistened respectfully; I’m sure he didn’t know what that had to do with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor several nights the parties in the forecastle went on at a furious\r\npace; they kept it up until Crocker showed the sailors that he was boss\r\nof the _Zaca_ and would allow no visitors aboard after six o’clock.\r\nIn the riotous period that led up to the ultimatum I found one deck\r\nhand solemnly scrubbing a native beauty with a piece of brown soap and\r\nrinsing her at the end of a hose. It was probably the first real bath\r\nshe ever had; I was surprised at the lightness of her skin, which would\r\nmatch that of the purest Polynesian.\r\n\r\nWhen I had come there on the _France_, we jaunty explorers were all\r\nso dirty that we had somewhat deadened our sense of smell. But fresh\r\nfrom the luxurious cleanliness of the _Zaca_, I was conscious of the\r\nprevalent B.O. of Rennell. It took some tact for me to remind Buia that\r\nwhat he needed was a bath. He received the news amiably, dived into the\r\nbay and swam like a fish. Even without soap he lightened at least two\r\nshades, and was vain about it when I held up a mirror.\r\n\r\nPanio, the political strong-arm, was especially aromatic; I was quite\r\novercome by his meekness when I suggested that he follow Buia’s\r\nexample. When he came out of the water, a paler and a better man, he\r\ntold me that he had had some experience with talk-marks, the kind I\r\nmade on the typewriter. But his words hadn’t been any good. He handed\r\nme a piece of paper which a visiting skipper had given him by way of\r\nintroduction to passing ships. But when Panio had shown it to other\r\nskippers they had been cross too much. I read his paper and quite\r\nunderstood. It said, “To whom it may concern. Don’t have anything to\r\ndo with this bloody bastard. He is a proper wrong un.” The skipper who\r\nwrote that reference was a student of human nature.\r\n\r\nI had thought that Templeton Crocker’s firm stand against midnight\r\nvisitors might have dangerous repercussions. Or at least the effect\r\nwouldn’t be very lasting. It was good for about twenty-four hours, I\r\nfound; the people were kind but insinuating, and they all came back.\r\nThe only way to shorten visiting hours, we learned, was to see the Big\r\nMasters; and when we managed that, the scene grew quieter--Or did it?\r\nOne evening after dinner, a number of native beauties were draping\r\ntheir pretty figures over about everything on the ship, animate or\r\ninanimate. “Maury” Willowes, who was serving as a human coat-hanger\r\nfor about six of the clinging ladies, did not attempt to brush them off\r\nas he made his _bon mot_: “Just another quiet evening at home.” And our\r\nhost, who had at first declared the Rennellese among the most beautiful\r\nworks of nature, sniffed a little at the prevalent native bouquet.\r\n\r\nNext day I wrote in my diary:--\r\n\r\n Mr. Crocker is working on the deck astern, or trying to; Panio is\r\n summoning some friends at a half-mile distance, in a voice that might\r\n blow a hole in the ship; a girl and two boys are playing mouth organs\r\n steadily in my right ear; Maury, heaven help us, is trading out baby\r\n rattles, the kind with bells on them; a man is bouncing a rubber ball,\r\n and is so awkward about catching it that my little Sara Celia could\r\n show him how. Older men are clamoring for knives and hatchets, but\r\n the ones of military age have gone crazy about musical tops.... Where\r\n was I, anyhow? Oh, yes, this morning on the beach I gave a cigarette\r\n to Teina, and he said, “You pickaninny belong me.” I suppose he was\r\n trying to say that I was his father....\r\n\r\nRennell Island was advancing, but in her march of progress she had\r\ntaken the wrong fork in the road. A great many of the men had discarded\r\nnative costume and were taking a fancy to _lavalavas_. To impress us,\r\nperhaps, they would pull _lavalavas_ over the time-honored breachclouts\r\nthey called _kongoa_. Or they’d take off the _kongoa_ altogether and\r\nsubstitute “calicoes” for them. On Barley’s recent trip his crew\r\nhad brought in several thousand cigarettes, salvaged from a wrecked\r\nJapanese vessel, and the Rennellese had taken to them like so many\r\nducks to water. New tastes, new ways.... The growing craze for European\r\ncostume was illustrated in the behavior of Mua, son of Taupangi, who\r\nfollowed me around the ship, archly suggesting that I give him a pair\r\nof trousers and a shirt. I tried to tell him that it would curse\r\nRennell, if he started such nonsense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat had happened to the fierce tabu on feces examinations, which\r\nhad embarrassed us on our former trip? Old Tahua, in whose presence\r\nwe had not dared to whisper the forbidden thing, was now strangely\r\napproachable. Perhaps an extra box of fishhooks tickled his\r\noverdeveloped acquisitiveness. At any rate, he permitted Malakai,\r\naided by Buia, to give him our stock hookworm lecture with chart and\r\nall the fixings. Immediately he commanded that a number of young boys\r\nshould report to the tent we had set up on the beach, and be properly\r\nexamined. Later on he ordered out a number of women for the same\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nThis concession was obliging to us and convenient to our work. But\r\nunderneath the courtesy I felt a certain loosening of the old religious\r\nties which had held Rennell’s proud racial identity. World without\r\nend, they had worshiped with a single-mindedness which was like that\r\nof Medieval Europe when the Church was all in all and the Pope its\r\ninterpreter. Religion had come first with the Rennell folk, and had\r\nentered into every duty of their practical lives.\r\n\r\nOutwardly they were still religious. But what undercurrents of doubt\r\nwere entering the new desires and ambitions? They still seemed\r\nunquestioningly obedient to the Big Masters, who spoke with the voice\r\nof God. Did the Divine One and his lesser divinities still listen to\r\ntheir inner thoughts, as they had three short years ago? Their code of\r\nsins and virtues had been different from ours, but just as strict. What\r\nwould happen to them when all their traditions went to the junk-pile?\r\n\r\nAs I worked in my tent on the beach, many things that I had not known\r\nbefore came filtering in. Dr. Macgregor told me more, for he was there\r\nto study the past and present of a strange people. Through Buia, loyal\r\nto the White Sands, I learned why I had better not go to the Lake this\r\ntime. Tahua and Taupangi were in a jealous quarrel again over property\r\nrights. In the past year or so Taupangi had had an inspiration: If\r\nTahua got iron through his possession of the White Sands, then Taupangi\r\nwould have an anchorage of his own. Therefore he had made a three-mile\r\nshortcut to a place in the cliffs where it was just possible to get up\r\nand down. Here he could launch canoes and invite the crews of passing\r\nships to come to the Lake by the shortest way; something like our\r\nroad-signs, “Shortest Route to Atlantic City.” Roughhewn as the idea\r\nwas, it fetched some trade to Taupangi’s district. Tahua was in a\r\nboiling rage, and the people of the White Sands well knew that the two\r\nlesser Masters who had aided in Taupangi’s forbidden trail had been\r\nafflicted with a fatal sickness which only Tahua’s God could inflict.\r\n\r\nAn embassy from the Lake visited my tent with Taupangi’s cordial\r\ninvitation to come to his district with my treatments. Buia gave me\r\na warning look, so I was obliged to decline. We were indebted to the\r\nWhite Sands for our anchorage and headquarters. No telling what Tahua\r\nmight do if the white witch doctor should desert him for a hated\r\nrival. So I let Gordon White go to the Lake with some of the _Zaca’s_\r\nscientists. Tahua granted them that favor, after I had offered a\r\npractical idea for his benefit. Why not join forces with the Lake\r\npeople and cut a good trail across that awful eight miles of vines and\r\ncoral? Make communications easy, and Taupangi would forget about his\r\nrival anchorage.... It was like asking a blue Republican to junk a\r\ntariff barrier for the benefit of mutual trade. But Tahua thought it\r\nover....\r\n\r\nThey were pouring in from every district to be lined up in our tent.\r\nWhile we worked at our trade Macgregor, at the other end, worked at\r\nhis, and Dr. Hynes, our surgeon, studied the blood groupings of 100\r\npeople in hopes of throwing some light on their racial origin. They\r\nwere almost equally divided between Group O and Group B, with almost no\r\nA’s or AB’s, a quite different finding than European grouping, which\r\nfurnishes data for specialist study in anthropology; and they did not\r\nseem to check up with other Polynesian typing.\r\n\r\nDr. Macgregor, who was a Harvard Ph.D. in anthropology and had had\r\nthe superlative advantages offered by the Bishop Museum, was a young\r\nscientist with the proper equipment of learning and enthusiasm. As\r\nthe line of natives passed through our tent he took head measurements\r\nand found a cephalic index of 74-75, about the same as that of the\r\nso-called Nordics. He reached the conclusion that they were not usual\r\nPolynesians in the sense that Hawaiians, Samoans, Cook Islanders, and\r\nothers are Polynesians. They had many elements of Melanesian culture,\r\nsuch as certain points in their god-worship, and their habit of\r\nbetel-chewing. They knew nothing of that Polynesian favorite, kava;\r\nand many of their words were not Polynesian at all. But physically\r\nthey were not Melanesian, nor were they of the Micronesian race that I\r\nmyself had seen in the Gilberts and the western Bismarcks. It was no\r\nwild conjecture to call them pre-Polynesian, of which there is still a\r\nsmall element in Tonga.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in their first long voyage from Nowhere to Nowhere they had\r\npicked up certain Polynesian arts and habits: like the making of tapa\r\ncloth and the smearing of their bodies with sacred turmeric. History\r\nrecords that the Tongafiti, conquering fathers of Polynesia, had fallen\r\nupon Rennell Island some 400 years before; but not to conquer. The\r\nRennellese warriors had slain all but one man. That man finally built\r\na canoe and started for his home. The Rennellese had some knowledge of\r\ninvaders very like the Tongafiti. As we saw them there were no mixed\r\nbloods--with the exception of two half-castes, probably the issue of\r\nvisiting sailors.\r\n\r\nMalakai and I, representing the medical end of the enterprise,\r\nwere busy with a count of native diseases. We were saving hookworm\r\nexaminations for the last and were winning popular confidence through\r\nless objectionable tests. If I had been pessimistic when I came back\r\nto Rennell, I was glad to find many of my fears groundless. There was\r\nno filariasis, nor was any evidence to be found of the anopheline\r\nmosquito; and there were no diagnostic signs of malaria. Buia actually\r\nhad malaria; I knew, because I treated him for it. But he had been\r\nwith Barley on Malaita, where he undoubtedly picked it up. As to\r\ntuberculosis, I found less on Rennell than anywhere else I had visited.\r\nYaws was no menace; the local habit of isolating sufferers until the\r\nsores were healed had reduced the disease to a few tertiary cases--Buia\r\ntold me that I would find much yaws on Bellona, where they did not\r\npractise the ancient quarantine custom. There was still plenty of itch\r\non Rennell, but that too seemed to be wearing itself out.\r\n\r\nI have described the technique of getting hookworm, but because the\r\nquestion was most important to me on Rennell, I hope to be forgiven for\r\ndescribing it again.\r\n\r\nLittle tins are given out for feces specimens, and their contents\r\nexamined. If you want worms you choose the people who have been\r\nfound positive through examination; positive because hookworm eggs\r\nhave been found in their specimens. You dose them with the drug,\r\nsay tetrachloride, then you give them a “jerry,” which is usually a\r\nfive-gallon benzine tin, and tell them that all their bowel motions\r\nfor die day must be deposited in the big container. A purge has been\r\ngiven after the tetrachloride, to hurry things up. At the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours the whole stool is washed through several thicknesses\r\nof surgical gauze until only a sediment remains. This sediment is taken\r\nby tablespoonful and floated with a little water in a photograph tray,\r\nwhere the worms can be seen with difficulty, especially if die patient\r\nhas been eating fibrous vegetables. Then he is given another saline\r\npurge and he deposits his bowel motion for another twenty-four hours.\r\nThen the same procedure is repeated. To do a good job another day’s\r\ncollection should be made. This is difficult in a hospital, and much\r\nmore difficult among savages. In New Guinea we had to put them behind\r\nbarbed wire, in Fiji we often locked them up.\r\n\r\nOn Rennell we were not given permission to do this work until the last\r\nfew days, and we only got Tahua’s consent by paying him liberally\r\nin fishhooks. The examinations were on the beach, and the subjects\r\nall girls; they had been forced to submit by the Big Master, who\r\ncannily believed that if some magic curse should fall on a few girls\r\nit wouldn’t matter. Malakai and Gordon were supposed to keep guard\r\nover these patients; but with new ones coming all the time, they were\r\nprobably not very well watched. The infection was very light, and\r\nprobably many of the stools missed. Later on, when we examined the\r\nmaterial, we found no worms. The trouble was that the Big Master’s\r\npermission had come so late that a technique suited to such bizarre\r\ncircumstances was impossible. The delay resulted in our frustration.\r\n\r\nThey had no conception of disease. When it came to tuberculin tests\r\nwe had immense difficulty in getting them to report for more than one\r\ninjection, for the Big Parade was always going on and they didn’t want\r\nto miss any of it. Time, of course, was nothing to them. That mental\r\nquirk, as well as those above noted, worked dead against us. Remember,\r\nit was a land of savages, a stark beach, no houses to speak of and an\r\nalmost constant rain. Add to this the native’s superstitious shyness.\r\nOnce, when I caught Buia in a very personal occupation, he almost died\r\nof fear.\r\n\r\nI had done my best to inquire into the prevalence of gonorrhea, the\r\nold enemy of racial fertility. Examinations were, of course, out of\r\nthe question--you could examine a Rennellese man only by felling him\r\nwith an ax. I suspected that this venereal germ had revisited Rennell,\r\nand when I looked over our crew after departure my suspicions were\r\njustified. I could learn little from a people who in no way associated\r\nthe infection with promiscuity; they regarded all disease as merely a\r\ncurse following the violation of a tabu, even an unconscious violation.\r\nBut what I found that our sailors had picked up from Rennell alarmed me\r\nas to the island’s future. The barriers were down, the White Sands were\r\noffering the most generous hospitality to visiting sailors. I had seen\r\nother island populations sink for similar reasons.\r\n\r\nA nightly chore was counting the sick aboard ship. Templeton Crocker’s\r\nfoot was about well; however we had persuaded him not to bruise it\r\nagain in that awful overland walk to the Lake. Stuart, our botanical\r\ncollector, was in bed with a severe leg ulcer. He had tramped all over\r\nJava and Borneo in the Chancellor-Stuart expedition, and now he chafed\r\nbecause his legs were not taking him along. Toschio seemed to have\r\nrecovered from the sickness that took us to Tulagi, and otherwise we\r\nseemed fit to carry on. Except that I was suffering from a boil on my\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nOne night Buia came aboard and asked Malakai to intervene with Mr.\r\nCrocker for more food for the people who had come down to be treated.\r\nMalakai, always a sympathetic observer of the natives, said that he had\r\nwatched them and they had gone all day without a thing to eat. These\r\npeople were nomads, really--nomads on an island fifty miles long. When\r\nthey traveled they never thought of carrying provisions. I went to\r\nCrocker, and found him generous again. In free feeds for Rennell he had\r\nalready dipped pretty deep into our stock of eatables, but he managed\r\nto dig up another banquet and send it ashore. I asked Buia why the\r\npeople went hungry when they could fish in the bay, and he said it was\r\ntabu to eat fish from the bay while our sewage was emptying there.\r\n\r\nI caught Buia off his guard and told him that I had learned the names\r\nof the two Gods who ruled his island: they were the old Tetanosanga,\r\nwhose girth measured ten fathoms, and his grandson Teaitutabu.\r\nListening to the sacred words, Buia stood aghast and begged me never,\r\nnever to say those names again. Only the Big Masters could speak them,\r\nand that only in a whisper. I liked Buia for his reverence, when he\r\nprayed away my rash impiety. While he prayed I felt that faith had not\r\ndeparted from his people, and might strengthen them to stand against\r\nthe white invader, as they had stood against the Tongafiti.\r\n\r\nPrayer was a part of their daily lives. Gordon Macgregor on his visit\r\nto the Lake saw a sacred and secret ceremony never before shown to\r\na white man. He had asked a question, and old Taupangi went into a\r\n“sweating trance,” seeking divine guidance. His two companions held\r\nthe chiefs heavily perspiring body while his eyes rolled and his head\r\nfell. They were afraid he would die. At last his assistant took a\r\nstrip of tapa and bound it tightly around his waist to squeeze out the\r\npossessing spirit. Then he recovered from his trance and delivered a\r\nsomewhat confused message: Possibly it would be all right, he said, for\r\nhis son to go on a trip with Macgregor.\r\n\r\nTaupangi was the only one of the five Big Masters who could speak\r\ndirectly to God. The others had to communicate through an intermediary.\r\nTahua lacked the mystic power. With receptive soul he had waited all\r\nhis life for God to enter him and show favor, but he died with his wish\r\nunanswered.\r\n\r\nReligion was an everyday, every hour affair with these simple,\r\ndevout people, and the way to Heaven was marked out for them. When\r\na soul entered Paradise it was a very small soul, but it grew as\r\na child grows, and attained magnificent size among the immortals.\r\nIt was a man’s Heaven, for earth-women were hardly worth sending\r\nthere, especially since Eternity was supplied with many beautiful\r\ncreatures, superior in every way to the merely human female. When a Big\r\nMaster died a heavy club was buried with him to protect him against\r\ndevil-devils on the way to his Valhalla. The “Big Master’s stick,” his\r\nwand of office, was stuck on the top of his grave, and this marked his\r\nterm of office as a spiritual interpreter; for as long as the stick\r\nlasted his earthly successor might use it as a mouthpiece to Heaven\r\nand consult with the late Big Master, and with the supreme Ngenggo,\r\nthe Grandson God. When the stick rotted in the ground the deceased was\r\nno longer the heavenly interpreter, and the next in line assumed the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nMacgregor was at last keen enough to see that my pidgin was a valuable\r\nmeans of communication. He found that the sacred name for their god\r\nwas Ngenggo, the same as Rengo in Rotumah.[6] Rengo was another name\r\nfor turmeric, sacred to the bodies of high personages. Between us we\r\nfound that the Big Masters spoke indirectly to the gods, through their\r\nancestors. As if to throw up a defense across the sacred names, they\r\nhad two names at least for the two principal gods. On my first trip\r\na Master told me that the principal god was called Tainatua, as I\r\nunderstood it--really Taiinggatua. Then Barley, a little later, learned\r\nthat the two were Tetanosanga and Teaitutabu (the Sacred God). At the\r\nLake, Macgregor found that Teaitutabu and Ngenggo were one and the\r\nsame. He collected some wonderful material there, especially concerning\r\nreligion and ceremonies, and was able to improve on it through his wide\r\nexperience in Rotumah and the Tokelaus. Incidentally Macgregor saw a\r\ntwo-headed stick used as an object of worship.\r\n\r\nAs we worked out the puzzling pantheon, Tetanosanga (another name for\r\nTaiinggatua) was grandfather to the god Teaitutabu (otherwise Ngenggo).\r\nThey presided over the world, as Rennell knew it, and Ngenggo never\r\nleft his home in the skies. His grandfather, however, roamed the earth\r\nand reported happenings to Ngenggo. The Grandson God was the most\r\npowerful of the Sky Masters, and Buia said, “Suppose him he talk-talk\r\nhe sabe make you die quick.” While Ngenggo stayed at home the Old One\r\nwent everywhere, saw and heard everything, and if there were those who\r\nignored divine laws, Ngenggo punished them. Not only could he kill men,\r\nbut he could demolish trees, islands, anything. There were prayers\r\nto the gods before every simple meal. There were ceremonies of food\r\npresentation to the gods, too involved to describe in anything but a\r\nbook on anthropology. But if the regular tribute of food to a god was\r\nneglected, the offender would surely sicken and die.\r\n\r\nBuia told me of Charley Cowan’s ship which had anchored at Taupangi’s\r\nLake anchorage. Charley, Buia said, gave the ship to Taupangi, and\r\nTaupangi in turn gave it to the Big Master along Skies. Then the\r\ndivinity replied that Cowan might go on using his vessel, provided\r\nthat he came back at intervals to Taupangi’s anchorage. The Big Master\r\nwarned him not to take it to Tahua’s beach, but Cowan on his next trip\r\nwent to the White Sands. As a result of this disobedience, Buia said,\r\nTaupangi “talked along” the watchful Grandson God, and as a result both\r\nCowan and his partner died. (As a matter of fact, these men did die,\r\nto my knowledge.) It was _post hoc_ rather than _propter hoc_; but try\r\nto make a Rennellese believe that Taupangi didn’t pray them to death!\r\nBuia was afraid for the _Zaca_ if it called at Taupangi’s anchorage for\r\nMacgregor and White....\r\n\r\nNothing was attempted and few thoughts conceived without first seeking\r\nthe advice of the gods. The people even consulted their ancestors\r\nthrough a bamboo stick dug into a grave. I once caught the tough Panio\r\nusing this sort of spirit-telephone.\r\n\r\nGordon White, coming back from Tenggano with the usual tatters and\r\ncoral scratches, reported that the Lake People had not depreciated\r\nmuch in health. He said that my old chum Taupangi grieved that I had\r\nnot come up to live with him for the balance of my life. The _Zaca’s_\r\nparty at the Lake had dined with the Big Master every day, and were\r\ninterested to find that somebody had taught him to eat with a fork and\r\ndrink tea out of a china cup. He liked plenty of sugar in his tea and\r\nstirred it for five minutes, with his fork. They took movies of the\r\nharvest festival, and Gordon noticed what a change had come over the\r\nscene since last we saw it. There was no high fence around the grounds,\r\nand women were allowed to look on. Another old tabu was fading out.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by his hated rival, Taupangi had loosened up on the\r\nhookworm tabu; but his people were still so queer about being examined\r\nthat our party got no good specimens. There was an epidemic of head\r\ncolds, so frequent that our outfit was now catching the germ from\r\nRennell--a reversal of our first experience there.\r\n\r\nWhen Macgregor came back to the White Sands the majority of the Lake\r\npopulation followed him, crazy to see the _Zaca_. Gordon White tried\r\nto bribe them to stay home, offering toy balloons and tin trumpets,\r\nbut these things bored them. They were out for iron, and intended to\r\nget it. Taupangi overcame his grouch against Tahua (who would allow\r\nhim nothing better than a leaky leaf-shelter when he was on the beach)\r\nand joined the exodus. So did Tekita and Tamata. Only Mua remained as\r\nintermediary; although he was the Big Master’s son and heir he hadn’t\r\nhad enough of God’s authority to coax the people up to Gordon’s tent,\r\nso it had become a matter of visiting every leaf-shelter in the place\r\nand giving tests. Tuberculosis didn’t seem alarming. Wanderlust was\r\nthe prevailing ailment. Mua, Tekita, Tamata, everybody who could get a\r\nword in edgewise, had tried to wheedle Gordon into taking them away on\r\nthe boat. If Buia had traveled and learned about the great world, why\r\nshouldn’t they? These simple folk, to whom Rennell had been all in all,\r\nwere growing restless, discontented with this frugal island which had\r\nonce satisfied their every want--because they had never learned to want\r\nthe unnecessary. A self-containing social structure, an unquestioning\r\nfaith in divinities who could give and who could take away, scanty food\r\nwhich they gained by wholesome labor and gratefully thanked God for....\r\nThat was their plenty. But to human nature, plenty is too often not\r\nenough. Perhaps that is the real Martyrdom of Man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLittle Bellona Island (Mungiki) lay twenty-five miles over there, and I\r\nwas anxious to survey it again, and to show it to Crocker’s expedition.\r\nThe Big Masters of Rennell had explained carefully why Mungiki had a\r\nricher soil than theirs. In days of old, the semi-mythical Ko Fiti\r\nhad been driven out of Rennell, but before they left they had done\r\na spiteful thing; they had scraped the good topsoil off Rennell and\r\ndumped it on Mungiki.\r\n\r\nOur _Zaca_ moved across the short stretch of sea. In sight of\r\nBellona’s forbidding cliffs I sent a short radio message to Eloisa; a\r\ndemonstration of science in the midst of savagery.\r\n\r\nA man came out in a canoe and gave his name as Samoana, which was\r\npure Samoan for Guardian of the Sea. He guided us to a beach which\r\nhad changed so in three years that I hardly knew it. Great storms had\r\nwashed it clean of sand; now it was a forest of sharp coral points.\r\nWhen I sat down on the softest lump I could find, I was immediately\r\nsurrounded by a half-hundred fierce faces; threatening fists were full\r\nof bows, arrows and spears. A man who came out of a cave seemed to own\r\nthe beach, and I asked him if we might pitch our tent there. No, he\r\nsaid archly, if we set up a tent (“big calico”) we might take a notion\r\nto stay. A poor start, but with the help of Buia I managed to persuade\r\nhim that we were moving on in four days. When I asked for the chiefs\r\nto come to me--a policy I adopted on Bellona--Samoana went away, then\r\ncame back to report that Ponge, the Big Master, sat with three lesser\r\nMasters, presiding at a great festival. He couldn’t possibly come, as\r\nhe was very tabu; his face was blackened, which was the deepest of all\r\ntabus.\r\n\r\nBuia brought in the three lesser Masters, who surprised me with their\r\nwillingness to have the people inspected. And of course it would be all\r\nright to have the big calico on the shore--if we didn’t stay too long.\r\nWhen I told them that I had left much of my equipment in a big calico\r\non the White Sands, with the assurance that nothing would be stolen,\r\nthe three Masters promised me that my goods would be respected. And\r\nthey kept their word. Even on Rennell I had found that the people were\r\nlearning the difference between _meum_ and _teum_. Sleeping on that\r\nbeach would be about as comfortable as a Hindu fakir’s bed of nails,\r\nand Bellona’s geological freaks made water available only by catching\r\nit in coconut shells or the funny wooden bowls they used for that\r\npurpose. The Bellonese, who were the gentlest people in the world in\r\nspite of their savage look, seemed to subsist almost without water. A\r\nlittle coconut juice satisfied bodies that had adjusted themselves to\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nI loaded the three Masters on the small boat and we presented them\r\nwith candy and tinned meat. Crocker turned on the phonograph, with\r\nstartling effect. They all began to shake and shiver; Buia’s cousin\r\nTakeika rose nervously and tried to take the machine down to his canoe.\r\nWe had to tell him that it was very tabu for anybody but Crocker, who\r\nwas Captain to them--the highest title they could understand. We didn’t\r\nturn the record on again. They were very curious about the two little\r\nfishes which Buia had tattooed on my left ankle. They didn’t know that\r\nmy ankle was still sore where a needle (made from a sliver of human\r\nbone) had gone in, or that my leg was sensitive from a couple of buried\r\nboils, which I had carried with me from Suva and hadn’t given a chance\r\nto cure. They smacked their lips and rolled their eyes, marveling at\r\nthe tattooed fishes, symbols of Rennell.\r\n\r\nThey seemed to think that the Rennell people put on airs. Macgregor\r\nfound that Bellona gave a soft sound to _ng_, as in “sing,” where\r\nRennell hardened it to _ngg_, as in “finger.” Probably considered an\r\naffectation, like the English broad _a_....\r\n\r\nMalakai and I, setting up a tent on the beach, found that the petting\r\nhabit on Bellona was slightly worse than that of Rennell. People\r\nsurrounded us like sticky flies. Two or three would run their hands\r\ndown my shirt collar, to see if my worshipful belly was real or just\r\npadding; two or three more would be lifting up my trousers to marvel\r\nat my white ankles, and the tattooed fishes. That massage, with\r\ninquisitive and dirty hands, went on for four days. It went hardest\r\nwith Crocker, who had more respect for his personal dignity than some\r\nof us. He was getting used to being called Captain--on Rennell he had\r\ntried to insist that his name was Owner, but that hadn’t made sense to\r\nthe native. Captain meant Boss, and you couldn’t go any higher than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAt last we went to Big Master Ponge, since he was too sacred to move\r\nfrom his seat of dignity. Every time my sore leg came down I suppressed\r\na moan, and wondered why I had ever left Suva in such condition.\r\nWhenever the choking scrub along the way opened up a little I had\r\npleasant views of the neat, thatched houses. They looked very pretty at\r\na distance, but when I went into some of them I found only dirt floors,\r\nwith hardly a mat to squat on--and all the time dirty natives were\r\npatting my hands, pawing my shoes, stockings, every inch of me.\r\n\r\nBig Master Ponge had invited us to a dance, and that was the reason for\r\nthose weary three miles. As we had done in Rennell, we crawled on our\r\nstomachs under the low eaves and faced the Presence on all fours. And\r\nthere was the great Ponge, seated on his dais and looking for all the\r\nworld, as Maury said, like a Chinese mandarin. But a mandarin doing a\r\nblack-face act, for his cheeks, nose and forehead were thick with tabu\r\nsoot. He shook hands all round and listened carefully when I told him\r\nwhy we had come, and how Crocker had invited him to visit the _Zaca_.\r\nMacgregor talked, and presented him with a cane-knife--and I hoped\r\nhe’d use it to clear a path through that awful scrub. In behalf of his\r\nMaster Tahua, Buia gave him an American ax. By way of ecclesiastical\r\nblessing Ponge pronounced us “good fellow too much.” I didn’t wait for\r\nthe dance, but limped back over the terrible trail. I had business\r\nawaiting me on the beach.\r\n\r\nI looked over the people that filed through my tent and was surprised\r\nto see how much clearer skinned and robust they were than the\r\ninhabitants of the White Sands. They appeared cleaner, but they smelled\r\na little worse than the Rennellese. I saw some hideous cases of yaws,\r\nand remembered what Buia had said: The Bellona folk did not quarantine\r\nit. In fact the Rennellese quarantine was the only one I ever saw among\r\nprimitive people.\r\n\r\nBellona called it _caho_, and when I asked in the presence of the\r\ncrowd where _caho_ came from, they answered to a man that Dr. Deck’s\r\nmissionaries had brought it. Dr. Deck had botched his expeditions\r\nsufficiently, without this. Even though Deck’s excursions might have\r\nbrought some of it, it was just a case of yaws meet yaws, I thought.\r\nIf the people of Bellona were Polynesian, this was the only Polynesian\r\nspot on the Pacific where the disease was not called _tona_ or some\r\nname much like it. Their ignorance of the word suggested that they\r\nhad been pushed out of some Western Polynesian group before they had\r\nhad a chance to come in contact with the Tongans; for yaws is a curse\r\nthat does not die out of itself, and if they had come to Bellona after\r\nmeeting Tongans, they would have carried the Tongan name _tona_.\r\n\r\nMacgregor, taking anthropological measurements, found them physically\r\nidentical with the Rennellese--probably the relics of a pre-Polynesian\r\nrace. I found that they needed a doctor for yaws, and not much more;\r\notherwise they would be a thousand times better off if no white man’s\r\nfoot ever again touched their coral-scragged beach. Isolation had made\r\nthem happier than the Rennellese, I thought. Five ships had touched at\r\nRennell Island in three years, and more were coming. Bellona had only\r\nseen two in that time, and those two had been given a cool reception.\r\nAn object lesson in self-preservation.\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange that they had more iron tools per capita than the\r\nRennellese, until I heard that Bellona was arrow-maker for Rennell, and\r\ndemanded her pay in iron. The chiefs might have been sharp traders,\r\nbut one of the Masters was pretty dull when he gave Crocker a royal\r\ntreasure out of respect to his rank as “Captain.” The gift might take\r\nrank with Charlemagne’s scepter for its antiquarian value and its rare\r\nmaterial. It was a king’s mace, a shaft of wood with a knob of stone\r\non the end. To Rennell and Bellona real stone was worth its weight in\r\ndiamonds, for there was absolutely none of it between the beetling\r\ncoral cliffs. The piece that tipped this relic might have come from\r\nTucopia in olden times, or from undreamed-of distances. It was the last\r\nking’s mace on either island, and there are only four in the world. The\r\nother three are in museums: at Brisbane, Cambridge University, and the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\nMacgregor had tried sleeping in the tent on the beach, but had given\r\nit up for uncanny reasons. He had set up an army cot, got into it--and\r\nfound that two local chiefs had decided to sleep on the coral floor\r\nright under him. In the middle of the night his cot began to shake, and\r\nhe found the worried chiefs rousing him. “Master,” they said, “you must\r\ngo at once. In our dreams God spoke in our heads asking, ‘Who is this\r\nthat dares sleep above me?’” Macgregor didn’t argue the point, but went.\r\n\r\nOn Bellona there was one big native who seemed to double for Panio as\r\nlocal nuisance. He had bothered me a great deal when we were there on\r\nthe _France_ expedition. Now he was on and off the _Zaca_, strutting\r\nlike a magpie and yelling his slogan in my ear: “Gimme, thank you!\r\nGimme, thank you!” I called him Mr. Gimme and tried to laugh him\r\noff, which was pretty hard to do when I was giving injections on the\r\nbeach with him clinging to my elbow. Our last afternoon at Bellona I\r\ntold Maury Willowes how I should love to plant my foot on Mr. Gimme’s\r\nsciatic nerve, and Maury grinned, “Why don’t you?”\r\n\r\nWe were safely near sailing time when Mr. Gimme came at me again and\r\nhad hardly opened his mouth for the familiar slogan when I put my\r\nwalking stick against his mid-section and firmly poked him halfway down\r\nthe accommodation ladder. He plunked into his canoe and his look was\r\ndemoniacal as he yelled his farewell curse: “Gimme, thank you!”\r\n\r\nThere were no reprisals. Peaceably the three kings came aboard to\r\nshake hands all around and receive their final gift of hardware. They\r\nwere very cordial, glad that we were going so soon. I admired their\r\nself-protective attitude, and hoped that they wouldn’t weaken, as\r\nRennell was weakening. They were fine people, and I didn’t hold Mr.\r\nGimme against them. There is at least one Panio in every neighborhood\r\nthat I know of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore the _Zaca_ pulled away from the White Sands and headed toward\r\nTulagi I had a farewell glimpse of a people who were turning too soon\r\ntowards ideals which could never work anything but harm for them. Over\r\non the beach Tahua was bossing a construction gang. They were putting\r\nup the frame of his house, a big house, a fine house, a house that\r\nwould make Taupangi feel pretty small. Keeping up with the Joneses,\r\nand a lap ahead of them.... When Taupangi came aboard to rub noses\r\nand wish us all back soon, he reminded Gordon White that he had given\r\nhim a present of fine mats--but he was keeping them for him up at the\r\nLake, so that Gordon would be sure and return there with more medicine.\r\nCompetition was making old Taupangi canny as a Scot. Many of the\r\nnatives, who stayed with us until the ship’s propeller turned, came in\r\nfashionable _lavalavas_.\r\n\r\nBuia remained aboard until we were rounding Unga Unga, then a canoe\r\npicked him up. Buia, I am afraid, was getting a touch of bighead. He\r\nwas too intelligent to become another Panio, but his reputation as a\r\ncruise conductor had done him no good. Crocker had been annoyed with\r\nhis way of walking in on every party and taking possession. I was\r\nmore relenting, for I had a real affection for this heir to a Big\r\nMastership, and knew that he might rule with wisdom, if only he were\r\nlet alone to serve his native God. To him we were something to be\r\nadmired and imitated, and he had sought to adjust himself as best he\r\nknew how. Hadn’t they all?\r\n\r\nHe paddled away in his canoe. The _Zaca_ turned out to sea; Rennell\r\nIsland became a faint blue shadow in the distance. I wondered what\r\ncould be done about these unique people, infinitely valuable to\r\nscientific study. It was something like an emergency case; but in\r\nthe wide Pacific you can’t send a fast ambulance to emergency cases.\r\nRelief comes slowly, biding its time for the Government to make up its\r\nmind, for competent medical men to take over the work, for boats to\r\nsail, for treasuries to cover the necessary expenses. Sometimes years\r\npass between visit and visit--especially to a small world like Rennell\r\nIsland, which needed protection far more than it needed medicine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last, graduate N.M.P.’s were sent to Rennell Island; they went one\r\nat a time for a six months’ service, fully equipped, but alone. An\r\noutstanding one was Eroni, a full-blood Fijian who gained a nickname:\r\n“the only white man on Mungava.” Patient and responsible as only a\r\nFijian can be, he went barefoot over every coral snag and bog on the\r\nisland. Conscientiously he treated everything they had. Once he saw the\r\nnatives catch a shark according to custom; they wrestled with it in\r\nthe water, bound it with ropes and hauled it in. One man had his hand\r\nbitten off, and Eroni saved him with a tourniquet. He was surprised\r\nto find that the Rennellese themselves had always known how to apply\r\na tourniquet. Eroni was ever ready for emergency calls as well as\r\nmethodical mass treatments.\r\n\r\nBut one medical man, work as he might, could not enforce that ounce of\r\nprevention which, on Rennell, would have been worth many pounds of cure.\r\n\r\nBefore the High Commission in Suva I tried to drive home the\r\nnecessity of government protection for these defenseless people. The\r\nwaters should be patrolled and mischievous ships kept away. Medical\r\nauthority should be carefully admitted, and a properly hand-picked\r\nanthropologist. At the very mention of the latter profession I met\r\nopposition. A number of vicious playboys who masked as “scientific\r\ninvestigators” had put anthropology in bad odor. It used to be that\r\neverybody’s hat was off to every wandering bluffer who claimed to\r\nhold a key to the mystery of man’s origin. Too many of these fellows\r\nhad overstayed their time--usually on islands where women were the\r\nprettiest. One “anthropologist” had just been ordered off the Pacific;\r\nhe had been charged with violating two little girls. So the High\r\nCommission, although they quite understood my attitude, rather thought\r\nthat I should take the matter up in London. The snag was somewhere in\r\nthe Colonial Office, they said.\r\n\r\nHere are a few lines from a letter I wrote His Excellency, the High\r\nCommissioner; just an item in the literature that passed back and forth\r\nin my long plea for the Rennell Islanders:--\r\n\r\n Spiritually they have a gentle religion in which there is no\r\n skepticism and no cruelty. Socially it would be hard to convince me\r\n that these savages are not more highly advanced than we are. There is\r\n almost a complete absence of crime. Morally they have a code which\r\n suits them, and to which they adhere exactly. They themselves say that\r\n they do not want government, missions or doctors....\r\n\r\nThe High Commissioner’s reply, in part:--\r\n\r\n The Bishop of Melanesia has suggested that he should be allowed to\r\n select young men from Rennell, train them as preachers, and send them\r\n back. What is your view of this proposal?\r\n\r\nMy answer in brief:--\r\n\r\n ... Unfortunately, when anyone’s ideas on any subject differ from\r\n those of a missionary, he is immediately put down as anti-missionary,\r\n if not anti-Christian. The only question on which all of the Mission\r\n Societies will unite is opposition to any attempt to limit in the\r\n least degree, for any purpose whatsoever, the extension of mission\r\n work. On all other questions they are drawn up in armed camps\r\n against each other. I am not anti-mission in any particular, and any\r\n reasonable man must be pro-mission, if he is acquainted with the\r\n history of mission efforts in the Pacific, where they have been the\r\n great humanizers and educators of the native races. However....\r\n\r\nIn 1936 the Foundation’s business took me to London, where I told\r\nmy story to three famous anthropologists: Elliot-Smith, Haddon and\r\nMalinowski; their sympathy was all with my plan to protect the two\r\nislands, Rennell and Bellona. The important man to see was Sir Thomas\r\nStanton, Briton’s Chief Medical Officer. Sir Thomas was easy to meet\r\nand to talk to. He was one of the Central Medical School’s enthusiasts.\r\nWhen I had finished my work in Fiji, he suggested, why couldn’t I go to\r\nthe West Indies and organize an institution on the Suva plan? And I was\r\ndelighted to hear that he had about decided to promote my friend, Dr.\r\nMcGusty, to the post of the High Commission’s C.M.O. Nothing could be\r\nbetter luck for the Pacific, and I am proud if I put in a good word for\r\na good man. I hope I had a share in his appointment.\r\n\r\nMy main proposal, aside from a plan to protect Rennell from mischievous\r\ninfluences, was to have a thorough anthropological survey made there. I\r\nsuggested that the Bishop Museum of Honolulu take charge of this, for\r\nit had been founded in memory of a high-born Hawaiian lady, and her\r\nhusband’s wealth had made it pre-eminent in Polynesian culture. Dr.\r\nPeter Buck, a Maori, was curator; the Museum could furnish just the\r\ntalent we needed.\r\n\r\nI was referred to the Colonial Office, where I struck the mysterious\r\nsnag. Possibly the British objected because the Bishop Museum was an\r\nAmerican institution; if so, they were stretching a point, for its\r\nleader was (and still is) a New Zealand Maori.\r\n\r\nMore likely it was the Church that stood in our way. When the news\r\nspread that I thought the old-time religion of Rennell was good\r\nenough for the people, and that the missionaries had only brought\r\nmurder, disease and discontent to the little island, the Bishop of\r\nMelanesia sent a thundering message, declaring that he could “permit\r\nno boundaries to the Empire of Christ.” Possibly the Adventists were\r\nputting in an oar, too; for I had heard one of them say in objection\r\nto the exclusion of his faith: “For we bring to the Rennellese God’s\r\ngreatest gift, the Bible.” And there was another who said, “I would\r\nfeel that I must go, even if I knew that as a result every one of them\r\nwould die.”\r\n\r\nGovernments and missions have been too often slandered, I think,\r\nbecause they have failed to accomplish miracles. In the Pacific they\r\nhave been called upon to face hell and high water, literally, and my\r\nhat is off to their many achievements for the good of humanity. But I\r\nleft London with the bitter knowledge that I had encountered the blind\r\nside of Christian officialdom--the sort of bigotry which means lack of\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I carried my message a year too late. As Barley said,\r\n“Sea-changes are very sudden on the Pacific.”\r\n\r\nFour years after the _Zaca_ cruise I received reports from Eroni,\r\nsaying that gonorrhea had spread from the White Sands to remoter\r\ndistricts where white men had never gone. Malaria was everywhere--and\r\nI had found no trace of it when I surveyed the island in 1930 and 1933.\r\n\r\nOutwardly the natives were prospering. The chiefs were building more\r\nand better houses with the handy tools for which they had traded their\r\nracial integrity. In 1920 when George Fulton’s ship went there to\r\nrecruit, he had seen no houses at all; a healthy, contented people\r\nwere sleeping in caves or in the open. Now Rennell Island was having a\r\nbuilding boom, and her population was going steadily downhill at the\r\nbeck and call of every trading stranger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout 1937 Dr. Crichlow made a survey there, and his worried findings\r\ncame to me roundabout, in a letter from the Solomons. Everything that\r\nI had feared had come to pass. Gonorrhea had increased so that not a\r\nchild had been born on Rennell Island in the past eighteen months.\r\n\r\nI lost all desire to go back. I didn’t care to see a splendid and\r\nunique race dying on its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSUCH A LITTLE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t think that I am a sentimental man. I shouldn’t be, for my work\r\nhas not been along sentimental lines, and daily routine should have\r\ntried all the sugar out of my system. But when the _Mariposa_ pulled\r\nout to sea I seemed to be pulling against it, every inch of the way.\r\nThe races I had worked among for twenty-one years were not mine. Yet I\r\nhad a foolish feeling that they were my people. I had been with them so\r\nconstantly; even during my short leaves in the States they had seldom\r\nleft my thoughts. A public health physician is no missionary. He does\r\nnot starve for a Cause. He is well paid for his services, and if he is\r\nhonest he does his level best to earn his wages. Looking back toward\r\nthe last dot among the outlying Fijis, I hoped that I had earned my pay.\r\n\r\nMy older daughter Harriette, who was born in Mexico and whom Eloisa had\r\ncarried as a baby into every tropical port where we could make another\r\ntemporary home, was now grown. Sara Celia, born in Fiji, would be\r\nnine pretty soon. After all Eloisa had gone through--and she had gone\r\nthrough a great deal, practically and cheerfully--she didn’t look her\r\nage, they told me. I was too near-sighted to tell very accurately, but\r\nsomehow I knew that she didn’t look her age.\r\n\r\nMy sight had very definitely failed, and that was what caused my\r\nretirement in June, 1939. The faulty vision which had bothered me in my\r\nstudent days was now far beyond a point where it could be corrected. I\r\nshould have retired a year before I did, but one all-important thing\r\nheld me in Suva--the Central Medical School.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Such a tiny little school!” a very great lady had said, wasting a\r\npatronizing glance on the small buildings and a knot of students going\r\ninto class. I had had no time to tell her that this little school had\r\ncost one man seventeen years of ambitious planning. Webb Waldron, when\r\nhe was all too kind to me in his write-up in _Harper’s Magazine_, had\r\ncalled it “unique in the world’s educational institutions.” He had done\r\nme honor overmuch, as Robert Emmet would have put it; but I was vain\r\nenough to believe that he had come nearer the truth than the very great\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nAs my days in Suva were coming toward an end my trusted champion the\r\n_Times and Herald_ also did me honor overmuch in obituary tones. “Dr.\r\nLambert brought to his work in Fiji, and in other adjacent groups, a\r\npersonal enthusiasm that seemed to grow the longer he stayed.... He\r\nappeared to accept all the health problems of the Pacific as a personal\r\nchallenge to S. M. Lambert. Many of these problems have either been\r\nsolved or are in process of solution, and we ... have been given strong\r\nreason to hope that the natural problems arising through the contact\r\nof white civilization with native races need not necessarily mean the\r\ngradual decay of these native races....”\r\n\r\nWell, I wasn’t dead yet. Although I had caught some of the diseases\r\nI treated, I had recovered. No crocodile had eaten me, no snake or\r\ncannibal had done me harm. In all my years down there I had had but one\r\naccident: a Ford door closed on one of my fingers, and I lost a nail.\r\n\r\nI was still sufficiently alive to wish that I could stay longer and\r\ndrive home other nails which I had been hammering at for many years.\r\nThe day before I left, Sir Maynard Hedstrom, who had supported me in\r\neverything, pointed to the School and said, “Next you know, Lambert,\r\nthey’ll be putting up a statue to you.” I said, “I don’t like statues.\r\nBut if I rate one, I hope it will be of solid brass and show me wearing\r\na pair of wrinkled shorts and carrying an armful of specimen tins. No,\r\nin a year or so if anybody says ‘Lambert’ they’ll be asking ‘Who?’ I’m\r\nnot worrying about a sculptor. What does worry me is the chance of some\r\npolitical thimblerigger coming along to undo everything we’ve done.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI spoke with healthy pessimism, and only half-believed my warning. The\r\nCentral Medical School had been going for a little over ten years, and\r\nseemed to have stemmed the tide. It was one of the three pet ideas\r\nwhich Montague and I had hatched back in 1922: a model leper colony at\r\nMokogai, an advanced Medical School for natives, and a Unified Medical\r\nService to cover every island group in the Pacific. Two of these pets\r\nthrived and grew to maturity. The Mokogai colony came in with a rush\r\nof enthusiasm in 1923, and building began almost at once. The School\r\nrequired seven years of wire-pulling before it began to operate at\r\nthe beginning of 1929. Up to then there had been but a poor little\r\nmakeshift, backed by the only funds the Fiji Government could afford.\r\n\r\nI have told you of my disappointment in the buildings when the school\r\nfirst opened. The Principal had to run his office in the physiological\r\nand chemistry laboratory, which we also used for a classroom; lectures\r\non pathology were about ruined by the horrible overcrowding in the\r\npostmortem room, which was a little death trap. The dormitory for men\r\nwas so inadequate that we had to limit students and hold the scholastic\r\ncourse down to three years.\r\n\r\nThen came more ambitious planning, and a long tussle with\r\nBacteriologist John Campbell, who insisted on a pathological\r\nlaboratory that would cost £5,500 and upward. Dr. Heiser visited us\r\nin 1934 and saw our plans for the structure, 70´ × 33´ with floor\r\nspace for a postmortem theater that would seat the whole student\r\nbody; this building would be adequate for research work all over the\r\nSouth Pacific, and serve as a teaching institution for our N.M.P.’s.\r\nIn 1934 the Foundation granted the money for this improvement. On\r\nmy return from a three weeks survey in New Zealand I had brought\r\nback plans, drawn up by their experts, so that we could include a\r\nbiochemical laboratory in the plant. Dr. Macpherson, our newly acquired\r\nbacteriologist, had meanwhile decided with Mr. Campbell that another\r\nbuilding must be added and that most of our old equipment must be\r\njunked--these items would come to around £2,500 more.\r\n\r\nDr. Heiser had stipulated that the Colony should bear the cost of\r\nequipment. Fiji’s wisely economical Chief Medical Officer, Dr. McGusty,\r\nthought that £500 would cover everything. Campbell and Macpherson\r\nfinally convinced him that four times that amount would be needed,\r\nand they were right, I thought. I was more or less a referee in this\r\nargument between one Irishman and two Scotchmen. But we finally got\r\nour beautiful laboratory for research and for practical instruction in\r\npreventive medicine.\r\n\r\nThese facts and figures are just to show, in brief, the time and the\r\neffort it cost us all to bring things to anything like a satisfactory\r\nconclusion. In 1935 Mr. E. J. Theodore, an Australian mining man, gave\r\n£5,000 for a children’s ward in the Hospital. That was a generous gift.\r\nBut in my absence somebody decided to place the addition right next\r\nto our Central Medical School, so near that the noise would interrupt\r\nlectures; the idea behind it was to create a nuisance that would\r\ncompel us to move the School off the Memorial Hospital grounds.... The\r\npoliticos had been playing with our plan ever since we began building.\r\n\r\nIt required the long arm of Sir Murchison Fletcher, Fiji’s fair-minded\r\nand progressive Governor, to scotch the plot. In 1936, when I went\r\nto London to confer with Sir Thomas Stanton, Britain’s Chief Medical\r\nOfficer, Stanton must have heard from Fletcher, for he asked me if I\r\nwas satisfied with the location of the children’s ward. I said, “No!”\r\nexplosively, and Stanton cabled Fletcher not to do anything about that\r\nbuilding until I got back and talked to him. Fletcher, aside from being\r\nmy good friend, was an excellent bridge player and one of the best\r\nlosers I have ever sat against--a rare virtue in the Colonies where\r\nwinning any game from the Governor “isn’t done,” or is done at the\r\nrisk of his friendship. It didn’t take long for Fletcher to settle the\r\nmatter of that spite-building, and in our favor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third of the schemes which Montague and I had formulated succeeded\r\n“in effect” in 1927. That was the Unified Medical Service for the\r\nSouth Pacific. We got another half-loaf there; the other half was\r\nlost through Montague’s sense of honor, combined with the hen-minded\r\njealousy of Fiji’s very little Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\nMy ruling ambition, all the time I was down there, was to tighten up\r\nthe loose and scattered medical authority on all the island groups. The\r\nonly hope was to centralize power, or nothing would ever get done. We\r\nhad centralized it in the Mokogai leper colony, an unqualified success.\r\nWe had centralized it more and more in the Medical School, where the\r\nsame professional education was being given to natives from the four\r\ncomers of Oceania. Suva had grown to be the South Pacific’s medical\r\ncenter, and the one logical thing was to vest the whole public health\r\nauthority in Fiji’s Chief Medical Officer.\r\n\r\nThat seemed simple, for the Colonial Governors were behind us. Then\r\npolitics came in through the door and common sense flew out of the\r\nwindow. My plan was to put Fiji’s medical chief at the head of this\r\nwide service as Central Medical Authority with additional pay of\r\n£300--little enough, especially when you take into consideration his\r\nincreased duties, which would involve personal visits of inspection to\r\nall the island groups. The Foundation agreed to pay fifty per cent of\r\nthis sum for a period of four years.\r\n\r\nAll set to go. But were we? Dr. Montague’s honor chided him to a\r\ndecision that he would accept no money that was not paid to him by the\r\nEmpire that he served. Sir Eyre Hutson, then Governor, agreed that the\r\nHigh Commission Group would pay it all; but Montague objected that he\r\ndid not deserve the extra stipend, as I would be doing practically all\r\nthe work. We were stuck on that point. The annual pay of £300, added to\r\nMontague’s salary of £1,100, would have been an inducement sufficient\r\nto attract an excellent man. But to ask anything like a first-class\r\nphysician to devote all his time and energy to the Unified Service for\r\n£1,000 a year was simply out of the question.\r\n\r\nWhen Montague retired, I raised the question again, and struck an\r\nobstacle no larger than a gallstone, and quite as tormenting. It was\r\nthe little bureaucratic mind of Fiji’s Colonial Secretary, who sat\r\naround all day worrying for fear that somebody in the Government would\r\nbe making a halfpenny more than he did. You know the type. There’s\r\none--at least--in every American county courthouse. Mr. Colonial\r\nSecretary sat brooding, “Ha! If that rule goes through, the C.M.O. will\r\nbe topping my salary!”\r\n\r\nWell, it didn’t go through. During my London visit in 1936, I discussed\r\nthe deadlock with Sir Thomas Stanton. He said, “It’s a splendid idea,\r\nand it would take hardly any new machinery to put it over. It has my\r\nhearty approval.” But Fiji’s Colonial Secretary belonged to another\r\nbranch of the service, over which Stanton had no power. Suva’s petty\r\npolitician held a strategic corner where he could pop a pinch of sand\r\ninto the wheel. Unfortunately all my suggestions have been pigeonholed.\r\n\r\nIn 1927 the Unified Medical Service had been voted in--on a small\r\nscale. It was devised to control the High Commission groups only; five\r\nin all. New Zealand, who had endorsed the idea from the first, was\r\nclamoring to come in. But our Colonial Secretary couldn’t see it that\r\nway. Somebody would be getting too much power, with the run of all\r\nthose islands. Therefore New Zealand was out.... All so like a chapter\r\nfrom the history of New York’s Republican Party--or Democratic.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this I found myself appointed to the sonorous position of\r\nDeputy Central Medical Authority, under the Chief Medical Officer as\r\nCentral Medical Authority, who controlled the health work of the five\r\ngroups. As he had never visited all these groups, and I had, I was\r\nkept quite busy as his adviser. In 1934 the Medical Authority went\r\ninto fuller effect, so that the Chief could make the rounds and study\r\nconditions at first hand. The other day Dr. McGusty, now Chief Medical\r\nOfficer, wrote me that these visits had become a part of his routine.\r\n\r\nHere is something from my files. It is headlined “Memorandum for Dr.\r\nMcGusty.”\r\n\r\n Based on personal experience with administrations in the South Seas\r\n since 1916, I regret to record that nowhere in the world have I\r\n found so large a percentage of doctors who discredited the medical\r\n profession and the various governments that employed them. Poor\r\n organization is another important factor.... I have been greatly\r\n interested in the efforts of (Governor) Sir Murchison Fletcher to\r\n bring about more effective aid. The plan to amalgamate the medical\r\n services of Tonga, Gilbert and Ellices, Samoa and other groups with\r\n Fiji is an important step to make the service more attractive and draw\r\n to it the type of man and woman who may be counted upon to bring about\r\n a vast improvement....\r\n\r\nThis document, in its original, was signed, “Victor G. Heiser.” When\r\nlast heard of, however, the local Colonial Secretary was still pouring\r\nsand into the dynamo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFacts, figures, politics--those were all long rows to hoe. Now back\r\nto my School--I still call it mine, although it has passed into other\r\nhands. When you watch young people grow in body and intelligence you\r\nseem to grow with them. Despite my work in other fields, I was very\r\nclose to them all for ten years, marking their improvement and their\r\ndeficiencies. We had to make allowances for the first batch that\r\ncame to us when we opened for business; they had been sent rather\r\nhelter-skelter, but did surprisingly well under the circumstances.\r\nBecause there were far more applicants than we could handle, we\r\nstiffened the entrance examinations all along the line. No more\r\nsentimentality in the choosing, and no political favoritism. We opened\r\nwith forty boys, but with increased accommodations we soon had fifty.\r\nWhen we considered taking care of sixty there was a nervous murmur in\r\nSuva: “Pretty soon we’ll be overrun with N.M.P.’s and not need the\r\nSchool any more.” That was ridiculous, for the increase in graduates\r\nwas far behind Fiji’s increase in population. Not to mention the needs\r\nof other island groups, clamoring for more places. I was always afraid\r\nthat the School would be voted out of existence, for some unreasonable\r\nreason like the one I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nAustralia never sent any students from Papua or New Guinea; they\r\nstill maintained that these natives were too “backward.” I had worked\r\nin the jungle with Papuan and New Guinea boys, and I knew that they\r\nwere no more backward than the inhabitants of the Solomon Islands and\r\nNew Hebrides, who were represented with us from the first. I still\r\nfeel that Australia, with her tremendous problem, will never make any\r\nprogress with native health until she establishes some institution\r\nsimilar to the one in Suva--which is out of the question now, because\r\nthey haven’t the proper set-up. Sydney has an admirable school of\r\ntropical medicine and hygiene--for whites. It lacks both the clinical\r\nmaterial and the stuff to cope with natives, and native conditions.\r\nOnce in a great while this school will take in a black boy, merely to\r\nexhibit him as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am a co-educationalist; I have never settled that point with\r\nmyself. But I feel very sure that no race advances very far unless its\r\nwomen advance with it. On the strength of that theory I made every\r\neffort to improve the condition of native student nurses. When the\r\nEuropean nurses of the War Memorial moved to larger quarters I was\r\nglad to see the native girls housed in the abandoned building, a great\r\nimprovement on what they had had.\r\n\r\nSteps had been taken toward their advanced education. Before admission\r\nthe young girls were given a course in the Methodist mission school,\r\nlargely to teach them the rudiments of English. A Rockefeller\r\nFoundation fellowship sent a European nurse to the States to educate\r\nher in the modern theory and practice of training nurses. She returned\r\nin 1940 to open a school for native nurses, which would synchronize\r\ntheoretical instruction with practical work in the hospital. Thus they\r\nwould attain as high a rating in their profession as the N.M.P.’s in\r\ntheirs. In outlying Fijian districts it was the policy to send out two\r\nnative nurses with each N.M.P., to take care of two very important\r\nitems: infant welfare and obstetrical cases.\r\n\r\nI was pleased by the many marriages of these young women and our\r\npractitioners; they were usually happy. I fondly believed that two\r\nequal minds, mated in a common interest, would have all the advantages\r\nfrom the start. I was seldom disappointed. In the field the young wife\r\nwas her husband’s busy partner. If she retired to her village to settle\r\ndown and have babies, she brought modern methods into her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFor many of the boys the English language was a stumbling block,\r\nespecially at first. The Polynesian students both spoke and wrote it\r\nwell; New Zealand had taken care of that. But the Melanesians were\r\nanother matter; during the first years of the School they came to\r\nus with nothing better than a smattering of English. We corrected\r\nthat in time by requiring a preliminary course in English for all\r\ncandidates. Even then they were handicapped, and it was interesting to\r\nsee the Melanesian patience with which they slowly struggled through\r\nthe mystery of our grammar, until they could rival their Polynesian\r\nclassmates.\r\n\r\nAs underclassmen the boys from the Cooks and Samoa, to whom English was\r\na second language, worked on the inferiority complex of Fijians and\r\nSolomon Islanders. Then as years went on, we watched the Melanesian\r\nlads begin to pull up. No, sir, they weren’t going to let a lot of\r\nblithering Polynesians beat them at any game. They pored over books,\r\nthey wrote reams, they spoke English among themselves and corrected one\r\nanother’s compositions. Sir Maynard Hedstrom was offering a senior year\r\ngold medal for excellence in Public Health studies. The Polynesians\r\nwere bright enough to win it more often than not, but as upperclassmen\r\nthey had to put up a lively fight to outdo the Melanesians. The earnest\r\nand industrious black fellows clawed their way to the top, every hour\r\nof that four-year course.\r\n\r\nHere’s a classroom scene, picturing the competitive spirit:--\r\n\r\n [_Numa, a Cook Islander, is pointing at a skeleton and asking\r\n questions. He addresses Daniele, from the New Hebrides. Daniele is\r\n blue black, but not negroid. His eyes are circled with white and his\r\n white teeth glisten as he tries to concentrate on something he knows\r\n perfectly well, but can’t express in English. Or if he can express it,\r\n it will come hard. He has to mine it out. Daniele is the one I liked\r\n to put on the front seat and rag, knowing that he would agonize over\r\n the answer, but would finally get it right._\r\n\r\n NUMA: How many bones in the human hand?\r\n\r\n DANIELE: Eight. (_After an inner struggle._)\r\n\r\n NUMA: Right! (_Daniele shows a thousand dollars’ worth of perfect\r\n teeth._)\r\n\r\n [_Numa turns to Mu, who is not very bright for a Samoan._\r\n\r\n NUMA: What bones are affected by a Colles’s fracture?\r\n\r\n [_Mu groans and hesitates. He won’t give up, but Numa is tired of\r\n waiting, so he passes it to Tatoa, a dark, chunky Gilbertese who\r\n usually knows the answer._\r\n\r\n TATOA: The radius ulna.\r\n\r\n [_Sounds of approval from the whole class, and a rather shocked\r\n expression because Mu knows so little._\r\n\r\nAs an example of the steady, capable Fijian mind I think I should\r\nselect Sowani, born a chief and mentally so well endowed that he\r\nbecame probably the outstanding one of the old School’s graduates.\r\nHe served in the Gilbert and Ellices for some thirty years, and had\r\nbeen stationed there for a long time when I first met him. European\r\ndoctors might come and go, but most of the Europeans wanted Sowani\r\nwhen they were sick. During the First World War he was made Acting\r\nSenior Medical Officer, the highest medical position in the Group.\r\nThe Government appreciated his services by giving him a salary and\r\nallowance which permitted him a European standard of living. About the\r\ntime I left Fiji he retired on a pension and was decorated by the King,\r\nquite a distinction for a native boy. When I made my survey he had\r\ncompleted his 20,000th operation for glands in the neck; his surgery\r\nwas beautiful. Incoming Senior Medical Officers in the G. & E. were\r\nsqueamish about being successors to the dark-skinned Practitioner. When\r\npatients called for him in preference to the white doctors, poor Sowani\r\nwould remain the pattern of etiquette. “Mr. So-and-So had called for\r\nyou, Doctor,” he would say; but when the white physician called, the\r\npatient was disappointed. One candid and sick Australian said, “Get\r\nout, you Son of Something! It’s Sowani I want.” Sowani was always to be\r\ncounted on. He was a Fijian.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked over the classes in our growing school, with no intent\r\nto play favorites--for I think I know the contrasting virtues of these\r\ntwo fine races--I could not help but see that in practical application\r\nthe Fijian was far superior to the Samoan and the Cook Islander. The\r\nlatter were brilliant in theory, but set a Fijian to reasoning a thing\r\nout for himself and his conclusions were more apt to be right, for\r\nthe slow logic of his mind was almost Scottish. Principal Clunie and\r\nI watched the work of one plum-colored Fijian named Ravuki. Ravuki\r\nwasn’t worth his salt, at first, and was too lazy to put on his own\r\n_lavalava_. But in his senior year he developed a burst of speed that\r\nwas quite astonishing. He fairly shone in the preventive medicine\r\ncourse. He blazed his way forward at such a pace that he threatened the\r\nperformance of Alo, a Tongan boy who had been the School’s wonder and\r\nhad walked away with all the prizes. In the final examination Ravuki\r\nseemed to have the edge on Alo. I was afraid that my affection for Fiji\r\nhad biased my judgment, so I ordered a second examination and called in\r\ntwo European physicians to sit with me as referees. This time the Fiji\r\nboy was so good that he was still talking when the two other judges\r\nmade up their minds that he had won hands down.\r\n\r\nRavuki became one of our most successful N.M.P.’s, and like most\r\nFijians, almost tragically conscientious. Right after graduation he was\r\nsent out to the jungle to control a typhoid epidemic. In his work our\r\nprize pupil picked up a typhoid germ--and was so ashamed of it that he\r\nrefused to visit the School, all the time I was there.\r\n\r\nHis upper-class rival, Alo, had a much more romantic story when he\r\nwent into practice. Principal Clunie--and a “damn good man” as we say\r\nunofficially--was something of a prize winner himself. He started with\r\nthe rank of tutor, and before he was through with it Australia gave him\r\na gold medal for his work among native races. Well, if I unconsciously\r\nplayed favorites with Ravuki, Clunie was much inclined toward Alo,\r\nand had such faith in his ability that he gave him special favors in\r\nsurgery. Alo got to be as good a surgeon as you could ask for anywhere.\r\n\r\nHe was so capable that the C.M.O. of Tonga let him do surgery there.\r\nWhen Alo was put in charge of the Haapai group, the medico of the\r\nVavau group was much annoyed, for all his surgical work began going to\r\nHaapai. The young Practitioner had set eyes on a pretty girl of a noble\r\nHaapai family, and was in despair because his sweetheart’s parents\r\nobjected to his humble lineage. All the traders and other Europeans\r\nwere in sympathy with the Romeo and Juliet situation, and from one of\r\nthe sympathizers Alo borrowed a sea-going launch and filled it with\r\ngas. This was on Sunday night when all good Christians were at church.\r\nVery conveniently the girl stepped out of church and into the boat.\r\nWhen her family came out to give chase they found that all the launches\r\nin the dock were out of commission. Somebody had drained off the gas\r\nand crippled the engines.\r\n\r\nThe job of selecting boys for our School was never an easy one.\r\nDifferent races and different environment had to be taken into\r\nconsideration. In Fiji we advertised for candidates, and the\r\ncompetitive examinations included the three R’s, plus a certain\r\nknowledge of English. We had to compromise between the over-young and\r\nthe over-old. Boys from fifteen to sixteen would graduate too young.\r\nThose of twenty had been out of school too long. In the matter of\r\nsending incompetents, I had to visit several island groups and lecture\r\nthe Europeans on their duty to keep up the standard. This brought\r\nabout the rigid tests we required, and with satisfactory results. Two\r\nvisiting English medical professors pleased me by saying that our boys\r\nin daily recitation compared favorably with students of the same grade\r\nin the University of London’s Medical School.\r\n\r\nThe matter of habit and custom had to be attended to. We had to\r\ntreat them all as equals, and strike some common denominator. The\r\nlads from the Solomon Islands and New Hebrides--before well educated\r\nhalf-castes came to us--had never eaten off a table or sat in a chair.\r\nTheir _milieu_ was the floor. To give them credit in the eyes of the\r\nsophisticated Polynesians we must teach them certain rudimentary table\r\nmanners. The Samoan and Cook Island boys, on the other hand, often\r\nshowed up at the Grand Pacific Hotel’s dances in tail coats and stiff\r\nshirts.\r\n\r\nThis was something of a situation, in the School’s first years. Our\r\nPolynesians weren’t quite at ease with their low-browed associates.\r\nThen, to their credit, they began to see what it was all about, and\r\nthings straightened out to a generally loyal corps spirit. We saw the\r\ndanger of over-Europeanizing them; for they must not return to their\r\nhomes and be discontented with island ways. We always put more stress\r\non cleanly, sanitary habits than “fussy fixin’s” like tablecloths. Some\r\nof our students who had been too Europeanized by New Zealand before\r\nthey came did not turn out so well. They knew so much already that they\r\nsaw no necessity to work for what they got. It was another case of the\r\nhare and the tortoise; or, more properly, the hare became the tortoise\r\nand loafed on the job.\r\n\r\nThere was one of our Cook Islanders whose scholastic record was so\r\nunusual that the Administration there wanted to send him to London to\r\ncomplete his education, until I seriously objected. Such a precedent\r\nwould fill the School with jealous discontent. The Cook Islands, I\r\nfound later, had spoiled the boy so badly that he acquired vicious\r\nhabits. He had enough character to reform himself, but not until his\r\nPractitionership was taken away from him.\r\n\r\nHis was an exceptional case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy volunteer marriage bureau for Practitioners and native nurses\r\nbecame an unqualified success. In Fiji the quality of nurses was\r\nimproving all the time, and before long an especially pretty one was a\r\nmarked girl the minute she got her diploma. There have been many such\r\nmarriages, and there would be still more if it were not for the native\r\nmissionaries, who are cutting ahead of our boys. In Samoa, where the\r\nNew Zealand system turns out Polynesian nurses who are sweet as sugar\r\nand smart as chain lightning, it is almost taken for granted that an\r\nN.M.P. will lead one to the altar, or make a brave try at it.\r\n\r\nA cross-eyed Samoan named Tongamau, one of our brightest and best,\r\nmarried a native nurse. Both he and his young wife had specialized\r\non infant feeding, so after the baby was born and had attained a few\r\nmonths’ growth Tongamau took him off breast-feeding and decided to\r\nbring him up entirely on native food. On that basis the Tongamaus\r\nworked out a whole formula of infant diet and composed careful\r\ninstructions for preparing the ingredients, the change and weight\r\nof meals from week to week, and so on. Tongamau’s account of this\r\nsuccessful experiment was first printed in our school publication\r\n_The Native Medical Practitioner_ and was widely reviewed in standard\r\nmedical journals.\r\n\r\nN.M.P. Okeseni also married a native nurse, and his article in the same\r\npublication reveals another Practitioner’s cleverness in the use of\r\nmaterials at hand. (Okeseni, by the way, is the Samoan pronunciation\r\nof “oxygen.”) Okeseni’s essay is entitled “Coconut Fiber Used in\r\nLigatures,” and says, “... I was thinking ... that the fibers of the\r\nhusk could be used instead of silkworm gut; for they are protected from\r\nany outside contamination....” He employed them successfully in many\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nAny copy of the _Practitioner_ is worth looking over for interesting\r\narticles, written in businesslike professional English. “General\r\nPractice in Native Villages of Fiji,” by N.M.P. Ieni; “Foodstuffs\r\nin the Gilbert Islands,” by Third-Year Student Arobati Hicking; and\r\nthere’s one called “Medical Work on Rennell Island” by N.M.P. Hughie\r\nWheatley which I especially remember. He is the half-caste son of\r\nNorman Wheatley, the yacht-collector; and Hughie’s article tells how he\r\nadopted a four-months-old Rennellese baby whose mother was too feeble\r\nto nurse it; he saved the child with a diet of native food, somewhat\r\nafter Tongamau’s formula.\r\n\r\nI have watched the lives of all my boys, going out into the world.\r\nThere was Tau Cowan, a half-British Cook Islander who married out\r\nof his profession. The girl he picked was a daughter of the King of\r\nRarotonga; she had been beautifully educated in New Zealand, and has\r\nmade him a good wife; Tau has become one of our outstanding graduates.\r\n\r\nJohn Numa, on the other hand, found his wife in an insane asylum. She\r\nwas far from crazy; in fact she was the native warder’s daughter. It\r\nwas the warder’s reason that was endangered, for John’s courtship was\r\nso hot and heavy that I was called in, and a minister was immediately\r\nsummoned. Some of the whites wanted to make a scandal out of John’s\r\nbehavior--which was not scandalous according to the native code--but\r\nthe couple went to the Cooks, where Mrs. Numa was a great social hit\r\nand became the successful rival of a lady who had long ruled the roost,\r\na half-caste official wife. John Numa made an outstanding survey of the\r\nleper situation on Penrhyn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe went in for athletics, of course, and a school band. Ielu Kuresa,\r\na Samoan, organized the band, and as he conducted the popular tunes\r\nhis pale scholar’s face was filled with the spiritual earnestness that\r\nfinally led him to his death. Mesalume, the husky Fijian, was a Lau\r\nboy, and a contrast in character. We taught him to box, and when he\r\nwas matched with Helu, a Tongan about twice his size, Mesalume put him\r\nout in the third round with a stiff one on the chin. This Fijian was a\r\nnatural athlete, and the mainstay of our football team.\r\n\r\nIelu and Mesalume--contrasting types of contrasting races, they met the\r\nsame end in the line of duty.\r\n\r\nI have a sort of father’s affection for the natives of all the\r\ngroups, but my admiration always turns back to the Fijian, a tower of\r\nstrength, who never lets you down when you need him. I have seen so\r\nmany of them go out into the field and do far more than their share,\r\nfar better than their competitors,--dignified, ethical medical men.\r\n\r\nMesalume had great force of character, and an intellectual\r\nindependence. Once I had to intervene when he got into an argument\r\nwith an Australian nurse in the War Memorial. The delicate point was\r\nthat Mesalume was right, but a colored boy was not supposed to have\r\nan opinion of his own. It took diplomacy to get him out of that mess.\r\nHis reaction was very Scottish. “I still think so,” he told me in\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nEarly in the School’s career we organized their teams, intramural\r\naffairs. True, it was not American football, but the more open Rugby.\r\nWith the gusto of old gridiron experience, I saw that their play could\r\nbe just as rough as ours. Men like Mesalume played for the glory of\r\nFiji, for the Fijian is “unco’ proud” of his strength and skill. The\r\nonly disharmony that ever arose in the Medical School was when the\r\nboys were choosing players; the Polynesians all ganged up against the\r\nFijians, and vice versa, most definitely. When we crystallized into a\r\nunit we played against the Police Team, the Agricultural Department and\r\nabout six other organizations. The pick of our boys got the “shield,”\r\nand some were chosen for the much coveted All Fiji Team. The chosen\r\nones were Fijians, with no exception. And Mesalume, of course, was one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nIn a series of inter-island battles the All Fijis met the famous New\r\nZealand Maoris, who had bowled over about everything they had met,\r\nwherever Rugby was played. When Fiji met Maori it was a different\r\nstory, “all blood and guts,” as an Australian critic expressed\r\nit. Our native boys had the advantage because they could kick\r\nbarefoot--wonderful, how they could do it. They would come on the field\r\nin the regulation Rugby uniform, but after the first scrimmage the air\r\nwould be full of shoes and stockings--the Fijians were rushing into\r\nbattle as their cannibal grandsires did, with naked toes and tiger\r\nhearts. Then larger objects would come soaring out of the huddle;\r\nthe bodies of Maoris, falling with a deadly plunk. In reprisal the\r\nflying Maoris would come back with a thud that was like a convulsion\r\nof nature. Their convulsion was more deadly in the last game of one\r\nseries. We of Fiji were small-minded enough to say, “Well, let ’em have\r\nit this time. The officials were all New Zealanders, and they couldn’t\r\nlet their champions go home again with nothing to show for it.”\r\n\r\nPride of race takes some queer turns. The one Negro in Fiji was a\r\ncoal-black American who said, “Yassa, I was de first white man on the\r\nMba River.” Pride of race was rampant in Peti, one of our Samoans, who\r\nnever failed to boast of his American blood. His grandfather was a\r\nNegro sailor. On the strength of this distinction he won the hand of a\r\nwell-born Fijian half-caste and took her back to Samoa. He was another\r\none who did great credit to the School.\r\n\r\nOur Fijian N.M.P. Eroni came from Lau, where the people are\r\nfair-skinned as Polynesians. When he worked alone on Rennell it was\r\nquite understandable that he should have gained the reputation of being\r\nthe first “white man” who had penetrated half the island. Eroni’s\r\nsuccess among white residents of the Solomons was so great that one\r\nlady wrote to a Sydney paper to thank him for saving her life and her\r\nsister’s. Such achievements are a commonplace in Fiji; Britishers in\r\nthe back country argue about the attainments of an N.M.P. as we people\r\nat home discuss the family doctor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of these days, a Fijian basso will sing Otello’s role in the\r\nMetropolitan Opera House. If you have ever heard their deep, true\r\nvoices you will agree with me. And if you have ever watched the action\r\nof their mighty thews on the playing field, you may well believe that\r\na world’s heavyweight champion will also emerge from one of these dark\r\nislands. So far, however, they have much to learn. I read of one who\r\nwent to London to meet a middleweight; but since the sports columns are\r\nnot featuring him, I think he may not have done so well.\r\n\r\nThere is a gigantic fellow named Ratu Mbola who has degenerated into\r\na half-Europeanized show-off, and throws out his chest when the boats\r\ncome in in hopes that somebody will buy him a drink. To distinguish\r\nhimself from the common herd he wears golf socks, and tennis shoes, and\r\ncarries a fly-brush over his shoulder. “Bar Fly” is the name both he\r\nand his brush have earned.\r\n\r\nIn days gone by when Jack Johnson became champion of the world by\r\ndefeating Tommy Burns in Australia there was rejoicing in every Fijian\r\nvillage. “One of our race has conquered!” was the cry. At that time\r\nRatu Mbola was in his prime, a muscular chief of Mbau. On the way\r\nhome from his defeat Tommy Burns stopped off at Suva and the hushed\r\nword went through the villages, “He’s running away from the black man\r\nwho beat him!” So Ratu Mbola came forth as a local black hope, and\r\nchallenged Mr. Burns. The evening of the fight the arena was packed\r\nwith natives who thronged in to see a white man crumple under a volley\r\nof Fijian blows. But somehow Tommy didn’t crumple. He played cat and\r\nmouse for two rounds, pretending to be groggy from Mbola’s blows. In\r\nthe first minute of the third he got tired of making false passes and\r\nfloored Mbola with one heartbreaking uppercut. The referee did not\r\nrender a decision. He didn’t have a chance. Mbola went through the\r\nropes on all fours, and when next seen was running down the street,\r\nwaving his boxing gloves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll of this was quite unfair to the Fijian. It was like taking him to\r\nthe piano and asking him to play a Bach fugue. Mesalume, as an athlete\r\nand professional man, was of a quite different pattern. We sent him\r\nto the New Hebrides, a field that would try the soul of any man. His\r\nreports came in; he was administering medicine in feverish jungles that\r\nhad been beyond the reach of government officials. He was treating\r\nthousands for every disease under the tropical sun. Mr. Paton, always\r\nthe stanch friend of my N.M.P.’s, took him in when he could and worried\r\nbecause the boy was so overworked.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mesalume’s reports stopped coming in. What had happened to\r\nhim? Then a letter from Mr. Paton:--\r\n\r\n ... Mr. Siller, an Austrian, at South West Bay, Malekula, had\r\n blackwater fever. Dr. Mesalume treated him, and thought that he was\r\n on the mend. But Mr. Siller died next day. Dr. Mesalume contracted\r\n blackwater fever. Mr. Corlette was most kindly and attentive, but Dr.\r\n M. died. We are all deeply grieved. He was always so willing and keen\r\n to help.... I remember what pride he had in his Medical College, and\r\n I think that he would have increased its usefulness.... He earned the\r\n respect of the natives, so that the nearest village of Tatau had made\r\n a yam garden for him, without pay....\r\n\r\nI went to the New Hebrides and found the place where he had died on\r\nduty, in a remote corner of the jungle. Mesalume, like all the men\r\nof Lau, had a passionate love of home, and this was so far away, so\r\ncompletely lonely.... Wild black faces had stared in at the window,\r\nwondering what he was saying in his delirious ramblings. Blackwater\r\nfever might have killed him; nobody really knew. I did the sentimental\r\nthing, I suppose, when I asked the Condominium Government to mark his\r\ngrave. They put up a handsome concrete block with some of his history\r\non it and the epitaph, “He Died in a Foreign Country.” Yes, he had\r\ngiven the best he had to save life, and when his time came he had died\r\nthe death of a lonely dog. I had always thought that something like\r\nthat would happen to me. But, God, here I am!\r\n\r\nAfter this death we could have got a dozen to go up there and take his\r\nplace. That’s the Fijian for you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIelu, his Samoan classmate, was another story, just as tragic. When\r\nhe died on duty Dr. Heiser said it was one of the greatest losses\r\nimaginable for the Pacific. Ielu had worked for his own people with the\r\nfiery zeal of a priest. Through all his training in the Medical School\r\nhe sweated his way upward with one ambition: to go home and bring help\r\nto his own Samoans. His tall, slender figure was forever bending over\r\nbooks, his luminous brown eyes drinking in the useful facts that would\r\ncontribute to his future. He was monastic in his self-effacement. He\r\nshould have been a lonely type, but underneath his detachment there was\r\na warmth which made him popular with his classmates, and he became a\r\nleader in student activities.\r\n\r\nWell, he went back to Samoa, and I was a bit nervous about what might\r\nhappen to him. The Mau Rebellion was in full swing, and with his\r\nzealous temperament I was afraid that he would be in it up to the\r\nears. Instead of that, he became the bellwether that kept the sane\r\nones in line. He was there as a doctor, and never for a moment did he\r\nforget his duty to the Medical Administration. I have one vivid memory\r\nof Ielu in action. It was on a Samoan back porch, none too roomy at\r\nbest, and the patient’s relatives were crowded around the table with\r\nthe usual prayers and palaver. Dr. Hunt, the C.M.O., was with me to\r\nwatch the operation, which was for an elephantoid scrotum. With people\r\nthreatening to jog his elbow, with relatives yammering in his ear, Ielu\r\nhandled his instruments with concentrated exactitude. When it was over\r\nand Ielu was washing up, Dr. Hunt said softly, “I wish I could get as\r\ngood a job as that in the Apia Hospital.”\r\n\r\nIn March, 1936, an epidemic of influenza broke out in Upolu and Ielu\r\ncame down with it. He was always working on the hairline of his\r\nstrength; and with the emergency of the epidemic he was called from\r\nhis sickbed to give aid. He put in days of long hours before his\r\nexhausted heart gave out. He died in Dr. Pat Monaghan’s arms. The\r\nSamoan obituaries did not need to tell me that they had lost a surgeon\r\nwho was on his way to greatness. A Samoan student, writing about him in\r\nour _Native Medical Practitioner_, told the simple truth when he said,\r\n“He died in harness.... He was kind to the human race and all loved\r\nhim.” The Samoan Administration established the Ielu Kuresa Gold Medal\r\nin his memory, and generously marked it _For the best Fijian of the\r\nyear_. That was their gratitude to us for giving them Ielu.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe passing of these brave and devoted men still touches me so deeply\r\nthat I seldom speak of them. Another one who died is still more tragic\r\nto me, for that death was not so long ago. Last summer a letter from\r\nFiji came to me at my California home. It was from Malakai and told\r\nme that Vakatawa, who had been my assistant, had committed suicide. I\r\ncouldn’t understand it. Vakatawa had stood like a rock and worked like\r\na hero in every assignment I had given him. An expert on tuberculosis,\r\nhe had examined all the chests in the Colos, and his reports were\r\nworks of art in their scientific accuracy. He had his sense of humor,\r\ntoo. Once I sent him on a survey over a far corner of Viti Levu, and\r\nhe came back with nothing but a tattered _lavalava_ and his boxes of\r\nequipment. It turned out that a fishing party from Mbengga had met him\r\non the coast and stripped him of every rag he had on; they gutted his\r\nsuitcases, relieved him of five pounds cash, left him naked on the\r\nbeach. Pretty rough work, but it was an old-time custom when the people\r\nof Mbengga met the people of Lau, and vice versa. Vakatawa had fought\r\nso hard for his microscope and other scientific items that they decided\r\nto let him keep them. Quite unembittered, he had borrowed a _lavalava_\r\nand come home smiling. When I said, “I guess I’ll go out and survey\r\nMbengga myself,” Vakatawa chuckled, “Better not, Doctor. They’ll strip\r\nyou too, because you’re with me.”\r\n\r\nThose who knew him well said of Vakatawa, “He has the mind of a\r\nfirst-class white man.” That remark was a bit patronizing, but it\r\nexpressed the general confidence in him. He had gone very deeply into\r\nthe study of magic, and to his reports I owe a great deal of what I\r\nlearned about _draunikau_ and the ritual of the seven curses.[7]\r\n\r\nDid Vakatawa end his life as the result of some magic wish? That was\r\nout of the question. Time and again, he had outfaced the witch doctors\r\nwith practical lessons in modern medicine, and he was too well-loved\r\namong the villages for anybody to put a curse on him. I have looked\r\ninto Vakatawa’s case as best I could from where I sit and where he\r\nlies, and I think I know the reason why he locked himself in his room\r\nand put a razor blade across his wrists. Always a sensitive man, he had\r\na sensitive man’s high temper, which his racial courtesy seldom allowed\r\nto get the better of him. But that hot temper got him into some sort\r\nof brawl, and after it was over he felt that he had disgraced himself\r\nand had not lived up to his responsibilities as a Practitioner. He was\r\ninordinately proud of his profession, and when his brooding mind told\r\nhim that he had let the School down, he decided that there was no use\r\nliving any longer.\r\n\r\nI give Vakatawa an honored place among those who died in the line of\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur little School has grown, and is growing. My constant hope is that\r\nits roots have gone so deep into the soil of Fiji that no political\r\nwhim or Anglo-Saxon prejudice shall ever blast it in some clumsy\r\nattempt at transplanting. Already we have sent out well over a hundred\r\ncompetent medical men; not many, perhaps, in the millions of ocean\r\nmiles which their work must cover. But their efficiency shows in the\r\ngeneral improvement in health wherever they have operated.\r\n\r\nTo the outsider it may seem a bit incredible that the descendants of\r\ncannibals--and the majority of them are just that--should be devoting\r\ntheir young talents to saving life, where their ancestors were bent on\r\ndestroying it. But to me the protean change is a very logical thing.\r\nThe cannibals were anatomists, and their gruesome habits made them\r\nfamiliar with the set-up of the human body. Just as Roman surgeons\r\nstudied the victims dragged from the arena, so the wiser of the\r\nanthropophagi observed and learned. Neither ways were pretty roads to\r\nknowledge, but strange things have happened in the Martyrdom of Man.\r\n\r\nAs I lectured the students in the postmortem theater I often paused in\r\ninterest at the skill of this one and that, plying the knife. No one\r\nof them had ever seen cannibalism in practice; but ancestral voices,\r\nturned friendly and benevolent, seemed to be telling them what to do.\r\n\r\nI have a photograph which I took down in Santa Ana, Solomon Islands.\r\nIt is of a brown woman, practically nude, with shark’s teeth around\r\nher neck and a long clam-hinge sticking through her nose. I think I’ve\r\ntold you how I took this picture of Mrs. Kuper, the trader’s wife. She\r\nwas holding up one small, naked boy, and another stood at her side. I\r\nhave another picture; it is of a good-looking boy, very collegiate in\r\na tweed suit and striped necktie. He would be hard to recognize as the\r\nnaked child in the first picture.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Kuper’s father was sufficiently well-to-do to send him for\r\nstudy in New Zealand. He graduated from our Central Medical, class of\r\n’38, and Sydney gave him a prize “for the most distinguished scholar\r\nof the year.” Before he took up his duties as N.M.P. in the Solomons,\r\nhe dropped in on his old school-friends in Auckland. A reporter got\r\nhold of him and Geoffrey told of the first scholastic prize he ever\r\nreceived, an honorary belt which his mother’s tribe gave him as an\r\nintroduction to manhood. It was a hard initiation. For six months he\r\nhad stayed in the ceremonial house, among the ancestral canoes and\r\nfamily skulls. Priests came to his pagan retreat to instruct him in\r\ntribal duties, which included house-building and the preparing of a yam\r\nand dalo garden.\r\n\r\nThen he was put in a fishing canoe where the priests angled until they\r\ncaught a great bonito. It was the boy’s task to wrestle with the fish\r\nand hold it until it ceased to flap. Boy and fish were taken to the\r\npagan altar where priests squeezed the bonito’s gills and let drops of\r\nblood fall into the initiate’s mouth. At the end of the long ceremony\r\nGeoffrey was taken to a high tower and allowed to throw food down to\r\nthe admiring populace. “That part was fun,” he said.\r\n\r\nA graduate Practitioner, Geoffrey had been away from his mother’s tribe\r\nso long that he had forgotten her inherited language. But his father,\r\na very progressive European, wanted his son to have the best of our\r\ncivilization. He was right, I think, for Geoffrey is doing fine work in\r\nthe Solomons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIN RETROSPECT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Pacific’s halfway house, Suva has become more and more of a\r\nstopping-off place for the great and the near-great. Royalty, inquiring\r\nnovelists and scientific bigwigs have come in the regular way, by sea.\r\nThe first visitor from the sky was Kingsford-Smith, and because he must\r\nhave trees cut down from the parade ground to make a safe landing, Suva\r\nwas in a dither. The residents loved those trees so fondly that they\r\ndidn’t start to fell them until after they learned that the aviator’s\r\nplane was well on its way from Hawaii. Then down they came, and when\r\nthe giant bird roared in it was probably the high moment in Fijian\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nEnglish princes and royal dukes weren’t exactly a commonplace. Their\r\ncomings and goings threw the colony into a patriotic frenzy. Before\r\nthe then Prince of Wales decided on “the woman I love” Suva all but\r\ngave him a coronation. The Duke of Gloucester’s visit in 1935 caused a\r\nsocial upheaval among the natives, who were preparing a colossal dance\r\nin his honor. Many of the boys, in imitation of European styles, had\r\nbeen cutting off their great bundles of hair. The master of ceremonies\r\ngave it out that no dancer would be eligible unless he wore the high,\r\nround hairdress of classic Fiji. One of the high chiefs of Mbau, whose\r\nhereditary privilege it was to act as cupbearer in the kava ceremony,\r\ndefied the rule and came to the dance in his college cut. He was\r\nincontinently rejected. The Duke had two Scotland Yard men with him,\r\nbut that didn’t interfere with his efforts to be democratic. He was\r\nespecially fond of the bacon-and-egg parties common in young Suva\r\nsociety after the ball; these were at about dawn, when the Duke’s\r\nwatch-dog equerry was sound asleep. After many stiff-collar affairs in\r\nthe larger colonies Gloucester found his release, I think, in Suva’s\r\nsimple, kindly hospitality.\r\n\r\nHis voyage was bothered, however, by people who were less considerate\r\nof royal democracy. As _H.M.S. Australia_ was leaving Samoa, the\r\nlittle yacht _Seth Parker_, owned by an enterprising radio star, sent\r\nout an S O S. When the _Australia_ came about for rescue work the yacht\r\nannounced: “Open your wireless set and you can hear a broadcast all\r\nover the U. S., saying that the Duke of Gloucester has come to the\r\nrescue of the _Seth Parker_.” Another coy one followed: “Won’t the Duke\r\ncome up on the bridge so that we can take his picture?” Gloucester’s\r\nsulphuric words must have raised a storm, for an hour or so after the\r\nroyal cruiser went her way a hurricane blew up, and the battered _Seth\r\nParker_ sent out another S O S, a real one this time. Dutifully the\r\n_Australia_ turned back again, and stood by for two days until a vessel\r\nfrom Pago Pago came and picked up the offensive little yacht.\r\n\r\nBefore the present King and Queen of England even dreamed of wearing\r\ncrowns they paid us a visit as Duke and Duchess of York. We met them on\r\ntwo occasions, an official ball at Government House and a more informal\r\naffair in the Grand Pacific’s ballroom. The Duke of York said that his\r\nfather had visited Fiji and had drunk the kava which they “spit in the\r\nbowl.” So that party with old Thakombau was family history. The Duchess\r\nwas what we Americans call a “nice girl,” and her poise never seemed to\r\nget in the way of her good humor. I liked the way she handled a young\r\ncadet, whom the occasion and the champagne had somewhat exhilarated.\r\nIt was contrary to custom, but he wanted to win a bet when he asked\r\nher for a dance. She said, “Sorry, my card’s full.” Well, so was the\r\nyoung cadet; he took another drink and asked her again. Again she was\r\nsorry. Next afternoon he woke with a headache and moaned, “Lord, what\r\ndid I do?” His pals were all too ready to tell him, and with flights of\r\nimagination. He prepared himself to be cashiered, but nothing happened.\r\nIt would be romantic to say that the Duchess intervened in his behalf.\r\nI doubt if she remembered his name.\r\n\r\nWhen the School was well started and I could spend more of my time in\r\nSuva’s civilized environment I occupied a crossroads position where I\r\nmet many, going and coming. Earl and Lady Beatty were guests at Sir\r\nHarry Luke’s dinner party, and I was much flattered when I found that\r\nthe Earl knew quite a lot about the School. This contact was more\r\nimpressive, perhaps, but less engaging than the one I made when the\r\nyacht _Caroline_ came in and her owner asked me to come aboard with\r\nsome medical advice. The owner was Douglas Fairbanks, and the tall,\r\nblond lady with arched eyebrows was his future wife, Lady Ashley. I\r\nremember him as a charming, unassuming host with the finest yacht I\r\nhave ever visited--the _Zaca_ not excepted. It was air-conditioned, so\r\nthat the temperature in a dozen luxurious staterooms could be lowered\r\nto taste. Fairbanks said that he slept under blankets every night in\r\nthe tropics. Suva, always broad-minded about the holy bond, made quite\r\na fuss over them, and Ratu Sukuna gave them a native dance. “Doug”\r\nwanted me to go with him on a voyage to Singapore, but I had other\r\nirons in the fire.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1938 (I think it was) I was off on field work when somebody\r\ntapped on the screen porch of our house and Eloisa went out to see who\r\nit was. A beefy gentleman looked through the wire and wanted to know\r\nif Dr. Lambert was home. No, said Eloisa, but wouldn’t he come in? “My\r\nname’s Morgan,” he said, and stayed for tea. It didn’t require a signed\r\nphotograph for Eloisa to recognize him as J. P. Morgan. In fact I had\r\nrather expected him one of these days, as Heiser had written me, saying\r\nthat when Mr. Morgan showed up I might outline a trip for him through\r\nthe islands. He stayed for a couple of hours, talking about Fiji and\r\nthe School and our work in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLater I couldn’t resist the temptation of writing him a letter, which\r\nbegan something like this:--\r\n\r\n Dear Mr. Morgan:--\r\n\r\n For years my brother Fred and I have had a standing family joke. When\r\n either of us started on a trip we would say to the other, “If J. P.\r\n Morgan calls up before I’m back, tell him I won’t sell under fifty.”\r\n I’m afraid you’ve turned the tables on us....\r\n\r\nSuch meetings, even if they were only by proxy, made bright passages in\r\nthe doctor’s notebook.\r\n\r\nOne of life’s greatest moments for me was Richard Crooks’s concert in\r\nSuva, given for the benefit of our School’s athletic fund. I cherish\r\nthis program among my fondest possessions, for on the cover it says:\r\n“RECITAL: RICHARD CROOKS.... IMPRESARIO: DR. S. M. LAMBERT.” I wasn’t\r\nchosen for my musical genius; somebody argued that as it was for the\r\nSchool, and as I had wangled Mr. Crooks into the generous gift of his\r\nvoice, I ought to furnish the American ballyhoo for an American singer.\r\nFor a day I knew how Gatti-Casazza must have felt all the time.\r\n\r\nSuva had a right to be music-hungry, for Crooks was only the second\r\nopera star who had stayed there long enough to sing, and instrumental\r\nperformers had fought shy of us. Our single connection with the\r\nmusical great was our former Government printer, Johann Sebastian\r\nBach, inheritor of an illustrious name. When Paderewski came to Suva\r\nhe didn’t play his piano; in fact he just got off the boat and got on\r\nagain. In Suva royal visitors have ceased to be a novelty. But Richard\r\nCrooks was of the Metropolitan Opera!\r\n\r\nWhen the job of taking care of him fell to me I rather dreaded it,\r\nfearing that I had to deal with some sort of seraph. However, he turned\r\nout to be much more human than many grocers I have known. Lunching\r\nwith us, he said he never ate much before concerts; but when Eloisa’s\r\nspecial crab casserole came on he helped himself twice and sighed,\r\n“That’s the best crab I ever ate.” Watching him eat, I was afraid\r\nthat his voice would suddenly go back on him. When I brought him to\r\nmy home from his hotel my Buick had had a puncture--and singers are\r\nhighly sensitized. It didn’t seem to faze him. Then we were off for the\r\nconcert hall--and the Buick had another puncture. I think about that\r\ntime he was telling me that the Firestone Tire people were paying him\r\n$3,000 a broadcast. Apropos of punctures, perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe seraph sang; Handel, Haydn, Stradella, Moszkowski--I remember the\r\ncomposers, for I still keep that program. While Suva sat spellbound\r\nhe topped the performance with Lehar’s “Yours Is My Heart Alone,” and\r\nthe impresario was too emotionally touched to count the profits, which\r\nturned out to be something over £100. Many have been generous to our\r\nSchool, but his generosity came in the form of beauty, which made it\r\ndoubly precious. He sang for me again in 1939, on his way to Sydney.\r\nWhen he repeated “Yours Is My Heart Alone” I was glad that my eyes were\r\nhidden behind tinted spectacles. That was my swan song in Fiji; I was\r\ngoing away in a few weeks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA misunderstanding prevented my visiting Tahiti, which would have\r\nfascinated me as a study of what not to do with a native people. The\r\nFrench are notoriously poor health administrators, and Tahiti has long\r\nbeen a model example of disease breeding among a dwindling population.\r\nI know nothing about it at first hand, but from what I have been told\r\nthere is little hope for the remaining Polynesians there.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this sounds pessimistic. The public health worker has often\r\nbeen called the Cinderella of the medical profession; he must get used\r\nto adversity, and his story too often ends before Prince Charming\r\ncomes along. I have no complaint to make on that score. The work has\r\nnever been drudgery, and the long waits for results have been rewarded\r\naccording to my personal merits--and demerits. In medicine there is no\r\nsuch thing as the Perfect Result. We leave that to the Pelmanites.\r\n\r\nI am no Cinderella, but I am worried because my readers may think of me\r\nas a sort of medical Cassandra, moaning doom for the Pacific peoples.\r\nIf that is your impression, I feel that I must say a word to change\r\nyour minds before I leave you.\r\n\r\nToo many cocksure lecturers and writers have made a free-handed\r\nflourish from Borneo to Tahiti and proclaimed, “The people are dying\r\noff.” And they have referred to the main killers--alcohol; imported\r\ndisease; food and clothing; the wreckage of their ancient habits with\r\nno wholesome and attractive substitutes to take their place.\r\n\r\nAll too true of the past, and mildly true of the present. I have told\r\nyou how I watched the New Hebrides decline under a vicious form of\r\ncolonial government, and how Rennell Island was blighted for lack of\r\nprotection; and how the natives of the world’s second largest island,\r\nNew Guinea, must inevitably fall off in numbers and weaken in physique\r\nunless their case is handled with more honesty and intelligence than\r\nthe home Government has seen fit to give it.\r\n\r\nAll this is on the dark side of the canvas. Let’s look at the brighter\r\npicture. I quote myself, from an article in the _Pacific Island\r\nMonthly_:--“The problem of depopulation of natives in the Pacific need\r\nno longer exist. The formula for turning declining into increasing\r\npopulations has been devised and put into operation by British\r\nAdministrations in Central Polynesia, in Polynesian New Zealand, in\r\nBritish Micronesia (the Gilberts), and in Melanesian Fiji. American\r\nSamoans are increasing under the operation of the same general formula.”\r\n\r\nTHE FORMULA: Native doctors and nurses to care for current illnesses\r\nand educate their people in the prevention of disease, especially\r\nin soil sanitation and pure water supplies; attention to infant and\r\nchild welfare; reliable census-taking to check results--all under the\r\nsupervision of competent European physicians and nurses. Add to this a\r\ncareful study of native customs on the part of civil administrations,\r\nso that they may learn respect for the more wholesome of the folk ways\r\nthat have given life’s zest to the people.\r\n\r\nWhere this formula has been applied native populations have increased,\r\nand are continuing to increase. It has only failed where it has been\r\npigeonholed by incompetents.\r\n\r\nThe work down there is unfinished, and may remain so until the horn of\r\nJudgment awakes some of the living dead. I have been only a very minor\r\nspoke in the Rockefeller Foundation’s great wheel of health, which\r\nmoves with the Earth’s axis. I should like to see the task completed\r\nover that 6,000,000 square miles of island-sprinkled sea where I made\r\nthe doctor’s rounds; but I know that Methuselah couldn’t live long\r\nenough to supervise that task. I only know that wherever we worked\r\nwith progressive governments the vital statistics began to swing\r\nupward, however slowly and whatever the temporary setbacks. I have\r\nspoken little of the Maoris of New Zealand, for my only work there was\r\nconcerned in making surveys. But as an example of the above formula,\r\nwell carried out, let me say that the Maoris of New Zealand have\r\nalmost doubled their numbers in twenty years. The Cook Islands have\r\ndone fully as well. And there’s Western Samoa, which has outlived the\r\nfilthy horrors of the Mau Rebellion, and has come back. The Fijians,\r\ntoo, have risen from the epidemic of 1918, which threatened their\r\nextinction. In the black islands of the Solomons nobody knows whether\r\nthe birth rate is keeping pace with the mortality. We have treated\r\nthese people on a grand scale and results are being shown in the\r\ngenerally improved condition of plantation labor; tuberculosis is still\r\nthe reigning terror, and that’s a difficult enemy to cope with. In the\r\nGilbert Islands the brown Micronesians are most certainly reviving; our\r\nN.M.P.’s have been working there for years.\r\n\r\nNineteen years ago, when I voyaged hurriedly through the Solomons\r\non the way to my destiny in Fiji, I was already experienced enough\r\nto draw my fixed conclusion: Depopulation follows the visitor. The\r\nimmortal Captain Cook guessed this over a hundred and fifty years ago.\r\nA century ago keen observers like George Turner marked the locust swarm\r\nof imported diseases, eating their way along the islands. But later,\r\ninvestigators broached a comfortable theory that the natives had begun\r\nto die off before the white man came. Nonsense. White men, in the\r\nmalign form of looters and slavers, Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese, were\r\nthere two hundred and fifty years before Cook came.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the Solomon Islands they served as a type example.\r\nIn the northwest islands near New Guinea, where shipping, trading,\r\nrecruiting and missionizing were plentiful, the disease rate was high.\r\nAs we traveled to the southeast into areas less accessible to visitors\r\nthe so-called “native diseases” steadily diminished. Twelve years\r\nlater showed me the change: The Southeast was sick from tuberculosis,\r\ndysentery, pneumonia and venereal, which strangers had carried there\r\nand spread among non-immune natives. I have mentioned the incidence of\r\nthese seemingly unaccountable plagues, burning like fire in dry grass.\r\nThe old-time voyagers, who did their share to spread infection, have\r\nnoted the evil effects. These things are still going on in the remote\r\ncorners of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe recruiting of contract labor was once a curse, but more enlightened\r\ngovernment has turned it into something of a blessing; wise labor\r\nlaws have made it so that a worker usually leaves the plantation with\r\nhis health better than when he came. The New Hebrides, where French\r\nplanters serve drink, drugs and firearms to their native helpers, is an\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nThere is a school of thought which points to the “decay of custom”\r\nas depopulation’s main cause. The native has ceased to take interest\r\nin a warrior’s physical well-being. The missions have discouraged\r\nthose picturesque ancient ceremonials which were the background of\r\ntribal life. The Rivers Theory argues that boredom creates a psychic\r\ndepression which actually decreases reproductive power; that it also\r\nencourages abortion and infanticide amidst the cry, “Why grow slaves\r\nfor another race?” Undoubtedly this theory works out in some regions I\r\nhave seen, where Christianity has been an ineffective substitute for\r\nthe war club and the tribal dance. The warrior grows flabby. His wife,\r\na squaw, slaves on.\r\n\r\nBut the main cause of depopulation in the Pacific, let me repeat, _is\r\nthe introduction of diseases to which the natives have no immunity_.\r\nEven in the heart of Papua, where the Fathers of the Sacred Heart\r\nperformed practical miracles among ferocious mountain cannibals a\r\nhundred miles from the coastline, working a non-malarious soil that\r\nproduced bountiful nourishment, I heard the death-knell. I can’t forget\r\nhow I heard Father Fastre’s bemused voice speaking under the moon:\r\n“Doctor, when I first came here I could stand at my doorway and see ten\r\nthousand people.” Where had they gone? The nearest village was four\r\nhours away, and from where he gazed the good priest saw only moonlit\r\nghosts.\r\n\r\nCannibalism and head-hunting were rough blessings, because they\r\nquarantined tribe against tribe. Cannibalism is a shocking habit, as\r\nHerman Melville, if I remember correctly, pointed out, adding, “I ask\r\nwhether the mere eating of human flesh so far exceeds in barbarity\r\nthat custom [hanging, drawing and quartering, perhaps] which only\r\na few years since was practiced in enlightened England?” I am not\r\npro-cannibal, but medically speaking I can see how well it worked to\r\nkeep the other fellow in his place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd what of it? asks Mr. Homebody as he walks toward the old parking\r\nlot off Main Street. How in the world will it affect me or the boys\r\naround American Legion Hall if those sun-kissed yahoos on the Isle\r\nof Gumbo do happen to curl up and die? Head-hunters are all right in\r\nside-shows, but they don’t affect business on Main Street.\r\n\r\nMain Street is the very point, Mr. Homebody. I once told you how\r\nfar-off contagions might someday travel to your front door and disturb\r\nyour parochial calm. But here’s another side of it--something which\r\nmight upset your business, because you’re a partner in world business,\r\nwhether you know it or not.\r\n\r\nThe European seized the Pacific, and that’s an old story. In spite of\r\nthe horrible example of bombing and burning which European civilization\r\nis showing today to the uncivilized, the settled holdings of various\r\nnational governments over a quarter of the globe’s surface, the\r\nPacific, must remain _in statu quo_. Unless it does, you will hear\r\nsomething you will not like, Mr. Homebody. The _status quo_ over that\r\nvast empire is all-important, and it cannot be maintained unless the\r\nwhite man takes up his burden and carries it through.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because tropical products have become world business. The lands\r\ndown there, including immense Australia, vast New Guinea and big\r\nNew Zealand, make up a territory comparable in size to our Western\r\nHemisphere. The failure of mines, plantations and fisheries on one\r\nside of our quarrelsome Earth cannot fail to react banefully on the\r\nother side. Copra, hemp, cotton, sugar, gold, spices, fruits, pearls,\r\ninnumerable varieties of oils and drugs which have been discovered,\r\nor will be, are only items among the tropical products which have\r\nentered the international market. They are burdening ships in enormous\r\nquantities, and the tonnage will grow greater, unless....\r\n\r\nIf native labor fails, Oceania’s production will fail. Healthy,\r\ncontented native labor is indispensable to the producer. The\r\nimportation of Asiatics will not answer the question. Regard the Fiji\r\nGovernment’s experiment with East Indians, who are today outbreeding\r\nthe Fijian, and have brought him no benefits. Observe Japan’s\r\ntaking-over of the Marshall Islands, and the subsequent infiltration\r\nof yellow men all over the Pacific. These strangers came because\r\nthe native was too sick to work the land. The oriental’s peaceful\r\npenetration is already doing mischief down there; he brought with him\r\na set of political and social ideas which inevitably hook up with his\r\nhomeland prejudices, and extend into every intrigue of _Weltpolitik_.\r\nHe has nothing in common with the simple islander whom he is pushing\r\naside.\r\n\r\nWhat will come of it all? Supply and demand are cruel partners. The\r\nplanter must work his plantation, the shipper fill his ships; and if\r\nthere is not enough healthy native labor to do the work, then send away\r\nto Shanghai or Bombay for what you can get. These fellows may not last\r\nlong, either, but they will stay long enough to disturb the economic\r\nbalance. South Sea industry will grow anemic, an easy prey to whatever\r\nAxis happens to be grinding blood out of the human race.\r\n\r\nThat, Mr. Homebody, will mean another war; and even if you are a year\r\nor two too old for military service, your Main Street will rumble\r\nwith the jar of an economic balance overthrown. Before that breaks\r\nright in front of your office building, maybe you will agree with the\r\nRockefeller Foundation’s theory of economics. Keep the native alive,\r\nrestore his health, give him enough European knowledge to fend him\r\nagainst the evils of Europe, then he will go happily ahead cultivating\r\nthe soil for the world and himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps in these pages I have dwelt too much on the savagery of certain\r\nbackward tribes. Have I said enough about the self-sufficing social\r\npattern which these so-called barbarians had built around themselves\r\nbefore the pale invader came to fuddle them? Have I said enough of\r\nthe ideal family life and wise social laws that prevailed over old\r\nPolynesia? It needed no British or American schoolmaster to teach them\r\nthe kindness and neighborly generosity that are the aim of higher\r\ncivilization. They had these things, which are at the heart of social\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nDefinitely, I am not a Cassandra. The islander, I feel, will survive to\r\nachieve great things in a brave new world. Already he has contributed\r\nto science and statecraft, and in some cases has dominated in a\r\nbusiness world which yesterday was a closed book to him. He will\r\nmake his way in the arts, literature, music, painting. He had been\r\nmisled and fooled for generations, but his intellect is overcoming an\r\ninferiority complex which the pale overlord once foisted on him. Island\r\ngovernments have become humane and understanding, more missionaries\r\nare letting fanaticism yield to common sense. Utopia is always a long\r\nway off, but I’ll risk a prophecy. Guide the native with sympathetic\r\nintelligence, and the time will come when he will cease to be our\r\npupil. He will become our teacher. Not in the science of war, God\r\ndeliver us, but in the more difficult art of living together in harmony\r\nand peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo the Lamberts have bought a house in California. Eloisa tells me that\r\nshe will soon have the best rose garden in Walnut Creek. We are a bit\r\ntoo far inland to see the Pacific; but I can feel it, over in the west.\r\nFiji doesn’t seem so far away.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abel, Victor, editor _Pacific Age_, 139, 140\r\n\r\n  Admiralty Group, 86\r\n\r\n  Ahuia, 20, 22, 33-36, 38, 44, 52, 56, 72\r\n\r\n  Aitutaki, 257, 263, 265\r\n\r\n  Antunez, Col., 8\r\n\r\n  Aseida, Toschio, 316, 344\r\n\r\n  Ashford, Col.

There is no yaws in\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\n[2] Pronounced “Mokongai,” and would be so spelled, except for the\r\ntypographical feat described on pages 129-130. In most Fijian words\r\nI have used the correct Fijian spelling instead of the fantastic\r\nanglicized form.\r\n\r\n[3] Some months later I did penance for that moment’s slip in courage.\r\nA learned man who had studied tropical medicine in London announced\r\nthat the human hookworm could infect the pig and be carried by him.\r\nThis was a serious claim, likely to upset all calculations; especially\r\nsince he declared that he had proved his theory on a South Pacific\r\nisland. I wanted to find out for myself, so I went to a friend whose\r\nwife had a pet pig that she had raised on a concrete floor to avoid\r\nthat curse of Fiji’s swine growers, intestinal parasites. I examined\r\nthe pig, found it negative, then hog-tied it and laid it, several\r\ntimes, on a bed heavily infested with human hookworm larvae. It got a\r\nsevere “ground itch,” first symptom of infection. In due time I did\r\na postmortem on the animal and found many abscesses in the liver and\r\nkidneys, but no worms in the intestines--fair evidence that human\r\nhookworms do not infect pigs.\r\n\r\nThen I did the experiment in reverse: got a pig that was extremely\r\nheavy with pig hookworm and tied a poultice of the hatching material\r\non my arm. Result: “ground itch,” but no infection. Showing, at least,\r\nthat pig hookworm couldn’t thrive in a tough bird like me. I cut open\r\nthis tender young pig, and a good look at its wormy insides sickened\r\nme. As a martyr to science I only suffered through my pocket. The lady\r\nhad been saving the animal for Christmas dinner, and she charged me\r\nfive pounds for it.\r\n\r\n[4] The word is pronounced _ndraunikau_, the Fijian _n_ being sounded\r\nbefore the _d_, as usual. For convenience I spell it _draunikau_.\r\n\r\n[5] _The History of Melanesian Society_, by W. H. R. Rivers, describes\r\nthe fantastic genealogical tabus on marriages inside the family line.\r\n\r\n[6] Rotumah is one of the steppingstones of the ancient Polynesian\r\nInvasion, over 1,000 miles from Rennell.
