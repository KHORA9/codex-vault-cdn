GOULD, A.M., M.D. and WALTER L. PYLE, A.M., M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY AND INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSince the time when man's mind first busied itself with subjects beyond\r\nhis own self-preservation and the satisfaction of his bodily appetites,\r\nthe anomalous and curious have been of exceptional and persistent\r\nfascination to him; and especially is this true of the construction and\r\nfunctions of the human body.  Possibly, indeed, it was the anomalous\r\nthat was largely instrumental in arousing in the savage the attention,\r\nthought, and investigation that were finally to develop into the body\r\nof organized truth which we now call Science. As by the aid of\r\ncollected experience and careful inference we to-day endeavor to pass\r\nour vision into the dim twilight whence has emerged our civilization,\r\nwe find abundant hint and even evidence of this truth. To the highest\r\ntype of philosophic minds it is the usual and the ordinary that demand\r\ninvestigation and explanation. But even to such, no less than to the\r\nmost naive-minded, the strange and exceptional is of absorbing\r\ninterest, and it is often through the extraordinary that the\r\nphilosopher gets the most searching glimpses into the heart of the\r\nmystery of the ordinary. Truly it has been said, facts are stranger\r\nthan fiction. In monstrosities and dermoid cysts, for example, we seem\r\nto catch forbidden sight of the secret work-room of Nature, and drag\r\nout into the light the evidences of her clumsiness, and proofs of her\r\nlapses of skill,--evidences and proofs, moreover, that tell us much of\r\nthe methods and means used by the vital artisan of Life,--the loom, and\r\neven the silent weaver at work upon the mysterious garment of\r\ncorporeality.\r\n\r\n\"La premiere chose qui s'offre a l' Homme quand il se regarde, c'est\r\nson corps,\" says Pascal, and looking at the matter more closely we find\r\nthat it was the strange and mysterious things of his body that occupied\r\nman's earliest as well as much of his later attention. In the\r\nbeginning, the organs and functions of generation, the mysteries of\r\nsex, not the routine of digestion or of locomotion, stimulated his\r\ncuriosity, and in them he recognized, as it were, an unseen hand\r\nreaching down into the world of matter and the workings of bodily\r\norganization, and reining them to impersonal service and far-off ends.\r\nAll ethnologists and students of primitive religion well know the role\r\nthat has been played in primitive society by the genetic instincts.\r\nAmong the older naturalists, such as Pliny and Aristotle, and even in\r\nthe older historians, whose scope included natural as well as civil and\r\npolitical history, the atypic and bizarre, and especially the\r\naberrations of form or function of the generative organs, caught the\r\neye most quickly. Judging from the records of early writers, when\r\nMedicine began to struggle toward self-consciousness, it was again the\r\nsame order of facts that was singled out by the attention. The very\r\nnames applied by the early anatomists to many structures so widely\r\nseparated from the organs of generation as were those of the brain,\r\ngive testimony of the state of mind that led to and dominated the\r\npractice of dissection.\r\n\r\nIn the literature of the past centuries the predominance of the\r\ninterest in the curious is exemplified in the almost ludicrously\r\nmonotonous iteration of titles, in which the conspicuous words are\r\ncuriosa, rara, monstruosa, memorabilia, prodigiosa, selecta, exotica,\r\nmiraculi, lusibus naturae, occultis naturae, etc., etc.  Even when\r\nmedical science became more strict, it was largely the curious and rare\r\nthat were thought worthy of chronicling, and not the establishment or\r\nillustration of the common, or of general principles. With all his\r\nsovereign sound sense, Ambrose Pare has loaded his book with references\r\nto impossibly strange, and even mythologic cases.\r\n\r\nIn our day the taste seems to be insatiable, and hardly any medical\r\njournal is without its rare or \"unique\" case, or one noteworthy chiefly\r\nby reason of its anomalous features. A curious case is invariably\r\nreported, and the insertion of such a report is generally productive of\r\ncorrespondence and discussion with the object of finding a parallel for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn view of all this it seems itself a curious fact that there has never\r\nbeen any systematic gathering of medical curiosities. It would have\r\nbeen most natural that numerous encyclopedias should spring into\r\nexistence in response to such a persistently dominant interest. The\r\nforelying volume appears to be the first thorough attempt to classify\r\nand epitomize the literature of this nature.  It has been our purpose\r\nto briefly summarize and to arrange in order the records of the most\r\ncurious, bizarre, and abnormal cases that are found in medical\r\nliterature of all ages and all languages--a thaumatographia medica. It\r\nwill be readily seen that such a collection must have a function far\r\nbeyond the satisfaction of mere curiosity, even if that be stigmatized\r\nwith the word \"idle.\" If, as we believe, reference may here be found to\r\nall such cases in the literature of Medicine (including Anatomy,\r\nPhysiology, Surgery, Obstetrics, etc.) as show the most extreme and\r\nexceptional departures from the ordinary, it follows that the future\r\nclinician and investigator must have use for a handbook that decides\r\nwhether his own strange case has already been paralleled or excelled.\r\nHe will thus be aided in determining the truth of his statements and\r\nthe accuracy of his diagnoses.  Moreover, to know extremes gives\r\ndirectly some knowledge of means, and by implication and inference it\r\nfrequently does more.  Remarkable injuries illustrate to what extent\r\ntissues and organs may be damaged without resultant death, and thus the\r\nsurgeon is encouraged to proceed to his operation with greater\r\nconfidence and more definite knowledge as to the issue. If a mad cow\r\nmay blindly play the part of a successful obstetrician with her horns,\r\ncertainly a skilled surgeon may hazard entering the womb with his\r\nknife. If large portions of an organ,--the lung, a kidney, parts of the\r\nliver, or the brain itself,--may be lost by accident, and the patient\r\nstill live, the physician is taught the lesson of nil desperandum, and\r\nthat if possible to arrest disease of these organs before their total\r\ndestruction, the prognosis and treatment thereby acquire new and more\r\nhopeful phases.\r\n\r\nDirectly or indirectly many similar examples have also clear\r\nmedicolegal bearings or suggestions; in fact, it must be acknowledged\r\nthat much of the importance of medical jurisprudence lies in a thorough\r\ncomprehension of the anomalous and rare cases in Medicine. Expert\r\nmedical testimony has its chief value in showing the possibilities of\r\nthe occurrence of alleged extreme cases, and extraordinary deviations\r\nfrom the natural. Every expert witness should be able to maintain his\r\nargument by a full citation of parallels to any remarkable theory or\r\nhypothesis advanced by his clients; and it is only by an exhaustive\r\nknowledge of extremes and anomalies that an authority on medical\r\njurisprudence can hope to substantiate his testimony beyond question.\r\nIn every poisoning case he is closely questioned as to the largest dose\r\nof the drug in question that has been taken with impunity, and the\r\nsmallest dose that has killed, and he is expected to have the cases of\r\nreported idiosyncrasies and tolerance at his immediate command. A widow\r\nwith a child of ten months' gestation may be saved the loss of\r\nreputation by mention of the authentic cases in which pregnancy has\r\nexceeded nine months' duration; the proof of the viability of a seven\r\nmonths' child may alter the disposition of an estate; the proof of\r\ndeath by a blow on the epigastrium without external marks of violence\r\nmay convict a murderer; and so it is with many other cases of a\r\nmedicolegal nature.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that in old-time medical literature--sadly and\r\nunjustly neglected in our rage for the new--should so often be found\r\nparallels of our most wonderful and peculiar modern cases.  We wish,\r\nalso, to enter a mild protest against the modern egotism that would set\r\naside with a sneer as myth and fancy the testimonies and reports of\r\nphilosophers and physicians, only because they lived hundreds of years\r\nago. We are keenly appreciative of the power exercised by the\r\nmyth-making faculty in the past, but as applied to early physicians, we\r\nsuggest that the suspicion may easily be too active. When Pare, for\r\nexample, pictures a monster, we may distrust his art, his artist, or\r\nhis engraver, and make all due allowance for his primitive knowledge of\r\nteratology, coupled with the exaggerations and inventions of the\r\nwonder-lover; but when he describes in his own writing what he or his\r\nconfreres have seen on the battle-field or in the dissecting room, we\r\nthink, within moderate limits, we owe him credence. For the rest, we\r\ndoubt not that the modern reporter is, to be mild, quite as much of a\r\nmyth-maker as his elder brother, especially if we find modern instances\r\nthat are essentially like the older cases reported in reputable\r\njournals or books, and by men presumably honest. In our collection we\r\nhave endeavored, so far as possible, to cite similar cases from the\r\nolder and from the more recent literature.\r\n\r\nThis connection suggests the question of credibility in general.  It\r\nneed hardly be said that the lay-journalist and newspaper reporter have\r\nusually been ignored by us, simply because experience and investigation\r\nhave many times proved that a scientific fact, by presentation in most\r\nlay-journals, becomes in some mysterious manner, ipso facto, a\r\nscientific caricature (or worse!), and if it is so with facts, what\r\nmust be the effect upon reports based upon no fact whatsoever? It is\r\nmanifestly impossible for us to guarantee the credibility of chronicles\r\ngiven. If we have been reasonably certain of unreliability, we may not\r\neven have mentioned the marvelous statement. Obviously, we could do no\r\nmore with apparently credible cases, reported by reputable medical men,\r\nthan to cite author and source and leave the matter there, where our\r\nresponsibility must end.\r\n\r\nBut where our proper responsibility seemed likely never to end was in\r\ncarrying out the enormous labor requisite for a reasonable certainty\r\nthat we had omitted no searching that might lead to undiscovered facts,\r\nancient or modern. Choice in selection is always, of course, an affair\r\nde gustibus, and especially when, like the present, there is\r\nconsiderable embarrassment of riches, coupled with the purpose of\r\ncompressing our results in one handy volume. In brief, it may be said\r\nthat several years of exhaustive research have been spent by us in the\r\ngreat medical libraries of the United States and Europe in collecting\r\nthe material herewith presented. If, despite of this, omissions and\r\nerrors are to be found, we shall be grateful to have them pointed out.\r\nIt must be remembered that limits of space have forbidden satisfactory\r\ndiscussion of the cases, and the prime object of the whole work has\r\nbeen to carefully collect and group the anomalies and curiosities, and\r\nallow the reader to form his own conclusions and make his own\r\ndeductions.\r\n\r\nAs the entire labor in the preparation of the forelying volume, from\r\nthe inception of the idea to the completion of the index, has been\r\nexclusively the personal work of the authors, it is with full\r\nconfidence of the authenticity of the reports quoted that the material\r\nis presented.\r\n\r\nComplete references are given to those facts that are comparatively\r\nunknown or unique, or that are worthy of particular interest or further\r\ninvestigation. To prevent unnecessary loading of the book with\r\nfoot-notes, in those instances in which there are a number of cases of\r\nthe same nature, and a description has not been thought necessary, mere\r\ncitation being sufficient, references are but briefly given or omitted\r\naltogether. For the same reason a bibliographic index has been added at\r\nthe end of the text. This contains the most important sources of\r\ninformation used, and each journal or book therein has its own number,\r\nwhich is used in its stead all through the book (thus, 476 signifies\r\nThe Lancet, London; 597, the New York Medical Journal; etc.).  These\r\nbibliographic numbers begin at 100.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that every effort has been made to conveniently and\r\nsatisfactorily group the thousands of cases contained in the book (a\r\nlabor of no small proportions in itself), a complete general index is a\r\npractical necessity for the full success of what is essentially a\r\nreference-volume, and consequently one has been added, in which may be\r\nfound not only the subjects under consideration and numerous\r\ncross-references, but also the names of the authors of the most\r\nimportant reports. A table of contents follows this preface.\r\n\r\nWe assume the responsibility for innovations in orthography, certain\r\nabbreviations, and the occasional substitution of figures for large\r\nnumerals, fractions, and decimals, made necessary by limited space, and\r\nin some cases to more lucidly show tables and statistics. From the\r\nvariety of the reports, uniformity of nomenclature and numeration is\r\nalmost impossible.\r\n\r\nAs we contemplate constantly increasing our data, we shall be glad to\r\nreceive information of any unpublished anomalous or curious cases,\r\neither of the past or in the future.\r\n\r\nFor many courtesies most generously extended in aiding our\r\nresearch-work we wish, among others, to acknowledge our especial\r\ngratitude and indebtedness to the officers and assistants of the\r\nSurgeon-General's Library at Washington, D.C., the Library of the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons of London, the Library of the British Museum, the\r\nLibrary of the British Medical Association, the Bibliotheque de Faculte\r\nde Medecine de Paris, the Bibliotheque Nationale, and the Library of\r\nthe College of Physicians of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                                  GEORGE M.

In olden times there were\r\nmany opinions concerning its causation, all of which, until the era of\r\nphysiologic investigation, were of superstitious derivation. Believing\r\nmenstruation to be the natural means of exit of the feminine bodily\r\nimpurities, the ancients always thought a menstruating woman was to be\r\nshunned; her very presence was deleterious to the whole animal economy,\r\nas, for instance, among the older writers we find that Pliny remarks:\r\n\"On the approach of a woman in this state, must will become sour, seeds\r\nwhich are touched by her become sterile, grass withers away, garden\r\nplants are parched up, and the fruit will fall from the tree beneath\r\nwhich she sits.\" He also says that the menstruating women in Cappadocia\r\nwere perambulated about the fields to preserve the vegetation from\r\nworms and caterpillars. According to Flemming, menstrual blood was\r\nbelieved to be so powerful that the mere touch of a menstruating woman\r\nwould render vines and all kinds of fruit-trees sterile. Among the\r\nindigenous Australians, menstrual superstition was so intense that one\r\nof the native blacks, who discovered his wife lying on his blanket\r\nduring her menstrual period, killed her, and died of terror himself in\r\na fortnight. Hence, Australian women during this season are forbidden\r\nto touch anything that men use. Aristotle said that the very look of a\r\nmenstruating woman would take the polish out of a mirror, and the next\r\nperson looking in it would be bewitched.  Frommann mentions a man who\r\nsaid he saw a tree in Goa which withered because a catamenial napkin\r\nwas hung on it. Bourke remarks that the dread felt by the American\r\nIndians in this respect corresponds with the particulars recited by\r\nPliny. Squaws at the time of menstrual purgation are obliged to seclude\r\nthemselves, and in most instances to occupy isolated lodges, and in all\r\ntribes are forbidden to prepare food for anyone save themselves. It was\r\nbelieved that, were a menstruating woman to step astride a rifle, a\r\nbow, or a lance, the weapon would have no utility. Medicine men are in\r\nthe habit of making a \"protective\" clause whenever they concoct a\r\n\"medicine,\" which is to the effect that the \"medicine\" will be\r\neffective provided that no woman in this condition is allowed to\r\napproach the tent of the official in charge.\r\n\r\nEmpiricism had doubtless taught the ancient husbands the dangers of\r\nsexual intercourse during this period, and the after-results of many\r\nsuch connections were looked upon as manifestations of the\r\ncontagiousness of the evil excretions issuing at this period.  Hence at\r\none time menstruation was held in much awe and abhorrence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in some of the eastern countries menstruation was\r\nregarded as sacred, and the first menstrual discharge was considered so\r\nvaluable that premenstrual marriages were inaugurated in order that the\r\nfirst ovum might not be wasted, but fertilized, because it was supposed\r\nto be the purest and best for the purpose. Such customs are extant at\r\nthe present day in some parts of India, despite the efforts of the\r\nBritish Government to suppress them, and descriptions of\r\nchild-marriages and their evil results have often been given by\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nAs the advances of physiology enlightened the mind as to the true\r\nnature of the menstrual period, and the age of superstition gradually\r\ndisappeared, the intense interest in menstruation vanished, and now,\r\nrather than being held in fear and awe, the physicians of to-day\r\nconstantly see the results of copulation during this period. The\r\nuncontrollable desire of the husband and the mercenary aims of the\r\nprostitute furnish examples of modern disregard.\r\n\r\nThe anomalies of menstruation must naturally have attracted much\r\nattention, and we find medical literature of all times replete with\r\nexamples. While some are simply examples of vicarious or compensatory\r\nmenstruation, and were so explained even by the older writers, there\r\nare many that are physiologic curiosities of considerable interest.\r\nLheritier furnishes the oft-quoted history of the case of a young girl\r\nwho suffered from suppression of menses, which, instead of flowing\r\nthrough the natural channels, issued periodically from vesicles on the\r\nleg for a period of six months, when the seat of the discharge changed\r\nto an eruption on the left arm, and continued in this location for one\r\nyear; then the discharge shifted to a sore on the thumb, and at the end\r\nof another six months again changed, the next location being on the\r\nupper eyelid; here it continued for a period of two years.  Brierre de\r\nBoismont and Meisner describe a case apparently identical with the\r\nforegoing, though not quoting the source.\r\n\r\nHaller, in a collection of physiologic curiosities covering a period of\r\na century and a half, cites 18 instances of menstruation from the skin.\r\nParrot has also mentioned several cases of this nature. Chambers speaks\r\nof bloody sweat occurring periodically in a woman of twenty-seven; the\r\nintervals, however, were occasionally but a week or a fortnight, and\r\nthe exudation was not confined to any one locality. Van Swieten quotes\r\nthe history of a case of suppression of the menstrual function in which\r\nthere were convulsive contractions of the body, followed by paralysis\r\nof the right arm. Later on, the patient received a blow on the left eye\r\ncausing amaurosis; swelling of this organ followed, and one month later\r\nblood issued from it, and subsequently blood oozed from the skin of the\r\nnose, and ran in jets from the skin of the fingers and from the nails.\r\n\r\nD'Andrade cites an account of a healthy Parsee lady, eighteen years of\r\nage, who menstruated regularly from thirteen to fifteen and a half\r\nyears; the catamenia then became irregular and she suffered occasional\r\nhemorrhages from the gums and nose, together with attacks of\r\nhematemesis. The menstruation returned, but she never became pregnant,\r\nand, later, blood issued from the healthy skin of the left breast and\r\nright forearm, recurring every month or two, and finally additional\r\ndermal hemorrhage developed on the forehead. Microscopic examination of\r\nthe exuded blood showed usual constituents present. There are two\r\nsomewhat similar cases spoken of in French literature. The first was\r\nthat of a young lady, who, after ten years' suppression of the\r\nmenstrual discharge, exhibited the flow from a vesicular eruption on\r\nthe finger. The other case was quite peculiar, the woman being a\r\nprostitute, who menstruated from time to time through spots, the size\r\nof a five-franc piece, developing on the breasts, buttocks, back,\r\naxilla, and epigastrium. Barham records a case similar to the\r\nforegoing, in which the menstruation assumed the character of periodic\r\npurpura. Duchesne mentions an instance of complete amenorrhea, in which\r\nthe ordinary flow was replaced by periodic sweats.\r\n\r\nParrot speaks of a woman who, when seven months old, suffered from\r\nstrumous ulcers, which left cicatrices on the right hand, from whence,\r\nat the age of six years, issued a sanguineous discharge with associate\r\nconvulsions. One day, while in violent grief, she shed bloody tears.\r\nShe menstruated at the age of eleven, and was temporarily improved in\r\nher condition; but after any strong emotion the hemorrhages returned.\r\nThe subsidence of the bleeding followed her first pregnancy, but\r\nsubsequently on one occasion, when the menses were a few days in\r\narrears, she exhibited a blood-like exudation from the forehead,\r\neyelids, and scalp. As in the case under D'Andrade's observation, the\r\nexudation was found by microscopic examination to consist of the true\r\nconstituents of blood. An additional element of complication in this\r\ncase was the occurrence of occasional attacks of hematemesis.\r\n\r\nMenstruation from the Breasts.--Being in close sympathy with the\r\ngenerative function, we would naturally expect to find the female\r\nmammae involved in cases of anomalous menstruation, and the truth of\r\nthis supposition is substantiated in the abundance of such cases on\r\nrecord. Schenck reports instances of menstruation from the nipple; and\r\nRichter, de Fontechia, Laurentius, Marcellus Donatus, Amatus Lusitanus,\r\nand Bierling are some of the older writers who have observed this\r\nanomaly. Pare says the wife of Pierre de Feure, an iron merchant,\r\nliving at Chasteaudun, menstruated such quantities from the breasts\r\neach month that several serviettes were necessary to receive the\r\ndischarge.  Cazenave details the history of a case in which the mammary\r\nmenstruation was associated with a similar exudation from the face, and\r\nWolff saw an example associated with hemorrhage from the fauces. In the\r\nLancet (1840-1841) is an instance of monthly discharge from beneath the\r\nleft mamma. Finley also writes of an example of mammary hemorrhage\r\nsimulating menstruation. Barnes saw a case in St. George's Hospital,\r\nLondon, 1876, in which the young girl menstruated vicariously from the\r\nnipple and stomach. In a London discussion there was mentioned the case\r\nof a healthy woman of fifty who never was pregnant, and whose\r\nmenstruation had ceased two years previously, but who for twelve months\r\nhad menstruated regularly from the nipples, the hemorrhage being so\r\nprofuse as to require constant change of napkins. The mammae were large\r\nand painful, and the accompanying symptoms were those of ordinary\r\nmenstruation. Boulger mentions an instance of periodic menstrual\r\ndischarge from beneath the left mamma. Jacobson speaks of habitual\r\nmenstruation by both breasts. Rouxeau describes amenorrhea in a girl of\r\nseventeen, who menstruated from the breast; and Teufard reports a case\r\nin which there was reestablishment of menstruation by the mammae at the\r\nage of fifty-six. Baker details in full the description of a case of\r\nvicarious menstruation from an ulcer on the right mamma of a woman of\r\ntwenty. At the time he was called to see her she was suffering with\r\nwhat was called \"green-sickness.\" The girl had never menstruated\r\nregularly or freely. The right mamma was quite well developed, flaccid,\r\nthe nipple prominent, and the superficial veins larger and more\r\ntortuous than usual. The patient stated that the right mamma had always\r\nbeen larger than the left. The areola was large and well marked, and\r\n1/4 inch from its outer edge, immediately under the nipple, there was\r\nan ulcer with slightly elevated edges measuring about 1 1/4 inches\r\nacross the base, and having an opening in its center 1/4 inch in\r\ndiameter, covered with a thin scab. By removing the scab and making\r\npressure at the base of the ulcer, drops of thick, mucopurulent matter\r\nwere made to exude. This discharge, however, was not offensive to the\r\nsmell. On March 17, 1846, the breast became much enlarged and\r\ncongested, as portrayed in Plate 1. The ulcer was much inflamed and\r\npainful, the veins corded and deep colored, and there was a free\r\ndischarge of sanguineous yellowish matter. When the girl's general\r\nhealth improved and menstruation became more natural, the vicarious\r\ndischarge diminished in proportion, and the ulcer healed shortly\r\nafterward. Every month this breast had enlarged, the ulcer became\r\ninflamed and discharged vicariously, continuing in this manner for a\r\nfew days, with all the accompanying menstrual symptoms, and then dried\r\nup gradually. It was stated that the ulcer was the result of the girl's\r\nstooping over some bushes to take an egg from a hen's nest, when the\r\npoint of a palmetto stuck in her breast and broke off. The ulcer\r\nsubsequently formed, and ultimately discharged a piece of palmetto.\r\nThis happened just at the time of the beginning of the menstrual epoch.\r\nThe accompanying figures, Plate 1, show the breast in the ordinary\r\nstate and at the time of the anomalous discharge.\r\n\r\nHancock relates an instance of menstruation from the left breast in a\r\nlarge, otherwise healthy, Englishwoman of thirty-one, who one and a\r\nhalf years after the birth of the youngest child (now ten years old)\r\ncommenced to have a discharge of fluid from the left breast three days\r\nbefore the time of the regular period. As the fluid escaped from the\r\nnipple it became changed in character, passing from a whitish to a\r\nbloody and to a yellowish color respectively, and suddenly terminating\r\nat the beginning of the real flow from the uterus, to reappear again at\r\nthe breast at the close of the flow, and then lasting two or three days\r\nlonger.  Some pain of a lancinating type occurred in the breast at this\r\ntime. The patient first discovered her peculiar condition by a stain of\r\nblood upon the night-gown on awakening in the morning, and this she\r\ntraced to the breast. From an examination it appeared that a neglected\r\nlacerated cervix during the birth of the last child had given rise to\r\nendometritis, and for a year the patient had suffered from severe\r\nmenorrhagia, for which she was subsequently treated. At this time the\r\nmenses became scanty, and then supervened the discharge of bloody fluid\r\nfrom the left breast, as heretofore mentioned. The right breast\r\nremained always entirely passive. A remarkable feature of the case was\r\nthat some escape of fluid occurred from the left breast during coitus.\r\nAs a possible means of throwing light on this subject it may be added\r\nthat the patient was unusually vigorous, and during the nursing of her\r\ntwo children she had more than the ordinary amount of milk\r\n(galactorrhea), which poured from the breast constantly. Since this\r\ntime the breasts had been quite normal, except for the tendency\r\nmanifested in the left one under the conditions given.\r\n\r\nCases of menstruation through the eyes are frequently mentioned by the\r\nolder writers. Bellini, Hellwig, and Dodonaeus all speak of\r\nmenstruation from the eye. Jonston quotes an example of ocular\r\nmenstruation in a young Saxon girl, and Bartholinus an instance\r\nassociated with bloody discharge of the foot. Guepin has an example in\r\na case of a girl of eighteen, who commenced to menstruate when three\r\nyears old. The menstruation was tolerably regular, occurring every\r\nthirty-two or thirty-three days, and lasting from one to six days. At\r\nthe cessation of the menstrual flow, she generally had a supplementary\r\nepistaxis, and on one occasion, when this was omitted, she suffered a\r\nsudden effusion into the anterior chamber of the eye. The discharge had\r\nonly lasted two hours on this occasion. He also relates an example of\r\nhemorrhage into the vitreous humor in a case of amenorrhea.\r\nConjunctival hemorrhage has been noticed as a manifestation of\r\nvicarious menstruation by several American observers. Liebreich found\r\nexamples of retinal hemorrhage in suppressed menstruation, and Sir\r\nJames Paget says that he has seen a young girl at Moorfields who had a\r\nsmall effusion of blood into the anterior chamber of the eye at the\r\nmenstrual period, which became absorbed during the intervals of\r\nmenstruation. Blair relates the history of a case of vicarious\r\nmenstruation attended with conjunctivitis and opacity of the cornea.\r\nLaw speaks of a plethoric woman of thirty who bled freely from the\r\neyes, though menstruating regularly.\r\n\r\nRelative to menstruation from the ear, Spindler, Paullini, and Alibert\r\nfurnish examples. In Paullini's case the discharge is spoken of as very\r\nfoul, which makes it quite possible that this was a case of middle-ear\r\ndisease associated with some menstrual disturbance, and not one of true\r\nvicarious menstruation.  Alibert's case was consequent upon suppression\r\nof the menses. Law cites an instance in a woman of twenty-three, in\r\nwhom the menstrual discharge was suspended several months. She\r\nexperienced fulness of the head and bleeding (largely from the ears),\r\nwhich subsequently occurred periodically, being preceded by much\r\nthrobbing; but the patient finally made a good recovery. Barnes,\r\nStepanoff, and Field adduce examples of this anomaly. Jouilleton\r\nrelates an instance of menstruation from the right ear for five years,\r\nfollowing a miscarriage.\r\n\r\nHemorrhage from the mouth of a vicarious nature has been frequently\r\nobserved associated with menstrual disorders. The Ephemerides,\r\nMeibomius, and Rhodius mention instances. The case of Meibomius was\r\nthat of an infant, and the case mentioned by Rhodius was associated\r\nwith hemorrhages from the lungs, umbilicus, thigh, and tooth-cavity.\r\nAllport reports the history of a case in which there was recession of\r\nthe gingival margins and alveolar processes, the consequence of\r\namenorrhea. Caso has an instance of menstruation from the gums, and\r\nthere is on record the description of a woman, aged thirty-two, who had\r\nbleeding from the throat preceding menstruation; later the menstruation\r\nceased to be regular, and four years previously, after an unfortunate\r\nand violent connection, the menses ceased, and the woman soon developed\r\nhemorrhoids and hemoptysis. Henry speaks of a woman who menstruated\r\nfrom the mouth; at the necropsy 207 stones were found in the\r\ngall-bladder. Krishaber speaks of a case of lingual menstruation at the\r\nepoch of menstruation.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of menstruation from the extremities are quite numerous.\r\nPechlin offers an example from the foot; Boerhaave from the skin of the\r\nhand; Ephemerides from the knee; Albertus from the foot; Zacutus\r\nLusitanus from the left thumb; Bartholinus a curious instance from the\r\nhand; and the Ephemerides another during pregnancy from the ankle.\r\n\r\nPost speaks of a very peculiar case of edema of the arm alternating\r\nwith the menstrual discharge. Sennert writes of menstruation from the\r\ngroin associated with hemorrhage from the umbilicus and gums. Moses\r\noffers an example of hemorrhage from the umbilicus, doubtless\r\nvicarious. Verduc details the history of two cases from the top of the\r\nhead, and Kerokring cites three similar instances, one of which was\r\nassociated with hemorrhage from the hand.\r\n\r\nA peculiar mode is vicarious menstrual hemorrhage through old ulcers,\r\nwounds, or cicatrices, and many examples are on record, a few of which\r\nwill be described. Calder gives an excellent account of menstruation at\r\nan ankle-ulcer, and Brincken says he has seen periodical bleeding from\r\nthe cicatrix of a leprous ulcer. In the Lancet is an account of a case\r\nin the Vienna Hospital of simulated stigmata; the scar opened each\r\nmonth and a menstrual flow proceeded therefrom; but by placing a\r\nplaster-of-Paris bandage about the wound, sealing it so that tampering\r\nwith the wound could be easily detected, healing soon ensued, and the\r\nimposture was thus exposed. Such would likely be the result of the\r\ninvestigation of most cases of \"bleeding wounds\" which are exhibited to\r\nthe ignorant and superstitious for religious purposes.\r\n\r\nHogg publishes a report describing a young lady who injured her leg\r\nwith the broken steel of her crinoline. The wound healed nicely, but\r\nalways burst out afresh the day preceding the regular period. Forster\r\nspeaks of a menstrual ulcer of the face, and Moses two of the head.\r\nWhite, quoted by Barnes, cites an instance of vicarious hemorrhage from\r\nfive deep fissures of the lips in a girl of fourteen; the hemorrhage\r\nwas periodical and could not be checked. At the advent of each\r\nmenstrual period the lips became much congested, and the\r\nrecently-healed menstrual scars burst open anew.\r\n\r\nKnaggs relates an interesting account of a sequel to an operation for\r\novarian disease. Following the operation, there was a regular, painless\r\nmenstruation every month, at which time the lower part of the wound\r\nre-opened, and blood issued forth during the three days of the\r\ncatamenia. McGraw illustrates vicarious menstruation by an example, the\r\ndischarge issuing from an ovariotomy-scar, and Hooper cites an instance\r\nin which the vicarious function was performed by a sloughing ulcer.\r\nBuchanan and Simpson describe \"amenorrheal ulcers.\" Dupuytren speaks of\r\ndenudation of the skin from a burn, with the subsequent development of\r\nvicarious catamenia from the seat of the injury.\r\n\r\nThere are cases on record in which the menstruation occurs by the\r\nrectum or the urinary tract. Barbee illustrates this by a case in which\r\ncholera morbus occurred monthly in lieu of the regular menstrual\r\ndischarge. Barrett speaks of a case of vicarious menstruation by the\r\nrectum. Astbury says he has seen a case of menstruation by the\r\nhemorrhoidal vessels, and instances of relief from plethora by\r\nvicarious menstruation in this manner are quite common. Rosenbladt\r\ncites an instance of menstruation by the bladder, and Salmuth speaks of\r\na pregnant woman who had her monthly flow by the urinary tract. Ford\r\nillustrates this anomaly by the case of a woman of thirty-two, who\r\nbegan normal menstruation at fourteen; for quite a period she had\r\nvicarious menstruation from the urinary tract, which ceased after the\r\nbirth of her last child. The coexistence of a floating kidney in this\r\ncase may have been responsible for this hemorrhage, and in reading\r\nreports of so-called menstruation due consideration must be given to\r\nthe existence of any other than menstrual derangement before we can\r\naccept the cases as true vicarious hemorrhage.  Tarnier cites an\r\ninstance of a girl without a uterus, in whom menstruation proceeded\r\nfrom the vagina. Zacutus Lusitanus relates the history of a case of\r\nuterine occlusion, with the flow from the lips of the cervix. There is\r\nmentioned an instance of menstruation from the labia.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of menstruation after removal of the uterus or ovaries\r\nis frequently reported. Storer, Clay, Tait, and the British and Foreign\r\nMedico-Chirurgical Review report cases in which menstruation took place\r\nwith neither uterus nor ovary.  Doubtless many authentic instances like\r\nthe preceding could be found to-day. Menstruation after hysterectomy\r\nand ovariotomy has been attributed to the incomplete removal of the\r\norgans in question, yet upon postmortem examination of some cases no\r\nvestige of the functional organs in question has been found.\r\n\r\nHematemesis is a means of anomalous menstruation, and several instances\r\nare recorded. Marcellus Donatus and Benivenius exemplify this with\r\ncases. Instances of vicarious and compensatory epistaxis and hemoptysis\r\nare so common that any examples would be superfluous. There is recorded\r\nan inexplicable case of menstruation from the region of the sternum,\r\nand among the curious anomalies of menstruation must be mentioned that\r\nreported by Parvin seen in a woman, who, at the menstrual epoch,\r\nsuffered hemoptysis and oozing of blood from the lips and tongue.\r\nOccasionally there was a substitution of a great swelling of the\r\ntongue, rendering mastication and articulation very difficult for four\r\nor five days. Parvin gives portraits showing the venous congestion and\r\ndiscoloration of the lips.\r\n\r\nInstances of migratory menstruation, the flow moving periodically from\r\nthe ordinary passage to the breasts and mammae, are found in the older\r\nwriters. Salmuth speaks of a woman on whose hands appeared spots\r\nimmediately before the establishment of the menses. Cases of\r\nsemimonthly menstruation and many similar anomalies of periodicity are\r\nspoken of.\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides contains an instance of the simulation of menstruation\r\nafter death, and Testa speaks of menstruation lasting through a long\r\nsleep. Instances of black menstruation are to be found, described in\r\nfull, in the Ephemerides, by Paullini and by Schurig, and in some of\r\nthe later works; it is possible that an excess of iron, administered\r\nfor some menstrual disorder, may cause such an alteration in the color\r\nof the menstrual fluid.\r\n\r\nSuppression of menstruation is brought about in many peculiar ways, and\r\nsometimes by the slightest of causes, some authentic instances being so\r\nstrange as to seem mythical. Through the Ephemerides we constantly read\r\nof such causes as contact with a corpse, the sight of a serpent or\r\nmouse, the sight of monsters, etc. Lightning stroke and curious\r\nneuroses have been reported as causes. Many of the older books on\r\nobstetric subjects are full of such instances, and modern illustrations\r\nare constantly reported.\r\n\r\nMenstruation in Man.--Periodic discharges of blood in man, constituting\r\nwhat is called \"male menstruation,\" have been frequently noticed and\r\nare particularly interesting when the discharge is from the penis or\r\nurethra, furnishing a striking analogy to the female function of\r\nmenstruation. The older authors quoted several such instances, and\r\nMehliss says that in the ancient days certain writers remarked that\r\ncatamenial lustration from the penis was inflicted on the Jews as a\r\ndivine punishment.  Bartholinus mentions a case in a youth; the\r\nEphemerides several instances; Zacutus Lusitanus, Salmuth, Hngedorn,\r\nFabricius Hildanus, Vesalius, Mead, and Acta Eruditorum all mention\r\ninstances. Forel saw menstruation in a man. Gloninger tells of a man of\r\nthirty-six, who, since the age of seventeen years and five months, had\r\nhad lunar manifestations of menstruation. Each attack was accompanied\r\nby pains in the back and hypogastric region, febrile disturbance, and a\r\nsanguineous discharge from the urethra, which resembled in color,\r\nconsistency, etc., the menstrual flux. King relates that while\r\nattending a course of medical lectures at the University of Louisiana\r\nhe formed the acquaintance of a young student who possessed the normal\r\nmale generative organs, but in whom the simulated function of\r\nmenstruation was periodically performed. The cause was inexplicable,\r\nand the unfortunate victim was the subject of deep chagrin, and was\r\nafflicted with melancholia. He had menstruated for three years in this\r\nmanner: a fluid exuded from the sebaceous glands of the deep fossa\r\nbehind the corona glandis; this fluid was of the same appearance as the\r\nmenstrual flux. The quantity was from one to two ounces, and the\r\ndischarge lasted from three to six days. At this time the student was\r\ntwenty-two years of age, of a lymphatic temperament, not particularly\r\nlustful, and was never the victim of any venereal disease. The author\r\ngives no account of the after-life of this man, his whereabouts being,\r\nunfortunately, unknown or omitted.\r\n\r\nVicarious Menstruation in the Male.--This simulation of menstruation by\r\nthe male assumes a vicarious nature as well as in the female. Van\r\nSwieten, quoting from Benivenius, relates a case of a man who once a\r\nmonth sweated great quantities of blood from his right flank. Pinel\r\nmentions a case of a captain in the army (M. Regis), who was wounded by\r\na bullet in the body and who afterward had a monthly discharge from the\r\nurethra. Pinel calls attention particularly to the analogy in this case\r\nby mentioning that if the captain were exposed to fatigue, privation,\r\ncold, etc., he exhibited the ordinary symptoms of amenorrhea or\r\nsuppression. Fournier speaks of a man over thirty years old, who had\r\nbeen the subject of a menstrual evacuation since puberty, or shortly\r\nafter his first sexual intercourse. He would experience pains of the\r\npremenstrual type, about twenty-four hours before the appearance of the\r\nflow, which subsided when the menstruation began. He was of an\r\nintensely voluptuous nature, and constantly gave himself up to sexual\r\nexcesses. The flow was abundant on the first day, diminished on the\r\nsecond, and ceased on the third.  Halliburton, Jouilleton, and Rayman\r\nalso record male menstruation.\r\n\r\nCases of menstruation during pregnancy and lactation are not rare. It\r\nis not uncommon to find pregnancy, lactation, and menstruation\r\ncoexisting. No careful obstetrician will deny pregnancy solely on the\r\nregular occurrence of the menstrual periods, any more than he would\r\nmake the diagnosis of pregnancy from the fact of the suppression of\r\nmenses. Blake reports an instance of catamenia and mammary secretion\r\nduring pregnancy.  Denaux de Breyne mentions a similar case. The child\r\nwas born by a face-presentation. De Saint-Moulin cites an instance of\r\nthe persistence of menstruation during pregnancy in a woman of\r\ntwenty-four, who had never been regular; the child was born at term.\r\nGelly speaks of a case in which menstruation continued until the third\r\nmonth of pregnancy, when abortion occurred. Post, in describing the\r\nbirth of a two-pound child, mentions that menstruation had persisted\r\nduring the mother's pregnancy. Rousset reports a peculiar case in which\r\nmenstruation appeared during the last four months of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThere are some cases on record of child-bearing after the menopause,\r\nas, for instance, that of Pearson, of a woman who had given birth to\r\nnine children up to September, 1836; after this the menses appeared\r\nonly slightly until July, 1838, when they ceased entirely. A year and a\r\nhalf after this she was delivered of her tenth child. Other cases,\r\nsomewhat similar, will be found under the discussion of late conception.\r\n\r\nPrecocious menstruation is seen from birth to nine or ten years.  Of\r\ncourse, menstruation before the third or fourth year is extremely rare,\r\nmost of the cases reported before this age being merely accidental\r\nsanguineous discharges from the genitals, not regularly periodical, and\r\nnot true catamenia. However, there are many authentic cases of\r\ninfantile menstruation on record, which were generally associated with\r\nprecocious development in other parts as well. Billard says that the\r\nsource of infantile menstruation is the lining membrane of the uterus;\r\nbut Camerer explains it as due to ligature of the umbilical cord before\r\nthe circulation in the pulmonary vessels is thoroughly established.  In\r\nthe consideration of this subject, we must bear in mind the influence\r\nof climate and locality on the time of the appearance of menstruation.\r\nIn the southern countries, girls arrive at maturity at an earlier age\r\nthan their sisters of the north.  Medical reports from India show early\r\npuberty of the females of that country. Campbell remarks that girls\r\nattain the age of puberty at twelve in Siam, while, on the contrary,\r\nsome observers report the fact that menstruation does not appear in the\r\nEsquimaux women until the age of twenty-three, and then is very scanty,\r\nand is only present in the summer months.\r\n\r\nCases of menstruation commencing within a few days after birth and\r\nexhibiting periodical recurrence are spoken of by Penada, Neues\r\nHannoverisehes Magazin, Drummond, Buxtorf, Arnold, The Lancet, and the\r\nBritish Medical Journal.\r\n\r\nCecil relates an instance of menstruation on the sixth day, continuing\r\nfor five days, in which six or eight drams of blood were lost. Peeples\r\ncites an instance in Texas in an infant at the age of five days, which\r\nwas associated with a remarkable development of the genital organs and\r\nbreasts. Van Swieten offers an example at the first month; the British\r\nMedical Journal at the second month; Conarmond at the third month.\r\nYsabel, a young slave girl belonging to Don Carlos Pedro of Havana,\r\nbegan to menstruate soon after birth, and at the first year was regular\r\nin this function. At birth her mamma were well developed and her\r\naxillae were slightly covered with hair. At the age of thirty-two\r\nmonths she was three feet ten inches tall, and her genitals and mammae\r\nresembled those of a girl of thirteen. Her voice was grave and\r\nsonorous; her moral inclinations were not known. Deever records an\r\ninstance of a child two years and seven months old who, with the\r\nexception of three months only, had menstruated regularly since the\r\nfourth month. Harle speaks of a child, the youngest of three girls, who\r\nhad a bloody discharge at the age of five months which lasted three\r\ndays and recurred every month until the child was weaned at the tenth\r\nmonth. At the eleventh month it returned and continued periodically\r\nuntil death, occasioned by diarrhea at the fourteenth month. The\r\nnecropsy showed a uterus 1 5/8 inches long, the lips of which were\r\ncongested; the left ovary was twice the size of the right, but\r\ndisplayed nothing strikingly abnormal.  Baillot and the British Medical\r\nJournal cite instances of menstruation at the fourth month. A case is\r\non record of an infant who menstruated at the age of six months, and\r\nwhose menses returned on the twenty-eighth day exactly. Clark, Wall,\r\nand the Lancet give descriptions of cases at the ninth month. Naegele\r\nhas seen a case at the eighteenth month, and Schmidt and Colly in the\r\nsecond year. Another case is that of a child, nineteen months old,\r\nwhose breasts and external genitals were fully developed, although the\r\nchild had shown no sexual desire, and did not exceed other children of\r\nthe same age in intellectual development. This prodigy was\r\nsymmetrically formed and of pleasant appearance.  Warner speaks of\r\nSophie Gantz, of Jewish parentage, born in Cincinnati, July 27, 1865,\r\nwhose menses began at the twenty-third month and had continued\r\nregularly up to the time of reporting. At the age of three years and\r\nsix months she was 38 inches tall, 38 pounds in weight, and her girth\r\nat the hip was 33 1/2 inches. The pelvis was broad and well shaped, and\r\nmeasured 10 1/2 inches from the anterior surface of the spinous process\r\nof one ilium to that of the other, being a little more than the\r\nstandard pelvis of Churchill, and, in consequence of this pelvic\r\ndevelopment, her legs were bowed. The mammae and labia had all the\r\nappearance of established puberty, and the pubes and axillae were\r\ncovered with hair. She was lady-like and maidenly in her demeanor,\r\nwithout unnatural constraint or effrontery. A case somewhat similar,\r\nthough the patient had the appearance of a little old woman, was a\r\nchild of three whose breasts were as well developed as in a girl of\r\ntwenty, and whose sexual organs resembled those of a girl at puberty.\r\nShe had menstruated regularly since the age of two years. Woodruff\r\ndescribes a child who began to menstruate at two years of age and\r\ncontinued regularly thereafter. At the age of six years she was still\r\nmenstruating, and exhibited beginning signs of puberty. She was 118 cm.\r\ntall, her breasts were developed, and she had hair on the mons veneris.\r\nVan der Veer mentions an infant who began menstruating at the early age\r\nof four months and had continued regularly for over two years. She had\r\nthe features and development of a child ten or twelve years old. The\r\nexternal labia and the vulva in all its parts were well formed, and the\r\nmons veneris was covered with a full growth of hair. Sir Astley Cooper,\r\nMandelshof, the Ephemerides, Rause, Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, and several\r\nothers a report instances of menstruation occurring at three years of\r\nage. Le Beau describes an infant prodigy who was born with the mammae\r\nwell formed and as much hair on the mons veneris as a girl of thirteen\r\nor fourteen.  She menstruated at three and continued to do so\r\nregularly, the flow lasting four days and being copious. At the age of\r\nfour years and five months she was 42 1/2 inches tall; her features\r\nwere regular, the complexion rosy, the hair chestnut, the eyes\r\nblue-gray, her mamma the size of a large orange, and indications that\r\nshe would be able to bear children at the age of eight.  Prideaux cites\r\na case at five, and Gaugirau Casals, a doctor of Agde, has seen a girl\r\nof six years who suffered abdominal colic, hemorrhage from the nose,\r\nmigraine, and neuralgia, all periodically, which, with the association\r\nof pruritus of the genitals and engorged mammae, led him to suspect\r\namenorrhea. He ordered baths, and shortly the menstruation appeared and\r\nbecame regular thereafter. Brierre de Boismont records cases of\r\ncatamenia at five, seven, and eight years; and Skene mentions a girl\r\nwho menstruated at ten years and five months. She was in the lowest\r\ngrade of society, living with a drunken father in a tenement house, and\r\nwas of wretched physical constitution, quite ignorant, and of low moral\r\ncharacter, as evinced by her specific vaginitis. Occurring from nine\r\nyears to the ordinary time of puberty, many cases are recorded.\r\n\r\nInstances of protracted menstruation are, as a rule, reliable, the\r\nindividuals themselves being cognizant of the nature of true\r\nmenstruation, and themselves furnishing the requisite information as to\r\nthe nature and periodicity of the discharge in question.  Such cases\r\nrange even past the century-mark. Many elaborate statistics on this\r\nsubject have been gathered by men of ability.  Dr. Meyer of Berlin\r\nquotes the following:--\r\n\r\n  28  at 50 years of age,\r\n   3  at 57 years of age,\r\n  18  \"  51   \"   \"   \"\r\n   3  \"  58   \"   \"   \"\r\n  18  \"  52   \"   \"   \"\r\n   1  \"  59   \"   \"   \"\r\n  11  \"  53   \"   \"   \"\r\n   4  \"  60   \"   \"   \"\r\n  13  \"  54   \"   \"   \"\r\n   4  \"  62   \"   \"   \"\r\n   5  \"  55   \"   \"   \"\r\n   3  \"  63   \"   \"   \"\r\n   4  \"  56   \"   \"   \"\r\n\r\nThese statistics were from examination of 6000 cases of menstruating\r\nwomen. The last seven were found to be in women in the highest class of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nMehliss has made the following collection of statistics of a somewhat\r\nsimilar nature--\r\n\r\n                      Late Dentition.   Late          Late\r\n                      Male.  Female.   Lactation.  Menstruation.\r\n  Between 40 and 50    0         4        0            0\r\n          \" 50 \" 60    1         4        2            1\r\n          \" 60 \" 70    3         2        1            0\r\n          \" 70 \" 80    3         2        0            7\r\n          \" 80 \" 90    6         2        0            0\r\n         \" 90 \" 100    1         1        0            1\r\n    Above 100 .....    6         1        0            1\r\n                      --        --       --           --\r\n                      20        16       3           10\r\n\r\nThese statistics seem to have been made with the idea of illustrating\r\nthe marvelous rather than to give the usual prolongation of these\r\nfunctions. It hardly seems possible that ordinary investigation would\r\nshow no cases of menstruation between sixty and seventy, and seven\r\ncases between seventy and eighty; however, in searching literature for\r\nsuch a collection, we must bear in mind that the more extraordinary the\r\ninstance, the more likely it is that it would be spoken of, as the\r\nnatural tendency of medical men is to overlook the important ordinary\r\nand report the nonimportant extraordinary. Dewees mentions an example\r\nof menstruation at sixty-five, and others at fifty-four and fifty-five\r\nyears. Motte speaks of a case at sixty-one; Ryan and others, at\r\nfifty-five, sixty, and sixty-five; Parry, from sixty-six to seventy\r\nseven; Desormeux, from sixty to seventy-five; Semple, at seventy and\r\neighty seven; Higgins, at seventy-six; Whitehead, at seventy-seven;\r\nBernstein, at seventy-eight; Beyrat, at eighty-seven; Haller, at one\r\nhundred; and highest of all is Blancardi's case, in which menstruation\r\nwas present at one hundred and six years. In the London Medical and\r\nSurgical Journal, 1831, are reported cases at eighty and ninety-five\r\nyears. In Good's System of Nosology there are instances occurring at\r\nseventy-one, eighty, and ninety years.  There was a woman in Italy\r\nwhose menstrual function continued from twenty-four to ninety years.\r\nEmmet cites an instance of menstruation at seventy, and Brierre de\r\nBoismont one of a woman who menstruated regularly from her\r\ntwenty-fourth year to the time of her death at ninety-two.\r\n\r\nStrasberger of Beeskow describes a woman who ceased menstruating at\r\nforty-two, who remained in good health up to eighty, suffering slight\r\nattacks of rheumatism only, and at this late age was seized with\r\nabdominal pains, followed by menstruation, which continued for three\r\nyears; the woman died the next year. This late menstruation had all the\r\nsensible characters of the early one. Kennard mentions a negress, aged\r\nninety-one, who menstruated at fourteen, ceased at forty-nine, and at\r\neighty-two commenced again, and was regular for four years, but had had\r\nno return since. On the return of her menstruation, believing that her\r\nprocreative powers were returning, she married a vigorous negro of\r\nthirty-five and experienced little difficulty in satisfying his\r\ndesires. Du Peyrou de Cheyssiole and Bonhoure speak of an aged peasant\r\nwoman, past ninety-one years of age, who menstruated regularly.\r\n\r\nPetersen describes a woman of seventy-nine, who on March 26th was\r\nseized with uterine pains lasting a few days and terminating with\r\nhemorrhagic discharge. On April 23d she was seized again, and a\r\ndischarge commenced on the 25th, continuing four days. Up to the time\r\nof the report, one year after, this menstruation had been regular.\r\nThere is an instance on record of a female who menstruated every three\r\nmonths during the period from her fiftieth to her seventy-fourth year,\r\nthe discharge, however, being very slight. Thomas cites an instance of\r\na woman of sixty-nine who had had no menstruation since her forty-ninth\r\nyear, but who commenced again the year he saw her. Her mother and\r\nsister were similarly affected at the age of sixty, in the first case\r\nattributable to grief over the death of a son, in the second ascribed\r\nto fright. It seemed to be a peculiar family idiosyncrasy. Velasquez of\r\nTarentum says that the Abbess of Monvicaro at the very advanced age of\r\none hundred had a recurrence of catamenia after a severe illness, and\r\nsubsequently a new set of teeth and a new growth of hair.\r\n\r\nLate Establishment of Menstruation.--In some cases menstruation never\r\nappears until late in life, presenting the same phenomena as normal\r\nmenstruation. Perfect relates the history of a woman who had been\r\nmarried many years, and whose menstruation did not appear until her\r\nforty-seventh year. She was a widow at the time, and had never been\r\npregnant. Up to the time of her death, which was occasioned by a\r\nconvulsive colic, in her fifty-seventh year, she had the usual\r\nprodromes of menstruation followed by the usual discharge. Rodsewitch\r\nspeaks of a widow of a peasant who menstruated for the first time at\r\nthe age of thirty-six. Her first coitus took place at the age of\r\nfifteen, before any signs of menstruation had appeared, and from this\r\ntime all through her married life she was either pregnant or suckling.\r\nHer husband died when thirty-six years old, and ever since the\r\ncatamenial flow had shown itself with great regularity. She had borne\r\ntwins in her second, fourth, and eighth confinement, and altogether had\r\n16 children. Holdefrund in 1836 mentions a case in which menstruation\r\ndid not commence until the seventieth year, and Hoyer mentions one\r\ndelayed to the seventy-sixth year. Marx of Krakau speaks of a woman,\r\naged forty-eight, who had never menstruated; until forty-two years old\r\nshe had felt no symptoms, but at this time pain began, and at\r\nforty-eight regular menstruation ensued. At the time of report, four\r\nyears after, she was free from pain and amenorrhea, and her flow was\r\nregular, though scant. She had been married since she was twenty-eight\r\nyears of age. A somewhat similar case is mentioned by Gregory of a\r\nmother of 7 children who had never had her menstrual flow.  There are\r\ntwo instances of delayed menstruation quoted: the first, a woman of\r\nthirty, well formed, healthy, of good social position, and with all the\r\nsigns of puberty except menstruation, which had never appeared; the\r\nsecond, a married woman of forty-two, who throughout a healthy\r\nconnubial life had never menstruated. An instance is known to the\r\nauthors of a woman of forty who has never menstruated, though she is of\r\nexceptional vigor and development. She has been married many years\r\nwithout pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe medical literature relative to precocious impregnation is full of\r\nmarvelous instances. Individually, many of the cases would be beyond\r\ncredibility, but when instance after instance is reported by reliable\r\nauthorities we must accept the possibility of their occurrence, even if\r\nwe doubt the statements of some of the authorities. No less a medical\r\ncelebrity than the illustrious Sir Astley Cooper remarks that on one\r\noccasion he saw a girl in Scotland, seven years old, whose pelvis was\r\nso fully developed that he was sure she could easily give birth to a\r\nchild; and Warner's case of the Jewish girl three and a half years old,\r\nwith a pelvis of normal width, more than substantiates this\r\nsupposition. Similar examples of precocious pelvic and sexual\r\ndevelopment are on record in abundance, and nearly every medical man of\r\nexperience has seen cases of infantile masturbation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary period of female maturity is astonishingly late when\r\ncompared with the lower animals of the same size, particularly when\r\nviewed with cases of animal precocity on record. Berthold speaks of a\r\nkid fourteen days old which was impregnated by an adult goat, and at\r\nthe usual period of gestation bore a kid, which was mature but weak, to\r\nwhich it gave milk in abundance, and both the mother and kid grew up\r\nstrong. Compared with the above, child-bearing by women of eight is not\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe earliest case of conception that has come to the authors' notice is\r\na quotation in one of the last century books from von Mandelslo of\r\nimpregnation at six; but a careful search in the British Museum failed\r\nto confirm this statement, and, for the present, we must accept the\r\nstatement as hearsay and without authority available for\r\nreference-purposes.\r\n\r\nMolitor gives an instance of precocious pregnancy in a child of eight.\r\nIt was probably the same case spoken of by Lefebvre and reported to the\r\nBelgium Academy: A girl, born in Luxemborg, well developed sexually,\r\nhaving hair on the pubis at birth, who menstruated at four, and at the\r\nage of eight was impregnated by a cousin of thirty-seven, who was\r\nsentenced to five years' imprisonment for seduction. The pregnancy\r\nterminated by the expulsion of a mole containing a well-characterized\r\nhuman embryo.  Schmidt's case in 1779 was in a child who had\r\nmenstruated at two, and bore a dead fetus when she was but eight years\r\nand ten months old. She had all the appearance and development of a\r\ngirl of seventeen. Kussmaul gives an example of conception at eight.\r\nDodd speaks of a child who menstruated early and continued up to the\r\ntime of impregnation. She was a hard worker and did all her mother's\r\nwashing. Her labor pains did not continue over six hours, from first to\r\nthe last. The child was a large one, weighing 7 pounds, and afterward\r\ndied in convulsions. The infant's left foot had but 3 toes. The young\r\nmother at the time of delivery was only nine years and eight months\r\nold, and consequently must have been impregnated before the age of\r\nnine.  Meyer gives an astonishing instance of birth in a Swiss girl at\r\nnine. Carn describes a case of a child who menstruated at two, became\r\npregnant at eight, and lived to an advanced age. Ruttel reports\r\nconception in a girl of nine, and as far north as St.  Petersburg a\r\ngirl has become a mother before nine years. The Journal de Scavans,\r\n1684, contains the report of the case of a boy, who survived, being\r\nborn to a mother of nine years.\r\n\r\nBeck has reported an instance of delivery in a girl a little over ten\r\nyears of age. There are instances of fecundity at nine years recorded\r\nby Ephemerides, Wolffius, Savonarola, and others.  Gleaves reports from\r\nWytheville, Va., the history of what he calls the case of the youngest\r\nmother in Virginia--Annie H.--who was born in Bland County, July 15,\r\n1885, and, on September 10, 1895, was delivered of a well-formed child\r\nweighing 5 pounds. The girl had not the development of a woman,\r\nalthough she had menstruated regularly since her fifth year. The labor\r\nwas short and uneventful, and, two hours afterward, the child-mother\r\nwanted to arise and dress and would have done so had she been\r\npermitted.  There were no developments of the mammae nor secretion of\r\nmilk.  The baby was nourished through its short existence (as it only\r\nlived a week) by its grandmother, who had a child only a few months\r\nold. The parents of this child were prosperous, intelligent, and worthy\r\npeople, and there was no doubt of the child's age. \"Annie is now well\r\nand plays about with the other children as if nothing had happened.\"\r\nHarris refers to a Kentucky woman, a mother at ten years, one in\r\nMassachusetts a mother at ten years, eight months, and seventeen days,\r\nand one in Philadelphia at eleven years and three months. The first\r\ncase was one of infantile precocity, the other belonging to a much\r\nlater period, the menstrual function having been established but a few\r\nmonths prior to conception. All these girls had well-developed pelves,\r\nlarge mammae, and the general marks of womanhood, and bore living\r\nchildren. It has been remarked of 3 very markedly precocious cases of\r\npregnancy that one was the daughter of very humble parents, one born in\r\nan almshouse, and the other raised by her mother in a house of\r\nprostitution. The only significance of this statement is the greater\r\namount of vice and opportunity for precocious sexual intercourse to\r\nwhich they were exposed; doubtless similar cases under more favorable\r\nconditions would never be recognized as such.\r\n\r\nThe instance in the Journal decavans is reiterated in 1775, which is\r\nbut such a repetition as is found all through medical literature--\"new\r\nfriends with old faces,\" as it were. Haller observed a case of\r\nimpregnation in a girl of nine, who had menstruated several years, and\r\nothers who had become pregnant at nine, ten, and twelve years\r\nrespectively. Rowlett, whose case is mentioned by Harris, saw a child\r\nwho had menstruated the first year and regularly thereafter, and gave\r\nbirth to a child weighing 7 3/4 pounds when she was only ten years and\r\nthirteen days old.  At the time of delivery she measured 4 feet 7\r\ninches in height and weighed 100 pounds. Curtis, who is also quoted by\r\nHarris, relates the history of Elizabeth Drayton, who became pregnant\r\nbefore she was ten, and was delivered of a full-grown, living male\r\nchild weighing 8 pounds. She had menstruated once or twice before\r\nconception, was fairly healthy during gestation, and had a rather\r\nlingering but natural labor. To complete the story, the father of this\r\nchild was a boy of fifteen. One of the faculty of Montpellier has\r\nreported an instance at New Orleans of a young girl of eleven, who\r\nbecame impregnated by a youth who was not yet sixteen. Maygrier says\r\nthat he knew a girl of twelve, living in the Faubourg Saint-Germain,\r\nwho was confined.\r\n\r\nHarris relates the particulars of the case of a white girl who began to\r\nmenstruate at eleven years and four months, and who gave birth to an\r\nover-sized male child on January 21, 1872, when she was twelve years\r\nand nine months old. She had an abundance of milk and nursed the child;\r\nthe labor was of about eighteen hours' duration, and laceration was\r\navoided. He also speaks of a mulatto girl, born in 1848, who began to\r\nmenstruate at eleven years and nine months, and gave birth to a female\r\nchild before she reached thirteen, and bore a second child when\r\nfourteen years and seven months old. The child's father was a white boy\r\nof seventeen.\r\n\r\nThe following are some Indian statistics: 1 pregnancy at ten, 6 at\r\neleven, 2 at eighteen, 1 at nineteen. Chevers speaks of a mother at ten\r\nand others at eleven and twelve; and Green, at Dacca, performed\r\ncraniotomy upon the fetus of a girl of twelve.  Wilson gives an account\r\nof a girl thirteen years old, who gave birth to a full-grown female\r\nchild after three hours' labor. She made a speedy convalescence, but\r\nthe child died four weeks afterward from bad nursing. The lad who\r\nacknowledged paternity was nineteen years old. King reports a\r\nwell-verified case of confinement in a girl of eleven. Both the mother\r\nand child did well.\r\n\r\nRobertson of Manchester describes a girl, working in a cotton factory,\r\nwho was a mother at twelve; de La Motte mentions pregnancy before\r\ntwelve; Kilpatrick in a negress, at eleven years and six months; Fox,\r\nat twelve; Hall, at twelve; Kinney, at twelve years, ten months, and\r\nsixteen days; Herrick, at thirteen years and nine months; Murillo, at\r\nthirteen years; Philippart, at fourteen years; Stallcup, at eleven\r\nyears and nine months; Stoakley, at thirteen years; Walker, at the age\r\nof twelve years and eight months; another case, at twelve years and six\r\nmonths; and Williams, at eleven.\r\n\r\nAn editorial article in the Indian Medical Gazette of Sept., 1890,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"The appearance of menstruation is held by the great majority of\r\nnatives of India to be evidence and proof of marriageability, but among\r\nthe Hindu community it is considered disgraceful that a girl should\r\nremain unmarried until this function is established.  The consequence\r\nis that girls are married at the age of nine or ten years, but it is\r\nunderstood or professed that the consummation of the marriage is\r\ndelayed until after the first menstrual period. There is, however, too\r\nmuch reason to believe that the earlier ceremony is very frequently,\r\nperhaps commonly, taken to warrant resort to sexual intercourse before\r\nthe menstrual flux has occurred: it may be accepted as true that\r\npremenstrual copulation is largely practised under the cover of\r\nmarriage in this country.\r\n\r\n\"From this practice it results that girls become mothers at the\r\nearliest possible period of their lives. A native medical witness\r\ntestified that in about 20 per cent of marriages children were born by\r\nwives of from twelve to thirteen years of age. Cases of death caused by\r\nthe first act of sexual intercourse are by no means rare. They are\r\nnaturally concealed, but ever and anon they come to light. Dr. Chevers\r\nmentioned some 14 cases of this sort in the last edition of his\r\n'Handbook of Medical Jurisprudence for India,' and Dr. Harvey found 5\r\nin the medicolegal returns submitted by the Civil Surgeons of the\r\nBengal Presidency during the years 1870-71-72.\r\n\r\n\"Reform must come from conviction and effort, as in every other case,\r\nbut meantime the strong arm of the law should be put forth for the\r\nprotection of female children from the degradation and hurt entailed by\r\npremature sexual intercourse. This can easily be done by raising the\r\nage of punishable intercourse, which is now fixed at the absurd limit\r\nof ten years. Menstruation very seldom appears in native girls before\r\nthe completed age of twelve years, and if the 'age of consent' were\r\nraised to that limit, it would not interfere with the prejudices and\r\ncustoms which insist on marriage before menstruation.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1816 some girls were admitted to the Paris Maternite as young as\r\nthirteen, and during the Revolution several at eleven, and even\r\nyounger. Smith speaks of a legal case in which a girl, eleven years\r\nold, being safely delivered of a living child, charged her uncle with\r\nrape. Allen speaks of a girl who became pregnant at twelve years and\r\nnine months, and was delivered of a healthy, 9-pound boy before the\r\nphysician's arrival; the placenta came away afterward, and the mother\r\nmade a speedy recovery. She was thought to have had \"dropsy of the\r\nabdomen,\" as the parents had lost a girl of about the same age who was\r\ntapped for ascites.  The father of the child was a boy only fourteen\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nMarvelous to relate, there are on record several cases of twins being\r\nborn to a child mother. Kay reports a case of twins in a girl of\r\nthirteen; Montgomery, at fourteen; and Meigs reports the case of a\r\nyoung girl, of Spanish blood, at Maracaibo, who gave birth to a child\r\nbefore she was twelve and to twins before reaching fourteen years.\r\n\r\nIn the older works, the following authors have reported cases of\r\npregnancy before the appearance of menstruation: Ballonius, Vogel,\r\nMorgagni, the anatomist of the kidney, Schenck, Bartholinus, Bierling,\r\nZacchias, Charleton, Mauriceau, Ephemerides, and Fabricius Hildanus.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this precocity seems to be hereditary, being transmitted\r\nfrom mother to daughter, bringing about an almost incredible state of\r\naffairs, in which a girl is a grandmother about the ordinary age of\r\nmaternity. Kay says that he had reported to him, on \"pretty good\"\r\nauthority, an instance of a Damascus Jewess who became a grandmother at\r\ntwenty-one years. In France they record a young grandmother of\r\ntwenty-eight. Ketchum speaks of a negress, aged thirteen, who gave\r\nbirth to a well-developed child which began to menstruate at ten years\r\nand nine months and at thirteen became pregnant; hence the negress was\r\na grandmother at twenty-five years and nine months. She had a second\r\nchild before she was sixteen, who began to menstruate at seven years\r\nand six months, thus proving the inheritance of this precocity, and\r\nleaving us at sea to figure what degree of grandmother she may be if\r\nshe lives to an advanced age. Another interesting case of this nature\r\nis that of Mrs. C., born 1854, married in 1867, and who had a daughter\r\nten months after. This daughter married in 1882, and in March, 1883,\r\ngave birth to a 9-pound boy. The youthful grandmother, not twenty-nine,\r\nwas present at the birth. This case was remarkable, as the children\r\nwere both legitimate.\r\n\r\nFecundity in the old seems to have attracted fully as much attention\r\namong the older observers as precocity. Pliny speaks of Cornelia, of\r\nthe family of Serpios, who bore a son at sixty, who was named Volusius\r\nSaturnius; and Marsa, a physician of Venice, was deceived in a\r\npregnancy in a woman of sixty, his diagnosis being \"dropsy.\" Tarenta\r\nrecords the history of the case of a woman who menstruated and bore\r\nchildren when past the age of sixty. Among the older reports are those\r\nof Blanchard of a woman who bore a child at sixty years; Fielitz, one\r\nat sixty; Ephemerides, one at sixty-two; Rush, one at sixty; Bernstein,\r\none at sixty years; Schoepfer, at seventy years; and, almost beyond\r\nbelief, Debes cites an instance as taking place at the very advanced\r\nage of one hundred and three. Wallace speaks of a woman in the Isle of\r\nOrkney bearing children when past the age of sixty. We would naturally\r\nexpect to find the age of child-bearing prolonged in the northern\r\ncountries where the age of maturity is later. Capuron cites an example\r\nof child-birth in a woman of sixty; Haller, cases at fifty-eight,\r\nsixty-three, and seventy; Dewees, at sixty-one; and Thibaut de\r\nChauvalon, in a woman of Martinique aged ninety years. There was a\r\nwoman delivered in Germany, in 1723, at the age of fifty-five; one at\r\nfifty-one in Kentucky; and one in Russia at fifty. Depasse speaks of a\r\nwoman of fifty-nine years and five months old who was delivered of a\r\nhealthy male child, which she suckled, weaning it on her sixtieth\r\nbirthday. She had been a widow for twenty years, and had ceased to\r\nmenstruate nearly ten years before. In St. Peter's Church, in East\r\nOxford, is a monument bearing an inscription recording the death in\r\nchild-birth of a woman sixty-two years old. Cachot relates the case of\r\na woman of fifty-three, who was delivered of a living child by means of\r\nthe forceps, and a year after bore a second child without instrumental\r\ninterference. She had no milk in her breasts at the time and no signs\r\nof secretion. This aged mother had been married at fifty-two, five\r\nyears after the cessation of her menstruation, and her husband was a\r\nyoung man, only twenty-four years old.\r\n\r\nKennedy reports a delivery at sixty-two years, and the Cincinnati\r\nEnquirer, January, 1863, says: \"Dr. W. McCarthy was in attendance on a\r\nlady of sixty-nine years, on Thursday night last, who gave birth to a\r\nfine boy. The father of the child is seventy-four years old, and the\r\nmother and child are doing well.\" Quite recently there died in Great\r\nBritain a Mrs. Henry of Gortree at the age of one hundred and twelve,\r\nleaving a daughter of nine years.\r\n\r\nMayham saw a woman seventy-three years old who recovered after delivery\r\nof a child. A most peculiar case is that of a widow, seventy years old,\r\na native of Garches. She had been in the habit of indulging freely in\r\nwine, and, during the last six months, to decided excess. After an\r\nunusually prolonged libation she found herself unable to walk home; she\r\nsat down by the roadside waiting until she could proceed, and was so\r\nfound by a young man who knew her and who proposed helping her home. By\r\nthe time her house was reached night was well advanced, and she invited\r\nhim to stop over night; finding her more than affable, he stopped at\r\nher house over four nights, and the result of his visits was an ensuing\r\npregnancy for Madame.\r\n\r\nMultiple births in the aged have been reported from authentic sources.\r\nThe Lancet quotes a rather fabulous account of a lady over sixty-two\r\nyears of age who gave birth to triplets, making her total number of\r\nchildren 13. Montgomery, Colomb, and Knehel, each, have recorded the\r\nbirth of twins in women beyond the usual age of the menopause, and\r\nthere is a case recorded of a woman of fifty-two who was delivered of\r\ntwins.\r\n\r\nImpregnation without completion of the copulative act by reason of some\r\nmalformation, such as occlusion of the vagina or uterus, fibrous and\r\nunruptured hymen, etc., has been a subject of discussion in the works\r\nof medical jurisprudence of all ages; and cases of conception without\r\nentrance of the penis are found in abundance throughout medical\r\nliterature, and may have an important medicolegal bearing. There is\r\nlittle doubt of the possibility of spermatozoa deposited on the\r\ngenitalia making progress to the seat of fertilization, as their power\r\nof motility and tenacity of life have been well demonstrated. Percy\r\nreports an instance in which semen was found issuing from the os uteri\r\neight and one-half days after the last intercourse; and a microscopic\r\nexamination of this semen revealed the presence of living as well as\r\ndead spermatozoa. We have occasional instances of impregnation by\r\nrectal coitus, the semen finding its way into an occluded vaginal canal\r\nby a fistulous communication.\r\n\r\nGuillemeau, the surgeon of the French king, tells of a girl of\r\neighteen, who was brought before the French officials in Paris, in\r\n1607, on the citation of her husband of her inability to allow him\r\ncompletion of the marital function. He alleged that he had made several\r\nunsuccessful attempts to enter her, and in doing so had caused\r\nparaphimosis. On examination by the surgeons she was found to have a\r\ndense membrane, of a fibrous nature, entirely occluding the vagina,\r\nwhich they incised. Immediately afterward the woman exhibited morning\r\nsickness and the usual signs of pregnancy, and was delivered in four\r\nmonths of a full-term child, the results of an impregnation occasioned\r\nby one of the unsuccessful attempts at entrance. Such instances are\r\nnumerous in the older literature, and a mere citation of a few is\r\nconsidered sufficient here. Zacchias, Amand, Fabricius Hildanus, Graaf,\r\nthe discoverer of the follicles that bear his name, Borellus, Blegny,\r\nBlanchard, Diemerbroeck, Duddell, Mauriceau, a Reyes, Riolan, Harvey,\r\nthe discoverer of the circulation of the blood, Wolfius, Walther,\r\nRongier, Ruysch, Forestus, Ephemerides, and Schurig all mention cases\r\nof conception with intact hymen, and in which there was no entrance of\r\nthe penis. Tolberg has an example of hymen integrum after the birth of\r\na fetus five months old, and there is recorded a case of tubal\r\npregnancy in which the hymen was intact.\r\n\r\nGilbert gives an account of a case of pregnancy in an unmarried woman,\r\nwho successfully resisted an attempt at criminal connection and yet\r\nbecame impregnated and gave birth to a perfectly formed female child.\r\nThe hymen was not ruptured, and the impregnation could not have\r\npreceded the birth more than thirty-six weeks. Unfortunately, this poor\r\nwoman was infected with gonorrhea after the attempted assault. Simmons\r\nof St. Louis gives a curious peculiarity of conception, in which there\r\nwas complete closure of the vagina, subsequent conception, and delivery\r\nat term. He made the patient's acquaintance from her application to him\r\nin regard to a malcondition of her sexual apparatus, causing much\r\ndomestic infelicity.\r\n\r\nLawson speaks of a woman of thirty-five, who had been married ten\r\nmonths, and whose husband could never effect an entrance; yet she\r\nbecame pregnant and had a normal labor, despite the fact that, in\r\naddition to a tough and unruptured hymen, she had an occluding vaginal\r\ncyst. Hickinbotham of Birmingham reports the history of two cases of\r\nlabor at term in females whose hymens were immensely thickened. H. Grey\r\nEdwards has seen a case of imperforate hymen which had to be torn\r\nthrough in labor; yet one single act of copulation, even with this\r\nobstacle to entrance, sufficed to impregnate. Champion speaks of a\r\nwoman who became pregnant although her hymen was intact. She had been\r\nin the habit of having coitus by the urethra, and all through her\r\npregnancy continued this practice.\r\n\r\nHoughton speaks of a girl of twenty-five into whose vagina it was\r\nimpossible to pass the tip of the first finger on account of the dense\r\ncicatricial membrane in the orifice, but who gave birth, with\r\ncomparative ease, to a child at full term, the only interference\r\nnecessary being a few slight incisions to permit the passage of the\r\nhead. Tweedie saw an Irish girl of twenty-three, with an imperforate os\r\nuteri, who had menstruated only scantily since fourteen and not since\r\nher marriage. She became pregnant and went to term, and required some\r\noperative interference. He incised at the point of usual location of\r\nthe os, and one of his incisions was followed by the flow of liquor\r\namnii, and the head fell upon the artificial opening, the diameter of\r\nwhich proved to be one and a half or two inches; the birth then\r\nprogressed promptly, the child being born alive.\r\n\r\nGuerard notes an instance in which the opening barely admitted a hair;\r\nyet the patient reached the third month of pregnancy, at which time she\r\ninduced abortion in a manner that could not be ascertained. Roe gives a\r\ncase of conception in an imperforate uterus, and Duncan relates the\r\nhistory of a case of pregnancy in an unruptured hymen, characterized by\r\nan extraordinary ascent of the uterus. Among many, the following modern\r\nobservers have also reported instances of pregnancy with hymen\r\nintegrum: Braun, 3 cases; Francis, Horton, Oakman, Brill, 2 cases;\r\nBurgess, Haig, Hay, and Smith.\r\n\r\nInstances in which the presence of an unruptured hymen has complicated\r\nor retarded actual labor are quite common, and until the membrane is\r\nruptured by external means the labor is often effectually obstructed.\r\nAmong others reporting cases of this nature are Beale, Carey, Davis,\r\nEmond Fetherston, Leisenring, Mackinlay, Martinelli, Palmer, Rousseau,\r\nWare, and Yale.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases of stricture or complete occlusion of the vagina,\r\ncongenital or acquired from cicatricial contraction, obstructing\r\ndelivery, and in some the impregnation seems more marvelous than cases\r\nin which the obstruction is only a thin membranous hymen. Often the\r\nobstruction is so dense as to require a large bistoury to divide it,\r\nand even that is not always sufficient, and the Cesarean operation only\r\ncan terminate the obstructed delivery; we cannot surmise how conception\r\ncould have been possible. Staples records a case of pregnancy and\r\nparturition with congenital stricture of the vagina. Maisonneuve\r\nmentions the successful practice of a Cesarean operation in a case of\r\ncongenital occlusion of the vagina forming a complete obstruction to\r\ndelivery. Verdile records an instance of imperforate vagina in which\r\nrectovaginal wall was divided and the delivery effected through the\r\nrectum and anus. Lombard mentions an observation of complete occlusion\r\nof the vagina in a woman, the mother of 4 living children and pregnant\r\nfor the fifth time.  Thus, almost incredible to relate, it is possible\r\nfor a woman to become a mother of a living child and yet preserve all\r\nthe vaginal evidences of virginity. Cole describes a woman of\r\ntwenty-four who was delivered without the rupture of the hymen, and\r\nMeek remarks on a similar case. We can readily see that, in a case like\r\nthat of Verdile, in which rectal delivery is effected, the hymen could\r\nbe left intact and the product of conception be born alive.\r\n\r\nA natural sequence to the subject of impregnation without entrance is\r\nthat of artificial impregnation. From being a matter of wonder and\r\nhearsay, it has been demonstrated as a practical and useful method in\r\nthose cases in which, by reason of some unfortunate anatomic\r\nmalformation on either the male or the female side, the marriage is\r\nunfruitful. There are many cases constantly occurring in which the\r\nbirth of an heir is a most desirable thing in a person's life. The\r\nhistoric instance of Queen Mary of England, whose anxiety and efforts\r\nto bear a child were the subject of public comment and prayers, is but\r\nan example of a fact that is occurring every day, and doubtless some of\r\nthese cases could be righted by the pursuance of some of the methods\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nThere have been rumors from the beginning of the century of women being\r\nimpregnated in a bath, from contact with cloths containing semen, etc.,\r\nand some authorities in medical jurisprudence have accepted the\r\npossibility of such an occurrence. It is not in the province of this\r\nwork to speculate on what may be, but to give authoritative facts, from\r\nwhich the reader may draw his own deductions. Fertilization of plants\r\nhas been thought to have been known in the oldest times, and there are\r\nsome who believe that the library at Alexandria must have contained\r\nsome information relative to it. The first authentic account that we\r\nhave of artificial impregnation is that of Schwammerdam, who in 1680\r\nattempted it without success by the fecundation of the eggs of fish.\r\nRoesel, his scholar, made an attempt in 1690, but also failed; and to\r\nJacobi, in 1700, belongs the honor of success. In 1780, Abbe\r\nSpallanzani, following up the success of Jacobi, artificially\r\nimpregnated a bitch, who brought forth in sixty-two days 3 puppies, all\r\nresembling the male. The illustrious John Hunter advised a man\r\nafflicted with hypospadias to impregnate his wife by vaginal injections\r\nof semen in water with an ordinary syringe, and, in spite of the\r\nsimplicity of this method, the attempt was followed by a successful\r\nissue. Since this time, Nicholas of Nancy and Lesueur have practised\r\nthe simple vaginal method; while Gigon, d'Angouleme (14 cases), Girault\r\n(10 cases), Marion Sims, Thomas, Salmon, Pajot, Gallard, Courty,\r\nRoubaud, Dehaut, and others have used the more modern uterine method\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\nA dog-breeder, by syringing the uterus of a bitch, has succeeded in\r\nimpregnating her. Those who are desirous of full information on this\r\nsubject, as regards the modus operandi, etc., are referred to Girault;\r\nthis author reports in full several examples. One case was that of a\r\nwoman, aged twenty-five, afflicted with blenorrhea, who, chagrined at\r\nnot having issue, made repeated forcible injections of semen in water\r\nfor two months, and finally succeeded in impregnating herself, and was\r\ndelivered of a living child. Another case was that of a female, aged\r\ntwenty-three, who had an extra long vaginal canal, probably accounting\r\nfor the absence of pregnancy. She made injections of semen, and was\r\nfinally delivered of a child. He also reports the case of a\r\ndistinguished musician who, by reason of hypospadias, had never\r\nimpregnated his wife, and had resorted to injections of semen with a\r\nfavorable result. This latter case seems hardly warranted when we\r\nconsider that men afflicted with hypospadias and epispadias have become\r\nfathers. Percy gives the instance of a gentleman whom he had known for\r\nsome time, whose urethra terminated a little below the frenum, as in\r\nother persons, but whose glans bulged quite prominently beyond it,\r\nrendering urination in the forward direction impossible. Despite the\r\nfact that this man could not perform the ejaculatory function, he was\r\nthe father of three children, two of them inheriting his penile\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental condition of fecundity being the union of a\r\nspermatozoid and an ovum, the object of artificial impregnation is to\r\nfurther this union by introducing semen directly to the fundus of the\r\nuterus. The operation is quite simple and as follows: The husband,\r\nhaving been found perfectly healthy, is directed to cohabit with his\r\nwife, using a condom. The semen ejaculated is sucked up by an\r\nintrauterine syringe which has been properly disinfected and kept warm.\r\nThe os uteri is now exposed and wiped off with some cotton which has\r\nbeen dipped in an antiseptic fluid; introduced to the fundus of the\r\nuterus, and some drops of the fluid slowly expressed into the uterus.\r\nThe woman is then kept in bed on her back. This operation is best\r\ncarried out immediately before or immediately after the menstrual\r\nepoch, and if not successful at the first attempt should be repeated\r\nfor several months. At the present day artificial impregnation in\r\npisciculture is extensively used with great success.\r\n\r\n{footnote} The following extraordinary incident of accidental\r\nimpregnation, quoted from the American Medical Weekly by the Lancet, is\r\ngiven in brief, not because it bears any semblance of possibility, but\r\nas a curious example from the realms of imagination in medicine.\r\n\r\nL. G. Capers of Vicksburg, Miss., relates an incident during the late\r\nCivil War, as follows: A matron and her two daughters, aged fifteen and\r\nseventeen years, filled with the enthusiasm of patriotism, stood ready\r\nto minister to the wounds of their countrymen in their fine residence\r\nnear the scene of the battle of R----, May 12, 1863, between a portion\r\nof Grant's army and some Confederates. During the fray a gallant and\r\nnoble young friend of the narrator staggered and fell to the earth; at\r\nthe same time a piercing cry was heard in the house near by.\r\nExamination of the wounded soldier showed that a bullet had passed\r\nthrough the scrotum and carried away the left testicle.  The same\r\nbullet had apparently penetrated the left side of the abdomen of the\r\nelder young lady, midway between the umbilicus and the anterior\r\nsuperior spinous process of the ilium, and had become lost in the\r\nabdomen. This daughter suffered an attack of peritonitis, but recovered\r\nin two months under the treatment administered.\r\n\r\nMarvelous to relate, just two hundred and seventy-eight days after the\r\nreception of the minie-ball, she was delivered of a fine boy, weighing\r\n8 pounds, to the surprise of herself and the mortification of her\r\nparents and friends. The hymen was intact, and the young mother\r\nstrenuously insisted on her virginity and innocence. About three weeks\r\nafter this remarkable birth Dr. Capers was called to see the infant,\r\nand the grandmother insisted that there was something wrong with the\r\nchild's genitals.  Examination showed a rough, swollen, and sensitive\r\nscrotum, containing some hard substance. He operated, and extracted a\r\nsmashed and battered minie-ball. The doctor, after some meditation,\r\ntheorized in this manner: He concluded that this was the same ball that\r\nhad carried away the testicle of his young friend, that had penetrated\r\nthe ovary of the young lady, and, with some spermatozoa upon it, had\r\nimpregnated her. With this conviction he approached the young man and\r\ntold him the circumstances; the soldier appeared skeptical at first,\r\nbut consented to visit the young mother; a friendship ensued which soon\r\nripened into a happy marriage, and the pair had three children, none\r\nresembling, in the same degree as the first, the heroic pater familias.\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting as are all the anomalies of conception, none are more so\r\nthan those of unconscious impregnation; and some well-authenticated\r\ncases can be mentioned. Instances of violation in sleep, with\r\nsubsequent pregnancy as a result, have been reported in the last\r\ncentury by Valentini, Genselius, and Schurig. Reports by modern\r\nauthorities seem to be quite scarce, though there are several cases on\r\nrecord of rape during anesthesia, followed by impregnation. Capuron\r\nrelates a curious instance of a woman who was raped during lethargy,\r\nand who subsequently became pregnant, though her condition was not\r\nascertained until the fourth month, the peculiar abdominal sensation\r\nexciting suspicion of the true nature of the case, which had previously\r\nbeen thought impossible.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of a case of a young girl of great moral purity who\r\nbecame pregnant without the slightest knowledge of the source;\r\nalthough, it might be remarked, such cases must be taken \"cum grano\r\nsalis.\" Cases of conception without the slightest sexual desire or\r\npleasure, either from fright, as in rape, or naturally deficient\r\nconstitution, have been recorded; as well as conception during\r\nintoxication and in a hypnotic trance, which latter has recently\r\nassumed a much mooted legal aspect. As far back as 1680, Duverney\r\nspeaks of conception without the slightest sense of desire or pleasure\r\non the part of the female.\r\n\r\nConception with Deficient Organs.--Having spoken of conception with\r\nsome obstructive interference, conception with some natural or acquired\r\ndeficiency of the functional, organic, or genital apparatus must be\r\nconsidered. It is a well-known fact that women exhibiting rudimentary\r\ndevelopment of the uterus or vagina are still liable to become\r\npregnant, and many such cases have been recorded; but the most peculiar\r\ncases are those in which pregnancy has appeared after removal of some\r\nof the sexual apparatus.\r\n\r\nPregnancy going to term with a successful delivery frequently follows\r\nthe performance of ovariotomy with astonishing rapidity.  Olier cites\r\nan instance of ovariotomy with a pregnancy of twins three months\r\nafterward, and accouchement at term of two well-developed boys.\r\nPolaillon speaks of a pregnancy consecutive to ovariotomy, the\r\naccouchement being normal at term. Crouch reports a case of successful\r\nparturition in a patient who had previously undergone ovariotomy by a\r\nlarge incision. Parsons mentions a case of twin pregnancy two years\r\nafter ovariotomy attended with abnormal development of one of the\r\nchildren. Cutter speaks of a case in which a woman bore a child one\r\nyear after the performance of ovariotomy, and Pippingskold of two cases\r\nof pregnancy after ovariotomy in which the stump as well as the\r\nremaining ovary were cauterized. Brown relates a similar instance with\r\nsuccessful delivery. Bixby, Harding, Walker (1878-9), and Mears all\r\nreport cases, and others are not at all rare. In the cases following\r\nshortly after operation, it has been suggested that they may be\r\nexplained by the long retention of the ova in the uterus, deposited\r\nthem prior to operation. In the presence of such facts one can but\r\nwonder if artificial fecundation of an ovum derived from another woman\r\nmay ever be brought about in the uterus of a sterile woman!\r\n\r\nConception Soon After a Preceding Pregnancy.--Conception sometimes\r\nfollows birth (or abortion) with astonishing rapidity, and some women\r\nseem for a period of their lives either always pregnant or with infants\r\nat their breasts. This prolificity is often alluded to, and is not\r\nconfined to the lower classes, as often stated, but is common even\r\namong the nobility. Illustrative of this, we have examples in some of\r\nthe reigning families in Europe to-day. A peculiar instance is given by\r\nSparkman in which a woman conceived just forty hours after abortion.\r\nRice mentions the case of a woman who was confined with her first\r\nchild, a boy, on July 31, 1870, and was again delivered of another\r\nchild on June 4, 1871. She had become pregnant twenty-eight days after\r\ndelivery. He also mentions another case of a Mrs. C., who, at the age\r\nof twenty-three, gave birth to a child on September 13, 1880, and bore\r\na second child on July 2, 1881. She must have become pregnant\r\ntwenty-one days after the delivery of her first child.\r\n\r\nSuperfetation has been known for many centuries; the Romans had laws\r\nprescribing the laws of succession in such cases, and many medical\r\nwriters have mentioned it. Hippocrates and Aristotle wrote of it, the\r\nformer at some length. Pliny speaks of a slave who bore two infants,\r\none resembling the master, the other a man with whom she had\r\nintercourse, and cites the case as one of superfetation. Schenck\r\nrelates instances, and Zacchias, Velchius, and Sinibaldus mention\r\neases. Pare seemed to be well conversant with the possibility as well\r\nas the actuality of superfetation; and Harvey reports that a certain\r\nmaid, gotten with child by her master, in order to hide her knavery\r\ncame to London in September, where she lay in by stealth, and being\r\nrecovered, returned home.  In December of the same year she was\r\nunexpectedly delivered of another child, a product of superfetation,\r\nwhich proclaimed the crime that she had so cunningly concealed before.\r\n\r\nMarcellus Donatus, Goret, Schacher, and Mauriceau mention\r\nsuperfetation. In the Academie des Sciences, at Paris, in 1702, there\r\nwas mentioned the case of a woman who was delivered of a boy; in the\r\nplacenta was discovered a sort of bladder which was found to contain a\r\nfemale fetus of the age of from four to five months; and in 1729,\r\nbefore the same society, there was an instance in which two fetuses\r\nwere born a day apart, one aged forty days and the other at full term.\r\nFrom the description, it does not seem possible that either of these\r\nwere blighted twin pregnancies. Ruysch gives an account of a surgeon's\r\nwife at Amsterdam, in 1686, who was delivered of a strong child which\r\nsurvived, and, six hours after, of a small embryo, the funis of which\r\nwas full of hydatids and the placenta as large and thick as one of\r\nthree months. Ruysch accompanies his description with an illustrative\r\nfigure. At Lyons, in 1782, Benoite Franquet was unexpectedly delivered\r\nof a child seven months old; three weeks later she experienced symptoms\r\nindicative of the existence of another fetus, and after five months and\r\nsixteen days she was delivered of a remarkably strong and healthy child.\r\n\r\nBaudeloque speaks of a case of superfetation observed by Desgranges in\r\nLyons in 1780. After the birth of the first infant the lochia failed to\r\nflow, no milk appeared in the breasts, and the belly remained large. In\r\nabout three weeks after the accouchement she had connection with her\r\nhusband, and in a few days felt fetal movements. A second child was\r\nborn at term, sixty-eight days after the first; and in 1782 both\r\nchildren were living. A woman of Arles was delivered on November 11,\r\n1796, of a child at term; she had connection with her husband four days\r\nafter; the lochia stopped, and the milk did not flow after this\r\nintercourse. About one and a half months after this she felt quickening\r\nagain, and naturally supposed that she had become impregnated by the\r\nfirst intercourse after confinement; but five months after the first\r\naccouchement she was delivered of another child at term, the result of\r\na superfetation. Milk in abundance made its appearance, and she was\r\namply able to nourish both children from the breasts. Lachausse speaks\r\nof a woman of thirty who bore one child on April 30, 1748, and another\r\non September 16th in the same year. Her breasts were full enough to\r\nnourish both of the children. It might be remarked in comment on this\r\ncase that, according to a French authority, the woman died in 1755, and\r\non dissection was found to have had a double uterus.\r\n\r\nA peculiar instance of superfetation was reported by Langmore in which\r\nthere was an abortion of a fetus between the third and fourth months,\r\napparently dead some time, and thirteen hours later a second fetus; an\r\novum of about four weeks and of perfect formation was found adherent\r\nnear the fundus. Tyler Smith mentions a lady pregnant for the first\r\ntime who miscarried at five months and some time afterward discharged a\r\nsmall clot containing a perfectly fresh and healthy ovum of about four\r\nweeks' formation. There was no sign of a double uterus, and the patient\r\nmenstruated regularly during pregnancy, being unwell three weeks before\r\nthe abortion. Harley and Tanner speak of a woman of thirty-eight who\r\nnever had borne twins, and who aborted a fetus of four months'\r\ngestation; serious hemorrhage accompanied the removal of the placenta,\r\nand on placing the hand in the uterine cavity an embryo of five or six\r\nweeks was found inclosed in a sac and floating in clear liquor amnii.\r\nThe patient was the mother of nine children, the youngest of which was\r\nthree years old.\r\n\r\nYoung speaks of a woman who three months previously had aborted a three\r\nmonths' fetus, but a tumor still remained in the abdomen, the\r\nauscultation of which gave evidence of a fetal heart-beat.  Vaginal\r\nexamination revealed a dilatation of the os uteri of at least one inch\r\nand a fetal head pressing out; subsequently a living fetus of about six\r\nmonths of age was delivered. Severe hemorrhage complicated the case,\r\nbut was controlled, and convalescence speedily ensued. Huse cites an\r\ninstance of a mother bearing a boy on November 4, 1834, and a girl on\r\nAugust 3, 1835.  At birth the boy looked premature, about seven months\r\nold, which being the case, the girl must have been either a\r\nsuperfetation or a seven months' child also. Van Bibber of Baltimore\r\nsays he met a young lady who was born five months after her sister, and\r\nwho was still living.\r\n\r\nThe most curious and convincing examples of superfetation are those in\r\nwhich children of different colors, either twins or near the same age,\r\nare born to the same woman,--similar to that exemplified in the case of\r\nthe mare who was covered first by a stallion and a quarter of an hour\r\nlater by an ass, and gave birth at one parturition to a horse and a\r\nmule. Parsons speaks of a case at Charleston, S.C., in 1714, of a white\r\nwoman who gave birth to twins, one a mulatto and the other white. She\r\nconfessed that after her husband left her a negro servant came to her\r\nand forced her to comply with his wishes by threatening her life.\r\nSmellie mentions the case of a black woman who had twins, one child\r\nblack and the other almost white. She confessed having had intercourse\r\nwith a white overseer immediately after her husband left her bed.\r\nDewees reports a similar case. Newlin of Nashville speaks of a negress\r\nwho bore twins, one distinctly black with the typical African features,\r\nwhile the other was a pretty mulatto exhibiting the distinct characters\r\nof the Caucasian race. Both the parents were perfect types of the black\r\nAfrican negro. The mother, on being questioned, frankly acknowledged\r\nthat shortly after being with her husband she had lain a night with a\r\nwhite man. In this case each child had its own distinct cord and\r\nplacenta.\r\n\r\nArcher gives facts illustrating and observations showing: \"that a white\r\nwoman, by intercourse with a white man and negro, may conceive twins,\r\none of which shall be white and the other a mulatto; and that, vice\r\nversa, a black woman, by intercourse with a negro and a white man, may\r\nconceive twins, one of which shall be a negro and the other a mulatto.\"\r\nWight narrates that he was called to see a woman, the wife of an East\r\nIndian laborer on the Isle of Trinidad, who had been delivered of a\r\nfetus 6 inches long, about four months old, and having a cord of about\r\n18 inches in length. He removed the placenta, and in about half an hour\r\nthe woman was delivered of a full-term white female child. The first\r\nchild was dark, like the mother and father, and the mother denied any\r\npossibility of its being a white man's child; but this was only natural\r\non her part, as East Indian husbands are so intensely jealous that they\r\nwould even kill an unfaithful wife.  Both the mother and the mysterious\r\nwhite baby are doing well.  Bouillon speaks of a negress in Guadeloupe\r\nwho bore twins, one a negro and the other a mulatto. She had sexual\r\ncongress with both a negro and a white man.\r\n\r\nDelmas, a surgeon of Rouen, tells of a woman of thirty-six who was\r\ndelivered in the hospital of his city on February 26, 1806, of two\r\nchildren, one black and the other a mulatto. She had been pregnant\r\neight months, and had had intercourse with a negro twice about her\r\nfourth month of pregnancy, though living with the white man who first\r\nimpregnated her. Two placentae were expelled some time after the twins,\r\nand showed a membranous junction. The children died shortly after birth.\r\n\r\nPregnancy often takes place in a unicorn or bicorn uterus, leading to\r\nsimilar anomalous conditions. Galle, Hoffman, Massen, and Sanger give\r\ninteresting accounts of this occurrence, and Ross relates an instance\r\nof triple pregnancy in a double uterus.  Cleveland describes a\r\ndischarge of an anomalous deciduous membrane during pregnancy which was\r\nprobably from the unimpregnated half of a double uterus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPRENATAL ANOMALIES.\r\n\r\nExtrauterine Pregnancy.--In the consideration of prenatal anomalies,\r\nthe first to be discussed will be those of extrauterine pregnancy. This\r\nabnormalism has been known almost as long as there has been any real\r\nknowledge of obstetrics. In the writings of Albucasis, during the\r\neleventh century, extrauterine pregnancy is discussed, and later the\r\nworks of N. Polinus and Cordseus, about the sixteenth century, speak of\r\nit; in the case of Cordseus the fetus was converted into a lithopedion\r\nand carried in the abdomen twenty-eight years. Horstius in the\r\nsixteenth century relates the history of a woman who conceived for the\r\nthird time in March, 1547, and in 1563 the remains of the fetus were\r\nstill in the abdomen.\r\n\r\nIsrael Spach, in an extensive gynecologic work published in 1557,\r\nfigures a lithopedion drawn in situ in the case of a woman with her\r\nbelly laid open. He dedicated to this calcified fetus, which he\r\nregarded as a reversion, the following curious epigram, in allusion to\r\nthe classical myth that after the flood the world was repopulated by\r\nthe two survivors, Deucalion and Pyrrha, who walked over the earth and\r\ncast stones behind them, which, on striking the ground, became people.\r\nRoughly translated from the Latin, this epigram read as follows:\r\n\"Deucalion cast stones behind him and thus fashioned our tender race\r\nfrom the hard marble. How comes it that nowadays, by a reversal of\r\nthings, the tender body of a little babe has limbs nearer akin to\r\nstone?\" Many of the older writers mention this form of fetation as a\r\ncuriosity, but offer no explanation as to its cause. Mauriceau and de\r\nGraaf discuss in full extrauterine pregnancy, and Salmuth, Hannseus,\r\nand Bartholinus describe it. From the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury this subject always demanded the attention and interest of\r\nmedical observers. In more modern times, Campbell and\r\nGeoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, who named it \"Grossesse Pathologique,\" have\r\ncarefully defined and classified the forms, and to-day every text-book\r\non obstetrics gives a scientific discussion and classification of the\r\ndifferent forms of extrauterine pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe site of the conception is generally the wall of the uterus, the\r\nFallopian tube, or the ovary, although there are instances of pregnancy\r\nin the vagina, as for example when there is scirrhus of the uterus; and\r\nagain, cases supposed to be only extrauterine have been instances\r\nsimply of double uterus, with single or concurrent pregnancy. Ross\r\nspeaks of a woman of thirty-three who had been married fourteen years,\r\nhad borne six children, and who on July 16, 1870, miscarried with twins\r\nof about five months' development. After a week she declared that she\r\nwas still pregnant with another child, but as the physician had placed\r\nhis hand in the uterine cavity after the abortion, he knew the fetus\r\nmust be elsewhere or that no pregnancy existed. We can readily see how\r\nthis condition might lead to a diagnosis of extrauterine pregnancy, but\r\nas the patient insisted on a thorough examination, the doctor found by\r\nthe stethoscope the presence of a beating fetal heart, and by vaginal\r\nexamination a double uterus. On introducing a sound into the new\r\naperture he discovered that it opened into another cavity; but as the\r\nwoman was pregnant in this, he proceeded no further. On October 31st\r\nshe was delivered of a female child of full growth. She had menstruated\r\nfrom this bipartite uterus three times during the period between the\r\nmiscarriage of the twins and the birth of the child. Both the mother\r\nand child did well.\r\n\r\nIn most cases there is rupture of the fetal sac into the abdominal\r\ncavity or the uterus, and the fetus is ejected into this location, from\r\nthence to be removed or carried therein many years; but there are\r\ninstances in which the conception has been found in situ, as depicted\r\nin Figure 2. A sturdy woman of thirty was executed on January 16, 1735,\r\nfor the murder of her child. It was ascertained that she had passed her\r\ncatamenia about the first of the month, and thereafter had sexual\r\nintercourse with one of her fellow-prisoners. On dissection both\r\nFallopian tubes were found distended, and the left ovary, which bore\r\nsigns of conception, was twice as large as the right. Campbell quotes\r\nanother such case in a woman of thirty-eight who for twenty years had\r\npractised her vocation as a Cyprian, and who unexpectedly conceived. At\r\nthe third month of pregnancy a hard extrauterine tumor was found, which\r\nwas gradually increasing in size and extending to the left side of the\r\nhypogastrium, the associate symptoms of pregnancy, sense of pressure,\r\npain, tormina, and dysuria, being unusually severe. There was\r\nsubsequently at attack of inflammatory fever, followed by tumefaction\r\nof the abdomen, convulsions, and death on the ninth day. The fetus had\r\nbeen contained in the peritoneal coat of the ovary until the fourth\r\nmonth, when one of the feet passed through the cyst and caused the\r\nfatal result. Signs of acute peritonitis were seen postmortem, the\r\nabdominal cavity was full of blood, and the ovary much lacerated.\r\n\r\nThe termination of extrauterine pregnancy varies; in some cases the\r\nfetus is extracted by operation after rupture; in others the fetus has\r\nbeen delivered alive by abdominal section; it may be partially\r\nabsorbed, or carried many years in the abdomen; or it may ulcerate\r\nthrough the confining walls, enter the bowels or bladder, and the\r\nremnants of the fetal body be discharged.\r\n\r\nThe curious cases mentioned by older writers, and called abortion by\r\nthe mouth, etc., are doubtless, in many instances, remnants of\r\nextrauterine pregnancies or dermoid cysts. Maroldus speaks in full of\r\nsuch cases; Bartholinus, Salmuth, and a Reyes speak of women vomiting\r\nremnants of fetuses. In Germany, in the seventeenth century, there\r\nlived a woman who on three different occasions is said to have vomited\r\na fetus. The last miscarriage in this manner was of eight months'\r\ngrowth and was accompanied by its placenta. The older observers thought\r\nthis woman must have had two orifices to her womb, one of which had\r\nsome connection with the stomach, as they had records of the dissection\r\nof a female in whom was found a conformation similar to this.\r\n\r\nDischarge of the fetal bones or even the whole of an extrauterine fetus\r\nby the rectum is not uncommon. There are two early cases mentioned in\r\nwhich the bones of a fetus were discharged at stool, causing intense\r\npain. Armstrong describes an anomalous case of pregnancy in a\r\nsyphilitic patient who discharged fetal bones by the rectum. Bubendorf\r\nreports the spontaneous elimination of a fetal skeleton by the rectum\r\nafter five years of retention, with recovery of the patient. Butcher\r\nspeaks of delivery through the rectum at the fourth month, with\r\nrecovery. Depaul mentions a similar expulsion after a pregnancy of\r\nabout two months and a half. Jackson reports the dissection of an\r\nextrauterine sac which communicated freely with the large intestine.\r\nPeck has an example of spontaneous delivery of an extrauterine fetus by\r\nthe rectum, with recovery of the mother. Skippon, in the early part of\r\nthe last century, reports the discharge of the bones of a fetus through\r\nan \"imposthume\" in the groin. Other cases of anal discharge of the\r\nproduct of extrauterine conception are recorded by Winthrop, Woodbury,\r\nTuttle, Atkinson, Browne, Weinlechner, Gibson, Littre, Magruder,\r\nGilland, and many others. De Brun du Bois-Noir speaks of the expulsion\r\nof extrauterine remains by the anus after seven years, and Heyerdahl\r\nafter thirteen years.  Benham mentions the discharge of a fetus by the\r\nrectum; there was a stricture of the rectum associated with syphilitic\r\npatches, necessitating the performance of colotomy.\r\n\r\nBartholinus and Rosseus speak of fetal bones being discharged from the\r\nurinary passages. Ebersbach, in the Ephemerides of 1717, describes a\r\nnecropsy in which a human fetus was found contained in the bladder. In\r\n1878 White reported an instance of the discharge of fetal remains\r\nthrough the bladder.\r\n\r\nDischarge of the Fetus through the Abdominal Walls.--Margaret Parry of\r\nBerkshire in 1668 voided the bones of a fetus through the flesh above\r\nthe os pubis, and in 1684 she was alive and well, having had healthy\r\nchildren afterward. Brodie reports the history of a case in a negress\r\nwho voided a fetus from an abscess at the navel about the seventeenth\r\nmonth of conception. Modern instances of the discharge of the\r\nextrauterine fetus from the walls of the abdomen are frequently\r\nreported. Algora speaks of an abdominal pregnancy in which there was\r\nspontaneous perforation of the anterior abdominal parietes, followed by\r\ndeath. Bouzal cites an extraordinary case of ectopic gestation in which\r\nthere was natural expulsion of the fetus through abdominal walls, with\r\nsubsequent intestinal strangulation. An artificial anus was established\r\nand the mother recovered. Brodie, Dunglison, Erich, Rodbard, Fox, and\r\nWilson are among others reporting the expulsion of remnants of ectopic\r\npregnancies through the abdominal parietes. Campbell quotes the case of\r\na Polish woman, aged thirty-five, the mother of nine children, most of\r\nwhom were stillborn, who conceived for the tenth time, the gestation\r\nbeing normal up to the lying-in period. She had pains followed by\r\nextraordinary effusion and some blood into the vagina. After various\r\nprotracted complaints the abdominal tumor became painful and inflamed\r\nin the umbilical region. A breach in the walls soon formed, giving exit\r\nto purulent matter and all the bones of a fetus. During this process\r\nthe patient received no medical treatment, and frequently no assistance\r\nin dressing the opening.  She recovered, but had an artificial anus all\r\nher life. Sarah McKinna was married at sixteen and menstruated for the\r\nfirst time a month thereafter. Ten months after marriage she showed\r\nsigns of pregnancy and was delivered at full term of a living child;\r\nthe second child was born ten months after the first, and the second\r\nmonth after the second birth she again showed signs of pregnancy.  At\r\nthe close of nine months these symptoms, with the exception of the\r\nsuppression of menses, subsided, and in this state she continued for\r\nsix years. During the first four years she felt discomfort in the\r\nregion of the umbilicus. About the seventh year she suffered\r\ntumefaction of the abdomen and thought she had conceived again. The\r\nabscess burst and an elbow of the fetus protruded from the wound. A\r\nbutcher enlarged the wound and, fixing his finger under the jaw of the\r\nfetus, extracted the head.  On looking into the abdomen he perceived a\r\nblack object, whereupon he introduced his hand and extracted piecemeal\r\nan entire fetal skeleton and some decomposed animal-matter. The abdomen\r\nwas bound up, and in six weeks the woman was enabled to superintend her\r\ndomestic affairs; excepting a ventral hernia she had no bad\r\nafter-results. Kimura, quoted by Whitney, speaks of a case of\r\nextrauterine pregnancy in a Japanese woman of forty-one similar to the\r\nforegoing, in which an arm protruded through the abdominal wall above\r\nthe umbilicus and the remains of a fetus were removed through the\r\naperture. The accompanying illustration shows the appearance of the arm\r\nin situ before extraction of the fetus and the location of the wound.\r\n\r\nBodinier and Lusk report instances of the delivery of an extrauterine\r\nfetus by the vagina; and Mathieson relates the history of the delivery\r\nof a living ectopic child by the vagina, with recovery of the mother.\r\nGordon speaks of a curious case in a negress, six months pregnant, in\r\nwhich an extrauterine fetus passed down from the posterior culdesac and\r\noccluded the uterus.  It was removed through the vagina, and two days\r\nlater labor-pains set in, and in two hours she was delivered of a\r\nuterine child.  The placenta was left behind and drainage established\r\nthrough the vagina, and the woman made complete recovery.\r\n\r\nCombined Intrauterine and Extrauterine Gestation.--Many\r\nwell-authenticated cases of combined pregnancy, in which one of the\r\nproducts of conception was intrauterine and the other of extrauterine\r\ngestation, have been recorded. Clark and Ramsbotham report instances of\r\ndouble conception, one fetus being born alive in the ordinary manner\r\nand the other located extrauterine.  Chasser speaks of a case in which\r\nthere was concurrent pregnancy in both the uterus and the Fallopian\r\ntube. Smith cites an instance of a woman of twenty-three who became\r\npregnant in August, 1870. In the following December she passed fetal\r\nbones from the rectum, and a month later gave birth to an intrauterine\r\nfetus of six months' growth. McGee mentions the case of a woman of\r\ntwenty-eight who became pregnant in July, 1872, and on October 20th and\r\n21st passed several fetal bones by the rectum, and about four months\r\nlater expelled some from the uterus. From this time she rapidly\r\nrecovered her strength and health. Devergie quotes an instance of a\r\nwoman of thirty who had several children, but who died suddenly, and\r\nbeing pregnant was opened. In the right iliac fossa was found a male\r\nchild weighing 5 pounds and 5 ounces, 8 1/2 inches long, and of about\r\nfive months' growth. The uterus also contained a male fetus of about\r\nthree months' gestation.  Figure 4 shows combined intrauterine and\r\nextrauterine gestation.  Hodgen speaks of a woman of twenty-seven, who\r\nwas regular until November, 1872; early in January, 1873, she had an\r\nattack of pain with peritonitis, shortly after which what was\r\napparently an extrauterine pregnancy gradually diminished. On August\r\n17, 1873, after a labor of eight hours, she gave birth to a healthy\r\nfetus.  The hand in the uterus detected a tumor to the left, which wag\r\nreduced to about one-fourth the former size. In April, 1874, the woman\r\nstill suffered pain and tenderness in the tumor. Hodgen believed this\r\nto have been originally a tubal pregnancy, which burst, causing much\r\nhemorrhage and the death of the fetus, together with a limited\r\nperitonitis. Beach has seen a twin compound pregnancy in which after\r\nconnection there was a miscarriage in six weeks, and four years after\r\ndelivery of an extrauterine fetus through the abdominal walls. Cooke\r\ncites an example of intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy progressing\r\nsimultaneously to full period of gestation, with resultant death.\r\nRosset reports the case of a woman of twenty-seven, who menstruated\r\nlast in November, 1878, and on August 5, 1879, was delivered of a\r\nwell-developed dead female child weighing seven pounds. The uterine\r\ncontractions were feeble, and the attached placenta was removed only\r\nwith difficulty; there was considerable hemorrhage. The hemorrhage\r\ncontinued to occur at intervals of two weeks, and an extrauterine tumor\r\nremained. Two weeks later septicemia supervened and life was despaired\r\nof. On the 15th of October a portion of a fetus of five months' growth\r\nin an advanced stage of decomposition protruded from the vulva. After\r\nthe escape of this putrid mass her health returned, and in four months\r\nshe was again robust and healthy. Whinery speaks of a young woman who\r\nat the time of her second child-birth observed a tumor in the abdomen\r\non her right side and felt motion in it. In about a month she was with\r\nsevere pain which continued a week and then ceased. Health soon\r\nimproved, and the woman afterward gave birth to a third child;\r\nsubsequently she noticed that the tumor had enlarged since the first\r\nbirth, and she had a recurrence of pain and a slight hemorrhage every\r\nthree weeks, and distinctly felt motion in the tumor. This continued\r\nfor eighteen months, when, after a most violent attack of pain, all\r\nmovement ceased, and, as she expressed it, she knew the moment the\r\nchild died. The tumor lost its natural consistence and felt flabby and\r\ndead. An incision was made through the linea alba, and the knife came\r\nin contact with a hard, gritty substance, three or four lines thick.\r\nThe escape of several quarts of dark brown fluid followed the incision,\r\nand the operation had to be discontinued on account of the ensuing\r\nsyncope. About six weeks afterward a bone presented at the orifice,\r\nwhich the woman extracted, and this was soon followed by a mass of\r\nbones, hair, and putrid matter. The discharge was small, and gradually\r\ngrew less in quantity and offensiveness, soon ceasing altogether, and\r\nthe wound closed. By December health was good and the menses had\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nAhlfeld, Ambrosioni, Galabin, Packard, Thiernesse, Maxson, de\r\nBelamizaran, Dibot, and Chabert are among others recording the\r\nphenomenon of coexisting extrauterine and intrauterine pregnancy.\r\nArgles mentions simultaneous extrauterine fetation and superfetation.\r\n\r\nSanger mentions a triple ectopic gestation, in which there was twin\r\npregnancy in the wall of the uterus and a third ovum at the fimbriated\r\nend of the right tube. Careful examination showed this to be a case of\r\nintramural twin pregnancy at the point of entrance of the tube and the\r\nuterus, while at the abdominal end of the same tube there was another\r\novum,--the whole being an example of triple unilateral ectopic\r\ngestation.\r\n\r\nThe instances of delivery of an extrauterine fetus, with viability of\r\nthe child, from the abdomen of the mother would attract attention from\r\ntheir rarity alone, but when coupled with associations of additional\r\ninterest they surely deserve a place in a work of this nature. Osiander\r\nspeaks of an abdominal fetus being taken out alive, and there is a\r\nsimilar case on record in the early part of this century. The London\r\nMedical and Physical Journal, in one of its early numbers, contained an\r\naccount of an abdominal fetus penetrating the walls of the bladder and\r\nbeing extracted from the walls of the hypogastrium; but Sennertus gives\r\na case which far eclipses this, both mother and fetus surviving.  He\r\nsays that in this case the woman, while pregnant, received a blow on\r\nthe lower part of her body, in consequence of which a small tumor\r\nappeared shortly after the accident. It so happened in this case that\r\nthe peritoneum was extremely dilatable, and the uterus, with the child\r\ninside, made its way into the peritoneal sac. In his presence an\r\nincision was made and the fetus taken out alive. Jessop gives an\r\nexample of extrauterine gestation in a woman of twenty-six, who had\r\npreviously had normal delivery. In this case an incision was made and a\r\nfetus of about eight months' growth was found lying loose in the\r\nabdominal cavity in the midst of the intestines. Both the mother and\r\nchild were saved. This is a very rare result. Campbell, in his\r\ncelebrated monograph, in a total of 51 operations had only seen\r\nrecorded the accounts of two children saved, and one of these was too\r\nmarvelous to believe.  Lawson Tait reports a case in which he saved the\r\nchild, but lost the mother on the fourth day. Parvin describes a case\r\nin which death occurred on the third day. Browne quotes Parry as saying\r\nthat there is one twin pregnancy in 23 extrauterine conceptions.  He\r\ngives 24 cases of twin conception, one of which was uterine, the other\r\nextrauterine, and says that of 7 in the third month, with no operation,\r\nthe mother died in 5. Of 6 cases of from four and a half to seven\r\nmonths' duration, 2 lived, and in 1 case at the fifth month there was\r\nan intrauterine fetus delivered which lived. Of 11 such cases at nine\r\nmonths, 6 mothers lived and 6 intrauterine fetuses lived. In 6 of these\r\ncases no operation was performed. In one case the mother died, but both\r\nthe uterine and the extrauterine conceptions lived. In another the\r\nmother and intrauterine fetus died, and the extrauterine fetus lived.\r\nWilson a gives an instance of a woman delivered of a healthy female\r\nchild at eight months which lived. The after-birth came away without\r\nassistance, but the woman still presented every appearance of having\r\nanother child within her, although examination by the vagina revealed\r\nnone. Wilson called Chatard in consultation, and from the fetal\r\nheart-sounds and other symptoms they decided that there was another\r\npregnancy wholly extrauterine. They allowed the case to go twenty-three\r\ndays, until pains similar to those of labor occurred, and then decided\r\non celiotomy. The operation was almost bloodless, and a living child\r\nweighing eight pounds was extracted. Unfortunately, the mother\r\nsuccumbed after ninety hours, and in a month the intrauterine child\r\ndied from inanition, but the child of extrauterine gestation thrived.\r\nSales gives the case of a negress of twenty-two, who said that she had\r\nbeen \"tricked by a negro,\" and had a large snake in the abdomen, and\r\ncould distinctly feel its movements. She stoutly denied any\r\nintercourse. It was decided to open the abdominal cyst; the incision\r\nwas followed by a gush of blood and a placenta came into view, which\r\nwas extracted with a living child. To the astonishment of the operators\r\nthe uterus was distended, and it was decided to open it, when another\r\nliving child was seen and extracted. The cyst and the uterus were\r\ncleansed of all clots and the wound closed. The mother died of\r\nsepticemia, but the children both lived and were doing well six weeks\r\nafter the operation. A curious case was seen in 1814 of a woman who at\r\nher fifth gestation suffered abdominal uneasiness at the third month,\r\nand this became intolerable at the ninth month.  The head of the fetus\r\ncould be felt through the abdomen; an incision was made through the\r\nparietes; a fully developed female child was delivered, but,\r\nunfortunately, the mother died of septic infection.\r\n\r\nThe British Medical Journal quotes: \"Pinard (Bull. de l'Acad. de Med.,\r\nAugust 6, 1895) records the following, which he describes as an ideal\r\ncase. The patient was aged thirty-six, had had no illness, and had been\r\nregular from the age of fourteen till July, 1894. During August of that\r\nyear she had nausea and vomiting; on the 22d and 23d she lost a fluid,\r\nwhich was just pink. The symptoms continued during September, on the\r\n22d and 23d of which month there was a similar loss. In October she was\r\nkept in bed for two days by abdominal pain, which reappeared in\r\nNovember, and was then associated with pain in micturition and\r\ndefecation. From that time till February 26, 1895, when she came under\r\nPinard's care, she was attended by several doctors, each of whom\r\nadopted a different diagnosis and treatment. One of them, thinking she\r\nhad a fibroid, made her take in all about an ounce of savin powder,\r\nwhich did not, however, produce any ill effect. When admitted she\r\nlooked ill and pinched. The left thigh and leg were painful and\r\nedematous. The abdomen looked like that of the sixth month of\r\npregnancy. The abdominal wall was tense, smooth, and without lineae\r\nalbicantes. Palpation revealed a cystic immobile tumor, extending 2\r\ninches above the umbilicus and apparently fixed by deep adhesions. The\r\nfetal parts could only be made out with difficulty by deep palpation,\r\nbut the heart-sounds were easily heard to the right of and below the\r\numbilicus. By the right side of this tumor one could feel a small one,\r\nthe size of a Tangerine orange, which hardened and softened under\r\nexamination. When contracted the groove between it and the large tumor\r\nbecame evident. Vaginal examination showed that the cervix, which was\r\nslightly deflected forward and to the right and softened, as in uterine\r\ngestation, was continuous with the smaller tumor.  Cephalic\r\nballottement was obtained in the large tumor. No sound was passed into\r\nthe uterus for fear of setting up reflex action; the diagnosis of\r\nextrauterine gestation at about six and a half months with a living\r\nchild was established without requiring to be clinched by proving the\r\nuterus empty. The patient was kept absolutely at rest in bed and the\r\nedema of the left leg cured by position. On April 30th the fundus of\r\nthe tumor was 35 cm. above the symphysis and the uterus 11 1/2 cm.; the\r\ncervix was soft as that of a primipara at term. Operation, May 2d:\r\nUterus found empty, cavity 14 1/2 cm. long. Median incision in\r\nabdominal wall; cyst walls exposed; seen to be very slight and filled\r\nwith enormous vessels, some greater than the little finger. On seizing\r\nthe wall one of these vessels burst, and the hemorrhage was only\r\nrendered greater on attempting to secure it, so great was the\r\nfriability of the walls. The cyst was therefore rapidly opened and the\r\nchild extracted by the foot. Hemorrhage was restrained first by\r\npressure of the hands, then by pressure-forceps and ligatures. The\r\nwalls of the cyst were sewn to the margins of the abdominal wound, the\r\nedge of the placenta being included in the suture. A wound was thus\r\nformed 10 cm. in diameter, with the placenta for its base; it was\r\nfilled with iodoform and salicylic gauze. The operation lasted an hour,\r\nand the child, a boy weighing 5 1/2 pounds, after a brief period of\r\nrespiratory difficulties, was perfectly vigorous. There was at first a\r\nslight facial asymmetry and a depression on the left upper jaw caused\r\nby the point of the left shoulder, against which it had been pressed in\r\nthe cyst; these soon disappeared, and on the nineteenth day the boy\r\nweighed 12 pounds. The maternal wound was not dressed till May 13th,\r\nwhen it was washed with biniodid, 1:4000. The placenta came away\r\npiecemeal between May 25th and June 2d. The wound healed up, and the\r\npatient got up on the forty-third day, having suckled her infant from\r\nthe first day after its birth.\"\r\n\r\nQuite recently Werder has investigated the question of the ultimate\r\nfate of ectopic children delivered alive. He has been able to obtain\r\nthe record of 40 cases. Of these, 18 died within a week after birth; 5\r\nwithin a month; 1 died at six months of bronchopneumonia; 1 at seven\r\nmonths of diarrhea; 2 at eleven months, 1 from croup; 1 at eighteen\r\nmonths from cholera infantum--making a total of 26 deaths and leaving\r\n14 children to be accounted for. Of these, 5 were reported as living\r\nand well after operation, with no subsequent report; 1 was strong and\r\nhealthy after three weeks, but there has been no report since; 1 was\r\nwell at six months, then was lost sight of; 1 was well at the Last\r\nreport; 2 live and are well at one year; 2 are living and well at two\r\nyears; 1 (Beisone's case) is well at seven years; and 1 (Tait's case)\r\nis well at fourteen and one-half years. The list given on pages 60 and\r\n61 has been quoted by Hirst and Dorland. It contains data relative to\r\n17 cases in which abdominal section has been successfully performed for\r\nadvanced ectopic gestation with living children.\r\n\r\nLong Retention of Extrauterine Pregnancy.--The time of the retention of\r\nan extrauterine gestation is sometimes remarkable, and it is no\r\nuncommon occurrence for several pregnancies to successfully ensue\r\nduring such retention. The Ephemerides contains examples of\r\nextrauterine pregnancy remaining in the abdomen forty-six years;\r\nHannaeus mentioned an instance remaining ten years, the mother being\r\npregnant in the meantime; Primperosius speaks of a similar instance; de\r\nBlegny, one of twenty-five years in the abdomen; Birch, a case of\r\neighteen years in the abdomen, the woman bearing in the meantime;\r\nBayle, one of twenty-six years, and the Ephemerides, another. In a\r\nwoman of forty-six, the labor pains intervened without expulsion of the\r\nfetus. Impregnation ensued twice afterward, each followed by the birth\r\nof a living child. The woman lived to be ninety-four, and was persuaded\r\nthat the fetus was still in the abdomen, and directed a postmortem\r\nexamination to be made after her decease, which was done, and a large\r\ncyst containing an ossified fetus was discovered in the left side of\r\nthe cavity. In 1716 a woman of Joigny when thirty years old, having\r\nbeen married four years, became pregnant, and three months later felt\r\nmovements and found milk in her breasts. At the ninth month she had\r\nlabor-pains, but the fetus failed to present; the pains ceased, but\r\nrecurred in a month, still with a negative result. She fell into a most\r\nsickly condition and remained so for eighteen months, when the pains\r\nreturned again, but soon ceased. Menstruation ceased and the milk in\r\nher breasts remained for thirty years. She died at sixty-one of\r\nperipneumonia, and on postmortem examination a tumor was found\r\noccupying part of the hypogastric and umbilical regions. It weighed\r\neight pounds and consisted of a male fetus of full term with six teeth;\r\nit had no odor and its sac contained no liquid.  The bones seemed\r\nbetter developed than ordinarily; the skin was thick, callous, and\r\nyellowish The chorion, amnion, and placenta were ossified and the cord\r\ndried up. Walther mentions the case of an infant which remained almost\r\npetrified in the belly of its mother for twenty-three years. No trace\r\nof the placenta, cord, or enveloping membrane could be found.\r\n\r\nCordier publishes a paper on ectopic gestation, with particular\r\nreference to tubal pregnancy, and mentions that when there is rupture\r\nbetween the broad ligaments hemorrhage is greatly limited by the\r\nresistance of the surrounding structures, death rarely resulting from\r\nthe primary rupture in this location. Cordier gives an instance in\r\nwhich he successfully removed a full-grown child, the result of an\r\nectopic gestation which had ruptured intraligamentally and had been\r\nretained nearly two years.\r\n\r\nLospichlerus gives an account of a mother carrying twins, extrauterine,\r\nfor six years. Mounsey of Riga, physician to the army of the Czarina,\r\nsent to the Royal Society in 1748 the bones of a fetus that had been\r\nextracted from one of the fallopian tubes after a lodgment of thirteen\r\nyears. Starkey Middleton read the report of a case of a child which had\r\nbeen taken out of the abdomen, having lain there nearly sixteen years,\r\nduring which time the mother had borne four children. It was argued at\r\nthis time that boys were conceived on the right side and girls on the\r\nleft, and in commenting on this Middleton remarks that in this case the\r\nwoman had three boys and one girl after the right fallopian tube had\r\nlost its function. Chester cites the instance of a fetus being retained\r\nfifty-two years, the mother not dying until her eightieth year.\r\nMargaret Mathew carried a child weighing eight pounds in her abdomen\r\nfor twenty-six years, and which after death was extracted. Aubrey\r\nspeaks of a woman aged seventy years unconsciously carrying an\r\nextrauterine fetus for many years, which was only discovered\r\npostmortem. She had ceased to menstruate at forty and had borne a child\r\nat twenty-seven.  Watkins speaks of a fetus being retained forty-three\r\nyears; James, others for twenty-five, thirty, forty-six, and fifty\r\nyears; Murfee, fifty-five years; Cunningham, forty years; Johnson,\r\nforty-four years; Josephi, fifteen years (in the urinary bladder);\r\nCraddock, twenty-two years, and da Costa Simoes, twenty-six years.\r\n\r\nLong Retention of Uterine Pregnancy.--Cases of long retained\r\nintrauterine pregnancies are on record and deserve as much\r\nconsideration as those that were extrauterine. Albosius speaks of a\r\nmother carrying a child in an ossified condition in the uterus for\r\ntwenty-eight years. Cheselden speaks of a case in which a child was\r\ncarried many years in the uterus, being converted into a clay-like\r\nsubstance, but preserving form and outline. Caldwell mentions the case\r\nof a woman who carried an ossified fetus in her uterus for sixty years.\r\nCamerer describes the retention of a fetus in the uterus for forty-six\r\nyears; Stengel, one for ten years, and Storer and Buzzell, for\r\ntwenty-two months. Hannaeus, in 1686, issued a paper on such a case\r\nunder the title, \"Mater, Infantis Mortui Vivum Sepulchrum,\" which may\r\nbe found in French translation.\r\n\r\nBuchner speaks of a fetus being retained in the uterus for six years,\r\nand Horstius relates a similar case. Schmidt's Jahrbucher contain the\r\nreport of a woman of forty-nine, who had borne two children. While\r\nthreshing corn she felt violent pain like that of labor, and after an\r\nillness suffered a constant fetid discharge from the vagina for eleven\r\nyears, fetal bones being discharged with occasional pain. This poor\r\ncreature worked along for eleven years, at the end of which time she\r\nwas forced to bed, and died of symptoms of purulent peritonitis. At the\r\nnecropsy the uterus was found adherent to the anterior wall of the\r\nabdomen and containing remnants of a putrid fetus with its numerous\r\nbones.  There is an instance recorded of the death of a fetus occurring\r\nnear term, its retention and subsequent discharge being through a\r\nspontaneous opening in the abdominal wall one or two months after.\r\n\r\nMeigs cites the case of a woman who dated her pregnancy from March,\r\n1848, and which proceeded normally for nine months, but no labor\r\nsupervened at this time and the menses reappeared. In March, 1849, she\r\npassed a few fetal bones by the rectum, and in May, 1855, she died. At\r\nthe necropsy the uterus was found to contain the remains of a fully\r\ndeveloped fetus, minus the portions discharged through a fistulous\r\nconnection between the uterine cavity and the rectum. In this case\r\nthere had been retention of a fully developed fetus for nine years. Cox\r\ndescribes the case of a woman who was pregnant seven months, and who\r\nwas seized with convulsions; the supposed labor-pains passed off, and\r\nafter death the fetus was found in the womb, having lain there for five\r\nyears. She had an early return of the menses, and these recurred\r\nregularly for four years. Dewees quotes two cases, in one of which the\r\nchild was carried twenty months in the uterus; in the other, the mother\r\nwas still living two years and five months after fecundation. Another\r\ncase was in a woman of sixty, who had conceived at twenty-six, and\r\nwhose fetus was found, partly ossified, in the uterus after death.\r\n\r\nThere are many narratives of the long continuation of fetal movements,\r\nand during recent years, in the Southern States, there was quite a\r\nprevalence of this kind of imposters. Many instances of the exhibition\r\nof fetal movements in the bellies of old negro women have been noticed\r\nby the lay journals, but investigation proves them to have been nothing\r\nmore than an exceptional control over the abdominal muscles, with the\r\nability to simulate at will the supposed fetal jerks. One old woman\r\nwent so far as to show the fetus dancing to the music of a banjo with\r\nrhythmical movements. Such imposters flourished best in the regions\r\ngiven to \"voodooism.\" We can readily believe how easy the deception\r\nmight be when we recall the exact simulation of the fetal movements in\r\ninstances of pseudocyesis.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary diversity of reports concerning the duration of\r\npregnancy has made this a much mooted question. Many opinions relative\r\nto the longest and shortest period of pregnancy, associated with\r\nviability of the issue, have been expressed by authors on medical\r\njurisprudence. There is perhaps no information more unsatisfactory or\r\nuncertain. Mistakes are so easily made in the date of the occurrence of\r\npregnancy, or in the date of conception, that in the remarkable cases\r\nwe can hardly accept the propositions as worthy evidence unless\r\nassociated with other and more convincing facts, such as the appearance\r\nand stage of development of the fetus, or circumstances making\r\nconception impossible before or after the time mentioned, etc. It will\r\nbe our endeavor to cite the more seemingly reliable instances of the\r\nanomalies of the time or duration of pregnancy reported in reputable\r\nperiodicals or books.\r\n\r\nShort Pregnancies.--Hasenet speaks of the possibility of a living birth\r\nat four months; Capuron relates the instance of Fortunio Liceti, who\r\nwas said to have been born at the end of four and a half months and\r\nlived to complete his twenty-fourth year. In the case of the Marechal\r\nde Richelieu, the Parliament of Paris decreed that an infant of five\r\nmonths possessed that capability of living the ordinary period of\r\nexistence, i.e., the \"viabilite,\" which the law of France requires for\r\nthe establishment of inheritance. In his seventh book Pliny gives\r\nexamples of men who were born out of time. Jonston gives instances of\r\nbirths at five, six, seven, and eight months. Bonnar quotes 5 living\r\nbirths before the one hundred and fiftieth day; 1 of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five days; 1 of one hundred and twenty days; 1 of one hundred\r\nand thirty-three days, surviving to twenty-one months; and 1 of one\r\nhundred and thirty-five days' pregnancy surviving to eighty years.\r\nMaisonneuve describes a case in which abortion took place at four and a\r\nhalf months; he found the fetus in its membranes two hours after\r\ndelivery, and, on laying the membranes open, saw that it was living. He\r\napplied warmth, and partly succeeded in restoring it; for a few minutes\r\nrespiratory movements were performed regularly, but it died in six\r\nhours. Taylor quotes Carter concerning the case of a fetus of five\r\nmonths which cried directly after it was born, and in the half hour it\r\nlived it tried frequently to breathe. He also quotes Davies, mentioning\r\nan instance of a fetus of five months, which lived twelve hours,\r\nweighing 2 pounds, and measuring 12 inches, and which cried vigorously.\r\nThe pupillary membrane was entire, the testes had not descended, and\r\nthe head was well covered with hair. Usher speaks of a woman who in\r\n1876 was delivered of 2 male children on the one hundred and\r\nthirty-ninth day; both lived for an hour; the first weighed 10 ounces 6\r\ndrams and measured 9 3/4 inches; the other 10 ounces 7 drams, with the\r\nsame length as the first. Routh speaks of a Mrs. F----, aged\r\nthirty-eight, who had borne 9 children and had had 3 miscarriages, the\r\nlast conception terminating as such. Her husband was away, and returned\r\nOctober 9, 1869. She did not again see her husband until the 3d or 4th\r\nof January. The date of quickening was not observed, and the child was\r\nborn June 8, 1870. During gestation she was much frightened by a rat.\r\nThe child was weak, the testes undescended, and it lived but eighteen\r\ndays, dying of symptoms of atrophy. The parents were poor, of excellent\r\ncharacter, and although, according to the evidence, this pregnancy\r\nlasted but twenty-two weeks and two days, there was absolutely no\r\nreason to suspect infidelity.\r\n\r\nRuttel speaks of a child of five months who lived twenty-four hours;\r\nand he saw male twins born at the sixth month weighing 3 pounds each\r\nwho were alive and healthy a year after. Barker cites the case of a\r\nfemale child born on the one hundred and fifty-eighth day that weighed\r\n1 pound and was 11 inches long. It had rudimentary nails, very little\r\nhair on the head, its eyelids were closed, and the skin much shriveled;\r\nit did not suckle properly, and did not walk until nineteen months old.\r\nThree and a half years after, the child was healthy and thriving, but\r\nweighed only 29 1/2 pounds. At the time of birth it was wrapped up in a\r\nbox and placed before the fire. Brouzet speaks of living births of from\r\nfive to six months' pregnancy, and Kopp speaks of a six months' child\r\nwhich lived four days. The Ephemerides contains accounts of living\r\npremature births.\r\n\r\nNewinton describes a pregnancy of five months terminating with the\r\nbirth of twins, one of whom lived twenty minutes and the other fifteen.\r\nThe first was 11 1/2 inches long, and weighed 1 pound 3 1/2 ounces, and\r\nthe other was 11 inches long, and weighed 1 pound. There is a recent\r\ninstance of premature birth following a pregnancy of between five and a\r\nhalf and six months, the infant weighing 955 grams. One month after\r\nbirth, through the good offices of the wet-nurse and M. Villemin, who\r\nattended the child and who invented a \"couveuse\" for the occasion, it\r\nmeasured 38 cm. long.\r\n\r\nMoore is accredited with the trustworthy report of the case of a woman\r\nwho bore a child at the end of the fifth month weighing 1 1/2 pounds\r\nand measuring 9 inches. It was first nourished by dropping liquid food\r\ninto its mouth; and at the age of fifteen months it was healthy and\r\nweighed 18 pounds. Eikam saw a case of abortion at the fifth month in\r\nwhich the fetus was 6 inches in length and weighed about 8 ounces. The\r\nhead was sufficiently developed and the cranial bones considerably\r\nadvanced in ossification. He tied the cord and placed the fetus in warm\r\nwater. It drew up its feet and arms and turned its head from one side\r\nto the other, opening its mouth and trying to breathe. It continued in\r\nthis wise for an hour, the action of the heart being visible ten\r\nminutes after the movements ceased. From its imperfectly developed\r\ngenitals it was supposed to have been a female. Professor J. Muller, to\r\nwhom it was shown, said that it was not more than four months old, and\r\nthis coincided with the mother's calculation.\r\n\r\nVillemin before the Societe Obstetricale et Gynecologique reported the\r\ncase of a two-year-old child, born in the sixth month of pregnancy.\r\nThat the child had not had six months of intrauterine life he could\r\nvouch, the statement being borne out by the last menstrual period of\r\nthe mother, the date of the first fetal movements, the child's weight,\r\nwhich was 30 1/2 ounces, and its appearance. Budin had had this infant\r\nunder observation from the beginning and corroborated Villemin's\r\nstatements. He had examined infants of six or seven months that had\r\ncried and lived a few days, and had found the alveolar cavities filled\r\nwith epithelial cells, the lung sinking when placed in a vessel of\r\nwater. Charpentier reported a case of premature birth in his practice,\r\nthe child being not more than six and a half months and weighing 33 1/2\r\nounces. So sure was he that it would not live that he placed it in a\r\nbasin while he attended to the mother.  After this had been done, the\r\nchild being still alive, he wrapped it in cotton and was surprised next\r\nday to find it alive. It was then placed in a small, well-heated room\r\nand fed with a spoon on human milk; on the twelfth day it could take\r\nthe breast, since which time it thrived and grew.\r\n\r\nThere is a case on record of a child viable at six months and twenty\r\ndays. The mother had a miscarriage at the beginning of 1877, after\r\nwhich menstruation became regular, appearing last from July 3 to 9,\r\n1877. On January 28, 1878, she gave birth to a male infant, which was\r\nwrapped in wadding and kept at an artificial temperature. Being unable\r\nto suckle, it was fed first on diluted cow's milk. It was so small at\r\nbirth that the father passed his ring over the foot almost to the knee.\r\nOn the thirteenth day it weighed 1250 grams, and at the end of a week\r\nit was taking the breast. In December, 1879, it had 16 teeth, weighed\r\n10 kilograms, walked with agility, could pronounce some words, and was\r\nespecially intelligent. Capuron relates an instance of a child born\r\nafter a pregnancy of six and a half months and in excellent health at\r\ntwo years, and another living at ten years of the same age at birth.\r\nTait speaks of a living female child, born on the one hundred and\r\nseventy-ninth day, with no nails on its fingers or toes, no hair, the\r\nextremities imperfectly developed, and the skin florid and thin. It was\r\ntoo feeble to grasp its mother's nipple, and was fed for three weeks by\r\nmilk from the breast through a quill. At forty days it weighed 3 pounds\r\nand measured 13 inches. Before the expiration of three months it died\r\nof measles. Dodd describes a case in which the catamenia were on the\r\n24th of June, 1838, and continued a week; the woman bore twins on\r\nJanuary 11, 1839, one of which survived, the other dying a few minutes\r\nafter birth. She was never irregular, prompt to the hour, and this\r\nfact, coupled with the diminutive size of the children, seemed to\r\nverify the duration of the pregnancy. In 1825, Baber of Buxur, India,\r\nspoke of a child born at six and a half months, who at the age of fifty\r\ndays weighed 1 pound and 13 ounces and was 14 inches long. The longest\r\ncircumference of the head was 10 inches and the shortest 9.1 inches.\r\nThe child suckled freely and readily. In Spaeth's clinic there was a\r\nviable infant at six and a half months weighing 900 grams. Spaeth says\r\nthat he has known a child of six months to surpass in eventual\r\ndevelopment its brothers born at full term.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there seems to be a peculiarity in women which manifests\r\nitself by regular premature births. La Motte, van Swieten, and Fordere\r\nmention females who always brought forth their conceptions at the\r\nseventh month.\r\n\r\nThe incubator seems destined to be the future means of preserving these\r\npremature births. Several successful cases have been noticed, and by\r\nmeans of an incubator Tarnier succeeded in raising infants which at the\r\nage of six months were above the average. A full description of the\r\nincubator may be found. The modified Auvard incubator is easily made;\r\nthe accompanying illustrations (Figs. 5, 6, and 7) explain its\r\nmechanism. Several improved incubators have been described in recent\r\nyears, but the Auvard appears to be the most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe question of retardation of labor, like that of premature birth, is\r\nopen to much discussion, and authorities differ as to the limit of\r\nprotraction with viability. Aulus Gellius says that, after a long\r\nconversation with the physicians and wise men, the Emperor Adrian\r\ndecided in a case before him, that of a woman of chaste manners and\r\nirreproachable character, the child born eleven months after her\r\nhusband's death was legitimate. Under the Roman law the Decenviri\r\nestablished that a woman may bear a viable child at the tenth month of\r\npregnancy. Paulus Zacchias, physician to Pope Innocent X, declared that\r\nbirth may be retarded to the tenth month, and sometimes to a longer\r\nperiod. A case was decided in the Supreme Court of Friesland, a\r\nprovince in the northern part of the Netherlands, October, 1634, in\r\nwhich a child born three hundred and thirty-three days after the death\r\nof the husband was pronounced legitimate. The Parliament of Paris was\r\ngallant enough to come to the rescue of a widow and save her reputation\r\nby declaring that a child born after a fourteen months' gestation was\r\nlegitimate. Bartholinus speaks of an unmarried woman of Leipzig who was\r\ndelivered after a pregnancy of sixteen months. The civil code of France\r\nprovides that three hundred days shall constitute the longest period of\r\nthe legitimacy of an infant; the Scottish law, three hundred days; and\r\nthe Prussian law, three hundred and one days.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous cases recorded by the older writers. Amman has one\r\nof twelve months' duration; Enguin, one of twelve months'; Buchner, a\r\ncase of twelve months'; Benedictus, one of fourteen months'; de Blegny,\r\none of nineteen months'; Marteau, Osiander, and others of forty-two and\r\nforty-four weeks'; and Stark's Archives, one of forty-five weeks',\r\nliving, and also another case of forty-four weeks'. An incredible case\r\nis recorded of an infant which lived after a three years' gestation.\r\nInstances of twelve months' duration are also recorded. Jonston quotes\r\nPaschal in relating an instance of birth after pregnancy of\r\ntwenty-three months; Aventium, one after two years; and Mercurialis, a\r\nbirth after a four years' gestation--which is, of course, beyond belief.\r\n\r\nThormeau writes from Tours, 1580, of a case of gestation prolonged to\r\nthe twenty-third month, and Santorini, at Venice, in 1721, describes a\r\nsimilar case, the child reaching adult life.  Elvert records a case of\r\nlate pregnancy, and Henschel one of forty-six weeks, but the fetus was\r\ndead. Schneider cites an instance of three hundred and eight days'\r\nduration. Campbell says that Simpson had cases of three hundred and\r\nnineteen, three hundred and thirty-two, and three hundred and\r\nthirty-six days'; Meigs had one of four hundred and twenty. James Reid,\r\nin a table of 500 mature births, gives 14 as being from three hundred\r\nand two to three hundred and fifteen days'.\r\n\r\nNot so long ago a jury rendered a verdict of guilty of fornication and\r\nbastardy when it was alleged that the child was born three hundred and\r\nseventeen days after intercourse. Taylor relates a case of pregnancy in\r\nwhich the wife of a laborer went to America three hundred and\r\ntwenty-two days before the birth.  Jaffe describes an instance of the\r\nprolongation of pregnancy for three hundred and sixty-five days, in\r\nwhich the developments and measurements corresponded to the length of\r\nprotraction. Bryan speaks of a woman of twenty-five who became pregnant\r\non February 10, 1876, and on June 17th felt motion. On July 28th she\r\nwas threatened with miscarriage, and by his advice the woman weaned the\r\nchild at the breast. She expected to be confined the middle of\r\nNovember, 1876, but the expected event did not occur until April 26,\r\n1877, nine months after the quickening and four hundred and forty days\r\nfrom the time of conception. The boy was active and weighed nine\r\npounds. The author cites Meigs' case, and also one of Atlee's, at three\r\nhundred and fifty-six days.\r\n\r\nTalcott, Superintendent of the State Homeopathic Asylum for the Insane,\r\nexplained the pregnancy of an inmate who had been confined for four\r\nyears in this institution as one of protracted labor. He said that many\r\nsuch cases have been reported, and that something less than two years\r\nbefore he had charge of a case in which the child was born. He made the\r\nreport to the New York Senate Commission on Asylums for the Insane as\r\none of three years' protraction. Tidd speaks of a woman who was\r\ndelivered of a male child at term, and again in ten months delivered of\r\na well-developed male child weighing 7 1/4 pounds; he relates the\r\nhistory of another case, in Clifton, W. Va., of a woman expecting\r\nconfinement on June 1st going over to September 16th, the fetus being\r\nin the uterus over twelve months, and nine months after quickening was\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nTwo extraordinary cases are mentioned, one in a woman of thirty-five,\r\nwho expected to be confined April 24, 1883. In May she had a few\r\nlabor-pains that passed away, and during the next six months she\r\nremained about as large as usual, and was several times thought to be\r\nin the early stages of labor. In September the os dilated until the\r\nfirst and second fingers could be passed directly to the head. This\r\ncondition lasted about a month, but passed away. At times during the\r\nlast nine months of pregnancy she was almost unable to endure the\r\nmovements of the child.  Finally, on the morning of November 6th, after\r\na pregnancy of four hundred and seventy-six days, she was delivered of\r\na male child weighing 13 pounds. Both the mother and child did well\r\ndespite the use of chloroform and forceps. The other case was one\r\nlasting sixteen months and twenty days.\r\n\r\nIn a rather loose argument, Carey reckons a case of three hundred and\r\nfifty days. Menzie gives an instance in a woman aged twenty-eight, the\r\nmother of one child, in whom a gestation was prolonged to the\r\nseventeenth month. The pregnancy was complicated by carcinoma of the\r\nuterus. Ballard describes the case of a girl of sixteen years and six\r\nmonths, whose pregnancy, the result of a single intercourse, lasted\r\nthree hundred and sixty days. Her labor was short and easy for a\r\nprimipara, and the child was of the average size. Mackenzie cites the\r\ninstance of a woman aged thirty-two, a primipara, who had been married\r\nten years and who always had been regular in menstruation. The menses\r\nceased on April 28, 1888, and she felt the child for the first time in\r\nSeptember. She had false pains in January, 1889, and labor did not\r\nbegin until March 8th, lasting sixty-six hours. If all these statements\r\nare correct, the probable duration of this pregnancy was eleven months\r\nand ten days.\r\n\r\nLundie relates an example of protracted gestation of eleven months, in\r\nwhich an anencephalous fetus was born; and Martin of Birmingham\r\ndescribes a similar case of ten and a half months' duration.\r\nRaux-Tripier has seen protraction to the thirteenth month. Enguin\r\nreports an observation of an accouchement of twins after a pregnancy\r\nthat had been prolonged for eleven months.  Resnikoff mentions a\r\npregnancy of eleven months' duration in an anemic secundipara. The case\r\nhad been under his observation from the beginning of pregnancy; the\r\npatient would not submit to artificial termination at term, which he\r\nadvised. After a painful labor of twenty-four hours a macerated and\r\ndecomposed child was born, together with a closely-adherent placenta.\r\nTarnier reports an instance of partus serotinus in which the product of\r\nconception was carried in the uterus forty days after term. The fetus\r\nwas macerated but not putrid, and the placenta had undergone fatty\r\ndegeneration. At a recent meeting of the Chicago Gynecological Society,\r\nDr. F. A. Stahl reported the case of a German-Bohemian woman in which\r\nthe fifth pregnancy terminated three hundred and two days after the\r\nlast menstruation. Twenty days before there had occurred pains similar\r\nto those of labor, but they gradually ceased. The sacral promontory was\r\nexaggerated, and the anteroposterior pelvic diameter of the inlet in\r\nconsequence diminished. The fetus was large and occupied the first\r\nposition. Version was with difficulty effected and the passage of the\r\nafter-coming head through the superior strait required expression and\r\ntraction, during which the child died.  The mother suffered a deep\r\nlaceration of the perineum involving an inch of the wall of the rectum.\r\n\r\nAmong others reporting instances of protracted pregnancy are Collins,\r\neleven months; Desbrest, eighteen months; Henderson, fifteen months;\r\nJefferies, three hundred and fifty-eight days, and De la Vergne gives\r\nthe history of a woman who carried an infant in her womb for\r\ntwenty-nine months; this case may possibly belong under the head of\r\nfetus long retained in the uterus.\r\n\r\nUnconscious Pregnancy.--There are numerous instances of women who have\r\nhad experience in pregnancy unconsciously going almost to the moment of\r\ndelivery, yet experiencing none of the usual accompanying symptoms of\r\nthis condition. Crowell speaks of a woman of good social position who\r\nhad been married seven years, and who had made extensive preparations\r\nfor a long journey, when she was seized with a \"bilious colic,\" and, to\r\nher dismay and surprise, a child was born before the arrival of the\r\ndoctor summoned on account of her sudden colic and her inability to\r\nretain her water. A peculiar feature of this case was the fact that\r\nmental disturbance set in immediately afterward, and the mother became\r\nmorbid and had to be removed to an asylum, but recovered in a few\r\nmonths. Tanner saw a woman of forty-two who had been suffering with\r\nabdominal pains. She had been married three years and had never been\r\npregnant. Her catamenia were very scant, but this was attributed to her\r\nchange of life. She had conceived, had gone to the full term of\r\ngestation, and was in labor ten hours without any suspicion of\r\npregnancy. She was successfully delivered of a girl, which occasioned\r\nmuch rejoicing in the household.\r\n\r\nTasker of Kendall's Mills, Me., reports the case of a young married\r\nwoman calling him for bilious colic. He found the stomach slightly\r\ndistended and questioned her about the possibility of pregnancy. Both\r\nshe and her husband informed him that such could not be the case, as\r\nher courses had been regular and her waist not enlarged, as she had\r\nworn a certain corset all the time.  There were no signs of quickening,\r\nno change in the breasts, and, in fact, none of the usual signs of\r\npregnancy present. He gave her an opiate, and to her surprise, in about\r\nsix hours she was the mother of a boy weighing five pounds. Both the\r\nmother and child made a good recovery. Duke cites the instance of a\r\nwoman who supposed that she was not pregnant up to the night of her\r\nmiscarriage. She had menstruated and was suckling a child sixteen\r\nmonths old. During the night she was attacked with pains resembling\r\nthose of labor and a fetus slipped into the vagina without any\r\nhemorrhage; the placenta came away directly afterward. In this peculiar\r\ncase the woman was menstruating regularly, suckling a child, and at the\r\nsame time was unconsciously pregnant.\r\n\r\nIsham speaks of a case of unconscious pregnancy in which extremely\r\nsmall twins were delivered at the eighth month. Fox cites an instance\r\nof a woman who had borne eight children, and yet unconscious of\r\npregnancy. Merriman speaks of a woman forty years of age who had not\r\nborne a child for nine years, but who suddenly gave birth to a stout,\r\nhealthy boy without being cognizant of pregnancy. Dayral tells of a\r\nwoman who carried a child all through pregnancy, unconscious of her\r\ncondition, and who was greatly surprised at its birth. Among the French\r\nobservers speaking of pregnancy remaining unrecognized by the mother\r\nuntil the period of accouchement, Lozes and Rhades record peculiar\r\ncases; and Mouronval relates an instance in which a woman who had borne\r\nthree children completely ignored the presence of pregnancy until the\r\npains of labor were felt.  Fleishman and Munzenthaler also record\r\nexamples of unconscious pregnancy.\r\n\r\nPseudocyesis.--On the other hand, instances of pregnancy with imaginary\r\nsymptoms and preparations for birth are sometimes noticed, and many\r\ncases are on record. In fact, nearly every text-book on obstetrics\r\ngives some space to the subject of pseudocyesis. Suppression of the\r\nmenses, enlargement of the abdomen, engorgement of the breasts,\r\ntogether with the symptoms produced by the imagination, such as nausea,\r\nspasmodic contraction of the abdomen, etc., are for the most part the\r\norigin of the cases of pseudocyesis. Of course, many of the cases are\r\nnot examples of true pseudocyesis, with its interesting phenomena, but\r\ninstances of malingering for mercenary or other purposes, and some are\r\ncalculated to deceive the most expert obstetricians by their tricks.\r\nWeir Mitchell delineates an interesting case of pseudocyesis as\r\nfollows: \"A woman, young, or else, it may be, at or past the\r\nclimacteric, eagerly desires a child or is horribly afraid of becoming\r\npregnant. The menses become slight in amount, irregular, and at last\r\ncease or not.  Meanwhile the abdomen and breasts enlarge, owing to a\r\nrapid taking on of fat, and this is far less visible elsewhere. There\r\ncomes with this excess of fat the most profound conviction of the fact\r\nof pregnancy. By and by the child is felt, the physician takes it for\r\ngranted, and this goes on until the great diagnostician, Time, corrects\r\nthe delusion. Then the fat disappears with remarkable speed, and the\r\nreign of this singular simulation is at an end.\" In the same article,\r\nDr. Mitchell cites the two following cases under his personal\r\nobservation: \"I was consulted by a lady in regard to a woman of thirty\r\nyears of age, a nurse in whom she was interested. This person had been\r\nmarried some three years to a very old man possessed of a considerable\r\nestate. He died, leaving his wife her legal share and the rest to\r\ndistant cousins, unless the wife had a child. For two months before he\r\ndied the woman, who was very anemic, ceased to menstruate. She became\r\nsure that she was pregnant, and thereupon took on flesh at a rate and\r\nin a way which seemed to justify her belief. Her breasts and abdomen\r\nwere the chief seats of this overgrowth. The menses did not return, her\r\npallor increased; the child was felt, and every preparation made for\r\ndelivery. At the eighth month a physician made an examination and\r\nassured her of the absence of pregnancy. A second medical opinion\r\nconfirmed the first, and the tenth month found her of immense size and\r\nstill positive as to her condition. At the twelfth month her menstrual\r\nflow returned, and she became sure it was the early sign of labor. When\r\nit passed over she became convinced of her error, and at once dropped\r\nweight at the rate of half a pound a day despite every effort to limit\r\nthe rate of this remarkable loss. At the end of two months she had\r\nparted with fifty pounds and was, on the whole, less anemic. At this\r\nstage I was consulted by letter, as the woman had become exceedingly\r\nhysteric. This briefly stated case, which occurred many years ago, is a\r\nfair illustration of my thesis.\r\n\r\n\"Another instance I saw when in general practice. A lady who had\r\nseveral children and suffered much in her pregnancies passed five years\r\nwithout becoming impregnated. Then she missed a period, and had, as\r\nusual, vomiting. She made some wild efforts to end her supposed\r\npregnancy, and failing, acquiesced in her fate. The menses returned at\r\nthe ninth month and were presumed to mean labor. Meanwhile she vomited,\r\nup to the eighth month, and ate little. Nevertheless, she took on fat\r\nso as to make the abdomen and breasts immense and to excite unusual\r\nattention. No physician examined her until the supposed labor began,\r\nwhen, of course, the truth came out. She was pleased not to have\r\nanother child, and in her case, as in all the others known to me, the\r\nfat lessened as soon as the mind was satisfied as to the non-existence\r\nof pregnancy. As I now recall the facts, this woman was not more than\r\ntwo months in getting rid of the excess of adipose tissue.  Dr. Hirst\r\ntells me he has met with cases of women taking on fat with cessation of\r\nthe menses, and in which there was also a steady belief in the\r\nexistence of pregnancy. He has not so followed up these cases as to\r\nknow if in them the fat fell away with speed when once the patient was\r\nassured that no child existed within her.\"\r\n\r\nHirst, in an article on the difficulties in the diagnosis of pregnancy,\r\ngives several excellent photographs showing the close resemblance\r\nbetween several pathologic conditions and the normal distention of the\r\nabdomen in pregnancy. A woman who had several children fell sick with a\r\nchest-affection, followed by an edema.  For fifteen months she was\r\nconfined to her bed, and had never had connection with her husband\r\nduring that time. Her menses ceased; her mammae became engorged and\r\ndischarged a serous lactescent fluid; her belly enlarged, and both she\r\nand her physician felt fetal movements in her abdomen. As in her\r\nprevious pregnancies, she suffered nausea. Naturally, a suspicion as to\r\nher virtue came into her husband's mind, but when he considered that\r\nshe had never left her bed for fifteen months he thought the pregnancy\r\nimpossible. Still the wife insisted that she was pregnant and was\r\nconfirmed in the belief by a midwife. The belly continued to increase,\r\nand about eleven months after the cessation of the menses she had the\r\npains of labor. Three doctors and an accoucheur were present, and when\r\nthey claimed that the fetal head presented the husband gave up in\r\ndespair; but the supposed fetus was born shortly after, and proved to\r\nbe only a mass of hydatids, with not the sign of a true pregnancy.\r\nGirard of Lyons speaks of a female who had been pregnant several times,\r\nbut again experienced the signs of pregnancy. Her mammae were engorged\r\nwith a lactescent fluid, and she felt belly-movements like those of a\r\nchild; but during all this time she had regular menstruation. Her\r\nabdomen progressively increased in size, and between the tenth and\r\neleventh months she suffered what she thought to be labor-pains. These\r\nfalse pains ceased upon taking a bath, and with the disappearance of\r\nthe other signs was dissipated the fallacious idea of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThere is mentioned an instance of medicolegal interest of a young girl\r\nwho showed all the signs of pregnancy and confessed to her parents that\r\nshe had had commerce with a man. The parents immediately prosecuted the\r\nseducer by strenuous legal methods, but when her ninth month came, and\r\nafter the use of six baths, all the signs of pregnancy vanished. Harvey\r\ncites several instances of pseudocyesis, and says we must not rashly\r\ndetermine of the the inordinate birth before the seventh or after the\r\neleventh month. In 1646 a woman, after having laughed heartily at the\r\njests of an ill-bred, covetous clown, was seized with various movements\r\nand motions in her belly like those of a child, and these continued for\r\nover a month, when the courses appeared again and the movements ceased.\r\nThe woman was certain that she was pregnant.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy historic case of pseudocyesis is that of Queen Mary\r\nof England, or \"Bloody Mary,\" as she was called. To insure the\r\nsuccession of a Catholic heir, she was most desirous of having a son by\r\nher consort, Philip, and she constantly prayed and wished for\r\npregnancy.  Finally her menses stopped; the breasts began to enlarge\r\nand became discolored around the nipples. She had morning-sickness of a\r\nviolent nature and her abdomen enlarged. On consultation with the\r\nladies of her court, her opinion of pregnancy was strongly confirmed.\r\nHer favorite amusement then was to make baby-clothes and count on her\r\nfingers the months of pregnancy. When the end of the ninth month\r\napproached, the people were awakened one night by the joyous peals of\r\nthe bells of London announcing the new heir.  An ambassador had been\r\nsent to tell the Pope that Mary could feel the new life within her, and\r\nthe people rushed to St. Paul's Cathedral to listen to the venerable\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury describe the baby-prince and give thanks for\r\nhis deliverance. The spurious labor pains passed away, and after being\r\nassured that no real pregnancy existed in her case, Mary went into\r\nviolent hysterics, and Philip, disgusted with the whole affair,\r\ndeserted her; then commenced the persecution of the Protestants, which\r\nblighted the reign.\r\n\r\nPutnam cites the case of a healthy brunet, aged forty, the mother of\r\nthree children. She had abrupt vertical abdominal movements, so strong\r\nas to cause her to plunge and sway from side to side.  Her breasts were\r\nenlarged, the areolae dark, and the uterus contained an elastic tumor,\r\nheavy and rolling under the hand. Her abdomen progressively enlarged to\r\nthe regular size of matured gestation; but the extrauterine pregnancy,\r\nwhich was supposed to have existed, was not seen at the autopsy,\r\nnothing more than an enlarged liver being found. The movement was due\r\nto spasmodic movements of the abdominal muscles, the causes being\r\nunknown.  Madden gives the history of a primipara of twenty-eight,\r\nmarried one year, to whom he was called. On entering the room he was\r\ngreeted by the midwife, who said she expected the child about 8 P.M.\r\nThe woman was lying in the usual obstetric position, on the left side,\r\ngroaning, crying loudly, and pulling hard at a strap fastened to the\r\nbed-post. She had a partial cessation of menses, and had complained of\r\ntumultuous movements of the child and overflow of milk from the\r\nbreasts. Examination showed the cervix low down, the os small and\r\ncircular, and no signs of pregnancy in the uterus. The abdomen was\r\ndistended with tympanites and the rectum much dilated with accumulated\r\nfeces. Dr. Madden left her, telling her that she was not pregnant, and\r\nwhen she reappeared at his office in a few days, he reassured her of\r\nthe nonexistence of pregnancy; she became very indignant, triumphantly\r\nsqueezed lactescent fluid from her breasts, and, insisting that she\r\ncould feel fetal movements, left to seek a more sympathetic accoucheur.\r\nUnderhill, in the words of Hamilton, describes a woman as \"having\r\nacquired the most accurate description of the breeding symptoms, and\r\nwith wonderful facility imagined that she had felt every one of them.\"\r\nHe found the woman on a bed complaining of great labor-pains, biting a\r\nhandkerchief, and pulling on a cloth attached to her bed. The finger on\r\nthe abdomen or vulva elicited symptoms of great sensitiveness. He told\r\nher she was not pregnant, and the next day she was sitting up, though\r\nthe discharge continued, but the simulated throes of labor, which she\r\nhad so graphically pictured, had ceased.\r\n\r\nHaultain gives three examples of pseudocyesis, the first with no\r\napparent cause, the second due to carcinoma of the uterus, while in the\r\nthird there was a small fibroid in the anterior wall of the uterus.\r\nSome cases are of purely nervous origin, associated with a purely\r\nmuscular distention of the abdomen. Clay reported a case due to\r\nascites. Cases of pseudocyesis in women convicted of murder are not\r\nuncommon, though most of them are imposters hoping for an extra lease\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nCroon speaks of a child seven years old on whom he performed ovariotomy\r\nfor a round-celled sarcoma. She had been well up to May, but since then\r\nshe had several times been raped by a boy, in consequence of which she\r\nhad constant uterine hemorrhage. Shortly after the first coitus her\r\nabdomen began to enlarge, the breasts to develop, and the areolae to\r\ndarken. In seven months the abdomen presented the signs of pregnancy,\r\nbut the cervix was soft and patulous; the sound entered three inches\r\nand was followed by some hemorrhage. The child was well developed, the\r\nmons was covered with hair, and all the associate symptoms tended to\r\nincrease the deception.\r\n\r\nSympathetic Male Nausea of Pregnancy.--Associated with pregnancy there\r\nare often present morning-nausea and vomiting as prominent and reliable\r\nsymptoms. Vomiting is often so excessive as to be provocative of most\r\nserious issue and even warranting the induction of abortion. This fact\r\nis well known and has been thoroughly discussed, but with it is\r\nassociated an interesting point, the occasional association of the same\r\nsymptoms sympathetically in the husband. The belief has long been a\r\nsuperstition in parts of Great Britain, descending to America, and even\r\nexists at the present day. Sir Francis Bacon has written on this\r\nsubject, the substance of his argument being that certain loving\r\nhusbands so sympathize with their pregnant wives that they suffer\r\nmorning-sickness in their own person. No less an authority than S. Weir\r\nMitchell called attention to the interesting subject of sympathetic\r\nvomiting in the husband in his lectures on nervous maladies some years\r\nago. He also quotes the following case associated with pseudocyesis:--\r\n\r\n\"A woman had given birth to two female children. Some years passed and\r\nher desire for a boy was ungratified. Then she missed her flow once,\r\nand had thrice after this, as always took place with her when pregnant,\r\na very small but regular loss. At the second month morning-vomiting\r\ncame on as usual with her.  Meanwhile she became very fat, and as the\r\ngrowth was largely, in fact excessively, abdominal, she became easily\r\nsure of her condition. She was not my patient, but her husband\r\nconsulted me as to his own morning-sickness, which came on with the\r\nfirst occurrence of this sign in his wife, as had been the case twice\r\nbefore in her former pregnancies. I advised him to leave home, and this\r\nproved effectual. I learned later that the woman continued to gain\r\nflesh and be sick every morning until the seventh month. Then\r\nmenstruation returned, an examination was made, and when sure that\r\nthere was no possibility of her being pregnant she began to lose flesh,\r\nand within a few months regained her usual size.\"\r\n\r\nHamill reports an instance of morning-sickness in a husband two weeks\r\nafter the appearance of menstruation in the wife for the last time. He\r\nhad daily attacks, and it was not until the failure of the next menses\r\nthat the woman had any other sign of pregnancy than her husband's\r\nnausea. His nausea continued for two months, and was the same as that\r\nwhich he had suffered during his wife's former pregnancies, although\r\nnot until both he and his wife became aware of the existence of\r\npregnancy. The Lancet describes a case in which the husband's nausea\r\nand vomiting, as well as that of the wife, began and ended\r\nsimultaneously. Judkins cites an instance of a man who was sick in the\r\nmorning while his wife was carrying a child. This occurred during every\r\npregnancy, and the man related that his own father was similarly\r\naffected while his mother was in the early months of pregnancy with\r\nhim, showing an hereditary predisposition.\r\n\r\nThe perverted appetites and peculiar longings of pregnant women furnish\r\ncurious matter for discussion. From the earliest times there are many\r\nsuch records. Borellus cites an instance, and there are many others, of\r\npregnant women eating excrement with apparent relish. Tulpius, Sennert,\r\nLangius, van Swieten, a Castro, and several others report depraved\r\nappetites. Several writers have seen avidity for human flesh in such\r\nfemales.  Fournier knew a woman with an appetite for the blood of her\r\nhusband. She gently cut him while he lay asleep by her side and sucked\r\nblood from the wounds--a modern \"Succubus.\" Pare mentions the perverted\r\nappetites of pregnant women, and says that they have been known to eat\r\nplaster, ashes, dirt, charcoal, flour, salt, spices, to drink pure\r\nvinegar, and to indulge in all forms of debauchery. Plot gives the case\r\nof a woman who would gnaw and eat all the linen off her bed. Hufeland's\r\nJournal records the history of a case of a woman of thirty-two, who had\r\nbeen married ten years, who acquired a strong taste for charcoal, and\r\nwas ravenous for it. It seemed to cheer her and to cure a supposed\r\ndyspepsia. She devoured enormous quantities, preferring hard-wood\r\ncharcoal. Bruyesinus speaks of a woman who had a most perverted\r\nappetite for her own milk, and constantly drained her breasts;\r\nKrafft-Ebing cites a similar case. Another case is that of a pregnant\r\nwoman who had a desire for hot and pungent articles of food, and who in\r\na short time devoured a pound of pepper.  Scheidemantel cites a case in\r\nwhich the perverted appetite, originating in pregnancy, became\r\npermanent, but this is not the experience of most observers. The\r\npregnant wife of a farmer in Hassfort-on-the-Main ate the excrement of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nMany instances could be quoted, some in which extreme cases of\r\npolydipsia and bulimia developed; these can be readily attributed to\r\nthe increased call for liquids and food. Other cases of diverse new\r\nemotions can be recalled, such as lasciviousness, dirty habits,\r\nperverted thoughts, and, on the other hand, extreme piety, chastity,\r\nand purity of the mind. Some of the best-natured women are when\r\npregnant extremely cross and irritable and many perversions of\r\ndisposition are commonly noticed in pregnancy.  There is often a\r\nlonging for a particular kind of food or dish for which no noticeable\r\ndesire had been displayed before.\r\n\r\nMaternal Impressions.--Another curious fact associated with pregnancy\r\nis the apparent influence of the emotions of the mother on the child in\r\nutero. Every one knows of the popular explanation of many birth-marks,\r\ntheir supposed resemblance to some animal or object seen by the mother\r\nduring pregnancy, etc. The truth of maternal impressions, however,\r\nseems to be more firmly established by facts of a substantial nature.\r\nThere is a natural desire to explain any abnormality or anomaly of the\r\nchild as due to some incident during the period of the mother's\r\npregnancy, and the truth is often distorted and the imagination heavily\r\ndrawn upon to furnish the satisfactory explanation. It is the customary\r\nspeech of the dime-museum lecturer to attribute the existence of some\r\n\"freak\" to an episode in the mother's pregnancy. The poor\r\n\"Elephant-man\" firmly believed his peculiarity was due to the fact that\r\nhis mother while carrying him in utero was knocked down at the circus\r\nby an elephant. In some countries the exhibition of monstrosities is\r\nforbidden because of the supposed danger of maternal impression. The\r\ncelebrated \"Siamese Twins\" for this reason were forbidden to exhibit\r\nthemselves for quite a period in France.\r\n\r\nWe shall cite only a few of the most interesting cases from medical\r\nliterature. Hippocrates saved the honor of a princess, accused of\r\nadultery with a negro because she bore a black child, by citing it as a\r\ncase of maternal impression, the husband of the princess having placed\r\nin her room a painting of a negro, to the view of which she was\r\nsubjected during the whole of her pregnancy. Then, again, in the\r\ntreatise \"De Superfoetatione\" there occurs the following distinct\r\nstatement: \"If a pregnant woman has a longing to eat earth or coals,\r\nand eats of them, the infant which is born carries on its head the mark\r\nof these things.\" This statement, however, occurs in a work which is\r\nnot mentioned by any of the ancient authorities, and is rejected by\r\npractically all the modern ones; according to Ballantyne, there is,\r\ntherefore, no absolute proof that Hippocrates was a believer in one of\r\nthe most popular and long-persisting beliefs concerning fetal\r\ndeformities.\r\n\r\nIn the explanation of heredity, Hippocrates states \"that the body of\r\nthe male as well as that of the female furnishes the semen.  That which\r\nis weak (unhealthy) is derived from weak (unhealthy) parts, that which\r\nis strong (healthy) from strong (healthy) parts, and the fetus will\r\ncorrespond to the quality of the semen.  If the semen of one part come\r\nin greater quantity from the male than from the female, this part will\r\nresemble more closely the father; if, however, it comes more from the\r\nfemale, the part will rather resemble the mother. If it be true that\r\nthe semen comes from both parents, then it is impossible for the whole\r\nbody to resemble either the mother or the father, or neither the one\r\nnor the other in anything, but necessarily the child will resemble both\r\nthe one and the other in something. The child will most resemble the\r\none who contributes most to the formation of the parts.\" Such was the\r\nHippocratic theory of generation and heredity, and it was ingeniously\r\nused to explain the hereditary nature of certain diseases and\r\nmalformations. For instance, in speaking of the sacred disease\r\n(epilepsy), Hippocrates says: \"Its origin is hereditary, like that of\r\nother diseases; for if a phlegmatic person be born of a phlegmatic, and\r\na bilious of a bilious, and a phthisical of a phthisical, and one\r\nhaving spleen disease of another having disease of the spleen, what is\r\nto hinder it from happening that where the father and mother were\r\nsubject to this disease certain of their offspring should be so\r\naffected also? As the semen comes from all parts of the body, healthy\r\nparticles will come from healthy parts, and unhealthy from unhealthy\r\nparts.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Pare, Damascene saw a girl with long hair like a bear,\r\nwhose mother had constantly before her a picture of the hairy St. John.\r\nPare also appends an illustration showing the supposed resemblance to a\r\nbear. Jonston quotes a case of Heliodorus; it was an Ethiopian, who by\r\nthe effect of the imagination produced a white child. Pare describes\r\nthis case more fully: \"Heliodorus says that Persina, Queen of Ethiopia,\r\nbeing impregnated by Hydustes, also an Ethiopian, bore a daughter with\r\na white skin, and the anomaly was ascribed to the admiration that a\r\npicture of Andromeda excited in Persina throughout the whole of the\r\npregnancy.\" Van Helmont cites the case of a tailor's wife at Mechlin,\r\nwho during a conflict outside her house, on seeing a soldier lose his\r\nhand at her door, gave birth to a daughter with one hand, the other\r\nhand being a bleeding stump; he also speaks of the case of the wife of\r\na merchant at Antwerp, who after seeing a soldier's arm shot off at the\r\nsiege of Ostend gave birth to a daughter with one arm. Plot speaks of a\r\nchild bearing the figure of a mouse; when pregnant, the mother had been\r\nmuch frightened by one of these animals. Gassendus describes a fetus\r\nwith the traces of a wound in the same location as one received by the\r\nmother. The Lancet speaks of several cases--one of a child with a face\r\nresembling a dog whose mother had been bitten; one of a child with one\r\neye blue and the other black, whose mother during confinement had seen\r\na person so marked; of an infant with fins as upper and lower\r\nextremities, the mother having seen such a monster; and another, a\r\nchild born with its feet covered with scalds and burns, whose mother\r\nhad been badly frightened by fireworks and a descending rocket. There\r\nis the history of a woman who while pregnant at seven months with her\r\nfifth child was bitten on the right calf by a dog. Ten weeks after, she\r\nbore a child with three marks corresponding in size and appearance to\r\nthose caused by the dog's teeth on her leg. Kerr reports the case of a\r\nwoman in her seventh month whose daughter fell on a cooking stove,\r\nshocking the mother, who suspected fatal burns. The woman was delivered\r\ntwo months later of an infant blistered about the mouth and extremities\r\nin a manner similar to the burns of her sister. This infant died on the\r\nthird day, but another was born fourteen months later with the same\r\nblisters. Inflammation set in and nearly all the fingers and toes\r\nsloughed of. In a subsequent confinement, long after the mental\r\nagitation, a healthy unmarked infant was born.\r\n\r\nHunt describes a case which has since become almost classic of a woman\r\nfatally burned, when pregnant eight months, by her clothes catching\r\nfire at the kitchen grate. The day after the burns labor began and was\r\nterminated by the birth of a well-formed dead female child, apparently\r\nblistered and burned in extent and in places corresponding almost\r\nexactly to the locations of the mother's injuries. The mother died on\r\nthe fourth day.\r\n\r\nWebb reports the history of a negress who during a convulsion while\r\npregnant fell into a fire, burning the whole front of the abdomen, the\r\nfront and inside of the thighs to the knees, the external genitals, and\r\nthe left arm. Artificial delivery was deemed necessary, and a dead\r\nchild, seemingly burned much like its mother, except less intensely,\r\nwas delivered. There was also one large blister near the inner canthus\r\nof the eye and some large blisters about the neck and throat which the\r\nmother did not show. There was no history of syphilis nor of any\r\neruptive fever in the mother, who died on the tenth day with tetanus.\r\n\r\nGraham describes a woman of thirty-five, the mother of seven children,\r\nwho while pregnant was feeding some rabbits, when one of the animals\r\njumped at her with its eyes \"glaring\" upon her, causing a sudden\r\nfright. Her child was born hydrocephalic. Its mouth and face were small\r\nand rabbit-shaped. Instead of a nose, it had a fleshy growth 3/4 inch\r\nlong by 1/4 inch broad, directed upward at an angle of 45 degrees. The\r\nspace between this and the mouth was occupied by a body resembling an\r\nadult eye. Within this were two small, imperfect eyes which moved\r\nfreely while life lasted (ten minutes). The child's integument was\r\ncovered with dark, downy, short hair. The woman recovered and afterward\r\nbore two normal children.\r\n\r\nParvin mentions an instance of the influence of maternal impression in\r\nthe causation of a large, vivid, red mark or splotch on the face: \"When\r\nthe mother was in Ireland she was badly frightened by a fire in which\r\nsome cattle were burned.  Again, during the early months of her\r\npregnancy she was frightened by seeing another woman suddenly light the\r\nfire with kerosene, and at that time became firmly impressed with the\r\nidea that her child would be marked.\" Parvin also pictures the\r\n\"turtle-man,\" an individual with deformed extremities, who might be\r\nclassed as an ectromelus, perhaps as a phocomelus, or seal-like\r\nmonster. According to the story, when the mother was a few weeks\r\npregnant her husband, a coarse, rough fisherman, fond of rude jokes,\r\nput a large live turtle in the cupboard. In the twilight the wife went\r\nto the cupboard and the huge turtle fell out, greatly startling her by\r\nits hideous appearance as it fell suddenly to the floor and began to\r\nmove vigorously.\r\n\r\nCopeland mentions a curious case in which a woman was attacked by a\r\nrattlesnake when in her sixth month of pregnancy, and gave birth to a\r\nchild whose arm exhibited the shape and action of a snake, and\r\ninvoluntarily went through snake-like movements. The face and mouth\r\nalso markedly resembled the head of a snake.\r\n\r\nThe teeth were situated like a serpent's fangs. The mere mention of a\r\nsnake filled the child (a man of twenty-nine) with great horror and\r\nrage, \"particularly in the snake season.\" Beale gives the history of a\r\ncase of a child born with its left eye blackened as by a blow, whose\r\nmother was struck in a corresponding portion of the face eight hours\r\nbefore confinement. There is on record an account of a young man of\r\ntwenty-one suffering from congenital deformities attributed to the fact\r\nthat his mother was frightened by a guinea-pig having been thrust into\r\nher face during pregnancy. He also had congenital deformity of the\r\nright auricle.  At the autopsy, all the skin, tissues, muscles, and\r\nbones were found involved. Owen speaks of a woman who was greatly\r\nexcited ten months previously by a prurient curiosity to see what\r\nappearance the genitals of her brother presented after he had submitted\r\nto amputation of the penis on account of carcinoma. The whole penis had\r\nbeen removed. The woman stated that from the time she had thus\r\nsatisfied herself, her mind was unceasingly engaged in reflecting and\r\nsympathizing on the forlorn condition of her brother. While in this\r\nmental state she gave birth to a son whose penis was entirely absent,\r\nbut who was otherwise well and likely to live. The other portions of\r\nthe genitals were perfect and well developed. The appearance of the\r\nnephew and the uncle was identical. A most peculiar case is stated by\r\nClerc as occurring in the experience of Kuss of Strasburg. A woman had\r\na negro paramour in America with whom she had had sexual intercourse\r\nseveral times. She was put in a convent on the Continent, where she\r\nstayed two years. On leaving the convent she married a white man, and\r\nnine months after she gave birth to a dark-skinned child. The\r\nsupposition was that during her abode in the convent and the nine\r\nmonths subsequently she had the image of her black paramour constantly\r\nbefore her. Loin speaks of a woman who was greatly impressed by the\r\nactions of a clown at a circus, and who brought into the world a child\r\nthat resembled the fantastic features of the clown in a most striking\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMackay describes five cases in which fright produced distinct marks on\r\nthe fetus. There is a case mentioned in which a pregnant woman was\r\ninformed that an intimate friend had been thrown from his horse; the\r\nimmediate cause of death was fracture of the skull, produced by the\r\ncorner of a dray against which the rider was thrown. The mother was\r\nprofoundly impressed by the circumstance, which was minutely described\r\nto her by an eye-witness. Her child at birth presented a red and\r\nsensitive area upon the scalp corresponding in location with the fatal\r\ninjury in the rider. The child is now an adult woman, and this area\r\nupon the scalp remains red and sensitive to pressure, and is almost\r\ndevoid of hair. Mastin of Mobile, Alabama, reports a curious instance\r\nof maternal impression. During the sixth month of the pregnancy of the\r\nmother her husband was shot, the ball passing out through the left\r\nbreast. The woman was naturally much shocked, and remarked to Dr.\r\nMastin: \"Doctor, my baby will be ruined, for when I saw the wound I put\r\nmy hands over my face, and got it covered with blood, and I know my\r\nbaby will have a bloody face.\" The child came to term without a bloody\r\nface. It had, however, a well-defined spot on the left breast just\r\nbelow the site of exit of the ball from its father's chest. The spot\r\nwas about the size of a silver half-dollar, and had elevated edges of a\r\nbright red color, and was quite visible at the distance of one hundred\r\nfeet. The authors have had personal communication with Dr. Mastin in\r\nregard to this case, which he considers the most positive evidence of a\r\ncase of maternal impression that he has ever met.\r\n\r\nPaternal Impressions.--Strange as are the foregoing cases, those of\r\npaternal impression eclipse them. Several are on record, but none are\r\nof sufficient authenticity to warrant much discussion on the subject.\r\nThose below are given to illustrate the method of report. Stahl, quoted\r\nby Steinan, 1843, speaks of the case of a child, the father being a\r\nsoldier who lost an eye in the war. The child was born with one of its\r\neyes dried up in the orbit, in this respect presenting an appearance\r\nlike that of the father.  Schneider says a man whose wife was expecting\r\nconfinement dreamt that his oldest son stood beside his bedside with\r\nhis genitals much mutilated and bleeding. He awoke in a great state of\r\nagitation, and a few days later the wife was delivered of a child with\r\nexstrophy of the bladder. Hoare recites the curious story of a man who\r\nvowed that if his next child was a daughter he would never speak to it.\r\nThe child proved to be a son, and during the whole of the father's life\r\nnothing could induce the son to speak to his father, nor, in fact, to\r\nany other male person, but after the father's death he talked fluently\r\nto both men and women.  Clark reports the birth of a child whose father\r\nhad a stiff knee-joint, and the child's knee was stiff and bent in\r\nexactly the same position as that of its father.\r\n\r\nTelegony.--The influence of the paternal seed on the physical and\r\nmental constitution of the child is well known. To designate this\r\ncondition, Telegony is the word that was coined by Weismann in his \"Das\r\nKeimplasma,\" and he defines it as \"Infection of the Germ,\" and, at\r\nanother time, as \"Those doubtful instances in which the offspring is\r\nsaid to resemble, not the father, but an early mate of the\r\nmother,\"--or, in other words, the alleged influence of a previous sire\r\non the progeny produced by a subsequent one from the same mother. In a\r\nsystematic discussion of telegony before the Royal Medical Society,\r\nEdinburgh, on March 1, 1895, Brunton Blaikie, as a means of making the\r\ndefinition of telegony plainer by practical example, prefaced his\r\nremarks by citing the classic example which first drew the attention of\r\nthe modern scientific world to this phenomenon. The facts of this case\r\nwere communicated in a letter from the Earl of Morton to the President\r\nof the Royal Society in 1821, and were as follows: In the year 1816\r\nLord Morton put a male quagga to a young chestnut mare of 7/8 Arabian\r\nblood, which had never before been bred from.  The result was a female\r\nhybrid which resembled both parents. He now sold the mare to Sir Gore\r\nOusley, who two years after she bore the hybrid put her to a black\r\nArabian horse. During the two following years she had two foals which\r\nLord Morton thus describes: \"They have the character of the Arabian\r\nbreed as decidedly as can be expected when 15/16 of the blood are\r\nArabian, and they are fine specimens of the breed; but both in their\r\ncolor and in the hair of their manes they have a striking resemblance\r\nto the quagga. Their color is bay, marked more or less like the quagga\r\nin a darker tint. Both are distinguished by the dark line along the\r\nridge of the back, the dark stripes across the forehand, and the dark\r\nbars across the back part of the legs.\" The President of the Royal\r\nSociety saw the foals and verified Lord Morton's statement.\r\n\r\n\"Herbert Spencer, in the Contemporary Review for May, 1893, gives\r\nseveral cases communicated to him by his friend Mr. Fookes, whom\r\nSpencer says is often appointed judge of animals at agricultural shows.\r\nAfter giving various examples he goes on to say: 'A friend of mine near\r\nthis had a valuable Dachshund bitch, which most unfortunately had a\r\nlitter by a stray sheep-dog. The next year the owner sent her on a\r\nvisit to a pure Dachshund dog, but the produce took quite as much of\r\nthe first father as the second, and the next year he sent her to\r\nanother Dachshund, with the same result. Another case: A friend of mine\r\nin Devizes had a litter of puppies unsought for, by a setter from a\r\nfavorite pointer bitch, and after this she never bred any true\r\npointers, no matter what the paternity was.'\r\n\r\n\"Lord Polwarth, whose very fine breed of Border Leicesters is famed\r\nthroughout Britain, and whose knowledge on the subject of breeding is\r\ngreat, says that 'In sheep we always consider that if a ewe breeds to a\r\nShrop ram, she is never safe to breed pure Leicesters from, as dun or\r\ncolored legs are apt to come even when the sire is a pure Leicester.\r\nThis has been proved in various instances, but is not invariable.'\"\r\n\r\nHon. Henry Scott says: \"Dog-breeders know this theory well; and if a\r\npure-bred bitch happens to breed to a dog of another breed, she is of\r\nlittle use for breeding pure-bred puppies afterward.  Animals which\r\nproduce large litters and go a short time pregnant show this throwing\r\nback to previous sires far more distinctly than others--I fancy dogs\r\nand pigs most of all, and probably horses least. The influence of\r\nprevious sires may be carried into the second generation or further, as\r\nI have a cat now which appears to be half Persian (long hair). His dam\r\nhas very long hair and every appearance of being a half Persian,\r\nwhereas neither have really any Persian blood, as far as I know, but\r\nthe grand-dam (a very smooth-haired cat) had several litters by a\r\nhalf-Persian tom-cat, and all her produce since have showed the\r\ninfluence retained. The Persian tom-cat died many years ago, and was\r\nthe only one in the district, so, although I cannot be absolutely\r\npositive, still I think this case is really as stated.\"\r\n\r\nBreeders of Bedlington terriers wish to breed dogs with as powerful\r\njaws as possible. In order to accomplish this they put the Bedlington\r\nterrier bitch first to a bull-terrier dog, and get a mongrel litter\r\nwhich they destroy. They now put the bitch to a Bedlington terrier dog\r\nand get a litter of puppies which are practically pure, but have much\r\nstronger jaws than they would otherwise have had, and also show much of\r\nthe gameness of the bull-terrier, thus proving that physiologic as well\r\nas anatomic characters may be transmitted in this way.\r\n\r\nAfter citing the foregoing examples, Blaikie directs his attention to\r\nman, and makes the following interesting remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"We might expect from the foregoing account of telegony amongst animals\r\nthat whenever a black woman had a child to a white man, and then\r\nmarried a black man, her subsequent children would not be entirely\r\nblack. Dr. Robert Balfour of Surinam in 1851 wrote to Harvey that he\r\nwas continually noticing amongst the colored population of Surinam\r\n'that if a negress had a child or children by a white, and afterward\r\nfruitful intercourse with a negro, the latter offspring had generally a\r\nlighter color than the parents.' But, as far as I know, this is the\r\nonly instance of this observation on record. Herbert Spencer has shown\r\nthat when a pure-bred animal breeds with an animal of a mixed breed,\r\nthe offspring resembles much more closely the parent of pure blood, and\r\nthis may explain why the circumstance recorded by Balfour has been so\r\nseldom noted. For a negro, who is of very pure blood, will naturally\r\nhave a stronger influence on the subsequent progeny than an\r\nAnglo-Saxon, who comes of a mixed stock. If this be the correct\r\nexplanation, we should expect that when a white woman married first a\r\nblack man, and then a white, the children by the white husband would be\r\ndark colored. Unfortunately for the proof of telegony, it is very rare\r\nthat a white woman does marry a black man, and then have a white as\r\nsecond husband; nevertheless, we have a fair number of recorded\r\ninstances of dark-colored children being born in the above way of white\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Harvey mentions a case in which 'a young woman, residing in\r\nEdinburgh, and born of white (Scottish) parents, but whose mother, some\r\ntime previous to her marriage, had a natural (mulatto) child by a negro\r\nman-servant in Edinburgh, exhibits distinct traces of the negro. Dr.\r\nSimpson--afterward Sir James Simpson--whose patient the young woman at\r\none time was, has had no recent opportunities of satisfying himself as\r\nto the precise extent to which the negro character prevails in her\r\nfeatures; but he recollects being struck with the resemblance, and\r\nnoticed particularly that the hair had the qualities characteristic of\r\nthe negro.' Herbert Spencer got a letter from a 'distinguished\r\ncorrespondent' in the United States, who said that children by white\r\nparents had been 'repeatedly' observed to show traces of black blood\r\nwhen the women had had previous connection with (i.e., a child by) a\r\nnegro. Dr. Youmans of New York interviewed several medical professors,\r\nwho said the above was 'generally accepted as a fact.' Prof. Austin\r\nFlint, in 'A Text-book of Human Physiology,' mentioned this fact, and\r\nwhen asked about it said: 'He had never heard the statement questioned.'\r\n\r\n\"But it is not only in relation to color that we find telegony to have\r\nbeen noticed in the human subject. Dr. Middleton Michel gives a most\r\ninteresting case in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences for\r\n1868: 'A black woman, mother of several negro children, none of whom\r\nwere deformed in any particular, had illicit intercourse with a white\r\nman, by whom she became pregnant. During gestation she manifested great\r\nuneasiness of mind, lest the birth of a mulatto offspring should\r\ndisclose her conduct.... It so happened that her negro husband\r\npossessed a sixth digit on each hand, but there was no peculiarity of\r\nany kind in the white man, yet when the mulatto child was born it\r\nactually presented the deformity of a supernumerary finger.' Taruffi,\r\nthe celebrated Italian teratologist, in speaking of the subject, says:\r\n'Our knowledge of this strange fact is by no means recent for Fienus,\r\nin 1608, said that most of the children born in adultery have a greater\r\nresemblance to the legal than to the real father'--an observation that\r\nwas confirmed by the philosopher Vanini and by the naturalist\r\nAmbrosini. From these observations comes the proverb: 'Filium ex\r\nadultera excusare matrem a culpa.' Osiander has noted telegony in\r\nrelation to moral qualities of children by a second marriage. Harvey\r\nsaid that it has long been known that the children by a second husband\r\nresemble the first husband in features mind, and disposition. He then\r\ngave a case in which this resemblance was very well marked.  Orton,\r\nBurdach (Traite de Physiologie), and Dr. William Sedgwick have all\r\nremarked on this physical resemblance; and Dr. Metcalfe, in a\r\ndissertation delivered before this society in 1855, observed that in\r\nthe cases of widows remarrying the children of the second marriage\r\nfrequently resemble the first husband.\r\n\r\n\"An observation probably having some bearing on this subject was made\r\nby Count de Stuzeleci (Harvey, loc. cit.). He noticed that when an\r\naboriginal female had had a child by a European, she lost the power of\r\nconception by a male of her own race, but could produce children by a\r\nwhite man. He believed this to be the case with many aboriginal races;\r\nbut it has been disproved, or at all events proved to be by no means a\r\nuniversal law, in every case except that of the aborigines of Australia\r\nand New Zealand. Dr. William Sedgwick thought it probable that the\r\nunfruitfulness of prostitutes might in some degree be due to the same\r\ncause as that of the Australian aborigines who have had children by\r\nwhite men.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem as though the Israelites had had some knowledge of\r\ntelegony, for in Deuteronomy we find that when a man died leaving no\r\nissue, his wife was commanded to marry her husband's brother, in order\r\nthat he might 'raise up seed to his brother.'\"\r\n\r\nWe must omit the thorough inquiry into this subject that is offered by\r\nMr. Blaikie. The explanations put forward have always been on one of\r\nthree main lines:--\r\n\r\n(1) The imagination-theory, or, to quote Harvey: \"Due to mental causes\r\nso operating either on the mind of the female and so acting on her\r\nreproductive powers, or on the mind of the male parent, and so\r\ninfluencing the qualities of his semen, as to modify the nutrition and\r\ndevelopment of the offspring.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Due to a local influence on the reproductive organs of the mother.\r\n\r\n(3) Due to a general influence through the fetus on the mother.\r\n\r\nAntenatal Pathology.--We have next to deal with the diseases,\r\naccidents, and operations that affect the pregnant uterus and its\r\ncontents; these are rich in anomalies and facts of curious interest,\r\nand have been recognized from the earliest times. In the various works\r\nusually grouped together under the general designation of \"Hippocratic\"\r\nare to be found the earliest opinions upon the subject of antenatal\r\npathology which the medical literature of Greece has handed down to\r\nmodern times.  That there were medical writers before the time of\r\nHippocrates cannot be doubted, and that the works ascribed to the\r\n\"Father of Medicine\" were immediately followed by those of other\r\nphysicians, is likewise not to be questioned; but whilst nearly all the\r\nwritings prior to and after Hippocrates have been long lost to the\r\nworld, most of those that were written by the Coan physician and his\r\nfollowers have been almost miraculously preserved. As Littre puts it,\r\n\"Les ecrits hippocratiques demeurent isoles au milieu des debris de\r\nl'antique litterature medicale.\"--(Ballantyne.)\r\n\r\nThe first to be considered is the transmission of contagious disease to\r\nthe fetus in utero. The first disease to attract attention was\r\nsmall-pox. Devilliers, Blot, and Depaul all speak of congenital\r\nsmall-pox, the child born dead and showing evidences of the typical\r\nsmall-pox pustulation, with a history of the mother having been\r\ninfected during pregnancy. Watson reports two cases in which a child in\r\nutero had small-pox. In the first case the mother was infected in\r\npregnancy; the other was nursing a patient when seven months pregnant;\r\nshe did not take the disease, although she had been infected many\r\nmonths before.  Mauriceau delivered a woman of a healthy child at full\r\nterm after she had recovered from a severe attack of this disease\r\nduring the fifth month of gestation. Mauriceau supposed the child to be\r\nimmune after the delivery. Vidal reported to the French Academy of\r\nMedicine, May, 1871, the case of a woman who gave birth to a living\r\nchild of about six and one-half months' maturation, which died some\r\nhours after birth covered with the pustules of seven or eight days'\r\neruption. The pustules on the fetus were well umbilicated and typical,\r\nand could have been nothing but those of small-pox; besides, this\r\ndisease was raging in the neighborhood at the time. The mother had\r\nnever been infected before, and never was subsequently. Both parents\r\nwere robust and neither of them had ever had syphilis. About the time\r\nof conception, the early part of December, 1870, the father had\r\nsuffered from the semiconfluent type, but the mother, who had been\r\nvaccinated when a girl, had never been stricken either during or after\r\nher husband's sickness. Quirke relates a peculiar instance of a child\r\nborn at midnight, whose mother was covered with the eruption eight\r\nhours after delivery. The child was healthy and showed no signs of the\r\ncontagion, and was vaccinated at once. Although it remained with its\r\nmother all through the sickness, it continued well, with the exception\r\nof the ninth day, when a slight fever due to its vaccination appeared.\r\nThe mother made a good recovery, and the author remarks that had the\r\nchild been born a short time later, it would most likely have been\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\nAyer reports an instance of congenital variola in twins.  Chantreuil\r\nspeaks of a woman pregnant with twins who aborted at five and a half\r\nmonths. One of the fetuses showed distinct signs of congenital variola,\r\nalthough the mother and other fetus were free from any symptoms of the\r\ndisease. In 1853 Charcot reported the birth of a premature fetus\r\npresenting numerous variolous pustules together with ulcerations of the\r\nderm and mucous membranes and stomach, although the mother had\r\nconvalesced of the disease some time before. Mitchell describes a case\r\nof small-pox occurring three days after birth, the mother not having\r\nhad the disease since childhood. Shertzer relates an instance of\r\nconfluent small-pox in the eighth month of pregnancy. The child was\r\nborn with the disease, and both mother and babe recovered.  Among many\r\nothers offering evidence of variola in utero are Degner, Derham, John\r\nHunter, Blot, Bulkley, Welch, Wright, Digk, Forbes, Marinus, and\r\nBouteiller.\r\n\r\nVaricella, Measles, Pneumonia, and even Malaria are reported as having\r\nbeen transmitted to the child in utero. Hubbard attended a woman on\r\nMarch 17, 1878, in her seventh accouchement. The child showed the rash\r\nof varicella twenty-four hours after birth, and passed through the\r\nregular coarse of chicken-pox of ten days' duration. The mother had no\r\nsigns of the disease, but the children all about her were infected.\r\nOrdinarily the period of incubation is from three to four days, with a\r\npremonitory fever of from twenty-four to seventy-two hours' duration,\r\nwhen the rash appears; this case must therefore have been infected in\r\nutero.  Lomer of Hamburg tells of the case of a woman, twenty-two\r\nyears, unmarried, pregnant, who had measles in the eighth month, and\r\nwho gave birth to an infant with measles. The mother was attacked with\r\npneumonia on the fifth day of her puerperium, but recovered; the child\r\ndied in four weeks of intestinal catarrh. Gautier found measles\r\ntransmitted from the mother to the fetus in 6 out of 11 cases, there\r\nbeing 2 maternal deaths in the 11 cases.\r\n\r\nNetter has observed the case of transmission of pneumonia from a mother\r\nto a fetus, and has seen two cases in which the blood from the uterine\r\nvessels of patients with pneumonia contained the pneumococcus. Wallick\r\ncollected a number of cases of pneumonia occurring during pregnancy,\r\nshowing a fetal mortality of 80 per cent.\r\n\r\nFelkin relates two instances of fetal malaria in which the infection\r\nwas probably transmitted by the male parent. In one case the father\r\nnear term suffered severely from malaria; the mother had never had a\r\nchill. The violent fetal movements induced labor, and the spleen was so\r\nlarge as to retard it. After birth the child had seven malarial\r\nparoxysms but recovered, the splenic tumor disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe modes of infection of the fetus by syphilis, and the infection of\r\nthe mother, have been well discussed, and need no mention here.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion on the effects on the fetus in utero of\r\nmedicine administered to the pregnant mother, and the opinions as to\r\nthe reliability of this medication are so varied that we are in doubt\r\nas to a satisfactory conclusion. The effects of drugs administered and\r\neliminated by the mammary glands and transmitted to the child at the\r\nbreast are well known, and have been witnessed by nearly every\r\nphysician, and, as in cases of strong metallic purges, etc., need no\r\nother than the actual test.  However, scientific experiments as to the\r\nefficacy of fetal therapeutics have been made from time to time with\r\nvarying results.\r\n\r\nGusserow of Strasbourg tested for iodin, chloroform, and salicylic acid\r\nin the blood and secretions of the fetus after maternal administration\r\njust before death. In 14 cases in which iodin had been administered, he\r\nexamined the fetal urine of 11 cases; in 5, iodin was present, and in\r\nthe others, absent. He made some similar experiments on the lower\r\nanimals. Benicke reports having given salicylic acid just before birth\r\nin 25 cases, and in each case finding it in the urine of the child\r\nshortly after birth.\r\n\r\nAt a discussion held in New York some years ago as to the real effect\r\non the fetus of giving narcotics to the mother, Dr. Gaillard Thomas was\r\nalmost alone in advocating that the effect was quite visible. Fordyce\r\nBarker was strongly on the negative side. Henning and Ahlfeld, two\r\nGerman observers, vouch for the opinion of Thomas, and Thornburn states\r\nthat he has witnessed the effect of nux vomica and strychnin on the\r\nfetus shortly after birth. Over fifty years ago, in a memoir on\r\n\"Placental Phthisis,\" Sir James Y. Simpson advanced a new idea in the\r\nrecommendation of potassium chlorate during the latter stages of\r\npregnancy. The efficacy of this suggestion is known, and whether, as\r\nSimpson said, it acts by supplying extra oxygen to the blood, or\r\nwhether the salt itself is conveyed to the fetus, has never been\r\ndefinitely settled.\r\n\r\nMcClintock, who has been a close observer on this subject, reports some\r\ninteresting cases. In his first case he tried a mixture of iron\r\nperchlorid and potassium chlorate three times a day on a woman who had\r\nborne three dead children, with a most successful result. His second\r\ncase failed, but in a third he was successful by the same medication\r\nwith a woman who had before borne a dead child. In a fourth case of\r\nunsuccessful pregnancy for three consecutive births he was successful.\r\nHis fifth case was extraordinary: It was that of a woman in her tenth\r\npregnancy, who, with one exception, had always borne a dead child at\r\nthe seventh or eighth month. The one exception lived a few hours only.\r\nUnder this treatment he was successful in carrying the woman safely\r\npast her time for miscarriage, and had every indication for a normal\r\nbirth at the time of report. Thornburn believes that the administration\r\nof a tonic like strychnin is of benefit to a fetus which, by its feeble\r\nheart-beats and movements, is thought to be unhealthy. Porak has\r\nrecently investigated the passage of substances foreign to the organism\r\nthrough the placenta, and offers an excellent paper on this subject,\r\nwhich is quoted in brief in a contemporary number of Teratologia.\r\n\r\nIn this important paper, Porak, after giving some historical notes,\r\ndescribes a long series of experiments performed on the guinea-pig in\r\norder to investigate the passage of arsenic, copper, lead, mercury,\r\nphosphorus, alizarin, atropin, and eserin through the placenta. The\r\nplacenta shows a real affinity for some toxic substances; in it\r\naccumulate copper and mercury, but not lead, and it is therefore\r\nthrough it that the poison reaches the fetus; in addition to its\r\npulmonary, intestinal, and renal functions, it fixes glycogen and acts\r\nas an accumulator of poisons, and so resembles in its action the liver;\r\ntherefore the organs of the fetus possess only a potential activity.\r\nThe storing up of poisons in the placenta is not so general as the\r\naccumulation of them in the liver of the mother. It may be asked if the\r\nplacenta does not form a barrier to the passage of poisons into the\r\ncirculation of the fetus; this would seem to be demonstrated by\r\nmercury, which was always found in the placenta and never in the fetal\r\norgans. In poisoning by lead and copper the accumulation of the poison\r\nin the fetal tissues is greater than in the maternal, perhaps from\r\ndifferences in assimilation and disassimilation or from greater\r\ndiffusion. Whilst it is not an impermeable barrier to the passage of\r\npoisons, the placenta offers a varying degree of obstruction: it allows\r\ncopper and lead to pass easily, arsenic with greater difficulty. The\r\naccumulation of toxic substances in the fetus does not follow the same\r\nlaw as in the adult. They diffuse more widely in the fetus. In the\r\nadult the liver is the chief accumulatory organ. Arsenic, which in the\r\nmother elects to accumulate in the liver, is in the fetus stored up in\r\nthe skin; copper accumulates in the fetal liver, central nervous\r\nsystem, and sometimes in the skin; lead which is found specially in the\r\nmaternal liver, but also in the skin, has been observed in the skin,\r\nliver, nervous centers, and elsewhere in the fetus. The frequent\r\npresence of poisons in the fetal skin demonstrates its physiologic\r\nimportance. It has probably not a very marked influence on its health.\r\nOn the contrary, accumulation in the placenta and nerve centers\r\nexplains the pathogenesis of abortion and the birth of dead fetuses\r\n(\"mortinatatite\") Copper and lead did not cause abortion, but mercury\r\ndid so in two out of six cases. Arsenic is a powerful abortive agent in\r\nthe guinea-pig, probably on account of placental hemorrhages. An\r\nimportant deduction is that whilst the placenta is frequently and\r\nseriously affected in syphilis, it is also the special seat for the\r\naccumulation of mercury. May this not explain its therapeutic action in\r\nthis disease? The marked accumulation of lead in the central nervous\r\nsystem of the fetus explains the frequency and serious character of\r\nsaturnine encephalopathic lesions. The presence of arsenic in the fetal\r\nskin alone gives an explanation of the therapeutic results of the\r\nadministration of this substance in skin diseases.\r\n\r\nIntrauterine amputations are of interest to the medical man,\r\nparticularly those cases in which the accident has happened in early\r\npregnancy and the child is born with a very satisfactory and clean\r\nstump. Montgomery, in an excellent paper, advances the theory, which is\r\nvery plausible, that intrauterine amputations are caused by contraction\r\nof bands or membranes of organized lymph encircling the limb and\r\nproducing amputation by the same process of disjunctive atrophy that\r\nthe surgeons induce by ligature. Weinlechner speaks of a case in which\r\na man devoid of all four extremities was exhibited before the Vienna\r\nMedical Society. The amputations were congenital, and on the right side\r\nthere was a very small stump of the upper arm remaining, admitting the\r\nattachment of an artificial apparatus. He was twenty-seven years old,\r\nand able to write, to thread a needle, pour water out of a bottle, etc.\r\nCook speaks of a female child born of Indian parents, the fourth birth\r\nof a mother twenty-six years old. The child weighed 5 1/2 pounds; the\r\ncircumference of the head was 14 inches and that of the trunk 13\r\ninches. The upper extremities consisted of perfect shoulder joints, but\r\nonly 1/4 of each humerus was present. Both sides showed evidences of\r\namputation, the cicatrix on the right side being 1 inch long and on the\r\nleft 1/4 inch long. The right lower limb was merely a fleshy corpuscle\r\n3/4 inch wide and 1/4 inch long; to the posterior edge was attached a\r\nbody resembling the little toe of a newly-born infant. On the left side\r\nthe limb was represented by a fleshy corpuscle 1 inch long and 1/4 inch\r\nin circumference, resembling the great toe of an infant. There was no\r\nhistory of shock or injury to the mother. The child presented by the\r\nbreech, and by the absence of limbs caused much difficulty in\r\ndiagnosis.  The three stages of labor were one and one-half hours,\r\nforty-five minutes, and five minutes, respectively. The accompanying\r\nillustration shows the appearance of the limbs at the time of report.\r\n\r\nFigure 10 represents a negro boy, the victim of intrauterine\r\namputation, who learned to utilize his toes for many purposes.  The\r\nillustration shows his mode of holding his pen.\r\n\r\nThere is an instance reported in which a child at full term was born\r\nwith an amputated arm, and at the age of seventeen the stump was\r\nscarcely if at all smaller than the other. Blake speaks of a case of\r\ncongenital amputation of both the upper extremities.  Gillilam a\r\nmentions a case that shows the deleterious influence of even the weight\r\nof a fetal limb resting on a cord or band. His case was that of a\r\nfetus, the product of a miscarriage of traumatic origin; the soft\r\ntissues were almost cut through and the bone denuded by the limb\r\nresting on one of the two umbilical cords, not encircling it, but in a\r\nsling. The cord was deeply imbedded in the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe coilings of the cord are not limited to compression about the\r\nextremities alone, but may even decapitate the head by being firmly\r\nwrapped several times about the neck. According to Ballantyne, there is\r\nin the treatise De Octimestri Partu, by Hippocrates, a reference to\r\ncoiling of the umbilical cord round the neck of the fetus. This coiling\r\nwas, indeed, regarded as one of the dangers of the eighth month, and\r\neven the mode of its production is described. It is said that if the\r\ncord he extended along one side of the uterus, and the fetus lie more\r\nto the other side, then when the culbute is performed the funis must\r\nnecessarily form a loop round the neck or chest of the infant. If it\r\nremain in this position, it is further stated, the mother will suffer\r\nlater and the fetus will either perish or be born with difficulty. If\r\nthe Hippocratic writers knew that this coiling is sometimes quite\r\ninnocuous, they did not in any place state the fact.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations show the different ways in which the\r\nfunis may be coiled, the coils sometimes being as many as 8.\r\n\r\nBizzen mentions an instance in which from strangulation the head of a\r\nfetus was in a state of putrefaction, the funis being twice tightly\r\nbound around the neck. Cleveland, Cuthbert, and Germain report\r\nanalogous instances. Matthyssens observed the twisting of the funis\r\nabout the arm and neck of a fetus the body of which was markedly\r\nwasted. There was complete absence of amniotic fluid during labor.\r\nBlumenthal presented to the New York Pathological Society an ovum\r\nwithin which the fetus was under going intrauterine decapitation.\r\nBuchanan describes a case illustrative of the etiology of spontaneous\r\namputation of limbs in utero Nebinger reports a case of abortion,\r\nshowing commencing amputation of the left thigh from being encircled by\r\nthe funis.  The death of the fetus was probably due to compression of\r\nthe cord. Owen mentions an instance in which the left arm and hand of a\r\nfetus were found in a state of putrescence from strangulation, the\r\nfunis being tightly bound around at the upper part. Simpson published\r\nan article on spontaneous amputation of the forearm and rudimentary\r\nregeneration of the hand in the fetus. Among other contributors to this\r\nsubject are Avery, Boncour, Brown, Ware, Wrangell, Young, Nettekoven,\r\nMartin, Macan, Leopold, Hecker, Gunther, and Friedinger.\r\n\r\nWygodzky finds that the greatest number of coils of the umbilical cord\r\never found to encircle a fetus are 7 (Baudelocque), 8 (Crede), and 9\r\n(Muller and Gray). His own case was observed this year in Wilna. The\r\npatient was a primipara aged twenty. The last period was seen on May\r\n10, 1894. On February 19th the fetal movements suddenly ceased. On the\r\n20th pains set in about two weeks before term. At noon turbid liquor\r\namnii escaped. At 2 P.M., on examination, Wygodzky defined a dead fetus\r\nin left occipito-anterior presentation, very high in the inlet. The os\r\nwas nearly completely dilated, the pains strong. By 4 P.M. the head was\r\nhardly engaged in the pelvic cavity. At 7 P.M. it neared the outlet at\r\nthe height of each pain, but retracted immediately afterward. After 10\r\nP.M. the pains grew weak. At midnight Wygodzky delivered the dead child\r\nby expression. Not till then was the cause of delay clear. The funis\r\nwas very tense and coiled 7 times round the neck and once round the\r\nleft shoulder; there was also a distinct knot. It measured over 65\r\ninches in length.  The fetus was a male, slightly macerated. It weighed\r\nover 5 pounds, and was easily delivered entire after division and\r\nunwinding of the funis. No marks remained on the neck. The placenta\r\nfollowed ten minutes later and, so far as naked-eye experience\r\nindicated, seemed healthy.\r\n\r\nIntrauterine fractures are occasionally seen, but are generally the\r\nresults of traumatism or of some extraordinary muscular efforts on the\r\npart of the mother. A blow on the abdomen or a fall may cause them. The\r\nmost interesting cases are those in which the fractures are multiple\r\nand the causes unknown.  Spontaneous fetal fractures have been\r\ndiscussed thoroughly, and the reader is referred to any responsible\r\ntext-book for the theories of causation. Atkinson, De Luna, and Keller\r\nreport intrauterine fractures of the clavicle. Filippi contributes an\r\nextensive paper on the medicolegal aspect of a case of intrauterine\r\nfracture of the os cranium. Braun of Vienna reports a case of\r\nintrauterine fracture of the humerus and femur.  Rodrigue describes a\r\ncase of fracture and dislocation of the humerus of a fetus in utero.\r\nGaultier reports an instance of fracture of both femora intrauterine.\r\nStanley, Vanderveer, and Young cite instances of intrauterine fracture\r\nof the thigh; in the case of Stanley the fracture occurred during the\r\nlast week of gestation, and there was rapid union of the fragments\r\nduring lactation. Danyau, Proudfoot, and Smith mention intrauterine\r\nfracture of the tibia; in Proudfoot's case there was congenital talipes\r\ntalus.\r\n\r\nDolbeau describes an instance in which multiple fractures were found in\r\na fetus, some of which were evidently postpartum, while others were\r\nassuredly antepartum. Hirschfeld describes a fetus showing congenital\r\nmultiple fractures. Gross speaks of a wonderful case of Chaupier in\r\nwhich no less than 113 fractures were discovered in a child at birth.\r\nIt survived twenty-four hours, and at the postmortem examination it was\r\nfound that some were already solid, some uniting, whilst others were\r\nrecent. It often happens that the intrauterine fracture is well united\r\nat birth. There seems to be a peculiar predisposition of the bones to\r\nfracture in the cases in which the fractures are multiple and the cause\r\nis not apparent.\r\n\r\nThe results to the fetus of injuries to the pregnant mother are most\r\ndiversified. In some instances the marvelous escape of any serious\r\nconsequences of one or both is almost incredible, while in others the\r\nslightest injury is fatal. Guillemont cites the instance of a woman who\r\nwas killed by a stroke of lightning, but whose fetus was saved; while\r\nFabricius Hildanus describes a case in which there was perforation of\r\nthe head, fracture of the skull, and a wound of the groin, due to\r\nsudden starting and agony of terror of the mother. Here there was not\r\nthe slightest history of any external violence.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that injuries to the pregnant mother show\r\nvisible effects on the person of the fetus. The older writers kept a\r\ncareful record of the anomalous and extraordinary injuries of this\r\ncharacter and of their effects. Brendelius tells us of hemorrhage from\r\nthe mouth and nose of the fetus occasioned by the fall of the mother;\r\nBuchner mentions a case of fracture of the cranium from fright of the\r\nmother; Reuther describes a contusion of the os sacrum and abdomen in\r\nthe mother from a fall, with fracture of the arm and leg of the fetus\r\nfrom the same cause; Sachse speaks of a fractured tibia in a fetus,\r\ncaused by a fall of the mother; Slevogt relates an instance of rupture\r\nof the abdomen of a fetus by a fall of the mother; the Ephemerides\r\ncontains accounts of injuries to the fetus of this nature, and among\r\nothers mentions a stake as having been thrust into a fetus in utero;\r\nVerduc offers several examples, one a dislocation of the fetal foot\r\nfrom a maternal fall; Plocquet gives an instance of fractured femur;\r\nWalther describes a case of dislocation of the vertebrae from a fall;\r\nand there is also a case of a fractured fetal vertebra from a maternal\r\nfall. There is recorded a fetal scalp injury, together with clotted\r\nblood in the hair, after a fall of the mother: Autenrieth describes a\r\nwound of the pregnant uterus, which had no fatal issue, and there is\r\nalso another similar case on record.\r\n\r\nThe modern records are much more interesting and wonderful on this\r\nsubject than the older ones. Richardson speaks of a woman falling down\r\na few weeks before her delivery. Her pelvis was roomy and the birth was\r\neasy; but the infant was found to have extensive wounds on the back,\r\nreaching from the 3d dorsal vertebra across the scapula, along the back\r\nof the humerus, to within a short distance of the elbow. Part of these\r\nwounds were cicatrized and part still granulating, which shows that the\r\nprocess of reparation is as active in utero as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nInjuries about the genitalia would naturally be expected to exercise\r\nsome active influence on the uterine contents; but there are many\r\ninstances reported in which the escape of injury is marvelous. Gibb\r\nspeaks of a woman, about eight months pregnant, who fell across a\r\nchair, lacerating her genitals and causing an escape of liquor amnii.\r\nThere was regeneration of this fluid and delivery beyond term. The\r\nlabor was tedious and took place two and a half months after the\r\naccident. The mother and the female child did well. Purcell reports\r\ndeath in a pregnant woman from contused wound of the vulva. Morland\r\nrelates an instance of a woman in the fifth month of her second\r\npregnancy, who fell on the roof of a woodshed by slipping from one of\r\nthe steps by which she ascended to the roof, in the act of hanging out\r\nsome clothes to dry. She suffered a wound on the internal surface of\r\nthe left nympha 1 1/2 inch long and 1/2 inch deep. She had lost about\r\nthree quarts of blood, and had applied ashes to the vagina to stop the\r\nbleeding. She made a recovery by the twelfth day, and the fetal sounds\r\nwere plainly audible. Cullingworth speaks of a woman who, during a\r\nquarrel with her husband, was pushed away and fell between two chairs,\r\nknocking one of them over, and causing a trivial wound one inch long in\r\nthe vagina, close to the entrance.  She screamed, there was a gush of\r\nblood, and she soon died. The uterus contained a fetus three or four\r\nmonths old, with the membranes intact, the maternal death being due to\r\nthe varicosity of the pregnant pudenda, the slight injury being\r\nsufficient to produce fatal hemorrhage. Carhart describes the case of a\r\npregnant woman, who, while in the stooping position, milking a cow, was\r\nimpaled through the vagina by another cow. The child was born seven\r\ndays later, with its skull crushed by the cow's horn.  The horn had\r\nentered the vagina, carrying the clothing with it.\r\n\r\nThere are some marvelous cases of recovery and noninterference with\r\npregnancy after injuries from horns of cattle. Corey speaks of a woman\r\nof thirty-five, three months pregnant, weighing 135 pounds, who was\r\nhorned by a cow through the abdominal parietes near the hypogastric\r\nregion; she was lifted into the air, carried, and tossed on the ground\r\nby the infuriated animal. There was a wound consisting of a ragged rent\r\nfrom above the os pubis, extending obliquely to the left and upward,\r\nthrough which protruded the great omentum, the descending and\r\ntransverse colon, most of the small intestines, as well as the pyloric\r\nextremity of the stomach. The great omentum was mangled and comminuted,\r\nand bore two lacerations of two inches each. The intestines and stomach\r\nwere not injured, but there was considerable extravasation of blood\r\ninto the abdominal cavity. The intestines were cleansed and an\r\nunsuccessful attempt was made to replace them. The intestines remained\r\noutside of the body for two hours, and the great omentum was carefully\r\nspread out over the chest to prevent interference with the efforts to\r\nreturn the intestines.  The patient remained conscious and calm\r\nthroughout; finally deep anesthesia was produced by ether and\r\nchloroform, three and a half hours after the accident, and in twenty\r\nminutes the intestines were all replaced in the abdominal cavity. The\r\nedges were pared, sutured, and the wound dressed. The woman was placed\r\nin bed, on the right side, and morphin was administered. The sutures\r\nwere removed on the ninth day, and the wound had healed except at the\r\npoint of penetration. The woman was discharged twenty days after, and,\r\nincredible to relate, was delivered of a well-developed, full-term\r\nchild just two hundred and two days from the time of the accident. Both\r\nthe mother and child did well.\r\n\r\nLuce speaks of a pregnant woman who was horned in the lower part of the\r\nabdomen by a cow, and had a subsequent protrusion of the intestines\r\nthrough the wound. After some minor complications, the wound healed\r\nfourteen weeks after the accident, and the woman was confined in\r\nnatural labor of a healthy, vigorous child. In this case no blood was\r\nfound on the cow's horn, and the clothing was not torn, so that the\r\nwound must have been made by the side of the horn striking the greatly\r\ndistended abdomen.\r\n\r\nRichard, quoted also by Tiffany, speaks of a woman, twenty-two, who\r\nfell in a dark cellar with some empty bottles in her hand, suffering a\r\nwound in the abdomen 2 inches above the navel on the left side 8 cm.\r\nlong. Through this wound a mass of intestines, the size of a man's\r\nhead, protruded. Both the mother and the child made a good\r\nconvalescence. Harris cites the instance of a woman of thirty, a\r\nmultipara, six months pregnant, who was gored by a cow; her intestines\r\nand omentum protruded through the rip and the uterus was bruised. There\r\nwas rapid recovery and delivery at term. Wetmore of Illinois saw a\r\nwoman who in the summer of 1860, when about six months pregnant, was\r\ngored by a cow, and the large intestine and the omentum protruded\r\nthrough the wound.  Three hours after the injury she was found swathed\r\nin rags wet with a compound solution of whiskey and camphor, with a\r\ndecoction of tobacco. The intestines were cold to the touch and dirty,\r\nbut were washed and replaced. The abdomen was sewed up with a darning\r\nneedle and black linen thread; the woman recovered and bore a healthy\r\nchild at the full maturity of her gestation. Crowdace speaks of a\r\nfemale pauper, six months pregnant, who was attacked by a buffalo, and\r\nsuffered a wound about 1 1/2 inch long and 1/2 inch wide just above the\r\numbilicus. Through this small opening 19 inches of intestine protruded.\r\nThe woman recovered, and the fetal heart-beats could be readily\r\nauscultated.\r\n\r\nMajor accidents in pregnant women are often followed by the happiest\r\nresults. There seems to be no limit to what the pregnant uterus can\r\nsuccessfully endure. Tiffany, who has collected some statistics on this\r\nsubject, as well as on operations successfully performed during\r\npregnancy, which will be considered later, quotes the account of a\r\nwoman of twenty-seven, eight months pregnant, who was almost buried\r\nunder a clay wall. She received terrible wounds about the head, 32\r\nsutures being used in this location alone. Subsequently she was\r\nconfined, easily bore a perfectly normal female child, and both did\r\nwell. Sibois describes the case of a woman weighing 190 pounds, who\r\nfell on her head from the top of a wall from 10 to 12 feet high. For\r\nseveral hours she exhibited symptoms of fracture of the base of the\r\nskull, and the case was so diagnosed; fourteen hours after the accident\r\nshe was perfectly conscious and suffered terrible pain about the head,\r\nneck, and shoulders. Two days later an ovum of about twenty days was\r\nexpelled, and seven months after she was delivered of a healthy boy\r\nweighing 10 1/2 pounds. She had therefore lost after the accident\r\none-half of a double conception.\r\n\r\nVerrier has collected the results of traumatism during pregnancy, and\r\nsummarizes 61 cases. Prowzowsky cites the instance of a patient in the\r\neighth month of her first pregnancy who was wounded by many pieces of\r\nlead pipe fired from a gun but a few feet distant. Neither the patient\r\nnor the child suffered materially from the accident, and gestation\r\nproceeded; the child died on the fourth day after birth without\r\napparent cause. Milner records an instance of remarkable tolerance of\r\ninjury in a pregnant woman. During her six months of pregnancy the\r\npatient was accidentally shot through the abdominal cavity and lower\r\npart of the thorax. The missile penetrated the central tendon of the\r\ndiaphragm and lodged in the lung. The injury was limited by localized\r\npneumonia and peritonitis, and the wound was drained through the lung\r\nby free expectoration. Recovery ensued, the patient giving birth to a\r\nhealthy child sixteen weeks later.  Belin mentions a stab-wound in a\r\npregnant woman from which a considerable portion of the epiploon\r\nprotruded. Sloughing ensued, but the patient made a good recovery,\r\ngestation not being interrupted. Fancon describes the case of a woman\r\nwho had an injury to the knee requiring drainage. She was attacked by\r\nerysipelas, which spread over the whole body with the exception of the\r\nhead and neck; yet her pregnancy was uninterrupted and recovery ensued.\r\nFancon also speaks of a girl of nineteen, frightened by her lover, who\r\nthreatened to stab her, who jumped from a second-story window. For\r\nthree days after the fall she had a slight bloody flow from the vulva.\r\nAlthough she was six months pregnant there was no interruption of the\r\nnormal course of gestation.\r\n\r\nBancroft speaks of a woman who, being mistaken for a burglar, was shot\r\nby her husband with a 44-caliber bullet. The missile entered the second\r\nand third ribs an inch from the sternum, passed through the right lung,\r\nand escaped at the inferior angle of the scapula, about three inches\r\nbelow the spine; after leaving her body it went through a pine door.\r\nShe suffered much hemorrhage and shock, but made a fair recovery at the\r\nend of four weeks, though pregnant with her first child at the seventh\r\nmonth. At full term she was delivered by foot-presentation of a healthy\r\nboy. The mother at the time of report was healthy and free from cough,\r\nand was nursing her babe, which was strong and bright.\r\n\r\nAll the cases do not have as happy an issue as most of the foregoing\r\nones, though in some the results are not so bad as might be expected. A\r\nGerman female, thirty-six, while in the sixth month of pregnancy, fell\r\nand struck her abdomen on a tub.  She was delivered of a normal living\r\nchild, with the exception that the helix of the left ear was pushed\r\nanteriorly, and had, in its middle, a deep incision, which also\r\ntraversed the antihelix and the tragus, and continued over the cheek\r\ntoward the nose, where it terminated. The external auditory meatus was\r\nobliterated. Gurlt speaks of a woman, seven months pregnant, who fell\r\nfrom the top of a ladder, subsequently losing some blood and water from\r\nthe vagina. She had also persistent pains in the belly, but there was\r\nno deterioration of general health. At her confinement, which was\r\nnormal, a strong boy was born, wanting the arm below the middle, at\r\nwhich point a white bone protruded. The wound healed and the separated\r\narm came away after birth.  Wainwright relates the instance of a woman\r\nof forty, who when six months pregnant was run over by railway cars.\r\nAfter a double amputation of the legs she miscarried and made a good\r\nrecovery.  Neugebauer reported the history of a case of a woman who,\r\nwhile near her term of pregnancy, committed suicide by jumping from a\r\nwindow. She ruptured her uterus, and a dead child with a fracture of\r\nthe parietal bone was found in the abdominal cavity. Staples speaks of\r\na Swede of twenty-eight, of Minnesota, who was accidentally shot by a\r\nyoung man riding by her side in a wagon.  The ball entered the abdomen\r\ntwo inches above the crest of the right ilium, a little to the rear of\r\nthe anterior superior spinous process, and took a downward and forward\r\ncourse. A little shock was felt but no serious symptoms followed. In\r\nforty hours there was delivery of a dead child with a bullet in its\r\nabdomen.  Labor was normal and the internal recovery complete. Von\r\nChelius, quoting the younger Naegele, gives a remarkable instance of a\r\nyoung peasant of thirty-five, the mother of four children, pregnant\r\nwith the fifth child, who was struck on the belly violently by a blow\r\nfrom a wagon pole. She was thrown down, and felt a tearing pain which\r\ncaused her to faint. It was found that the womb had been ruptured and\r\nthe child killed, for in several days it was delivered in a putrid\r\nmass, partly through the natural passage and partly through an abscess\r\nopening in the abdominal wall. The woman made a good recovery. A\r\ncurious accident of pregnancy is that of a woman of thirty-eight,\r\nadvanced eight months in her ninth pregnancy, who after eating a hearty\r\nmeal was seized by a violent pain in the region of the stomach and soon\r\nafterward with convulsions, supposed to have been puerperal. She died\r\nin a few hours, and at the autopsy it was found that labor had not\r\nbegun, but that the pregnancy had caused a laceration of the spleen,\r\nfrom which had escaped four or five pints of blood. Edge speaks of a\r\ncase of chorea in pregnancy in a woman of twenty-seven, not\r\ninterrupting pregnancy or retarding safe delivery. This had continued\r\nfor four pregnancies, but in the fourth abortion took place.\r\n\r\nBuzzard had a case of nervous tremor in a woman, following a fall at\r\nher fourth month of pregnancy, who at term gave birth to a male child\r\nthat was idiotic. Beatty relates a curious accident to a fetus in\r\nutero. The woman was in her first confinement and was delivered of a\r\nsmall but healthy and strong boy. There was a small puncture in the\r\nabdominal parietes, through which the whole of the intestines protruded\r\nand were constricted. The opening was so small that he had to enlarge\r\nit with a bistoury to replace the bowel, which was dark and congested;\r\nhe sutured the wound with silver wire, but the child subsequently died.\r\n\r\nTiffany of Baltimore has collected excellent statistics of operations\r\nduring pregnancy; and Mann of Buffalo has done the same work, limiting\r\nhimself to operations on the pelvic organs, where interference is\r\nsupposed to have been particularly contraindicated in pregnancy. Mann,\r\nafter giving his individual cases, makes the following summary and\r\nconclusions:--\r\n\r\n(1) Pregnancy is not a general bar to operations, as has been supposed.\r\n\r\n(2) Union of the denuded surfaces is the rule, and the cicatricial\r\ntissue, formed during the earlier months of pregnancy, is strong enough\r\nto resist the shock of labor at term.\r\n\r\n(3) Operations on the vulva are of little danger to mother or child.\r\n\r\n(4) Operations on the vagina are liable to cause severe hemorrhage, but\r\notherwise are not dangerous.\r\n\r\n(5) Venereal vegetations or warts are best treated by removal.\r\n\r\n(6) Applications of silver nitrate or astringents may be safely made to\r\nthe vagina. For such application, phenol or iodin should not be used,\r\npure or in strong solution.\r\n\r\n(7) Operations on the bladder or urethra are not dangerous or liable to\r\nbe followed by abortion.\r\n\r\n(8) Operations for vesicovaginal fistulae should not be done, as they\r\nare dangerous, and are liable to be followed by much hemorrhage and\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n(9) Plastic operations may be done in the earlier months of pregnancy\r\nwith fair prospects of a safe and successful issue.\r\n\r\n(10) Small polypi may be treated by torsion or astringents. If cut,\r\nthere is likely to be a subsequent abortion.\r\n\r\n(11) Large polypi removed toward the close of pregnancy will cause\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\n(12) Carcinoma of the cervix should be removed at once.\r\n\r\nA few of the examples on record of operations during pregnancy of\r\nspecial interest, will be given below. Polaillon speaks of a double\r\novariotomy on a woman pregnant at three months, with the subsequent\r\nbirth of a living child at term. Gordon reports five successful\r\novariotomies during pregnancy, in Lebedeff's clinic.  Of these cases, 1\r\naborted on the fifth day, 2 on the fifteenth, and the other 2 continued\r\nuninterrupted. He collected 204 cases with a mortality of only 3 per\r\ncent; 22 per cent aborted, and 69.4 per cent were delivered at full\r\nterm. Kreutzman reports two cases in which ovarian tumors were\r\nsuccessfully removed from pregnant subjects without the interruption of\r\ngestation. One of these women, a secundipara, had gone two weeks over\r\ntime, and had a large ovarian cyst, the pedicle of which had become\r\ntwisted, the fluid in the cyst being sanguineous. May describes an\r\novariotomy performed during pregnancy at Tottenham Hospital. The woman,\r\naged twenty-two, was pale, diminutive in size, and showed an enormous\r\nabdomen, which measured 50 inches in circumference at the umbilicus and\r\n27 inches from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes. At the operation,\r\n36 pints of brown fluid were drawn off.  Delivery took place twelve\r\nhours after the operation, the mother recovering, but the child was\r\nlost. Galabin had a case of ovariotomy performed on a woman in the\r\nsixth month of pregnancy without interruption of pregnancy; Potter had\r\na case of double ovariotomy with safe delivery at term; and Storry had\r\na similar case. Jacobson cites a case of vaginal lithotomy in a patient\r\nsix and a half months pregnant, with normal delivery at full term.\r\nTiffany quotes Keelan's description of a woman of thirty-five, in the\r\neighth month of pregnancy, from whom he removed a stone weighing 12 1/2\r\nounces and measuring 2 by 2 1/2 inches, with subsequent recovery and\r\ncontinuation of pregnancy. Rydygier mentions a case of obstruction of\r\nthe intestine during the sixth month of gestation, showing symptoms of\r\nstrangulation for seven days, in which he performed abdominal section.\r\nRecovery of the woman without abortion ensued. The Revue de Chirurgien\r\n1887, contains an account of a woman who suffered internal\r\nstrangulation, on whom celiotomy was performed; she recovered in\r\ntwenty-five days, and did not miscarry, which shows that severe injury\r\nto the intestine with operative interference does not necessarily\r\ninterrupt pregnancy. Gilmore, without inducing abortion, extirpated the\r\nkidney of a negress, aged thirty-three, for severe and constant pain.\r\nTiffany removed the kidney of a woman of twenty-seven, five months\r\npregnant, without interruption of this or subsequent pregnancies. The\r\nchild was living. He says that Fancon cites instances of operation\r\nwithout abortion.\r\n\r\nLovort describes an enucleation of the eye in the second month of\r\npregnancy. Pilcher cites the instance of a woman of fifty-eight, eight\r\nmonths in her fourth pregnancy, whose breast and axilla he removed\r\nwithout interruption of pregnancy. Robson, Polaillon, and Coen report\r\nsimilar instances.\r\n\r\nRein speaks of the removal of an enormous echinococcus cyst of the\r\nomentum without interruption of pregnancy. Robson reports a\r\nmulti-locular cyst of the ovary with extensive adhesions of the uterus,\r\nremoved at the tenth week of pregnancy and ovariotomy performed without\r\nany interruption of the ordinary course of labor. Russell cites the\r\ninstance of a woman who was successfully tapped at the sixth month of\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\nMcLean speaks of a successful amputation during pregnancy; Napper, one\r\nof the arm; Nicod, one of the arm; Russell, an amputation through the\r\nshoulder joint for an injury during pregnancy, with delivery and\r\nrecovery; and Vesey speaks of amputation for compound fracture of the\r\narm, labor following ten hours afterward with recovery. Keen reports\r\nthe successful performance of a hip-joint amputation for malignant\r\ndisease of the femur during pregnancy. The patient, who was five months\r\nadvanced in gestation, recovered without aborting.\r\n\r\nRobson reports a case of strangulated hernia in the third month of\r\npregnancy with stercoraceous vomiting. He performed herniotomy in the\r\nfemoral region, and there was a safe delivery at full term. In the\r\nsecond month of pregnancy he also rotated an ovarian tumor causing\r\nacute symptoms and afterward performed ovariotomy without interfering\r\nwith pregnancy. Mann quotes Munde in speaking of an instance of removal\r\nof elephantiasis of the vulva without interrupting pregnancy, and says\r\nthat there are many cases of the removal of venereal warts without any\r\ninterference with gestation. Campbell of Georgia operated inadvertently\r\nat the second and third month in two cases of vesicovaginal fistula in\r\npregnant women. The first case showed no interruption of pregnancy, but\r\nin the second case the woman nearly died and the fistula remained\r\nunhealed. Engelmann operated on a large rectovaginal fistula in the\r\nsixth month of pregnancy without any interruption of pregnancy, which\r\nis far from the general result.  Cazin and Rey both produced abortion\r\nby forcible dilatation of the anus for fissure, but Gayet used both the\r\nfingers and a speculum in a case at five months and the woman went to\r\nterm. By cystotomy Reamy removed a double hair-pin from a woman\r\npregnant six and a half months, without interruption, and according to\r\nMann again, McClintock extracted stones from the bladder by the urethra\r\nin the fourth month of pregnancy, and Phillips did the same in the\r\nseventh month. Hendenberg and Packard report the removal of a tumor\r\nweighing 8 3/4 pounds from a pregnant uterus without interrupting\r\ngestation.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the University Medical Magazine of\r\nPhiladelphia illustrates the after-effects of abdominal hysteropasy on\r\nsubsequent pregnancies:--\r\n\r\n\"Fraipont (Annales de la Societe Medico-Chirurgicale de Liege, 1894)\r\nreports four cases where pregnancy and labor were practically normal,\r\nthough the uterus of each patient had been fixed to the abdominal\r\nwalls. In two of the cases the hysteropexy had been performed over five\r\nyears before the pregnancy occurred, and, although the bands of\r\nadhesion between the fundus and the parietes must have become very\r\ntough after so long a period, no special difficulty was encountered. In\r\ntwo of the cases the forceps was used, but not on account of uterine\r\ninertia; the fetal head was voluminous, and in one of the two cases\r\ninternal rotation was delayed. The placenta was always expelled easily,\r\nand no serious postpartum hemorrhage occurred. Fraipont observed the\r\nprogress of pregnancy in several of these cases. The uterus does not\r\nincrease specially in its posterior part, but quite uniformly, so that,\r\nas might be expected, the fundus gradually detaches itself from the\r\nabdominal wall. Even if the adhesions were not broken down they would\r\nof necessity be so stretched as to be useless for their original\r\npurpose after delivery. Bands of adhesion could not share in the\r\nprocess of involution. As, however, the uterus undergoes perfect\r\ninvolution, it is restored to its original condition before the onset\r\nof the disease which rendered hysteropexy necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThe coexistence of an extensive tumor of the uterus with pregnancy does\r\nnot necessarily mean that the product of conception will be blighted.\r\nBrochin speaks of a case in which pregnancy was complicated with\r\nfibroma of the uterus, the accouchement being natural at term. Byrne\r\nmentions a case of pregnancy complicated with a large uterine fibroid.\r\nDelivery was effected at full term, and although there was considerable\r\nhemorrhage the mother recovered. Ingleby describes a case of fibrous\r\ntumor of the uterus terminating fatally, but not until three weeks\r\nafter delivery. Lusk mentions a case of pregnancy with fibrocystic\r\ntumor of the uterus occluding the cervix. At the appearance of symptoms\r\nof eclampsia version was performed and delivery effected, followed by\r\npostpartum hemorrhage. The mother died from peritonitis and collapse,\r\nbut the stillborn child was resuscitated. Roberts reports a case of\r\npregnancy associated with a large fibrocellular polypus of the uterus.\r\nA living child was delivered at the seventh month, ecrasement was\r\nperformed, and the mother recovered.\r\n\r\nVon Quast speaks of a fibromyoma removed five days after labor.  Gervis\r\nreports the removal of a large polypus of the uterus on the fifth day\r\nafter confinement. Davis describes the spontaneous expulsion of a large\r\npolypus two days after the delivery of a fine, healthy, male child.\r\nDeason mentions a case of anomalous tumor of the uterus during\r\npregnancy which was expelled after the birth of the child; and Daly\r\nalso speaks of a tumor expelled from the uterus after delivery. Cathell\r\nspeaks of a case of pregnancy complicated with both uterine fibroids\r\nand measles. Other cases of a similar nature to the foregoing are too\r\nnumerous to mention.  Figure 13, taken from Spiegelberg, shows a large\r\nfibroid blocking the pelvis of a pregnant woman.\r\n\r\nThere are several peculiar accidents and anomalies not previously\r\nmentioned which deserve a place here, viz., those of the membranes\r\nsurrounding the fetus. Brown speaks of protrusion of the membranes from\r\nthe vulva several weeks before confinement.  Davies relates an instance\r\nin which there was a copious watery discharge during pregnancy not\r\nfollowed by labor. There is a case mentioned in which an accident and\r\nan inopportune dose of ergot at the fifth month of pregnancy were\r\nfollowed by rupture of the amniotic sac, and subsequently a constant\r\nflow of watery fluid continued for the remaining three months of\r\npregnancy. The fetus died at the time, and was born in an advanced\r\nstate of putrefaction, by version, three months after the accident. The\r\nmother died five months after of carcinoma of the uterus.  Montgomery\r\nreports the instance of a woman who menstruated last on May 22, 1850,\r\nand quickened on September 26th, and continued well until the 11th of\r\nNovember. At this time, as she was retiring, she became conscious that\r\nthere was a watery discharge from the vagina, which proved to be liquor\r\namnii. Her health was good. The discharge continued, her size\r\nincreased, and the motions of the child continued active. On the 18th\r\nof January a full-sized eight months' child was born. It had an\r\nincessant, wailing, low cry, always of evil augury in new-born infants.\r\nThe child died shortly after. The daily discharge was about 5 ounces,\r\nand had lasted sixty-eight days, making 21 pints in all. The same\r\naccident of rupture of the membranes long before labor happened to the\r\npatient's mother.\r\n\r\nBardt speaks of labor twenty-three days after the flow of the waters;\r\nand Cobleigh one of seventeen days; Bradley relates the history of a\r\ncase of rupture of the membranes six weeks before delivery. Rains cites\r\nan instance in which gestation continued three months after rupture of\r\nthe membranes, the labor-pains lasting thirty-six hours. Griffiths\r\nspeaks of rupture of the amniotic sac at about the sixth month of\r\npregnancy with no untoward interruption of the completion of gestation\r\nand with delivery of a living child. There is another observation of an\r\naccouchement terminating successfully twenty-three days after the loss\r\nof the amniotic fluid. Campbell mentions delivery of a living child\r\ntwelve days after rupture of the membranes. Chesney relates the history\r\nof a double collection of waters. Wood reports a case in which there\r\nwas expulsion of a bag of waters before the rupture of the membranes.\r\nBailly, Chestnut, Bjering, Cowger, Duncan, and others also record\r\npremature rupture of the membranes without interruption of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nHarris gives an instance of the membranes being expelled from the\r\nuterus a few days before delivery at the full term. Chatard, Jr.,\r\nmentions extrusion of the fetal membranes at the seventh month of\r\npregnancy while the patient was taking a long afternoon walk, their\r\nsubsequent retraction, and normal labor at term. Thurston tells of a\r\ncase in which Nature had apparently effected the separation of the\r\nplacenta without alarming hemorrhage, the ease being one of placenta\r\npraevia, terminating favorably by natural processes. Playfair speaks of\r\nthe detachment of the uterine decidua without the interruption of\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\nGuerrant gives a unique example of normal birth at full term in which\r\nthe placenta was found in the vagina, but not a vestige of the\r\nmembranes was noticed. The patient had experienced nothing unusual\r\nuntil within three months of expected confinement, since which time\r\nthere had been a daily loss of water from the uterus.  She recovered\r\nand was doing her work. There was no possibility that this was a case\r\nof retained secundines.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Umbilical Cord.--Absence of the membranes has its\r\ncounterpart in the deficiency of the umbilical cord, so frequently\r\nnoticed in old reports. The Ephemerides, Osiander, Stark's Archives,\r\nThiebault, van der Wiel, Chatton, and Schurig all speak of it, and it\r\nhas been noticed since. Danthez speaks of the development of a fetus in\r\nspite of the absence of an umbilical cord. Stute reports an observation\r\nof total absence of the umbilical cord, with placental insertion near\r\nthe cervix of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThere is mentioned a bifid funis. The Ephemerides and van der Wiel\r\nspeak of a duplex funis. Nolde reports a cord 38 inches long; and\r\nWerner cites the instance of a funis 51 inches long.  There are modern\r\ninstances in which the funis has been bifid or duplex, and there is\r\nalso a case reported in which there were two cords in a twin pregnancy,\r\neach of them measuring five feet in length. The Lancet gives the\r\naccount of a most peculiar pregnancy consisting of a placenta alone,\r\nthe fetus wanting. What this \"placenta\" was will always be a matter of\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nOccasionally death of the fetus is caused by the formation of knots in\r\nthe cord, shutting off the fetal circulation; Gery, Grieve, Mastin,\r\nPassot, Piogey, Woets, and others report instances of this nature.\r\nNewman reports a curious case of twins, in which the cord of one child\r\nwas encircled by a knot on the cord of the other. Among others, Latimer\r\nand Motte report instances of the accidental tying of the bowel with\r\nthe funis, causing an artificial anus.\r\n\r\nThe diverse causes of abortion are too numerous to attempt giving them\r\nall, but some are so curious and anomalous that they deserve mention.\r\nEpidemics of abortion are spoken of by Fickius, Fischer, and the\r\nEphemerides. Exposure to cold is spoken of as a cause, and the same is\r\nalluded to by the Ephemerides; while another case is given as due to\r\nexposure white nude. There are several cases among the older writers in\r\nwhich odors are said to have produced abortion, but as analogues are\r\nnot to be found in modern literature, unless the odor is very poisonous\r\nor pungent, we can give them but little credence. The Ephemerides gives\r\nthe odor of urine as provocative of abortion; Sulzberger, Meyer, and\r\nAlbertus all mention odors; and Vesti gives as a plausible cause the\r\nodor of carbonic vapor. The Ephemerides mentions singultus as a cause\r\nof abortion. Mauriceau, Pelargus, and Valentini mention coughing.\r\nHippocrates mentions the case of a woman who induced abortion by\r\ncalling excessively loud to some one. Fabrieius Hildanus speaks of\r\nabortion following a kick in the region of the coccyx.  Gullmannus\r\nspeaks of an abortion which he attributes to the woman's constant\r\nneglect to answer the calls of nature, the rectum being at all times in\r\na state of irritation from her negligence. Hawley mentions abortion at\r\nthe fourth or fifth month due to the absorption of spirits of\r\nturpentine. Solingen speaks of abortion produced by sneezing. Osiander\r\ncites an instance in which a woman suddenly arose, and in doing so\r\njolted herself so severely that she produced abortion. Hippocrates\r\nspeaks of extreme hunger as a cause of abortion. Treuner speaks of\r\ngreat anger and wrath in a woman disturbing her to the extent of\r\nproducing abortion.\r\n\r\nThe causes that are observed every day, such tight lacing, excessive\r\nvenery, fright, and emotions, are too well known to be discussed here.\r\n\r\nThere has been reported a recent case of abortion following a\r\nviper-bite, and analogues may be found in the writings of Severinus and\r\nOedman, who mention viper-bites as the cause; but there are so many\r\nassociate conditions accompanying a snake-bite, such as fright,\r\ntreatment, etc., any one of which could be a cause in itself, that this\r\nis by no means a reliable explanation.  Information from India an this\r\nsubject would be quite valuable.\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides speak of bloodless abortion, and there have been modern\r\ninstances in which the hemorrhage has been hardly noticeable.\r\n\r\nAbortion in a twin pregnancy does not necessarily mean the abortion or\r\ndeath of both the products of conception. Chapman speaks of the case of\r\nthe expulsion of a blighted fetus at the seventh month, the living\r\nchild remaining to the full term, and being safely delivered, the\r\nplacenta following. Crisp says of a case of labor that the head of the\r\nchild was obstructed by a round body, the nature of which he was for\r\nsome time unable to determine. He managed to push the obstructing body\r\nup and delivered a living, full-term child; this was soon followed by a\r\nblighted fetus, which was 11 inches long, weighed 12 ounces, with a\r\nplacenta attached weighing 6 1/2 ounces. It is quite common for a\r\nblighted fetus to be retained and expelled at term with a living child,\r\nits twin.\r\n\r\nBacon speaks of twin pregnancy, with the death of one fetus at the\r\nfourth month and the other delivered at term. Beall reports the\r\nconception of twins, with one fetus expelled and the other retained;\r\nBeauchamp cites a similar instance. Bothwell describes a twin labor at\r\nterm, in which one child was living and the other dead at the fifth\r\nmonth and macerated. Belt reports an analogous case. Jameson gives the\r\nhistory of an extraordinary case of twins in which one (dead) child was\r\nretained in the womb for forty-nine weeks, the other having been born\r\nalive at the expiration of nine months. Hamilton describes a case of\r\ntwins in which one fetus died from the effects of an injury between the\r\nfourth and fifth months and the second arrived at full period. Moore\r\ncites an instance in which one of the fetuses perished about the third\r\nmonth, but was not expelled until the seventh, and the other was\r\ncarried to full term. Wilson speaks of a secondary or blighted fetus of\r\nthe third month with fatty degeneration of the membranes retained and\r\nexpelled with its living twin at the eighth month of uterogestation.\r\n\r\nThere was a case at Riga in 1839 of a robust girl who conceived in\r\nFebruary, and in consequence her menses ceased. In June she aborted,\r\nbut, to her dismay, soon afterward the symptoms of advanced pregnancy\r\nappeared, and in November a full-grown child, doubtless the result of\r\nthe same impregnation as the fetus, was expelled at the fourth month.\r\nIn 1860 Schuh reported an instance before the Vienna Faculty of\r\nMedicine in which a fetus was discharged at the third month of\r\npregnancy and the other twin retained until full term. The abortion was\r\nattended with much metrorrhagia, and ten weeks afterward the movements\r\nof the other child could be plainly felt and pregnancy continued its\r\ncourse uninterrupted. Bates mentions a twin pregnancy in which an\r\nabortion took place at the second month and was followed by a natural\r\nbirth at full term. Hawkins gives a case of miscarriage, followed by a\r\nnatural birth at full term; and Newnham cites a similar instance in\r\nwhich there was a miscarriage at the seventh month and a birth at full\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nWorms in the Uterus.--Haines speaks of a most curious case--that of a\r\nwoman who had had a miscarriage three days previous; she suffered\r\nintense pain and a fetid discharge. A number of maggots were seen in\r\nthe vagina, and the next day a mass about the size of an orange came\r\naway from the uterus, riddled with holes, and which contained a number\r\nof dead maggots, killed by the carbolic acid injection given soon after\r\nthe miscarriage. The fact seems inexplicable, but after their expulsion\r\nthe symptoms immediately ameliorated. This case recalls a somewhat\r\nsimilar one given by the older writers, in which a fetus was eaten by a\r\nworm.  Analogous are those cases spoken of by Bidel of lumbricoides\r\nfound in the uterus; by Hole, in which maggots were found in the vagina\r\nand uterus; and Simpson, in which the abortion was caused by worms in\r\nthe womb--if the associate symptoms were trustworthy.\r\n\r\nWe can find fabulous parallels to all of these in some of the older\r\nwritings. Pare mentions Lycosthenes' account of a woman in Cracovia in\r\n1494 who bore a dead child which had attached to its back a live\r\nserpent, which had gnawed it to death. He gives an illustration showing\r\nthe serpent in situ. He also quotes the case of a woman who conceived\r\nby a mariner, and who, after nine months, was delivered by a midwife of\r\na shapeless mass, followed by an animal with a long neck, blazing eyes,\r\nand clawed feet.  Ballantyne says that in the writings of Hippocrates\r\nthere is in the work on \"Diseases\", which is not usually regarded as\r\ngenuine, a some what curious statement with regard to worms in the\r\nfetus.  It is affirmed that flat worms develop in the unborn infant,\r\nand the reason given is that the feces are expelled so soon after birth\r\nthat there would not be sufficient time during extrauterine life for\r\nthe formation of creatures of such a size. The same remark applies to\r\nround worms. The proof of these statements is to be found in the fact\r\nthat many infants expel both these varieties of parasites with the\r\nfirst stool. It is difficult to know what to make of these opinions;\r\nfor, with the exception of certain cases in some of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth century writers, there are no records in medicine of the\r\noccurrence of vermes in the infant at birth. It is possible that other\r\nthings, such as dried pieces of mucus, may have been erroneously\r\nregarded as worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOBSTETRIC ANOMALIES.\r\n\r\nGeneral Considerations.--In discussing obstetric anomalies we shall\r\nfirst consider those strange instances in which stages of parturition\r\nare unconscious and for some curious reason the pains of labor absent.\r\nSome women are anatomically constituted in a manner favorable to\r\nchild-birth, and pass through the experience in a comparatively easy\r\nmanner; but to the great majority the throes of labor are anticipated\r\nwith extreme dread, particularly by the victims of the present fashion\r\nof tight lacing.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that a physiologic process like parturition should be\r\nattended by so much pain and difficulty. Savages in their primitive and\r\nnatural state seem to have difficulty in many cases, and even animals\r\nare not free from it. We read of the ancient wild Irish women breaking\r\nthe pubic bones of their female children shortly after birth, and by\r\nsome means preventing union subsequently, in order that these might\r\nhave less trouble in child-birth--as it were, a modified and early form\r\nof symphysiotomy. In consequence of this custom the females of this\r\nrace, to quote an old English authority, had a \"waddling, lamish\r\ngesture in their going.\" These old writers said that for the same\r\nreason the women in some parts of Italy broke the coccyxes of their\r\nfemale children. This report is very likely not veracious, because this\r\nbone spontaneously repairs itself so quickly and easily. Rodet and\r\nEngelmunn, in their most extensive and interesting papers on the modes\r\nof accouchement among the primitive peoples, substantiate the fear,\r\npain, and difficulty with which labor is attended, even in the lowest\r\ngrades of society.\r\n\r\nIn view of the usual occurrence of pain and difficulty with labor, it\r\nseems natural that exceptions to the general rule should in all ages\r\nhave attracted the attention of medical men, and that literature should\r\nbe replete with such instances.  Pechlin and Muas record instances of\r\npainless births. The Ephemerides records a birth as having occurred\r\nduring asphyxia, and also one during an epileptic attack. Storok also\r\nspeaks of birth during unconsciousness in an epileptic attack; and Haen\r\nand others describe cases occurring during the coma attending\r\napoplectic attacks. King reports the histories of two married women,\r\nfond mothers and anticipating the event, who gave birth to children,\r\napparently unconsciously. In the first case, the appearance of the\r\nwoman verified the assertion; in the second, a transient suspension of\r\nthe menstrual influence accounted for it.  After some months epilepsy\r\ndeveloped in this case. Crawford speaks of a Mrs. D., who gave birth to\r\ntwins in her first confinement at full term, and who two years after\r\naborted at three months. In December, 1868, a year after the abortion,\r\nshe was delivered of a healthy, living fetus of about five or six\r\nmonths' growth in the following manner: While at stool, she discovered\r\nsomething of a shining, bluish appearance protruding through the\r\nexternal labia, but she also found that when she lay down the tumor\r\ndisappeared. This tumor proved to be the child, which had been expelled\r\nfrom the uterus four days before, with the waters and membranes intact,\r\nbut which had not been recognized; it had passed through the os without\r\npain or symptoms, and had remained alive in the vagina over four days,\r\nfrom whence it was delivered, presenting by the foot.\r\n\r\nThe state of intoxication seems by record of several cases to render\r\nbirth painless and unconscious, as well as serving as a means of\r\nanesthesia in the preanesthetic days.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of practising hypnotism in child-birth has been\r\ndiscussed, and Fanton reports 12 cases of parturition under the\r\nhypnotic influence. He says that none of the subjects suffered any pain\r\nor were aware of the birth, and offers the suggestion that to\r\nfacilitate the state of hypnosis it should be commenced before strong\r\nuterine contractions have occurred.\r\n\r\nInstances of parturition or delivery during sleep, lethargies, trances,\r\nand similar conditions are by no means uncommon. Heister speaks of\r\nbirth during a convulsive somnolence, and Osiander of a case during\r\nsleep. Montgomery relates the case of a lady, the mother of several\r\nchildren, who on one occasion was unconsciously delivered in sleep.\r\nCase relates the instance of a French woman residing in the town of\r\nHopedale, who, though near confinement, attributed her symptoms to\r\nover-fatigue on the previous day. When summoned, the doctor found that\r\nshe had severe lumbar pains, and that the os was dilated to the size of\r\na half-dollar. At ten o'clock he suggested that everyone retire, and\r\ndirected that if anything of import occurred he should be called. About\r\n4 A.M. the husband of the girl, in great fright, summoned the\r\nphysician, saying: \"Monsieur le Medecin, il y a quelque chose entre les\r\njambes de ma femme,\" and, to Dr. Case's surprise, he found the head of\r\na child wholly expelled during a profound sleep of the mother. In\r\ntwenty minutes the secundines followed. The patient, who was only\r\ntwenty years old, said that she had dreamt that something was the\r\nmatter with her, and awoke with a fright, at which instant, most\r\nprobably, the head was expelled. She was afterward confined with the\r\nusual labor-pains.\r\n\r\nPalfrey speaks of a woman, pregnant at term, who fell into a sleep\r\nabout eleven o'clock, and dreamed that she was in great pain and in\r\nlabor, and that sometime after a fine child was crawling over the bed.\r\nAfter sleeping for about four hours she awoke and noticed a discharge\r\nfrom the vagina. Her husband started for a light, but before he\r\nobtained it a child was born by a head-presentation. In a few minutes\r\nthe labor-pains returned and the feet of a second child presented, and\r\nthe child was expelled in three pains, followed in ten minutes by the\r\nplacenta.  Here is an authentic case in which labor progressed to the\r\nsecond stage during sleep.\r\n\r\nWeill describes the case of a woman of twenty-three who gave birth to a\r\nrobust boy on the 16th of June, 1877, and suckled him eleven months.\r\nThis birth lasted one hour. She became pregnant again and was delivered\r\nunder the following circumstances: She had been walking on the evening\r\nof September 5th and returned home about eleven o'clock to sleep. About\r\n3 A.M. she awoke, feeling the necessity of passing urine. She arose and\r\nseated herself for the purpose. She at once uttered a cry and called\r\nher husband, telling him that a child was born and entreating him to\r\nsend for a physician. Weill saw the woman in about ten minutes and she\r\nwas in the same position, so he ordered her to be carried to bed. On\r\nexamining the urinal he found a female child weighing 10 pounds. He\r\ntied the cord and cared for the child. The woman exhibited little\r\nhemorrhage and made a complete recovery. She had apparently slept\r\nsoundly through the uterine contractions until the final strong pain,\r\nwhich awoke her, and which she imagined was a call for urination.\r\n\r\nSamelson says that in 1844 he was sent for in Zabelsdorf, some 30 miles\r\nfrom Berlin, to attend Hannah Rhode in a case of labor. She had passed\r\neasily through eight parturitions. At about ten o'clock in the morning,\r\nafter a partially unconscious night, there was a sudden gush of blood\r\nand water from the vagina; she screamed and lapsed into an unconscious\r\ncondition. At 10.35 the face presented, soon followed by the body,\r\nafter which came a great flow of blood, welling out in several waves.\r\nThe child was a male middle-sized, and was some little time in making\r\nhimself heard. Only by degrees did the woman's consciousness return.\r\nShe felt weary and inclined to sleep, but soon after she awoke and was\r\nmuch surprised to know what had happened. She had seven or eight pains\r\nin all. Schultze speaks of a woman who, arriving at the period for\r\ndelivery, went into an extraordinary state of somnolence, and in this\r\ncondition on the third day bore a living male child.\r\n\r\nBerthier in 1859 observed a case of melancholia with delirium which\r\ncontinued through pregnancy. The woman was apparently unconscious of\r\nher condition and was delivered without pain.  Cripps mentions a case\r\nin which there was absence of pain in parturition. Depaul mentions a\r\nwoman who fell in a public street and was delivered of a living child\r\nduring a syncope which lasted four hours. Epley reports painless labor\r\nin a patient with paraplegia. Fahnestock speaks of the case of a woman\r\nwho was delivered of a son while in a state of artificial somnambulism,\r\nwithout pain to herself or injury to the child. Among others mentioning\r\npainless or unconscious labor are Behrens (during profound sleep),\r\nEger, Tempel, Panis, Agnoia, Blanckmeister, Whitehill, Gillette,\r\nMattei, Murray, Lemoine, and Moglichkeit.\r\n\r\nRapid Parturition Without Usual Symptoms.--Births unattended by\r\nsymptoms that are the usual precursors of labor often lead to speedy\r\ndeliveries in awkward places. According to Willoughby, in Darby,\r\nFebruary 9, 1667, a poor fool, Mary Baker, while wandering in an open,\r\nwindy, and cold place, was delivered by the sole assistance of Nature,\r\nEve's midwife, and freed of her afterbirth.  The poor idiot had leaned\r\nagainst a wall, and dropped the child on the cold boards, where it lay\r\nfor more than a quarter of an hour with its funis separated from the\r\nplacenta. She was only discovered by the cries of the infant. In\r\n\"Carpenter's Physiology\" is described a remarkable case of instinct in\r\nan idiotic girl in Paris, who had been seduced by some miscreant; the\r\ngirl had gnawed the funis in two, in the same manner as is practised by\r\nthe lower animals. From her mental imbecility it can hardly be imagined\r\nthat she had any idea of the object of this separation, and it must\r\nhave been instinct that impelled her to do it. Sermon says the wife of\r\nThomas James was delivered of a lusty child while in a wood by herself.\r\nShe put the child in an apron with some oak leaves, marched stoutly to\r\nher husband's uncle's house a half mile distant, and after two hours'\r\nrest went on her journey one mile farther to her own house; despite all\r\nher exertions she returned the next day to thank her uncle for the two\r\nhours' accommodation. There is related the history of a case of a woman\r\nwho was delivered of a child on a mountain during a hurricane, who took\r\noff her gown and wrapped the child up in it, together with the\r\nafterbirth, and walked two miles to her cottage, the funis being\r\nunruptured.\r\n\r\nHarvey relates a case, which he learned from the President of Munster,\r\nIreland, of a woman with child who followed her husband, a soldier in\r\nthe army, in daily march. They were forced to a halt by reason of a\r\nriver, and the woman, feeling the pains of labor approaching, retired\r\nto a thicket, and there alone brought forth twins. She carried them to\r\nthe river, washed them herself, did them up in a cloth, tied them to\r\nher back, and that very day marched, barefooted, 12 miles with the\r\nsoldiers, and was none the worse for her experience. The next day the\r\nDeputy of Ireland and the President of Munster, affected by the story,\r\nto repeat the words of Harvey, \"did both vouchsafe to be godfathers of\r\nthe infants.\"\r\n\r\nWilloughby relates the account of a woman who, having a cramp while in\r\nbed with her sister, went to an outhouse, as if to stool, and was there\r\ndelivered of a child. She quickly returned to bed, her going and her\r\nreturn not being noticed by her sleeping sister. She buried the child,\r\n\"and afterward confessed her wickedness, and was executed in the\r\nStafford Gaol, March 31, 1670.\" A similar instance is related by the\r\nsame author of a servant in Darby in 1647. Nobody suspected her, and\r\nwhen delivered she was lying in the same room with her mistress. She\r\narose without awakening anyone, and took the recently delivered child\r\nto a remote place, and hid it at the bottom of a feather tub, covering\r\nit with feathers; she returned without any suspicion on the part of her\r\nmistress. It so happened that it was the habit of the Darby soldiers to\r\npeep in at night where they saw a light, to ascertain if everything was\r\nall right, and they thus discovered her secret doings, which led to her\r\ntrial at the next sessions at Darby.\r\n\r\nWagner relates the history of a case of great medicolegal interest. An\r\nunmarried servant, who was pregnant, persisted in denying it, and took\r\nevery pains to conceal it. She slept in a room with two other maids,\r\nand, on examination, she stated that on the night in question she got\r\nup toward morning, thinking to relieve her bowels. For this purpose she\r\nsecured a wooden tub in the room, and as she was sitting down the child\r\npassed rapidly into the empty vessel. It was only then that she became\r\naware of the nature of her pains. She did not examine the child\r\nclosely, but was certain it neither moved nor cried. The funis was no\r\ndoubt torn, and she made an attempt to tie it. Regarding the event as a\r\nmiscarriage, she took up the tub with its contents and carried it to a\r\nsand pit about 30 paces distant, and threw the child in a hole in the\r\nsand that she found already made. She covered it up with sand and\r\npacked it firmly so that the dogs could not get it. She returned to her\r\nbedroom, first calling up the man-servant at the stable. She awakened\r\nher fellow-servants, and feeling tired sat down on a stool. Seeing the\r\nblood on the floor, they asked her if she had made way with the child.\r\nShe said: \"Do you take me for an old sow?\" But, having their suspicions\r\naroused, they traced the blood spots to the sand pit.  Fetching a\r\nspade, they dug up the child, which was about one foot below the\r\nsurface. On the access of air, following the removal of the sand and\r\nturf, the child began to cry, and was immediately taken up and carried\r\nto its mother, who washed it and laid it on her bed and soon gave it\r\nthe breast. The child was healthy with the exception of a club-foot,\r\nand must have been under ground at least fifteen minutes and no air\r\ncould have reached it. It seems likely that the child was born\r\nasphyxiated and was buried in this state, and only began to assume\r\nindependent vitality when for the second time exposed to the air. This\r\ncurious case was verified to English correspondents by Dr. Wagner, and\r\nis of unquestionable authority; it became the subject of a thorough\r\ncriminal investigation in Germany.\r\n\r\nDuring the funeral procession of Marshal MacMahon in Paris an enormous\r\ncrowd was assembled to see the cortege pass, and in this crowd was a\r\nwoman almost at the time of delivery; the jostling which she received\r\nin her endeavors to obtain a place of vantage was sufficient to excite\r\ncontraction, and, in an upright position, she gave birth to a fetus,\r\nwhich fell at her feet. The crowd pushed back and made way for the\r\nambulance officials, and mother and child were carried off, the mother\r\napparently experiencing little embarrassment. Quoted by Taylor,\r\nAnderson speaks of a woman accused of child murder, who walked a\r\ndistance of 28 miles on a single day with her two-days-old child on her\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThere is also a case of a female servant named Jane May, who was\r\nfrequently charged by her mistress with pregnancy but persistently\r\ndenied it. On October 26th she was sent to market with some poultry.\r\nReturning home, she asked the boy who drove her to stop and allow her\r\nto get out. She went into a recess in a hedge. In five minutes she was\r\nseen to leave the hedge and follow the cart, walking home, a distance\r\nof a mile and a half. The following day she went to work as usual, and\r\nwould not have been found out had not a boy, hearing feeble cries from\r\nthe recess of the hedge, summoned a passer-by, but too late to save the\r\nchild.  At her trial she said she did not see her babe breathe nor cry,\r\nand she thought by the sudden birth that it must have been a still-born\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nShortt says that one day, while crossing the esplanade at Villaire,\r\nbetween seven and eight o'clock in the morning, he perceived three\r\nHindoo women with large baskets of cakes of \"bratties\" on their heads,\r\ncoming from a village about four miles distant. Suddenly one of the\r\nwomen stood still for a minute, stooped, and to his surprise dropped a\r\nfully developed male child to the ground. One of her companions ran\r\ninto the town, about 100 yards distant, for a knife to divide the cord.\r\nA few of the female passers-by formed a screen about the mother with\r\ntheir clothes, and the cord was divided. The after-birth came away, and\r\nthe woman was removed to the town. It was afterward discovered that she\r\nwas the mother of two children, was twenty-eight years old, had not the\r\nslightest sign of approaching labor, and was not aware of parturition\r\nuntil she actually felt the child between her thighs.\r\n\r\nSmith of Madras, in 1862, says he was hastily summoned to see an\r\nEnglish lady who had borne a child without the slightest warning.  He\r\nfound the child, which had been born ten minutes, lying close to the\r\nmother's body, with the funis uncut. The native female maid, at the\r\nlady's orders, had left the child untouched, lifting the bed-clothes to\r\ngive it air. The lady said that she arose at 5.30 feeling well, and\r\nduring the forenoon had walked down a long flight of steps across a\r\nwalk to a small summer-house within the enclosure of her grounds.\r\nFeeling a little tired, she had lain down on her bed, and soon\r\nexperienced a slight discomfort, and was under the impression that\r\nsomething solid and warm was lying in contact with her person. She\r\ndirected the servant to look below the bed-clothes, and then a female\r\nchild was discovered.  Her other labors had extended over six hours,\r\nand were preceded by all the signs distinctive of childbirth, which\r\nfact attaches additional interest to the case. The ultimate fate of the\r\nchild is not mentioned. Smith quotes Wilson, who said he was called to\r\nsee a woman who was delivered without pain while walking about the\r\nhouse. He found the child on the floor with its umbilical cord torn\r\nacross.\r\n\r\nLangston mentions the case of a woman, twenty-three, who, between 4 and\r\n5 A.M., felt griping pains in the abdomen. Knowing her condition she\r\nsuspected labor, and determined to go to a friend's house where she\r\ncould be confined in safety. She had a distance of about 600 yards to\r\ngo, and when she was about half way she was delivered in an upright\r\nposition of a child, which fell on the pavement and ruptured its funis\r\nin the fall. Shortly after, the placenta was expelled, and she\r\nproceeded on her journey, carrying the child in her arms. At 5.50 the\r\nphysician saw the woman in bed, looking well and free from pain, but\r\ncomplaining of being cold. The child, which was her first, was healthy,\r\nwell nourished, and normal, with the exception of a slight ecchymosis\r\nof the parietal bone on the left side. The funis was lacerated\r\ntransversely four inches from the umbilicus. Both mother and child\r\nprogressed favorably. Doubtless the intense cold had so contracted the\r\nblood-vessels as to prevent fatal hemorrhage to mother and child. This\r\ncase has a legal bearing in the supposition that the child had been\r\nkilled in the fall.\r\n\r\nThere is reported the case of a woman in Wales, who, while walking with\r\nher husband, was suddenly seized with pains, and would have been\r\ndelivered by the wayside but for the timely help of Madame Patti, the\r\ncelebrated diva, who was driving by, and who took the woman in her\r\ncarriage to her palatial residence close by. It was to be christened in\r\na few days with an appropriate name in remembrance of the occasion.\r\nColeman met an instance in a married woman, who without the slightest\r\nwarning was delivered of a child while standing near a window in her\r\nbedroom. The child fell to the floor and ruptured the cord about one\r\ninch from the umbilicus, but with speedy attention the happiest results\r\nwere attained. Twitchell has an example in the case of a young woman of\r\nseventeen, who was suddenly delivered of a child while ironing some\r\nclothes. The cord in this case was also ruptured, but the child\r\nsustained no injury. Taylor quotes the description of a child who died\r\nfrom an injury to the head caused by dropping from the mother at an\r\nunexpected time, while she was in the erect position; he also speaks of\r\na parallel case on record.\r\n\r\nUnusual Places of Birth.--Besides those mentioned, the other awkward\r\npositions in which a child may be born are so numerous and diversified\r\nthat mention of only a few can be made here.  Colton tells of a\r\npainless labor in an Irish girl of twenty-three, who felt a desire to\r\nurinate, and while seated on the chamber dropped a child. She never\r\nfelt a labor-pain, and twelve days afterward rode 20 miles over a rough\r\nroad to go to her baby's funeral. Leonhard describes the case of a\r\nmother of thirty-seven, who had borne six children alive, who was\r\npregnant for the tenth time, and who had miscalculated her pregnancy.\r\nDuring pregnancy she had an attack of small-pox and suffered all\r\nthrough pregnancy with constipation. She had taken a laxative, and when\r\nreturning to bed from stool was surprised to find herself attached to\r\nthe stool by a band. The child in the vessel began to cry and was\r\nseparated from the woman, who returned to bed and suddenly died\r\none-half hour later. The mother was entirely unconscious of the\r\ndelivery. Westphal mentions a delivery in a water-closet.\r\n\r\nBrown speaks of a woman of twenty-six who had a call of nature while in\r\nbed, and while sitting up she gave birth to a fine, full-grown child,\r\nwhich, falling on the floor, ruptured the funis. She took her child,\r\nlay down with it for some time, and feeling easier, hailed a cab, drove\r\nto a hospital with the child in her arms, and wanted to walk upstairs.\r\nShe was put to bed and delivered of the placenta, there being but\r\nlittle hemorrhage from the cord; both she and her child made speedy\r\nrecoveries. Thebault reports an instance of delivery in the erect\r\nposition, with rupture of the funis at the placenta. There was recently\r\na rumor, probably a newspaper fabrication, that a woman while at stool\r\nin a railway car gave birth to a child which was found alive on the\r\ntrack afterward.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious instance on record in which a child was born in a\r\nhip-bath and narrowly escaped drowning. The mother was a European woman\r\naged forty, who had borne two children, the last nine years before. She\r\nwas supposed to have dropsy of the abdomen, and among other treatments\r\nwas the use of a speculum and caustic applications for inflammation of\r\nthe womb. The escape of watery fluid for two days was considered\r\nevidence of the rupture of an ovarian cyst. At the end of two days,\r\nsevere pains set in, and a warm hip-bath and an opiate were ordered.\r\nWhile in the bath she bore a fully-matured, living, male child, to the\r\ngreat surprise of herself and her friends. The child might have been\r\ndrowned had not assistance been close at hand.\r\n\r\nBirth by the Rectum.--In some cases in which there is some obstacle to\r\nthe delivery of a child by the natural passages, the efforts of nature\r\nto expel the product of conception lead to an anomalous exit. There are\r\nsome details of births by the rectum mentioned in the last century by\r\nReta and others. Payne cites the instance of a woman of thirty-three,\r\nin labor thirty-six hours, in whom there was a congenital absence of\r\nthe vaginal orifice.  The finger, gliding along the perineum, arrived\r\nat a distended anus, just inside of which was felt a fetal head. He\r\nanesthetized the patient and delivered the child with forceps, and\r\nwithout perineal rupture. There was little hemorrhage, and the placenta\r\nwas removed with slight difficulty. Five months later, Payne found an\r\nunaltered condition of the perineum and vicinity; there was absence of\r\nthe vaginal orifice, and, on introducing the finger along the anterior\r\nwall of the rectum, a fistula was found, communicating with the vagina;\r\nabove this point the arrangement and the situation of the parts were\r\nnormal. The woman had given birth to three still-born children, and\r\nalways menstruated easily. Coitus always seemed satisfactory, and no\r\nsuspicion existed in the patient's mind, and had never been suggested\r\nto her, of her abnormality.\r\n\r\nHarrison saw a fetus delivered by the anus after rupture of the uterus;\r\nthe membranes came away by the same route. In this case the neck of the\r\nuterus was cartilaginous and firmly adherent to the adjacent parts. In\r\nseven days after the accouchement the woman had completely regained her\r\nhealth. Vallisneri reports the instance of a woman who possessed two\r\nuteruses, one communicating with the vagina, the other with the rectum.\r\nShe had permitted rectal copulation and had become impregnated in this\r\nmanner.  Louis, the celebrated French surgeon, created a furore by a\r\npamphlet entitled \"De partium externarum generationi inservientium in\r\nmulieribus naturali vitiosa et morbosa dispositione, etc.,\" for which\r\nhe was punished by the Sorbonne, but absolved by the Pope. He described\r\na young lady who had no vaginal opening, but who regularly menstruated\r\nby the rectum. She allowed her lover to have connection with her in the\r\nonly possible way, by the rectum, which, however, sufficed for\r\nimpregnation, and at term she bore by the rectum a well-formed child.\r\nHunter speaks of a case of pregnancy in a woman with a double vagina,\r\nwho was delivered at the seventh month by the rectum. Mekeln and\r\nAndrews give instances of parturition through the anus. Morisani\r\ndescribes a case of extrauterine pregnancy with tubal rupture and\r\ndischarge into the culdesac, in which there was delivery by the rectum.\r\nAfter an attack of severe abdominal pain, followed by hemorrhage, the\r\nwoman experienced an urgent desire to empty the rectum. The fetal\r\nmovements ceased, and a recurrence of these symptoms led the patient to\r\ngo to stool, at which she passed blood and a seromucoid fluid. She\r\nattempted manually to remove the offending substances from the rectum,\r\nand in consequence grasped the leg of a fetus. She was removed to a\r\nhospital, where a fetus nine inches long was removed from the rectum.\r\nThe rectal opening gradually cicatrized, the sac became obliterated,\r\nand the woman left the hospital well.\r\n\r\nBirth Through Perineal Perforation.--Occasionally there is perineal\r\nperforation during labor, with birth of the child through the opening.\r\nBrown mentions a case of rupture of the perineum with birth of a child\r\nbetween the vaginal opening and the anus. Cassidy reports a case of\r\nchild-birth through the perineum. A successful operation was performed\r\nfifteen days after the accident. Dupuytren speaks of the passage of an\r\ninfant through a central opening of the perineum. Capuron, Gravis, and\r\nLebrun all report accouchement through a perineal perforation, without\r\nalteration in the sphincter ani or the fourchet. In his \"Diseases of\r\nWomen\" Simpson speaks of a fistula left by the passage of an infant\r\nthrough the perineum. Wilson, Toloshinoff, Stolz, Argles, Demarquay,\r\nHarley, Hernu, Martyn, Lamb, Morere, Pollock, and others record the\r\nbirth of children through perineal perforations.\r\n\r\nBirth Through the Abdominal Wall.--Hollerius gives a very peculiar\r\ninstance in which the abdominal walls gave way from the pressure\r\nexerted by the fetus, and the uterus ruptured, allowing the child to be\r\nextracted by the hand from the umbilicus; the mother made a speedy\r\nrecovery. In such cases delivery is usually by means of operative\r\ninterference (which will be spoken of later), but rarely, as here,\r\nspontaneously. Farquharson and Ill both mention rupture of the\r\nabdominal parietes during labor.\r\n\r\nThere have been cases reported in which the recto-vaginal septum has\r\nbeen ruptured, as well as the perineum and the sphincter ani, giving\r\nall the appearance of a birth by the anus.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a female who had a tumor projecting between the\r\nvagina and rectum, which was incised through the intestine, and proved\r\nto be a dead child. Saviard reported what he considered a rather unique\r\ncase, in which the uterus was ruptured by external violence, the fetus\r\nbeing thrown forward into the abdomen and afterward extracted from an\r\numbilical abscess.\r\n\r\nBirth of the Fetus Enclosed in the Membranes.--Harvey says that an\r\ninfant can rest in its membranes several hours after birth without loss\r\nof life. Schurig eventrated a pregnant bitch and her puppies lived in\r\ntheir membranes half an hour. Wrisberg cites three observations of\r\ninfants born closed in their membranes; one lived seven minutes; the\r\nother two nine minutes; all breathed when the membranes were cut and\r\nair admitted. Willoughby recorded the history of a case which attracted\r\nmuch comment at the time.  It was the birth of twins enclosed in their\r\nsecundines. The sac was opened and, together with the afterbirth, was\r\nlaid over some hot coals; there was, however, a happy issue, the\r\nchildren recovering and living. Since Willoughby's time several cases\r\nof similar interest have been noticed, one in a woman of forty, who had\r\nbeen married sixteen years, and who had had several pregnancies in her\r\nearly married life and a recent abortion. Her last pregnancy lasted\r\nabout twenty-eight or twenty-nine weeks, and terminated, after a short\r\nlabor, by the expulsion of the ovum entire. The membranes had not been\r\nruptured, and still enclosed the fetus and the liquor amnii. On\r\nbreaking them, the fetus was seen floating on the waters, alive, and,\r\nthough very diminutive, was perfectly formed. It continued to live, and\r\na day afterward took the breast and began to cry feebly. At six weeks\r\nit weighed 2 pounds 2 ounces, and at ten months, 12 pounds, but was\r\nstill very weak and ill-nourished. Evans has an instance of a fetus\r\nexpelled enveloped in its membranes entire and unruptured. The\r\nmembranes were opaque and preternaturally thickened, and were opened\r\nwith a pair of scissors; strenuous efforts were made to save the child,\r\nbut to no purpose. The mother, after a short convalescence, made a good\r\nrecovery. Forman reports an instance of unruptured membranes at birth,\r\nthe delivery following a single pain, in a woman of twenty-two,\r\npregnant for a second time.  Woodson speaks of a case of twins, one of\r\nwhich was born enveloped in its secundines.\r\n\r\nVan Bibber was called in great haste to see a patient in labor.  He\r\nreached the house in about fifteen minutes, and was told by the\r\nmidwife, a woman of experience, that she had summoned him because of\r\nthe expulsion from the womb of something the like of which she had\r\nnever seen before. She thought it must have been some variety of false\r\nconception, and had wrapped it up in some flannel. It proved to be a\r\nfetus enclosed in its sac, with the placenta, all having been expelled\r\ntogether and intact. He told the nurse to rupture the membranes, and\r\nthe child, which had been in the unruptured sac for over twenty\r\nminutes, began to cry. The infant lived for over a month, but\r\neventually died of bronchitis.\r\n\r\nCowger reports labor at the end of the seventh month without rupture of\r\nthe fetal sac. Macknus and Rootes speak of expulsion of the entire ovum\r\nat the full period of gestation. Roe mentions a case of parturition\r\nwith unruptured membrane. Slusser describes the delivery of a\r\nfull-grown fetus without rupture of the membrane.\r\n\r\n\"Dry Births.\"--The reverse of the foregoing are those cases in which,\r\nby reason of the deficiency of the waters, the birth is dry. Numerous\r\ncauses can be stated for such occurrences, and the reader is referred\r\nelsewhere for them, the subject being an old one. The Ephemerides\r\nspeaks of it, and Rudolph discusses its occurrence exhaustively and\r\ntells of the difficulties of such a labor. Burrall mentions a case of\r\nlabor without apparent liquor amnii, delivery being effected by the\r\nforceps. Strong records an unusual obstetric case in which there was\r\nprolongation of the pregnancy, with a large child, and entire absence\r\nof liquor amnii. The case was also complicated with interstitial and\r\nsubserous fibroids and a contracted pelvis, combined with a posterior\r\nposition of the occiput and nonrotation of the head.  Lente mentions a\r\ncase of labor without liquor amnii; and Townsend records delivery\r\nwithout any sanguineous discharge. Cosentino mentions a case of the\r\nabsence of liquor amnii associated with a fetal monstrosity.\r\n\r\nDelivery After Death of the Mother.--Curious indeed are those anomalous\r\ncases in which the delivery is effected spontaneously after the death\r\nof the mother, or when, by manipulation, the child is saved after the\r\nmaternal decease. Wegelin gives the account of a birth in which version\r\nwas performed after death and the child successfully delivered.\r\nBartholinus, Wolff, Schenck, Horstius, Hagendorn, Fabricius Hildanus,\r\nValerius, Rolfinck, Cornarius, Boener, and other older writers cite\r\ncases of this kind. Pinard gives a most wonderful case. The patient was\r\na woman of thirty-eight who had experienced five previous normal\r\nlabors.  On October 27th she fancied she had labor pains and went to\r\nthe Lariboisiere Maternite, where, after a careful examination, three\r\nfetal poles were elicited, and she was told, to her surprise, of the\r\nprobability of triplets. At 6 P.M., November 13th, the pains of labor\r\ncommenced. Three hours later she was having great dyspnea with each\r\npain. This soon assumed a fatal aspect and the midwife attempted to\r\nresuscitate the patient by artificial respiration, but failed in her\r\nefforts, and then she turned her attention to the fetuses, and, one by\r\none, she extracted them in the short space of five minutes; the last\r\none was born twelve minutes after the mother's death. They all lived\r\n(the first two being females), and they weighed from 4 1/4 to 6 1/2\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nConsiderable attention has been directed to the advisability of\r\naccelerated and forced labor in the dying, in order that the child may\r\nbe saved. Belluzzi has presented several papers on this subject.\r\nCsurgay of Budapest mentions saving the child by forced labor in the\r\ndeath agonies of the mother. Devilliers considers this question from\r\nboth the obstetric and medicolegal points of view. Hyneaux mentions\r\nforcible accouchement practised on both the dead and the dying.\r\nRogowicz advocates artificial delivery by the natural channel in place\r\nof Cesarian section in cases of pending or recent death, and Thevenot\r\ndiscussed this question at length at the International Medico-Legal\r\nCongress in 1878. Duer presented the question of postmortem delivery in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nKelly reports the history of a woman of forty who died in her eighth\r\npregnancy, and who was delivered of a female child by version and\r\nartificial means. Artificial respiration was successfully practised on\r\nthe child, although fifteen minutes had elapsed from the death of the\r\nmother to its extraction. Driver relates the history of a woman of\r\nthirty-five, who died in the eighth month of gestation, and who was\r\ndelivered postmortem by the vagina, manual means only being used. The\r\noperator was about to perform Cesarean section when he heard the noise\r\nof the membranes rupturing. Thornton reports the extraction of a living\r\nchild by version after the death of the mother. Aveling has compiled\r\nextensive statistics on all varieties of postmortem deliveries,\r\ncollecting 44 cases of spontaneous expulsion of the fetus after death\r\nof the mother.\r\n\r\nAveling states that in 1820 the Council of Cologne sanctioned the\r\nplacing of a gag in the mouth of a dead pregnant woman, thereby hoping\r\nto prevent suffocation of the infant, and there are numerous such laws\r\non record, although most of them pertain to the performance of Cesarean\r\nsection immediately after death.\r\n\r\nReiss records the death of a woman who was hastily buried while her\r\nhusband was away, and on his return he ordered exhumation of her body,\r\nand on opening the coffin a child's cry was heard. The infant had\r\nevidently been born postmortem. It lived long afterward under the name\r\nof \"Fils de la terre.\" Willoughby mentions the curious instance in\r\nwhich rumbling was heard from the coffin of a woman during her hasty\r\nburial. One of her neighbors returned to the grave, applied her ear to\r\nthe ground, and was sure she heard a sighing noise. A soldier with her\r\naffirmed her tale, and together they went to a clergyman and a justice,\r\nbegging that the grave be opened. When the coffin was opened it was\r\nfound that a child had been born, which had descended to her knees. In\r\nDerbyshire, to this day, may be seen on the parish register: \"April ye\r\n20, 1650, was buried Emme, the wife of Thomas Toplace, who was found\r\ndelivered of a child after she had lain two hours in the grave.\"\r\n\r\nJohannes Matthaeus relates the case of a buried woman, and that some\r\ntime afterward a noise was heard in the tomb. The coffin was\r\nimmediately opened, and a living female child rolled to the feet of the\r\ncorpse. Hagendorn mentions the birth of a living child some hours after\r\nthe death of the mother. Dethardingius mentions a healthy child born\r\none-half hour after the mother's death. In the Gentleman's Magazine\r\nthere is a record of an instance, in 1759, in which a midwife, after\r\nthe death of a woman whom she had failed to deliver, imagined that she\r\nsaw a movement under the shroud and found a child between its mother's\r\nlegs. It died soon after. Valerius Maximus says that while the body of\r\nthe mother of Gorgia Epirotas was being carried to the grave, a loud\r\nnoise was heard to come from the coffin and on examination a live child\r\nwas found between the thighs,--whence arose the proverb: \"Gorgiam prius\r\nad funus elatum, quam natum fuisse.\"\r\n\r\nOther cases of postmortem delivery are less successful, the delivery\r\nbeing delayed too late for the child to be viable. The first of\r\nAveling's cases was that of a pregnant woman who was hanged by a\r\nSpanish Inquisitor in 1551 While still hanging, four hours later, two\r\nchildren were said to have dropped from her womb. The second case was\r\nof a woman of Madrid, who after death was shut in a sepulcher. Some\r\nmonths after, when the tomb was opened, a dead infant was found by the\r\nside of the corpse.  Rolfinkius tells of a woman who died during\r\nparturition, and her body being placed in a cellar, five days later a\r\ndead boy and girl were found on the bier. Bartholinus is accredited\r\nwith the following: Three midwives failing to deliver a woman, she\r\ndied, and forty-eight hours after death her abdomen swelled to such an\r\nextent as to burst her grave-clothes, and a male child, dead, was seen\r\nissuing from the vagina. Bonet tells of a woman, who died in Brussels\r\nin 1633, who, undelivered, expired in convulsions on Thursday. On\r\nFriday abdominal movements in the corpse were seen, and on Sunday a\r\ndead child was found hanging between the thighs.  According to Aveling,\r\nHerman of Berne reports the instance of a young lady whose body was far\r\nadvanced in putrefaction, from which was expelled an unbroken ovum\r\ncontaining twins. Even the placenta showed signs of decomposition.\r\nNaumann relates the birth of a child on the second day after the death\r\nof the mother.  Richter of Weissenfels, in 1861, reported the case of a\r\nwoman who died in convulsions, and sixty hours after death an eight\r\nmonths' fetus came away. Stapedius writes to a friend of a fetus being\r\nfound dead between the thighs of a woman who expired suddenly of an\r\nacute disease. Schenk mentions that of a woman, dying at 5 P.M., a\r\nchild having two front teeth was born at 3 A.M.  Veslingius tells of a\r\nwoman dying of epilepsy on June 6, 1630, from whose body, two days\r\nlater, issued a child. Wolfius relates the case of a woman dying in\r\nlabor in 1677. Abdominal movements being seen six hours after death,\r\nCesarean section was suggested, but its performance was delayed, and\r\neighteen hours after a child was spontaneously born. Hoyer of Mulhausen\r\ntells of a child with its mouth open and tongue protruding, which was\r\nborn while the mother was on the way to the grave. Bedford of Sydney,\r\naccording to Aveling, relates the story of a case in which malpractice\r\nwas suspected on a woman of thirty-seven, who died while pregnant with\r\nher seventh child. The body was exhumed, and a transverse rupture of\r\nthe womb six inches long above the cervix was found, and the body of a\r\ndead male child lay between the thighs. In 1862, Lanigan tells of a\r\nwoman who was laid out for funeral obsequies, and on removal of the\r\ncovers for burial a child was found in bed with her. Swayne is credited\r\nwith the description of the death of a woman whom a midwife failed to\r\ndeliver. Desiring an inquest, the coroner had the body exhumed, when,\r\non opening the coffin, a well-developed male infant was found parallel\r\nto and lying on the lower limbs, the cord and placenta being entirely\r\nunattached from the mother.\r\n\r\nSome time after her decease Harvey found between the thighs of a dead\r\nwoman a dead infant which had been expelled postmortem.  Mayer relates\r\nthe history of a case of a woman of forty-five who felt the movement of\r\nher child for the fourth time in the middle of November. In the\r\nfollowing March she had hemoptysis, and serious symptoms of\r\ninflammation in the right lung following, led to her apparent death on\r\nthe 31st of the month. For two days previous to her death she had\r\nfailed to perceive the fetal movements. She was kept on her back in a\r\nroom, covered up and undisturbed, for thirty-six hours, the members of\r\nthe family occasionally visiting her to sprinkle holy water on her\r\nface.  There was no remembrance of cadaveric distortion of the features\r\nor any odor. When the undertakers were drawing the shroud on they\r\nnoticed a half-round, bright-red, smooth-looking body between the\r\ngenitals which they mistook for a prolapsed uterus. Early on April 2d,\r\na few hours before interment, the men thought to examine the swelling\r\nthey had seen the day before. A second look showed it to be a dead\r\nfemale child, now lying between the thighs and connected with the\r\nmother by the umbilical cord. The interment was stopped, and Mayer was\r\ncalled to examine the body, but with negative results, though the signs\r\nof death were not plainly visible for a woman dead fifty-eight hours.\r\nBy its development the body of the fetus confirmed the mother's account\r\nof a pregnancy of twenty-one weeks. Mayer satisfies himself at least\r\nthat the mother was in a trance at the time of delivery and died soon\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nMoritz gives the instance of a woman dying in pregnancy, undelivered,\r\nwho happened to be disinterred several days after burial. The body was\r\nin an advanced state of decomposition, and a fetus was found in the\r\ncoffin. It was supposed that the pressure of gas in the mother's body\r\nhad forced the fetus from the uterus.  Ostmann speaks of a woman\r\nmarried five months, who was suddenly seized with rigors, headache, and\r\nvomiting. For a week she continued to do her daily work, and in\r\naddition was ill-treated by her husband. She died suddenly without\r\nhaving any abdominal pain or any symptoms indicative of abortion. The\r\nbody was examined twenty-four hours after death and was seen to be\r\ndark, discolored, and the abdomen distended. There was no sanguineous\r\ndischarge from the genitals, but at the time of raising the body to\r\nplace it in the coffin, a fetus, with the umbilical cord, escaped from\r\nthe vagina. There seemed to have been a rapid putrefaction in this\r\nease, generating enough pressure of gas to expel the fetus as well as\r\nthe uterus from the body. This at least is the view taken by Hoffman\r\nand others in the solution of these strange cases.\r\n\r\nAntepartum Crying of the Child.--There are on record fabulous cases of\r\nchildren crying in the uterus during pregnancy, and all sorts of\r\nunbelievable stories have been constructed from these reported\r\noccurrences. Quite possible, however, and worthy of belief are the\r\ncases in which the child has been heard to cry during the progress of\r\nparturition--that is, during delivery.  Jonston speaks of infants\r\ncrying in the womb, and attempts a scientific explanation of the fact.\r\nHe also quotes the following lines in reference to this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"Mirandum foetus nlaterna clausus in alvo Dicitur insuetos ore dedisse\r\nsonos.  Causa subest; doluit se angusta sede telleri Et cupiit magnae\r\ncernere moliis opus.  Aut quia quaerendi studio vis fessa parentum\r\nAucupii aptas innuit esse manus.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides gives examples of the child hiccoughing in the uterus.\r\nCases of crying before delivery, some in the vagina, some just before\r\nthe complete expulsion of the head from the os uteri, are very numerous\r\nin the older writers; and it is quite possible that on auscultation of\r\nthe pregnant abdomen fetal sounds may have been exaggerated into cries.\r\nBartholinus, Borellus, Boyle, Buchner, Paullini, Mezger, Riolanus,\r\nLentillus, Marcellus Donatus, and Wolff all speak of children crying\r\nbefore delivery; and Mazinus relates the instance of a puppy whose\r\nfeeble cries could be heard before expulsion from the bitch. Osiander\r\nfully discusses the subject of infants crying during parturition.\r\n\r\nMcLean describes a case in which he positively states that a child\r\ncried lustily in utero during application of the forceps.  He compared\r\nthe sound as though from a voice in the cellar. This child was in the\r\nuterus, not in the vagina, and continued the crying during the whole of\r\nthe five minutes occupied by delivery.\r\n\r\nCesarean Section.--Although the legendary history of Cesarean section\r\nis quite copious, it is very seldom that we find authentic records in\r\nthe writings of the older medical observers.  The works of Hippocrates,\r\nAretxeus, Galen, Celsus, and Aetius contain nothing relative to records\r\nof successful Cesarean sections. However, Pliny says that Scipio\r\nAfricanus was the first and Manlius the second of the Romans who owed\r\ntheir lives to the operation of Cesarean section; in his seventh book\r\nhe says that Julius Caesar was born in this way, the fact giving origin\r\nto his name. Others deny this and say that his name came from the thick\r\nhead of hair which he possessed. It is a frequent subject in old Roman\r\nsculpture, and there are many delineations of the birth of Bacchus by\r\nCesarean section from the corpse of Semele. Greek mythology tells us of\r\nthe birth of Bacchus in the following manner: After Zeus burnt the\r\nhouse of Semele, daughter of Cadmus, he sent Hermes in great haste with\r\ndirections to take from the burnt body of the mother the fruit of seven\r\nmonths. This child, as we know, was Bacchus. Aesculapius, according to\r\nthe legend of the Romans, had been excised from the belly of his dead\r\nmother, Corinis, who was already on the funeral pile, by his\r\nbenefactor, Apollo; and from this legend all products of Cesarean\r\nsections were regarded as sacred to Apollo, and were thought to have\r\nbeen endowed with sagacity and bravery.\r\n\r\nOld records tell us that one of the kings of Navarre was delivered in\r\nthis way, and we also have records of the birth of the celebrated Doge,\r\nAndreas Doria, by this method. Jane Seymour was supposed to have been\r\ndelivered of Edward VI by Cesarean section, the father, after the\r\nconsultation of the physicians was announced to him, replying: \"Save\r\nthe child by all means, for I shall be able to get mothers enough.\"\r\nRobert II of Scotland was supposed to have been delivered in this way\r\nafter the death of his mother, Margery Bruce, who was killed by being\r\nthrown from a horse. Shakespere's immortal citation of Macduff, \"who\r\nwas from his mother's womb untimely ripped,\" must have been such a\r\ncase, possibly crudely done, perchance by cattle-horn. Pope Gregory XIV\r\nwas said to have been taken from his mother's belly after her death.\r\nThe Philosophical Transactions, in the last century contain accounts of\r\nCesarean section performed by an ignorant butcher and also by a\r\nmidwife; and there are many records of the celebrated case performed by\r\nJacob Nufer, a cattle gelder, at the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nBy the advent of antisepsis and the improvements of Porro and others,\r\nCesarean section has come to be a quite frequent event, and a record of\r\nthe successful cases would hardly be considered a matter of\r\nextraordinary interest, and would be out of the province of this work,\r\nbut a citation of anomalous cases will be given. Baldwin reports a case\r\nof Cesarean section on a typical rachitic dwarf of twenty-four, who\r\nweighed 100 pounds and was only 47 1/2 inches tall. It was the ninth\r\nAmerican case, according to the calculation of Harris, only the third\r\nsuccessful one, and the first successful one in Ohio. The woman had a\r\nuniformly contracted pelvis whose anteroposterior diameter was about 1\r\n1/4 inches. The hygienic surroundings for the operation were not of the\r\nbest, as the woman lived in a cellar. Tait's method of performing the\r\noperation was determined upon and successfully performed. Convalescence\r\nwas prompt, and in three weeks the case was dismissed. The child was a\r\nfemale of 7 1/2 pounds which inherited the deformities of its mother.\r\nIt thrived for nine and a half months, when it died of angina Ludovici.\r\nFigure 15 represents the mother and child.\r\n\r\nHarris gives an account of an operation upon a rachitic dwarf who was\r\nimpregnated by a large man, a baby weighing 14 pounds and measuring 20\r\ninches being delivered by the knife. St. Braun gives the account of a\r\nPorro-Cesarean operation in the case of a rachitic dwarf 3 feet 10\r\ninches tall, in which both the mother and child recovered. Munde speaks\r\nof twins being delivered by Cesarean section. Franklin gives the\r\ninstance of a woman delivered at full term of a living child by this\r\nmeans, in whom was also found a dead fetus. It lay behind the stump of\r\nthe amputated cervix, in the culdesac of Douglas. The patient died of\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nCroston reports a case of Cesarean section on a primipara of\r\ntwenty-four at full term, with the delivery of a double female monster\r\nweighing 12 1/2 pounds. This monster consisted of two females of about\r\nthe same size, united from the sternal notch to the navel, having one\r\ncord and one placenta. It was stillborn.  The diagnosis was made before\r\noperation by vaginal examination.  In a communication to Croston,\r\nHarris remarked that this was the first successful Cesarean section for\r\ndouble monstrous conception in America, and added that in 1881 Collins\r\nand Leidy performed the same operation without success.\r\n\r\nInstances of repeated Cesarean section were quite numerous, and the\r\npride of the operators noteworthy, before the uterus was removed at the\r\nfirst operation, as is now generally done. Bacque reports two sections\r\nin the same woman, and Bertrandi speaks of a case in which the\r\noperation was successfully executed many times in the same woman.\r\nRosenberg reports three cases repeated successfully by Leopold of\r\nDresden. Skutsch reports a case in which it was twice performed on a\r\nwoman with a rachitic pelvis, and who the second time was pregnant with\r\ntwins; the children and mother recovered. Zweifel cites an instance in\r\nwhich two Cesarean sections were performed on a patient, both of the\r\nchildren delivered being in vigorous health. Stolz relates a similar\r\ncase.  Beck gives an account of a Cesarean operation twice on the same\r\nwoman; in the first the child perished, but in the second it survived.\r\nMerinar cites an instance of a woman thrice opened.  Parravini gives a\r\nsimilar instance. Charlton gives an account of the performance carried\r\nout successfully four times in the same woman; Chisholm mentions a case\r\nin which it was twice performed.  Michaelis of Kiel gives an instance\r\nin which he performed the same operation on a woman four times, with\r\nsuccessful issues to both mother and children, despite the presence of\r\nperitonitis the last time. He had operated in 1826, 1830, 1832, and\r\n1836. Coe and Gueniot both mention cases in which Cesarean section had\r\nbeen twice performed with successful terminations as regards both\r\nmothers and children. Rosenberg tabulates a number of similar cases\r\nfrom medical literature.\r\n\r\nCases of Cesarean section by the patient herself are most curious, but\r\nmay be readily believed if there is any truth in the reports of the\r\noperation being done in savage tribes. Felkin gives an account of a\r\nsuccessful case performed in his presence, with preservation of the\r\nlives of both mother and child, by a native African in Kahura, Uganda\r\nCountry. The young girl was operated on in the crudest manner, the\r\nhemorrhage being checked by a hot iron. The sutures were made by means\r\nof seven thin, hot iron spikes, resembling acupressure-needles, closing\r\nthe peritoneum and skin. The wound healed in eleven days, and the\r\nmother made a complete recovery. Thomas Cowley describes the case of a\r\nnegro woman who, being unable to bear the pains of labor any longer,\r\ntook a sharp knife and made a deep incision in her belly--deep enough\r\nto wound the buttocks of her child, and extracted the child, placenta\r\nand all. A negro horse-doctor was called, who sewed the wound up in a\r\nmanner similar to the way dead bodies are closed at the present time.\r\n\r\nBarker gives the instance of a woman who, on being abused by her\r\nhusband after a previous tedious labor, resolved to free herself of the\r\nchild, and slyly made an incision five inches long on the left side of\r\nthe abdomen with a weaver's knife. When Barker arrived the patient was\r\nliterally drenched with blood and to all appearance dead. He extracted\r\na dead child from the abdomen and bandaged the mother, who lived only\r\nforty hours. In his discourses on Tropical Diseases Moseley speaks of a\r\nyoung negress in Jamaica who opened her uterus and extracted therefrom\r\na child which lived six days; the woman recovered. Barker relates\r\nanother case in Rensselaer County, N.Y., in which the incision was made\r\nwith the razor, the woman likewise recovering. There is an interesting\r\naccount of a poor woman at Prischtina, near the Servian frontier, who,\r\nsuffering greatly from the pains of labor, resolved to open her abdomen\r\nand uterus. She summoned a neighbor to sew up the incision after she\r\nhad extracted the child, and at the time of report, several months\r\nlater, both the mother and child were doing well.\r\n\r\nMadigan cites the case of a woman of thirty-four, in her seventh\r\nconfinement, who, while temporarily insane, laid open her abdomen with\r\na razor, incised the uterus, and brought out a male child.  The\r\nabdominal wound was five inches long, and extended from one inch above\r\nthe umbilicus straight downward. There was little or no bleeding and\r\nthe uterus was firmly contracted. She did not see a physician for three\r\nhours. The child was found dead and, with the placenta, was lying by\r\nher side. The neighbors were so frightened by the awful sight that they\r\nran away, or possibly the child might have been saved by ligature of\r\nthe funis. Not until the arrival of the clergyman was anything done,\r\nand death ultimately ensued.\r\n\r\nA most wonderful case of endurance of pain and heroism was one\r\noccurring in Italy, which attracted much European comment at the time.\r\nA young woman, illegitimately pregnant, at full term, on March 28th, at\r\ndawn, opened her own abdomen on the left side with a common knife such\r\nas is generally used in kitchens. The wound measured five inches, and\r\nwas directed obliquely outward and downward. She opened the uterus in\r\nthe same direction, and endeavored to extract the fetus. To expedite\r\nthe extraction, she drew out an arm and amputated it, and finding the\r\nextraction still difficult, she cut off the head and completely emptied\r\nthe womb, including the placenta. She bound a tight bandage around her\r\nbody and hid the fetus in a straw mattress. She then dressed herself\r\nand attended to her domestic duties. She afterward mounted a cart and\r\nwent into the city of Viterbo, where she showed her sister a cloth\r\nbathed in blood as menstrual proof that she was not pregnant. On\r\nreturning home, having walked five hours, she was seized with an attack\r\nof vomiting and fainted. The parents called Drs. Serpieri and Baliva,\r\nwho relate the case.  Thirteen hours had elapsed from the infliction of\r\nthe wound, through which the bulk of the intestines had been protruding\r\nfor the past six hours. The abdomen was irrigated, the toilet made, and\r\nafter the eighteenth day the process of healing was well progressed,\r\nand the woman made a recovery after her plucky efforts to hide her\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nCases like the foregoing excite no more interest than those on record\r\nin which an abdominal section has been accidental, as, for instance, by\r\ncattle-horns, and the fetus born through the wound.  Zuboldie speaks of\r\na case in which a fetus was born from the wound made by a bull's horn\r\nin the mother's abdomen. Deneux describes a case in which the wound\r\nmade by the horn was not sufficiently large to permit the child's\r\nescape, but it was subsequently brought through the opening. Pigne\r\nspeaks of a woman of thirty-eight, who in the eighth month of her sixth\r\npregnancy was gored by a bull, the horn effecting a transverse wound 27\r\ninches long, running from one anterior spine to the other. The woman\r\nwas found cold and insensible and with an imperceptible pulse. The\r\nsmall intestines were lying between the thighs and covered with\r\ncoagulated blood. In the process of cleansing, a male child was\r\nexpelled spontaneously through a rent in the uterus. The woman was\r\ntreated with the usual precautions and was conscious at midday. In a\r\nmonth she was up. She lived twenty years without any inconvenience\r\nexcept that due to a slight hernia on the left side. The child died at\r\nthe end of a fortnight.\r\n\r\nIn a very exhaustive article Harris of Philadelphia has collected\r\nnearly all the remaining cases on record, and brief extracts from some\r\nof them will be given below. In Zaandam, Holland, 1647, a farmer's wife\r\nwas tossed by a furious bull. Her abdomen was ripped open, and the\r\nchild and membranes escaped. The child suffered no injuries except a\r\nbruised upper lip and lived nine months. The mother died within forty\r\nhours of her injuries.  Figure 19 taken from an engraving dated 1647,\r\nrepresents an accouchement by a mad bull, possibly the same case. In\r\nDillenberg, Germany, in 1779, a multipara was gored by an ox at her\r\nsixth month of pregnancy; the horn entered the right epigastric region,\r\nthree inches from the linea alba, and perforated the uterus. The right\r\narm of the fetus protruded; the wound was enlarged and the fetus and\r\nplacenta delivered. Thatcher speaks of a woman who was gored by a cow\r\nin King's Park, and both mother and child were safely delivered and\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\nIn the Parish of Zecoytia, Spain, in 1785, Marie Gratien was gored by\r\nan ox in the superior portion of her epigastrium, making a wound eight\r\ninches long which wounded the uterus in the same direction. Dr. Antonio\r\ndi Zubeldia and Don Martin Monaco were called to take charge of the\r\ncase. While they were preparing to effect delivery by the vagina, the\r\nwoman, in an attack of singultus, ruptured the line of laceration and\r\nexpelled the fetus, dead. On the twenty-first day the patient was doing\r\nwell.  The wound closed at the end of the sixteenth week. The woman\r\nsubsequently enjoyed excellent health and, although she had a small\r\nventral hernia, bore and nursed two children.\r\n\r\nMarsh cites the instance of a woman of forty-two, the mother of eight\r\nchildren, who when eight months pregnant was horned by a cow. Her\r\nclothes were not torn, but she felt that the child had slipped out, and\r\nshe caught it in her dress. She was seen by some neighbors twelve yards\r\nfrom the place of accident, and was assisted to her house. The bowels\r\nprotruded and the child was separated from the funis. A physician saw\r\nthe woman three-quarters of an hour afterward and found her pulseless\r\nand thoroughly exhausted. There was considerable but not excessive loss\r\nof blood, and several feet of intestine protruded through the wound.\r\nThe womb was partially inverted through the wound, and the placenta was\r\nstill attached to the inverted portion. The wound in the uterus was\r\nY-shaped. The mother died in one and a half hours from the reception of\r\nher injuries, but the child was uninjured.\r\n\r\nScott mentions the instance of a woman thirty-four years old who was\r\ngored by an infuriated ox while in the ninth month of her eighth\r\npregnancy. The horn entered at the anterior superior spinous process of\r\nthe ilium, involving the parietes and the uterus. The child was\r\nextruded through the wound about half an hour after the occurrence of\r\nthe accident. The cord was cut and the child survived and thrived,\r\nthough the mother soon died.  Stalpart tells the almost incredible\r\nstory of a soldier's wife who went to obtain water from a stream and\r\nwas cut in two by a cannonball while stooping over. A passing soldier\r\nobserved something to move in the water, which, on investigation, he\r\nfound to be a living child in its membranes. It was christened by order\r\nof one Cordua and lived for some time after.\r\n\r\nPostmortem Cesarean Section.--The possibility of delivering a child by\r\nCesarean section after the death of the mother has been known for a\r\nlong time to the students of medicine. In the olden times there were\r\nlaws making compulsory the opening of the dead bodies of pregnant women\r\nshortly after death. Numa Pompilius established the first law, which\r\nwas called \"les regia,\" and in later times there were many such\r\nordinances. A full description of these laws is on record. Life was\r\nbelieved possible after a gestation of six months or over, and, as\r\nstated, some famous men were supposed to have been born in this manner.\r\nFrancois de Civile, who on great occasions signed himself \"trois fois\r\nenterre et trois fois par le grace de Dieu ressucite,\" saw the light of\r\nthe world by a happy Cesarean operation on his exhumed mother.\r\nFabricius Hildanus and Boarton report similar instances. Bourton cites\r\namong others the case of an infant who was found living twelve hours\r\nafter the death of his mother. Dufour and Mauriceau are two older\r\nFrench medical writers who discuss this subject.  Flajani speaks of a\r\ncase in which a child was delivered at the death of its mother, and\r\nsome of the older Italian writers discuss the advisability of the\r\noperation in the moribund state before death actually ensues. Heister\r\nwrites of the delivery of the child after the death of the mother by\r\nopening the abdomen and uterus.\r\n\r\nHarris relates several interesting examples. In Peru in 1794 a Sambi\r\nwoman was killed by lightning, and the next day the abdomen was opened\r\nby official command and a living child was extracted.  The Princess von\r\nSwartzenberg, who was burned to death at a ball in Paris in 1810, was\r\nsaid to have had a living child removed from her body the next day.\r\nLike all similar instances, this was proved to be false, as her body\r\nwas burned beyond the possibility of recognition, and, besides, she was\r\nonly four months pregnant.  Harris mentions another case of a young\r\nwoman who threw herself from the Pont Neuf into the Seine. Her body was\r\nrecovered, and a surgeon who was present seized a knife from a butcher\r\nstanding by and extracted a living child in the presence of the curious\r\nspectators. Campbell discusses this subject most thoroughly, though he\r\nadvances no new opinions upon it.\r\n\r\nDuer tabulates the successful results of a number of cases of Cesarean\r\nsection after death as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Children extracted\r\n  between 1 and 5 minutes after death of the mother, 21\r\n  \"   \"   10 and 15   \"    \"    \"   \"    \"    \"      13\r\n  \"   \"   15 and 30   \"    \"    \"   \"    \"    \"       2\r\n  \"   \"   1 hour      \"    \"    \"   \"    \"    \"       2\r\n  \"   \"   2 hours     \"    \"    \"   \"    \"    \"       2\r\n\r\nGarezky of St. Petersburg collected reports of 379 cases of Cesarean\r\nsection after death with the following results: 308 were extracted\r\ndead; 37 showed signs of life; 34 were born alive. Of the 34, only 5\r\nlived for any length of time. He concludes that if extracted within\r\nfive or six minutes after death, they may be born alive; if from six to\r\nten minutes, they may still be born alive, though asphyxiated; if from\r\nten to twenty-six minutes, they will be highly asphyxiated. In a great\r\nnumber of these cases the infant was asphyxiated or dead in one minute.\r\nOf course, if the death is sudden, as by apoplexy, accident, or\r\nsuicide, the child's chances are better. These statistics seem\r\nconscientious and reliable, and we are safe in taking them as\r\nindicative of the usual result, which discountenances the old reports\r\nof death as taking place some time before extraction.\r\n\r\nPeuch is credited with statistics showing that in 453 operations 101\r\nchildren gave signs of life, but only 45 survived.\r\n\r\nDuring the Commune of Paris, Tarnier, one night at the Maternite, was\r\ncalled to an inmate who, while lying in bed near the end of pregnancy,\r\nhad been killed by a ball which fractured the base of the skull and\r\nentered the brain. He removed the child by Cesarean section and it\r\nlived for several days. In another case a pregnant woman fell from a\r\nwindow for a distance of more than 30 feet, instant death resulting;\r\nthirty minutes at least after the death of the mother an infant was\r\nremoved, which, after some difficulty, was resuscitated and lived for\r\nthirteen years.  Tarnier states that delivery may take place\r\nthree-quarters of an hour or even an hour after the death of the\r\nmother, and he also quotes an extraordinary case by Hubert of a\r\nsuccessful Cesarean operation two hours after the mother's death; the\r\nwoman, who was eight months pregnant, was instantly killed while\r\ncrossing a railroad track.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoffman records the case of a successful Cesarean section done ten\r\nminutes after death. The patient was a woman of thirty-six, in her\r\neighth month of pregnancy, who was suddenly seized with eclampsia,\r\nwhich terminated fatally in ten hours. Ten minutes after her last\r\nrespiration the Cesarean section was performed and a living male child\r\ndelivered. This infant was nourished with the aid of a spoon, but it\r\ndied in twenty-five hours in consequence of its premature birth and\r\nenfeebled vitality.\r\n\r\nGreen speaks of a woman, nine months pregnant, who was run over by a\r\nheavily laden stage-coach in the streets of Southwark. She died in\r\nabout twenty minutes, and in about twenty minutes more a living child\r\nwas extracted from her by Cesarean section. There was a similar case in\r\nthe Hopital St. Louis, in Paris, in 1829; but in this case the child\r\nwas born alive five minutes after death. Squire tells of a case in\r\nwhich the mother died of dilatation of the aorta, and in from twenty to\r\nthirty minutes the child was saved. In comment on this case Aveling is\r\nquoted as saying that he believed it possible to save a child one hour\r\nafter the death of the mother. No less an authority than Playfair\r\nspeaks of a case in which a child was born half an hour after the death\r\nof the mother. Beckman relates the history of a woman who died suddenly\r\nin convulsions. The incision was made about five minutes after death,\r\nand a male child about four pounds in weight was extracted. The child\r\nexhibited feeble heart-contractions and was despaired of. Happily,\r\nafter numerous and persistent means of resuscitation, applied for about\r\ntwo and a half hours, regular respirations were established and the\r\nchild eventually recovered.  Walter reports a successful instance of\r\nremoval of the child after the death of the mother from apoplexy.\r\n\r\nCleveland gives an account of a woman of forty-seven which is of\r\nspecial interest. The mother had become impregnated five months after\r\nthe cessation of menstruation, and a uterine sound had been used in\r\nignorance of the impregnation at this late period. The mother died, and\r\none hour later a living child was extracted by Cesarean section. There\r\nare two other recent cases recorded of extraction after an hour had\r\nexpired from the death. One is cited by Veronden in which the\r\nextraction was two hours after death, a living child resulting, and the\r\nother by Blatner in which one hour had elapsed after death, when the\r\nchild was taken out alive.\r\n\r\nCases of rupture of the uterus during pregnancy from the pressure of\r\nthe contents and delivery of the fetus by some unnatural passage are\r\nfound in profusion through medical literature, and seem to have been of\r\nspecial interest to the older observers.  Benivenius saw a case in\r\nwhich the uterus ruptured and the intestines protruded from the vulva.\r\nAn instance similar to the one recorded by Benivenius is also found in\r\nthe last century in Germany. Bouillon and Desbois, two French\r\nphysicians of the last century, both record examples of the uterus\r\nrupturing in the last stages of pregnancy and the mother recovering.\r\nSchreiber gives an instance of rupture of the uterus occasioned by the\r\npresence of a 13-pound fetus, and there is recorded the account of a\r\nrupture caused by a 20-pound fetus that made its way into the abdomen.\r\nWe find old accounts of cases of rupture of the uterus with birth by\r\nthe umbilicus and the recovery of the woman. Vespre describes a case in\r\nwhich the uterus was ruptured by the feet of the fetus.\r\n\r\nFarquharson has an account of a singular case in midwifery in which\r\nabdomen ruptured from the pressure of the fetus; and quite recently\r\nGeoghegan illustrates the possibilities of uterine pressure in\r\npregnancy by a postmortem examination after a fatal parturition, in\r\nwhich the stomach was found pushed through the diaphragm and lying\r\nunder the left clavicle. Heywood Smith narrates the particulars of a\r\ncase of premature labor at seven months in which rupture of the uterus\r\noccurred and, notwithstanding the fact that the case was complicated by\r\nplacenta praevia, the patient recovered.\r\n\r\nRupture of the uterus and recovery does not necessarily prevent\r\nsubsequent successful pregnancy and delivery by the natural channels.\r\nWhinery relates an instance of a ruptured uterus in a healthy Irish\r\nwoman of thirty-seven from whom a dead child was extracted by abdominal\r\nsection and who was safely delivered of a healthy female child about\r\none year afterward. Analogous to this case is that of Lawrence, who\r\ndetails the instance of a woman who had been delivered five times of\r\ndead children; she had a very narrow pelvis and labor was always\r\ninduced at the eighth month to assure delivery. In her sixth pregnancy\r\nshe had miscalculated her time, and, in consequence, her uterus\r\nruptured in an unexpected parturition, but she recovered and had\r\nseveral subsequent pregnancies.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there is a spontaneous rupture of the vagina during the\r\nprocess of parturition, the uterus remaining intact.  Wiltshire reports\r\nsuch a case in a woman who had a most prominent sacrum; the laceration\r\nwas transverse and quite extensive, but the woman made a good recovery.\r\nSchauta pictures an exostosis on the promontory of the sacrum.\r\nBlenkinsop cites an instance in which the labor was neither protracted\r\nnor abnormally severe, yet the rupture of the vagina took place with\r\nthe escape of the child into the abdomen of the mother, and was from\r\nthence extracted by Cesarean section. A peculiarity of this case was\r\nthe easy expulsion from the uterus, no instrumental or other manual\r\ninterference being attempted and the uterus remaining perfectly intact.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there is extensive sloughing of the genitals after\r\nparturition with recovery far beyond expectation. Gooch mentions a case\r\nin which the whole vagina sloughed, yet to his surprise the patient\r\nrecovered. Aetius and Benivenius speak of recovery in such cases after\r\nloss of the whole uterus. Cazenave of Bordeaux relates a most marvelous\r\ncase in which a primipara suffered in labor from an impacted head. She\r\nwas twenty-five, of very diminutive stature, and was in labor a long\r\ntime. After labor, sloughing of the parts commenced and progressed to\r\nsuch an extent that in one month there were no traces of the labia,\r\nnymphae, vagina, perineum, or anus. There was simply a large opening\r\nextending from the meatus urinarius to the coccyx. The rectovaginal\r\nseptum, the lower portion of the rectum, and the neck of the bladder\r\nwere obliterated. The woman survived, although she always experienced\r\ngreat difficulty in urination and in entirely emptying the rectum. A\r\nsimilar instance is reported in a woman of thirty who was thirty-six\r\nhours in labor. The fundus of the uterus descended into the vagina and\r\nthe whole uterine apparatus was removed. The lower part of the rectum\r\ndepended between the labia; in the presence of the physician the nurse\r\ndrew this out and it separated at the sphincter ani. On examining the\r\nparts a single opening was seen, as in the preceding case, from the\r\npubes to the coccyx. Some time afterward the end of the intestine\r\ndescended several inches and hung loosely on the concave surface of the\r\nrectum. A sponge was introduced to support the rectum and prevent\r\naccess of air. The destruction of the parts was so complete and the\r\nopening so large as to bring into view the whole inner surface of the\r\npelvis, in spite of which, after prolonged suppuration, the wound\r\ncicatrized from behind forward and health returned, except as regards\r\nthe inconvenience of feces and urine. Milk-secretion appeared late and\r\nlasted two months without influencing the other functions.\r\n\r\nThere are cases in which, through the ignorance of the midwife or the\r\nphysician, prolapsed pelvic organs are mistaken for afterbirth and\r\nextracted. There have been instances in which the whole uterus and its\r\nappendages, not being recognized, have been dragged out. Walters cites\r\nthe instance of a woman of twenty-two, who was in her third\r\nconfinement. The midwife in attendance, finding the afterbirth did not\r\ncome away, pulled at the funis, which broke at its attachment. She then\r\nintroduced her hand and tore away what proved to be the whole of the\r\nuterus, with the right ovary and fallopian tube, a portion of the round\r\nligament, and the left tube and ovarian ligament attached to it. A\r\nlarge quantity of omentum protruded from the vulva and upper part of\r\nthe vagina, and an enormous rent was left. Walters saw the woman\r\ntwenty-one hours afterward, and ligated and severed the protruding\r\nomentum. On the twenty-eighth day, after a marvelous recovery, she was\r\nable to drive to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, a distance of five\r\nmiles. At the time of report, two years and six months after the\r\nmutilation, she was in perfect health.  Walters looked into the\r\nstatistics of such cases and found 36 accidental removals of the uterus\r\nin the puerperium with 14 recoveries. All but three of these were\r\nwithout a doubt attended by previous inversion of the uterus.\r\n\r\nA medical man was tried for manslaughter in 1878 because he made a\r\nsimilar mistake. He had delivered a woman by means of the forceps, and,\r\nafter delivery, brought away what he thought a tumor. This \"tumor\"\r\nconsisted of the uterus, with the placenta attached to the fundus, the\r\nfunis, a portion of the lateral ligament, containing one ovary and\r\nabout three inches of vagina.  The uterus was not inverted. A horrible\r\ncase, with similar results, happened in France, and was reported by\r\nTardieu. A brutal peasant, whose wife was pregnant, dragged out a fetus\r\nof seven months, together with the uterus and the whole intestinal\r\ncanal, from within 50 cm. of the pylorus to within 8 cm. of the\r\nileocecal valve. The woman was seen three-quarters of an hour after the\r\nintestines had been found in the yard (where the brute had thrown\r\nthem), still alive and reproaching her murderer.  Hoffman cites an\r\ninstance in which a midwife, in her anxiety to extract the afterbirth,\r\nmade traction on the cord, brought out the uterus, ovaries, and tubes,\r\nand tore the vulva and perineum as far as the anus.\r\n\r\nWoodson tells the story of a negress who was four months pregnant, and\r\nwho, on being seized with severe uterine pains in a bath, succeeded in\r\nseizing the fetus and dragging it out, but inverting the uterus in the\r\noperation. There is a case recorded of a girl of eighteen, near her\r\nlabor, who, being driven from her house by her father, took refuge in a\r\nneighboring house, and soon felt the pains of child-birth. The\r\naccoucheur was summoned, pronounced them false pains, and went away. On\r\nhis return he found the girl dying, with her uterus completely inverted\r\nand hanging between her legs. This unfortunate maiden had been\r\ndelivered while standing upright, with her elbows on the back of a\r\nchair. The child suddenly escaped, bringing with it the uterus, but as\r\nthe funis ruptured the child fell to the floor. Wagner pictures partial\r\nprolapse of the womb in labor.\r\n\r\nIt would too much extend this chapter to include the many accidents\r\nincident to labor, and only a few of especial interest will be given.\r\nCases like rupture of an aneurysm during labor, extensive hemorrhage,\r\nthe entrance of air into the uterine veins and sinuses, and common\r\nlacerations will be omitted, together with complicated births like\r\nthose of double monsters, etc., but there are several other cases that\r\ndeserve mention. Eldridge gives an instance of separation of the\r\nsymphysis pubis during labor,--a natural symphysiotomy. A separation of\r\n3/4 inch could be discerned at the symphysis, and in addition the\r\nsacroiliac synchondrosis was also quite movable. The woman had not been\r\nable to walk in the latter part of her pregnancy. The child weighed 10\r\n1/2 pounds and had a large head in a remarkably advanced stage of\r\nossification, with the fontanelles nearly closed. Delivery was\r\neffected, though during the passage of the head the pubes separated to\r\nsuch an extent that Eldridge placed two fingers between them. The\r\nmother recovered, and had perfect union and normal locomotion.\r\n\r\nSanders reports a case of the separation of the pubic bones in labor.\r\nStudley mentions a case of fracture of the pelvis during instrumental\r\ndelivery. Humphreys cites a most curious instance.  The patient, it\r\nappears, had a large exostosis on the body of the pubes which, during\r\nparturition, was forced through the walls of the uterus and bladder,\r\nresulting in death. Kilian reports four cases of death from perforation\r\nof the uterus in this manner.  Schauta pictures such an exostosis.\r\n\r\nChandler relates an instance in which there was laceration of the liver\r\nduring parturition; and Hubbard records a case of rupture of the spleen\r\nafter labor.\r\n\r\nSymphysiotomy is an operation consisting of division of the pubic\r\nsymphysis in order to facilitate delivery in narrow pelves. This\r\noperation has undergone a most remarkable revival during the past two\r\nyears. It originated in a suggestion by Pineau in his work on surgery\r\nin 1598, and in 1665 was first performed by La Courvee upon a dead body\r\nin order to save the child, and afterward by Plenk, in 1766, for the\r\nsame purpose. In 1777 Sigault first proposed the operation on the\r\nliving, and Ferrara was the one to carry out, practically, the\r\nproposition,--although Sigault is generally considered to be the first\r\nsymphysiotormist, and the procedure is very generally known as the\r\n\"Sigaultean operation.\" From Ferrara's time to 1858, when the operation\r\nhad practically died out, it had been performed 85 times, with a\r\nrecorded mortality of 33 per cent. In 1866 the Italians, under the\r\nleadership of Morisani of Naples, revived the operation, and in twenty\r\nyears had performed it 70 times with a mortality of 24 per cent. Owing\r\nto rigid antiseptic technic, the last 38 of these operations (1886 to\r\n1891) showed a mortality of only 50 per cent, while the\r\ninfant-mortality was only 10 2/3 per cent. The modern history of this\r\noperation is quite interesting, and is very completely reviewed by\r\nHirst and Dorland.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1893, Hirst reported 212 operations since 1887, with a\r\nmaternal mortality of 12.73 per cent and a fetal mortality of 28 per\r\ncent. In his later statistics Morisani gives 55 cases with 2 maternal\r\ndeaths and 1 infantile death, while Zweifel reports 14 cases from the\r\nLeipzig clinic with no maternal death and 2 fetal deaths, 1 from\r\nasphyxia and 1 from pneumonia, two days after birth. All the modern\r\nstatistics are correspondingly encouraging.\r\n\r\nIrwin reports a case in which the firm attachment of the fetal head to\r\nthe uterine parietes rendered delivery without artificial aid\r\nimpossible, and it was necessary to perform craniotomy. The right\r\ntemporal region of the child adhered to the internal surface of the\r\nneck of the uterus, being connected by membranes.  The woman was\r\nforty-four years old, and the child was her fourth.\r\n\r\nDelay in the Birth of the Second Twin.--In twin pregnancies there is\r\nsometimes a delay of many days in the birth of a second child, even to\r\nsuch an extent as to give suspicion of superfetation.  Pignot speaks of\r\none twin two months before the other. De Bosch speaks of a delay of\r\nseventeen days; and there were 2 cases on record in France in the last\r\ncentury, one of which was delayed ten days, and the other showed an\r\ninterval of seven weeks between the delivery of the twins. There is an\r\nold case on record in which there was an interval of six weeks between\r\ndeliveries; Jansen gives an account of three births in ten months;\r\nPinart mentions a case with an interval of ten days; Thilenius, one of\r\nthirteen days; and Ephemerides, one of one week. Wildberg describes a\r\ncase in which one twin was born two months after the other, and there\r\nwas no secretion of milk until after the second birth. A full\r\ndescription of Wildberg's case is given in another journal in brief, as\r\nfollows: A woman, eighteen months married, was in labor in the eighth\r\nmonth of pregnancy. She gave birth to a child, which, though not fully\r\nmatured, lived. There was no milk-secretion in her breasts, and she\r\ncould distinctly feel the movements of another child; her abdomen\r\nincreased in size. After two months she had another labor, and a fully\r\ndeveloped and strong child was born, much heavier than the first. On\r\nthe third day after, the breasts became enlarged, and she experienced\r\nconsiderable fever. It was noticeable in this case that a placenta was\r\ndischarged a quarter of an hour after the first birth. Irvine relates\r\nan instance of thirty-two days' delay; and Pfau one of seven days'.\r\n\r\nCarson cites the instance of a noblewoman of forty, the mother of four\r\nchildren, who was taken ill about two weeks before confinement was\r\nexpected, and was easily delivered of a male child, which seemed well\r\nformed, with perfect nails, but weakly.  After the birth the mother\r\nnever became healthy or natural in appearance. She was supposed to be\r\ndying of dropsy, but after forty-four days the mystery was cleared by\r\nthe birth of a fine, well-grown, and healthy daughter. Both mother and\r\nchild did well.\r\n\r\nAddison describes the case of a woman who was delivered of a healthy\r\nmale child, and everything was well until the evening of the fourth\r\nday, when intense labor-pains set in, and well-formed twins about the\r\nsize of a pigeon's egg were born. In this strange case, possibly an\r\nexample of superfetation, the patient made a good recovery and the\r\nfirst child lived. A similar case is reported by Lumby in which a woman\r\nwas delivered on January 18th, by a midwife, of a full-grown and\r\nhealthy female child. On the third day she came down-stairs and resumed\r\nher ordinary duties, which she continued until February 4th (seventeen\r\ndays after). At this time she was delivered of twins, a boy and a girl,\r\nhealthy and well-developed. The placenta was of the consistency of\r\njelly and had to be scooped away with the hand. The mother and children\r\ndid well. This woman was the mother of ten children besides the product\r\nof this conception, and at the latter occurrence had entire absence of\r\npains and a very easy parturition.\r\n\r\nPincott had a case with an interval of seven weeks between the births;\r\nVale 1 of two months; Bush 1 of seventeen days; and Burke 1 with an\r\ninterval of two months. Douglas cites an instance of twins being born\r\nfour days apart. Bessems of Antwerp, in 1866, mentions a woman with a\r\nbicornate uterus who bore two twins at fifty-four days' interval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPROLIFICITY.\r\n\r\nGeneral Historic Observations.--Prolificity is a much discussed\r\nsubject, for besides its medical and general interest it is of\r\nimportance in social as well as in political economy. Superfluous\r\npopulation was a question that came to consciousness early; Aristotle\r\nspoke of legislation to prevent the increase of population and the\r\nphysical and mental deterioration of the race,--he believed in a\r\npopulation fixed as regards numbers,--and later Lycurgus transformed\r\nthese precepts into a terrible law.  Strabonius reports that the\r\ninhabitants of Cathea brought their infants at the age of two months\r\nbefore a magistrate for inspection. The strong and promising were\r\npreserved and the weak destroyed. The founders of the Roman Empire\r\nfollowed a similar usage. With great indignation Seneca, Ovid, and\r\nJuvenal reproved this barbarity of the Romans. With the domination of\r\nChristianity this custom gradually diminished, and Constantine stopped\r\nit altogether, ordering succor to the people too poor to rear their own\r\nchildren. The old Celts were so jealous of their vigor that they placed\r\ntheir babes on a shield in the river, and regarded those that the waves\r\nrespected as legitimate and worthy to become members of their clans. In\r\nmany of the Oriental countries, where the population is often very\r\nexcessive and poverty great, the girl babies of the lower classes were\r\ndestroyed. At one time the crocodiles, held sacred in the Nile, were\r\ngiven the surplus infants. By destroying the females the breeding\r\nnecessarily diminished, and the number of the weaker and dependent\r\nclasses became less. In other countries persons having children beyond\r\ntheir ability to support were privileged to sell them to citizens, who\r\ncontracted to raise them on condition that they became their slaves.\r\n\r\nGeneral Law, and the Influence of War.--In the increase of the world's\r\npopulation, although circumstances may for the time alter it, a general\r\naverage of prolificity has, in the long run, been maintained. In the\r\nhistory of every nation artificial circumstances, such as fashion, war,\r\npoverty, etc., at some period have temporarily lowered the average of\r\nprolificity; but a further search finds another period, under opposite\r\ncircumstances, which will more than compensate for it. The effect of a\r\nlong-continued war or wars on generation and prolificity has never been\r\ngiven proper consideration. In such times marriages become much less\r\nfrequent; the husbands are separated from their wives for long periods;\r\nmany women are left widows; the females become in excess of the males;\r\nthe excitement of the times overtops the desire for sexual intercourse,\r\nor, if there is the same desire, the unprolific prostitute furnishes\r\nthe satisfaction; and such facts as these, coupled with many similar\r\nones, soon produce an astonishing effect upon the comparative\r\nbirth-rate and death-rate of the country. The resources of a country,\r\nso far as concerns population, become less as the period of\r\npeace-disturbance is prolonged. Mayo-Smith quotes von Mayr in the\r\nfollowing example of the influence of the war of 1870-71 on the\r\nbirth-rate in Bavaria,--the figures for births are thrown back nine\r\nmonths, so as to show the time of conception: Before the war under\r\nnormal conception the number of births was about 16,000 per month.\r\nDuring the war it sank to about 2000 per month.  Immediately on the\r\ncessation of hostilities it arose to its former number, while the\r\nactual return of the troops brought an increase of 2000 per month. The\r\nmaximum was reached in March, 1872, when it was 18,450. The war of 1866\r\nseems to have passed over Germany without any great influence, the\r\nbirth-rate in 1865 being 39.2; in 1866, 39.4; in 1867, 38.3; in 1868,\r\n38.4. On the other hand, while the birth-rate in 1870 was 40.1, in 1871\r\nit was only 35.9; in 1872 it recovered to 41.1, and remained above 41\r\ndown to 1878. Von Mayr believes the war had a depressing influence upon\r\nthe rate apart from the mere absence of the men, as shown in the fact\r\nthat immediately upon the cessation of hostilities it recovered in\r\nBavaria, although it was several months before the return of the troops.\r\n\r\nMayo-Smith, in remarking on the influence of war on the marriage-rate,\r\nsays that in 1866 the Prussian rate fell from 18.2 to 15.6, while the\r\nAustrian rate fell from 15.5 to 13.0. In the war of 1870-71 the\r\nPrussian rate fell from 17.9 in 1869 to 14.9 in 1870 and 15.9 in 1871;\r\nbut in the two years after peace was made it rose to 20.6 and 20.2, the\r\nhighest rates ever recorded.  In France the rate fell from 16.5 to 12.1\r\nand 14.4, and then rose to 19.5 and 17.7, the highest rates ever\r\nrecorded in France.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Rural and Urban Life.--Rural districts are always very\r\nprolific, and when we hear the wails of writers on \"Social Economy,\"\r\nbemoaning the small birth-rates of their large cities, we need have no\r\nfear for urban extinction, as emigration from the country by many\r\nambitious sons and daughters, to avail themselves of the superior\r\nadvantages that the city offers, will not only keep up but to a certain\r\npoint increase the population, until the reaction of overcrowding,\r\nfollowing the self-regulating law of compensation, starts a return\r\nemigration.\r\n\r\nThe effect of climate and race on prolificity, though much spoken of,\r\nis not so great a factor as supposed. The inhabitants of Great Britain\r\nare surpassed by none in the point of prolificity; yet their location\r\nis quite northern. The Swedes have always been noted for their\r\nfecundity. Olaf Rudbeck says that from 8 to 12 was the usual family\r\nnumber, and some ran as high as 25 or 30.  According to Lord Kames, in\r\nIceland before the plague (about 1710) families of from 15 to 20 were\r\nquite common. The old settlers in cold North America were always\r\nblessed with large families, and Quebec is still noted for its\r\nprolificity. There is little difference in this respect among nations,\r\nwoman being limited about the same everywhere, and the general average\r\nof the range of the productive function remaining nearly identical in\r\nall nations. Of course, exception must be made as to the extremes of\r\nnorth or south.\r\n\r\nAncient and Modern Prolificity.--Nor is there much difference between\r\nancient and modern times. We read in the writings of Aristotle, Pliny,\r\nand Albucasis of the wonderful fertility of the women of Egypt, Arabia,\r\nand other warm countries, from 3 to 6 children often being born at once\r\nand living to maturity; but from the wonder and surprise shown in the\r\nnarration of these facts, they were doubtless exceptions, of which\r\nparallels may be found in the present day. The ancient Greek and Roman\r\nfamilies were no larger than those of to-day, and were smaller in the\r\nzenith of Roman affluence, and continued small until the period of\r\ndecadence.\r\n\r\nLegal Encouragement of Prolificity.--In Quebec Province, Canada,\r\naccording to a Montreal authority, 100 acres of land are allotted to\r\nthe father who has a dozen children by legitimate marriage.  The same\r\njournal states that, stimulated by the premium offered, families of 20\r\nor more are not rare, the results of patriotic efforts. In 1895, 1742\r\n\"chefs de famille\" made their claim according to the conditions of the\r\nlaw, and one, Paul Bellanger, of the River du Loup, claimed 300 acres\r\nas his premium, based on the fact that he was the father of 36\r\nchildren. Another claimant, Monsieur Thioret de Sainte Genevieve, had\r\nbeen presented by his wife, a woman not yet thirty years old, with 17\r\nchildren. She had triplets twice in the space of five years and twins\r\nthrice in the mean time. It is a matter of conjecture what the effect\r\nwould be of such a premium in countries with a lowering birth-rate, and\r\na French medical journal, quoting the foregoing, regretfully wishes for\r\nsome countrymen at home like their brothers in Quebec.\r\n\r\nOld Explanations of Prolificity.--The old explanation of the causation\r\nof the remarkable exceptions to the rules of prolificity was similar to\r\nthat advanced by Empedocles, who says that the greater the quantity of\r\nsemen, the greater the number of children at birth. Pare, later, uses a\r\nsimilar reason to explain the causation of monstrosities, grouping them\r\ninto two classes, those due to deficiency of semen, such as the\r\nacephalous type, and those due to excess, such as the double monsters.\r\nHippocrates, in his work on the \"Nature of the Infant,\" tells us that\r\ntwins are the result of a single coitus, and we are also informed that\r\neach infant has a chorion; so that both kinds of plural gestation\r\n(monochorionic and dichorionic) were known to the ancients. In this\r\ntreatise it is further stated that the twins may be male or female, or\r\nboth males or both females; the male is formed when the semen is thick\r\nand strong.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of children at a single birth that it is possible\r\nfor a woman to have has never been definitely determined. Aristotle\r\ngives it as his opinion that one woman can bring forth no more than 5\r\nchildren at a single birth, and discredits reports of multiplicity\r\nabove this number; while Pliny, who is not held to be so trustworthy,\r\npositively states that there were authentic records of as many as 12 at\r\na birth.  Throughout the ages in which superstitious distortion of\r\nfacts and unquestioning credulity was unchecked, all sorts of\r\nincredible accounts of prolificity are found. Martin Cromerus, a Polish\r\nhistorian, quoted by Pare, who has done some good work in statistical\r\nresearch on this subject, says a that Margaret, of a noble and ancient\r\nfamily near Cracovia, the wife of Count Virboslaus, brought forth 36\r\nliving children on January 20, 1296.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated case of Countess Margaret, daughter of Florent IV, Earl\r\nof Holland, and spouse of Count Hermann of Henneberg, was supposed to\r\nhave occurred just before this, on Good Friday, 1278.  She was at this\r\ntime forty-two years of age, and at one birth brought forth 365\r\ninfants, 182 males, 182 females, and 1 hermaphrodite. They were all\r\nbaptized in two large brazen dishes by the Bishop of Treras, the males\r\nbeing called John, the females Elizabeth. During the last century the\r\nbasins were still on exhibition in the village church of Losdun, and\r\nmost of the visitors to Hague went out to see them, as they were\r\nreckoned one of the curiosities of Holland. The affliction was ascribed\r\nto the curse of a poor woman who, holding twins in her arms, approached\r\nthe Countess for aid. She was not only denied alms, but was insulted by\r\nbeing told that her twins were by different fathers, whereupon the poor\r\nwoman prayed God to send the Countess as many children as there were\r\ndays in the year. There is room for much speculation as to what this\r\ncase really was. There is a possibility that it was simply a case of\r\nhydatidiform or multiple molar pregnancy, elaborated by an exhaustive\r\nimagination and superstitious awe. As late as 1799 there was a woman of\r\na town of Andalusia who was reported to have been delivered of 16 male\r\ninfants, 7 of which were alive two months later.\r\n\r\nMayo-Smith remarks that the proportion of multiple births is not more\r\nthan 1 per cent of the total number of parturitions. The latest\r\nstatistics, by Westergaard, give the following averages to number of\r\ncases of 100 births in which there were 2 or more at a birth:--\r\n\r\n  Sweden,      1.45\r\n  Germany,     1.24\r\n  Bavaria,     1.38\r\n  Denmark,     1.34\r\n  Holland,     1.30\r\n  Prussia,     1.26\r\n  Scotland,    1.22\r\n  Norway,      1.32\r\n  Saxony,      1.20\r\n  Italy,       1.21\r\n  Austria,     1.17\r\n  Switzerland, 1.16\r\n  France,      0.99\r\n  Belgium,     0.97\r\n  Spain,       0.85\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, from 1826 to 1880, there were 85 cases of quadruplets and 3\r\ncases of 5 at a birth.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive statistics in regard to multiple births are those of\r\nVeit, who reviews 13,000,000 births in Prussia.  According to his\r\ndeductions, twins occur once in 88 births; triplets, once in 7910; and\r\nquadruplets, once in 371,126. Recent statistics supplied by the Boards\r\nof Health of New York and Philadelphia place the frequency of twin\r\nbirths in these cities at 1 in every 120 births, while in Bohemia twins\r\noccur once in about 60 births, a proportion just twice as great. Of\r\n150,000 twin pregnancies studied by Veit, in one-third both children\r\nwere boys; in slightly less than one-third both were girls; in the\r\nremaining third both sexes were represented.\r\n\r\nAuthentic records of 5 and 6 at a birth are extremely rare and\r\ninfinitesimal in proportion. The reputed births in excess of 6 must be\r\nlooked on with suspicion, and, in fact, in the great majority of\r\nreports are apochryphal.\r\n\r\nThe examples of multiple births of a single pregnancy will be taken up\r\nunder their respective numbers, several examples of each being given,\r\ntogether with the authorities. Many twin and triplet brothers have\r\nfigured prominently in history, and, in fact, they seem especially\r\nfavored. The instance of the Horatii and the Curatii, and their famous\r\nbattle, on which hung the fate of Rome and Alba, is familiar to every\r\none, their strength and wisdom being legendary with the Romans.\r\n\r\nTwins and triplets, being quite common, will not be considered here,\r\nalthough there are 2 cases of interest of the latter that deserve\r\ncitation. Sperling reports 2 instances of triplets; in the first there\r\nwas 1 placenta and chorion, 2 amnions, and the sex was the same; in the\r\nsecond case, in which the sexes were different, there were 3 placentas,\r\n3 chorions, and 3 amnions.  What significance this may have is only a\r\nmatter of conjecture.  Petty describes a case of triplets in which one\r\nchild was born alive, the other 2 having lost their vitality three\r\nmonths before. Mirabeau has recently found that triple births are most\r\ncommon (1 to 6500) in multiparous women between thirty and thirty-four\r\nyears of age. Heredity seems to be a factor, and duplex uteruses\r\npredispose to multiple births. Ross reports an instance of double\r\nuterus with triple pregnancy.\r\n\r\nQuadruplets are supposed to occur once in about every 400,000 births.\r\nThere are 72 instances recorded in the Index Catalogue of the Surgeon\r\nGeneral's Library, U. S. A., up to the time of compilation, not\r\nincluding the subsequent cases in the Index Medicus. At the Hotel-Dieu,\r\nin Paris, in 108,000 births, covering a period of sixty years, mostly\r\nin the last century, there was only one case of quadruplets. The\r\nfollowing extract of an account of the birth of quadruplets is given by\r\nDr. De Leon of Ingersoll, Texas:--\r\n\r\n\"I was called to see Mrs. E. T. Page, January 10, 1890, about 4 o'clock\r\nA.M.; found her in labor and at full time, although she assured me that\r\nher 'time' was six weeks ahead. At 8 o'clock A.M.  I delivered her of a\r\ngirl baby; I found there were triplets, and so informed her. At 11 A.M.\r\nI delivered her of the second girl, after having rectified\r\npresentation, which was singular, face, hands, and feet all presented;\r\nI placed in proper position and practised 'version.' This child was\r\n'still-born,' and after considerable effort by artificial respiration\r\nit breathed and came around 'all right.' The third girl was born at\r\n11.40 A.M.  This was the smallest one of the four. In attempting to\r\ntake away the placenta, to my astonishment I found the feet of another\r\nchild. At 1 P.M. this one was born; the head of this child got firmly\r\nimpacted at the lower strait, and it was with a great deal of\r\ndifficulty and much patient effort that it was finally disengaged; it\r\nwas blocked by a mass of placenta and cords. The first child had its\r\nown placenta; the second and third had their placenta; the fourth had\r\nalso a placenta. They weighed at birth in the aggregate 19 1/2 pounds\r\nwithout clothing; the first weighed 6 pounds; the second 5 pounds; the\r\nthird 4 1/2 pounds; the fourth 4 pounds. Mrs. Page is a blonde, about\r\nthirty-six years old, and has given birth to 14 children, twins three\r\ntimes before this, one pair by her first husband. She has been married\r\nto Page three years, and has had 8 children in that time. I have waited\r\non her each time. Page is an Englishman, small, with dark hair, age\r\nabout twenty-six, and weighs about 115 pounds. They are in St. Joseph,\r\nMo., now, having contracted with Mr. Uffner of New York to travel and\r\nexhibit themselves in Denver, St. Joseph, Omaha, and Nebraska City,\r\nthen on to Boston, Mass., where they will spend the summer.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a report from Canada of the birth of 4 living children at one\r\ntime. The mother, a woman of thirty-eight, of small stature, weighing\r\n100 pounds, had 4 living children of the ages of twelve, ten, eight,\r\nand seven years, respectively. She had aborted at the second month, and\r\nat full term was delivered of 2 males, weighing, respectively, 4 pounds\r\n9 1/4 ounces and 4 pounds 3 ounces; and of 2 females, weighing 4 pounds\r\n3 ounces and 3 pounds 13 3/4 ounces, respectively. There was but one\r\nplacenta, and no more exhaustion or hemorrhage than at a single birth.\r\nThe father weighed 169 pounds, was forty-one years old, and was 5 feet\r\n5 inches tall, healthy and robust. The Journal of St.  Petersburg, a\r\nnewspaper of the highest standard, stated that at the end of July,\r\n1871, a Jewish woman residing in Courland gave birth to 4 girls, and\r\nagain, in May, 1872, bore 2 boys and a girl; the mother and the 7\r\nchildren, born within a period of ten months, were doing well at the\r\ntime of the report. In the village of Iwokina, on May 26, 1854, the\r\nwife of a peasant bore 4 children at a birth, all surviving. Bousquet\r\nspeaks of a primiparous mother, aged twenty-four, giving birth to 4\r\nliving infants, 3 by the breech and 1 by the vertex, apparently all in\r\none bag of membranes. They were nourished by the help of 3 wet-nurses.\r\nBedford speaks of 4 children at a birth, averaging 5 pounds each, and\r\nall nursing the mother.\r\n\r\nQuintuplets are quite rare, and the Index Catalogue of the Surgeon\r\nGeneral's Library, U. S. A., gives only 19 cases, reports of a few of\r\nwhich will be given here, together with others not given in the\r\nCatalogue, and from less scientific though reliable sources. In the\r\nyear 1731 there was one case of quintuplets in Upper Saxony and another\r\nnear Prague, Bohemia. In both of these cases the children were all\r\nchristened and had all lived to maturity. Garthshore speaks of a\r\nhealthy woman, Margaret Waddington, giving birth to 5 girls, 2 of which\r\nlived; the 2 that lived weighed at birth 8 pounds 12 ounces and 9\r\npounds, respectively. He discusses the idea that woman was meant to\r\nbear more than one child at a birth, using as his argument the\r\nexistence of the double nipple and mamma, to which might be added the\r\nnot infrequent occurrence of polymazia.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1736, in a dairy cellar in the Strand, London, a poor woman\r\ngave birth to 3 boys and 9 girls. In the same journal was reported the\r\nbirth at Wells, Somersetshire, in 1739, of 4 boys and a girl, all of\r\nwhom were christened and were healthy. Pare in 1549 gives several\r\ninstances of 5 children at a birth, and Pliny reports that in the\r\npeninsula of Greece there was a woman who gave birth to quintuplets on\r\nfour different occasions. Petritus, a Greek physician, speaks of the\r\nbirth of quintuplets at the seventh month. Two males and one female\r\nwere born dead, being attached to the same placenta; the others were\r\nunited to a common placenta and lived three days. Chambon mentions an\r\ninstance of 5 at a birth. Not far from Berne, Switzerland, the wife of\r\nJohn Gelinger, a preacher in the Lordship of Berne, brought forth\r\ntwins, and within a year after she brought forth quintuplets, 3 sons\r\nand 2 daughters. There is a similar instance reported in 1827 of a\r\nwoman of twenty-seven who, having been delivered of twins two years\r\nbefore, was brought to bed with 5 children, 3 boys and 2 girls. Their\r\nlength was from 15 1/2 to 16 1/2 inches.  Although regularly formed,\r\nthey did not seem to have reached maturity. The mother was much\r\nexhausted, but recovered. The children appeared old-looking, had\r\ntremulous voices, and slept continually; during sleep their\r\ntemperatures seemed very low.\r\n\r\nKennedy showed before the Dublin Pathological Society 5 fetuses with\r\nthe involucra, the product of an abortion at the third month. At Naples\r\nin 1839 Giuseppa Califani gave birth to 5 children; and about the same\r\ntime Paddock reported the birth in Franklin County, Pa., of\r\nquintuplets. The Lancet relates an account of the birth of quintuplets,\r\n2 boys and 3 girls, by the wife of a peasant on March 1, 1854. Moffitt\r\nrecords the birth at Monticello, Ill., of quintuplets. The woman was\r\nthirty-five years of age; examination showed a breech presentation; the\r\nsecond child was born by a foot-presentation, as was the third, but the\r\nlast was by a head-presentation. The combined weight was something over\r\n19 pounds, and of the 5, 3 were still-born, and the other 2 died soon\r\nafter birth. The Elgin Courant (Scotland), 1858, speaks of a woman\r\nnamed Elspet Gordon, at Rothes, giving birth to 3 males and 2 females.\r\nAlthough they were six months' births, the boys all lived until the\r\nfollowing morning. The girls were still-born. One of the boys had two\r\nfront teeth when born.  Dr. Dawson of Rothes is the obstetrician\r\nmentioned in this case.\r\n\r\nThe following recent instance is given with full details to illustrate\r\nthe difficulties attending the births of quintuplets.  Stoker has\r\nreported the case of a healthy woman, thirty-five years old, 5 feet 1\r\ninch high, and of slight build, whom he delivered of 5 fetuses in the\r\nseventh month of pregnancy, none of the children surviving. The\r\npatient's mother had on two occasions given birth to twins. The woman\r\nherself had been married for six years and had borne 4 children at full\r\nterm, having no difficulty in labor. When she came under observation\r\nshe computed that she had been pregnant for six months, and had had her\r\nattention attracted to the unusually large size of her abdomen. She\r\ncomplained of fixed pain in the left side of the abdomen on which side\r\nshe thought she was larger. Pains set in with regularity and the labor\r\nlasted eight and three-quarter hours. After the rupture of the\r\nmembranes the first child presented by the shoulder.  Version was\r\nreadily performed; the child was dead (recently).  Examination after\r\nthe birth of the first child disclosed the existence of more than one\r\nremaining fetus. The membranes protruded and became tense with each\r\ncontraction. The presentation was a transverse one. In this case also\r\nthere was little difficulty in effecting internal version. The child\r\nlived a couple of hours. The third fetus was also enclosed in a\r\nseparate sac, which had to be ruptured. The child presented by the\r\nbreech and was delivered naturally, and lived for an hour. In the\r\nfourth case the membranes had likewise to be ruptured, and alarming\r\nhemorrhage ensued. Version was at once practised, but the chin became\r\nlocked with that of the remaining fetus. There was some difficulty and\r\nconsiderable delay in freeing the children, though the extent of\r\nlocking was not at any time formidable. The child was dead (recently).\r\nThe fifth fetus presented by the head and was delivered naturally. It\r\nlived for half an hour. The placenta was delivered about five minutes\r\nafter the birth of the last child, and consisted of two portions united\r\nby a narrow isthmus. One, the smaller, had two cords attached centrally\r\nand close together; the other, and larger, had two cords attached in a\r\nsimilar way and one where it was joined to the isthmus. The organ\r\nappeared to be perfectly healthy. The cord of the fourth child was so\r\nshort that it had to be ligated in the vagina. The children were all\r\nfemales and of about the same size, making a total weight of 8 pounds.\r\nThe mother rallied quickly and got on well.\r\n\r\nTrustworthy records of sextuplets are, of course, extremely scarce.\r\nThere are few catalogued at Washington, and but two authentic cases are\r\non record in the United States. On December 30, 1831, a woman in Dropin\r\nwas delivered of 6 daughters, all living, and only a little smaller\r\nthan usual in size. The mother was not quite twenty years old, but was\r\nof strong constitution.  The 6 lived long enough to be baptized, but\r\ndied the evening of their births. There was a case a of sextuplets in\r\nItaly in 1844.  In Maine, June 27, 1847, a woman was delivered of 6\r\nchildren, 2 surviving and, together with the mother, doing well. In\r\n1885 there was reported the birth of sextuplets in Lorca, Spain, of\r\nwhich only one survived. At Dallas, Texas, in 1888, Mrs. George Hirsh\r\nof Navarro County gave birth to 6 children, the mother and the children\r\nall doing well. There were 4 boys and 2 girls, and they were all\r\nperfect, well formed, but rather small.\r\n\r\nValsalli gives an instance which is quoted by the Medical News without\r\ngiving the authority. Valsalli's account, which differs slightly from\r\nthe account in the Medical News, is briefly as follows: While straining\r\nat stool on the one hundred and fifteenth day of pregnancy the\r\nmembranes ruptured and a foot prolapsed, no pain having been felt\r\nbefore the accident. A fetus was delivered by the midwife. Valsalli was\r\nsummoned and found the woman with an enormously distended abdomen,\r\nwithin which were felt numerous fetal parts; but no fetal heart-sounds\r\nor movements were noticed. The cervix was only slightly dilated, and,\r\nas no pains were felt, it was agreed to wait. On the next day the\r\nmembranes were ruptured and 4 more fetuses were delivered.  Traction on\r\nthe umbilical cord started hemorrhage, to check which the physician\r\nplaced his hand in the uterine cavity. In this most arduous position he\r\nremained four hours until assistance from Lugano came. Then, in the\r\npresence of the three visiting physicians, a sixth amniotic sac was\r\ndelivered with its fetus.  The woman had a normal convalescence, and in\r\nthe following year gave birth to healthy, living twins. The News says\r\nthe children all moved vigorously at birth; there were 4 males and 2\r\nfemales, and for the 6 there was only one placenta The mother,\r\naccording to the same authority, was thirty-six years of age, and was\r\nin her second pregnancy.\r\n\r\nMultiple Births over Six.--When we pass sextuplets the records of\r\nmultiple births are of the greatest rarity and in modern records there\r\nare almost none. There are several cases mentioned by the older writers\r\nwhose statements are generally worthy of credence, which, however\r\nincredible, are of sufficient interest at least to find a place in this\r\nchapter. Albucasis affirms that he knew of the birth of seven children\r\nat one time; and d'Alechampius reports that Bonaventura, the slave of\r\none Savelli, a gentleman of Siena, gave birth to 7 children, 4 of whom\r\nwere baptized. At the Parish of San Ildefonso, Valladolid, Julianna,\r\nwife of Benito Quesada, gave birth to 3 children in one day, and during\r\nthe following night to 4 more. Sigebert, in his Chronicles, says that\r\nthe mother of the King of Lombardy had borne 7 children at a birth.\r\nBorellus says that in 1650 the lady of the then present Lord Darre gave\r\nbirth to eight perfect children at one parturition and that it was the\r\nunusual event of the country.\r\n\r\nMrs. Timothy Bradlee of Trumbull County, Ohio, in 1872 is reported to\r\nhave given birth to 8 children at one time. They were healthy and\r\nliving, but quite small. The mother was married six years previously\r\nand then weighed 273 pounds. She had given birth to 2 pairs of twins,\r\nand, with these 3 boys and 5 girls, she had borne 12 children in six\r\nyears. She herself was a triplet and her father and her mother were of\r\ntwin births and one of her grandmothers was the mother of 5 pairs of\r\ntwins. This case was most celebrated and was much quoted, several\r\nBritish journals extracting it.\r\n\r\nWatering of Maregnac speaks of the simultaneous birth of 8 children at\r\none time. When several months pregnant the woman was seized with\r\ncolicky pains and thought them a call of nature. She went into a\r\nvineyard to answer it, and there, to her great astonishment, gave birth\r\nto 8 fetuses. Watering found them enclosed in a sac, and thought they\r\nprobably had died from mutual pressure during growth. The mother made a\r\ngood recovery.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 Seignette of Dijon reports the simultaneous birth of nine\r\nchildren. Franciscus Picus Mirandulae, quoted by Pare, says that one\r\nDorothea, an Italian, bore 20 children at 2 confinements, the first\r\ntime bearing 9 and the second time eleven. He gives a picture of this\r\nmarvel of prolificity, in which her belly is represented as hanging\r\ndown to her knees, and supported by a girdle from the neck. In the\r\nAnnals, History, and Guide to Leeds and York, according to Walford,\r\nthere is mention of Ann Birch, who in 1781 was delivered of 10\r\nchildren. One daughter, the sole survivor of the 10, married a market\r\ngardener named Platt, who was well known in Leeds. Jonston quotes\r\nBaytraff as saying that he knew of a case in which 9 children were born\r\nsimultaneously; and also says that the Countess of Altdorf gave birth\r\nto twelve at one birth. Albucasis mentions a case of fifteen\r\nwell-formed children at a birth. According to Le Brun, Gilles de\r\nTrazegines, who accompanied Saint Louis to Palestine, and who was made\r\nConstable of France, was one of thirteen infants at a simultaneous\r\naccouchement. The Marquise, his mother, was impregnated by her husband\r\nbefore his departure, and during his absence had 13 living children.\r\nShe was suspected by the native people and thought to be an adulteress,\r\nand some of the children were supposed to be the result of\r\nsuperfetation. They condemned them all to be drowned, but the Marquis\r\nappeared upon the scene about this time and, moved by compassion,\r\nacknowledged all 13.  They grew up and thrived, and took the name of\r\nTrazegines, meaning, in the old language, 13 drowned, although many\r\ncommentaries say that \"gines\" was supposed to mean in the twelfth\r\ncentury \"nes,\" or, in full, the interpretation would be \"13 born.\"\r\n\r\nCases in which there is a repetition of multiple births are quite\r\nnumerous, and sometimes so often repeated as to produce a family the\r\nsize of which is almost incredible. Aristotle is credited with saying\r\nthat he knew the history of a woman who had quintuplets four times.\r\nPliny's case of quintuplets four times repeated has been mentioned; and\r\nPare, who may be believed when he quotes from his own experience, says\r\nthat the wife of the last Lord de Maldemeure, who lived in the Parish\r\nof Seaux, was a marvel of prolificity. Within a year after her marriage\r\nshe gave birth to twins; in the next year to triplets; in the third\r\nyear to quadruplets; in the fourth year to quintuplets, and in the\r\nfifth year bore sextuplets; in this last labor she died. The then\r\npresent Lord de Maldemeure, he says, was one of the final sextuplets.\r\nThis case attracted great notice at the time, as the family was quite\r\nnoble and very well known. Seaux, their home, was near Chambellay.\r\nPicus Mirandulae gathered from the ancient Egyptian inscriptions that\r\nthe women of Egypt brought forth sometimes 8 children at a birth, and\r\nthat one woman bore 30 children in 4 confinements. He also cites, from\r\nthe history of a certain Bishop of Necomus, that a woman named Antonia,\r\nin the Territory of Mutina, Italy, now called Modena, had brought forth\r\n40 sons before she was forty years of age, and that she had had 3 and 4\r\nat a birth. At the auction of the San Donato collection of pictures a\r\nportrait of Dianora Frescobaldi, by one of the Bronzinos in the\r\nsixteenth century, sold for about $3000. At the bottom of this portrait\r\nwas an inscription stating that she was the mother of 52 children. This\r\nremarkable woman never had less than 3 at a birth, and tradition gives\r\nher as many as 6.\r\n\r\nMerriman quotes a case of a woman, a shopkeeper named Blunet, who had\r\n21 children in 7 successive births. They were all born alive, and 12\r\nstill survived and were healthy. As though to settle the question as to\r\nwhom should be given the credit in this case, the father or the mother,\r\nthe father experimented upon a female servant, who, notwithstanding her\r\nyouth and delicateness, gave birth to 3 male children that lived three\r\nweeks. According to despatches from Lafayette, Indiana, investigation\r\nfollowing the murder, on December 22, 1895, of Hester Curtis, an aged\r\nwoman of that city, developed the rather remarkable fact that she had\r\nbeen the mother of 25 children, including 7 pairs of twins.\r\n\r\nAccording to a French authority the wife of a medical man at\r\nFuentemajor, in Spain, forty-three years of age, was delivered of\r\ntriplets 13 times. Puech read a paper before the French Academy in\r\nwhich he reports 1262 twin births in Nimes from 1790 to 1875, and\r\nstates that of the whole number in 48 cases the twins were duplicated,\r\nand in 2 cases thrice repeated, and in one case 4 times repeated.\r\n\r\nWarren gives an instance of a lady, Mrs. M----, thirty-two years of\r\nage, married at fourteen, who, after the death of her first child, bore\r\ntwins, one living a month and the other six weeks.  Later she again\r\nbore twins, both of whom died. She then miscarried with triplets, and\r\nafterward gave birth to 12 living children, as follows: July 24, 1858,\r\n1 child; June 30, 1859, 2 children; March 24, 1860, 2 children; March\r\n1, 1861, 3 children; February 13, 1862, 4 children; making a total of\r\n21 children in eighteen years, with remarkable prolificity in the later\r\npregnancies. She was never confined to her bed more than three days,\r\nand the children were all healthy.\r\n\r\nA woman in Schlossberg, Germany, gave birth to twins; after a year, to\r\ntriplets, and again, in another year, to 3 fairly strong boys. In the\r\nState Papers, Domestic Series, Charles I, according to Walford, appears\r\nan extract from a letter from George Garrard to Viscount Conway, which\r\nis as follows: \"Sir John Melton, who entertained you at York, hath\r\nburied his wife, Curran's daughter.  Within twelve months she brought\r\nhim 4 sons and a daughter, 2 sons last summer, and at this birth 2 more\r\nand a daughter, all alive.\" Swan mentions a woman who gave birth to 6\r\nchildren in seventeen months in 2 triple pregnancies. The first\r\nterminated prematurely, 2 children dying at once, the other in five\r\nweeks.  The second was uneventful, the 3 children living at the time of\r\nthe report. Rockwell gives the report of a case of a woman of\r\ntwenty-eight, herself a twin, who gave birth to twins in January, 1879.\r\nThey died after a few weeks, and in March, 1880, she again bore twins,\r\none living three and the other nine weeks. On March 12, 1881, she gave\r\nbirth to triplets. The first child, a male, weighed 7 pounds; the\r\nsecond, a female, 6 1/4 pounds; the third, a male, 5 1/2 pounds. The\r\nthird child lived twenty days, the other two died of cholera infantum\r\nat the sixth month, attributable to the bottle-feeding. Banerjee gives\r\nthe history of a case of a woman of thirty being delivered of her\r\nfourth pair of twins. Her mother was dead, but she had 3 sisters\r\nliving, of one of which she was a twin, and the other 2 were twins. One\r\nof her sisters had 2 twin terms, 1 child surviving; like her own\r\nchildren, all were females. A second sister had a twin term, both\r\nmales, 1 surviving. The other sister aborted female twins after a fall\r\nin the eighth month of pregnancy. The name of the patient was Mussamat\r\nSomni, and she was the wife of a respectable Indian carpenter.\r\n\r\nThere are recorded the most wonderful accounts of prolificity, in\r\nwhich, by repeated multiple births, a woman is said to have borne\r\nchildren almost beyond belief. A Naples correspondent to a Paris\r\nJournal gives the following: \"About 2 or 3 stations beyond Pompeii, in\r\nthe City of Nocera, lives Maddalena Granata, aged forty-seven, who was\r\nmarried at twenty-eight, and has given birth to 52 living and dead\r\nchildren, 49 being males. Dr. de Sanctis, of Nocera, states that she\r\nhas had triplets 15 times.\"\r\n\r\nPeasant Kirilow was presented to the Empress of Russia in 1853, at the\r\nage of seventy years. He had been twice married, and his first wife had\r\npresented him with 57 children, the fruits of 21 pregnancies. She had\r\nquadruplets four times, triplets seven times, and twins thrice. By his\r\nsecond wife he had 15 children, twins six times, and triplets once.\r\nThis man, accordingly, was the father of 72 children, and, to magnify\r\nthe wonder, all the children were alive at the time of presentation.\r\nHerman, in some Russian statistics, relates the instance of Fedor\r\nVassilet, a peasant of the Moscow Jurisdiction, who in 1872, at the age\r\nof seventy-five years, was the father of 87 children. He had been twice\r\nmarried; his first wife bore him 69 children in 27 accouchements,\r\nhaving twins sixteen times, triplets seven times, and quadruplets four\r\ntimes, but never a single birth. His second wife bore him 18 children\r\nin 8 accouchements. In 1872, 83 of the 87 children were living. The\r\nauthor says this case is beyond all question, as the Imperial Academy\r\nof St. Petersburg, as well as the French Academy, have substantial\r\nproof of it. The family are still living in Russia, and are the object\r\nof governmental favors. The following fact is interesting from the\r\npoint of exaggeration, if for nothing else: \"The New York Medical\r\nJournal is accredited with publishing the following extract from the\r\nhistory of a journey to Saragossa, Barcelona, and Valencia, in the year\r\n1585, by Philip II of Spain. The book was written by Henrique Cock, who\r\naccompanied Philip as his private secretary.  On page 248 the following\r\nstatements are to be found: At the age of eleven years, Margarita\r\nGoncalez, whose father was a Biscayian, and whose mother was French,\r\nwas married to her first husband, who was forty years old. By him she\r\nhad 78 boys and 7 girls. He died thirteen years after the marriage,\r\nand, after having remained a widow two years, the woman married again.\r\nBy her second husband, Thomas Gchoa, she had 66 boys and 7 girls.\r\nThese children were all born in Valencia, between the fifteenth and\r\nthirty-fifth year of the mother's age, and at the time when the account\r\nwas written she was thirty-five years old and pregnant again. Of the\r\nchildren, 47 by the first husband and 52 by the second were baptized;\r\nthe other births were still or premature. There were 33 confinements in\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nExtreme Prolificity by Single Births.--The number of children a woman\r\nmay bring forth is therefore not to be accurately stated; there seems\r\nto be almost no limit to it, and even when we exclude those cases in\r\nwhich remarkable multiplicity at each birth augments the number, there\r\nare still some almost incredible cases on record. The statistics of the\r\nSt. Pancras Royal Dispensary, 1853, estimated the number of children\r\none woman may bear as from 25 to 69. Eisenmenger relates the history of\r\na case of a woman in the last century bearing 51 children, and there is\r\nanother case in which a woman bore 44 children, all boys. Atkinson\r\nspeaks of a lady married at sixteen, dying when she was sixty-four, who\r\nhad borne 39 children, all at single births, by one husband, whom she\r\nsurvived. The children, 32 daughters and 7 sons, all attained their\r\nmajority. There was a case of a woman in America who in twenty-six\r\nyears gave birth to 22 children, all at single births.  Thoresby in his\r\n\"History of Leeds,\" 1715, mentions three remarkable cases--one the wife\r\nof Dr. Phineas Hudson, Chancellor of York, as having died in her\r\nthirty-ninth year of her twenty-fourth child; another of Mrs. Joseph\r\nCooper, as dying of her twenty-sixth child, and, lastly, of Mrs.\r\nWilliam Greenhill, of a village in Hertford, England, who gave birth to\r\n39 children during her life. Brand, a writer of great repute, in his\r\n\"History of Newcastle,\" quoted by Walford, mentions as a well attested\r\nfact the wife of a Scotch weaver who bore 62 children by one husband,\r\nall of whom lived to be baptized.\r\n\r\nA curious epitaph is to be seen at Conway, Carnarvonshire--\r\n\r\n\"Here lieth the body of Nicholas Hookes, of Conway, gentleman, who was\r\none-and-fortieth child of his father, William Hookes, Esq., by Alice,\r\nhis wife, and the father of 27 children. He died 20th of March, 1637.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 21, 1768, Mrs. Shury, the wife of a cooper, in Vine Street,\r\nWestminster, was delivered of 2 boys, making 26 by the same husband.\r\nShe had previously been confined with twins during the year.\r\n\r\nIt would be the task of a mathematician to figure the possibilities of\r\npaternity in a man of extra long life who had married several prolific\r\nwomen during his prolonged period of virility. A man by the name of\r\nPearsons of Lexton, Nottingham, at the time of the report had been\r\nmarried 4 times. By his first 3 wives he had 39 children and by his\r\nlast 14, making a total of 53. He was 6 feet tall and lived to his\r\nninety-sixth year. We have already mentioned the two Russian cases in\r\nwhich the paternity was 72 and 87 children respectively, and in \"Notes\r\nand Queries,\" June 21, 1856, there is an account of David Wilson of\r\nMadison, Ind., who had died a few years previously at the age of one\r\nhundred and seven. He had been 5 times married and was the father of 47\r\nchildren, 35 of whom were living at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nOn a tomb in Ely, Cambridgeshire, there is an inscription saying that\r\nRichard Worster, buried there, died on May 11, 1856, the tomb being in\r\nmemory of his 22 sons and 5 daughters.\r\n\r\nArtaxerxes was supposed to have had 106 children; Conrad, Duke of\r\nMoscow, 80; and in the polygamous countries the number seems\r\nincredible. Herotinus was said to have had 600; and Jonston also quotes\r\ninstances of 225 and even of 650 in the Eastern countries.\r\n\r\nRecently there have been published accounts of the alleged experiments\r\nof Luigi Erba, an Italian gentleman of Perugia, whose results have been\r\nannounced. About forty years of age and being quite wealthy, this\r\nbizarre philanthropist visited various quarters of the world, securing\r\nwomen of different races; having secured a number sufficient for his\r\npurposes, he retired with them to Polynesia, where he is accredited\r\nwith maintaining a unique establishment with his household of females.\r\nIn 1896, just seven years after the experiment commenced, the reports\r\nsay he is the father of 370 children.\r\n\r\nThe following is a report from Raleigh, N.C., on July 28, 1893, to the\r\nNew York Evening Post:--\r\n\r\n\"The fecundity of the negro race has been the subject of much comment\r\nand discussion. A case has come to light in this State that is one of\r\nthe most remarkable on record. Moses Williams, a negro farmer, lives in\r\nthe eastern section of this State. He is sixty-five years old (as\r\nnearly as he can make out), but does not appear to be over fifty. He\r\nhas been married twice, and by the two wives has had born to him 45\r\nchildren. By the first wife he had 23 children, 20 of whom were girls\r\nand 3 were boys. By the second wife he had 22 children--20 girls and 2\r\nboys. He also has about 50 grand-children. The case is well\r\nauthenticated.\"\r\n\r\nWe also quote the following, accredited to the \"Annals of Hygiene:\"--\r\n\r\n\"Were it not part of the records of the Berks County courts, we could\r\nhardly credit the history of John Heffner, who was accidentally killed\r\nsome years ago at the age of sixty-nine. He was married first in 1840.\r\nIn eight years his wife bore him 17 children. The first and second\r\nyears of their marriage she gave birth to twins. For four successive\r\nyears afterward she gave birth to triplets. In the seventh year she\r\ngave birth to one child and died soon afterward. Heffner engaged a\r\nyoung woman to look after his large brood of babies, and three months\r\nlater she became the second Mrs. Heffner. She presented her husband\r\nwith 2 children in the first two years of her wedded life. Five years\r\nlater she had added 10 more to the family, having twins 5 times.  Then\r\nfor three years she added but 1 a year. At the time of the death of the\r\nsecond wife 12 of the 32 children had died. The 20 that were left did\r\nnot appear to be any obstacle to a young widow with one child\r\nconsenting to become the third wife of the jolly little man, for he was\r\nknown as one of the happiest and most genial of men, although it kept\r\nhim toiling like a slave to keep a score of mouths in bread. The third\r\nMrs. Heffner became the mother of 9 children in ten years, and the\r\ncontentment and happiness of the couple were proverbial. One day, in\r\nthe fall of 1885, the father of the 41 children was crossing a railroad\r\ntrack and was run down by a locomotive and instantly killed. His widow\r\nand 24 of the 42 children are still living.\"\r\n\r\nMany Marriages.--In this connection it seems appropriate to mention a\r\nfew examples of multimarriages on record, to give an idea of the\r\npossibilities of the extent of paternity. St. Jerome mentions a widow\r\nwho married her twenty-second husband, who in his time had taken to\r\nhimself 20 loving spouses. A gentleman living in Bordeaux in 1772 had\r\nbeen married 16 times.  DeLongueville, a Frenchman, lived to be one\r\nhundred and ten years old, and had been joined in matrimony to 10\r\nwives, his last wife bearing him a son in his one hundred and first\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nPossible Descendants.--When we indulge ourselves as to the possible\r\nnumber of living descendants one person may have, we soon get\r\nextraordinary figures. The Madrid Estafette states that a gentleman,\r\nSenor Lucas Nequeiras Saez, who emigrated to America seventy years\r\npreviously, recently returned to Spain in his own steamer, and brought\r\nwith him his whole family, consisting of 197 persons. He had been\r\nthrice married, and by his first wife had 11 children at 7 births; by\r\nhis second wife, 19 at 13 births, and by his third wife, 7 at 6 births.\r\nThe youngest of the 37 was thirteen years old and the eldest seventy.\r\nThis latter one had a son aged forty-seven and 16 children besides. He\r\nhad 34 granddaughters, 45 grandsons, 45 great granddaughters, 39 great\r\ngrandsons, all living. Senor Saez himself was ninety-three years old\r\nand in excellent health.\r\n\r\nAt Litchfield, Conn., there is said to be the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n\"Here lies the body of Mrs. Mary, wife of Dr. John Bull, Esq. She died\r\nNovember 4, 1778, aetat. ninety, having had 13 children, 101\r\ngrandchildren, 274 great grandchildren, and 22 great-great\r\ngrandchildren, a total of 410; surviving, 336.\"\r\n\r\nIn Esher Church there is an inscription, scarcely legible, which\r\nrecords the death of the mother of Mrs. Mary Morton on April 18, 1634,\r\nand saying that she was the wonder of her sex and age, for she lived to\r\nsee nearly 400 issued from her loins.\r\n\r\nThe following is a communication to \"Notes and Queries,\" March 21,\r\n1891: \"Mrs. Mary Honeywood was daughter and one of the coheiresses of\r\nRobert Waters, Esq., of Lenham, in Kent. She was born in 1527; married\r\nin February, 1543, at sixteen years of age, to her only husband, Robert\r\nHoneywood, Esq., of Charing, in Kent.  She died in the ninety-third\r\nyear of her age, in May, 1620. She had 16 children of her own body, 7\r\nsons and 9 daughters, of whom one had no issue, 3 died young--the\r\nyoungest was slain at Newport battle, June 20, 1600. Her grandchildren,\r\nin the second generation, were 114; in the third, 228, and in the\r\nfourth, 9; so that she could almost say the same as the distich doth of\r\none of the Dalburg family of Basil: 'Rise up, daughter and go to thy\r\ndaughter, for thy daughter's daughter hath a daughter.'\r\n\r\n\"In Markshal Church, in Essex, on Mrs. Honeywood's tomb is the\r\nfollowing inscription: 'Here lieth the body of Mary Waters, the\r\ndaughter and coheir of Robert Waters, of Lenham, in Kent, wife of\r\nRobert Honeywood, of Charing, in Kent, her only husband, who had at her\r\ndecease, lawfully descended from her, 367 children, 16 of her own body,\r\n114 grandchildren, 228 in the third generation, and 9 in the fourth.\r\nShe lived a most pious life and died at Markshal, in the ninety-third\r\nyear of her age and the forty-fourth of her widowhood, May 11, 1620.'\r\n(From 'Curiosities for the Ingenious,' 1826.)            S. S. R.\"\r\n\r\nAnimal prolificity though not finding a place in this work, presents\r\nsome wonderful anomalies.\r\n\r\nIn illustration we may note the following: In the Illustrated London\r\nNews, May 11, 1895, is a portrait of \"Lady Millard,\" a fine St. Bernard\r\nbitch, the property of Mr. Thorp of Northwold, with her litter of 21\r\npuppies, born on February 9, 1896, their sire being a magnificent\r\ndog--\"Young York.\" There is quoted an incredible account of a cow, the\r\nproperty of J. N. Sawyer of Ohio, which gave birth to 56 calves, one of\r\nwhich was fully matured and lived, the others being about the size of\r\nkittens; these died, together with the mother. There was a cow in\r\nFrance, in 1871, delivered of 5 calves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMAJOR TERATA.\r\n\r\nMonstrosities have attracted notice from the earliest time, and many of\r\nthe ancient philosophers made references to them. In mythology we read\r\nof Centaurs, impossible beings who had the body and extremities of a\r\nbeast; the Cyclops, possessed of one enormous eye; or their parallels\r\nin Egyptian myths, the men with pectoral eyes,--the creatures \"whose\r\nheads do beneath their shoulders grow;\" and the Fauns, those sylvan\r\ndeities whose lower extremities bore resemblance to those of a goat.\r\nMonsters possessed of two or more heads or double bodies are found in\r\nthe legends and fairy tales of every nation. Hippocrates, his\r\nprecursors, Empedocles and Democritus, and Pliny, Aristotle, and Galen,\r\nhave all described monsters, although in extravagant and ridiculous\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nBallantyne remarks that the occasional occurrence of double monsters\r\nwas a fact known to the Hippocratic school, and is indicated by a\r\npassage in De morbis muliebribus, in which it is said that labor is\r\ngravely interfered with when the infant is dead or apoplectic or\r\ndouble. There is also a reference to monochorionic twins (which are by\r\nmodern teratologists regarded as monstrosities) in the treatise De\r\nSuperfoetatione, in which it is stated that \"a woman, pregnant with\r\ntwins, gives birth to them both at the same time, just as she has\r\nconceived them; the two infants are in a single chorion.\"\r\n\r\nAncient Explanations of Monstrosities.--From the time of Galen to the\r\nsixteenth century many incredible reports of monsters are seen in\r\nmedical literature, but without a semblance of scientific truth. There\r\nhas been little improvement in the mode of explanation of monstrous\r\nbirths until the present century, while in the Middle Ages the\r\nsuperstitions were more ludicrous and observers more ignorant than\r\nbefore the time of Galen. In his able article on the teratologic\r\nrecords of Chaldea, Ballantyne makes the following trite statements:\r\n\"Credulity and superstition have never been the peculiar possession of\r\nthe lower types of civilization only, and the special beliefs that have\r\ngathered round the occurrence of teratologic phenomena have been common\r\nto the cultured Greek and Roman of the past, the ignorant peasant of\r\nmodern times, and the savage tribes of all ages. Classical writings,\r\nthe literature of the Middle Ages, and the popular beliefs of the\r\npresent day all contain views concerning teratologic subjects which so\r\nclosely resemble those of the Chaldean magi as to be indistinguishable\r\nfrom them. Indeed, such works as those of Obsequens, Lycosthenes,\r\nLicetus, and Ambroise Pare only repeat, but with less accuracy of\r\ndescription and with greater freedom of imagination, the beliefs of\r\nancient Babylon.  Even at the present time the most impossible cases of\r\nso-called 'maternal impressions' are widely scattered through medical\r\nliterature; and it is not very long since I received a letter from a\r\ndistinguished member of the profession asking me whether, in my\r\nopinion, I thought it possible for a woman to give birth to a dog. Of\r\ncourse, I do not at all mean to infer that teratology has not made\r\nimmense advances within recent times, nor do I suggest that on such\r\nsubjects the knowledge of the magi can be compared with that of the\r\naverage medical student of the present; but what I wish to emphasize is\r\nthat, in the literature of ancient Babylonia, there are indications of\r\nan acquaintance with structural defects and malformations of the human\r\nbody which will compare favorably with even the writings of the\r\nsixteenth century of the Christian era.\"\r\n\r\nMany reasons were given for the existence of monsters, and in the\r\nMiddle Ages these were as faulty as the descriptions themselves.  They\r\nwere interpreted as divinations, and were cited as forebodings and\r\nexamples of wrath, or even as glorifications of the Almighty. The\r\nsemi-human creatures were invented or imagined, and cited as the\r\nresults of bestiality and allied forms of sexual perversion prevalent\r\nin those times. We find minute descriptions and portraits of these\r\nimpossible results of wicked practices in many of the older medical\r\nbooks. According to Pare there was born in 1493, as the result of\r\nillicit intercourse between a woman and a dog, a creature resembling in\r\nits upper extremities its mother, while its lower extremities were the\r\nexact counterpart of its canine father. This particular case was\r\nbelieved by Bateman and others to be a precursor to the murders and\r\nwickedness that followed in the time of Pope Alexander I. Volateranus,\r\nCardani, and many others cite instances of this kind. Lycosthenes says\r\nthat in the year 1110, in the bourg of Liege, there was found a\r\ncreature with the head, visage, hands, and feet of a man, and the rest\r\nof the body like that of a pig. Pare quotes this case and gives an\r\nillustration. Rhodiginus mentions a shepherd of Cybare by the name of\r\nCratain, who had connection with a female goat and impregnated her, so\r\nthat she brought forth a beast with a head resembling that of the\r\nfather, but with the lower extremities of a goat. He says that the\r\nlikeness to the father was so marked that the head-goat of the herd\r\nrecognized it, and accordingly slew the goatherd who had sinned so\r\nunnaturally.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1547, at Cracovia, a very strange monster was born, which\r\nlived three days. It had a head shaped like that of a man; a nose long\r\nand hooked like an elephant's trunk; the hands and feet looking like\r\nthe web-foot of a goose; and a tail with a hook on it. It was supposed\r\nto be a male, and was looked upon as a result of sodomy. Rueff says\r\nthat the procreation of human beings and beasts is brought about--\r\n\r\n(1) By the natural appetite;\r\n\r\n(2) By the provocation of nature by delight;\r\n\r\n(3) By the attractive virtue of the matrix, which in beasts and women\r\nis alike.\r\n\r\nPlutarch, in his \"Lesser Parallels,\" says that Aristonymus Ephesius,\r\nson of Demonstratus, being tired of women, had carnal knowledge with an\r\nass, which in the process of time brought forth a very beautiful child,\r\nwho became the maid Onoscelin. He also speaks of the origin of the\r\nmaiden Hippona, or as he calls her, Hippo, as being from the connection\r\nof a man with a mare.  Aristotle mentions this in his paradoxes, and we\r\nknow that the patron of horses was Hippona. In Helvetia was reported\r\nthe existence of a colt (whose mother had been covered by a bull) that\r\nwas half horse and half bull. One of the kings of France was supposed\r\nto have been presented with a colt with the hinder part of a hart, and\r\nwhich could outrun any horse in the kingdom. Its mother had been\r\ncovered by a hart.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1557, Lycosthenes reports the mythical birth of a serpent by\r\na woman. It is quite possible that some known and classified type of\r\nmonstrosity was indicated here in vague terms.  In 1726 Mary Toft, of\r\nGodalming, in Surrey, England, achieved considerable notoriety\r\nthroughout Surrey, and even over all England, by her extensively\r\ncirculated statements that she bore rabbits. Even at so late a day as\r\nthis the credulity of the people was so great that many persons\r\nbelieved in her. The woman was closely watched, and being detected in\r\nher maneuvers confessed her fraud. To show the extent of discussion\r\nthis case called forth, there are no less than nine pamphlets and books\r\nin the Surgeon-General's library at Washington devoted exclusively to\r\nthis case of pretended rabbit-breeding. Hamilton in 1848, and Hard in\r\n1884, both report the births in this country of fetal monstrosities\r\nwith heads which showed marked resemblance to those of dogs. Doubtless\r\nmany of the older cases of the supposed results of bestiality, if seen\r\nto-day, could be readily classified among some of our known forms of\r\nmonsters. Modern investigation has shown us the sterile results of the\r\nconnections between man and beast or between beasts of different\r\nspecies, and we can only wonder at the simple credulity and the\r\nimaginative minds of our ancestors. At one period certain phenomena of\r\nnature, such as an eclipse or comet, were thought to exercise their\r\ninfluence on monstrous births. Rueff mentions that in Sicily there\r\nhappened a great eclipse of the sun, and that women immediately began\r\nto bring forth deformed and double-headed children.\r\n\r\nBefore ending these preliminary remarks, there might be mentioned the\r\nmarine monsters, such as mermaids, sea-serpents, and the like, which\r\nfrom time to time have been reported; even at the present day there are\r\npeople who devoutly believe that they have seen horrible and impossible\r\ndemons in the sea. Pare describes and pictures a monster, at Rome, on\r\nNovember 3, 1520, with the upper portion of a child apparently about\r\nfive or six years old, and the lower part and ears of a fish-like\r\nanimal. He also pictures a sea-devil in the same chapter, together with\r\nother gruesome examples of the power of imagination.\r\n\r\nEarly Teratology.--Besides such cases as the foregoing, we find the\r\nmedieval writers report likely instances of terata, as, for instance,\r\nRhodiginus, who speaks of a monster in Italy with two heads and two\r\nbodies; Lycosthenes saw a double monster, both components of which\r\nslept at the same time; he also says this creature took its food and\r\ndrink simultaneously in its two mouths. Even Saint Augustine says that\r\nhe knew of a child born in the Orient who, from the belly up, was in\r\nall parts double.\r\n\r\nThe first evidences of a step toward classification and definite\r\nreasoning in regard to the causation of monstrosities were evinced by\r\nAmbroise Pare in the sixteenth century, and though his ideas are crude\r\nand some of his phenomena impossible, yet many of his facts and\r\narguments are worthy of consideration. Pare attributed the cause of\r\nanomalies of excess to an excessive quantity of semen, and anomalies of\r\ndefault to deficiency of the same fluid. He has collected many\r\ninstances of double terata from reliable sources, but has interspersed\r\nhis collection with accounts of some hideous and impossible creatures,\r\nsuch as are illustrated in the accompanying figure, which shows a\r\ncreature that was born shortly after a battle of Louis XII, in 1512; it\r\nhad the wings, crest, and lower extremity of a bird and a human head\r\nand trunk; besides, it was an hermaphrodite, and had an extra eye in\r\nthe knee. Another illustration represents a monstrous head found in an\r\negg, said to have been sent for examination to King Charles at Metz in\r\n1569. It represented the face and visage of a man, with small living\r\nserpents taking the place of beard and hair. So credulous were people\r\nat this time that even a man so well informed as Pare believed in the\r\npossibility of these last two, or at least represented them as facts.\r\nAt this time were also reported double hermaphroditic terata, seemingly\r\nwithout latter-day analogues. Rhodiginus speaks of a two-headed monster\r\nborn in Ferrari, Italy, in 1540, well formed, and with two sets of\r\ngenitals, one male and the other female. Pare gives a picture of twins,\r\nborn near Heidelberg in 1486, which had double bodies joined back to\r\nback; one of the twins had the aspect of a female and the other of a\r\nmale, though both had two sets of genitals.\r\n\r\nScientific Teratology.--About the first half of the eighteenth century\r\nwhat might be called the positive period of teratology begins.\r\nFollowing the advent of this era come Mery, Duverney, Winslow, Lemery,\r\nand Littre. In their works true and concise descriptions are given and\r\nviolent attacks are made against the ancient beliefs and prejudices.\r\nFrom the beginning of the second half of the last century to the\r\npresent time may be termed the scientific epoch of teratology. We can\r\nalmost with a certainty start this era with the names of Haller,\r\nMorgagni, Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, and Meckel, who adduced the\r\nexplanations asked for by Harvey and Wolff. From the appearance of the\r\ntreatise by Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, teratology has made enormous\r\nstrides, and is to-day well on the road to becoming a science.  Hand in\r\nhand with embryology it has been the subject of much investigation in\r\nthis century, and to enumerate the workers of the present day who have\r\nhelped to bring about scientific progress would be a task of many\r\npages. Even in the artificial production of monsters much has been\r\ndone, and a glance at the work of Dareste well repays the trouble.\r\nEssays on teratogenesis, with reference to batrachians, have been\r\noffered by Lombardini; and by Lereboullet and Knoch with reference to\r\nfishes. Foll and Warynski have reported their success in obtaining\r\nvisceral inversion, and even this branch of the subject promises to\r\nbecome scientific.\r\n\r\nTerata are seen in the lower animals and always excite interest.  Pare\r\ngives the history of a sheep with three heads, born in 1577; the\r\ncentral head was larger than the other two, as shown in the\r\naccompanying illustration. Many of the Museums of Natural History\r\ncontain evidences of animal terata. At Hallae is a two-headed mouse;\r\nthe Conant Museum in Maine contains the skeleton of an adult sheep with\r\ntwo heads; there was an account of a two-headed pigeon published in\r\nFrance in 1734; Leidy found a two-headed snake in a field near\r\nPhiladelphia; Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Conant both found similar\r\ncreatures, and there is one in the Museum at Harvard; Wyman saw a\r\nliving double-headed snake in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris in 1853,\r\nand many parallel instances are on record.\r\n\r\nClassification.--We shall attempt no scientific discussion of the\r\ncausation or embryologic derivation of the monster, contenting\r\nourselves with simple history and description, adding any associate\r\nfacts of interest that may be suggested. For further information, the\r\nreader is referred to the authors cited or to any of the standard\r\ntreatises on teratology.\r\n\r\nMany classifications of terata have been offered, and each possesses\r\nsome advantage. The modern reader is referred to the modification of\r\nthe grouping of Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire given by Hirst and Piersol, or\r\nthose of Blanc and Guinard. For convenience, we have adopted the\r\nfollowing classification, which will include only those monsters that\r\nhave LIVED AFTER BIRTH, and who have attracted general notice or\r\nattained some fame in their time, as attested by accounts in\r\ncontemporary literature.\r\n\r\nCLASS 1.--Union of several fetuses.  CLASS 2.--Union of two distinct\r\nfetuses by a connecting band.  CLASS 3.--Union of two distinct fetuses\r\nby an osseous junction of the cranial bones.  CLASS 4.--Union of two\r\ndistinct fetuses in which one or more parts are eliminated by the\r\njunction.  CLASS 5.--Fusion of two fetuses by a bony union of the\r\nischii. CLASS 6.--Fusion of two fetuses below the umbilicus into a\r\ncommon lower extremity.  CLASS 7.--Bicephalic monsters.  CLASS\r\n8.--Parasitic monsters.  CLASS 9.--Monsters with a single body and\r\ndouble lower extremities.  CLASS 10.--Diphallic terata. CLASS\r\n11.--Fetus in fetu, and dermoid cysts.  CLASS 12.--Hermaphrodites.\r\n\r\nCLASS I.--Triple Monsters.--Haller and Meckel were of the opinion that\r\nno cases of triple monsters worthy of credence are on record, and since\r\ntheir time this has been the popular opinion.  Surely none have ever\r\nlived. Licetus describes a human monster with two feet and seven heads\r\nand as many arms. Bartholinus speaks of a three-headed monster who\r\nafter birth gave vent to horrible cries and expired. Borellus speaks of\r\na three-headed dog, a veritable Cerberus. Blasius published an essay on\r\ntriple monsters in 1677. Bordenave is quoted as mentioning a human\r\nmonster formed of three fetuses, but his description proves clearly\r\nthat it was only the union of two. Probably the best example of this\r\nanomaly that we have was described by Galvagni at Cattania in 1834.\r\nThis monster had two necks, on one of which was a single head normal in\r\ndimensions. On the other neck were two heads, as seen in the\r\naccompanying illustration.  Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire mentions several\r\ncases, and Martin de Pedro publishes a description of a case in Madrid\r\nin 1879. There are also on record some cases of triple monster by\r\ninclusion which will be spoken of later. Instances in the lower animals\r\nhave been seen, the three-headed sheep of Pare, already spoken of,\r\nbeing one.\r\n\r\nCLASS II.--Double Monsters.--A curious mode of junction, probably the\r\nmost interesting, as it admits of longer life in these monstrosities,\r\nis that of a simple cartilaginous band extending between two absolutely\r\ndistinct and different individuals. The band is generally in the\r\nsternal region. In 1752 there was described a remarkable monstrosity\r\nwhich consisted of conjoined twins, a perfect and an imperfect child,\r\nconnected at their ensiform cartilages by a band 4 inches in\r\ncircumference. The Hindoo sisters, described by Dr. Andrew Berry, lived\r\nto be seven years old; they stood face to face, with their chests 6 1/2\r\ninches and their pubes 8 1/2 inches apart. Mitchell describes the\r\nfull-grown female twins, born at Newport, Ky., called the Newport\r\ntwins. The woman who gave birth to them became impregnated, it is said,\r\nimmediately after seeing the famous Siamese twins, and the products of\r\nthis pregnancy took the conformation of those celebrated exhibitionists.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best known of all double monsters were the Siamese twins.\r\nThey were exhibited all over the globe and had the additional benefit\r\nand advertisement of a much mooted discussion as to the advisability of\r\ntheir severance, in which opinions of the leading medical men of all\r\nnations were advanced. The literature on these famous brothers is\r\nsimply stupendous. The amount of material in the Surgeon General's\r\nlibrary at Washington would surprise an investigator. A curious volume\r\nin this library is a book containing clippings, advertisements, and\r\ndivers portraits of the twins. It will be impossible to speak at all\r\nfully on this subject, but a short history and running review of their\r\nlives will be given: Eng and Chang were born in Siam about May, 1811.\r\nTheir father was of Chinese extraction and had gone to Siam and there\r\nmarried a woman whose father was also a Chinaman.  Hence, for the most\r\npart, they were of Chinese blood, which probably accounted for their\r\ndark color and Chinese features.  Their mother was about thirty-five\r\nyears old at the time of their birth and had borne 4 female children\r\nprior to Chang and Eng. She afterward had twins several times, having\r\neventually 14 children in all. She gave no history of special\r\nsignificance of the pregnancy, although she averred that the head of\r\none and the feet of the other were born at the same time. The twins\r\nwere both feeble at birth, and Eng continued delicate, while Chang\r\nthrived.  It was only with difficulty that their lives were saved, as\r\nChowpahyi, the reigning king, had a superstition that such freaks of\r\nnature always presaged evil to the country. They were really discovered\r\nby Robert Hunter, a British merchant at Bangkok, who in 1824 saw them\r\nboating and stripped to the waist. He prevailed on the parents and King\r\nChowpahyi to allow them to go away for exhibition. They were first\r\ntaken out of the country by a certain Captain Coffin. The first\r\nscientific description of them was given by Professor J. C. Warren, who\r\nexamined them in Boston, at the Harvard University, in 1829. At that\r\ntime Eng was 5 feet 2 inches and Chang 5 feet 1 1/2 inches in height.\r\nThey presented all the characteristics of Chinamen and wore long black\r\nqueues coiled thrice around their heads, as shown by the accompanying\r\nillustration. After an eight-weeks' tour over the Eastern States they\r\nwent to London, arriving at that port November 20, 1829.  Their tour in\r\nFrance was forbidden on the same grounds as the objection to the\r\nexhibition of Ritta-Christina, namely, the possibility of causing the\r\nproduction of monsters by maternal impressions in pregnant women. After\r\ntheir European tour they returned to the United States and settled down\r\nas farmers in North Carolina, adopting the name of Bunker. When\r\nforty-four years of age they married two sisters, English women,\r\ntwenty-six and twenty-eight years of age, respectively. Domestic\r\ninfelicity soon compelled them to keep the wives at different houses,\r\nand they alternated weeks in visiting each wife. Chang had six children\r\nand Eng five, all healthy and strong. In 1869 they made another trip to\r\nEurope, ostensibly to consult the most celebrated surgeons of Great\r\nBritain and France on the advisability of being separated. It was\r\nstated that a feeling of antagonistic hatred after a quarrel prompted\r\nthem to seek \"surgical separation,\" but the real cause was most likely\r\nto replenish their depleted exchequer by renewed exhibition and\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\nA most pathetic characteristic of these illustrious brothers was the\r\naffection and forbearance they showed for each other until shortly\r\nbefore their death. They bore each other's trials and petty maladies\r\nwith the greatest sympathy, and in this manner rendered their lives far\r\nmore agreeable than a casual observer would suppose possible. They both\r\nbecame Christians and members or attendants of the Baptist Church.\r\n\r\nFigure 31 is a representation of the Siamese twins in old age. On each\r\nside of them is a son. The original photograph is in the Mutter Museum,\r\nCollege of Physicians, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of the operation of separating them was discussed by\r\nmany of the leading men of America, and Thompson, Fergusson, Syme, Sir\r\nJ. Y. Simpson, Nelaton, and many others in Europe, with various reports\r\nand opinions after examination. These opinions can be seen in full in\r\nnearly any large medical library. At this time they had diseased and\r\natheromatous arteries, and Chang, who was quite intemperate, had marked\r\nspinal curvature, and shortly afterward became hemiplegic. They were\r\nboth partially blind in their two anterior eyes, possibly from looking\r\noutward and obliquely. The point of junction was about the\r\nsterno-siphoid angle, a cartilaginous band extending from sternum to\r\nsternum. In 1869 Simpson measured this band and made the distance on\r\nthe superior aspect from sternum to sternum 4 1/2 inches, though it is\r\nmost likely that during the early period of exhibition it was not over\r\n3 inches. The illustration shows very well the position of the joining\r\nband.\r\n\r\nThe twins died on January 17, 1874, and a committee of surgeons from\r\nthe College of Physicians of Philadelphia, consisting of Doctors\r\nAndrews, Allen, and Pancoast, went to North Carolina to perform an\r\nautopsy on the body, and, if possible, to secure it.  They made a long\r\nand most interesting report on the results of their trip to the\r\nCollege. The arteries, as was anticipated, were found to have undergone\r\ncalcareous degeneration. There was an hepatic connection through the\r\nband, and also some interlacing diaphragmatic fibers therein. There was\r\nslight vascular intercommunication of the livers and independence of\r\nthe two peritoneal cavities and the intestines. The band itself was\r\nchiefly a coalescence of the xyphoid cartilages, surrounded by areolar\r\ntissue and skin.\r\n\r\nThe \"Orissa sisters,\" or Radica-Doddica, shown in Europe in 1893, were\r\nsimilar to the Siamese twins in conformation. They were born in Orissa,\r\nIndia, September, 1889, and were the result of the sixth pregnancy, the\r\nother five being normal. They were healthy girls, four years of age,\r\nand apparently perfect in every respect, except that, from the ensiform\r\ncartilage to the umbilicus, they were united by a band 4 inches long\r\nand 2 inches wide. The children when facing each other could draw their\r\nchests three or four inches apart, and the band was so flexible that\r\nthey could sit on either side of the body. Up to the date mentioned it\r\nwas not known whether the connecting band contained viscera. A portrait\r\nof these twins was shown at the World's Fair in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Arasoor, district of Bhavany, there was reported a\r\nmonstrosity in the form of two female children, one 34 inches and the\r\nother 33 3/4 inches high, connected by the sternum. They were said to\r\nhave had small-pox and to have recovered. They seemed to have had\r\nindividual nervous systems, as when one was pinched the other did not\r\nfeel it, and while one slept the other was awake. There must have been\r\nsome vascular connection, as medicine given to one affected both.\r\n\r\nFig. 36 shows a mode of cartilaginous junction by which each component\r\nof a double monster may be virtually independent.\r\n\r\nOperations on Conjoined Twins.--Swingler speaks of two girls joined at\r\nthe xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus, the band of union being 1 1/2\r\ninches thick, and running below the middle of it was the umbilical\r\ncord, common to both. They first ligated the cord, which fell off in\r\nnine days, and then separated the twins with the bistoury. They each\r\nmade early recovery and lived.\r\n\r\nIn the Ephemerides of 1690 Konig gives a description of two Swiss\r\nsisters born in 1689 and united belly to belly, who were separated by\r\nmeans of a ligature and the operation afterward completed by an\r\ninstrument. The constricting band was formed by a coalition of the\r\nxiphoid cartilages and the umbilical vessels, surrounded by areolar\r\ntissue and covered with skin. Le Beau says that under the Roman reign,\r\nA. D. 945, two male children were brought from Armenia to\r\nConstantinople for exhibition. They were well formed in every respect\r\nand united by their abdomens. After they had been for some time an\r\nobject of great curiosity, they were removed by governmental order,\r\nbeing considered a presage of evil. They returned, however, at the\r\ncommencement of the reign of Constantine VII, when one of them took\r\nsick and died. The surgeons undertook to preserve the other by\r\nseparating him from the corpse of his brother, but he died on the third\r\nday after the operation.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Boehm gives an account of Guzenhausen's case of twins who were\r\nunited sternum to sternum. An operation for separation was performed\r\nwithout accident, but one of the children, already very feeble, died\r\nthree days after; the other survived. The last attempt at an operation\r\nlike this was in 1881, when Biaudet and Buginon attempted to separate\r\nconjoined sisters (Marie-Adele) born in Switzerland on June 26th.\r\nUnhappily, they were very feeble and life was despaired of when the\r\noperation was performed, on October 29th. Adele died six hours\r\nafterward, and Marie died of peritonitis on the next day.\r\n\r\nCLASS III.--Those monsters joined by a fusion of some of the cranial\r\nbones are sometimes called craniopagi. A very ancient observation of\r\nthis kind is cited by Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire.  These two girls were\r\nborn in 1495, and lived to be ten years old.  They were normal in every\r\nrespect, except that they were joined at the forehead, causing them to\r\nstand face to face and belly to belly. When one walked forward, the\r\nother was compelled to walk backward; their noses almost touched, and\r\ntheir eyes were directed laterally. At the death of one an attempt to\r\nseparate the other from the cadaver was made, but it was unsuccessful,\r\nthe second soon dying; the operation necessitated opening the cranium\r\nand parting the meninges. Bateman said that in 1501 there was living an\r\ninstance of double female twins, joined at the forehead. This case was\r\nsaid to have been caused in the following manner: Two women, one of\r\nwhom was pregnant with the twins at the time, were engaged in an\r\nearnest conversation, when a third, coming up behind them, knocked\r\ntheir heads together with a sharp blow. Bateman describes the death of\r\none of the twins and its excision from the other, who died\r\nsubsequently, evidently of septic infection. There is a possibility\r\nthat this is merely a duplication of the account of the preceding case\r\nwith a slight anachronism as to the time of death.\r\n\r\nAt a foundling hospital in St. Petersburg there were born two living\r\ngirls, in good health, joined by the heads. They were so united that\r\nthe nose of one, if prolonged, would strike the ear of the other; they\r\nhad perfectly independent existences, but their vascular systems had\r\nevident connection.\r\n\r\nThrough extra mobility of their necks they could really lie in a\r\nstraight line, one sleeping on the side and the other on the back.\r\nThere is a report a of two girls joined at their vertices, who survived\r\ntheir birth. With the exception of this junction they were well formed\r\nand independent in existence. There was no communication of the cranial\r\ncavities, but simply fusion of the cranial bones covered by superficial\r\nfascia and skin. Daubenton has seen a case of union at the occiput, but\r\nfurther details are not quoted.\r\n\r\nCLASS IV.--The next class to be considered is that in which the\r\nindividuals are separate and well formed, except that the point of\r\nfusion is a common part, eliminating their individual components in\r\nthis location. The pygopagous twins belong in this section. According\r\nto Bateman, twins were born in 1493 at Rome joined back to back, and\r\nsurvived their birth. The same authority speaks of a female child who\r\nwas born with \"2 bellies, 4 arms, 4 legs, 2 heads, and 2 sets of\r\nprivates, and was exhibited throughout Italy for gain's sake.\" The\r\n\"Biddenden Maids\" were born in Biddenden, Kent, in 1100. Their names\r\nwere Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, and their parents were fairly\r\nwell-to-do people. They were supposed to have been united at the hips\r\nand the shoulders, and lived until 1134. At the death of one it was\r\nproposed to separate them, but the remaining sister refused, saying,\r\n\"As we came together, we will also go together,\" and, after about six\r\nhours of this Mezentian existence, they died. They bequeathed to the\r\nchurch-wardens of the parish and their successors land to the extent of\r\n20 acres, at the present time bringing a rental of about $155.00\r\nannually, with the instructions that the money was to be spent in the\r\ndistribution of cakes (bearing the impression of their images, to be\r\ngiven away on each Easter Sunday to all strangers in Biddenden) and\r\nalso 270 quartern loaves, with cheese in proportion, to all the poor in\r\nsaid parish. Ballantyne has accompanied his description of these\r\nsisters by illustrations, one of which shows the cake. Heaton gives a\r\nvery good description of these maids; and a writer in \"Notes and\r\nQueries\" of March 27, 1875, gives the following information relative to\r\nthe bequest:--\r\n\r\n\"On Easter Monday, at Biddenden, near Staplehurst, Kent, there is a\r\ndistribution, according to ancient custom, of 'Biddenden Maids' cakes,'\r\nwith bread and cheese, the cost of which is defrayed from the proceeds\r\nof some 20 acres of land, now yielding L35 per annum. and known as the\r\n'Bread and Cheese Lands.' About the year 1100 there lived Eliza and\r\nMary Chulkhurst, who were joined together after the manner of the\r\nSiamese twins, and who lived for thirty-four years, one dying, and then\r\nbeing followed by her sister within six hours. They left by their will\r\nthe lands above alluded to and their memory is perpetuated by\r\nimprinting on the cakes their effigies 'in their habit as they lived.'\r\nThe cakes, which are simple flour and water, are four inches long by\r\ntwo inches wide, and are much sought after as curiosities. These, which\r\nare given away, are distributed at the discretion of the\r\nchurch-wardens, and are nearly 300 in number. The bread and cheese\r\namounts to 540 quartern loaves and 470 pounds of cheese.  The\r\ndistribution is made on land belonging to the charity, known as the Old\r\nPoorhouse. Formerly it used to take place in the Church, immediately\r\nafter the service in the afternoon, but in consequence of the unseemly\r\ndisturbance which used to ensue the practice was discontinued. The\r\nChurch used to be filled with a congregation whose conduct was\r\noccasionally so reprehensible that sometimes the church-wardens had to\r\nuse their wands for other purposes than symbols of office. The\r\nimpressions of the maids 'on the cakes are of a primitive character,\r\nand are made by boxwood dies cut in 1814. They bear the date 1100, when\r\nEliza and Mary Chulkhurst are supposed to have been born, and also\r\ntheir age at death, thirty-four years.\"\r\n\r\nBallantyne has summed up about all there is to be said on this national\r\nmonstrosity, and his discussion of the case from its historic as well\r\nas teratologic standpoint is so excellent that his conclusions will be\r\nquoted--\r\n\r\n\"It may be urged that the date fixed for the birth of the Biddenden\r\nMaids is so remote as to throw grave doubt upon the reality of the\r\noccurrence. The year 1100 was, it will be remembered, that in which\r\nWilliam Rufus was found dead in the New Forest, 'with the arrow either\r\nof a hunter or an assassin in his breast.' According to the Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle, several 'prodigies' preceded the death of this profligate\r\nand extravagant monarch. Thus it is recorded that 'at Pentecost blood\r\nwas observed gushing from the earth at a certain town of Berkshire,\r\neven as many asserted who declared that they had seen it. And after\r\nthis, on the morning after Lammas Day, King William was shot.' Now, it\r\nis just possible that the birth of the Biddenden Maids may have\r\noccurred later, but have been antedated by the popular tradition to the\r\nyear above mentioned. For such a birth would, in the opinion of the\r\ntimes, be regarded undoubtedly as a most evident prodigy or omen of\r\nevil. Still, even admitting that the date 1100 must be allowed to\r\nstand, its remoteness from the present time is not a convincing\r\nargument against a belief in the real occurrence of the phenomenon; for\r\nof the dicephalic Scottish brothers, who lived in 1490, we have\r\ncredible historic evidence.  Further, Lycosthenes, in his \"Chronicon\r\nProdigiorum atque Ostentorum\", published in 1557, states, upon what\r\nauthority I know not, that in the year 1112 joined twins resembling the\r\nBiddenden phenomenon in all points save in sex were born in England.\r\nThe passage is as follows: 'In Anglia natus est puer geminus a clune ad\r\nsuperiores partes ita divisus, ut duo haberet capita, duo corpora\r\nintegra ad renes cum suis brachiis, qui baptizatus triduo supervixit.'\r\nIt is just possible that in some way or other this case has been\r\nconfounded with the story of Biddenden; at any rate, the occurrence of\r\nsuch a statement in Lycosthenes' work is of more than passing interest.\r\nHad there been no bequest of land in connection with the case of the\r\nKentish Maids, the whole affair would probably soon have been forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"There is, however, one real difficulty in accepting the story handed\r\ndown to us as authentic,--the nature of the teratologic phenomenon\r\nitself. All the records agree in stating that the Maids were joined\r\ntogether at the shoulders and hips, and the impression on the cakes and\r\nthe pictures on the 'broadsides' show this peculiar mode of union, and\r\nrepresent the bodies as quite separate in the space between the\r\nabove-named points. The Maids are shown with four feet and two arms,\r\nthe right and left respectively, whilst the other arms (left and right)\r\nare fused together at the shoulder according to one illustration, and a\r\nlittle above the elbow according to another. Now, although it is not\r\nsafe to say that such an anomaly is impossible, I do not know of any\r\ncase of this peculiar mode of union; but it may be that, as Prof. A. R.\r\nSimpson has suggested, the Maids had four separate arms, and were in\r\nthe habit of going about with their contiguous arms round each other's\r\nnecks, and that this gave rise to the notion that these limbs were\r\nunited. If this be so, then the teratologic difficulty is removed, for\r\nthe case becomes perfectly comparable with the well-known but rare type\r\nof double terata known as the pygopagous twins, which is placed by\r\nTaruffi with that of the ischiopagous twins in the group dicephalus\r\nlecanopagus. Similar instances, which are well known to students of\r\nteratology, are the Hungarian sisters (Helen and Judith), the North\r\nCarolina twins (Millie and Christine), and the Bohemian twins (Rosalie\r\nand Josepha Blazek). The interspace between the thoraces may, however,\r\nhave simply been the addition of the first artist who portrayed the\r\nMaids (from imagination?); then it may be surmised that they were\r\nectopagous twins.\r\n\r\n\"Pygopagous twins are fetuses united together in the region of the\r\nnates and having each its own pelvis. In the recorded cases the union\r\nhas been usually between the sacra and coccyges, and has been either\r\nosseous or (more rarely) ligamentous. Sometimes the point of junction\r\nwas the middle line posteriorly, at other times it was rather a\r\nposterolateral union; and it is probable that in the Biddenden Maids it\r\nwas of the latter kind; and it is likely, from the proposal made to\r\nseparate the sisters after the death of one, that it was ligamentous in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"If it be granted that the Biddenden Maids were pygopagous twins, a\r\nstudy of the histories of other recorded cases of this monstrosity\r\nserves to demonstrate many common characters. Thus, of the 8 cases\r\nwhich Taruffi has collected, in 7 the twins were female; and if to\r\nthese we add the sisters Rosalie and Josepha Blazek and the Maids, we\r\nhave 10 cases, of which 9 were girls.  Again, several of the pygopagous\r\ntwins, of whom there are scientific records, survived birth and lived\r\nfor a number of years, and thus resembled the Biddenden terata. Helen\r\nand Judith, for instance, were twenty-three years old at death; and the\r\nNorth Carolina twins, although born in 1851, are still alive. There is,\r\ntherefore, nothing inherently improbable in the statement that the\r\nBiddenden Maids lived for thirty-four years. With regard also to the\r\ntruth of the record that the one Maid survived her sister for six\r\nhours, there is confirmatory evidence from scientifically observed\r\ninstances, for Joly and Peyrat (Bull. de l'Acad. Med., iii., pp. 51 and\r\n383, 1874) state that in the case seen by them the one infant lived ten\r\nhours after the death of the other. It is impossible to make any\r\nstatement with regard to the internal structure of the Maids or to the\r\ncharacters of their genital organs, for there is absolutely no\r\ninformation forthcoming upon these points. It may simply be said, in\r\nconclusion, that the phenomenon of Biddenden is interesting not only on\r\naccount of the curious bequest which arose out of it, but also because\r\nit was an instance of a very rare teratologic type, occurring at a very\r\nearly period in our national history.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly the most famous example of twins of this type were Helen and\r\nJudith, the Hungarian sisters, born in 1701 at Szony, in Hungary. They\r\nwere the objects of great curiosity, and were shown successively in\r\nHolland, Germany, Italy, France, England, and Poland. At the age of\r\nnine they were placed in a convent, where they died almost\r\nsimultaneously in their twenty-second year.  During their travels all\r\nover Europe they were examined by many prominent physiologists,\r\npsychologists, and naturalists; Pope and several minor poets have\r\ncelebrated their existence in verse; Buffon speaks of them in his\r\n\"Natural History,\" and all the works on teratology for a century or\r\nmore have mentioned them. A description of them can be best given by a\r\nquaint translation by Fisher of the Latin lines composed by a Hungarian\r\nphysician and inscribed on a bronze statuette of them:--\r\n\r\nTwo sisters wonderful to behold, who have thus grown as one, That\r\nnaught their bodies can divide, no power beneath the sun.  The town of\r\nSzoenii gave them birth, hard by far-famed Komorn, Which noble fort may\r\nall the arts of Turkish sultans scorn.  Lucina, woman's gentle friend,\r\ndid Helen first receive; And Judith, when three hours had passed, her\r\nmother's womb did leave.  One urine passage serves for both;--one anus,\r\nso they tell; The other parts their numbers keep, and serve their\r\nowners well.  Their parents poor did send them forth, the world to\r\ntravel through, That this great wonder of the age should not be hid\r\nfrom view.  The inner parts concealed do lie hid from our eyes, alas!\r\nBut all the body here you view erect in solid brass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were joined back to back in the lumbar region, and had all their\r\nparts separate except the anus between the right thigh of Helen and the\r\nleft of Judith and a single vulva. Helen was the larger, better\r\nlooking, the more active, and the more intelligent. Judith at the age\r\nof six became hemiplegic, and afterward was rather delicate and\r\ndepressed. They menstruated at sixteen and continued with regularity,\r\nalthough one began before the other. They had a mutual affection, and\r\ndid all in their power to alleviate the circumstances of their sad\r\nposition.  Judith died of cerebral and pulmonary affections, and Helen,\r\nwho previously enjoyed good health, soon after her sister's first\r\nindisposition suddenly sank into a state of collapse, although\r\npreserving her mental faculties, and expired almost immediately after\r\nher sister. They had measles and small-pox simultaneously, but were\r\naffected in different degree by the maladies. The emotions,\r\ninclinations, and appetites were not simultaneous.  Eccardus, in a very\r\ninteresting paper, discusses the physical, moral, and religious\r\nquestions in reference to these wonderful sisters, such as the\r\nadvisability of separation, the admissibility of matrimony, and,\r\nfinally, whether on the last day they would rise as joined in life, or\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of two united females, similar in conjunction to\r\nthe \"Hungarian sisters,\" who were born in Italy in 1700. They were\r\nkilled at the age of four months by an attempt of a surgeon to separate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 there was reported to have been born in Texas, twins after the\r\nmanner of Helen and Judith, united back to back, who lived and attained\r\nsome age. They were said to have been of different natures and\r\ndispositions, and inclined to quarrel very often.\r\n\r\nPancoast gives an extensive report of Millie-Christine, who had been\r\nextensively exhibited in Europe and the United States. They were born\r\nof slave parents in Columbus County, N.C., July 11, 1851; the mother,\r\nwho had borne 8 children before, was a stout negress of thirty-two,\r\nwith a large pelvis. The presentation was first by the stomach and\r\nafterward by the breech. These twins were united at the sacra by a\r\ncartilaginous or possibly osseous union. They were exhibited in Paris\r\nin 1873, and provoked as much discussion there as in the United States.\r\nPhysically, Millie was the weaker, but had the stronger will and the\r\ndominating spirit.  They menstruated regularly from the age of\r\nthirteen. One from long habit yielded instinctively to the other's\r\nmovements, thus preserving the necessary harmony. They ate separately,\r\nhad distinct thoughts, and carried on distinct conversations at the\r\nsame time. They experienced hunger and thirst generally simultaneously,\r\nand defecated and urinated nearly at the same times. One, in tranquil\r\nsleep, would be wakened by a call of nature of the other. Common\r\nsensibility was experienced near the location of union. They were\r\nintelligent and agreeable and of pleasant appearance, although slightly\r\nunder size; they sang duets with pleasant voices and accompanied\r\nthemselves with a guitar; they walked, ran, and danced with apparent\r\nease and grace. Christine could bend over and lift Millie up by the\r\nbond of union.\r\n\r\nA recent example of the pygopagus type was Rosa-Josepha Blazek, born in\r\nSkerychov, in Bohemia, January 20, 1878. These twins had a broad bony\r\nunion in the lower part of the lumbar region, the pelvis being\r\nobviously completely fused. They had a common urethral and anal\r\naperture, but a double vaginal orifice, with a very apparent septum.\r\nThe sensation was distinct in each, except where the pelves joined.\r\nThey were exhibited in Paris in 1891, being then on an exhibition tour\r\naround the world. Rosa was the stronger, and when she walked or ran\r\nforward she drew her sister with her, who must naturally have reversed\r\nher steps. They had independent thoughts and separate minds; one could\r\nsleep while the other was awake. Many of their appetites were\r\ndifferent, one preferring beer, the other wine; one relished salad, the\r\nother detested it, etc. Thirst and hunger were not simultaneous.\r\nBaudoin describes their anatomic construction, their mode of life, and\r\ntheir mannerisms and tastes in a quite recent article.  Fig. 42 is a\r\nreproduction of an early photograph of the twins, and Fig. 43\r\nrepresents a recent photograph of these \"Bohemian twins,\" as they are\r\nnow called.\r\n\r\nThe latest record we have of this type of monstrosity is that given by\r\nTynberg to the County Medical Society of New York, May 27, 1895. The\r\nmother was present with the remarkable twins in her arms, crying at the\r\ntop of their voices. These two children were born at midnight on April\r\n15th. Tynberg remarked that he believed them to be distinct and\r\nseparate children, and not dependent on a common arterial system; he\r\nalso expressed his intention of separating them, but did not believe\r\nthe operation could be performed with safety before another year.\r\nJacobi describes in full Tynberg's instance of pygopagus. He says the\r\nconfinement was easy; the head of one was born first, soon followed by\r\nthe feet and the rest of the twins. The placenta was single and the\r\ncord consisted of two branches. The twins were united below the third\r\nsacral vertebrae in such a manner that they could lie alongside of each\r\nother. They were females, and had two vaginae, two urethrae four labia\r\nminora, and two labia majora, one anus, but a double rectum divided by\r\na septum. They micturated independently but defecated simultaneously.\r\nThey virtually lived separate lives, as one might be asleep while the\r\nother cried, etc.\r\n\r\nCLASS V.--While instances of ischiopagi are quite numerous, few have\r\nattained any age, and, necessarily, little notoriety. Pare speaks of\r\ntwins united at the pelves, who were born in Paris July 20, 1570. They\r\nwere baptized, and named Louis and Louise. Their parents were well\r\nknown in the rue des Gravelliers. According to Bateman, and also Rueff,\r\nin the year 1552 there were born, not far from Oxford, female twins,\r\nwho, from the description given, were doubtless of the ischiopagus\r\ntype. They seldom wept, and one was of a cheerful disposition, while\r\nthe other was heavy and drowsy, sleeping continually. They only lived a\r\nshort time, one expiring a day before the other. Licetus speaks of Mrs.\r\nJohn Waterman, a resident of Fishertown, near Salisbury, England, who\r\ngave birth to a double female monster on October 26, 1664, which\r\nevidently from the description was joined by the ischii. It did not\r\nnurse, but took food by both the mouths; all its actions were done in\r\nconcert; it was possessed of one set of genitourinary organs; it only\r\nlived a short while. Many people in the region flocked to see the\r\nwonderful child, whom Licetus called \"Monstrum Anglicum.\" It is said\r\nthat at the same accouchement the birth of this monster was followed by\r\nthe birth of a well-formed female child, who survived.\r\nGeoffroy-Saint-Hilaire quotes a description of twins who were born in\r\nFrance on October 7, 1838, symmetrically formed and united at their\r\nischii. One was christened Marie-Louise, and the other\r\nHortense-Honorine. Their avaricious parents took the children to Paris\r\nfor exhibition, the exposures of which soon sacrificed their lives. In\r\nthe year 1841 there was born in the island of Ceylon, of native\r\nparents, a monstrous child that was soon brought to Columbo, where it\r\nlived only two months. It had two heads and seemed to have duplication\r\nin all its parts except the anus and male generative organs.\r\nMontgomery speaks of a double child born in County Roscommon, Ireland,\r\non the 24th of July, 1827. It had two heads, two chests with arms\r\ncomplete, two abdominal and pelvic cavities united end to end, and four\r\nlegs, placed two on either side. It had only one anus, which was\r\nsituated between the thighs. One of the twins was dark haired and was\r\nbaptized Mary, while the other was a blonde and was named Catherine.\r\nThese twins felt and acted independently of each other; they each in\r\nsuccession sucked from the breast or took milk from the spoon, and used\r\ntheir limbs vigorously. One vomited without affecting the other, but\r\nthe feces were discharged through a common opening.\r\n\r\nGoodell speaks of Minna and Minnie Finley, who were born in Ohio and\r\nexamined by him. They were fused together in a common longitudinal\r\naxis, having one pelvis, two heads, four legs, and four arms. One was\r\nweak and puny and the other robust and active; it is probable that they\r\nhad but one rectum and one bladder.  Goodell accompanies his\r\ndescription by the mention of several analogous cases. Ellis speaks of\r\nfemale twins, born in Millville, Tenn., and exhibited in New York in\r\n1868, who were joined at the pelves in a longitudinal axis. Between the\r\nlimbs on either side were to be seen well-developed female genitals,\r\nand the sisters had been known to urinate from both sides, beginning\r\nand ending at the same time.\r\n\r\nHuff details a description of the \"Jones twins,\" born on June 24, 1889,\r\nin Tipton County, Indiana, whose spinal columns were in apposition at\r\nthe lower end. The labor, of less than two hours' duration, was\r\ncompleted before the arrival of the physician.  Lying on their mother's\r\nback, they could both nurse at the same time. Both sets of genitals and\r\nani were on the same side of the line of union, but occupied normal\r\npositions with reference to the legs on either side. Their weight at\r\nbirth was 12 pounds and their length 22 inches. Their mother was a\r\nmedium-sized brunette of 19, and had one previous child then living at\r\nthe age of two; their father was a finely formed man 5 feet 10 inches\r\nin height.  The twins differed in complexion and color of the eyes and\r\nhair.  They were publicly exhibited for some time, and died February 19\r\nand 20, 1891, at St. John's Hotel, Buffalo, N.Y. Figure 45 shows their\r\nappearance several months after birth.\r\n\r\nCLASS VI.--In our sixth class, the first record we have is from the\r\nCommentaries of Sigbert, which contains a description of a monstrosity\r\nborn in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius, who had two heads, two\r\nchests with four arms attached, but a single lower extremity. The\r\nemotions, affections, and appetites were different. One head might be\r\ncrying while the other laughed, or one feeding while the other was\r\nsleeping. At times they quarreled and occasionally came to blows. This\r\nmonster is said to have lived two years, one part dying four days\r\nbefore the other, which evinced symptoms of decay like its inseparable\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\nRoger of Wendover says that in Lesser Brittany and Normandy, in 1062,\r\nthere was seen a female monster, consisting of two women joined about\r\nthe umbilicus and fused into a single lower extremity. They took their\r\nfood by two mouths but expelled it at a single orifice. At one time,\r\none of the women laughed, feasted, and talked, while the other wept,\r\nfasted, and kept a religious silence. The account relates how one of\r\nthem died, and the survivor bore her dead sister about for three years\r\nbefore she was overcome by the oppression and stench of the cadaver.\r\nBatemen describes the birth of a boy in 1529, who had two heads, four\r\nears, four arms, but only two thighs and two legs. Buchanan speaks at\r\nlength of the famous \"Scottish Brothers,\" who were the cynosure of the\r\neyes of the Court of James III of Scotland. This monster consisted of\r\ntwo men, ordinary in appearance in the superior extremities, whose\r\ntrunks fused into a single lower extremity. The King took diligent care\r\nof their education, and they became proficient in music, languages, and\r\nother court accomplishments. Between them they would carry on animated\r\nconversations, sometimes merging into curious debates, followed by\r\nblows. Above the point of union they had no synchronous sensations,\r\nwhile below, sensation was common to both. This monster lived\r\ntwenty-eight years, surviving the royal patron, who died June, 1488.\r\nOne of the brothers died some days before the other, and the survivor,\r\nafter carrying about his dead brother, succumbed to \"infection from\r\nputrescence.\" There was reported to have been born in Switzerland a\r\ndouble headed male monster, who in 1538, at the age of thirty, was\r\npossessed of a beard on each face, the two bodies fused at the\r\numbilicus into a single lower extremity. These two twins resembled one\r\nanother in contour and countenance. They were so joined that at rest\r\nthey looked upon one another. They had a single wife, with whom they\r\nwere said to have lived in harmony. In the Gentleman's Magazine about\r\none hundred and fifty years since there was given the portrait and\r\ndescription of a double woman, who was exhibited all over the large\r\ncities of Europe. Little can be ascertained anatomically of her\r\nconstruction, with the exception that it was stated that she had two\r\nheads, two necks, four arms, two legs, one pelvis, and one set of\r\npelvic organs.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated monster of this type was Ritta-Christina, who was\r\nborn in Sassari, in Sardinia, March 23, 1829. These twins were the\r\nresult of the ninth confinement of their mother, a woman of thirty-two.\r\nTheir superior extremities were double, but they joined in a common\r\ntrunk at a point a little below the mammae.  Below this point they had\r\na common trunk and single lower extremities. The right one, christened\r\nRitta, was feeble and of a sad and melancholy countenance; the left,\r\nChristina, was vigorous and of a gay and happy aspect. They suckled at\r\ndifferent times, and sensations in the upper extremities were distinct.\r\nThey expelled urine and feces simultaneously, and had the indications\r\nin common. Their parents, who were very poor, brought them to Paris for\r\nthe purpose of public exhibition, which at first was accomplished\r\nclandestinely, but finally interdicted by the public authorities, who\r\nfeared that it would open a door for psychologic discussion and\r\nspeculation. This failure of the parents to secure public patronage\r\nincreased their poverty and hastened the death of the children by\r\nunavoidable exposure in a cold room. The nervous system of the twins\r\nhad little in common except in the line of union, the anus, and the\r\nsexual organs, and Christina was in good health all through Ritta's\r\nsickness; when Ritta died, her sister, who was suckling at the mother's\r\nbreast, suddenly relaxed hold and expired with a sigh. At the\r\npostmortem, which was secured with some difficulty on account of the\r\nauthorities ordering the bodies to be burned, the pericardium was found\r\nsingle, covering both hearts. The digestive organs were double and\r\nseparate as far as the lower third of the ilium, and the cecum was on\r\nthe left side and single, in common with the lower bowel. The livers\r\nwere fused and the uterus was double. The vertebral columns, which were\r\nentirely separate above, were joined below by a rudimentary os\r\ninnorminatum. There was a junction between the manubrium of each. Sir\r\nAstley Cooper saw a monster in Paris in 1792 which, by his description,\r\nmust have been very similar to Ritta-Christina.\r\n\r\nThe Tocci brothers were born in 1877 in the province of Turin, Italy.\r\nThey each had a well-formed head, perfect arms, and a perfect thorax to\r\nthe sixth rib; they had a common abdomen, a single anus, two legs, two\r\nsacra, two vertebral columns, one penis, but three buttocks, the\r\ncentral one containing a rudimentary anus. The right boy was christened\r\nGiovanni-Batista, and the left Giacomo. Each individual had power over\r\nthe corresponding leg on his side, but not over the other one.  Walking\r\nwas therefore impossible. All their sensations and emotions were\r\ndistinctly individual and independent. At the time of the report, in\r\n1882, they were in good health and showed every indication of attaining\r\nadult age. Figure 48 represents these twins as they were exhibited\r\nseveral years ago in Germany.\r\n\r\nMcCallum saw two female children in Montreal in 1878 named Marie-Rosa\r\nDrouin. They formed a right angle with their single trunk, which\r\ncommenced at the lower part of the thorax of each.  They had a single\r\ngenital fissure and the external organs of generation of a female. A\r\nlittle over three inches from the anus was a rudimentary limb with a\r\nmovable articulation; it measured five inches in length and tapered to\r\na fine point, being furnished with a distinct nail, and it contracted\r\nstrongly to irritation. Marie, the left child, was of fair complexion\r\nand more strongly developed than Rosa. The sensations of hunger and\r\nthirst were not experienced at the same time, and one might be asleep\r\nwhile the other was crying. The pulsations and the respiratory\r\nmovements were not synchronous. They were the products of the second\r\ngestation of a mother aged twenty-six, whose abdomen was of such\r\npreternatural size during pregnancy that she was ashamed to appear in\r\npublic. The order of birth was as follows: one head and body, the lower\r\nextremity, and the second body and head.\r\n\r\nCLASS VII.--There are many instances of bicephalic monsters on record.\r\nPare mentions and gives an illustration of a female apparently single\r\nin conformation, with the exception of having two heads and two necks.\r\nThe Ephemerides, Haller, Schenck, and Archenholz cite examples, and\r\nthere is an old account of a double-headed child, each of whose heads\r\nwere baptized, one called Martha and the other Mary. One was of a gay\r\nand the other a sad visage, and both heads received nourishment; they\r\nonly lived a couple of days. There is another similar record of a\r\nMilanese girl who had two heads, but was in all other respects single,\r\nwith the exception that after death she was found to have had two\r\nstomachs. Besse mentions a Bavarian woman of twenty-six with two heads,\r\none of which was comely and the other extremely ugly; Batemen quotes\r\nwhat is apparently the same case--a woman in Bavaria in 1541 with two\r\nheads, one of which was deformed, who begged from door to door, and who\r\nby reason of the influence of pregnant women was given her expenses to\r\nleave the country.\r\n\r\nA more common occurrence of this type is that in which there is fusion\r\nof the two heads. Moreau speaks of a monster in Spain which was shown\r\nfrom town to town. Its heads were fused; it had two mouths and two\r\nnoses; in each face an eye well conformed and placed above the nose;\r\nthere was a third eye in the middle of the forehead common to both\r\nheads; the third eye was of primitive development and had two pupils.\r\nEach face was well formed and had its own chin. Buffon mentions a cat,\r\nthe exact analogue of Moreau's case. Sutton speaks of a photograph sent\r\nto Sir James Paget in 1856 by William Budd of Bristol. This portrays a\r\nliving child with a supernumerary head, which had mouth, nose, eyes,\r\nand a brain of its own. The eyelids were abortive, and as there was no\r\norbital cavity the eyes stood out in the form of naked globes on the\r\nforehead. When born, the corneas of both heads were transparent, but\r\nthen became opaque from exposure. The brain of the supernumerary head\r\nwas quite visible from without, and was covered by a membrane beginning\r\nto slough. On the right side of the head was a rudimentary external\r\near. The nurse said that when the child sucked some milk regurgitated\r\nthrough the supernumerary mouth. The great physiologic interest in this\r\ncase lies in the fact that every movement and every act of the natural\r\nface was simultaneously repeated by the supernumerary face in a\r\nperfectly consensual manner, i.e., when the natural mouth sucked, the\r\nsecond mouth sucked; when the natural face cried, yawned, or sneezed,\r\nthe second face did likewise; and the eyes of the two heads moved in\r\nunison. The fate of the child is not known.\r\n\r\nHome speaks of a child born in Bengal with a most peculiar fusion of\r\nthe head. The ordinary head was nearly perfect and of usual volume, but\r\nfused with its vertex and reversed was a supernumerary head. Each head\r\nhad its own separate vessels and brain, and each an individual\r\nsensibility, but if one had milk first the other had an abundance of\r\nsaliva in its mouth. It narrowly escaped being burned to death at\r\nbirth, as the midwife, greatly frightened by the monstrous appearance,\r\nthrew it into the fire to destroy it, from whence it was rescued,\r\nalthough badly burned, the vicious conformation of the accessory head\r\nbeing possibly due to the accident. At the age of four it was bitten by\r\na venomous serpent and, as a result, died. Its skull is in the\r\npossession of the Royal College of Surgeons in London.\r\n\r\nThe following well-known story of Edward Mordake, though taken from lay\r\nsources, is of sufficient notoriety and interest to be mentioned here:--\r\n\r\n\"One of the weirdest as well as most melancholy stories of human\r\ndeformity is that of Edward Mordake, said to have been heir to one of\r\nthe noblest peerages in England. He never claimed the title, however,\r\nand committed suicide in his twenty-third year.  He lived in complete\r\nseclusion, refusing the visits even of the members of his own family.\r\nHe was a young man of fine attainments, a profound scholar, and a\r\nmusician of rare ability.  His figure was remarkable for its grace, and\r\nhis face--that is to say, his natural face--was that of an Antinous.\r\nBut upon the back of his head was another face, that of a beautiful\r\ngirl, 'lovely as a dream, hideous as a devil.' The female face was a\r\nmere mask, 'occupying only a small portion of the posterior part of the\r\nskull, yet exhibiting every sign of intelligence, of a malignant sort,\r\nhowever.' It would be seen to smile and sneer while Mordake was\r\nweeping. The eyes would follow the movements of the spectator, and the\r\nlips would 'gibber without ceasing.' No voice was audible, but Mordake\r\navers that he was kept from his rest at night by the hateful whispers\r\nof his 'devil twin,' as he called it, 'which never sleeps, but talks to\r\nme forever of such things as they only speak of in hell. No imagination\r\ncan conceive the dreadful temptations it sets before me. For some\r\nunforgiven wickedness of my forefathers I am knit to this fiend--for a\r\nfiend it surely is. I beg and beseech you to crush it out of human\r\nsemblance, even if I die for it.' Such were the words of the hapless\r\nMordake to Manvers and Treadwell, his physicians. In spite of careful\r\nwatching he managed to procure poison, whereof he died, leaving a\r\nletter requesting that the 'demon face' might be destroyed before his\r\nburial, 'lest it continues its dreadful whisperings in my grave.' At\r\nhis own request he was interred in a waste place, without stone or\r\nlegend to mark his grave.\"\r\n\r\nA most curious case was that of a Fellah woman who was delivered at\r\nAlexandria of a bicephalic monster of apparently eight months'\r\npregnancy. This creature, which was born dead, had one head white and\r\nthe other black the change of color commencing at the neck of the black\r\nhead. The bizarre head was of negro conformation and fully developed,\r\nand the colored skin was found to be due to the existence of pigment\r\nsimilar to that found in the black race. The husband of the woman had a\r\nlight brown skin, like an ordinary Fellah man, and it was ascertained\r\nthat there were some negro laborers in port during the woman's\r\npregnancy; but no definite information as to her relations with them\r\ncould be established, and whether this was a case of maternal\r\nimpression or superfetation can only be a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nFantastic monsters, such as acephalon, paracephalon, cyclops,\r\npseudencephalon, and the janiceps, prosopthoracopagus, disprosopus,\r\netc., although full of interest, will not be discussed here, as none\r\nare ever viable for any length of time, and the declared intention of\r\nthis chapter is to include only those beings who have lived.\r\n\r\nCLASS VIII.--The next class includes the parasitic terata, monsters\r\nthat consist of one perfect body, complete in every respect, but from\r\nthe neighborhood of whose umbilicus depends some important portion of a\r\nsecond body. Pare, Benivenius, and Columbus describe adults with\r\nacephalous monsters attached to them. Schenck mentions 13 cases, 3 of\r\nwhich were observed by him.  Aldrovandus shows 3 illustrations under\r\nthe name of \"monstrum bicorpum monocephalon.\" Bustorf speaks of a case\r\nin which the nates and lower extremities of one body proceeded out of\r\nthe abdomen of the other, which was otherwise perfect. Reichel and\r\nAnderson mention a living parasitic monster, the inferior trunk of one\r\nbody proceeding from the pectoral region of the other.\r\n\r\nPare says that there was a man in Paris in 1530, quite forty years of\r\nage, who carried about a parasite without a head, which hung pendant\r\nfrom his belly. This individual was exhibited and drew great crowds.\r\nPare appends an illustration, which is, perhaps, one of the most\r\nfamiliar in all teratology. He also gives a portrait of a man who had a\r\nparasitic head proceeding from his epigastrium, and who was born in\r\nGermany the same year that peace was made with the Swiss by King\r\nFrancis. This creature lived to manhood and both heads were utilized in\r\nalimentation.  Bartholinus details a history of an individual named\r\nLazarus-Joannes Baptista Colloredo, born in Genoa in 1617, who\r\nexhibited himself all over Europe. From his epigastrium hung an\r\nimperfectly developed twin that had one thigh, hands, body, arms, and a\r\nwell-formed head covered with hair, which in the normal position hung\r\nlowest. There were signs of independent existence in the parasite,\r\nmovements of respiration, etc., but its eyes were closed, and, although\r\nsaliva constantly dribbled from its open mouth, nothing was ever\r\ningested. The genitals were imperfect and the arms ended in badly\r\nformed hands. Bartholinus examined this monster at twenty-two, and has\r\ngiven the best report, although while in Scotland in 1642 he was again\r\nexamined, and accredited with being married and the father of several\r\nchildren who were fully and admirably developed. Moreau quotes a case\r\nof an infant similar in conformation to the foregoing monster, who was\r\nborn in Switzerland in 1764, and whose supernumerary parts were\r\namputated by means of a ligature.  Winslow reported before the Academie\r\nRoyale des Sciences the history of a girl of twelve who died at the\r\nHotel-Dieu in 1733.  She was of ordinary height and of fair\r\nconformation, with the exception that hanging from the left flank was\r\nthe inferior half of another girl of diminutive proportions. The\r\nsupernumerary body was immovable, and hung so heavily that it was said\r\nto be supported by the hands or by a sling. Urine and feces were\r\nevacuated at intervals from the parasite, and received into a diaper\r\nconstantly worn for this purpose. Sensibility in the two was common, an\r\nimpression applied to the parasite being felt by the girl. Winslow\r\ngives an interesting report of the dissection of this monster, and\r\nmentions that he had seen an Italian child of eight who had a small\r\nhead proceeding from under the cartilage of the third left rib.\r\nSensibility was common, pinching the ear of the parasitic head causing\r\nthe child with the perfect head to cry. Each of the two heads received\r\nbaptism, one being named John and the other Matthew. A curious question\r\narose in the instance of the girl, as to whether the extreme unction\r\nshould be administered to the acephalous fetus as well as to the child.\r\n\r\nIn 1742, during the Ambassadorship of the Marquis de l'Hopital at\r\nNaples, he saw in that city an aged man, well conformed, with the\r\nexception that, like the little girl of Winslow, he had the inferior\r\nextremities of a male child growing from his epigastric region. Haller\r\nand Meckel have also observed cases like this.  Bordat described before\r\nthe Royal Institute of France, August, 1826, a Chinaman, twenty-one\r\nyears of age, who had an acephalous fetus attached to the surface of\r\nhis breast (possibly \"A-ke\").\r\n\r\nDickinson describes a wonderful child five years old, who, by an\r\nextraordinary freak of nature, was an amalgamation of two children.\r\nFrom the body of an otherwise perfectly formed child was a\r\nsupernumerary head protruding from a broad base attached to the lower\r\nlumbar and sacral region. This cephalic mass was covered with hair\r\nabout four or five inches long, and showed the rudiments of an eye,\r\nnose, mouth, and chin. This child was on exhibition when Dickinson saw\r\nit. Montare and Reyes were commissioned by the Academy of Medicine of\r\nHavana to examine and report on a monstrous girl of seven months,\r\nliving in Cuba. The girl was healthy and well developed, and from the\r\nmiddle line of her body between the xiphoid cartilage and the\r\numbilicus, attached by a soft pedicle, was an accessory individual,\r\nirregular, of ovoid shape, the smaller end, representing the head,\r\nbeing upward. The parasite measured a little over 1 foot in length, 9\r\ninches about the head, and 7 3/4 inches around the neck. The cranial\r\nbones were distinctly felt, and the top of the head was covered by a\r\ncirclet of hair. There were two rudimentary eyebrows; the left eye was\r\nrepresented by a minute perforation encircled with hair; the right eye\r\nwas traced by one end of a mucous groove which ran down to another\r\ntransverse groove representing the mouth; the right third of this\r\nlatter groove showed a primitive tongue and a triangular tooth, which\r\nappeared at the fifth month. There was a soft, imperforate nose, and\r\nthe elements of the vertebral column could be distinguished beneath the\r\nskin; there were no legs; apparently no vascular sounds; there was\r\nseparate sensation, as the parasite could be pinched without attracting\r\nthe perfect infant's notice. The mouth of the parasite constantly\r\ndribbled saliva, but showed no indication of receiving aliment.\r\n\r\nLouise L., known as \"La dame a quatre jambes,\" was born in 1869, and\r\nhad attached to her pelvis another rudimentary pelvis and two atrophied\r\nlegs of a parasite, weighing 8 kilos. The attachment was effected by\r\nmeans of a pedicle 33 cm. in diameter, having a bony basis, and being\r\nfixed without a joint. The attachment almost obliterated the vulva and\r\nthe perineum was displaced far backward. At the insertion of the\r\nparasite were two rudimentary mammae, one larger than the other. No\r\ngenitalia were seen on the parasite and it exhibited no active\r\nmovements, the joints of both limbs being ankylosed. The woman could\r\nlocalize sensations in the parasite except those of the feet. She had\r\nbeen married five years, and bore, in the space of three years, two\r\nwell-formed daughters.\r\n\r\nQuite recently there was exhibited in the museums of the United States\r\nan individual bearing the name \"Laloo,\" who was born in Oudh, India,\r\nand was the second of four children. At the time of examination he was\r\nabout nineteen years of age. The upper portion of a parasite was firmly\r\nattached to the lower right side of the sternum of the individual by a\r\nbony pedicle, and lower by a fleshy pedicle, and apparently contained\r\nintestines. The anus of the parasite was imperforate; a well-developed\r\npenis was found, but no testicles; there was a luxuriant growth of hair\r\non the pubes. The penis of the parasite was said to show signs of\r\nerection at times, and urine passed through it without the knowledge of\r\nthe boy. Perspiration and elevation of temperature seemed to occur\r\nsimultaneously in both. To pander to the morbid curiosity of the\r\ncurious, the \"Dime Museum\" managers at one time shrewdly clothed the\r\nparasite in female attire, calling the two brother and sister; but\r\nthere is no doubt that all the traces of sex were of the male type. An\r\nanalogous case was that of \"A-Ke,\" a Chinaman, who was exhibited in\r\nLondon early in the century, and of whom and his parasite anatomic\r\nmodels are seen in our museums.  Figure 58 represents an epignathus, a\r\npeculiar type parasitic monster, in which the parasite is united to the\r\ninferior maxillary bone of the autosite.\r\n\r\nCLASS IX.--Of \"Lusus naturae\" none is more curious than that of\r\nduplication of the lower extremities. Pare says that on January 9,\r\n1529, there was living in Germany a male infant having four legs and\r\nfour arms. In Paris, at the Academie des Sciences, on September 6,\r\n1830, there was presented by Madame Hen, a midwife, a living male child\r\nwith four legs, the anus being nearly below the middle of the third\r\nbuttock; and the scrotum between the two left thighs, the testicles not\r\nyet descended. There was a well-formed and single pelvis, and the\r\nsupernumerary legs were immovable. Aldrovandus mentions several similar\r\ninstances, and gives the figure of one born in Rome; he also describes\r\nseveral quadruped birds. Bardsley speaks of a male child with one head,\r\nfour arms, four legs, and double generative organs. He gives a portrait\r\nof the child when it was a little over a year old.  Heschl published in\r\nVienna in 1878 a description of a girl of seventeen, who instead of\r\nhaving a duplication of the superior body, as in \"Millie-Christine, the\r\ntwo-headed nightingale,\" had double parts below the second lumbar\r\nvertebra. Her head and upper body resembled a comely, delicate girl of\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\nWells a describes Mrs. B., aged twenty, still alive and healthy.  The\r\nduplication in this case begins just above the waist, the spinal column\r\ndividing at the third lumbar vertebra, below this point everything\r\nbeing double. Micturition and defecation occur at different times, but\r\nmenstruation occurs simultaneously. She was married at nineteen, and\r\nbecame pregnant a year later on the left side, but abortion was induced\r\nat the fourth month on account of persistent nausea and the expectation\r\nof impossible delivery. Whaley, in speaking of this case, said Mrs. B.\r\nutilized her outside legs for walking; he also remarks that when he\r\ninformed her that she was pregnant on the left side she replied, \"I\r\nthink you are mistaken; if it had been on my right side I would come\r\nnearer believing it;\"--and after further questioning he found, from the\r\npatient's observation, that her right genitals were almost invariably\r\nused for coitus. Bechlinger of Para, Brazil, describes a woman of\r\ntwenty-five, a native of Martinique, whose father was French and mother\r\na quadroon, who had a modified duplication of the lower body. There was\r\na third leg attached to a continuation of the processus coceygeus of\r\nthe sacrum, and in addition to well developed mammae regularly\r\nsituated, there were two rudimentary ones close together above the\r\npubes. There were two vaginae and two well-developed vulvae, both\r\nhaving equally developed sensations. The sexual appetite was markedly\r\ndeveloped, and coitus was practised in both vaginae. A somewhat similar\r\ncase, possibly the same, is that of Blanche Dumas, born in 1860.  She\r\nhad a very broad pelvis, two imperfectly developed legs, and a\r\nsupernumerary limb attached to the symphysis, without a joint, but with\r\nslight passive movement. There was a duplication of bowel, bladder, and\r\ngenitalia. At the junction of the rudimentary limb with the body, in\r\nfront, were two rudimentary mammary glands, each containing a nipple.\r\n\r\nOther instances of supernumerary limbs will be found in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nCLASS X.--The instances of diphallic terata, by their intense interest\r\nto the natural bent of the curious mind, have always elicited much\r\ndiscussion. To many of these cases have been attributed exaggerated\r\nfunction, notwithstanding the fact that modern observation almost\r\ninvariably shows that the virile power diminishes in exact proportion\r\nto the extent of duplication.  Taylor quotes a description of a\r\nmonster, exhibited in London, with two distinct penises, but with only\r\none distinct testicle on either side. He could exercise the function of\r\neither organ.\r\n\r\nSchenck, Schurig, Bartholinus, Loder, and Ollsner report instances of\r\ndiphallic terata; the latter case a was in a soldier of Charles VI,\r\ntwenty-two years old, who applied to the surgeon for a bubonic\r\naffection, and who declared that he passed urine from the orifice of\r\nthe left glans and also said that he was incapable of true coitus.\r\nValentini mentions an instance in a boy of four, in which the two\r\npenises were superimposed. Bucchettoni speaks of a man with two penises\r\nplaced side by side. There was an anonymous case described of a man of\r\nninety-three with a penis which was for more than half its length\r\ndivided into two distinct members, the right being somewhat larger than\r\nthe left. From the middle of the penis up to the symphysis only the\r\nlower wall of the urethra was split. Jenisch describes a diphallic\r\ninfant, the offspring of a woman of twenty-five who had been married\r\nfive years. Her first child was a well-formed female, and the second,\r\nthe infant in question, cried much during the night, and several times\r\nvomited dark-green matter. In lieu of one penis there were two,\r\nsituated near each other, the right one of natural size and the left\r\nlarger, but not furnished with a prepuce. Each penis had its own\r\nurethra, from which dribbled urine and some meconium.  There was a\r\nduplication of each scrotum, but only one testicle in each, and several\r\nother minor malformations.\r\n\r\nGore, reported by Velpeau, has seen an infant of eight and one-half\r\nmonths with two penises and three lower extremities. The penises were 4\r\ncm. apart and the scrotum divided, containing one testicle in each\r\nside. Each penis was provided with a urethra, urine being discharged\r\nfrom both simultaneously. In a similar case, spoken of by\r\nGeoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, the two organs were also separate, but urine\r\nand semen escaped sometimes from one, sometimes from both.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of all the diphallic terata was Jean Baptista dos\r\nSantos, who when but six months old was spoken of by Acton.  His father\r\nand mother were healthy and had two well-formed children. He was easily\r\nborn after an uneventful pregnancy. He was good-looking, well\r\nproportioned, and had two distinct penises, each as large as that of a\r\nchild of six months.  Urination proceeded simultaneously from both\r\npenises; he had also two scrotums. Behind and between the legs there\r\nwas another limb, or rather two, united throughout their length. It was\r\nconnected to the pubis by a short stem 1/2 inch long and as large as\r\nthe little finger, consisting of separate bones and cartilages. There\r\nwas a patella in the supernumerary limb on the anal aspect, and a joint\r\nfreely movable. This compound limb had no power of motion, but was\r\nendowed with sensibility. A journal in London, after quoting Acton's\r\ndescription, said that the child had been exhibited in Paris, and that\r\nthe surgeons advised operation.  Fisher, to whom we are indebted for an\r\nexhaustive work in Teratology, received a report from Havana in July,\r\n1865, which detailed a description of Santos at twenty-two years of\r\nage, and said that he was possessed of extraordinary animal passion,\r\nthe sight of a female alone being sufficient to excite him. He was said\r\nto use both penises, after finishing with one continuing with the\r\nother; but this account of him does not agree with later descriptions,\r\nin which no excessive sexual ability had been noticed. Hart describes\r\nthe adult Santos in full, and accompanies his article with an\r\nillustration. At this time he was said to have developed double\r\ngenitals, and possibly a double bladder communicating by an imperfect\r\nseptum. At adulthood the anus was three inches anterior to the os\r\ncoceygeus. In the sitting or lying posture the supernumerary limb\r\nrested on the front of the inner surface of the lower third of his left\r\nthigh. He was in the habit of wearing this limb in a sling, or bound\r\nfirmly to the right thigh, to prevent its unseemly dangling when erect.\r\nThe perineum proper was absent, the entire space between the anus and\r\nthe posterior edge of the scrotum being occupied by the pedicle.\r\nSantos' mental and physical functions were developed above normal, and\r\nhe impressed everybody with his accomplishments.\r\nGeoffroy-Saint-Hilaire records an instance in which the conformation\r\nwas similar to that of Santos. There was a third lower extremity\r\nconsisting of two limbs fused into one with a single foot containing\r\nten distinct digits. He calls the case one of arrested twin development.\r\n\r\nVan Buren and Keyes describe a case in a man of forty-two, of good,\r\nhealthy appearance. The two distinct penises of normal size were\r\napparently well formed and were placed side by side, each attached at\r\nits root to the symphysis. Their covering of skin was common as far as\r\nthe base of the glans; at this point they seemed distinct and perfect,\r\nbut the meatus of the left was imperforate.  The right meatus was\r\nnormal, and through it most of the urine passed, though some always\r\ndribbled through an opening in the perineum at a point where the root\r\nof the scrotum should have been. On lifting the double-barreled penis\r\nthis opening could be seen and was of sufficient size to admit the\r\nfinger. On the right side of the aperture was an elongated and rounded\r\nprominence similar in outline to a labium majus. This prominence\r\ncontained a testicle normal in shape and sensibility, but slightly\r\nundersized, and surrounded, as was evident from its mobility, by a\r\ntunica vaginalis. The left testicle lay on the tendon of the adductor\r\nlongus in the left groin; it was not fully developed, but the patient\r\nhad sexual desires, erections, and emissions.  Both penises became\r\nerect simultaneously, the right more vigorously. The left leg was\r\nshorter than the right and congenitally smaller; the mammae were of\r\nnormal dimensions.\r\n\r\nSangalli speaks of a man of thirty-five who had a supernumerary penis,\r\nfurnished with a prepuce and capable of erection. At the apex of the\r\nglans opened a canal about 12 cm. long, through which escaped monthly a\r\nserous fluid. Smith mentions a man who had two penises and two\r\nbladders, on one of which lithotomy was performed. According to\r\nBallantyne, Taruffi, the scholarly observer of terata, mentions a child\r\nof forty-two months and height of 80 cm. who had two penises, each\r\nfurnished with a urethra and well-formed scrotal sacs which were\r\ninserted in a fold of the groin. There were two testicles felt in the\r\nright scrotum and one in the left. Fecal evacuations escaped through\r\ntwo anal orifices. There is also another case mentioned similar to the\r\nforegoing in a man of forty; but here there was an osseous projection\r\nin the middle line behind the bladder. This patient said that erection\r\nwas simultaneous in both penises, and that he had not married because\r\nof his chagrin over his deformity. Cole speaks of a child with two\r\nwell-developed male organs, one to the left and the other to the right\r\nof the median line, and about 1/4 or 1/2 inch apart at birth. The\r\nurethra bifurcated in the perineal region and sent a branch to each\r\npenis, and urine passed from each meatus. The scrotum was divided into\r\nthree compartments by two raphes, and each compartment contained a\r\ntesticle. The anus at birth was imperforate, but the child was\r\nsuccessfully operated on, and at its sixtieth day weighed 17 pounds.\r\n\r\nLange says that an infant was brought to Karg for relief of anal\r\natresia when fourteen days old. It was found to possess duplicate\r\npenises, which communicated each to its distinct half of the bladder as\r\ndefined by a median fold. The scrotum was divided into three portions\r\nby two raphes, and each lateral compartment contained a fully formed\r\ntesticle. This child died because of its anal malformation, which we\r\nnotice is a frequent associate of malformations or duplicity of the\r\npenis. There is an example in an infant described in which there were\r\ntwo penises, each about 1/2 inch long, and a divided scrotal sac 21\r\ninches long. Englisch speaks of a German of forty who possessed a\r\ndouble penis of the bifid type.\r\n\r\nBallantyne and his associates define diphallic terata as individuals\r\nprovided with two more or less well-formed and more or less separate\r\npenises, who may show also other malformations of the adjoining parts\r\nand organs (e.g., septate bladder), but who are not possessed of more\r\nthan two lower limbs. This definition excludes, therefore, the cases in\r\nwhich in addition to a double penis there is a supernumerary lower\r\nextremity--such a case, for example, as that of Jean Baptista dos\r\nSantos, so frequently described by teratologists. It also excludes the\r\nmore evident double terata, and, of course, the cases of duplication of\r\nthe female genital organs (double clitoris, vulva, vagina, and uterus).\r\nAlthough Schurig, Meckel, Himly, Taruffi, and others give bibliographic\r\nlists of diphallic terata, even in them erroneous references are\r\ncommon, and there is evidence to show that many cases have been\r\nduplicated under different names.  Ballantyne and Skirving have\r\nconsulted all the older original references available and eliminated\r\nduplications of reports and, adhering to their original definition,\r\nhave collected and described individually 20 cases; they offer the\r\nfollowing conclusions:--\r\n\r\n1. Diphallus, or duplication of the penis in an otherwise apparently\r\nsingle individual, is a very rare anomaly, records of only 20 cases\r\nhaving been found in a fairly exhaustive search through teratologic\r\nliterature. As a distinct and well-authenticated type it has only quite\r\nrecently been recognized by teratologists.\r\n\r\n2. It does not of itself interfere with intrauterine or extrauterine\r\nlife; but the associated anomalies (e.g., atresia ani) may be sources\r\nof danger. If not noticed at birth, it is not usually discovered till\r\nadult life, and even then the discovery is commonly accidental.\r\n\r\n3. With regard to the functions of the pelvic viscera, urine may be\r\npassed by both penises, by one only, or by neither. In the last\r\ninstance it finds exit by an aperture in the perineum. There is reason\r\nto believe that semen may be passed in the same way; but in most of the\r\nrecorded cases there has been sterility, if not inability to perform\r\nthe sexual act.\r\n\r\n4. All the degrees of duplication have been met with, from a fissure of\r\nthe glans penis to the presence of two distinct penises inserted at\r\nsome distance from each other in the inguinal regions.\r\n\r\n5. The two penises are usually somewhat defective as regards prepuce,\r\nurethra, etc.; they may lie side by side, or more rarely may be\r\nsituated anteroposteriorly; they may be equal in size, or less commonly\r\none is distinctly larger than the other; and one or both may be\r\nperforate or imperforate.\r\n\r\n6. The scrotum may be normal or split; the testicles, commonly two in\r\nnumber, may be normal or atrophic, descended or undescended; the\r\nprostate may be normal or imperfectly developed, as may also the vasa\r\ndeferentia and vesiculae seminales.\r\n\r\n7. The commonly associated defects are: More or less completely septate\r\nbladder, atresia ani, or more rarely double anus, double urethra,\r\nincreased breadth of the bony pelvis with defect of the symphysis\r\npubis, and possibly duplication of the lower end of the spine, and\r\nhernia of some of the abdominal contents into a perineal pouch. Much\r\nmore rarely, duplication of the heart, lungs, stomach, and kidneys has\r\nbeen noted, and the lower limbs may be shorter than normal.\r\n\r\nCLASS XI.--Cases of fetus in fetu, those strange instances in which one\r\nmight almost say that a man may be pregnant with his brother or sister,\r\nor in which an infant may carry its twin without the fact being\r\napparent, will next be discussed. The older cases were cited as being\r\nonly a repetition of the process by which Eve was born of Adam. Figure\r\n63 represents an old engraving showing the birth of Eve. Bartholinus,\r\nthe Ephemerides, Otto, Paullini, Schurig, and Plot speak of instances\r\nof fetus in fetu. Ruysch describes a tumor contained in the abdomen of\r\na man which was composed of hair, molar teeth, and other evidences of a\r\nfetus. Huxham reported to the Royal Society in 1748 the history of a\r\nchild which was born with a tumor near the anus larger than the whole\r\nbody of the child; this tumor contained rudiments of an embryo. Young\r\nspeaks of a fetus which lay encysted between the laminae of the\r\ntransverse mesocolon, and Highmore published a report of a fetus in a\r\ncyst communicating with the duodenum.  Dupuytren gives an example in a\r\nboy of thirteen, in whom was found a fetus. Gaetano-Nocito, cited by\r\nPhilipeaux, has the history of a taken with a great pain in the right\r\nhypochondrium, and from which issued subsequently fetal bones and a\r\nmass of macerated embryo. His mother had had several double\r\npregnancies, and from the length of the respective tibiae one of the\r\nfetuses seemed to be of two months' and the other of three months'\r\nintrauterine life. The man died five years after the abscess had burst\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\nBrodie speaks of a case in which fetal remains were taken from the\r\nabdomen of a girl of two and one-half years. Gaither describes a child\r\nof two years and nine months, supposed to be affected with ascites, who\r\ndied three hours after the physician's arrival. In its abdomen was\r\nfound a fetus weighing almost two pounds and connected to the child by\r\na cord resembling an umbilical cord. This child was healthy for about\r\nnine months, and had a precocious longing for ardent spirits, and drank\r\nfreely an hour before its death.\r\n\r\nBlundell says that he knew \"a boy who was literally and without evasion\r\nwith child, for the fetus was contained in a sac communicating with the\r\nabdomen and was connected to the side of the cyst by a short umbilical\r\ncord; nor did the fetus make its appearance until the boy was eight or\r\nten years old, when after much enlargement of pregnancy and subsequent\r\nflooding the boy died.\" The fetus, removed after death, on the whole\r\nnot very imperfectly formed, was of the size of about six or seven\r\nmonths' gestation. Bury cites an account of a child that had a second\r\nimperfectly developed fetus in its face and scalp. There was a boy by\r\nthe name of Bissieu who from the earliest age had a pain in one of his\r\nleft ribs; this rib was larger than the rest and seemed to have a tumor\r\nunder it. He died of phthisis at fourteen, and after death there was\r\nfound in a pocket lying against the transverse colon and communicating\r\nwith it all the evidences of a fetus.\r\n\r\nAt the Hopital de la Charite in Paris, Velpeau startled an audience of\r\n500 students and many physicians by saying that he expected to find a\r\nrudimentary fetus in a scrotal tumor placed in his hands for operation.\r\nHis diagnosis proved correct, and brought him resounding praise, and\r\nall wondered as to his reasons for expecting a fetal tumor. It appears\r\nthat he had read with care a report by Fatti of an operation on the\r\nscrotum of a child which had increased in size as the child grew, and\r\nwas found to contain the ribs, the vertebral column, the lower\r\nextremities as far as the knees, and the two orbits of a fetus; and\r\nalso an account of a similar operation performed by Wendt of Breslau on\r\na Silesian boy of seven. The left testicle in this case was so swollen\r\nthat it hung almost to the knee, and the fetal remains removed weighed\r\nseven ounces.\r\n\r\nSulikowski relates an instance of congenital fetation in the umbilicus\r\nof a girl of fourteen, who recovered after the removal of the anomaly.\r\nAretaeos described to the members of the medical fraternity in Athens\r\nthe case of a woman of twenty-two, who bore two children after a seven\r\nmonths' pregnancy. One was very rudimentary and only 21 inches long,\r\nand the other had an enormous head resembling a case of hydrocephalus.\r\nOn opening the head of the second fetus, another, three inches long,\r\nwas found in the medulla oblongata, and in the cranial cavity with it\r\nwere two additional fetuses, neither of which was perfectly formed.\r\n\r\nBroca speaks of a fetal cyst being passed in the urine of a man of\r\nsixty-one; the cyst contained remnants of hair, bone, and cartilage.\r\nAtlee submits quite a remarkable case of congenital ventral gestation,\r\nthe subject being a girl of six, who recovered after the discharge of\r\nthe fetal mass from the abdomen. McIntyre speaks of a child of eleven,\r\nplaying about and feeling well, but whose abdomen progressively\r\nincreased in size 1 1/2 inches each day. After ten days there was a\r\nlarge fluctuating mass on the right side; the abdomen was opened and\r\nthe mass enucleated; it was found to contain a fetal mass weighing\r\nnearly five pounds, and in addition ten pounds of fluid were removed.\r\nThe child made an early recovery. Rogers mentions a fetus that was\r\nfound in a man's bladder. Bouchacourt reports the successful\r\nextirpation of the remains of a fetus from the rectum of a child of\r\nsix. Miner describes a successful excision of a congenital gestation.\r\n\r\nModern literature is full of examples, and nearly every one of the\r\nforegoing instances could be paralleled from other sources.  Rodriguez\r\nis quoted as reporting that in July, 1891, several newspapers in the\r\ncity of Mexico published, under the head of \"A Man-mother,\" a wonderful\r\nstory, accompanied by wood-cuts, of a young man from whose body a great\r\nsurgeon had extracted a \"perfectly developed fetus.\" One of these\r\nwood-cuts represented a tumor at the back of a man opened and\r\ncontaining a crying baby.  In commenting upon this, after reviewing\r\nseveral similar cases of endocymian monsters that came under his\r\nobservation in Mexico, Rodriguez tells what the case which had been so\r\ngrossly exaggerated by the lay journals really was: An Indian boy, aged\r\ntwenty-two, presented a tumor in the sacrococcygeal region measuring 53\r\ncm. in circumference at the base, having a vertical diameter of 17 cm.\r\nand a transverse diameter of 13 cm. It had no pedicle and was fixed,\r\nshowing unequal consistency. At birth this tumor was about the size of\r\na pigeon's egg. A diagnosis of dermoid cyst was made and two operations\r\nwere performed on the boy, death following the second. The skeleton\r\nshowed interesting conditions; the rectum and pelvic organs were\r\nnatural, and the contents of the cyst verified the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nQuite similar to the cases of fetus in fetu are the instances of\r\ndermoid cysts. For many years they have been a mystery to\r\nphysiologists, and their origin now is little more than hypothetic. At\r\none time the fact of finding such a formation in the ovary of an\r\nunmarried woman was presumptive evidence that she was unchaste; but\r\nthis idea was dissipated as soon as examples were reported in children,\r\nand to-day we have a well-defined difference between congenital and\r\nextrauterine pregnancy. Dermoid cysts of the ovary may consist only of\r\na wall of connective tissue lined with epidermis and containing\r\ndistinctly epidermic scales which, however, may be rolled up in firm\r\nmasses of a more or less soapy consistency; this variety is called by\r\nOrth epidermoid cyst; or, according to Warren, a form of cyst made up\r\nof skin containing small and ill-defined papillae, but rich in hair\r\nfollicles and sebaceous glands. Even the erector pili muscle and the\r\nsudoriparous gland are often found. The hair is partly free and rolled\r\nup into thick balls or is still attached to the walls. A large mass of\r\nsebaceous material is also found in these cysts. Thomson reports a case\r\nof dermoid cyst of the bladder containing hair, which cyst he removed.\r\nIt was a pedunculated growth, and it was undoubtedly vesical and not\r\nexpelled from some ovarian source through the urinary passage, as\r\nsometimes occurs.\r\n\r\nThe simpler forms of the ordinary dermoid cysts contain bone and teeth.\r\nThe complicated teratoma of this class may contain, in addition to the\r\npreviously mentioned structures, cartilage and glands, mucous and\r\nserous membrane, muscle, nerves, and cerebral substance, portions of\r\neyes, fingers with nails, mammae, etc.  Figure 64 represents a cyst\r\ncontaining long red hair that was removed from a blonde woman aged\r\nforty-four years who had given birth to six children. Cullingworth\r\nreports the history of a woman in whom both ovaries were apparently\r\ninvolved by dermoids, who had given birth to 12 children and had three\r\nmiscarriages--the last, three months before the removal of the growths.\r\nThe accompanying illustration, taken from Baldy, pictures a dermoid\r\ncyst of the complicated variety laid open and exposing the contents in\r\nsitu. Mears of Philadelphia reports a case of ovarian cyst removed from\r\na girl of six and a half by Bradford of Kentucky in 1875. From this age\r\non to adult life many similar cases are recorded. Nearly every medical\r\nmuseum has preserved specimens of dermoid cysts, and almost all\r\nphysicians are well acquainted with their occurrence. The curious\r\nformations and contents and the bizarre shapes are of great variety.\r\nGraves mentions a dermoid cyst containing the left side of a human\r\nface, an eye, a molar tooth, and various bones. Dermoid cysts are found\r\nalso in regions of the body quite remote from the ovary. The so-called\r\n\"orbital wens\" are true inclusion of the skin of a congenital origin,\r\nas are the nasal dermoids and some of the cysts of the neck.\r\n\r\nWeil reported the case of a man of twenty-two years who was born with\r\nwhat was supposed to be a spina bifida in the lower sacral region.\r\nAccording to Senn, the swelling never caused any pain or inconvenience\r\nuntil it inflamed, when it opened spontaneously and suppurated,\r\ndischarging a large quantity of offensive pus, hair, and sebaceous\r\nmaterial, thus proving it to have been a dermoid.  The cyst was freely\r\nincised, and there were found numerous openings of sweat glands, from\r\nwhich drops of perspiration escaped when the patient was sweating.\r\n\r\nDermoid cysts of the thorax are rare. Bramann reported a case in which\r\na dermoid cyst of small size was situated over the sternum at the\r\njunction of the manubrium with the gladiolus, and a similar cyst in the\r\nneck near the left cornu of the hyoid bone.  Chitten removed a dermoid\r\nfrom the sternum of a female of thirty-nine, the cyst containing 11\r\nounces of atheromatous material. In the Museum of St. Bartholomew's\r\nHospital in London there is a congenital tumor which was removed from\r\nthe anterior mediastinum of a woman of twenty one, and contained\r\nportions of skin, fat, sebaceous material, and two pieces of bone\r\nsimilar to the superior maxilla, and in which several teeth were found.\r\nDermoids are found in the palate and pharynx, and open dermoids of the\r\nconjunctiva are classified by Sutton with the moles.  According to\r\nSenn, Barker collected sixteen dermoid tumors of the tongue. Bryk\r\nsuccessfully removed a tumor of this nature the size of a fist.\r\nWellington Gray removed an enormous lingual dermoid from the mouth of a\r\nnegro. It contained 40 ounces of atheromatous material. Dermoids of the\r\nrectum are reported. Duyse reports the history of a case of labor\r\nduring which a rectal dermoid was expelled. The dermoid contained a\r\ncerebral vesicle, a rudimentary eye, a canine and a molar tooth, and a\r\npiece of bone. There is little doubt that many cases of fetus in fetu\r\nreported were really dermoids of the scrotum.\r\n\r\nWard reports the successful removal of a dermoid cyst weighing 30\r\npounds from a woman of thirty-two, the mother of two children aged ten\r\nand twelve, respectively. The report is briefly as follows: \"The\r\npatient has always been in good health until within the last year,\r\nduring which time she has lost flesh and strength quite rapidly, and\r\nwhen brought to my hospital by her physician, Dr. James of\r\nWilliamsburg, Kansas, was quite weak, although able to walk about the\r\nhouse. A tumor had been growing for a number of years, but its growth\r\nwas so gradual that the patient had not considered her condition\r\ncritical until quite recently. The tumor was diagnosed to be cystoma of\r\nthe left ovary. Upon opening the sac with the trocar we were confronted\r\nby complications entirely unlooked for, and its use had to be abandoned\r\nentirely because the thick contents of the cyst would not flow freely,\r\nand the presence of sebaceous matter blocked the instrument. As much of\r\nthe fluid as possible was removed, and the abdominal incision was\r\nenlarged to allow of the removal of the large tumor. An ovarian\r\nhematoma the size of a large orange was removed from the right side. We\r\nwashed the intestines quite as one would wash linen, since some of the\r\ncontents of the cyst had escaped into the abdominal cavity. The abdomen\r\nwas closed without drainage, and the patient placed in bed without\r\nexperiencing the least shock.  Her recovery was rapid and uneventful.\r\nShe returned to her home in four weeks after the operation.\r\n\r\n\"The unusual feature in this case was the nature of the contents of the\r\nsac. There was a large quantity of long straight hair growing from the\r\ncyst wall and an equal amount of loose hair in short pieces floating\r\nthrough the tumor-contents, a portion of which formed nuclei for what\r\nwere called 'moth-balls,' of which there were about 1 1/2 gallons.\r\nThese balls, or marbles, varied from the size of moth-balls, as\r\nmanufactured and sold by druggists, to that of small walnuts. They\r\nseemed to be composed of sebaceous matter, and were evidently formed\r\naround the short hairs by the motion of the fluid produced by walking\r\nor riding.  There was some tissue resembling true skin attached to the\r\ninner wall of the sac.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several cases of multiple dermoid cysts on record, and they\r\nmay occur all over the body. Jamieson reports a case in which there\r\nwere 250, and in Maclaren's case there were 132.  According to Crocker,\r\nHebra and Rayer also each had a case. In a case of Sangster, reported\r\nby Politzer, although most of the dermoids, as usual, were like\r\nfibroma-nodules and therefore the color of normal skin, those over the\r\nmastoid processes and clavicle were lemon-yellow, and were generally\r\nthought to be xanthoma until they were excised, and Politzer found they\r\nwere typical dermoid cysts with the usual contents of degenerated\r\nepithelium and hair.\r\n\r\nHermaphroditism.--Some writers claim that Adam was the first\r\nhermaphrodite and support this by Scriptural evidence. We find in some\r\nof the ancient poets traces of an Egyptian legend in which the goddess\r\nof the moon was considered to be both male and female. From mythology\r\nwe learn that Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes, or Mercury, and\r\nVenus Aphrodite, and had the powers both of a father and mother. In\r\nspeaking of the foregoing Ausonius writes, \"Cujus erat facies in qua\r\npaterque materque cognosci possint, nomen traxit ab illis.\" Ovid and\r\nVirgil both refer to legendary hermaphrodites, and the knowledge of\r\ntheir existence was prevalent in the olden times. The ancients\r\nconsidered the birth of hermaphrodites bad omens, and the Athenians\r\nthrew them into the sea, the Romans, into the Tiber.  Livy speaks of an\r\nhermaphrodite being put to death in Umbria, and another in Etruria.\r\nCicero, Aristotle, Strabonius, and Pliny all speak concerning this\r\nsubject. Martial and Tertullian noticed this anomaly among the Romans.\r\nAetius and Paulus Aegineta speak of females in Egypt with prolonged\r\nclitorides which made them appear like hermaphrodites. Throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages we frequently find accounts, naturally exaggerated, of\r\ndouble-sexed creatures. Harvey, Bartholinus, Paullini, Schenck, Wolff,\r\nWrisberg, Zacchias, Marcellus Donatus, Haller, Hufeland, de Graff, and\r\nmany others discuss hermaphroditism. Many classifications have been\r\ngiven, as, e.g., real and apparent; masculine, feminine, or neuter;\r\nhorizontal and vertical; unilateral and bilateral, etc. The anomaly in\r\nmost cases consists of a malformation of the external genitalia. A\r\nprolonged clitoris, prolapsed ovaries, grossness of figure, and hirsute\r\nappearance have been accountable for many supposed instances of\r\nhermaphrodites. On the other hand, a cleft scrotum, an ill-developed\r\npenis, perhaps hypospadias or epispadias, rotundity of the mammae, and\r\nfeminine contour have also provoked accounts of similar instances. Some\r\ncases have been proved by dissection to have been true hermaphrodites,\r\nportions or even entire genitalia of both sexes having been found.\r\n\r\nNumerous accounts, many mythical, but always interesting, are given of\r\nthese curious persons. They have been accredited with having performed\r\nthe functions of both father and mother, notwithstanding the statements\r\nof some of the best authorities that they are always sterile.\r\nObservation has shown that the sexual appetite diminishes in proportion\r\nto the imperfections in the genitalia, and certainly many of these\r\npersons are sexually indifferent.\r\n\r\nWe give descriptions of a few of the most famous or interesting\r\ninstances of hermaphroditism. Pare speaks of a woman who, besides a\r\nvulva, from which she menstruated, had a penis, but without prepuce or\r\nsigns of erectility. Haller alludes to several cases in which prolonged\r\nclitorides have been the cause of the anomaly.  In commenting on this\r\nform of hermaphroditism Albucasiusus describes a necessary operation\r\nfor the removal of the clitoris.\r\n\r\nColumbus relates the history of an Ethiopian woman who was evidently a\r\nspurious female hermaphrodite. The poor wretch entreated him to cut off\r\nher penis, an enlarged clitoris, which she said was an intolerable\r\nhindrance to her in coitus. De Graff and Riolan describe similar cases.\r\nThere is an old record of a similar creature, supposing herself to be a\r\nmale, who took a wife, but previously having had connection with a man,\r\nthe outcome of which was pregnancy, was shortly after marriage\r\ndelivered of a daughter. There is an account of a person in Germany\r\nwho, for the first thirty years of life, was regarded as feminine, and\r\nbeing of loose morals became a mother. At a certain period she began to\r\nfeel a change in her sexual inclinations; she married and became the\r\nfather of a family. This is doubtless a distortion of the facts of the\r\ncase of Catherine or Charles Hoffman, born in 1824, and who was\r\nconsidered a female until the age of forty. At puberty she had the\r\ninstincts of a woman, and cohabitated with a male lover for twenty\r\nyears. Her breasts were well formed and she menstruated at nineteen. At\r\nthe age of forty-six her sexual desires changed, and she attempted\r\ncoitus as a man, with such evident satisfaction that she married a\r\nwoman soon afterward. Fitch speaks of a house-servant with masculine\r\nfeatures and movements, aged twenty-eight, and 5 feet and 9 inches\r\ntall, who was arrested by the police for violating the laws governing\r\nprostitution. On examination, well-developed male and female organs of\r\ngeneration were found. The labia majora were normal and flattened on\r\nthe anterior surface. The labia minora and hymen were absent. The\r\nvagina was spacious and the woman had a profuse leukorrhea. She stated\r\nthat several years previously she gave birth to a normal child. In\r\nplace of a clitoris she had a penis which, in erection, measured 5 1/4\r\ninches long and 3 5/8 inches in circumference. The glans penis and the\r\nurethra were perfectly formed. The scrotum contained two testicles,\r\neach about an inch long; the mons veneris was sparsely covered with\r\nstraight, black hair. She claimed functional ability with both sets of\r\ngenitalia, and said she experienced equal sexual gratification with\r\neither. Semen issued from the penis, and every three weeks she had\r\nscanty menstruation, which lasted but two days.\r\n\r\nBeclard showed Marie-Madeline Lefort, nineteen years of age, 1 1/2\r\nmeters in height. Her mammae were well developed, her nipples erectile\r\nand surrounded by a brown areola, from which issued several hairs. Her\r\nfeet were small, her pelvis large, and her thighs like those of a\r\nwoman. Projecting from the vulva was a body looking like a penis 7 cm.\r\nlong and slightly erectile at times; it was imperforate and had a\r\nmobile prepuce. She had a vulva with two well-shaped labia as shown by\r\nthe accompanying illustration. She menstruated slightly and had an\r\nopening at the root of the clitoris. The parotid region showed signs of\r\na beard and she had hair on her upper lip. On August 20, 1864, a person\r\ncame into the Hotel-Dieu, asking treatment for chronic pleurisy.  He\r\nsaid his age was sixty-five, and he pursued the calling of a\r\nmountebank, but remarked that in early life he had been taken for a\r\nwoman. He had menstruated at eight and had been examined by doctors at\r\nsixteen. The menstruation continued until 1848, and at its cessation he\r\nexperienced the feelings of a male. At this time he presented the\r\nvenerable appearance of a long-bearded old man.  At the autopsy, about\r\ntwo months later, all the essentials of a female were delineated. A\r\nFallopian tube, ovaries, uterus, and round ligaments were found, and a\r\ndrawing in cross-section of the parts was made. There is no doubt but\r\nthat this individual was Marie-Madeline Lefort in age.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorbe speaks of a person who was supposed to be feminine for twenty-two\r\nyears. At the age of sixteen she loved a farmer's son, but the union\r\nwas delayed for some reason, and three years later her grace faded and\r\nshe became masculine in her looks and tastes.  It was only after\r\nlengthy discussion, in which the court took part, that it was\r\ndefinitely settled that this person was a male.\r\n\r\nAdelaide Preville, who was married as a female, and as such lived the\r\nlast ten years of her life in France, was found on dissection at the\r\nHotel-Dieu to be a man. A man was spoken of in both France and Germany\r\na who passed for many years as a female. He had a cleft scrotum and\r\nhypospadias, which caused the deception.  Sleeping with another servant\r\nfor three years, he constantly had sexual congress with her during this\r\nperiod, and finally impregnated her. It was supposed in this case that\r\nthe posterior wall of the vagina supplied the deficiency of the lower\r\nboundary of the urethra, forming a complete channel for the semen to\r\nproceed through. Long ago in Scotland a servant was condemned to death\r\nby burial alive for impregnating his master's daughter while in the\r\nguise and habit of a woman. He had always been considered a woman. We\r\nhave heard of a recent trustworthy account of a pregnancy and delivery\r\nin a girl who had been impregnated by a bed-fellow who on examination\r\nproved to be a male pseudohermaphrodite.\r\n\r\nFournier speaks of an individual in Lisbon in 1807 who was in the\r\nhighest degree graceful, the voice feminine, the mammae well developed,\r\nThe female genitalia were normal except the labia majora, which were\r\nrather diminutive. The thighs and the pelvis.  were not so wide as\r\nthose of a woman. There was some beard on the chin, but it was worn\r\nclose. the male genitalia were of the size and appearance of a male\r\nadult and were covered with the usual hair. This person had been twice\r\npregnant and aborted at the third and fifth month. During coitus the\r\npenis became erect, etc.\r\n\r\nSchrell describes a case in which, independent of the true penis and\r\ntesticles, which were well formed, there existed a small vulva\r\nfurnished with labia and nymphae, communicating with a rudimentary\r\nuterus provided with round ligaments and imperfectly developed ovaries.\r\nSchrell remarks that in this case we must notice that the female\r\ngenitalia were imperfectly developed, and adds that perfect\r\nhermaphroditism is a physical impossibility without great alterations\r\nof the natural connections of the bones and other parts of the pelvis.\r\nCooper describes a woman with an enormous development of the clitoris,\r\nan imperforate uterus, and absence of vagina; at first sight of the\r\nparts they appeared to be those of a man.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Hugier succeeded in restoring a vagina to a young girl of\r\ntwenty who had an hypertrophied clitoris and no signs of a vagina. The\r\naccompanying illustrations show the conformation of the parts before\r\noperation with all the appearance of ill-developed male genitalia, and\r\nthe appearance afterward with restitution of the vaginal opening.\r\n\r\nVirchow in 1872, Boddaert in 1875, and Marchand in 1883 report cases of\r\nduplication of the genitalia, and call their cases true hermaphrodites\r\nfrom an anatomic standpoint. There is a specimen in St. Bartholomew's\r\nHospital in London from a man of forty-four, who died of cerebral\r\nhemorrhage. He was well formed and had a beard and a full-sized penis.\r\nHe was married, and it was stated that his wife had two children. The\r\nbladder and the internal organs of generation were those of a man in\r\nwhom neither testis had descended into the scrotum, and in whom the\r\nuterus masculinus and vagina were developed to an unusual degree. The\r\nuterus, nearly as large as in the adult female, lay between the bladder\r\nand rectum, and was enclosed between two layers of peritoneum, to\r\nwhich, on either side of the uterus, were attached the testes.  There\r\nwas also shown in London the pelvic organs from a case of complex or\r\nvertical hermaphroditism occurring in a child of nine months who died\r\nfrom the effects of an operation for the radical cure of a right\r\ninguinal hernia. The external organs were those of a male with\r\nundescended testes. The bladder was normal and its neck was surrounded\r\nby a prostate gland. Projecting backward were a vagina, uterus, and\r\nbroad ligaments, round ligaments, and Fallopian tubes, with the testes\r\nin the position of the ovaries.  There were no seminal vesicles. The\r\nchild died eleven days after the operation. The family history states\r\nthat the mother had had 14 children and eight miscarriages. Seven of\r\nthe children were dead and showed no abnormalities. The fifth and sixth\r\nchildren were boys and had the same sexual arrangement.\r\n\r\nBarnes, Chalmers, Sippel, and Litten describe cases of spurious\r\nhermaphroditism due to elongation of the clitoris. In Litten's case a\r\nthe clitoris was 3 1/2 inches long, and there was hydrocele of the\r\nprocessus vaginalis on both sides, making tumors in the labium on one\r\nside and the inguinal canal on the other, which had been diagnosed as\r\ntesticles and again as ovaries. There was associate cystic ovarian\r\ndisease. Plate 4 is taken from a case of false external bilateral\r\nhermaphroditism. Phillips mentions four cases of spurious\r\nhermaphroditism in one family, and recently Pozzi tells of a family of\r\nnine individuals in whom this anomaly was observed. The first was alive\r\nand had four children; the second was christened a female but was\r\nprobably a male; the third, fourth, and fifth were normal but died\r\nyoung; the sixth daughter was choreic and feeble-minded, aged\r\ntwenty-nine, and had one illegitimate child; the seventh, a boy, was\r\nhealthy and married; the eighth was christened a female, but when\r\nseventeen was declared by the Faculty to be a male; the ninth was\r\nchristened a female, but at eighteen the genitals were found to be\r\nthose of a male, though the mammae were well developed.\r\n\r\nO'Neill speaks of a case in which the clitoris was five inches long and\r\none inch thick, having a groove in its inferior surface reaching down\r\nto an oblique opening in the perineum. The scrotum contained two hard\r\nbodies thought to be testicles, and the general appearance was that of\r\nhypospadias. Postmortem a complete set of female genitalia was found,\r\nalthough the ovaries were very small. The right round ligament was\r\nexceedingly thick and reached down to the bottom of the false scrotum,\r\nwhere it was firmly attached. The hard bodies proved to be on one side\r\nan irreducible omental hernia, probably congenital, and on the other a\r\nhardened mass having no glandular structure. The patient was an adult.\r\nAs we have seen, there seems to be a law of evolution in\r\nhermaphroditism which prevents perfection. If one set of genitalia are\r\nextraordinarily developed, the other set are correspondingly atrophied.\r\nIn the case of extreme development of the clitoris and approximation to\r\nthe male type we must expect to find imperfectly developed uterus or\r\novaries. This would answer for one of the causes of sterility in these\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThere is a type of hermaphroditism in which the sex cannot be\r\ndefinitely declared, and sometimes dissection does not definitely\r\nindicate the predominating sex. Such cases are classed under the head\r\nof neuter hermaphrodites, possibly an analogy of the \"genus epicoenum\"\r\nof Quintilian. Marie Dorothee, of the age of twenty-three, was examined\r\nand declared a girl by Hufeland and Mursina, while Stark, Raschig, and\r\nMartens maintained that she was a boy. This formidable array of talent\r\non both sides provoked much discussion in contemporary publications,\r\nand the case attracted much notice. Marc saw her in 1803, at which time\r\nshe carried contradicting certificates as to her sex. He found an\r\nimperforate penis, and on the inferior face near the root an opening\r\nfor the passage of urine. No traces of nymphae, vagina, testicles, nor\r\nbeard were seen. The stature was small, the form debilitated, and the\r\nvoice effeminate. Marc came to the conclusion that it was impossible\r\nfor any man to determine either one sex or the other. Everard Home\r\ndissected a dog with apparent external organs of the female, but\r\ndiscovered that neither sex was sufficiently pronounced to admit of\r\nclassification. Home also saw at the Royal Marine Hospital at Plymouth,\r\nin 1779, a marine who some days after admission was reported to be a\r\ngirl. On examination Home found him to possess a weak voice, soft skin,\r\nvoluminous breasts, little beard, and the thighs and legs of a woman.\r\nThere was fat on the pubis, the penis was short and small and incapable\r\nof erection, the testicles of fetal size; he had no venereal desires\r\nwhatever, and as regards sex was virtually neuter.\r\n\r\nThe legal aspect of hermaphroditism has always been much discussed.\r\nMany interesting questions arise, and extraordinary complications\r\nnaturally occur. In Rome a hermaphrodite could be a witness to a\r\ntestament, the exclusive privilege of a man, and the sex was settled by\r\nthe predominance. If the male aspect and traits together with the\r\ngenerative organs of man were most pronounced, then the individual\r\ncould call himself a man.  \"Hermaphroditus an ad testamentum adhiberi\r\npossit qualitas sesus incalescentis ostendit.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar case on record in which the question of legal male\r\ninheritance was not settled until the individual had lived as a female\r\nfor fifty-one years. This person was married when twenty-one, but\r\nfinding coitus impossible, separated after ten years, and though\r\ndressing as a female had coitus with other women. She finally lived\r\nwith her brother, with whom she eventually came to blows. She\r\nprosecuted him for assault, and the brother in return charged her with\r\nseducing his wife. Examination ensued, and at this ripe age she was\r\ndeclared to be a male.\r\n\r\nThe literature on hermaphroditism is so extensive that it is impossible\r\nto select a proper representation of the interesting cases in this\r\nlimited space, and the reader is referred to the modern French works on\r\nthis subject, in which the material is exhaustive and the discussion\r\nthoroughly scientific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMINOR TERATA.\r\n\r\nAncient Ideas Relative to Minor Terata.--The ancients viewed with great\r\ninterest the minor structural anomalies of man, and held them to be\r\ndivine signs or warnings in much the same manner as they considered\r\nmore pronounced monstrosities. In a most interesting and instructive\r\narticle, Ballantyne quotes Ragozin in saying that the\r\nChaldeo-Babylonians, in addition to their other numerous subdivisions\r\nof divination, drew presages and omens for good or evil from the\r\nappearance of the liver, bowels, and viscera of animals offered for\r\nsacrifice and opened for inspection, and from the natural defects or\r\nmonstrosities of babies or the young of animals. Ballantyne names this\r\nlatter subdivision of divination fetomancy or teratoscopy, and thus\r\nrenders a special chapter as to omens derived from monstrous births,\r\ngiven by Lenormant:--\r\n\r\n\"The prognostics which the Chaldeans claimed to draw from monstrous\r\nbirths in man and the animals are worthy of forming a class by\r\nthemselves, insomuch the more as it is the part of their divinatory\r\nscience with which, up to the present time, we are best acquainted. The\r\ndevelopment that their astrology had given to 'genethliaque,' or the\r\nart of horoscopes of births, had led them early to attribute great\r\nimportance to all the teratologic facts which were there produced. They\r\nclaimed that an experience of 470,000 years of observations, all\r\nconcordant, fully justified their system, and that in nothing was the\r\ninfluence of the stars marked in a more indubitable manner than in the\r\nfatal law which determined the destiny of each individual according to\r\nthe state of the sky at the moment when he came into the world. Cicero,\r\nby the very terms which he uses to refute the Chaldeans, shows that the\r\nresult of these ideas was to consider all infirmities and monstrosities\r\nthat new-born infants exhibited as the inevitable and irremediable\r\nconsequence of the action of these astral positions. This being\r\ngranted, the observation of similar monstrosities gave, as it were, a\r\nreflection of the state of the sky; on which depended all terrestrial\r\nthings; consequently, one might read in them the future with as much\r\ncertainty as in the stars themselves. For this reason the greatest\r\npossible importance was attached to the teratologic auguries which\r\noccupy so much space in the fragments of the great treatise on\r\nterrestrial presages which have up to the present time been published.\"\r\n\r\nThe rendering into English of the account of 62 teratologic cases in\r\nthe human subject with the prophetic meanings attached to them by\r\nChaldean diviners, after the translation of Opport, is given as follows\r\nby Ballantyne, some of the words being untranslatable:--\r\n\r\n\"When a woman gives birth to an infant--\r\n\r\n(1) that has the ears of a lion, there will be a powerful king in the\r\ncountry;\r\n\r\n(2) that wants the right ear, the days of the master (king) will be\r\nprolonged (reach old age);\r\n\r\n(3) that wants both ears, there will be mourning in the country, and\r\nthe country will be lessened (diminished);\r\n\r\n(4) whose right ear is small, the house of the man (in whose house the\r\nbirth took place) will be destroyed;\r\n\r\n(5) whose ears are both small, the house of the man will be built of\r\nbricks;\r\n\r\n(6) whose right ear is mudissu tehaat (monstrous), there will be an\r\nandrogyne in the house of the new-born\r\n\r\n(7) whose ears are both mudissu (deformed), the country will perish and\r\nthe enemy rejoice;\r\n\r\n(8) whose right ear is round, there will be an androgyne in the house\r\nof the new-born;\r\n\r\n(9) whose right ear has a wound below, and tur re ut of the man, the\r\nhouse will be estroyed;\r\n\r\n(10) that has two ears on the right side and none on the left, the gods\r\nwill bring about a stable reign, the country will flourish, and it will\r\nbe a land of repose;\r\n\r\n(11) whose ears are both closed, sa a au;\r\n\r\n(12) that has a bird's beak, the country will be peaceful;\r\n\r\n(13) that has no mouth, the mistress of the house will die;\r\n\r\n(14) that has no right nostril, the people of the world will be injured;\r\n\r\n(15) whose nostrils are absent, the country will be in affliction, and\r\nthe house of the man will be ruined;\r\n\r\n(16) whose jaws are absent, the days of the master (king) will be\r\nprolonged, but the house (where the infant is born) will be ruined.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman gives birth to an infant--\r\n\r\n(17) that has no lower jaw, mut ta at mat, the name will not be effaced;\r\n\r\n(20) that has no nose, affliction will seize upon the country, and the\r\nmaster of the house will die;\r\n\r\n(21) that has neither nose nor virile member (penis), the army of the\r\nking will be strong, peace will be in the land, the men of the king\r\nwill be sheltered from evil influences, and Lilit (a female demon)\r\nshall not have power over them;\r\n\r\n(22) whose upper lip overrides the lower, the people of the world will\r\nrejoice (or good augury for the troops);\r\n\r\n(23) that has no lips, affliction will seize upon the land, and the\r\nhouse of the man will be destroyed;\r\n\r\n(24) whose tongue is kuri aat, the man will be spared (?);\r\n\r\n(25) that has no right hand, the country will be convulsed by an\r\nearthquake;\r\n\r\n(26) that has no fingers, the town will have no births, the bar shall\r\nbe lost;\r\n\r\n(27) that has no fingers on the right side, the master (king) will not\r\npardon his adversary (or shall be humiliated by his enemies);\r\n\r\n(28) that has six fingers on the right side, the man will take the\r\nlukunu of the house;\r\n\r\n(29) that has six very small toes on both feet, he shall not go to the\r\nlukunu;\r\n\r\n(30) that has six toes on each foot, the people of the world will be\r\ninjured (calamity to the troops);\r\n\r\n(31) that has the heart open and that has no skin, the country will\r\nsuffer from calamities;\r\n\r\n(32) that has no penis, the master of the house will be enriched by the\r\nharvest of his field;\r\n\r\n(33) that wants the penis and the umbilicus, there will be ill-will in\r\nthe house, the woman (wife) will have an overbearing eye (be haughty);\r\nbut the male descent of the palace will be more extended.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman gives birth to an infant--\r\n\r\n(34) that has no well-marked sex, calamity and affliction will seize\r\nupon the land;

The absence of\r\none or both ears (Nos. 2 and 3) has been noted in recent times by\r\nVirchow (Archiv fur path. Anat. xxx., p.  221), Gradenigo (Taruffi's\r\n'Storia della Teratologia,' vi., p.  552), and others. Generally some\r\ncartilaginous remnant is found, but on this point the Chaldean record\r\nis silent. Variations in the size of the ears (Nos. 4 and 5) are well\r\nknown at the present time, and have been discussed at length by Binder\r\n(Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten, xx., 1887) and others.\r\nThe exact malformation indicated in Nos. 6 and 7 is, of course, not to\r\nbe determined, although further researches in Assyriology may clear up\r\nthis point. The 'round ear' (No. 8) is one of Binder's types, and that\r\nwith a 'wound below' (No. 9) probably refers to a case of fistula auris\r\ncongenita (Toynbee, 'Diseases of the Ear,' 1860). The instance of an\r\ninfant born with two ears on the right side (No. 10) was doubtless one\r\nof cervical auricle or preauricular appendage, whilst closure of the\r\nexternal auditory meatus (No. 11) is a well-known deformity.\r\n\r\n\"The next thirteen cases (Nos. 12-24) were instances of anomalies of\r\nthe mouth and nose. The 'bird's beak' (No. 12) may have been a markedly\r\naquiline nose; No. 13 was a case of astoma; and Nos. 14 and 15 were\r\ninstances of stenosis or atresia of the anterior nares. Fetuses with\r\nabsence of the maxillae (Nos. 16 and 17) are in modern terminology\r\ncalled agnathous. Deformities like that existing in Nos. 20 and 21 have\r\nbeen observed in paracephalic and cyclopic fetuses. The coincident\r\nabsence of nose and penis (No.  21) is interesting, especially when\r\ntaken in conjunction with the popular belief that the size of the\r\nformer organ varies with that of the latter. Enlargement of the upper\r\nlip (No. 22), called epimacrochelia by Taruffi, and absence of the lips\r\n(No. 23), known now under the name of brachychelia, have been not\r\nunfrequently noticed in recent times. The next six cases (Nos.  25-30)\r\nwere instances of malformations of the upper limb: Nos.  25, 26. and 27\r\nwere probably instances of the so-called spontaneous or intrauterine\r\namputation; and Nos. 28, 29, and 30 were examples of the comparatively\r\ncommon deformity known as polydactyly. No. 31 was probably a case of\r\nectopia cordis.\r\n\r\n\"Then follow five instances of genital abnormalities (Nos.  32-36),\r\nconsisting of absence of the penis (epispadias?), absence of penis and\r\numbilicus (epispadias and exomphalos?), hermaphroditism, imperforate\r\nanus, and nondescent of one testicle. The nine following cases (Nos.\r\n37-45) were anomalies of the lower limbs: Nos. 37, 38, and 42 may have\r\nbeen spontaneous amputations; Nos. 39 and 40 were doubtless instances\r\nof webbed toes (syndactyly), and the deformity indicated in No. 45 was\r\npresumably talipes equinus. The infant born with three feet (No.  43)\r\nwas possibly a case of parasitic monstrosity, several of which have\r\nbeen reported in recent teratologic literature; but what is meant by\r\nthe statement concerning 'male and female legs' it is not easy to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\n\"Certain of the ten following prodigies (Nos. 46-55) cannot in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge be identified. The presence of\r\ncongenital patches of white or gray hair on the scalp, as recorded in\r\nNo. 46, is not an unknown occurrence at the present time; but what the\r\nChaldeans meant by ipga, pinde, hali riksi, and kali on the head of the\r\nnew-born infant it is impossible to tell. The guess may be hazarded\r\nthat cephalhematoma, hydrocephalus, meningocele, nevi, or an excessive\r\namount of vernix caseosa were the conditions indicated, but a wider\r\nacquaintance with the meaning of the cuneiform characters is necessary\r\nbefore any certain identification is possible. The 'pieces of skin\r\nhanging from the head' (No. 51) may have been fragments of the\r\nmembranes; but there is nothing in the accompanying prediction to help\r\nus to trace the origin of the popular belief in the good luck following\r\nthe baby born with a caul. If No. 53 was a case of congenital horns on\r\nthe head, it must be regarded as a unique example, unless, indeed, a\r\nform of fetal ichthyosis be indicated.\r\n\r\n\"The remaining observations (No. 56-62) refer to cases of congenital\r\nteeth (No. 56) to deformity of the ears (Nos. 60 and 61), and a horn\r\n(No. 62).\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these early times almost to the present day similar significance\r\nhas been attached to minor structural anomalies. In the following pages\r\nthe individual anomalies will be discussed separately and the most\r\ninteresting examples of each will be cited. It is manifestly evident\r\nthat the object of this chapter is to mention the most striking\r\ninstances of abnormism and to give accompanying descriptions of\r\nassociate points of interest, rather than to offer a scientific\r\nexposition of teratology, for which the reader is referred elsewhere.\r\n\r\nCongenital defect of the epidermis and true skin is a rarity in\r\npathology. Pastorello speaks of a child which lived for two and a half\r\nhours whose hands and feet were entirely destitute of epidermis; the\r\ntrue skin of those parts looked like that of a dead and already\r\nputrefying child. Hanks cites the history of a case of antepartum\r\ndesquamation of the skin in a living fetus.  Hochstetter describes a\r\nfull-term, living male fetus with cutaneous defect on both sides of the\r\nabdomen a little above the umbilicus. The placenta and membranes were\r\nnormal, a fact indicating that the defect was not due to amniotic\r\nadhesions; the child had a club-foot on the left side. The mother had a\r\nfall three weeks before labor.\r\n\r\nAbnormal Elasticity of the Skin.--In some instances the skin is affixed\r\nso loosely to the underlying tissues and is possessed of so great\r\nelasticity that it can be stretched almost to the same extent as India\r\nrubber. There have been individuals who could take the skin of the\r\nforehead and pull it down over the nose, or raise the skin of the neck\r\nover the mouth. They also occasionally have an associate muscular\r\ndevelopment in the subcutaneous tissues similar to the panniculus\r\nadiposus of quadrupeds, giving them preternatural motile power over the\r\nskin. The man recently exhibited under the title of the \"Elastic-Skin\r\nMan\" was an example of this anomaly. The first of this class of\r\nexhibitionists was seen in Buda-Pesth some years since and possessed\r\ngreat elasticity in the skin of his whole body; even his nose could be\r\nstretched. Figure 70 represents a photograph of an exhibitionist named\r\nFelix Wehrle, who besides having the power to stretch his skin could\r\nreadily bend his fingers backward and forward. The photograph was taken\r\nin January, 1888.\r\n\r\nIn these congenital cases there is loose attachment of the skin without\r\nhypertrophy, to which the term dermatolysis is restricted by Crocker.\r\nJob van Meekren, the celebrated Dutch physician of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, states that in 1657 a Spaniard, Georgius Albes, is reported to\r\nhave been able to draw the skin of the left pectoral region to the left\r\near, or the skin under the face over the chin to the vertex. The skin\r\nover the knee could be extended half a yard, and when it retracted to\r\nits normal position it was not in folds. Seiffert examined a case of\r\nthis nature in a young man of nineteen, and, contrary to Kopp's\r\nsupposition, found that in some skin from over the left second rib the\r\nelastic fibers were quite normal, but there was transformation of the\r\nconnective tissue of the dermis into an unformed tissue like a myxoma,\r\nwith total disappearance of the connective-tissue bundles. Laxity of\r\nthe skin after distention is often seen in multipara, both in the\r\nbreasts and in the abdominal walls, and also from obesity, but in all\r\nsuch cases the skin falls in folds, and does not have a normal\r\nappearance like that of the true \"elastic-skin man.\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally abnormal development of the scalp is noticed.  McDowall of\r\ntwenty-two. On each side of the median line of the head there were five\r\ndeep furrows, more curved and shorter as the distance from the median\r\nline increased. In the illustration the hair in the furrows is left\r\nlonger than that on the rest of the head. The patient was distinctly\r\nmicrocephalic and the right side of the body was markedly wasted. The\r\nfolds were due to hypertrophy of the muscles and scalp, and the same\r\nsort of furrowing is noticed when a dog \"pricks his ears.\" This case\r\nmay possibly be considered as an example of reversion to inferior\r\ntypes. Cowan records two cases of the foregoing nature in idiots.  The\r\nfirst case was a paralytic idiot of thirty-nine, whose cranial\r\ndevelopment was small in proportion to the size of the face and body;\r\nthe cranium was oxycephalic; the scalp was lax and redundant and the\r\nhair thin; there were 13 furrows, five on each side running\r\nanteroposteriorly, and three in the occipital region running\r\ntransversely. The occipitofrontalis muscle had no action on them. The\r\nsecond case was that of an idiot of forty-four of a more degraded type\r\nthan the previous one. The cranium was round and bullet-shaped and the\r\nhair generally thick. The scalp was not so lax as in the other case,\r\nbut the furrows were more crooked.  By tickling the scalp over the back\r\nof the neck the two median furrows involuntarily deepened.\r\n\r\nImpervious Skin.--There have been individuals who claimed that their\r\nskin was impervious to ordinary puncture, and from time to time these\r\nindividuals have appeared in some of the larger medical clinics of the\r\nworld for inspection. According to a recent number of the London\r\nGraphic, there is in Berlin a Singhalese who baffles all investigations\r\nby physicians by the impenetrability of his skin. The bronzed\r\nEasterner, a Hercules in shape, claims to have found an elixir which\r\nwill render the human skin impervious to any metal point or sharpened\r\nedge of a knife or dagger, and calls himself the \"Man with Iron Skin.\"\r\nHe is now exhibiting himself, and his greatest feat is to pass with his\r\nentire body through a hoop the inside of which is hardly big enough to\r\nadmit his body and is closely set with sharp knife-points, daggers,\r\nnails, and similar things. Through this hoop he squeezes his body with\r\nabsolute impunity. The physicians do not agree as to his immunity, and\r\nsome of them think that Rhannin, which is his name, is a fakir who has\r\nby long practice succeeded in hardening himself against the impressions\r\nof metal upon his skin. The professors of the Berlin clinic, however,\r\nconsidered it worth while to lecture about the man's skin, pronouncing\r\nit an inexplicable matter. This individual performed at the London\r\nAlhambra in the latter part of 1895. Besides climbing with bare feet a\r\nladder whose rungs were sharp-edged swords, and lying on a bed of nail\r\npoints with four men seated upon him, he curled himself up in a barrel,\r\nthrough whose inner edges nails projected, and was rolled about the\r\nstage at a rapid rate. Emerging from thence uninjured, he gracefully\r\nbows himself off the stage.\r\n\r\nSome individuals claim immunity from burns and show many interesting\r\nfeats in handling fire. As they are nothing but skilful \"fire jugglers\"\r\nthey deserve no mention here. The immunity of the participants in the\r\nsavage fire ceremonies will be discussed in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nAlbinism is characterized by the absolute or relative absence of\r\npigment of the skin, due to an arrest, insufficiency, or retardation of\r\nthis pigment. Following Trelat and Guinard, we may divide albinism into\r\ntwo classes,--general and partial.\r\n\r\nAs to the etiology of albinism, there is no known cause of the complete\r\nform. Heredity plays no part in the number of cases investigated by the\r\nauthors. D'Aube, by his observations on white rabbits, believes that\r\nthe influence of consanguinity is a marked factor in the production of\r\nalbinism; there are, however, many instances of heredity in this\r\nanomaly on record, and this idea is possibly in harmony with the\r\nmajority of observers.  Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire has noted that albinism\r\ncan also be a consequence of a pathologic condition having its origin\r\nin adverse surroundings, the circumstances of the parents, such as the\r\nwant of exercise, nourishment, light, etc.\r\n\r\nLesser knew a family in which six out of seven were albinos, and in\r\nsome tropical countries, such as Loango, Lower Guinea, it is said to be\r\nendemic. It is exceptional for the parents to be affected; but in a\r\ncase of Schlegel, quoted by Crocker, the grandfather was an albino, and\r\nMarey describes the case of the Cape May albinos, in which the mother\r\nand father were \"fair emblems of the African race,\" and of their\r\nchildren three were black and three were white, born in the following\r\norder: two consecutive black boys, two consecutive white girls, one\r\nblack girl, one white boy. Sym of Edinburgh relates the history of a\r\nfamily of seven children, who were alternately white and black.  All\r\nbut the seventh were living and in good health and mentally without\r\ndefect. The parents and other relatives were dark. Figure 73 portrays\r\nan albino family by the name of Cavalier who exhibited in Minneapolis\r\nin 1887.\r\n\r\nExamples of the total absence of pigment occur in all races, but\r\nparticularly is it interesting when seen in negroes who are found\r\nabsolutely white but preserving all the characteristics of their race,\r\nas, for instance, the kinky, woolly hair, flattened nose, thick lips,\r\netc. Rene Claille, in his \"Voyage a Tombouctou,\" says that he saw a\r\nwhite infant, the offspring of a negro and negress.  Its hair was\r\nwhite, its eyes blue, and its lashes flaxen. Its pupils were of a\r\nreddish color, and its physiognomy that of a Mandingo. He says such\r\ncases are not at all uncommon; they are really negro albinos. Thomas\r\nJefferson, in his \"History of Virginia,\" has an excellent description\r\nof these negroes, with their tremulous and weak eyes; he remarks that\r\nthey freckle easily. Buffon speaks of Ethiops with white twins, and\r\nsays that albinos are quite common in Africa, being generally of\r\ndelicate constitution, twinkling eyes, and of a low degree of\r\nintelligence; they are despised and ill-treated by the other negroes.\r\nPrichard, quoted by Sedgwick, speaks of a case of atavic transmission\r\nof albinism through the male line of the negro race.  The grandfather\r\nand the grandchild were albinos, the father being black. There is a\r\ncase of a brother and sister who were albinos, the parents being of\r\nordinary color but the grandfather an albino. Coinde, quoted by\r\nSedgwick, speaks of a man who, by two different wives, had three albino\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nA description of the ordinary type of albino would be as follows: The\r\nskin and hair are deprived of pigment; the eyebrows and eyelashes are\r\nof a brilliant white or are yellowish; the iris and the choroid are\r\nnearly or entirely deprived of coloring material, and in looking at the\r\neye we see a roseate zone and the ordinary pink pupil; from absence of\r\npigment they necessarily keep their eyes three-quarters closed, being\r\nphotophobic to a high degree.  They are amblyopic, and this is due\r\npartially to a high degree of ametropia (caused by crushing of the\r\neyeball in the endeavor to shut out light) and from retinal exhaustion\r\nand nystagmus. Many authors have claimed that they have little\r\nintelligence, but this opinion is not true. Ordinarily the reproductive\r\nfunctions are normal, and if we exclude the results of the union of two\r\nalbinos we may say that these individuals are fecund.\r\n\r\nPartial albinism is seen. The parts most often affected are the\r\ngenitals, the hair, the face, the top of the trunk, the nipple, the\r\nback of the hands and fingers. Folker reports the history of a case of\r\nan albino girl having pink eyes and red hair, the rest of the family\r\nhaving pink eyes and white hair. Partial albinism, necessarily\r\ncongenital, presenting a piebald appearance, must not be confounded\r\nwith leukoderma, which is rarely seen in the young and which will be\r\ndescribed later.\r\n\r\nAlbinism is found in the lower animals, and is exemplified ordinarily\r\nby rats, mice, crows, robins, etc. In the Zoologic Garden at Baltimore\r\ntwo years ago was a pair of pure albino opossums. The white elephant is\r\ncelebrated in the religious history of Oriental nations, and is an\r\nobject of veneration and worship in Siam. White monkeys and white\r\nroosters are also worshiped. In the Natural History Museum in London\r\nthere are stuffed examples of albinism and melanism in the lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nMelanism is an anomaly, the exact contrary of the preceding. It is\r\ncharacterized by the presence in the tissues and skin of an excessive\r\namount of pigment. True total melanism is unknown in man, in whom is\r\nonly observed partial melanism, characterized simply by a pronounced\r\ncoloration of part of the integument.\r\n\r\nSome curious instances have been related of an infant with a\r\ntwo-colored face, and of others with one side of the face white and the\r\nother black; whether they were cases of partial albinism or partial\r\nmelanism cannot be ascertained from the descriptions.\r\n\r\nSuch epidermic anomalies as ichthyosis, scleroderma, and molluscum\r\nsimplex, sometimes appearing shortly after birth, but generally seen\r\nlater in life, will be spoken of in the chapter on Anomalous Skin\r\nDiseases.\r\n\r\nHuman horns are anomalous outgrowths from the skin and are far more\r\nfrequent than ordinarily supposed. Nearly all the older writers cite\r\nexamples. Aldrovandus, Amatus Lusitanus, Boerhaave, Dupre, Schenck,\r\nRiverius, Vallisneri, and many others mention horns on the head. In the\r\nancient times horns were symbolic of wisdom and power. Michael Angelo\r\nin his famous sculpture of Moses has given the patriarch a pair of\r\nhorns. Rhodius observed a Benedictine monk who had a pair of horns and\r\nwho was addicted to rumination. Fabricius saw a man with horns on his\r\nhead, whose son ruminated; the son considered that by virtue of his\r\nruminating characteristics his father had transmitted to him the\r\npeculiar anomaly of the family. Fabricius Hildanus saw a patient with\r\nhorns all over the body and another with horns on the forehead.\r\nGastaher speaks of a horn from the left temple; Zacutus Lusitanus saw a\r\nhorn from the heel; Wroe, one of considerable length from the scapula;\r\nCosnard, one from the bregma; the Ephemerides, from the foot; Borellus,\r\nfrom the face and foot, and Ash, horns all over the body. Home, Cooper,\r\nand Treves have collected examples of horns, and there is one 11 inches\r\nlong and 2 1/2 in circumference in a London museum. Lozes collected\r\nreports of 71 cases of horns,--37 in females, 31 in males, and three in\r\ninfants. Of this number, 15 were on the head, eight on the face, 18 on\r\nthe lower extremities, eight on the trunk, and three on the glans\r\npenis. Wilson collected reports of 90 cases,--44 females, 39 males, the\r\nsex not being mentioned in the remainder. Of these 48 were on the head,\r\nfour on the face, four on the nose, 11 on the thigh, three on the leg\r\nand foot, six on the back, five on the glans penis, and nine on the\r\ntrunk. Lebert's collection numbered 109 cases of cutaneous horns. The\r\ngreater frequency among females is admitted by all authors. Old age is\r\na predisposing cause. Several patients over seventy have been seen and\r\none of ninety-seven.\r\n\r\nInstances of cutaneous horns, when seen and reported by the laity, give\r\nrise to most amusing exaggerations and descriptions.  The following\r\naccount is given in New South Wales, obviously embellished with\r\napocryphal details by some facetious journalist: The child, five weeks\r\nold, was born with hair two inches long all over the body; his features\r\nwere fiendish and his eyes shone like beads beneath his shaggy brows.\r\nHe had a tail 18 inches long, horns from the skull, a full set of\r\nteeth, and claw-like hands; he snapped like a dog and crawled on all\r\nfours, and refused the natural sustenance of a normal child. The mother\r\nalmost became an imbecile after the birth of the monster. The country\r\npeople about Bomballa considered this devil-child a punishment for a\r\nrebuff that the mother gave to a Jewish peddler selling\r\nCrucifixion-pictures. Vexed by his persistence, she said she would\r\nsooner have a devil in her house than his picture.\r\n\r\nLamprey has made a minute examination of the much-spoken-of \"Horned Men\r\nof Africa.\" He found that this anomaly was caused by a congenital\r\nmalformation and remarkable development of the infraorbital ridge of\r\nthe maxillary bone. He described several cases, and through an\r\ninterpreter found that they were congenital, followed no history of\r\ntraumatism, caused little inconvenience, and were unassociated with\r\ndisturbance of the sense of smell. He also learned that the deformity\r\nwas quite rare in the Cape Coast region, and received no information\r\ntending to prove the conjecture that the tribes in West Africa used\r\nartificial means to produce the anomaly, although such custom is\r\nprevalent among many aborigines.\r\n\r\nProbably the most remarkable case of a horn was that of Paul Rodrigues,\r\na Mexican porter, who, from the upper and lateral part of his head, had\r\na horn 14 inches in circumference and divided into three shafts, which\r\nhe concealed by constantly wearing a peculiarly shaped red cap. There\r\nis in Paris a wax model of a horn, eight or nine inches in length,\r\nremoved from an old woman by the celebrated Souberbielle. Figure 75 is\r\nfrom a wax model supposed to have been taken from life, showing an\r\nenormous grayish-black horn proceeding from the forehead. Warren\r\nmentions a case under the care of Dubois, in a woman from whose\r\nforehead grew a horn six inches in diameter and six inches in height.\r\nIt was hard at the summit and had a fetid odor. In 1696 there was an\r\nold woman in France who constantly shed long horns from her forehead,\r\none of which was presented to the King. Bartholinus mentions a horn 12\r\ninches long. Voigte cites the case of an old woman who had a horn\r\nbranching into three portions, coming from her forehead. Sands speaks\r\nof a woman who had a horn 6 3/4 inches long, growing from her head.\r\nThere is an account of the extirpation of a horn nearly ten inches in\r\nlength from the forehead of a woman of eighty-two. Bejau describes a\r\nwoman of forty from whom he excised an excrescence resembling a ram's\r\nhorn, growing from the left parietal region. It curved forward and\r\nnearly reached the corresponding tuberosity. It was eight cm.  long,\r\ntwo cm. broad at the base, and 1 1/2 cm. at the apex, and was quite\r\nmobile. It began to grow at the age of eleven and had constantly\r\nincreased. Vidal presented before the Academie de Medecine in 1886 a\r\ntwisted horn from the head of a woman. This excrescence was ten inches\r\nlong, and at the time of presentation reproduction of it was taking\r\nplace in the woman. Figure 76 shows a case of ichthyosis cornea\r\npictured in the Lancet, 1850.\r\n\r\nThere was a woman of seventy-five, living near York, who had a horny\r\ngrowth from the face which she broke off and which began to reproduce,\r\nthe illustration representing the growth during twelve months. Lall\r\nmentions a horn from the cheek; Gregory reports one that measured 7 1/2\r\ninches long that was removed from the temple of a woman in Edinburgh;\r\nChariere of Barnstaple saw a horn that measured seven inches growing\r\nfrom the nape of a woman's neck; Kameya Iwa speaks of a dermal horn of\r\nthe auricle; Saxton of New York has excised several horns from the\r\ntympanic membrane of the ear; Noyes speaks of one from the eyelid;\r\nBigelow mentions one from the chin; Minot speaks of a horn from the\r\nlower lip, and Doran of one from the neck.\r\n\r\nGould cites the instance of a horn growing from an epitheliomatous\r\npenis. The patient was fifty-two years of age and the victim of\r\ncongenital phimosis. He was circumcised four years previously, and\r\nshortly after the wound healed there appeared a small wart, followed by\r\na horn about the size of a marble. Jewett speaks of a penile horn 3 1/2\r\ninches long and 3 3/4 inches in diameter; Pick mentions one 2 1/2\r\ninches long. There is an account of a Russian peasant boy who had a\r\nhorn on his penis from his earliest childhood. Johnson mentions a case\r\nof a horn from the scrotum, which was of sebaceous origin and was\r\nsubsequently supplanted by an epithelioma.\r\n\r\nAsh reported the case of a girl named Annie Jackson, living in\r\nWaterford, Ireland, who had horny excrescences from her joints, arms,\r\naxillae, nipples, ears, and forehead. Locke speaks of a boy at the\r\nHopital de la Charite in Paris, who had horny excrescences four inches\r\nlong and 11 inches in circumference growing from his fingers and toes.\r\n\r\nWagstaffe presents a horn which grew from the middle of the leg six\r\ninches below the knee in a woman of eighty. It was a flattened spiral\r\nof more than two turns, and during forty years' growth had reached the\r\nlength of 14.3 inches. Its height was 3.8 inches, its skin-attachment\r\n1.5 inches in diameter, and it ended in a blunt extremity of 0.5 inch\r\nin diameter. Stephens mentions a dermal horn on the buttocks at the\r\nseat of a carcinomatous cicatrix. Harris and Domonceau speak of horns\r\nfrom the leg.  Cruveilhier saw a Mexican Indian who had a horn four\r\ninches long and eight inches in circumference growing from the left\r\nlumbar region. It had been sawed off twice by the patient's son and was\r\nfinally extirpated by Faget. The length of the pieces was 12 inches.\r\nBellamy saw a horn on the clitoris about the size of a tiger's claw in\r\na its origin from beneath the preputium clitoridis.\r\n\r\nHorns are generally solitary but cases of multiple formation are known\r\nLewin and Heller record a syphilitic case with eight cutaneous horns on\r\nthe palms and soles. A female patient of Manzuroff had as many as 185\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nPancoast reports the case of a man whose nose, cheeks, forehead, and\r\nlips were covered with horny growths, which had apparently undergone\r\nepitheliomatous degeneration. The patient was a sea-captain of\r\nseventy-eight, and had been exposed to the winds all his life. He had\r\nsuffered three attacks of erysipelas from prolonged exposure. When he\r\nconsulted Pancoast the horns had nearly all fallen off and were brought\r\nto the physician for inspection; and the photograph was taken after the\r\npatient had tied the horns in situ on his face.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Hair.--Congenital alopecia is quite rare, and it is\r\nseldom that we see instances of individuals who have been totally\r\ndestitute of hair from birth. Danz knew of two adult sons of a Jewish\r\nfamily who never had hair or teeth. Sedgwick quotes the case of a man\r\nof fifty-eight who ever since birth was totally devoid of hair and in\r\nwhom sensible perspiration and tears were absent. A cousin on his\r\nmother's side, born a year before him, had precisely the same\r\npeculiarity. Buffon says that the Turks and some other people practised\r\ndepilatory customs by the aid of ointments and pomades, principally\r\nabout the genitals. Atkinson exhibited in Philadelphia a man of forty\r\nwho never had any distinct growth of hair since birth, was edentulous,\r\nand destitute of the sense of smell and almost of that of taste. He had\r\nno apparent perspiration, and when working actively he was obliged to\r\nwet his clothes in order to moderate the heat of his body. He could\r\nsleep in wet clothes in a damp cellar without catching cold. There was\r\nsome hair in the axillae and on the pubes, but only the slightest down\r\non the scalp, and even that was absent on the skin. His maternal\r\ngrandmother and uncle were similarly affected; he was the youngest of\r\n21 children, had never been sick, and though not able to chew food in\r\nthe ordinary manner, he had never suffered from dyspepsia in any form.\r\nHe was married and had eight children. Of these, two girls lacked a\r\nnumber of teeth, but had the ordinary quantity of hair. Hill speaks of\r\nan aboriginal man in Queensland who was entirely devoid of hair on the\r\nhead, face, and every part of the body. He had a sister, since dead,\r\nwho was similarly hairless. Hill mentions the accounts given of another\r\nblack tribe, about 500 miles west of Brisbane, that contained hairless\r\nmembers. This is very strange, as the Australian aboriginals are a very\r\nhairy race of people.\r\n\r\nHutchinson mentions a boy of three and a half in whom there was\r\ncongenital absence of hair and an atrophic condition of the skin and\r\nappendages. His mother was bald from the age of six, after alopecia\r\nareata. Schede reports two cases of congenitally bald children of a\r\npeasant woman (a boy of thirteen and a girl of six months). They had\r\nboth been born quite bald, and had remained so.  In addition there were\r\nneither eyebrows nor eyelashes and nowhere a trace of lanugo. The\r\nchildren were otherwise healthy and well formed. The parents and\r\nbrothers were healthy and possessed a full growth of hair. Thurman\r\nreports a case of a man of fifty-eight, who was almost devoid of hair\r\nall his life and possessed only four teeth. His skin was very delicate\r\nand there was absence of sensible perspiration and tears. The skin was\r\npeculiar in thinness, softness, and absence of pigmentation. The hair\r\non the crown of the head and back was very fine, short, and soft, and\r\nnot more in quantity than that of an infant of three months. There was\r\na similar peculiarity in his cousin-german.  Williams mentions the case\r\nof a young lady of fifteen with scarcely any hair on the eyebrows or\r\nhead and no eyelashes. She was edentulous and had never sensibly\r\nperspired. She improved under tonic treatment.\r\n\r\nRayer quotes the case of Beauvais, who was a patient in the Hopital de\r\nla Charite in 1827. The skin of this man's cranium was apparently\r\ncompletely naked, although in examining it narrowly it was found to be\r\nbeset with a quantity of very white and silky hair, similar to the down\r\nthat covers the scalp of infants; here and there on the temples there\r\nwere a few black specks, occasioned by the stumps of several hairs\r\nwhich the patient had shaved off. The eyebrows were merely indicated by\r\na few fine and very short hairs; the free edges of the eyelids were\r\nwithout cilia, but the bulb of each of these was indicated by a small,\r\nwhitish point. The beard was so thin and weak that Beauvais clipped it\r\noff only every three weeks. A few straggling hairs were observed on the\r\nbreast and pubic region, as in young people on the approach of puberty.\r\nThere was scarcely any under the axillae. It was rather more abundant\r\non the inner parts of the legs. The voice was like that of a full-grown\r\nand well-constituted man. Beauvais was of an amorous disposition and\r\nhad had syphilis twice. His mother and both sisters had good heads of\r\nhair, but his father presented the same defects as Beauvais.\r\n\r\nInstances are on record of women devoid of hair about the genital\r\nregion. Riolan says that he examined the body of a female libertine who\r\nwas totally hairless from the umbilical region down.\r\n\r\nCongenital alopecia is seen in animals. There is a species of dog, a\r\nnative of China but now bred in Mexico and in the United States, which\r\nis distinguished for its congenital alopecia. The same fact has been\r\nobserved occasionally in horses, cattle, and dogs. Heusner has seen a\r\npigeon destitute of feathers, and which engendered a female which in\r\nher turn transmitted the same characteristic to two of her young.\r\n\r\nSexualism and Hair Growth.--The growth or development of the hair may\r\nbe accelerated by the state of the organs of generation. This is\r\npeculiarly noticeable in the pubic hairs and the beard, and is fully\r\nexemplified in the section on precocious development (Chapter VII);\r\nhowever, Moreau de la Sarthe showed a child to the Medical Faculty of\r\nParis in whom precocious development of the testicles had influenced\r\nthat of the hair to such a degree that, at the age of six, the chest of\r\nthis boy was as thickly set with hair as is usually seen in adults. It\r\nis well known that eunuchs often lose a great part of their beards, and\r\nafter removal of the ovaries women are seen to develop an extra\r\nquantity of hair.  Gerberon tells of an infant with a beard, and\r\nPaullini and the Ephemerides mention similar instances.\r\n\r\nBearded women are not at all infrequent. Hippocrates mentions a female\r\nwho grew a beard shortly after menstruation had ceased. It is a\r\nwell-recognized fact that after the menopause women become more\r\nhirsute, the same being the case after removal of any of the functional\r\ngenerative apparatus. Vicat saw a virgin who had a beard, and Joch\r\nspeaks of \"foeminis barbati.\" Leblond says that certain women of\r\nEthiopia and South America have beards and little or no menstruation.\r\nHe also says that sterility and excessive chastity are causes of female\r\nbeards, and cites the case of Schott of a young widow who secluded\r\nherself in a cloister, and soon had a beard.\r\n\r\nBarbara Urster, who lived in the 16th century, had a beard to her\r\ngirdle. The most celebrated \"bearded woman\" was Rosine-Marguerite\r\nMuller, who died in a hospital in Dresden in 1732, with a thick beard\r\nand heavy mustache. Julia Pastrana had her face covered with thick hair\r\nand had a full beard and mustache. She exhibited defective dentition in\r\nboth jaws, and the teeth present were arranged in an irregular fashion.\r\nShe had pronounced prognathism, which gave her a simian appearance.\r\nEcker examined in 1876 a woman who died at Fribourg, whose face\r\ncontained a full beard and a luxuriant mustache.\r\n\r\nHarris reports several cases of bearded women, inmates of the Coton\r\nHill Lunatic Asylum. One of the patients was eighty-three years of age\r\nand had been insane forty-four years following a puerperal period. She\r\nwould not permit the hair on her face to be cut, and the curly white\r\nhairs had attained a length of from eight to ten inches on the chin,\r\nwhile on the upper lip the hairs were scarcely an inch. This patient\r\nwas quite womanly in all her sentiments. The second case was a woman of\r\nthirty-six, insane from emotional melancholia. She had tufts of thick,\r\ncurly hair on the chin two inches long, light yellowish in color, and a\r\nfew straggling hairs on the upper lip. The third case was that of a\r\nwoman of sixty-four, who exhibited a strong passion for the male sex.\r\nHer menstruation had been regular until the menopause. She plaited her\r\nbeard, and it was seven or eight inches long on the chin and one inch\r\non the lip. This woman had extremely hairy legs. Another case was that\r\nof a woman of sixty-two, who, though bald, developed a beard before the\r\nclimacteric. Her structural proportions were feminine in character, and\r\nit is said that her mother, who was sane, had a beard also. A curious\r\ncase was that of a woman of twenty-three (Mrs. Viola M.), who from the\r\nage of three had a considerable quantity of hair on the side of the\r\ncheek which eventually became a full beard. She was quite feminine was\r\nfree from excessive hair elsewhere, her nose and forehead being\r\nsingularly bare. Her voice was very sweet; she was married at seventeen\r\nand a half, having two normal children, and nursed each for one month.\r\n\"The bearded woman\" of every circus side-show is an evidence of the\r\ncurious interest in which these women are held. The accompanying\r\nillustration is a representation of a \"bearded woman\" born in Bracken\r\nCounty, Ky. Her beard measured 15 inches in length.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of anomalies in which there is an exaggerated\r\ndevelopment of hair. We would naturally expect to find the primitive\r\npeoples, who are not provided with artificial protection against the\r\nwind, supplied with an extra quantity of hair or having a hairy coat\r\nlike animals; but this is sometimes found among civilized people. This\r\nabnormal presence of hair on the human body has been known for many\r\nyears; the description of Esau in the Bible is an early instance.\r\nAldrovandus says that in the sixteenth century there came to the Canary\r\nIslands a family consisting of a father, son, and two daughters, who\r\nwere covered all over their bodies by long hair, and their portrait,\r\ncertainly reproduced from life, resembles the modern instances of \"dog\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883 there was shown in England and France, afterward in America, a\r\ngirl of seven named \"Krao,\" a native of Indo-China.  The whole body of\r\nthis child was covered with black hair. Her face was of the prognathic\r\ntype, and this, with her extraordinary prehensile powers of feet and\r\nlips, gave her the title of \"Darwin's missing link.\" In 1875 there was\r\nexhibited in Paris, under the name of \"l'homme-chien\" Adrien Jeftichew,\r\na Russian peasant of fifty-five, whose face, head, back, and limbs were\r\ncovered with a brown hairy coat looking like wool and several\r\ncentimeters long. The other parts of the body were also covered with\r\nhair, but less abundantly. This individual had a son of three,\r\nTheodore, who was hairy like himself.\r\n\r\nA family living in Burmah (Shive-Maon, whose history is told by\r\nCrawford and Yule), consisting of a father, a daughter, and a\r\ngranddaughter, were nearly covered with hair. Figure 84 represents a\r\nsomewhat similar family who were exhibited in this country.\r\n\r\nTeresa Gambardella, a young girl of twelve, mentioned by Lombroso, was\r\ncovered all over the body, with the exception of the hands and feet, by\r\nthick, bushy hair. This hypertrichosis was exemplified in this country\r\nonly a few months since by a person who went the rounds of the dime\r\nmuseums under the euphonious name of \"Jo-Jo, the dog-face boy.\" His\r\nface was truly that of a skye-terrier.\r\n\r\nSometimes the hairy anomalies are but instances of naevus pilosus. The\r\nIndian ourang-outang woman examined at the office of the Lancet was an\r\nexample of this kind. Hebra, Hildebrandt, Jablokoff, and Klein describe\r\nsimilar cases. Many of the older \"wild men\" were individuals bearing\r\nextensive hairy moles.\r\n\r\nRayer remarks that he has seen a young man of sixteen who exhibited\r\nhimself to the public under the name of a new species of wild man whose\r\nbreast and back were covered with light brown hair of considerable\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe surface upon which it grew was of a brownish hue, different from\r\nthe color of the surrounding integument. Almost the whole of the right\r\narm was covered in the same manner. On the lower extremity several\r\ntufts of hair were observed implanted upon brown spots from seven to\r\neight lines in diameter symmetrically disposed upon both legs. The hair\r\nwas brown, of the same color as that of the head. Bichat informs us\r\nthat he saw at Paris an unfortunate man who from his birth was\r\nafflicted with a hairy covering of his face like that of a wild boar,\r\nand he adds that the stories which were current among the vulgar of\r\nindividuals with a boar's head, wolf's head, etc., undoubtedly referred\r\nto cases in which the face was covered to a greater or less degree with\r\nhair. Villerme saw a child of six at Poitiers in 1808 whose body,\r\nexcept the feet and hands, was covered with a great number of prominent\r\nbrown spots of different dimensions, beset with hair shorter and not so\r\nstrong as that of a boar, but bearing a certain resemblance to the\r\nbristles of that animal. These spots occupied about one-fifth of the\r\nsurface of this child's skin.  Campaignac in the early part of this\r\ncentury exhibited a case in which there was a large tuft of long black\r\nhair growing from the shoulder. Dufour has detailed a case of a young\r\nman of twenty whose sacral region contained a tuft of hair as long and\r\nblack, thick and pliant, as that of the head, and, particularly\r\nremarkable in this case, the skin from which it grew was as fine and\r\nwhite as the integument of the rest of the body. There was a woman\r\nexhibited recently, under the advertisement of \"the lady with a mane,\"\r\nwho had growing from the center of her back between the shoulders a\r\nveritable mane of long, black hair, which doubtless proceeded from a\r\nform of naevus.\r\n\r\nDuyse reports a case of extensive hypertrichosis of the back in a girl\r\naged nine years; her teeth were normal; there was pigmentation of the\r\nback and numerous pigmentary nevi on the face. Below each scapula there\r\nwere tumors of the nature of fibroma molluscum. In addition to hairy\r\nnevi on the other parts of the body there was localized ichthyosis.\r\n\r\nZiemssen figures an interesting case of naevus pilosus resembling\r\n\"bathing tights\". There were also present several benign tumors\r\n(fibroma molluscum) and numerous smaller nevi over the body.  Schulz\r\nfirst observed the patient in 1878. This individual's name was Blake,\r\nand he stated that he was born with a large naevus spreading over the\r\nupper parts of the thighs and lower parts of the trunk, like\r\nbathing-tights, and resembling the pelt of an animal. The same was true\r\nof the small hairy parts and the larger and smaller tumors.\r\nSubsequently the altered portions of the skin had gradually become\r\nsomewhat larger. The skin of the large hairy naevus, as well as that of\r\nthe smaller ones, was stated by Schulz to have been in the main\r\nthickened, in part uneven, verrucose, from very light to intensely dark\r\nbrown in color; the consistency of the larger mammiform and smaller\r\ntumors soft, doughy, and elastic. The case was really one of large\r\ncongenital naevus pilosus and fibroma molluscum combined.\r\n\r\nA Peruvian boy was shown at the Westminster Aquarium with a dark, hairy\r\nmole situated in the lower part of the trunk and on the thighs in the\r\nposition of bathing tights. Nevins Hyde records two similar cases with\r\ndermatolytic growths. A sister of the Peruvian boy referred to had a\r\nstill larger growth, extending from the nucha all over the back. Both\r\nshe and her brother had hundreds of smaller hairy growths of all sizes\r\nscattered irregularly over the face, trunk, and limbs. According to\r\nCrocker, a still more extraordinary case, with extensive dermatolytic\r\ngrowths all over the back and nevi of all sizes elsewhere, is described\r\nand engraved in \"Lavater's Physiognomy,\" 1848. Baker describes an\r\noperation in which a large mole occupying half the forehead was removed\r\nby the knife.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the hair and beard is of an enormous length.  Erasmus\r\nWilson of London saw a female of thirty-eight, whose hair measured 1.65\r\nmeters long. Leonard of Philadelphia speaks of a man in the interior of\r\nthis country whose beard trailed on the ground when he stood upright,\r\nand measured 2.24 meters long. Not long ago there appeared the famous\r\nso-called \"Seven Sutherland Sisters,\" whose hair touched the ground,\r\nand with whom nearly every one is familiar through a hair tonic which\r\nthey extensively advertised. In Nature, January 9, 1892, is an account\r\nof a Percheron horse whose mane measured 13 feet and whose tail\r\nmeasured almost ten feet, probably the greatest example of excessive\r\nmane development on record. Figure 88 represents Miss Owens, an\r\nexhibitionist, whose hair measured eight feet three inches. In Leslie's\r\nWeekly, January 2, 1896, there is a portrait of an old negress named\r\nNancy Garrison whose woolly hair was equally as long.\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides contains the account of a woman who had hair from the\r\nmons veneris which hung to the knees; it was affected with plica\r\npolonica, as was also the other hair of the body.\r\n\r\nRayer saw a Piedmontese of twenty-eight, with an athletic build, who\r\nhad but little beard or hair on the trunk, but whose scalp was covered\r\nwith a most extraordinary crop. It was extremely fine and silky, was\r\nartificially frizzled, dark brown in color, and formed a mass nearly\r\nfive feet in circumference.\r\n\r\nCertain pathologic conditions may give rise to accidental growths of\r\nhair. Boyer was accustomed to quote in his lectures the case of a man\r\nwho, having an inflamed tumor in the thigh, perceived this part\r\nbecoming covered in a short time with numerous long hairs. Rayer speaks\r\nof several instances of this kind. In one the part affected by a\r\nblister in a child of two became covered with hair. Another instance\r\nwas that of a student of medicine, who after bathing in the sea for a\r\nlength of time, and exposing himself to the hot sun, became affected\r\nwith coppery patches, from which there sprang a growth of hair.\r\nBricheteau, quoted by the same authority, speaks of a woman of\r\ntwenty-four, having white skin and hair of deep black, who after a long\r\nillness occasioned by an affection analogous to marasmus became\r\ncovered, especially on the back, breast, and abdomen, with a multitude\r\nof small elevations similar to those which appear on exposure to cold.\r\nThese little elevations became brownish at the end of a few days, and\r\nshort, fair, silky hair was observed on the summit of each, which grew\r\nso rapidly that the whole surface of the body with the exception of the\r\nhands and face became velvety. The hair thus evolved was afterward\r\nthrown out spontaneously and was not afterward reproduced.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Color of the Hair.--New-born infants sometimes have\r\ntufts of hair on their heads which are perfectly white in color.\r\nSchenck speaks of a young man whose beard from its first appearance\r\ngrew white. Young men from eighteen to twenty occasionally become gray;\r\nand according to Rayer, paroxysms of rage, unexpected and unwelcome\r\nnews, diseases of the scalp such as favus, wounds of the head, habitual\r\nheadache, over-indulgence of the sexual appetite, mercurial courses too\r\nfrequently repeated, too great anxiety, etc., have been known to blanch\r\nthe hair prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe well-accepted fact of the sudden changing of the color of the hair\r\nfrom violent emotions or other causes has always excited great\r\ninterest, and many ingenious explanations have been devised to account\r\nfor it. There is a record in the time of Charles V of a young man who\r\nwas committed to prison in 1546 for seducing his girl companion, and\r\nwhile there was in great fear and grief, expecting a death-sentence\r\nfrom the Emperor the next day. When brought before his judge, his face\r\nwas wan and pale and his hair and beard gray, the change having taken\r\nplace in the night. His beard was filthy with drivel, and the Emperor,\r\nmoved by his pitiful condition, pardoned him. There was a clergyman of\r\nNottingham whose daughter at the age of thirteen experienced a change\r\nfrom jet-blackness of the hair to white in a single night, but this was\r\nconfined to a spot on the back of the head 1 1/2 inches in length. Her\r\nhair soon became striped, and in seven years was totally white. The\r\nsame article speaks of a girl in Bedfordshire, Maria Seeley, aged\r\neight, whose face was swarthy, and whose hair was long and dark on one\r\nside and light and short on the other. One side of her body was also\r\nbrown, while the other side was light and fair. She was seen by the\r\nfaculty in London, but no cause could be established.\r\n\r\nVoigtel mentions the occurrence of canities almost suddenly.  Bichat\r\nhad a personal acquaintance whose hair became almost entirely gray in\r\nconsequence of some distressing news that reached him. Cassan records a\r\nsimilar case. According to Rayer, a woman by the name of Perat,\r\nsummoned before the Chamber of Peers to give evidence in the trial of\r\nthe assassin Louvel, was so much affected that her hair became entirely\r\nwhite in a single night Byron makes mention of this peculiar anomaly in\r\nthe opening stanzas of the \"Prisoner of Chillon:\"--\r\n\r\n\"My hair is gray, but not with years, Nor grew it white In a single\r\nnight.  As men's have grown from sudden fears.\"\r\n\r\nThe commentators say that Byron had reference to Ludovico Sforza and\r\nothers. The fact of the change is asserted of Marie Antoinette, the\r\nwife of Louis XVI, though in not quite so short a period, grief and not\r\nfear being the cause. Ziemssen cites Landois' case of a compositor of\r\nthirty-four who was admitted to a hospital July 9th with symptoms of\r\ndelirium tremens; until improvement began to set in (July 13th) he was\r\ncontinually tormented by terrifying pictures of the imagination. In the\r\nnight preceding the day last mentioned the hair of the head and beard\r\nof the patient, formerly blond, became gray. Accurate examination by\r\nLandois showed the pigment contents of the hair to be unchanged, and\r\nled him to believe that the white color was solely due to the excessive\r\ndevelopment of air-bubbles in the hair shaft. Popular belief brings the\r\npremature and especially the sudden whitening into connection with\r\ndepressing mental emotions.  We might quote the German\r\nexpression--\"Sich graue Haare etwas wachsen lassen\" (\"To worry one's\r\nself gray\"). Brown-Sequard observed on several occasions in his own\r\ndark beard hairs which had turned white in a night and which he\r\nepileptoid. He closes his brief communication on the subject with the\r\nbelief that it is quite possible for black hair to turn white in one\r\nnight or even in a less time, although Hebra and Kaposi discredit\r\nsudden canities (Duhring). Raymond and Vulpian observed a lady of\r\nneurotic type whose hair during a severe paroxysm of neuralgia\r\nfollowing a mental strain changed color in five hours over the entire\r\nscalp except on the back and sides; most of the hair changed from black\r\nto red, but some to quite white, and in two days all the red hair\r\nbecame white and a quantity fell off. The patient recovered her general\r\nhealth, but with almost total loss of hair, only a few red, white, and\r\nblack hairs remaining on the occipital and temporal regions. Crocker\r\ncites the case of a Spanish cock which was nearly killed by some pigs.\r\nThe morning after the adventure the feathers of the head had become\r\ncompletely white, and about half of those on the back of the neck were\r\nalso changed.\r\n\r\nDewees reports a case of puerperal convulsions in a patient under his\r\ncare which was attended with sudden canities. From 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. 50\r\nounces of blood were taken. Between the time of Dr. Dewees' visits, not\r\nmore than an hour, the hair anterior to the coronal suture turned\r\nwhite. The next day it was less light, and in four or five days was\r\nnearly its natural color. He also mentions two cases of sudden\r\nblanching from fright.\r\n\r\nFowler mentions the case of a healthy girl of sixteen who found one\r\nmorning while combing her hair, which was black, that a strip the whole\r\nlength of the back hair was white, starting from a surface about two\r\ninches square around the occipital protuberance. Two weeks later she\r\nhad patches of ephelis over the whole body.\r\n\r\nPrentiss, in Science, October 3, 1890, has collected numerous instances\r\nof sudden canities, several of which will be given:--\r\n\r\n\"In the Canada Journal of Medical Science, 1882, p. 113, is reported a\r\ncase of sudden canities due to business-worry. The microscope showed a\r\ngreat many air-vesicles both in the medullary substance and between the\r\nmedullary and cortical substance.\r\n\r\n\"In the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, 1851, is reported a case\r\nof a man thirty years old, whose hair 'was scared' white in a day by a\r\ngrizzly bear. He was sick in a mining camp, was left alone, and fell\r\nasleep. On waking he found a grizzly bear standing over him.\r\n\r\n\"A second case is that of a man of twenty-three years who was gambling\r\nin California. He placed his entire savings of $1100 on the turn of a\r\ncard. He was under tremendous nervous excitement while the cards were\r\nbeing dealt. The next day his hair was perfectly white.\r\n\r\n\"In the same article is the statement that the jet-black hair of the\r\nPacific Islanders does not turn gray gradually, but when it does turn\r\nit is sudden, usually the result of fright or sudden emotions.\"\r\n\r\nD'Alben, quoted by Fournier, describes a young man of twenty-four, an\r\nofficer in the regiment of Touraine in 1781, who spent the night in\r\ncarnal dissipation with a mulatto, after which he had violent spasms,\r\nrendering flexion of the body impossible.  His beard and hair on the\r\nright side of the body was found as white as snow, the left side being\r\nunchanged. He appeared before the Faculte de Montpelier, and though\r\ncured of his nervous symptoms his hair was still white, and no\r\nsuggestion of relief was offered him.\r\n\r\nLouis of Bavaria, who died in 1294, on learning of the innocence of his\r\nwife, whom he had put to death on a suspicion of her infidelity, had a\r\nchange of color in his hair, which became white almost immediately.\r\nVauvilliers, the celebrated Hellenist, became white-haired almost\r\nimmediately after a terrible dream, and Brizard, the comedian,\r\nexperienced the same change after a narrow escape from drowning in the\r\nRhone. The beard and the hair of the Duke of Brunswick whitened in\r\ntwenty-four hours after hearing that his father had been mortally\r\nwounded at the battle of Auerstadt.\r\n\r\nDe Schweinitz speaks of a well-formed and healthy brunette of eighteen\r\nin whom the middle portion of the cilia of the right upper eyelid and a\r\nnumber of the hairs of the lower lid turned white in a week. Both eyes\r\nwere myopic, but no other cause could be assigned. Another similar case\r\nis cited by Hirshberg, and the authors have seen similar cases.\r\nThornton of Margate records the case of a lady in whom the hair of the\r\nleft eyebrow and eyelashes began to turn white after a fortnight of\r\nsudden grief, and within a week all the hair of these regions was quite\r\nwhite and remained so. No other part was affected nor was there any\r\nother symptom.  After a traumatic ophthalmitis of the left and\r\nsympathetic inflammation of the right eye in a boy of nine, Schenck\r\nobserved that a group of cilia of the right upper lid and nearly all\r\nthe lashes of the upper lid of the left eye, which had been enucleated,\r\nturned silvery-white in a short time. Ludwig has known the eyelashes to\r\nbecome white after small-pox.  Communications are also on record of\r\nlocal decolorization of the eyebrows and lashes in neuralgias of\r\nisolated branches of the trigeminus, especially of the supraorbital\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nTemporary and Partial Canities.--Of special interest are those cases in\r\nwhich whiteness of the hair is only temporary. Thus, Compagne mentions\r\na case in which the black hair of a woman of thirty-six began to fade\r\non the twenty-third day of a malignant fever, and on the sixth day\r\nfollowing was perfectly white, but on the seventh day the hairs became\r\ndarker again, and on the fourteenth day after the change they had\r\nbecome as black as they were originally. Wilson records a case in which\r\nthe hair lost its color in winter and regained it in summer. Sir John\r\nForbes, according to Crocker, had gray hair for a long time, then\r\nsuddenly it all turned white, and after remaining so for a year it\r\nreturned to its original gray.\r\n\r\nGrayness of the hair is sometimes only partial. According to Crocker an\r\nadult whose hair was generally brown had a tuft of white hair over the\r\ntemple, and several like cases are on record.  Lorry tells us that\r\ngrayness of one side only is sometimes occasioned by severe headache.\r\nHagedorn has known the beard to be black in one place and white in\r\nanother. Brandis mentions the hair becoming white on one side of the\r\nface while it continued of its former color on the other. Rayer quotes\r\ncases of canities of the whole of one side of the body.\r\n\r\nRichelot observed white mottling of hair in a girl sick with chlorosis.\r\nThe whitening extended from the roots to a distance of two inches. The\r\nprobable cause was a temporary alteration of the pigment-forming\r\nfunction. When the chlorosis was cured the natural color returned.\r\nPaullini and Riedlin, as well as the Ephemerides, speak of different\r\ncolored hair in the same head, and it is not at all rare to see\r\nindividuals with an anomalously colored patch of hair on the head. The\r\nmembers of the ancient house of Rohan were said to possess a tuft of\r\nwhite hair on the front of their heads.\r\n\r\nMichelson of Konigsberg describes a curious case in a barrister of\r\ntwenty-three affected with partial canities. In the family of both\r\nparents there was stated to be congenital premature canities, and some\r\nwhite hairs had been observed even in childhood. In the fifteenth year,\r\nafter a grave attack of scarlet fever, the hair to a great extent fell\r\nout. The succeeding growth of hair was stated to have been throughout\r\nlighter in tissue and color and fissured at the points. Soon after\r\nbunches of white hair appeared on the occiput, and in the succeeding\r\nyears small patches of decolored hairs were observed also on the\r\nanterior and lateral portions of the scalp. In the spring of 1880 the\r\npatient exhibited signs of infiltration of the apex of the right lung,\r\nand afterward a violent headache came on. At the time of the report the\r\npatient presented the appearance shown in Figure 89.  The complexion\r\nwas delicate throughout, the eyelashes and eyelids dark brown, the\r\nmoustache and whiskers blond, and in the latter were a few groups of\r\nwhite hair. The white patches were chiefly on the left side of the\r\nhead. The hairs growing on them were unpigmented, but otherwise normal.\r\nThe patient stated that his head never sweated. He was stout and\r\nexhibited no signs of internal disease, except at the apex of the right\r\nlung.\r\n\r\nAnomalous Color Changes of the Hair.--The hair is liable to undergo\r\ncertain changes of color connected with some modification of that part\r\nof the bulb secreting its coloring-matter. Alibert, quoted by Rayer,\r\ngives us a report of the case of a young lady who, after a severe fever\r\nwhich followed a very difficult labor, lost a fine head of hair during\r\na discharge of viscid fluid, which inundated the head in every part. He\r\ntells us, further, that the hair grew again of a deep black color after\r\nthe recovery of the patient. The same writer tells of the case of James\r\nB--, born with brown hair, who, having lost it all during the course of\r\na sickness, had it replaced with a crop of the brightest red.  White\r\nand gray hair has also, under peculiar circumstances, been replaced by\r\nhair of the same color as the individual had in youth. We are even\r\nassured by Bruley that in 1798 the white hair of a woman sixty years of\r\nage changed to black a few days before her death. The bulbs in this\r\ncase were found of great size, and appeared gorged with a substance\r\nfrom which the hair derived its color. The white hairs that remained,\r\non the contrary, grew from shriveled bulbs much smaller than those\r\nproducing the black. This patient died of phthisis.\r\n\r\nA very singular case, published early in the century, was that of a\r\nwoman whose hair, naturally fair, assumed a tawny red color as often as\r\nshe was affected with a certain fever, and returned to its natural hue\r\nas soon as the symptoms abated. Villerme alludes to the case of a young\r\nlady, sixteen years of age, who had never suffered except from trifling\r\nheadaches, and who, in the winter of 1817, perceived that the hair\r\nbegan to fall out from several parts of her head, so that before six\r\nmonths were over she became entirely bald. In the beginning of January,\r\n1819, her head became covered with a kind of black wool over those\r\nplaces that were first denuded, and light brown hair began to develop\r\nfrom the rest of the scalp. Some of this fell out again when it had\r\ngrown from three to four inches; the rest changed color at different\r\ndistances from its end and grew of a chestnut color from the roots. The\r\nhair, half black, half chestnut, had a very singular appearance.\r\n\r\nAlibert and Beigel relate cases of women with blond hair which all came\r\noff after a severe fever (typhus in one case), and when it grew again\r\nit was quite black. Alibert also saw a young man who lost his brown\r\nhair after an illness, and after restoration it became red. According\r\nto Crocker, in an idiotic girl of epileptic type (in an asylum at\r\nEdinburgh), with alternating phases of stupidity and excitement, the\r\nhair in the stupid phase was blond and in the excited condition red.\r\nThe change of color took place in the course of two or three days,\r\nbeginning first at the free ends, and remaining of the same tint for\r\nseven or eight days. The pale hairs had more air-spaces than the darker\r\nones.  There was much structural change in the brain and spinal cord.\r\nSmyly of Dublin reported a case of suppurative disease of the temporal\r\nbone, in which the hair changed from a mouse-color to a reddish-brown;\r\nand Squire records a congenital case in a deaf mute, in whom the hair\r\non the left side was in light patches of true auburn and dark patches\r\nof dark brown like a tortoise-shell cap; on the other side the hair was\r\na dark brown. Crocker mentions the changes which have occurred in rare\r\ninstances after death from dark brown to red.\r\n\r\nChemic colorations of various tints occur. Blue hair is seen in workers\r\nin cobalt mines and indigo works; green hair in copper smelters; deep\r\nred-brown hair in handlers of crude anilin; and the hair is dyed a\r\npurplish-brown whenever chrysarobin applications used on a scalp come\r\nin contact with an alkali, as when washed with soap. Among such cases\r\nin older literature Blanchard and Marcellus Donatus speak of green\r\nhair; Rosse saw two instances of the same, for one of which he could\r\nfind no cause; the other patient worked in a brass foundry.\r\n\r\nMany curious causes are given for alopecia. Gilibert and Merlet mention\r\nsexual excess; Marcellus Donatus gives fear; the Ephemerides speaks of\r\nbaldness from fright; and Leo Africanus, in his description of Barbary,\r\ndescribes endemic baldness. Neyronis makes the following observation: A\r\nman of seventy-three, convalescent from a fever, one morning, about six\r\nmonths after recovery perceived that he had lost all his hair, even his\r\neyelashes, eyebrows, nostril-hairs, etc. Although his health continued\r\ngood, the hair was never renewed.\r\n\r\nThe principal anomalies of the nails observed are absence, hypertrophy,\r\nand displacement of these organs. Some persons are born with\r\nfinger-nails and toe-nails either very rudimentary or entirely absent;\r\nin others they are of great length and thickness. The Chinese nobility\r\nallow their finger-nails to grow to a great length and spend much time\r\nin the care of these nails.  Some savage tribes have long and thick\r\nnails resembling the claws of beasts, and use them in the same way as\r\nthe lower animals.  There is a description of a person with\r\nfinger-nails that resembled the horns of a goat.\r\n\r\nNeuhof, in his books on Tartary and China, says that many Chinamen have\r\ntwo nails on the little toe, and other instances of double nails have\r\nbeen reported.\r\n\r\nThe nails may be reversed or arise from anomalous positions.\r\nBartholinus speaks of nails from the inner side of the digits; in\r\nanother case, in which the fingers were wanting, he found the nails\r\nimplanted on the stumps. Tulpius says he knew of a case in which nails\r\ncame from the articulations of three digits; and many other curious\r\narrangements of nails are to be found.\r\n\r\nRouhuot sent a description and drawing of some monstrous nails to the\r\nAcademie des Sciences de Paris. The largest of these was the left great\r\ntoe-nail, which, from its extremity to its root, measured 4 3/4 inches;\r\nthe laminae of which it consisted were placed one over the other, like\r\nthe tiles on a roof, only reversed. This nail and several of the others\r\nwere of unequal thickness and were variously curved, probably on\r\naccount of the pressure of the shoe or the neighboring digits. Rayer\r\nmentions two nails sent to him by Bricheteau, physician of the Hopital\r\nNecker, belonging to an old woman who had lived in the Salpetriere.\r\nThey were very thick and spirally twisted, like the horns of a ram.\r\nSaviard informs us that he saw a patient at the Hotel Dieu who had a\r\nhorn like that of a ram, instead of a nail, on each great toe, the\r\nextremities of which were turned to the metatarsus and overlapped the\r\nwhole of the other toes of each foot. The skeleton of Simore, preserved\r\nin Paris, is remarkable for the ankylosis of all the articulations and\r\nthe considerable size of all the nails. The fingers and toes, spread\r\nout and ankylosed, ended in nails of great length and nearly of equal\r\nthickness. A woman by the name of Melin, living in the last century in\r\nParis, was surnamed \"the woman with nails;\" according to the\r\ndescription given by Saillant in 1776 she presented another and not\r\nless curious instance of the excessive growth of the nails.\r\n\r\nMusaeus gives an account of the nails of a girl of twenty, which grew\r\nto such a size that some of those of the fingers were five inches in\r\nlength. They were composed of several layers, whitish interiorly,\r\nreddish-gray on the exterior, and full of black points. These nails\r\nfell off at the end of four months and were succeeded by others. There\r\nwere also horny laminae on the knees and shoulders and elbows which\r\nbore a resemblance to nails, or rather talons. They were sensitive only\r\nat the point of insertion into the skin. Various other parts of the\r\nbody, particularly the backs of the hands, presented these horny\r\nproductions. One of them was four inches in length. This horny growth\r\nappeared after small-pox. Ash, in the Philosophical Transactions,\r\nrecords a somewhat similar case in a girl of twelve.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Teeth.--Pliny, Colombus, van Swieten, Haller,\r\nMarcellus Donatus, Baudelocque, Soemmering, and Gardien all cite\r\ninstances in which children have come into the world with several teeth\r\nalready erupted. Haller has collected 19 cases of children born with\r\nteeth. Polydorus Virgilus describes an infant who was born with six\r\nteeth. Some celebrated men are supposed to have been born with teeth;\r\nLouis XIV was accredited with having two teeth at birth. Bigot, a\r\nphysician and philosopher of the sixteenth century; Boyd, the poet;\r\nValerian, Richard III, as well as some of the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans, were reputed to have had this anomaly. The significance of the\r\nnatal eruption of teeth is not always that of vigor, as many of the\r\nsubjects succumb early in life. There were two cases typical of fetal\r\ndentition shown before the Academie de Medecine de Paris. One of the\r\nsubjects had two middle incisors in the lower jaw and the other had one\r\ntooth well through. Levison saw a female born with two central incisors\r\nin the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nThomas mentions a case of antenatal development of nine teeth.  Puech,\r\nMattei, Dumas, Belluzi, and others report the eruption of teeth in the\r\nnewborn. In Dumas' case the teeth had to be extracted on account of\r\nulceration of the tongue. Instances of triple dentition late in life\r\nare quite numerous, many occurring after a hundred years. Mentzelius\r\nspeaks of a man of one hundred and ten who had nine new teeth. Lord\r\nBacon cites the case of a Countess Desmond, who when over a century old\r\nhad two new teeth; Hufeland saw an instance of dentition at one hundred\r\nand sixteen; Nitzsch speaks of one at one hundred, and the Ephemerides\r\ncontain an account of a triple dentition at one hundred and twenty.\r\nThere is an account of a country laborer who lost all his teeth by the\r\ntime he arrived at his sixtieth year of age, but about a half year\r\nafterward a new set made their appearance. Bisset mentions an account\r\nof an old woman who acquired twelve molar teeth at the age of\r\nninety-eight. Carre notes a case of dental eruption in an individual of\r\neighty-five. Mazzoti speaks of a third dentition, and Ysabeau writes of\r\ndentition of a molar at the age of ninety-two. There is a record of a\r\nphysician of the name of Slave who retained all his second teeth until\r\nthe age of eighty, when they fell out; after five years another set\r\nappeared, which he retained until his death at one hundred. In the same\r\nreport there is mentioned an old Scotchman who died at one hundred and\r\nten, whose teeth were renewed at an advanced age after he had lost his\r\nsecond teeth. One of the older journals speaks of dentition at seventy,\r\neighty-four, ninety, and one hundred and fourteen. The Philosophical\r\nTransactions of London contain accounts of dentition at seventy-five\r\nand eighty-one. Bassett tells of an old woman who had twelve molar\r\nteeth at the age of eighty-eight. In France there is recorded dentition\r\nat eighty-five and an account of an old man of seventy-three who had\r\nsix new teeth. Von Helmont relates an instance of triple dentition at\r\nthe same age. There is recorded in Germany an account of a woman of\r\nninety who had dentition at forty-seven and sixty-seven, each time a\r\nnew set of teeth appearing; Hunter and Petrequin have observed similar\r\ncases. Carter describes an example of third dentition. Lison makes a\r\ncurious observation of a sixth dentition.\r\n\r\nEdentulousness.--We have already noticed the association of congenital\r\nalopecia with edentulousness, but, strange to say, Magitot has remarked\r\nthat \"l'homme-chien,\" was the subject of defective dentition. Borellus\r\nfound atrophy of all the dental follicles in a woman of sixty who never\r\nhad possessed any teeth.  Fanton-Touvet saw a boy of nine who had never\r\nhad teeth, and Fox a woman who had but four in both jaws; Tomes cites\r\nseveral similar instances. Hutchinson speaks of a child who was\r\nperfectly edentulous as to temporary teeth, but who had the permanent\r\nteeth duly and fully erupted. Guilford describes a man of forty-eight,\r\nwho was edentulous from birth, who also totally lacked the sense of\r\nsmell, and was almost without the sense of taste; the surface of his\r\nbody was covered with fine hairs and he had never had visible\r\nperspiration. This is probably the same case quoted in the foregoing\r\nparagraph in regard to the anomalies of hair. Otto, quoted by Sedgwick,\r\nspeaks of two brothers who were both totally edentulous. It might be\r\ninteresting in this connection to note that Oudet found in a fetus at\r\nterm all the dental follicles in a process of suppuration, leaving no\r\ndoubt that, if the fetus had been born viable, it would have been\r\nedentulous. Giraldes mentions the absence of teeth in an infant of\r\nsixteen months.  Bronzet describes a child of twelve, with only half\r\nits teeth, in whom the alveolar borders receded as in age. Baumes\r\nremarks that he had seen a man who never had any teeth.\r\n\r\nThe anomalies of excessive dentition are of several varieties, those of\r\nsimple supernumerary teeth, double or triple rows, and those in\r\nanomalous positions. Ibbetson saw a child with five incisors in the\r\ninferior maxillary bone, and Fanton-Touvet describes a young lady who\r\npossessed five large incisors of the first dentition in the superior\r\nmaxilla. Rayer notes a case of dentition of four canines, which first\r\nmade their appearance after pain for eight days in the jaws and\r\nassociated with convulsions. In an Ethiopian Soemmering has seen one\r\nmolar too many on each side and in each jaw. Ploucquet and Tesmer have\r\nseen five incisors and Fanchard six. Many persons have the\r\nsupernumerary teeth parallel with their neighbors, anteriorly or\r\nposteriorly. Costa reports a case in which there were five canine teeth\r\nin the upper jaw, two placed laterally on either side, and one on the\r\nright side behind the other two. The patient was twenty-six years of\r\nage, well formed and in good health.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there is fusion of the teeth. Pliny, Bartholinus, and\r\nMelanthon pretend to have seen the union of all the teeth, making a\r\ncontinuous mass. In the \"Musee de l'ecole dentaire de Paris\" there are\r\nseveral milk-teeth, both of the superior and inferior maxilla, which\r\nare fused together. Bloch cites a case in which there were two rows of\r\nteeth in the superior maxilla.  Hellwig has observed three rows of\r\nteeth, and the Ephemerides contain an account of a similar anomaly.\r\n\r\nExtraoral Dentition.--Probably the most curious anomaly of teeth is\r\nthat in which they are found in other than normal positions.  Albinus\r\nspeaks of teeth in the nose and orbit; Borellus, in the palate;\r\nFabricius Hildanus, under the tongue; Schenck, from the palate; and\r\nthere are many similar modern records. Heister in 1743 wrote a\r\ndissertation on extraoral teeth. The following is a recent quotation:--\r\n\r\n\"In the Norsk Magazin fur Laegevidenskaben, January, 1895, it is\r\nreported that Dr. Dave, at a meeting of the Medical Society in\r\nChristiania, showed a tooth removed from the nose of a woman aged\r\nfifty-three. The patient had consulted him for ear-trouble, and the\r\ntooth was found accidentally during the routine examination.  It was\r\neasily removed, having been situated in a small depression at the\r\njunction of the floor and external wall of the nasal cavity, 22 mm.\r\nfrom the external nares. This patient had all her teeth; they were\r\nplaced somewhat far from each other. The tooth resembled a milk canine;\r\nthe end of the imperfect root was covered with a fold of mucous\r\nmembrane, with stratified epithelium. The speaker suggested that part\r\nof the mucous membrane of the mouth with its tooth-germ had become\r\nimpacted between the superior and premaxillary bones and thus cut off\r\nfrom the cavity of the mouth. Another speaker criticised this fetal\r\ndislocation and believed it to be due to an inversion--a development in\r\nthe wrong direction--by which the tooth had grown upward into the nose.\r\nThe same speaker also pointed out that the stratified epithelium of the\r\nmucous membrane did not prove a connection with the cavity of the\r\nmouth, as it is known that cylindric epithelium-cells after irritative\r\nprocesses are replaced by flat ones.\"\r\n\r\nDelpech saw a young man in 1829 who had an opening in the palatine\r\nvault occasioned by the extraction of a tooth. This opening\r\ncommunicated with the nasal fossa by a fracture of the palatine and\r\nmaxillary bones; the employment of an obturator was necessary. It is\r\nnot rare to see teeth, generally canine, make their eruption from the\r\nvault of the palate; and these teeth are not generally supernumerary,\r\nbut examples of vice and deviation of position. Fanton-Touvet, however,\r\ngives an example of a supernumerary tooth implanted in the palatine\r\narch. Branch a describes a little negro boy who had two large teeth in\r\nthe nose; his dentition was otherwise normal, but a portion of the nose\r\nwas destroyed by ulceration. Roy describes a Hindoo lad of fourteen who\r\nhad a tooth in the nose, supposed to have been a tumor. It was of the\r\ncanine type, and was covered with enamel to the junction with the root,\r\nwhich was deeply imbedded in the side and upper part of the antrum. The\r\nboy had a perfect set of permanent teeth and no deformity, swelling, or\r\ncystic formation of the jaw.  This was clearly a case of\r\nextrafollicular development and eruption of the tooth in an anomalous\r\nposition, the peculiarity being that while in other similar cases the\r\ncrown of the tooth shows itself at the floor of the nasal cavity from\r\nbelow upward, in this instance the dental follicle was transposed, the\r\neruption being from above downward. Hall cites an instance in which the\r\nright upper canine of a girl erupted in the nose. The subject showed\r\nmarked evidence of hereditary syphilis. Carver describes a child who\r\nhad a tooth growing from the lower right eyelid. The number of\r\ndeciduous teeth was perfect; although this tooth was canine it had a\r\nsomewhat bulbulous fang.\r\n\r\nOf anomalies of the head the first to be considered will be the\r\nanencephalous monsters who, strange to say, have been known to survive\r\nbirth. Clericus cites an example of life for five days in a child\r\nwithout a cerebrum. Heysham records the birth of a child without a\r\ncerebrum and remarks that it was kept alive for six days. There was a\r\nchild born alive in Italy in 1831 without a brain or a cerebellum--in\r\nfact, no cranial cavity--and yet it lived eleven hours. A somewhat\r\nsimilar case is recorded in the last century. In the Philosophical\r\nTransactions there is mentioned a child virtually born without a head\r\nwho lived four days; and Le Duc records a case of a child born without\r\nbrain, cerebellum, or medulla oblongata, and who lived half an hour.\r\nBrunet describes an anencephalous boy born at term who survived his\r\nbirth. Saviard delivered an anencephalous child at term which died in\r\nthirty-six hours. Lawrence mentions a child with brain and cranium\r\ndeficient that lived five days. Putnam speaks of a female\r\nnosencephalous monster that lived twenty-nine hours.  Angell and Elsner\r\nin March, 1895, reported a case of anencephaly, or rather\r\npseudencephaly, associated with double divergent strabismus and limbs\r\nin a state of constant spastic contraction.  The infant lived eight\r\ndays. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire cites an example of anencephaly which\r\nlived a quarter of an hour. Fauvel mentioned one that lived two hours,\r\nand Sue describes a similar instance in which life persisted for seven\r\nhours and distinct motions were noticed. Malacarne saw life in one for\r\ntwelve hours, and Mery has given a description of a child born without\r\nbrain that lived almost a full day and took nourishment. In the\r\nHotel-Dieu in Paris in 1812 Serres saw a monster of this type which\r\nlived three days, and was fed on milk and sugared water, as no nurse\r\ncould be found who was willing to suckle it.\r\n\r\nFraser mentions a brother and sister, aged twenty and thirty,\r\nrespectively, who from birth had exhibited signs of defective\r\ndevelopment of the cerebellum. They lacked power of coordination and\r\nwalked with a drunken, staggering gait; they could not touch the nose\r\nwith the finger when their eyes were shut, etc. The parents of these\r\nunfortunate persons were perfectly healthy, as were the rest of their\r\nfamily. Cruveilhier cites a case of a girl of eleven who had absolutely\r\nno cerebellum, with the same symptoms which are characteristic in such\r\ncases. There is also recorded the history of a man who was deficient in\r\nthe corpus callosum; at the age of sixty-two, though of feeble\r\nintelligence, he presented no signs of nervous disorder. Claude Bernard\r\nmade an autopsy on a woman who had no trace of olfactory lobes, and\r\nafter a minute inquiry into her life he found that her sense of smell\r\nhad been good despite her deficiency.\r\n\r\nBuhring relates the history of a case somewhat analogous to viability\r\nof anencephalous monsters. It was a bicephalous child that lived\r\nthirty-two hours after he had ligated one of its heads.\r\n\r\n{footnote} The argument that the brain is not the sole organ of the\r\nmind is in a measure substantiated by a wonderful case of a decapitated\r\nrooster, reported from Michigan. A stroke of the knife bad severed the\r\nlarynx and removed the whole mass of the cerebrum, leaving the inner\r\naspect and base of the skull exposed.  The cerebrum was partly removed;\r\nthe external auditory meatus was preserved. Immediately after the\r\ndecapitation the rooster was left to its supposed death struggles, but\r\nit ran headless to the barn, where it was secured and subsequently fed\r\nby pushing corn down its esophagus, and allowing water to trickle into\r\nthis tube from the spout of an oil-can. The phenomena exhibited by the\r\nrooster were quite interesting. It made all the motions of pecking,\r\nstrutted about, flapped its wings, attempted to crow, but, of course,\r\nwithout making any sound. It exhibited no signs of incoordination, but\r\ndid not seem to hear. A ludicrous exhibition was the absurd, sidelong\r\npas seul made toward the hens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWard mentions an instance of congenital absence of the corpora\r\ncallosum. Paget and Henry mention cases in which the corpora callosum,\r\nthe fornix, and septum lucidum were imperfectly formed.  Maunoir\r\nreports congenital malformation of the brain, consisting of almost\r\ncomplete absence of the occipital lobe. The patient died at the\r\ntwenty-eighth month. Combettes reports the case of a girl who died at\r\nthe age of eleven who had complete absence of the cerebellum in\r\naddition to other minor structural defects; this was probably the case\r\nmentioned by Cruveilhier.\r\n\r\nDiminution in volume of the head is called microcephaly. Probably the\r\nmost remarkable case on record is that mentioned by Lombroso.  The\r\nindividual was called \"l'homme-oiseau,\" or the human bird, and his\r\ncranial capacity was only 390 c.c. Lombroso speaks of another\r\nindividual called \"l'homme-lapin,\" or man-rabbit, whose cranium was\r\nonly slightly larger than that of the other, measuring 490 mm. in\r\ncircumference. Castelli alludes to endemic microcephaly among some of\r\nthe peoples of Asia. We also find it in the Caribbean Islands, and from\r\nthe skulls and portraits of the ancient Aztecs we are led to believe\r\nthat they were also microcephalic.\r\n\r\nTwo creatures of celebrity were Maximo and Bartola, who for twenty-five\r\nyears have been shown in America and in Europe under the name of the\r\n\"Aztecs\" or the \"Aztec children\". They were male and female and very\r\nshort, with heads resembling closely the bas-reliefs on the ancient\r\nAztec temples of Mexico. Their facial angle was about 45 degrees, and\r\nthey had jutting lips and little or no chin. They wore their hair in an\r\nenormous bunch to magnify the deformity. These curiosities were born in\r\nCentral America and were possibly half Indian and Negro. They were\r\nlittle better than idiots in point of intelligence.\r\n\r\nFigure 92 represents a microcephalic youth known as the \"Mexican wild\r\nboy,\" who was shown with the Wallace circus.\r\n\r\nVirchow exhibited a girl of fourteen whose face was no larger than that\r\nof a new-born child, and whose head was scarcely as large as a man's\r\nfist. Magitot reported a case of a microcephalic woman of thirty who\r\nweighed 70 pounds.\r\n\r\nHippocrates and Strabonius both speak of head-binding as a custom\r\ninducing artificial microcephaly, and some tribes of North American\r\nIndians still retain this custom.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, microcephaly is attended with associate idiocy and arrested\r\ndevelopment of the rest of the body. Ossification of the fontanelles in\r\na mature infant would necessarily prevent full development of the\r\nbrain. Osiander and others have noticed this anomaly. There are cases\r\non record in which the fontanelles have remained open until adulthood.\r\n\r\nAugmentation of the volume of the head is called macrocephaly, and\r\nthere are a number of curious examples related. Benvenuti describes an\r\nindividual, otherwise well formed, whose head began to enlarge at\r\nseven. At twenty-seven it measured over 37 inches in circumference and\r\nthe man's face was 15 inches in height; no other portion of his body\r\nincreased abnormally; his voice was normal and he was very intelligent.\r\nHe died of apoplexy at the age of thirty.\r\n\r\nFournier speaks of a cranium in the cabinet of the Natural History\r\nMuseum of Marseilles of a man by the name of Borghini, who died in\r\n1616. At the time he was described he was fifty years old, four feet in\r\nheight; his head measured three feet in circumference and one foot in\r\nheight. There was a proverb in Marseilles, \"Apas mai de sen que\r\nBorghini,\" meaning in the local dialect, \"Thou hast no more wit than\r\nBorghini.\" This man, whose fame became known all over France, was not\r\nable, as he grew older, to maintain the weight of his head, but carried\r\na cushion on each shoulder to prop it up. Fournier also quotes the\r\nhistory of a man who died in the same city in 1807 at the age of\r\nsixty-seven. His head was enormous, and he never lay on a bed for\r\nthirty years, passing his nights in a chair, generally reading or\r\nwriting. He only ate once in twenty-four or thirty hours, never warmed\r\nhimself, and never used warm water. His knowledge was said to have been\r\ngreat and encyclopedic, and he pretended never to have heard the\r\nproverb of Borghini. There is related the account of a Moor, who was\r\nseen in Tunis early in this century, thirty-one years of age, of middle\r\nheight, with a head so prodigious in dimensions that crowds flocked\r\nafter him in the streets. His nose was quite long, and his mouth so\r\nlarge that he could eat a melon as others would an apple. He was an\r\nimbecile.  William Thomas Andrews was a dwarf seventeen years old,\r\nwhose head measured in circumference 35 inches; from one external\r\nauditory meatus to another, 27 1/4 inches; from the chin over the\r\ncranial summit to the suboccipital protuberance, 37 1/2 inches; the\r\ndistance from the chin to the pubes was 20 inches; and from the pubes\r\nto the soles of the feet, 16; he was a monorchid. James Cardinal, who\r\ndied in Guy's Hospital in 1825, and who was so celebrated for the size\r\nof his head, only measured 32 1/2 inches in head-circumference.\r\n\r\nThe largest healthy brains on record, that is, of men of prominence,\r\nare those of Cuvier, weighing 64 1/3 ounces; of Daniel Webster,\r\nweighing 63 3/4 ounces (the circumference of whose head was 23 3/4\r\ninches); of Abercrombie, weighing 63 ounces, and of Spurzheim, weighing\r\n55 1/16 ounces. Byron and Cromwell had abnormally heavy brains, showing\r\nmarked evidence of disease.\r\n\r\nA curious instance in this connection is that quoted by Pigne, who\r\ngives an account of a double brain found in an infant. Keen reports\r\nfinding a fornix which, instead of being solid from side to side,\r\nconsisted of two lateral halves with a triangular space between them.\r\n\r\nWhen the augmentation of the volume of the cranium is caused by an\r\nabundant quantity of serous fluid the anomaly is known as hydrocephaly.\r\nIn this condition there is usually no change in the size of the\r\nbrain-structure itself, but often the cranial bones are rent far\r\nasunder. Minot speaks of a hydrocephalic infant whose head measured 27\r\n1/2 inches in circumference; Bright describes one whose head measured\r\n32 inches; and Klein, one 43 inches. Figure 93 represents a child of\r\nsix whose head circumference was 36 inches. Figure 94 shows a\r\nhydrocephalic adult who was exhibited through this country.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of a curious monster born of healthy half-caste\r\nAfrican parents. The deformity was caused by a deficiency of osseous\r\nmaterial of the bones of the head. There was considerable arrest of\r\ndevelopment of the parietal, temporal, and superior maxillary bones, in\r\nconsequence of which a very small amount of the cerebral substance\r\ncould be protected by the membranous expansion of the cranial centers.\r\nThe inferior maxilla and the frontal bone were both perfect; the ears\r\nwere well developed and the tongue strong and active; the nostrils were\r\nimperforate and there was no roof to the mouth nor floor to the nares.\r\nThe eyes were curiously free from eyelashes, eyelids, or brows. The\r\ncornea threatened to slough. There was double harelip on the left side;\r\nthe second and third fingers of both hands were webbed for their whole\r\nlength; the right foot wanted the distal phalanx of the great toe and\r\nthe left foot was clubbed and drawn inward. The child swallowed when\r\nfed from a spoon, appeared to hear, but exhibited no sense of light. It\r\ndied shortly after the accompanying sketch was made.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a deficiency in the osseous material of the cranium or an\r\nabnormal dilatation of the fontanelles gives rise to a hernia of the\r\nmeninges, which, if accompanied by cerebrospinal fluid in any quantity,\r\ncauses a large and peculiarly shaped tumor called meningocele. If there\r\nis a protrusion of brain-substance itself, a condition known as hernia\r\ncerebri results.\r\n\r\nComplete absence of the inferior maxilla is much rarer in man than in\r\nanimals. Nicolas and Prenant have described a curious case of this\r\nanomaly in a sheep. Gurlt has named subjects presenting the total or\r\npartial absence of the inferior maxilla, agnathes or hemiagnathes.\r\nSimple atrophy of the inferior maxilla has been seen in man as well as\r\nin the lower animals, but is much less frequent than atrophy of the\r\nsuperior maxilla. Langenbeck reports the case of a young man who had\r\nthe inferior maxilla so atrophied that in infancy it was impossible for\r\nhim to take milk from the breast. He had also almost complete\r\nimmobility of the jaws. Boullard reports a deformity of the visage,\r\nresulting in a deficiency of the condyles of the lower jaw. Maurice\r\nmade an observation on a vice of conformation of the lower jaw which\r\nrendered lactation impossible, probably causing the death of the infant\r\non this account. Tomes gives a description of a lower jaw the\r\ndevelopment of the left ramus of which had been arrested.  Canton\r\nmentions arrest of development of the left perpendicular ramus of the\r\nlower jaw combined with malformation of the external ear.\r\n\r\nExaggerated prominence of the maxillaries is called prognathism; that\r\nof the superior maxilla is seen in the North American Indians. Inferior\r\nprognathism is observed in man as well as in animals. The bull-dog, for\r\nexample, displays this, but in this instance the deformity is really\r\nsuperior brachygnathism, the superior maxilla being arrested in\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nCongenital absence of the nose is a very rare anomaly.  Maisonneuve has\r\nseen an example in an individual in which, in place of the nasal\r\nappendix, there was a plane surface perforated by two small openings a\r\nlittle less than one mm. in diameter and three mm. apart.\r\n\r\nExaggeration in volume of the nose is quite frequent. Ballonius speaks\r\nof a nose six times larger than ordinary. Viewing the Roman\r\ncelebrities, we find that Numa, to whom was given the surname\r\nPompilius, had a nose which measured six inches.  Plutarch, Lyourgus,\r\nand Solon had a similar enlargement, as had all the kings of Italy\r\nexcept Tarquin the Superb.\r\n\r\nEarly in the last century a man, Thomas Wedders (or Wadhouse), with a\r\nnose 7 1/2 inches long, was exhibited throughout Yorkshire. This man\r\nexpired as he had lived, in a condition of mind best described as the\r\nmost abject idiocy. The accompanying illustration is taken from a\r\nreproduction of an old print and is supposed to be a true likeness of\r\nthis unfortunate individual.\r\n\r\nThere are curious pathologic formations about the nose which increase\r\nits volume so enormously as to interfere with respiration and even with\r\nalimentation; but these will be spoken of in another chapter.\r\n\r\nThere have been some celebrities whose noses were undersized. The Duc\r\nde Guise, the Dauphin d'Auvergne, and William of Orange, celebrated in\r\nthe romances of chivalry, had extremely short noses.\r\n\r\nThere are a few recorded cases of congenital division of the nose.\r\nBartholinus, Borellus, and the Ephemerides speak of duplex noses.\r\nThomas of Tours has observed congenital fissure of the nose. Rikere\r\nreports the case of an infant of three weeks who possessed a\r\nsupernumerary nose on the right nasal bone near the inner canthus of\r\nthe eye. It was pear-shaped, with its base down, and was the size of\r\nthe natural nose of an infant of that age, and air passed through it.\r\nHubbell, Ronaldson, and Luscha speak of congenital occlusion of the\r\nposterior nares. Smith and Jarvis record cases of congenital occlusion\r\nof the anterior nares.\r\n\r\nAnomalies in size of the mouth are not uncommon. Fournier quotes the\r\nhistory of a man who had a mouth so large that when he opened it all\r\nhis back teeth could be seen. There is a history of a boy of seventeen\r\nwho had a preternaturally-sized mouth, the transverse diameter being 6\r\n1/2 inches. The mother claimed that the boy was born with his foot in\r\nhis mouth and to this fact attributed his deformity. The negro races\r\nare noted for their large mouths and thick lips. A negro called \"Black\r\nDiamond,\" recently exhibited in Philadelphia, could put both his fists\r\nin his mouth.\r\n\r\nMorgan reports two cases of congenital macrostoma accompanied by\r\nmalformation of the auricles and by auricular appendages. Van Duyse\r\nmentions congenital macrostoma with preauricular tumors and a dermoid\r\nof the eye. Macrostoma is sometimes produced by lateral fissures. In\r\nother cases this malformation is unilateral and the fissure ascends, in\r\nwhich instance the fissure may be accompanied by a fistula of the duct\r\nof Stensen. Sometimes there is associated with these anomalies curious\r\nterminations of the salivary ducts, either through the cheek by means\r\nof a fistula or on the anterior part of the neck.\r\n\r\nMicrostoma.--There are a few cases on record in which the mouth has\r\nbeen so small or ill-defined as not to admit of alimentation.  Molliere\r\nknew an individual of forty whose mouth was the exact size of a\r\nten-centime piece.\r\n\r\nBuchnerus records a case of congenital atresia of the mouth.  Cayley,\r\nSmith, Sourrouille, and Stankiewiez of Warsaw discuss atresia of the\r\nmouth. Cancrum oris, scarlet fever, burns, scurvy, etc., are occasional\r\ncauses that have been mentioned, the atresia in these instances taking\r\nplace at any time of life.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Lips.--The aboriginal tribes are particularly noted\r\nfor their large and thick lips, some of which people consider enormous\r\nlips signs of adornment. Elephantiasis or other pathologic hypertrophy\r\nof the labial tissues can produce revolting deformity, such as is seen\r\nin Figure 100, representing an individual who was exhibited several\r\nyears ago in Philadelphia. We have in English the expression, \"pulling\r\na long lip.\" Its origin is said to date back to a semimythical hero of\r\nKing Arthur's time, who, \"when sad at heart and melancholic,\" would let\r\none of his lips drop below his waist, while he turned the other up like\r\na cap on his head.\r\n\r\nBlot records a case of monstrous congenital hypertrophy of the superior\r\nlip in an infant of eight months. Buck successfully treated by surgical\r\noperations a case of congenital hypertrophy of the under lip, and\r\nDetmold mentions a similar result in a young lady with hypertrophy of\r\nthe lip and lower part of the nose. Murray reports an undescribed\r\nmalformation of the lower lip occurring in one family.\r\n\r\nHare-lip may be unilateral or double, and may or may not include the\r\npalatine arch. In the worst cases it extends in fissures on both sides\r\nto the orbit. In other cases the minimum degree of this deformity is\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nCongenital absence of the tongue does not necessarily make speech,\r\ntaste, or deglutition impossible. Jussieu cites the case of a girl who\r\nwas born without a tongue but who spoke very distinctly. Berdot\r\ndescribes a case in which the tongue was deficient, without apparent\r\ndisturbance of any of the functions.  Riolan mentions speech after loss\r\nof the tongue from small-pox.\r\n\r\nBoddington gives an account of Margaret Cutting, who spoke readily and\r\nintelligibly, although she had lost her tongue.  Saulquin has an\r\nobservation of a girl without a tongue who spoke, sang, and swallowed\r\nnormally. Aurran, Bartholinus, Louis, Parsons, Tulpius, and others\r\nmention speech without the presence of a tongue.\r\n\r\nPhilib reports a case in which mutism, almost simulating that of one\r\ncongenitally deaf, was due to congenital adhesions of the tongue to the\r\nfloor of the buccal cavity. Speech was established after removal of the\r\nabnormal adhesion. Routier speaks of ankylosis of the tongue of\r\nseventeen years' duration.\r\n\r\nJurist records such abnormal mobility of the tongue that the patient\r\nwas able to project the tongue into the nasopharynx.  Wherry and\r\nWinslow record similar instances.\r\n\r\nThere have been individuals with bifid tongues, after the normal type\r\nof serpents and saurians, and others who possessed a supernumerary\r\ntongue. Rev. Henry Wharton, Chaplain to Archbishop Sancroft, in his\r\njournal, written in the seventeenth century, says that he was born with\r\ntwo tongues and passed through life so, one, however, gradually\r\natrophying. In the polyclinic of Schnitzer in Vienna in 1892 Hajek\r\nobserved in a lad of twelve an accessory tongue 2.4 cm. in length and\r\neight mm. in breadth, forming a tumor at the base of the normal tongue.\r\nIt was removed by scissors, and on histologic examination proved to be\r\na true tongue with the typical tissues and constituents. Borellus,\r\nEphemerides, Eschenbach, Mortimer, Penada, and Schenck speak of double\r\ntongues, and Avicenna and Schenck have seen fissured tongues. Dolaeus\r\nrecords an instance of double tongue in a paper entitled \"De puella\r\nbilingui,\" and Beaudry and Brothers speak of cleft tongue. Braine\r\nrecords a case in which there was a large hypertrophied fold of\r\nmembrane coming from each side of the upper lip.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there is marked augmentation of the volume of the tongue.\r\nFournier has seen a juggler with a tongue so long that he could extrude\r\nit six inches from his mouth. He also refers to a woman in Berlin with\r\na long tongue, but it was thinner than that of a cat. When she laughed\r\nit hung over her teeth like a curtain, and was always extremely cold to\r\nthe touch. In the same article there is a description of a man with a\r\nvery long neck who could touch his tongue to his chest without\r\nreclining his head.  Congenital and acquired hypertrophy of the tongue\r\nwill be discussed later.\r\n\r\nAmatus Lusitanus and Portal refer to the presence of hair on the\r\ntongue, and later there was an account of a medical student who\r\ncomplained of dyspepsia and a sticky sensation in the mouth. On\r\nexamination a considerable growth of hair was found on the surface of\r\nthe tongue. The hairs would be detached in vomiting but would grow\r\nagain, and when he was last seen they were one inch long. Such are\r\npossibly nevoid in formation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary anomalies of the palate are the fissures, unilateral,\r\nbilateral, median, etc.: they are generally associated with hare-lip.\r\nThe median fissure commencing between the middle incisors is quite rare.\r\n\r\nMany curious forms of obturator or artificial palate are employed to\r\nremedy congenital defects. Sercombe mentions a case in which\r\ndestruction of the entire palate was successfully relieved by\r\nmechanical means. In some instances among the lower classes these\r\nobturators are simple pieces of wood, so fashioned as to fit into the\r\npalatine cleft, and not infrequently the obturator has been swallowed,\r\ncausing obstruction of the air-passages or occluding the esophagus.\r\n\r\nAbnormalism of the Uvula.--Examples of double uvula are found in the\r\nolder writers, and Hagendorn speaks of a man who was born without a\r\nuvula. The Ephemerides and Salmuth describe uvulae so defective as to\r\nbe hardly noticeable. Bolster, Delius, Hodges, Mackenzie of Baltimore,\r\nOrr, Riedel, Schufeldt, and Tidyman are among observers reporting\r\nbifurcated and double uvula, and they are quite common. Ogle records\r\ninstances of congenital absence of the uvula.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Epiglottis.--Morgagni mentions a man without an\r\nepiglottis who ate and spoke without difficulty. He thought the\r\narytenoids were so strongly developed that they replaced the functions\r\nof the missing organ. Enos of Brooklyn in 1854 reported absence of the\r\nepiglottis without interference with deglutition.  Manifold speaks of a\r\ncase of bifurcated epiglottis. Debloisi records an instance of\r\ncongenital web of the vocal bands.  Mackenzie removed a congenital\r\npapillomatous web which had united the vocal cords until the age of\r\ntwenty-three, thus establishing the voice. Poore also recorded a case\r\nof congenital web in the larynx. Elsberg and Scheff mention occlusion\r\nof the rima glottidis by a membrane.\r\n\r\nInstances of duplication of the epiglottis attended with a species of\r\ndouble voice possess great interest. French described a man of thirty,\r\nby occupation a singer and contortionist, who became possessed of an\r\nextra voice when he was sixteen. In high and falsetto tones he could\r\nrun the scale from A to F in an upper and lower range. The compass of\r\nthe low voice was so small that he could not reach the high notes of\r\nany song with it, and in singing he only used it to break in on the\r\nfalsetto and produce a sensation. He was supposed to possess a double\r\nepiglottis.\r\n\r\nRoe describes a young lady who could whistle at will with the lower\r\npart of her throat and without the aid of her lips.  Laryngeal\r\nexamination showed that the fundamental tones were produced by\r\nvibrations of the edges of the vocal cords, and the modifications were\r\neffected by a minute adjustment of the ventricular bands, which\r\nregulated the laryngeal opening above the cord, and pressing firmly\r\ndown closed the ventricle and acted as a damper preventing the\r\nvibrations of the cords except in their middle third. Morgan in the\r\nsame journal mentions the case of a boy of nineteen, who seemed to be\r\naffected with laryngeal catarrh, and who exhibited distinct\r\ndiphthongia. He was seen to have two glottic orifices with associate\r\nbands. The treatment was directed to the catarrh and consequent paresis\r\nof the posterior bands, and he soon lost his evidences of double voice.\r\n\r\n{footnote} The following is a description of the laryngeal formation of\r\na singer who has recently acquired considerable notice by her ability\r\nto sing notes of the highest tones and to display the greatest compass\r\nof voice. It is extracted from a Cleveland, Ohio, newspaper: \"She has\r\nunusual development of the larynx, which enables her to throw into\r\nvibration and with different degrees of rapidity the entire length of\r\nthe vocal cords or only a part thereof. But of greatest interest is her\r\nremarkable control over the muscles which regulate the division and\r\nmodification of the resonant cavities, the laryngeal, pharyngeal, oral,\r\nand nasal, and upon this depends the quality of her voice. The uvula is\r\nbifurcated, and the two divisions sometimes act independently. The\r\nepiglottis during the production of the highest notes rises upward and\r\nbackward against the posterior pharyngeal wall in such a way as almost\r\nentirely to separate the pharyngeal cavities, at the same time that it\r\ngives an unusual conformation to those resonant chambers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete absence of the eyes is a very rare anomaly. Wordsworth\r\ndescribes a baby of seven weeks, otherwise well formed and healthy,\r\nwhich had congenital absence of both eyes. The parents of this child\r\nwere in every respect healthy. There are some cases of monstrosities\r\nwith closed, adherent eyelids and absence of eyes. Holmes reports a\r\ncase of congenital absence of both eyes, the child otherwise being\r\nstrong and perfect. The child died of cholera infantum. He also reports\r\na case very similar in a female child of American parents. In a girl of\r\neight, of German parents, he reports deficiency of the external walls\r\nof each orbit, in addition to great deformity of the side of the head.\r\nHe also gives an instance of congenital paralysis of the levator\r\npalpebrae muscles in a child whose vision was perfect and who was\r\notherwise perfect. Holmes also reports a case of enormous congenital\r\nexophthalmos, in which the right eye protruded from the orbit and was\r\nno longer covered by the cornea. Kinney has an account of a child born\r\nwithout eyeballs. The delivery was normal, and there was no history of\r\nany maternal impression; the child was otherwise healthy and well\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nLandes reports the case of an infant in which both eyes were absent.\r\nThere were six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. The\r\nchild lived a few weeks. In some instances of supposed absence of the\r\neyeball the eye is present but diminutive and in the posterior portion\r\nof the orbit. There are instances of a single orbit with no eyes and\r\nalso a single orbit containing two eyes. Again we may have two orbits\r\nwith an absence of eyes but the presence of the lacrimal glands, or the\r\neyes may be present or very imperfectly developed. Mackenzie mentions\r\ncases in which the orbit was more or less completely wanting and a mass\r\nof cellular tissue in each eye.\r\n\r\nCases of living cyclopia, or individuals with one eye in the center of\r\nthe forehead after the manner of the mythical Cyclops, are quite rare.\r\nVallentini in 1884 reports a case of a male cyclopic infant which lived\r\nfor seventy-three hours. There were median fissures of the upper lip,\r\npreauricular appendages, oral deformity, and absence of the olfactory\r\nproboscis The fetus was therefore a cyclops arrhynchus, or\r\ncyclocephalus. Blok describes a new-born infant which lived for six or\r\nseven hours, having but one eye and an extremely small mouth.\r\n\r\nThe \"Four-eyed Man of Cricklade\" was a celebrated English monstrosity\r\nof whom little reliable information is obtainable. He was visited by W.\r\nDrury, who is accredited with reporting the following--\r\n\r\n\"'So wondrous a thing, such a lusus naturae, such a scorn and spite of\r\nnature I have never seen. It was a dreadful and shocking sight.' This\r\nunfortunate had four eyes placed in pairs, 'one eye above the other and\r\nall four of a dull brown, encircled with red, the pupils enormously\r\nlarge.' The vision in each organ appeared to be perfect. 'He could shut\r\nany particular eye, the other three remaining open, or, indeed, as many\r\nas he chose, each several eye seeming to be controlled by his will and\r\nacting independently of the remainder. He could also revolve each eye\r\nseparately in its orbit, looking backward with one and forward with\r\nanother, upward with one and downward with another simultaneously.' He\r\nwas of a savage, malignant disposition, delighting in ugly tricks,\r\nteasing children, torturing helpless animals, uttering profane and\r\nblasphemous words, and acting altogether like the monster, mental and\r\nphysical, that he was. 'He could play the fiddle, though in a silly\r\nsort, having his notes on the left side, while closing the right pair\r\nof eyes. He also sang, but in a rough, screeching voice not to be\r\nlistened to without disgust.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is a recent report of a child born in Paris with its eyes in the\r\ntop of its head. The infant seemed to be doing well and crowds of\r\npeople have flocked to see it. Recent reports speak of a child born in\r\nPortland, Oregon, which had a median rudimentary eye between two normal\r\neyes. Fournier describes an infant born with perfectly formed eyes, but\r\nwith adherent eyelids and closed ocular aperture. Forlenze has seen the\r\npupils adherent to the conjunctiva, and by dissection has given sight\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nDubois cites an instance of supernumerary eyelid. At the external angle\r\nof the eyelid was a fold of conjunctiva which extended 0.5 cm. in front\r\nof the conjunctiva, to which it did not adhere, therefore constituting\r\na fourth eyelid. Fano presents a similar case in a child of four\r\nmonths, in whom no other anomaly, either of organs or of vision, was\r\nobserved. On the right side, in front of the external half of the\r\nsclerotic, was observed a semilunar fold with the concavity inward, and\r\nwhich projected much more when the lower lid was depressed. When the\r\neyelid rolled inward the fold rolled with the globe, but never reached\r\nso far as the circumference of the cornea and did not interfere with\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nTotal absence of both irides has been seen in a man of eighteen.  Dixon\r\nreports a case of total aniridia with excellent sight in a woman of\r\nthirty-seven. In Guy's Hospital there was seen a case of complete\r\ncongenital absence of the iris. Hentzschel speaks of a man with\r\ncongenital absence of the iris who had five children, three of whom\r\nexhibited the same anomaly while the others were normal. Benson,\r\nBurnett, Demaux, Lawson, Morison, Reuling, Samelson, and others also\r\nreport congenital deficiency of the irides in both eyes.\r\n\r\nJeaffreson describes a female of thirty, living in India, who was\r\naffected with complete ossification of the iris. It was immovable and\r\nquite beautiful when seen through the transparent cornea; the sight was\r\nonly slightly impaired. No cause was traceable.\r\n\r\nMultiple Pupils.--More than one pupil in the eye has often been\r\nnoticed, and as many as six have been seen. They may be congenital or\r\ndue to some pathologic disturbance after birth.  Marcellus Donatus\r\nspeaks of two pupils in one eye. Beer, Fritsche, and Heuermann are\r\namong the older writers who have noticed supernumerary pupils. Higgens\r\nin 1885 described a boy whose right iris was perforated by four\r\npupils,--one above, one to the inner side, one below, and a fourth to\r\nthe outer side. The first three were slit-shaped; the fourth was the\r\nlargest and had the appearance as of the separation of the iris from\r\nits insertion. There were two pupils in the left eye, both to the outer\r\nside of the iris, one being slit-like and the other resembling the\r\nfourth pupil in the right eye. All six pupils commenced at the\r\nperiphery, extended inward, and were of different sizes. The fundus\r\ncould be clearly seen through all of the pupils, and there was no\r\nposterior staphyloma nor any choroidal changes. There was a rather high\r\ndegree of myopia. This peculiarity was evidently congenital, and no\r\ntraces of a central pupil nor marks of a past iritis could be found.\r\nClinical Sketches a contains quite an extensive article on and several\r\nillustrations of congenital anomalies of the iris.\r\n\r\nDouble crystalline lenses are sometimes seen. Fritsch and Valisneri\r\nhave seen this anomaly and there are modern references to it.\r\nWordsworth presented to the Medical Society of London six members of\r\none family, all of whom had congenital displacement of the crystalline\r\nlens outward and upward. The family consisted of a woman of fifty, two\r\nsons, thirty-five and thirty-seven, and three grandchildren--a girl of\r\nten and boys of five and seven.  The irides were tremulous.\r\n\r\nClark reports a case of congenital dislocation of both crystalline\r\nlenses. The lenses moved freely through the pupil into the anterior\r\nchambers. The condition remained unchanged for four years, when\r\nglaucoma supervened.\r\n\r\nDifferences in Color of the Two Eyes.--It is not uncommon to see people\r\nwith different colored eyes. Anastasius I had one black eye and the\r\nother blue, from whence he derived his name \"Dicore,\" by which this\r\nEmperor of the Orient was generally known. Two distinct colors have\r\nbeen seen in an iris. Berry gives a colored illustration of such a case.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of strabismus are so common that they will be passed\r\nwithout mention. Kuhn presents an exhaustive analysis of 73 cases of\r\ncongenital defects of the movements of the eyes, considered clinically\r\nand didactically. Some or all of the muscles may be absent or two or\r\nmore may be amalgamated, with anomalies of insertion, false, double, or\r\ndegenerated, etc.\r\n\r\nThe influence of heredity in the causation of congenital defects of the\r\neye is strikingly illustrated by De Beck. In three generations twelve\r\nmembers of one family had either coloboma iridis or irideremia. He\r\nperformed two operations for the cure of cataract in two brothers. The\r\noperations were attended with difficulty in all four eyes and followed\r\nby cyclitis. The result was good in one eye of each patient, the eye\r\nmost recently blind.  Posey had a case of coloboma in the macular\r\nregion in a patient who had a supernumerary tooth. He believes the\r\ndefects were inherited, as the patient's mother also had a\r\nsupernumerary tooth.\r\n\r\nNunnely reports cases of congenital malformation in three children of\r\none family. The globes of two of them (a boy and a girl) were smaller\r\nthan natural, and in the boy in addition were flattened by the action\r\nof the recti muscles and were soft; the sclera were very vascular and\r\nthe cornea, conical, the irides dull, thin, and tremulous; the pupils\r\nwere not in the axis of vision, but were to the nasal side. The elder\r\nsister had the same congenital condition, but to a lesser degree. The\r\nother boy in the family had a total absence of irides, but he could see\r\nfairly well with the left eye.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Ears.--Bilateral absence of the external ears is quite\r\nrare, although there is a species of sheep, native of China, called the\r\n\"Yungti,\" in which this anomaly is constant.  Bartholinus, Lycosthenes,\r\nPare, Schenck, and Oberteuffer have remarked on deficient external\r\nears. Guys, the celebrated Marseilles litterateur of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was born with only one ear. Chantreuil mentions obliteration\r\nof the external auditory canal in the new-born. Bannofont reports a\r\ncase of congenital imperforation of the left auditory canal existing\r\nnear the tympanic membrane with total deafness in that ear. Lloyd\r\ndescribed a fetus showing absence of the external auditory meatus on\r\nboth sides. Munro reports a case of congenital absence of the external\r\nauditory meatus of the right ear; and Richardson speaks of congenital\r\nmalformation of the external auditory apparatus of the right side.\r\nThere is an instance of absence of the auditory canal with but partial\r\nloss of hearing. Mussey reports several cases of congenitally deficient\r\nor absent aural appendages. One case was that in which there was\r\ncongenital absence of the external auditory meatus of both ears without\r\nmuch impairment of hearing. In neither ear of N. W. Goddard, aged\r\ntwenty-seven, of Vermont, reported in 1834, was there a vestige of an\r\nopening or passage in the external ear, and not even an indentation.\r\nThe Eustachian tube was closed. The integuments of the face and scalp\r\nwere capable of receiving acoustic impressions and of transmitting them\r\nto the organs of hearing. The authors know of a student of a prominent\r\nNew York University who is congenitally deficient in external ears, yet\r\nhis hearing is acute. He hides his deformity by wearing his hair long\r\nand combed over his ears.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of anomalous auricles is lost in antiquity. Figure 103\r\nrepresents the head of an aegipan in the British Museum showing a\r\nsupernumerary auricle. As a rule, supernumerary auricles are\r\npreauricular appendages. Warner, in a report of the examination of\r\n50,000 children, quoted by Ballantyne, describes 33 with supernumerary\r\nauricles, represented by sessile or pedunculated outgrowths in front of\r\nthe tragus. They are more commonly unilateral, always congenital, and\r\ncan be easily removed, giving rise to no unpleasant symptoms. They have\r\na soft and elastic consistency, and are usually composed of a hyaline\r\nor reticular cartilaginous axis covered with connective or adipose\r\ntissue and skin bearing fine hairs; sometimes both cartilage and fat\r\nare absent. They are often associated with some form of defective\r\naudition--harelip, ocular disturbance, club-feet, congenital hernia,\r\netc. These supernumerary members vary from one to five in number and\r\nare sometimes hereditary. Reverdin describes a man having a\r\nsupernumerary nipple on the right side of his chest, of whose five\r\nchildren three had preauricular appendages. Figure 104 represents a\r\ngirl with a supernumerary auricle in the neck, described in the Lancet,\r\n1888. A little girl under Birkett's care in Guy's Hospital more than\r\nanswered to Macbeth's requisition, \"Had I three ears I'd hear thee!\"\r\nsince she possessed two superfluous ones at the sides of the neck,\r\nsomewhat lower than the angle of the jaw, which were well developed as\r\nto their external contour and made up of fibrocartilage. There is\r\nmentioned the case of a boy of six months on the left side of whose\r\nneck, over the middle anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid\r\nmuscle, was a nipple-like projection 1/2 inch in length; a rod of\r\ncartilage was prolonged into it from a thin plate, which was freely\r\nmovable in the subcutaneous tissue, forming a striking analogue to an\r\nauricle.  Moxhay cites the instance of a mother who was frightened by\r\nthe sight of a boy with hideous contractions in the neck, and who gave\r\nbirth to a child with two perfect ears and three rudimentary auricles\r\non the right side, and on the left side two rudimentary auricles.\r\n\r\nIn some people there is an excessive development of the auricular\r\nmuscles, enabling them to move their ears in a manner similar to that\r\nof the lower animals. Of the celebrated instances the Abbe de Marolles,\r\nsays Vigneul-Marville, bears witness in his \"Memoires\" that the Regent\r\nCrassot could easily move his ears.  Saint Augustine mentions this\r\nanomaly.\r\n\r\nDouble tympanitic membrane is spoken of by Loeseke. There is sometimes\r\nnatural perforation of the tympanum in an otherwise perfect ear, which\r\nexplains how some people can blow tobacco-smoke from the ear. Fournier\r\nhas seen several Spaniards and Germans who could perform this feat, and\r\nknew one man who could smoke a whole cigar without losing any smoke,\r\nsince he made it leave either by his mouth, his ears, or in both ways.\r\nFournier in the same article mentions that he has seen a woman with\r\nears over four inches long.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, there have been reports of cases in which the ossicles\r\nwere deficient without causing any imperfection of hearing. Caldani\r\nmentions a case with the incus and malleus deficient, and Scarpa and\r\nTorreau quote instances of deficient ossicles. Thomka in 1895 reported\r\na case of supernumerary tympanic ossicle, the nature of which was\r\nunknown, although it was neither an inflammatory product nor a remnant\r\nof Meckel's cartilage.\r\n\r\nAbsence of the Limbs.--Those persons born without limbs are either the\r\nsubjects of intrauterine amputation or of embryonic malformation.\r\nProbably the most celebrated of this class was Marc Cazotte, otherwise\r\nknown as \"Pepin,\" who died in Paris in the last century at the age of\r\nsixty-two of a chronic intestinal disorder. He had no arms, legs, or\r\nscrotum, but from very jutting shoulders on each side were well-formed\r\nhands. His abdomen ended in a flattened buttock with badly-formed feet\r\nattached. He was exhibited before the public and was celebrated for his\r\ndexterity.  He performed nearly all the necessary actions, exhibited\r\nskilfulness in all his movements, and was credited with the ability of\r\ncoitus. He was quite intellectual, being able to write in several\r\nlanguages. His skeleton is preserved in the Musee Dupuytren. Flachsland\r\nspeaks of a woman who three times had borne children without arms and\r\nlegs. Hastings describes a living child born without any traces of arms\r\nor legs. Garlick has seen a child with neither upper nor lower\r\nextremities. In place of them were short stumps three or four inches\r\nlong, closely resembling the ordinary stumps after amputation. The\r\nhead, chest, body, and male genitals were well formed, and the child\r\nsurvived. Hutchinson reports the history of a child born without\r\nextremities, probably the result of intrauterine amputation. The flaps\r\nwere healed at the deltoid insertion and just below the groin. Pare\r\nsays he saw in Paris a man without arms, who by means of his head and\r\nneck could crack a whip or hold an axe. He ate by means of his feet,\r\ndealt and played cards, and threw dice with the same members,\r\nexhibiting such dexterity that finally his companions refused to play\r\nwith him. He was proved to be a thief and a murderer and was finally\r\nhanged at Gueldres. Pare also relates having seen a woman in Paris who\r\nsewed, embroidered, and did other things with her feet. Jansen speaks\r\nof a man in Spain, born without arms, who could use his feet as well as\r\nmost people use their arms. Schenck and Lotichius give descriptions of\r\narmless people.\r\n\r\nHulke describes a child of four whose upper limbs were absent, a small\r\ndimple only being in their place. He had free movement of the shoulders\r\nin every direction and could grasp objects between his cheeks and his\r\nacromian process; the prehensile power of the toes was well developed,\r\nas he could pick up a coin thrown to him. A monster of the same\r\nconformation was the celebrated painter, Ducornet, who was born at\r\nLille on the 10th of January, 1806. He was completely deprived of arms,\r\nbut the rest of the body was well formed with the exception of the\r\nfeet, of which the second toe was faulty. The deformity of the feet,\r\nhowever, had the happiest result, as the space between the great toe\r\nand its neighbor was much larger than ordinary and the toes much more\r\nmobile. He became so skilful in his adopted profession that he finally\r\npainted a picture eleven feet in height (representing Mary Magdalene at\r\nthe feet of Christ after the resurrection), which was purchased by the\r\nGovernment and given to the city of Lille. Broca describes James\r\nLeedgwood, who was deprived of his arms and had only one leg. He\r\nexhibited great dexterity with his single foot, wrote, discharged a\r\npistol, etc.; he was said to have been able to pick up a sewing-needle\r\non a slippery surface with his eyes blindfolded. Capitan described to\r\nthe Societe d'anthropologie de Paris a young man without arms, who was\r\nsaid to play a violin and cornet with his feet. He was able to take a\r\nkerchief from his pocket and to blow his nose; he could make a\r\ncigarette, light it, and put it in his mouth, play cards, drink from a\r\nglass, and eat with a fork by the aid of his dexterous toes. There was\r\na creature exhibited some time since in the principal cities of France,\r\nwho was called the \"l'homme tronc.\" He was totally deprived of all his\r\nmembers. Curran describes a Hindoo, a prostitute of forty, with\r\ncongenital absence of both upper extremities. A slight fleshy\r\nprotuberance depended from the cicatrix of the humerus and\r\nshoulder-joint of the left side, and until the age of ten there was one\r\non the right side. She performed many tricks with her toes. Caldani\r\nspeaks of a monster without arms, Davis mentions one, and Smith\r\ndescribes a boy of four with his upper limbs entirely absent. Breschet\r\nhas seen a child of nine with only portions of the upper arms and\r\ndeformity of lower extremities and pelvis. Pare says that he saw in\r\nParis in 1573, at the gate of St. Andrew des Arts, a boy of nine, a\r\nnative of a small village near Guise, who had no legs and whose left\r\nfoot was represented by a fleshy body hanging from the trunk; he had\r\nbut two fingers hanging on his right hand, and had between his legs\r\nwhat resembled a virile penis. Pare attributes this anomaly to a\r\ndefault in the quantity of semen.\r\n\r\nThe figure and skeleton of Harvey Leach, called \"Hervio Nono,\" is in\r\nthe museum of the University College in London. The pelvis was\r\ncomparatively weak, the femurs hardly to be recognized, and the right\r\ntibia and foot defective; the left foot was better developed, although\r\nfar from being in due proportion to the trunk above. He was one of the\r\nmost remarkable gymnasts of his day, and notwithstanding the distortion\r\nof his lower limbs had marvelous power and agility in them. As an\r\narena-horseman, either standing or sitting, he was scarcely excelled.\r\nHe walked and even ran quite well, and his power of leaping, partly\r\nwith his feet and partly with his hands, was unusual. His lower limbs\r\nwere so short that, erect, he touched the floor with his fingers, but\r\nhe earned his livelihood as much with his lower as with his upper\r\nlimbs. In his skeleton his left lower limb, between the hip and heel,\r\nmeasured 16 inches, while the right, between the same points, measured\r\nnine inches. Hare mentions a boy of five and a half whose head and\r\ntrunk were the same as in any other child of like age. He was 22 1/2\r\ninches high, had no spinal curvature, but was absolutely devoid of\r\nlower extremities. The right arm was two inches long and the left 2\r\n1/4. Each contained the head and a small adjoining portion of the\r\nhumerus. The legs were represented by masses of cellular tissue and fat\r\ncovered by skin which projected about an inch. He was intelligent, had\r\na good memory, and exhibited considerable activity. He seemed to have\r\nhad more than usual mobility and power of flexion of the lower lumbar\r\nregion. When on his back he was unable to rise up, but resting on the\r\nlower part of the pelvis he was able to maintain himself erect. He\r\nusually picked up objects with his teeth, and could hold a coin in the\r\naxilla as he rolled from place to place. His rolling was accomplished\r\nby a peculiar twisting of the thorax and bending of the pelvis. There\r\nwas no history of maternal impression during pregnancy, no injury, and\r\nno hereditary disposition to anomalous members. Figure 112 represents a\r\nboy with congenital deficiency of the lower extremities who was\r\nexhibited a few years ago in Philadelphia. In Figure 113, which\r\nrepresents a similar case in a girl whose photograph is deposited in\r\nthe Mutter Museum of the College of Physicians, Philadelphia, we see\r\nhow cleverly the congenital defect may be remedied by mechanical\r\ncontrivance. With her crutches and artificial legs this girl was said\r\nto have moved about easily.\r\n\r\nParvin describes a \"turtle-man\" as an ectromelian, almost entering the\r\nclass of phocomelians or seal-like monsters; the former term signifies\r\nabortive or imperfect formation of the members. The hands and feet were\r\nnormally developed, but the arms, forearms, and legs are much shortened.\r\n\r\nThe \"turtle-woman\" of Demerara was so called because her mother when\r\npregnant was frightened by a turtle, and also from the child's fancied\r\nresemblance to a turtle. The femur was six inches long, the woman had a\r\nfoot of six bones, four being toes, viz., the first and second\r\nphalanges of the first and second toes. She had an acetabulum, capsule,\r\nand ligamentum teres, but no tibia or fibula; she also had a defective\r\nright forearm. She was never the victim of rachitis or like disease,\r\nbut died of syphilis in the Colonial Hospital. In her twenty-second\r\nyear she was delivered of a full-grown child free of deformity.\r\n\r\nThere was a woman living in Bavaria, under the observation of Buhl, who\r\nhad congenital absence of both femurs and both fibulas.  Almost all the\r\nmuscles of the thigh existed, and the main attachment to the pelvis was\r\nby a large capsular articulation.  Charpentier gives the portrait of a\r\nwoman in whom there was a uniform diminution in the size of the limbs.\r\nDebout portrays a young man with almost complete absence of the thigh\r\nand leg, from whose right hip there depended a foot. Accrell describes\r\na peasant of twenty-six, born without a hip, thigh, or leg on the right\r\nside. The external genital organs were in their usual place, but there\r\nwas only one testicle in the scrotum. The man was virile. The rectum\r\ninstead of opening outward and underneath was deflected to the right.\r\n\r\nSupernumerary Limbs.--Haller reports several cases of supernumerary\r\nextremities. Plancus speaks of an infant with a complete third leg, and\r\nDumeril cites a similar instance.  Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire presented to\r\nthe Academie des Sciences in 1830 a child with four legs and feet who\r\nwas in good health.  Amman saw a girl with a large thigh attached to\r\nher nates. Below the thigh was a single leg made by the fusion of two\r\nlegs. No patella was found and the knee was anchylosed. One of the feet\r\nof the supernumerary limb had six toes, while the other, which was\r\nmerely an outgrowth, had two toes on it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jules Guerin, the child named Gustav Evrard was born with\r\na thigh ending in two legs and two imperfect feet depending from the\r\nleft nates.\r\n\r\nTucker describes a baby born in the Sloane Maternity in New York,\r\nOctober 1, 1894, who had a third leg hanging from a bony and fleshy\r\nunion attached to the dorsal spine. The supernumerary leg was well\r\nformed and had a left foot attached to it. Larkin and Jones mention the\r\nremoval of a meningocele and a supernumerary limb from an infant of\r\nfour months. This limb contained three fingers only, one of which did\r\nnot have a bony skeleton.\r\n\r\nPare says that on the day the Venetians and the Genevois made peace a\r\nmonster was born in Italy which had four legs of equal proportions, and\r\nbesides had two supernumerary arms from the elbows of the normal limbs.\r\nThis creature lived and was baptized.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Feet.--Hatte has seen a woman who bore a child that\r\nhad three feet. Bull gives a description of a female infant with the\r\nleft foot double or cloven. There was only one heel, but the anterior\r\nportion consisted of an anterior and a posterior part. The anterior\r\nfoot presented a great toe and four smaller ones, but deformed like an\r\nexample of talipes equinovarus.  Continuous with the outer edge of the\r\nanterior part and curving beneath it was a posterior part, looking not\r\nunlike a second foot, containing six well-formed toes situated directly\r\nbeneath the other five. The eleven toes were all perfect and none of\r\nthem were webbed.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of monsters called \"Sirens\" on account of their\r\nresemblance to the fabulous creatures of mythology of that name.  Under\r\nthe influence of compression exercised in the uterus during the early\r\nperiod of gestation fusion of the inferior extremities is effected. The\r\naccompanying illustration shows the appearance of these monsters, which\r\nare thought to resemble the enchantresses celebrated by Homer.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Hand.--Blumenbach speaks of an officer who, having\r\nlost his right hand, was subsequently presented by his wife with\r\ninfants of both sexes showing the same deformity.  Murray cites the\r\ninstance of a woman of thirty-eight, well developed, healthy, and the\r\nmother of normal children, who had a double hand. The left arm was\r\nabnormal, the flexion of the elbow imperfect, and the forearm\r\nterminated in a double hand with only rudimentary thumbs. In working as\r\na charwoman she leaned on the back of the flexed carpus. The double\r\nhand could grasp firmly, though the maximum power was not so great as\r\nthat of the right hand. Sensation was equally acute in all three of the\r\nhands. The middle and ring fingers of the supernumerary hand were\r\nwebbed as far as the proximal joints, and the movements of this hand\r\nwere stiff and imperfect. No single finger of the two hands could be\r\nextended while the other seven were flexed. Giraldes saw an infant in\r\n1864 with somewhat the same deformity, but in which the disposition of\r\nthe muscles and tendons permitted the ordinary movements.\r\n\r\nAbsence of Digits.--Maygrier describes a woman of twenty-four who\r\ninstead of having a hand on each arm had only one finger, and each foot\r\nhad but two toes. She was delivered of two female children in 1827 and\r\none in 1829, each having exactly the same deformities. Her mother was\r\nperfectly formed, but the father had but one toe on his foot and one\r\nfinger on his left hand.\r\n\r\nKohler gives photographs of quite a remarkable case of suppression and\r\ndeformity of the digits of both the fingers and toes.\r\n\r\nFigure 123 shows a man who was recently exhibited in Philadelphia. He\r\nhad but two fingers on each hand and two toes on each foot, and\r\nresembles Kohler's case in the anomalous digital conformation.\r\n\r\nFigure 124 represents an exhibitionist with congenital suppression of\r\nfour digits on each hand.\r\n\r\nTubby has seen a boy of three in whom the first, second, and third toes\r\nof each foot were suppressed, the great toe and the little toe being so\r\novergrown that they could be opposed. In this family for four\r\ngenerations 15 individuals out of 22 presented this defect of the lower\r\nextremity. The patient's brothers and a sister had exactly the same\r\ndeformity, which has been called \"lobster-claw foot.\"\r\n\r\nFalla of Jedburgh speaks of an infant who was born without forearms or\r\nhands; at the elbow there was a single finger attached by a thin string\r\nof tissue. This was the sixth child, and it presented no other\r\ndeformity. Falla also says that instances of intrauterine digital\r\namputation are occasionally seen.\r\n\r\nAccording to Annandale, supernumerary digits may be classified as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n(1) A deficient organ, loosely attached by a narrow pedicle to the hand\r\nor foot (or to another digit).\r\n\r\n(2) A more or less developed organ, free at its extremity, and\r\narticulating with the head or sides of a metacarpal, metatarsal, or\r\nphalangeal bone.\r\n\r\n(3) A fully developed separate digit.\r\n\r\n(4) A digit intimately united along its whole length with another\r\ndigit, and having either an additional metacarpal or metatarsal bone of\r\nits own, or articulating with the head of one which is common to it and\r\nanother digit.\r\n\r\nSuperstitions relative to supernumerary fingers have long been\r\nprevalent. In the days of the ancient Chaldeans it was for those of\r\nroyal birth especially that divinations relative to extra digits were\r\ncast. Among the ancients we also occasionally see illustrations\r\nemblematic of wisdom in an individual with many fingers, or rather\r\ndouble hands, on each arm.\r\n\r\nHutchinson, in his comments on a short-limbed, polydactylous dwarf\r\nwhich was dissected by Ruysch, the celebrated Amsterdam anatomist,\r\nwrites as follows.--\r\n\r\n\"This quaint figure is copied from Theodore Kerckring's 'Spicilegium\r\nAnatomicum,' published in Amsterdam in 1670. The description states\r\nthat the body was that of an infant found drowned in the river on\r\nOctober 16, 1668. It was dissected by the renowned Ruysch. A detailed\r\ndescription of the skeleton is given.  My reason for now reproducing\r\nthe plate is that it offers an important item of evidence in reference\r\nto the development of short-limbed dwarfs. Although we must not place\r\ntoo much reliance on the accuracy of the draughtsman, since he has\r\nfigured some superfluous lumbar vertebrae, yet there can be no doubt\r\nthat the limbs are much too short for the trunk and head. This remark\r\nespecially applies to the lower limbs and pelvis. These are exactly\r\nlike those of the Norwich dwarf and of the skeleton in the Heidelberg\r\nMuseum which I described in a recent number of the 'Archives.' The\r\npoint of extreme interest in the present case is that this dwarfing of\r\nthe limbs is associated with polydactylism.  Both the hands have seven\r\ndigits. The right foot has eight and the left nine. The conditions are\r\nnot exactly symmetrical, since in some instances a metacarpal or\r\nmetatarsal bone is wanting; or, to put it otherwise, two are welded\r\ntogether. It will be seen that the upper extremities are so short that\r\nthe tips of the digits will only just touch the iliac crests.\r\n\r\n\"This occurrence of short limbs with polydactylism seems to prove\r\nconclusively that the condition may be due to a modification of\r\ndevelopment of a totally different nature from rickets. It is probable\r\nthat the infant was not at full term. Among the points which the author\r\nhas noticed in his description are that the fontanelle was double its\r\nusual size; that the orbits were somewhat deformed; that the two halves\r\nof the lower jaw were already united; and that the ribs were short and\r\nbadly formed. He also, of course, draws attention to the shortness of\r\nthe limbs, the stoutness of the long bones, and the supernumerary\r\ndigits. I find no statement that the skeleton was deposited in any\r\nmuseum, but it is very possible that it is still in existence in\r\nAmsterdam, and if so it is very desirable that it should be more\r\nexactly described.\"\r\n\r\nIn Figure 126, A represents division of thumb after Guyot-Daubes, shows\r\na typical case of supernumerary fingers, and C pictures Morand's case\r\nof duplication of several toes.\r\n\r\nForster gives a sketch of a hand with nine fingers and a foot with nine\r\ntoes. Voight records an instance of 13 fingers on each hand and 12 toes\r\non each foot. Saviard saw an infant at the Hotel-Dieu in Paris in 1687\r\nwhich had 40 digits, ten on each member. Annandale relates the history\r\nof a woman who had six fingers and two thumbs on each hand, and another\r\nwho had eight toes on one foot.\r\n\r\nMeckel tells of a case in which a man had 12 fingers and 12 toes, all\r\nwell formed, and whose children and grandchildren inherited the\r\ndeformity. Mason has seen nine toes on the left foot. There is recorded\r\nthe account of a child who had 12 toes and six fingers on each hand,\r\none fractured. Braid describes talipes varus in a child of a few months\r\nwho had ten toes. There is also on record a collection of cases of from\r\nseven to ten fingers on each hand and from seven to ten toes on each\r\nfoot. Scherer gives an illustration of a female infant, otherwise\r\nnormally formed, with seven fingers on each hand, all united and\r\nbearing claw-like nails. On each foot there was a double halux and five\r\nother digits, some of which were webbed.\r\n\r\nThe influence of heredity on this anomaly is well demonstrated.\r\nReaumur was one of the first to prove this, as shown by the Kelleia\r\nfamily of Malta, and there have been many corroboratory instances\r\nreported; it is shown to last for three, four, and even five\r\ngenerations; intermarriage with normal persons finally eradicates it.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly in places where consanguineous marriages are\r\nprevalent that supernumerary digits persist in a family. The family of\r\nFoldi in the tribe of Hyabites living in Arabia are very numerous and\r\nconfine their marriages to their tribe. They all have 24 digits, and\r\ninfants born with the normal number are sacrificed as being the\r\noffspring of adultery. The inhabitants of the village of Eycaux in\r\nFrance, at the end of the last century, had nearly all supernumerary\r\ndigits either on the hands or feet.  Being isolated in an inaccessible\r\nand mountainous region, they had for many years intermarried and thus\r\nperpetuated the anomaly.  Communication being opened, they emigrated or\r\nmarried strangers and the sexdigitism vanished. Maupertuis recalls the\r\nhistory of a family living in Berlin whose members had 24 digits for\r\nmany generations. One of them being presented with a normal infant\r\nrefused to acknowledge it. There is an instance in the Western United\r\nStates in which supernumerary digits have lasted through five\r\ngenerations. Cameron speaks of two children in the same family who were\r\npolydactylic, though not having the same number of supernumerary\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nSmith and Norwell report the case of a boy of fifteen both of whose\r\nhands showed webbing of the middle and ring fingers and accessory\r\nnodules of bone between the metacarpals, and six toes on each foot. The\r\nboy's father showed similar malformations, and in five generations 21\r\nout of 28 individuals were thus malformed, ten females and 11 males.\r\nThe deformity was especially transmitted in the female line.\r\n\r\nInstances of supernumerary thumbs are cited by Panaroli, Ephemerides,\r\nMunconys, as well as in numerous journals since.  This anomaly is not\r\nconfined to man alone; apes, dogs, and other lower animals possess it.\r\nBucephalus, the celebrated horse of Alexander, and the horse of Caesar\r\nwere said to have been cloven-hoofed.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the digits is the result of many different processes,\r\nand true hypertrophy or gigantism must be differentiated from\r\nacromegaly, elephantiasis, leontiasis, and arthritis deformans, for\r\nwhich distinction the reader is referred to an article by Park. Park\r\nalso calls attention to the difference between acquired gigantism,\r\nparticularly of the finger and toes, and another condition of\r\ncongenital gigantism, in which either after or before birth there is a\r\nrelatively disproportionate, sometimes enormous, overgrowth of perhaps\r\none finger or two, perhaps of a limited portion of a hand or foot, or\r\npossibly of a part of one of the limbs. The best collection of this\r\nkind of specimens is in the College of Surgeons in London.\r\n\r\nCurling quotes a most peculiar instance of hypertrophy of the fingers\r\nin a sickly girl. The middle and ring fingers of the right hand were of\r\nunusual size, the middle finger measuring 5 1/2 inches in length four\r\ninches in circumference. On the left hand the thumb and middle fingers\r\nwere hypertrophied and the index finger was as long as the middle one\r\nof the right hand. The middle finger had a lateral curvature outward,\r\ndue to a displacement of the extensor tendon. This affection resembled\r\nacromegaly. Curling cites similar cases, one in a Spanish gentleman,\r\nGovernor of Luzon, in the Philippine Islands, in 1850, who had an\r\nextraordinary middle finger, which he concealed by carrying it in the\r\nbreast of his coat.\r\n\r\nHutchinson exhibited a photograph showing the absence of the radius and\r\nthumb, with shortening of the forearm. Conditions more or less\r\napproaching this had occurred in several members of the same family. In\r\nsome they were associated with defects of development in the lower\r\nextremities also.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of club-foot--talipes varus, valgus, equinus,\r\nequino-varus, etc.--are so well known that they will be passed with\r\nmention only of a few persons who have been noted for their activity\r\ndespite their deformity. Tyrtee, Parini, Byron, and Scott are among the\r\npoets who were club-footed; some writers say that Shakespeare suffered\r\nin a slight degree from this deformity.  Agesilas, Genserie, Robert II,\r\nDuke of Normandy, Henry II, Emperor of the West, Otto II, Duke of\r\nBrunswick, Charles II, King of Naples, and Tamerlane were victims of\r\ndeformed feet. Mlle.  Valliere, the mistress of Louis XIV, was supposed\r\nto have both club-foot and hip-disease. Genu valgum and genu varum are\r\nordinary deformities and quite common in all classes.\r\n\r\nTranspositions of the character of the vertebrae are sometimes seen. In\r\nman the lumbar vertebrae have sometimes assumed the character of the\r\nsacral vertebrae, the sacral vertebrae presenting the aspect of lumbar\r\nvertebrae, etc. It is quite common to see the first lumbar vertebra\r\npresenting certain characteristics of the dorsal.\r\n\r\nNumerical anomalies of the vertebrae are quite common, generally in the\r\nlumbar and dorsal regions, being quite rare in the cervical, although\r\nthere have been instances of six or eight cervical vertebrae. In the\r\nlower animals the vertebrae are prolonged into a tail, which, however,\r\nis sometimes absent, particularly when hereditary influence exists. It\r\nhas been noticed in the class of dogs whose tails are habitually\r\namputated to improve their appearance that the tail gradually decreases\r\nin length. Some breeders deny this fact.\r\n\r\nHuman Tails.--The prolongation of the coccyx sometimes takes the shape\r\nof a caudal extremity in man. Broca and others claim that the sacrum\r\nand the coccyx represent the normal tail of man, but examples are not\r\ninfrequent in which there has been a fleshy or bony tail appended to\r\nthe coccygeal region. Traditions of tailed men are old and widespread,\r\nand tailed races were supposed to reside in almost every country. There\r\nwas at one time an ancient belief that all Cornishmen had tails, and\r\ncertain men of Kent were said to have been afflicted with tails in\r\nretribution for their insults to Thomas a Becket. Struys, a Dutch\r\ntraveler in Formosa in the seventeenth century, describes a wild man\r\ncaught and tied for execution who had a tail more than a foot long,\r\nwhich was covered with red hair like that of a cow.\r\n\r\nThe Niam Niams of Central Africa are reported to have tails smooth and\r\nhairy and from two to ten inches long. Hubsch of Constantinople remarks\r\nthat both men and women of this tribe have tails. Carpus, or\r\nBerengarius Carpensis, as he is called, in one of his Commentaries said\r\nthat there were some people in Hibernia with long tails, but whether\r\nthey were fleshy or cartilaginous could not be known, as the people\r\ncould not be approached.  Certain supposed tailed races which have been\r\ndescribed by sea-captains and voyagers are really only examples of\r\npeople who wear artificial appendages about the waists, such as\r\npalm-leaves and hair. A certain Wesleyan missionary, George Brown, in\r\n1876 spoke of a formal breeding of a tailed race in Kali, off the coast\r\nof New Britain. Tailless children were slain at once, as they would be\r\nexposed to public ridicule. The tailed men of Borneo are people\r\nafflicted with hereditary malformation analogous to sexdigitism. A\r\ntailed race of princes have ruled Rajoopootana, and are fond of their\r\nancestral mark. There are fabulous stories told of canoes in the East\r\nIndies which have holes in their benches made for the tails of the\r\nrowers. At one time in the East the presence of tails was taken as a\r\nsign of brute force.\r\n\r\nThere was reported from Caracas the discovery of a tribe of Indians in\r\nParaguay who were provided with tails. The narrative reads somewhat\r\nafter this manner: One day a number of workmen belonging to Tacura Tuyn\r\nwhile engaged in cutting grass had their mules attacked by some\r\nGuayacuyan Indians. The workmen pursued the Indians but only succeeded\r\nin capturing a boy of eight. He was taken to the house of Senor\r\nFrancisco Galeochoa at Posedas, and was there discovered to have a tail\r\nten inches long. On interrogation the boy stated that he had a brother\r\nwho had a tail as long as his own, and that all the tribe had tails.\r\n\r\nAetius, Bartholinus, Falk, Harvey, Kolping, Hesse, Paulinus, Strauss,\r\nand Wolff give descriptions of tails. Blanchard says he saw a tail\r\nfully a span in length: and there is a description in 1690 of a man by\r\nthe name of Emanuel Konig, a son of a doctor of laws who had a tail\r\nhalf a span long, which grew directly downward from the coccyx and was\r\ncoiled on the perineum, causing much discomfort. Jacob describes a\r\npouch of skin resembling a tail which hung from the tip of the coccyx\r\nto the length of six inches. It was removed and was found to be thicker\r\nthan the thumb, consisted of distinctly jointed portions with synovial\r\ncapsules. Gosselin saw at his clinic a caudal appendix in an infant\r\nwhich measured about ten cm. Lissner says that in 1872 he assisted in\r\nthe delivery of a young girl who had a tail consisting of a coccyx\r\nprolonged and covered with skin, and in 1884 he saw the same girl, at\r\nthis time the tail measuring nearly 13 cm.\r\n\r\nVirchow received for examination a tail three inches long amputated\r\nfrom a boy of eight weeks. Ornstein, chief physician of the Greek army,\r\ndescribes a Greek of twenty-six who had a hairless, conical tail, free\r\nonly at the tip, two inches long and containing three vertebrae. He\r\nalso remarks that other instances have been observed in recruits. Thirk\r\nof Broussa in 1820 described the tail of a Kurd of twenty-two which\r\ncontained four vertebrae. Belinovski gives an account of a hip-joint\r\namputation and extirpation of a fatty caudal extremity, the only one he\r\nhad ever observed.\r\n\r\nBefore the Berlin Anthropological Society there were presented two\r\nadult male Papuans, in good health and spirits, who had been brought\r\nfrom New Guinea; their coccygeal bones projected 1 1/2 inches. Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes in the Atlantic Monthly, June, 1890, says that he saw in\r\nLondon a photograph of a boy with a considerable tail. The \"Moi Boy\"\r\nwas a lad of twelve, who was found in Cochin China, with a tail a foot\r\nlong which was simply a mass of flesh. Miller tells of a West Point\r\nstudent who had an elongation of the coccyx, forming a protuberance\r\nwhich bulged very visibly under the skin. Exercise at the riding school\r\nalways gave him great distress, and the protuberance would often chafe\r\nuntil the skin was broken, the blood trickling into his boots.\r\n\r\nBartels presents a very complete article in which he describes 21\r\npersons born with tails, most of the tails being merely fleshy\r\nprotuberances. Darwin speaks of a person with a fleshy tail and refers\r\nto a French article on human tails.\r\n\r\nScience contains a description of a negro child born near Louisville,\r\neight weeks old, with a pedunculated tail 2 1/2 inches long, with a\r\nbase 1 1/4 inches in circumference. The tail resembled in shape a pig's\r\ntail and had grown 1/4 inch since birth. It showed no signs of\r\ncartilage or bone, and had its origin from a point slightly to the left\r\nof the median line and about an inch above the end of the spinal column.\r\n\r\nDickinson recently reported the birth of a child with a tail. It was a\r\nwell-developed female between 5 1/2 and six pounds in weight. The\r\ncoccyx was covered with the skin on both the anterior and posterior\r\nsurfaces. It thus formed a tail of the size of the nail of the little\r\nfinger, with a length of nearly 3/16 inch on the inner surface and 3/8\r\ninch on the rear surface. This little tip could be raised from the body\r\nand it slowly sank back.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the familiar caudal projection of the human fetus,\r\nDickinson mentions a group of other vestigial remains of a former state\r\nof things. Briefly these are:--\r\n\r\n(1) The plica semilunaris as a vestige of the nictitating membrane of\r\ncertain birds.\r\n\r\n(2) The pointed ear, or the turned-down tip of the ears of many men.\r\n\r\n(3) The atrophied muscles, such as those that move the ear, that are\r\nwell developed in certain people, or that shift the scalp, resembling\r\nthe action of a horse in ridding itself of flies.\r\n\r\n(4) The supracondyloid foremen of the humerus.\r\n\r\n(5) The vermiform appendix.\r\n\r\n(6) The location and direction of the hair on the trunk and limbs.\r\n\r\n(7) The dwindling wisdom-teeth.\r\n\r\n(8) The feet of the fetus strongly deflected inward, as in the apes,\r\nand persisting in the early months of life, together with great\r\nmobility and a distinct projection of the great toe at an angle from\r\nthe side of the foot.\r\n\r\n(9) The remarkable grasping power of the hand at birth and for a few\r\nweeks thereafter, that permits young babies to suspend their whole\r\nweight on a cane for a period varying from half a minute to two minutes.\r\n\r\nHorrocks ascribes to these anal tags a pathologic importance. He claims\r\nthat they may be productive of fistula in ano, superficial ulcerations,\r\nfecal concretions, fissure in ano, and that they may hypertrophy and\r\nset up tenesmus and other troubles. The presence of human tails has\r\ngiven rise to discussion between friends and opponents of the Darwinian\r\ntheory. By some it is considered a reversion to the lower species,\r\nwhile others deny this and claim it to be simply a pathologic appendix.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Spinal Canal and Contents.--When there is a default in\r\nthe spinal column, the vice of conformation is called spina bifida.\r\nThis is of two classes: first, a simple opening in the vertebral canal,\r\nand, second, a large cleft sufficient to allow the egress of spinal\r\nmembranes and substance. Figure 130 represents a large congenital\r\nsacral tumor.\r\n\r\nAchard speaks of partial duplication of the central canal of the spinal\r\ncord. De Cecco reports a singular case of duplication of the lumbar\r\nsegment of the spinal cord. Wagner speaks of duplication of a portion\r\nof the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nFoot records a case of amyelia, or absence of the spinal cord, in a\r\nfetus with hernia cerebri and complete fissure of the spinal column.\r\nNicoll and Arnold describe an anencephalous fetus with absence of\r\nspinal marrow; and Smith also records the birth of an amyelitic fetus.\r\n\r\nIn some persons there are exaggerated curvatures of the spine.  The\r\nfirst of these curvatures is called kyphosis, in which the curvature is\r\nposterior; second, lordosis, in which the curvature is anterior; third,\r\nscoliosis, in which it is lateral, to the right or left.\r\n\r\nKyphosis is the most common of the deviations in man and is most often\r\nfound in the dorsal region, although it may be in the lumbar region.\r\nCongenital kyphosis is very rare in man, is generally seen in monsters,\r\nand when it does exist is usually accompanied by lordosis or spine\r\nbifida. We sometimes observe a condition of anterior curvature of the\r\nlumbar and sacral regions, which might be taken for a congenital\r\nlordosis, but this is really a deformity produced after birth by the\r\nphysiologic weight of the body. Figure 131 represents a case of\r\nlordosis caused by paralysis of the spinal muscles.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to this is what the accoucheurs call spondylolisthesis.\r\nScoliosis may be a cervicodorsal, dorsolumbar, or lumbosacral curve,\r\nand the inclination of the vertebral column may be to the right or\r\nleft. The pathologists divide scoliosis into a myopathic variety, in\r\nwhich the trouble is a physiologic antagonism of the muscles; or\r\nosteopathic, ordinarily associated with rachitis, which latter variety\r\nis generally accountable for congenital scoliosis. In some cases the\r\ndiameter of the chest is shortened to an almost incredible degree, but\r\nmay yet be compatible with life. Glover speaks of an extraordinary\r\ndeformity of the chest with lateral curvature of the spine, in which\r\nthe diameter from the pit of the stomach to the spinal integument was\r\nonly 5 1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nSupernumerary ribs are not at all uncommon in man, nearly every medical\r\nmuseum having some examples. Cervical ribs are not rare.  Gordon\r\ndescribes a young man of seventeen in whom there was a pair of\r\nsupernumerary ribs attached to the cervical vertebrae.  Bernhardt\r\nmentions an instance in which cervical ribs caused motor and sensory\r\ndisturbances. Dumerin of Lyons showed an infant of eight days which had\r\nan arrested development of the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th ribs. Cases of\r\ndeficient ribs are occasionally met.  Wistar in 1818 gives an account\r\nof a person in whom one side of the thorax was at rest while the other\r\nperformed the movements of breathing in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we see fissure of the sternum, caused either by deficient\r\nunion or absence of one of its constituent parts. In the most\r\nexaggerated cases these fissures permit the exit of the heart, and as a\r\ngeneral rule ectopies of the heart are thus caused. Pavy has given a\r\nmost remarkable case of sternal fissure in a young man of twenty-five,\r\na native of Hamburg. He exhibited himself in one medical clinic after\r\nanother all over Europe, and was always viewed with the greatest\r\ninterest. In the median line, corresponding to the absence of sternum,\r\nwas a longitudinal groove bounded on either side by a continuous hard\r\nridge which articulated with the costal cartilages. The skin passed\r\nnaturally over the chest from one side to another, but was raised at\r\none part of the groove by a pulsatile swelling which occupied the\r\nposition of the right auricle. The clavicle and the two margins of the\r\nsternum had no connections whatever, and below the groove was a hard\r\nsubstance corresponding to the ensiform cartilage, which, however, was\r\nvery elastic, and allowed the patient, under the influence of the\r\npectoral muscles, when the upper extremity was fixed, to open the\r\ngroove to nearly the extent of three inches, which was more than twice\r\nits natural width. By approximating his arms he made the ends of his\r\nclavicles overlap.  When he coughed, the right lung suddenly protruded\r\nfrom the chest through the groove and ascended a considerable distance\r\nabove the clavicle into the neck. Between the clavicles another\r\npulsatile swelling was easily felt but hardly seen, which was doubtless\r\nthe arch of the aorta, as by putting the fingers on it one could feel a\r\ndouble shock, synchronous with distention and recoil of a vessel or\r\nopening and closing of the semilunar valves.\r\n\r\nMadden pictures (Figs. 134 and 135) a Swede of forty with congenital\r\nabsence of osseous structure in the middle line of the sternum, leaving\r\na fissure 5 3/8 X 1 3/16 X 2 inches, the longest diameter being\r\nvertical. Madden also mentions several analogous instances on record.\r\nGroux's case was in a person of forty-five, and the fissure had the\r\nvertical length of four inches. Hodgen of St. Louis reports a case in\r\nwhich there was exstrophy of the heart through the fissure. Slocum\r\nreports the occurrence of a sternal fissure 3 X 1 1/2 inches in an\r\nIrishman of twenty-five.  Madden also cites the case of Abbott in an\r\nadult negress and a mother. Obermeier mentions several cases. Gibson\r\nand Malet describe a presternal fissure uncovering the base of the\r\nheart.  Ziemssen, Wrany, and Williams also record congenital fissures\r\nof the sternum.\r\n\r\nThomson has collected 86 cases of thoracic defects and summarizes his\r\npaper by saying that the structures deficient are generally the hair in\r\nthe mammary and axillary regions, the subcutaneous fat over the\r\nmuscles, nipples, and breasts, the pectorals and adjacent muscles, the\r\ncostal cartilages and anterior ends of ribs, the hand and forearm; he\r\nalso adds that there may be a hernia of the lung, not hereditary, but\r\nprobably due to the pressure of the arm against the chest. De Marque\r\ngives a curious instance in which the chin and chest were congenitally\r\nfastened together. Muirhead cites an instance in which a firm, broad\r\nstrip of cartilage resembling sternomastoid extended from below the\r\nleft ear to the left upper corner of the sternum, being entirely\r\nseparate from the jaw.\r\n\r\nSome preliminary knowledge of embryology is essential to understand the\r\nformation of branchial fissures, and we refer the reader to any of the\r\nstandard works on embryology for this information. Dzondi was one of\r\nthe first to recognize and classify congenital fistulas of the neck.\r\nThe proper classification is into lateral and median fissures. In a\r\ncase studied by Fevrier the exploration of a lateral pharyngeal fistula\r\nproduced by the introduction of the sound violent reflex phenomena,\r\nsuch as pallor of the face and irregular, violent beating of the heart.\r\nThe rarest of the lateral class is the preauricular fissure, which has\r\nbeen observed by Fevrier, Le Dentu, Marchand, Peyrot, and Routier.\r\n\r\nThe median congenital fissures of the neck are probably caused by\r\ndefective union of the branchial arches, although Arndt thinks that he\r\nsees in these median fistulas a persistence of the hypobranchial furrow\r\nwhich exists normally in the amphioxus. They are less frequent than the\r\npreceding variety.\r\n\r\nThe most typical form of malformation of the esophagus is imperforation\r\nor obliteration. Van Cuyck of Brussels in 1824 delivered a child which\r\ndied on the third day from malnutrition.  Postmortem it was found that\r\nthe inferior extremity of the esophagus to the extent of about two\r\ninches was converted into a ligamentous cord. Porro describes a case of\r\ncongenital obliteration of the esophagus which ended in a cecal pouch\r\nabout one inch below the inferior portion of the glottidean aperture\r\nand from this point to the stomach only measured an inch; there was\r\nalso tracheal communication. The child was noticed to take to the\r\nbreast with avidity, but after a little suckling it would cough, become\r\nlivid, and reject most of the milk through the nose, in this way almost\r\nsuffocating at each paroxysm; it died on the third day.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the esophagus is divided, one portion opening into the\r\nbronchial or other thoracic organs. Brentano describes an infant dying\r\nten days after birth whose esophagus was divided into two portions, one\r\nterminating in a culdesac, the other opening into the bronchi; the left\r\nkidney was also displaced downward. Blasius describes an anomalous case\r\nof duplication of the esophagus. Grashuys, and subsequently Vicq\r\nd'Azir, saw a dilatation of the esophagus resembling the crop of a bird.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Lungs.--Carper describes a fetus of thirty-seven weeks\r\nin whose thorax he found a very voluminous thymus gland but no lungs.\r\nThese organs were simply represented by two little oval bodies having\r\nno lobes, with the color of the tissue of the liver. The heart had only\r\none cavity but all the other organs were perfectly formed. This case\r\nseems to be unique. Tichomiroff records the case of a woman of\r\ntwenty-four who died of pneumonia in whom the left lung was entirely\r\nmissing. No traces of a left bronchus existed. The subject was very\r\npoorly developed physically. Tichomiroff finds four other cases in\r\nliterature, in all of which the left lung was absent. Theremin and\r\nTyson record cases of the absence of the left lung.\r\n\r\nSupplementary pulmonary lobes are occasionally seen in man and are\r\ntaken by some authorities to be examples of retrogressive anomalies\r\ntending to prove that the derivation of the human race is from the\r\nquadrupeds which show analogous pulmonary malformation. Eckley reports\r\nan instance of supernumerary lobe of the right lung in close connection\r\nwith the vena azygos major.  Collins mentions a similar case. Bonnet\r\nand Edwards speak of instances of four lobes in the right lung. Testut\r\nand Marcondes report a description of a lung with six lobes.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Diaphragm.--Diemerbroeck is said to have dissected a\r\nhuman subject in whom the diaphragm and mediastinum were apparently\r\nmissing, but such cases must be very rare, although we frequently find\r\nmarked deficiency of this organ.  Bouchand reports an instance of\r\nabsence of the right half of the diaphragm in an infant born at term.\r\nLawrence mentions congenital deficiency of the muscular fibers of the\r\nleft half of the diaphragm with displacement of the stomach. The\r\npatient died of double pneumonia. Carruthers, McClintock, Polaillon,\r\nand van Geison also record instances of congenital deficiency of part\r\nof the diaphragm. Recently Dittel reported unilateral defect in the\r\ndiaphragm of an infant that died soon after birth. The stomach, small\r\nintestines, and part of the large omentum lay in the left pleural\r\ncavity; both the phrenic nerves were normal. Many similar cases of\r\ndiaphragmatic hernia have been observed. In such cases the opening may\r\nbe large enough to allow a great part of the visceral constituents to\r\npass into the thorax, sometimes seriously interfering with respiration\r\nand circulation by the pressure which ensues. Alderson reports a fatal\r\ncase of diaphragmatic hernia with symptoms of pneumothorax. The\r\nstomach, spleen, omentum, and transverse colon were found lying in the\r\nleft pleura. Berchon mentions double perforation of the diaphragm with\r\nhernia of the epiploon. The most extensive paper on this subject was\r\ncontributed by Bodwitch, who, besides reporting an instance in the\r\nMassachusetts General Hospital, gives a numerical analysis of all the\r\ncases of this affection found recorded in the writings of medical\r\nauthors between the years 1610 and 1846.  Hillier speaks of an instance\r\nof congenital diaphragmatic hernia in which nearly all the small\r\nintestines and two-thirds of the large passed into the right side of\r\nthe thorax. Macnab reports an instance in which three years after the\r\ncure of empyema the whole stomach constituted the hernia. Recently Joly\r\ndescribed congenital hernia of the stomach in a man of thirty-seven,\r\nwho died from collapse following lymphangitis, persistent vomiting, and\r\ndiarrhea. At the postmortem there was found a defect in the diaphragm\r\non the left side, permitting herniation of the stomach and first part\r\nof the duodenum into the left pleural cavity.  There was no history of\r\ntraumatism to account for strangulation.  Longworth cites an instance\r\nof inversion of the diaphragm in a human subject. Bartholinus mentions\r\ncoalition of the diaphragm and liver; and similar cases are spoken of\r\nby Morgagni and the Ephemerides. Hoffman describes diaphragmatic\r\njunction with the lung.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Stomach.--The Ephemerides contains the account of a\r\ndissection in which the stomach was found wanting, and also speaks of\r\ntwo instances of duplex stomach. Bartholinus, Heister, Hufeland,\r\nMorgagni, Riolan, and Sandifort cite examples of duplex stomach. Bonet\r\nspeaks of a case of vomiting which was caused by a double stomach.\r\nStruthers reports two cases in which there were two cavities to the\r\nstomach. Struthers also mentions that Morgagni, Home, Monro, Palmer,\r\nLarry, Blasius, Hufeland, and Walther also record instances in which\r\nthere was contraction in the middle of the stomach, accounting for\r\ntheir instances of duplex stomach. Musser reports an instance of\r\nhour-glass contraction of the stomach. Hart dissected the stomach of a\r\nwoman of thirty which resembled the stomach of a predaceous bird, with\r\npatches of tendon on its surface. The right extremity instead of\r\ncontinuously contracting ended in a culdesac one-half as large as the\r\ngreater end of the stomach. The duodenum proceeded from the depression\r\nmarking the lesser arch of the organ midway between the cardiac orifice\r\nand the right extremity. Crooks speaks of a case in which the stomach\r\nof an infant terminated in a culdesac.\r\n\r\nHernia of the stomach is not uncommon, especially in diaphragmatic or\r\numbilical deficiency. There are many cases on record, some terminating\r\nfatally from strangulation or exposure to traumatism. Paterson reports\r\na case of congenital hernia of the stomach into the left portion of the\r\nthoracic cavity. It was covered with fat and occupied the whole left\r\nhalf of the thoracic cavity. The spleen, pancreas, and transverse colon\r\nwere also superior to the diaphragm. Death was caused by a well-defined\r\nround perforation at the cardiac curvature the size of a sixpence.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Intestines.--The Ephemerides contains the account of\r\nan example of double cecum, and Alexander speaks of a double colon, and\r\nthere are other cases of duplication of the bowel recorded. There is an\r\ninstance of coalition of the jejunum with the liver, and Treuner\r\nparallels this case. Aubery, Charrier Poelman, and others speak of\r\ncongenital division of the intestinal canal. Congenital occlusion is\r\nquite frequently reported.\r\n\r\nDilatation of the colon frequently occurs as a transient affection, and\r\nby its action in pushing up the diaphragm may so seriously interfere\r\nwith the action of the heart and lungs as to occasionally cause\r\nheart-failure. Fenwick has mentioned an instance of this nature.\r\nAccording to Osler there is a chronic form of dilatation of the colon\r\nin which the gut may reach an enormous size. The coats may be\r\nhypertrophied without evidence of any special organic change in the\r\nmucosa. The most remarkable instance has been reported by Formad. The\r\npatient, known as the \"balloon-man,\" aged twenty-three at the time of\r\nhis death, had had a distended abdomen from infancy. Postmortem the\r\ncolon was found as large as that of an ox, the circumference ranging\r\nfrom 15 to 30 inches. The weight of the contents was 47 pounds. Cases\r\nare not uncommon in children. Osler reports three well-marked cases\r\nunder his care. Chapman mentions a case in which the liver was\r\ndisplaced by dilatation of the sigmoid flexure. Mya reports two cases\r\nof congenital dilatation and hypertrophy of the colon (megacolon\r\ncongenito). Hirsohsprung, Genersich, Faralli, Walker, and Griffiths all\r\nrecord similar instances, and in all these cases the clinical features\r\nwere obstinate constipation and marked meteorismus.\r\n\r\nImperforate Anus.--Cases in which the anus is imperforate or the rectum\r\nends in a blind pouch are occasionally seen. In some instances the\r\nrectum is entirely absent, the colon being the termination of the\r\nintestinal tract. There are cases on record in which the rectum\r\ncommunicated with the anus solely by a fibromuscular cord. Anorectal\r\natresia is the ordinary imperforation of the anus, in which the rectum\r\nterminates in the middle of the sacral cavity. The rectum may be\r\ndeficient from the superior third of the sacrum, and in this position\r\nis quite inaccessible for operation.\r\n\r\nA compensatory coalition of the bowel with the bladder or urethra is\r\nsometimes present, and in these cases the feces are voided by the\r\nurinary passages. Huxham mentions the fusion of the rectum and colon\r\nwith the bladder, and similar instances are reported by Dumas and\r\nBaillie. Zacutus Lusitanus describes an infant with an imperforate\r\nmembrane over its anus who voided feces through the urethra for three\r\nmonths. After puncture of the membrane, the discharge came through the\r\nnatural passage and the child lived; Morgagni mentions a somewhat\r\nsimilar case in a little girl living in Bologna, and other modern\r\ninstances have been reported. The rectum may terminate in the vagina.\r\nMasters has seen a child who lived nine days in whom the sigmoid\r\nflexure of the colon terminated in the fundus of the bladder. Guinard\r\npictures a case in which there was communication between the rectum and\r\nthe bladder. In Figure 140 a represents the rectum; b the bladder; c\r\nthe point of communication; g shows the cellular tissue of the scrotum.\r\n\r\nThere is a description of a girl of fourteen, otherwise well\r\nconstituted and healthy, who had neither external genital organs nor\r\nanus. There was a plain dermal covering over the genital and anal\r\nregion. She ate regularly, but every three days she experienced pain in\r\nthe umbilicus and much intestinal irritation, followed by severe\r\nvomiting of stercoraceous matter; the pains then ceased and she\r\ncleansed her mouth with aromatic washes, remaining well until the\r\nfollowing third day. Some of the urine was evacuated by the mammae. The\r\nexaminers displayed much desire to see her after puberty to note the\r\ndisposition of the menstrual flow, but no further observation of her\r\ncase can be found.\r\n\r\nFournier narrates that he was called by three students, who had been\r\ntrying to deliver a woman for five days. He found a well-constituted\r\nwoman of twenty-two in horrible agony, who they said had not had a\r\npassage of the bowels for eight days, so he prescribed an enema. The\r\nstudent who was directed to give the enema found to his surprise that\r\nthere was no anus, but by putting his finger in the vagina he could\r\ndiscern the floating end of the rectum, which was full of feces. There\r\nwas an opening in this suspended rectum about the size of an\r\nundistended anus.  Lavage was practiced by a cannula introduced through\r\nthe opening, and a great number of cherry stones agglutinated with\r\nfeces followed the water, and labor was soon terminated. The woman\r\nafterward confessed that she was perfectly aware of her deformity, but\r\nwas ashamed to disclose it before. There was an analogue of this case\r\nfound by Mercurialis in a child of a Jew called Teutonicus.\r\n\r\nGerster reports a rare form of imperforate anus, with malposition of\r\nthe left ureter, obliteration of the ostia of both ureters, with\r\nconsequent hydronephrosis of a confluent kidney. There was a minute\r\nopening into the bladder, which allowed the passage of meconium through\r\nthe urethra. Burge mentions the case of what he calls \"sexless child,\"\r\nin which there was an imperforate anus and no pubic arch; the ureters\r\ndischarged upon a tumor the size of a teacup extending from the\r\numbilicus to the pubes. A postmortem examination confirmed the\r\ndiagnosis of sexless child.\r\n\r\nThe Liver.--The Ephemerides, Frankenau, von Home, Molinetti, Schenok,\r\nand others speak of deficient or absent liver. Zacutus Lusitanus says\r\nthat he once found a mass of flesh in place of the liver. Lieutaud is\r\nquoted as describing a postmortem examination of an adult who had died\r\nof hydropsy, in whom the liver and spleen were entirely missing. The\r\nportal vein discharged immediately into the vena cava; this case is\r\nprobably unique, as no authentic parallel could be found.\r\n\r\nLaget reports an instance of supernumerary lobe in the liver. Van Buren\r\ndescribes a supernumerary liver. Sometimes there is rotation, real or\r\napparent, caused by transposition of the characteristics of the liver.\r\nHandy mentions such a case.  Kirmisson reports a singular anomaly of\r\nthe liver which he calls double displacement by interversion and\r\nrotation on the vertical axis. Actual displacements of the liver as\r\nwell as what is known as wandering liver are not uncommon. The\r\noperation for floating liver will be spoken of later.\r\n\r\nHawkins reports a case of congenital obliteration of the ductus\r\ncommunis choledochus in a male infant which died at the age of four and\r\na half months. Jaundice appeared on the eighth day and lasted through\r\nthe short life. The hepatic and cystic ducts were pervious and the\r\nhepatic duct obliterated. There were signs of hepatic cirrhosis and in\r\naddition an inguinal hernia.\r\n\r\nThe Gall-Bladder.--Harle mentions the case of a man of fifty, in whom\r\nhe could find no gall-bladder; Patterson has seen a similar instance in\r\na men of twenty-five. Purser describes a double gall-bladder.\r\n\r\nThe spleen has been found deficient or wanting by Lebby, Ramsay, and\r\nothers, but more frequently it is seen doubled. Cabrolius, Morgagni,\r\nand others have found two spleens in one subject; Cheselden and\r\nFallopius report three; Fantoni mentions four found in one subject;\r\nGuy-Patin has seen five, none as large as the ordinary organ;\r\nHollerius, Kerckringius, and others have remarked on multiple spleens.\r\nThere is a possibility that in some of the cases of multiple spleens\r\nreported the organ is really single but divided into several lobes.\r\nAlbrecht mentions a case shown at a meeting of the Vienna Medical\r\nSociety of a very large number of spleens found in the mesogastrium,\r\nperitoneum, on the mesentery and transverse mesocolon, in Douglas'\r\npouch, etc. There was a spleen \"the size of a walnut\" in the usual\r\nposition, with the splenic artery and vein in their normal position.\r\nEvery one of these spleens had a capsule, was covered by peritoneum,\r\nand exhibited the histologic appearance of splenic tissue. According to\r\nthe review of this article, Toldt explains the case by assuming that\r\nother parts of the celomic epithelium, besides that of the\r\nmesogastrium, are capable of forming splenic tissue.  Jameson reports a\r\ncase of double spleen and kidneys. Bainbrigge mentions a case of\r\nsupernumerary spleen causing death from the patient being placed in the\r\nsupine position in consequence of fracture of the thigh. Peevor\r\nmentions an instance of second spleen. Beclard and Guy-Patin have seen\r\nthe spleen congenitally misplaced on the right side and the liver on\r\nthe left; Borellus and Bartholinus with others have observed\r\nmisplacement of the spleen.\r\n\r\nThe Pancreas.--Lieutaud has seen the pancreas missing and speaks of a\r\ndouble pancreatic duct that he found in a man who died from starvation;\r\nBonet speaks of a case similar to this last.\r\n\r\nThere are several cases of complete transposition of the viscera on\r\nrecord. This bizarre anomaly was probably observed first in 1650 by\r\nRiolanus, but the most celebrated case was that of Morand in 1660, and\r\nMery described the instance later which was the subject of the\r\nfollowing quatrain:--\r\n\r\n\"La nature, peu sage et sans douse en debauche Placa le foie au cote\r\ngauche, Et de meme, vice versa Le coeur a le droite placa.\"\r\n\r\nYoung cites an example in a woman of eighty-five who died at\r\nHammersmith, London. She was found dead in bed, and in a postmortem\r\nexamination, ordered to discover if possible the cause of death, there\r\nwas seen complete transposition of the viscera.  The heart lay with its\r\nbase toward the left, its apex toward the right, reaching the lower\r\nborder of the 4th rib, under the right mamma. The vena cava was on the\r\nleft side and passed into the pulmonary cavity of the heart, which was\r\nalso on the left side, the aorta and systemic ventricle being on the\r\nright. The left splenic vein was lying on the superior vena cava, the\r\nliver under the left ribs, and the spleen on the right side underneath\r\nthe heart. The esophagus was on the right of the aorta, and the\r\nlocation of the two ends of the stomach was reversed; the sigmoid\r\nflexure was on the right side. Davis describes a similar instance in a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nHerrick mentions transposition of viscera in a man of twenty-five.\r\nBarbieux cites a case of transposition of viscera in a man who was\r\nwounded in a duel. The liver was to the left and the spleen and heart\r\nto the right etc. Albers, Baron, Beclard, Boyer, Bull, Mackensie,\r\nHutchinson, Hunt, Murray, Dareste, Curran, Duchesne, Musser, Sabatier,\r\nShrady, Vulpian, Wilson, and Wehn are among others reporting instances\r\nof transposition and inversion of the viscera.\r\n\r\nCongenital extroversion or eventration is the result of some congenital\r\ndeficiency in the abdominal wall; instances are not uncommon, and some\r\npatients live as long as do cases of umbilical hernia proper. Ramsey\r\nspeaks of entire want of development of the abdominal parietes.\r\nRobertson, Rizzoli, Tait, Hamilton, Brodie, Denis, Dickie, Goyrand, and\r\nmany others mention extroversion of viscera from parietal defects. The\r\ndifferent forms of hernia will be considered in another chapter.\r\n\r\nThere seem to be no authentic cases of complete absence of the kidney\r\nexcept in the lowest grades of monstrosities. Becker, Blasius, Rhodius,\r\nBaillie, Portal, Sandifort, Meckel, Schenck, and Stoll are among the\r\nolder writers who have observed the absence of one kidney. In a recent\r\npaper Ballowitz has collected 213 cases, from which the following\r\nextract has been made by the British Medical Journal:--\r\n\r\n\"Ballowitz (Virchow's Archiv, August 5, 1895) has collected as far as\r\npossible all the recorded cases of congenital absence of one kidney.\r\nExcluding cases of fused kidney and of partial atrophy of one kidney,\r\nhe finds 213 cases of complete absence of one kidney, upon which he\r\nbases the following conclusions: Such deficiency occurs almost twice as\r\noften in males as in females, a fact, however, which may be partly\r\naccounted for by the greater frequency of necropsies on males. As to\r\nage, 23 occurred in the fetus or newly born, most having some other\r\ncongenital deformity, especially imperforate anus; the rest were about\r\nevenly distributed up to seventy years of age, after which only seven\r\ncases occurred. Taking all cases together, the deficiency is more\r\ncommon on the left than on the right side; but while in males the left\r\nkidney is far more commonly absent than the right, in females the two\r\nsides show the defect equally. The renal vessels were generally absent,\r\nas also the ureter, on the abnormal side (the latter in all except 15\r\ncases); the suprarenal was missing in 31 cases. The solitary kidney was\r\nalmost always normal in shape and position, but much enlarged.\r\nMicroscopically the enlargement would seem to be due rather to\r\nhyperplasia than to hypertrophy. The bladder, except for absence of the\r\nopening of one ureter, was generally normal. In a large number of cases\r\nthere were associated deformities of the organs of generation,\r\nespecially of the female organs, and these were almost invariably on\r\nthe side of the renal defect; they affected the conducting portion much\r\nmore than the glandular portion--that is, uterus, vagina, and Fallopian\r\ntubes in the female, and vas deferens or vesiculae seminales in the\r\nmale, rather than the ovaries or testicles. Finally, he points out the\r\npractical bearing of the subject--for example, the probability of\r\ncalculus causing sudden suppression of urine in such cases--and also\r\nthe danger of surgical interference, and suggests the possibility of\r\ndiagnosing the condition by ascertaining the absence of the opening of\r\none ureter in the bladder by means of the cystoscope, and also the\r\nlikelihood of its occurring where any abnormality of the genital organs\r\nis found, especially if this be unilateral.\"\r\n\r\nGreen reports the case of a female child in which the right kidney and\r\nright Fallopian tube and ovary were absent without any rudimentary\r\nstructures in their place. Guiteras and Riesman have noted the absence\r\nof the right kidney, right ureter, and right adrenal in an old woman\r\nwho had died of chronic nephritis. The left kidney although cirrhotic\r\nwas very much enlarged.\r\n\r\nTompsett describes a necropsy made on a coolie child of nearly twelve\r\nmonths, in which it was seen that in the place of a kidney there were\r\ntwo left organs connected at the apices by a prolongation of the\r\ncortical substance of each; the child had died of neglected malarial\r\nfever. Sandifort speaks of a case of double kidneys and double ureters,\r\nand cases of supernumerary kidney are not uncommon, generally being\r\nsegmentation of one of the normal kidneys. Rayer has seen three kidneys\r\nunited and formed like a horseshoe. We are quite familiar with the\r\nordinary \"horseshoe kidney,\" in which two normal kidneys are connected.\r\n\r\nThere are several forms of displacement of the kidneys, the most common\r\nbeing the \"floating kidney,\" which is sometimes successfully removed or\r\nfixed; Rayer has made an extensive study of this anomaly.\r\n\r\nThe kidney may be displaced to the pelvis, and Guinard quotes an\r\ninstance in which the left kidney was situated in the pelvis, to the\r\nleft of the rectum and back of the bladder. The ureter of the left side\r\nwas very short. The left renal artery came from the bifurcation of the\r\naorta and the primitive iliacs. The right kidney was situated normally,\r\nand received from the aorta two arteries, whose volume did not surpass\r\nthe two arteries supplying the left suprarenal capsule, which was in\r\nits ordinary place.  Displacements of the kidney anteriorly are very\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nThe ureters have been found multiple; Griffon reports the history of a\r\nmale subject in whom the ureter on the left side was double throughout\r\nits whole length; there were two vesical orifices on the left side one\r\nabove the other; and Morestin, in the same journal, mentions ureters\r\ndouble on both sides in a female subject. Molinetti speaks of six\r\nureters in one person. Littre in 1705 described a case of coalition of\r\nthe ureters. Allen describes an elongated kidney with two ureters.\r\nCoeyne mentions duplication of the ureters on both sides. Lediberder\r\nreports a case in which the ureter had double origin. Tyson cites an\r\ninstance of four ureters in an infant. Penrose mentions the absence of\r\nthe upper two-thirds of the left ureter, with a small cystic kidney,\r\nand there are parallel cases on record.\r\n\r\nThe ureters sometimes have anomalous terminations either in the rectum,\r\nvagina, or directly in the urethra. This latter disposition is realized\r\nnormally in a number of animals and causes the incessant flow of urine,\r\nresulting in a serious inconvenience. Flajani speaks of the termination\r\nof the ureters in the pelvis; Nebel has seen them appear just beneath\r\nthe umbilicus; and Lieutaud describes a man who died at thirty-five,\r\nfrom another cause, whose ureters, as large as intestines, terminated\r\nin the urethral canal, causing him to urinate frequently; the bladder\r\nwas absent. In the early part of this century there was a young girl\r\nexamined in New York whose ureters emptied into a reddish carnosity on\r\nthe mons veneris. The urine dribbled continuously, and if the child\r\ncried or made any exertion it came in jets. The genital organs\r\nparticipated but little in the deformity, and with the exception that\r\nthe umbilicus was low and the anus more anterior than natural, the\r\nchild was well formed and its health good. Colzi reports a case in\r\nwhich the left ureter opened externally at the left side of the hymen a\r\nlittle below the normal meatus urinarius. There is a case described of\r\na man who evidently suffered from a patent urachus, as the urine passed\r\nin jets as if controlled by a sphincter from his umbilicus. Littre\r\nmentions a patent urachus in a boy of eighteen. Congenital dilatation\r\nof the ureters is occasionally seen in the new-born. Shattuck describes\r\na male fetus showing reptilian characters in the sexual ducts. There\r\nwas ectopia vesicae and prolapse of the intestine at the umbilicus; the\r\nright kidney was elongated; the right vas deferens opened into the\r\nureter. There was persistence in a separate condition of the two\r\nMullerian ducts which opened externally inferiorly, and there were two\r\nducts near the openings which represented anal pouches. Both testicles\r\nwere in the abdomen. Ord describes a man in whom one of the Mullerian\r\nducts was persistent.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Bladder.--Blanchard, Blasius, Haller, Nebel, and\r\nRhodius mention cases in which the bladder has been found absent and we\r\nhave already mentioned some cases, but the instances in which the\r\nbladder has been duplex are much more frequent.  Bourienne,\r\nOberteuffer, Ruysch, Bartholinus, Morgagni, and Franck speak of vesical\r\nduplication. There is a description of a man who had two bladders, each\r\nreceiving a ureter. Bussiere describes a triple bladder, and Scibelli\r\nof Naples mentions an instance in a subject who died at fifty-seven\r\nwith symptoms of retention of urine. In the illustration, B represents\r\nthe normal bladder, A and C the supplementary bladders, with D and E\r\ntheir respective points of entrance into B. As will be noticed, the\r\nureters terminate in the supplementary bladders. Fantoni and Malgetti\r\ncite instances of quintuple bladders.\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides speaks of a case of coalition of the bladder with the\r\nos pubis and another case of coalition with the omentum.  Prochaska\r\nmentions vesical fusion with the uterus, and we have already described\r\nunion with the rectum and intestine.\r\n\r\nExstrophy of the bladder is not rare, and is often associated with\r\nhypospadias, epispadias, and other malformations of the genitourinary\r\ntract. It consists of a deficiency of the abdominal wall in the\r\nhypogastric region, in which is seen the denuded bladder. It is\r\nremedied by many different and ingenious plastic operations.\r\n\r\nIn an occasional instance in which there is occlusion at the umbilicus\r\nand again at the neck of the bladder this organ becomes so distended as\r\nto produce a most curious deformity in the fetus.  Figure 143 shows\r\nsuch a case.\r\n\r\nThe Heart.--Absence of the heart has never been recorded in human\r\nbeings except in the case of monsters, as, for example, the\r\nomphalosites, although there was a case reported and firmly believed by\r\nthe ancient authors,--a Roman soldier in whom Telasius said he could\r\ndiscover no vestige of a heart.\r\n\r\nThe absence of one ventricle has been recorded. Schenck has seen the\r\nleft ventricle deficient, and the Ephemerides, Behr, and Kerckring\r\nspeak of a single ventricle only in the heart. Riolan mentions a heart\r\nin which both ventricles were absent. Jurgens reported in Berlin,\r\nFebruary 1, 1882, an autopsy on a child who had lived some days after\r\nbirth, in which the left ventricle of the heart was found completely\r\nabsent. Playfair showed the heart of a child which had lived nine\r\nmonths in which one ventricle was absent. In King's College Hospital in\r\nLondon there is a heart of a boy of thirteen in which the cavities\r\nconsist of a single ventricle and a single auricle.\r\n\r\nDuplication of the heart, notwithstanding the number of cases reported,\r\nhas been admitted with the greatest reserve by Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire\r\nand by a number of authors. Among the celebrated anatomists who\r\ndescribe duplex heart are Littre, Meckel, Collomb, Panum, Behr,\r\nPaullini, Rhodins, Winslow, and Zacutus Lusitanus.\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides cites an instance of triple heart, and Johnston has\r\nseen a triple heart in a goose.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of \"blue-disease,\" or congenital cyanosis, is due to the\r\npatency of the foremen ovale, which, instead of closing at birth,\r\npersists sometimes to adult life.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most unique collection of congenital malformations of the\r\nheart from persons who have reached the age of puberty was to be seen\r\nin London in 1895. In this collection there was an adult heart in which\r\nthe foremen ovale remained open until the age of thirty-seven; there\r\nwere but two pulmonary valves; there was another heart showing a large\r\npatent foramen ovale from a man of forty-six; and there was a septum\r\nventriculorum of an adult heart from a woman of sixty-three, who died\r\nof carcinoma of the breast, in which the foremen ovale was still open\r\nand would admit the fore-finger. This woman had shown no symptoms of\r\nthe malformation. There were also hearts in which the interventricular\r\nseptum was deficient, the ductus arteriosus patent, or some valvular\r\nmalformation present. All these persons had reached puberty.\r\n\r\nDisplacements of the heart are quite numerous. Deschamps of Laval made\r\nan autopsy on an old soldier which justified the expression, \"He had a\r\nheart in his belly.\" This organ was found in the left lumbar region; it\r\nhad, with its vessels, traversed an anomalous opening in the diaphragm.\r\nFranck observed in the Hospital of Colmar a woman with the heart in the\r\nepigastric region. Ramel and Vetter speak of the heart under the\r\ndiaphragm.\r\n\r\nInversion of the heart is quite frequent, and we often find reports of\r\ncases of this anomaly. Fournier describes a soldier of thirty years, of\r\nmiddle height, well proportioned and healthy, who was killed in a duel\r\nby receiving a wound in the abdomen; postmortem, the heart was found in\r\nthe position of the right lung; the two lungs were joined and occupied\r\nthe left chest.\r\n\r\nThe anomalies of the vascular system are so numerous that we shall\r\ndismiss them with a slight mention. Malacarne in Torino in 1784\r\ndescribed a double aorta, and Hommelius mentions an analogous case. The\r\nfollowing case is quite an interesting anatomic anomaly: A woman since\r\ninfancy had difficulty in swallowing, which was augmented at the epoch\r\nof menstruation and after exercise; bleeding relieved her momentarily,\r\nbut the difficulty always returned. At last deglutition became\r\nimpossible and the patient died of malnutrition. A necropsy revealed\r\nthe presence of the subclavicular artery passing between the tracheal\r\nartery and the esophagus, compressing this latter tube and opposing the\r\npassage of food.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of the Breasts.--The first of the anomalies of the generative\r\napparatus to be discussed, although not distinctly belonging under this\r\nhead, will be those of the mammae.\r\n\r\nAmazia, or complete absence of the breast, is seldom seen.  Pilcher\r\ndescribes an individual who passed for a female, but who was really a\r\nmale, in whom the breasts were absolutely wanting.  Foerster, Froriep,\r\nand Ried cite instances associated with thoracic malformation. Greenhow\r\nreports a case in which the mammae were absent, although there were\r\ndepressed rudimentary nipples and areolae. There were no ovaries and\r\nthe uterus was congenitally imperfect.\r\n\r\nThere was a negress spoken of in 1842 in whom the right breast was\r\nmissing, and there are cases of but one breast, mentioned by King,\r\nPaull, and others. Scanzoni has observed absence of the left mamma with\r\nabsence of the left ovary.\r\n\r\nMicromazia is not so rare, and is generally seen in females with\r\nassociate genital troubles. Excessive development of the mammae,\r\ngenerally being a pathologic phenomenon, will be mentioned in another\r\nchapter. However, among some of the indigenous negroes the female\r\nbreasts are naturally very large and pendulous. This is well shown in\r\nFigure 144, which represents a woman of the Bushman tribe nursing an\r\ninfant. The breasts are sufficiently pendulous and loose to be easily\r\nthrown over the shoulder.\r\n\r\nPolymazia is of much more frequent occurrence than is supposed.  Julia,\r\nthe mother of Alexander Severus, was surnamed \"Mammea\" because she had\r\nsupernumerary breasts. Anne Boleyn, the unfortunate wife of Henry VIII\r\nof England, was reputed to have had six toes, six fingers, and three\r\nbreasts. Lynceus says that in his time there existed a Roman woman with\r\nfour mammae, very beautiful in contour, arranged in two lines,\r\nregularly, one above the other, and all giving milk in abundance.\r\nRubens has pictured a woman with four breasts; the painting may be seen\r\nin the Louvre in Paris.\r\n\r\nThere was a young and wealthy heiress who addressed herself to the\r\nancient faculty at Tubingen, asking, as she displayed four mammary,\r\nwhether, should she marry, she would have three or four children at a\r\nbirth. This was a belief with which some of her elder matron friends\r\nhad inspired her, and which she held as a hindrance to marriage.\r\n\r\nLeichtenstern, who has collected 70 cases of polymazia in females and\r\n22 in males, thinks that accessory breasts or nipples are due to\r\natavism, and that our most remote inferiorly organized ancestors had\r\nmany breasts, but that by constantly bearing but one child, from being\r\npolymastic, females have gradually become bimastic. Some of the older\r\nphilosophers contended that by the presence of two breasts woman was\r\noriginally intended to bear two children.\r\n\r\nHirst says: \"Supernumerary breasts and nipples are more common than is\r\ngenerally supposed. Bruce found 60 instances in 3956 persons examined\r\n(1.56 per cent). Leichtenstern places the frequency at one in 500. Both\r\nobservers declare that men present the anomaly about twice as\r\nfrequently as women. It is impossible to account for the accessory\r\nglands on the theory of reversion, as they occur with no regularity in\r\nsituation, but may develop at odd places on the body. The most frequent\r\nposition is on the pectoral surface below the true mammae and somewhat\r\nnearer the middle line, but an accessory gland has been observed on the\r\nleft shoulder over the prominence of the deltoid, on the abdominal\r\nsurface below the costal cartilages, above the umbilicus, in the\r\naxilla, in the groin, on the dorsal surface, on the labium majus, and\r\non the outer aspect of the left thigh. Ahlfeld explains the presence of\r\nmammae on odd parts of the body by the theory that portions of the\r\nembryonal material entering into the composition of the mammary gland\r\nare carried to and implanted upon any portion of the exterior of the\r\nbody by means of the amnion.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly the greatest number of accessory mammae reported is that of\r\nNeugebauer in 1886, who found ten in one person. Peuch in 1876\r\ncollected 77 cases, and since then Hamy, Quinqusud, Whiteford,\r\nEngstrom, and Mitchell Bruce have collected cases. Polymazia must have\r\nbeen known in the olden times, and we still have before us the old\r\nimages of Diana, in which this goddess is portrayed with numerous\r\nbreasts, indicating her ability to look after the growing child. Figure\r\n145 shows an ancient Oriental statue of Artemisia or Diana now at\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nBartholinus has observed a Danish woman with three mammae, two\r\nordinarily formed and a third forming a triangle with the others and\r\nresembling the breasts of a fat man. In the village of Phullendorf in\r\nGermany early in this century there was an old woman who sought alms\r\nfrom place to place, exhibiting to the curious four symmetrical\r\nbreasts, arranged parallel. She was extremely ugly, and when on all\r\nfours, with her breasts pendulous, she resembled a beast. The authors\r\nhave seen a man with six distinct nipples, arranged as regularly as\r\nthose of a bitch or sow. The two lower were quite small. This man's\r\nbody was covered with heavy, long hair, making him a very conspicuous\r\nobject when seen naked during bathing. The hair was absent for a space\r\nof nearly an inch about the nipples. Borellus speaks of a woman with\r\nthree mammae, two as ordinarily, the third to the left side, which gave\r\nmilk, but not the same quantity as the others.  Gardiner describes a\r\nmulatto woman who had four mammae, two of which were near the axillae,\r\nabout four inches in circumference, with proportionate sized nipples.\r\nShe became a mother at fourteen, and gave milk from all her breasts. In\r\nhis \"Dictionnaire Philosophique\" Voltaire gives the history of a woman\r\nwith four well-formed and symmetrically arranged breasts; she also\r\nexhibited an excrescence, covered with a nap-like hair, looking like a\r\ncow-tail. Percy thought the excrescence a prolongation of the coccyx,\r\nand said that similar instances were seen in savage men of Borneo.\r\n\r\nPercy says that among some prisoners taken in Austria was found a woman\r\nof Valachia, near Roumania, exceedingly fatigued, and suffering\r\nintensely from the cold. It was January, and the ground was covered\r\nwith three feet of snow. She had been exposed with her two infants, who\r\nhad been born twenty days, to this freezing temperature, and died on\r\nthe next day. An examination of her body revealed five mammae, of which\r\nfour projected as ordinarily, while the fifth was about the size of\r\nthat of a girl at puberty.\r\n\r\nThey all had an intense dark ring about them; the fifth was situated\r\nabout five inches above the umbilicus. Percy injected the subject and\r\ndissected and described the mammary blood-supply.  Hirst mentions a\r\nnegress of nineteen who had nine mammae, all told, and as many nipples.\r\nThe two normal glands were very large.  Two accessory glands and\r\nnipples below them were small and did not excrete milk. All the other\r\nglands and nipples gave milk in large quantities. There were five\r\nnipples on the left and four on the right side. The patient's mother\r\nhad an accessory mamma on the abdomen that secreted milk during the\r\nperiod of lactation.\r\n\r\nCharpentier has observed in his clinic a woman with two supplementary\r\naxillary mammae with nipples. They gave milk as the ordinary mammae.\r\nRobert saw a woman who nourished an infant by a mamma on the thigh.\r\nUntil the time of pregnancy this mamma was taken for an ordinary nevus,\r\nbut with pregnancy it began to develop and acquired the size of a\r\ncitron. Figure 147 is from an old wood-cut showing a child suckling at\r\na supernumerary mamma on its mother's thigh while its brother is at the\r\nnatural breast.  Jenner speaks of a breast on the outer side of the\r\nthigh four inches below the great trochanter. Hare describes a woman of\r\nthirty-seven who secreted normal milk from her axillae. Lee mentions a\r\nwoman of thirty-five with four mammae and four nipples; she suckled\r\nwith the pectoral and not the axillary breasts. McGillicudy describes a\r\npair of rudimentary abdominal mammae, and there is another similar case\r\nrecorded. Hartung mentions a woman of thirty who while suckling had a\r\nmamma on the left labium majus. It was excised, and microscopic\r\nexamination showed its structure to be that of a rudimentary nipple and\r\nmammary gland. Leichtenstern cites a case of a mamma on the left\r\nshoulder nearly under the insertion of the deltoid, and Klob speaks of\r\nan acromial accessory mamma situated on the shoulder over the greatest\r\nprominence of the deltoid. Hall reports the case of a functionally\r\nactive supernumerary mamma over the costal cartilage of the 8th rib.\r\nJussieu speaks of a woman who had three breasts, one of which was\r\nsituated on the groin and with which she occasionally suckled; her\r\nmother had three breasts, but they were all situated on the chest.\r\nSaunois details an account of a female who had two supernumerary\r\nbreasts on the back. Bartholinus (quoted by Meckel) and Manget also\r\nmention mammae on the back, but Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire questions their\r\nexistence. Martin gives a very clear illustration of a woman with a\r\nsupernumerary breast below the natural organ. Sneddon, who has\r\ncollected quite a number of cases of polymazia, quotes the case of a\r\nwoman who had two swellings in each axilla in which gland-structure was\r\nmade out, but with no external openings, and which had no anatomic\r\nconnection with the mammary glands proper. Shortly after birth they\r\nvaried in size and proportion, as the breasts were full or empty, and\r\nin five weeks all traces of them were lost.  Her only married sister\r\nhad similar enlargements at her third confinement.\r\n\r\nPolymazia sometimes seems to be hereditary. Robert saw a daughter whose\r\nmother was polymastic, and Woodman saw a mother and eldest daughter who\r\neach had three nipples. Lousier mentions a woman wanting a mamma who\r\ntransmitted this vice of conformation to her daughter. Handyside says\r\nhe knew two brothers in both of whom breasts were wanting.\r\n\r\nSupernumerary nipples alone are also seen, as many as five having been\r\nfound on the same breast. Neugebauer reports eight supernumerary\r\nnipples in one case. Hollerus has seen a woman who had two nipples on\r\nthe same breast which gave milk with the same regularity and the same\r\nabundance as the single nipple. The Ephemerides contains a description\r\nof a triple nipple. Barth describes \"mamma erratica\" on the face in\r\nfront of the right ear which enlarged during menstruation.\r\n\r\nCases of deficiency of the nipples have been reported by the\r\nEphemerides, Lentilius, Severinus, and Werckardus.\r\n\r\nCases of functional male mammae will be discussed in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nComplete absence of the hymen is very rare, if we may accept the\r\nstatements of Devilliers, Tardieu, and Brouardel, as they have never\r\nseen an example in the numerous young girls they have examined from a\r\nmedico-legal point of view.\r\n\r\nDuplication or biperforation of the hymen is also a very rare anomaly\r\nof this membrane. In this instance the hymen generally presents two\r\nlateral orifices, more or less irregular and separated by a membranous\r\nband, which gives the appearance of duplicity. Roze reported from\r\nStrasburg in 1866 a case of this kind, and Delens has observed two\r\nexamples of biperforate hymen, which show very well that this\r\ndisposition of the membrane is due to a vice of conformation. The first\r\nwas in a girl of eleven, in which the membrane was of the usual size\r\nand thickness, but was duplicated on either side. In her sister of nine\r\nthe hymen was normally conformed. The second case was in a girl under\r\ntreatment by Cornil in 1876 for vaginitis. Her brother had accused a\r\nyoung man of eighteen of having violated her, and on examination the\r\nhymen showed a biperforate conformation; there were two oval orifices,\r\ntheir greatest diameter being in the vertical plane; the openings were\r\nsituated on each side of the median line, about five mm. apart; the\r\ndividing band did not appear to be cicatricial, but presented the same\r\nroseate coloration as the rest of the hymen. Since this report quite a\r\nnumber of cases have been recorded.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of the hymen will be left to the works on\r\nobstetrics. As has already been observed, labor is frequently seriously\r\ncomplicated by a persistent and tough hymen.\r\n\r\nDeficient vulva may be caused by the persistence of a thick hymen, by\r\ncongenital occlusion, or by absolute absence in vulvar structure.\r\nBartholinus, Borellus, Ephemerides, Julius, Vallisneri, and Baux are\r\namong the older writers who mention this anomaly, but as it is\r\ngenerally associated with congenital occlusion, or complete absence of\r\nthe vagina, the two will be considered together.\r\n\r\nComplete absence of the vagina is quite rare. Baux a reports a case of\r\na girl of fourteen in whom \"there was no trace of fundament or of\r\ngenital organs.\" Oberteuffer speaks of a case of absent vagina. Vicq\r\nd'Azir is accredited with having seen two females who, not having a\r\nvagina, copulated all through life by the urethra, and Fournier sagely\r\nremarks that the extra large urethra may have been a special\r\ndispensation of nature. Bosquet describes a young girl of twenty with a\r\ntriple vice of conformation--an obliterated vulva, closure of the\r\nvagina, and absence of the uterus. Menstrual hemorrhage took place from\r\nthe gums. Clarke has studied a similar case which was authenticated by\r\nan autopsy.\r\n\r\nO'Ferral of Dublin, Gooch, Davies, Boyd, Tyler Smith, Hancock, Coste,\r\nKlayskens, Debrou, Braid, Watson, and others are quoted by Churchill as\r\nhaving mentioned the absence of the vagina. Amussat observed a German\r\ngirl who did not have a trace of a vagina and who menstruated\r\nregularly. Griffith describes a specimen in the Museum of St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospital, London, in which the ovaries lay on the surface\r\nof the pelvic peritoneum and there was neither uterus nor vagina; the\r\npelvis had some of the characteristics of the male type. Matthews\r\nDuncan has observed a somewhat similar case, the vagina not measuring\r\nmore than an inch in length. Ferguson describes a prostitute of\r\neighteen who had never menstruated. The labia were found well\r\ndeveloped, but there was no vagina, uterus, or ovaries. Coitus had been\r\nthrough the urethra, which was considerably distended, though not\r\ncausing incontinence of urine. Hulke reports a case of congenital\r\natresia of the vagina in a brunette of twenty, menstruation occurring\r\nthrough the urethra. He also mentions the instance of congenital\r\natresia of the vagina with hernia of both ovaries into the left groin\r\nin a servant of twenty, and the case of an imperforate vagina in a girl\r\nof nineteen with an undeveloped uterus.\r\n\r\nBrodhurst reports an instance of absence of the vagina and uterus in a\r\ngirl of sixteen who at four years of age showed signs of approaching\r\npuberty. At this early age the mons was covered with hair, and at ten\r\nthe clitoris was three inches long and two inches in circumference. The\r\nmammae were well developed. The labia descended laterally and expanded\r\ninto folds, resembling the scrotum.\r\n\r\nAzema reports an instance of complete absence of the vagina and\r\nimpermeability and probable absence of the col uterinus. The\r\ndeficiencies were remedied by operation. Berard mentions a similar\r\ndeformity and operation in a girl of eighteen. Gooding cites an\r\ninstance of absent vagina in a married woman, the uterus discharging\r\nthe functions. Gosselin reports a case in which a voluminous tumor was\r\nformed by the retained menstrual fluid in a woman without a vagina. An\r\nartificial vagina was created, but the patient died from extravasation\r\nof blood into the peritoneal cavity. Carter, Polaillon, Martin, Curtis,\r\nWorthington, Hall, Hicks, Moliere, Patry, Dolbeau, Desormeaux, and\r\nGratigny also record instances of absence of the vagina.\r\n\r\nThere are some cases reported in extramedical literature which might be\r\ncited. Bussy Rabutin in his Memoires in 1639 speaks of an instance. The\r\ncelebrated Madame Recamier was called by the younger Dumas an\r\ninvoluntary virgin; and in this connection could be cited the malicious\r\nand piquant sonnet--\r\n\r\nChateaubriand et Madame Recamier.\r\n\r\n  \"Juliette et Rene s'aimaient d'amour si tendre\r\n  Que Dien, sans les punir, a pu leur pardonner:\r\n  Il n'avait pas voulu que l'une put donner\r\n  Ce que l'autre ne pouvait prendre.\"\r\n\r\nDuplex vagina has been observed by Bartholinus, Malacarne, Asch,\r\nMeckel, Osiander, Purcell, and other older writers. In more modern\r\ntimes reports of this anomaly are quite frequent. Hunter reports a case\r\nof labor at the seventh month in a woman with a double vagina, and\r\ndelivery through the rectum. Atthill and Watts speak of double vagina\r\nwith single uterus.\r\n\r\nRobb of Johns Hopkins Hospital reports a case of double vagina in a\r\npatient of twenty suffering from dyspareunia. The vaginal orifice was\r\ncontracted; the urethra was dilated and had evidently been used for\r\ncoitus. A membrane divided the vagina into two canals, the cervix lying\r\nin the right half; the septum was also divided. Both the thumbs of the\r\npatient were so short that their tips could scarcely meet those of the\r\nlittle fingers. Double vagina is also reported by Anway, Moulton,\r\nFreeman, Frazer, Haynes, Lemaistre, Boardman, Dickson, Dunoyer, and\r\nRossignol.  This anomaly is usually associated with bipartite or double\r\nuterus. Wilcox mentions a primipara, three months pregnant, with a\r\ndouble vagina and a bicornate uterus, who was safely delivered of\r\nseveral children. Haller and Borellus have seen double vagina, double\r\nuterus, and double ovarian supply; in the latter case there was also a\r\ndouble vulva. Sanger speaks of a supernumerary vagina connecting with\r\nthe other vagina by a fistulous opening, and remarks that this was not\r\na case of patent Gartner's duct.\r\n\r\nCullingworth cites two cases in which there were transverse septa of\r\nthe vagina. Stone reports five cases of transverse septa of the vagina.\r\nThree of the patients were young women who had never borne children or\r\nsuffered injury. Pregnancy existed in each case. In the first the\r\nseptum was about two inches from the introitus, and contained an\r\nopening about 1/2 inch in diameter which admitted the tip of the\r\nfinger. The membrane was elastic and thin and showed no signs of\r\ninflammation. Menstruation had always been regular up to the time of\r\npregnancy. The second was a duplicate of the first, excepting that a\r\nfew bands extended from the cervix to the membranous septum. In the\r\nthird the lumen of the vagina, about two inches from the introitus, was\r\ndistinctly narrowed by a ridge of tissue. There was uterine\r\ndisplacement and some endocervicitis, but no history of injury or\r\noperation and no tendency to contraction. The two remaining cases\r\noccurred in patients seen by Dr. J. F. Scott. In one the septum was\r\nabout 1 3/4 inches from the entrance to the vagina and contained an\r\norifice large enough to admit a uterine probe. During labor the septum\r\nresisted the advance of the head for several hours, until it was slit\r\nin several directions. In the other, menstruation had always been\r\nirregular, intermissions being followed by a profuse flow of black and\r\ntarry blood, which lasted sometimes for fifteen days and was\r\naccompanied by severe pain. The septum was 1 1/2 inches from the\r\nvaginal orifice and contained an opening which admitted a uterine\r\nsound. It was very dense and tight and fully 1/8 inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nMordie reported a case of congenital deficiency of the rectovaginal\r\nseptum which was successfully remedied by operation.\r\n\r\nAnomalous Openings of the Vagina.--The vagina occasionally opens\r\nabnormally into the rectum, into the bladder, the urethra, or upon the\r\nabdominal parietes. Rossi reports from a hospital in Turin the case of\r\na Piedmontese girl in whom there was an enormous tumor corresponding to\r\nthe opening of the vaginal orifice; no traces of a vagina could be\r\nfound. The tumor was incised and proved to be a living infant. The\r\nhusband of the woman said that he had coitus without difficulty by the\r\nrectum, and examination showed that the vagina opened into the rectum,\r\nby which means impregnation had been accomplished. Bonnain and Payne\r\nhave observed analogous cases of this abnormality of the vaginal\r\nopening and subsequent accouchement by the anus. Payne's case was of a\r\nwoman of thirty-five, well formed, who had been in labor thirty-six\r\nhours, when the physician examined and looked in vain for a vaginal\r\nopening; the finger, gliding along the perineum, came in contact with\r\nthe distended anus, in which was recognized the head of the fetus. The\r\nwoman from prolongation of labor was in a complete state of\r\nprostration, which caused uterine inertia.  Payne anesthetized the\r\npatient, applied the forceps, and extracted the fetus without further\r\naccident. The vulva of this woman five months afterward displayed all\r\nthe characteristics of virginity, the vagina opened into the rectum,\r\nand menstruation had always been regular. This woman, as well as her\r\nhusband, averred that they had no suspicion of the anomaly and that\r\ncoitus (by the anus) had always been satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOpening of the vagina upon the parietes, of which Le Fort has collected\r\na number of cases, has never been observed in connection with a viable\r\nfetus.\r\n\r\nAbsence of the labia majora has been observed, especially by Pozzi, to\r\nthe exclusion of all other anomalies. It is the rule in exstrophy of\r\nthe bladder.\r\n\r\nAbsence of the nymphae has also been observed, particularly by Auvard\r\nand by Perchaux, and is generally associated with imperfect development\r\nof the clitoris. Constantinedes reports absence of the external organs\r\nof generation, probably also of the uterus and its appendages, in a\r\nyoung lady. Van Haartman, LeFort, Magee, and Ogle cite cases of absence\r\nof the external female organs. Riolan in the early part of the\r\nseventeenth century reported a case of defective nymphae; Neubauer in\r\n1774 offers a contrast to this case in an instance of triple nymphae.\r\n\r\nThe nymphae are sometimes enormously enlarged by hypertrophy, by\r\nvaricocele, or by elephantiasis, of which latter type Rigal de Gaillac\r\nhas observed a most curious case. There is also a variety of\r\nenlargement of the clitoris which seems to be constant in some races;\r\nit may be a natural hypertrophy, or perhaps produced by artificial\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar conditions under which the Chinese women are obliged to\r\nlive, particularly their mode of sitting, is said to have the effect of\r\ncausing unusual development of the mons veneris and the labia majora.\r\nOn the other hand, some of the lower African races have been\r\ndistinguished by the deficiency in development of the labia majora,\r\nmons veneris, and genital hair. In this respect they present an\r\napproximation to the genitals of the anthropoid apes, among whom the\r\norang-outang alone shows any tendency to formation of the labia majora.\r\n\r\nThe labial appendages of the Hottentot female have been celebrated for\r\nmany years. Blumenbach and others of the earlier travelers found that\r\nthe apron-like appearance of the genitals of the Hottentot women was\r\ndue to abnormal hypertrophy of the labia and nymphae. According to John\r\nKnott, the French traveler, Le Vaillant, said that the more coquettish\r\namong the Hottentot girls are excited by extreme vanity to practice\r\nartificial elongation of the nympha and labia. They are said to pull\r\nand rub these parts, and even to stretch them by hanging weights to\r\nthem. Some of them are said to spend several hours a day at this\r\nprocess, which is considered one of the important parts of the toilet\r\nof the Hottentot belle, this malformation being an attraction for the\r\nmale members of the race. Merensky says that in Basutoland the elder\r\nwomen begin to practice labial manipulation on their female children\r\nshortly after infancy, and Adams has found this custom to prevail in\r\nDahomey; he says that the King's seraglio includes 3000 members, the\r\nelect of his female subjects, all of whom have labia up to the standard\r\nof recognized length. Cameron found an analogous practice among the\r\nwomen of the shores of Lake Tanganyika. The females of this nation\r\nmanipulated the skin of the lower part of the abdomens of the female\r\nchildren from infancy, and at puberty these women exhibit a cutaneous\r\ncurtain over the genitals which reaches half-way down the thighs.\r\n\r\nA corresponding development of the preputian clitorides, attaining the\r\nlength of 18 mm. or even more, has been observed among the females of\r\nBechuanaland. The greatest elongation measured by Barrow was five\r\ninches, but it is quite probable that it was not possible for him to\r\nexamine the longest, as the females so gifted generally occupied very\r\nhigh social positions.\r\n\r\nMorgagni describes a supernumerary left nympha, and Petit is accredited\r\nwith seeing a case which exhibited neither nymphae, clitoris, nor\r\nurinary meatus. Mauriceau performed nymphotomy on a woman whose nymphae\r\nwere so long as to render coitus difficult.  Morand quotes a case of\r\ncongenital malformation of the nymphae, to which he attributed\r\nimpotency.\r\n\r\nThere is sometimes coalition of the labia and nymphae, which may be so\r\nfirm and extensive as to obliterate the vulva. Debout has reported a\r\ncase of absence of the vulva in a woman of twenty upon whom he\r\noperated, which was the result of the fusion of the labia minora, and\r\nthis with an enlarged clitoris gave the external appearance of an\r\nhermaphrodite.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the clitoris coincides with epispadias in the male, and\r\nin atrophy of the vulva it is common to find the clitoris rudimentary;\r\nbut a more frequent anomaly is hypertrophy of the clitoris.\r\n\r\nAmong the older authorities quoting instances of enlarged clitorides\r\nare Bartholinus, Schenck, Hellwig, Rhodius, Riolanus, and Zacchias.\r\nAlbucasis describes an operation for enlarged clitoris, Chabert ligated\r\none, and Riedlin gives an instance of an enlarged clitoris, in which\r\nthere appeared a tumor synchronous with the menstrual epoch.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the classics that there were certain females inhabiting\r\nthe borders of the Aegean Sea who had a sentimental attachment for one\r\nanother which was called \"Lesbian love,\" and which carried them to the\r\nhighest degree of frenzy. The immortal effusions of Sappho contain\r\nreferences to this passion. The solution of this peculiar ardor is\r\nfound in the fact that some of the females had enlarged clitorides,\r\nstrong voices, robust figures, and imitated men. Their manner was\r\nimperative and authoritative to their sex, who worshiped them with\r\nperverted devotion. We find in Martial mention of this perverted love,\r\nand in the time of the dissolute Greeks and Romans ridiculous\r\njealousies for unfaithfulness between these women prevailed.  Aetius\r\nsaid that the Egyptians practiced amputation of the clitoris, so that\r\nenlargement of this organ must have been a common vice of conformation\r\nalong the Nile. It was also said that the Egyptian women practiced\r\ncircumcision on their females at the age of seven or eight, the time\r\nchosen being when the Nile was in flood. Bertherand cites examples of\r\nenlarged clitorides in Arab women; Bruce testifies to this circumstance\r\nin Abyssinia, and Mungo Park has observed it in the Mandingos and the\r\nIbbos.\r\n\r\nSonnini says that the women of Egypt had a natural excrescence, fleshy\r\nin consistency, quite thick and pendulous, coming from the skin of the\r\nmons veneris. Sonnini says that in a girl of eight he saw one of these\r\ncaruncles which was 1/2 inch long, and another on a woman of twenty\r\nwhich was four inches long, and remarks that they seem peculiar only to\r\nwomen of distinct Egyptian origin.\r\n\r\nDuhouset says that in circumcision the Egyptian women not only remove a\r\ngreat part of the body of the clitoris with the prepuce, but also\r\nadjacent portions of the nymphae; Gallieni found a similar operation\r\ncustomary on the upper banks of the Niger.\r\n\r\nOtto at Breslau in 1824 reports seeing a negress with a clitoris 4 1/2\r\ninches long and 1 1/2 inches in the transverse diameter; it projected\r\nfrom the vulva and when supine formed a complete covering for the\r\nvaginal orifice. The clitoris may at times become so large as to\r\nprevent coitus, and in France has constituted a legitimate cause for\r\ndivorce. This organ is very sensitive, and it is said that in cases of\r\nsupposed catalepsy a woman cannot bear titillation of the clitoris\r\nwithout some visible movement.\r\n\r\nColumbus cites an example of a clitoris as long as a little finger;\r\nHaller mentions one which measured seven inches, and there is a record\r\nof an enlarged clitoris which resembled the neck of a goose and which\r\nwas 12 inches long. Bainbridge reports a case of enlarged clitoris in a\r\nwoman of thirty-two who was confined with her first child. This organ\r\nwas five inches in length and of about the diameter of a quiescent\r\npenis. Figure 149 shows a well-marked case of hypertrophy of the\r\nclitoris. Rogers describes a woman of twenty-five in a reduced state of\r\nhealth with an enormous clitoris and warts about the anus; there were\r\nalso manifestations of tuberculosis. On questioning her, it was found\r\nthat she had formerly masturbated; later she had sexual intercourse\r\nseveral times with a young man, but after his death she commenced\r\nself-abuse again, which brought on the present enlargement. The\r\nclitoris was ligated and came away without leaving disfigurement.\r\nCassano and Pedretti of Naples reported an instance of monstrous\r\nclitoris in 1860 before the Academy of Medicine.\r\n\r\nIn some cases ossification of the clitoris is observed Fournier speaks\r\nof a public woman in Venice who had an osseous clitoris; it was said\r\nthat men having connection with her invariably suffered great pain,\r\nfollowed by inflammation of the penis.\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances recorded of bifid clitoris, and Arnaud cites\r\nthe history of a woman who had a double clitoris. Secretain speaks of a\r\nclitoris which was in a permanent state of erection.\r\n\r\nComplete absence of the ovaries is seldom seen, but there are instances\r\nin which one of the ovaries is missing. Hunter, Vidal, and Chaussier\r\nreport in full cases of the absence of the ovaries, and Thudicum has\r\ncollected 21 cases of this nature. Morgagni, Pears, and Cripps have\r\npublished observations in which both ovaries were said to have been\r\nabsent. Cripps speaks of a young girl of eighteen who had an infantile\r\nuterus and no ovaries; she neither menstruated nor had any signs of\r\npuberty. Lauth cites the case of a woman whose ovaries and uterus were\r\nrudimentary, and who exhibited none of the principal physiologic\r\ncharacteristics of her sex; on the other hand, Ruband describes a woman\r\nwith only rudimentary ovaries who was very passionate and quite\r\nfeminine in her aspect.\r\n\r\nAt one time the existence of genuine supernumerary ovaries was\r\nvigorously disputed, and the older records contain no instances, but\r\nsince the researches of Beigel, Puech, Thudicum, Winckler, de Sinety,\r\nand Paladino the presence of multiple ovaries is an incontestable fact.\r\nIt was originally thought that supernumerary ovaries as well as\r\nsupernumerary kidneys were simply segmentations of the normal organs\r\nand connected to them by portions of the proper substance; now,\r\nhowever, by the recent reports we are warranted in admitting these\r\nanomalous structures as distinct organs. It has even been suggested\r\nthat it is the persistence of these ovaries that causes the\r\nmenstruation of which we sometimes hear as taking place after\r\novariotomy. Sippel records an instance of third ovary; Mangiagalli has\r\nfound a supernumerary ovary in the body of a still-born child, situated\r\nto the inner side of the normal organ. Winckel discovered a large\r\nsupernumerary ovary connected to the uterus by its own ovarian\r\nligament. Klebs found two ovaries on one side, both consisting of true\r\novarian tissue, and connected by a band 3/5 inch long.\r\n\r\nDoran divides supernumerary ovaries into three classes:--\r\n\r\n(1) The ovarium succentauriatum of Beigel.\r\n\r\n(2) Those cases in which two masses of ovarian tissue are separated by\r\nligamentous bands.\r\n\r\n(3) Entirely separate organs, as in Winckel's case.\r\n\r\nProlapsus or displacement of the ovaries into the culdesac of Douglas,\r\nthe vaginal wall, or into the rectum can be readily ascertained by the\r\nresulting sense of nausea, particularly in defecation or in coitus.\r\nMunde, Barnes, Lentz, Madden, and Heywood Smith report instances, and\r\nCloquet describes an instance of inguinal hernia of the ovary in which\r\nthe uterus as well as the Fallopian tube were found in the inguinal\r\ncanal. Debierre mentions that Puech has gathered 88 instances of\r\ninguinal hernia of the ovary and 14 of the crural type, and also adds\r\nthat Otte cites the only instance in which crural ovarian hernia has\r\nbeen found on both sides. Such a condition with other associate\r\nmalformations of the genitalia might easily be mistaken for an instance\r\nof hermaphroditic testicles.\r\n\r\nThe Fallopian tubes are rarely absent on either side, although Blasius\r\nreports an instance of deficient oviducts. Blot reports a case of\r\natrophy, or rather rudimentary state of one of the ovaries, with\r\nabsence of the tube on that side, in a woman of forty.\r\n\r\nDoran has an instance of multiple Fallopian tubes, and Richard, in\r\n1861, says several varieties are noticed. These tubes are often found\r\nfused or adherent to the ovary or to the uterus; but Fabricius\r\ndescribes the symphysis of the Fallopian tube with the rectum.\r\n\r\nAbsence of the uterus is frequently reported. Lieutaud and Richerand\r\nare each said to have dissected female subjects in whom neither the\r\nuterus nor its annexed organs were found. Many authors are accredited\r\nwith mentioning instances of defective or deficient uteri, among them\r\nBosquet, Boyer, Walther, Le Fort, Calori, Pozzi, Munde, and Strauch.\r\nBalade has reported a curious absence of the uterus and vagina in a\r\ngirl of eighteen. Azem, Bastien, Bibb, Bovel, Warren, Ward, and many\r\nothers report similar instances, and in several cases all the adnexa as\r\nwell as the uterus and vagina were absent, and even the kidney and\r\nbladder malformed.\r\n\r\nPhillips speaks of two sisters, both married, with congenital absence\r\nof the uterus. In his masterly article on \"Heredity,\" Sedgwick quotes\r\nan instance of total absence of the uterus in three out of five\r\ndaughters of the same family; two of the three were twice married.\r\n\r\nDouble uterus is so frequently reported that an enumeration of the\r\ncases would occupy several pages. Bicorn, bipartite, duplex, and double\r\nuteruses are so called according to the extent of the duplication. The\r\nvarieties range all the way from slight increase to two distinct\r\nuteruses, with separate appendages and two vaginae. Meckel, Boehmer,\r\nand Callisen are among the older writers who have observed double\r\nuterus with associate double vagina. Figure 150 represents a transverse\r\nsection of a bipartite uterus with a double vagina. The so-called\r\nuterus didelphus is really a duplex uterus, or a veritable double\r\nuterus, each segment having the appearance of a complete unicorn uterus\r\nmore or less joined to its neighbor. Vallisneri relates the history of\r\na woman who was poisoned by cantharides who had two uteruses, one\r\nopening into the vagina, the other into the rectum. Morand,\r\nBartholinus, Tiedemann, Ollivier, Blundell, and many others relate\r\ninstances of double uterus in which impregnation had occurred, the\r\nfetus being retained until the full term.\r\n\r\nPurcell of Dublin says that in the summer of 1773 he opened the body of\r\na woman who died in the ninth month of pregnancy. He found a uterus of\r\nordinary size and form as is usual at this period of gestation, which\r\ncontained a full-grown fetus, but only one ovary attached to a single\r\nFallopian tube. On the left side he found a second uterus,\r\nunimpregnated and of usual size, to which another ovary and tube were\r\nattached. Both of these uteruses were distinct and almost entirely\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\nPregnancy with Double Uterus.--Hollander describes the following\r\nanomaly of the uterus which he encountered during the performance of a\r\nceliotomy:--\r\n\r\n\"There were found two uteruses, the posterior one being a normal organ\r\nwith its adnexa; connected with this uterus was another one, anterior\r\nto it. The two uteruses had a common cervix; the anterior of the two\r\norgans had no adnexa, though there were lateral peritoneal ligaments;\r\nit had become pregnant.\" Hollander explains the anomaly by stating that\r\nprobably the Mullerian ducts or one of them had grown excessively,\r\nleading to a folding off of a portion which developed into the anterior\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nOther cases of double uterus with pregnancy are mentioned on page 49.\r\n\r\nWhen there is simultaneous pregnancy in each portion of a double uterus\r\na complication of circumstances arises. Debierre quotes an instance of\r\na woman who bore one child on July 16, 1870, and another on October\r\n31st of the same year, and both at full term.  She had only had three\r\nmenstrual periods between the confinements. The question as to whether\r\na case like this would be one of superfetation in a normal uterus, or\r\nwhether the uterus was double, would immediately arise. There would\r\nalso be the possibility that one of the children was of protracted\r\ngestation or that the other was of premature birth. Article 312 of the\r\nCivil Code of France accords a minimum of one hundred and eighty and a\r\nmaximum of three hundred days for the gestation of a viable child. (See\r\nProtracted Gestation.)\r\n\r\nVoight is accredited with having seen a triple uterus, and there are\r\nseveral older parallels on record. Thilow mentions a uterus which was\r\ndivided into three small portions.\r\n\r\nOf the different anomalous positions of the uterus, most of which are\r\nacquired, the only one that will be mentioned is that of complete\r\nprolapse of the uterus. In this instance the organ may hang entirely\r\nout of the body and even forbid locomotion.\r\n\r\nOf 19 cases of hernia of the uterus quoted by Debierre 13 have been\r\nobserved in the inguinal region, five on the right and seven on the\r\nleft side. In the case of Roux in 1891 the hernia existed on both\r\nsides. The uterus has been found twice only in crural hernia and three\r\ntimes in umbilical hernia. There is one case recorded, according to\r\nDebierre, in which the uterus was one of the constituents of an\r\nobturator hernia. Sometimes its appendages are found with it. Doring,\r\nLedesma, Rektorzick, and Scazoni have found the uterus in the sac of an\r\ninguinal hernia; Leotaud, Murray, and Hagner in an umbilical hernia.\r\nThe accompanying illustration represents a hernia of the gravid womb\r\nthrough the linea alba.\r\n\r\nAbsence of the penis is an extremely rare anomaly, although it has been\r\nnoted by Schenck, Borellus, Bouteiller, Nelaton, and others. Fortunatus\r\nFidelis and Revolat describe a newly born child with absence of\r\nexternal genitals, with spina bifida and umbilical hernia. Nelaton\r\ndescribes a child of two entirely without a penis, but both testicles\r\nwere found in the scrotum; the boy urinated by the rectum. Ashby and\r\nWright mention complete absence of the penis, the urethra opening at\r\nthe margin of the anus outside the external sphincter; the scrotum and\r\ntesticles were well developed. Murphy gives the description of a\r\nwell-formed infant apparently without a penis; the child passed urine\r\nthrough an opening in the lower part of the abdomen just above the\r\nordinary location of the penis; the scrotum was present. Incisions were\r\nmade into a small swelling just below the urinary opening in the\r\nabdomen which brought into view the penis, the glans being normal but\r\nthe body very small. The treatment consisted of pressing out the glans\r\ndaily until the wound healed; the penis receded spontaneously. It is\r\nstated that the organ would doubtless be equal to any requirements\r\ndemanded of it.  Demarquay quotes a somewhat similar case in an infant,\r\nbut it had no urinary opening until after operation.\r\n\r\nAmong the older writers speaking of deficient or absent penis are\r\nBartholinus, Bauhinus, Cattierus, the Ephemerides, Frank, Panaroli, van\r\nder Wiel, and others. Renauldin describes a man with a small penis and\r\nenormous mammae. Goschler, quoted by Jacobson, speaks of a\r\nwell-developed man of twenty-two, with abundant hair on his chin and\r\nsuprapubic region and the scrotum apparently perfect, with median\r\nrapine; a careful search failed to show any trace of a penis; on the\r\nanterior wall of the rectum four lines above the anus was an orifice\r\nwhich gave vent to urine; the right testicle and cord were normal, but\r\nthere was an acute orchitis in the left. Starting from just in front of\r\nthe anal orifice was a fold of skin 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 inch high\r\ncontinuous with the rapine, which seemed to be formed of erectile\r\ntissue and which swelled under excitement, the enlargement lasting\r\nseveral minutes with usually an emission from the rectum. It was\r\npossible to pass a sound through the opening in the rectum to the\r\nbladder through a urethra 1 1/2 inches wide; the patient had control of\r\nthe bladder and urinated from every three to five hours.\r\n\r\nMany instances of rudimentary development of the penis have been\r\nrecorded, most of them complicated with cryptorchism or other\r\nabnormality of the sexual organs. In other instances the organ is\r\npresent, but the infantile type is present all through life; sometimes\r\nthe subjects are weak in intellect and in a condition similar to\r\ncretinism. Kaufmann quotes a case in a weakly boy of twelve whose penis\r\nwas but 3/4 inch long, about as thick as a goose-quill, and feeling as\r\nlimp as a mere tube of skin; the corpora cavernosa were not entirely\r\nabsent, but ran only from the ischium to the junction of the fixed\r\nportion of the penis, suddenly terminating at this point. Nothing\r\nindicative of a prostate could be found. The testicles were at the\r\nentrance of the inguinal canal and the glans was only slightly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nBinet speaks of a man of fifty-three whose external genitalia were of\r\nthe size of those of a boy of nine. The penis was of about the size of\r\nthe little finger, and contained on each side testicles not larger than\r\na pea. There was no hair on the pubes or the face, giving the man the\r\naspect of an old woman. The prostate was almost exterminated and the\r\nseminal vesicles were very primitive in conformation. Wilson was\r\nconsulted by a gentleman of twenty-six as to his ability to perform the\r\nmarital function. In size his penis and testicles hardly exceeded those\r\nof a boy of eight. He had never felt desire for sexual intercourse\r\nuntil he became acquainted with his intended wife, since when he had\r\nerections and nocturnal emissions. The patient married and became the\r\nfather of a family; those parts which at twenty-six were so much\r\nsmaller than usual had increased at twenty-eight to normal adult size.\r\nThere are three cases on record in the older literature of penises\r\nextremely primitive in development. They are quoted by the Ephemerides,\r\nPlater, Schenck, and Zacchias. The result in these cases was impotency.\r\n\r\nIn the Army and Medical Museum at Washington are two injected specimens\r\nof the male organ divested of skin. From the meatus to the pubis they\r\nmeasure 6 1/2 and 5 1/2 inches; from the extremity to the termination\r\nof either crus 9 3/4 and 8 3/4 inches, and the circumferences are 4 3/4\r\nand 4 1/4 inches. Between these two we can strike an average of the\r\nsize of the normal penis.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the penis is so large as to forbid coitus and even\r\ninconvenience its possessor, measuring as much as ten or even more\r\ninches in length. Extraordinary cases of large penis are reported by\r\nAlbinus (who mentions it as a cause for sterility), Bartholinus,\r\nFabricius Hildanus, Paullini, Peyer, Plater, Schurig, Sinibaldus, and\r\nZacchias. Several cases of enormous penises in the new-born have been\r\nobserved by Wolff and others.\r\n\r\nThe penis palme, or suture de la verge of the French, is the name given\r\nto those examples of single cutaneous envelope for both the testicles\r\nand penis; the penis is adherent to the scrotum by its inferior face;\r\nthe glans only is free and erection is impossible.  Chretien cites an\r\ninstance in a man of twenty-five, and Schrumpf of Wesserling describes\r\nan example of this rare anomaly. The penis and testes were inclosed in\r\na common sac, a slight projection not over 1/4 inch long being seen\r\nfrom the upper part of this curious scrotum. When the child was a year\r\nold a plastic operation was performed on this anomalous member with a\r\nvery satisfactory result. Petit describes an instance in which the\r\npenis was slightly fused with the scrotum.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of torsion of the penis. The glans itself may\r\nbe inclined laterally, the curvature may be total, or there may be a\r\nveritable rotation, bringing the inferior face above and the superior\r\nface below. Gay describes a child with epispadias whose penis had\r\nundergone such torsion on its axis that its inferior surface looked\r\nupward to the left, and the child passed urine toward the left\r\nshoulder. Follin mentions a similar instance in a boy of twelve with\r\ncomplete epispadias, and Verneuil and Guerlin also record cases, both\r\ncomplicated with associate maldevelopment. Caddy mentions a youth of\r\neighteen who had congenital torsion of the penis with out hypospadias\r\nor epispadias. There was a complete half-turn to the left, so that the\r\nslit-like urinary meatus was reversed and the frenum was above. Among\r\nthe older writers who describe incurvation or torsion of the penis are\r\nArantius, the Ephemerides, Haenel, Petit, Schurig, Tulpius, and\r\nZacchias.\r\n\r\nZacutus Lusitans speaks of torsion of the penis from freezing.\r\nPaullini mentions a case the result of masturbation, and Hunter speaks\r\nof torsion of the penis associated with arthritis.\r\n\r\nOssification of the Penis.--MacClellann speaks of a man of fifty-two\r\nwhose penis was curved and distorted in such a manner that urine could\r\nnot be passed without pain and coitus was impossible. A bony mass was\r\ndiscovered in the septum between the corpora cavernosa; this was\r\ndissected out with much hemorrhage and the upward curvature was\r\nremoved, but there resulted a slight inclination in the opposite\r\ndirection. The formation of bone and cartilage in the penis is quite\r\nrare. Velpeau, Kauffmann, Lenhoseck, and Duploy are quoted by Jacobson\r\nas having seen this anomaly. There is an excellent preparation in\r\nVienna figured by Demarquay, but no description is given. The\r\nEphemerides and Paullini describe osseous penises.\r\n\r\nThe complete absence of the frenum and prepuce has been observed in\r\nanimals but is very rare in man. The incomplete or irregular\r\ndevelopment is more frequent, but most common is excessive development\r\nof the prepuce, constituting phimosis, when there is abnormal adherence\r\nwith the glans. Instances of phimosis, being quite common, will be\r\npassed without special mention. Deficient or absent prepuce has been\r\nobserved by Blasius, Marcellus Donatus, and Gilibert. Partial\r\ndeficiency is described by Petit Severinus, and others.\r\n\r\nThere may be imperforation or congenital occlusion of some portion of\r\nthe urethra, causing enormous accumulation of urine in the bladder, but\r\nfortunately there is generally in such cases some anomalous opening of\r\nthe urethra giving vent to the excretions. Tulpius mentions a case of\r\ndeficient urethra. In the Ephemerides there is an account of a man who\r\nhad a constant flow of semen from an abnormal opening in the abdomen.\r\nLa Peyroma describes a case of impotence due to ejaculation of the\r\nspermatic ducts into the bladder instead of into the urethra, but\r\nremarks that there was a cicatrix of a wound of the neighboring parts.\r\nThere are a number of instances in which the urethra has terminated in\r\nthe rectum. Congenital dilatation of the urethral canal is very rare,\r\nand generally accompanied by other malformation.\r\n\r\nDuplication of the urethra or the existence of two permeable canals is\r\nnot accepted by all the authors, some of whom contend that one of the\r\ncanals either terminates in a culdesac or is not separate in itself.\r\nVerneuil has published an article clearly exposing a number of cases,\r\nshowing that it is possible for the urethra to have two or more canals\r\nwhich are distinct and have separate functions. Fabricius Hildanus\r\nspeaks of a double aperture to the urethra; Marcellus Donatus describes\r\nduplicity of the urethra, one of the apertures being in the testicle;\r\nand there is another case on record in which there was a urethral\r\naperture in the groin. A case of double urethra in a man of twenty-five\r\nliving in Styria who was under treatment for gonorrhea is described,\r\nthe supernumerary urethra opening above the natural one and receiving a\r\nsound to the depth of 17 cm.  There was purulent gonorrhea in both\r\nurethrae. Vesalius has an account of a double urethral aperture, one of\r\nwhich was supposed to give spermatic fluid and the other urine.\r\nBorellus, Testa, and Cruveilhier have reported similar instances.\r\nInstances of double penis have been discussed under the head of\r\ndiphallic terata, page 194.\r\n\r\nHypospadias and epispadias are names given to malformations of the\r\nurethra in which the wall of the canal is deficient either above or\r\nbelow. These anomalies are particularly interesting, as they are nearly\r\nalways found in male hermaphrodites, the fissure giving the appearance\r\nof a vulva, as the scrotum is sometimes included, and even the perineum\r\nmay be fissured in continuity with the other parts, thus exaggerating\r\nthe deception. There seems to be an element of heredity in this\r\nmalformation, and this allegation is exemplified by Sedgwick, who\r\nquotes a case from Heuremann in which a family of females had for\r\ngenerations given birth to males with hypospadias. Belloc mentions a\r\nman whose urethra terminated at the base of the frenum who had four\r\nsons with the same deformity. Picardat mentions a father and son, both\r\nof whom had double urethral orifices, one above the other, from one of\r\nwhich issued urine and from the other semen--a fact that shows the\r\npossibility of inheritance of this malformation.  Patients in whom the\r\nurethra opens at the root of the penis, the meatus being imperforate,\r\nare not necessarily impotent; as, for instance, Fournier knew of a man\r\nwhose urethra opened posteriorly who was the father of four children.\r\nFournier supposed that the semen ejaculated vigorously and followed the\r\nfissure on the back of the penis to the uterus, the membrane of the\r\nvagina supplanting the deficient wall of the urethra. The penis was\r\nshort, but about as thick as ordinary.\r\n\r\nGray mentions a curious case in a man afflicted with hypospadias who,\r\nsuffering with delusions, was confined in the insane asylum at Utica.\r\nWhen he determined to get married, fully appreciating his physical\r\ndefect, he resolved to imitate nature, and being of a very ingenious\r\nturn of mind, he busied himself with the construction of an artificial\r\npenis. While so engaged he had seized every opportunity to study the\r\nconformation of this organ, and finally prepared a body formed of\r\ncotton, six inches in length, and shaped like a penis, minus a prepuce.\r\nHe sheathed it in pig's gut and gave it a slight vermilion hue. To the\r\ntouch it felt elastic, and its shape was maintained by a piece of\r\ngutta-percha tubing, around which the cotton was firmly wound. It was\r\nfastened to the waist-band by means of straps, a central and an upper\r\none being so arranged that the penis could be thrown into an erect\r\nposition and so maintained. He had constructed a flesh-colored covering\r\nwhich completely concealed the straps.  With this artificial member he\r\nwas enabled to deceive his wife for fifteen months, and was only\r\ndiscovered when; she undressed him while he was in a state of\r\nintoxication. To further the deception he had told his wife immediately\r\nafter their marriage that it was quite indecent for a husband to\r\nundress in the presence of his wife, and therefore she had always\r\nretired first and turned out the light. Partly from fear that his\r\nvirile power would be questioned and partly from ignorance, the\r\nduration of actual coitus would approach an hour. When the discovery\r\nwas made, his wife hid the instrument with which he had perpetrated a\r\nmost successful fraud upon her, and the patient subsequently attempted\r\ncoitus by contact with unsuccessful results, although both parties had\r\nincomplete orgasms. Shortly afterward evidences of mental derangement\r\nappeared and the man became the subject of exalted delusions. His wife,\r\nat the time of report, had filed application for divorce. Haslam\r\nreports a case in which loss of the penis was compensated for by the\r\nuse of an ivory succedaneum.  Parallel instances of this kind have been\r\nrecorded by Ammann and Jonston.\r\n\r\nEntire absence of the male sexual apparatus is extremely rare, but\r\nBlondin and Velpeau have reported cases.\r\n\r\nComplete absence of the testicles, or anorchism, is a comparatively\r\nrare anomaly, and it is very difficult to distinguish between anorchism\r\nand arrest of development, or simple atrophy, which is much more\r\ncommon. Fisher of Boston describes the case of a man of forty-five, who\r\ndied of pneumonia.  From the age of puberty to twenty-five, and even to\r\nthe day of death, his voice had never changed and his manners were\r\ndecidedly effeminate. He always sang soprano in concert with females.\r\nAfter the age of twenty-five, however, his voice became more grave and\r\nhe could not accompany females with such ease. He had no beard, had\r\nnever shaved, and had never exhibited amorous propensities or desire\r\nfor female society. When about twenty-one he became associated with a\r\ngay company of men and was addicted to the cup, but would never visit\r\nhouses of ill-fame. On dissection no trace of testicles could be found;\r\nthe scrotum was soft and flabby. The cerebellum was the exact size of\r\nthat of a female child.\r\n\r\nIndividuals with one testicle are called monorchids, and may be divided\r\ninto three varieties:--\r\n\r\n(1) A solitary testicle divided in the middle by a deep fissure, the\r\ntwo lobes being each provided with a spermatic cord on the same side as\r\nthe lobe.\r\n\r\n(2) Testicles of the same origin, but with coalescence more general.\r\n\r\n(3) A single testicle and two cords.\r\n\r\nGruber of St. Petersburg held a postmortem on a man in January, 1867,\r\nin whom the right half of the scrotum, the right testicle, epididymis,\r\nand the scrotal and inguinal parts of the right vas deferens were\r\nabsent. Gruber examined the literature for thirty years up to the time\r\nof his report, and found 30 recorded postmortem examinations in which\r\nthere was absence of the testicle, and in eight of these both testicles\r\nwere missing. As a rule, natural eunuchs have feeble bodies, are\r\nmentally dull, and live only a short time. The penis is ordinarily\r\ndefective and there is sometimes another associate malformation. They\r\nare not always disinclined toward the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nPolyorchids are persons who have more than two testicles. For a long\r\ntime the abnormality was not believed to exist, and some of the\r\nobservers denied the proof by postmortem examination of any of the\r\ncases so diagnosed, but there is at present no doubt of the\r\nfact,--three, four, and five testicles having been found at autopsies.\r\nRussell, one of the older writers on the testicle, mentions a monk who\r\nwas a triorchid, and was so salacious that his indomitable passion\r\nprevented him from keeping his vows of chastity. The amorous\r\npropensities and generative faculties of polyorchids have always been\r\nsupposed greater than ordinary.  Russell reports another case of a man\r\nwith a similar peculiarity, who was prescribed a concubine as a\r\nreasonable allowance to a man thus endowed.\r\n\r\nMorgagni and Meckel say that they never discovered a third testicle in\r\ndissections of reputed triorchids, and though Haller has collected\r\nrecords of a great number of triorchids, he has never been able to\r\nverify the presence of the third testicle on dissection. Some authors,\r\nincluding Haller, have demonstrated heredity in examples of\r\npolyorchism. There is an old instance in which two testicles, one above\r\nthe other, were found on the right side and one on the left. Macann\r\ndescribes a recruit of twenty, whose scrotum seemed to be much larger\r\non the right than on the left side, although it was not pendulous. On\r\ndissection a right and left testicle were found in their normal\r\npositions, but situated on the right side between the groin and the\r\nnormal testicle was a supernumerary organ, not in contact, and having a\r\nseparate and short cord. Prankard also describes a man with three\r\ntesticles. Three cases of triorchidism were found in recruits in the\r\nBritish Army. Lane reports a supernumerary testis found in the right\r\nhalf of the scrotum of a boy of fifteen. In a necropsy held on a man\r\nkilled in battle, Hohlberg discovered three fully developed testicles,\r\ntwo on the right side placed one above the other. The London Medical\r\nRecord of 1884 quotes Jdanoff of St.  Petersburg in mentioning a\r\nsoldier of twenty-one who had a supernumerary testicle erroneously\r\ndiagnosed as inguinal hernia.  Quoted by the same reference, Bulatoff\r\nmentions a soldier who had a third testicle, which diagnosis was\r\nconfirmed by several of his confreres. They recommended dismissal of\r\nthe man from the service, as the third testicle, usually resting in\r\nsome portion of the inguinal canal, caused extra exposure to traumatic\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nVenette gives an instance of four testicles, and Scharff, in the\r\nEphemerides, mentions five; Blasius mentions more than three testicles,\r\nand, without citing proof, Buffon admits the possibility of such\r\noccurrence and adds that such men are generally more vigorous.\r\n\r\nRussell mentions four, five, and even six testicles in one individual;\r\nall were not verified on dissection. He cites an instance of six\r\ntesticles four of which were of usual size and two smaller than\r\nordinary.\r\n\r\nBaillie, the Ephemerides, and Schurig mention fusion of the testicles,\r\nor synorchidism, somewhat after the manner of the normal disposition of\r\nthe batrachians and also the kangaroos, in the former of which the\r\nfusion is abdominal and in the latter scrotal. Kerckring has a\r\ndescription of an individual in whom the scrotum was absent.\r\n\r\nIn those cases in which the testicles are still in the abdominal cavity\r\nthe individuals are termed cryptorchids. Johnson has collected the\r\nresults of postmortem examinations of 89 supposed cryptorchids. In\r\neight of this number no testicles were found postmortem, the number\r\nfound in the abdomen was uncertain, but in 18 instances both testicles\r\nwere found in the inguinal canal, and in eight only one was found in\r\nthe inguinal canal, the other not appearing. The number in which the\r\nsemen was examined microscopically was 16, and in three spermatozoa\r\nwere found in the semen; one case was dubious, spermatozoa being found\r\ntwo weeks afterward on a boy's shirt. The number having children was\r\nten. In one case a monorchid generated a cryptorchid child. Some of the\r\ncryptorchids were effeminate, although others were manly with good\r\nevidences of a beard. The morbid, hypochondriac, the voluptuous, and\r\nthe imbecile all found a place in Johnson's statistics; and although\r\nthere are evidences of the possession of the generative function,\r\nstill, we are compelled to say that the chances are against fecundity\r\nof human cryptorchids. In this connection might be quoted the curious\r\ncase mentioned by Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, of a soldier who was hung for\r\nrape. It was alleged that no traces of testicles were found externally\r\nor internally yet semen containing spermatozoa was found in the seminal\r\nvesicles. Spermatozoa have been found days and weeks after castration,\r\nand the individuals during this period were capable of impregnation,\r\nbut in these cases the reservoirs were not empty, although the spring\r\nhad ceased to flow. Beigel, in Virchow's Archives, mentions a\r\ncryptorchid of twenty-two who had nocturnal emissions containing\r\nspermatozoa and who indulged in sexual congress. Partridge describes a\r\nman of twenty-four who, notwithstanding his condition, gave evidences\r\nof virile seminal flow.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there is anomalous position of the testicle. Hough\r\nmentions an instance in which, from the great pain and sudden\r\nappearance, a small tumor lying against the right pubic bone was\r\nsupposed to be a strangulated hernia. There were two well-developed\r\ntesticles in the scrotum, and the hernia proved to be a third. McElmail\r\ndescribes a soldier of twenty-nine, who two or three months before\r\nexamination felt a pricking and slight burning pain near the internal\r\naperture of the internal inguinal canal, succeeded by a swelling until\r\nthe tumor passed into the scrotum. It was found in the upper part of\r\nthe scrotum above the original testicle, but not in contact, and was\r\nabout half the size of the normal testicle; its cord and epididymis\r\ncould be distinctly felt and caused the same sensation as pressure on\r\nthe other testicle did.\r\n\r\nMarshall mentions a boy of sixteen in whom the right half of the\r\nscrotum was empty, although the left was of normal size and contained a\r\ntesticle. On close examination another testicle was found in the\r\nperineum; the boy said that while running he fell down, four years\r\nbefore, and on getting up suffered great pain in the groin, and this\r\npain recurred after exertion. This testicle was removed successfully to\r\nthe scrotum. Horsley collected 20 instances of operators who made a\r\nsimilar attempt, Annandale being the first one; his success was likely\r\ndue to antisepsis, as previously the testicles had always sloughed.\r\nThere is a record of a dog remarkable for its salacity who had two\r\ntesticles in the scrotum and one in the abdomen; some of the older\r\nauthors often indulged in playful humor on this subject.\r\n\r\nBrown describes a child with a swelling in the perineum both painful\r\nand elastic to the touch. The child cried if pressure was applied to\r\nthe tumor and there was every evidence that the tumor was a testicle.\r\nHutcheson, quoted by Russell, has given a curious case in an English\r\nseaman who, as was the custom at that time, was impressed into service\r\nby H.M.S. Druid in 1807 from a trading ship off the coast of Africa.\r\nThe man said he had been examined by dozens of ship-surgeons, but was\r\ninvariably rejected on account of rupture in both groins. The scrotum\r\nwas found to be an empty bag, and close examination showed that the\r\ntesticles occupied the seats of the supposed rupture. As soon as the\r\ndiscovery was made the man became unnerved and agitated, and on\r\nre-examining the parts the testicles were found in the scrotum.  When\r\nhe found that there was no chance for escape he acknowledged that he\r\nwas an impostor and gave an exhibition in which, with incredible\r\nfacility, he pulled both testes up from the bottom of the scrotum to\r\nthe external abdominal ring. At the word of command he could pull up\r\none testicle, then another, and let them drop simultaneously; he\r\nperformed other like feats so rapidly that the movements could not be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Russell speaks of a man whose testicle was elevated\r\nevery time the east wind blew, which caused him a sense of languor and\r\nrelaxation; the same author describes a man whose testicles ascended\r\ninto the inguinal canal every time he was in the company of women.\r\n\r\nInversion of the testicle is of several varieties and quite rare, it\r\nhas been recognized by Sir Astley Cooper, Boyer, Maisonneuve, Royet,\r\nand other writers.\r\n\r\nThe anomalies of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles are of little\r\ninterest and will be passed with mention of the case of Weber, who\r\nfound the seminal vesicles double; a similar conformation has been seen\r\nin hermaphrodites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nANOMALIES OF STATURE, SIZE, AND DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nGiants.--The fables of mythology contain accounts of horrible monsters,\r\nterrible in ferocity, whose mission was the destruction of the life of\r\nthe individuals unfortunate enough to come into their domains. The\r\nogres known as the Cyclops, and the fierce anthropophages, called\r\nLestrygons, of Sicily, who were neighbors of the Cyclops, are pictured\r\nin detail in the \"Odyssey\" of Homer.  Nearly all the nations of the\r\nearth have their fairy tales or superstitions of monstrous beings\r\ninhabiting some forest, mountain, or cave; and pages have been written\r\nin the heroic poems of all languages describing battles between these\r\nmonsters and men with superhuman courage, in which the giant finally\r\nsuccumbs.\r\n\r\nThe word giant is derived indirectly from the old English word \"geant,\"\r\nwhich in its turn came from the French of the conquering Normans. It is\r\nof Greek derivation, \"gigas\", or the Latin, \"gigas.\" The Hebrew\r\nparallel is \"nophel,\" or plural, \"nephilim.\"\r\n\r\nAncient Giants.--We are told in the Bible a that the bedstead of Og,\r\nKing of Basham, was 9 cubits long, which in English measure is 16 1/2\r\nfeet. Goliath of Gath, who was slain by David, stood 6 cubits and a\r\nspan tall--about 11 feet. The body of Orestes, according to the Greeks,\r\nwas 11 1/2 feet long. The mythical Titans, 45 in number, were a race of\r\nGiants who warred against the Gods, and their descendants were the\r\nGigantes. The height attributed to these creatures was fabulous, and\r\nthey were supposed to heap up mountains to scale the sky and to help\r\nthem to wage their battles. Hercules, a man of incredible strength, but\r\nwho is said to have been not over 7 feet high, was dispatched against\r\nthe Gigantes.\r\n\r\nPliny describes Gabbaras, who was brought to Rome by Claudius Caesar\r\nfrom Arabia and was between 9 and 10 feet in height, and adds that the\r\nremains of Posio and Secundilla, found in the reign of Augustus Caesar\r\nin the Sallustian Gardens, of which they were supposed to be the\r\nguardians, measured 10 feet 3 inches each. In common with Augustine,\r\nPliny believed that the stature of man has degenerated, but from the\r\nremains of the ancients so far discovered it would appear that the\r\nmodern stature is about the same as the ancient. The beautiful\r\nalabaster sarcophagus discovered near Thebes in 1817 and now in Sir\r\nJohn Soane's Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields in London measures 9 feet 4\r\ninches long.  This unique example, the finest extant, is well worth\r\ninspection by visitors in London.\r\n\r\nHerodotus says the shoes of Perseus measured an equivalent of about 3\r\nfeet, English standard. Josephus tells of Eleazar, a Jew, among the\r\nhostages sent by the King of Persia to Rome, who was nearly 11 feet\r\nhigh. Saxo, the grammarian, mentions a giant 13 1/2 feet high and says\r\nhe had 12 companions who were double his height. Ferragus, the monster\r\nsupposed to have been slain by Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne, was\r\nsaid to have been nearly 11 feet high. It was said that there was a\r\ngiant living in the twelfth century under the rule of King Eugene II of\r\nScotland who was 11 1/2 feet high.\r\n\r\nThere are fabulous stories told of the Emperor Maximilian. Some\r\naccounts say that he was between 8 1/2 and 9 feet high, and used his\r\nwife's bracelet for a finger-ring, and that he ate 40 pounds of flesh a\r\nday and drank six gallons of wine. He was also accredited with being a\r\ngreat runner, and in his earlier days was said to have conquered\r\nsingle-handed eight soldiers. The Emperors Charlemagne and Jovianus\r\nwere also accredited with great height and strength.\r\n\r\nIn the olden times there were extraordinary stories of the giants who\r\nlived in Patagonia. Some say that Magellan gave the name to this\r\ncountry because its inhabitants measured 5 cubits. The naturalist\r\nTurner says that on the river Plata near the Brazilian coast he saw\r\nnaked savages 12 feet high; and in his description of America, Thevenot\r\nconfirms this by saying that on the coast of Africa he saw on a boat\r\nthe skeleton of an American giant who had died in 1559, and who was 11\r\nfeet 5 inches in height. He claims to have measured the bones himself.\r\nHe says that the bones of the leg measured 3 feet 4 inches, and the\r\nskull was 3 feet and 1 inch, just about the size of the skull of\r\nBorghini, who, however, was only of ordinary height. In his account of\r\na voyage to the Straits of Magellan, Jacob Lemaire says that on\r\nDecember 17, 1615, he found at Port Desire several graves covered with\r\nstones, and beneath the stones were skeletons of men which measured\r\nbetween 10 and 11 feet. The ancient idea of the Spaniards was that the\r\nmen of Patagonia were so tall that the Spanish soldiers could pass\r\nunder their arms held out straight; yet we know that the Patagonians\r\nexhibit no exaggeration of height--in fact, some of the inhabitants\r\nabout Terra del Fuego are rather diminutive.  This superstition of the\r\nvoyagers was not limited to America; there were accounts of men in the\r\nneighborhood of the Peak of Teneriffe who had 80 teeth in their head\r\nand bodies 15 feet in height.\r\n\r\nDiscoveries of \"Giants' Bones.\"--Riolan, the celebrated anatomist, says\r\nthat there was to be seen at one time in the suburbs of Saint Germain\r\nthe tomb of the giant Isoret, who was reputed to be 20 feet tall; and\r\nthat in 1509, in digging ditches at Rouen, near the Dominicans, they\r\nfound a stone tomb containing a monstrous skeleton, the skull of which\r\nwould hold a bushel of corn; the shin-bone measured about 4 feet,\r\nwhich, taken as a guide, would make his height over 17 feet. On the\r\ntomb was a copper plate which said that the tomb contained the remains\r\nof \"the noble and puissant lord, the Chevalier Ricon de Vallemont.\"\r\nPlater, the famous physician, declares that he saw at Lucerne the true\r\nhuman bones of a subject that must have been at least 19 feet high.\r\n\r\nValence in Dauphine boasted of possessing the bones of the giant\r\nBucart, the tyrant of the Vivarias, who was slain by his vassal, Count\r\nde Cabillon. The Dominicans had the shin-bone and part of the\r\nknee-articulation, which, substantiated by the frescoes and\r\ninscriptions in their possession, showed him to be 22 1/2 feet high.\r\nThey claimed to have an os frontis in the medical school of Leyden\r\nmeasuring 9.1 X 12.2 X .5 inches, which they deduce must have belonged\r\nto a man 11 or 12 feet high.\r\n\r\nIt is said that while digging in France in 1613 there was disinterred\r\nthe body of a giant bearing the title \"Theutobochus Rex,\" and that the\r\nskeleton measured 25 feet long, 10 feet across the shoulders, and 5\r\nfeet from breast to back. The shin-bone was about 4 feet long, and the\r\nteeth as large as those of oxen. This is likely another version of the\r\nfinding of the remains of Bucart.\r\n\r\nNear Mezarino in Sicily in 1516 there was found the skeleton of a giant\r\nwhose height was at least 30 feet; his head was the size of a hogshead,\r\nand each tooth weighed 5 ounces; and in 1548 and in 1550 there were\r\nothers found of the height of 30 feet. The Athenians found near their\r\ncity skeletons measuring 34 and 36 feet in height. In Bohemia in 758 it\r\nis recorded that there was found a human skeleton 26 feet tall, and the\r\nleg-bones are still kept in a medieval castle in that country. In\r\nSeptember, 1691, there was the skull of a giant found in Macedonia\r\nwhich held 210 pounds of corn.\r\n\r\nGeneral Opinions.--All the accounts of giants originating in the\r\nfinding of monstrous bones must of course be discredited, as the\r\nremains were likely those of some animal. Comparative anatomy has only\r\nlately obtained a hold in the public mind, and in the Middle Ages\r\nlittle was known of it. The pretended giants' remains have been those\r\nof mastodons, elephants, and other animals. From Suetonius we learn\r\nthat Augustus Caesar pleased himself by adorning his palaces with\r\nso-called giants' bones of incredible size, preferring these to\r\npictures or images. From their enormous size we must believe they were\r\nmastodon bones, as no contemporary animals show such measurements.\r\nBartholinus describes a large tooth for many years exhibited as the\r\ncanine of a giant which proved to be nothing but a tooth of a\r\nspermaceti whale (Cetus dentatus), quite a common fish. Hand described\r\nan alleged giant's skeleton shown in London early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and which was composed of the bones of the fore-fin of a small\r\nwhale or of a porpoise.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Sir Hans Sloane, who treated this subject very\r\nlearnedly, arrived at the conclusion that while in most instances the\r\nbones found were those of mastodons, elephants, whales, etc., in some\r\ninstances accounts were given by connoisseurs who could not readily be\r\ndeceived. However, modern scientists will be loath to believe that any\r\nmen ever existed who measured over 9 feet; in fact, such cases with\r\nauthentic references are extremely rare Quetelet considers that the\r\ntallest man whose stature is authentically recorded was the \"Scottish\r\nGiant\" of Frederick the Great's regiment of giants. This person was not\r\nquite 8 feet 3 inches tall. Buffon, ordinarily a reliable authority,\r\ncomes to a loose conclusion that there is no doubt that men have lived\r\nwho were 10, 12, and even 15 feet tall; but modern statisticians cannot\r\naccept this deduction from the references offered.\r\n\r\nFrom the original estimation of the height of Adam (Henrion once\r\ncalculated that Adam's height was 123 feet and that of Eve 118) we\r\ngradually come to 10 feet, which seemed to be about the favorite height\r\nfor giants in the Middle Ages. Approaching this century, we still have\r\nstories of men from 9 to 10 feet high, but no authentic cases. It was\r\nonly in the latter part of the last century that we began to have\r\nabsolutely authentic heights of giants, and to-day the men showing\r\nthrough the country as measuring 8 feet generally exaggerate their\r\nheight several inches, and exact measurement would show that but few\r\nmen commonly called giants are over 7 1/2 feet or weigh over 350\r\npounds. Dana says that the number of giants figuring as public\r\ncharacters since 1700 is not more than 100, and of these about 20 were\r\nadvertised to be over 8 feet. If we confine ourselves to those\r\naccurately and scientifically measured the list is surprisingly small.\r\nTopinard measured the tallest man in the Austrian army and found that\r\nhe was 8 feet 4 1/2 inches. The giant Winckelmeyer measured 8 feet 6\r\ninches in height. Ranke measured Marianne Wehde, who was born in\r\nGermany in the present century, and found that she measured 8 feet 4\r\n1/4 inches when only sixteen and a half years old.\r\n\r\nIn giants, as a rule, the great stature is due to excessive growth of\r\nthe lower extremities, the size of the head and that of the trunk being\r\nnearly the same as those of a man or boy of the same age. On the other\r\nhand, in a natural dwarf the proportions are fairly uniform, the head,\r\nhowever, being always larger in proportion to the body, just as we find\r\nin infants. Indeed, the proportions of \"General Tom Thumb\" were those\r\nof an ordinary infant of from thirteen to fifteen months old.\r\n\r\nFigure 156 shows a portrait of two well-known exhibitionists of about\r\nthe same age, and illustrates the possible extremes of anomalies in\r\nstature.\r\n\r\nRecently, the association of acromegaly with gigantism has been\r\nnoticed, and in these instances there seems to be an acquired uniform\r\nenlargement of all the bones of the body. Brissaud and Meige describe\r\nthe case of a male of forty-seven who presented nothing unusual before\r\nthe age of sixteen, when he began to grow larger, until, having reached\r\nhis majority, he measured 7 feet 2 inches in height and weighed about\r\n340 pounds. He remained well and very strong until the age of\r\nthirty-seven, when he overlifted, and following this he developed an\r\nextreme deformity of the spine and trunk, the latter \"telescoping into\r\nitself\" until the nipples were on a level with the anterior superior\r\nspines of the ilium. For two years he suffered with debility, fatigue,\r\nbronchitis, night-sweats, headache, and great thirst.  Mentally he was\r\ndull; the bones of the face and extremities showed the hypertrophies\r\ncharacteristic of acromegaly, the soft parts not being involved. The\r\ncircumference of the trunk at the nipples was 62 inches, and over the\r\nmost prominent portion of the kyphosis and pigeon-breast, 74 inches.\r\nThe authors agree with Dana and others that there is an intimate\r\nrelation between acromegaly and gigantism, but they go further and\r\ncompare both to the growth of the body. They call attention to the\r\nstriking resemblance to acromegaly of the disproportionate growth of\r\nthe boy at adolescence, which corresponds so well to Marie's terse\r\ndescription of this disease: \"The disease manifests itself by\r\npreference in the bones of the extremities and in the extremities of\r\nthe bones,\" and conclude with this rather striking and aphoristic\r\nproposition: \"Acromegaly is gigantism of the adult; gigantism is\r\nacromegaly of adolescence.\"\r\n\r\nThe many theories of the cause of gigantism will not be discussed here,\r\nthe reader being referred to volumes exclusively devoted to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nCelebrated Giants.--Mention of some of the most famous giants will be\r\nmade, together with any associate points of interest.\r\n\r\nBecanus, physician to Charles V, says that he saw a youth 9 feet high\r\nand a man and a woman almost 10 feet. Ainsworth says that in 1553 the\r\nTower of London was guarded by three brothers claiming direct descent\r\nfrom Henry VIII, and surnamed Og, Gog, and Magog, all of whom were over\r\n8 feet in height. In his \"Chronicles of Holland\" in 1557 Hadrianus\r\nBarlandus said that in the time of John, Earl of Holland, the giant\r\nNicholas was so large that men could stand under his arms, and his shoe\r\nheld 3 ordinary feet.  Among the yeoman of the guard of John Frederick,\r\nDuke of Hanover, there was one Christopher Munster, 8 1/2 feet high,\r\nwho died in 1676 in his forty-fifth year. The giant porter of the Duke\r\nof Wurtemberg was 7 1/2 feet high. \"Big Sam,\" the porter at Carleton\r\nPalace, when George IV was Prince of Wales, was 8 feet high. The porter\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, of whom there is a picture in Hampton Court,\r\npainted by Zucchero, was 7 1/2 feet high; and Walter Parson, porter to\r\nJames I, was about the same height. William Evans, who served Charles\r\nI, was nearly 8 feet; he carried a dwarf in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, in order to gratify the Empress of Austria,\r\nGuy-Patin made a congress of all the giants and dwarfs in the Germanic\r\nEmpire. A peculiarity of this congress was that the giants complained\r\nto the authorities that the dwarfs teased them in such a manner as to\r\nmake their lives miserable.\r\n\r\nPlater speaks of a girl in Basle, Switzerland, five years old, whose\r\nbody was as large as that of a full-grown woman and who weighed when a\r\nyear old as much as a bushel of wheat. He also mentions a man living in\r\n1613, 9 feet high, whose hand was 1 foot 6 inches long. Peter van den\r\nBroecke speaks of a Congo negro in 1640 who was 8 feet high. Daniel,\r\nthe porter of Cromwell, was 7 feet 6 inches high; he became a lunatic.\r\n\r\nFrazier speaks of Chilian giants 9 feet tall. There is a chronicle\r\nwhich says one of the Kings of Norway was 8 feet high.  Merula says\r\nthat in 1538 he saw in France a Flemish man over 9 feet. Keysler\r\nmentions seeing Hans Brau in Tyrol in 1550, and says that he was nearly\r\n12 feet high.\r\n\r\nJonston mentions a lad in Holland who was 8 feet tall. Pasumot mentions\r\na giant of 8 feet.\r\n\r\nEdmund Mallone was said to have measured 7 feet 7 inches.  Wierski, a\r\nPolander, presented to Maximilian II, was 8 feet high.  At the age of\r\nthirty-two there died in 1798 a clerk of the Bank of England who was\r\nsaid to have been nearly 7 1/2 feet high. The Daily Advertiser for\r\nFebruary 23, 1745, says that there was a young colossus exhibited\r\nopposite the Mansion House in London who was 7 feet high, although but\r\nfifteen years old. In the same paper on January 31, 1753, is an account\r\nof MacGrath, whose skeleton is still preserved in Dublin. In the reign\r\nof George I, during the time of the Bartholomew Fair at Smithfield,\r\nthere was exhibited an English man seventeen years old who was 8 feet\r\ntall.\r\n\r\nNicephorus tells of Antonius of Syria, in the reign of Theodosius, who\r\ndied at the age of twenty-five with a height of 7 feet 7 inches.\r\nArtacaecas, in great favor with Xerxes, was the tallest Persian and\r\nmeasured 7 feet. John Middleton, born in 1752 at Hale, Lancashire,\r\nhumorously called the \"Child of Hale,\" and whose portrait is in\r\nBrasenose College, Oxford, measured 9 feet 3 inches tall. In his\r\n\"History of Ripton,\" in Devonshire, 1854, Bigsby gives an account of a\r\ndiscovery in 1687 of a skeleton 9 feet long. In 1712 in a village in\r\nHolland there died a fisherman named Gerrit Bastiaansen who was 8 feet\r\nhigh and weighed 500 pounds. During Queen Anne's reign there was shown\r\nin London and other parts of England a most peculiar anomaly--a German\r\ngiantess without hands or feet who threaded a needle, cut gloves, etc.\r\nAbout 1821 there was issued an engraving of Miss Angelina Melius,\r\nnineteen years of age and 7 feet high, attended by her page, Senor Don\r\nSantiago de los Santos, from the Island of Manilla, thirty-live years\r\nold and 2 feet 2 inches high. \"The Annual Register\" records the death\r\nof Peter Tuchan at Posen on June 18, 1825, of dropsy of the chest. He\r\nwas twenty-nine years old and 8 feet 7 inches in height; he began to\r\ngrow at the age of seven.  This monster had no beard; his voice was\r\nsoft; he was a moderate eater. There was a giant exhibited in St.\r\nPetersburg, June, 1829, 8 feet 8 inches in height, who was very thin\r\nand emaciated.\r\n\r\nDr. Adam Clarke, who died in 1832, measured a man 8 feet 6 inches tall.\r\nFrank Buckland, in his \"Curiosities of Natural History,\" says that\r\nBrice, the French giant, was 7 feet 7 inches. Early in 1837 there was\r\nexhibited at Parma a young man formerly in the service of the King of\r\nthe Netherlands who was 8 feet 10 inches high and weighed 401 pounds.\r\nRobert Hale, the \"Norfolk Giant,\" who died in Yarmouth in 1843 at the\r\nage of forty-three, was 7 feet 6 inches high and weighed 452 pounds.\r\nThe skeleton of Cornelius McGrath, now preserved in the Trinity College\r\nMuseum, Dublin, is a striking example of gigantism. At sixteen years he\r\nmeasured 7 feet 10 inches.\r\n\r\nO'Brien or Byrne, the Irish giant, was supposed to be 8 feet 4 inches\r\nin height at the time of his death in 1783 at the age of twenty-two.\r\nThe story of his connection with the illustrious John Hunter is quite\r\ninteresting. Hunter had vowed that he would have the skeleton of\r\nO'Brien, and O'Brien was equally averse to being boiled in the\r\ndistinguished scientist's kettle. The giant was tormented all his life\r\nby the constant assertions of Hunter and by his persistence in locating\r\nhim. Finally, when, following the usual early decline of his class of\r\nanomalies, O'Brien came to his death-bed, he bribed some fishermen to\r\ntake his body after his death to the middle of the Irish Channel and\r\nsink it with leaden weights. Hunter, it is alleged, was informed of\r\nthis and overbribed the prospective undertakers and thus secured the\r\nbody.  It has been estimated that it cost Hunter nearly 500 pounds\r\nsterling to gain possession of the skeleton of the \"Irish Giant.\" The\r\nkettle in which the body was boiled, together with some interesting\r\nliterature relative to the circumstances, are preserved in the Museum\r\nof the Royal College of Surgeons in London, and were exhibited at the\r\nmeeting of the British Medical Association in 1895 with other Hunterian\r\nrelics. The skeleton, which is now one of the features of the Museum,\r\nis reported to measure 92 3/4 inches in height, and is mounted\r\nalongside that of Caroline Crachami, the Sicilian dwarf, who was\r\nexhibited as an Italian princess in London in 1824. She did not grow\r\nafter birth and died at the age of nine.\r\n\r\nPatrick Cotter, the successor of O'Brien, and who for awhile exhibited\r\nunder this name, claiming that he was a lineal descendant of the famous\r\nIrish King, Brian Boru, who he declared was 9 feet in height, was born\r\nin 1761, and died in 1806 at the age of forty-five. His shoe was 17\r\ninches long, and he was 8 feet 4 inches tall at his death.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of Madame Tussaud in London there is a wax figure of\r\nLoushkin, said to be the tallest man of his time. It measures 8 feet 5\r\ninches, and is dressed in the military uniform of a drum-major of the\r\nImperial Preobrajensky Regiment of Guards. To magnify his height there\r\nis a figure of the celebrated dwarf, \"General Tom Thumb,\" in the palm\r\nof his hand. Figure 158 represents a well-known American giant, Ben\r\nHicks who was called \"the Denver Steeple.\"\r\n\r\nBuffon refers to a Swedish giantess who he affirms was 8 feet 6 inches\r\ntall. Chang, the \"Chinese Giant,\" whose smiling face is familiar to\r\nnearly all the modern world, was said to be 8 feet tall. In 1865, at\r\nthe age of nineteen, he measured 7 feet 8 inches. At Hawick, Scotland,\r\nin 1870, there was an Irishman 7 feet 8 inches in height, 52 inches\r\naround the chest, and who weighed 22 stone. Figure 159 shows an\r\nAmerican giantess known as \"Leah, the Giantess.\" At the age of nineteen\r\nshe was 7 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 165 pounds.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 1871, there were married at Saint-Martins-in-the-Field in\r\nLondon Captain Martin Van Buren Bates of Kentucky and Miss Anna Swann\r\nof Nova Scotia, two celebrated exhibitionists, both of whom were over 7\r\nfeet. Captain Bates, familiarly known as the \"Kentucky Giant,\" years\r\nago was a familiar figure in many Northern cities, where he exhibited\r\nhimself in company with his wife, the combined height of the two being\r\ngreater than that of any couple known to history. Captain Bates was\r\nborn in Whitesburg, Letcher County, Ky., on November 9, 1845. He\r\nenlisted in the Southern army in 1861, and though only sixteen years\r\nold was admitted to the service because of his size. At the close of\r\nthe war Captain Bates had attained his great height of 7 feet 2 1/2\r\ninches. His body was well proportioned and his weight increased until\r\nit reached 450 pounds. He traveled as a curiosity from 1866 to 1880,\r\nbeing connected with various amusement organizations. He visited nearly\r\nall the large cities and towns in the United States, Canada, Great\r\nBritain, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Russia.\r\nWhile in England in 1871 the Captain met Miss Anna H.  Swann, known as\r\nthe \"Nova Scotia Giantess,\" who was two years the junior of her giant\r\nlover. Miss Swann was justly proud of her height, 7 feet 5 1/2 inches.\r\nThe two were married soon afterward.  Their combined height of 14 feet\r\n8 inches marked them as the tallest married couple known to mankind.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bates' parents were of medium size. His father, a native of\r\nVirginia, was 5 feet 10 inches high and weighed 160 pounds.  His mother\r\nwas 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 125 pounds. The height of the\r\nfather of Mrs. Anna Swann Bates was 6 feet and her mother was 5 feet\r\nand 2 inches high, weighing but 100 pounds.\r\n\r\nA recent newspaper dispatch says: \"Captain M. V. Bates, whose\r\nremarkable height at one time attracted the attention of the world, has\r\nrecently retired from his conspicuous position and lives in comparative\r\nobscurity on his farm in Guilford, Medina County, O., half a mile east\r\nof Seville.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1845 there was shown in Paris Joachim Eleiceigui, the Spanish giant,\r\nwho weighed 195 kilograms (429 pounds) and whose hands were 42 cm. (16\r\n1/2 inches) long and of great beauty. In 1882 at the Alhambra in London\r\nthere was a giantess by the name of Miss Marian, called the \"Queen of\r\nthe Amazons,\" aged eighteen years, who measured 2.45 meters (96 1/2\r\ninches). William Campbell, a Scotchman, died at Newcastle in May 1878.\r\nHe was so large that the window of the room in which the deceased lay\r\nand the brick-work to the level of the floor had to be taken out, in\r\norder that the coffin might be lowered with block and tackle three\r\nstories to the ground. On January 27, 1887, a Greek, although a Turkish\r\nsubject, recently died of phthisis in Simferopol. He was 7 feet 8\r\ninches in height and slept on three beds laid close together.\r\n\r\nGiants of History.--A number of persons of great height, particularly\r\nsovereigns and warriors, are well-known characters of history, viz.,\r\nWilliam of Scotland, Edward III, Godefroy of Bouillon, Philip the Long,\r\nFairfax, Moncey, Mortier, Kleber; there are others celebrated in modern\r\ntimes. Rochester, the favorite of Charles II; Pothier, the jurist;\r\nBank, the English naturalist; Gall, Billat-Savarin, Benjamin Constant,\r\nthe painter David, Bellart, the geographer Delamarche, and Care, the\r\nfounder of the Gentleman's Magazine, were all men of extraordinary\r\nstature.\r\n\r\nDwarfs.--The word \"dwarf\" is of Saxon origin (dwerg, dweorg) and\r\ncorresponds to the \"pumilio\" or \"nanus\" of the Romans. The Greeks\r\nbelieved in the pygmy people of Thrace and Pliny speaks of the\r\nSpithamiens. In the \"Iliad\" Homer writes of the pygmies and Juvenal\r\nalso describes them; but the fantasies of these poets have given these\r\ncreatures such diminutive stature that they have deprived the\r\ntraditions of credence. Herodotus relates that in the deserts of Lybia\r\nthere were people of extreme shortness of stature. The Bible mentions\r\nthat no dwarf can officiate at the altar. Aristotle and Philostratus\r\nspeak of pygmy people descended from Pygmaeus, son of Dorus. In the\r\nseventeenth century van Helmont supposed that there were pygmies in the\r\nCanary Islands, and Abyssinia, Brazil, and Japan in the older times\r\nwere repeatedly said to contain pygmy races. Relics of what must have\r\nbeen a pygmy race have been found in the Hebrides, and in this country\r\nin Kentucky and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nDr. Schweinfurth, the distinguished African traveler, confirms the\r\nstatements of Homer, Herodotus, and Aristotle that there was a race of\r\npygmies near the source of the Nile. Schweinfurth says that they live\r\nsouth of the country occupied by the Niam-Niam, and that their stature\r\nvaries from 4 feet to 4 feet 10 inches.  These people are called the\r\nAkkas, and wonderful tales are told of their agility and cunning,\r\ncharacteristics that seem to compensate for their small stature.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Paul DuChaillu speaks of the existence of an African people\r\ncalled the Obongos, inhabiting the country of the Ashangos, a little to\r\nthe south of the equator, who were about 1.4 meters in height. There\r\nhave been people found in the Esquimaux region of very diminutive\r\nstature. Battel discovered another pygmy people near the Obongo who are\r\ncalled the Dongos.  Kolle describes the Kenkobs, who are but 3 to 4\r\nfeet high, and another tribe called the Reebas, who vary from 3 to 5\r\nfeet in height. The Portuguese speak of a race of dwarfs whom they call\r\nthe Bakka-bakka, and of the Yogas, who inhabit territory as far as the\r\nLoango. Nubia has a tribe of dwarfs called the Sukus, but little is\r\nknown of them. Throughout India there are stories of dwarf tribes\r\ndescended from the monkey-God, or Hoonuman of the mythologic poems.\r\n\r\nIn the works of Humboldt and Burgoa there is allusion to the tradition\r\nof a race of pygmies in the unexplored region of Chiapas near the\r\nIsthmus of Tehuantepec in Central America. There is an expedition of\r\nanthropologists now on the way to discover this people. Professor Starr\r\nof Chicago on his return from this region reported many colonies of\r\nundersized people, but did not discover any pygmy tribes answering to\r\nthe older legendary descriptions. Figure 160 represents two dwarf\r\nCottas measuring 3 feet 6 inches in height.\r\n\r\nThe African pygmies who were sent to the King of Italy and shown in\r\nRome resembled the pygmy travelers of Akka that Schweinfurth saw at the\r\ncourt of King Munza at Monbuttu. These two pygmies at Rome were found\r\nin Central Africa and were respectively about ten and fifteen years\r\nold. They spoke a dialect of their own and different from any known\r\nAfrican tongue; they were partly understood by an Egyptian sergeant, a\r\nnative of Soudan, who accompanied them as the sole survivor of the\r\nescort with which their donor, Miani, penetrated Monbuttu. Miani, like\r\nLivingstone, lost his life in African travel. These dwarfs had grown\r\nrapidly in recent years and at the time of report, measured 1.15 and\r\n1.02 meters. In 1874 they were under the care of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety of Italy. They were intelligent in their manner, but resented\r\nbeing lionized too much, and were prone to scratch ladies who attempted\r\nto kiss them.\r\n\r\nThe \"Aztec Children\" in 1851, at the ages of seven and six years,\r\nanother pair of alleged indigenous pygmies, measured 33 3/4 and 29 1/2\r\ninches in height and weighed 20 3/4 and 17 pounds respectively. The\r\ncircumference of their heads did not equal that of an ordinary infant\r\nat birth.\r\n\r\nIt is known that at one time the ancients artificially produced dwarfs\r\nby giving them an insufficient alimentation when very young. They soon\r\nbecame rachitic from their deprivation of lime-salts and a great number\r\nperished, but those who survived were very highly prized by the Roman\r\nEmperors for their grotesque appearance. There were various recipes for\r\ndwarfing children. One of the most efficient in the olden times was\r\nsaid to have been anointing the backbone with the grease of bats,\r\nmoles, dormice, and such animals; it was also said that puppies were\r\ndwarfed by frequently washing the feet and backbone, as the consequent\r\ndrying and hardening of the parts were alleged to hinder their\r\nextension. To-day the growth of boys intended to be jockeys is kept\r\ndown by excessive sweating.\r\n\r\nAncient Popularity of Dwarfs.--At one time a dwarf was a necessary\r\nappendage of every noble family. The Roman Emperors all had their\r\ndwarfs. Julia, the niece of Augustus, had a couple of dwarfs, Conopas\r\nand Andromeda, each of whom was 2 feet 4 inches in height. It was the\r\nfashion at one time to have dwarfs noted for their wit and wisdom.\r\nPhilos of Cos, tutor of Ptolemy Philadelphus, was a dwarf, as were\r\nCarachus, the friend of Saladin; Alypius of Alexandria, who was only 2\r\nfeet high; Lucinus Calvus, who was only 3 feet high, and aesop, the\r\nfamous Greek fabulist. Later in the Middle Ages and even to the last\r\ncentury dwarfs were seen at every Court. Lady Montagu describes the\r\ndwarfs at the Viennese Court as \"devils bedaubed with diamonds.\" They\r\nhad succeeded the Court Jester and exercised some parts of this ancient\r\noffice. At this time the English ladies kept monkeys for their\r\namusement. The Court dwarfs were allowed unlimited freedom of speech,\r\nand in order to get at truths other men were afraid to utter one of the\r\nKings of Denmark made one of his dwarfs Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nCharles IX in 1572 had nine dwarfs, of which four had been given to him\r\nby King Sigismund-Augustus of Poland and three by Maximilian II of\r\nGermany. Catherine de Medicis had three couples of dwarfs at one time,\r\nand in 1579 she had still five pygmies, named Merlin, Mandricart,\r\nPelavine, Rodomont, and Majoski.  Probably the last dwarf in the Court\r\nof France was Balthazar Simon, who died in 1662.\r\n\r\nSometimes many dwarfs were present at great and noble gatherings.  In\r\nRome in 1566 the Cardinal Vitelli gave a sumptuous banquet at which the\r\ntable-attendants were 34 dwarfs. Peter the Great of Russia had a\r\npassion for dwarfs, and in 1710 gave a great celebration in honor of\r\nthe marriage of his favorite, Valakoff, with the dwarf of the Princess\r\nPrescovie Theodorovna. There were 72 dwarfs of both sexes present to\r\nform the bridal party.  Subsequently, on account of dangerous and\r\ndifficult labor, such marriages were forbidden in Russia.\r\n\r\nIn England and in Spain the nobles had the portraits of their dwarfs\r\npainted by the celebrated artists of the day. Velasquez has represented\r\nDon Antonio el Ingles, a dwarf of fine appearance, with a large dog,\r\nprobably to bring out the dwarf's inferior height. This artist also\r\npainted a great number of other dwarfs at the Court of Spain, and in\r\none of his paintings he portrays the Infanta Marguerite accompanied by\r\nher male and female dwarfs. Reproductions of these portraits have been\r\ngiven by Garnier. In the pictures of Raphael, Paul Veronese, and\r\nDominiquin, and in the \"Triumph of Caesar\" by Mantegna, representations\r\nof dwarfs are found, as well as in other earlier pictures representing\r\nCourt events. At the present time only Russia and Turkey seem to have\r\npopular sympathy for dwarfs, and this in a limited degree.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Dwarfs.--It must be remarked, however, that many of the\r\ndwarfs before the public have been men of extraordinary-intelligence,\r\npossibly augmented by comparison. In a postmortem discussed at a\r\nmeeting of the Natural History Society at Bonn in 1868 it was\r\ndemonstrated by Schaufhausen that in a dwarf subject the brain weighed\r\n1/19 of the body, in contradistinction to the average proportion of\r\nadults, from 1 to 30 to 1 to 44. The subject was a dwarf of sixty-one\r\nwho died in Coblentz, and was said to have grown after his thirtieth\r\nyear.  His height was 2 feet 10 inches and his weight 45 pounds. The\r\ncircumference of the head was 520 mm. and the brain weighed 1183.33 gm.\r\nand was well convoluted. This case was one of simple arrest of\r\ndevelopment, affecting all the organs of the body; he was not virile.\r\nHe was a child of large parents; had two brothers and a sister of\r\nordinary size and two brothers dwarfs, one 6 inches higher and the\r\nother his size.\r\n\r\nSeveral personages famous in history have been dwarfs. Attila, the\r\nhistorian Procopius, Gregory of Tours, Pepin le Bref, Charles III, King\r\nof Naples, and Albert the Grand were dwarfs. About the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century the French episcopacy possessed among its members a\r\ndwarf renowned for his intelligence. This diminutive man, called\r\nGodeau, made such a success in literature that by the grace of\r\nRichelieu he was named the Archbishop of Grasse. He died in 1672. The\r\nDutch painter Doos, the English painter Gibson (who was about 3 feet in\r\nheight and the father of nine infants by a wife of about the same\r\nheight), Prince Eugene, and the Spanish Admiral Gravina were dwarfs.\r\nFleury and Garry, the actors.\r\n\r\nHay, a member of Parliament from Sussex in the last century;\r\nHussein-Pasha, celebrated for his reforms under Selim III; the Danish\r\nantiquarian and voyager, Arendt, and Baron Denon were men far below the\r\naverage size Varro says that there were two gentlemen of Rome who from\r\ntheir decorations must have belonged to an Equestrian Order, and who\r\nwere but 2 Roman cubits (about 3 feet) high. Pliny also speaks of them\r\nas preserved in their coffins.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that perhaps certain women are predisposed to give\r\nbirth to dwarfs. Borwilaski had a brother and a sister who were dwarfs.\r\nIn the middle of the seventeenth century a woman brought forth four\r\ndwarfs, and in the eighteenth century a dwarf named Hopkins had a\r\nsister as small as he was. Therese Souvray, the dwarf fiancee of Bebe,\r\nhad a dwarf sister 41 inches high.  Virey has examined a German dwarf\r\nof eight who was only 18 inches tall, i.e., about the length of a\r\nnewly-born infant. The parents were of ordinary size, but had another\r\nchild who was also a dwarf.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of dwarfs, the first coming into the world under\r\nnormal conditions, but who in their infancy become afflicted with a\r\nsudden arrest of development provoked by some malady; the second are\r\nborn very small, develop little, and are really dwarfs from their\r\nbirth; as a rule they are well conformed, robust, and intelligent.\r\nThese two species can be distinguished by an important characteristic.\r\nThe rachitic dwarfs of the first class are incapable of perpetuating\r\ntheir species, while those of the second category have proved more than\r\nonce their virility. A certain number of dwarfs have married with women\r\nof normal height and have had several children, though this is not, it\r\nis true, an indisputable proof of their generative faculties; but we\r\nhave instances in which dwarfs have married dwarfs and had a family\r\nsometimes quite numerous. Robert Skinner (25 inches) and Judith (26\r\ninches), his wife, had 14 infants, well formed, robust, and of normal\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nCelebrated Dwarfs.--Instances of some of the most celebrated dwarfs\r\nwill be cited with a short descriptive mention of points of interest in\r\ntheir lives:--\r\n\r\nVladislas Cubitas, who was King of Poland in 1305, was a dwarf, and was\r\nnoted for his intelligence, courage, and as a good soldier. Geoffrey\r\nHudson, the most celebrated English dwarf, was born at Oakham in\r\nEngland in 1619. At the age of eight, when not much over a foot high,\r\nhe was presented to Henriette Marie, wife of Charles I, in a pie; he\r\nafterward became her favorite. Until he was thirty he was said to be\r\nnot more than 18 inches high, when he suddenly increased to about 45\r\ninches. In his youth he fought several duels, one with a turkey cock,\r\nwhich is celebrated in the verse of Davenant. He became a popular and\r\ngraceful courtier, and proved his bravery and allegiance to his\r\nsovereign by assuming command of a royalist company and doing good\r\nservice therein. Both in moral and physical capacities he showed his\r\nsuperiority. At one time he was sent to France to secure a midwife for\r\nthe Queen, who was a Frenchwoman. He afterward challenged a gentleman\r\nby the name of Croft to fight a duel, and would accept only deadly\r\nweapons; he shot his adversary in the chest; the quarrel grew out of\r\nhis resentment of ridicule of his diminutive size. He was accused of\r\nparticipation in the Papist Plot and imprisoned by his political\r\nenemies in the Gate House at Westminster, where he died in 1682 at the\r\nadvanced age of sixty-three. In Scott's \"Peveril of the Peak\" Hudson\r\nfigures prominently. This author seemed fond of dwarfs.\r\n\r\nAbout the same epoch Charles I had a page in his court named Richard\r\nGibson, who was remarkable for his diminutive size and his ability as a\r\nminiature painter. This little artist espoused another of his class,\r\nAnne Shepherd, a dwarf of Queen Henriette Marie, about his size (45\r\ninches). Mistress Gibson bore nine children, five of whom arrived at\r\nadult age and were of ordinary proportions. She died at the age of\r\neighty; her husband afterward became the drawing master of Princesses\r\nMary and Anne, daughters of James II; he died July 23, 1690, aged\r\nseventy-five years.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 there was born of poor fisher parents at Jelst a child named\r\nWybrand Lokes. He became a very skilful jeweler, and though he was of\r\ndiminutive stature he married a woman of medium height, by whom he had\r\nseveral children. He was one of the smallest men ever exhibited,\r\nmeasuring but 25 1/2 inches in height. To support his family better, he\r\nabandoned his trade and with great success exhibited himself throughout\r\nHolland and England. After having amassed a great fortune he returned\r\nto his country, where he died in 1800, aged seventy. He was very\r\nintelligent, and proved his power of paternity, especially by one son,\r\nwho at twenty-three was 5 feet 3 inches tall, and robust.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated dwarf was Nicolas Ferry, otherwise known as Bebe. He\r\nwas born at Plaine in the Vosges in 1741; he was but 22 cm. (8 1/2\r\ninches) long, weighed 14 ounces at birth, and was carried on a plate to\r\nthe church for baptism. At five Bebe was presented to King Stanislas of\r\nPoland. At fifteen he measured 29 inches. He was of good constitution,\r\nbut was almost an idiot; for example, he did not recognize his mother\r\nafter fifteen days' separation. He was quite lax in his morals, and\r\nexhibited no evidences of good nature except his lively attachment for\r\nhis royal master, who was himself a detestable character. He died at\r\ntwenty-two in a very decrepit condition, and his skeleton is preserved\r\nin the Museum of Natural History in Paris. Shortly before his death\r\nBebe became engaged to a female dwarf named Therese Souvray, who at one\r\ntime was exhibited in Paris at the Theatre Conti, together with an\r\nolder sister. Therese lived to be seventy-three, and both she and her\r\nsister measured only 30 inches in height. She died in 1819.\r\n\r\nAldrovandus gives a picture of a famous dwarf of the Duc de Crequi who\r\nwas only 30 inches tall, though perfectly formed; he also speaks of\r\nsome dwarfs who were not over 2 feet high.\r\n\r\nThere was a Polish gentleman named Joseph Borwilaski, born in 1739 who\r\nwas famed all over Europe. He became quite a scholar, speaking French\r\nand German fairly well. In 1860, at the age of twenty-two, and 28\r\ninches in height, he married a woman of ordinary stature, who bore him\r\ntwo infants well conformed. He was exhibited in many countries, and\r\nfinally settled at Durham, England, where he died in 1837 at the almost\r\nincredible age of ninety-eight, and is buried by the side of the\r\nFalstaffian Stephen Kemble. Mary Jones of Shropshire, a dwarf 32 inches\r\ntall and much deformed, died in 1773 at the age of one hundred. These\r\ntwo instances are striking examples of great age in dwarfs and are\r\ntherefore of much interest. Borwilaski's parents were tall in stature\r\nand three of his brothers were small; three of the other children\r\nmeasured 5 feet 6 inches. Diderot has written a history of this family.\r\n\r\nRicheborg, a dwarf only 23 inches in height, died in Paris in 1858 aged\r\nninety years. In childhood he had been a servant in the House of\r\nOrleans and afterward became their pensioner. During the Revolution he\r\npassed in and out of Paris as an infant in a nurse's arms, thus\r\ncarrying dispatches memorized which might have proved dangerous to\r\ncarry in any other manner.\r\n\r\nAt St. Philip's, Birmingham, there is the following inscription on a\r\ntomb: \"In memory of Mannetta Stocker, who quitted this life on the 4th\r\nday of May, 1819, at the age of thirty-nine years, the smallest woman\r\nin the kingdom, and one of the most accomplished.\" She was born in\r\nKrauma, in the north of Austria, under normal conditions. Her growth\r\nstopped at the age of four, when she was 33 inches tall. She was shown\r\nin many villages and cities over Europe and Great Britain; she was very\r\ngay, played well on the piano, and had divers other accomplishments.\r\n\r\nIn 1742 there was shown in London a dwarf by the name of Robert\r\nSkinner, .63 meters in height, and his wife, Judith, who was a little\r\nlarger. Their exhibition was a great success and they amassed a small\r\nfortune; during twenty-three years they had 14 robust and well-formed\r\nchildren. Judith died in 1763, and Robert grieved so much after her\r\nthat he himself expired two years later.\r\n\r\nFigure 161 shows a female dwarf with her husband and child, all of whom\r\nwere exhibited some years since in the Eastern United States. The\r\nlikeness of the child to the mother is already noticeable.\r\n\r\nBuffon speaks of dwarfs 24, 21, and 18 inches high, and mentions one\r\nindividual, aged thirty-seven, only 16 inches tall, whom he considers\r\nthe smallest person on record. Virey in 1818 speaks of an English child\r\nof eight or nine who was but 18 inches tall. It had the intelligence of\r\na child of three or four; its dentition was delayed until it was two\r\nyears old and it did not walk until four. The parents of this child\r\nwere of ordinary stature.\r\n\r\nAt the \"Cosmorama\" in Regent Street in 1848 there was a Dutch boy of\r\nten exhibited. He was said to be the son of an apothecary and at the\r\ntime of his birth weighed nine pounds. He continued to grow for six\r\nmonths and at the expiration of that time weighed 12 pounds; since\r\nthen, however, he had only increased four pounds.  The arrest of\r\ndevelopment seemed to be connected with hydrocephalus; although the\r\nhead was no larger than that of a child of two, the anterior fontanelle\r\nwas widely open, indicating that there was pressure within. He was\r\nstrong and muscular; grave and sedate in his manner; cheerful and\r\naffectionate; his manners were polite and engaging; he was expert in\r\nmany kinds of handicraft; he possessed an ardent desire for knowledge\r\nand aptitude for education.\r\n\r\nRawdon described a boy of five and a half, at the Liverpool Infirmary\r\nfor Children, who weighed 10 1/2 pounds and whose height was 28 or 29\r\ninches. He uttered no articulate sound, but evidently possessed the\r\nsense of hearing. His eyes were large and well formed, but he was\r\napparently blind. He suckled, cut his teeth normally, but had tonic\r\ncontractions of the spine and was an apparent idiot.\r\n\r\nHardie mentions a girl of sixteen and a half whose height was 40 inches\r\nand weight 35 1/2 pounds, including her clothes. During intrauterine\r\nlife her mother had good health and both her parents had always been\r\nhealthy. She seemed to stop growing at her fourth year. Her intellect\r\nwas on a par with the rest of her body.  Sometimes she would talk and\r\nagain she would preserve rigid silence for a long time. She had a\r\nshuffling walk with a tendency to move on her toes. Her temporary teeth\r\nwere shed in the usual manner and had been replaced by canines and\r\nright first molar and incisors on the right side. There was no\r\nindication of puberty except a slight development of the hips. She was\r\nalmost totally imbecile, but could tell her letters and spell short\r\nwords. The circumference of the head was 19 inches, and Ross pointed\r\nout that the tendon-reflexes were well marked, as well as the\r\nankle-clonus; he diagnosed the case as one of parencephalus.  Figure\r\n162 represents a most curious case of a dwarf named Carrie Akers, who,\r\nthough only 34 inches tall, weighed 309 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn recent years several dwarfs have commanded the popular attention,\r\nbut none so much as \"General Tom Thumb,\" the celebrated dwarf of\r\nBarnum's Circus. Charles Stratton, surnamed \"Tom Thumb,\" was born at\r\nBridgeport, Conn., on January 11, 1832; he was above the normal weight\r\nof the new-born. He ceased growing at about five months, when his\r\nheight was less than 21 inches.  Barnum, hearing of this phenomenon in\r\nhis city, engaged him, and he was shown all over the world under his\r\nassumed name. He was presented to Queen Victoria in 1844, and in the\r\nfollowing year he was received by the Royal Family in France. His\r\nsuccess was wonderful, and even the most conservative journals\r\ndescribed and commented on him. He gave concerts, in which he sang in a\r\nnasal voice; but his \"drawing feat\" was embracing the women who visited\r\nhim. It is said that in England alone he kissed a million females; he\r\nprided himself on his success in this function, although his features\r\nwere anything but inviting. After he had received numerous presents and\r\nhad amassed a large fortune he returned to America in 1864, bringing\r\nwith him three other dwarfs, the \"Sisters Warren\" and \"Commodore Nutt.\"\r\nHe married one of the Warrens, and by her had one child, Minnie, who\r\ndied some months after birth of cerebral congestion. In 1883 Tom Thumb\r\nand his wife, Lavinia, were still living, but after that they dropped\r\nfrom public view and have since died.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the wife of a dwarf named Morris gave birth to twins at\r\nBlaenavon, North Wales. Morris is only 35 inches in height and his wife\r\nis even smaller. They were married at Bartholmey Church and have since\r\nbeen traveling through England under the name of \"General and Mrs.\r\nSmall,\" being the smallest married couple in the world. At the latest\r\nreports the mother and her twins were doing well.\r\n\r\nThe Rossow Brothers have been recently exhibited to the public.  These\r\nbrothers, Franz and Carl, are twenty and eighteen years respectively.\r\nFranz is the eldest of 16 children and is said to weigh 24 pounds and\r\nmeasure 21 inches in height; Carl is said to weigh less than his\r\nbrother but is 29 inches tall. They give a clever gymnastic exhibition\r\nand are apparently intelligent. They advertise that they were examined\r\nand still remain under the surveillance of the Faculty of Gottingen.\r\n\r\nNext to the success of \"Tom Thumb\" probably no like attraction has been\r\nso celebrated as the \"Lilliputians,\" whose antics and wit so many\r\nAmericans have in late years enjoyed. They were a troupe of singers and\r\ncomedians composed entirely of dwarfs; they exhibited much talent in\r\nall their performances, which were given for several years and quite\r\nrecently in all the large cities of the United States. They showed\r\nthemselves to be worthy rivals for honors in the class of\r\nentertainments known as burlesques. As near as could be ascertained,\r\npartly from the fact that they all spoke German fluently and originally\r\ngave their performance entirely in German, they were collected from the\r\nGerman and Austrian Empires.\r\n\r\nThe \"Princess Topaze\" was born near Paris in 1879. According to a\r\nrecent report she is perfectly formed and is intelligent and vivacious.\r\nShe is 23 1/2 inches tall and weighs 14 pounds. Her parents were of\r\nnormal stature.\r\n\r\nNot long since the papers recorded the death of Lucia Zarete, a Mexican\r\ngirl, whose exact proportions were never definitely known; but there is\r\nno doubt that she was the smallest midget ever exhibited In this\r\ncountry. Her exhibitor made a fortune with her and her salary was among\r\nthe highest paid to modern \"freaks.\"\r\n\r\nMiss H. Moritz, an American dwarf, at the age of twenty weighed 36\r\npounds and was only 22 inches tall.\r\n\r\nPrecocious development is characterized by a hasty growth of the\r\nsubject, who at an early period of life attains the dimensions of an\r\nadult. In some of these instances the anomaly is associated with\r\nprecocious puberty, and after acquiring the adult growth at an early\r\nage there is an apparent cessation of the development.  In adult life\r\nthe individual shows no distinguishing characters.\r\n\r\nThe first to be considered will be those cases, sometimes called\r\n\"man-boys,\" characterized by early puberty and extraordinary\r\ndevelopment in infancy. Histories of remarkable children have been\r\ntransmitted from the time of Vespasian. We read in the \"Natural\r\nHistory\" of Pliny that in Salamis, Euthimedes had a son who grew to 3\r\nRoman cubits (4 1/2 feet) in three years; he was said to have little\r\nwit, a dull mind, and a slow and heavy gait; his voice was manly, and\r\nhe died at three of general debility.  Phlegon says that Craterus, the\r\nbrother of King Antigonus, was an infant, a young man, a mature man, an\r\nold man, and married and begot children all in the space of seven\r\nyears. It is said that King Louis II of Hungary was born so long before\r\nhis time that he had no skin; in his second year he was crowned, in his\r\ntenth year he succeeded, in his fourteenth year he had a complete\r\nbeard, in his fifteenth he was married, in his eighteenth he had gray\r\nhair, and in his twentieth he died. Rhodiginus speaks of a boy who when\r\nhe was ten years impregnated a female. In 1741 there was a boy born at\r\nWillingham, near Cambridge, who had the external marks of puberty at\r\ntwelve months, and at the time of his death at five years he had the\r\nappearance of an old man. He was called \"prodigium Willinghamense.\" The\r\nEphemerides and some of the older journals record instances of penile\r\nerection immediately after birth.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Philip Howarth, who was born at Quebec Mews, Portman\r\nSquare, London, February 21, 1806, lost his infantile rotundity of form\r\nand feature after the completion of his first year and became pale and\r\nextremely ugly, appearing like a growing boy. His penis and testes\r\nincreased in size, his voice altered, and hair grew on the pubes. At\r\nthe age of three he was 3 feet 4 1/2 inches tall and weighed 51 1/4\r\npounds. The length of his penis when erect was 4 1/2 inches and the\r\ncircumference 4 inches; his thigh-measure was 13 1/2 inches, his\r\nwaist-measure 24 inches, and his biceps 7 inches. He was reported to be\r\nclever, very strong, and muscular. An old chronicle says that in\r\nWisnang Parish, village of Tellurge, near Tygure, in Lordship Kiburge,\r\nthere was born on the 26th of May, 1548, a boy called Henry Walker, who\r\nat five years was of the height of a boy of fourteen and possessed the\r\ngenitals of a man. He carried burdens, did men's work, and in every way\r\nassisted his parents, who were of usual size.\r\n\r\nThere is a case cited by the older authors of a child born in the Jura\r\nregion who at the age of four gave proof of his virility, at seven had\r\na beard and the height of a man. The same journal also speaks of a boy\r\nof six, 1.62 meters tall, who was perfectly proportioned and had\r\nextraordinary strength. His beard and general appearance, together with\r\nthe marks of puberty, gave him the appearance of a man of thirty.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 Dupuytren presented to the Medical Society in Paris a child 3\r\n1/2 feet high, weighing 57 pounds, who had attained puberty.\r\n\r\nThere are on record six modern cases of early puberty in boys, one of\r\nwhom died at five with the signs of premature senility; at one year he\r\nhad shown signs of enlargement of the sexual organs.  There was another\r\nwho at three was 3 feet 6 3/4 inches high, weighed 50 pounds, and had\r\nseminal discharges. One of the cases was a child who at birth resembled\r\nan ordinary infant of five months. From four to fifteen months his\r\npenis enlarged, until at the age of three it measured when erect 3\r\ninches. At this age he was 3 feet 7 inches high and weighed 64 pounds.\r\nThe last case mentioned was an infant who experienced a change of voice\r\nat twelve months and showed hair on the pubes. At three years he was 3\r\nfeet 4 1/2 inches tall and weighed 51 1/4 pounds. Smith, in Brewster's\r\nJournal, 1829, records the case of a boy who at the age of four was\r\nwell developed; at the age of six he was 4 feet 2 inches tall and\r\nweighed 74 pounds; his lower extremities were extremely short\r\nproportionally and his genitals were as well developed as those of an\r\nadult. He had a short, dark moustache but no hair on his chin, although\r\nhis pubic hair was thick, black, and curly. Ruelle describes a child of\r\nthree and a quarter years who was as strong and muscular as one at\r\neight. He had full-sized male organs and long black hair on the pubes.\r\nUnder excitement he discharged semen four or five times a day; he had a\r\ndeep male voice, and dark, short hair on the cheek and upper lip.\r\n\r\nStone gives an account of a boy of four who looked like a child of ten\r\nand exhibited the sexual organs of a man with a luxuriant growth of\r\nhair on the pubes. This child was said to have been of great beauty and\r\na miniature model of an athlete. His height was 4 feet 1/4 inch and\r\nweight 70 pounds; the penis when semiflaccid was 4 1/4 inches long; he\r\nwas intelligent and lively, and his back was covered with the acne of\r\npuberty. A peculiar fact as regards this case was the statement of the\r\nfather that he himself had had sexual indulgence at eight. Stone\r\nparallels this case by several others that he has collected from\r\nmedical literature.  Breschet in 1821 reported the case of a boy born\r\nOctober 20, 1817, who at three years and one month was 3 feet 6 3/4\r\ninches tall; his penis when flaccid measured 4 inches and when erect 5\r\n1/4 inches, but the testicles were not developed in proportion.  Lopez\r\ndescribes a mulatto boy of three years ten and a half months whose\r\nheight was 4 feet 1/2 inch and weight 82 pounds; he measured about the\r\nchest 27 1/2 inches and about the waist 27 inches; his penis at rest\r\nwas 4 inches long and had a circumference of 3 1/2 inches, although the\r\ntestes were not descended. He had evidences of a beard and his axillae\r\nwere very hairy; it is said he could with ease lift a man weighing 140\r\npounds. His body was covered with acne simplex and had a strong\r\nspermatic odor, but it was not known whether he had any venereal\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nJohnson mentions a boy of seven with severe gonorrhea complicated with\r\nbuboes which he had contracted from a servant girl with whom he slept.\r\nAt the Hopital des Enfans Malades children at the breast have been\r\nobserved to masturbate. Fournier and others assert having seen\r\ninfantile masturbators, and cite a case of a girl of four who was\r\nhabitually addicted to masturbation from her infancy but was not\r\ndetected until her fourth year; she died shortly afterward in a\r\nfrightful state of marasmus. Vogel alludes to a girl of three in whom\r\nrepeated attacks of epilepsy occurred after six months' onanism. Van\r\nBambeke mentions three children from ten to twenty months old, two of\r\nthem females, who masturbated.\r\n\r\nBidwell describes a boy of five years and two months who during the\r\nyear previous had erections and seminal emissions. His voice had\r\nchanged and he had a downy moustache on his upper lip and hair on the\r\npubes; his height was 4 feet 3 1/2 inches and his weight was 82 1/2\r\npounds. His penis and testicles were as well developed as those of a\r\nboy of seventeen or eighteen, but from his facial aspect one would take\r\nhim to be thirteen. He avoided the company of women and would not let\r\nhis sisters nurse him when he was sick.\r\n\r\nPryor speaks of a boy of three and a half who masturbated and who at\r\nfive and a half had a penis of adult size, hair on the pubes, and was\r\nknown to have had seminal emissions. Woods describes a boy of six years\r\nand seven months who had the appearance of a youth of eighteen. He was\r\n4 feet 9 inches tall and was quite muscular. He first exhibited signs\r\nof precocious growth at the beginning of his second year and when three\r\nyears old he had hair on the pubes. There is an instance in which a boy\r\nof thirteen had intercourse with a young woman at least a dozen times\r\nand succeeded in impregnating her. The same journal mentions an\r\ninstance in which a boy of fourteen succeeded in impregnating a girl of\r\nthe same age. Chevers speaks of a young boy in India who was sentenced\r\nto one year's imprisonment for raping a girl of three.\r\n\r\nDouglass describes a boy of four years and three months who was 3 feet\r\n10 1/2 inches tall and weighed 54 pounds; his features were large and\r\ncoarse, and his penis and testes were of the size of those of an adult.\r\nHe was unusually dull, mentally, quite obstinate, and self-willed. It\r\nis said that he masturbated on all opportunities and had vigorous\r\nerections, although no spermatozoa were found in the semen issued. He\r\nshowed no fondness for the opposite sex. The history of this rapid\r\ngrowth says that he was not unlike other children until the third year,\r\nwhen after wading in a small stream several hours he was taken with a\r\nviolent chill, after which his voice began to change and his sexual\r\norgans to develop.\r\n\r\nBlanc quotes the case described by Cozanet in 1875 of Louis Beran, who\r\nwas born on September 29, 1869, at Saint-Gervais, of normal size. At\r\nthe age of six months his dimensions and weight increased in an\r\nextraordinary fashion. At the age of six years he was 1.28 meters high\r\n(4 feet 2 1/3 inches) and weighed 80 pounds.  His puberty was\r\ncompletely manifested in every way; he eschewed the society of children\r\nand helped his parents in their labors.  Campbell showed a lad of\r\nfourteen who had been under his observation for ten years. When fifteen\r\nmonths old this prodigy had hair on his pubes and his external genitals\r\nwere abnormally larger end at the age of two years they were fully\r\ndeveloped and had not materially changed in the following years. At\r\ntimes he manifested great sexual excitement. Between four and seven\r\nyears he had seminal discharges, but it was not determined whether the\r\nsemen contained spermatozoa. He had the muscular development of a man\r\nof twenty-five. He had shaved several years. The boy's education was\r\ndefective from his failure to attend school.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration represents a boy of five years and three\r\nmonths of age whose height at this time was 4 feet and his physical\r\ndevelopment far beyond that usual at this age, his external genitals\r\nresembling those of a man of twenty. His upper lip was covered by a\r\nmustache, and the hirsute growth elsewhere was similarly precocious.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the tombstone of James Weir in the Parish of\r\nCarluke, Scotland, says that when only thirteen months old he measured\r\n3 feet 4 inches in height and weighed 5 stone. He was pronounced by the\r\nfaculty of Edinburgh and Glasgow to be the most extraordinary child of\r\nhis age. Linnaeus saw a boy at the Amsterdam Fair who at the age of\r\nthree weighed 98 pounds. In Paris, about 1822, there was shown an\r\ninfant Hercules of seven who was more remarkable for obesity than\r\ngeneral development. He was 3 feet 4 inches high, 4 feet 5 inches in\r\ncircumference, and weighed 220 pounds. He had prominent eyebrows, black\r\neyes, and his complexion resembled that of a fat cook in the heat.\r\nBorellus details a description of a giant child. There is quoted from\r\nBoston a the report of a boy of fifteen months weighing 92 pounds who\r\ndied at Coney Island. He was said to have been of phenomenal size from\r\ninfancy and was exhibited in several museums during his life.\r\n\r\nDesbois of Paris mentions an extraordinary instance of rapid growth in\r\na boy of eleven who grew 6 inches in fifteen days.\r\n\r\nLarge and Small New-born Infants.--There are many accounts of new-born\r\ninfants who were characterized by their diminutive size.  On page 66 we\r\nhave mentioned Usher's instance of twins born at the one hundred and\r\nthirty-ninth day weighing each less than 11 ounces; Barker's case of a\r\nfemale child at the one hundred and fifty-eighth day weighing 1 pound;\r\nNewinton's case of twins at the fifth month, one weighing 1 pound and\r\nthe other 1 pound 3 1/2 ounces; and on page 67 is an account of Eikam's\r\nfive-months' child, weighing 8 ounces. Of full-term children Sir\r\nEverard Home, in his Croonian Oration in 1824, speaks of one borne by a\r\nwoman who was traveling with the baggage of the Duke of Wellington's\r\narmy. At her fourth month of pregnancy this woman was attacked and\r\nbitten by a monkey, but she went to term, and a living child was\r\ndelivered which weighed but a pound and was between 7 and 8 inches\r\nlong. It was brought to England and died at the age of nine, when 22\r\ninches high. Baker mentions a child fifty days' old that weighed 1\r\npound 13 ounces and was 14 inches long. Mursick describes a living\r\nchild who at birth weighed but 1 3/4 pounds.  In June, 1896, a baby\r\nweighing 1 3/4 pounds was born at the Samaritan Hospital, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nScott has recorded the birth of a child weighing 2 1/2 pounds, and\r\nanother 3 1/4 pounds. In the Chicago Inter-Ocean there is a letter\r\ndated June 20, 1874, which says that Mrs. J. B. McCrum of Kalamazoo,\r\nMichigan, gave birth to a boy and girl that could be held in the palm\r\nof the hand of the nurse. Their aggregate weight was 3 pounds 4 ounces,\r\none weighing 1 pound 8 ounces, the other 1 pound 12 ounces. They were\r\nless than 8 inches long and perfectly formed; they were not only alive\r\nbut extremely vivacious.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of female twins born in 1858 before term. One\r\nweighed 22 1/2 ounces, and over its arm, forearm, and hand one could\r\neasily pass a wedding-ring. The other weighed 24 ounces.  They both\r\nlived to adult life; the larger married and was the mother of two\r\nchildren, which she bore easily. The other did not marry, and although\r\nnot a dwarf, was under-sized; she had her catamenia every third week.\r\nPost describes a 2-pound child.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there have been infants characterized by their\r\nenormous size at birth. Among the older writers, Cranz describes an\r\ninfant which at birth weighed 23 pounds; Fern mentions a fetus of 18\r\npounds; and Mittehauser speaks of a new-born child weighing 24 pounds.\r\nVon Siebold in his \"Lucina\" has recorded a fetus which weighed 22 1/2\r\npounds. It is worthy of comment that so great is the rarity of these\r\ninstances that in 3600 cases, in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, only one\r\nchild reached 11 pounds.\r\n\r\nThere was a child born in Sussex in 1869 which weighed 13 1/2 pounds\r\nand measured 26 1/2 inches. Warren delivered a woman in Derbyshire of\r\nmale twins, one weighing 17 pounds 8 ounces and the other 18 pounds.\r\nThe placenta weighed 4 pounds, and there was an ordinary pailful of\r\nliquor amnii. Both the twins were muscular and well formed; the parents\r\nwere of ordinary stature, and at last reports the mother was rapidly\r\nconvalescing. Burgess mentions an 18-pound new-born child; end Meadows\r\nhas seen a similar instance. Eddowes speaks of the birth of a child at\r\nCrewe, a male, which weighed 20 pounds 2 ounces and was 23 inches long.\r\nIt was 14 1/2 inches about the chest, symmetrically developed, and\r\nlikely to live. The mother, who was a schoolmistress of thirty-three,\r\nhad borne two previous children, both of large size. In this instance\r\nthe gestation had not been prolonged, the delivery was spontaneous, and\r\nthere was no laceration of the parts.\r\n\r\nChubb says that on Christmas Day, 1852, there was a child delivered\r\nweighing 21 pounds. The labor was not severe and the other children of\r\nthe family were exceptionally large. Dickinson describes a woman, a\r\ntertipara, who had a most difficult labor and bore an extremely large\r\nchild. She had been thirty-six hours in parturition, and by\r\nevisceration and craniotomy was delivered of a child weighing 16\r\npounds. Her first child weighed 9 pounds, her second 20, and her third,\r\nthe one described, cost her her life soon after delivery.\r\n\r\nThere is a history of a Swedish woman in Boston who was delivered by\r\nthe forceps of her first child, which weighed 19 3/4 pounds and which\r\nwas 25 3/4 inches long. The circumference of the head was 16 3/4\r\ninches, of the neck 9 3/4, and of the thigh 10 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\nRice speaks of a child weighing 20 1/4 pounds at birth. Johnston\r\ndescribes a male infant who was born on November 26, 1848, weighing 20\r\npounds, and Smith another of the same weight. Baldwin quotes the case\r\nof a woman who after having three miscarriages at last had a child that\r\nweighed 23 pounds. In the delivery there was extensive laceration of\r\nthe anterior wall of the vagina; the cervix and perineum, together with\r\nan inch of the rectum, were completely destroyed.\r\n\r\nBeach describes a birth of a young giant weighing 23 3/4 pounds.  Its\r\nmother was Mrs. Bates, formerly Anna Swann, the giantess who married\r\nCaptain Bates. Labor was rather slow, but she was successfully\r\ndelivered of a healthy child weighing 23 3/4 pounds and 30 inches long.\r\nThe secundines weighed ten pounds and there were nine quarts of\r\namniotic fluid.\r\n\r\nThere is a recent record of a Cesarian section performed on a woman of\r\nforty in her twelfth pregnancy and one month beyond term. The fetus,\r\nwhich was almost exsanguinated by amputation, weighed 22 1/2 pounds.\r\nBumm speaks of the birth of a premature male infant weighing 4320 gm.\r\n(9 1/2 pounds) and measuring 54 cm.  long. Artificial labor had been\r\ninduced at the thirty-fifth week in the hope of delivering a living\r\nchild, the three preceding infants having all been still-born on\r\naccount of their large size. Although the mother's pelvis was wide, the\r\ndisposition to bear huge infants was so great as to render the woman\r\nvirtually barren.\r\n\r\nCongenital asymmetry and hemihypertrophy of the body are most peculiar\r\nanomalies and must not be confounded with acromegaly or myxedema, in\r\nboth of which there is similar lack of symmetric development. There\r\nseems to be no satisfactory clue to the causation of these\r\nabnormalisms. Most frequently the left side is the least developed, and\r\nthere is a decided difference in the size of the extremities.\r\n\r\nFinlayson reports a case of a child affected with congenital unilateral\r\nhypertrophy associated with patches of cutaneous congestion. Logan\r\nmentions hypertrophy in the right half of the body in a child of four,\r\nfirst noticed shortly after birth; Langlet also speaks of a case of\r\ncongenital hypertrophy of the right side. Broca and Trelat were among\r\nthe first observers to discuss this anomaly.\r\n\r\nTilanus of Munich in 1893 reported a case of hemihypertrophy in a girl\r\nof ten. The whole right half of the body was much smaller and better\r\ndeveloped than the left, resulting in a limping gait.  The electric\r\nreaction and the reflexes showed no abnormality. The asymmetry was\r\nfirst observed when the child was three. Mobius and Demme report\r\nsimilar cases.\r\n\r\nAdams reports an unusual case of hemihypertrophy in a boy of ten.\r\nThere was nothing noteworthy in the family history, and the patient had\r\nsuffered from none of the diseases of childhood.  Deformity was\r\nnoticeable at birth, but not to such a degree relatively as at a later\r\nperiod. The increased growth affected the entire right half of the\r\nbody, including the face, but was most noticeable in the leg, thigh,\r\nand buttock. Numerous telangiectatic spots were scattered irregularly\r\nover the body, but most thickly on the right side, especially on the\r\nouter surface of the leg. The accompanying illustration represents the\r\nchild's appearance at the time of report.\r\n\r\nJacobson reports the history of a female child of three years with\r\nnearly universal giant growth (Riesenwuchs). At first this case was\r\nerroneously diagnosed as acromegaly. The hypertrophy affected the face,\r\nthe genitals, the left side of the trunk, and all the limbs.\r\n\r\nMilne records a case of hemihypertrophy in a female child of one year.\r\nThe only deviation from uniform excess of size of the right side was\r\nshown in the forefinger and thumb, which were of the same size as on\r\nthe other hand; and the left side showed no overgrowth in any of its\r\nmembers except a little enlargement of the second toe. While\r\nhypertrophy of one side is the usual description of such cases, the\r\nauthor suggests that there may be a condition of defect upon the other\r\nside, and he is inclined to think that in this case the limb, hand, and\r\nfoot of the left side seemed rather below the average of the child's\r\nage. In this case, as in others previously reported, there were\r\nnumerous telangiectatic spots of congestion scattered irregularly over\r\nthe body. Milne also reported later to the Sheffield Medico-Chirurgical\r\nSociety an instance of unilateral hypertrophy in a female child of\r\nnineteen months. The right side was involved and the anomaly was\r\nbelieved to be due to a deficiency of growth of the left side as well\r\nas over-development of the right. There were six teeth on the right\r\nside and one on the left.\r\n\r\nObesity.--The abnormality of the adipose system, causing in consequence\r\nan augmentation of the natural volume of the subject, should be\r\ndescribed with other anomalies of size and stature.  Obesity may be\r\npartial, as seen in the mammae or in the abdomen of both women and men,\r\nor it may be general; and it is of general obesity that we shall\r\nchiefly deal. Lipomata, being distinctly pathologic formations, will be\r\nleft for another chapter.\r\n\r\nThe cases of obesity in infancy and childhood are of considerable\r\ninterest, and we sometimes see cases that have been termed examples of\r\n\"congenital corpulency.\" Figure 167 represents a baby of thirteen\r\nmonths that weighed 75 pounds. Figure 168 shows another example of\r\ninfantile obesity, known as \"Baby Chambers.\" Elliotson describes a\r\nfemale infant not a year old which weighed 60 pounds. There is an\r\ninstance on record of a girl of four who weighed 256 pounds Tulpius\r\nmentions a girl of five who weighed 150 pounds and had the strength of\r\na man. He says that the acquisition of fat did not commence until some\r\ntime after birth.  Ebstein reports an instance given to him by Fisher\r\nof Moscow of a child in Pomerania who at the age of six weighed 137\r\npounds and was 46 inches tall; her girth was 46 inches and the\r\ncircumference of her head was 24 inches. She was the offspring of\r\nordinary-sized parents, and lived in narrow and sometimes needy\r\ncircumstances. The child was intelligent and had an animated expression\r\nof countenance.\r\n\r\nBartholinus mentions a girl of eleven who weighed over 200 pounds.\r\nThere is an instance recorded of a young girl in Russia who weighed\r\nnearly 200 pounds when but twelve. Wulf, quoted by Ebstein, describes a\r\nchild which died at birth weighing 295 ounces. It was well proportioned\r\nand looked like a child three months old, except that it had an\r\nenormous development of fatty tissue. The parents were not excessively\r\nlarge, and the mother stated that she had had children before of the\r\nsame proportions.  Grisolles mentions a child who was so fat at twelve\r\nmonths that there was constant danger of suffocation; but, marvelous to\r\nrelate, it lost all its obesity when two and a half, and later was\r\nremarkable for its slender figure. Figure 169 shows a girl born in\r\nCarbon County, Pa., who weighed 201 pounds when nine years old.\r\nMcNaughton describes Susanna Tripp, who at six years of age weighed 203\r\npounds and was 3 feet 6 inches tall and measured 4 feet 2 inches around\r\nthe waist. Her younger sister, Deborah, weighed 119 pounds; neither of\r\nthe two weighed over 7 pounds at birth and both began to grow at the\r\nfourth month. On October, 1788, there died at an inn in the city of\r\nYork the surprising \"Worcestershire Girl\" at the age of five. She had\r\nan exceedingly beautiful face and was quite active. She was 4 feet in\r\nheight and larger around the breast and waist; her thigh measured 18\r\ninches and she weighed nearly 200 pounds. In February, 1814, Mr. S.\r\nPauton was married to the only daughter of Thomas Allanty of Yorkshire;\r\nalthough she was but thirteen she was 13 stone weight (182 pounds). At\r\nseven years she had weighed 7 stone (98 pounds). Williams mentions\r\nseveral instances of fat children. The first was a German girl who at\r\nbirth weighed 13 pounds; at six months, 42 pounds; at four years, 150\r\npounds; and at twenty years, 450 pounds. Isaac Butterfield, born near\r\nLeeds in 1781, weighed 100 pounds in 1782 and was 3 feet 13 inches\r\ntall. There was a child named Everitt, exhibited in London in 1780, who\r\nat eleven months was 3 feet 9 inches tall and measured around the loins\r\nover 3 feet. William Abernethy at the age of thirteen weighed 22 stone\r\n(308 pounds) and measured 57 inches around the waist. He was 5 feet 6\r\ninches tall. There was a girl of ten who was 1.45 meters (4 feet 9\r\ninches) high and weighed 175 pounds. Her manners were infantile and her\r\nintellectual development was much retarded. She spoke with difficulty\r\nin a deep voice; she had a most voracious appetite.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Physical Society of Vienna on December 4, 1894,\r\nthere was shown a girl of five and a half who weighed 250 pounds. She\r\nwas just shedding her first teeth; owing to the excess of fat on her\r\nshort limbs she toddled like an infant.  There was no tendency to\r\nobesity in her family. Up to the eleventh month she was nursed by her\r\nmother, and subsequently fed on cabbage, milk, and vegetable soup. This\r\nchild, who was of Russian descent, was said never to perspire.\r\n\r\nCameron describes a child who at birth weighed 14 pounds, at twelve\r\nmonths she weighed 69 pounds, and at seventeen months 98 pounds. She\r\nwas not weaned until two years old and she then commenced to walk. The\r\nparents were not remarkably large. There is an instance of a boy of\r\nthirteen and a half who weighed 214 pounds. Kaestner speaks of a child\r\nof four who weighed 82 pounds, and Benzenberg noted a child of the same\r\nage who weighed 137.  Hildman, quoted by Picat, speaks of an infant\r\nthree years and ten months old who had a girth of 30 inches. Hillairet\r\nknew of a child of five which weighed 125 pounds. Botta cites several\r\ninstances of preternaturally stout children. One child died at the age\r\nof three weighing 90 pounds, another at the age of five weighed 100\r\npounds, and a third at the age of two weighed 75 pounds.\r\n\r\nFigure 170 represents Miss \"Millie Josephine\" of Chicago, a recent\r\nexhibitionist, who at the reputed age of thirteen was 5 feet 6 inches\r\ntall and weighed 422 pounds.\r\n\r\nGeneral Remarks.--It has been chiefly in Great Britain and in Holland\r\nthat the most remarkable instances of obesity have been seen,\r\nespecially in the former country colossal weights have been recorded.\r\nIn some countries corpulency has been considered an adornment of the\r\nfemale sex. Hesse-Wartegg refers to the Jewesses of Tunis, who when\r\nscarcely ten years old are subjected to systematic treatment by\r\nconfinement in narrow, dark rooms, where they are fed on farinaceous\r\nfoods and the flesh of young puppies until they are almost a shapeless\r\nmass of fat. According to Ebstein, the Moorish women reach with\r\nastonishing rapidity the desired embonpoint on a diet of dates and a\r\npeculiar kind of meal.\r\n\r\nIn some nations and families obesity is hereditary, and generations\r\ncome and go without a change in the ordinary conformation of the\r\nrepresentatives. In other people slenderness is equally persistent, and\r\nefforts to overcome this peculiarity of nature are without avail.\r\n\r\nTreatment of Obesity.--Many persons, the most famous of whom was\r\nBanting, have advanced theories to reduce corpulency and to improve\r\nslenderness; but they have been uniformly unreliable, and the whole\r\nsubject of stature-development presents an almost unexplored field for\r\ninvestigation. Recently, Leichtenstein, observing in a case of myxedema\r\ntreated with the thyroid gland that the subcutaneous fat disappeared\r\nwith the continuance of the treatment, was led to adopt this treatment\r\nfor obesity itself and reports striking results. The diet of the\r\npatient remained the same, and as the appetite was not diminished by\r\nthe treatment the loss of weight was evidently due to other causes than\r\naltered alimentation. He holds that the observations in myxedema, in\r\nobesity, and psoriasis warrant the belief that the thyroid gland\r\neliminates a material having a regulating influence upon the\r\nconstitution of the panniculus adiposus and upon the nutrition of the\r\nskin in general. There were 25 patients in all; in 22 the effect was\r\nentirely satisfactory, the loss of weight amounting to as much as 9.5\r\nkilos (21 pounds). Of the three cases in which the result was not\r\nsatisfactory, one had nephritis with severe Graves' disease, and the\r\nthird psoriasis. Charrin has used the injections of thyroid extract\r\nwith decided benefit. So soon as the administration of the remedy was\r\nstopped the loss of weight ceased, but with the renewal of the remedy\r\nthe loss of weight again ensued to a certain point, beyond which the\r\nextract seemed powerless to act. Ewald also reports good results from\r\nthis treatment of obesity.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Instances of Obesity.--From time immemorial fat men and\r\nwomen have been the object of curiosity and the number who have\r\nexhibited themselves is incalculable. Nearly every circus and dime\r\nmuseum has its example, and some of the most famous have in this way\r\nbeen able to accumulate fortunes.\r\n\r\nAthenaeus has written quite a long discourse on persons of note who in\r\nthe olden times were distinguished for their obesity. He quotes a\r\ndescription of Denys, the tyrant of Heraclea, who was so enormous that\r\nhe was in constant danger of suffocation; most of the time he was in a\r\nstupor or asleep, a peculiarity of very fat people. His doctors had\r\nneedles put in the back of his chairs to keep him from falling asleep\r\nwhen sitting up and thus incurring the danger of suffocation. In the\r\nsame work Athenaeus speaks of several sovereigns noted for their\r\nobesity; among others he says that Ptolemy VII, son of Alexander, was\r\nso fat that, according to Posidonius, when he walked he had to be\r\nsupported on both sides.  Nevertheless, when he was excited at a\r\nrepast, he would mount the highest couch and execute with agility his\r\naccustomed dance.\r\n\r\nAccording to old chronicles the cavaliers at Rome who grew fat were\r\ncondemned to lose their horses and were placed in retirement. During\r\nthe Middle Ages, according to Guillaume in his \"Vie de Suger,\" obesity\r\nwas considered a grace of God.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent people in the olden time noted for their embonpoint\r\nwere Agesilas, the orator Licinius Calvus, who several times opposed\r\nCicero, the actor Lucius, and others. Among men of more modern times we\r\ncan mention William the Conqueror; Charles le Gros; Louis le Gros;\r\nHumbert II, Count of Maurienne; Henry I, King of Navarre; Henry III,\r\nCount of Champagne; Conan III, Duke of Brittany; Sancho I, King of\r\nLeon; Alphonse II, King of Portugal; the Italian poet Bruni, who died\r\nin 1635; Vivonne, a general under Louis XIV; the celebrated German\r\nbotanist Dillenius; Haller; Frederick I, King of Wurtemberg, and Louis\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nProbably the most famous of all the fat men was Daniel Lambert, born\r\nMarch 13, 1770, in the parish of Saint Margaret, Leicester.  He did not\r\ndiffer from other youths until fourteen. He started to learn the trade\r\nof a die-sinker and engraver in Birmingham. At about nineteen he began\r\nto believe he would be very heavy and developed great strength. He\r\ncould lift 500 pounds with ease and could kick seven feet high while\r\nstanding on one leg. In 1793 he weighed 448 pounds; at this time he\r\nbecame sensitive as to his appearance. In June, 1809, he weighed 52\r\nstone 11 pounds (739 pounds), and measured over 3 yards around the body\r\nand over 1 yard around the leg. He had many visitors, and it is said\r\nthat once, when the dwarf Borwilaski came to see him, he asked the\r\nlittle man how much cloth he needed for a suit. When told about 3/4 of\r\na yard, he replied that one of his sleeves would be ample.  Another\r\nfamous fat man was Edward Bright, sometimes called \"the fat man of\r\nEssex.\" He weighed 616 pounds. In the same journal that records\r\nBright's weight is an account of a man exhibited in Holland who weighed\r\n503 pounds.\r\n\r\nWadd, a physician, himself an enormous man, wrote a treatise on obesity\r\nand used his own portrait for a frontispiece. He speaks of Doctor\r\nBeddoes, who was so uncomfortably fat that a lady of Clifton called him\r\na \"walking feather bed.\" He mentions Doctor Stafford, who was so\r\nenormous that this epitaph was ascribed to him:--\r\n\r\n\"Take heed, O good traveler! and do not tread hard, For here lies Dr.\r\nStafford, in all this churchyard.\"\r\n\r\nWadd has gathered some instances, a few of which will be cited.  At\r\nStaunton, January 2, 1816, there died Samuel Sugars, Gent., who weighed\r\nwith a single wood coffin 50 stone (700 pounds).  Jacob Powell died in\r\n1764, weighing 660 pounds. It took 16 men to carry him to his grave.\r\nMr. Baker of Worcester, supposed to be larger than Bright, was interred\r\nin a coffin that was larger than an ordinary hearse. In 1797 there was\r\nburied Philip Hayes, a professor of music, who was as heavy as Bright\r\n(616 pounds).\r\n\r\nMr. Spooner, an eminent farmer of Warwickshire, who died in 1775, aged\r\nfifty-seven, weighed 569 pounds and measured over 4 feet across the\r\nshoulders. The two brothers Stoneclift of Halifax, Yorkshire, together\r\nweighed 980 pounds.\r\n\r\nKeysler in his travels speaks of a corpulent Englishman who in passing\r\nthrough Savoy had to use 12 chairmen; he says that the man weighed 550\r\npounds. It is recorded on the tombstone of James Parsons, a fat man of\r\nTeddington, who died March 7, 1743, that he had often eaten a whole\r\nshoulder of mutton and a peck of hasty pudding. Keysler mentions a\r\nyoung Englishman living in Lincoln who was accustomed to eat 18 pounds\r\nof meat daily. He died in 1724 at the age of twenty-eight, weighing 530\r\npounds. In 1815 there died in Trenaw, in Cornwall, a person known as\r\n\"Giant Chillcot.\" He measured at the breast 6 feet 9 inches and weighed\r\n460 pounds. One of his stockings held 6 gallons of wheat. In 1822 there\r\nwas reported to be a Cambridge student who could not go out in the\r\ndaytime without exciting astonishment. The fat of his legs overhung his\r\nshoes like the fat in the legs of Lambert and Bright. Dr. Short\r\nmentions a lady who died of corpulency in her twenty-fifth year\r\nweighing over 50 stone (700 pounds). Catesby speaks of a man who\r\nweighed 500 pounds, and Coe mentions another who weighed 584 pounds.\r\nFabricius and Godart speak of obesity so excessive as to cause death.\r\nThere is a case reported from the French of a person who weighed 800\r\npounds. Smetius speaks of George Fredericus, an office-holder in\r\nBrandenburgh, who weighed 427 pounds.\r\n\r\nDupuytren gives the history of Marie Francoise-Clay, who attained such\r\ncelebrity for her obesity. She was born in poverty, reached puberty at\r\nthirteen, and married at twenty-five, at which age she was already the\r\nstoutest woman of her neighborhood notwithstanding her infirmity. She\r\nfollowed her husband, who was an old-clothes dealer, afoot from town to\r\ntown. She bore six children, in whom nothing extraordinary was noticed.\r\nThe last one was born when she was thirty-five years old. Neither the\r\nbirths, her travels, nor her poverty, which sometimes forced her to beg\r\nat church doors, arrested the progress of the obesity. At the age of\r\nforty she was 5 feet 1 inch high and one inch greater about the waist.\r\nHer head was small and her neck was entirely obliterated. Her breasts\r\nwere over a yard in circumference and hung as low as the umbilicus. Her\r\narms were elevated and kept from her body by the fat in her axillae.\r\nHer belly was enormous and was augmented by six pregnancies. Her thighs\r\nand haunches were in proportion to her general contour. At forty she\r\nceased to menstruate and soon became afflicted with organic heart\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nFournier quotes an instance of a woman in Paris who at twenty-four, the\r\ntime of her death, weighed 486 pounds. Not being able to mount any\r\nconveyance or carriage in the city, she walked from place to place,\r\nfinding difficulty not in progression, but in keeping her equilibrium.\r\nRoger Byrne, who lived in Rosenalis, Queen's County, Ireland, died of\r\nexcessive fatness at the age of fifty-four, weighing 52 stone. Percy\r\nand Laurent speak of a young German of twenty who weighed 450 pounds.\r\nAt birth he weighed 13 pounds, at six months 42, and at four years 150\r\npounds. He was 5 feet 5 inches tall and the same in circumference.\r\nWilliam Campbell, the landlord of the Duke of Wellington in\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, was 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 728 pounds. He\r\nmeasured 96 inches around the shoulders, 85 inches around the waist,\r\nand 35 inches around the calf. He was born at Glasgow in 1856, and was\r\nnot quite twenty-two when last measured.  To illustrate the rate of\r\naugmentation, he weighed 4 stone at nine months and at ten years 18\r\nstone. He was one of a family of seven children. His appetite was not\r\nmore than the average, and he was moderate as regards the use of\r\nliquors, but a great smoker Notwithstanding his corpulency, he was\r\nintelligent and affable.\r\n\r\nMiss Conley, a member of an American traveling circus, who weighed 479\r\npounds, was smothered in bed by rolling over on her face; she was\r\nunable to turn on her back without assistance.\r\n\r\nThere was a girl who died at Plaisance near Paris in 1890 who weighed\r\n470 pounds or more. In 1889 an impresario undertook to exhibit her; but\r\neight men could not move her from her room, and as she could not pass\r\nthrough the door the idea was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere was a colored woman who died near Baltimore who weighed 850\r\npounds, exceeding the great Daniel Lambert by 120 pounds. The journal\r\nreporting this case quotes the Medical Record as saying that there was\r\na man in North Carolina, who was born in 1798, who was 7 feet 8 inches\r\ntall and weighed over 1000 pounds, probably the largest man that ever\r\nlived. Hutchison says that he Saw in the Infirmary at Kensington, under\r\nPorter's care, a remarkable example of obesity. The woman was only just\r\nable to walk about and presented a close resemblance to Daniel Lambert.\r\nObesity forced her to leave her occupation. The accumulation of fat on\r\nthe abdomen, back, and thighs was enormous.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent number of La Liberte, a young woman of\r\nPennsylvania, although only sixteen years old, weighs 450 pounds.  Her\r\nwaist measures 61 inches in circumference and her neck 22 inches. The\r\nsame paper says that on one of the quays of Paris may be seen a\r\nwine-shop keeper with whom this Pennsylvania girl could not compare. It\r\nis said that this curiosity of the Notre-Dame quarter uses three large\r\nchairs while sitting behind her specially constructed bar. There is\r\nanother Paris report of a man living in Switzerland who weighs more\r\nthan 40 stone (560 pounds) and eats five times as much as an ordinary\r\nperson. When traveling he finds the greatest difficulty in entering an\r\nordinary railway carriage, and as a rule contents himself in the\r\nluggage van.  Figure 171 represents an extremely fat woman with a\r\nwell-developed beard. To end this list of obese individuals, we mention\r\nan old gentleman living in San Francisco who, having previously been\r\nthin, gained 14 pounds in his seventieth year and 14 pounds each of\r\nseven succeeding years.\r\n\r\nSimulation of Obesity.--General dropsy, elephantiasis, lipomata,\r\nmyxedema, and various other affections in which there is a hypertrophic\r\nchange of the connective tissues may be mistaken for general obesity;\r\non the other hand, a fatty, pendulous abdomen may simulate the\r\nappearances of pregnancy or even of ovarian cyst.\r\n\r\nDercum of Philadelphia has described a variety of obesity which he has\r\ncalled \"adiposis dolorosa,\" in which there is an enormous growth of\r\nfat, sometimes limited, sometimes spread all over the body, this\r\ncondition differing from that of general lipomatosis in its rarity, in\r\nthe mental symptoms, in the headache, and the generally painful\r\ncondition complained of. In some of the cases examined by Dercum he\r\nfound that the thyroid was indurated and infiltrated by calcareous\r\ndeposits. The disease is not myxedema because there is no peculiar\r\nphysiognomy, no spade-like hands nor infiltrated skin, no alteration of\r\nthe speech, etc. Dercum considers it a connective-tissue dystrophy--a\r\nfatty metamorphosis of various stages, possibly a neuritis. The first\r\nof Dercum's cases was a widow of Irish birth, who died both alcoholic\r\nand syphilitic. When forty-eight or forty-nine her arms began to\r\nenlarge. In June, 1887, the enlargement affected the shoulders, arms,\r\nback, and sides of the chest. The parts affected were elastic, and\r\nthere was no pitting. In some places the fat was lobulated, in others\r\nit appeared as though filled with bundles of worms. The skin was not\r\nthickened and the muscles were not involved. In the right arm there was\r\nunendurable pain to the touch, and this was present in a lesser degree\r\nin the left arm.  Cutaneous sensibility was lessened. On June 13th a\r\nchill was followed by herpes over the left arm and chest, and later on\r\nthe back and on the front of the chest. The temperature was normal.\r\nThe second case was a married Englishwoman of sixty-four. The enlarged\r\ntissue was very unevenly distributed, and sensibility was the same as\r\nin the previous case. At the woman's death she weighed 300 pounds, and\r\nthe fat over the abdomen was three inches thick. The third case was a\r\nGerman woman in whom were seen soft, fat-like masses in various\r\nsituations over either biceps, over the outer and posterior aspect of\r\neither arm, and two large masses over the belly; there was excessive\r\nprominence of the mons veneris. At the autopsy the heart weighed 8 1/2\r\nounces, and the fat below the umbilicus was seven inches thick.\r\n\r\nAbnormal Leanness.--In contrast to the fat men are the so-called\r\n\"living skeletons,\" or men who have attained notice by reason of\r\nabsence of the normal adipose tissue. The semimythical poet Philotus\r\nwas so thin that it was said that he fastened lead on his shoes to\r\nprevent his being blown away,--a condition the opposite of that of\r\nDionysius of Heraclea, who, after choking to death from his fat, could\r\nhardly be moved to his grave.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1754, there died in Glamorganshire of mere old age and\r\ngradual decay a little Welshman, Hopkin Hopkins, aged seventeen years.\r\nHe had been recently exhibited in London as a natural curiosity; he had\r\nnever weighed over 17 pounds, and for the last three years of his life\r\nnever more than 12 pounds. His parents still had six children left, all\r\nof whom were normal and healthy except a girl of twelve, who only\r\nweighed 18 pounds and bore marks of old age.\r\n\r\nThere was a \"living skeleton\" brought to England in 1825 by the name of\r\nClaude Seurat. He was born in 1798 and was in his twenty-seventh year.\r\nHe usually ate in the course of a day a penny roll and drank a small\r\nquantity of wine. His skeleton was plainly visible, over which the skin\r\nwas stretched tightly. The distance from the chest to the spine was\r\nless than 3 inches, and internally this distance was less. The\r\npulsations of the heart were plainly visible. He was in good health and\r\nslept well. His voice was very weak and shrill. The circumference of\r\nthis man's biceps was only 4 inches. The artist Cruikshank has made\r\nseveral drawings of Seurat.\r\n\r\nCalvin Edson was another living skeleton. In 1813 he was in the army at\r\nthe battle of Plattsburg, and had lain down in the cold and become\r\nbenumbed. At this time he weighed 125 pounds and was twenty-five years\r\nold. In 1830 he weighed but 60 pounds, though 5 feet 4 inches tall. He\r\nwas in perfect health and could chop a cord of wood without fatigue; he\r\nwas the father of four children.\r\n\r\nSalter speaks of a man in 1873 who was thirty-two years of age and only\r\nweighed 49 pounds. He was 4 feet 6 inches tall: his forehead measured\r\nin circumference 20 1/2 inches and his chest 27 inches. His genitals,\r\nboth internal and external, were defectively developed. Figure 175\r\nrepresents the well-known Ohio \"living skeleton,\" J. W. Coffey, who has\r\nbeen exhibited all over the Continent. His good health and appetite\r\nwere proverbial among his acquaintances.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the so-called \"living skeletons\" are merely cases of\r\nextreme muscular atrophy. As a prominent example of this class the\r\nexhibitionist, Rosa Lee Plemons at the age of eighteen weighed only 27\r\npounds. Figure 177 shows another case of extraordinary atrophic\r\ncondition of all the tissues of the body associated with\r\nnondevelopment. These persons are always sickly and exhibit all the\r\nsymptoms of progressive muscular atrophy, and cannot therefore be\r\nclassed with the true examples of thinness, in which the health is but\r\nslightly affected or possibly perfect health is enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY.\r\n\r\nScope of the Present Article.--The limits of space in this work render\r\nimpossible a scientific discussion upon the most interesting subject of\r\nlongevity, and the reader is referred to some of the modern works\r\ndevoted exclusively to this subject. In reviewing the examples of\r\nextreme age found in the human race it will be our object to lay before\r\nthe reader the most remarkable instances of longevity that have been\r\nauthentically recorded, to cite the source of the information, when\r\npossible to give explanatory details, and to report any relative points\r\nof value and interest. Throughout the article occasional facts will be\r\ngiven to show in what degree character, habit, and temperament\r\ninfluence longevity, and in what state of mind and body and under what\r\ncircumstances man has obtained the highest age.\r\n\r\nGeneral Opinions.--There have been many learned authorities who\r\ninvariably discredit all accounts of extraordinary age, and contend\r\nthat there has never been an instance of a man living beyond the\r\ncentury mark whose age has been substantiated by satisfactory proof.\r\nSuch extremists as Sir G. Cornewall Lewis and Thoms contend that since\r\nthe Christian era no person of royal or noble line mentioned in history\r\nwhose birth was authentically recorded at its occurrence has reached\r\none hundred years. They have taken the worst station in life in which\r\nto find longevity as their field of observation. Longevity is always\r\nmost common in the middle and lower classes, in which we cannot expect\r\nto find the records preserved with historical correctness.\r\n\r\nThe Testimony of Statistics.--Walford in his wonderful \"Encyclopedia of\r\nInsurance\" says that in England the \"Royal Exchange\" for a period of\r\none hundred and thirty-five years had insured no life which survived\r\nninety-six. The \"London Assurance\" for the same period had no clients\r\nwho lived over ninety, and the \"Equitable\" had only one at ninety-six.\r\nIn an English Tontine there was in 1693 a person who died at one\r\nhundred; and in Perth there lived a nominee at one hundred and\r\ntwenty-two and another at one hundred and seven. On the other hand, a\r\nwriter in the Strand Magazine points out that an insurance investigator\r\nsome years ago gathered a list of 225 centenarians of almost every\r\nsocial rank and many nationalities, but the majority of them Britons or\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing Walford's statistics we must remember that it has only\r\nbeen in recent years that the middle and lower classes of people have\r\ntaken insurance on their lives. Formerly only the wealthy and those\r\nexposed to early demise were in the habit of insuring.\r\n\r\nDr. Ogle of the English Registrar-General's Department gives tables of\r\nexpectancy that show that 82 males and 225 females out of 1,000,000 are\r\nalive at one hundred years. The figures are based on the death-rates of\r\nthe years 1871-80.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Hardy in the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\nsixteenth centuries are said to indicate that three-score-and-ten was\r\nconsidered old age; yet many old tombstones and monuments contain\r\ninscriptions recording age far beyond this, and even the pages of\r\nordinary biographies disprove the alleged results of Hardy's research.\r\n\r\nIn all statistical work of an individual type the histories of the\r\nlower classes are almost excluded; in the olden times only the lives\r\nand movements of the most prominent are thought worthy of record. The\r\nreliable parish register is too often monopolized by the gentry,\r\ninferior births not being thought worth recording.\r\n\r\nMany eminent scientists say that the natural term of the life of an\r\nanimal is five times the period needed for its development.  Taking\r\ntwenty-one as the time of maturity in man, the natural term of human\r\nlife would be one hundred and five. Sir Richard Owen fixes it at one\r\nhundred and three and a few months.\r\n\r\nCensuses of Centenarians.--Dr. Farr, the celebrated English\r\nRegistrar-General, is credited with saying that out of every 1,000,000\r\npeople in England only 223 live to be one hundred years old, making an\r\naverage of one to 4484. French says that during a period of ten years,\r\nfrom 1881 to 1890, in Massachusetts, there were 203 deaths of persons\r\npast the age of one hundred, making an average, with a population of\r\n394,484, of one in 1928. Of French's centenarians 165 were between one\r\nhundred and one hundred and five; 35 were between one hundred and five\r\nand one hundred and ten; five were between one hundred and ten and one\r\nhundred and fifteen; and one was one hundred and eighteen. Of the 203,\r\n153 were females and 50 males. There are 508 people in Iowa who are\r\nmore than ninety years of age. There are 21 who are more than one\r\nhundred years old. One person is one hundred and fifteen years old, two\r\nare one hundred and fourteen, and the remaining 18 are from one hundred\r\nto one hundred and seven.\r\n\r\nIn the British Medical Journal for 1886 there is an account of a report\r\nof centenarians. Fifty-two cases were analyzed. One who doubts the\r\npossibility of a man reaching one hundred would find this report of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe Paris correspondent to the London Telegraph is accredited with the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\"A census of centenarians has been taken in France, and the results,\r\nwhich have been published, show that there are now alive in this\r\ncountry 213 persons who are over one hundred years old.  Of these 147\r\nare women, the alleged stronger sex being thus only able to show 66\r\nspecimens who are managing to still \"husband out life's taper\" after\r\nthe lapse of a century. The preponderance of centenarians of the\r\nsupposed weaker sex has led to the revival of some amusing theories\r\ntending to explain this phenomenon. One cause of the longevity of women\r\nis stated to be, for instance, their propensity to talk much and to\r\ngossip, perpetual prattle being highly conducive, it is said, to the\r\nactive circulation of the blood, while the body remains unfatigued and\r\nundamaged. More serious theorists or statisticians, while commenting on\r\nthe subject of the relative longevity of the sexes, attribute the\r\nsupremacy of woman in the matter to the well-known cause, namely, that\r\nin general she leads a more calm and unimpassioned existence than a\r\nman, whose life is so often one of toil, trouble, and excitement.\r\nSetting aside these theories, however, the census of French\r\ncentenarians is not devoid of interest in some of its details. At\r\nRocroi an old soldier who fought under the First Napoleon in Russia\r\npassed the century limit last year. A wearer of the St. Helena medal--a\r\ndistinction awarded to survivors of the Napoleonic campaigns, and who\r\nlives at Grand Fayt, also in the Nord--is one hundred and three years\r\nold, and has been for the last sixty-eight years a sort of rural\r\npoliceman in his native commune. It is a rather remarkable fact in\r\nconnection with the examples of longevity cited that in almost every\r\ninstance the centenarian is a person in the humblest rank of life.\r\nAccording to the compilers of these records, France can claim the honor\r\nof having possessed the oldest woman of modern times. This venerable\r\ndame, having attained one hundred and fifty years, died peacefully in a\r\nhamlet in the Haute Garonne, where she had spent her prolonged\r\nexistence, subsisting during the closing decade of her life on goat's\r\nmilk and cheese. The woman preserved all her mental faculties to the\r\nlast, but her body became attenuated to an extraordinary degree, and\r\nher skin was like parchment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last ten years the St. James' Gazette has kept track of 378\r\ncentenarians, of whom 143 were men and 235 were women. A writer to the\r\nStrand Magazine tells of 14 centenarians living in Great Britain within\r\nthe last half-dozen years.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to review the statistics of Haller, who has\r\ncollected the greatest number of instances of extreme longevity.  He\r\nfound:--\r\n\r\n 1000 persons who lived from 100 to 110\r\n   15 persons who lived from 130 to 140\r\n   60   \"      \"    \"    \"   110 to 120\r\n    6   \"      \"    \"    \"   140 to 150\r\n   29   \"      \"    \"    \"   120 to 130\r\n    1 person   \"    \"    \"       to 169\r\n\r\nEffect of Class-Influences, Occupation, etc.--Unfortunately for the\r\nsake of authenticity, all the instances of extreme age in this country\r\nhave been from persons in the lower walks of life or from obscure parts\r\nof the country, where little else than hearsay could be procured to\r\nverify them. It must also be said that it is only among people of this\r\nclass that we can expect to find parallels of the instances of extreme\r\nlongevity of former times.  The inhabitants of the higher stations of\r\nlife, the population of thickly settled communities, are living in an\r\nage and under conditions almost incompatible with longevity. In fact,\r\nthe strain of nervous energy made necessary by the changed conditions\r\nof business and mode of living really predisposes to premature decay.\r\n\r\nThose who object to the reliability of reports of postcentenarianism\r\nseem to lose sight of these facts, and because absolute proof and\r\nparallel cannot be obtained they deny the possibility without giving\r\nthe subject full thought and reason.  As tending to substantiate the\r\nmultitude of instances are the opinions of such authorities as\r\nHufeland, Buffon, Haller, and Flourens. Walter Savage Landor on being\r\ntold that a man in Russia was living at one hundred and thirty-two\r\nreplied that he was possibly older, as people when they get on in years\r\nare prone to remain silent as to the number of their years--a statement\r\nthat can hardly be denied. One of the strongest disbelievers in extreme\r\nage almost disproved in his own life the statement that there were no\r\ncentenarians.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that in the earliest periods of the world's\r\nhistory the lives of the inhabitants were more youthful and perfect;\r\nthat these primitive men had gigantic size, incredible strength, and\r\nmost astonishing duration of life. It is to this tendency that we are\r\nindebted for the origin of many romantic tales. Some have not hesitated\r\nto ascribe to our forefather Adam the height of 900 yards and the age\r\nof almost a thousand years; but according to Hufeland acute theologians\r\nhave shown that the chronology of the early ages was not the same as\r\nthat used in the present day. According to this same authority Hensler\r\nhas proved that the year at the time of Abraham consisted of but three\r\nmonths, that it was afterward extended to eight, and finally in the\r\ntime of Joseph to twelve. Certain Eastern nations, it is said, still\r\nreckon but three months to the year; this substantiates the opinion of\r\nHensler, and, as Hufeland says, it would be inexplicable why the life\r\nof man should be shortened nearly one-half immediately after the flood.\r\n\r\nAccepting these conclusions as correct, the highest recorded age, that\r\nof Methuselah, nine hundred years, will be reduced to about two\r\nhundred, an age that can hardly be called impossible in the face of\r\nsuch an abundance of reports, to which some men of comparatively modern\r\ntimes have approached, and which such substantial authorities as\r\nBuffon, Hufeland, and Flourens believed possible.\r\n\r\nAlchemy and the \"Elixir of Life.\"--The desire for long life and the\r\nacquisition of wealth have indirectly been the stimulus to medical and\r\nphysical investigation, eventually evolving science as we have it now.\r\nThe fundamental principles of nearly every branch of modern science\r\nwere the gradual metamorphoses of the investigations of the old\r\nsearchers after the \"philosopher's stone\" and \"elixir of life.\" The\r\nlong hours of study and experiment in the chase for this\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp were of vast benefit to the coming generations; and to\r\nthese deluded philosophers of the Middle Ages, and even of ancient\r\ntimes, we are doubtless indebted for much in this age of advancement.\r\n\r\nWith a credulous people to work upon, many of the claimants of the\r\ndiscovery of the coveted secret of eternal life must be held as rank\r\nimpostors claiming ridiculous ages for themselves. In the twelfth\r\ncentury Artephius claimed that by the means of his discovery he had\r\nattained one thousand and twenty-five years.  Shortly after him came\r\nAlan de Lisle of Flanders with a reputed fabulous age. In 1244 Albertus\r\nMagnus announced himself as the discoverer. In 1655 the celebrated\r\nDoctor Dee appeared on the scene and had victims by the score. Then\r\ncame the Rosicrucians.  Count Saint-Germain claimed the secret of the\r\n\"philosopher's stone\" and declared to the Court of Louis XV that he was\r\ntwo thousand years old, and a precursor of the mythical \"Wandering\r\nJew,\" who has been immortalized in prose and rhyme and in whose\r\nexistence a great mass of the people recently believed. The last of the\r\ncharlatans who claimed possession of the secret of perpetual life was\r\nJoseph Balsamo, who called himself \"Count of Cagliostro.\" He was born\r\nin Italy in 1743 and acquired a world-wide reputation for his alleged\r\noccult powers and acquisition of the \"philosopher's stone.\" He died in\r\n1795, and since then no one has generally inspired the superstitious\r\nwith credence in this well-worn myth. The ill-fated Ponce de Leon when\r\nhe discovered Florida, in spite of his superior education, announced\r\nhis firm belief in the land of the \"Fountain of Perpetual Youth,\" in\r\nthe pursuit of which he had risked his fortune and life.\r\n\r\nWe wish to emphasize that we by no means assume the responsibility of\r\nthe authenticity of the cases to be quoted, but expressing belief in\r\ntheir possibility, we shall mention some of the extraordinary instances\r\nof longevity derived from an exhaustive research of the literature of\r\nall times. This venerable gallery of Nestors will include those of all\r\nperiods and nations, but as the modern references are more available\r\ngreater attention will be given to them.\r\n\r\nTurning first to the history of the earlier nations, we deduce from\r\nJewish history that Abraham lived to one hundred and seventy-five;\r\nIsaac, likewise a tranquil, peaceful man, to one hundred and eighty;\r\nJacob, who was crafty and cunning, to one hundred and forty-seven;\r\nIshmael, a warrior, to one hundred and thirty-seven; and Joseph, to one\r\nhundred and ten. Moses, a man of extraordinary vigor, which, however,\r\nhe exposed to great cares and fatigues, attained the advanced age of\r\none hundred and twenty; and the warlike and ever-active Joshua lived to\r\none hundred and ten. Lejoucourt gives the following striking parallels:\r\nJohn Glower lived to one hundred and seventy-two, and Abraham to one\r\nhundred and seventy-five; Susan, the wife of Gower, lived to one\r\nhundred and sixty-four, and Sarah, the wife of Abraham, to one hundred\r\nand twenty-seven. The eldest son of the Gower couple was one hundred\r\nand fifteen when last seen, and Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah,\r\nlived to one hundred and eighty.\r\n\r\nHowever replete with fables may be the history of the Kings of Egypt,\r\nnone attained a remarkable age, and the record of the common people is\r\nincomplete or unavailable.\r\n\r\nIf we judge from the accounts of Lucian we must form a high idea of the\r\ngreat age of the Seres, or ancient Chinese. Lucian ascribes this\r\nlongevity to their habit of drinking excessive quantities of water.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks we find several instances of great age in men of\r\nprominence. Hippocrates divided life into seven periods, living himself\r\nbeyond the century mark. Aristotle made three divisions,--the growing\r\nperiod, the stationary period, and the period of decline. Solon made\r\nten divisions of life, and Varro made five. Ovid ingeniously compares\r\nlife to the four seasons.  Epimenides of Crete is said to have lived\r\none hundred and fifty-seven years, the last fifty-seven of which he\r\nslept in a cavern at night. Gorgias, a teacher, lived to one hundred\r\nand eight; Democritus, a naturalist, attained one hundred and nine;\r\nZeno, the founder of the Stoics, lived to one hundred; and Diogenes,\r\nthe frugal and slovenly, reached ninety years. Despite his life of\r\nexposure, Hippocrates lived to one hundred and nine; and Galen, the\r\nprince of physicians after him, who was naturally of a feeble\r\nconstitution, lived past eighty, and few of the followers of his system\r\nof medicine, which stood for thirteen centuries, surpassed him in point\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, Orbilis, Corvinus, Fabius, and Cato, the enemy of the\r\nphysicians, approximated the century mark.\r\n\r\nA valuable collection relative to the duration of life in the time of\r\nthe Emperor Vespasian has been preserved for us by Pliny from the\r\nrecords of a census, a perfectly reliable and creditable source. In 76\r\nA. D. there were living in that part of Italy which lies between the\r\nApennines and the Po 124 persons who had attained the age of one\r\nhundred and upward. There were 54 of one hundred; 57 of one hundred and\r\nten; 2 of one hundred and twenty-five; 4 of one hundred and thirty; 4\r\nof from one hundred and thirty-five to one hundred and thirty-seven,\r\nand 3 of one hundred and forty. In Placentia there was a man of one\r\nhundred and thirty and at Faventia a woman of one hundred and\r\nthirty-two.  According to Hufeland, the bills of mortality of Ulpian\r\nagree in the most striking manner with those of our great modern cities.\r\n\r\nAmong hermits and ecclesiastics, as would be the natural inference from\r\ntheir regular lives, many instances of longevity are recorded. John was\r\nsupposed to be ninety-three; Paul the hermit was one hundred and\r\nthirteen; Saint Anthony lived to one hundred and five; James the hermit\r\nto one hundred and four; Saint Epithanius lived to one hundred and\r\nfifteen; Simeon Stylites to one hundred and twelve; Saint Mungo was\r\naccredited with one hundred and eighty-five years (Spottiswood), and\r\nSaint David attained one hundred and forty-six. Saint Polycarpe\r\nsuffered martyrdom at over one hundred, and Simon Cleophas was Bishop\r\nof Jerusalem at one hundred and twenty.\r\n\r\nBrahmin priests of India are known to attain incredible age, and one of\r\nthe secrets of the adepts of the Buddhist faith is doubtless the\r\nknowledge of the best means of attaining very old age. Unless cut off\r\nby violence or accident the priests invariably become venerable\r\npatriarchs.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Mental Culture.--Men of thought have at all times been\r\ndistinguished for their age. Among the venerable sages are Appolonius\r\nof Tyana, a follower of Pythagoras, who lived to over one hundred;\r\nXenophilus, also a Pythagorean, was one hundred and six; Demonax, a\r\nStoic, lived past one hundred; Isocrates was ninety-eight, and Solon,\r\nSophocles, Pindar, Anacreon, and Xenophon were octogenarians.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times we find men of science and literature who have\r\nattained advanced age. Kant, Buffon, Goethe, Fontenelle, and Newton\r\nwere all over eighty. Michael Angelo and Titian lived to eighty-nine\r\nand ninety-nine respectively. Harvey, the discoverer of the\r\ncirculation; Hans Sloane, the celebrated president of the Royal Society\r\nin London; Plater, the Swiss physician; Duverney, the anatomist, as\r\nwell as his confrere, Tenon, lived to be octogenarians. Many men have\r\ndisplayed activity when past four score. Brougham at eighty-two and\r\nLyndhurst at eighty-eight could pour forth words of eloquence and\r\nsagacity for hours at a time.  Landor wrote his \"Imaginary\r\nConversations\" when eighty-five, and Somerville his \"Molecular Science\"\r\nat eighty-eight; Isaac Walton was active with his pen at ninety;\r\nHahnemann married at eighty and was working at ninety-one.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Bailey has published a biography of \"Modern Methusalehs,\" which\r\nincludes histories of the lives of Cornaro, Titian, Pletho, Herschell,\r\nMontefiore, Routh, and others. Chevreul, the centenarian chemist, has\r\nonly lately died. Gladstone, Bismarck, and von Moltke exemplify vigor\r\nin age In the Senate of the United States, Senators Edmunds, Sherman,\r\nHoar, Morrill, and other elderly statesmen display as much vigor as\r\ntheir youthful colleagues. Instances of vigor in age could be cited in\r\nevery profession and these few examples are only mentioned as typical.\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Society of English Naturalists, Lord Kelvin\r\nannounced that during the last year 26 members had died at an average\r\nage of seventy-six and a half years; one reached the age of ninety-nine\r\nyears, another ninety-seven, a third ninety-five, etc.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on the perfect compatibility of activity with longevity,\r\nthe National Popular Review says:--\r\n\r\n\"Great men usually carry their full mental vigor and activity into old\r\nage. M. Chevreul, M. De Lesseps, Gladstone, and Bismarck are evidences\r\nof this anthropologic fact. Pius IX, although living in tempestuous\r\ntimes, reached a great age in full possession of all his faculties, and\r\nthe dramatist Crebillon composed his last dramatic piece at\r\nninety-four, while Michael Angelo was still painting his great canvases\r\nat ninety-eight, and Titian at ninety still worked with all the vigor\r\nof his earlier years. The Austrian General Melas was still in the\r\nsaddle and active at eighty-nine, and would have probably won Marengo\r\nbut for the inopportune arrival of Desaix. The Venetian Doge Henry\r\nDandolo, born at the beginning of the eleventh century, who lost his\r\neyesight when a young man, was nevertheless subsequently raised to the\r\nhighest office in the republic, managed successfully to conduct various\r\nwars, and at the advanced age of eighty-three, in alliance with the\r\nFrench, besieged and captured Constantinople. Fontenelle was as\r\ngay-spirited at ninety-eight as in his fortieth year, and the\r\nphilosopher Newton worked away at his tasks at the age of eighty-three\r\nwith the same ardor that animated his middle age. Cornaro was as happy\r\nat ninety as at fifty, and in far better health at the age of\r\nninety-five than he had enjoyed at thirty.\r\n\r\n\"These cases all tend to show the value and benefits to be derived from\r\nan actively cultivated brain in making a long life one of comfort and\r\nof usefulness to its owner. The brain and spirits need never grow old,\r\neven if our bodies will insist on getting rickety and in falling by the\r\nwayside. But an abstemious life will drag even the old body along to\r\ncentenarian limits in a tolerable state of preservation and usefulness.\r\nThe foregoing list can be lengthened out with an indefinite number of\r\nnames, but it is sufficiently long to show what good spirits and an\r\nactive brain will do to lighten up the weight of old age. When we\r\ncontemplate the Doge Dandolo at eighty-three animating his troops from\r\nthe deck of his galley, and the brave old blind King of Bohemia falling\r\nin the thickest of the fray at Crecy, it would seem as it there was no\r\nexcuse for either physical, mental, or moral decrepitude short of the\r\nage of four score and ten.\"\r\n\r\nEmperors and Kings, in short, the great ones of the earth, pay the\r\npenalty of their power by associate worriment and care. In ancient\r\nhistory we can only find a few rulers who attained four score, and this\r\nis equally the case in modern times. In the whole catalogue of the\r\nRoman and German Emperors, reckoning from Augustus to William I, only\r\nsix have attained eighty years.  Gordian, Valerian, Anastasius, and\r\nJustinian were octogenarians, Tiberius was eighty-eight at his death,\r\nand Augustus Caesar was eighty-six. Frederick the Great, in spite of\r\nhis turbulent life, attained a rare age for a king, seventy-six.\r\nWilliam I seems to be the only other exception.\r\n\r\nOf 300 Popes who may be counted, no more than five attained the age of\r\neighty. Their mode of life, though conducive to longevity in the minor\r\noffices of the Church, seems to be overbalanced by the cares of the\r\nPontificate.\r\n\r\nPersonal Habits.--According to Hufeland and other authorities on\r\nlongevity, sobriety, regular habits, labor in the open air, exercise\r\nshort of fatigue, calmness of mind, moderate intellectual power, and a\r\nfamily life are among the chief aids to longevity. For this reason we\r\nfind the extraordinary instances of longevity among those people who\r\namidst bodily labor and in the open air lead a simple life, agreeable\r\nto nature. Such are farmers, gardeners, hunters, soldiers, and sailors.\r\nIn these situations man may still maintain the age of one hundred and\r\nfifty or even one hundred and sixty.\r\n\r\nPossibly the most celebrated case of longevity on record is that of\r\nHenry Jenkins. This remarkable old man was born in Yorkshire in 1501\r\nand died in 1670, aged one hundred and sixty-nine. He remembered the\r\nbattle of Flodden Field in 1513, at which time he was twelve years old.\r\nIt was proved from the registers of the Chancery and other courts that\r\nhe had appeared in evidence one hundred and forty years before his\r\ndeath and had had an oath administered to him. In the office of the\r\nKing's Remembrancer is a record of a deposition in which he appears as\r\na witness at one hundred and fifty-seven. When above one hundred he was\r\nable to swim a rapid stream.\r\n\r\nThomas Parr (or Parre), among Englishmen known as \"old Parr,\" was a\r\npoor farmer's servant, born in 1483. He remained single until eighty.\r\nHis first wife lived thirty-two years, and eight years after her death,\r\nat the age of one hundred and twenty, he married again. Until his one\r\nhundred and thirtieth year he performed his ordinary duties, and at\r\nthis age was even accustomed to thresh.  He was visited by Thomas, Earl\r\nof Arundel and Surrey, and was persuaded to visit the King in London.\r\nHis intelligence and venerable demeanor impressed every one, and crowds\r\nthronged to see him and pay him homage. The journey to London, together\r\nwith the excitement and change of mode of living, undoubtedly hastened\r\nhis death, which occurred in less than a year. He was one hundred and\r\nfifty-two years and nine months old, and had lived under nine Kings of\r\nEngland. Harvey examined his body and at the necropsy his internal\r\norgans were found in a most perfect state. His cartilages were not even\r\nossified, as is the case generally with the very aged. The slightest\r\ncause of death could not be discovered, and the general impression was\r\nthat he died from being over-fed and too-well treated in London. His\r\ngreat-grandson was said to have died in this century in Cork at the age\r\nof one hundred and three. Parr is celebrated by a monument reared to\r\nhis memory in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe author of the Dutch dictionary entitled \"Het algemen historish\r\nVanderbok\" says that there was a peasant in Hungary named Jean Korin\r\nwho was one hundred and seventy-two and his wife was one hundred and\r\nsixty-four; they had lived together one hundred and forty-eight years,\r\nand had a son at the time of their death who was one hundred and\r\nsixteen.\r\n\r\nSetrasch Czarten, or, as he is called by Baily, Petratsh Zartan, was\r\nalso born in Hungary at a village four miles from Teneswaer in 1537. He\r\nlived for one hundred and eighty years in one village and died at the\r\nage of one hundred and eighty-seven, or, as another authority has it,\r\none hundred and eighty-five. A few days before his death he had walked\r\na mile to wait at the post-office for the arrival of travelers and to\r\nask for succor, which, on account of his remarkable age, was rarely\r\nrefused him. He had lost nearly all his teeth and his beard and hair\r\nwere white. He was accustomed to eat a little cake the Hungarians call\r\nkalatschen, with which he drank milk. After each repast he took a glass\r\nof eau-de-vie. His son was living at ninety-seven and his descendants\r\nto the fifth generation embellished his old age.  Shortly before his\r\ndeath Count Wallis had his portrait painted.  Comparing his age with\r\nthat of others, we find that he was five years older than the Patriarch\r\nIsaac, ten more than Abraham, thirty-seven more than Nahor, sixteen\r\nmore than Henry Jenkins, and thirty-three more than \"old Parr.\"\r\n\r\nSundry Instances of Great Age.--In a churchyard near Cardiff,\r\nGlamorganshire, is the following inscription: \"Here lieth the body of\r\nWilliam Edwards, of Cacreg, who departed this life 24th February, Anno\r\nDomini 1668, anno aetatis suae one hundred and sixty-eight.\"\r\n\r\nJonas Warren of Balydole died in 1787 aged one hundred and sixty-seven.\r\nHe was called the \"father of the fishermen\" in his vicinity, as he had\r\nfollowed the trade for ninety-five years.\r\n\r\nThe Journal de Madrid, 1775, contains the account of a South American\r\nnegress living in Spanish possessions who was one hundred and\r\nseventy-four years of age. The description is written by a witness, who\r\ndeclares that she told of events which confirmed her age. This is\r\npossibly the oft-quoted case that was described in the London\r\nChronicle, October 5, 1780, Louisa Truxo, who died in South America at\r\nthe age of one hundred and seventy-five.\r\n\r\nHuteland speaks of Joseph Surrington, who died near Bergen, Norway, at\r\nthe age of one hundred and sixty. Marvelous to relate, he had one\r\nliving son of one hundred and three and another of nine. There has been\r\nrecently reported from Vera Cruz, Mexico, in the town of Teluca, where\r\nthe registers are carefully and efficiently kept, the death of a man\r\none hundred and ninety-two years old--almost a modern version of\r\nMethuselah. Buffon describes a man who lived to be one hundred and\r\nsixty-five.  Martin mentions a man of one hundred and eighty. There was\r\na Polish peasant who reached one hundred and fifty-seven and had\r\nconstantly labored up to his one hundred and forty-fifth year, always\r\nclad lightly, even in cold weather. Voigt admits the extreme age of one\r\nhundred and sixty.\r\n\r\nThere was a woman living in Moscow in 1848 who was said to be one\r\nhundred and sixty-eight; she had been married five times and was one\r\nhundred and twenty-one at her last wedding. D'Azara records the age of\r\none hundred and eighty, and Roequefort speaks of two cases at one\r\nhundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nThere are stories of an Englishman who lived in the sixteenth century\r\nto be two hundred and seven, and there is a parallel case cited.\r\n\r\nVan Owen tabulates 331 cases of deaths between 110 and 120, 91 between\r\n120 and 130, 37 between 130 and 140, 11 at 150, and 17 beyond this age.\r\nWhile not vouching for the authenticity in each case, he has always\r\ngiven the sources of information.\r\n\r\nQuite celebrated in English history by Raleigh and Bacon was the\r\nvenerable Countess Desmond, who appeared at Court in 1614, being one\r\nhundred and forty years old and in full possession of all her powers,\r\nmental and physical. There are several portraits of her at this\r\nadvanced age still to be seen. Lord Bacon also mentions a man named\r\nMarcus Appenius, living in Rimini, who was registered by a Vespasian\r\ntax-collector as being one hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nThere are records of Russians who have lived to one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five, one hundred and thirty, one hundred and thirty-five, one\r\nhundred and forty-five, and one hundred and fifty. Nemnich speaks of\r\nThomas Newman living in Bridlington at one hundred and fifty-three\r\nyears. Nemnich is confirmed in his account of Thomas Newman by his\r\ntombstone in Yorkshire, dated 1542.\r\n\r\nIn the chancel of the Honington Church, Wiltshire, is a black marble\r\nmonument to the memory of G. Stanley, gent., who died in 1719, aged one\r\nhundred and fifty-one.\r\n\r\nThere was a Dane named Draakenburg, born in 1623, who until his\r\nninety-first year served as a seaman in the royal navy, and had spent\r\nfifteen years of his life in Turkey as a slave in the greatest misery.\r\nHe was married at one hundred and ten to a woman of sixty, but outlived\r\nher a long time, in his one hundred and thirtieth year he again fell in\r\nlove with a young country girl, who, as may well be supposed, rejected\r\nhim. He died in 1772 in his one hundred and forty-sixth year. Jean\r\nEffingham died in Cornwall in 1757 in his one hundred and forty-fourth\r\nyear. He was born in the reign of James I and was a soldier at the\r\nbattle of Hochstadt; he never drank strong liquors and rarely ate meat;\r\neight days before his death he walked three miles.\r\n\r\nBridget Devine, the well-known inhabitant of Olean Street, Manchester\r\ndied at the age of one hundred and forty-seven in 1845. On the register\r\nof the Cheshire Parish is a record of the death of Thomas Hough of\r\nFrodsam in 1591 at the age of one hundred and forty-one.\r\n\r\nPeter Garden of Auchterless died in 1775 at the age of one hundred and\r\nthirty-one. He had seen and talked with Henry Jenkins about the battle\r\nof Flodden Field, at which the latter was present when a boy of twelve.\r\nIt seems almost incredible that a man could say that he had heard the\r\nstory of an event which had happened two hundred and sixty-three years\r\nbefore related by the lips of an eye-witness to that event;\r\nnevertheless, in this case it was true. A remarkable instance of\r\nlongevity in one family has recently been published in the St. Thomas's\r\nHospital Gazette.  Mrs. B., born in 1630 (five years after the\r\naccession of Charles I), died March 13, 1732. She was tended in her\r\nlast illness by her great-granddaughter, Miss Jane C., born 1718, died\r\n1807, and Miss Sarah C., born 1725, died 1811. A great-niece of one of\r\nthese two ladies, Mrs. W., who remembers one of them, was born in 1803,\r\nand is at the present time alive and well. It will be seen from the\r\nabove facts that there are three lives only to bridge over the long\r\nperiod between 1630 and 1896, and that there is at present living a\r\nlady who personally knew Miss C., who had nursed a relative born in\r\n1630. The last lady of this remarkable trio is hale and hearty, and has\r\njust successfully undergone an operation for cataract. Similar to the\r\ncase of the centenarian who had seen Henry Jenkins was that of James\r\nHorrocks, who was born in 1744 and died in 1844. His father was born in\r\n1657, one year before the death of the Protector, and had issue in\r\nearly life. He married again at eighty-four to a woman of twenty-six,\r\nof which marriage James was the offspring in 1744. In 1844 this man\r\ncould with verity say that he had a brother born during the reign of\r\nCharles II, and that his father was a citizen of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAmong the Mission Indians of Southern California there are reported\r\ninstances of longevity ranging from one hundred and twenty to one\r\nhundred and forty. Lieutenant Gibbons found in a village in Peru one\r\nhundred inhabitants who were past the century mark, and another\r\ncredible explorer in the same territory records a case of longevity of\r\none hundred and forty. This man was very temperate and always ate his\r\nfood cold, partaking of meat only in the middle of the day. In the year\r\nof 1840 in the town of Banos, Ecuador, died \"Old Morales,\" a carpenter,\r\nvigorous to his last days. He was an elderly man and steward of the\r\nJesuits when they were expelled from their property near this location\r\nin 1767. In the year 1838 there was a witness in a judicial trial in\r\nSouth America who was born on the night of the great earthquake which\r\ndestroyed the town of Ambato in 1698. How much longer this man who was\r\ncradled by an earthquake lived is not as yet reported. In the State of\r\nVera Cruz, Mexico, as late as 1893 a man died at the age of one hundred\r\nand thirty-seven. The census of 1864 for the town of Pilaguin, Ecuador,\r\nlying 11,000 feet above the level of the sea and consisting of about\r\n2000 inhabitants, gives 100 above seventy, 30 above ninety, five above\r\none hundred, and one at one hundred and fifteen years.\r\n\r\nFrancis Auge died in Maryland in 1767 at the age of one hundred and\r\nthirty-four. He remembered the execution of Charles I and had a son\r\nborn to him after he was one hundred.\r\n\r\nThere are several other instances in which men have displayed\r\ngenerative ability in old age. John Gilley, who died in Augusta, Maine,\r\nin 1813, was born in Ireland in 1690. He came to this country at the\r\nage of sixty, and continued in single blessedness until seventy-five,\r\nwhen he married a girl of eighteen, by whom he had eight children. His\r\nwife survived him and stated that he was virile until his one hundred\r\nand twentieth year. Baron Baravicino de Capelis died at Meran in 1770\r\nat the age of one hundred and four, being the oldest man in Tyrol. His\r\nusual food was eggs, and he rarely tasted meat. He habitually drank tea\r\nand a well-sweetened cordial of his own recipe. He was married four\r\ntimes during his life, taking his fourth wife when he was eighty-four.\r\nBy her he had seven children and at his death she was pregnant with the\r\neighth child.\r\n\r\nPliny mentions cases of men begetting sons when past the age of eighty\r\nand Plot speaks of John Best of the parish of Horton, who when one\r\nhundred and four married a woman of fifty-six and begat a son. There\r\nare also records of a man in Stockholm of one hundred who had several\r\nchildren by a wife of thirty.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, 1776, Mary, the wife of Joseph Yates, at Lizard Common not\r\nfar from London, was buried at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven.\r\nShe had walked to London in 1666, and was hearty and strong at one\r\nhundred and twenty, and had married a third husband at ninety-two.\r\n\r\nA case without parallel, of long survival of a deaf mute, is found in\r\nMrs. Gray of Northfleet, Kent, who died in 1770, one hundred and\r\ntwenty-one years old. She was noted for her cheerful disposition, and\r\napparently enjoyed life in spite of her infirmity, which lasted one\r\nhundred and twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nMacklin the actor was born in 1697 and died in 1797. Several years\r\nbefore his death he played \"Shylock,\" displaying great vigor in the\r\nfirst act, but in the second his memory failed him, and with much grace\r\nand solemnity he advanced to the foot-lights and apologized for his\r\ninability to continue. It is worthy of remark that several instances of\r\nlongevity in Roman actresses have been recorded. One Luceja, who came\r\non the stage very young, performed a whole century, and even made her\r\npublic appearance in her one hundred and twelfth year. Copiola was said\r\nto have danced before Augustus when past ninety.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Stimulants, etc.--There have been men who have attributed\r\ntheir long lives to their excesses in stimulants.  Thomas Wishart of\r\nAnnandale, Dumfries, died in 1760 at one hundred and twenty-four. He\r\nhad chewed tobacco one hundred and seventeen years, contracting the\r\nhabit when a child; his father gave it to him to allay hunger while\r\nshepherding in the mountains. John de la Somet of Virginia died in 1766\r\naged one hundred and thirty. He was a great smoker, and according to\r\nEaton the habit agreed with his constitution, and was not improbably\r\nthe cause of his long health and longevity. William Riddell, who died\r\nat one hundred and sixteen carefully avoided water all his life and had\r\na love for brandy.\r\n\r\nPossession of Faculties.--Eglebert Hoff was a lad driving a team in\r\nNorway when the news was brought that Charles I was beheaded.  He died\r\nin Fishkill, N.Y., in 1764 at the age of one hundred and twenty-eight.\r\nHe never used spectacles, read fluently, and his memory and senses were\r\nretained until his death, which was due to an accident. Nicolas\r\nPetours, curate of the parish of Baleene and afterward canon of the\r\nCathedral of Constance, died at the age of one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven; he was always a healthy, vigorous man, and celebrated\r\nmass five days before his death. Mr. Evans of Spital Street,\r\nSpitalfields, London, died in 1780 aged one hundred and thirty-nine,\r\nhaving full possession of his mental faculties. Of interest to\r\nAmericans is the case of David Kinnison, who, when one hundred and\r\neleven, related to Lossing the historian the tale of the Boston Tea\r\nParty, of which he had been a member. He died in good mental condition\r\nat the age of one hundred and fifteen. Anthony Senish, a farmer of the\r\nvillage of Limoges, died in 1770 in his one hundred and eleventh year.\r\nHe labored until two weeks before his death, had still his hair, and\r\nhis sight had not failed him. His usual food was chestnuts and Turkish\r\ncorn; he had never been bled or used any medicine. Not very long ago\r\nthere was alive in Tacony, near Philadelphia, a shoemaker named R. Glen\r\nin his one hundred and fourteenth year.  He had seen King William III,\r\nand all his faculties were perfectly retained; he enjoyed good health,\r\nwalking weekly to Philadelphia to church. His third wife was but thirty\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nLongevity in Ireland.--Lord Bacon said that at one time there was not a\r\nvillage in all Ireland in which there was not a man living upward of\r\neighty. In Dunsford, a small village, there were living at one time 80\r\npersons above the age of four score. Colonel Thomas Winslow was\r\nsupposed to have died in Ireland on August 26, 1766, aged one hundred\r\nand forty-six. There was a man by the name of Butler who died at\r\nKilkenny in 1769 aged one hundred and thirty-three. He rode after the\r\nhounds while yet a centenarian.  Mrs. Eckelston, a widow in\r\nPhillipstown, Kings County, Ireland, died in 1690 at one hundred and\r\nforty-three.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of instances in which there is extraordinary\r\nrenovation of the senses or even of the body in old age,--a new period\r\nof life, as it were, is begun. A remarkable instance is an old\r\nmagistrate known to Hufeland, who lived at Rechingen and who died in\r\n1791 aged one hundred and twenty. In 1787, long after he had lost all\r\nhis teeth, eight new ones appeared, and at the end of six months they\r\nagain dropped out, but their place was supplied by other new ones, and\r\nNature, unwearied, continued this process until his death. All these\r\nteeth he had acquired and lost without pain, the whole number amounting\r\nto 150. Alice, a slave born in Philadelphia, and living in 1802 at the\r\nage of one hundred and sixteen, remembered William Penn and Thomas\r\nStory.  Her faculties were well preserved, but she partially lost her\r\neyesight at ninety-six, which, strange to say, returned in part at one\r\nhundred and two. There was a woman by the name of Helen Gray who died\r\nin her one hundred and fifth year, and who but a few years before her\r\ndeath had acquired a new set of teeth.\r\n\r\nIn Wilson's \"Healthy Skin\" are mentioned several instances of very old\r\npersons in whom the natural color of the hair returned after they had\r\nbeen gray for years. One of them was John Weeks, whose hair became\r\nbrown again at one hundred and fourteen. Sir John Sinclair a mentions a\r\nsimilar case in a Scotchman who lived to one hundred and ten. Susan\r\nEdmonds when in her ninety-fifth year recovered her black hair, but\r\npreviously to her death at one hundred and five again became gray.\r\nThere was a Dr. Slave who at the age of eighty had a renewal of rich\r\nbrown hair, which he maintained until his death at one hundred. There\r\nwas a man in Vienna, aged one hundred and five, who had black hair long\r\nafter his hair had first become white This man is mentioned as a\r\nparallel to Dr. Slave. Similar examples are mentioned in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that many persons who have reached an old age\r\nhave lived on the smallest diet and the most frugal fare.  Many of the\r\ninstances of longevity were in people of Scotch origin who subsisted\r\nall their lives on porridges. Saint Anthony is said to have maintained\r\nlife to one hundred and five on twelve ounces of bread daily. In 1792\r\nin the Duchy of Holstein there was an industrious laborer named Stender\r\nwho died at one hundred and three, his food for the most part of his\r\nlife having been oatmeal and buttermilk. Throughout his life he had\r\nbeen particularly free from thirst, drinking little water and no\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nHeredity.--There are some very interesting instances of successive\r\nlongevity. Lister speaks of a son and a father, from a village called\r\nDent, who were witnesses before a jury at York in 1664. The son was\r\nabove one hundred and the father above one hundred and forty. John\r\nMoore died in 1805 aged one hundred and seven. His father died at one\r\nhundred and five and his grandfather at one hundred and fifteen, making\r\na total of three hundred and twenty-seven years for the three\r\ngenerations.  Recently, Wynter mentions four sisters,--of one hundred,\r\none hundred and three, one hundred and five, and one hundred and seven\r\nyears respectively. On the register of Bremhill 1696, is the following\r\nremarkable entry: \"Buried, September 29th, Edith Goldie, Grace Young,\r\nand Elizabeth Wiltshire, their united ages making three hundred.\" As\r\nlate as 1886 in the district of Campinos there was a strong active man\r\nnamed Joseph Joachim de Prado, of good family, who was one hundred and\r\nseven years old.  His mother died by accident at one hundred and\r\ntwelve, and his maternal grandmother died at one hundred and twenty-two.\r\n\r\nLongevity in Active Military Service.--One of the most remarkable\r\nproofs that under fickle fortune, constant danger, and the most\r\ndestructive influences the life of man may be long preserved is\r\nexemplified in the case of an old soldier named Mittelstedt, who died\r\nin Prussia in 1792, aged one hundred and twelve. He was born at Fissalm\r\nin June, 1681. He entered the army, served under three Kings, Frederick\r\nI, Frederick William I, and Frederick II, and did active service in the\r\nSeven Years' War, in which his horse was shot under him and he was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Russians. In his sixty-eight years of army\r\nservice he participated in 17 general engagements, braved numerous\r\ndangers, and was wounded many times. After his turbulent life he\r\nmarried, and at last in 1790, in his one hundred and tenth year, he\r\ntook a third wife.  Until shortly before his death he walked every\r\nmonth to the pension office, a distance of two miles from his house.\r\n\r\nLongevity in Physicians.--It may be of interest to the members of our\r\nprofession to learn of some instances of longevity among confreres. Dr.\r\nR. Baynes of Rockland, Maine, has been mentioned in the list of \"grand\r\nold men\" in medicine; following in the footsteps of Hippocrates and\r\nGalen, he was practicing at ninety-nine. He lives on Graham's diet,\r\nwhich is a form of vegetarianism; he does not eat potatoes, but does\r\neat fruit. His drink is almost entirely water, milk, and chocolate, and\r\nhe condemns the use of tea, coffee, liquors, and tobacco. He has almost\r\na perfect set of natural teeth and his sight is excellent.  Like most\r\nmen who live to a great age, Dr. Baynes has a \"fad,\" to which he\r\nattributes a chief part in prolonging his life. This is the avoidance\r\nof beds, and except when away from home he has not slept on a bed or\r\neven on a mattress for over fifty years. He has an iron reclining\r\nchair, over which he spreads a few blankets and rugs.\r\n\r\nThe British Medical Journal speaks of Dr. Boisy of Havre, who is one\r\nhundred and three. It is said he goes his rounds every day, his\r\npractice being chiefly among the poor. At one time he practiced in\r\nIndia. He has taken alcoholic beverages and smoked tobacco since his\r\nyouth, although in moderation. His father, it is added, died at the age\r\nof one hundred and eight. Mr. William R. Salmon, living near Cowbridge,\r\nGlamorganshire, recently celebrated his one hundred and sixth birthday.\r\nMr. Salmon was born at Wickham Market in 1790, and became a member of\r\nthe Royal College of Surgeons in 1809, the year in which Gladstone was\r\nborn. He died April 11, 1896. In reference to this wonderful old\r\nphysician the Journal of the American Medical Association, 1896, page\r\n995, says--\r\n\r\n\"William Reynold Salmon, M.R.C.S., of Penllyn Court, Cowbridge,\r\nGlamorganshire, South Wales, completed his one hundred and sixth year\r\non March 16th, and died on the 11th of the present month--at the time\r\nof his death the oldest known individual of indisputably authenticated\r\nage, the oldest physician, the oldest member of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons, England, and the oldest Freemason in the world. His age does\r\nnot rest upon tradition or repute. He was the son of a successful and\r\nesteemed practicing physician of Market Wickham, Suffolk, England, and\r\nthere is in the possession of his two surviving relatives, who cared\r\nfor his household for many years, his mother's diary, in which is\r\ninscribed in the handwriting of a lady of the eighteenth century, under\r\nthe date, Tuesday, March 16, 1790, a prayer of thankfulness to God that\r\nshe had passed her 'tryall,' and that a son was born, who she hoped\r\n'would prosper, be a support to his parents, and make virtue his chief\r\npursuit.' The Royal College of Surgeons verified this record many years\r\nago, and it was subsequently again authenticated by the authorities of\r\nthe Freemasons, who thereupon enshrined his portrait in their gallery\r\nas the oldest living Freemason. The Salmon family moved to Cowbridge in\r\n1796, so that the doctor had lived exactly a century in the lovely and\r\npoetic Vale of Glamorgan, in the very heart of which Penllyn Court is\r\nsituated. Here on his one hundred and sixth birthday--a man of over\r\nmiddle height, with still long, flowing hair, Druidical beard and\r\nmustache, and bushy eyebrows--Dr. Salmon was visited by one who\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n\"'Seen a few days ago, the Patriarch of Penllyn Court was hale and\r\nhearty. He eats well and sleeps well and was feeling better than he had\r\nfelt for the last five years. On that day he rose at noon, dined at\r\nsix, and retired at nine. Drank two glasses of port with his dinner,\r\nbut did not smoke. He abandoned his favorite weed at the age of ninety,\r\nand had to discontinue his drives over his beautiful estate in his one\r\nhundredth year. One day is much the same as another, for he gives his\r\ntwo relatives little trouble in attending upon his wants. Dr. Salmon\r\nhas not discovered the elixir of life, for the shadows of life's\r\nevening are stealing slowly over him. He cannot move about, his hearing\r\nis dulled, and the light is almost shut out from the \"windows of his\r\nsoul.\" Let us think of this remarkable man waiting for death\r\nuncomplainingly in his old-fashioned mansion, surrounded by the\r\nbeautiful foliage and the broad expanse of green fields that he loved\r\nso much to roam when a younger man, in that sylvan Sleepy Hollow in the\r\nVale of Glamorgan.'\r\n\r\n\"Eight weeks later he, who in youth had been 'the youngest surgeon in\r\nthe army, died, the oldest physician in the world.\"\r\n\r\nDr. William Hotchkiss, said to have reached the age of one hundred and\r\nforty years, died in St. Louis April 1, 1895. He went to St. Louis\r\nforty years ago, and has always been known as the \"color doctor.\" In\r\nhis peculiar practice of medicine he termed his patients members of his\r\n\"circles,\" and claimed to treat them by a magnetic process. Dr. A. J.\r\nBuck says that his Masonic record has been traced back one hundred\r\nyears, showing conclusively that he was one hundred and twenty-one\r\nyears old. A letter received from his old home in Virginia, over a year\r\nago, says that he was born there in 1755.\r\n\r\nIt is comforting to the members of our profession, in which the average\r\nof life is usually so low, to be able to point out exceptions. It has\r\nbeen aptly said of physicians in general: \"Aliis inserviendo\r\nconsumuntur; aliis medendo moriuntur,\" or \"In serving others they are\r\nconsumed; in healing others they are destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nRecent Instances of Longevity.--There was a man who died in Spain at\r\nthe advanced age of one hundred and fifty-one, which is the most\r\nextraordinary instance from that country. It is reported that quite\r\nrecently a Chinese centenarian passed the examination for the highest\r\nplace in the Academy of Mandarins. Chevreul, born in 1786, at Angers,\r\nhas only recently died after an active life in chemical investigation.\r\nSir Moses Montefiore is a recent example of an active centenarian.\r\n\r\nIn the New York Herald of April 21, 1895, is a description and a\r\nportrait of Noah Raby of the Piscataway Poor Farm of New Jersey, to\r\nwhom was ascribed one hundred and twenty-three years. He was discharged\r\nfrom active duty on the \"Brandywine,\" U.S.N., eighty-three years ago.\r\nHe relates having heard George Washington speak at Washington and at\r\nPortsmouth while his ship was in those places. The same journal also\r\nsays that at Wichita, Kansas, there appeared at a municipal election an\r\nold negress named Mrs. Harriet McMurray, who gave her age as one\r\nhundred and fifteen.  She had been a slave, and asserted that once on a\r\nvisit to Alexandria with her master she had seen General Washington.\r\nFrom the Indian Medical Record we learn that Lieutenant Nicholas Lavin\r\nof the Grand Armee died several years ago at the age of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five, leaving a daughter of seventy-eight. He was born in Paris\r\nin 1768, served as a hussar in several campaigns, and was taken a\r\nprisoner during the retreat from Moscow. After his liberation he\r\nmarried and made his residence in Saratoff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGIC AND FUNCTIONAL ANOMALIES.\r\n\r\nIn considering the anomalies of the secretions, it must be remembered\r\nthat the ingestion of certain kinds of food and the administration of\r\npeculiar drugs in medicine have a marked influence in coloring\r\nsecretions. Probably the most interesting of all these anomalies is the\r\nclass in which, by a compensatory process, metastasis of the secretions\r\nis noticed.\r\n\r\nColored Saliva.--Among the older writers the Ephemerides contains an\r\naccount of blue saliva; Huxham speaks of green saliva; Marcellus\r\nDonatus of yellow, and Peterman relates the history of a case of yellow\r\nsaliva. Dickinson describes a woman of sixty whose saliva was blue;\r\nbesides this nothing was definitely the matter with her. It seemed\r\nhowever, that the color was due to some chemic-pencil poisoning rather\r\nthan to a pathologic process.  A piece of this aniline pencil was\r\ncaught in the false teeth.  Paget cites an instance of blue saliva due\r\nto staining the tongue in the same manner. Most cases of anomalous\r\ncoloring of this kind can be subsequently traced to artificial\r\nsubstances unconsciously introduced. Crocker mentions a woman who on\r\nwashing her hands constantly found that the water was stained blue, but\r\nthis was subsequently traced to the accidental introduction of an\r\norchid leaf. In another instance there was a woman whose linen was at\r\nevery change stained brown; this, however, was found to be due to a\r\nhair-wash that she was in the habit of using.\r\n\r\nAmong the older writers who have mentioned abnormal modes of exit of\r\nthe urine is Baux, who mentions urine from the nipples; Paullini and\r\nthe Ephemerides describe instances of urination from the eyes.\r\nBlancard, the Ephemerides, Sorbalt, and Vallisneri speak of urination\r\nby the mouth. Arnold relates the history of a case of dysuria in which\r\nurine was discharged from the nose, breasts, ears, and umbilicus; the\r\nwoman was twenty-seven years old, and the dysuria was caused by a\r\nprolapsed uterus. There was an instance of anomalous discharge of urine\r\nfrom the body reported in Philadelphia many years ago which led to\r\nanimated discussion. A case of dysuria in which the patient discharged\r\nurine from the stomach was reported early in this century from Germany.\r\nThe patient could feel the accumulation of urine by burning pain in the\r\nepigastrium. Suddenly the pain would move to the soles of the feet, she\r\nwould become nauseated, and large quantities of urine would soon be\r\nvomited. There was reported the case of an hysterical female who had\r\nconvulsions and mania, alternating with anuria of a peculiar nature and\r\nlasting seven days. There was not a drop of urine passed during this\r\ntime, but there were discharges through the mouth of alkaline waters\r\nwith a strong ammoniacal odor.\r\n\r\nSenter reports in a young woman a singular case of ischuria which\r\ncontinued for more than three years; during this time if her urine was\r\nnot drawn off with the catheter she frequently voided it by vomiting;\r\nfor the last twenty months she passed much gravel by the catheter; when\r\nthe use of the instrument was omitted or unsuccessfully applied the\r\nvomitus contained gravel. Carlisle mentions a case in which there was\r\nvomiting of a fluid containing urea and having the sensible properties\r\nof urine. Curious to relate, a cure was effected after ligature of the\r\nsuperior thyroid arteries and sloughing of the thyroid gland. Vomiting\r\nof urine is also mentioned by Coley, Domine, Liron, Malago, Zeviani,\r\nand Yeats. Marsden reports a case in which, following secondary papular\r\nsyphilis and profuse spontaneous ptyalism, there was vicarious\r\nsecretion of the urinary constituents from the skin.\r\n\r\nInstances of the anomalous exit of urine caused by congenital\r\nmalformation or fistulous connections are mentioned in another chapter.\r\nBlack urine is generally caused by the ingestion of pigmented food or\r\ndrugs, such as carbolic acid and the anilines.  Amatus Lusitanus,\r\nBartholinus, and the Ephemerides speak of black urine after eating\r\ngrapes or damson plums. The Ephemerides speaks of black urine being a\r\nprecursor of death, but Piso, Rhodius, and Schenck say it is anomalous\r\nand seldom a sign of death. White urine, commonly known as chyluria, is\r\nfrequently seen, and sometimes results from purulent cystitis. Though\r\ncontaining sediment, the urine looks as if full of milk. A case of this\r\nkind was seen in 1895 at the Jefferson Medical College Hospital,\r\nPhiladelphia, in which the chyluria was due to a communication between\r\nthe bladder and the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\nAckerman has spoken of metastasis of the tears, and Dixon gives an\r\ninstance in which crying was not attended by the visible shedding of\r\ntears. Salomon reports a case of congenital deficiency of tears.\r\nBlood-stained tears were frequently mentioned by the older writers.\r\nRecently Cross has written an article on this subject, and its analogy\r\nis seen in the next chapter under hemorrhages from the eyes through the\r\nlacrimal duct.\r\n\r\nThe Semen.--The older writers spoke of metastasis of the seminal flow,\r\nthe issue being by the skin (perspiration) and other routes. This was\r\nespecially supposed to be the case in satyriasis, in which the\r\npreternatural exit was due to superabundance of semen, which could be\r\nrecognized by its odor.  There is no doubt that some people have a\r\ndistinct seminal odor, a fact that will be considered in the section on\r\n\"Human Odors.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides, Schurig, and Hoffman report instances of what they\r\ncall fetid semen (possibly a complication of urethral disease). Paaw\r\nspeaks of black semen in a negro, and the Ephemerides and Schurig\r\nmention instances of dark semen. Blancard records an instance of\r\npreternatural exit of semen by the bowel.  Heers mentions a similar\r\ncase caused by urethral fistula. Ingham mentions the escape of semen\r\nthrough the testicle by means of a fistula. Demarquay is the authority\r\non bloody semen.\r\n\r\nAndouard mentions an instance of blue bile in a woman, blue flakes\r\nbeing found in her vomit. There was no trace of copper to be found in\r\nthis case. Andouard says that the older physicians frequently spoke of\r\nthis occurrence.\r\n\r\nRhodius speaks of the sweat being sweet after eating honey; the\r\nEphemerides and Paullini also mention it. Chromidrosis, or colored\r\nsweat, is an interesting anomaly exemplified in numerous reports. Black\r\nsweat has been mentioned by Bartholinus, who remarked that the\r\nsecretion resembled ink; in other cases Galeazzi and Zacutus Lusitanus\r\nsaid the perspiration resembled sooty water. Phosphorescent sweat has\r\nbeen recorded. Paullini and the Ephemerides mention perspiration which\r\nwas of a leek-green color, and Borellus has observed deep green\r\nperspiration. Marcard mentions green perspiration of the feet, possibly\r\ndue to stains from colored foot-gear. The Ephemerides and Paullini\r\nspeak of violet perspiration, and Bartholinus has described\r\nperspiration which in taste resembled wine.\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin Brodie has communicated the history of a case of a young\r\ngirl of fifteen on whose face was a black secretion. On attempting to\r\nremove it by washing, much pain was caused. The quantity removed by\r\nsoap and water at one time was sufficient to make four basins of water\r\nas black as if with India ink. It seemed to be physiologically\r\nanalogous to melanosis. The cessation of the secretion on the forehead\r\nwas followed by the ejection of a similar substance from the bowel,\r\nstomach, and kidney. The secretion was more abundant during the night,\r\nand at one time in its course an erysipelas-eruption made its\r\nappearance. A complete cure ultimately followed.\r\n\r\nPurdon describes an Irish married woman of forty, the subject of\r\nrheumatic fever, who occasionally had a blue serous discharge or\r\nperspiration that literally flowed from her legs and body, and\r\naccompanied by a miliary eruption. It was on the posterior portions,\r\nand twelve hours previous was usually preceded by a moldy smell and a\r\nprickly sensation. On the abdomen and the back of the neck there was a\r\nyellowish secretion. In place of catamenia there was a discharge\r\nreddish-green in color. The patient denied having taken any coloring\r\nmatter or chemicals to influence the color of her perspiration, and no\r\nremedy relieved her cardiac or rheumatic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe first English case of chromidrosis, or colored sweat, was published\r\nby Yonge of Plymouth in 1709. In this affection the colored sweating\r\nappears symmetrically in various parts of the body, the parts commonly\r\naffected being the cheeks, forehead, side of the nose, whole face,\r\nchest, abdomen, backs of the hands, finger-tips, and the flexors,\r\nflexures at the axillae, groins, and popliteal spaces. Although the\r\ncolor is generally black, nearly every color has been recorded. Colcott\r\nFox reported a genuine case, and Crocker speaks of a case at Shadwell\r\nin a woman of forty-seven of naturally dark complexion. The bowels were\r\nhabitually sluggish, going three or four days at least without action,\r\nand latterly the woman had suffered from articular pains.  The\r\ndiscolored sweat came out gradually, beginning at the sides of the\r\nface, then spreading to the cheeks and forehead. When seen, the upper\r\nhalf of the forehead, the temporal regions, and the skin between the\r\near and malar eminence were of a blackish-brown color, with slight\r\nhyperemia of the adjacent parts; the woman said the color had been\r\nalmost black, but she had cleaned her face some. There was evidently\r\nmuch fat in the secretion; there was also seborrhea of the scalp.\r\nWashing with soap and water had very little effect upon it; but it was\r\nremoved with ether, the skin still looking darker and redder than\r\nnormal.  After a week's treatment with saline purgatives the\r\ndiscoloration was much less, but the patient still had articular pains,\r\nfor which alkalies were prescribed; she did not again attend. Crocker\r\nalso quotes the case of a girl of twenty, originally under Mackay of\r\nBrighton. Her affection had lasted a year and was limited to the left\r\ncheek and eyebrow. Six months before the patch appeared she had a\r\nsuperficial burn which did not leave a distinct scar, but the surface\r\nwas slightly granular. The deposit was distinctly fatty, evidently\r\nseborrheic and of a sepia-tint. The girl suffered from obstinate\r\nconstipation, the bowels acting only once a week. The left side flushed\r\nmore than the right In connection with this case may be mentioned one\r\nby White of Harvard, a case of unilateral yellow chromidrosis in a man.\r\nDemons gives the history of a case of yellow sweat in a patient with\r\nthree intestinal calculi.\r\n\r\nWilson says that cases of green, yellow, and blue perspiration have\r\nbeen seen, and Hebra, Rayer, and Fuchs mention instances.  Conradi\r\nrecords a case of blue perspiration on one-half the scrotum. Chojnowski\r\nrecords a case in which the perspiration resembled milk.\r\n\r\nHyperidrosis occurs as a symptom in many nervous diseases, organic and\r\nfunctional, and its presence is often difficult of explanation. The\r\nfollowing are recent examples: Kustermann reports a case of acute\r\nmyelitis in which there was profuse perspiration above the level of the\r\ngirdle-sensation and none at all below. Sharkey reports a case of tumor\r\nof the pons varolii and left crus cerebri, in which for months there\r\nwas excessive generalized perspiration; it finally disappeared without\r\ntreatment. Hutchinson describes the case of a woman of sixty-four who\r\nfor four years had been troubled by excessive sweating on the right\r\nside of the face and scalp. At times she was also troubled by an\r\nexcessive flow of saliva, but she could not say if it was unilateral.\r\nThere was great irritation of the right side of the tongue, and for two\r\nyears taste was totally abolished. It was normal at the time of\r\nexamination. The author offered no explanation of this case, but the\r\npatient gave a decidedly neurotic history, and the symptoms seem to\r\npoint with some degree of probability to hysteria. Pope reports a\r\npeculiar case in which there were daily attacks of neuralgia preceded\r\nby sweating confined to a bald spot on the head. Rockwell reports a\r\ncase of unilateral hyperidrosis in a feeble old man which he thought\r\ndue to organic affection of the cervical sympathetic.\r\n\r\nDupont has published an account of a curious case of chronic general\r\nhyperidrosis or profuse sweating which lasted upward of six years. The\r\nwoman thus affected became pregnant during this time and was happily\r\ndelivered of an infant, which she nursed herself. According to Dupont,\r\nthis hyperidrosis was independent of any other affection, and after\r\nhaving been combated fruitlessly by various remedies, yielded at last\r\nto fluid extract of aconitin.\r\n\r\nMyrtle relates the case of a man of seventy-seven, who, after some\r\nflying pains and fever, began to sweat profusely and continued to do so\r\nuntil he died from exhaustion at the end of three months from the onset\r\nof the sweating. Richardson records another case of the same kind.\r\nCrocker quotes the case of a tailor of sixty-five in whom hyperidrosis\r\nhad existed for thirty-five years. It was usually confined to the hands\r\nand feet, but when worst affected the whole body. It was absent as long\r\nas he preserved the horizontal posture, but came on directly when he\r\nrose; it was always increased in the summer months. At the height of\r\nthe attack the man lost appetite and spirit, had a pricking sensation,\r\nand sometimes minute red papules appeared all over the hand. He had\r\ntried almost every variety of treatment, but sulphur did the most good,\r\nas it had kept the disease under for twelve months. Latterly, even that\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nBachman reports the history of a case of hyperidrosis cured by\r\nhypnotism.\r\n\r\nUnilateral and localized sweating accompanies some forms of nervous\r\ndisturbance. Mickle has discussed unilateral sweating in the general\r\nparalysis of the insane. Ramskill reports a case of sweating on one\r\nside of the face in a patient who was subject to epileptic convulsions.\r\nTakacs describes a case of unilateral sweating with proportionate\r\nnervous prostration. Bartholow and Bryan report unilateral sweating of\r\nthe head. Cason speaks of unilateral sweating of the head, face, and\r\nneck. Elliotson mentions sweat from the left half of the body and the\r\nleft extremities only. Lewis reports a case of unilateral perspiration\r\nwith an excess of temperature of 3.5 degrees F. in the axilla of the\r\nperspiring side. Mills, White, Dow, and Duncan also cite instances of\r\nunilateral perspiration. Boquis describes a case of unilateral\r\nperspiration of the skin of the head and face, and instances of\r\ncomplete unilateral perspiration have been frequently recorded by the\r\nolder writers,--Tebure, Marcellus Donatus, Paullini, and Hartmann\r\ndiscussing it. Hyperidrosis confined to the hands and feet is quite\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nInstances of bloody sweat and \"stigmata\" have been known through the\r\nages and are most interesting anomalies. In the olden times there were\r\npeople who represented that in their own persons they realized at\r\ncertain periods the agonies of Gethsemane, as portrayed in medieval\r\nart, e.g., by pictures of Christ wearing the crown of thorns in\r\nPilate's judgment hall. Some of these instances were, perhaps, of the\r\nnature of compensatory hemorrhage, substituting the menses or periodic\r\nhemorrhoids, hemoptysis, epistaxis, etc., or possibly purpura. Extreme\r\nreligious frenzy or deep emotions might have been the indirect cause of\r\na number of these bleeding zealots. There are instances on record in\r\nwhich fear and other similar emotions have caused a sweating of blood,\r\nthe expression \"sweating blood\" being not uncommon.\r\n\r\nAmong the older writers, Ballonius, Marcolini, and Riedlin mention\r\nbloody sweat. The Ephemerides speaks of it in front of the\r\nhypochondrium. Paullini observed a sailor of thirty, who, falling\r\nspeechless and faint during a storm on the deck of his ship, sweated a\r\nred perspiration from his entire body and which stained his clothes. He\r\nalso mentions bloody sweat following coitus. Aristotle speaks of bloody\r\nsweat, and Pellison describes a scar which periodically opened and\r\nsweated blood. There were many cases like this, the scars being usually\r\nin the location of Christ's wounds.\r\n\r\nDe Thou mentions an Italian officer who in 1552, during the war between\r\nHenry II of France and Emperor Charles V, was threatened with public\r\nexecution; he became so agitated that he sweated blood from every\r\nportion of the body. A young Florentine about to be put to death by an\r\norder of Pope Sixtus V was so overcome with grief that he shed bloody\r\ntears and sweated blood. The Ephemerides contains many instances of\r\nbloody tears and sweat occasioned by extreme fear, more especially fear\r\nof death.  Mezeray mentions that the detestable Charles IX of France,\r\nbeing under constant agitation and emotion, sank under a disorder which\r\nwas accompanied by an exudation of blood from every pore of his body.\r\nThis was taken as an attempt of nature to cure by bleeding according to\r\nthe theory of the venesectionists. Fabricius Hildanus mentions a child\r\nwho, as a rule, never drank anything but water, but once, contrary to\r\nher habit, drank freely of white wine, and this was soon followed by\r\nhemorrhage from the gums, nose, and skin.\r\n\r\nThere is a case also related of a woman of forty-five who had lost her\r\nonly son. One day she fancied she beheld him beseeching her to release\r\nhis soul from purgatory by prayers and fasting every Friday. The\r\nfollowing Friday, which was in the month of August, and for five\r\nsucceeding Fridays she had a profuse bloody perspiration, the disorder\r\ndisappearing on Friday, March 8th, of the following year. Pooley says\r\nthat Maldonato, in his \"Commentaries of Four Gospels,\" mentions a\r\nhealthy and robust man who on hearing of his sentence of death sweated\r\nblood, and Zacchias noted a similar phenomenon in a young man condemned\r\nto the flames. Allusion may also be made to St. Luke, who said of\r\nChrist that in agony He prayed more earnestly, \"and His sweat was, as\r\nit were, great drops of blood falling down to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nPooley quotes the case of a young woman of indolent habit who in a\r\nreligious fanatical trance sweated blood. The stigmatists were often\r\nimposters who artificially opened their scars, and set the example for\r\nthe really peculiar cases of bloody sweat, which among ignorant people\r\nwas considered evidence of sympathy with the agony of the Cross.\r\n\r\nProbably the best studied case on record is that of Louise Lateau of\r\nBois d'Haine, which, according to Gray, occurred in 1869 in a village\r\nof Belgium when the girl was at the age of twenty-three; her previous\r\nlife had offered nothing remarkable. The account is as follows: \"One\r\nFriday Louise Lateau noticed that blood was flowing from one side of\r\nher chest, and this recurred every Friday. On each Thursday morning an\r\noval surface about one inch in length on the back of each hand became\r\npink in color and smooth, whilst a similar oval surface on the palm of\r\neach hand became of the same hue, and on the upper surface of each foot\r\na pinkish-white square appeared. Examined under a magnifying glass, the\r\nepidermis appeared at first without solution of continuity and\r\ndelicate. About noon on Thursday a vesicle formed on the pink surfaces\r\ncontaining clear serum. In the night between Thursday and Friday,\r\nusually between midnight and one o'clock, the flow of blood began, the\r\nvesicle first rupturing. The amount of blood lost during the so called\r\nstigmata varied, and some observers estimated it at about one and\r\nthree-quarter pints. The blood itself was of a reddish color, inclining\r\nto violet, about the hue therefore, of capillary blood, coagulating in\r\nthe usual way, and the white and red corpuscles being normal in\r\ncharacter and relative proportion. The flow ceased on Saturdays. During\r\nthe flow of the blood the patient was in a rapt, ecstatic condition.\r\nThe facial expression was one of absorption and far-off contemplation,\r\nchanging often to melancholy, terror, to an attitude of prayer or\r\ncontrition. The patient herself stated that at the beginning of the\r\necstasy she imagined herself surrounded by a brilliant light; figures\r\nthen passed before her, and the successive scenes of the crucifixion\r\nwere panoramically progressive. She saw Christ in person--His clothing,\r\nHis wounds, His crown of thorns, His cross--as well as the Apostles,\r\nthe holy women, and the assembled Jews. During the ecstasy the\r\ncirculation of the skin and heart was regular, although at times a\r\nsudden flash or pallor overspread the face, according with the play of\r\nthe expression. From midday of Thursdays, when she took a frugal meal,\r\nuntil eight o'clock on Saturday mornings the girl took no nourishment,\r\nnot even water, because it was said that she did not feel the want of\r\nit and could not retain anything upon her stomach. During this time the\r\nordinary secretions were suspended.\"\r\n\r\nFournier mentions a statesman of forty-five who, following great\r\nCabinet labors during several years and after some worriment, found\r\nthat the day after indulging in sexual indiscretions he would be in a\r\nfebrile condition, with pains in the thighs, groins, legs, and penis.\r\nThe veins of these parts became engorged, and subsequently blood oozed\r\nfrom them, the flow lasting several days. The penis was the part most\r\naffected. He was under observation for twenty months and presented the\r\nsame phenomena periodically, except that during the last few months\r\nthey were diminished in every respect. Fournier also mentions a curious\r\ncase of diapedesis in a woman injured by a cow. The animal struck her\r\nin the epigastric region, she fell unconscious, and soon after vomited\r\ngreat quantities of blood, and continued with convulsive efforts of\r\nexpulsion to eject blood periodically from every eight to fifteen days,\r\nlosing possibly a pound at each paroxysm. There was no alteration of\r\nher menses. A physician gave her astringents, which partly suppressed\r\nthe vomiting, but the hemorrhage changed to the skin, and every day she\r\nsweated blood from the chest, back of the thighs, feet, and the\r\nextremities of the fingers. When the blood ceased to flow from her skin\r\nshe lost her appetite, became oppressed, and was confined to her bed\r\nfor some days. Itching always preceded the appearance of a new flow.\r\nThere was no dermal change that could be noticed.\r\n\r\nFullerton mentions a girl of thirteen who had occasional oozing of\r\nblood from her brow, face, and the skin under the eyes.  Sometimes a\r\npound of clots was found about her face and pillow.  The blood first\r\nappeared in a single clot, and, strange to say, lumps of fleshy\r\nsubstance and minute pieces of bone were discharged all day. This\r\nlatter discharge became more infrequent, the bone being replaced by\r\ncartilaginous substance. There was no pain, discoloration, swelling, or\r\nsoreness, and after this strange anomaly disappeared menstruation\r\nregularly commenced. Van Swieten mentions a young lady who from her\r\ntwelfth year at her menstrual periods had hemorrhages from pustules in\r\nthe skin, the pustules disappearing in the interval.\r\n\r\nSchmidt's Jahrbucher for 1836 gives an account of a woman who had\r\ndiseased ovaries and a rectovesicovaginal fistula, and though sometimes\r\ncatamenia appeared at the proper place it was generally arrested and\r\nhemorrhage appeared on the face. Chambers mentions a woman of\r\ntwenty-seven who suffered from bloody sweat after the manner of the\r\nstigmatists, and Petrone mentions a young man of healthy antecedents,\r\nthe sweat from whose axillae and pubes was red and very pungent.\r\nPetrone believes it was due to a chromogenic micrococcus, and relieved\r\nthe patient by the use of a five per cent solution of caustic potash.\r\nChloroform, ether, and phenol had been tried without success. Hebra\r\nmentions a young man in whom the blood spurted from the hand in a\r\nspiral jet corresponding to the direction of the duct of the\r\nsweat-gland.  Wilson refers to five cases of bloody sweat.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of a patient who once or twice a day was attacked\r\nwith swelling of the scrotum, which at length acquired a deep red color\r\nand a stony hardness, at which time the blood would spring from a\r\nhundred points and flow in the finest streams until the scrotum was\r\nagain empty.\r\n\r\nHill describes a boy of four who during the sweating stage of malaria\r\nsweated blood from the head and neck. Two months later the\r\nskin-hemorrhages ceased and the boy died, vomiting blood and with\r\nbloody stools.\r\n\r\nPostmortem sweating is described in the Ephemerides and reported by\r\nHasenest and Schneider. Bartholinus speaks of bloody sweat in a cadaver.\r\n\r\nIn considering the anomalies of lactation we shall first discuss those\r\nof color and then the extraordinary places of secretion.  Black milk is\r\nspoken of by the Ephemerides and Paullini. Red milk has been observed\r\nby Cramer and Viger. Green milk has been observed by Lanzonius,\r\nRiverius, and Paullini. The Ephemerides also contains an account of\r\ngreen milk. Yellow milk has been mentioned in the Ephemerides and its\r\ncause ascribed to eating rhubarb.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that some cathartics administered to nursing\r\nmothers are taken from the breast by their infants, who,\r\nnotwithstanding its indirect mode of administration, exhibit the\r\neffects of the original drug. The same is the case with some poisons,\r\nand instances of lead-poisoning and arsenic-poisoning have been seen in\r\nchildren who have obtained the toxic substance in the mother's milk.\r\nThere is one singular case on record in which a child has been poisoned\r\nfrom the milk of its mother after she had been bitten by a serpent.\r\n\r\nPaullini and the Ephemerides give instances of milk appearing in the\r\nperspiration, and there are numerous varieties of milk-metastasis\r\nrecorded Dolaeus and Nuck mention the appearance of milk in the saliva.\r\nAutenreith mentions metastasis of milk through an abdominal abscess to\r\nthe thigh, and Balthazaar also mentions excretion of milk from the\r\nthigh. Bourdon mentions milk from the thigh, labia, and vulva. Klein\r\nspeaks of the metastasis of the milk to the lochia. Gardane speaks of\r\nmetastasis to the lungs, and there is another case on record in which\r\nthis phenomenon caused asphyxia. Schenck describes excretion of milk\r\nfrom the bladder and uterus. Jaeger in 1770 at Tubingen describes the\r\nmetastasis of milk to the umbilicus, Haen to the back, and Schurig to a\r\nwound in the foot. Knackstedt has seen an abscess of the thigh which\r\ncontained eight pounds of milk. Hauser gives the history of a case in\r\nwhich the kidneys secreted milk vicariously.\r\n\r\nThere is the history of a woman who suffered from metastasis of milk to\r\nthe stomach, and who, with convulsive action of the chest and abdomen,\r\nvomited it daily. A peculiar instance of milk in a tumor is that of a\r\nMrs. Reed, who, when pregnant with twins, developed an abdominal tumor\r\nfrom which 25 pounds of milk was drawn off.\r\n\r\nThere is a French report of secretion of milk in the scrotum of a man\r\nof twenty-one. The scrotum was tumefied, and to the touch gave the\r\nsensation of a human breast, and the parts were pigmented similar to an\r\nengorged breast. Analysis showed the secretion to have been true human\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nCases of lactation in the new-born are not infrequent.  Bartholinus,\r\nBaricelli, Muraltus, Deusingius, Rhodius, Schenck, and Schurig mention\r\ninstances of it. Cardanus describes an infant of one month whose\r\nbreasts were swollen and gave milk copiously.  Battersby cites a\r\ndescription of a male child three weeks old whose breasts were full of\r\na fluid, analysis proving it to have been human milk; Darby, in the\r\nsame journal, mentions a child of eight days whose breasts were so\r\nengorged that the nurse had to milk it. Faye gives an interesting paper\r\nin which he has collected many instances of milk in the breasts of the\r\nnew-born.  Jonston details a description of lactation in an infant.\r\nVariot mentions milk-secretion in the new-born and says that it\r\ngenerally takes place from the eighth to the fifteenth day and not in\r\nthe first week. He also adds that probably mammary abscesses in the\r\nnew-born could be avoided if the milk were squeezed out of the breasts\r\nin the first days. Variot says that out of 32 children of both sexes,\r\naged from six to nine months, all but six showed the presence of milk\r\nin the breasts. Gibb mentions copious milk-secretion in an infant, and\r\nSworder and Menard have seen young babes with abundant milk-secretion.\r\n\r\nPrecocious Lactation.--Bochut says that he saw a child whose breasts\r\nwere large and completely developed, offering a striking contrast to\r\nthe slight development of the thorax. They were as large as a stout\r\nman's fist, pear-shaped, with a rosy areola, in the center of which was\r\na nipple. These precocious breasts increased in size at the beginning\r\nof the menstrual epoch (which was also present) and remained enlarged\r\nwhile the menses lasted.  The vulva was covered with thick hair and the\r\nexternal genitalia were well developed. The child was reticent, and\r\nwith a doll was inclined to play the role of mother.\r\n\r\nBaudelocque mentions a girl of eight who suckled her brother with her\r\nextraordinarily developed breasts. In 1783 this child milked her\r\nbreasts in the presence of the Royal Academy at Paris. Belloc spoke of\r\na similar case. There is another of a young negress who was able to\r\nnourish an infant; and among the older writers we read accounts of\r\nyoung virgins who induced lactation by applying infants to their\r\nbreasts. Bartholinus, Benedictus, Hippocrates, Lentilius, Salmuth, and\r\nSchenck mention lactation in virgins.\r\n\r\nDe la Coide describes a case in which lactation was present, though\r\nmenstruation had always been deficient. Dix, at the Derby Infirmary,\r\nhas observed two females in whom there was continued lactation,\r\nalthough they had never been pregnant. The first was a chaste female of\r\ntwenty-five, who for two years had abundant and spontaneous discharge\r\nof milk that wetted the linen; and the other was in a prostitute of\r\ntwenty, who had never been pregnant, but who had, nevertheless, for\r\nseveral months an abundant secretion of healthy milk. Zoologists know\r\nthat a nonpregnant bitch may secrete milk in abundance. Delafond and de\r\nSinnety have cited instances.\r\n\r\nLactation in the aged has been frequently noticed. Amatus Lusitanus and\r\nSchenck have observed lactation in old women; in recent years Dunglison\r\nhas collected some instances. Semple relates the history of an elderly\r\nwoman who took charge of an infant the mother of which had died of\r\npuerperal infection. As a means of soothing the child she allowed it to\r\ntake the nipple, and, strange to say, in thirty-six hours milk appeared\r\nin her breasts, and soon she had a flow as copious as she had ever had\r\nin her early married life. The child thrived on this production of a\r\nsympathetic and spontaneous lactation. Sir Hans Sloane mentions a lady\r\nof sixty-eight who though not having borne a child for twenty years,\r\nnursed her grandchildren one after another.\r\n\r\nMontegre describes a woman in the Department of Charente who bore two\r\nmale children in 1810. Not having enough milk for both, and being too\r\npoor to secure the assistance of a midwife, in her desperation she\r\nsought an old woman named Laverge, a widow of sixty-five, whose husband\r\nhad been dead twenty-nine years. This old woman gave the breast to one\r\nof the children, and in a few days an abundant flow of milk was\r\npresent. For twenty-two months she nursed the infant, and it thrived as\r\nwell as its brother, who was nursed by their common mother--in fact, it\r\nwas even the stronger of the two.\r\n\r\nDargan tells of a case of remarkable rejuvenated lactation in a woman\r\nof sixty, who, in play, placed the child to her breast, and to her\r\nsurprise after three weeks' nursing of this kind there appeared an\r\nabundant supply of milk, even exceeding in amount that of the young\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nBlanchard mentions milk in the breasts of a woman of sixty, and Krane\r\ncites a similar instance. In the Philosophical Transactions there is an\r\ninstance of a woman of sixty-eight having abundant lactation.\r\n\r\nWarren, Boring, Buzzi, Stack, Durston, Egan, Scalzi, Fitzpatrick, and\r\nGillespie mention rejuvenation and renewed lactation in aged women.\r\nFord has collected several cases in which lactation was artificially\r\ninduced by women who, though for some time not having been pregnant\r\nthemselves, nursed for others.\r\n\r\nProlonged lactation and galactorrhea may extend through several\r\npregnancies. Green reports the case of a woman of forty-seven, the\r\nmother of four children, who after each weaning had so much milk\r\nconstantly in her breasts that it had to be drawn until the next birth.\r\nAt the time of report the milk was still secreting in abundance. A\r\nsimilar and oft-quoted case was that of Gomez Pamo, who described a\r\nwoman in whom lactation seemed indefinitely prolonged; she married at\r\nsixteen, two years after the establishment of menstruation. She became\r\npregnant shortly after marriage, and after delivery had continued\r\nlactation for a year without any sign of returning menstruation. Again\r\nbecoming pregnant, she weaned her first child and nursed the other\r\nwithout delay or complication. This occurrence took place fourteen\r\ntimes.  She nursed all 14 of her children up to the time that she found\r\nherself pregnant again, and during the pregnancies after the first the\r\nflow of milk never entirely ceased; always after the birth of an infant\r\nshe was able to nurse it. The milk was of good quality and always\r\nabundant, and during the period between her first pregnancy to seven\r\nyears after the birth of her last child the menses had never\r\nreappeared. She weaned her last child five years before the time of\r\nreport, and since then the milk had still persisted in spite of all\r\ntreatment. It was sometimes so abundant as to necessitate drawing it\r\nfrom the breast to relieve painful tension.\r\n\r\nKennedy describes a woman of eighty-one who persistently menstruated\r\nthrough lactation, and for forty-seven years had uninterruptedly nursed\r\nmany children, some of which were not her own. Three years of this time\r\nshe was a widow. At the last reports she had a moderate but regular\r\nsecretion of milk in her eighty-first year.\r\n\r\nIn regard to profuse lacteal flow, Remy is quoted as having seen a\r\nyoung woman in Japan from whom was taken 12 1/2 pints of milk each day,\r\nwhich is possibly one of the most extreme instance of continued\r\ngalactorrhea on record.\r\n\r\nGalen refers to gynecomastia or gynecomazia; Aristotle says he has seen\r\nmen with mammae a which were as well developed as those of a woman, and\r\nPaulus aegineta recognized the fact in the ancient Greeks. Subsequently\r\nAlbucasis discusses it in his writings. Bartholinus, Behr, Benedictus,\r\nBorellus, Bonet, the Ephemerides, Marcellus Donatus, Schenck, Vesalius,\r\nSchacher, Martineau, and Buffon all discuss the anomalous presence of\r\nmilk in the male breast. Puech says that this condition is found in one\r\nout of 13,000 conscripts.\r\n\r\nTo Bedor, a marine surgeon, we owe the first scientific exposition of\r\nthis subject, and a little later Villeneuve published his article in\r\nthe French dictionary. Since then many observations have been made on\r\nthis subject, and quite recently Laurent has published a most\r\nexhaustive treatise upon it.\r\n\r\nRobert describes an old man who suckled a child, and Meyer discusses\r\nthe case of a castrated man who was said to suckle children. It is said\r\nthat a Bishop of Cork, who gave one-half crown to an old Frenchman of\r\nseventy, was rewarded by an exhibition of his breasts, which were\r\nlarger than the Bishop had ever seen in a woman. Petrequin speaks of a\r\nmale breast 18 inches long which he amputated, and Laurent gives the\r\nphotograph of a man whose breasts measured 30 cm. in circumference at\r\nthe base, and hung like those of a nursing woman.\r\n\r\nIn some instances whole families with supernumerary breasts are seen.\r\nHandyside gives two instances of quadruple breasts in brothers.\r\nBlanchard speaks of a father who had a supernumerary nipple on each\r\nbreast and his seven sons had the same deformities; it was not noticed\r\nin the daughters. The youngest son transmitted this anomaly to his four\r\nsons. Petrequin describes a man with three mammae, two on the left\r\nside, the third being beneath the others. He had three sons with\r\naccessory mammae on the right side and two daughters with the same\r\nanomaly on the left side. Savitzky reports a case of gynecomazia in a\r\npeasant of twenty-one whose father, elder brother, and a cousin were\r\nsimilarly endowed. The patient's breasts were 33 cm. in circumference\r\nand 15 cm. from the nipple to the base of the gland; they resembled\r\nnormal female mammae in all respects. The penis and the other genitalia\r\nwere normal, but the man had a female voice and absence of facial hair.\r\nThere was an abundance of subcutaneous fat and a rather broad pelvis.\r\n\r\nWiltshire said that he knew a gynecomast in the person of a\r\ndistinguished naturalist who since the age of puberty observed activity\r\nin his breasts, accompanied with secretion of milky fluid which lasted\r\nfor a period of six weeks and occurred every spring. This authority\r\nalso mentions that the French call husbands who have well-developed\r\nmammae \"la couvade;\" the Germans call male supernumerary breasts\r\n\"bauchwarze,\" or ventral nipples.  Hutchinson describes several cases\r\nof gynecomazia, in which the external genital organs decreased in\r\nproportion to the size of the breast and the manners became effeminate.\r\nCameron, quoted by Snedden, speaks of a fellow-student who had a\r\nsupernumerary nipple, and also says he saw a case in a little boy who\r\nhad an extra pair of nipples much wider than the ordinary ones.\r\nAnsiaux, surgeon of Liege, saw a conscript of thirteen whose left mamma\r\nwas well developed like that of a woman, and whose nipple was\r\nsurrounded by a large areola. He said that this breast had always been\r\nlarger than the other, but since puberty had grown greatly; the genital\r\norgans were well formed. Morgan examined a seaman of twenty-one,\r\nadmitted to the Royal Naval Hospital at Hong Kong, whose right mamma,\r\nin size and conformation, had the appearance of the well developed\r\nbreast of a full-grown woman. It was lobulated and had a large,\r\nbrown-colored areola; the nipple, however, was of the same size as that\r\non the left breast. The man stated that he first observed the breast to\r\nenlarge at sixteen and a half years; since that time it had steadily\r\nincreased, but there was no milk at any time from the nipple; the\r\nexternal genital organs were well and fully developed. He complained of\r\nno pain or uneasiness except when in drilling aloft his breast came in\r\ncontact with the ropes.\r\n\r\nGruger of St. Petersburg divides gynecomazia into three classes:--\r\n\r\n(1) That in which the male generative organs are normal;\r\n\r\n(2) In which they are deformed;\r\n\r\n(3) In which the anomaly is spurious, the breast being a mass of fat or\r\na new growth.\r\n\r\nThe same journal quotes an instance (possibly Morgan's case) in a young\r\nman of twenty-one with a deep voice, excellent health, and genitals\r\nwell developed, and who cohabited with his wife regularly. When sixteen\r\nhis right breast began to enlarge, a fact that he attributed to the\r\npressure of a rope. Glandular substance could be distinctly felt, but\r\nthere was no milk-secretion. The left breast was normal. Schuchardt has\r\ncollected 272 cases of gynecomazia.\r\n\r\nInstances of Men Suckling Infants.--These instances of gynecomazia are\r\nparticularly interesting when the individuals display ability to suckle\r\ninfants. Hunter refers to a man of fifty who shared equally with his\r\nwife the suckling of their children. There is an instance of a sailor\r\nwho, having lost his wife, took his son to his own breast to quiet him,\r\nand after three or four days was able to nourish him. Humboldt\r\ndescribes a South American peasant of thirty-two who, when his wife\r\nfell sick immediately after delivery, sustained the child with his own\r\nmilk, which came soon after the application to the breast; for five\r\nmonths the child took no other nourishment. In Franklin's \"Voyages to\r\nthe Polar Seas\" he quotes the instance of an old Chippewa who, on\r\nlosing his wife in childbirth, had put his infant to his breast and\r\nearnestly prayed that milk might flow; he was fortunate enough to\r\neventually produce enough milk to rear the child. The left breast, with\r\nwhich he nursed, afterward retained its unusual size. According to\r\nMehliss some missionaries in Brazil in the sixteenth century asserted\r\nthat there was a whole Indian nation whose women had small and withered\r\nbreasts, and whose children owed their nourishment entirely to the\r\nmales.  Hall exhibited to his class in Baltimore a negro of fifty-five\r\nwho had suckled all his mistress' family. Dunglison reports this case\r\nin 1837, and says that the mammae projected seven inches from the\r\nchest, and that the external genital organs were well developed.\r\nPaullini and Schenck cite cases of men suckling infants, and Blumenbach\r\nhas described a male-goat which, on account of the engorgement of the\r\nmammae, it was necessary to milk every other day of the year.\r\n\r\nFord mentions the case of a captain who in order to soothe a child's\r\ncries put it to his breast, and who subsequently developed a full\r\nsupply of milk. He also quotes an instance of a man suckling his own\r\nchildren, and mentions a negro boy of fourteen who secreted milk in one\r\nbreast. Hornor and Pulido y Fernandez also mention similar instances of\r\ngynecomazia.\r\n\r\nHuman Odors.--Curious as it may seem, each individual as well as each\r\nspecies is in life enveloped with an odor peculiarly its own, due to\r\nits exhaled breath, its excretions, and principally to its insensible\r\nperspiration. The faculty of recognizing an odor in different\r\nindividuals, although more developed in savage tribes, is by no means\r\nunknown in civilized society. Fournier quotes the instance of a young\r\nman who, like a dog, could smell the enemy by scent, and who by smell\r\nalone recognized his own wife from other persons.\r\n\r\nFournier also mentions a French woman, an inhabitant of Naples, who had\r\nan extreme supersensitiveness of smell. The slightest odor was to her\r\nintolerable; sometimes she could not tolerate the presence of certain\r\nindividuals. She could tell in a numerous circle which women were\r\nmenstruating. This woman could not sleep in a bed which any one else\r\nhad made, and for this reason discharged her maid, preparing her own\r\ntoilet and her sleeping apartments. Cadet de Gassieourt witnessed this\r\npeculiar instance, and in consultation with several of the physicians\r\nof Paris attributed this excessive sensitiveness to the climate. There\r\nis a tale told of a Hungarian monk who affirmed that he was able to\r\ndecide the chastity of females by the sense of smell alone. It is well\r\nknown that some savage tribes with their large, open nostrils not only\r\nrecognize their enemies but also track game the same as hounds.\r\n\r\nIndividual Odors.--Many individuals are said to have exhaled\r\nparticularly strong odors, and history is full of such instances.  We\r\nare told by Plutarch that Alexander the Great exhaled an odor similar\r\nto that of violet flowers, and his undergarments always smelled of this\r\nnatural perfume. It is said that Cujas offered a particular analogy to\r\nthis. On the contrary, there are certain persons spoken of who exhaled\r\na sulphurous odor. Martial said that Thais was an example of the class\r\nof people whose odor was insupportable. Schmidt has inserted in the\r\nEphemerides an account of a journeyman saddler, twenty-three years of\r\nage, of rather robust constitution, whose hands exhaled a smell of\r\nsulphur so powerful and penetrating as to rapidly fill any room in\r\nwhich he happened to be. Rayer was once consulted by a valet-de-chambre\r\nwho could never keep a place in consequence of the odor he left behind\r\nhim in the rooms in which he worked.\r\n\r\nHammond is quoted with saying that when the blessed Venturni of\r\nBergamons officiated at the altar people struggled to come near him in\r\norder to enjoy the odor he exhaled. It was said that St.  Francis de\r\nPaul, after he had subjected himself to frequent disciplinary\r\ninflictions, including a fast of thirty-eight to forty days, exhaled a\r\nmost sensible and delicious odor. Hammond attributes the peculiar odors\r\nof the saints of earlier days to neglect of washing and, in a measure,\r\nto affections of the nervous system. It may be added that these odors\r\nwere augmented by aromatics, incense, etc., artificially applied. In\r\nmore modern times Malherbe and Haller were said to diffuse from their\r\nbodies the agreeable odor of musk. These \"human flowers,\" to use\r\nGoethe's expression, are more highly perfumed in Southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nModifying Causes.--According to Brieude, sex, age, climate, habits,\r\nailments, the passions, the emotions, and the occupations modify the\r\ndifference in the humors exhaled, resulting in necessarily different\r\nodors. Nursing infants have a peculiar sourish smell, caused by the\r\nbutyric acid of the milk, while bottle-fed children smell like strong\r\nbutter. After being weaned the odors of the babies become less decided.\r\nBoys when they reach puberty exhibit peculiar odors which are similar\r\nto those of animals when in heat. These odors are leading symptoms of\r\nwhat Borden calls \"seminal fever\" and are more strongly marked in those\r\nof a voluptuous nature. They are said to be caused by the absorption of\r\nspermatic fluid into the circulation and its subsequent elimination by\r\nthe skin. This peculiar circumstance, however, is not seen in girls, in\r\nwhom menstruation is sometimes to be distinguished by an odor somewhat\r\nsimilar to that of leather. Old age produces an odor similar to that of\r\ndry leaves, and there have been persons who declared that they could\r\ntell approximately the age of individuals by the sense of smell.\r\n\r\nCertain tribes and races of people have characteristic odors.  Negroes\r\nhave a rank ammoniacal odor, unmitigated by cleanliness; according to\r\nPruner-Bey it is due to a volatile oil set free by the sebaceous\r\nfollicles. The Esquimaux and Greenlanders have the odors of their\r\ngreasy and oily foods, and it is said that the Cossacks, who live much\r\nwith their horses, and who are principally vegetarians, will leave the\r\natmosphere charged with odors several hours after their passage in\r\nnumbers through a neighborhood. The lower race of Chinamen are\r\ndistinguished by a peculiar musty odor, which may be noticed in the\r\nlaundry shops of this country. Some people, such as the low grade of\r\nIndians, have odors, not distinctive, and solely due to the filth of\r\ntheir persons. Food and drink, as have been mentioned, markedly\r\ninfluence the odor of an individual, and those perpetually addicted to\r\na special diet or drink have a particular odor.\r\n\r\nOdor after Coitus.--Preismann in 1877 makes the statement that for six\r\nhours after coitus there is a peculiar odor noticeable in the breath,\r\nowing to a peculiar secretion of the buccal glands.  He says that this\r\nodor is most perceptible in men of about thirty-five, and can be\r\ndiscerned at a distance of from four to six feet. He also adds that\r\nthis fact would be of great medicolegal value in the early arrest of\r\nthose charged with rape.  In this connection the analogy of the breath\r\nimmediately after coitus to the odor of chloroform has been mentioned.\r\nThe same article states that after coitus naturally foul breath becomes\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\nThe emotions are said to have a decided influence on the odor of an\r\nindividual. Gambrini, quoted by Monin, mentions a young man,\r\nunfortunate in love and violently jealous, whose whole body exhaled a\r\nsickening, pernicious, and fetid odor. Orteschi met a young lady who,\r\nwithout any possibility of fraud, exhaled the strong odor of vanilla\r\nfrom the commissures of her fingers.\r\n\r\nRayer speaks of a woman under his care at the Hopital de la Charite\r\naffected with chronic peritonitis, who some time before her death\r\nexhaled a very decided odor of musk. The smell had been noticed several\r\ndays, but was thought to be due to a bag of musk put purposely into the\r\nbed to overpower other bad smells. The woman, however, gave full\r\nassurance that she had no kind of perfume about her and that her\r\nclothes had been frequently changed. The odor of musk in this case was\r\nvery perceptible on the arms and other portions of the body, but did\r\nnot become more powerful by friction. After continuing for about eight\r\ndays it grew fainter and nearly vanished before the patient's death.\r\nSperanza relates a similar case.\r\n\r\nComplexion.--Pare states that persons of red hair and freckled\r\ncomplexion have a noxious exhalation; the odor of prussic acid is said\r\nto come from dark individuals, while blondes exhale a secretion\r\nresembling musk. Fat persons frequently have an oleaginous smell.\r\n\r\nThe disorders of the nervous system are said to be associated with\r\npeculiar odors. Fevre says the odor of the sweat of lunatics resembles\r\nthat of yellow deer or mice, and Knight remarks that the absence of\r\nthis symptom would enable him to tell whether insanity was feigned or\r\nnot. Burrows declares that in the absence of further evidence he would\r\nnot hesitate to pronounce a person insane if he could perceive certain\r\nassociate odors. Sir William Gull and others are credited with\r\nasserting that they could detect syphilis by smell. Weir Mitchell has\r\nobserved that in lesions of nerves the corresponding cutaneous area\r\nexhaled the odor of stagnant water. Hammond refers to three cases under\r\nhis notice in which specific odors were the results of affections of\r\nthe nervous system. One of these cases was a young woman of hysterical\r\ntendencies who exhaled the odor of violets, which pervaded her\r\napartments. This odor was given off the left half of the chest only and\r\ncould be obtained concentrated by collecting the perspiration on a\r\nhandkerchief, heating it with four ounces of spirit, and distilling the\r\nremaining mixture. The administration of the salicylate of soda\r\nmodified in degree this violaceous odor. Hammond also speaks of a young\r\nlady subject to chorea whose insensible perspiration had an odor of\r\npineapples; a hypochondriac gentleman under his care smelled of\r\nviolets. In this connection he mentions a young woman who, when\r\nsuffering from intense sick headache, exhaled an odor resembling that\r\nof Limburger cheese.\r\n\r\nBarbier met a case of disordered innervation in a captain of infantry,\r\nthe upper half of whose body was subject to such offensive perspiration\r\nthat despite all treatment he had to finally resign his commission.\r\n\r\nIn lethargy and catalepsy the perspiration very often has a cadaverous\r\nodor, which has probably occasionally led to a mistaken diagnosis of\r\ndeath. Schaper and de Meara speak of persons having a cadaveric odor\r\nduring their entire life.\r\n\r\nVarious ingesta readily give evidence of themselves by their influence\r\nupon the breath. It has been remarked that the breath of individuals\r\nwho have recently performed a prolonged necropsy smells for some hours\r\nof the odor of the cadaver. Such things as copaiba, cubebs, sandalwood,\r\nalcohol, coffee, etc., have their recognizable fragrance. There is an\r\ninstance of a young woman taking Fowler's solution who had periodic\r\noffensive axillary sweats that ceased when the medicine was\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre was a victim of bromidrosis; proximity to him was\r\ninsufferable to his courtiers and mistresses, who said that his odor\r\nwas like that of carrion. Tallemant says that when his wife, Marie de\r\nMedicis, approached the bridal night with him she perfumed her\r\napartments and her person with the essences of the flowers of her\r\ncountry in order that she might be spared the disgusting odor of her\r\nspouse. Some persons are afflicted with an excessive perspiration of\r\nthe feet which often takes a disgusting odor. The inguinoscrotal and\r\ninguinovulvar perspirations have an aromatic odor like that of the\r\ngenitals of either sex.\r\n\r\nDuring menstruation, hyperidrosis of the axillae diffuses an aromatic\r\nodor similar to that of acids or chloroform, and in suppression of\r\nmenses, according to the Ephemerides, the odor is as of hops.\r\n\r\nOdors of Disease.--The various diseases have their own peculiar odors.\r\nThe \"hospital odor,\" so well known, is essentially variable in\r\ncharacter and chiefly due to an aggregation of cutaneous exhalations.\r\nThe wards containing women and children are perfumed with butyric acid,\r\nwhile those containing men are influenced by the presence of alkalies\r\nlike ammonia.\r\n\r\nGout, icterus, and even cholera (Drasch and Porker) have their own\r\nodors. Older observers, confirmed by Doppner, say that all the\r\nplague-patients at Vetlianka diffused an odor of honey. In diabetes\r\nthere is a marked odor of apples. The sweat in dysentery unmistakably\r\nbears the odor of the dejecta. Behier calls the odor of typhoid that of\r\nthe blood, and Berard says that it attracts flies even before death.\r\nTyphus has a mouse-like odor, and the following diseases have at\r\ndifferent times been described as having peculiar odors,--measles, the\r\nsmell of freshly plucked feathers; scarlatina, of bread hot from the\r\noven; eczema and impetigo, the smell of mold; and rupia, a decidedly\r\noffensive odor.\r\n\r\nThe hair has peculiar odors, differing in individuals. The hair of the\r\nChinese is known to have the odor of musk, which cannot be washed away\r\nby the strongest of chemicals. Often the distinctive odor of a female\r\nis really due to the odor of great masses of hair. It is said that\r\nwig-makers simply by the sense of smell can tell whether hair has been\r\ncut from the living head or from combings, as hair loses its odor when\r\nit falls out. In the paroxysms of hysteroepilepsy the hair sometimes\r\nhas a specific odor of ozone. Taenia favosa gives to the scalp an odor\r\nresembling that of cat's urine.\r\n\r\nSexual Influence of Odors.--In this connection it may be mentioned that\r\nthere is a peculiar form of sexual perversion, called by Binet\r\n\"fetichism,\" in which the subject displays a perverted taste for the\r\nodors of handkerchiefs, shoes, underclothing, and other articles of\r\nraiment worn by the opposite sex. Binet maintains that these articles\r\nplay the part of the \"fetich\" in early theology. It is said that the\r\nfavors given by the ladies to the knights in the Middle Ages were not\r\nonly tokens of remembrance and appreciation, but sexual excitants as\r\nwell. In his remarkable \"Osphresiologie,\" Cloquet calls attention to\r\nthe sexual pleasure excited by the odors of flowers, and tells how\r\nRichelieu excited his sexual functions by living in an atmosphere\r\nloaded with these perfumes. In the Orient the harems are perfumed with\r\nintense extracts and flowers, in accordance with the strong belief in\r\nthe aphrodisiac effect of odors.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing quotes several interesting cases in which the connection\r\nbetween the olfactory and sexual functions is strikingly verified.\r\n\r\n\"The case of Henry III shows that contact with a person's perspiration\r\nmay be the exciting cause of passionate love. At the betrothal feast of\r\nthe King of Navarre and Margaret of Valois he accidentally dried his\r\nface with a garment of Maria of Cleves which was moist with her\r\nperspiration. Although she was the bride of the Prince of Conde, Henry\r\nimmediately conceived such a passion for her that he could not resist\r\nit, and, as history shows, made her very unhappy. An analogous instance\r\nis related of Henry IV, whose passion for the beautiful Gabrielle is\r\nsaid to have originated at the instant when, at a ball, he wiped his\r\nbrow with her handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing also says that \"one learns from reading the work of Ploss\r\n('Das Weib') that attempts to attract a person of the opposite sex by\r\nmeans of the perspiration may be discerned in many forms in popular\r\npsychology. In reference to this a custom is remarkable which holds\r\namong the natives of the Philippine Islands when they become engaged.\r\nWhen it becomes necessary for the engaged pair to separate they\r\nexchange articles of wearing apparel, by means of which each becomes\r\nassured of faithfulness.  These objects are carefully preserved,\r\ncovered with kisses, and smelled.\"\r\n\r\nThe love of perfumes by libertines and prostitutes, as well as sensual\r\nwomen of the higher classes, is quite marked. Heschl reported a case of\r\na man of forty-five in whom absence of the olfactory sense was\r\nassociated with imperfect development of the genitals; it is also well\r\nknown that olfactory hallucinations are frequently associated with\r\npsychoses of an erotic type.\r\n\r\nGarnier has recently collected a number of observations of fetichism,\r\nin which he mentions individuals who have taken sexual satisfaction\r\nfrom the odors of shoes, night-dresses, bonnets, drawers, menstrual\r\nnapkins, and other objects of the female toilet. He also mentions\r\ncreatures who have gloated over the odors of the blood and excretions\r\nfrom the bodies of women, and gives instances of fetichism of persons\r\nwho have been arrested in the streets of Paris for clipping the long\r\nhair from young girls.  There are also on record instances of\r\nhomosexual fetichism, a type of disgusting inversion of the sexual\r\ninstinct, which, however, it is not in the province of this work to\r\ndiscuss.\r\n\r\nAmong animals the influence of the olfactory perceptions on the sexual\r\nsense is unmistakable. According to Krafft Ebing, Althaus shows that\r\nanimals of opposite sexes are drawn to each other by means of olfactory\r\nperceptions, and that almost all animals at the time of rutting emit a\r\nvery strong odor from their genitals.  It is said that the dog is\r\nattracted in this way to the bitch several miles away. An experiment by\r\nSchiff is confirmatory. He extirpated the olfactory nerves of puppies,\r\nand found that as they grew the male was unable to distinguish the\r\nfemale. Certain animals, such as the musk-ox, civet-cat, and beaver,\r\npossess glands on their sexual organs that secrete materials having a\r\nvery strong odor. Musk, a substance possessing the most penetrating\r\nodor and used in therapeutics, is obtained from the preputial follicles\r\nof the musk-deer of Thibet; and castor, a substance less penetrating,\r\nis obtained from the preputial sacs of the beaver. Virgin moths\r\n(Bombyx) carried in boxes in the pockets of entomologists will on wide\r\ncommons cause the appearance of males of the same species.\r\n\r\nBulimia is excessive morbid hunger, also called canine appetite.  While\r\nsometimes present in healthy people, it is most often seen in idiots\r\nand the insane, and is a symptom of diabetes mellitus.  Mortimer\r\nmentions a boy of twelve who, while laboring under this affliction, in\r\nsix days devoured food to the extent of 384 pounds and two ounces. He\r\nconstantly vomited, but his craving for food was so insatiable that if\r\nnot satisfied he would devour the flesh off his own bones. Martyn,\r\nProfessor of Botany at Cambridge in the early part of the last century,\r\ntells of a boy ten years old whose appetite was enormous. He consumed\r\nin one week 373 pounds of food and drink. His urine and stools were\r\nvoided in normal quantities, the excess being vomited. A pig was fed on\r\nwhat he vomited, and was sold in the market. The boy continued in this\r\ncondition for a year, and at last reports was fast failing.  Burroughs\r\nmentions a laborer at Stanton, near Bury, who ate an ordinary leg of\r\nveal at a meal, and fed at this extravagant rate for many days\r\ntogether. He would eat thistles and other similar herbs greedily. At\r\ntimes he would void worms as large as the shank of a clay-pipe, and\r\nthen for a short period the bulimia would disappear.\r\n\r\nJohnston mentions a case of bulimia in a man who devoured large\r\nquantities of raw flesh. There is an instance on record of a case of\r\ncanine appetite in which nearly 400 pounds of solid and fluid elements\r\nwere taken into the body in six days and again ejected.  A recovery was\r\neffected by giving very concentrated food, frequently repeated in small\r\nquantities. Mason mentions a woman in St. Bartholomew's Hospital in\r\nLondon in the early part of this century who was wretched unless she\r\nwas always eating. Each day she consumed three quartern-loaves, three\r\npounds of beef-steak, in addition to large quantities of vegetables,\r\nmeal, etc., and water. Smith describes a boy of fourteen who ate\r\ncontinuously fifteen hours out of the twenty-four, and who had eight\r\nbowel movements each day. One year previous his weight was 105 pounds,\r\nbut when last seen he weighed 284 pounds and was increasing a half\r\npound daily. Despite his continuous eating, this boy constantly\r\ncomplained of hunger.\r\n\r\nPolydipsia is an abnormal thirst; it may be seen in persons otherwise\r\nnormal, or it may be associated with diseases--such as diabetes\r\nmellitus or diabetes insipidus. Mackenzie quotes a case from Trousseau,\r\nin which an individual afflicted with diabetes insipidus passed 32\r\nliters of urine daily and drank enormous quantities of water. This\r\npatient subjected himself to severe regimen for eight months,--although\r\none day, in his agonies, he seized the chamber-pot and drank its\r\ncontents at once. Mackenzie also mentions an infant of three who had\r\npolydipsia from birth and drank daily nearly two pailfuls of water. At\r\nthe age of twenty-two she married a cobbler, unaware of her propensity,\r\nwho found that his earnings did not suffice to keep her in water alone,\r\nand he was compelled to melt ice and snow for her. She drank four\r\npailfuls a day, the price being 12 sous; water in the community was\r\nscarce and had to be bought. This woman bore 11 children. At the age of\r\nforty she appeared before a scientific commission and drank in their\r\npresence 14 quarts of water in ten hours and passed ten quarts of\r\nalmost colorless urine. Dickinson mentions that he has had patients in\r\nhis own practice who drank their own urine. Mackenzie also quotes\r\nTrousseau's history of a man who drank a liter of strong French brandy\r\nin two hours, and habitually drank the same quantity daily. He stated\r\nthat he was free from the effects of alcohol; on several occasions on a\r\nwager he took 20 liters of wine, gaining his wager without visibly\r\naffecting his nervous system.\r\n\r\nThere is an instance of a man of fifty-eight who could not live through\r\nthe night without a pail of water, although his health was otherwise\r\ngood. Atkinson in 1856 reported a young man who in childhood was a\r\ndirt-eater, though at that time complaining of nothing but excessive\r\nthirst. He was active, industrious, enjoyed good health, and was not\r\naddicted to alcoholics. His daily ration of water was from eight to\r\ntwelve gallons. He always placed a tub of water by his bed at night,\r\nbut this sometimes proved insufficient. He had frequently driven hogs\r\nfrom mudholes to slake his thirst with the water. He married in 1829\r\nand moved into Western Tennessee, and in 1854 he was still drinking the\r\naccustomed amount; and at this time he had grown-up children.  Ware\r\nmentions a young man of twenty who drank six gallons of water daily. He\r\nwas tormented with thirst, and if he abstained he became weak, sick,\r\nand dizzy. Throughout a long life he continued his habit, sometimes\r\ndrinking a gallon at one draught; he never used spirits. There are\r\nthree cases of polydipsia reported from London in 1792.\r\n\r\nField describes a boy with bilious remittent fever who would drink\r\nuntil his stomach was completely distended and then call for more.\r\nEmesis was followed by cries for more water. Becoming frantic, he would\r\njump from his bed and struggle for the water bucket; failing in this,\r\nhe ran to the kitchen and drank soapsuds, dish-water, and any other\r\nliquid he could find. He had swallowed a mass of mackerel which he had\r\nnot properly masticated, a fact proved later by ejection of the whole\r\nmass.  There is a case on record a in which there was intolerable\r\nthirst after retiring, lasting for a year. There was apparently no\r\npolydipsia during the daytime.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water drunk by glass-blowers in a day is almost\r\nincredible. McElroy has made observations in the glass-factories in his\r\nneighborhood, and estimates that in the nine working hours of each day\r\na glass-blower drinks from 50 to 60 pints of water.  In addition to\r\nthis many are addicted to the use of beer and spirits after working\r\nhours and at lunch-time. The excreta and urine never seem to be\r\nperceptibly increased. When not working these men do not drink more\r\nthan three or four pints of water.  Occasionally a man becomes what is\r\ntermed \"blown-up with water;\" that is, the perspiration ceases, the man\r\nbecomes utterly helpless, has to be carried out, and is disabled until\r\nthe sweating process is restored by vigorously applied friction.  There\r\nis little deleterious change noticed in these men; in fact, they are\r\nrarely invalids.\r\n\r\nHydroadipsia is a lack of thirst or absence of the normal desire for\r\nwater. In some of these cases there is a central lesion which accounts\r\nfor the symptoms. McElroy, among other cases, speaks of one in a\r\npatient who was continually dull and listless, eating little, and\r\ncomplaining of much pain after the least food. This, too, will be\r\nmentioned under abstinence.\r\n\r\nPerverted appetites are of great variety and present many interesting\r\nas well as disgusting examples of anomalies. In some cases the tastes\r\nof people differ so that an article considered by one race as\r\ndisgusting would be held as a delicacy by another class. The ancients\r\nused asafetida as a seasoning, and what we have called \"stercus\r\ndiaboli,\" the Asiatics have named the \"food of the gods.\" The\r\ninhabitants of Greenland drink the oil of the whale with as much\r\navidity as we would a delicate wine, and they eat blubber the mere\r\nsmell of which nauseates an European. In some nations of the lower\r\ngrade, insects, worms, serpents, etc., are considered edible. The\r\ninhabitants of the interior of Africa are said to relish the flesh of\r\nserpents and eat grubs and worms.  The very earliest accounts of the\r\nIndians of Florida and Texas show that \"for food, they dug roots, and\r\nthat they ate spiders, ants' eggs, worms, lizards, salamanders, snakes,\r\nearth, wood, the dung of deer, and many other things.\" Gomara, in his\r\n\"Historia de les Indias,\" says this loathsome diet was particular to\r\none tribe, the Yagusces of Florida. It is said that a Russian peasant\r\nprefers a rotten egg to a fresh one; and there are persons who prefer\r\ngame partly spoiled.\r\n\r\nBourke recalls that the drinking of human urine has often been a\r\nreligious rite, and describes the urine-dance of the Zunis of New\r\nMexico, in which the participants drink freely of their urine; he draws\r\nan analogy to the Feast of the Fools, a religious custom of Pagan\r\norigin which did not disappear in Europe until the time of the\r\nReformation. It is still a practice in some parts of the United States\r\nto give children fresh urine for certain diseases.  It is said that the\r\nordure of the Grand Lama of Thibet was at one time so venerated that it\r\nwas collected and worn as amulets.\r\n\r\nThe disgusting habit of eating human excrement is mentioned by Schurig,\r\nwho gives numerous examples in epileptics, maniacs, chlorotic young\r\nwomen, pregnant women, children who have soiled their beds and,\r\ndreading detection, have swallowed their ejecta, and finally among men\r\nand women with abnormal appetites. The Indians of North America\r\nconsider a broth made from the dung of the hare and caribou a dainty\r\ndish, and according to Abbe Domenech, as a means of imparting a flavor,\r\nthe bands near Lake Superior mix their rice with the excrement of\r\nrabbits. De Bry mentions that the negroes of Guinea ate filthy,\r\nstinking elephant-meat and buffalo-flesh infested with thousands of\r\nmaggots, and says that they ravenously devoured dogs' guts raw.\r\nSpencer, in his \"Descriptive Sociology,\" describes a \"Snake savage\" of\r\nAustralia who devoured the contents of entrails of an animal. Some\r\nauthors have said that within the last century the Hottentots devoured\r\nthe flesh and the entrails of wild beasts, uncleansed of their filth\r\nand excrement, and whether sound or rotten. In a personal letter to\r\nCaptain Bourke, the Reverend J.  Owen Dorsey reports that while among\r\nthe Ponkas he saw a woman and child devour the entrails of a beef with\r\ntheir contents.  Bourke also cites instances in which human ordure was\r\neaten by East Indian fanatics. Numerous authorities are quoted by\r\nBourke to prove the alleged use of ordure in food by the ancient\r\nIsraelites. Pages of such reference are to be found in the works on\r\nScatology, and for further reference the reader is referred to books on\r\nthis subject, of which prominent in English literature is that of\r\nBourke.\r\n\r\nProbably the most revolting of all the perverted tastes is that for\r\nhuman flesh. This is called anthropophagy or cannibalism, and is a\r\ntime-honored custom among some of the tribes of Africa. This custom is\r\noften practised more in the spirit of vengeance than of real desire for\r\nfood. Prisoners of war were killed and eaten, sometimes cooked, and\r\namong some tribes raw. In their religious frenzy the Aztecs ate the\r\nremains of the human beings who were sacrificed to their idols. At\r\nother times cannibalism has been a necessity. In a famine in Egypt, as\r\npictured by the Arab Abdullatif, the putrefying debris of animals, as\r\nwell as their excrement, was used as food, and finally the human dead\r\nwere used; then infants were killed and devoured, so great was the\r\ndistress. In many sieges, shipwrecks, etc., cannibalism has been\r\npracticed as a last resort for sustaining life. When supplies have\r\ngiven out several Arctic explorers have had to resort to eating the\r\nbodies of their comrades. In the famous Wiertz Museum in Brussels is a\r\npainting by this eccentric artist in which he has graphically portrayed\r\na woman driven to insanity by hunger, who has actually destroyed her\r\nchild with a view to cannibalism.  At the siege of Rochelle it is\r\nrelated that, urged by starvation, a father and mother dug up the\r\nscarcely cold body of their daughter and ate it. At the siege of Paris\r\nby Henry IV the cemeteries furnished food for the starving. One mother\r\nin imitation of what occurred at the siege of Jerusalem roasted the\r\nlimbs of her dead child and died of grief under this revolting\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome states that he saw Scotchmen in the Roman armies in Gaul\r\nwhose regular diet was human flesh, and who had \"double teeth all\r\naround.\"\r\n\r\nCannibalism, according to a prominent New York journal, has been\r\nrecently made a special study by the Bureau of Ethnology at Washington,\r\nD.C. Data on the subject have been gathered from all parts of the\r\nworld, which are particularly interesting in view of discoveries\r\npointing to the conclusion that this horrible practice is far more\r\nwidespread than was imagined. Stanley claims that 30,000,000 cannibals\r\ndwell in the basin of the Congo to-day--people who relish human flesh\r\nabove all other meat.  Perah, the most peculiar form of cannibalism, is\r\nfound in certain mountainous districts of northeast Burmah, where there\r\nare tribes that follow a life in all important respects like that of\r\nwild beasts. These people eat the congealed blood of their enemies.\r\nThe blood is poured into bamboo reeds, and in the course of time, being\r\ncorked up, it hardens. The filled reeds are hung under the roofs of the\r\nhuts, and when a person desires to treat his friends very hospitably\r\nthe reeds are broken and the contents devoured.\r\n\r\n\"The black natives of Australia are all professed cannibals. Dr. Carl\r\nLumholtz, a Norwegian scientist, spent many months in studying them in\r\nthe wilds of the interior. He was alone among these savages, who are\r\nextremely treacherous. Wearing no clothing whatever, and living in\r\nnearly every respect as monkeys do, they know no such thing as\r\ngratitude, and have no feeling that can be properly termed human. Only\r\nfear of the traveler's weapons prevented them from slaying him, and\r\nmore than once he had a narrow escape. One of the first of them whom he\r\nemployed looked more like a brute than a man. 'When he talked,' says\r\nthe doctor, 'he rubbed his belly with complacency, as if the sight of\r\nme made his mouth water.' This individual was regarded with much\r\nrespect by his fellows because of his success in procuring human flesh\r\nto eat. These aborigines say that the white man's flesh is salt and\r\noccasions nausea. A Chinaman they consider as good for eating as a\r\nblack man, his food being chiefly vegetable.\r\n\r\n\"The most horrible development of cannibalism among the Australian\r\nblacks is the eating of defunct relatives. When a person dies there\r\nfollows an elaborate ceremony, which terminates with the lowering of\r\nthe corpse into the grave. In the grave is a man not related to the\r\ndeceased, who proceeds to cut off the fat adhering to the muscles of\r\nthe face, thighs, arms, and stomach, and passes it around to be\r\nswallowed by some of the near relatives. All those who have eaten of\r\nthe cadaver have a black ring of charcoal powder and fat drawn around\r\nthe mouth. The order in which the mourners partake of their dead\r\nrelatives is duly prescribed. The mother eats of her children and the\r\nchildren of their mother. A man eats of his sister's husband and of his\r\nbrother's wife. Mothers' brothers, mothers' sisters, sisters' children,\r\nmothers' parents, and daughters' children are also eaten by those to\r\nwhom the deceased person stands in such relation. But the father does\r\nnot eat of his children, nor the children of their sire.\r\n\r\n\"The New Zealanders, up to very recent times, were probably the most\r\nanthropophagous race that ever existed. As many as 1000 prisoners have\r\nbeen slaughtered by them at one time after a successful battle, the\r\nbodies being baked in ovens underground.  If the individual consumed\r\nhad been a redoubtable enemy they dried his head as a trophy and made\r\nflutes of his thigh bones.\r\n\r\n\"Among the Monbuttos of Africa human fat is commonly employed for a\r\nvariety of purposes. The explorer Schweinfurth speaks of writing out in\r\nthe evenings his memoranda respecting these people by the light of a\r\nlittle oil-lamp contrived by himself, which was supplied with some\r\nquestionable-looking grease furnished by the natives. The smell of this\r\ngrease, he says, could not fail to arouse one's worst suspicions\r\nagainst the negroes. According to his account the Monbuttos are the\r\nmost confirmed cannibals in Africa. Surrounded as they are by a number\r\nof peoples who are blacker than themselves, and who, being inferior to\r\nthem in culture, are held in contempt, they carry on expeditions of war\r\nand plunder which result in the acquisition of a booty especially\r\ncoveted by them--namely, human flesh. The bodies of all foes who fall\r\nin battle are distributed on the field among the victors, and are\r\nprepared by drying for transportation. The savages drive their\r\nprisoners before them, and these are reserved for killing at a later\r\ntime. During Schweinfurth's residence at the Court of Munza it was\r\ngenerally understood that nearly every day a little child was\r\nsacrificed to supply a meal for the ogre potentate. For centuries past\r\nthe slave trade in the Congo Basin has been conducted largely for the\r\npurpose of furnishing human flesh to consumers. Slaves are sold and\r\nbought in great numbers for market, and are fattened for slaughter.\r\n\r\n\"The Mundurucus of the Upper Amazon, who are exceedingly ferocious,\r\nhave been accused of cannibalism. It is they who preserve human heads\r\nin such a remarkable way. When one of their warriors has killed an\r\nenemy he cuts off the head with his bamboo knife, removes the brain,\r\nsoaks the head in a vegetable oil, takes out bones of the skull, and\r\ndries the remaining parts by putting hot pebbles inside of it. At the\r\nsame time care is taken to preserve all the features and the hair\r\nintact. By repeating the process with the hot pebbles many times the\r\nhead finally becomes shrunken to that of a small doll, though still\r\nretaining its human aspect, so that the effect produced is very weird\r\nand uncanny. Lastly, the head is decorated with brilliant feathers, and\r\nthe lips are fastened together with a string, by which the head is\r\nsuspended from the rafters of the council-house.\"\r\n\r\nAncient Customs.--According to Herodotus the ancient Lydians and Medes,\r\nand according to Plato the islanders in the Atlantic, cemented\r\nfriendship by drinking human blood. Tacitus speaks of Asian princes\r\nswearing allegiance with their own blood, which they drank. Juvenal\r\nsays that the Scythians drank the blood of their enemies to quench\r\ntheir thirst.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a religious ceremony has given sanction to cannibalism. It\r\nis said that in the Island of Chios there was a rite by way of\r\nsacrifice to Dionysius in which a man was torn limb from limb, and\r\nFaber tells us that the Cretans had an annual festival in which they\r\ntore a living bull with their teeth.  Spencer quotes that among the\r\nBacchic orgies of many of the tribes of North America, at the\r\ninauguration of one of the Clallum chiefs on the northwest coast of\r\nBritish America, the chief seized a small dog and began to devour it\r\nalive, and also bit the shoulders of bystanders. In speaking of these\r\nceremonies, Boas, quoted by Bourke, says that members of the tribes\r\npracticing Hamatsa ceremonies show remarkable scars produced by biting,\r\nand at certain festivals ritualistic cannibalism is practiced, it being\r\nthe duty of the Hamatsa to bite portions of flesh out of the arms,\r\nlegs, or breast of a man.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of cannibalism, and the one which deserves discussion\r\nhere, is genuine perversion or depravity of the appetite for human\r\nflesh among civilized persons,--the desire sometimes being so strong as\r\nto lead to actual murder. Several examples of this anomaly are on\r\nrecord. Gruner of Jena speaks of a man by the name of Goldschmidt, in\r\nthe environs of Weimar, who developed a depraved appetite for human\r\nflesh. He was married at twenty-seven, and for twenty-eight years\r\nexercised his calling as a cow-herd. Nothing extraordinary was noticed\r\nin him, except his rudeness of manner and his choleric and gross\r\ndisposition. In 1771, at the age of fifty-five, he met a young traveler\r\nin the woods, and accused him of frightening his cows; a discussion\r\narose, and subsequently a quarrel, in which Goldschmidt killed his\r\nantagonist by a blow with a stick which he used. To avoid detection he\r\ndragged the body to the bushes, cut it up, and took it home in\r\nsections. He then washed, boiled, and ate each piece.  Subsequently, he\r\ndeveloped a further taste for human flesh, and was finally detected in\r\neating a child which he had enticed into his house and killed. He\r\nacknowledged his appetite before his trial.\r\n\r\nHector Boetius says that a Scotch brigand and his wife and children\r\nwere condemned to death on proof that they killed and ate their\r\nprisoners. The extreme youth of one of the girls excused her from\r\ncapital punishment; but at twelve years she was found guilty of the\r\nsame crime as her father and suffered capital punishment. This child\r\nhad been brought up in good surroundings, yet her inherited appetite\r\ndeveloped. Gall tells of an individual who, instigated by an\r\nirresistible desire to eat human flesh, assassinated many persons; and\r\nhis daughter, though educated away from him, yielded to the same\r\ngraving.\r\n\r\nAt Bicetre there was an individual who had a horribly depraved appetite\r\nfor decaying human flesh. He would haunt the graveyards and eat the\r\nputrefying remains of the recently buried, preferring the intestines.\r\nHaving regaled himself in a midnight prowl, he would fill his pockets\r\nfor future use. When interrogated on the subject of his depravity he\r\nsaid it had existed since childhood.  He acknowledged the greatest\r\ndesire to devour children he would meet playing; but he did not possess\r\nthe courage to kill them.\r\n\r\nProchaska quotes the case of a woman of Milan who attracted children to\r\nher home in order that she might slay, salt, and eat them. About 1600,\r\nthere is the record of a boy named Jean Granier, who had repeatedly\r\nkilled and devoured several young children before he was discovered.\r\nRodericus a Castro tells of a pregnant woman who so strongly desired to\r\neat the shoulder of a baker that she killed him, salted his body, and\r\ndevoured it at intervals.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of a woman who in July, 1817, was discovered in\r\ncooking an amputated leg of her little child. Gorget in 1827 reported\r\nthe celebrated case of Leger the vine dresser, who at the age of\r\ntwenty-four wandered about a forest for eight days during an attack of\r\ndepression. Coming across a girl of twelve, he violated her, and then\r\nmutilated her genitals, and tore out her heart, eating of it, and\r\ndrinking the blood. He finally confessed his crime with calm\r\nindifference. After Leger's execution Esquirol found morbid adhesions\r\nbetween the brain and the cerebral membranes. Mascha relates a similar\r\ninstance in a man of fifty-five who violated and killed a young girl,\r\neating of her genitals and mammae. At the trial he begged for\r\nexecution, saying that the inner impulse that led him to his crime\r\nconstantly persecuted him.\r\n\r\nA modern example of lust-murder and anthropophagy is that of Menesclou,\r\nwho was examined by Brouardel, Motet, and others, and declared to be\r\nmentally sound; he was convicted. This miscreant was arrested with the\r\nforearm of a missing child in his pocket, and in his stove were found\r\nthe head and entrails in a half-burnt condition. Parts of the body were\r\nfound in the water-closet, but the genitals were missing; he was\r\nexecuted, although he made no confession, saying the deed was an\r\naccident. Morbid changes were found in his brain. Krafft-Ebing cites\r\nthe case of Alton, a clerk in England, who lured a child into a\r\nthicket, and after a time returned to his office, where he made an\r\nentry in his note-book: \"Killed to-day a young girl; it was fine and\r\nhot.\" The child was missed, searched for, and found cut into pieces.\r\nMany parts, and among them the genitals, could not be found. Alton did\r\nnot show the slightest trace of emotion, and gave no explanation of the\r\nmotive or circumstances of his horrible deed; he was executed.\r\n\r\nD'Amador tells of persons who went into slaughter-houses and\r\nwaste-places to dispute with wolves for the most revolting carrion. It\r\nis also mentioned that patients in hospitals have been detected in\r\ndrinking the blood of patients after venesections, and in other\r\ninstances frequenting dead-houses and sucking the blood of the recently\r\ndeceased. Du Saulle quotes the case of a chlorotic girl of fourteen who\r\neagerly drank human blood. She preferred that flowing fresh from a\r\nrecent wound.\r\n\r\nFurther Examples of Depraved Appetites.--Bijoux speaks of a porter or\r\ngarcon at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris who was a prodigious glutton.\r\nHe had eaten the body of a lion that had died of disease at the\r\nmenagerie. He ate with avidity the most disgusting things to satiate\r\nhis depraved appetite. He showed further signs of a perverted mind by\r\nclassifying the animals of the menagerie according to the form of their\r\nexcrement, of which he had a collection. He died of indigestion\r\nfollowing a meal of eight pounds of hot bread.\r\n\r\nPercy saw the famous Tarrare, who died at Versailles, at about\r\ntwenty-six years of age. At seventeen he weighed 100 pounds. He ate a\r\nquarter of beef in twenty-four hours. He was fond of the most revolting\r\nthings. He particularly relished the flesh of serpents and would\r\nquickly devour the largest. In the presence of Lorenze he seized a live\r\ncat with his teeth, eventrated it, sucked its blood, and ate it,\r\nleaving the bare skeleton only. In about thirty minutes he rejected the\r\nhairs in the manner of birds of prey and carnivorous animals. He also\r\nate dogs in the same manner. On one occasion it was said that he\r\nswallowed a living eel without chewing it; but he had first bitten off\r\nits head. He ate almost instantly a dinner that had been prepared for\r\n15 vigorous workmen and drank the accompanying water and took their\r\naggregate allowance of salt at the same time. After this meal his\r\nabdomen was so swollen that it resembled a balloon. He was seen by\r\nCourville, a surgeon-major in a military hospital, where he had\r\nswallowed a wooden box wrapped in plain white paper. This he passed the\r\nnext day with the paper intact. The General-in-chief had seen him\r\ndevour thirty pounds of raw liver and lungs. Nothing seemed to diminish\r\nhis appetite. He waited around butcher-shops to eat what was discarded\r\nfor the dogs. He drank the bleedings of the hospital and ate the dead\r\nfrom the dead-houses. He was suspected of eating a child of fourteen\r\nmonths, but no proof could be produced of this. He was of middle height\r\nand was always heated and sweating. He died of a purulent diarrhea, all\r\nhis intestines and peritoneum being in a suppurating condition.\r\n\r\nFulton mentions a girl of six who exhibited a marked taste for feeding\r\non slugs, beetles, cockroaches, spiders, and repulsive insects. This\r\nchild had been carefully brought up and was one of 13 children, none of\r\nwhom displayed any similar depravity of appetite. The child was of good\r\ndisposition and slightly below the normal mental standard for her age.\r\nAt the age of fourteen her appetite became normal.\r\n\r\nIn the older writings many curious instances of abnormal appetite are\r\nseen. Borellus speaks of individuals swallowing stones, horns,\r\nserpents, and toads. Plater mentions snail-eating and eel-eating, two\r\ncustoms still extant. Rhodius is accredited with seeing persons who\r\nswallowed spiders and scorpions. Jonston says that Avicenna, Rufus, and\r\nGentilis relate instances of young girls who acquired a taste for\r\npoisonous animals and substances, who could ingest them with impunity.\r\nColonia Agrippina was supposed to have eaten spiders with impunity. Van\r\nWoensel is said to have seen persons who devoured live eels.\r\n\r\nThe habit of dirt eating or clay-eating, called pica, is well\r\nauthenticated in many countries. The Ephemerides contains mention of\r\nit; Hunter speaks of the blacks who eat potters' clay; Bartholinus\r\ndescribes dirt-eating as does also a Castro. Properly speaking,\r\ndirt-eating should be called geophagism; it is common in the Antilles\r\nand South America, among the low classes, and is seen in the negroes\r\nand poorest classes of some portions of the Southern United States. It\r\nhas also been reported from Java, China, Japan, and is said to have\r\nbeen seen in Spain and Portugal. Peat-eating or bog-eating is still\r\nseen in some parts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of people in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies who had formed the habit of eating small pebbles after each\r\nmeal. They formed the habit from seeing birds swallowing gravel after\r\neating. A number of such cases are on record.\r\n\r\nThere is on record the account of a man living in Wurtemberg who with\r\nmuch voracity had eaten a suckling pig, and sometimes devoured an\r\nentire sheep. He swallowed dirt, clay, pebbles, and glass, and was\r\naddicted to intoxication by brandy. He lived sixty years in this manner\r\nand then he became abstemious; he died at seventy-nine. His omentum was\r\nvery lean, but the liver covered all his abdominal viscera. His stomach\r\nwas very large and thick, but the intestines were very narrow.\r\n\r\nEly had a patient who was addicted to chalk-eating; this ha said\r\ninvariably relieved his gastric irritation. In the twenty-five years of\r\nthe habit he had used over 1/2 ton of chalk; but notwithstanding this\r\nhe always enjoyed good health. The Ephemerides contains a similar\r\ninstance, and Verzascha mentions a lime-eater. Adams mentions a child\r\nof three who had an instinctive desire to eat mortar. This baby was\r\nrickety and had carious teeth. It would pick its preferred diet out of\r\nthe wall, and if prevented would cry loudly. When deprived of the\r\nmortar it would vomit its food until this substance was given to it\r\nagain.  At the time of report part of the routine duties of the sisters\r\nof this boy was to supply him with mortar containing a little sand.\r\nLime-water was substituted, but he insisted so vigorously on the solid\r\nform of food that it had to be replaced in his diet.  He suffered from\r\nsmall-pox; on waking up in the night with a fever, he always cried for\r\na piece of mortar. The quantity consumed in twenty-four hours was about\r\n1/2 teacupful. The child had never been weaned.\r\n\r\nArsenic Eaters.--It has been frequently stated that the peasants of\r\nStyria are in the habit of taking from two to five grains of arsenious\r\nacid daily for the purpose of improving the health, avoiding infection,\r\nand raising the whole tone of the body. It is a well-substantiated fact\r\nthat the quantities taken habitually are quite sufficient to produce\r\nimmediate death ordinarily. But the same might be easily said of those\r\naddicted to opium and chloral, a subject that will be considered later.\r\nPerverted appetites during pregnancy have been discussed on pages 80\r\nand 81.\r\n\r\nGlass-eaters, penknife-swallowers, and sword-swallowers, being\r\nexhibitionists and jugglers, and not individuals with perverted\r\nappetites, will be considered in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nFasting.--The length of time which a person can live with complete\r\nabstinence from food is quite variable. Hippocrates admits the\r\npossibility of fasting more than six days without a fatal issue; but\r\nPliny and others allow a much longer time, and both the ancient and\r\nmodern literature of medicine are replete with examples of abstinence\r\nto almost incredible lengths of time.  Formerly, and particularly in\r\nthe Middle Ages when religious frenzy was at its highest pitch,\r\nprolonged abstinence was prompted by a desire to do penance and to gain\r\nthe approbation of Heaven.\r\n\r\nIn many religions fasting has become a part of worship or religions\r\nceremony, and from the earliest times certain sects have carried this\r\ncustom to extremes. It is well known that some of the priests and\r\nanchorites of the East now subsist on the minimum amount of food, and\r\nfrom the earliest times before the advent of Christianity we find\r\ninstances of prolonged fasting associated with religious worship. The\r\nAssyrians, the Hebrews, the Egyptians, and other Eastern nations, and\r\nalso the Greeks and Romans, as well as feasting days, had their times\r\nof fasting, and some of these were quite prolonged.\r\n\r\nAt the present day religious fervor accounts for but few of our\r\nremarkable instances of abstinence, most of them being due to some form\r\nof nervous disorder, varying from hysteria and melancholia to absolute\r\ninsanity. The ability seen in the Middle Ages to live on the Holy\r\nSacrament and to resist starvation may possibly have its analogy in\r\nsome of the fasting girls of the present day. In the older times these\r\npersons were said to have been nourished by angels or devils; but\r\naccording to Hammond many cases both of diabolical abstinence from food\r\nand of holy fasting exhibited manifest signs of hysteric symptoms.\r\nHammond, in his exhaustive treatise on the subject of \"Fasting Girls,\"\r\nalso remarks that some of the chronicles detail the exact symptoms of\r\nhysteria and without hesitation ascribe them to a devilish agency. For\r\ninstance, he speaks of a young girl in the valley of Calepino who had\r\nall her limbs twisted and contracted and had a sensation in her\r\nesophagus as if a ball was sometimes rising in her throat or falling\r\ninto the stomach--a rather lay description of the characteristic\r\nhysteric \"lump in the throat,\" a frequent sign of nervous abstinence.\r\n\r\nAbstinence, or rather anorexia, is naturally associated with numerous\r\ndiseases, particularly of the febrile type; but in all of these the\r\npatient is maintained by the use of nutrient enemata or by other means,\r\nand the abstinence is never complete.\r\n\r\nA peculiar type of anorexia is that striking and remarkable digestive\r\ndisturbance of hysteria which Sir William Gull has called anorexia\r\nnervosa. In this malady there is such annihilation of the appetite that\r\nin some cases it seems impossible ever to eat again. Out of it grows an\r\nantagonism to food which results at last, and in its worst forms, in\r\nspasm on the approach of food, and this in its turn gives rise to some\r\nof those remarkable cases of survival for long periods without food.\r\nAs this goes on there may be an extreme degree of muscular\r\nrestlessness, so that the patients wander about until exhausted.\r\nAccording to Osler, who reports a fatal case in a girl who, at her\r\ndeath, only weighed 49 pounds, nothing more pitiable is to be seen in\r\nmedical practice than an advanced case of this malady.  The emaciation\r\nand exhaustion are extreme, and the patient is as miserable as one with\r\ncarcinoma of the esophagus, food either not being taken at all or only\r\nupon urgent compulsion.\r\n\r\nGull mentions a girl of fourteen, of healthy, plump appearance, who in\r\nthe beginning of February, 1887, without apparent cause evinced a great\r\nrepugnance to food and soon afterward declined to take anything but a\r\nhalf cup of tea or coffee. Gull saw her in April, when she was much\r\nemaciated; she persisted in walking through the streets, where she was\r\nthe object of remark of passers-by. At this time her height was five\r\nfeet four inches, her weight 63 pounds, her temperature 97 degrees F.,\r\nher pulse 46, and her respiration from 12 to 14. She had a persistent\r\nwish to be moving all the time, despite her emaciation and the\r\nexhaustion of the nutritive functions.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of abstainers from food exemplified in the\r\nexhibitionists who either for notoriety or for wages demonstrate their\r\nability to forego eating, and sometimes drinking, for long periods.\r\nSome have been clever frauds, who by means of artifices have carried on\r\nskilful deceptions; others have been really interesting physiologic\r\nanomalies.\r\n\r\nOlder Instances.--Democritus in 323 B.C. is said to have lived forty\r\ndays by simply smelling honey and hot bread. Hippocrates remarks that\r\nmost of those who endeavored to abstain five days died within that\r\nperiod, and even if they were prevailed upon to eat and drink before\r\nthe termination of their fast they still perished. There is a\r\npossibility that some of these cases of Hippocrates were instances of\r\npyloric carcinoma or of stenosis of the pylorus. In the older writings\r\nthere are instances reported in which the period of abstinence has\r\nvaried from a short time to endurance beyond the bounds of credulity.\r\nHufeland mentions total abstinence from food for seventeen days, and\r\nthere is a contemporary case of abstinence for forty days in a maniac\r\nwho subsisted solely on water and tobacco. Bolsot speaks of abstinence\r\nfor fourteen months, and Consbruch mentions a girl who fasted eighteen\r\nmonths. Muller mentions an old man of forty-five who lived six weeks on\r\ncold water. There is an instance of a person living in a cave\r\ntwenty-four days without food or drink, and another of a man who\r\nsurvived five weeks' burial under ruins.  Ramazzini speaks of fasting\r\nsixty-six days; Willian, sixty days (resulting in death); von Wocher,\r\nthirty-seven days (associated with tetanus); Lantana, sixty days;\r\nHobbes, forty days; Marcardier, six months; Cruikshank, two months; the\r\nEphemerides, thirteen months; Gerard, sixty-nine days (resulting in\r\ndeath); and in 1722 there was recorded an instance of abstinence\r\nlasting twenty-five months.\r\n\r\nDesbarreaux-Bernard says that Guillaume Granie died in the prison of\r\nToulouse in 1831, after a voluntary suicidal abstinence of sixty-three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHaller cites a number of examples of long abstinence, but most\r\nextraordinary was that of a girl of Confolens, described by Citois of\r\nPoitiers, who published a history of the case in the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. This girl is said to have passed three entire\r\nyears, from eleven to fourteen, without taking any kind of aliment. In\r\nthe \"Harleian Miscellanies\" is a copy of a paper humbly offered to the\r\nRoyal Society by John Reynolds, containing a discourse upon prodigious\r\nabstinence, occasioned by the twelve months' fasting of a woman named\r\nMartha Taylor, a damsel of Derbyshire. Plot gives a great variety of\r\ncurious anecdotes of prolonged abstinence. Ames refers to \"the true and\r\nadmirable history of the maiden of Confolens,\" mentioned by Haller. In\r\nthe Annual Register, vol. i., is an account of three persons who were\r\nburied five weeks in the snow; and in the same journal, in 1762, is the\r\nhistory of a girl who is said to have subsisted nearly four years on\r\nwater. In 1684 four miners were buried in a coal-pit in Horstel, a half\r\nmile from Liege, Belgium, and lived twenty-four days without food,\r\neventually making good recoveries. An analysis of the water used during\r\ntheir confinement showed an almost total absence of organic matter and\r\nonly a slight residue of calcium salts.\r\n\r\nJoanna Crippen lay six days in the snow without nutriment, being\r\novercome by the cold while on the way to her house; she recovered\r\ndespite her exposure. Somis, physician to the King of Sardinia, gives\r\nan account of three women of Piedmont, Italy, who were saved from the\r\nruins of a stable where they had been buried by an avalanche of snow,\r\nMarch 19, 1765. thirty-seven days before.  Thirty houses and 22\r\ninhabitants were buried in this catastrophe, and these three women,\r\ntogether with a child of two, were sheltered in a stable over which the\r\nsnow lodged 42 feet deep.  They were in a manger 20 inches broad and\r\nupheld by a strong arch. Their enforced position was with their backs\r\nto the wall and their knees to their faces. One woman had 15 chestnuts,\r\nand, fortunately, there were two goats near by, and within reach some\r\nhay, sufficient to feed them for a short time. By milking one of the\r\ngoats which had a kid, they obtained about two pints daily, upon which\r\nthey subsisted for a time. They quenched their thirst with melted snow\r\nliquefied by the heat of their hands. Their sufferings were greatly\r\nincreased by the filth, extreme cold, and their uncomfortable\r\npositions; their clothes had rotted. When they were taken out their\r\neyes were unable to endure the light and their stomachs at first\r\nrejected all food.\r\n\r\nWhile returning from Cambridge, February 2, 1799, Elizabeth Woodcock\r\ndismounted from her horse, which ran away, leaving her in a violent\r\nsnowstorm. She was soon overwhelmed by an enormous drift six feet high.\r\nThe sensation of hunger ceased after the first day and that of thirst\r\npredominated, which she quenched by sucking snow. She was discovered on\r\nthe 10th of February, and although suffering from extensive gangrene of\r\nthe toes, she recovered. Hamilton says that at a barracks near Oppido,\r\ncelebrated for its earthquakes, there were rescued two girls, one\r\nsixteen and the other eleven; the former had remained under the ruins\r\nwithout food for eleven days. This poor creature had counted the days\r\nby a light coming through a small opening. The other girl remained six\r\ndays under the ruin in a confined and distressing posture, her hands\r\npressing her cheek until they had almost made a hole in it. Two persons\r\nwere buried under earthquake ruins at Messina for twenty-three and\r\ntwenty-two days each.\r\n\r\nThomas Creaser gives the history of Joseph Lockier of Bath, who, while\r\ngoing through a woods between 6 and 7 P.M., on the 18th of August, was\r\nstruck insensible by a violent thunderbolt. His senses gradually\r\nreturned and he felt excessively cold. His clothes were wet, and his\r\nfeet so swollen that the power of the lower extremities was totally\r\ngone and that of the arms was much impaired. For a long time he was\r\nunable to articulate or to summon assistance. Early in September he\r\nheard some persons in the wood and, having managed to summon them in a\r\nfeeble voice, told them his story. They declared him to be an impostor\r\nand left him. On the evening of the same day his late master came to\r\nhis assistance and removed him to Swan Inn. He affirmed that during his\r\nexposure in the woods he had nothing to eat; though distressing at\r\nfirst, hunger soon subsided and yielded to thirst, which he appeased by\r\nchewing grass having beads of water thereon.  He slept during the\r\nwarmth of the day, but the cold kept him awake at night. During his\r\nsleep he dreamt of eating and drinking. On November 17, 1806, several\r\nsurgeons of Bath made an affidavit, in which they stated that this man\r\nwas admitted to the Bath City Dispensary on September 15th, almost a\r\nmonth after his reputed stroke, in an extremely emaciated condition,\r\nwith his legs and thighs shriveled as well as motionless. There were\r\nseveral livid spots on his legs and one toe was gangrenous. After some\r\ntime they amputated the toe. The power in the lower extremities soon\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nIn relating his travels in the Levant, Hasselquist mentions 1000\r\nAbyssinians who became destitute of provisions while en route to Cairo,\r\nand who lived two months on gum arabic alone, arriving at their\r\ndestination without any unusual sickness or mortality. Dr. Franklin\r\nlived on bread and water for a fortnight, at the rate of ten pounds per\r\nweek, and maintained himself stout and healthy.  Sir John Pringle knew\r\na lady of ninety who lived on pure fat meat. Glower of Chelmsford had a\r\npatient who lived ten years on a pint of tea daily, only now or then\r\nchewing a half dozen raisins or almonds, but not swallowing them. Once\r\nin long intervals she took a little bread.\r\n\r\nBrassavolus describes a younger daughter of Frederick King of Naples\r\nwho lived entirely without meat, and could not endure even the taste of\r\nit, as often as she put any in her mouth she fell fainting. The monks\r\nof Monte Santo (Mount Athos) never touched animal food, but lived on\r\nvegetables, olives, end cheese. In 1806 one of them at the age of one\r\nhundred and twenty was healthy.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the older writings we find records of incredible\r\nabstinence. Jonston speaks of a man in 1460 who, after an unfortunate\r\nmatrimonial experience, lived alone for fifteen years, taking neither\r\nfood nor drink. Petrus Aponensis cites the instance of a girl fasting\r\nfor eight years. According to Jonston, Hermolus lived forty years on\r\nair alone. This same author has also collected cases of abstinence\r\nlasting eleven, twenty-two, and thirty years and cites Aristotle as an\r\nauthority in substantiating his instances of fasting girls.\r\n\r\nWadd, the celebrated authority on corpulence, quotes Pennant in\r\nmentioning a woman in Rosshire who lived one and three-quarters years\r\nwithout meat or drink. Granger had under observation a woman by the\r\nname of Ann Moore, fifty-eight years of age, who fasted for two years.\r\nFabricius Hildanus relates of Apollonia Schreiera that she lived three\r\nyears without meat or drink. He also tells of Eva Flegen, who began to\r\nfast in 1596, and from that time on for sixteen years, lived without\r\nmeat or drink.  According to the Rev. Thos. Steill, Janet Young fasted\r\nsixteen years and partially prolonged her abstinence for fifty years.\r\nThe Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, which contains a mention of\r\nthe foregoing case, also describes the case of Janet Macleod, who\r\nfasted for four years, showing no signs of emaciation.  Benjamin Rush\r\nspeaks of a case mentioned in a letter to St.  George Tucker, from J.\r\nA. Stuart, of a man who, after receiving no benefit from a year's\r\ntreatment for hemiplegia, resolved to starve himself to death. He\r\ntotally abstained from food for sixty days, living on water and chewing\r\napples, but spitting out the pulp; at the expiration of this time he\r\ndied. Eccles relates the history of a beautiful young woman of sixteen,\r\nwho upon the death of a most indulgent father refused food for\r\nthirty-four days, and soon afterward for fifty-four days, losing all\r\nher senses but that of touch.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a French adventurer, the Chevalier de\r\nSaint-Lubin, who had a loathing for food and abstained from every kind\r\nof meat and drink for fifty-eight days. Saint-Sauver, at that time\r\nLieutenant of the Bastille, put a close watch on this man and certified\r\nto the verity of the fast. The European Magazine in 1783 contained an\r\naccount of the Calabria earthquake, at which time a girl of eighteen\r\nwas buried under ruins for six days. The edge of a barrel fell on her\r\nankle and partly separated it, the dust and mortar effectually stopping\r\nthe hemorrhage. The foot dropped off and the wound healed without\r\nmedical assistance, the girl making a complete recovery. There is an\r\naccount taken from a document in the Vatican of a man living in 1306,\r\nin the reign of Pope Clement V, who fasted for two years. McNaughton\r\nmentions Rubin Kelsey, a medical student afflicted with melancholia,\r\nwho voluntarily fasted for fifty-three days, drinking copiously and\r\ngreedily of water. For the first six weeks he walked about, and was\r\nstrong to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nHammond has proved many of the reports of \"fasting girls\" to have been\r\nuntrustworthy. The case of Miss Faucher of Brooklyn, who was supposed\r\nto have taken no food for fourteen years, was fraudulent. He says that\r\nAnn Moore was fed by her daughter in several ways; when washing her\r\nmother's face she used towels wet with gravy, milk, or strong\r\narrow-root meal. She also conveyed food to her mother by means of\r\nkisses. One of the \"fasting girls,\" Margaret Weiss, although only ten\r\nyears old, had such powers of deception that after being watched by the\r\npriest of the parish, Dr. Bucoldianus, she was considered free from\r\njuggling, and, to everybody's astonishment, she grew, walked, and\r\ntalked like other children of her age, still maintaining that she used\r\nneither food nor drink. In several other cases reported all attempts to\r\ndiscover imposture failed. As we approach more modern times the\r\ndetection is more frequent. Sarah Jacobs, the Welsh fasting girl who\r\nattained such celebrity among the laity, was taken to Guy's Hospital on\r\nDecember 9, 1869, and after being watched by eight experienced nurses\r\nfor eight days she died of starvation. A postmortem examination of Anna\r\nGarbero of Racconis, in Piedmont, who died on May 19, 1828, after\r\nhaving endured a supposed fast of two years, eight months, and eleven\r\ndays, revealed remarkable intestinal changes. The serous membranes were\r\nall callous and thickened, and the canal of the sigmoid flexure was\r\ntotally obliterated. The mucous membranes were all soft and friable,\r\nand presented the appearance of incipient gangrene.\r\n\r\nModern Cases.--Turning now to modern literature, we have cases of\r\nmarvelous abstinence well substantiated by authoritative evidence.\r\nDickson describes a man of sixty-two, suffering from monomania, who\r\nrefused food for four months, but made a successful recovery.\r\nRichardson mentions a case, happening in 1848, of a man of thirty-three\r\nwho voluntarily fasted for fifty-five days. His reason for fasting,\r\nwhich it was impossible to combat, was that he had no gastric juice and\r\nthat it was utterly useless for him to take any nutrition, as he had no\r\nmeans of digesting it. He lived on water until the day of his death.\r\nRichardson gives an interesting account of the changes noticed at the\r\nnecropsy. There is an account of a religious mendicant of the Jain\r\ncaste who as a means of penance fasted for ninety-one days.  The\r\nprevious year he had fasted eighty-six days. He had spent his life in\r\nstrict asceticism, and during his fasting he was always engrossed in\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nCollins describes a maiden lady of eighty, always a moderate eater, who\r\nwas attacked by bronchitis, during which she took food as usual. Two\r\ndays after her recovery, without any known cause, she refused all food\r\nand continued to do so for thirty-three days, when she died. She was\r\ndelirious throughout this fast and slept daily seven or eight hours. As\r\na rule, she drank about a wineglassful of water each day and her urine\r\nwas scanty and almost of the consistency of her feces. There is a\r\nremarkable case of a girl of seventeen who, suffering with typhoid\r\nfever associated with engorgement of the abdomen and suppression of the\r\nfunctions of assimilation, fasted for four months without visible\r\ndiminution in weight. Pierce reports the history of a woman of\r\ntwenty-six who fasted for three months and made an excellent recovery.\r\n\r\nGrant describes the \"Market Harborough fasting-girl,\" a maiden of\r\nnineteen, who abstained from food from April, 1874, until December,\r\n1877, although continually using morphia. Throughout her fast she had\r\nperiodic convulsions, and voided no urine or feces for twelve months\r\nbefore her death. There was a middle-aged woman in England in 1860 who\r\nfor two years lived on opium, gin, and water. Her chief symptoms were\r\nalmost daily sickness and epileptic fits three times a week. She was\r\nabsolutely constipated, and at her death her abdomen was so distended\r\nas to present the appearance of ascites. After death, the distention of\r\nthe abdomen was found to be due to a coating of fat, four inches thick,\r\nin the parietes. There was no obstruction to the intestinal canal and\r\nno fecal or other accumulation within it.  Christina Marshall, a girl\r\nof fourteen, went fifteen and one-half months without taking solid\r\nnourishment. She slept very little, seldom spoke, but occasionally\r\nasked the time of day. She took sweets and water, with beef tea at\r\nintervals, and occasionally a small piece of orange. She died April 18,\r\n1882, after having been confined to her bed for a long while.\r\n\r\nKing, a surgeon, U.S.A., gives an account of the deprivation of a squad\r\nof cavalry numbering 40. While scouting for Indians on the plains they\r\nwent for eighty-six hours without water; when relieved their mouths and\r\nthroats were so dry that even brown sugar would not dissolve on their\r\ntongues. Many were delirious, and all had drawn fresh blood from their\r\nhorses. Despite repeated vomiting, some drank their own urine. They\r\nwere nearly all suffering from overpowering dyspnea, two were dead, and\r\ntwo were missing. The suffering was increased by the acrid atmosphere\r\nof the dry plains; the slightest exercise in this climate provoked a\r\nthirst. MacLoughlin, the surgeon in charge of the S.S. City of Chester,\r\nspeaks of a young stowaway found by the stevedores in an insensible\r\ncondition after a voyage of eleven days. The man was brought on deck\r\nand revived sufficiently to be sent to St.  Vincent's Hospital, N.Y.,\r\nabout one and one-half hours after discovery, in an extremely\r\nemaciated, cold, and nearly pulseless condition. He gave his name as\r\nJohn Donnelly, aged twenty, of Dumbarton, Scotland. On the whole voyage\r\nhe had nothing to eat or drink. He had found some salt, of which he ate\r\ntwo handfuls, and he had in his pocket a small flask, empty. Into this\r\nflask he voided his urine, and afterward drank it. Until the second day\r\nhe was intensely hungry, but after that time was consumed by a burning\r\nthirst; he shouted four or five hours every day, hoping that he might\r\nbe heard. After this he became insensible and remembered nothing until\r\nhe awakened in the hospital where, under careful treatment, he finally\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nFodere mentions some workmen who were buried alive fourteen days in a\r\ncold, damp cavern under a ruin, and yet all lived. There is a modern\r\ninstance of a person being buried thirty-two days beneath snow, without\r\nfood. The Lancet notes that a pig fell off Dover Cliff and was picked\r\nup alive one hundred and sixty days after, having been partially\r\nimbedded in debris. It was so surrounded by the chalk of the cliff that\r\nlittle motion was possible, and warmth was secured by the enclosing\r\nmaterial. This animal had therefore lived on its own fat during the\r\nentire period.\r\n\r\nAmong the modern exhibitionists may be mentioned Merlatti, the fasting\r\nItalian, and Succi, both of whom fasted in Paris; Alexander Jacques,\r\nwho fasted fifty days; and the American, Dr. Tanner, who achieved great\r\nnotoriety by a fast of forty days, during which time he exhibited\r\nprogressive emaciation. Merlatti, who fasted in Paris in 1886, lost 22\r\npounds in a month; during his fast of fifty days he drank only pure\r\nfiltered water. Prior to the fast his farewell meal consisted of a\r\nwhole fat goose, including the bones, two pounds of roast beef,\r\nvegetables for two, and a plate of walnuts, the latter eaten whole.\r\nAlexander Jacques fasted fifty days and Succi fasted forty days.\r\nJacques lost 28 pounds and 4 ounces (from 142 pounds, 8 ounces to 114\r\npounds, 4 ounces), while Succi's loss was 34 pounds and 3 ounces.\r\nSucci diminished in height from 65 3/4 to 64 1/2 inches, while Jacques\r\nincreased from 64 1/2 to 65 1/2 inches. Jacques smoked cigarettes\r\nincessantly, using 700 in the fifty days, although, by professional\r\nadvice, he stopped the habit on the forty-second day. Three or four\r\ntimes a day he took a powder made of herbs to which he naturally\r\nattributed his power of prolonging life without food. Succi remained in\r\na room in which he kept the temperature at a very high point. In\r\nspeaking of Succi's latest feat a recent report says: \"It has come to\r\nlight in his latest attempt to go for fifty days without food that he\r\nprivately regaled himself on soup, beefsteak, chocolate, and eggs. It\r\nwas also discovered that one of the 'committee,' who were supposed to\r\nwatch and see that the experiment was conducted in a bona fide manner,\r\n'stood in' with the faster and helped him deceive the others. The\r\nresult of the Vienna experiment is bound to cast suspicion on all\r\nprevious fasting accomplishments of Signor Succi, if not upon those of\r\nhis predecessors.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough all these modern fasters have been accused of being jugglers\r\nand deceivers, throughout their fasts they showed constant decrease in\r\nweight, and inspection by visitors was welcomed at all times. They\r\ninvariably invited medical attention, and some were under the closest\r\nsurveillance; although we may not implicitly believe that the fasts\r\nwere in every respect bona fide, yet we must acknowledge that these men\r\ndisplayed great endurance in their apparent indifference for food, the\r\ndeprivation of which in a normal individual for one day only causes\r\nintense suffering.\r\n\r\nAnomalies of Temperature.--In reviewing the reports of the highest\r\nrecorded temperatures of the human body, it must be remembered that no\r\nmatter how good the evidence or how authentic the reference there is\r\nalways chance for malingering. It is possible to send the index of an\r\nordinary thermometer up to the top in ten or fifteen seconds by rubbing\r\nit between the slightly moistened thumb and the finger, exerting\r\nconsiderable pressure at the time. There are several other means of\r\nartificially producing enormous temperatures with little risk of\r\ndetection, and as the sensitiveness of the thermometer becomes greater\r\nthe easier is the deception.\r\n\r\nMackenzie reports the temperature-range of a woman of forty-two who\r\nsuffered with erysipelatous inflammation of a stump of the leg.\r\nThroughout a somewhat protracted illness, lasting from February 20 to\r\nApril 22, 1879, the temperature many times registered between 108\r\ndegrees and 111 degrees F. About a year later she was again troubled\r\nwith the stump, and this time the temperature reached as high as 114\r\ndegrees. Although under the circumstances, as any rational physician\r\nwould, Mackenzie suspected fraud, he could not detect any method of\r\ndeception.  Finally the woman confessed that she had produced the\r\ntemperature artificially by means of hot-water bottles, poultices, etc.\r\n\r\nMacNab records a case of rheumatic fever in which the temperature was\r\n111.4 degrees F. as indicated by two thermometers, one in the axilla\r\nand the other in the groin. This high degree of temperature was\r\nmaintained after death. Before the Clinical Society of London, Teale\r\nreported a case in which, at different times, there were recorded\r\ntemperatures from 110 degrees to 120 degrees F. in the mouth, rectum,\r\nand axilla. According to a comment in the Lancet, there was no way that\r\nthe patient could have artificially produced this temperature, and\r\nduring convalescence the thermometer used registered normal as well as\r\nsubnormal temperatures. Caesar speaks of a girl of fifteen with enteric\r\nfever, whose temperature, on two occasions 110 degrees F., reached the\r\nlimit of the mercury in the thermometer.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances mentioned in which, in order to escape\r\nduties, prisoners have artificially produced high temperatures, and the\r\nsame has occasionally been observed among conscripts in the army or\r\nnavy. There is an account of a habit of prisoners of introducing\r\ntobacco into the rectum, thereby reducing the pulse to an alarming\r\ndegree and insuring their exemption from labor. In the Adelaide\r\nHospital in Dublin there was a case in which the temperature in the\r\nvagina and groin registered from 120 degrees to 130 degrees, and one\r\nday it reached 130.8 degrees F.; the patient recovered. Ormerod\r\nmentions a nervous and hysteric woman of thirty-two, a sufferer with\r\nacute rheumatism, whose temperature rose to 115.8 degrees F. She\r\ninsisted on leaving the hospital when her temperature was still 104\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nWunderlich mentions a case of tetanus in which the temperature rose to\r\n46.40 degrees C. (115.5 degrees F.), and before death it was as high as\r\n44.75 degrees C. Obernier mentions 108 degrees F.  in typhoid fever.\r\nKartulus speaks of a child of five, with typhoid fever, who at\r\ndifferent times had temperatures of 107 degrees, 108 degrees, and 108.2\r\ndegrees F.; it finally recovered.  He also quotes a case of pyemia in a\r\nboy of seven, whose temperature rose to 107.6 degrees F. He also speaks\r\nof Wunderlich's case of remittent fever, in which the temperature\r\nreached 107.8 degrees F. Wilson Fox, in mentioning a case of rheumatic\r\nfever, says the temperature reached 110 degrees F.\r\n\r\nPhilipson gives an account of a female servant of twenty-three who\r\nsuffered from a neurosis which influenced the vasomotor nervous system,\r\nand caused hysteria associated with abnormal temperatures. On the\r\nevening of July 9th her temperature was 112 degrees F.; on the 16th, it\r\nwas 111 degrees; on the 18th, 112 degrees; on the 24th, 117 degrees\r\n(axilla); on the 28th, in the left axilla it was 117 degrees, in the\r\nright axilla, 114 degrees, and in the mouth, 112 degrees; on the 29th,\r\nit was 115 degrees in the right axilla, 110 degrees in the left axilla,\r\nand 116 degrees in the mouth The patient was discharged the following\r\nSeptember.  Steel of Manchester speaks of a hysteric female of twenty,\r\nwhose temperature was 116.4 degrees. Mahomed mentions a hysteric woman\r\nof twenty-two at Guy's Hospital, London, with phthisis of the left\r\nlung, associated with marked hectic fevers. Having registered the limit\r\nof the ordinary thermometers, the physicians procured one with a scale\r\nreaching to 130 degrees F. She objected to using the large\r\nthermometers, saying they were \"horse thermometers.\" On October 15,\r\n1879, however, they succeeded in obtaining a temperature of 128 degrees\r\nF. with the large thermometer. In March of the following year she died,\r\nand the necropsy revealed nothing indicative of a cause for these\r\nenormous temperatures. She was suspected of fraud, and was closely\r\nwatched in Guy's Hospital, but never, in the slightest way, was she\r\ndetected in using artificial means to elevate the temperature record.\r\n\r\nIn cases of insolation it is not at all unusual to see a patient whose\r\ntemperature cannot be registered by an ordinary thermometer. Any one\r\nwho has been resident at a hospital in which heat-cases are received in\r\nthe summer will substantiate this. At the Emergency Hospital in\r\nWashington, during recent years, several cases have been brought in\r\nwhich the temperatures were above the ordinary registering point of the\r\nhospital thermometers, and one of the most extraordinary cases\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Association of American Physicians in 1895, Jacobi\r\nof New York reported a case of hyperthermy reaching 148 degrees F. This\r\ninstance occurred in a profoundly hysteric fireman, who suffered a\r\nrather severe injury as the result of a fall between the revolving rods\r\nof some machinery, and was rendered unconscious for four days.\r\nThereafter he complained of various pains, bloody expectoration, and\r\nhad convulsions at varying intervals, with loss of consciousness, rapid\r\nrespiration, unaccelerated pulse, and excessively high temperature, the\r\nlast on one occasion reaching the height of 148 degrees F. The\r\ntemperature was taken carefully in the presence of a number of persons,\r\nand all possible precautions were observed to prevent deception. The\r\nthermometer was variously placed in the mouth, anus, axilla, popliteal\r\nspace, groin, urethra, and different instruments were from time to time\r\nemployed. The behavior of the patient was much influenced by attention\r\nand by suggestion. For a period of five days the temperature averaged\r\ncontinuously between 120 degrees and 125 degrees F.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the foregoing case, Welch of Baltimore referred to\r\na case that had been reported in which it was said that the temperature\r\nreached as high as 171 degrees F. These extraordinary elevations of\r\ntemperature, he said, appear physically impossible when they are long\r\ncontinued, as they are fatal to the life of the animal cell.\r\n\r\nIn the same connection Shattuck of Boston added that he had observed a\r\ntemperature of 117 degrees F.; every precaution had been taken to\r\nprevent fraud or deception. The patient was a hysteric young woman.\r\n\r\nJacobi closed the discussion by insisting that his observations had\r\nbeen made with the greatest care and precautions and under many\r\ndifferent circumstances. He had at first viewed the case with\r\nskepticism, but he could not doubt the results of his observation. He\r\nadded, that although we cannot explain anomalies of this kind, this\r\nconstitutes no reason why we should deny their occurrence.\r\n\r\nDuffy records one of the lowest temperatures on record in a negress of\r\nthirty-five who, after an abortion, showed only 84 degrees F. in the\r\nmouth and axillae. She died the next day.\r\n\r\nThe amount of external heat that a human being can endure is sometimes\r\nremarkable, and the range of temperature compatible with life is none\r\nthe less extraordinary. The Esquimaux and the inhabitants of the\r\nextreme north at times endure a temperature of--60 degrees F., while\r\nsome of the people living in equatorial regions are apparently healthy\r\nat a temperature as high as 130 degrees F., and work in the sun, where\r\nthe temperature is far higher. In the engine-rooms of some steamers\r\nplying in tropical waters temperatures as high as 150 degrees F. have\r\nbeen registered, yet the engineers and the stokers become habituated to\r\nthis heat and labor in it without apparent suffering. In Turkish baths,\r\nby progressively exposing themselves to graduated temperatures, persons\r\nhave been able to endure a heat considerably above the boiling point,\r\nthough having to protect their persons from the furniture and floors\r\nand walls of the rooms. The hot air in these rooms is intensely dry,\r\nprovoking profuse perspiration. Sir Joseph Banks remained some time in\r\na room the temperature of which was 211 degrees F., and his own\r\ntemperature never mounted above normal.\r\n\r\nThere have been exhibitionists who claimed particular ability to endure\r\nintense heats without any visible disadvantage. These men are generally\r\nstyled \"human salamanders,\" and must not be confounded with the\r\n\"fire-eaters,\" who, as a rule, are simply jugglers. Martinez, the\r\nso-called \"French Salamander,\" was born in Havana. As a baker he had\r\nexposed himself from boyhood to very high temperatures, and he\r\nsubsequently gave public exhibitions of his extraordinary ability to\r\nendure heat. He remained in an oven erected in the middle of the\r\nGardens of Tivoli for fourteen minutes when the temperature in the oven\r\nwas 338 degrees F. His pulse on entering was 76 and on coming out 130.\r\nHe often duplicated this feat before vast assemblages, though hardly\r\never attaining the same degree of temperature, the thermometer\r\ngenerally varying from 250 degrees F. upward. Chamouni was the\r\ncelebrated \"Russian Salamander,\" assuming the title of \"The\r\nIncombustible.\" His great feat was to enter an oven with a raw leg of\r\nmutton, not retiring until the meat was well baked. This person\r\neventually lost his life in the performance of this feat; his ashes\r\nwere conveyed to his native town, where a monument was erected over\r\nthem. Since the time of these two contemporaneous salamanders there\r\nhave been many others, but probably none have attained the same\r\nnotoriety.\r\n\r\nIn this connection Tillet speaks of some servant girls to a baker who\r\nfor fifteen minutes supported a temperature of 270 degrees F.; for ten\r\nminutes, 279 degrees F.; and for several minutes, 364 degrees F., thus\r\nsurpassing Martinez. In the Glasgow Medical Journal, 1859, there is an\r\naccount of a baker's daughter who remained twelve minutes in an oven at\r\n274 degrees F. Chantrey, the sculptor, and his workman are said to have\r\nentered with impunity a furnace of over 320 degrees F.\r\n\r\nIn some of the savage ceremonies of fire worship the degree of heat\r\nendured by the participants is really remarkable, and even if the rites\r\nare performed by skilful juggling, nevertheless, the ability to endure\r\nintense heat is worthy of comment. A recent report says:--\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable ceremonial of fire worship that survives in this\r\ncountry is practiced by the Navajos. They believe in purification by\r\nfire, and to this end they literally wash themselves in it. The feats\r\nthey perform with it far exceed the most wonderful acts of fire-eating\r\nand fire-handling accomplished by civilized jugglers. In preparation\r\nfor the festival a gigantic heap of dry wood is gathered from the\r\ndesert. At the appointed moment the great pile of inflammable brush is\r\nlighted and in a few moments the whole of it is ablaze. Storms of\r\nsparks fly 100 feet or more into the air, and ashes fall about like a\r\nshower of snow. The ceremony always takes place at night and the effect\r\nof it is both weird and impressive.\r\n\r\n\"Just when the fire is raging at its hottest a whistle is heard from\r\nthe outer darkness and a dozen warriors, lithe and lean, dressed simply\r\nin narrow white breech-cloths and moccasins and daubed with white earth\r\nso as to look like so many living statues, come bounding through the\r\nentrance to the corral that incloses the flaming heap. Yelping like\r\nwolves, they move slowly toward the fire, bearing aloft slender wands\r\ntipped with balls of eagle-down. Rushing around the fire, always to the\r\nleft, they begin thrusting their wands toward the fire, trying to burn\r\noff the down from the tips. Owing to the intensity of the heat this is\r\ndifficult to accomplish. One warrior dashes wildly toward the fire and\r\nretreats; another lies as close to the ground as a frightened lizard,\r\nendeavoring to wriggle himself up to the fire; others seek to catch on\r\ntheir wands the sparks that fly in the air. At last one by one they all\r\nsucceed in burning the downy balls from the wands. The test of\r\nendurance is very severe, the heat of the fire being so great.\r\n\r\n\"The remarkable feats, however, are performed in connection with\r\nanother dance that follows. This is heralded by a tremendous blowing of\r\nhorns. The noise grows louder and louder until suddenly ten or more men\r\nrun into the corral, each of them carrying two thick bundles of\r\nshredded cedar bark.\r\n\r\n\"Four times they run around the fire waving the bundles, which are then\r\nlighted. Now begins a wild race around the fire, the rapid running\r\ncausing the brands to throw out long streamers of flames over the hands\r\nand arms of the dancers. The latter apply the brands to their own nude\r\nbodies and to the bodies of their comrades in front. A warrior will\r\nseize the flaming mass as if it were a sponge, and, keeping close to\r\nthe man he is pursuing, will rub his back with it as if bathing him.\r\nThe sufferer in turn catches up with the man in front of him and bathes\r\nhim in flame.  From time to time the dancers sponge their own backs\r\nwith the flaming brands. When a brand is so far consumed that it can no\r\nlonger be held it is dropped and the dancers disappear from the corral.\r\nThe spectators pick up the flaming bunches thus dropped and bathe their\r\nown hands in the fire.\r\n\r\n\"No satisfactory explanation seems to be obtainable as to the means by\r\nwhich the dancers in this extraordinary performance are able to escape\r\ninjury. Apparently they do not suffer from any burns. Doubtless some\r\nprotection is afforded by the earth that is applied to their bodies.\"\r\n\r\nSpontaneous combustion of the human body, although doubted by the\r\nmedical men of this day, has for many years been the subject of much\r\ndiscussion; only a few years ago, among the writers on this subject,\r\nthere were as many credulous as there were skeptics.  There is,\r\nhowever, no reliable evidence to support the belief in the spontaneous\r\ncombustion of the body. A few apochryphal cases only have been\r\nrecorded. The opinion that the tissues of drunkards might be so\r\nsaturated with alcohol as to render the body combustible is disproved\r\nby the simple experiment of placing flesh in spirits for a long time\r\nand then trying to burn it.  Liebig and others found that flesh soaked\r\nin alcohol would burn only until the alcohol was consumed. That various\r\nsubstances ignite spontaneously is explained by chemic phenomena, the\r\nconditions of which do not exist in the human frame. Watkins in\r\nspeaking of the inflammability of the human body remarks that on one\r\noccasion he tried to consume the body of a pirate given to him by a U.\r\nS. Marshal. He built a rousing fire and piled wood on all night, and\r\nhad not got the body consumed by the forenoon of the following day.\r\nQuite a feasible reason for supposed spontaneous human combustion is to\r\nbe found in several cases quoted by Taylor, in which persons falling\r\nasleep, possibly near a fire, have been accidentally ignited, and\r\nbecoming first stupefied by the smoke, and then suffocated, have been\r\nburned to charcoal without awaking. Drunkenness or great exhaustion may\r\nalso explain certain cases. In substantiation of the possibility of\r\nTaylor's instances several prominent physiologists have remarked that\r\npersons have endured severe burns during sleep and have never wakened.\r\nThere is an account of a man who lay down on the top of a lime kiln,\r\nwhich was fired during his sleep, and one leg was burned entirely off\r\nwithout awaking the man, a fact explained by the very slow and gradual\r\nincrease of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe theories advanced by the advocates of spontaneous human combustion\r\nare very ingenious and deserve mention here. An old authority has said:\r\n\"Our blood is of such a nature, as also our lymph and bile: all of\r\nwhich, when dried by art, flame like spirit of wine at the approach of\r\nthe least fire and burn away to ashes.\" Lord Bacon mentions spontaneous\r\ncombustion, and Marcellus Donatus says that in the time of Godefroy of\r\nBouillon there were people of a certain locality who supposed\r\nthemselves to have been burning of an invisible fire in their entrails,\r\nand he adds that some cut off a hand or a foot when the burning began,\r\nthat it should go no further. What may have been the malady with which\r\nthese people suffered must be a matter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nOverton, in a paper on this subject, remarks that in the \"Memoirs of\r\nthe Royal Society of Paris,\" 1751, there is related an account of a\r\nbutcher who, opening a diseased beef, was burned by a flame which\r\nissued from the maw of the animal; there was first an explosion which\r\nrose to a height of five feet and continued to blaze several minutes\r\nwith a highly offensive odor. Morton saw a flame emanate from beneath\r\nthe skin of a hog at the instant of making an incision through it.\r\nRuysch, the famous Dutch physician, remarks that he introduced a hollow\r\nbougie into a woman's stomach he had just opened, and he observed a\r\nvapor issuing from the mouth of the tube, and this lit on contact with\r\nthe atmosphere. This is probably an exaggeration of the properties of\r\nthe hydrogen sulphid found in the stomach. There is an account of a man\r\nof forty-three, a gross feeder, who was particularly fond of fats and a\r\nvictim of psoriasis palmaria, who on going to bed one night, after\r\nextinguishing the light in the room, was surprised to find himself\r\nenveloped in a phosphorescent halo; this continued for several days and\r\nrecurred after further indiscretions in diet. It is well known that\r\nthere are insects and other creatures of the lower animal kingdom which\r\npossess the peculiar quality of phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous cases of spontaneous combustion of the human body\r\nreported by the older writers. Bartholinus mentions an instance after\r\nthe person had drunk too much wine. Fouquet mentions a person ignited\r\nby lightning. Schrader speaks of a person from whose mouth and fauces\r\nafter a debauch issued fire.  Schurig tells of flames issuing from the\r\nvulva, and Moscati records the same occurrence in parturition,\r\nSinibaldust, Borellus, and Bierling have also written on this subject,\r\nand the Ephemerides contains a number of instances.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 Bianchini, Prebendary of Verona, published an account of the\r\ndeath of Countess Cornelia Bandi of Cesena, who in her sixty-second\r\nyear was consumed by a fire kindled in her own body.  In explanation\r\nBianchini said that the fire was caused in the entrails by the inflamed\r\neffluvia of the blood, by the juices and fermentation in the stomach,\r\nand, lastly, by fiery evaporations which exhaled from the spirits of\r\nwine, brandy, etc. In the Gentleman's Magazine, 1763, there is recorded\r\nan account of three noblemen who, in emulation, drank great quantities\r\nof strong liquor, and two of them died scorched and suffocated by a\r\nflame forcing itself from the stomach. There is an account of a poor\r\nwoman in Paris in the last century who drank plentifully of spirits,\r\nfor three years taking virtually nothing else. Her body became so\r\ncombustible that one night while lying on a straw couch she was\r\nspontaneously burned to ashes and smoke. The evident cause of this\r\ncombustion is too plain to be commented on. In the Lancet, 1845, there\r\nare two cases reported in which shortly before death luminous breath\r\nhas been seen to issue from the mouth.\r\n\r\nThere is an instance reported of a professor of mathematics of\r\nthirty-five years of age and temperate, who, feeling a pain in his left\r\nleg, discovered a pale flame about the size of a ten-cent piece issuing\r\ntherefrom. As recent as March, 1850, in a Court of Assizes in Darmstadt\r\nduring the trial of John Stauff, accused of the murder of the Countess\r\nGoerlitz, the counsel for the defense advanced the theory of\r\nspontaneous human combustion, and such eminent doctors as von Siebold,\r\nGraff, von Liebig, and other prominent members of the Hessian medical\r\nfraternity were called to comment on its possibility; principally on\r\ntheir testimony a conviction and life-imprisonment was secured. In 1870\r\nthere was a woman of thirty-seven, addicted to alcoholic liquors, who\r\nwas found in her room with her viscera and part of her limbs consumed\r\nby fire, but the hair and clothes intact. According to Walford, in the\r\nScientific American for 1870, there was a case reported by Flowers of\r\nLouisiana of a man a hard drinker, who was sitting by a fire surrounded\r\nby his Christmas guests, when suddenly flames of a bluish tint burst\r\nfrom his mouth and nostrils and he was soon a corpse. Flowers states\r\nthat the body remained extremely warm for a much longer period than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nStatistics.--From an examination of 28 cases of spontaneous combustion,\r\nJacobs makes the following summary:--\r\n\r\n(1) It has always occurred in the human living body.\r\n\r\n(2) The subjects were generally old persons.\r\n\r\n(3) It was noticed more frequently in women than in men.\r\n\r\n(4) All the persons were alone at the time of occurrence.\r\n\r\n(5) They all led an idle life.\r\n\r\n(6) They were all corpulent or intemperate.\r\n\r\n(7) Most frequently at the time of occurrence there was a light and\r\nsome ignitible substance in the room.\r\n\r\n(8) The combustion was rapid and was finished in from one to seven\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n(9) The room where the combustion took place was generally filled with\r\na thick vapor and the walls covered with a thick, carbonaceous\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n(10) The trunk was usually the part most frequently destroyed; some\r\npart of the head and extremities remained.\r\n\r\n(11) With but two exceptions, the combustion occurred in winter and in\r\nthe northern regions.\r\n\r\nMagnetic, Phosphorescent, and Electric Anomalies.--There have been\r\ncertain persons who have appeared before the public under such names as\r\nthe \"human magnet,\" the \"electric lady,\" etc. There is no doubt that\r\nsome persons are supercharged with magnetism and electricity. For\r\ninstance, it is quite possible for many persons by drawing a rubber\r\ncomb through the hair to produce a crackling noise, and even produce\r\nsparks in the dark. Some exhibitionists have been genuine curiosities\r\nof this sort, while others by skilfully arranged electric apparatus are\r\nenabled to perform their feats. A curious case was reported in this\r\ncountry many years ago, which apparently emanates from an authoritative\r\nsource. On the 25th of January, 1837, a certain lady became suddenly\r\nand unconsciously charged with electricity. Her newly acquired power\r\nwas first exhibited when passing her hand over the face of her brother;\r\nto the astonishment of both, vivid electric sparks passed from the ends\r\nof each finger. This power continued with augmented force from the 25th\r\nof January to the last of February, but finally became extinct about\r\nthe middle of May of the same year.\r\n\r\nSchneider mentions a strong, healthy, dark-haired Capuchin monk, the\r\nremoval of whose head-dress always induced a number of shining,\r\ncrackling sparks from his hair or scalp. Bartholinus observed a similar\r\npeculiarity in Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. In another case luminous sparks\r\nwere given out whenever the patient passed urine. Marsh relates two\r\ncases of phthisis in which the heads of the patients were surrounded by\r\nphosphorescent lights.  Kaster mentions an instance in which light was\r\nseen in the perspiration and on the body linen after violent exertion.\r\nAfter exertion Jurine, Guyton, and Driessen observed luminous urine\r\npassed by healthy persons, and Nasse mentions the same phenomenon in a\r\nphthisical patient. Percy and Stokes have observed phosphorescence in a\r\ncarcinomatous ulcer.\r\n\r\nThere is a description of a Zulu boy exhibited in Edinburgh in 1882\r\nwhose body was so charged with electricity that he could impart a shock\r\nto any of his patrons. He was about six-and-a-half years of age,\r\nbright, happy, and spoke English thoroughly well.  From infancy he had\r\nbeen distinguished for this faculty, variable with the state of the\r\natmosphere. As a rule, the act of shaking hands was generally attended\r\nby a quivering sensation like that produced by an electric current, and\r\ncontact with his tongue gave a still sharper shock.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Bell has made extensive investigation of the subject of\r\nhuman magnetism and is probably the best authority on the subject, but\r\nmany celebrated scientists have studied it thoroughly. In the Pittsburg\r\nMedical Review there is a description of a girl of three and a half, a\r\nblonde, and extremely womanly for her age, who possessed a wonderful\r\nmagnetic power. Metal spoons would adhere to her finger-tips, nose, or\r\nchin. The child, however, could not pick up a steel needle, an article\r\ngenerally very sensitive to the magnet; nor would a penny stick to any\r\nportion of her body.\r\n\r\nOnly recently there was exhibited through this country a woman named\r\nAnnie May Abbott, who styled herself the \"Georgia Electric Lady.\" This\r\nperson gave exhibitions of wonderful magnetic power, and invited the\r\ninspection and discussion of medical men. Besides her chief\r\naccomplishment she possessed wonderful strength and was a skilled\r\nequilibrist. By placing her hands on the sides of a chair upon which a\r\nheavy man was seated, she would raise it without apparent effort. She\r\ndefied the strongest person in the audience to take from her hand a\r\nstick which she had once grasped. Recent reports say that Miss Abbott\r\nis amusing herself now with the strong men of China and Japan. The\r\nJapanese wrestlers, whose physical strength is celebrated the world\r\nover, were unable to raise Miss Abbott from the floor, while with the\r\ntips of her fingers she neutralized their most strenuous efforts to\r\nlift even light objects, such as a cane, from a table. The\r\npossibilities, in this advanced era of electric mechanism, make fraud\r\nand deception so easy that it is extremely difficult to pronounce on\r\nthe genuineness of any of the modern exhibitions of human electricity.\r\n\r\nThe Effects of Cold.--Gmelin, the famous scientist and investigator of\r\nthis subject, says that man has lived where the temperature falls as\r\nlow as -157 degrees F. Habit is a marked factor in this endurance. In\r\nRussia men and women work with their breasts and arms uncovered in a\r\ntemperature many degrees below zero and without attention to the fact.\r\nIn the most rigorous winter the inhabitants of the Alps work with bare\r\nbreasts and the children sport about in the snow. Wrapping himself in\r\nhis pelisse the Russian sleeps in the snow. This influence of habit is\r\nseen in the inability of intruders in northern lands to endure the\r\ncold, which has no effect on the indigenous people. On their way to\r\nbesiege a Norwegian stronghold in 1719, 7000 Swedes perished in the\r\nsnows and cold of their neighboring country. On the retreat from Prague\r\nin 1742, the French army, under the rigorous sky of Bohemia, lost 4000\r\nmen in ten days. It is needless to speak of the thousands lost in\r\nNapoleon's campaign in Russia in 1812.\r\n\r\nPinel has remarked that the insane are less liable to the effects of\r\ncold than their normal fellows, and mentions the escape of a naked\r\nmaniac, who, without any visible after-effect, in January, even, when\r\nthe temperature was -4 degrees F., ran into the snow and gleefully\r\nrubbed his body with ice. In the French journals in 1814 there is the\r\nrecord of the rescue of a naked crazy woman who was found in the\r\nPyrenees, and who had apparently suffered none of the ordinary effects\r\nof cold.\r\n\r\nPsychologic Effects of Cold.--Lambert says that the mind acts more\r\nquickly in cold weather, and that there has been a notion advanced that\r\nthe emotion of hatred is much stronger in cold weather, a theory\r\nexemplified by the assassination of Paul of Russia, the execution of\r\nCharles of England, and that of Louis of France. Emotions, such as\r\nlove, bravery, patriotism, etc., together with diverse forms of\r\nexcitement, seem to augment the ability of the human body to endure\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nCold seems to have little effect on the generative function. In both\r\nSweden, Norway, and other Northern countries the families are as large,\r\nif not larger, than in other countries. Cold undoubtedly imparts vigor,\r\nand, according to DeThou, Henry III lost his effeminacy and love of\r\npleasure in winter and reacquired a spirit of progress and reformation.\r\nZimmerman has remarked that in a rigorous winter the lubberly Hollander\r\nis like the gayest Frenchman. Cold increases appetite, and Plutarch\r\nsays Brutus experienced intense bulimia while in the mountains, barely\r\nescaping perishing. With full rations the Greek soldiers under Xenophon\r\nsuffered intense hunger as they traversed the snow-clad mountains of\r\nArmenia.\r\n\r\nBeaupre remarks that those who have the misfortune to be buried under\r\nthe snow perish less quickly than those who are exposed to the open\r\nair, his observations having been made during the retreat of the French\r\narmy from Moscow. In Russia it is curious to see fish frozen stiff,\r\nwhich, after transportation for great distances, return to life when\r\nplunged into cold water.\r\n\r\nSudden death from cold baths and cold drinks has been known for many\r\ncenturies. Mauriceau mentions death from cold baptism on the head, and\r\nGraseccus, Scaliger, Rush, Schenck, and Velschius mention deaths from\r\ncold drinks. Aventii, Fabricius Hildanus, the Ephemerides, and Curry\r\nrelate instances of a fatal issue following the ingestion of cold water\r\nby an individual in a superheated condition. Cridland describes a case\r\nof sudden insensibility following the drinking of a cold fluid. It is\r\nsaid that Alexander the Great narrowly escaped death from a\r\nconstrictive spasm, due to the fact that while in a copious sweat he\r\nplunged into the river Cydnus. Tissot gives an instance of a man dying\r\nat a fountain after a long draught on a hot day.  Hippocrates mentions\r\na similar fact, and there are many modern instances.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary effects of cold on the skin locally and the system\r\ngenerally will not be mentioned here, except to add the remark of\r\nCaptain Wood that in Greenland, among his party, could be seen\r\nulcerations, blisters, and other painful lesions of the skin. In\r\nSiberia the Russian soldiers cover their noses and ears with greased\r\npaper to protect them against the cold. The Laplanders and Samoiedes,\r\nto avoid the dermal lesions caused by cold (possibly augmented by the\r\nfriction of the wind and beating of snow), anoint their skins with\r\nrancid fish oil, and are able to endure temperatures as low as -40\r\ndegrees F. In the retreat of the 10,000 Xenophon ordered all his\r\nsoldiers to grease the parts exposed to the air.\r\n\r\nEffects of Working in Compressed Air.--According to a writer in\r\nCassier's Magazine, the highest working pressures recorded have been\r\nclose to 50 pounds per square inch, but with extreme care in the\r\nselection of men, and corresponding care on the part of the men, it is\r\nvery probable that this limit may be considerably exceeded. Under\r\naverage conditions the top limit may be placed at about 45 pounds, the\r\ntime of working, according to conditions, varying from four to six\r\nhours per shift. In the cases in which higher pressures might be used,\r\nthe shifts for the men should be restricted to two of two hours each,\r\nseparated by a considerable interval. As an example of heavy pressure\r\nwork under favorable conditions as to ventilation, without very bad\r\neffects on the men, Messrs. Sooysmith & Company had an experience with\r\na work on which men were engaged in six-hour shifts, separated into two\r\nparts by half-hour intervals for lunch. This work was excavation in\r\nopen, seamy rock, carried on for several weeks under about 45 pounds\r\npressure. The character of the material through which the caisson is\r\nbeing sunk or upon which it may be resting at any time bears quite\r\nlargely upon the ability of the men to stand the pressure necessary to\r\nhold back the water at that point. If the material be so porous as to\r\npermit a considerable leakage of air through it, there will naturally\r\nresult a continuous change of air in the working chamber, and a\r\ncorresponding relief of the men from the deleterious effects which are\r\nnearly always produced by over-used air.\r\n\r\nFrom Strasburg in 1861 Bucuoy reports that during the building of a\r\nbridge at Kehl laborers had to work in compressed air, and it was found\r\nthat the respirations lost their regularity; there were sometimes\r\nintense pains in the ears, which after a while ceased.  It required a\r\ngreat effort to speak at 2 1/2 atmospheres, and it was impossible to\r\nwhistle. Perspiration was very profuse. Those who had to work a long\r\ntime lost their appetites, became emaciated, and congestion of the lung\r\nand brain was observed. The movements of the limbs were easier than in\r\nnormal air, though afterward muscular and rheumatic pains were often\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar and extraordinary development of the remaining special\r\nsenses when one of the number is lost has always been a matter of great\r\ninterest. Deaf people have always been remarkable for their acuteness\r\nof vision, touch, and smell. Blind persons, again, almost invariably\r\nhave the sense of hearing, touch, and what might be called the senses\r\nof location and temperature exquisitely developed. This substitution of\r\nthe senses is but; an example of the great law of compensation which we\r\nfind throughout nature.\r\n\r\nJonston quotes a case in the seventeenth century of a blind man who, it\r\nis said, could tell black from white by touch alone; several other\r\ninstances are mentioned in a chapter entitled \"De compensatione naturae\r\nmonstris facta.\" It must, however, be held impossible that blind people\r\ncan thus distinguish colors in any proper sense of the words. Different\r\ncolored yarns, for example, may have other differences of texture,\r\netc., that would be manifest to the sense of touch. We know of one case\r\nin which the different colors were accurately distinguished by a blind\r\ngirl, but only when located in customary and definite positions. Le Cat\r\nspeaks of a blind organist, a native of Holland, who still played the\r\norgan as well as ever. He could distinguish money by touch, and it is\r\nalso said that he made himself familiar with colors. He was fond of\r\nplaying cards, but became such a dangerous opponent, because in\r\nshuffling he could tell what cards and hands had been dealt, that he\r\nwas never allowed to handle any but his own cards.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in those who are congenitally deficient in any of the\r\nsenses that the remarkable examples of compensation are seen, but\r\nsometimes late in life these are developed. The celebrated sculptor,\r\nDaniel de Volterre, became blind after he had obtained fame, and\r\nnotwithstanding the deprivation of his chief sense he could, by touch\r\nalone, make a statue in clay after a model. Le Cat also mentions a\r\nwoman, perfectly deaf, who without any instruction had learned to\r\ncomprehend anything said to her by the movements of the lips alone. It\r\nwas not necessary to articulate any sound, but only to give the labial\r\nmovements. When tried in a foreign language she was at a loss to\r\nunderstand a single word.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the modern high standard of blind asylums\r\nand deaf-and-dumb institutions, where so many ingenious methods have\r\nbeen developed and are practiced in the education of their inmates,\r\nfeats which were formerly considered marvelous are within the reach of\r\nall those under tuition To-day, those born deaf-mutes are taught to\r\nspeak and to understand by the movements of the lips alone, and the\r\nblind read, become expert workmen, musicians, and even draughtsmen. D.\r\nD. Wood of Philadelphia, although one of the finest organists in the\r\ncountry, has been totally blind for years. It is said that he acquires\r\nnew compositions with almost as great facility as one not afflicted\r\nwith his infirmity. \"Blind Tom,\" a semi-idiot and blind negro achieved\r\nworld-wide notoriety by his skill upon the piano.\r\n\r\nIn some extraordinary cases in which both sight and hearing, and\r\nsometimes even taste and smell, are wanting, the individuals in a most\r\nwonderful way have developed the sense of touch to such a degree that\r\nit almost replaces the absent senses. The extent of this compensation\r\nis most beautifully illustrated in the cases of Laura Bridgman and\r\nHelen Keller. No better examples could be found of the compensatory\r\nability of differentiated organs to replace absent or disabled ones.\r\n\r\nLaura Dewey Bridgman was born December 21, 1829, at Hanover, N.H.  Her\r\nparents were farmers and healthy people. They were of average height,\r\nregular habits, slender build, and of rather nervous dispositions.\r\nLaura inherited the physical characteristics of her mother. In her\r\ninfancy she was subject to convulsions, but at twenty months had\r\nimproved, and at this time had learned to speak several words. At the\r\nage of two years, in common with two of the other children of the\r\nfamily, she had an attack of severe scarlet fever. Her sisters died,\r\nand she only recovered after both eyes and ears had suppurated; taste\r\nand smell were also markedly impaired. Sight in the left eye was\r\nentirely abolished, but she had some sensation for large, bright\r\nobjects in the right eye up to her eighth year; after that time she\r\nbecame totally blind.  After her recovery it was two years before she\r\ncould sit up all day, and not until she was five years old had she\r\nentirely regained her strength. Hearing being lost, she naturally never\r\ndeveloped any speech; however, she was taught to sew, knit, braid, and\r\nperform several other minor household duties. In 1837 Dr. S. W. Howe,\r\nthe Director of the Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, took Laura in\r\ncharge, and with her commenced the ordinary deaf-mute education. At\r\nthis time she was seven years and ten months old. Two years later she\r\nhad made such wonderful progress and shown such ability to learn that,\r\nnotwithstanding her infirmities, she surpassed any of the pupils of her\r\nclass. Her advancement was particularly noticed immediately after her\r\nrealization that an idea could be expressed by a succession of raised\r\nletters. In fact, so rapid was her progress, that it was deemed\r\nadvisable by the authorities to hold her back. By her peculiar\r\nsensibility to vibration she could distinguish the difference between a\r\nwhole and a half note in music, and she struck the notes on the piano\r\nquite correctly. During the first years of her education she could not\r\nsmell at all, but later she could locate the kitchen by this sense.\r\nTaste had developed to such an extent that at this time she could\r\ndistinguish the different degrees of acidity. The sense of touch,\r\nhowever, was exceedingly delicate and acute. As to her moral habits,\r\ncleanliness was the most marked. The slightest dirt or rent in her\r\nclothes caused her much embarrassment and shame, and her sense of\r\norder, neatness, and propriety was remarkable. She seemed quite at home\r\nand enjoyed the society of her own sex, but was uncomfortable and\r\ndistant in the society of males. She quickly comprehended the\r\nintellectual capacity of those with whom she was associated, and soon\r\nshowed an affiliation for the more intelligent of her friends. She was\r\nquite jealous of any extra attention shown to her fellow scholars,\r\npossibly arising from the fact that she had always been a favorite. She\r\ncried only from grief, and partially ameliorated bodily pain by jumping\r\nand by other excessive muscular movements. Like most mutes, she\r\narticulated a number of noises,--50 or more, all monosyllabic; she\r\nlaughed heartily, and was quite noisy in her play. At this time it was\r\nthought that she had been heard to utter the words doctor, pin, ship,\r\nand others. She attached great importance to orientation, and seemed\r\nquite ill at ease in finding her way about when not absolutely sure of\r\ndirections. She was always timid in the presence of animals, and by no\r\npersuasion could she be induced to caress a domestic animal. In common\r\nwith most maidens, at sixteen she became more sedate, reserved and\r\nthoughtful; at twenty she had finished her education. In 1878 she was\r\nseen by G. Stanley Hall, who found that she located the approach and\r\ndeparture of people through sensation in her feet, and seemed to have\r\nsubstituted the cutaneous sense of vibration for that of hearing. At\r\nthis time she could distinguish the odors of various fragrant flowers\r\nand had greater susceptibility to taste, particularly to sweet and\r\nsalty substances. She had written a journal for ten years, and had also\r\ncomposed three autobiographic sketches, was the authoress of several\r\npoems, and some remarkably clever letters. She died at the Perkins\r\nInstitute, May 24, 1889, after a life of sixty years, burdened with\r\ninfirmities such as few ever endure, and which, by her superior\r\ndevelopment of the remnants of the original senses left her, she had\r\novercome in a degree nothing less than marvelous.  According to a\r\nwell-known observer, in speaking of her mental development, although\r\nshe was eccentric she was not defective.  She necessarily lacked\r\ncertain data of thought, but even this feet was not very marked, and\r\nwas almost counterbalanced by her exceptional power of using what\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nIn the present day there is a girl as remarkable as Laura Bridgman, and\r\nwho bids fair to attain even greater fame by her superior development.\r\nThis girl, Helen Keller, is both deaf and blind; she has been seen in\r\nall the principal cities of the United States, has been examined by\r\nthousands of persons, and is famous for her victories over infirmities.\r\nOn account of her wonderful power of comprehension special efforts have\r\nbeen made to educate Helen Keller, and for this reason her mind is far\r\nmore finely developed than in most girls of her age. It is true that\r\nshe has the advantage over Laura Bridgman in having the senses of taste\r\nand smell, both of which she has developed to a most marvelous degree\r\nof acuteness. It is said that by odor alone she is always conscious of\r\nthe presence of another person, no matter how noiseless his entrance\r\ninto the room in which she may be. She cannot be persuaded to take food\r\nwhich she dislikes, and is never deceived in the taste. It is, however,\r\nby the means of what might be called \"touch-sight\" that the most\r\nmiraculous of her feats are performed. By placing her hands on the face\r\nof a visitor she is able to detect shades of emotion which the normal\r\nhuman eye fails to distinguish, or, in the words of one of her lay\r\nobservers, \"her sense of touch is developed to such an exquisite extent\r\nas to form a better eye for her than are yours or mine for us; and what\r\nis more, she forms judgments of character by this sight.\" According to\r\na recent report of a conversation with one of the principals of the\r\nschool in which her education is being completed, it is said that since\r\nthe girl has been under his care he has been teaching her to sing with\r\ngreat success. Placing the fingers of her hands on the throat of a\r\nsinger, she is able to follow notes covering two octaves with her own\r\nvoice, and sings synchronously with her instructor. The only difference\r\nbetween her voice and that of a normal person is in its resonant\r\nqualities. So acute has this sense become, that by placing her hand\r\nupon the frame of a piano she can distinguish two notes not more than\r\nhalf a tone apart. Helen is expected to enter the preparatory school\r\nfor Radcliffe College in the fall of 1896.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the American Association to Promote the Teaching of\r\nSpeech to the Deaf, in Philadelphia, July, 1896, this child appeared,\r\nand in a well-chosen and distinct speech told the interesting story of\r\nher own progress. Miss Sarah Fuller, principal of the Horace Mann\r\nSchool for the Deaf, Boston, is credited with the history of Helen\r\nKeller, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Helen Keller's home is in Tuscumbia, Ala. At the age of nineteen\r\nmonths she became deaf, dumb, and blind after convulsions lasting three\r\ndays. Up to the age of seven years she had received no instruction. Her\r\nparents engaged Miss Sullivan of the Perkins Institute for the Blind,\r\nSouth Boston, to go to Alabama as her teacher. She was familiar with\r\nmethods of teaching the blind, but knew nothing about instructing deaf\r\nchildren. Miss Sullivan called upon Miss Fuller for some instruction on\r\nthe subject. Miss Fuller was at that time experimenting with two little\r\ndeaf girls to make them speak as hearing children do, and called Miss\r\nSullivan's attention to it. Miss Sullivan left for her charge, and from\r\ntime to time made reports to Dr. Anagnos the principal of the Perkins\r\nSchool, which mentioned the remarkable mind which she found this little\r\nAlabama child possessed. The following year Miss Sullivan brought the\r\nchild, then eight years old, to Boston, and Mrs. Keller came with her.\r\nThey visited Miss Fuller's school.  Miss Sullivan had taught the child\r\nthe manual alphabet, and she had obtained much information by means of\r\nit. Miss Fuller noticed how quickly she appreciated the ideas given to\r\nher in that way.\r\n\r\n\"It is interesting to note that before any attempt had been made to\r\nteach the child to speak or there had been any thought of it, her own\r\nquickness of thought had suggested it to her as she talked by hand\r\nalphabet to Miss Fuller. Her mother, however, did not approve Miss\r\nFuller's suggestion that an attempt should be made to teach her speech.\r\nShe remained at the Perkins School, under Miss Sullivan's charge,\r\nanother year, when the matter was brought up again, this time by little\r\nHelen herself, who said she must speak. Miss Sullivan brought her to\r\nMiss Fuller's school one day and she received her first lesson, of\r\nabout two hours' length.\r\n\r\n\"The child's hand was first passed over Miss Fuller's face, mouth, and\r\nneck, then into her mouth, touching the tongue, teeth, lips, and hard\r\npalate, to give her an idea of the organs of speech. Miss Fuller then\r\narranged her mouth, tongue, and teeth for the sound of i as in it. She\r\ntook the child's finger and placed it upon the windpipe so that she\r\nmight feel the vibration there, put her finger between her teeth to\r\nshow her how wide apart they were, and one finger in the mouth to feel\r\nthe tongue, and then sounded the vowel. The child grasped the idea at\r\nonce.  Her fingers flew to her own mouth and throat, and she produced\r\nthe sound so nearly accurate that it sounded like an echo. Next the\r\nsound of ah was made by dropping the jaw a little and letting the child\r\nfeel that the tongue was soft and lying in the bed of the jaw with the\r\nteeth more widely separated. She in the same way arranged her own, but\r\nwas not so successful as at first, but soon produced the sound\r\nperfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eleven such lessons were given, at intervals of three or four days,\r\nuntil she had acquired all the elements of speech, Miss Sullivan in the\r\nmeantime practicing with the child on the lessons received. The first\r\nword spoken was arm, which was at once associated with her arm; this\r\ngave her great delight. She soon learned to pronounce words by herself,\r\ncombining the elements she had learned, and used them to communicate\r\nher simple wants. The first connected language she used was a\r\ndescription she gave Miss Fuller of a visit she had made to Dr. Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes, in all over 200 words. They were, all but two or three,\r\npronounced correctly. She now, six years afterward, converses quite\r\nfluently with people who know nothing of the manual alphabet by placing\r\na couple of fingers on the speaker's lips, her countenance showing\r\ngreat intentness and brightening as she catches the meaning.  Anybody\r\ncan understand her answers.\"\r\n\r\nIn a beautiful eulogy of Helen Keller in a recent number of Harper's\r\nMagazine, Charles Dudley Warner expresses the opinion that she is the\r\npurest-minded girl of her age in the world.\r\n\r\nEdith Thomas, a little inmate of the Perkins Institute for the Blind,\r\nat South Boston, is not only deaf and dumb but also blind.  She was a\r\nfellow-pupil with Helen Keller, and in a measure duplicated the rapid\r\nprogress of her former playmate. In commenting on progress in learning\r\nto talk the Boston Herald says: \"And as the teacher said the word\r\n'Kitty' once or twice she placed the finger-tips of one hand upon the\r\nteacher's lips and with the other hand clasped tightly the teacher's\r\nthroat; then, guided by the muscular action of the throat and the\r\nposition of the teeth, tongue, and lips, as interpreted by that\r\nmarvelous and delicate touch of hers, she said the word 'Kitty' over\r\nand over again distinctly in a very pretty way. She can be called dumb\r\nno longer, and before the summer vacation comes she will have mastered\r\nquite a number of words, and such is her intelligence and patience, in\r\nspite of the loss of three senses, she may yet speak quite readily.\r\n\r\n\"Her history is very interesting. She was born in Maplewood, and up to\r\nthe time of contracting diphtheria and scarlet fever, which occurred\r\nwhen she was four years old, had been a very healthy child of more than\r\nordinary quickness and ability. She had attained a greater command of\r\nlanguage than most children of her age. What a contrast between these\r\n'other days,' as she calls them, and the days which followed, when\r\nhearing and sight were completely gone, and gradually the senses of\r\nspeech and smell went, too! After the varied instruction of the blind\r\nschool the little girl had advanced so far as to make the rest of her\r\nstudy comparatively easy. The extent of her vocabulary is not\r\ndefinitely known, but it numbers at least 700 words. Reading, which was\r\nonce an irksome task, has become a pleasure to her. Her ideas of\r\nlocality and the independence of movement are remarkable, and her\r\nindustry and patience are more noticeable from day to day. She has\r\ngreat ability, and is in every respect a very wonderful child.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to recent reports, in the vicinity of Rothesay, on the Clyde,\r\nthere resides a lady totally deaf and dumb, who, in point of\r\nintelligence, scholarship, and skill in various ways, far excels many\r\nwho have all their faculties. Having been educated partly in Paris, she\r\nis a good French scholar, and her general composition is really\r\nwonderful. She has a shorthand system of her own, and when writing\r\nletters, etc., she uses a peculiar machine, somewhat of the nature of a\r\ntypewriter.\r\n\r\nAmong the deaf persons who have acquired fame in literature and the\r\narts have been Dibil Alkoffay, an Arabian poet of the eighth century;\r\nthe tactician, Folard; the German poet, Engelshall; Le Sage; La\r\nCondamine, who composed an epigram on his own infirmity; and Beethoven,\r\nthe famous musician. Fernandez, a Spanish painter of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, was a deaf-mute.\r\n\r\nAll the world pities the blind, but despite their infirmities many have\r\nachieved the highest glory in every profession. Since Homer there have\r\nbeen numerous blind poets. Milton lost none of his poetic power after\r\nhe had become blind. The Argovienne, Louise Egloff, and Daniel Leopold,\r\nwho died in 1753, were blind from infancy. Blacklock, Avisse, Koslov,\r\nand La Mott-Houdart are among other blind poets. Asconius Pedianus, a\r\ngrammarian of the first century; Didyme, the celebrated doctor of\r\nAlexandria; the Florentine, Bandolini, so well versed in Latin poetry;\r\nthe celebrated Italian grammarian, Pontanus; the German, Griesinger,\r\nwho spoke seven languages; the philologist, Grassi, who died in 1831,\r\nand many others have become blind at an age more or less advanced in\r\ntheir working lives.\r\n\r\nProbably the most remarkable of the blind scientists was the\r\nEnglishman, Saunderson, who in 1683, in his first year, was deprived of\r\nsight after an attack of small-pox. In spite of his complete blindness\r\nhe assiduously studied the sciences, and graduated with honor at the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge in mathematics and optics. His sense of touch\r\nwas remarkable. He had a collection of old Roman medals, all of which,\r\nwithout mistake, he could distinguish by their impressions. He also\r\nseemed to have the ability to judge distance, and was said to have\r\nknown how far he had walked, and by the velocity he could even tell the\r\ndistance traversed in a vehicle. Among other blind mathematicians was\r\nthe Dutchman, Borghes (died in 1652); the French astronomer, the Count\r\nde Pagan, who died in 1655; Galileo; the astronomer, Cassini, and\r\nBerard, who became blind at twenty-three years, and was for a long time\r\nProfessor of Mathematics at the College of Briancon.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century the sculptor, Jean Gonnelli, born in\r\nTuscany, became blind at twenty years; but in spite of his infirmity he\r\nafterward executed what were regarded as his masterpieces. It is said\r\nthat he modeled a portrait of Pope Urban VIII, using as a guide his\r\nhand, passed from time to time over the features. Lomazzo, the Italian\r\npainter of the eighteenth century, is said to have continued his work\r\nafter becoming blind.\r\n\r\nSeveral men distinguished for their bravery and ability in the art of\r\nwar have been blind. Jean de Troczow, most commonly known by the name\r\nof Ziska, in 1420 lost his one remaining eye, and was afterward known\r\nas the \"old blind dog,\" but, nevertheless, led his troops to many\r\nvictories. Froissart beautifully describes the glorious death of the\r\nblind King of Bohemia at the battle of Crecy in 1346. Louis III, King\r\nof Provence; Boleslas III, Duke of Bohemia; Magnus IV, King of Norway,\r\nand Bela II, King of Hungary, were blind. Nathaniel Price, a librarian\r\nof Norwich in the last century, lost his sight in a voyage to America,\r\nwhich, however, did not interfere in any degree with his duties, for\r\nhis books were in as good condition and their location as directly\r\nunder his knowledge, during his blindness as they were in his earlier\r\ndays. At the present day in New York there is a blind billiard expert\r\nwho occasionally gives exhibitions of his prowess.\r\n\r\nFeats of Memory.--From time to time there have been individuals,\r\nprincipally children, who gave wonderful exhibitions of memory, some\r\nfor dates, others for names, and some for rapid mental calculation.\r\nBefore the Anthropological Society in 1880 Broca exhibited a lad of\r\neleven, a Piedmontese, named Jacques Inaudi.  This boy, with a trick\r\nmonkey, had been found earning his livelihood by begging and by solving\r\nmentally in a few minutes the most difficult problems in arithmetic. A\r\ngentleman residing in Marseilles had seen him while soliciting alms\r\nperform most astonishing feats of memory, and brought him to Paris. In\r\nthe presence of the Society Broca gave him verbally a task in\r\nmultiplication, composed of some trillions to be multiplied by\r\nbillions. In the presence of all the members he accomplished his task\r\nin less than ten minutes, and without the aid of pencil and paper,\r\nsolving the whole problem mentally. Although not looking intelligent,\r\nand not being able to read or write, he perhaps could surpass any one\r\nin the world in his particular feat. It was stated that he proceeded\r\nfrom left to right in his calculations, instead of from right to left\r\nin the usual manner. In his personal appearance the only thing\r\nindicative of his wonderful abilities was his high forehead.\r\n\r\nAn infant prodigy named Oscar Moore was exhibited to the physicians of\r\nChicago at the Central Music Hall in 1888, and excited considerable\r\ncomment at the time. The child was born of mulatto parents at Waco,\r\nTexas, on August 19, 1885, and when only thirteen months old manifested\r\nremarkable mental ability and precocity. S. V. Clevenger, a physician\r\nof Chicago, has described the child as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Oscar was born blind and, as frequently occurs in such cases, the\r\ntouch-sense compensatingly developed extraordinarily. It was observed\r\nthat after touching a person once or twice with his stubby baby\r\nfingers, he could thereafter unfailingly recognize and call by name the\r\none whose hand he again felt. The optic sense is the only one\r\ndefective, for tests reveal that his hearing, taste, and smell are\r\nacute, and the tactile development surpasses in refinement. But his\r\nmemory is the most remarkable peculiarity, for when his sister conned\r\nher lessons at home, baby Oscar, less than two years old, would recite\r\nall he heard her read. Unlike some idiot savants, in which category he\r\nis not to be included, who repeat parrot-like what they have once\r\nheard, baby Oscar seems to digest what he hears, and requires at least\r\nmore than one repetition of what he is trying to remember, after which\r\nhe possesses the information imparted and is able to yield it at once\r\nwhen questioned. It is not necessary for him to commence at the\r\nbeginning, as the possessors of some notable memories were compelled to\r\ndo, but he skips about to any required part of his repertoire.\r\n\r\n\"He sings a number of songs and counts in different languages, but it\r\nis not supposable that he understands every word he utters. If,\r\nhowever, his understanding develops as it promises to do, he will\r\nbecome a decided polyglot. He has mastered an appalling array of\r\nstatistics, such as the areas in square miles of hundreds of countries,\r\nthe population of the world's principal cities, the birthdays of all\r\nthe Presidents, the names of all the cities of the United States of\r\nover 10,000 inhabitants, and a lot of mathematical data. He is greatly\r\nattracted by music, and this leads to the expectation that when more\r\nmature he may rival Blind Tom.\r\n\r\n\"In disposition he is very amiable, but rather grave beyond his years.\r\nHe shows great affection for his father, and is as playful and as happy\r\nas the ordinary child. He sleeps soundly, has a good childish appetite,\r\nand appears to be in perfect health. His motions are quick but not\r\nnervous, and are as well coordinated as in a child of ten. In fact, he\r\nimpresses one as having the intelligence of a much older child than\r\nthree years (now five years), but his height, dentition, and general\r\nappearance indicate the truthfulness of the age assigned. An evidence\r\nof his symmetrical mental development appears in his extreme\r\ninquisitiveness. He wants to understand the meaning of what he is\r\ntaught, and some kind of an explanation must be given him for what he\r\nlearns. Were his memory alone abnormally great and other faculties\r\ndefective, this would hardly be the case; but if so, it cannot at\r\npresent be determined.\r\n\r\n\"His complexion is yellow, with African features, flat nose, thick lips\r\nbut not prognathous, superciliary ridges undeveloped, causing the\r\nforehead to protrude a little. His head measures 19 inches in\r\ncircumference, on a line with the upper ear-tips, the forehead being\r\nmuch narrower than the occipitoparietal portion, which is noticeably\r\nvery wide. The occiput protrudes backward, causing a forward sweep of\r\nthe back of the neck. From the nose-root to the nucha over the head he\r\nmeasures 13 1/2 inches, and between upper ear-tips across and over the\r\nhead 11 inches, which is so close to the eight-and ten-inch standard\r\nthat he may be called mesocephalic. The bulging in the vicinity of the\r\nparietal region accords remarkably with speculations upon the location\r\nof the auditory memory in that region, such as those in the American\r\nNaturalist, July, 1888, and the fact that injury of that part of the\r\nbrain may cause loss of memory of the meaning of words. It may be that\r\nthe premature death of the mother's children has some significance in\r\nconnection with Oscar's phenomenal development. There is certainly a\r\nhypernutrition of the parietal brain with atrophy of the optic tract,\r\nboth of which conditions could arise from abnormal vascular causes, or\r\nthe extra growth of the auditory memory region may have deprived of\r\nnutrition, by pressure, the adjacent optic centers in the occipital\r\nbrain. The otherwise normal motion of the eyes indicates the nystagmus\r\nto be functional.\r\n\r\n\"Sudden exaltation of the memory is often the consequence of grave\r\nbrain disease, and in children this symptom is most frequent.\r\nPritchard, Rush, and other writers upon mental disorders record\r\ninteresting instances of remarkable memory-increase before death,\r\nmainly in adults, and during fever and insanity. In simple mania the\r\nmemory is often very acute.  Romberg tells of a young girl who lost her\r\nsight after an attack of small-pox, but acquired an extraordinary\r\nmemory. He calls attention to the fact that the scrofulous and rachitic\r\ndiatheses in childhood are sometimes accompanied by this disorder.\r\nWinslow notes that in the incipient state of the brain disease of early\r\nlife connected with fevers, disturbed conditions of the cerebral\r\ncirculation and vessels, and in affections of advanced life, there is\r\noften witnessed a remarkable exaltation of the memory, which may herald\r\ndeath by apoplexy.\r\n\r\n\"Not only has the institution of intelligence in idiots dated from\r\nfalls upon the head, but extra mentality has been conferred by such an\r\nevent Pritchard tells of three idiot brothers, one of whom, after a\r\nsevere head injury, brightened up and became a barrister, while his\r\nbrothers remained idiotic. 'Father Mabillon,' says Winslow, 'is said to\r\nhave been an idiot until twenty-six years of age, when he fractured his\r\nskull against a stone staircase. He was trepanned. After recovering,\r\nhis intellect fully developed itself in a mind endowed with a lively\r\nimagination, an amazing memory, and a zeal for study rarely equaled.'\r\nSuch instances can be accounted for by the brain having previously been\r\npoorly nourished by a defective blood supply, which defect was remedied\r\nby the increased circulation afforded by the head-injury.\r\n\r\n\"It is a commonly known fact that activity of the brain is attended\r\nwith a greater head-circulation than when the mind is dull, within\r\ncertain limits. Anomalous development of the brain through\r\nblood-vessels, affording an extra nutritive supply to the mental\r\napparatus, can readily be conceived as occurring before birth, just as\r\naberrant nutrition elsewhere produces giants from parents of ordinary\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\"There is but one sense-defect in the child Oscar, his\r\neyesight-absence, and that is atoned for by his hearing and\r\ntouch-acuteness, as it generally is in the blind. Spitzka and others\r\ndemonstrate that in such cases other parts of the brain enlarge to\r\ncompensate for the atrophic portion which is connected with the\r\nfunctionless nerves. This, considered with his apparently perfect,\r\nmental and physical health, leaves no reason to suppose that Oscar's\r\nextravagant memory depends upon disease any more than we can suspect\r\nall giants of being sickly, though the anomaly is doubtless due to\r\npathologic conditions. Of course, there is no predicting what may\r\ndevelop later in his life, but in any event science will be benefited.\r\n\r\n\"It is a popular idea that great vigor of memory is often associated\r\nwith low-grade intelligence, and cases such as Blind Tom and other\r\n'idiot savants,' who could repeat the contents of a newspaper after a\r\nsingle reading, justify the supposition.  Fearon, on 'Mental Vigor,'\r\ntells of a man who could remember the day that every person had been\r\nburied in the parish for thirty-five years, and could repeat with\r\nunvarying accuracy the name and age of the deceased and the mourners at\r\nthe funeral. But he was a complete fool. Out of the line of burials he\r\nhad not one idea, could not give an intelligible reply to a single\r\nquestion, nor be trusted even to feed himself. While memory-development\r\nis thus apparent in some otherwise defective intellects, it has\r\nprobably as often or oftener been observed to occur in connection with\r\nfull or great intelligence. Edmund Burke, Clarendon, John Locke,\r\nArchbishop Tillotson, and Dr. Johnson were all distinguished for having\r\ngreat strength of memory. Sir W.  Hamilton observed that Grotius,\r\nPascal, Leibnitz, and Euler were not less celebrated for their\r\nintelligence than for their memory.  Ben Jonson could repeat all that\r\nhe had written and whole books he had read. Themistocles could call by\r\nname the 20,000 citizens of Athens. Cyrus is said to have known the\r\nname of every soldier in his army. Hortensius, a great Roman orator,\r\nand Seneca had also great memories. Niebuhr, the Danish historian, was\r\nremarkable for his acuteness of memory. Sir James Mackintosh, Dugald\r\nStewart, and Dr. Gregory had similar reputations.\r\n\r\n\"Nor does great mental endowment entail physical enfeeblement; for,\r\nwith temperance, literary men have reached extreme old age, as in the\r\ncases of Klopstock, Goethe, Chaucer, and the average age attained by\r\nall the signers of the American Declaration of Independence was\r\nsixty-four years, many of them being highly gifted men intellectually.\r\nThus, in the case of the phenomenal Oscar it cannot be predicted that\r\nhe will not develop, as he now promises to do, equal and extraordinary\r\npowers of mind, even though it would be rare in one of his racial\r\ndescent, and in the face of the fact that precocity gives no assurance\r\nof adult brightness, for it can be urged that John Stuart Mill read\r\nGreek when four years of age.\r\n\r\n\"The child is strumous, however, and may die young. His exhibitors, who\r\nare coining him into money, should seek the best medical care for him\r\nand avoid surcharging his memory with rubbish. Proper cultivation of\r\nhis special senses, especially the tactile, by competent teachers, will\r\ngive Oscar the best chance of developing intellectually and acquiring\r\nan education in the proper sense of the word.\"\r\n\r\nBy long custom many men of letters have developed wonderful feats of\r\nmemory; and among illiterate persons, by means of points of\r\nassociation, the power of memory has been little short of marvelous. At\r\na large hotel in Saratoga there was at one time a negro whose duty was\r\nto take charge of the hats and coats of the guests as they entered the\r\ndining-room and return to each his hat after the meal. It was said\r\nthat, without checks or the assistance of the owners, he invariably\r\nreturned the right articles to the right persons on request, and no\r\nmatter how large the crowd, his limit of memory never seemed to be\r\nreached. Many persons have seen expert players at draughts and chess\r\nwho, blindfolded, could carry on numerous games with many competitors\r\nand win most of the matches. To realize what a wonderful feat of memory\r\nthis performance is, one need only see the absolute exhaustion of one\r\nof these men after a match. In whist, some experts have been able to\r\ndetail the succession of the play of the cards so many hands back that\r\ntheir competitors had long since forgotten it.\r\n\r\nThere is reported to be in Johnson County, Missouri, a mathematical\r\nwonder by the name of Rube Fields. At the present day he is between\r\nforty and fifty years of age, and his external appearance indicates\r\npoverty as well as indifference. His temperament is most sluggish; he\r\nrarely speaks unless spoken to, and his replies are erratic.\r\n\r\nThe boyhood of this strange character was that of an overgrown country\r\nlout with boorish manners and silly mind. He did not and would not go\r\nto school, and he asserts now that if he had done so he \"would have\r\nbecome as big a fool as other people.\" A shiftless fellow, left to his\r\nown devices, he performed some wonderful feats, and among the many\r\nstories connected with this period of his life is one which describes\r\nhow he actually ate up a good-sized patch of sugar cane, simply because\r\nhe found it good to his taste.\r\n\r\nYet from this clouded, illiterate mind a wonderful mathematical gift\r\nshines. Just when he began to assert his powers is not known; but his\r\nfeats have been remembered for twenty years by his neighbors. A report\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"Give Rube Fields the distance by rail between any two points, and the\r\ndimensions of a car-wheel, and almost as soon as the statement has left\r\nyour lips he will tell you the number of revolutions the wheel will\r\nmake in traveling over the track. Call four or five or any number of\r\ncolumns of figures down a page, and when you have reached the bottom he\r\nwill announce the sum. Given the number of yards or pounds of articles\r\nand the price, and at once he will return the total cost--and this he\r\nwill do all day long, without apparent effort or fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman relates an instance of Fields' knowledge of figures.\r\nAfter having called several columns of figures for addition, he went\r\nback to the first column, saying that it was wrong, and repeating it,\r\npurposely miscalling the next to the last figure.  At once Fields threw\r\nup his hand, exclaiming: 'You didn't call it that way before.'\r\n\r\n\"Fields' answers come quick and sharp, seemingly by intuition.\r\nCalculations which would require hours to perform are made in less time\r\nthan it takes to state the question. The size of the computations seems\r\nto offer no bar to their rapid solution, and answers in which long\r\nlines of figures are reeled off come with perfect ease. In watching the\r\neffort put forth in reaching an answer, there would seem to be some\r\nprocess going on in the mind, and an incoherent mumbling is often\r\nindulged in, but it is highly probable that Fields does not himself\r\nknow how he derives his answers. Certain it is that he is unable to\r\nexplain the process, nor has any one ever been able to draw from him\r\nanything concerning it. Almost the only thing he knows about the power\r\nis that he possesses it, and, while he is not altogether averse to\r\nreceiving money for his work, he has steadily refused to allow himself\r\nto be exhibited.\" In reviewing the peculiar endowment of Fields, the\r\nChicago Record says:--\r\n\r\n\"How this feat is performed is as much a mystery as the process by\r\nwhich he solves a problem in arithmetic. He answers no questions. Rapid\r\nmathematicians, men of study, who by intense application and short\r\nmethods have become expert, have sought to probe these two mysteries,\r\nbut without results. Indeed, the man's intelligence is of so low an\r\norder as to prevent him from aiding those who seek to know. With age,\r\ntoo, he grows more surly. Of what vast value this 'gift' might be to\r\nthe world of science, if coupled with average intelligence, is readily\r\nimagined. That it will ever be understood is unlikely. As it is, the\r\npower staggers belief and makes modern psychology, with its study of\r\nbrain-cells, stand aghast. As to poor Fields himself, he excites only\r\nsympathy. Homeless, unkempt, and uncouth, traveling aimlessly on a\r\njourney which he does not understand, he hugs to his heart a marvelous\r\npower, which he declares to be a gift from God. To his weak mind it\r\nlifts him above his fellow-men, and yet it is as useless to the world\r\nas a diamond in a dead man's hand.\"\r\n\r\nWolf-Children.--It is interesting to know to what degree a human being\r\nwill resemble a beast when deprived of the association with man. We\r\nseem to get some insight to this question in the investigation of so\r\ncalled cases of \"wolf-children.\"\r\n\r\nSaxo Grammaticus speaks of a bear that kidnapped a child and kept it a\r\nlong time in his den. The tale of the Roman she-wolf is well known, and\r\nmay have been something more than a myth, as there have been several\r\napparently authentic cases reported in which a child has been rescued\r\nfrom its associations with a wolf who had stolen it some time\r\npreviously. Most of the stories of wolf-children come from India.\r\nAccording to Oswald in Ball's \"Jungle Life in India,\" there is the\r\nfollowing curious account of two children in the Orphanage of Sekandra,\r\nnear Agra, who had been discovered among wolves: \"A trooper sent by a\r\nnative Governor of Chandaur to demand payment of some revenue was\r\npassing along the bank of the river about noon when he saw a large\r\nfemale wolf leave her den, followed by three whelps and a little boy.\r\nThe boy went on all-fours, and when the trooper tried to catch him he\r\nran as fast as the whelps, and kept up with the old one. They all\r\nentered the den, but were dug out by the people and the boy was\r\nsecured. He struggled hard to rush into every hole or gully they came\r\nnear. When he saw a grown-up person he became alarmed, but tried to fly\r\nat children and bite them. He rejected cooked meat with disgust, but\r\ndelighted in raw flesh and bones, putting them under his paws like a\r\ndog.\" The other case occurred at Chupra, in the Presidency of Bengal.\r\nIn March, 1843, a Hindoo mother went out to help her husband in the\r\nfield, and while she was cutting rice her little boy was carried off by\r\na wolf. About a year afterward a wolf, followed by several cubs and a\r\nstrange, ape-like creature, was seen about ten miles from Chupra. After\r\na lively chase the nondescript was caught and recognized (by the mark\r\nof a burn on his knee) as the Hindoo boy that had disappeared in the\r\nrice-field. This boy would not eat anything but raw flesh, and could\r\nnever be taught to speak, but expressed his emotions in an inarticulate\r\nmutter. His elbows and the pans of his knees had become horny from\r\ngoing on all-fours with his foster mother. In the winter of 1850 this\r\nboy made several attempts to regain his freedom, and in the following\r\nspring he escaped for good and disappeared in the jungle-forest of\r\nBhangapore.\r\n\r\nThe Zoologist for March, 1888, reproduced a remarkable pamphlet printed\r\nat Plymouth in 1852, which had been epitomized in the Lancet. This\r\ninteresting paper gives an account of wolves nurturing small children\r\nin their dens. Six cases are given of boys who have been rescued from\r\nthe maternal care of wolves. In one instance the lad was traced from\r\nthe moment of his being carried off by a lurking wolf while his parents\r\nwere working in the field, to the time when, after having been\r\nrecovered by his mother six years later, he escaped from her into the\r\njungle. In all these cases certain marked features reappear. In the\r\nfirst, the boy was very inoffensive, except when teased, and then he\r\ngrowled surlily. He would eat anything thrown to him, but preferred\r\nmeat, which he devoured with canine voracity. He drank a pitcher of\r\nbuttermilk at one gulp, and could not be induced to wear clothing even\r\nin the coldest weather. He showed the greatest fondness for bones, and\r\ngnawed them contentedly, after the manner of his adopted parents. This\r\nchild had coarse features, a repulsive countenance, was filthy in his\r\nhabits, and could not articulate a word.\r\n\r\nIn another case the child was kidnapped at three and recovered at nine.\r\nHe muttered, but could not articulate. As in the other case, he could\r\nnot be enticed to wear clothes. From constantly being on all-fours the\r\nfront of this child's knees and his elbows had become hardened. In the\r\nthird case the father identified a son who had been carried away at the\r\nage of six, and was found four years afterward. The intellectual\r\ndeterioration was not so marked. The boy understood signs, and his\r\nhearing was exceedingly acute; when directed by movements of the hands\r\nto assist the cultivators in turning out cattle, he readily\r\ncomprehended what was asked of him; yet this lad, whose vulpine career\r\nwas so short, could neither talk nor utter any decidedly articulate\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nThe author of the pamphlet expressed some surprise that there was no\r\ncase on record in which a grown man had been found in such association.\r\nThis curious collection of cases of wolf-children is attributed to\r\nColonel Sleeman, a well-known officer, who is known to have been\r\ngreatly interested in the subject, and who for a long time resided in\r\nthe forests of India. A copy, now a rarity, is in the South Kensington\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of a wolf-child was reported many years ago in\r\nChambers' Journal. In the Etwah district, near the banks of the river\r\nJumna, a boy was captured from the wolves. After a time this child was\r\nrestored to his parents, who, however, \"found him very difficult to\r\nmanage, for he was most fractious and troublesome--in fact, just a\r\ncaged wild beast. Often during the night for hours together he would\r\ngive vent to most unearthly yells and moans, destroying the rest and\r\nirritating the tempers of his neighbors and generally making night\r\nhideous. On one occasion his people chained him by the waist to a tree\r\non the outskirts of the village. Then a rather curious incident\r\noccurred. It was a bright moonlight night, and two wolf cubs\r\n(undoubtedly those in whose companionship he had been captured),\r\nattracted by his cries while on the prowl, came to him, and were\r\ndistinctly seen to gambol around him with as much familiarity and\r\naffection as if they considered him quite one of themselves. They only\r\nleft him on the approach of morning, when movement and stir again arose\r\nin the village. This boy did not survive long. He never spoke, nor did\r\na single ray of human intelligence ever shed its refining light over\r\nhis debased features.\"\r\n\r\nRecently a writer in the Badmington Magazine, in speaking of the\r\nauthenticity of wolf-children, says:--\r\n\r\n\"A jemidar told me that when he was a lad he remembered going, with\r\nothers, to see a wolf-child which had been netted. Some time after\r\nthis, while staying at an up-country place called Shaporeooundie, in\r\nEast Bengal, it was my fortune to meet an Anglo-Indian gentleman who\r\nhad been in the Indian civil service for upward of thirty years, and\r\nhad traveled about during most of that time; from him I learned all I\r\nwanted to know of wolf-children, for he not only knew of several cases,\r\nbut had actually seen and examined, near Agra, a child which had been\r\nrecovered from the wolves. The story of Romulus and Remus, which all\r\nschoolboys and the vast majority of grown people regard as a myth,\r\nappears in a different light when one studies the question of\r\nwolf-children, and ascertains how it comes to pass that boys are found\r\nliving on the very best terms with such treacherous and rapacious\r\nanimals as wolves, sleeping with them in their dens, sharing the raw\r\nflesh of deer and kids which the she-wolf provides, and, in fact,\r\nleading in all essentials the actual life of a wolf.\r\n\r\n\"A young she-wolf has a litter of cubs, and after a time her instinct\r\ntells her that they will require fresh food. She steals out at night in\r\nquest of prey. Soon she espies a weak place in the fence (generally\r\nconstructed of thatching grass and bamboos) which encloses the\r\ncompound, or 'unguah,' of a poor villager. She enters, doubtless, in\r\nthe hope of securing a kid; and while prowling about inside looks into\r\na hut where a woman and infant are soundly sleeping. In a moment she\r\nhas pounced on the child, and is out of reach before its cries can\r\nattract the villagers.  Arriving safely at her den under the rocks, she\r\ndrops the little one among her cubs. At this critical time the fate of\r\nthe child hangs in the balance. Either it will be immediately torn to\r\npieces and devoured, or in a most wonderful way remain in the cave\r\nunharmed. In the event of escape, the fact may be accounted for in\r\nseveral ways. Perhaps the cubs are already gorged when the child is\r\nthrown before them, or are being supplied with solid food before their\r\ncarnivorous instinct is awakened, so they amuse themselves by simply\r\nlicking the sleek, oily body (Hindoo mothers daily rub their boy babies\r\nwith some native vegetable oil) of the infant, and thus it lies in the\r\nnest, by degrees getting the odor of the wolf cubs, after which the\r\nmother wolf will not molest it.  In a little time the infant begins to\r\nfeel the pangs of hunger, and hearing the cubs sucking, soon follows\r\ntheir example. Now the adoption is complete, all fear of harm to the\r\nchild from wolves has gone, and the foster-mother will guard and\r\nprotect it as though it were of her own flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n\"The mode of progression of these children is on all fours--not, as a\r\nrule, on the hands and feet, but on the knees and elbows.  The reason\r\nthe knees are used is to be accounted for by the fact that, owing to\r\nthe great length of the human leg and thigh in proportion to the length\r\nof the arm, the knee would naturally be brought to the ground, and the\r\ninstep and top of the toes would be used instead of the sole and heel\r\nof the almost inflexible foot. Why the elbow should be employed instead\r\nof the hand is less easy to understand, but probably it is better\r\nsuited to give support to the head and fore-part of the body.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these poor waifs have been recovered after spending ten or\r\nmore years in the fellowship of wolves, and, though wild and savage at\r\nfirst, have in time become tractable in some degree.  They are rarely\r\nseen to stand upright, unless to look around, and they gnaw bones in\r\nthe manner of a dog, holding one end between the forearms and hands,\r\nwhile snarling and snapping at everybody who approaches too near. The\r\nwolf-child has little except his outward form to show that it is a\r\nhuman being with a soul. It is a fearful and terrible thing, and hard\r\nto understand, that the mere fact of a child's complete isolation from\r\nits own kind should bring it to such a state of absolute degradation.\r\nOf course, they speak no language, though some, in time, have learned\r\nto make known their wants by signs. When first taken they fear the\r\napproach of adults, and, if possible, will slink out of sight; but\r\nshould a child of their own size, or smaller, come near, they will\r\ngrowl, and even snap and bite at it. On the other hand, the close\r\nproximity of \"pariah\" dogs or jackals is unresented, in some cases\r\nwelcomed; for I have heard of them sharing their food with these\r\nanimals, and even petting and fondling them. They have in time been\r\nbrought to a cooked-meat diet, but would always prefer raw flesh. Some\r\nhave been kept alive after being reclaimed for as long as two years,\r\nbut for some reason or other they all sicken and die, generally long\r\nbefore that time. One would think, however, that, having undoubtedly\r\nrobust constitutions, they might be saved if treated in a scientific\r\nmanner and properly managed.\"\r\n\r\nRudyard Kipling, possibly inspired by accounts of these wolf-children\r\nin India, has ingeniously constructed an interesting series of fabulous\r\nstories of a child who was brought up by the beasts of the jungles and\r\ntaught their habits and their mode of communication. The ingenious way\r\nin which the author has woven the facts together and interspersed them\r\nwith his intimate knowledge of animal-life commends his \"Jungle-Book\"\r\nas a legitimate source of recreation to the scientific observer.\r\n\r\nAmong observers mentioned in the \"Index Catalogue\" who have studied\r\nthis subject are Giglioli, Mitra, and Ornstein.\r\n\r\nThe artificial manufacture of \"wild men\" or \"wild boys\" in the Chinese\r\nEmpire is shown by recent reports. Macgowan says the traders kidnap a\r\nboy and skin him alive bit by bit, transplanting on the denuded\r\nsurfaces the hide of a bear or dog. This process is most tedious and is\r\nby no means complete when the hide is completely transplanted, as the\r\nsubject must be rendered mute by destruction of the vocal cords, made\r\nto use all fours in walking, and submitted to such degradation as to\r\ncompletely blight all reason. It is said that the process is so severe\r\nthat only one in five survive. A \"wild boy\" exhibited in Kiangse had\r\nthe entire skin of a dog substituted and walked on all fours. It was\r\nfound that he had been kidnapped. His proprietor was decapitated on the\r\nspot. Macgowan says that parasitic monsters are manufactured in China\r\nby a similar process of transplantation. He adds that the deprivation\r\nof light for several years renders the child a great curiosity, if in\r\nconjunction its growth is dwarfed by means of food and drugs, and its\r\nvocal apparatus destroyed. A certain priest subjected a kidnapped boy\r\nto this treatment and exhibited him as a sacred deity. Macgowan\r\nmentions that the child looked like wax, as though continually fed on\r\nlardaceous substances. He squatted with his palms together and was a\r\ndriveling idiot. The monk was discovered and escaped, but his temple\r\nwas razed.\r\n\r\nEquilibrists.--Many individuals have cultivated their senses so acutely\r\nthat by the eye and particularly by touch they are able to perform\r\nalmost incredible feats of maintaining equilibrium under the most\r\ndifficult circumstances Professional rope-walkers have been known in\r\nall times. The Greeks had a particular passion for equilibrists, and\r\ncalled them \"neurobates,\" \"oribates,\" and \"staenobates.\" Blondin would\r\nhave been one of the latter. Antique medals showing equilibrists making\r\nthe ascent of an inclined cord have been found. The Romans had walkers\r\nboth of the slack-rope and tight-rope Many of the Fathers of the Church\r\nhave pronounced against the dangers of these exercises. Among others,\r\nSt. John Chrysostom speaks of men who execute movements on inclined\r\nropes at unheard-of heights. In the ruins of Herculaneum there is still\r\nvisible a picture representing an equilibrist executing several\r\ndifferent exercises, especially one in which he dances on a rope to the\r\ntune of a double flute, played by himself. The Romans particularly\r\nliked to witness ascensions on inclined ropes, and sometimes these were\r\nattached to the summits of high hills, and while mounting them the\r\nacrobats performed different pantomimes.  It is said that under Charles\r\nVI a Genoese acrobat, on the occasion of the arrival of the Queen of\r\nFrance, carried in each hand an illuminated torch while descending a\r\nrope stretched from the summit of the towers of Notre Dame to a house\r\non the Pont au Change. According to Guyot-Daubes, a similar performance\r\nwas seen in London in 1547. In this instance the rope was attached to\r\nthe highest pinnacle of St. Paul's Cathedral. Under Louis XII an\r\nacrobat named Georges Menustre, during a passage of the King through\r\nMacon, executed several performances on a rope stretched from the grand\r\ntower of the Chateau and the clock of the Jacobins, at a height of 156\r\nfeet. A similar performance was given at Milan before the French\r\nAmbassadors, and at Venice under the Doges and the Senate on each St.\r\nMark's Day, rope-walkers performed at high altitudes. In 1649 a man\r\nattempted to traverse the Seine on a rope placed between the Tour de\r\nNesles and the Tour du Grand-Prevost. The performance, however, was\r\ninterrupted by the fall of the mountebank into the Seine. At subsequent\r\nfairs in France other acrobats have appeared. At the commencement of\r\nthis century there was a person named Madame Saqui who astonished the\r\npublic with her nimbleness and extraordinary skill in rope walking. Her\r\nspecialty was military maneuvers. On a cord 20 meters from the ground\r\nshe executed all sorts of military pantomimes without assistance,\r\nshooting off pistols, rockets, and various colored fires. Napoleon\r\nawarded her the title of the first acrobat of France. She gave a\r\nperformance as late as 1861 at the Hippodrome of Paris.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 there was a woman called \"La Malaga,\" who, in the presence of\r\nthe allied sovereigns at Versailles, made an ascension on a rope 200\r\nfeet above the Swiss Lake.\r\n\r\nIn the present generation probably the most famous of all the\r\nequilibrists was Blondin. This person, whose real name was Emile\r\nGravelet, acquired a universal reputation; about 1860 he traversed the\r\nNiagara Falls on a cable at an elevation of nearly 200 feet. Blondin\r\nintroduced many novelties in his performances.  Sometimes he would\r\ncarry a man over on his shoulders; again he would eat a meal while on\r\nhis wire; cook and eat an omelet, using a table and ordinary cooking\r\nutensils, all of which he kept balanced. In France Blondin was almost\r\nthe patron saint of the rope-walkers; and at the present day the\r\nperformers imitate his feats, but never with the same grace and\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 an acrobat bearing the natural name of Arsens Blondin traversed\r\none river after another in France on a wire stretched at high\r\naltitudes. With the aid of a balancing-rod he walked the rope\r\nblindfolded; with baskets on his feet; sometimes he wheeled persons\r\nover in a wheelbarrow. He was a man of about thirty, short, but\r\nwonderfully muscled and extremely supple.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a negro equilibrist named Malcom several times\r\ntraversed the Meuse at Sedan on a wire at about a height of 100 feet.\r\nOnce while attempting this feat, with his hands and feet shackled with\r\niron chains, allowing little movement, the support on one side fell,\r\nafter the cable had parted, and landed on the spectators, killing a\r\nyoung girl and wounding many others. Malcom was precipitated into the\r\nriver, but with wonderful presence of mind and remarkable strength he\r\nbroke his bands and swam to the shore, none the worse for his high\r\nfall; he immediately helped in attention to his wounded spectators. A\r\nclose inspection of all the exhibitionists of this class will show that\r\nthey are of superior physique and calm courage. They only acquire their\r\nability after long gymnastic exercise, as well as actual practice on\r\nthe rope. Most of these persons used means of balancing themselves,\r\ngenerally a long and heavy pole; but some used nothing but their\r\noutstretched arms. In 1895, at the Royal Aquarium in London, there was\r\nan individual who slowly mounted a long wire reaching to the top of\r\nthis huge structure, and, after having made the ascent, without the aid\r\nof any means of balancing but his arms, slid the whole length of the\r\nwire, landing with enormous velocity into an outstretched net.\r\n\r\nThe equilibrists mentioned thus far have invariably used a tightly\r\nstretched rope or wire; but there are a number of persons who perform\r\nfeats, of course not of such magnitude, on a slack wire, in which they\r\nhave to defy not only the force of gravity, but the to-and-fro motion\r\nof the cable as well. It is particularly with the Oriental performers\r\nthat we see this exhibition. Some use open parasols, which, with their\r\nChinese or Japanese costumes, render the performance more picturesque;\r\nwhile others seem to do equally well without such adjuncts. There have\r\nbeen performers of this class who play with sharp daggers while\r\nmaintaining themselves on thin and swinging wires.\r\n\r\nAnother class of equilibrists are those who maintain the upright\r\nposition resting on their heads with their feet in the air. At the\r\nHippodrome in Paris some years since there was a man who remained in\r\nthis position seven minutes and ate a meal during the interval. There\r\nwere two clowns at the Cirque Franconi who duplicated this feat, and\r\nthe program called their dinner \"Un dejouner en tete-a-tete.\" Some\r\nother persons perform wonderful feats of a similar nature on an\r\noscillating trapeze, and many similar performances have been witnessed\r\nby the spectators of our large circuses.\r\n\r\nThe \"human pyramids\" are interesting, combining, as they do, wonderful\r\npower of maintaining equilibrium with agility and strength. The\r\nrapidity with which they are formed and are tumbled to pieces is\r\nmarvelous they sometimes include as many as 16 persons men, women, and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe exhibitions given by the class of persons commonly designated as\r\n\"jugglers\" exemplify the perfect control that by continual practice one\r\nmay obtain over his various senses and muscles. The most wonderful\r\nfeats of dexterity are thus reduced into mere automatic movements.\r\nEither standing, sitting, mounted on a horse, or even on a wire, they\r\nare able to keep three four, five, and even six balls in continual\r\nmotion in the air. They use articles of the greatest difference in\r\nspecific gravity in the same manner. A juggler called \"Kara,\" appearing\r\nin London and Paris in the summer of 1895, juggled with an open\r\numbrella, an eye-glass, and a traveling satchel, and received each\r\nafter its course in the air with unerring precision. Another man called\r\n\"Paul Cinquevalli,\" well known in this country, does not hesitate to\r\njuggle with lighted lamps or pointed knives. The tricks of the clowns\r\nwith their traditional pointed felt hats are well known.  Recently\r\nthere appeared in Philadelphia a man who received six such hats on his\r\nhead, one on top of the other, thrown by his partner from the rear of\r\nthe first balcony of the theater. Others will place a number of rings\r\non their fingers, and with a swift and dexterous movement toss them all\r\nin the air, catching them again all on one finger. Without resorting to\r\nthe fabulous method of Columbus, they balance eggs on a table, and in\r\nextraordinary ways defy all the powers of gravity.\r\n\r\nIn India and China we see the most marvelous of the knife-jugglers.\r\n\r\nWith unerring skill they keep in motion many pointed knives, always\r\nreceiving them at their fall by the handles. They throw their\r\nimplements with such precision that one often sees men, who, placing\r\ntheir partner against a soft board, will stand at some distance and so\r\npen him in with daggers that he cannot move until some are withdrawn,\r\nmarking a silhouette of his form on the board,--yet never once does one\r\nas much as graze the skin. With these same people the foot-jugglers are\r\nmost common. These persons, both made and female, will with their feet\r\njuggle substances and articles that it requires several assistants to\r\nraise.\r\n\r\nA curious trick is given by Rousselet in his magnificent work entitled\r\n\"L'Inde des Rajahs,\" and quoted by Guyot-Daubes. It is called in India\r\nthe \"dance of the eggs.\" The dancer, dressed in a rather short skirt,\r\nplaces on her head a large wheel made of light wood, and at regular\r\nintervals having hanging from it pieces of thread, at the ends of which\r\nare running knots kept open by beads of glass. She then brings forth a\r\nbasket of eggs, and passes them around for inspection to assure her\r\nspectators of their genuineness. The monotonous music commences and the\r\ndancer sets the wheel on her head in rapid motion; then, taking an egg,\r\nwith a quick movement she puts it on one of the running knots and\r\nincreases the velocity of the revolution of the wheel by gyrations\r\nuntil the centrifugal force makes each cord stand out in an almost\r\nhorizontal line with the circumference of the wheel.  Then one after\r\nanother she places the eggs on the knots of the cord, until all are\r\nflying about her head in an almost horizontal position. At this moment\r\nthe dance begins, and it is almost impossible to distinguish the\r\nfeatures of the dancer. She continues her dance, apparently indifferent\r\nto the revolving eggs. At the velocity with which they revolve the\r\nslightest false movement would cause them to knock against one another\r\nand surely break. Finally, with the same lightning-like movements, she\r\nremoves them one by one, certainly the most delicate part of the trick,\r\nuntil they are all safely laid away in the basket from which they came,\r\nand then she suddenly brings the wheel to a stop; after this wonderful\r\nperformance, lasting possibly thirty minutes, she bows herself out.\r\n\r\nA unique Japanese feat is to tear pieces of paper into the form of\r\nbutterflies and launch them into the air about a vase full of flowers;\r\nthen with a fan to keep them in motion, making them light on the\r\nflowers, fly away, and return, after the manner of several living\r\nbutterflies, without allowing one to fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nMarksmen.--It would be an incomplete paper on the acute development of\r\nthe senses that did not pay tribute to the men who exhibit marvelous\r\nskill with firearms. In the old frontier days in the Territories, the\r\nwoodsmen far eclipsed Tell with his bow or Robin Hood's famed band by\r\ntheir unerring aim with their rifles. It is only lately that there\r\ndisappeared in this country the last of many woodsmen, who, though\r\nstanding many paces away and without the aid of the improved sights of\r\nmodern guns, could by means of a rifle-ball, with marvelous precision,\r\ndrive a nail \"home\" that had been placed partly in a board. The experts\r\nwho shoot at glass balls rarely miss, and when we consider the number\r\nused each year, the proportion of inaccurate shots is surprisingly\r\nsmall. Ira Paine, Doctor Carver, and others have been seen in their\r\nmarvelous performances by many people of the present generation. The\r\nrecords made by many of the competitors of the modern army-shooting\r\nmatches are none the less wonderful, exemplifying as they do the degree\r\nof precision that the eye may attain and the control which may be\r\ndeveloped over the nerves and muscles. The authors know of a countryman\r\nwho successfully hunted squirrels and small game by means of pebbles\r\nthrown with his hand.\r\n\r\nPhysiologic wonders are to be found in all our modern sports and games.\r\nIn billiards, base-ball, cricket, tennis, etc., there are experts who\r\nare really physiologic curiosities. In the trades and arts we see\r\ndevelopment of the special senses that is little less than marvelous.\r\nIt is said that there are workmen in Krupp's gun factory in Germany who\r\nhave such control over the enormous trip hammers that they can place a\r\nwatch under one and let the hammer fall, stopping it with unerring\r\nprecision just on the crystal. An expert tool juggler in one of the\r\ngreat English needle factories, in a recent test of skill, performed\r\none of the most delicate mechanical feats imaginable. He took a common\r\nsewing needle of medium size (length 1 5/8 inches) and drilled a hole\r\nthrough its entire length from eye to point--the opening being just\r\nlarge enough to admit the passage of a very fine hair. Another workman\r\nin a watch-factory of the United States drilled a hole through a hair\r\nof his beard and ran a fiber of silk through it.\r\n\r\nVentriloquists, or \"two-voiced men,\" are interesting anomalies of the\r\npresent day; it is common to see a person who possesses the power of\r\nspeaking with a voice apparently from the epigastrium.  Some acquire\r\nthis faculty, while with others it is due to a natural resonance,\r\nformed, according to Dupont, in the space between the third and fourth\r\nribs and their cartilaginous union and the middle of the first portion\r\nof the sternum. Examination of many of these cases proves that the\r\nvibration is greatest here. It is certain that ventriloquists have\r\nexisted for many centuries. It is quite possible that some of the old\r\nPagan oracles were simply the deceptions of priests by means of\r\nventriloquism.\r\n\r\nDupont, Surgeon-in-chief of the French Army about a century since,\r\nexamined minutely an individual professing to be a ventriloquist. With\r\na stuffed fox on his lap near his epigastrium, he imitated a\r\nconversation with the fox. By lying on his belly, and calling to some\r\none supposed to be below the surface of the ground, he would imitate an\r\nanswer seeming to come from the depths of the earth. With his belly on\r\nthe ground he not only made the illusion more complete, but in this way\r\nhe smothered \"the epigastric voice.\"\r\n\r\nHe was always noticed to place the inanimate objects with which he held\r\nconversations near his umbilicus.\r\n\r\nVentriloquists must not be confounded with persons who by means of\r\nskilful mechanisms, creatures with movable fauces, etc., imitate\r\nventriloquism. The latter class are in no sense of the word true\r\nventriloquists, but simulate the anomaly by quickly changing the tones\r\nof their voice in rapid succession, and thus seem to make their puppets\r\ntalk in many different voices. After having acquired the ability to\r\nsuddenly change the tone of their voice, they practice imitations of\r\nthe voices of the aged, of children, dialects, and feminine tones, and,\r\nwith a set of mechanical puppets, are ready to appear as\r\nventriloquists. By contraction of the pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles\r\nthey also imitate tones from a distance. Some give their performance\r\nwith little labial movement, but close inspection of the ordinary\r\nperformer of this class shows visible movements of his lips. The true\r\nventriloquist pretends only to speak from the belly and needs no\r\nmechanical assistance.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful powers of mimicry displayed by expert ventriloquists are\r\nmarvelous; they not only imitate individuals and animals, but do not\r\nhesitate to imitate a conglomeration of familiar sounds and noises in\r\nsuch a manner as to deceive their listeners into believing that they\r\nhear the discussions of an assemblage of people. The following\r\ndescription of an imitation of a domestic riot by a Chinese\r\nventriloquist is given by the author of \"The Chinaman at Home\" and well\r\nillustrates the extent of their abilities: \"The ventriloquist was\r\nseated behind a screen, where there were only a chair, a table, a fan,\r\nand a ruler. With this ruler he rapped on the table to enforce silence,\r\nand when everybody had ceased speaking there was suddenly heard the\r\nbarking of a dog. Then we heard the movements of a woman. She had been\r\nwaked by the dog and was shaking her husband. We were just expecting to\r\nhear the man and wife talking together when a child began to cry. To\r\npacify it the mother gave it food; we could hear it drinking and crying\r\nat the same time. The mother spoke to it soothingly and then rose to\r\nchange its clothes.  Meanwhile another child had wakened and was\r\nbeginning to make a noise. The father scolded it, while the baby\r\ncontinued crying.  By-and-by the whole family went back to bed and fell\r\nasleep. The patter of a mouse was heard. It climbed up some vase and\r\nupset it. We heard the clatter of the vase as it fell. The woman\r\ncoughed in her sleep. Then cries of \"Fire! fire!\" were heard. The mouse\r\nhad upset the lamp; the bed curtains were on fire. The husband and wife\r\nwaked up, shouted, and screamed, the children cried, people came\r\nrunning and shouting. Children cried, dogs barked, squibs and crackers\r\nexploded. The fire brigade came racing up. Water was pumped up in\r\ntorrents and hissed in the flames. The representation was so true to\r\nlife that every one rose to his feet and was starting away when a\r\nsecond blow of the ruler on the table commanded silence. We rushed\r\nbehind the screen, but there was nothing there except the\r\nventriloquist, his table, his chair, and his ruler.\"\r\n\r\nAthletic Feats.--The ancients called athletes those who were noted for\r\ntheir extraordinary agility, force, and endurance. The history of\r\nathletics is not foreign to that of medicine, but, on the contrary, the\r\ntwo are in many ways intimately blended. The instances of feats of\r\nagility and endurance are in every sense of the word examples of\r\nphysiologic and functional anomalies, and have in all times excited the\r\ninterest and investigation of capable physicians.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were famous for their love of athletic pastimes; and\r\nclassical study serves powerfully to strengthen the belief that no\r\ninstitution exercised greater influence than the public contests of\r\nGreece in molding national character and producing that admirable type\r\nof personal and intellectual beauty that we see reflected in her art\r\nand literature. These contests were held at four national festivals,\r\nthe Olympian, the Pythian, the Nemean, and the Isthmean games. On these\r\noccasions every one stopped labor, truce was declared between the\r\nStates, and the whole country paid tribute to the contestants for the\r\nhighly-prized laurels of these games. Perhaps the enthusiasm shown in\r\nathletics and interest in physical development among the Greeks has\r\nnever been equaled by any other people. Herodotus and all the Greek\r\nwriters to Plutarch have elaborated on the glories of the Greek\r\nathlete, and tell us of the honors rendered to the victors by the\r\nspectators and the vanquished, dwelling with complacency on the fact\r\nthat in accepting the laurel they cared for nothing but honor. The\r\nRomans in \"ludi publici,\" as they called their games, were from first\r\nto last only spectators; but in Greece every eligible person was an\r\nactive participant. In the regimen of diet and training the physicians\r\nfrom the time of Hippocrates, and even before, have been the\r\noriginators and professional advisers of the athlete. The change in the\r\nmanner of living of athletes, if we can judge from the writings of\r\nHippocrates, was anterior to his time; for in Book V of the \"Epidemics\"\r\nwe read of Bias, who, \"suapte nature vorax, in choleram-morbum incidit\r\nex carnium esu, praecipueque suillarum crudarum, etc.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the well-known fable of the hero who, by practicing\r\ndaily from his birth, was able to lift a full-grown bull, thus\r\ngradually accustoming himself to the increased weight, physiologists\r\nand scientists have collaborated with the athlete in evolving the\r\npresent ideas and system of training. In his aphorisms Hippocrates\r\nbears witness to the dangers of over-exercise and superabundant\r\ntraining, and Galen is particularly averse to an art which so\r\npreternaturally develops the constitution and nature of man; many\r\nsubsequent medical authorities believed that excessive development of\r\nthe human frame was necessarily followed by a compensatory shortening\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThe foot-race was the oldest of the Greek institutions, and in the\r\nfirst of the Olympiads the \"dromos,\" a course of about 200 yards, was\r\nthe only contest; but gradually the \"dialos,\" in which the course was\r\ndouble that of the dromos, was introduced, and, finally, tests of\r\nendurance as well as speed were instituted in the long-distance races\r\nand the contests of racing in heavy armor, which were so highly\r\ncommended by Plato as preparation for the arduous duties of a soldier.\r\nAmong the Greeks we read of Lasthenes the Theban, who vanquished a\r\nhorse in the course; of Polymnestor, who chased and caught a hare; and\r\nPhilonides, the courier of Alexander the Great, who in nine hours\r\ntraversed the distance between the Greek cities Sicyone and Elis, a\r\ndistance of over 150 miles. We read of the famous soldier of Marathon,\r\nwho ran to announce the victory to the Magistrates of Athens and fell\r\ndead at their feet. In the Olympian games at Athens in 1896 this\r\ndistance (about 26 miles) was traversed in less than three hours.\r\n\r\nIt is said of Euchidas, who carried the fire necessary for the\r\nsacrifices which were to replace those which the Persians had spoiled,\r\nthat he ran a thousand stadia (about 125 miles) and fell dead at the\r\nend of his mission. The Roman historians have also recited the\r\nextraordinary feats of the couriers of their times.  Pliny speaks of an\r\nathlete who ran 235 kilometers (almost 150 miles) without once\r\nstopping. He also mentions a child who ran almost half this distance.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the Turks had couriers of almost supernatural\r\nagility and endurance. It is said that the distance some of them would\r\ntraverse in twenty-four hours was 120 miles, and that it was common for\r\nthem to make the round trip from Constantinople to Adrianople, a\r\ndistance of 80 leagues, in two days. They were dressed very lightly,\r\nand by constant usage the soles of their feet were transformed into a\r\nleathery consistency. In the last century in the houses of the rich\r\nthere were couriers who preceded the carriages and were known as\r\n\"Basques,\" who could run for a very long time without apparent fatigue.\r\nIn France there is a common proverb, \"Courir comme un Basque.\" Rabelais\r\nsays: \"Grand-Gousier depeche le Basque son laquais pour querir\r\nGargantua en toute hate.\"\r\n\r\nIn the olden times the English nobility maintained running footmen who,\r\nliving under special regimen and training, were enabled to traverse\r\nunusual distances without apparent fatigue.  There is an anecdote of a\r\nnobleman living in a castle not far from Edinburgh, who one evening\r\ncharged his courier to carry a letter to that city. The next morning\r\nwhen he arose he found this valet sleeping in his antechamber. The\r\nnobleman waxed wroth, but the courier gave him a response to the\r\nletter. He had traveled 70 miles during the night. It is said that one\r\nof the noblemen under Charles II in preparing for a great dinner\r\nperceived that one of the indispensable pieces of his service was\r\nmissing. His courier was dispatched in great haste to another house in\r\nhis domain, 15 miles distant, and returned in two hours with the\r\nnecessary article, having traversed a distance of over 30 miles. It is\r\nalso said that a courier carrying a letter to a London physician\r\nreturned with the potion prescribed within twenty-four hours, having\r\ntraversed 148 miles. There is little doubt of the ability of these\r\ncouriers to tire out any horse. The couriers who accompany the\r\ndiligences in Spain often fatigue the animals who draw the vehicles.\r\n\r\nAt the present time in this country the Indians furnish examples of\r\nmarvelous feats of running. The Tauri-Mauri Indians, who live in the\r\nheart of the Sierra Madre Mountains, are probably the most wonderful\r\nlong-distance runners in the world. Their name in the language of the\r\nmountain Mexicans means foot-runners; and there is little doubt that\r\nthey perform athletic feats which equal the best in the days of the\r\nOlympian games. They are possibly the remnants of the wonderful runners\r\namong the Indian tribes in the beginning of this century. There is an\r\naccount of one of the Tauri-Mauri who was mail carrier between\r\nGuarichic and San Jose de los Cruces, a distance of 50 miles of as\r\nrough, mountainous road as ever tried a mountaineer's lungs and limbs.\r\nBareheaded and barelegged, with almost no clothing, this man made this\r\ntrip each day, and, carrying on his back a mail-pouch weighing 40\r\npounds, moved gracefully and easily over his path, from time to time\r\nincreasing his speed as though practicing, and then again more slowly\r\nto smoke a cigarette. The Tauri-Mauri are long-limbed and slender,\r\ngiving the impression of being above the average height. There is\r\nscarcely any flesh on their puny arms, but their legs are as muscular\r\nas those of a greyhound. In short running they have the genuine\r\nprofessional stride, something rarely seen in other Indian racers. In\r\ntraversing long distances they leap and bound like deer.\r\n\r\n\"Deerfoot,\" the famous Indian long-distance runner, died on the\r\nCattaraugus Reservation in January, 1896. His proper name was Louis\r\nBennett, the name \"Deerfoot\" having been given to him for his prowess\r\nin running. He was born on the reservation in 1828.  In 1861 he went to\r\nEngland, where he defeated the English champion runners. In April,\r\n1863, he ran 11 miles in London in fifty-six minutes fifty-two seconds,\r\nand 12 miles in one hour two minutes and two and one-half seconds, both\r\nof which have stood as world's records ever since.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, at the present day, the popular method of conveyance, both in\r\ncities and in rural districts, is the two-wheeled vehicle, looking like\r\na baby-carriage, known to foreigners as the jinrickisha, and to the\r\nnatives as the kuruma. In the city of Tokio there is estimated to be\r\n38,000 of these little carriages in use. They are drawn by coolies, of\r\nwhose endurance remarkable stories are told. These men wear light\r\ncotton breeches and a blue cotton jacket bearing the license number,\r\nand the indispensable umbrella hat. In the course of a journey in hot\r\nweather the jinrickisha man will gradually remove most of his raiment\r\nand stuff it into the carriage. In the rural sections he is covered\r\nwith only two strips of cloth, one wrapped about his head and the other\r\nabout his loins. It is said that when the roadway is good, these \"human\r\nhorses\" prefer to travel bare-footed; when working in the mud they wrap\r\na piece of straw about each big toe, to prevent slipping and to give\r\nthem a firmer grip. For any of these men a five-mile spurt on a good\r\nroad without a breathing spell is a small affair. A pair of them will\r\nroll a jinrickisha along a country road at the rate of four miles an\r\nhour, and they will do this eight hours a day. The general average of\r\nthe distance traversed in a day is 25 miles. Cockerill, who has\r\nrecently described these men, says that the majority of them die early.\r\nThe terrible physical strain brings on hypertrophy and valvular\r\ndiseases of the heart, and many of them suffer from hernia.\r\nOccasionally one sees a veteran jinrickisha man, and it is interesting\r\nto note how tenderly he is helped by his confreres.  They give him\r\npreference as regards wages, help push his vehicle up heavy grades, and\r\nshow him all manner of consideration.\r\n\r\nFigure 180 represents two Japanese porters and their usual load, which\r\nis much more difficult to transport than a jinrickisha carriage. In\r\nother Eastern countries, palanquins and other means of conveyance are\r\nstill borne on the shoulders of couriers, and it is not so long since\r\nour ancestors made their calls in Sedan-chairs borne by sturdy porters.\r\n\r\nSome of the letter-carriers of India make a daily journey of 30 miles.\r\nThey carry in one hand a stick, at the extremity of which is a ring\r\ncontaining several little plates of iron, which, agitated during the\r\ncourse, produce a loud noise designed to keep off ferocious beasts and\r\nserpents. In the other hand they carry a wet cloth, with which they\r\nfrequently refresh themselves by wiping the countenance. It is said\r\nthat a regular Hindustanee carrier, with a weight of 80 pounds on his\r\nshoulder,--carried, of course, in two divisions, hung on his neck by a\r\nyoke,--will, if properly paid, lope along over 100 miles in twenty-four\r\nhours--a feat which would exhaust any but the best trained runners.\r\n\r\nThe \"go-as-you-please\" pedestrians, whose powers during the past years\r\nhave been exhibited in this country and in England, have given us\r\nmarvelous examples of endurance, over 600 miles having been\r\naccomplished in a six-days' contest. Hazael, the professional\r\npedestrian, has run over 450 miles in ninety-nine hours, and Albert has\r\ntraveled over 500 miles in one hundred and ten hours. Rowell, Hughes,\r\nand Fitzgerald have astonishingly high records for long-distance\r\nrunning, comparing favorably with the older, and presumably mythical,\r\nfeats of this nature. In California, C. A. Harriman of Truckee in\r\nApril, 1883, walked twenty-six hours without once resting, traversing\r\n122 miles.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of comparison we give the best modern records for\r\nrunning:--\r\n\r\n100 Yards.--9 3/5 seconds, made by Edward Donavan, at Natick, Mass.,\r\nSeptember 2, 1895.\r\n\r\n220 Yards.--21 3/5 seconds, made by Harry Jewett, at Montreal,\r\nSeptember 24, 1892.\r\n\r\nQuarter-Mile.--47 3/4 seconds, made by W. Baker, at Boston, Mass., July\r\n1, 1886.\r\n\r\nHalf-Mile.--1 minute 53 2/3 seconds, made by C. J. Kirkpatrick, at\r\nManhattan Field, New York, September 21, 1895.\r\n\r\n1 Mile.--4 minutes 12 3/4 seconds, made by W. G. George, at London,\r\nEngland, August 23, 1886.\r\n\r\n5 Miles.--24 minutes 40 seconds, made by J. White, in England, May 11,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n10 Miles.--51 minutes 6 3/5 seconds, made by William Cummings, at\r\nLondon, England, September 18,1895.\r\n\r\n25 Miles.--2 hours 33 minutes 44 seconds, made by G. A. Dunning, at\r\nLondon, England, December 26, 1881.\r\n\r\n50 Miles.--5 hours 55 minutes 4 1/2 seconds, made by George Cartwright,\r\nat London, England, February 21, 1887.\r\n\r\n75 Miles.--8 hours 48 minutes 30 seconds, made by George Littlewood, at\r\nLondon, England, November 24, 1884.\r\n\r\n100 Miles.--13 hours 26 minutes 30 seconds, made by Charles Rowell at\r\nNew York, February 27, 1882.\r\n\r\nIn instances of long-distance traversing, rapidity is only a secondary\r\nconsideration, the remarkable fact being in the endurance of fatigue\r\nand the continuity of the exercise. William Gale walked 1500 miles in a\r\nthousand consecutive hours, and then walked 60 miles every twenty-four\r\nhours for six weeks on the Lillie Bridge cinder path. He was five feet\r\nfive inches tall, forty-nine years of age, and weighed 121 pounds, and\r\nwas but little developed muscularly. He was in good health during his\r\nfeat; his diet for the twenty-four hours was 16 pounds of meat, five or\r\nsix eggs, some cocoa, two quarts of milk, a quart of tea, and\r\noccasionally a glass of bitter ale, but never wine nor spirits. Strange\r\nto say, he suffered from constipation, and took daily a compound\r\nrhubarb pill. He was examined at the end of his feat by Gant. His pulse\r\nwas 75, strong, regular, and his heart was normal. His temperature was\r\n97.25 degrees F., and his hands and feet warm; respirations were deep\r\nand averaged 15 a minute.  He suffered from frontal headache and was\r\ndrowsy. During the six weeks he had lost only seven pounds, and his\r\nappetite maintained its normal state.\r\n\r\nZeuner of Cincinnati refers to John Snyder of Dunkirk, whose\r\nwalking-feats were marvelous. He was not an impostor. During\r\nforty-eight hours he was watched by the students of the Ohio Medical\r\nCollege, who stated that he walked constantly; he assured them that it\r\ndid not rest him to sit down, but made him uncomfortable. The\r\ncelebrated Weston walked 5000 miles in one hundred days, but Snyder was\r\nsaid to have traveled 25,000 miles in five hundred days and was\r\napparently no more tired than when he began.\r\n\r\nRecently there was a person who pushed a wheelbarrow from San Francisco\r\nto New York in one hundred and eighteen days. In 1809 the celebrated\r\nCaptain Barclay wagered that he could walk 1000 miles in one thousand\r\nconsecutive hours, and gained his bet with some hours to spare. In 1834\r\nErnest Mensen astonished all Europe by his pedestrian exploits. He was\r\na Norwegian sailor, who wagered that he could walk from Paris to Moscow\r\nin fifteen days.  On June 25, 1834, at ten o'clock A.M., he entered the\r\nKremlin, after having traversed 2500 kilometers (1550 miles) in\r\nfourteen days and eighteen hours. His performances all over Europe were\r\nso marvelous as to be almost incredible. In 1836, in the service of the\r\nEast India Company, he was dispatched from Calcutta to Constantinople,\r\nacross Central Asia. He traversed the distance in fifty-nine days,\r\naccomplishing 9000 kilometers (5580 miles) in one-third less time than\r\nthe most rapid caravan. He died while attempting to discover the source\r\nof the Nile, having reached the village of Syang.\r\n\r\nA most marvelous feat of endurance is recorded in England in the first\r\npart of this century. It is said that on a wager Sir Andrew Leith Hay\r\nand Lord Kennedy walked two days and a night under pouring rain, over\r\nthe Grampian range of mountains, wading all one day in a bog. The\r\ndistance traversed was from a village called Banchory on the river Dee\r\nto Inverness. This feat was accomplished without any previous\r\npreparation, both men starting shortly after the time of the wager.\r\n\r\nRiders.--The feats of endurance accomplished by the couriers who ride\r\ngreat distances with many changes of horses are noteworthy.  According\r\nto a contemporary medical journal there is, in the Friend of India, an\r\naccount of the Thibetan couriers who ride for three weeks with\r\nintervals of only half an hour to eat and change horses. It is the duty\r\nof the officials at the Dak bungalows to see that the courier makes no\r\ndelay, and even if dying he is tied to his horse and sent to the next\r\nstation. The celebrated English huntsman, \"Squire\" Osbaldistone, on a\r\nwager rode 200 miles in seven hours ten minutes and four seconds. He\r\nused 28 horses; and as one hour twenty-two minutes and fifty-six\r\nseconds were allowed for stoppages, the whole time, changes and all,\r\noccupied in accomplishing this wonderful feat was eight hours and\r\nforty-two minutes. The race was ridden at the Newmarket Houghton\r\nMeeting over a four-mile course. It is said that a Captain Horne of the\r\nMadras Horse Artillery rode 200 miles on Arab horses in less than ten\r\nhours along the road between Madras and Bangalore. When we consider the\r\nslower speed of the Arab horses and the roads and climate of India,\r\nthis performance equals the 200 miles in the shorter time about an\r\nEnglish race track and on thoroughbreds. It is said that this wonderful\r\nhorseman lost his life in riding a horse named \"Jumping Jenny\" 100\r\nmiles a day for eight days. The heat was excessive, and although the\r\nhorse was none the worse for the performance, the Captain died from the\r\nexposure he encountered. There is a record of a Mr. Bacon of the Bombay\r\nCivil Service, who rode one camel from Bombay to Allygur (perhaps 800\r\nmiles) in eight days.\r\n\r\nAs regards the physiology of the runners and walkers, it is quite\r\ninteresting to follow the effects of training on the respiration,\r\nwhereby in a measure is explained the ability of these persons to\r\nmaintain their respiratory function, although excessively exercising. A\r\ncurious discussion, persisted in since antiquity, is as to the supposed\r\ninfluence of the spleen on the ability of couriers. For ages runners\r\nhave believed that the spleen was a hindrance to their vocation, and\r\nthat its reduction was followed by greater agility on the course. With\r\nsome, this opinion is perpetuated to the present day. In France there\r\nis a proverb, \"Courir comme un derate.\" To reduce the size of the\r\nspleen, the Greek athletes used certain beverages, the composition of\r\nwhich was not generally known; the Romans had a similar belief and\r\nhabit Pliny speaks of a plant called equisetum, a decoction of which\r\ntaken for three days after a fast of twenty-four hours would effect\r\nabsorption of the spleen. The modern pharmacopeia does not possess any\r\nsubstance having a similar virtue, although quinin has been noticed to\r\ndiminish the size of the spleen when engorged in malarial fevers.\r\nStrictly speaking, however, the facts are not analogous. Hippocrates\r\nadvises a moxa of mushrooms applied over the spleen for melting or\r\ndissolving it. Godefroy Moebius is said to have seen in the village of\r\nHalberstadt a courier whose spleen had been cauterized after incision;\r\nand about the same epoch (seventeenth century) some men pretended to be\r\nable to successfully extirpate the spleen for those who desired to be\r\ncouriers. This operation we know to be one of the most delicate in\r\nmodern surgery, and as we are progressing with our physiologic\r\nknowledge of the spleen we see nothing to justify the old theory in\r\nregard to its relations to agility and coursing.\r\n\r\nSwimming.--The instances of endurance that we see in the aquatic sports\r\nare equally as remarkable as those that we find among the runners and\r\nwalkers. In the ancient days the Greeks, living on their various\r\nislands and being in a mild climate, were celebrated for their prowess\r\nas swimmers. Socrates relates the feats of swimming among the\r\ninhabitants of Delos. The journeys of Leander across the Hellespont are\r\nwell celebrated in verse and prose, but this feat has been easily\r\naccomplished many times since, and is hardly to be classed as\r\nextraordinary. Herodotus says that the Macedonians were skilful\r\nswimmers; and all the savage tribes about the borders of waterways are\r\nfound possessed of remarkable dexterity and endurance in swimming.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the celebrated Captain Webb swam from Dover to Calais. On\r\nlanding he felt extremely cold, but his body was as warm as when he\r\nstarted. He was exhausted and very sleepy, falling in deep slumber on\r\nhis way to the hotel. On getting into bed his temperature was 98\r\ndegrees F. and his pulse normal. In five hours he was feverish, his\r\ntemperature rising to 101 degrees F. During the passage he was blinded\r\nfrom the salt water in his eyes and the spray beating against his face.\r\nHe strongly denied the newspaper reports that he was delirious, and\r\nafter a good rest was apparently none the worse for the task. In 1876\r\nhe again traversed this passage with the happiest issue. In 1883 he was\r\nengaged by speculators to swim the rapids at Niagara, and in attempting\r\nthis was overcome by the powerful currents, and his body was not\r\nrecovered for some days after. The passage from Dover to Calais has\r\nbeen duplicated.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Cavill, another Englishman, swam from Cape Griz-Nez to South\r\nForland in less than thirteen hours. In 1880 Webb swam and floated at\r\nScarborough for seventy-four consecutive hours--of course, having no\r\ncurrent to contend with and no point to reach.  This was merely a feat\r\nof staying in the water. In London in 1881, Beckwith, swimming ten\r\nhours a day over a 32-lap course for six days, traversed 94 miles.\r\nSince the time of Captain Webb, who was the pioneer of modern\r\nlong-distance swimming, many men have attempted and some have\r\nduplicated his feats; but these foolhardy performances have in late\r\nyears been diminishing, and many of the older feats are forbidden by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nJumpers and acrobatic tumblers have been popular from the earliest\r\ntime. By the aid of springing boards and weights in their hands, the\r\nold jumpers covered great distances. Phayllus of Croton is accredited\r\nwith jumping the incredible distance of 55 feet, and we have the\r\nauthority of Eustache and Tzetzes that this jump is genuine. In the\r\nwritings of many Greek and Roman historians are chronicled jumps of\r\nabout 50 feet by the athletes; if they are true, the modern jumpers\r\nhave greatly degenerated. A jump of over 20 feet to-day is considered\r\nvery clever, the record being 29 feet seven inches with weights, and 23\r\nfeet eight inches without weights, although much greater distances have\r\nbeen jumped with the aid of apparatus, but never an approximation to 50\r\nfeet.  The most surprising of all these athletes are the tumblers, who\r\nturn somersaults over several animals arranged in a row. Such feats are\r\nnot only the most amusing sights of a modern circus, but also the most\r\ninteresting as well. The agility of these men is marvelous, and the\r\nforce with which they throw themselves in the air apparently enables\r\nthem to defy gravity. In London, Paris, or New York one may see these\r\nwonderful tumblers and marvel at the capabilities of human physical\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1895, M. F. Sweeney, an American amateur, at Manhattan\r\nField in New York jumped six feet 5 5/8 inches high in the running high\r\njump without weights. With weights, J. H.  Fitzpatrick at Oak Island,\r\nMass., jumped six feet six inches high. The record for the running high\r\nkick is nine feet eight inches, a marvelous performance, made by C. C.\r\nLee at New Haven, Conn., March 19, 1887.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary physical development and strength has been a grand means\r\nof natural selection in the human species. As Guyot-Daubes remarks, in\r\nprehistoric times, when our ancestors had to battle against hunger,\r\nsavage beasts, and their neighbors, and when the struggle for existence\r\nwas so extremely hard, the strong man alone resisted and the weak\r\nsuccumbed. This natural selection has been perpetuated almost to our\r\nday; during the long succession of centuries, the chief or the master\r\nwas selected on account of his being the strongest, or the most valiant\r\nin the combat.  Originally, the cavaliers, the members of the nobility,\r\nwere those who were noted for their courage and strength, and to them\r\nwere given the lands of the vanquished. Even in times other than those\r\nof war, disputes of succession were settled by jousts and tourneys.\r\nThis fact is seen in the present day among the lower animals, who in\r\ntheir natural state live in tribes; the leader is usually the\r\nstrongest, the wisest, and the most courageous.\r\n\r\nThe strong men of all times have excited the admiration of their\r\nfellows and have always been objects of popular interest. The Bible\r\ncelebrates the exploits of Samson of the tribe of Dan.  During his\r\nyouth he, single handed, strangled a lion; with the jaw-bone of an ass\r\nhe is said to have killed 1000 Philistines and put the rest to flight.\r\nAt another time during the night he transported from the village of\r\nGaza enormous burdens and placed them on the top of a mountain.\r\nBetrayed by Delilah, he was delivered into the hands of his enemies and\r\nemployed in the most servile labors. When old and blind he was attached\r\nto the columns of an edifice to serve as an object of public ridicule;\r\nwith a violent effort he overturned the columns, destroying himself and\r\n3000 Philistines.\r\n\r\nIn the Greek mythology we find a great number of heroes, celebrated for\r\ntheir feats of strength and endurance. Many of them have received the\r\nname of Hercules; but the most common of these is the hero who was\r\nsupposed to be the son of Jupiter and Alemena. He was endowed with\r\nprodigious strength by his father, and was pursued with unrelenting\r\nhatred by Juno. In his infancy he killed with his hands the serpents\r\nwhich were sent to devour him. The legends about him are innumerable.\r\nHe was said to have been armed with a massive club, which only he was\r\nable to carry.  The most famous of his feats were the twelve labors,\r\nwith which all readers of mythology are familiar. Hercules,\r\npersonified, meant to the Greeks physical force as well as strength,\r\ngenerosity, and bravery, and was equivalent to the Assyrian Hercules.\r\nThe Gauls had a Hercules-Pantopage, who, in addition to the ordinary\r\nqualities attributed to Hercules, had an enormous appetite.\r\n\r\nAs late as the sixteenth century, and in a most amusing and picturesque\r\nmanner, Rabelais has given us the history of Gargantua, and even to\r\nthis day, in some regions, there are groups of stones which are\r\nbelieved by ignorant people to have been thrown about by Gargantua in\r\nhis play. In their citations the older authors often speak of battles,\r\nand in epic ballads of heroes with marvelous strength. In the army of\r\nCharlemagne, after Camerarius, and quoted by Guyot-Daubes (who has made\r\nan extensive collection of the literature on this subject and to whom\r\nthe authors are indebted for much information), there was found a giant\r\nnamed Oenother, a native of a village in Suabia, who performed\r\nmarvelous feats of strength. In his history of Bavaria Aventin speaks\r\nof this monster. To Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne, the legends\r\nattributed prodigious strength; and, dying in the valley of\r\nRoncesveaux, he broke his good sword \"Durandal\" by striking it against\r\na rock, making a breach, which is stilled called the \"Breche de\r\nRoland.\" Three years before his death, on his return from Palestine,\r\nChristopher, Duke of Bavaria, was said to have lifted to his shoulders\r\na stone which weighed more than 340 pounds. Louis de Boufflers,\r\nsurnamed the \"Robust,\" who lived in 1534, was noted for his strength\r\nand agility. When he placed his feet together, one against the other,\r\nhe could find no one able to disturb them. He could easily bend and\r\nbreak a horseshoe with his hands, and could seize an ox by the tail and\r\ndrag it against its will. More than once he was said to have carried a\r\nhorse on his shoulders. According to Guyot-Daubes there was, in the\r\nlast century, a Major Barsaba who could seize the limb of a horse and\r\nfracture its bone. There was a tale of his lifting an iron anvil, in a\r\nblacksmith's forge, and placing it under his coat.\r\n\r\nTo the Emperor Maximilian I was ascribed enormous strength; even in his\r\nyouth, when but a simple patriot, he vanquished, at the games given by\r\nSeverus, 16 of the most vigorous wrestlers, and accomplished this feat\r\nwithout stopping for breath. It is said that this feat was the origin\r\nof his fortune. Among other celebrated persons in history endowed with\r\nuncommon strength were Edmund \"Ironsides,\" King of England; the Caliph\r\nMostasem-Billah; Baudouin, \"Bras-de-Fer,\" Count of Flanders; William\r\nIV, called by the French \"Fier-a-Bras,\" Duke of Aquitaine; Christopher,\r\nson of Albert the Pious, Duke of Bavaria; Godefroy of Bouillon; the\r\nEmperor Charles IV; Scanderbeg; Leonardo da Vinci; Marshal Saxe; and\r\nthe recently deceased Czar of Russia, Alexander III.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the authentic modern Hercules, we have a man by the name\r\nof Eckeberg, born in Anhalt, and who traveled under the name of\r\n\"Samson.\" He was exhibited in London, and performed remarkable feats of\r\nstrength. He was observed by the celebrated Desaguliers (a pupil of\r\nNewton) in the commencement of the last century, who at that time was\r\ninterested in the physiologic experiments of strength and agility.\r\nDesaguliers believed that the feats of this new Samson were more due to\r\nagility than strength. One day, accompanied by two of his confreres,\r\nalthough a man of ordinary strength, he duplicated some of Samson's\r\nfeats, and followed his performance by a communication to the Royal\r\nSociety. One of his tricks was to resist the strength of five or six\r\nmen or of two horses. Desaguliers claimed that this was entirely due to\r\nthe position taken. This person would lift a man by one foot, and bear\r\na heavy weight on his chest when resting with his head and two feet on\r\ntwo chairs. By supporting himself with his arms he could lift a piece\r\nof cannon attached to his feet.\r\n\r\nA little later Desaguliers studied an individual in London named Thomas\r\nTopham, who used no ruse in his feats and was not the skilful\r\nequilibrist that the German Samson was, his performances being merely\r\nthe results of abnormal physical force. He was about thirty years old,\r\nfive feet ten inches in height and well proportioned, and his muscles\r\nwell developed, the strong ligaments showing under the skin. He ignored\r\nentirely the art of appearing supernaturally strong, and some of his\r\nfeats were rendered difficult by disadvantageous positions. In the feat\r\nof the German--resisting the force of several men or horses--Topham\r\nexhibited no knowledge of the principles of physics, like that of his\r\npredecessor, but, seated on the ground and putting his feet against two\r\nstirrups, he was able to resist the traction of a single horse; when he\r\nattempted the same feat against two horses he was severely strained and\r\nwounded about the knees. According to Desaguliers, if Topham had taken\r\nthe advantageous positions of the German Samson, he could have resisted\r\nnot only two, but four horses. On another occasion, with the aid of a\r\nbridle passed about his neck, he lifted three hogsheads full of water,\r\nweighing 1386 pounds. If he had utilized the force of his limbs and his\r\nloins, like the German, he would have been able to perform far more\r\ndifficult feats. With his teeth he could lift and maintain in a\r\nhorizontal position a table over six feet long, at the extremity of\r\nwhich he would put some weight. Two of the feet of the table he rested\r\non his knees. He broke a cord five cm. in diameter, one part of which\r\nwas attached to a post and the other to a strap passed under his\r\nshoulder. He was able to carry in his hands a rolling-pin weighing 800\r\npounds, about twice the weight a strong man is considered able to lift.\r\n\r\nTom Johnson was another strong man who lived in London in the last\r\ncentury, but he was not an exhibitionist, like his predecessors. He was\r\na porter on the banks of the Thames, his duty being to carry sacks of\r\nwheat and corn from the wharves to the warehouses. It was said that\r\nwhen one of his comrades was ill, and could not provide support for his\r\nwife and children, Johnson assumed double duty, carrying twice the\r\nload. He could seize a sack of wheat, and with it execute the movements\r\nof a club-swinger, and with as great facility. He became quite a\r\ncelebrated boxer, and, besides his strength, he soon demonstrated his\r\npowers of endurance, never seeming fatigued after a lively bout. The\r\nporters of Paris were accustomed to lift and carry on their shoulders\r\nbags of flour weighing 159 kilograms (350 pounds) and to mount stairs\r\nwith them. Johnson, on hearing this, duplicated the feat with three\r\nsacks, and on one occasion attempted to carry four, and resisted this\r\nload some little time.  These four sacks weighed 1400 pounds.\r\n\r\nSome years since there was a female Hercules who would get on her hands\r\nand knees under a carriage containing six people, and, forming an arch\r\nwith her body, she would lift it off the ground, an attendant turning\r\nthe wheels while in the air to prove that they were clear from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nGuyot-Daubes considers that one of the most remarkable of all the men\r\nnoted for their strength was a butcher living in the mountains of\r\nMargeride, known as Lapiada (the extraordinary).  This man, whose\r\nstrength was legendary in the neighboring country, one day seized a mad\r\nbull that had escaped from his stall and held him by the horns until\r\nhis attendants could bind him. For amusement he would lie on his belly\r\nand allow several men to get on his back; with this human load he would\r\nrise to the erect position. One of Lapiada's great feats was to get\r\nunder a cart loaded with hay and, forming an arch with his body, raise\r\nit from the ground, then little by little he would mount to his\r\nhaunches, still holding the cart and hay. Lapiada terminated his\r\nHerculean existence in attempting a mighty effort. Having charged\r\nhimself alone with the task of placing a heavy tree-trunk in a cart, he\r\nseized it, his muscles stiffened, but the blood gushed from his mouth\r\nand nostrils, and he fell, overcome at last. The end of Lapiada\r\npresents an analogue to that of the celebrated athlete, Polydamas, who\r\nwas equally the victim of too great confidence in his muscular force,\r\nand who died crushed by the force that he hoped to maintain. Figures\r\n181 and 183 portray the muscular development of an individual noted for\r\nhis feats of strength, and who exhibited not long since.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have had Sebastian Miller, whose specialty was\r\nwrestling and stone-breaking; Samson, a recent English exhibitionist,\r\nLouis Cyr, and Sandow, who, in addition to his remarkable strength and\r\ncontrol over his muscles, is a very clever gymnast. Sandow gives an\r\nexcellent exposition of the so-called \"checkerboard\" arrangement of the\r\nmuscular fibers of the lower thoracic and abdominal regions, and in a\r\nbrilliant light demonstrates his extraordinary power over his muscles,\r\ncontracting muscles ordinarily involuntary in time with music, a feat\r\nreally more remarkable than his exhibition of strength.  Figures 182\r\nand 184 show the beautiful muscular development of this remarkable man.\r\n\r\nJoseph Pospischilli, a convict recently imprisoned in the Austrian\r\nfortress of Olen, surprised the whole Empire by his wonderful feats of\r\nstrength. One of his tricks was to add a fifth leg to a common table\r\n(placing the useless addition in the exact center) and then balance it\r\nwith his teeth while two full-grown gipsies danced on it, the music\r\nbeing furnished by a violinist seated in the middle of the\r\nwell-balanced platform. One day when the prison in which this Hercules\r\nwas confined was undergoing repairs, he picked up a large carpenter's\r\nbench with his teeth and held it balanced aloft for nearly a minute.\r\nSince being released from the Olen prison, Pospischilli and his cousin,\r\nanother local \"strong man\" named Martenstine, have formed a combination\r\nand are now starring Southern Europe, performing all kinds of startling\r\nfeats of strength. Among other things they have had a 30-foot bridge\r\nmade of strong timbers, which is used in one of their great muscle\r\nacts. This bridge has two living piers--Pospischilli acting as one and\r\nMartenstine the other.  Besides supporting this monstrous structure\r\n(weight, 1866 pounds) upon their shoulders, these freaks of superhuman\r\nstrength allow a team of horses and a wagon loaded with a ton of\r\ncobble-stones to be driven across it.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Selig Whitman, known as \"Ajax,\" a New York policeman,\r\nhas lifted 2000 pounds with his hands and has maintained 450 pounds\r\nwith his teeth. This man is five feet 8 1/2 inches tall and weighs 162\r\npounds. His chest measurement is 40 inches, the biceps 17 inches, that\r\nof his neck 16 1/2 inches, the forearm 11, the wrist 9 1/2, the thigh\r\n23, and the calf 17.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest of the \"strong women\" is Madame Elise, a\r\nFrenchwoman, who performs with her husband. Her greatest feat is the\r\nlifting of eight men weighing altogether about 1700 pounds.  At her\r\nperformances she supports across her shoulders a 700-pound dumb-bell,\r\non each side of which a person is suspended.\r\n\r\nMiss Darnett, the \"singing strong lady,\" extends herself upon her hands\r\nand feet, face uppermost, while a stout platform, with a semicircular\r\ngroove for her neck, is fixed upon her chest, abdomen, and thighs by\r\nmeans of a waist-belt which passes through brass receivers on the under\r\nside of the board. An ordinary upright piano is then placed on the\r\nplatform by four men; a performer mounts the platform and plays while\r\nthe \"strong lady\" sings a love song while supporting possibly half a\r\nton.\r\n\r\nStrength of the Jaws.--There are some persons who exhibit extraordinary\r\npower of the jaw. In the curious experiments of Regnard and Blanchard\r\nat the Sorbonne, it was found that a crocodile weighing about 120\r\npounds exerted a force between its jaws at a point corresponding to the\r\ninsertion of the masseter muscles of 1540 pounds; a dog of 44 pounds\r\nexerted a similar force of 363 pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that in animals like the tiger and lion the force\r\nwould equal 1700 or 1800 pounds. The anthropoid apes can easily break a\r\ncocoanut with their teeth, and Guyot-Daubes thinks that possibly a\r\ngorilla has a jaw-force of 200 pounds. A human adult is said to exert a\r\nforce of from 45 to 65 pounds between his teeth, and some individuals\r\nexceed this average as much as 100 pounds. In Buffon's experiments he\r\nonce found a Frenchman who could exert a force of 534 pounds with his\r\njaws.\r\n\r\nIn several American circuses there have been seen women who hold\r\nthemselves by a strap between their teeth while they are being hauled\r\nup to a trapeze some distance from the ground. A young mulatto girl by\r\nthe name of \"Miss Kerra\" exhibited in the Winter Circus in Paris;\r\nsuspended from a trapeze, she supported a man at the end of a strap\r\nheld between her teeth, and even permitted herself to be turned round\r\nand round.\r\n\r\nShe also held a cannon in her teeth while it was fired. This feat has\r\nbeen done by several others. According to Guyot-Daubes, at Epernay in\r\n1882, while a man named Bucholtz, called \"the human cannon,\" was\r\nperforming this feat, the cannon, which was over a yard long and\r\nweighed nearly 200 pounds, burst and wounded several of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThere was another Hercules in Paris, who with his teeth lifted and held\r\na heavy cask of water on which was seated a man and varying weights,\r\naccording to the size of his audience, at the same time keeping his\r\nhands occupied with other weights. Figure 185 represents a well-known\r\nmodern exhibitionist lifting with his teeth a cask on which are seated\r\nfour men. The celebrated Mlle.  Gauthier, an actress of the\r\nComedie-Francais, had marvelous power of her hands, bending coins,\r\nrolling up silver plate, and performing divers other feats. Major\r\nBarsaba had enormous powers of hand and fingers. He could roll a silver\r\nplate into the shape of a goblet. Being challenged by a Gascon, he\r\nseized the hand of his unsuspecting adversary in the ordinary manner of\r\nsalutation and crushed all the bones of the fingers, thus rendering\r\nunnecessary any further trial of strength.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Marshal Saxe once visited a blacksmith ostensibly to\r\nhave his horse shod, and seeing no shoe ready he took a bar of iron,\r\nand with his hands fashioned it into a horseshoe. There are Japanese\r\ndentists who extract teeth with their wonderfully developed fingers.\r\nThere are stories of a man living in the village of Cantal who received\r\nthe sobriquet of \"La Coupia\" (The Brutal). He would exercise his\r\nfunction as a butcher by strangling with his fingers the calves and\r\nsheep, instead of killing them in the ordinary manner. It is said that\r\none day, by placing his hands on the shoulders of the strong man of a\r\nlocal fair, he made him faint by the pressure exerted by his fingers.\r\n\r\nManual strangulation is a well-known crime and is quite popular in some\r\ncountries. The Thugs of India sometimes murdered their victims in this\r\nway. Often such force is exerted by the murderer's fingers as to\r\ncompletely fracture the cricoid cartilage.\r\n\r\nIn viewing the feats of strength of the exhibitionist we must bear in\r\nconsideration the numerous frauds perpetrated. A man of extraordinary\r\nstrength sometimes finds peculiar stone, so stratified that he is able\r\nto break it with the force he can exert by a blow from the hand alone,\r\nalthough a man of ordinary strength would try in vain. In most of these\r\ninstances, if one were to take a piece of the exhibitionist's stone, he\r\nwould find that a slight tap of the hammer would break it. Again, there\r\nare many instances in which the stone has been found already separated\r\nand fixed quite firmly together, placing it out of the power of an\r\nordinary man to break, but which the exhibitionist finds within his\r\nability. This has been the solution of the feats of many of the\r\nindividuals who invite persons to send them marked stones to use at\r\ntheir performances. By skilfully arranging stout twine on the hands, it\r\nis surprising how easily it is broken, and there are many devices and\r\ntricks to deceive the public, all of which are more or less used by\r\n\"strong men.\"\r\n\r\nThe recent officially recorded feats of strength that stand unequaled\r\nin the last decade are as follows:--\r\n\r\nWeight-lifting.--Hands alone 1571 1/4 pounds, done by C. G.  Jefferson,\r\nan amateur, at Clinton, Mass December 10, 1890; with harness, 3239\r\npounds, by W B. Curtis, at New York December 20 1868; Louis Cyr, at\r\nBerthierville, Can., October 1, 1888, pushed up 3536 pounds of pig-iron\r\nwith his back, arms, and legs.\r\n\r\nDumb-bells.--H. Pennock, in New York, 1870, put up a 10-pound dumb-bell\r\n8431 times in four hours thirty-four minutes; by using both hands to\r\nraise it to the shoulder, and then using one hand alone, R. A. Pennell,\r\nin New York, January 31, 1874, managed to put up a bell weighing 201\r\npounds 5 ounces; and Eugene Sandow, at London, February 11, 1891,\r\nsurpassed this feat with a 250-pound bell.\r\n\r\nThrowing 16-pound hammer.--J. S. Mitchell, at Travers Island, N.  Y.,\r\nOctober 8, 1892, made a record-throw of 145 feet 3/4 inch.\r\n\r\nPutting 16-pound Shot.--George R. Gray, at Chicago, September 16, 1893,\r\nmade the record of 47 feet.\r\n\r\nThrowing 50-pound Weight.--J. S. Mitchell, at New York, September 22,\r\n1894, made the distance record of 35 feet 10 inches; and at Chicago,\r\nSeptember 16, 1893, made the height record of 15 feet 4 1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nThe class of people commonly known as contortionists by the laxity of\r\ntheir muscles and ligaments are able to dislocate or preternaturally\r\nbend their joints. In entertainments of an arena type and even in what\r\nare now called \"variety performances\" are to be seen individuals of\r\nthis class. These persons can completely straddle two chairs, and do\r\nwhat they call \"the split;\" they can place their foot about their neck\r\nwhile maintaining the upright position; they can bend almost double at\r\nthe waist in such a manner that the back of the head will touch the\r\ncalves, while the legs are perpendicular with the ground; they can\r\nbring the popliteal region over their shoulders and in this position\r\nwalk on their hands; they can put themselves in a narrow barrel; eat\r\nwith a fork attached to a heel while standing on their hands, and\r\nperform divers other remarkable and almost incredible feats. Their\r\nperformances are genuine, and they are real physiologic curiosities.\r\nPlate 6 represents two well-known contortionists in their favorite\r\nfeats.\r\n\r\nWentworth, the oldest living contortionist, is about seventy years of\r\nage, but seems to have lost none of his earlier sinuosity. His chief\r\nfeat is to stow himself away in a box 23 X 29 X 16 inches. When inside,\r\nsix dozen wooden bottles of the same size and shape as those which\r\nordinarily contain English soda water are carefully stowed away, packed\r\nin with him, and the lid slammed down. He bestows upon this act the\r\ncurious and suggestive name of \"Packanatomicalization.\"\r\n\r\nAnother class of individuals are those who can either partially or\r\ncompletely dislocate the major articulations of the body. Many persons\r\nexhibit this capacity in their fingers. Persons vulgarly called \"double\r\njointed\" are quite common.\r\n\r\nCharles Warren, an American contortionist, has been examined by several\r\nmedical men of prominence and descriptions of him have appeared from\r\ntime to time in prominent medical journals. When he was but a child he\r\nwas constantly tumbling down, due to the heads of the femurs slipping\r\nfrom the acetabula, but reduction was always easy. When eight years old\r\nhe joined a company of acrobats and strolling performers, and was\r\ncalled by the euphonious title of \"the Yankee dish-rag.\" His muscular\r\nsystem was well-developed, and, like Sandow, he could make muscles act\r\nin concert or separately.\r\n\r\nHe could throw into energetic single action the biceps, the supinator\r\nlongus, the radial extensors, the platysma myoides, and many other\r\nmuscles. When he \"strings,\" as he called it, the sartorius, that ribbon\r\nmuscle shows itself as a tight cord, extending from the front of the\r\niliac spine to the inner side of the knee. Another trick was to leave\r\nflaccid that part of the serratus magnus which is attached to the\r\ninferior angle of the scapula whilst he roused energetic contraction in\r\nthe rhomboids.  He could displace his muscles so that the lower angles\r\nof the scapulae projected and presented the appearance historically\r\nattributed to luxation of the scapula.\r\n\r\nWarren was well informed on surgical landmarks and had evidently been a\r\nclose student of Sir Astley Cooper's classical illustrations of\r\ndislocations. He was able so to contract his abdominal muscles that the\r\naorta could be distinctly felt with the fingers. In this feat nearly\r\nall the abdominal contents were crowded beneath the diaphragm. On the\r\nother hand, he could produce a phantom abdominal tumor by driving the\r\ncoils of the intestine within a peculiar grasp of the rectus and\r\noblique muscles. The \"growth\" was rounded, dull on percussion, and\r\nlooked as if an exploratory incision or puncture would be advisable for\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nBy extraordinary muscular power and extreme laxity of his ligaments, he\r\nsimulated all the dislocations about the hip joint.  Sometimes he\r\nproduced actual dislocation, but usually he said he could so distort\r\nhis muscles as to imitate in the closest degree the dislocations. He\r\ncould imitate the various forms of talipes, in such a way as to deceive\r\nan expert. He dislocated nearly every joint in the body with great\r\nfacility. It was said that he could contract at will both pillars of\r\nthe fauces. He could contract his chest to 34 inches and expand it to\r\n41 inches.\r\n\r\nWarren weighed 150 pounds, was a total abstainer, and was the father of\r\ntwo children, both of whom could readily dislocate their hips.\r\n\r\nIn France in 1886 there was shown a man who was called \"l'homme\r\nprotee,\" or protean man. He had an exceptional power over his muscles.\r\nEven those muscles ordinarily involuntary he could exercise at will. He\r\ncould produce such rigidity of stature that a blow by a hammer on his\r\nbody fell as though on a block of stone. By his power over his\r\nabdominal muscles he could give himself different shapes, from the\r\nportly alderman to the lean and haggard student, and he was even\r\naccredited with assuming the shape of a \"living skeleton.\" Quatrefages,\r\nthe celebrated French scientist, examined him, and said that he could\r\nshut off the blood from the right side and then from the left side of\r\nthe body, which feat he ascribed to unilateral muscular action.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 there appeared in Washington, giving exhibitions at the\r\ncolleges there and at the Emergency Hospital, a man named Fitzgerald,\r\nclaiming to reside in Harrisburg, Pa., who made his living by\r\nexhibiting at medical colleges over the country. He simulated all the\r\ndislocations, claiming that they were complete, using manual force to\r\nproduce and reduce them. He exhibited a thorough knowledge of the\r\npathology of dislocations and of the anatomy of the articulations. He\r\nproduced the different forms of talipes, as well as all the major\r\nhip-dislocations. When interrogated as to the cause of his enormous\r\nsaphenous veins, which stood out like huge twisted cords under the skin\r\nand were associated with venous varicosity on the leg, he said he\r\npresumed they were caused by his constantly compressing the saphenous\r\nvein at the hip in giving his exhibitions, which in some large cities\r\nwere repeated several times a day.\r\n\r\nEndurance of Pain.--The question of the endurance of pain is,\r\nnecessarily, one of comparison. There is little doubt that in the lower\r\nclasses the sensation of pain is felt in a much less degree than in\r\nthose of a highly intellectual and nervous temperament.  If we\r\neliminate the element of fear, which always predominates in the lower\r\nclasses, the result of general hospital observation will show this\r\ndistinction. There are many circumstances which have a marked influence\r\non pain. Patriotism, enthusiasm, and general excitement, together with\r\npride and natural obstinacy, prove the power of the mind over the body.\r\nThe tortures endured by prisoners of war, religious martyrs and\r\nvictims, exemplify the power of a strong will excited by deep emotion\r\nover the sensation of pain. The flagellants, persons who expiated their\r\nsins by voluntarily flaying themselves to the point of exhaustion, are\r\nmodern examples of persons who in religious enthusiasm inflict pain on\r\nthemselves. In the ancient times in India the frenzied zealots\r\nstruggled for positions from which they could throw themselves under\r\nthe car of the Juggernaut, and their intense emotions turned the pains\r\nof their wounds into a pleasure.  According to the reports of her\r\nMajesty's surgeons, there are at the present time in India native\r\nBrahmins who hang themselves on sharp hooks placed in the flesh between\r\nthe scapulae, and remain in this position without the least visible\r\nshow of pain. In a similar manner they pierce the lips and cheeks with\r\nlong pins and bore the tongue with a hot iron. From a reliable source\r\nthe authors have an account of a man in Northern India who as a means\r\nof self-inflicted penance held his arm aloft for the greater part of\r\neach day, bending the fingers tightly on the palms. After a\r\nconsiderable time the nails had grown or been forced through the palms\r\nof the hands, making their exit on the dorsal surfaces.  There are many\r\nsavage rites and ceremonies calling for the severe infliction of pain\r\non the participants which have been described from time to time by\r\ntravelers. The Aztecs willingly sacrificed even their lives in the\r\nworship of their Sun-god.\r\n\r\nBy means of singing and dancing the Aissaoui, in the Algerian town of\r\nConstantine, throw themselves into an ecstatic state in which their\r\nbodies seem to be insensible even to severe wounds.  Hellwald says they\r\nrun sharp-pointed irons into their heads, eyes, necks, and breasts\r\nwithout apparent pain or injury to themselves. Some observers claim\r\nthey are rendered insensible to pain by self-induced hypnotism.\r\n\r\nAn account by Carpenter of the Algerian Aissaoui contained the\r\nfollowing lucid description of the performances of these people:--\r\n\r\n\"The center of the court was given up to the Aissaoui. These were 12\r\nhollow-checked men, some old and some young, who sat cross-legged in an\r\nirregular semicircle on the floor. Six of them had immense flat drums\r\nor tambours, which they presently began to beat noisily. In front of\r\nthem a charcoal fire burned in a brazier, and into it one of them from\r\ntime to time threw bits of some sort of incense, which gradually filled\r\nthe place with a thin smoke and a mildly pungent odor.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time--it seemed a long time--this went on with nothing to\r\nbreak the silence but the rhythmical beat of the drums. Gradually,\r\nhowever, this had become quicker, and now grew wild and almost\r\ndeafening, and the men began a monotonous chant which soon was\r\nincreased to shouting. Suddenly one of the men threw himself with a\r\nhowl to the ground, when he was seized by another, who stripped him of\r\npart of his garments and led him in front of the fire. Here, while the\r\npounding of the drums and the shouts of the men became more and more\r\nfrantic, he stood swaying his body backward and forward, almost\r\ntouching the ground in his fearful contortions, and wagging his head\r\nuntil it seemed as if he must dislocate it from his shoulders. All at\r\nonce he drew from the fire a red-hot bar of iron, and with a yell of\r\nhorror, which sent a shiver down one's back, held it up before his\r\neyes. More violently than ever he swayed his body and wagged his head,\r\nuntil he had worked himself up to a climax of excitement, when he\r\npassed the glowing iron several times over the palm of each hand and\r\nthen licked it repeatedly with his tongue. He next took a burning coal\r\nfrom the fire, and, placing it between his teeth, fanned it by his\r\nbreath into a white heat. He ended his part of the performance by\r\ntreading on red-hot coals scattered on the floor after which he resumed\r\nhis place with the rest. Then the next performer with a yell as before,\r\nsuddenly sprang to his feet and began again the same frantic\r\ncontortions, in the midst of which he snatched from the fire an iron\r\nrod with a ball on one end, and after winding one of his eyelids around\r\nit until the eyeball was completely exposed, he thrust its point in\r\nbehind the eye, which was forced far out on his cheek. It was held\r\nthere for a moment when it was withdrawn, the eye released, and then\r\nrubbed vigorously a few times with the balled end of the rod.\r\n\r\n\"The drums all the time had been beaten lustily, and the men had kept\r\nup their chant, which still went unceasingly on. Again a man sprang to\r\nhis feet and went through the same horrid motions. This time the\r\nperformer took from the fire a sharp nail and, with a piece of the\r\nsandy limestone common to this region, proceeded with a series of\r\nblood-curdling howls to hammer it down into the top of his head, where\r\nit presently stuck upright, while he tottered dizzily around until it\r\nwas pulled out with apparent effort and with a hollow snap by one of\r\nthe other men.\r\n\r\n\"The performance had now fairly begun, and, with short intervals and\r\nalways in the same manner, the frenzied contortions first, another ate\r\nup a glass lamp-chimney, which he first broke in pieces in his hands\r\nand then crunched loudly with his teeth. He then produced from a tin\r\nbox a live scorpion, which ran across the floor with tail erect, and\r\nwas then allowed to attach itself to the back of his hand and his face,\r\nand was finally taken into his mouth, where it hung suspended from the\r\ninside of his cheek and was finally chewed and swallowed. A sword was\r\nnext produced, and after the usual preliminaries it was drawn by the\r\nsame man who had just given the scorpion such unusual opportunities\r\nseveral times back and forth across his throat and neck, apparently\r\ndeeply imbedded in the flesh. Not content with this, he bared his body\r\nat his waist, and while one man held the sword, edge upward, by the\r\nhilt and another by the point, about which a turban had been wrapped,\r\nhe first stood upon it with his bare feet and then balanced himself\r\nacross it on his naked stomach, while still another of the performers\r\nstood upon his back, whither he had sprung without any attempt to\r\nmollify the violence of the action. With more yells and genuflections,\r\nanother now drew from the fire several iron skewers, some of which he\r\nthrust into the inner side of his cheeks and others into his throat at\r\nthe larynx, where they were left for a while to hang.\r\n\r\n\"The last of the actors in this singular entertainment was a stout man\r\nwith a careworn face, who apparently regarded his share as a melancholy\r\nduty which he was bound to perform, and the last part of it, I have no\r\ndoubt, was particularly painful. He first took a handful of hay, and,\r\nhaving bared the whole upper part of his body, lighted the wisp at the\r\nbrazier and then passed the blazing mass across his chest and body and\r\nover his arms and face. This was but a preliminary, and presently he\r\nbegan to sway backward and forward until one grew dazed with watching\r\nhim. The drums grew noisier and noisier and the chant louder and\r\nwilder.  The man himself had become maudlin, his tongue hung from his\r\nmouth, and now and then he ejaculated a sound like the inarticulate cry\r\nof an animal. He could only totter to the fire, out of which he\r\nsnatched the balled instrument already described, which he thereupon\r\nthrust with a vicious stab into the pit of his stomach, where it was\r\nleft to hang. A moment after he pulled it out again, and, picking up\r\nthe piece of stone used before, he drove it with a series of resounding\r\nblows into a new place, where it hung, drawing the skin downward with\r\nits weight, until a companion pulled it out and the man fell in a heap\r\non the floor.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day it is only through the intervention of the United States troops\r\nthat some of the barbarous ceremonies of the North American Indians are\r\nsuppressed. The episode of the \"Ghost-dance\" is fresh in every mind.\r\nInstances of self-mutilation, although illustrating this subject, will\r\nbe discussed at length in Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\nMalingerers often endure without flinching the most arduous tests.\r\nSupraorbital pressure is generally of little avail, and pinching,\r\npricking, and even incision are useless with these hospital impostors.\r\nIt is reported that in the City Hospital of St. Louis a negro submitted\r\nto the ammonia-test, inhaling this vapor for several hours without\r\nshowing any signs of sensibility, and made his escape the moment his\r\nguard was absent. A contemporary journal says:--\r\n\r\n\"The obstinacy of resolute impostors seems, indeed, capable of\r\nemulating the torture-proof perseverance of religious enthusiasts and\r\nsuch martyrs of patriotism as Mueius Scaevola or Grand Master Ruediger\r\nof the Teutonic Knights, who refused to reveal the hiding place of his\r\ncompanion even when his captors belabored him with red-hot irons.\r\n\r\n\"One Basil Rohatzek, suspected of fraudulent enlistment\r\n(bounty-jumping, as our volunteers called it), pretended to have been\r\nthrown by his horse and to have been permanently disabled by a\r\nparalysis of the lower extremities. He dragged himself along in a\r\npitiful manner, and his knees looked somewhat bruised, but he was known\r\nto have boasted his ability to procure his discharge somehow or other.\r\nOne of his tent mates had also seen him fling himself violently and\r\nrepeatedly on his knees (to procure those questionable bruises), and on\r\nthe whole there seemed little doubt that the fellow was shamming. All\r\nthe surgeons who had examined him concurred in that view, and the case\r\nwas finally referred to his commanding officer, General Colloredo. The\r\nimpostor was carried to a field hospital in a little Bohemian border\r\ntown and watched for a couple of weeks, during which he had been twice\r\nseen moving his feet in his sleep. Still, the witnesses were not\r\nprepared to swear that those changes of position might not have been\r\neffected by a movement of the whole body. The suspect stuck to his\r\nassertion, and Colloredo, in a fit of irritation, finally summoned a\r\nsurgeon, who actually placed the feet of the professed paralytic in\r\n\"aqua fortis,\" but even this rigorous method availed the cruel surgeon\r\nnothing, and he was compelled to advise dismissal from the service.\r\n\r\n\"The martyrdom of Rohatzek, however, was a mere trifle compared with\r\nthe ordeal by which the tribunal of Paris tried in vain to extort a\r\nconfession of the would-be regicide, Damiens. Robert Damiens, a native\r\nof Arras, had been exiled as an habitual criminal, and returning in\r\ndisguise made an attempt upon the life of Louis XV, January 5, 1757.\r\nHis dagger pierced the mantle of the King, but merely grazed his neck.\r\nDamiens, who had stumbled, was instantly seized and dragged to prison,\r\nwhere a convocation of expert torturers exhausted their ingenuity in\r\nthe attempt to extort a confession implicating the Jesuits, a\r\nconspiracy of Huguenots, etc. But Damiens refused to speak. He could\r\nhave pleaded his inability to name accomplices who did not exist, but\r\nhe stuck to his resolution of absolute silence. They singed off his\r\nskin by shreds, they wrenched out his teeth and finger-joints, they\r\ndragged him about at the end of a rope hitched to a team of stout\r\nhorses, they sprinkled him from head to foot with acids and seething\r\noil, but Damiens never uttered a sound till his dying groan announced\r\nthe conclusion of the tragedy.\"\r\n\r\nThe apparent indifference to the pain of a major operation is sometimes\r\nmarvelous, and there are many interesting instances on record. When at\r\nthe battle of Dresden in 1813 Moreau, seated beside the Emperor\r\nAlexander, had both limbs shattered by a French cannon-ball, he did not\r\nutter a groan, but asked for a cigar and smoked leisurely while a\r\nsurgeon amputated one of his members. In a short time his medical\r\nattendants expressed the danger and questionability of saving his other\r\nlimb, and consulted him. In the calmest way the heroic General\r\ninstructed them to amputate it, again remaining unmoved throughout the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nCrompton records a case in which during an amputation of the leg not a\r\nsound escaped from the patient's lips, and in three weeks, when it was\r\nfound necessary to amputate the other leg, the patient endured the\r\noperation without an anesthetic, making no show of pain, and only\r\nremarking that he thought the saw did not cut well. Crompton quotes\r\nanother case, in which the patient held a candle with one hand while\r\nthe operator amputated his other arm at the shoulder-joint. Several\r\ninstances of self-performed major operations are mentioned in Chapter\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nSupersensitiveness to Pain.--Quite opposite to the foregoing instances\r\nare those cases in which such influences as expectation, naturally\r\ninherited nervousness, and genuine supersensitiveness make the\r\nslightest pain almost unendurable. In many of these instances the state\r\nof the mind and occasionally the time of day have a marked influence.\r\nMen noted for their sagacity and courage have been prostrated by fear\r\nof pain. Sir Robert Peel, a man of acknowledged superior physical and\r\nintellectual power, could not even bear the touch of Brodie's finger to\r\nhis fractured clavicle. The authors know of an instance of a pugilist\r\nwho had elicited admiration by his ability to stand punishment and his\r\nindomitable courage in his combats, but who fainted from the puncture\r\nof a small boil on his neck.\r\n\r\nThe relation of pain to shock has been noticed by many writers.  Before\r\nthe days of anesthesia, such cases as the following, reported by Sir\r\nAstley Cooper, seem to have been not unusual: A brewer's servant, a man\r\nof middle age and robust frame, suffered much agony for several days\r\nfrom a thecal abscess, occasioned by a splinter of wood beneath the\r\nthumb. A few seconds after the matter was discharged by an incision,\r\nthe man raised himself by a convulsive effort from his bed and\r\ninstantly expired.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that powerful nerve-irritation, such as\r\nproduces shock, is painless, and this accounts for the fact that wounds\r\nreceived during battle are not painful.\r\n\r\nLeyden of Berlin showed to his class at the Charite Hospital a number\r\nof hysteric women with a morbid desire for operation without an\r\nanesthetic. Such persons do not seem to experience pain, and, on the\r\ncontrary, appear to have genuine pleasure in pain. In illustration,\r\nLeyden showed a young lady who during a hysteric paroxysm had suffered\r\na serious fracture of the jaw, injuring the facial artery, and\r\nnecessitating quite an extensive operation. The facial and carotid\r\narteries had to be ligated and part of the inferior maxilla removed,\r\nbut the patient insisted upon having the operations performed without\r\nan anesthetic, and afterward informed the operator that she had\r\nexperienced great pleasure throughout the whole procedure.\r\n\r\nPain as a Means of Sexual Enjoyment.--There is a form of sexual\r\nperversion in which the pervert takes delight in being subjected to\r\ndegrading, humiliating, and cruel acts on the part of his or her\r\nassociate. It was named masochism from Sacher-Masoch, an Austrian\r\nnovelist, whose works describe this form of perversion.  The victims\r\nare said to experience peculiar pleasure at the sight of a rival who\r\nhas obtained the favor of their mistress, and will even receive blows\r\nand lashes from the rival with a voluptuous mixture of pain and\r\npleasure. Masochism corresponds to the passivism of Stefanowski, and is\r\nthe opposite of sadism, in which the pleasure is derived from\r\ninflicting pain on the object of affection. Krafft-Ebing cites several\r\ninstances of masochism.\r\n\r\nAlthough the enjoyment and frenzy of flagellation are well known, its\r\npleasures are not derived from the pain but by the undoubted\r\nstimulation offered to the sexual centers by the castigation. The\r\ndelight of the heroines of flagellation, Maria Magdalena of Pazzi and\r\nElizabeth of Genton, in being whipped on the naked loins, and thus\r\ncalling up sensual and lascivious fancies, clearly shows the\r\nsignificance of flagellation as a sexual excitant. It is said that when\r\nElizabeth of Genton was being whipped she believed herself united with\r\nher ideal and would cry out in the loudest tones of the joys of love.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly a sympathetic communication between the ramifying\r\nnerves of the skin of the loins and the lower portion of the spinal\r\ncord which contains the sexual centers. Recently, in cases of\r\ndysmenorrhea, amenorrhea dysmenorrhagia, and like sexual disorders,\r\nmassage or gentle flagellation of the parts contiguous with the\r\ngenitalia and pelvic viscera has been recommended. Taxil is the\r\nauthority for the statement that just before the sexual act rakes\r\nsometimes have themselves flagellated or pricked until the blood flows\r\nin order to stimulate their diminished sexual power. Rhodiginus,\r\nBartholinus, and other older physicians mention individuals in whom\r\nsevere castigation was a prerequisite of copulation. As a ritual custom\r\nflagellation is preserved to the present day by some sects.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of flagellation it should be stated that\r\namong the serious after-results of this practice as a disciplinary\r\nmeans, fatal emphysema, severe hemorrhage, and shock have been noticed.\r\nThere are many cases of death from corporal punishment by flogging.\r\nBallingal records the death of a soldier from flogging; Davidson has\r\nreported a similar case, and there is a death from the same cause cited\r\nin the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal for 1846.\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasy is a peculiarity of constitution whereby an individual is\r\naffected by external agents in a different manner from others. Begin\r\ndefines idiosyncrasy as the predominance of an organ, of a viscus, or a\r\nsystem of organs. This definition does not entirely grasp the subject.\r\nAn idiosyncrasy is something inherent in the organization of the\r\nindividual, of which we only see the manifestation when proper causes\r\nare set in action. We do not attempt to explain the susceptibility of\r\ncertain persons to certain foods and certain exposures. We know that\r\nsuch is the fact. According to Begin's idea, there is scarcely any\r\nseparation between idiosyncrasy and temperament, whereas from what\r\nwould appear to be sound reasoning, based on the physiology of the\r\nsubject, a very material difference exists.\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasies may be congenital, hereditary, or acquired, and, if\r\nacquired, may be only temporary. Some, purely of mental origin, are\r\noften readily cured. One individual may synchronously possess an\r\nidiosyncrasy of the digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems.\r\nStriking examples of transitory or temporary idiosyncrasies are seen in\r\npregnant women.\r\n\r\nThere are certain so-called antipathies that in reality are\r\nidiosyncrasies, and which are due to peculiarities of the ideal and\r\nemotional centers. The organ of sense in question and the center that\r\ntakes cognizance of the image brought to it are in no way disordered.\r\nIn some cases the antipathy or the idiosyncrasy develops to such an\r\nextent as to be in itself a species of monomania. The fear-maladies, or\r\n\"phobias,\" as they are called, are examples of this class, and,\r\nbelonging properly under temporary mental derangements, the same as\r\nhallucinations or delusions, will be spoken of in another chapter.\r\n\r\nPossibly the most satisfactory divisions under which to group the\r\nmaterial on this subject collected from literature are into examples of\r\nidiosyncrasies in which, although the effect is a mystery, the sense is\r\nperceptible and the cause distinctly defined and known, and those in\r\nwhich sensibility is latent. The former class includes all the peculiar\r\nantipathies which are brought about through the special senses, while\r\nthe latter groups all those strange instances in which, without the\r\nslightest antipathy on the part of the subject, a certain food or drug,\r\nafter ingestion, produces an untoward effect.\r\n\r\nThe first examples of idiosyncrasies to be noticed will be those\r\nmanifested through the sense of smell. On the authority of Spigelius,\r\nwhose name still survives in the nomenclature of the anatomy of the\r\nliver, Mackeuzie quotes an extraordinary case in a Roman Cardinal,\r\nOliver Caraffa, who could not endure the smell of a rose. This is\r\nconfirmed from personal observation by another writer, Pierius, who\r\nadds that the Cardinal was obliged every year to shut himself up during\r\nthe rose season, and guards were stationed at the gates of his palace\r\nto stop any visitors who might be wearing the dreadful flower. It is,\r\nof course, possible that in this case the rose may not have caused the\r\ndisturbance, and as it is distinctly stated that it was the smell to\r\nwhich the Cardinal objected, we may fairly conclude that what annoyed\r\nhim was simply a manifestation of rose-fever excited by the pollen.\r\nThere is also an instance of a noble Venetian who was always confined\r\nto his palace during the rose season. However, in this connection Sir\r\nKenelm Digby relates that so obnoxious was a rose to Lady Heneage, that\r\nshe blistered her cheek while accidentally lying on one while she\r\nslept. Ledelius records the description of a woman who fainted before a\r\nred rose, although she was accustomed to wear white ones in her hair.\r\nCremer describes a Bishop who died of the smell of a rose from what\r\nmight be called \"aromatic pain.\"\r\n\r\nThe organ of smell is in intimate relation with the brain and the\r\norgans of taste and sight; and its action may thus disturb that of the\r\nesophagus, the stomach, the diaphragm, the intestines, the organs of\r\ngeneration, etc. Odorous substances have occasioned syncope, stupor,\r\nnausea, vomiting, and sometimes death. It is said that the Hindoos, and\r\nsome classes who eat nothing but vegetables, are intensely nauseated by\r\nthe odors of European tables, and for this reason they are incapable of\r\nserving as dining-room servants.\r\n\r\nFabricius Hildanus mentions a person who fainted from the odor of\r\nvinegar. The Ephemerides contains an instance of a soldier who fell\r\ninsensible from the odor of a peony. Wagner knew a man who was made ill\r\nby the odor of bouillon of crabs. The odors of blood, meat, and fat are\r\nrepugnant to herbivorous animals. It is a well-known fact that horses\r\ndetest the odor of blood.\r\n\r\nSchneider, the father of rhinology, mentions a woman in whom the odor\r\nof orange-flowers produced syncope. Odier has known a woman who was\r\naffected with aphonia whenever exposed to the odor of musk, but who\r\nimmediately recovered after taking a cold bath.  Dejean has mentioned a\r\nman who could not tolerate an atmosphere of cherries. Highmore knew a\r\nman in whom the slightest smell of musk caused headache followed by\r\nepistaxis. Lanzonius gives an account of a valiant soldier who could\r\nneither bear the sight nor smell of an ordinary pink. There is an\r\ninstance on record in which the odor coming from a walnut tree excited\r\nepilepsy. It is said that one of the secretaries of Francis I was\r\nforced to stop his nostrils with bread if apples were on the table. He\r\nwould faint if one was held near his nose Schenck says that the noble\r\nfamily of Fystates in Aquitaine had a similar peculiarity--an innate\r\nhatred of apples. Bruyerinus knew a girl of sixteen who could not bear\r\nthe smell of bread, the slightest particle of which she would detect by\r\nits odor. She lived almost entirely on milk. Bierling mentions an\r\nantipathy to the smell of musk, and there is a case on record in which\r\nit caused convulsions.  Boerhaave bears witness that the odor of cheese\r\ncaused nasal hemorrhage. Whytt mentions an instance in which tobacco\r\nbecame repugnant to a woman each time she conceived, but after delivery\r\nthis aversion changed to almost an appetite for tobacco fumes.\r\nPanaroli mentions an instance of sickness caused by the smell of\r\nsassafras, and there is also a record of a person who fell helpless at\r\nthe smell of cinnamon. Wagner had a patient who detested the odor of\r\ncitron. Ignorant of this repugnance, he prescribed a potion in which\r\nthere was water of balm-mint, of an odor resembling citron. As soon as\r\nthe patient took the first dose he became greatly agitated and much\r\nnauseated, and this did not cease until Wagner repressed the balm-mint.\r\nThere is reported the case of a young woman, rather robust, otherwise\r\nnormal, who always experienced a desire to go to stool after being\r\nsubjected to any nasal irritation sufficient to excite sneezing.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that individuals and animals have their\r\nspecial odors, certain of which are very agreeable to some people and\r\nextremely unpleasant to others. Many persons are not able to endure the\r\nemanations from cats, rats, mice, etc., and the mere fact of one of\r\nthese animals being in their vicinity is enough to provoke distressing\r\nsymptoms. Mlle. Contat, the celebrated French actress, was not able to\r\nendure the odor of a hare. Stanislaus, King of Poland and Duke of\r\nLorraine, found it impossible to tolerate the smell of a cat. The\r\nEphemerides mentions the odor of a little garden-frog as causing\r\nepilepsy. Ab Heers mentions a similar anomaly, fainting caused by the\r\nsmell of eels. Habit had rendered Haller insensible to the odor of\r\nputrefying cadavers, but according to Zimmerman the odor of the\r\nperspiration of old people, not perceptible to others, was intolerable\r\nto him at a distance of ten or twelve paces. He also had an extreme\r\naversion for cheese. According to Dejan, Gaubius knew a man who was\r\nunable to remain in a room with women, having a great repugnance to the\r\nfemale odor. Strange as it may seem, some individuals are incapable of\r\nappreciating certain odors.  Blumenbach mentions an Englishman whose\r\nsense of smell was otherwise very acute, but he was unable to perceive\r\nthe perfume of the mignonette.\r\n\r\nThe impressions which come to us through the sense of hearing cause\r\nsensations agreeable or disagreeable, but even in this sense we see\r\nmarked examples of idiosyncrasies and antipathies to various sounds and\r\ntones. In some individuals the sensations in one ear differ from those\r\nof the other. Everard Home has cited several examples, and Heidmann of\r\nVienna has treated two musicians, one of whom always perceived in the\r\naffected ear, during damp weather, tones an octave lower than in the\r\nother ear.  The other musician perceived tones an octave higher in the\r\naffected ear. Cheyne is quoted as mentioning a case in which, when the\r\nsubject heard the noise of a drum, blood jetted from the veins with\r\nconsiderable force. Sauvages has seen a young man in whom intense\r\nheadache and febrile paroxysm were only relieved by the noise from a\r\nbeaten drum. Esparron has mentioned an infant in whom an ataxic fever\r\nwas established by the noise of this instrument. Ephemerides contains\r\nan account of a young man who became nervous and had the sense of\r\nsuffocation when he heard the noise made by sweeping. Zimmerman speaks\r\nof a young girl who had convulsions when she heard the rustling of\r\noiled silk. Boyle, the father of chemistry, could not conquer an\r\naversion he had to the sound of water running through pipes. A\r\ngentleman of the Court of the Emperor Ferdinand suffered epistaxis when\r\nhe heard a cat mew.  La Mothe Le Vayer could not endure the sounds of\r\nmusical instruments, although he experienced pleasurable sensations\r\nwhen he heard a clap of thunder. It is said that a chaplain in England\r\nalways had a sensation of cold at the top of his head when he read the\r\n53d chapter of Isaiah and certain verses of the Kings.  There was an\r\nunhappy wight who could not hear his own name pronounced without being\r\nthrown into convulsions. Marguerite of Valois, sister of Francis I,\r\ncould never utter the words \"mort\" or \"petite verole,\" such a horrible\r\naversion had she to death and small-pox. According to Campani, the\r\nChevalier Alcantara could never say \"lana,\" or words pertaining to\r\nwoolen clothing.  Hippocrates says that a certain Nicanor had the\r\ngreatest horror of the sound of the flute at night, although it\r\ndelighted him in the daytime. Rousseau reports a Gascon in whom\r\nincontinence of urine was produced by the sound of a bagpipe. Frisch,\r\nManagetta, and Rousse speak of a man in whom the same effect was\r\nproduced by the sound of a hurdy-gurdy. Even Shakespeare alludes to the\r\neffects of the sound of bagpipes. Tissot mentions a case in which music\r\ncaused epileptic convulsions, and Forestus mentions a beggar who had\r\nconvulsions at the sound of a wooden trumpet similar to those used by\r\nchildren in play. Rousseau mentions music as causing convulsive\r\nlaughter in a woman. Bayle mentions a woman who fainted at the sound of\r\na bell. Paullini cites an instance of vomiting caused by music, and\r\nMarcellus Donatus mentions swooning from the same cause. Many people\r\nare unable to bear the noise caused by the grating of a pencil on a\r\nslate, the filing of a saw, the squeak of a wheel turning about an\r\naxle, the rubbing of pieces of paper together, and certain similar\r\nsounds.  Some persons find the tones of music very disagreeable, and\r\nsome animals, particularly dogs, are unable to endure it. In Albinus\r\nthe younger the slightest perceptible tones were sufficient to produce\r\nan inexplicable anxiety. There was a certain woman of fifty who was\r\nfond of the music of the clarionet and flute, but was not able to\r\nlisten to the sound of a bell or tambourine.  Frank knew a man who ran\r\nout of church at the beginning of the sounds of an organ, not being\r\nable to tolerate them. Pope could not imagine music producing any\r\npleasure. The harmonica has been noticed to produce fainting in\r\nfemales. Fischer says that music provokes sexual frenzy in elephants.\r\nGutfeldt speaks of a peculiar idiosyncrasy of sleep produced by hearing\r\nmusic. Delisle mentions a young person who during a whole year passed\r\npieces of ascarides and tenia, during which time he could not endure\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nAutenreith mentions the vibrations of a loud noise tickling the fauces\r\nto such an extent as to provoke vomiting. There are some emotional\r\npeople who are particularly susceptible to certain expressions. The\r\nwidow of Jean Calas always fell in a faint when she heard the words of\r\nthe death-decree sounded on the street.  There was a Hanoverian officer\r\nin the Indian war against Typoo-Saib, a good and brave soldier, who\r\nwould feel sick if he heard the word \"tiger\" pronounced. It was said\r\nthat he had experienced the ravages of this beast.\r\n\r\nThe therapeutic value of music has long been known. For ages warriors\r\nhave been led to battle to the sounds of martial strains. David charmed\r\naway Saul's evil spirit with his harp.  Horace in his 32d Ode Book 1,\r\nconcludes his address to the lyre:--\r\n\r\n       \"O laborum\r\n  Dulce lenimen mihicumque calve,\r\n  Rite vocanti;\"\r\n\r\nOr, as Kiessling of Berlin interprets:--\r\n\r\n       \"O laborum,\r\n  Dulce lenimen medieumque, salve,\r\n  Rite vocanti.\"\r\n\r\n--\"O, of our troubles the sweet, the healing sedative, etc.\"\r\n\r\nHomer, Plutarch, Theophrastus, and Galen say that music cures\r\nrheumatism, the pests, and stings of reptiles, etc. Diemerbroeck,\r\nBonet, Baglivi, Kercher, and Desault mention the efficacy of melody in\r\nphthisis, gout, hydrophobia, the bites of venomous reptiles, etc. There\r\nis a case in the Lancet of a patient in convulsions who was cured in\r\nthe paroxysm by hearing the tones of music. Before the French Academy\r\nof Sciences in 1708, and again in 1718, there was an instance of a\r\ndancing-master stricken with violent fever and in a condition of\r\ndelirium, who recovered his senses and health on hearing melodious\r\nmusic. There is little doubt of the therapeutic value of music, but\r\nparticularly do we find its value in instances of neuroses. The\r\ninspiration offered by music is well-known, and it is doubtless a\r\nstimulant to the intellectual work. Bacon, Milton, Warburton, and\r\nAlfieri needed music to stimulate them in their labors, and it is said\r\nthat Bourdaloue always played an air on the violin before preparing to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nAccording to the American Medico-Surgical Bulletin, \"Professor\r\nTarchanoff of Saint Petersburg has been investigating the influence of\r\nmusic upon man and other animals. The subject is by no means a new one.\r\nIn recent times Dagiel and Fere have investigated the effect of music\r\nupon the respirations, the pulse, and the muscular system in man.\r\nProfessor Tarchanoff made use of the ergograph of Mosso, and found that\r\nif the fingers were completely fatigued, either by voluntary efforts or\r\nby electric excitation, to the point of being incapable of making any\r\nmark except a straight line on the registering cylinder, music had the\r\npower of making the fatigue disappear, and the finger placed in the\r\nergograph again commenced to mark lines of different heights, according\r\nto the amount of excitation. It was also found that music of a sad and\r\nlugubrious character had the opposite effect, and could check or\r\nentirely inhibit the contractions. Professor Tarchanoff does not\r\nprofess to give any positive explanation of these facts, but he\r\ninclines to the view that 'the voluntary muscles, being furnished with\r\nexcitomotor and depressant fibers, act in relation to the music\r\nsimilarly to the heart--that is to say, that joyful music resounds\r\nalong the excitomotor fibers, and sad music along the depressant or\r\ninhibitory fibers.' Experiments on dogs showed that music was capable\r\nof increasing the elimination of carbonic acid by 16.7 per cent, and of\r\nincreasing the consumption of oxygen by 20.1 per cent. It was also\r\nfound that music increased the functional activity of the skin.\r\nProfessor Tarchanoff claims as the result of these experiments that\r\nmusic may fairly be regarded as a serious therapeutic agent, and that\r\nit exercises a genuine and considerable influence over the functions of\r\nthe body. Facts of this kind are in no way surprising, and are chiefly\r\nof interest as presenting some physiologic basis for phenomena that are\r\nsufficiently obvious.  The influence of the war-chant upon the warrior\r\nis known even to savage tribes. We are accustomed to regard this\r\ninfluence simply as an ordinary case of psychic stimuli producing\r\nphysiologic effects.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Tarchanoff evidently prefers to regard the phenomena as\r\nbeing all upon the same plane, namely, that of physiology; and until we\r\nknow the difference between mind and body, and the principles of their\r\ninteraction, it is obviously impossible to controvert this view\r\nsuccessfully. From the immediately practical point of view we should\r\nnot ignore the possible value of music in some states of disease. In\r\nmelancholia and hysteria it is probably capable of being used with\r\nbenefit, and it is worth bearing in mind in dealing with insomnia.\r\nClassical scholars will not forget that the singing of birds was tried\r\nas a remedy to overcome the insomnia of Maecenas. Music is certainly a\r\ngood antidote to the pernicious habit of introspection and\r\nself-analysis, which is often a curse both of the hysteric and of the\r\nhighly cultured. It would seem obviously preferable to have recourse to\r\nmusic of a lively and cheerful character.\"\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasies of the visual organs are generally quite rare. It is\r\nwell-known that among some of the lower animals, e.g., the\r\nturkey-cocks, buffaloes, and elephants, the color red is unendurable.\r\nBuchner and Tissot mention a young boy who had a paroxysm if he viewed\r\nanything red. Certain individuals become nauseated when they look for a\r\nlong time on irregular lines or curves, as, for examples, in\r\ncaricatures. Many of the older examples of idiosyncrasies of color are\r\nnothing more than instances of color-blindness, which in those times\r\nwas unrecognized. Prochaska knew a woman who in her youth became\r\nunconscious at the sight of beet-root, although in her later years she\r\nmanaged to conquer this antipathy, but was never able to eat the\r\nvegetable in question. One of the most remarkable forms of idiosyncrasy\r\non record is that of a student who was deprived of his senses by the\r\nvery sight of an old woman. On one occasion he was carried out from a\r\nparty in a dying state, caused, presumably, by the abhorred aspect of\r\nthe chaperons The Count of Caylus was always horror-stricken at the\r\nsight of a Capuchin friar. He cured himself by a wooden image dressed\r\nin the costume of this order placed in his room and constantly before\r\nhis view. It is common to see persons who faint at the sight of blood.\r\nAnalogous are the individuals who feel nausea in an hospital ward.\r\n\r\nAll Robert Boyle's philosophy could not make him endure the sight of a\r\nspider, although he had no such aversion to toads, venomous snakes,\r\netc. Pare mentions a man who fainted at the sight of an eel, and\r\nanother who had convulsions at the sight of a carp.  There is a record\r\nof a young lady in France who fainted on seeing a boiled lobster.\r\nMillingen cites the case of a man who fell into convulsions whenever he\r\nsaw a spider. A waxen one was made, which equally terrified him. When\r\nhe recovered, his error was pointed out to him, and the wax figure was\r\nplaced in his hand without causing dread, and henceforth the living\r\ninsect no longer disturbed him. Amatus Lusitanus relates the case of a\r\nmonk who fainted when he beheld a rose, and never quitted his cell when\r\nthat flower was in bloom. Scaliger, the great scholar, who had been a\r\nsoldier a considerable portion of his life, confesses that he could not\r\nlook on a water-cress without shuddering, and remarks: \"I, who despise\r\nnot only iron, but even thunderbolts, who in two sieges (in one of\r\nwhich I commanded) was the only one who did not complain of the food as\r\nunfit and horrible to eat, am seized with such a shuddering horror at\r\nthe sight of a water-cress that I am forced to go away.\" One of his\r\nchildren was in the same plight as regards the inoffensive vegetable,\r\ncabbage.  Scaliger also speaks of one of his kinsmen who fainted at the\r\nsight of a lily. Vaughheim, a great huntsman of Hanover, would faint at\r\nthe sight of a roasted pig. Some individuals have been disgusted at the\r\nsight of eggs. There is an account of a sensible man who was terrified\r\nat the sight of a hedgehog, and for two years was tormented by a\r\nsensation as though one was gnawing at his bowels. According to Boyle,\r\nLord Barrymore, a veteran warrior and a person of strong mind, swooned\r\nat the sight of tansy. The Duke d'Epernon swooned on beholding a\r\nleveret, although a hare did not produce the same effect. Schenck tells\r\nof a man who swooned at the sight of pork. The Ephemerides contains an\r\naccount of a person who lost his voice at the sight of a crab, and also\r\ncites cases of antipathy to partridges, a white hen, to a serpent, and\r\nto a toad. Lehman speaks of an antipathy to horses; and in his\r\nobservations Lyser has noticed aversion to the color purple. It is a\r\nstrange fact that the three greatest generals of recent years,\r\nWellington, Napoleon, and Roberts, could never tolerate the sight of a\r\ncat, and Henry III of France could not bear this animal in his room. We\r\nlearn of a Dane of herculean frame who had a horror of cats. He was\r\nasked to a supper at which, by way of a practical joke, a live cat was\r\nput on the table in a covered dish. The man began to sweat and shudder\r\nwithout knowing why, and when the cat was shown he killed his host in a\r\nparoxysm of terror. Another man could not even see the hated form even\r\nin a picture without breaking into a cold sweat and feeling a sense of\r\noppression about the heart. Quercetanus and Smetius mention fainting at\r\nthe sight of cats. Marshal d'Abret was supposed to be in violent fear\r\nof a pig.\r\n\r\nAs to idiosyncrasies of the sense of touch, it is well known that some\r\npeople cannot handle velvet or touch the velvety skin of a peach\r\nwithout having disagreeable and chilly sensations come over them.\r\nProchaska knew a man who vomited the moment he touched a peach, and\r\nmany people, otherwise very fond of this fruit, are unable to touch it.\r\nThe Ephemerides speaks of a peculiar idiosyncrasy of skin in the axilla\r\nof a certain person, which if tickled would provoke vomiting. It is\r\noccasionally stated in the older writings that some persons have an\r\nidiosyncrasy as regards the phases of the sun and moon. Baillou speaks\r\nof a woman who fell unconscious at sunset and did not recover till it\r\nreappeared on the horizon. The celebrated Chancellor Bacon, according\r\nto Mead, was very delicate, and was accustomed to fall into a state of\r\ngreat feebleness at every moon-set without any other imaginable cause.\r\nHe never recovered from his swooning until the moon reappeared.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common than the idiosyncrasy which certain people\r\ndisplay for certain foods. The trite proverb, \"What is one man's meat\r\nis another man's poison,\" is a genuine truth, and is exemplified by\r\nhundreds of instances. Many people are unable to eat fish without\r\nsubsequent disagreeable symptoms. Prominent among the causes of\r\nurticaria are oysters, crabs, and other shell fish, strawberries,\r\nraspberries, and other fruits. The abundance of literature on this\r\nsubject makes an exhaustive collection of data impossible, and only a\r\nfew of the prominent and striking instances can be reported.\r\n\r\nAmatus Lusitanus speaks of vomiting and diarrhea occurring each time a\r\ncertain Spaniard ate meat. Haller knew a person who was purged\r\nviolently by syrup of roses. The son of one of the friends of Wagner\r\nwould vomit immediately after the ingestion of any substance containing\r\nhoney. Bayle has mentioned a person so susceptible to honey that by a\r\nplaster of this substance placed upon the skin this untoward effect was\r\nproduced. Whytt knew a woman who was made sick by the slightest bit of\r\nnutmeg. Tissot observed vomiting in one of his friends after the\r\ningestion of the slightest amount of sugar. Ritte mentions a similar\r\ninstance.  Roose has seen vomiting produced in a woman by the slightest\r\ndose of distilled water of linden. There is also mentioned a person in\r\nwhom orange-flower water produced the same effect. Dejean cites a case\r\nin which honey taken internally or applied externally acted like\r\npoison. It is said that the celebrated Haen would always have\r\nconvulsions after eating half a dozen strawberries. Earle and Halifax\r\nattended a child for kidney-irritation produced by strawberries, and\r\nthis was the invariable result of the ingestion of this fruit. The\r\nauthors personally know of a family the male members of which for\r\nseveral generations could not eat strawberries without symptoms of\r\npoisoning. The female members were exempt from the idiosyncrasy. A\r\nlittle boy of this family was killed by eating a single berry. Whytt\r\nmentions a woman of delicate constitution and great sensibility of the\r\ndigestive tract in whom foods difficult of digestion provoked spasms,\r\nwhich were often followed by syncopes. Bayle describes a man who\r\nvomited violently after taking coffee. Wagner mentions a person in whom\r\na most insignificant dose of manna had the same effect.  Preslin speaks\r\nof a woman who invariably had a hemorrhage after swallowing a small\r\nquantity of vinegar. According to Zimmerman, some people are unable to\r\nwash their faces on account of untoward symptoms. According to Ganbius,\r\nthe juice of a citron applied to the skin of one of his acquaintances\r\nproduced violent rigors.\r\n\r\nBrasavolus says that Julia, wife of Frederick, King of Naples, had such\r\nan aversion to meat that she could not carry it to her mouth without\r\nfainting. The anatomist Gavard was not able to eat apples without\r\nconvulsions and vomiting. It is said that Erasmus was made ill by the\r\ningestion of fish; but this same philosopher, who was cured of a malady\r\nby laughter, expressed his appreciation by an elegy on the folly. There\r\nis a record of a person who could not eat almonds without a scarlet\r\nrash immediately appearing upon the face. Marcellus Donatus knew a\r\nyoung man who could not eat an egg without his lips swelling and purple\r\nspots appearing on his face. Smetius mentions a person in whom the\r\ningestion of fried eggs was often followed by syncope. Brunton has seen\r\na case of violent vomiting and purging after the slightest bit of egg.\r\nOn one occasion this person was induced to eat a small morsel of cake\r\non the statement that it contained no egg, and, although fully\r\nbelieving the words of his host, he subsequently developed prominent\r\nsymptoms, due to the trace of egg that was really in the cake. A letter\r\nfrom a distinguished litterateur to Sir Morell Mackenzie gives a\r\nstriking example of the idiosyncrasy to eggs transmitted through four\r\ngenerations. Being from such a reliable source, it has been deemed\r\nadvisable to quote the account in full: \"My daughter tells me that you\r\nare interested in the ill-effects which the eating of eggs has upon\r\nher, upon me, and upon my father before us. I believe my grandfather,\r\nas well as my father, could not eat eggs with impunity. As to my father\r\nhimself, he is nearly eighty years old; he has not touched an egg since\r\nhe was a young man; he can, therefore, give no precise or reliable\r\naccount of the symptoms the eating of eggs produce in him. But it was\r\nnot the mere 'stomach-ache' that ensued, but much more immediate and\r\nalarming disturbances. As for me, the peculiarity was discovered when I\r\nwas a spoon-fed child. On several occasions it was noticed (that is my\r\nmother's account) that I felt ill without apparent cause; afterward it\r\nwas recollected that a small part of a yolk of an egg had been given to\r\nme. Eclaircissement came immediately after taking a single spoonful of\r\negg. I fell into such an alarming state that the doctor was sent for.\r\nThe effect seems to have been just the same that it produces upon my\r\ndaughter now,--something that suggested brain-congestion and\r\nconvulsions. From time to time, as a boy and a young man, I have eaten\r\nan egg by way of trying it again, but always with the same result--a\r\nfeeling that I had been poisoned; and yet all the while I liked eggs.\r\nThen I never touched them for years. Later I tried again, and I find\r\nthe ill-effects are gradually wearing off. With my daughter it is\r\ndifferent; she, I think, becomes more susceptible as time goes on, and\r\nthe effect upon her is more violent than in my case at any time.\r\nSometimes an egg has been put with coffee unknown to her, and she has\r\nbeen seen immediately afterward with her face alarmingly changed--eyes\r\nswollen and wild, the face crimson, the look of apoplexy. This is her\r\nown account: 'An egg in any form causes within a few minutes great\r\nuneasiness and restlessness, the throat becomes contracted and painful,\r\nthe face crimson, and the veins swollen. These symptoms have been so\r\nsevere as to suggest that serious consequences might follow.' To this I\r\nmay add that in her experience and my own, the newer the egg, the worse\r\nthe consequences.\"\r\n\r\nHutchinson speaks of a Member of Parliament who had an idiosyncrasy as\r\nregards parsley. After the ingestion of this herb in food he always had\r\nalarming attacks of sickness and pain in the abdomen, attended by\r\nswelling of the tongue and lips and lividity of the face. This same man\r\ncould not take the smallest quantity of honey, and certain kinds of\r\nfruit always poisoned him. There was a collection of instances of\r\nidiosyncrasy in the British Medical Journal, 1859, which will be\r\nbriefly given in the following lines: One patient could not eat rice in\r\nany shape without extreme distress. From the description given of his\r\nsymptoms, spasmodic asthma seemed to be the cause of his discomfort. On\r\none occasion when at a dinner-party he felt the symptoms of\r\nrice-poisoning come on, and, although he had partaken of no dish\r\nostensibly containing rice, was, as usual, obliged to retire from the\r\ntable. Upon investigation it appeared that some white soup with which\r\nhe had commenced his meal had been thickened with ground rice. As in\r\nthe preceding case there was another gentleman who could not eat rice\r\nwithout a sense of suffocation. On one occasion he took lunch with a\r\nfriend in chambers, partaking only of simple bread and cheese and\r\nbottled beer. On being seized with the usual symptoms of rice-poisoning\r\nhe informed his friend of his peculiarity of constitution, and the\r\nsymptoms were explained by the fact that a few grains of rice had been\r\nput into each bottle of beer for the purpose of exciting a secondary\r\nfermentation. The same author speaks of a gentleman under treatment for\r\nstricture who could not eat figs without experiencing the most\r\nunpleasant formication of the palate and fauces. The fine dust from\r\nsplit peas caused the same sensation, accompanied with running at the\r\nnose; it was found that the father of the patient suffered from\r\nhay-fever in certain seasons.  He also says a certain young lady after\r\neating eggs suffered from swelling of the tongue and throat,\r\naccompanied by \"alarming illness,\" and there is recorded in the same\r\nparagraph a history of another young girl in whom the ingestion of\r\nhoney, and especially honey-comb, produced swelling of the tongue,\r\nfrothing of the mouth, and blueness of the fingers. The authors know of\r\na gentleman in whom sneezing is provoked on the ingestion of chocolate\r\nin any form. There was another instance--in a member of the medical\r\nprofession--who suffered from urticaria after eating veal. Veal has the\r\nreputation of being particularly indigestible, and the foregoing\r\ninstance of the production of urticaria from its use is doubtless not\r\nan uncommon one.\r\n\r\nOverton cites a striking case of constitutional peculiarity or\r\nidiosyncrasy in which wheat flour in any form, the staff of life, an\r\narticle hourly prayed for by all Christian nations as the first and\r\nmost indispensable of earthly blessings, proved to one unfortunate\r\nindividual a prompt and dreadful poison. The patient's name was David\r\nWaller, and he was born in Pittsylvania County, Va., about the year\r\n1780. He was the eighth child of his parents, and, together with all\r\nhis brothers and sisters, was stout and healthy. At the time of\r\nobservation Waller was about fifty years of age. He had dark hair, gray\r\neyes, dark complexion, was of bilious and irascible temperament, well\r\nformed, muscular and strong, and in all respects healthy as any man,\r\nwith the single exception of his peculiar idiosyncrasy. He had been the\r\nsubject of but few diseases, although he was attacked by the epidemic\r\nof 1816. From the history of his parents and an inquiry into the health\r\nof his ancestry, nothing could be found which could establish the fact\r\nof heredity in his peculiar disposition.  Despite every advantage of\r\nstature, constitution, and heredity, David Waller was through life,\r\nfrom his cradle to his grave, the victim of what is possibly a unique\r\nidiosyncrasy of constitution.  In his own words he declared: \"Of two\r\nequal quantities of tartar and wheat flour, not more than a dose of the\r\nformer, he would rather swallow the tartar than the wheat flour.\" If he\r\nate flour in any form or however combined, in the smallest quantity, in\r\ntwo minutes or less he would have painful itching over the whole body,\r\naccompanied by severe colic and tormina in the bowels, great sickness\r\nin the stomach, and continued vomiting, which he declared was ten times\r\nas distressing as the symptoms caused by the ingestion of tartar\r\nemetic. In about ten minutes after eating the flour the itching would\r\nbe greatly intensified, especially about the head, face, and eyes, but\r\ntormenting all parts of the body, and not to be appeased. These\r\nsymptoms continued for two days with intolerable violence, and only\r\ndeclined on the third day and ceased on the tenth. In the\r\nconvalescence, the lungs were affected, he coughed, and in\r\nexpectoration raised great quantities of phlegm, and really resembled a\r\nphthisical patient.  At this time he was confined to his room with\r\ngreat weakness, similar to that of a person recovering from an\r\nasthmatic attack.  The mere smell of wheat produced distressing\r\nsymptoms in a minor degree, and for this reason he could not, without\r\nsuffering, go into a mill or house where the smallest quantity of wheat\r\nflour was kept. His condition was the same from the earliest times, and\r\nhe was laid out for dead when an infant at the breast, after being fed\r\nwith \"pap\" thickened with wheat flour. Overton remarks that a case of\r\nconstitutional peculiarity so little in harmony with the condition of\r\nother men could not be received upon vague or feeble evidence, and it\r\nis therefore stated that Waller was known to the society in which he\r\nlived as an honest and truthful man. One of his female neighbors, not\r\nbelieving in his infirmity, but considering it only a whim, put a small\r\nquantity of flour in the soup which she gave him to eat at her table,\r\nstating that it contained no flour, and as a consequence of the\r\ndeception he was bed-ridden for ten days with his usual symptoms. It\r\nwas also stated that Waller was never subjected to militia duty because\r\nit was found on full examination of his infirmity that he could not\r\nlive upon the rations of a soldier, into which wheat flour enters as a\r\nnecessary ingredient. In explanation of this strange departure from the\r\ncondition of other men, Waller himself gave a reason which was deemed\r\nequivalent in value to any of the others offered. It was as follows:\r\nHis father being a man in humble circumstances in life, at the time of\r\nhis birth had no wheat with which to make flour, although his mother\r\nduring gestation \"longed\" for wheat-bread. The father, being a kind\r\nhusband and responsive to the duty imposed by the condition of his\r\nwife, procured from one of his opulent neighbors a bag of wheat and\r\nsent it to the mill to be ground. The mother was given much uneasiness\r\nby an unexpected delay at the mill, and by the time the flour arrived\r\nher strong appetite for wheat-bread had in a great degree subsided.\r\nNotwithstanding this, she caused some flour to be immediately baked\r\ninto bread and ate it, but not so freely as she had expected The bread\r\nthus taken caused intense vomiting and made her violently and painfully\r\nill, after which for a considerable time she loathed bread. These facts\r\nhave been ascribed as the cause of the lamentable infirmity under which\r\nthe man labored, as no other peculiarity or impression in her gestation\r\nwas noticed. In addition it may be stated that for the purpose of\r\navoiding the smell of flour Waller was in the habit of carrying camphor\r\nin his pocket and using snuff, for if he did not smell the flour,\r\nhowever much might be near him, it was as harmless to him as to other\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe authors know of a case in which the eating of any raw fruit would\r\nproduce in a lady symptoms of asthma; cooked fruit had no such effect.\r\n\r\nFood-Superstitions.--The superstitious abhorrence and antipathy to\r\nvarious articles of food that have been prevalent from time to time in\r\nthe history of the human race are of considerable interest and well\r\ndeserve some mention here. A writer in a prominent journal has studied\r\nthis subject with the following result:--\r\n\r\n\"From the days of Adam and Eve to the present time there has been not\r\nonly forbidden fruit, but forbidden meats and vegetables. For one\r\nreason or another people have resolutely refused to eat any and all\r\nkinds of flesh, fish, fowl, fruits, and plants. Thus, the apple, the\r\npear, the strawberry, the quince, the bean, the onion, the leek, the\r\nasparagus, the woodpecker, the pigeon, the goose, the deer, the bear,\r\nthe turtle, and the eel--these, to name only a few eatables, have been\r\navoided as if unwholesome or positively injurious to health and\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\n\"As we all know, the Jews have long had an hereditary antipathy to\r\npork. On the other hand, swine's flesh was highly esteemed by the\r\nancient Greeks and Romans. This fact is revealed by the many references\r\nto pig as a dainty bit of food. At the great festival held annually in\r\nhonor of Demeter, roast pig was the piece de resistance in the bill of\r\nfare, because the pig was the sacred animal of Demeter. Aristophanes in\r\n'The Frogs' makes one of the characters hint that some of the others\r\n'smell of roast pig.' These people undoubtedly had been at the festival\r\n(known as the Thesmophoria) and had eaten freely of roast pig, Those\r\nwho took part in another Greek mystery or festival (known as the\r\nEleusinia) abstained from certain food, and above all from beans.\r\n\r\n\"Again, as we all know, mice are esteemed in China and in some parts of\r\nIndia. But the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Jews abhorred mice and\r\nwould not touch mouse-meat. Rats and field-mice were sacred in Old\r\nEgypt, and were not to be eaten on this account. So, too, in some parts\r\nof Greece, the mouse was the sacred animal of Apollo, and mice were fed\r\nin his temples. The chosen people were forbidden to eat 'the weasel,\r\nand the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind.' These came under the\r\ndesignation of unclean animals, which were to be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"But people have abstained from eating kinds of flesh which could not\r\nbe called unclean. For example, the people of Thebes, as Herodotus\r\ntells us, abstained from sheep. Then, the ancients used to abstain from\r\ncertain vegetables. In his 'Roman Questions' Plutarch asks: 'Why do the\r\nLatins abstain strictly from the flesh of the woodpecker?' In order to\r\nanswer Plutarch's question correctly it is necessary to have some idea\r\nof the peculiar custom and belief called 'totemism.' There is a stage\r\nof society in which people claim descent from and kinship with beasts,\r\nbirds, vegetables, and other objects. This object, which is a 'totem,'\r\nor family mark, they religiously abstain from eating.  The members of\r\nthe tribe are divided into clans or stocks, each of which takes the\r\nname of some animal, plant, or object, as the bear, the buffalo, the\r\nwoodpecker, the asparagus, and so forth.  No member of the bear family\r\nwould dare to eat bear-meat, but he has no objection to eating buffalo\r\nsteak. Even the marriage law is based on this belief, and no man whose\r\nfamily name is Wolf may marry a woman whose family name is also Wolf.\r\n\r\n\"In a general way it may be said that almost all our food prohibitions\r\nspring from the extraordinary custom generally called totemism. Mr.\r\nSwan, who was missionary for many years in the Congo Free State, thus\r\ndescribes the custom: 'If I were to ask the Yeke people why they do not\r\neat zebra flesh, they would reply, 'Chijila,' i.e., 'It is a thing to\r\nwhich we have an antipathy;' or better, 'It is one of the things which\r\nour fathers taught us not to eat.' So it seems the word 'Bashilang'\r\nmeans 'the people who have an antipathy to the leopard;' the\r\n'Bashilamba,' 'those who have an antipathy to the dog,' and the\r\n'Bashilanzefu,' 'those who have an antipathy to the elephant.' In other\r\nwords, the members of these stocks refuse to eat their totems, the\r\nzebra, the leopard, or the elephant, from which they take their names.\r\n\r\n\"The survival of antipathy to certain foods was found among people as\r\nhighly civilized as the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans. Quite a\r\nlist of animals whose flesh was forbidden might be drawn up. For\r\nexample, in Old Egypt the sheep could not be eaten in Thebes, nor the\r\ngoat in Mendes, nor the cat in Bubastis, nor the crocodile at Ombos,\r\nnor the rat, which was sacred to Ra, the sun-god. However, the people\r\nof one place had no scruples about eating the forbidden food of another\r\nplace. And this often led to religious disputes.\r\n\r\n\"Among the vegetables avoided as food by the Egyptians may be mentioned\r\nthe onion, the garlic, and the leek. Lucian says that the inhabitants\r\nof Pelusium adored the onion. According to Pliny the Egyptians relished\r\nthe leek and the onion. Juvenal exclaims: 'Surely a very religious\r\nnation, and a blessed place, where every garden is overrun with gods!'\r\nThe survivals of totemism among the ancient Greeks are very\r\ninteresting. Families named after animals and plants were not uncommon.\r\nOne Athenian gens, the Ioxidae, had for its ancestral plant the\r\nasparagus. One Roman gens, the Piceni, took a woodpecker for its totem,\r\nand every member of this family refused, of course, to eat the flesh of\r\nthe woodpecker. In the same way as the nations of the Congo Free State,\r\nthe Latins had an antipathy to certain kinds of food. However, an\r\nanimal or plant forbidden in one place was eaten without any\r\ncompunction in another place. 'These local rites in Roman times,' says\r\nMr. Lang, 'caused civil brawls, for the customs of one town naturally\r\nseemed blasphemous to neighbors with a different sacred animal.  Thus\r\nwhen the people of dog-town were feeding on the fish called\r\noxyrrhyncus, the citizens of the town which revered the oxyrrhyncus\r\nbegan to eat dogs. Hence arose a riot.' The antipathy of the Jews to\r\npork has given rise to quite different explanations. The custom is\r\nprobably a relic of totemistic belief. That the unclean\r\nanimals--animals not to be eaten--such as the pig, the mouse, and the\r\nweasel, were originally totems of the children of Israel, Professor\r\nRobertson Smith believes is shown by various passages in the Old\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\n\"When animals and plants ceased to be held sacred they were endowed\r\nwith sundry magical or mystic properties. The apple has been supposed\r\nto possess peculiar virtues, especially in the way of health. 'The\r\nrelation of the apple to health,' says Mr. Conway, 'is traceable to\r\nArabia. Sometimes it is regarded as a bane. In Hessia it is said an\r\napple must not be eaten on New Year's Day, as it will produce an\r\nabscess. But generally it is curative. In Pomerania it is eaten on\r\nEaster morning against fevers; in Westphalia (mixed with saffron)\r\nagainst jaundice; while in Silesia an apple is scraped from top to\r\nstalk to cure diarrhea, and upward to cure costiveness.' According to\r\nan old English fancy, if any one who is suffering from a wound in the\r\nhead should eat strawberries it will lead to fatal results. In the\r\nSouth of England the folk say that the devil puts his cloven foot upon\r\nthe blackberries on Michaelmas Day, and hence none should be gathered\r\nor eaten after that day. On the other hand, in Scotland the peasants\r\nsay that the devil throws his cloak over the blackberries and makes\r\nthem unwholesome after that day, while in Ireland he is said to stamp\r\non the berries. Even that humble plant, the cabbage, has been invested\r\nwith some mystery. It was said that the fairies were fond of its\r\nleaves, and rode to their midnight dances on cabbage-stalks. The German\r\nwomen used to say that 'Babies come out of the cabbage-heads.' The\r\nIrish peasant ties a cabbage-leaf around the neck for sore throat.\r\nAccording to Gerarde, the Spartans ate watercress with their bread,\r\nfirmly believing that it increased their wit and wisdom. The old\r\nproverb is, 'Eat cress to learn more wit.'\r\n\r\n\"There is another phase to food-superstitions, and that is the theory\r\nthat the qualities of the eaten pass into the eater. Mr. Tylor refers\r\nto the habit of the Dyak young men in abstaining from deer-meat lest it\r\nshould make them timid, while the warriors of some South American\r\ntribes eat the meat of tigers, stags, and boars for courage and speed.\r\nHe mentions the story of an English gentleman at Shanghai who at the\r\ntime of the Taeping attack met his Chinese servant carrying home the\r\nheart of a rebel, which he intended to eat to make him brave. There is\r\na certain amount of truth in the theory that the quality of food does\r\naffect the mind and body. Buckle in his 'History of Civilization' took\r\nthis view, and tried to prove that the character of a people depends on\r\ntheir diet.\"\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasies to Drugs.--In the absorption and the assimilation of\r\ndrugs idiosyncrasies are often noted; in fact, they are so common that\r\nwe can almost say that no one drug acts in the same degree or manner on\r\ndifferent individuals. In some instances the untoward action assumes\r\nsuch a serious aspect as to render extreme caution necessary in the\r\nadministration of the most inert substances. A medicine ordinarily so\r\nbland as cod-liver oil may give rise to disagreeable eruptions.\r\nChristison speaks of a boy ten years old who was said to have been\r\nkilled by the ingestion of two ounces of Epsom salts without inducing\r\npurgation; yet this common purge is universally used without the\r\nslightest fear or caution. On the other hand, the extreme tolerance\r\nexhibited by certain individuals to certain drugs offers a new phase of\r\nthis subject. There are well-authenticated cases on record in which\r\ndeath has been caused in children by the ingestion of a small fraction\r\nof a grain of opium. While exhibiting especial tolerance from peculiar\r\ndisposition and long habit, Thomas De Quincey, the celebrated English\r\nlitterateur, makes a statement in his \"Confessions\" that with impunity\r\nhe took as much as 320 grains of opium a day, and was accustomed at one\r\nperiod of his life to call every day for \"a glass of laudanum negus,\r\nwarm, and without sugar,\" to use his own expression, after the manner a\r\ntoper would call for a \"hot-Scotch.\"\r\n\r\nThe individuality noted in the assimilation and the ingestion of drugs\r\nis functional as well as anatomic. Numerous cases have been seen by all\r\nphysicians. The severe toxic symptoms from a whiff of cocain-spray, the\r\nacute distress from the tenth of a grain of morphin, the gastric crises\r\nand profuse urticarial eruptions following a single dose of\r\nquinin,--all are proofs of it. The \"personal equation\" is one of the\r\nmost important factors in therapeutics, reminding us of the old rule,\r\n\"Treat the patient, not the disease.\"\r\n\r\nThe idiosyncrasy may be either temporary or permanent, and there are\r\nmany conditions that influence it. The time and place of\r\nadministration; the degree of pathologic lesion in the subject; the\r\ndifference in the physiologic capability of individual organs of\r\nsimilar nature in the same body; the degree of human vitality\r\ninfluencing absorption and resistance; the peculiar epochs of life; the\r\nelement of habituation, and the grade and strength of the drug,\r\ninfluencing its virtue,--all have an important bearing on untoward\r\naction and tolerance of poisons.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the province of this work to discuss at length the\r\nexplanations offered for these individual idiosyncrasies. Many authors\r\nhave done so, and Lewin has devoted a whole volume to this subject, of\r\nwhich, fortunately, an English translation has been made by Mulheron,\r\nand to these the interested reader is referred for further information.\r\nIn the following lines examples of idiosyncrasy to the most common\r\nremedial substances will be cited, taking the drugs up alphabetically.\r\n\r\nAcids.--Ordinarily speaking, the effect of boric acid in medicinal\r\ndoses on the human system is nil, an exceptionally large quantity\r\ncausing diuresis. Binswanger, according to Lewin, took eight gm. in two\r\ndoses within an hour, which was followed by nausea, vomiting, and a\r\nfeeling of pressure and fulness of the stomach which continued several\r\nhours. Molodenkow mentions two fatal cases from the external employment\r\nof boric acid as an antiseptic. In one case the pleural cavity was\r\nwashed out with a five per cent solution of boric acid and was followed\r\nby distressing symptoms, vomiting, weak pulse, erythema, and death on\r\nthe third day. In the second case, in a youth of sixteen, death\r\noccurred after washing out a deep abscess of the nates with the same\r\nsolution. The autopsy revealed no change or signs indicative of the\r\ncause of death. Hogner mentions two instances of death from the\r\nemployment of 2 1/2 per cent solution of boric acid in washing out a\r\ndilated stomach The symptoms were quite similar to those mentioned by\r\nMolodenkow.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the medical profession has become well aware that in\r\nits application to wounds it is possible for carbolic acid or phenol to\r\nexercise exceedingly deleterious and even fatal consequences. In the\r\nearlier days of antisepsis, when operators and patients were exposed\r\nfor some time to an atmosphere saturated with carbolic spray, toxic\r\nsymptoms were occasionally noticed. Von Langenbeck spoke of severe\r\ncarbolic-acid intoxication in a boy in whom carbolic paste had been\r\nused in the treatment of abscesses. The same author reports two\r\ninstances of death following the employment of dry carbolized dressings\r\nafter slight operations. Kohler mentions the death of a man suffering\r\nfrom scabies who had applied externally a solution containing about a\r\nhalf ounce of phenol. Rose spoke of gangrene of the finger after the\r\napplication of carbolized cotton to a wound thereon. In some cases\r\nphenol acts with a rapidity equal to any poison. Taylor speaks of a man\r\nwho fell unconscious ten seconds after an ounce of phenol had been\r\ningested, and in three minutes was dead. There is recorded an account\r\nof a man of sixty-four who was killed by a solution containing slightly\r\nover a dram of phenol. A half ounce has frequently caused death;\r\nsmaller quantities have been followed by distressing symptoms, such as\r\nintoxication (which Olshausen has noticed to follow irrigation of the\r\nuterus), delirium, singultus, nausea, rigors, cephalalgia, tinnitus\r\naurium, and anasarca. Hind mentions recovery after the ingestion of\r\nnearly six ounces of crude phenol of 14 per cent strength. There was a\r\ncase at the Liverpool Northern Hospital in which recovery took place\r\nafter the ingestion with suicidal intent of four ounces of crude\r\ncarbolic acid. Quoted by Lewin, Busch accurately describes a case which\r\nmay be mentioned as characteristic of the symptoms of carbolism. A boy,\r\nsuffering from abscess under the trochanter, was operated on for its\r\nrelief. During the few minutes occupied by the operation he was kept\r\nunder a two per cent carbolic spray, and the wound was afterward\r\ndressed with carbolic gauze. The day following the operation he was\r\nseized with vomiting, which was attributed to the chloroform used as an\r\nanesthetic. On the following morning the bandages were removed under\r\nthe carbolic spray; during the day there was nausea, in the evening\r\nthere was collapse, and carbolic acid was detected in the urine. The\r\npulse became small and frequent and the temperature sank to 35.5\r\ndegrees C. The frequent vomiting made it impossible to administer\r\nremedies by the stomach, and, in spite of hypodermic injections and\r\nexternal application of analeptics, the boy died fifty hours after\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nRecovery has followed the ingestion of an ounce of officinal\r\nhydrochloric acid. Black mentions a man of thirty-nine who recovered\r\nafter swallowing 1 1/2 ounces of commercial hydrochloric acid. Johnson\r\nreports a case of poisoning from a dram of hydrochloric acid.\r\nTracheotomy was performed, but death resulted.\r\n\r\nBurman mentions recovery after the ingestion of a dram of dilute\r\nhydrocyanic acid of Scheele's strength (2.4 am. of the acid). In this\r\ninstance insensibility did not ensue until two minutes after taking the\r\npoison, the retarded digestion being the means of saving life.\r\n\r\nQuoting Taafe, in 1862 Taylor speaks of the case of a man who swallowed\r\nthe greater part of a solution containing an ounce of potassium cyanid.\r\nIn a few minutes the man was found insensible in the street, breathing\r\nstertorously, and in ten minutes after the ingestion of the drug the\r\nstomach-pump was applied. In two hours vomiting began, and thereafter\r\nrecovery was rapid.\r\n\r\nMitscherlich speaks of erosion of the gums and tongue with hemorrhage\r\nat the slightest provocation, following the long administration of\r\ndilute nitric acid. This was possibly due to the local action.\r\n\r\nAccording to Taylor, the smallest quantity of oxalic acid causing death\r\nis one dram. Ellis describes a woman of fifty who swallowed an ounce of\r\noxalic acid in beer. In thirty minutes she complained of a burning pain\r\nin the stomach and was rolling about in agony.  Chalk and water was\r\nimmediately given to her and she recovered.  Woodman reports recovery\r\nafter taking 1/2 ounce of oxalic acid.\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid in medicinal doses frequently causes untoward symptoms,\r\nsuch as dizziness, transient delirium, diminution of vision, headache,\r\nand profuse perspiration; petechial eruptions and intense gastric\r\nsymptoms have also been noticed.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid causes death from its corrosive action, and when taken\r\nin excessive quantities it produces great gastric disturbance; however,\r\nthere are persons addicted to taking oil of vitriol without any\r\napparent untoward effect. There is mentioned a boot-maker who\r\nconstantly took 1/2 ounce of the strong acid in a tumbler of water,\r\nsaying that it relieved his dyspepsia and kept his bowels open.\r\n\r\nAntimony.--It is recorded that 3/4 grain of tartar emetic has caused\r\ndeath in a child and two grains in an adult. Falot reports three cases\r\nin which after small doses of tartar emetic there occurred vomiting,\r\ndelirium, spasms, and such depression of vitality that only the\r\nenergetic use of stimulants saved life.  Beau mentions death following\r\nthe administration of two doses of 1 1/2 gr. of tartar emetic.\r\nPreparations of antimony in an ointment applied locally have caused\r\nnecrosis, particularly of the cranium, and Hebra has long since\r\ndenounced the use of tartar emetic ointment in affections of the scalp.\r\nCarpenter mentions recovery after ingestion of two drams of tartar\r\nemetic. Behrends describes a case of catalepsy with mania, in which a\r\ndose of 40 gr. of tartar emetic was tolerated, and Morgagni speaks of a\r\nman who swallowed two drams, immediately vomited, and recovered.\r\nInstances like the last, in which an excessive amount of a poison by\r\nits sudden emetic action induces vomiting before there is absorption of\r\na sufficient quantity to cause death, are sometimes noticed. McCreery\r\nmentions a case of accidental poisoning with half an ounce of tartar\r\nemetic successfully treated with green tea and tannin. Mason reports\r\nrecovery after taking 80 gr. of tartar emetic.\r\n\r\nArsenic.--The sources of arsenical poisoning are so curious as to\r\ndeserve mention. Confectionery, wall-paper, dyes, and the like are\r\nexamples. In other cases we note money-counting, the colored candles of\r\na Christmas tree, paper collars, ball-wreaths of artificial flowers,\r\nball-dresses made of green tarlatan, playing cards, hat-lining, and\r\nfly-papers.\r\n\r\nBazin has reported a case in which erythematous pustules appeared after\r\nthe exhibition during fifteen days of the 5/6 gr. of arsenic. Macnal\r\nspeaks of an eruption similar to that of measles in a patient to whom\r\nhe had given but three drops of Fowler's solution for the short period\r\nof three days. Pareira says that in a gouty patient for whom he\r\nprescribed 1/6 gr. of potassium arseniate daily, on the third day there\r\nappeared a bright red eruption of the face, neck, upper part of the\r\ntrunk and flexor surfaces of the joints, and an edematous condition of\r\nthe eyelids. The symptoms were preceded by restlessness, headache, and\r\nheat of the skin, and subsided gradually after the second or third day,\r\ndesquamation continuing for nearly two months. After they had subsided\r\nentirely, the exhibition of arsenic again aroused them, and this time\r\nthey were accompanied by salivation.  Charcot and other French authors\r\nhave noticed the frequent occurrence of suspension of the sexual\r\ninstinct during the administration of Fowler's solution. Jackson speaks\r\nof recovery after the ingestion of two ounces of arsenic by the early\r\nemployment of an emetic. Walsh reports a case in which 600 gr. of\r\narsenic were taken without injury. The remarkable tolerance of arsenic\r\neaters is well known. Taylor asserts that the smallest lethal dose of\r\narsenic has been two gr., but Tardieu mentions an instance in which ten\r\ncgm. (1 1/2 gr.) has caused death.  Mackenzie speaks of a man who\r\nswallowed a large quantity of arsenic in lumps, and received no\r\ntreatment for sixteen hours, but recovered. It is added that from two\r\nmasses passed by the anus 105 gr. of arsenic were obtained.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the tolerance of belladonna, in 1859 Fuller mentioned a\r\nchild of fourteen who in eighteen days took 37 grains of atropin; a\r\nchild of ten who took seven grains of extract of belladonna daily, or\r\nmore than two ounces in twenty-six days; and a man who took 64 grains\r\nof the extract of belladonna daily, and from whose urine enough atropin\r\nwas extracted to kill two white mice and to narcotize two others. Bader\r\nhas observed grave symptoms following the employment of a vaginal\r\nsuppository containing three grains of the extract of belladonna. The\r\ndermal manifestations, such as urticaria and eruptions resembling the\r\nexanthem of scarlatina, are too well known to need mention here.  An\r\nenema containing 80 grains of belladonna root has been followed in five\r\nhours by death, and Taylor has mentioned recovery after the ingestion\r\nof three drams of belladonna. In 1864 Chambers reported to the Lancet\r\nthe recovery of a child of four years who took a solution containing\r\n1/2 grain of the alkaloid. In some cases the idiosyncrasy to belladonna\r\nis so marked that violent symptoms follow the application of the\r\nordinary belladonna plaster. Maddox describes a ease of poisoning in a\r\nmusic teacher by the belladonna plaster of a reputable maker. She had\r\nobscure eye-symptoms, and her color-sensations were abnormal. Locomotor\r\nequilibration was also affected. Golden mentions two cases in which the\r\napplication of belladonna ointment to the breasts caused suppression of\r\nthe secretion of milk. Goodwin relates the history of a case in which\r\nan infant was poisoned by a belladonna plaster applied to its mother's\r\nbreast and died within twenty-four hours after the first application of\r\nthe plaster. In 1881 Betancourt spoke of an instance of inherited\r\nsusceptibility to belladonna, in which the external application of the\r\nointment produced all the symptoms of belladonna poisoning. Cooper\r\nmentions the symptoms of poisoning following the application of extract\r\nof belladonna to the scrotum. Davison reports poisoning by the\r\napplication of belladonna liniment. Jenner and Lyman also record\r\nbelladonna poisoning from external applications.\r\n\r\nRosenthal reports a rare case of poisoning in a child eighteen months\r\nold who had swallowed about a teaspoonful of benzin.  Fifteen minutes\r\nlater the child became unconscious. The stomach-contents, which were\r\npromptly removed, contained flakes of bloody mucus. At the end of an\r\nhour the radial pulse was scarcely perceptible, respiration was\r\nsomewhat increased in frequency and accompanied with a rasping sound.\r\nThe breath smelt of benzin. The child lay in quiet narcosis,\r\noccasionally throwing itself about as if in pain. The pulse gradually\r\nimproved, profuse perspiration occurred, and normal sleep intervened.\r\nSix hours after the poisoning the child was still stupefied. The urine\r\nwas free from albumin and sugar, and the next morning the little one\r\nhad perfectly recovered.\r\n\r\nThere is an instance mentioned of a robust youth of twenty who by a\r\nmistake took a half ounce of cantharides. He was almost immediately\r\nseized with violent heat in the throat and stomach, pain in the head,\r\nand intense burning on urination. These symptoms progressively\r\nincreased, were followed by intense sickness and almost continual\r\nvomiting. In the evening he passed great quantities of blood from the\r\nurethra with excessive pain in the urinary tract. On the third day all\r\nthe symptoms were less violent and the vomiting had ceased. Recovery\r\nwas complete on the fifteenth day.\r\n\r\nDigitalis has been frequently observed to produce dizziness, fainting,\r\ndisturbances of vision, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness of the pulse, and\r\ndepression of temperature. These phenomena, however, are generally\r\nnoticed after continued administration in repeated doses, the result\r\nbeing doubtless due to cumulative action caused by abnormally slow\r\nelimination by the kidneys.  Traube observed the presence of\r\nskin-affection after the use of digitalis in a case of pericarditis.\r\nTardieu has seen a fluid-dram of the tincture of digitalis cause\r\nalarming symptoms in a young woman who was pregnant. He also quotes\r\ncases of death on the tenth day from ingestion of 20 grains of the\r\nextract, and on the fifth day from 21 grams of the infusion. Kohuhorn\r\nmentions a death from what might be called chronic digitalis poisoning.\r\n\r\nThere is a deleterious practice of some of the Irish peasantry\r\nconnected with their belief in fairies, which consists of giving a\r\ncachetic or rachitic child large doses of a preparation of fox-glove\r\n(Irish--luss-more, or great herb), to drive out or kill the fairy in\r\nthe child. It was supposed to kill an unhallowed child and cure a\r\nhallowed one. In the Hebrides, likewise, there were many cases of\r\nsimilar poisoning.\r\n\r\nEpidemics of ergotism have been recorded from time to time since the\r\ndays of Galen, and were due to poverty, wretchedness, and famine,\r\nresulting in the feeding upon ergotized bread. According to Wood,\r\ngangrenous ergotism, or \"Ignis Sacer\" of the Middle Ages, killed 40,000\r\npersons in Southwestern France in 922 A. D., and in 1128-29, in Paris\r\nalone, 14,000 persons perished from this malady. It is described as\r\ncommencing with itchings and formications in the feet, severe pain in\r\nthe back, contractions in the muscles, nausea, giddiness, apathy, with\r\nabortion in pregnant women, in suckling women drying of milk, and in\r\nmaidens with amenorrhea. After some time, deep, heavy aching in the\r\nlimbs, intense feeling of coldness, with real coldness of the surfaces,\r\nprofound apathy, and a sense of utter weariness develop; then a dark\r\nspot appears on the nose or one of the extremities, all sensibility is\r\nlost in the affected part, the skin assumes a livid red hue, and\r\nadynamic symptoms in severe cases deepen as the gangrene spreads, until\r\nfinally death ensues.  Very generally the appetite and digestion are\r\npreserved to the last, and not rarely there is a most ferocious hunger.\r\nWood also mentions a species of ergotism characterized by epileptic\r\nparoxysms, which he calls \"spasmodic ergotism.\" Prentiss mentions a\r\nbrunette of forty-two, under the influence of ergot, who exhibited a\r\npeculiar depression of spirits with hysteric phenomena, although\r\nderiving much benefit from the administration of the drug from the\r\nhemorrhage caused by uterine fibroids. After taking ergot for three\r\ndays she felt like crying all the time, became irritable, and stayed in\r\nbed, being all day in tears. The natural disposition of the patient was\r\nentirely opposed to these manifestations, as she was even-tempered and\r\nexceptionally pleasant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the instance of the fatal ingestion of a dose of Epsom\r\nsalts already quoted, Lang mentions a woman of thirty-five who took\r\nfour ounces of this purge. She experienced burning pain in the stomach\r\nand bowels, together with a sense of asphyxiation.  There was no\r\npurging or vomiting, but she became paralyzed and entered a state of\r\ncoma, dying fifteen minutes after ingestion.\r\n\r\nIodin Preparations.--The eruptions following the administration of\r\nsmall doses of potassium iodid are frequently noticed, and at the same\r\ntime large quantities of albumin have been seen in the urine. Potassium\r\niodid, although generally spoken of as a poisonous drug, by gradually\r\nincreasing the dose can be given in such enormous quantities as to be\r\nalmost beyond the bounds of credence, several drams being given at a\r\ndose. On the other hand, eight grains have produced alarming symptoms.\r\nIn the extensive use of iodoform as a dressing instances of untoward\r\neffects, and even fatal ones, have been noticed, the majority of them\r\nbeing due to careless and injudicious application. In a French journal\r\nthere is mentioned the history of a man of twenty-five, suspected of\r\nurethral ulceration, who submitted to the local application of one gram\r\nof iodoform. Deep narcosis and anesthesia were induced, and two hours\r\nafter awakening his breath smelled strongly of iodoform. There are two\r\nsimilar instances recorded in England.\r\n\r\nPope mentions two fatal cases of lead-poisoning from diachylon plaster,\r\nself-administered for the purpose of producing abortion.  Lead\r\nwater-pipes, the use of cosmetics and hair-dyes, coloring matter in\r\nconfectionery and in pastry, habitual biting of silk threads,\r\nimperfectly burnt pottery, and cooking bread with painted wood have\r\nbeen mentioned as causes of chronic lead-poisoning.\r\n\r\nMercury.--Armstrong mentions recovery after ingestion of 1 1/2 drams of\r\ncorrosive sublimate, and Lodge speaks of recovery after a dose\r\ncontaining 100 grains of the salt. It is said that a man swallowed 80\r\ngrains of mercuric chlorid in whiskey and water, and vomited violently\r\nabout ten minutes afterward. A mixture of albumin and milk was given to\r\nhim, and in about twenty-five minutes a bolus of gold-leaf and reduced\r\niron; in eight days he perfectly recovered. Severe and even fatal\r\npoisoning may result from the external application of mercury. Meeres\r\nmentions a case in which a solution (two grains to the fluid-ounce)\r\napplied to the head of a child of nine for the relief of tinea\r\ntonsurans caused diarrhea, profuse salivation, marked prostration, and\r\nfinally death. Washing out the vagina with a solution of corrosive\r\nsublimate, 1:2000, has caused severe and even fatal poisoning. Bonet\r\nmentions death after the inunction of a mercurial ointment, and\r\ninstances of distressing salivation from such medication are quite\r\ncommon. There are various dermal affections which sometimes follow the\r\nexhibition of mercury and assume an erythematous type. The\r\nsusceptibility of some persons to calomel, the slightest dose causing\r\nprofuse salivation and painful oral symptoms, is so common that few\r\nphysicians administer mercury to their patients without some knowledge\r\nof their susceptibility to this drug. Blundel relates a curious case\r\noccurring in the times when mercury was given in great quantities, in\r\nwhich to relieve obstinate constipation a half ounce of crude mercury\r\nwas administered and repeated in twelve hours. Scores of globules of\r\nmercury soon appeared over a vesicated surface, the result of a\r\nprevious blister applied to the epigastric region. Blundel, not\r\nsatisfied with the actuality of the phenomena, submitted his case to\r\nDr. Lister, who, after careful examination, pronounced the globules\r\nmetallic.\r\n\r\nOils.--Mauvezin tells of the ingestion of three drams of croton oil by\r\na child of six, followed by vomiting and rapid recovery.  There was no\r\ndiarrhea in this case. Wood quotes Cowan in mentioning the case of a\r\nchild of four, who in two days recovered from a teaspoonful of croton\r\noil taken on a full stomach. Adams saw recovery in an adult after\r\ningestion of the same amount.  There is recorded an instance of a woman\r\nwho took about an ounce, and, emesis being produced three-quarters of\r\nan hour afterward by mustard, she finally recovered. There is a record\r\nin which so small a dose as three minims is supposed to have killed a\r\nchild of thirteen months. According to Wood, Giacomini mentions a case\r\nin which 24 grains of the drug proved fatal in as many hours.\r\n\r\nCastor oil is usually considered a harmless drug, but the castor bean,\r\nfrom which it is derived, contains a poisonous acrid principle, three\r\nsuch beans having sufficed to produce death in a man. Doubtless some of\r\nthe instances in which castor oil has produced symptoms similar to\r\ncholera are the results of the administration of contaminated oil.\r\n\r\nThe untoward effects of opium and its derivatives are quite numerous\r\nGaubius treated an old woman in whom, after three days, a single grain\r\nof opium produced a general desquamation of the epidermis; this\r\npeculiarity was not accidental, as it was verified on several other\r\noccasions. Hargens speaks of a woman in whom the slightest bit of opium\r\nin any form produced considerable salivation. Gastric disturbances are\r\nquite common, severe vomiting being produced by minimum doses; not\r\ninfrequently, intense mental confusion, vertigo, and headache, lasting\r\nhours and even days, sometimes referable to the frontal region and\r\nsometimes to the occipital, are seen in certain nervous individuals\r\nafter a dose of from 1/4 to 5/6 gr. of opium. These symptoms were\r\nfamiliar to the ancient physicians, and, according to Lewin, Tralles\r\nreports an observation with reference to this in a man, and says\r\nregarding it in rather unclassical Latin: \"... per multos dies\r\nponderosissimum caput circumgestasse.\" Convulsions are said to be\r\nobserved after medicinal doses of opium. Albers states that twitching\r\nin the tendons tremors of the hands, and even paralysis, have been\r\nnoticed after the ingestion of opium in even ordinary doses. The\r\n\"pruritus opii,\" so familiar to physicians, is spoken of in the older\r\nwritings. Dioscorides, Paulus Aegineta, and nearly all the writers of\r\nthe last century describe this symptom as an annoying and unbearable\r\naffection. In some instances the ingestion of opium provokes an\r\neruption in the form of small, isolated red spots, which, in their\r\ngeneral character, resemble roseola. Rieken remarks that when these\r\nspots spread over all the body they present a scarlatiniform\r\nappearance, and he adds that even the mucous membranes of the mouth and\r\nthroat may be attacked with erethematous inflammation.  Behrend\r\nobserved an opium exanthem, which was attended by intolerable itching,\r\nafter the exhibition of a quarter of a grain. It was seen on the chest,\r\non the inner surfaces of the arms, on the flexor surfaces of the\r\nforearms and wrists, on the thighs, and posterior and inner surfaces of\r\nthe legs, terminating at the ankles in a stripe-like discoloration\r\nabout the breadth of three fingers. It consisted of closely disposed\r\npapules of the size of a pin-head, and several days after the\r\ndisappearance of the eruption a fine, bran-like desquamation of the\r\nepidermis ensued. Brand has also seen an eruption on the trunk and\r\nflexor surfaces, accompanied with fever, from the ingestion of opium.\r\nBillroth mentions the case of a lady in whom appeared a feeling of\r\nanxiety, nausea, and vomiting after ingestion of a small fraction of a\r\ngrain of opium; she would rather endure her intense pain than suffer\r\nthe untoward action of the drug. According to Lewin, Brochin reported a\r\ncase in which the idiosyncrasy to morphin was so great that 1/25 of a\r\ngrain of the drug administered hypodermically caused irregularity of\r\nthe respiration, suspension of the heart-beat, and profound narcosis.\r\nAccording to the same authority, Wernich has called attention to\r\nparesthesia of the sense of taste after the employment of morphin,\r\nwhich, according to his observation, is particularly prone to supervene\r\nin patients who are much reduced and in persons otherwise healthy who\r\nhave suffered from prolonged inanition. These effects are probably due\r\nto a central excitation of a similar nature to that produced by\r\nsantonin. Persons thus attacked complain, shortly after the injection,\r\nof an intensely sour or bitter taste, which for the most part ceases\r\nafter elimination of the morphin. Von Graefe and Sommerfrodt speak of a\r\nspasm of accommodation occurring after ingestion of medicinal doses of\r\nmorphin. There are several cases on record in which death has been\r\nproduced in an adult by the use of 1/2 to 1/6 grain of morphin.\r\nAccording to Wood, the maximum doses from which recovery has occurred\r\nwithout emesis are 55 grains of solid opium, and six ounces of\r\nlaudanum. According to the same authority, in 1854 there was a case in\r\nwhich a babe one day old was killed by one minim of laudanum, and in\r\nanother case a few drops of paregoric proved fatal to a child of nine\r\nmonths.  Doubtful instances of death from opium are given, one in an\r\nadult female after 30 grains of Dover's powder given in divided doses,\r\nand another after a dose of 1/4 grain of morphin. Yavorski cites a\r\nrather remarkable instance of morphin-poisoning with recovery: a female\r\ntook 30 grains of acetate of morphin, and as it did not act quickly\r\nenough she took an additional dose of 1/2 ounce of laudanum. After this\r\nshe slept a few hours, and awoke complaining of being ill. Yavorski saw\r\nher about an hour later, and by producing emesis, and giving coffee,\r\natropin, and tincture of musk, he saved her life. Pyle describes a\r\npugilist of twenty-two who, in a fit of despondency after a debauch (in\r\nwhich he had taken repeated doses of morphin sulphate), took with\r\nsuicidal intent three teaspoonfuls of morphin; after rigorous treatment\r\nhe revived and was discharged on the next day perfectly well.\r\nPotassium permanganate was used in this case. Chaffee speaks of\r\nrecovery after the ingestion of 18 grains of morphin without vomiting.\r\n\r\nIn chronic opium eating the amount of this drug which can be ingested\r\nwith safety assumes astounding proportions. In his \"Confessions\" De\r\nQuincey remarks: \"Strange as it may sound, I had a little before this\r\ntime descended suddenly and without considerable effort from 320 grains\r\nof opium (8000 drops of laudanum) per day to 40 grains, or 1/8 part.\r\nInstantaneously, and as if by magic, the cloud of profoundest\r\nmelancholy which rested on my brain, like some black vapors that I have\r\nseen roll away from the summits of the mountains, drew off in one\r\nday,--passed off with its murky banners as simultaneously as a ship\r\nthat has been stranded and is floated off by a spring-tide--\r\n\r\n     'That moveth altogether if it move at all.'\r\n\r\nNow, then, I was again happy; I took only a thousand drops of Laudanum\r\nper day, and what was that? A latter spring had come to close up the\r\nseason of youth; my brain performed its functions as healthily as ever\r\nbefore; I read Kant again, and again I understood him, or fancied that\r\nI did.\" There have been many authors who, in condemning De Quincey for\r\nunjustly throwing about the opium habit a halo of literary beauty which\r\nhas tempted many to destruction, absolutely deny the truth of his\r\nstatements. No one has any stable reason on which to found denial of De\r\nQuincey's statements as to the magnitude of the doses he was able to\r\ntake; and his frankness and truthfulness is equal to that of any of his\r\ndetractors. William Rosse Cobbe, in a volume entitled \"Dr. Judas, or\r\nPortrayal of the Opium Habit,\" gives with great frankness of confession\r\nand considerable purity of diction a record of his own experiences with\r\nthe drug. One entire chapter of Mr. Cobb's book and several portions of\r\nother chapters are devoted to showing that De Quincey was wrong in some\r\nof his statements, but notwithstanding his criticism of De Quincey, Mr.\r\nCobbe seems to have experienced the same adventures in his dreams,\r\nshowing, after all, that De Quincey knew the effects of opium even if\r\nhe seemed to idealize it. According to Mr. Cobbe, there are in the\r\nUnited States upward of two millions of victims of enslaving drugs\r\nentirely exclusive of alcohol. Cobbe mentions several instances in\r\nwhich De Quincey's dose of 320 grains of opium daily has been\r\nsurpassed. One man, a resident of Southern Illinois, consumed 1072\r\ngrains a day; another in the same State contented himself with 1685\r\ngrains daily; and still another is given whose daily consumption\r\namounted to 2345 grains per day. In all cases of laudanum-takers it is\r\nprobable that analysis of the commercial laudanum taken would show the\r\namount of opium to be greatly below that of the official proportion,\r\nand little faith can be put in the records of large amounts of opium\r\ntaken when the deduction has been made from the laudanum used. Dealers\r\nsoon begin to know opium victims, and find them ready dupes for\r\nadulteration. According to Lewin, Samter mentions a case of\r\nmorphin-habit which was continued for three years, during which, in a\r\nperiod of about three, hundred and twenty-three days, upward of 2 1/2\r\nounces of morphin was taken daily. According to the same authority,\r\nEder reports still larger doses. In the case observed by him the\r\npatient took laudanum for six years in increasing doses up to one ounce\r\nper day; for eighteen months, pure opium, commencing with 15 grains and\r\nincreasing to 2 1/4 drams daily; and for eighteen months morphin, in\r\ncommencing quantities of six grains, which were later increased to 40\r\ngrains a day. When deprived of their accustomed dose of morphin the\r\nsufferings which these patients experience are terrific, and they\r\npursue all sorts of deceptions to enable them to get their enslaving\r\ndrug.  Patients have been known to conceal tubes in their mouths, and\r\neven swallow them, and the authors know of a fatal instance in which a\r\ntube of hypodermic tablets of the drug was found concealed in the\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\nThe administration of such an inert substance as the infusion of\r\norange-peel has been sufficient to invariably produce nervous\r\nexcitement in a patient afflicted with carcinoma.\r\n\r\nSonnenschein refers to a case of an infant of five weeks who died from\r\nthe effects of one phosphorous match head containing only 1/100 grain\r\nof phosphorus. There are certain people who by reason of a special\r\nsusceptibility cannot tolerate phosphorus, and the exhibition of it\r\ncauses in them nausea, oppression, and a feeling of pain in the\r\nepigastric region, tormina and tenesmus, accompanied with diarrhea, and\r\nin rare cases jaundice, sometimes lasting several months. In such\r\npersons 1/30 grain is capable of causing the foregoing symptoms. In\r\n1882 a man was admitted to Guy's Hospital, London, after he had taken\r\nhalf of a sixpenny pot of phosphorous paste in whiskey, and was\r\nsubsequently discharged completely recovered.\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature of phosphorus-poisoning is necrosis of the jaw. This\r\naffection was first noticed in 1838, soon after the introduction of the\r\nmanufacture of phosphorous matches. In late years, owing to the\r\nintroduction of precautions in their manufacture, the disease has\r\nbecome much less common. The tipping of the match sticks is\r\naccomplished by dipping their ends in a warm solution of a composition\r\nof phosphorus, chlorate of potassium, with particles of ground flint to\r\nassist friction, some coloring agent, and Irish glue. From the contents\r\nof the dipping-pans fumes constantly arise into the faces of the\r\nworkmen and dippers, and in cutting the sticks and packing the matches\r\nthe hands are constantly in contact with phosphorus. The region chiefly\r\naffected in this poisoning is the jaw-bone, but the inflammation may\r\nspread to the adjoining bones and involve the vomer, the zygoma, the\r\nbody of the spheroid bone, and the basilar process of the occipital\r\nbone. It is supposed that conditions in which the periosteum is exposed\r\nare favorable to the progress of the disease, and, according to Hirt,\r\nworkmen with diseased teeth are affected three times as readily as\r\nthose with healthy teeth, and are therefore carefully excluded from\r\nsome of the factories in America.\r\n\r\nPrentiss of Washington, D.C., in 1881 reported a remarkable case of\r\npilocarpin idiosyncrasy in a blonde of twenty-five. He was consulted by\r\nthe patient for constipation. Later on symptoms of cystitis developed,\r\nand an ultimate diagnosis of pyelitis of the right kidney was made.\r\nUremic symptoms were avoided by the constant use of pilocarpin. Between\r\nDecember 16, 1880, and February 22, 1881, the patient had 22 sweats\r\nfrom pilocarpin. The action usually lasted from two to six hours, and\r\nquite a large dose was at length necessary. The idiosyncrasy noted was\r\nfound in the hair, which at first was quite light, afterward\r\nchestnut-brown, and May 1, 1881, almost pure black. The growth of the\r\nhair became more vigorous and thicker than formerly, and as its color\r\ndarkened it became coarser in proportion. In March, 1889, Prentiss saw\r\nhis patient, and at that time her hair was dark brown, having returned\r\nto that color from black. Prentiss also reported the following case a\r\nas adding another to the evidence that jaborandi will produce the\r\neffect mentioned under favorable circumstances: Mrs. L., aged\r\nseventy-two years, was suffering from Bright's disease (contracted\r\nkidney). Her hair and eyebrows had been snow-white for twenty years.\r\nShe suffered greatly from itching of the skin, due to the uremia of the\r\nkidney-disease; the skin was harsh and dry. For this symptom fluid\r\nextract of jaborandi was prescribed with the effect of relieving the\r\nitching. It was taken in doses of 20 or 30 drops several times a day,\r\nfrom October, 1886, to February, 1888.  During the fall of 1887 it was\r\nnoticed by the nurse that the eyebrows were growing darker, and that\r\nthe hair of the head was darker in patches. These patches and the\r\neyebrows continued to become darker, until at the time of her death\r\nthey were quite black, the black tufts on the head presenting a very\r\ncurious appearance among the silver-white hairs surrounding them.\r\n\r\nQuinin being such a universally used drug, numerous instances of\r\nidiosyncrasy and intolerance have been recorded. Chevalier mentions\r\nthat through contact of the drug workmen in the manufacture of quinin\r\nare liable to an affection of the skin which manifests itself in a\r\nvesicular, papular, or pustular eruption on different parts of the\r\nbody. Vepan mentions a lady who took 1 1/2 grains and afterward 2 1/2\r\ngrains of quinin for neuralgia, and two days afterward her body was\r\ncovered with purpuric spots, which disappeared in the course of nine\r\ndays but reappeared after the administration of the drug was resumed.\r\nLewin says that in this case the severity of the eruption was in\r\naccordance with the size of the dose, and during its existence there\r\nwas bleeding at the gums; he adds that Gouchet also noticed an eruption\r\nof this kind in a lady who after taking quinin expectorated blood. The\r\npetechiae were profusely spread over the entire body, and they\r\ndisappeared after the suspension of the drug. Dauboeuf, Garraway,\r\nHemming, Skinner, and Cobner mention roseola and scarlatiniform\r\nerythema after minute doses of quinin.  In nearly all these cases the\r\naccompanying symptoms were different. Heusinger speaks of a lady who,\r\nafter taking 1/2 grain of quinin, experienced headache, nausea, intense\r\nburning, and edema, together with nodular erythema on the eyelids,\r\ncheeks, and portion of the forehead. At another time 1 1/2 grains of\r\nthe drug gave rise to herpetic vesicles on the cheeks, followed by\r\nbranny desquamation on elimination of the drug. In other patients\r\nintense itching is experienced after the ingestion of quinin.  Peters\r\ncites an instance of a woman of sixty-five who, after taking one grain\r\nof quinin, invariably exhibited after an hour a temperature of from 104\r\ndegrees to 105 degrees F., accelerated pulse, rigors, slight delirium,\r\nthirst, and all the appearances of ill-defined fever, which would pass\r\noff in from twelve to twenty-four hours. Peters witnessed this\r\nidiosyncrasy several times and believed it to be permanent. The most\r\nunpleasant of the untoward symptoms of quinin exhibition are the\r\ndisturbances of the organs of special sense. Photophobia, and even\r\ntransient amblyopia, have been observed to follow small doses. In the\r\nexamination of cases of the untoward effects of quinin upon the eye,\r\nKnapp of New York found the power of sight diminished in various\r\ndegrees, and rarely amaurosis and immobility of the pupils. According\r\nto Lewin, the perceptions of color and light are always diminished, and\r\nalthough the disorder may last for some time the prognosis is\r\nfavorable. The varieties of the disturbances of the functions of the\r\near range from tinnitus aurium to congestion causing complete deafness.\r\nThe gastro-intestinal and genito-urinary tracts are especially disposed\r\nto untoward action by quinin. There is a case recorded in which, after\r\nthe slightest dose of quinin, tingling and burning at the meatus\r\nurinarius were experienced. According to Lewin, there is mentioned in\r\nthe case reported by Gauchet a symptom quite unique in the literature\r\nof quinin, viz., hemoptysis. Simon de Ronchard first noted the\r\noccurrence of several cases of hemoptysis following the administration\r\nof doses of eight grains daily. In the persons thus attacked the lungs\r\nand heart were healthy. Hemoptysis promptly ceased with the suspension\r\nof the drug. When it was renewed, blood again appeared in the sputa.\r\nTaussig mentions a curious mistake, in which an ounce of quinin\r\nsulphate was administered to a patient at one dose; the only symptoms\r\nnoticed were a stuporous condition and complete deafness. No antidote\r\nwas given, and the patient perfectly recovered in a week. In malarious\r\ncountries, and particularly in the malarial fevers of the late war,\r\nenormous quantities of quinin were frequently given. In fact, at the\r\npresent day in some parts of the South quinin is constantly kept on the\r\ntable as a prophylactic constituent of the diet.\r\n\r\nSkinner noticed the occurrence of a scarlatiniform eruption in a woman\r\nafter the dose of 1/165 grain of strychnin, which, however, disappeared\r\nwith the discontinuance of the drug. There was a man in London in 1865\r\nwho died in twenty minute's after the ingestion of 1/2 grain of\r\nstrychnin. Wood speaks of a case in which the administration of 1/100\r\ngrain killed a child three and one-half months old. Gray speaks of a\r\nman who took 22 grains and was not seen for about an hour. He had\r\nvomited some of it immediately after taking the dose, and was\r\nsuccessfully treated with chloral hydrate. A curious case is mentioned\r\nin which three mustard plasters, one on the throat, one on the back of\r\nthe neck, and another on the left shoulder of a woman, produced\r\nsymptoms similar to strychnin poisoning. They remained in position for\r\nabout thirty minutes, and about thirty hours afterward a painful\r\nstinging sensation commenced in the back of the neck, followed by\r\nviolent twitching of the muscles of the face, arms, and legs, which\r\ncontinued in regular succession through the whole of the night, but\r\nafter twelve hours yielded to hot fomentations of poppy-heads applied\r\nto the back of the neck. It could not be ascertained whether any\r\nmedicine containing strychnin had been taken, but surely, from the\r\nsymptoms, such must have been the case.\r\n\r\nTobacco.--O'Neill a gives the history of a farmer's wife, aged forty,\r\nwho wounded her leg against a sewing-machine, and by lay advice applied\r\na handful of chopped wet tobacco to it, from which procedure, strange\r\nto say, serious nicotin-poisoning ensued. The pupils were dilated,\r\nthere were dimness of vision, confusion of thought, and extreme\r\nprostration. The pulse was scarcely apparent, the skin was white and\r\nwet with clammy perspiration.  Happily, strychnin was given in time to\r\neffect recovery, and without early medical assistance she would\r\nundoubtedly have succumbed. There are several similar cases on record.\r\n\r\nAlthough not immediately related to the subject of idiosyncrasy, the\r\nfollowing case may be mentioned here: Ramadge speaks of a young\r\nFrenchman, suffering from an obstinate case of gonorrhea, who was said\r\nto have been completely cured by living in a newly painted house in\r\nwhich he inhaled the odors or vapors of turpentine.\r\n\r\nWhite speaks of a case of exanthematous eruption similar to that of\r\nivy-poison in mother and child, which was apparently caused by playing\r\nwith and burning the toy called \"Pharaoh's serpent egg.\"\r\n\r\nThe idiosyncrasies noticed in some persons during coitus are quite\r\ninteresting. The Ephemerides mentions a person in whom coitus\r\nhabitually caused vomiting, and another in whom excessive sexual\r\nindulgence provoked singultus. Sometimes exaggerated tremors or\r\nconvulsions, particularly at the moment of orgasm, are noticed. Females\r\nespecially are subject to this phenomenon, and it is seen sometimes in\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nWinn reports the case of a man who, when prompted to indulge in sexual\r\nintercourse, was immediately prior to the act seized with a fit of\r\nsneezing. Even the thought of sexual pleasure with a female was\r\nsufficient to provoke this peculiar idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\nSullivan mentions a bride of four weeks, who called at the doctor's\r\noffice, saying that in coitus her partner had no difficulty until the\r\npoint of culmination or orgasm, when he was seized with complete\r\nnumbness and lost all pleasurable sensation in the penis. The numbness\r\nwas followed by a sensation of pain, which was intensified on the\r\nslightest motion, and which was at times so excruciating as to forbid\r\nseparation for upward of an hour, or until the penis had become\r\nflaccid. The woman asked for advice for her unfortunate husband's\r\nrelief, and the case was reported as a means of obtaining suggestions\r\nfrom the physicians over the country. In response, one theory was\r\nadvanced that this man had been in the habit of masturbating and had a\r\nstricture of the membranous portion of the urethra, associated with an\r\nulcer of the prostate involving the ejaculatory ducts, or an\r\ninflammatory condition of all the tissues compressed by the ejaculatory\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nHendrichsen quotes a case in which a spasmodic contraction of the\r\nlevator ani occurred during coitus, and the penis could not be\r\nwithdrawn while this condition lasted; and in support of this\r\ncircumstance Hendrichsen mentions that Marion Sims, Beigel, and Budin\r\ndescribe spasmodic contractions of the levator and, constricting the\r\nvagina; he also cites an instance under his personal observation in\r\nwhich this spasm was excited by both vaginal and rectal examination,\r\nalthough on the following day no such condition could be produced. In\r\nthis connection, among the older writers, Borellus gives the history of\r\na man who before coitus rubbed his virile member with musk, and,\r\nsimilar to the connection of a dog and bitch, was held fast in his\r\nwife's vagina; it was only after the injection of great quantities of\r\nwater to soften the parts that separation was obtained.  Diemerbroeck\r\nconfirms this singular property of musk by an analogous observation, in\r\nwhich the ludicrous method of throwing cold water on the persons was\r\npractised. Schurig also relates the history of a similar instance.\r\n\r\nAmong the peculiar effects of coitus is its deteriorating effect on the\r\nhealing process of wounds. Boerhaave, Pare, and Fabricius Hildanus all\r\nspeak of this untoward effect of venery, and in modern times Poncet has\r\nmade observations at a hospital in Lyons which prove that during the\r\nprocess of healing wounds are unduly and harmfully influenced by\r\ncoitus, and cites confirmatory instances. Poncet also remarks that he\r\nfound on nine occasions, by placing a thermometer in the rectum, that\r\nthe temperature was about 1 degrees F. lower just before than after\r\ncoitus, and that during the act the temperature gradually rose above\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nThere are many associate conditions which, under the exciting influence\r\nof coitus, provoke harmful effects and even a fatal issue. Deguise\r\nmentions a man who had coitus 18 times in ten hours with most\r\ndisastrous effects. Cabrolius speaks of a man who took a potion of\r\naphrodisiac properties, in which, among other things, he put an\r\nenormous dose of cantharides. The anticipation of the effect of his\r\ndose, that is, the mental influence, in addition to the actual\r\ntherapeutic effect, greatly distressed and excited him. Almost beyond\r\nbelief, it is said that he approached his wife eighty-seven times\r\nduring the night, spilling much sperm on the sleeping-bed. Cabrolius\r\nwas called to see this man in the morning, and found him in a most\r\nexhausted condition, but still having the supposed consecutive\r\nejaculations. Exhaustion progressed rapidly, and death soon terminated\r\nthis erotic crisis.  Lawson is accredited with saying that among the\r\nMarquesan tribe he knew of a woman who during a single night had\r\nintercourse with 103 men.\r\n\r\nAmong the older writers there are instances reported in which erection\r\nand ejaculation took place without the slightest pleasurable sensation.\r\nClaudius exemplifies this fact in his report of a Venetian merchant who\r\nhad vigorous erections and ejaculations of thick and abundant semen\r\nwithout either tingling or pleasure.\r\n\r\nAttila, King of the Huns, and one of the most celebrated leaders of the\r\nGerman hosts which overran the Roman Empire in its decline, and whose\r\nenormous army and name inspired such terror that he was called the\r\n\"Scourge of God,\" was supposed to have died in coitus. Apoplexy,\r\norganic heart disorders, aneurysms, and other like disorders are in\r\nsuch cases generally the direct cause of death, coitus causing the\r\ndeath indirectly by the excitement and exertion accompanying the act.\r\n\r\nBartholinus, Benedictus, Borellus, Pliny, Morgagni, Plater, a Castro,\r\nForestus, Marcellus Donatus, Schurig, Sinibaldus, Schenck, the\r\nEphemerides, and many others mention death during coitus; the older\r\nwriters in some cases attributed the fatal issue to excessive sexual\r\nindulgence, not considering the possibility of the associate direct\r\ncause, which most likely would have been found in case of a necropsy.\r\n\r\nSuspended Animation.--Various opinions have been expressed as to the\r\nlength of time compatible with life during which a person can stay\r\nunder water. Recoveries from drowning furnish interesting examples of\r\nthe suspension of animation for a protracted period, but are hardly\r\never reliable, as the subject at short intervals almost invariably\r\nrises to the surface of the water, allowing occasional respiration.\r\nTaylor mentions a child of two who recovered after ten minutes'\r\nsubmersion; in another case a man recovered after fourteen minutes'\r\nsubmersion. There is a case reported in this country of a woman who was\r\nsaid to have been submerged twenty minutes. Guerard quotes a case\r\nhappening in 1774, in which there was submersion for an hour with\r\nsubsequent recovery; but there hardly seems sufficient evidence of this.\r\n\r\nGreen mentions submersion for fifteen minutes; Douglass, for fourteen\r\nminutes; Laub, for fifteen minutes; Povall gives a description of three\r\npersons who recovered after a submersion of twenty-five minutes. There\r\nis a case in French literature, apparently well authenticated, in which\r\nsubmersion for six minutes was followed by subsequent recovery.\r\n\r\nThere have been individuals who gave exhibitions of prolonged\r\nsubmersion in large glass aquariums, placed in full view of the\r\naudience. Taylor remarks that the person known some years ago in London\r\nas \"Lurline\" could stay under water for three minutes.  There have been\r\nseveral exhibitionists of this sort. Some of the more enterprising seat\r\nthemselves on an artificial coral, and surrounded by fishes of divers\r\nhues complacently eat a meal while thus submerged. It is said that\r\nquite recently in Detroit there was a performer who accomplished the\r\nfeat of remaining under water four minutes and eight seconds in full\r\nview of the audience. Miss Lurline swam about in her aquarium, which\r\nwas brilliantly illuminated, ate, reclined, and appeared to be taking a\r\nshort nap during her short immersion. In Paris, some years since, there\r\nwas exhibited a creature called \"l'homme-poisson,\" who performed feats\r\nsimilar to Lurline, including the smoking of a cigarette held entirely\r\nin his mouth. In all these exhibitions all sorts of artificial means\r\nare used to make the submersion appear long. Great ceremony, music, and\r\nthe counting of the seconds in a loud voice from the stage, all tend to\r\nmake the time appear much longer than it really is. However, James\r\nFinney in London, April 7, 1886, stayed under water four minutes,\r\ntwenty-nine and one-fourth seconds, and one of his feats was to pick up\r\n70 or 80 gold-plated half-pennies with his mouth, his hands being\r\nsecurely tied behind his back, and never emerging from his tank until\r\nhis feat was fully accomplished. In company with his sister he played a\r\ngame of \"nap\" under water, using porcelain cards and turning them to\r\nthe view of the audience.  \"Professor Enochs\" recently stayed under\r\nwater at Lowell, Mass., for four minutes, forty-six and one-fifth\r\nseconds. The best previous record was four minutes, thirty-five\r\nseconds, made by \"Professor Beaumont\" at Melbourne on December 16, 1893.\r\n\r\nFor the most satisfactory examples of prolonged submersion we must look\r\nto the divers, particularly the natives who trade in coral, and the\r\npearl fishers. Diving is an ancient custom, and even legendary exploits\r\nof this nature are recorded. Homer compares the fall of Hector's\r\nchariot to the action of a diver; and specially trained men were\r\nemployed at the Siege of Syracuse, their mission being to laboriously\r\nscuttle the enemy's vessels.  Many of the old historians mention\r\ndiving, and Herodotus speaks of a diver by the name of Scyllias who was\r\nengaged by Xerxes to recover some articles of value which had been sunk\r\non some Persian vessels in a tempest. Egyptian divers are mentioned by\r\nPlutarch, who says that Anthony was deceived by Cleopatra in a fishing\r\ncontest by securing expert divers to place the fish upon the hooks.\r\nThere was a historical or rather legendary character by the name of\r\nDidion, who was noted for his exploits in the river Meuse. He had the\r\nability to stay under water a considerable length of time, and even to\r\ncatch fish while submerged.\r\n\r\nThere was a famous diver in Sicily at the end of the fifteenth century\r\nwhose feats are recorded in the writings of Alexander ab Alexandro,\r\nPontanus, and Father Kircher, the Jesuit savant. This man's name was\r\nNicolas, born of poor parents at Catania. From his infancy he showed an\r\nextraordinary power of diving and swimming, and from his compatriots\r\nsoon acquired various names indicative of his capacity. He became very\r\nwell known throughout Sicily, and for his patron had Frederick, King of\r\nNaples. In the present day, the sponge-fishers and pearl-fishers in the\r\nWest Indies, the Mediterranean, the Indian Seas, and the Gulf of Mexico\r\ninvite the attention of those interested in the anomalies of suspended\r\nanimation. There are many marvelous tales of their ability to remain\r\nunder water for long periods. It is probable that none remain submerged\r\nover two minutes, but, what is more remarkable, they are supposed to\r\ndive to extraordinary depths, some as much as 150 to 200 feet.\r\nOrdinarily they remain under water from a minute to one and a half\r\nminutes. Remaining longer, the face becomes congested, the eyes\r\ninjected; the sputum bloody, due to rupture of some of the minute\r\nvessels in the lung. It is said by those who have observed them\r\ncarefully that few of these divers live to an advanced age. Many of\r\nthem suffer apoplectic attacks, and some of them become blind from\r\ncongestion of the ocular vessels. The Syrian divers are supposed to\r\ncarry weights of considerable size in their hands in order to\r\nfacilitate the depth and duration of submersion. It is also said that\r\nthe divers of Oceanica use heavy stones. According to Guyot-Daubes, in\r\nthe Philippine Isles the native pearl-fishers teach their children to\r\ndive to the depth of 25 meters. The Tahitians, who excited the\r\nadmiration of Cook, are noted for their extraordinary diving.  Speaking\r\nof the inhabitants of the island of Fakaraya, near Tahiti, de la\r\nQuesnerie says that the pearl-fishers do not hesitate to dive to the\r\ndepth even of 100 feet after their coveted prizes. On the Ceylon coast\r\nthe mother-of-pearl fishers are under the direction of the English\r\nGovernment, which limits the duration and the practice of this\r\noccupation. These divers are generally Cingalese, who practice the\r\nexercise from infancy.  As many as 500 small boats can be seen about\r\nthe field of operation, each equipped with divers. A single diver makes\r\nabout ten voyages under the water, and then rests in the bottom of the\r\nboat, when his comrade takes his place. Among other native divers are\r\nthe Arabs of Algeria and some of the inhabitants of the Mexican coast.\r\n\r\nIt might be well to mention here the divers who work by means of\r\napparatus. The ancients had knowledge of contrivances whereby they\r\ncould stay under water some time. Aristotle speaks of an instrument by\r\nwhich divers could rest under water in communication with the air, and\r\ncompares it with the trunk of an elephant wading a stream deeper than\r\nhis height. In the presence of Charles V diving bells were used by the\r\nGreeks in 1540. In 1660 some of the cannon of the sunken ships of the\r\nSpanish Armada were raised by divers in diving bells. Since then\r\nvarious improvements in submarine armor have been made, gradually\r\nevolving into the present perfected diving apparatus of to-day, by\r\nwhich men work in the holds of vessels sunk in from 120 to 200 feet of\r\nwater. The enormous pressure of the water at these great depths makes\r\nit necessary to have suits strong enough to resist it. Lambert, a\r\ncelebrated English diver, recovered L90,000 in specie from the steamer\r\nAlphonso XII, a Spanish mail boat belonging to the Lopez line, which\r\nsank off Point Gando, Grand Canary, in 26 1/2 fathoms of water. For\r\nnearly six months the salvage party, despatched by the underwriters in\r\nMay, 1885, persevered in the operations; two divers lost their lives,\r\nthe golden bait being in the treasure-room beneath the three decks, but\r\nLambert finished the task successfully.\r\n\r\nDeep-sea divers only acquire proficiency after long training. It is\r\nsaid that as a rule divers are indisposed to taking apprentices, as\r\nthey are afraid of their vocation being crowded and their present ample\r\nremuneration diminished. At present there are several schools. At\r\nChatham, England, there is a school of submarine mining, in which men\r\nare trained to lay torpedoes and complete harbor defense. Most of these\r\ndivers can work six hours at a time in from 35 to 50 feet of water.\r\nDivers for the Royal Navy are trained at Sheerness. When sufficiently\r\ntrained to work at the depth of 150 feet seamen-divers are fully\r\nqualified, and are drafted to the various ships. They are connected\r\nwith an air-pump in charge of trustworthy men; they signal for their\r\ntools and material, as well as air, by means of a special line for this\r\npurpose. At some distance below the water the extraordinary weight of\r\nthe suits cannot be felt, and the divers work as well in armor as in\r\nordinary laboring clothes. One famous diver says that the only\r\nunpleasant experience he ever had in his career as a diver, not\r\nexcepting the occasion of his first dive, was a drumming in the ears,\r\nas a consequence of which, after remaining under water at a certain\r\nwork for nine hours, he completely lost the use of one ear for three\r\nmonths, during which time he suffered agony with the earache. These men\r\nexhibit absolute indifference to the dangers attached to their calling,\r\nand some have been known to sleep many fathoms beneath the surface.\r\nBoth by means of their signal lines and by writing on a slate they keep\r\ntheir associates informed of the progress of their work.\r\n\r\nSuspension of the Pulse.--In some cases the pulse is not apparent for\r\nmany days before actual death, and there have been instances in which,\r\nalthough the pulse ceased for an extended period, the patient made an\r\nultimate recovery. In reviewing the older literature we find that\r\nBallonius mentions an instance in which the pulse was not apparent for\r\nfourteen days before complete asphyxia. Ramazzini describes a case of\r\ncessation of the pulse four days before death. Schenck details the\r\nhistory of a case in which the pulse ceased for three days and asphyxia\r\nwas almost total, but the patient eventually recovered. There is a\r\nnoteworthy observation, in which there was cessation of the pulse for\r\nnine days without a fatal issue.\r\n\r\nSome persons seem to have a preternatural control over their\r\ncirculatory system, apparently enabling them to produce suspension of\r\ncardiac movement at will. Cheyne speaks of a Colonel Townshend who\r\nappeared to possess the power of dying, as it were, at will,--that is,\r\nso suspending the heart's action that no pulsation could be detected.\r\nAfter lying in this state of lifelessness for a short period, life\r\nwould become slowly established without any consciousness or volition\r\non the man's part. The longest period in which he remained in this\r\ndeath-like condition was about thirty minutes. A postmortem examination\r\nof this person was awaited with great interest; but after his death\r\nnothing was found to explain the power he possessed over his heart.\r\n\r\nSaint Augustin knew of a priest named Rutilut who had the power of\r\nvoluntarily simulating death. Both the pulsation and respiration was\r\napparently abolished when he was in his lifeless condition. Burning and\r\npricking left visible effects on the skin after his recovery, but had\r\nno apparent effect on his lethargy.  Chaille reports an instance of\r\nvoluntary suspension of the pulse.\r\n\r\nRelative to hibernation, it is well-known that mice, snakes, and some\r\nreptiles, as well as bees, sometimes seem to entirely suspend animation\r\nfor an extended period, and especially in the cold weather. In Russia\r\nfish are transported frozen stiff, but return to life after being\r\nplunged into cold water. A curious tale is told by Harley, from Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock, of a snail brought from Egypt and thought to be dead. It\r\nwas placed on a card and put in position on a shelf in the British\r\nMuseum in March, 1845.  In March, 1850 after having been gummed to a\r\nlabel for five years, it was noticed to have an apparent growth on its\r\nmouth and was taken out and placed in water, when it soon showed signs\r\nof life and ate cabbage leaves offered to it. It has been said, we\r\nthink with credible evidence, that cereal seeds found in the tombs with\r\nmummies have grown when planted, and Harley quotes an instance of a\r\ngentleman who took some berries, possibly the remnants of Pharaoh's\r\ndaughter's last meal, coming as they did from her mummified stomach\r\nafter lying dormant in an Egyptian tomb many centuries, and planted\r\nthem in his garden, where they soon grew, and he shortly had a bush as\r\nflourishing as any of those emanating from fresh seeds.\r\n\r\nHuman hibernation is an extremely rare anomaly. Only the fakirs of\r\nIndia seem to have developed this power, and even the gifted ones there\r\nare seldom seen. Many theories have been advanced to explain this\r\nability of the fakirs, and many persons have discredited all the\r\nstories relative to their powers; on the other hand, all who have\r\nwitnessed their exhibitions are convinced of their genuineness.\r\nFurthermore, these persons are extremely scarce and are indifferent to\r\nmoney; none has been enticed out of his own country to give\r\nexhibitions. When one dies in a community, his place is never\r\nfilled--proving that he had no accomplices who knew any fraudulent\r\nsecret practices, otherwise the accomplice would soon step out to take\r\nhis place. These men have undoubtedly some extraordinary mode of\r\nsending themselves into a long trance, during which the functions of\r\nlife are almost entirely suspended. We can readily believe in their\r\nability to fast during their periods of burial, as we have already\r\nrelated authentic instances of fasting for a great length of time,\r\nduring which the individual exercised his normal functions.\r\n\r\nTo the fakir, who neither visibly breathes nor shows circulatory\r\nmovements, and who never moves from his place of confinement, fasting\r\nshould be comparatively easy, when we consider the number of men whose\r\nminds were actively at work during their fasts, and who also exercised\r\nmuch physical power.\r\n\r\nHarley says that the fakirs begin their performances by taking a large\r\ndose of the powerfully stupefying \"bang,\" thus becoming narcotized. In\r\nthis state they are lowered into a cool, quiet tomb, which still\r\nfurther favors the prolongation of the artificially induced vital\r\nlethargy; in this condition they rest for from six to eight weeks. When\r\nresurrected they are only by degrees restored to life, and present a\r\nwan, haggard, debilitated, and wasted appearance. Braid is credited, on\r\nthe authority of Sir Claude Wade, with stating that a fakir was buried\r\nin an unconscious state at Lahore in 1837, and when dug up, six weeks\r\nlater, he presented all the appearances of a dead person. The legs and\r\narms were shrunken and stiff, and the head reclined on the shoulder in\r\na manner frequently seen in a corpse.  There was no pulsation of the\r\nheart or arteries of the arm or temple--in fact, no really visible\r\nsigns of life. By degrees this person was restored to life. Every\r\nprecaution had been taken in this case to prevent the possibility of\r\nfraud, and during the period of interment the grave was guarded night\r\nand day by soldiers of the regiment stationed at Lahore.\r\n\r\nHonigberger, a German physician in the employ of Runjeet Singh, has an\r\naccount of a fakir of Punjaub who allowed himself to be buried in a\r\nwell-secured vault for such a long time that grain sown in the soil\r\nabove the vault sprouted into leaf before he was exhumed. Honigberger\r\naffirms that the time of burial was over 40 days, and that on being\r\nsubmitted to certain processes the man recovered and lived many years\r\nafter. Sir Henry Lawrence verified the foregoing statements. The chest\r\nin which the fakir was buried was sealed with the Runjeet stamp on it,\r\nand when the man was brought up he was cold and apparently lifeless.\r\nHonigberger also states that this man, whose name was Haridas, was four\r\nmonths in a grave in the mountains; to prove the absolute suspension of\r\nanimation, the chin was shaved before burial, and at exhumation this\r\npart was as smooth as on the day of interment. This latter statement\r\nnaturally calls forth comment when we consider the instances that are\r\non record of the growth of beard and hair after death.\r\n\r\nThere is another account of a person of the same class who had the\r\npower of suspending animation, and who would not allow his coffin to\r\ntouch the earth for fear of worms and insects, from which he is said to\r\nhave suffered at a previous burial.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the fakirs are either eunuchs or\r\nhermaphrodites, social outcasts, having nothing in common with the\r\nwomen or men of their neighborhood; but Honigberger mentions one who\r\ndisproved this ridiculous theory by eloping to the mountains with his\r\nneighbor's wife.\r\n\r\nInstances of recovery after asphyxia from hanging are to be found,\r\nparticularly among the older references of a time when hanging was more\r\ncommon than it is to-day. Bartholinus, Blegny, Camerarius, Morgagni,\r\nPechlin, Schenck, Stoll, and Wepfer all mention recovery after hanging.\r\nForestus describes a case in which a man was rescued by provoking\r\nvomiting with vinegar, pepper, and mustard seed. There is a case on\r\nrecord in which a person was saved after hanging nineteen minutes.\r\nThere was a case of a man brought into the Hopital Saint-Louis\r\nasphyxiated by strangulation, having been hung for some time. His\r\nrectal temperature was only 93.3 degrees F., but six hours after it\r\nrose to 101.6 degrees F., and he subsequently recovered. Taylor cites\r\nthe instance of a stout woman of forty-four who recovered from hanging.\r\nWhen the woman was found by her husband she was hanging from the top of\r\na door, having been driven to suicide on account of his abuse and\r\nintemperance. When first seen by Taylor she was comatose, her mouth was\r\nsurrounded by white froth, and the swollen tongue protruded from it.\r\nHer face was bloated, her lips of a darkened hue, and her neck of a\r\nbrown parchment-color. About the level of the larynx, the epidermis was\r\ndistinctly abraded, indicating where the rope had been. The conjunctiva\r\nwas insensible and there was no contractile response of the pupil to\r\nthe light of a candle. The reflexes of the soles of the feet were\r\ntested, but were quite in abeyance. There was no respiratory movement\r\nand only slight cardiac pulsation. After vigorous measures the woman\r\nultimately recovered. Recovery is quite rare when the asphyxiation has\r\ngone so far, the patients generally succumbing shortly after being cut\r\ndown or on the following day.  Chevers mentions a most curious case, in\r\nwhich cerebral congestion from the asphyxiation of strangling was\r\naccidentally relieved by an additional cut across the throat. The\r\npatient was a man who was set upon by a band of Thugs in India, who,\r\npursuant to their usual custom, strangled him and his fellow-traveler.\r\nNot being satisfied that he was quite dead, one of the band returned\r\nand made several gashes across his throat. This latter action\r\neffectually relieved the congestion caused by the strangulation and\r\nundoubtedly saved his life, while his unmutilated companion was found\r\ndead. After the wounds in his throat had healed this victim of the\r\nThugs gave such a good description of the murderous band that their\r\napprehension and execution soon followed.\r\n\r\nPremature Burial.--In some instances simulation of death has been so\r\nexact that it has led to premature interment. There are many such cases\r\non record, and it is a popular superstition of the laity that all the\r\ngruesome tales are true of persons buried alive and returning to life,\r\nonly to find themselves hopelessly lost in a narrow coffin many feet\r\nbelow the surface of the earth.  Among the lower classes the dread of\r\nbeing buried before life is extinct is quite generally felt, and for\r\ngenerations the medical profession have been denounced for their\r\ninability to discover an infallible sign of death. Most of the\r\ninstances on record, and particularly those from lay journals, are\r\nvivid exaggerations, drawn from possibly such a trivial sign as a\r\ncorpse found with the fist tightly clenched or the face distorted,\r\nwhich are the inspiration of the horrible details of the dying\r\nstruggles of the person in the coffin. In the works of Fontenelle there\r\nare 46 cases recorded of the premature interment of the living, in\r\nwhich apparent has been mistaken for real death. None of these cases,\r\nhowever, are sufficiently authentic to be reliable. Moreover, in all\r\nmodern methods of burial, even if life were not extinct, there could be\r\nno possibility of consciousness or of struggling.  Absolute\r\nasphyxiation would soon follow the closing of the coffin lid.\r\n\r\nWe must admit, however, that the mistake has been made, particularly in\r\ninstances of catalepsy or trance, and during epidemics of malignant\r\nfevers or plagues, in which there is an absolute necessity of hasty\r\nburial for the prevention of contagion. In a few instances on the\r\nbattle-field sudden syncope, or apparent death, has possibly led to\r\npremature interment; but in the present day this is surely a very rare\r\noccurrence. There is also a danger of mistake from cases of\r\nasphyxiation, drowning, and similar sudden suspensions of the vital\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in the eighty-fourth Olympiad, Empedocles restored to\r\nlife a woman who was about to be buried, and that this circumstance\r\ninduced the Greeks, for the future protection of the supposed dead, to\r\nestablish laws which enacted that no person should be interred until\r\nthe sixth or seventh day. But even this extension of time did not give\r\nsatisfaction, and we read that when Hephestion, at whose funeral\r\nobsequies Alexander the Great was present, was to be buried his funeral\r\nwas delayed until the tenth day. There is also a legend that when\r\nAcilius Aviola fell a victim to disease he was burned alive, and\r\nalthough he cried out, it was too late to save him, as the fire had\r\nbecome so widespread before life returned.\r\n\r\nWhile returning to his country house Asclepiades, a physician\r\ndenominated the \"God of Physic,\" and said to have been a descendant of\r\naesculapius, saw during the time of Pompey the Great a crowd of\r\nmourners about to start a fire on a funeral pile. It is said that by\r\nhis superior knowledge he perceived indications of life in the corpse\r\nand ordered the pile destroyed, subsequently restoring the supposed\r\ndeceased to life. These examples and several others of a similar nature\r\ninduced the Romans to delay their funeral rites, and laws were enacted\r\nto prevent haste in burning, as well as in interment. It was not until\r\nthe eighth day that the final rites were performed, the days\r\nimmediately subsequent to death having their own special ceremonies.\r\nThe Turks were also fearful of premature interment and subjected the\r\ndefunct to every test; among others, one was to examine the\r\ncontractility of the sphincter and, which shows their keen observation\r\nof a well-known modern medical fact.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Memoirs of Amelot de la Houssaye, Cardinal Espinola,\r\nPrime Minister to Philip II, put his hand to the embalmer's knife with\r\nwhich he was about to be opened; It is said that Vesalius, sometimes\r\ncalled the \"Father of Anatomy,\" having been sent for to perform an\r\nautopsy on a woman subject to hysteric convulsions, and who was\r\nsupposed to be dead, on making the first incision perceived by her\r\nmotion and cries that she was still alive. This circumstance, becoming\r\nknown, rendered him so odious that he had to leave the community in\r\nwhich he practiced, and it is believed that he never entirely recovered\r\nfrom the shock it gave him. The Abbe Prevost, so well known by his\r\nworks and the singularities of his life, was seized by apoplexy in the\r\nForest of Chantilly on October 23, 1763. His body was carried to the\r\nnearest village, and the officers of justice proceeded to open it, when\r\na cry he sent forth frightened all the assistants and convinced the\r\nsurgeon in charge that the Abbe was not dead; but it was too late to\r\nsave him, as he had already received a mortal wound.\r\n\r\nMassien speaks of a woman living in Cologne in 1571 who was interred\r\nliving, but was not awakened from her lethargy until a grave-digger\r\nopened her grave to steal a valuable ring which she wore. This instance\r\nhas been cited in nearly every language.  There is another more recent\r\ninstance, coming from Poitiers, of the wife of a goldsmith named\r\nMernache who was buried with all her jewels. During the night a beggar\r\nattempted to steal her jewelry, and made such exertion in extracting\r\none ring that the woman recovered and was saved. After this\r\nresurrection she is said to have had several children. This case is\r\nalso often quoted. Zacchias mentions an instance which, from all\r\nappearances, is authentic. It was that of a young man, pest-stricken\r\nand thought to be dead, who was placed with the other dead for burial.\r\nHe exhibited signs of life, and was taken back to the pest-hospital.\r\nTwo days later he entered a lethargic condition simulating death, and\r\nwas again on his way to the sepulcher, when he once more recovered.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when the body of William, Earl of Pembroke, who died\r\nApril 10, 1630, was opened to be embalmed, the hand raised when the\r\nfirst incision was made. There is a story of an occurrence which\r\nhappened on a return voyage from India. The wife of one of the\r\npassengers, an officer in the army, to all appearances died. They were\r\nabout to resort to sea-burial, when, through the interposition of the\r\nhusband, who was anxious to take her home, the ship-carpenters started\r\nto construct a coffin suitable for a long voyage, a process which took\r\nseveral days, during which time she lay in her berth, swathed in robes\r\nand ready for interment. When the coffin was at last ready the husband\r\nwent to take his last farewell, and removed the wedding-ring, which was\r\nquite tightly on her finger. In the effort to do this she was aroused,\r\nrecovered, and arrived in England perfectly well.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when a daughter of Henry Laurens, the first President\r\nof the American Congress, died of small-pox, she was laid out as dead,\r\nand the windows of the room were opened for ventilation. While left\r\nalone in this manner she recovered. This circumstance so impressed her\r\nillustrious father that he left explicit directions that in case of his\r\ndeath he should be burned. The same journal also contains the case of a\r\nmaid-servant who recovered thrice on her way to the grave, and who,\r\nwhen really dead, was kept a preposterous length of time before burial.\r\n\r\nThe literature on this subject is very exhaustive, volumes having been\r\nwritten on the uncertainty of the signs of death, with hundreds of\r\nexamples cited illustrative of the danger of premature interment. The\r\nforegoing instances have been given as indicative of the general style\r\nof narration; for further information the reader is referred to the\r\nplethora of material on this subject.\r\n\r\nPostmortem Anomalies.--Among the older writers startling movements of a\r\ncorpse have given rise to much discussion, and possibly often led to\r\nsuspicion of premature burial. Bartholinus describes motion in a\r\ncadaver. Barlow says that movements were noticed after death in the\r\nvictims of Asiatic cholera. The bodies were cold and expressions were\r\ndeath-like, but there were movements simulating natural life. The most\r\ncommon was flexion of the right leg, which would also be drawn up\r\ntoward the body and resting on the left leg. In some cases the hand was\r\nmoved, and in one or two instances a substance was grasped as if by\r\nreflex action. Some observers have stated that reflex movements of the\r\nface were quite noticeable. These movements continued sometimes for\r\nupward of an hour, occurring mostly in muscular subjects who died very\r\nsuddenly, and in whom the muscular irritability or nervous stimulus or\r\nboth had not become exhausted at the moment of dissolution. Richardson\r\ndoubts the existence of postmortem movements of respiration.\r\n\r\nSnow is accredited with having seen a girl in Soho who, dying of\r\nscarlet fever, turned dark at the moment of death, but in a few hours\r\npresented such a life-line appearance and color as to almost denote the\r\nreturn of life. The center of the cheeks became colored in a natural\r\nfashion, and the rest of the body resumed the natural flesh color. The\r\nparents refused to believe that death had ensued. Richardson remarks\r\nthat he had seen two similar cases, and states that he believes the\r\nchange is due to oxidation of the blood surcharged with carbon dioxid.\r\nThe moist tissues suffuse carbonized blood, and there occurs an osmotic\r\ninterchange between the carbon dioxid and the oxygen of the air\r\nresulting in an oxygenation of the blood, and modification of the color\r\nfrom dark venous to arterial red.\r\n\r\nA peculiar postmortem anomaly is erection of the penis. The Ephemerides\r\nand Morgagni discuss postmortem erection, and Guyon mentions that on\r\none occasion he saw 14 negroes hanged, and states that at the moment of\r\nsuspension erection of the penis occurred in each; in nine of these\r\nblacks traces of this erectile state were perceived an hour after death.\r\n\r\nCadaveric perspiration has been observed and described by several\r\nauthors, and Paullini has stated that he has seen tears flow from the\r\neyes of a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe retardation of putrefaction of the body after death sometimes\r\npresents interesting changes. Petrifaction or mummification of the body\r\nare quite well known, and not being in the province of this work, will\r\nbe referred to collateral books on this subject; but sometimes an\r\nunaccountable preservation takes place. In a tomb recently opened at\r\nCanterbury Cathedral, a for the purpose of discovering what\r\nArchbishop's body it contained, the corpse was of an extremely\r\noffensive and sickening odor, unmistakably that of putrefaction. The\r\nbody was that of Hubert Walter, who died in 1204 A.D., and the\r\ndecomposition had been retarded, and was actually still in progress,\r\nseveral hundred years after burial.\r\n\r\nRetardation of the putrefactive process has been noticed in bodies some\r\nyears under water. Konig of Hermannstadt mentions a man who, forty\r\nyears previous to the time of report, had fallen under the waters of\r\nEchoschacht, and who was found in a complete state of preservation.\r\n\r\nPostmortem Growth of Hair and Nails.--The hair and beard may grow after\r\ndeath, and even change color. Bartholinus recalls a case of a man who\r\nhad short, black hair and beard at the time of interment, but who, some\r\ntime after death, was found to possess long and yellowish hair.\r\nAristotle discusses postmortem growth of the hair, and Garmanus cites\r\nan instance in which the beard and hair were cut several times from the\r\ncadaver. We occasionally see evidences of this in the dissecting-rooms.\r\nCaldwell mentions a body buried four years, the hair from which\r\nprotruded at the points where the joints of the coffin had given away.\r\nThe hair of the head measured 18 inches, that of the beard eight\r\ninches, and that on the breast from four to six inches. Rosse of\r\nWashington mentions an instance in which after burial the hair turned\r\nfrom dark brown to red, and also cites a case in a Washington cemetery\r\nof a girl, twelve or thirteen years old, who when exhumed was found to\r\nhave a new growth of hair all over her body. The Ephemerides contains\r\nan account of hair suddenly turning gray after death.\r\n\r\nNails sometimes grow several inches after death, and there is on record\r\nthe account of an idiot who had an idiosyncrasy for long nails, and\r\nafter death the nails were found to have grown to such an extent that\r\nthey curled up under the palms and soles.\r\n\r\nThe untoward effects of the emotions on the vital functions are quite\r\nwell exemplified in medical literature. There is an abundance of cases\r\nreported in which joy, fear, pride, and grief have produced a fatal\r\nissue. In history we have the old story of the Lacedemonian woman who\r\nfor some time had believed her son was dead, and who from the sudden\r\njoy occasioned by seeing him alive, herself fell lifeless. There is a\r\nsimilar instance in Roman history. Aristotle, Pliny, Livy, Cicero, and\r\nothers cite instances of death from sudden or excessive joy. Fouquet\r\ndied of excessive joy on being released from prison. A niece of the\r\ncelebrated Leibnitz immediately fell dead on seeing a casket of gold\r\nleft to her by her deceased uncle.\r\n\r\nGalen mentions death from joy, and in comment upon it he says that the\r\nemotion of joy is much more dangerous than that of anger. In discussing\r\nthis subject, Haller says that the blood is probably sent with such\r\nviolence to the brain as to cause apoplexy. There is one case on record\r\nin which after a death from sudden joy the pericardium was found full\r\nof blood. The Ephemerides, Marcellus Donatus, Martini, and Struthius\r\nall mention death from joy.\r\n\r\nDeath from violent laughter has been recorded, but in this instance it\r\nis very probable that death was not due to the emotion itself, but to\r\nthe extreme convulsion and exertion used in the laughter. The\r\nEphemerides mentions a death from laughter, and also describes the\r\ndeath of a pregnant woman from violent mirth. Roy, Swinger, and\r\nCamerarius have recorded instances of death from laughter. Strange as\r\nit may seem, Saint-Foix says that the Moravian brothers, a sect of\r\nAnabaptists having great horror of bloodshed, executed their condemned\r\nbrethren by tickling them to death.\r\n\r\nPowerfully depressing emotions, which are called by Kant \"asthenic,\"\r\nsuch as great and sudden sorrow, grief, or fright, have a pronounced\r\neffect on the vital functions, at times even causing death. Throughout\r\nliterature and history we have examples of this anomaly. In\r\nShakespeare's \"Pericles,\" Thaisa, the daughter to Simonides and wife of\r\nPericles, frightened when pregnant by a threatened shipwreck, dies in\r\npremature childbirth.\r\n\r\nIn Scott's \"Guy Mannering,\" Mrs. Bertram, on suddenly learning of the\r\ndeath of her little boy, is thrown into premature labor, followed by\r\ndeath. Various theories are advanced in explanation of this anomaly. A\r\nvery plausible one is, that the cardiac palsy is caused by energetic\r\nand persistent excitement of the inhibitory cardiac nerves. Strand is\r\naccredited with saying that agony of the mind produces rupture of the\r\nheart. It is quite common to hear the expression, \"Died of a broken\r\nheart;\" and, strange to say, in some cases postmortem examination has\r\nproved the actual truth of the saying. Bartholinus, Fabricius Hildanus,\r\nPliny, Rhodius, Schenck, Marcellus Donatus, Riedlin, and Garengeot\r\nspeak of death from fright and fear, and the Ephemerides describes a\r\ndeath the direct cause of which was intense shame. Deleau, a celebrated\r\ndoctor of Paris, while embracing his favorite daughter, who was in the\r\nlast throes of consumption, was so overcome by intense grief that he\r\nfell over her corpse and died, and both were buried together.\r\n\r\nThe fear of child-birth has been frequently cited as a cause of death\r\nMcClintock quotes a case from Travers of a young lady, happily married;\r\nwho entertained a fear of death in child-birth; although she had been\r\nsafely delivered, she suddenly and without apparent cause died in six\r\nhours. Every region of the body was examined with minutest care by an\r\neminent physician, but no signs indicative of the cause of death were\r\nfound. Mordret cites a similar instance of death from fear of labor.\r\nMorgagni mentions a woman who died from the disappointment of bearing a\r\ngirl baby when she was extremely desirous of a boy.\r\n\r\nThe following case, quoted from Lauder Brunton, shows the extent of\r\nshock which may be produced by fear: Many years ago a janitor of a\r\ncollege had rendered himself obnoxious to the students, and they\r\ndetermined to punish him. Accordingly they prepared a block and an axe,\r\nwhich they conveyed to a lonely place, and having appropriately dressed\r\nthemselves, some of them prepared to act as judges, and sent others of\r\ntheir company to bring him before them. He first affected to treat the\r\nwhole affair as a joke, but was solemnly assured by the students that\r\nthey meant it in real earnest. He was told to prepare for immediate\r\ndeath. The trembling janitor looked all around in the vain hope of\r\nseeing some indication that nothing was really meant, but stern looks\r\nmet him everywhere. He was blindfolded, and made to kneel before the\r\nblock. The executioner's axe was raised, but, instead of the sharp\r\nedge, a wet towel was brought sharply down on the back of the neck. The\r\nbandage was now removed from the culprit's eyes, but to the horror and\r\nastonishment of the students they found that he was dead. Such a case\r\nmay be due to heart-failure from fear or excitement.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon that death ensues from the shock alone following\r\nblows that cause no visible injury, but administered to vital parts.\r\nThis is particularly true of blows about the external genital region,\r\nor epigastrium, where the solar plexus is an active factor in\r\ninhibition. Ivanhoff of Bulgaria in 1886 speaks of a man of forty-five\r\nwho was dealt a blow on the testicle in a violent street fight, and\r\nstaggering, he fell insensible. Despite vigorous medical efforts he\r\nnever regained consciousness and died in forty-five minutes. Postmortem\r\nexamination revealed everything normal, and death must have been caused\r\nby syncope following violent pain. Watkins cites an instance occurring\r\nin South Africa. A native shearing sheep for a farmer provoked his\r\nmaster's ire by calling him by some nickname.  While the man was in a\r\nsquatting posture the farmer struck him in the epigastrium. He followed\r\nthis up by a kick in the side and a blow on the head, neither of which,\r\nhowever, was as severe as the first blow. The man fell unconscious and\r\ndied. At the autopsy there were no signs indicative of death, which\r\nmust have been due to the shock following the blow on the epigastrium.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the sensitiveness of the epigastric region, Vincent\r\nrelates the following case: \"A man received a blow by a stick upon the\r\nepigastrium. He had an anxious expression and suffered from oppression.\r\nIrregular heart-action and shivering were symptoms that gradually\r\ndisappeared during the day. In the evening his appetite returned and he\r\nfelt well; during the night he died without a struggle, and at the\r\nautopsy there was absolutely nothing abnormal to be found.\" Blows upon\r\nthe neck often produce sudden collapse. Prize-fighters are well aware\r\nof the effects of a blow on the jugular vein. Maschka, quoted by\r\nWarren, reports the case of a boy of twelve, who was struck on the\r\nanterior portion of the larynx by a stone. He fell lifeless to the\r\nground, and at autopsy no local lesion was found nor any lesion\r\nelsewhere. The sudden death may be attributed in this case partly to\r\nshock and partly to cerebral anemia.\r\n\r\nSoldiers have been seen to drop lifeless on the battle-field without\r\napparent injury or organic derangement; in the olden times this death\r\nwas attributed to fear and fright, and later was supposed to be caused\r\nby what is called \"the wind of a cannon-ball.\" Tolifree has written an\r\narticle on this cause of sudden death and others have discussed it. By\r\nsome it is maintained that the momentum acquired by a cannon-ball\r\ngenerates enough force in the neighboring air to prostrate a person in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of its path of flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL ANOMALIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK.\r\n\r\nInjuries of such a delicate organ as the eye, in which the slightest\r\naccident can produce such disastrous consequences, naturally elicit the\r\ninterest of all. Examples of exophthalmos, or protrusion of the eye\r\nfrom the orbit from bizarre causes, are of particular interest. Among\r\nthe older writers we find Ficker and the Ephemerides giving instances\r\nof exophthalmos from vomiting. Fabricius Hildanus mentions a similar\r\ninstance.  Salmuth, Verduc, and others mention extrusion of the eyeball\r\nfrom the socket, due to excessive coughing. Ab Heers and Sennert\r\nmention instances in which after replacement the sight was uninjured.\r\nTyler relates the case of a man who, after arising in the morning, blew\r\nhis nose violently, and to his horror his left eye extruded from the\r\norbit. With the assistance of his wife it was immediately replaced and\r\na bandage placed over it. When Tyler saw him the upper lid was slightly\r\nswollen and discolored, but there was no hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nHutchinson describes extrusion of the eyeball from the orbit caused by\r\na thrust with a stick. There was paraphymotic strangulation of the\r\nglobe, entirely preventing replacement and necessitating excision.\r\nReyssie speaks of a patient who, during a fire, was struck in the right\r\neye by a stream of water from a hose, violently thrusting the eye\r\nbackward. Contracting under the double influence of shock and cold, the\r\nsurrounding tissues forced the eyeball from the orbit, and an hour\r\nlater Reyssie saw the patient with the eye hanging by the optic nerve\r\nand muscles.  Its reduction was easy, and after some minor treatment\r\nvision was perfectly restored in the injured organ. Thirty months after\r\nthe accident the patient had perfect vision, and the eye had never in\r\nthe slightest way discommoded him.\r\n\r\nBodkin mentions the case of a woman of sixty who fell on the key in a\r\ndoor and completely avulsed her eye. In von Graefe's Archiv there is a\r\nrecord of a man of seventy-five who suffered complete avulsion of the\r\neye by a cart-wheel passing over his head.  Verhaeghe records complete\r\navulsion of the eye caused by a man falling against the ring of a\r\nsharp-worn key. Hamill describes the case of a young girl whose\r\nconjunctiva was pierced by one of the rests of an ordinary gas-bracket.\r\nBeing hooked at one of its extremities the iron became entangled in\r\neither the inferior oblique or external rectus muscles, and completely\r\navulsed the eyeball upon the cheek. The real damage could not be\r\nestimated, as the patient never returned after the muscle was clipped\r\noff close to its conjunctival insertion. Calhoun mentions an instance\r\nof a little Esquimaux dog whose head was seized between the jaws of a\r\nlarge Newfoundland with such force as to press the left eyeball from\r\nthe socket. The ball rested on the cheek, held by the taut optic nerve;\r\nthe cornea was opaque. The ball was carefully and gently replaced, and\r\nsight soon returned to the eye.\r\n\r\nIn former days there was an old-fashioned manner of fighting called\r\n\"gouging.\" In this brutal contest the combatant was successful who\r\ncould, with his thumb, press his opponent's eyeball out. Strange to\r\nsay, little serious or permanently bad results followed such inhuman\r\ntreatment of the eye. Von Langenbeck of Berlin mentions an instance of\r\nfracture of the superior maxilla, in which the eyeball was so much\r\ndisplaced as to lodge in the antrum of Highmore. Von Becker of\r\nHeidelberg reports the history of a case in which a blow from the horn\r\nof a cow dislocated the eye so far back in the orbit as to present the\r\nappearance of enucleation. The conjunctiva hid the organ from view, but\r\nwhen it was pulled aside the eyeball was exposed, and in its remote\r\nposition still possessed the power of vision. In some cases in which\r\nexophthalmos has been seemingly spontaneous, extreme laxity of the lids\r\nmay serve as an explanation. There is an instance on record in which a\r\nPolish dew appeared in a Continental hospital, saying that while\r\nturning in bed, without any apparent cause, his eyeball was completely\r\nextruded. There have been people who prided themselves on their ability\r\nto produce partial exophthalmos.\r\n\r\nRupture of the Eyeball.--Jessop mentions the case of a child of eight\r\nwho suffered a blow on the eye from a fall against a bedpost, followed\r\nby compound rupture of the organ. The wound in the sclerotic was three\r\nor four lines in length, and the rent in the conjunctiva was so large\r\nthat it required three sutures. The chief interest in this case was the\r\nrapid and complete recovery of vision.\r\n\r\nAdler reports a case of fracture of the superior maxillary in which the\r\ndislocated bone-fragment of the lower orbital border, through pressure\r\non the inferior maxillary and counter pressure on the skull, caused\r\nrupture of the conjunctiva of the left eye.\r\n\r\nSerious Sequelae of Orbital Injuries.--In some instances injuries\r\nprimarily to the orbit either by extension or implication of the\r\ncerebral contents provoke the most serious issues. Pointed instruments\r\nthrust into the orbital cavity may by this route reach the brain. There\r\nis a record of death caused by a wound of a cavernous sinus through the\r\norbit by the stem of a tobacco-pipe. Bower saw a woman at the\r\nGloucester Infirmary who had been stabbed in the eye by the end of an\r\numbrella. There was profuse hemorrhage from the nostrils and left eye,\r\nbut no signs indicative of its origin. Death shortly ensued, and at the\r\nnecropsy a fracture through the roof of the orbit was revealed, the\r\numbrella point having completely severed the optic nerve and divided\r\nthe ophthalmic artery. The internal carotid artery was wounded in\r\none-half of its circumference at its bend, just before it passes up\r\nbetween the anterior clinoid process and the optic nerve. The cavernous\r\nsinus was also opened. In this rare injury, although there was a\r\nconsiderable quantity of clotted blood at the base of the brain, there\r\nwas no wound to the eyeball nor to the brain itself.\r\n\r\nPepper records a case in which a knife was thrust through the\r\nspheroidal fissure, wounding a large meningeal vein, causing death from\r\nintracranial hemorrhage. Nelaton describes an instance in which the\r\npoint of an umbrella wounded the cavernous sinus and internal carotid\r\nartery of the opposite side, causing the formation of an arteriovenous\r\naneurysm which ultimately burst, and death ensued. Polaillon saw a boy\r\nof eighteen who was found in a state of coma. It was stated that an\r\numbrella stick had been thrust up through the roof of the orbit and had\r\nbeen withdrawn with much difficulty. The anterior lobe of the brain was\r\nevidently much wounded; an incision was made in the forehead and a\r\nportion of the frontal bone chiseled away entrance being thus effected,\r\nthe aura was incised, and some blood and cerebrospinal fluid escaped.\r\nFive splinters were removed and a portion of the damaged\r\nbrain-substance, and a small artery was tied with catgut.  The debris\r\nof the eyeball was enucleated and a drain was placed in the frontal\r\nwound, coming out through the orbit. The patient soon regained\r\nconsciousness and experienced no bad symptoms afterward. The drains\r\nwere gradually withdrawn, the process of healing advanced rapidly, and\r\nrecovery soon ensued.\r\n\r\nAnnandale mentions an instance in which a knitting-needle penetrated\r\nthe brain through the orbit. Hewett speaks of perforation of the roof\r\nof the orbit and injury to the brain by a lead-pencil.\r\n\r\nGunshot Injuries of the Orbit.--Barkan recites the case in which a\r\nleaden ball 32/100 inch in diameter was thrown from a sling into the\r\nleft orbital cavity, penetrating between the eyeball and osseous wall\r\nof the orbit without rupturing the tunics of the eye or breaking the\r\nbony wall of the cavity. It remained lodged two weeks without causing\r\nany pain or symptoms, and subsequently worked itself forward, contained\r\nin a perfect conjunctival sac, in which it was freely movable.\r\n\r\nBuchanan recites the case of a private in the army who was shot at a\r\ndistance of three feet away, the ball entering the inner canthus of the\r\nright eye and lodging under the skin of the opposite side. The eye was\r\nnot lost, and opacity of the lower part of the cornea alone resulted.\r\nCold water and purging constituted the treatment.\r\n\r\nIt is said a that an old soldier of one of Napoleon's armies had a\r\nmusket-ball removed from his left orbit after twenty-four years'\r\nlodgment. He was struck in the orbit by a musket-ball, but as at the\r\nsame time a companion fell dead at his side he inferred that the bullet\r\nrebounded from his orbit and killed his comrade.  For twenty-four years\r\nhe had suffered from cephalalgia and pains and partial exophthalmos of\r\nthe left eye. After removal of the ball the eye partially atrophied.\r\n\r\nWarren reports a case of a man of thirty-five whose eyeball was\r\ndestroyed by the explosion of a gun, the breech-pin flying off and\r\npenetrating the head. The orbit was crushed; fourteen months afterward\r\nthe man complained of soreness on the hard palate, and the whole\r\nbreech-pin, with screw attached, was extracted. The removal of the pin\r\nwas followed by fissure of the hard palate, which, however, was\r\nrelieved by operation. The following is an extract of a report by\r\nWenyon of Fatshan, South China:--\r\n\r\n\"Tang Shan, Chinese farmer, thirty-one years of age, was injured in the\r\nface by the bursting of a shot-gun. After being for upward of two\r\nmonths under the treatment of native practitioners, he came to me on\r\nDecember 4, 1891. I observed a cicatrix on the right side of his nose,\r\nand above this a sinus, still unhealed, the orifice of which involved\r\nthe inner canthus of the right eye, and extended downward and inward\r\nfor about a centimeter. The sight of the right eye was entirely lost,\r\nand the anterior surface of the globe was so uniformly red that the\r\ncornea could hardly be distinguished from the surrounding conjunctiva.\r\nThere was no perceptible enlargement or protrusion of the eyeball, and\r\nit did not appear to have sustained any mechanical injury or loss of\r\ntissue. The ophthalmia and keratitis were possibly caused by the\r\nirritating substances applied to the wound by the Chinese doctors. The\r\nsinus on the side of the nose gave exit to a continuous discharge of\r\nslightly putrid pus, and the patient complained of continuous headache\r\nand occasional dizziness, which interfered with his work. The pain was\r\nreferred to the right frontal and temporal regions, and the skin on\r\nthis part of the head had a slight blush, but there was no superficial\r\ntenderness.  The patient had been told by his native doctors, and he\r\nbelieved it himself, that there was no foreign body in the wound; but\r\non probing it I easily recognized the lower edge of a hard metallic\r\nsubstance at a depth of about one inch posteriorly from the orifice of\r\nthe sinus. Being unable to obtain any reliable information as to the\r\nprobable size or shape of the object, I cautiously made several\r\nattempts to remove it through a slightly enlarged opening, but without\r\nsuccess. I therefore continued the incision along the side of the nose\r\nto the nostril, thus laying open the right nasal cavity; then, seizing\r\nthe foreign body with a pair of strong forceps, I with difficulty\r\nremoved the complete breech-pin of a Chinese gun. Its size and shape\r\nare accurately represented by the accompanying drawing. The breech-pin\r\nmeasures a little over three inches in length, and weighs 21 ounces, or\r\n75.6 grams. It had evidently lain at the back of the orbit, inclined\r\nupward and slightly backward from its point of entrance, at an angle of\r\nabout 45 degrees. On its removal the headache was at once relieved and\r\ndid not return. In ten days the wound was perfectly healed and the\r\npatient went back to his work. A somewhat similar case, but which\r\nterminated fatally, is recorded in the American Journal of the Medical\r\nSciences of July, 1882.\"\r\n\r\nThe extent of permanent injury done by foreign bodies in the orbit is\r\nvariable. In some instances the most extensive wound is followed by the\r\nhappiest result, while in others vision is entirely destroyed by a\r\nminor injury.\r\n\r\nCarter reports a case in which a hat-peg 3 3/10 inches long and about\r\n1/4 inch in diameter (upon one end of which was a knob nearly 1/2 inch\r\nin diameter) was impacted in the orbit for from ten to twenty days, and\r\nduring this time the patient was not aware of the fact. Recovery\r\nfollowed its extraction, the vision and movements of the eye being\r\nunimpaired.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Philosophical Transactions a laborer thrust a long\r\nlath with great violence into the inner canthus of the left eye of his\r\nfellow workman, Edward Roberts. The lath broke off short, leaving a\r\npiece two inches long, 1/2 inch wide, and 1/4 inch thick, in situ.\r\nRoberts rode about a mile to the surgery of Mr. Justinian Morse, who\r\nextracted it with much difficulty; recovery followed, together with\r\nrestoration of the sight and muscular action. The lath was supposed to\r\nhave passed behind the eyeball. Collette speaks of an instance in which\r\n186 pieces of glass were extracted from the left orbit, the whole mass\r\nweighing 186 Belgian grains. They were blown in by a gust of wind that\r\nbroke a pane of glass; after extraction no affection of the brain or\r\neye occurred. Watson speaks of a case in which a chip of steel 3/8 inch\r\nlong was imbedded in cellular tissue of the orbit for four days, and\r\nwas removed without injury to the eye. Wordsworth reports a case in\r\nwhich a foreign body was deeply imbedded in the orbit for six weeks,\r\nand was removed with subsequent recovery.  Chisholm has seen a case in\r\nwhich for five weeks a fly was imbedded in the culdesac between the\r\nlower lid and the eyeball.\r\n\r\nForeign bodies are sometimes contained in the eyeball for many years.\r\nThere is an instance on record in which a wooden splinter, five mm.\r\nlong and two mm. broad, remained in the eye forty-seven years. It was\r\nextracted, with the lens in which it was lodged, to relieve pain and\r\nother distressing symptoms. Snell reports a case in which a piece of\r\nsteel was imbedded and encapsulated in the ciliary process twenty-nine\r\nyears without producing sympathetic irritation of its fellow, but\r\ncausing such pain as to warrant enucleation of this eye. Gunning speaks\r\nof a piece of thorn 5/8 inch long, imbedded in the left eyeball of an\r\nold man for six years, causing total loss of vision; he adds that,\r\nafter its removal, some improvement was noticed.\r\n\r\nWilliams mentions a stone-cutter whose left eye was put out by a piece\r\nof stone. Shortly after this his right eye was wounded by a knife,\r\ncausing traumatic cataract, which was extracted by Sir William Wilde,\r\ngiving the man good sight for twelve years, after which iritis attacked\r\nthe right eye and produced a false membrane over the pupil so that the\r\nman could not work. It was in this condition that he consulted\r\nWilliams, fourteen years after the loss of the left eye. The eye was\r\natrophied, and on examination a piece of stone was seen projecting from\r\nit directly between the lids. The visible portion was 1/4 inch long,\r\nand the end in the shrunken eye was evidently longer than the end\r\nprotruding. The sclera was incised, and, after fourteen years' duration\r\nin the eye, the stone was removed.\r\n\r\nTaylor reports the removal of a piece of bone which had remained\r\nquiescent in the eye for fourteen years; after the removal of the eye\r\nthe bone was found adherent to the inner tunics. It resembled the lens\r\nin size and shape. Williams mentions continual tolerance of foreign\r\nbodies in the eyeball for fifteen and twenty-two years; and Chisholm\r\nreports the lodgment of a fragment of metal in the iris for\r\ntwenty-three years. Liebreich extracted a piece of steel from the\r\ninterior of the eye where it had been lodged twenty-two years. Barkar\r\nspeaks of a piece of steel which penetrated through the cornea and\r\nlens, and which, five months later, was successfully removed by the\r\nextraction of the cataractous lens. Critchett gives an instance of a\r\nforeign body being loose in the anterior chamber for sixteen years.\r\nRider speaks of the lodgment of a fragment of a copper percussion cap\r\nin the left eye, back of the inner ciliary margin of the iris, for\r\nthirty-five years; and Bartholinus mentions a thorn in the canthus for\r\nthirty years. Jacob reports a case in which a chip of iron remained in\r\nthe eyeball twenty-eight years without giving indications for removal.\r\nIt was clearly visible, protruding into the anterior surface of the\r\niris, and although it was rusted by its long lodgment, sight in the eye\r\nwas fairly good, and there was no sign of irritation.\r\n\r\nSnell gives an instance in which a piece of steel was imbedded close to\r\nthe optic disc with retention of sight. It was plainly visible by the\r\nopthalmoscope eighteen months after the accident, when as yet no\r\ndiminution of sight was apparent. Smyly speaks of a portion of a\r\ntobacco pipe which was successfully removed from the anterior chamber\r\nby an incision through the cornea. Clark mentions a case in which\r\nmolten lead in the eye caused no permanent injury; and there are\r\nseveral cases mentioned in confirmation of the statement that the eye\r\nseems to be remarkably free from disastrous effects after this injury.\r\n\r\nWilliamson mentions eyelashes in the anterior chamber of the eye, the\r\nresult of a stab wound of this organ.\r\n\r\nContusion of the eyeball may cause dislocation of the lens into the\r\nanterior chamber, and several instances have been recorded.  We regret\r\nour inability to give the reference or authority for a report that we\r\nhave seen, stating that by one kick of a horse the lenses of both eyes\r\nof a man were synchronously knocked through the eyeballs by the calkins\r\nof the horseshoe. Oliver mentions extraction of a lens by a thrust of a\r\ncow's horn.\r\n\r\nLowe speaks of rupture of the anterior capsule of the lens from violent\r\nsneezing, with subsequent absorption of the lenticular substance and\r\nrestoration of vision. Trioen mentions a curious case of expulsion of\r\nthe crystalline lens from the eye in ophthalmia, through the formation\r\nof a corneal fissure. The authors have personal knowledge of a case of\r\nspontaneous extrusion of the lens through a corneal ulcer, in a case of\r\nophthalmia of the new-born.\r\n\r\nInjury of the Eyeball by Birds.--There are several instances in which\r\nbirds have pierced the eyeball with their bills, completely destroying\r\nvision. Not long since a prominent taxidermist winged a crane, picked\r\nit up, and started to examine it, when it made one thrust with its bill\r\nand totally destroyed his eyeball. In another instance a man was going\r\nfrom the railroad station to his hotel in a gale of wind, when, as he\r\nturned the corner of the street, an English sparrow was blown into his\r\nface. Its bill penetrated his eyeball and completely ruined his sight.\r\nThere are several instances on record in which game fowls have\r\ndestroyed the eyes of their owners. In one case a game cock almost\r\ncompleted the enucleation of the eye of his handler by striking him\r\nwith his gaff while preparing in a cock-pit.\r\n\r\nMoorehead explains a rare accident to an eye as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. S. B. A., while attending to his bees, was stung by one upon the\r\nright upper eyelid near its center. An employee, who was assisting in\r\nthe work, immediately discovered the sting driven in the lid and\r\ncautiously extracted it, stating that he made sufficient traction to\r\nlift the lid well away from the globe. In a few hours the lid became\r\nmuch swollen, but the pain experienced at first had disappeared. Before\r\nretiring for the night he began gentle massage of the lid, stroking it\r\nhorizontally with his finger. The edematous condition was by this means\r\nmuch reduced in a short time. While thus engaged in stroking the lid he\r\nsuddenly experienced intense pain in the eye as if it had been pierced\r\nby a sharp instrument. The suffering was very severe, and he passed a\r\nwretched night, constantly feeling 'something in his eye.'\r\n\r\n\"The next morning, the trouble continuing, he came to me for relief.\r\nUpon examination of the lid, no opening could be made out where the\r\nsting had penetrated, and a minute inspection of the conjunctival\r\nsurface with a good glass failed to reveal any foreign substance.\r\nCleansing the lid thoroughly, and carefully inspecting with a lens\r\nunder strong light, a minute dark point was made out about the center\r\nof the lid. Feeling that this might be the point of the sting, I had\r\nrecourse to several expedients for its removal, but without success.\r\nFinally, with a fine knife, I succeeded in cutting down by the side of\r\nthe body and tilting it out. Examination with a 1/5 inch objective\r\nconfirmed my opinion that it was the point of the bee-sting.\r\n\r\n\"The barbed formation of the point explains how, under the stroking\r\nwith the finger, it was forced through the dense tarsal cartilage and\r\nagainst the cornea of the eye.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a story told in La Medecine Moderne of a seamstress of Berlin\r\nwho was in the habit of allowing her dog to lick her face.  She was\r\nattacked with a severe inflammation of the right eye, which had to be\r\nenucleated, and was found full of tenia echinococcus, evidently derived\r\nfrom the dog's tongue.\r\n\r\nGabb mentions a case of epistaxis in which the blood welled up through\r\nthe lacrimal ducts and suffused into the eye so that it was constantly\r\nnecessary to wipe the lower eyelid, and the discharge ceased only when\r\nthe nose stopped bleeding. A brief editorial note on epistaxis through\r\nthe eyes, referring to a case in the Medical News of November 30, 1895,\r\nprovoked further reports from numerous correspondents. Among others,\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\"Dr. T. L. Wilson of Bellwood, Pa., relates the case of an old lady of\r\nseventy-eight whom he found with the blood gushing from the nostrils.\r\nAfter plugging the nares thoroughly with absorbent cotton dusted with\r\ntannic acid he was surprised to see the blood ooze out around the\r\neyelids and trickle down the cheeks. This oozing continued for the\r\ngreater part of an hour, being controlled by applications of ice to\r\nboth sides of the nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. F. L. Donlon of New York City reports the case of a married woman,\r\nabout fifty years old, in whom epistaxis set in suddenly at 11 P.M.,\r\nand had continued for several hours, when the anterior nares were\r\nplugged. In a short time the woman complained that she could scarcely\r\nsee, owing to the welling up of blood in the eyes and trickling down\r\nher face. The bleeding only ceased when the posterior nares also were\r\nplugged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. T. G. Wright of Plainville, Conn., narrates the case of a young\r\nman whom he found in the night, bleeding profusely, and having already\r\nlost a large amount of blood. Shortly after plugging both anterior and\r\nposterior nares the blood found its way through the lacrimal ducts to\r\nthe eyes and trickled down the cheeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Charles W. Crumb cites the case of a man, sixty-five years old,\r\nwith chronic nephritis, in whom a slight bruise of the nose was\r\nfollowed by epistaxis lasting twenty-four hours. When the nares were\r\nplugged blood escaped freely from the eyes. A cone-shaped bit of\r\nsponge, saturated with ferrous sulphate, was passed into each anterior\r\nnaris, and another piece of sponge, similarly medicated, into either\r\nposterior naris. The patient had been taking various preparations of\r\npotassium, and it was thought that his blood contained a deficiency of\r\nfibrin. Upon removal of the nasal plugs a catarrhal inflammation\r\ndeveloped which lasted a long time and was attended with considerable\r\npurulent discharge.\"\r\n\r\nLate Restoration of Sight.--There are some marvelous cases on record in\r\nwhich, after many years of blindness, the surgeon has been able, by\r\noperation, to restore the sight. McKeown gives the history of a blind\r\nfiddler of sixty-three, who, when one and a half years old, had lost\r\nthe sight of both eyes after an attack of small-pox. Iridectomy was\r\nperformed, and after over sixty years of total blindness his sight was\r\nrestored; color-perception was good. Berncastle mentions a case of\r\nextraction of double cataract and double iridectomy for occluded\r\npupils, which, after thirty years of blindness, resulted in the\r\nrecovery of good sight. The patient was a blind beggar of Sydney.\r\n\r\nTo those interested in this subject, Jauffret has a most interesting\r\ndescription of a man by the name of Garin, who was born blind, who\r\ntalked at eight or nine months, showed great intelligence, and who was\r\neducated at a blind asylum. At the age of twenty-four he entered the\r\nhospital of Forlenze, to be operated upon by that famous oculist. Garin\r\nhad never seen, but could distinguish night or darkness by one eye\r\nonly, and recognized orange and red when placed close to that eye. He\r\ncould tell at once the sex and age of a person approximately by the\r\nvoice and tread, and formed his conclusions more rapidly in regard to\r\nfemales than males. Forlenze diagnosed cataract, and, in the presence\r\nof a distinguished gathering, operated with the happiest result. The\r\ndescription that follows, which is quoted by Fournier and is readily\r\naccessible to any one, is well worth reading, as it contains an account\r\nof the first sensations of light, objects, distance, etc., and minor\r\nanalogous thoughts, of an educated and matured mind experiencing its\r\nfirst sensations of sight.\r\n\r\nHansell and Clark say that the perplexities of learning to see after\r\ntwenty-six years of blindness from congenital disease, as described by\r\na patient of Franke, remind one of the experience of Shelley's\r\nFrankenstein. Franke's patient was successfully operated on for\r\ncongenital double cataract, at twenty-six years of age. The author\r\ndescribes the difficulties the patient had of recognizing by means of\r\nvision the objects he had hitherto known through his other senses, and\r\nhis slowness in learning to estimate distances and the comparative size\r\nof objects.\r\n\r\nSight is popularly supposed to be occasionally restored without the aid\r\nof art, after long years of blindness. Benjamin Rush saw a man of\r\nforty-five who, twelve years before, became blind without ascertainable\r\ncause, and recovered his sight equally without reason. St. Clair\r\nmentions Marshal Vivian, who at the age of one hundred regained sight\r\nthat for nearly forty years had gradually been failing almost to\r\nblindness, and preserved this new sight to the time of his death.\r\n\r\nThere are many superstitions prevalent among uneducated people as to\r\n\"second sight,\" recovery of vision, etc., which render their reports of\r\nsuch things untrustworthy. The real explanations of such cases are too\r\nvaried for discussion here.\r\n\r\nNyctalopia etymologically means night blindness, but the general usage,\r\nmaking the term mean night-vision, is so strongly intrenched that it is\r\nuseless and confusing to attempt any reinstatement of the old\r\nsignificance. The condition in which one sees better by night,\r\nrelatively speaking, than by day is due to some lesion of the macular\r\nregion, rendering it blind. At night the pupil dilates more than in the\r\nday-time, and hence vision with the extramacular or peripheral portions\r\nof the retina is correspondingly better. It is, therefore, a symptom of\r\nserious retinal disease. All night-prowling animals have widely\r\ndilatable pupils, and in addition to this they have in the retina a\r\nspecial organ called the tapetum lucidum, the function of which is to\r\nreflect to a focus in front of them the relatively few rays of light\r\nthat enter the widely-dilated pupil and thus enable them the better to\r\nsee their way. Hence the luminous appearance of the eyes of such\r\nanimals in the dark.\r\n\r\nHemeralopia (etymologically day-blindness, but by common usage meaning\r\nday-vision or night-blindness) is a symptom of a peculiar degenerative\r\ndisease of the retina, called retinitis pigmentosa.  It also occurs in\r\nsome cases of extreme denutrition, numerous cases having been reported\r\namong those who make the prolonged fasts customary in the Russian\r\nchurch. In retinitis pigmentosa the peripheral or extramacular portions\r\nof the retina are subject to a pigmentary degeneration that renders\r\nthem insensitive to light, and patients so afflicted are consequently\r\nincapable of seeing at night as well as others. They stumble and run\r\nagainst objects easily seen by the normal eye.\r\n\r\nSnow-blindness occurs from prolonged exposure of the eyes to snow upon\r\nwhich the sun is shining. Some years ago, some seventy laborers, who\r\nwere clearing away snow-drifts in the Caucasus, were seized, and thirty\r\nof them could not find their way home, so great was the photophobia,\r\nconjunctivitis, and lacrimation.  Graddy reports six cases, and many\r\nothers are constantly occurring.\r\n\r\nOther forms of retinal injury from too great or too prolonged exposure\r\nto light are \"moon-blindness,\" due to sleeping with the eyes exposed to\r\nbright moonlight, and that due to lightning--a case, e.g., being\r\nreported by Knies. Silex also reports such a case and reviews the\r\nreported cases, 25 in number, in ten of which cataract ensued. In the\r\nAnnual of the Universal Medical Sciences, 1888, there is a report of\r\nseven cases of retinal injury with central scotoma, amblyopia, etc., in\r\nJapanese medical students, caused by observation of the sun in eclipse.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the question of electric-light injuries of the eyes Gould\r\nreviews the literature of the subject and epitomizes the cases reported\r\nup to that time. They numbered 23. No patient was seriously or\r\npermanently injured, and none was in a person who used the electric\r\nlight in a proper manner as an illuminant. All were in scientific\r\ninvestigators or workmen about the light, who approached it too closely\r\nor gazed at it too long and without the colored protecting spectacles\r\nnow found necessary by such workers.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the Ear.--The folly of the practice of boxing children's\r\nears, and the possible disastrous results subsequent to this\r\npunishment, are well exemplified throughout medical literature. Stewart\r\nquotes four cases of rupture of the tympanum from boxing the ears, and\r\nthere is an instance of a boy of eight, who was boxed on the ear at\r\nschool, in whom subsequent brain-disease developed early, and death\r\nfollowed. Roosa of New York mentions the loss of hearing following a\r\nkiss on the ear.\r\n\r\nDalby, in a paper citing many different causes of rupture of the\r\ntympanic membrane, mentions the following: A blow in sparring; violent\r\nsneezing; blowing the nose; forcible dilatation of the Eustachian\r\ncanal; a thorn or twig of a tree accidentally thrust into the head;\r\npicking the ear with a toothpick. In time of battle soldiers sometimes\r\nhave their tympanums ruptured by the concussion caused by the firing of\r\ncannon. Dalby mentions an instance of an officer who was discharged for\r\ndeafness acquired in this manner during the Crimean War. He was\r\nstanding beside a mortar which, unexpectedly to him, was fired, causing\r\nrupture of the tympanic membrane, followed by hemorrhage from the ear.\r\nSimilar cases were reported in the recent naval engagements between the\r\nChinese and Japanese. Wilson reports two cases of rupture of the\r\nmembrane tympani caused by diving. Roosa divides the causes into\r\ntraumatic, hemorrhagic, and inflammatory, and primary lesions of the\r\nlabyrinth, exemplifying each by numerous instances. Under traumatic\r\ncauses he mentions severe falls, blows about the head or face, constant\r\nlistening to a telegraphic instrument, cannonading, and finally eight\r\ncases of boiler-makers' deafness. Roosa cites a curious case of sudden\r\nand profound deafness in a young man in perfect health, while calling\r\nupon the parents of his lady-love to ask her hand in marriage.  Strange\r\nto say that after he had had a favorable reply he gradually recovered\r\nhis hearing! In the same paper there is an instance of a case of\r\ndeafness due to the sudden cessation of perspiration, and an instance\r\nof tinnitus due to the excessive use of tobacco; Roosa also mentions a\r\ncase of deafness due to excessive mental employment.\r\n\r\nPerforation of the Tympanum.--Kealy relates an instance in which a pin\r\nwas introduced into the left ear to relieve an intolerable itching. It\r\nperforated the tympanum, and before the expiration of twenty-four hours\r\nwas coughed up from the throat with a small quantity of blood. The pin\r\nwas bent at an angle of about 120 degrees. Another similar case was\r\nthat of a girl of twenty-two who, while pricking her ear with a\r\nhair-pin, was jerked or struck on the arm by a child, and the pin\r\nforced into the ear; great pain and deafness followed, together with\r\nthe loss of taste on the same side of the tongue; after treatment both\r\nof the disturbed senses were restored. A man of twenty was pricked in\r\nthe ear by a needle entering the meatus. He uttered a cry, fell\r\nsenseless, and so continued until the fourth day when he died.  The\r\nwhole auditory meatus was destroyed by suppuration. Gamgee tells of a\r\nconstable who was stabbed in the left ear, severing the middle\r\nmeningeal artery, death ensuing. In this instance, after digital\r\ncompression, ligature of the common carotid was practiced as a last\r\nresort. There is an account of a provision-dealer's agent who fell\r\nasleep at a public house at Tottenham. In sport an attendant tickled\r\nhis ear with a wooden article used as a pipe light. A quick,\r\nunconscious movement forced the wooden point through the tympanum,\r\ncausing cerebral inflammation and subsequent death. There is a record\r\nof death, in a child of nine, caused by the passage of a\r\nknitting-needle into the auditory meatus.\r\n\r\nKauffmann reports a case of what he calls objective tinnitus aurium, in\r\nwhich the noise originating in the patient's ears was distinctly\r\naudible by others. The patient was a boy of fourteen, who had fallen on\r\nthe back of his head and had remained unconscious for nearly two weeks.\r\nThe noises were bilateral, but more distinct on the left than on the\r\nright side. The sounds were described as crackling, and seemed to\r\ndepend on movements of the arch of the palate. Kauffmann expresses the\r\nopinion that the noises were due to clonic spasm of the tensor velum\r\npalati, and states that under appropriate treatment the tinnitus\r\ngradually subsided.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of foreign bodies in the ear is usually accidental,\r\nalthough in children we often find it as a result of sport or\r\ncuriosity. There is an instance on record of a man who was accustomed\r\nto catch flies and put them in his ear, deriving from them a\r\npleasurable sensation from the tickling which ensued.  There have been\r\ncases in which children, and even adults, have held grasshoppers,\r\ncrickets, or lady-birds to their ears in order to more attentively\r\nlisten to the noise, and while in this position the insects have\r\nescaped and penetrated the auditory canal. Insects often enter the ears\r\nof persons reposing in the fields with the ear to the ground. Fabricius\r\nHildanus speaks of a cricket penetrating the ear during sleep. Calhoun\r\nmentions an instance of disease of the ear which he found was due to\r\nthe presence of several living maggots in the interior of the ear.  The\r\npatient had been sleeping in a horse stall in which were found maggots\r\nsimilar to those extracted from his ear. An analogous instance was seen\r\nin a negro in the Emergency Hospital, Washington, D.C., in the summer\r\nof 1894; and many others are recorded. The insects are frequently\r\nremoved only after a prolonged lodgment.\r\n\r\nD'Aguanno gives an account of two instances of living larvae of the\r\nmusca sarcophaga in the ears of children. In one of the cases the\r\nlarvae entered the drum-cavity through a rupture in the tympanic\r\nmembrane. In both cases the maggots were removed by forceps. Haug has\r\nobserved a tic (ixodes ricinus) in the ear of a lad of seventeen. The\r\ncreature was killed by a mercuric-chlorid solution, and removed with a\r\nprobe.\r\n\r\nThere is a common superstition that centipedes have the faculty of\r\nentering the ear and penetrating the brain, causing death. The authors\r\nhave knowledge of an instance in which three small centipedes were\r\ntaken from the ear of a policeman after remaining there three days;\r\nduring this time they caused excruciating pain, but there was no\r\npermanent injury. The Ephemerides contains instances in which, while\r\nyet living, worms, crickets, ants, and beetles have all been taken from\r\nthe ear. In one case the entrance of a cricket in the auditory canal\r\nwas the cause of death. Martin gives an instance in which larvae were\r\ndeposited in the ear. Stalpart van der Wiel relates an instance of the\r\nlodgment of a living spider in the ear.\r\n\r\nFar more common than insects are inanimate objects as foreign bodies in\r\nthe ear, and numerous examples are to be found in literature. Fabricius\r\nHildanus tells of a glass ball introduced into the auditory canal of a\r\ngirl of ten, followed by headache, numbness on the left side, and after\r\nfour or five years epileptic seizures, and atrophy of the arm. He\r\nextracted it and the symptoms immediately ceased. Sabatier speaks of an\r\nabscess of the brain caused by a ball of paper in the ear; and it is\r\nquite common for persons in the habit of using a tampon of cotton in\r\nthe meatus to mistake the deep entrance of this substance for\r\nfunctional derangement, and many cases of temporary deafness are simply\r\ndue to forgetfulness of the cause. A strange case is reported in a girl\r\nof fourteen, who lost her tympanum from a profuse otorrhea, and who\r\nsubstituted an artificial tympanum which was, in its turn, lost by deep\r\npenetration, causing augmentation of the symptoms, of the cause of\r\nwhich the patient herself seemed unaware. Sometimes artificial otoliths\r\nare produced by the insufflation of various powders which become\r\nagglutinated, and are veritable foreign bodies. Holman tells of a\r\nnegro, aged thirty-five, whose wife poured molten pewter in his ear\r\nwhile asleep. It was removed, but total deafness was the result.\r\n\r\nAlley mentions a New Orleans wharf laborer, in whose ear was poured\r\nsome molten lead; seventeen months afterward the lead was still\r\noccupying the external auditory meatus. It is quite remarkable that the\r\nlead should have remained such a length of time without causing\r\nmeningeal inflammation. There was deafness and palsy of that side of\r\nthe face. A fungous growth occupied the external portion of the ear;\r\nthe man suffered pain and discharge from the ear, and had also great\r\ndifficulty in closing his right eyelid. Morrison mentions an alcoholic\r\npatient of forty who, on June 6, 1833, had nitric acid poured in her\r\nright ear. There were no headache, febrile symptoms, stupor, or\r\nvertigo. Debility alone was present. Two weeks after the injury\r\nparalysis began on the right side, and six weeks from the injury the\r\npatient died. This case is interesting from the novel mode of death,\r\nthe perfect paralysis of the arm, paralysis agitans of the body\r\n(occurring as hemorrhage from the ear came on, and subsiding with it),\r\nand extensive caries of the petrous bone, without sensation of pain or\r\nany indicative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere is an instance in a young girl in which a piece of pencil\r\nremained in the right ear for seven years. Haug speaks of two beads\r\nlying in the auditory canal for twenty-eight years without causing any\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nA boy of six introduced a carob-nut kernel into each ear. On the next\r\nday incompetent persons attempted to extract the kernel from the left\r\nside, but only caused pain and hemorrhage. The nut issued spontaneously\r\nfrom the right side. In the afternoon the auditory canal was found\r\nexcoriated and red, and deep in the meatus the kernel was found,\r\ncovered with blood. The patient had been so excited and pained by the\r\nbungling attempts at extraction that the employment of instruments was\r\nimpossible; prolonged employment of injections was substituted.\r\nDischarge from the ear commenced, intense fever and delirium ensued,\r\nand the patient had to be chloroformed to facilitate the operation of\r\nextraction. The nut, when taken out, was found to have a consistency\r\nmuch larger than originally, caused by the agglutination of wax and\r\nblood.  Unfortunately the symptoms of meningitis increased; three days\r\nafter the operation coma followed, and on the next day death ensued. In\r\n75 cases collected by Mayer, and cited by Poulet (whose work on\r\n\"Foreign Bodies\" is the most extensive in existence), death as a\r\nconsequence of meningitis was found in three.\r\n\r\nFleury de Clermont mentions a woman of twenty-five who consulted him\r\nfor removal of a pin which was in her right ear. Vain attempts by some\r\nof her lay-friends to extract the pin had only made matters worse. The\r\npin was directed transversely, and its middle part touched the membrane\r\ntympanum. The mere touching of the pin caused the woman intense pain;\r\neven after etherization it was necessary to construct a special\r\ninstrument to extract it.  She suffered intense cephalalgia and other\r\nsigns of meningitis; despite vigorous treatment she lost consciousness\r\nand died shortly after the operation.\r\n\r\nWinterbotham reports an instance in which a cherry-stone was removed\r\nfrom the meatus auditorius after lodgment of upward of sixty years.\r\nMarchal de Calvi mentions intermittent deafness for forty years, caused\r\nby the lodgment of a small foreign body in the auditory canal. There is\r\nan instance in which a carious molar tooth has been tolerated in the\r\nsame location for forty years.\r\n\r\nAlbucasius, Fabricius Hildanus, Pare, and others, have mentioned the\r\nfact that seeds and beans have been frequently seen to increase in\r\nvolume while lodged in the auditory canal. Tulpius speaks of an infant,\r\nplaying with his comrades, who put a cherry-seed in his ear which he\r\nwas not able to extract. The seed increased in volume to such an extent\r\nthat it was only by surgical interference that it could be extracted,\r\nand then such serious consequences followed that death resulted. Albers\r\nreports an instance in which a pin introduced into the ear issued from\r\nthe pharynx.\r\n\r\nConfusion of diagnosis is occasionally noticed in terrified or hysteric\r\npersons. Lowenberg was called to see a child of five who had introduced\r\na button into his left ear. When he saw the child it complained of all\r\nthe pain in the right ear, and he naturally examined this ear first but\r\nfound nothing to indicate the presence of a foreign body. He examined\r\nthe ear supposed to be healthy and there found the button lying against\r\nthe tympanum.  This was explained by the fact that the child was so\r\npained and terrified by the previous explorations of the affected ear\r\nthat rather than undergo them again he presented the well ear for\r\nexamination. In the British Medical Journal for 1877 is an account of\r\nan unjustified exploration of an ear for a foreign body by an\r\nincompetent physician, who spent a half hour in exploration and\r\nmanipulation, and whose efforts resulted in the extraction of several\r\npieces of bone. The child died in one and a half hours afterward from\r\nextreme hemorrhage, and the medical bungler was compelled to appear\r\nbefore a coroner's jury in explanation of his ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn the external ear of a child Tansley observed a diamond which he\r\nremoved under chloroform. The mother of the child had pushed the body\r\nfurther inward in her endeavors to remove it and had wounded the canal.\r\nSchmiegelow reports a foreign body forced into the drum-cavity,\r\nfollowed by rough extraction, great irritation, tetanus, and death; and\r\nthere are on record several cases of fatal meningitis, induced by rough\r\nendeavors to extract a body from the external ear.\r\n\r\nIn the Therapeutic Gazette, August 15, 1896, there is a translation of\r\nthe report of a case by Voss, in which a child of five pushed a dry pea\r\nin his ear. Four doctors spent several days endeavoring to extract it,\r\nbut only succeeded in pushing it in further. It was removed by\r\noperation on the fifth day, but suppuration of the tympanic cavity\r\ncaused death on the ninth day.\r\n\r\nBarclay reports a rare case of ensnared aural foreign body in a lady,\r\naged about forty years, who, while \"picking\" her left ear with a\r\nso-called \"invisible hair-pin\" several hours before the consultation,\r\nhad heard a sudden \"twang\" in the ear, as if the hair-pin had broken.\r\nAnd so, indeed, it had; for on the instant she had attempted to jerk it\r\nquickly from the ear the sharp extremity of the inner portion of its\r\nlower prong sprang away from its fellow, penetrated the soft tissues of\r\nthe floor of the external auditory canal, and remained imbedded there,\r\nthe separated end of this prong only coming away in her grasp. Every\r\nattempt on her part to remove the hair-pin by traction on its\r\nprojecting prong--she durst not force it INWARD for fear of wounding\r\nthe drumhead--had served but to bury the point of the broken prong more\r\ndeeply into the flesh of the canal, thereby increasing her suffering.\r\nAdvised by her family physician not to delay, she forthwith sought\r\nadvice and aid. On examination, it was found that the lower prong of\r\nthe \"invisible hair-pin\" had broken at the outer end of its wavy\r\nportion, and seemed firmly imbedded in the floor of the auditory canal,\r\nnow quite inflamed, at a point about one-third of its depth from the\r\noutlet of the canal. The loop or turn of the hair-pin was about 1/2\r\ninch from the flaccid portion of the drumhead, and, together with the\r\nunbroken prong, it lay closely against the roof of the canal.\r\nProjecting from the meatus there was enough of this prong to be easily\r\ngrasped between one's thumb and finger. Removal of the hair-pin was\r\neffected by first inserting within the meatus a Gruber speculum,\r\nencircling the unbroken projecting prong, and then raising the end of\r\nthe broken one with a long-shanked aural hook, when the hair-pin was\r\nreadily withdrawn. The wound of the canal-floor promptly healed.\r\n\r\nIn the severest forms of scalp-injuries, such as avulsion of the scalp\r\nfrom the entangling of the hair in machinery, skin-grafting or\r\nreplantation is of particular value. Ashhurst reports a case which he\r\nconsiders the severest case of scalp-wound that he had ever seen,\r\nfollowed by recovery. The patient was a girl of fifteen, an operative\r\nin a cotton-mill, who was caught by her hair between two rollers which\r\nwere revolving in opposite directions; her scalp being thus, as it\r\nwere, squeezed off from her head, forming a large horseshoe flap. The\r\nlinear extent of the wound was 14 inches, the distance between the two\r\nextremities being but four inches. This large flap was thrown backward,\r\nlike the lid of a box, the skull being denuded of its pericranium for\r\nthe space of 2 1/2 by one inch in extent. The anterior temporal artery\r\nwas divided and bled profusely, and when admitted to the hospital the\r\npatient was extremely depressed by shock and hemorrhage. A ligature was\r\napplied to the bleeding vessel, and after it had been gently but\r\ncarefully cleansed the flap was replaced and held in place with gauze\r\nand collodion dressing. A large compress soaked in warm olive oil was\r\nthen placed over the scalp, covered with oiled silk and with a\r\nrecurrent bandage. A considerable portion of the wound healed by\r\nadhesions, and the patient was discharged, cured, in fifty-four days.\r\nNo exfoliation of bone occurred. Reverdin, a relative of the discoverer\r\nof transplantation of skin, reported the case of a girl of twenty-one\r\nwhose entire scalp was detached by her hair being caught in machinery,\r\nleaving a wound measuring 35 cm. from the root of the nose to the nape\r\nof the neck, 28 cm. from one ear to the other, and 57 cm. in\r\ncircumference. Grafts from the rabbit and dog failed, and the skin from\r\nthe amputated stump of a boy was employed, and the patient was able to\r\nleave the hospital in seven months. Cowley speaks of a girl of fourteen\r\nwhose hair was caught in the revolving shaft of a steam-engine, which\r\nresulted in the tearing off of her whole scalp. A triangular portion of\r\nthe skin was hanging over her face, the apex of the triangle containing\r\nshort hair, from which the long hair had been detached. Both ears were\r\nhanging down the neck, having been detached above. The right pinna was\r\nentire, and the upper half of the left pinna had disappeared. The whole\r\nof the head and back of the neck was denuded of skin. One of the\r\ntemporal arteries was ligated, and the scalp cleansed and reapplied.\r\nThe hanging ears and the skin of the forehead were successfully\r\nrestored to their proper position. The patient had no bad symptoms and\r\nlittle pain, and the shock was slight. Where the periosteum had\r\nsloughed the bone was granulating, and at the time of the report\r\nskin-grafting was shortly to be tried.\r\n\r\nSchaeffer has presented quite an extensive article on scalp-injuries in\r\nwhich grafting and transplantation has been used, and besides reporting\r\nhis own he mentions several other cases. One was that of a young lady\r\nof twenty-four. While at work under a revolving shaft in a laundry the\r\nwind blew her hair and it was caught in the shaft. The entire skull was\r\nlaid bare from the margin of the eyelids to the neck. The nasal bones\r\nwere uncovered and broken, exposing the superior nasal meatus. The skin\r\nof the eyelids was removed from within three mm. of their edges. The\r\nlower margin of the wound was traceable from the lower portion of the\r\nleft external process of the frontal bone, downward and backward below\r\nthe left ear (which was entirely removed), thence across the neck, five\r\ncm. below the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and forward\r\nthrough the lower one-third of the right auricle to the right external\r\nangular process of the frontal bone and margin of the right upper\r\neyelid, across the lid, nose, and left eyelid, to the point of\r\ncommencement. Every vessel and nerve supplying the scalp was destroyed,\r\nand the pericranium was torn off in three places, one of the denuded\r\nspots measuring five by seven cm. and another five by six cm. The neck\r\nflap of the wound fell away from the muscular structures beneath it,\r\nexposing the trapezius muscle almost one-half the distance to the\r\nshoulder blade. The right ear was torn across in its lower third, and\r\nhung by the side of the neck by a piece of skin less than five mm.\r\nwide. The exposed surface of the wound measured 40 cm. from before\r\nback, and 34 cm. in width near the temporal portion. The cranial\r\nsutures were distinctly seen in several places, and only a few muscular\r\nfibers of the temporal were left on each side. Hemorrhage was profuse\r\nfrom the temporal, occipital, and posterior auricular arteries, which\r\nwere tied. The patient was seen three-quarters of an hour after the\r\ninjury, and the mangled scalp was thoroughly washed in warm carbolized\r\nwater, and stitched back in position, after the hair was cut from the\r\nouter surface. Six weeks after the injury suppuration was still free,\r\nand skin-grafting was commenced. In all, 4800 grafts were used, the\r\npatient supplying at different times 1800 small grafts. Her own skin\r\ninvariably did better than foreign grafts. In ten months she had almost\r\ncompletely recovered, and sight and hearing had returned. Figure 191\r\nshows the extent of the injury, and the ultimate results of the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nSchaeffer also reports the case of a woman working in a button factory\r\nat Union City, Conn., in 1871, who placed her head under a swiftly\r\nturning shaft to pick up a button, when her hair caught in the shaft,\r\ntaking off her scalp from the nape of the neck to the eyebrows. The\r\nscalp was cleansed by her physician, Dr. Bartlett, and placed on her\r\nhead about two hours after the accident, but it did not stay in\r\nposition. Then the head was covered twice by skin-grafts, but each time\r\nthe grafts were lost; but the third time a successful grafting was\r\nperformed and she was enabled to work after a period of two years. The\r\nsame authority also quotes Wilson and Way of Bristol, Conn., in an\r\naccount of a complete avulsion of the scalp, together with tearing of\r\nthe eyelid and ear. The result of the skin-grafting was not given.\r\nPowell of Chicago gives an account of a girl of nineteen who lost her\r\nscalp while working in the Elgin Watch Factory at Elgin, Illinois. The\r\nwound extended across the forehead above the eyebrows, but the ears\r\nwere untouched.  Skin-grafting was tried in this case but with no\r\nresult, and the woman afterward lost an eye by exposure, from\r\nretraction of the eyelid.\r\n\r\nIn some cases extensive wounds of the scalp heal without artificial aid\r\nby simply cicatrizing over. Gross mentions such a case in a young lady,\r\nwho, in 1869, lost her scalp in a factory.  There is reported an\r\naccount of a conductor on the Union Pacific Railroad, who, near\r\nCheyenne, in 1869, was scalped by Sioux Indians. He suffered an\r\nelliptic wound, ten by eight cm., a portion of the outer table of the\r\ncranium being removed, yet the wound healed over.\r\n\r\nCerebral Injuries.--The recent advances in brain-surgery have, in a\r\nmeasure, diminished the interest and wonder of some of the older\r\ninstances of major injuries of the cerebral contents with unimportant\r\nafter-results, and in reviewing the older cases we must remember that\r\nthe recoveries were made under the most unfavorable conditions, and\r\nwithout the slightest knowledge of all important asepsis and antisepsis.\r\n\r\nPenetration or even complete transfixion of the brain is not always\r\nattended with serious symptoms. Dubrisay is accredited with the\r\ndescription of a man of forty-four, who, with suicidal intent, drove a\r\ndagger ten cm. long and one cm. wide into his brain. He had\r\ndeliberately held the dagger in his left hand, and with a mallet in his\r\nright hand struck the steel several blows.  When seen two hours later\r\nhe claimed that he experienced no pain, and the dagger was sticking out\r\nof his head. For half an hour efforts at extraction were made, but with\r\nno avail. He was placed on the ground and held by two persons while\r\ntraction was made with carpenter's pliers. This failing, he was taken\r\nto a coppersmith's, where he was fastened by rings to the ground, and\r\nstrong pinchers were placed over the dagger and attached to a chain\r\nwhich was fastened to a cylinder revolved by steam force.  At the\r\nsecond turn of the cylinder the dagger came out. During all the efforts\r\nat extraction the patient remained perfectly cool and complained of no\r\npain. A few drops of blood escaped from the wound after the removal of\r\nthe dagger, and in a few minutes the man walked to a hospital where he\r\nremained a few days without fever or pain. The wound healed, and he\r\nsoon returned to work. By experiments on the cadaver Dubrisay found\r\nthat the difficulty in extraction was due to rust on the steel, and by\r\nthe serrated edges of the wound in the bone.\r\n\r\nWarren describes a case of epilepsy of seven months' standing, from\r\ndepression of the skull caused by a red hot poker thrown at the\r\nsubject's head. Striking the frontal bone just above the orbit, it\r\nentered three inches into the cerebral substance.  Kesteven reports the\r\nhistory of a boy of thirteen who, while holding a fork in his hand,\r\nfell from the top of a load of straw.  One of the prongs entered the\r\nhead one inch behind and on a line with the lobe of the left ear and\r\npassed upward and slightly backward to almost its entire length. With\r\nsome difficulty it was withdrawn by a fellow workman; the point was\r\nbent on itself to the extent of two inches. The patient lived nine\r\ndays. Abel and Colman have reported a case of puncture of the brain\r\nwith loss of memory, of which the following extract is an epitome: \"A\r\nrailway-fireman, thirty-six years old, while carrying an oil-feeder in\r\nhis hand, slipped and fell forward, the spout of the can being driven\r\nforcibly into his face. There was transitory loss of consciousness,\r\nfollowed by twitching and jerking movements of the limbs, most marked\r\non the left side, the legs being drawn up and the body bent forward.\r\nThere was no hemorrhage from mouth, nose, or ears. The metallic spout\r\nof the oil-can was firmly fixed in the base of the skull, and was only\r\nremoved from the grasp of the bone by firm traction with forceps. It\r\nhad passed upward and toward the middle line, with its concavity\r\ndirected from the middle line. Its end was firmly plugged by bone from\r\nthe base of the skull. No hemorrhage followed its removal.  The wound\r\nwas cleansed and a simple iodoform-dressing applied.  The violent\r\njerking movements were replaced by a few occasional twitchings. It was\r\nnow found that the left side of the face and the left arm were\r\nparalyzed, with inability to close the left eye completely. The man\r\nbecame drowsy and confused, and was unable to give replies to any but\r\nthe simplest questions. The temperature rose to 102 degrees; the pupils\r\nbecame contracted, the right in a greater degree than the left; both\r\nreacted to light. The left leg began to lose power. There was complete\r\nanesthesia of the right eyebrow and of both eyelids and of the right\r\ncheek for an uncertain distance below the lower eyelid. The conjunctiva\r\nof the right eye became congested, and a small ulcer formed on the\r\nright cornea, which healed without much trouble. In the course of a few\r\ndays power began to return, first in the left leg and afterward, though\r\nto a much less extent, in the left arm. For two weeks there was\r\ndrowsiness, and the man slept considerably. He was apathetic, and for\r\nmany days passed urine in bed. He could not recognize his wife or old\r\ncomrades, and had also difficulty in recognizing common objects and\r\ntheir uses. The most remarkable feature was the loss of all memory of\r\nhis life for twenty years before the accident. As time went on, the\r\nperiod included in this loss of memory was reduced to five years\r\npreceding the accident.  The hemiplegia persisted, although the man was\r\nable to get about.  Sensibility was lost to all forms of stimuli in the\r\nright upper eyelid, forehead, and anterior part of the scalp,\r\ncorresponding with the distribution of the supraorbital and nasal\r\nnerves. The cornea was completely anesthetic, and the right cheek, an\r\ninch and a half external to the angle of the nose, presented a small\r\npatch of anesthesia. There was undue emotional mobility, the patient\r\nlaughing or crying on slight provocation. The condition of\r\nmind-blindness remained. It is believed that the spout of the oil-can\r\nmust have passed under the zygoma to the base of the skull, perforating\r\nthe great wing of the spheroid bone and penetrating the centrum ovale,\r\ninjuring the anterior fibers of the motor tract in the internal capsule\r\nnear the genu.\"\r\n\r\nFigures 192 and 193 show the outline and probable course of the spout.\r\n\r\nBeaumont reports the history of an injury in a man of forty-five, who,\r\nstanding but 12 yards away, was struck in the orbit by a rocket, which\r\npenetrated through the spheroidal fissure into the middle and posterior\r\nlobes of the left hemisphere. He did not fall at the time he was\r\nstruck, and fifteen minutes after the stick was removed he arose\r\nwithout help and walked away.  Apparently no extensive cerebral lesion\r\nhad been caused, and the man suffered no subsequent cerebral symptoms\r\nexcept, three years afterward, impairment of memory.\r\n\r\nThere is an account given by Chelius of an extraordinary wound caused\r\nby a ramrod. The rod was accidentally discharged while being employed\r\nin loading, and struck a person a few paces away.  It entered the head\r\nnear the root of the zygomatic arch, about a finger's breadth from the\r\nouter corner of the right eye, passed through the head, emerging at the\r\nposterior superior angle of the parietal bone, a finger's breadth from\r\nthe sagittal suture, and about the same distance above the superior\r\nangle of the occipital bone. The wounded man attempted to pull the\r\nramrod out, but all his efforts were ineffectual. After the tolerance\r\nof this foreign body for some time, one of his companions managed to\r\nextract it, and when it was brought out it was as straight as the day\r\nit left the maker's shop. Little blood was lost, and the wound healed\r\nrapidly and completely; in spite of this major injury the patient\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nCarpenter reports the curious case of an insane man who deliberately\r\nbored holes through his skull, and at different times, at a point above\r\nthe ear, he inserted into his brain five pieces of No. 20 broom wire\r\nfrom 2 1/16 to 6 3/4 inches in length, a fourpenny nail 2 1/4 inches\r\nlong, and a needle 1 5/8 inches long. Despite these desperate attempts\r\nat suicide he lived several months, finally accomplishing his purpose\r\nby taking an overdose of morphin. MacQueen has given the history of a\r\nman of thirty-five, who drove one three-inch nail into his forehead,\r\nanother close to his occiput, and a third into his vertex an inch in\r\nfront and 1/4 inch to the left of the middle line. He had used a hammer\r\nto effect complete penetration, hoping that death would result from his\r\ninjuries. He failed in this, as about five weeks later he was\r\ndischarged from the Princess Alice Hospital at Eastbourne, perfectly\r\nrecovered. There is a record of a man by the name of Bulkley who was\r\nfound, by a police officer in Philadelphia, staggering along the\r\nstreets, and was taken to the inebriate ward of the Blockley Hospital,\r\nwhere he subsequently sank and died, after having been transferred from\r\nward to ward, his symptoms appearing inexplicable. A postmortem\r\nexamination revealed the fact that an ordinary knife-blade had been\r\ndriven into his brain on the right side, just above the ear, and was\r\ncompletely hidden by the skin. It had evidently become loosened from\r\nthe handle when the patient was stabbed, and had remained in the brain\r\nseveral days. No clue to the assailant was found.\r\n\r\nThudicum mentions the case of a man who walked from Strafford to\r\nNewcastle, and from Newcastle to London, where he died, and in his\r\nbrain was found the breech-pin of a gun. Neiman describes a severe\r\ngunshot wound of the frontal region, in which the iron breech-block of\r\nan old-fashioned muzzle-loading gun was driven into the substance of\r\nthe brain, requiring great force for its extraction. The patient, a\r\nyoung man of twenty-eight, was unconscious but a short time, and\r\nhappily made a good recovery. A few pieces of bone came away, and the\r\nwound healed with only a slight depression of the forehead. Wilson\r\nspeaks of a child who fell on an upright copper paper-file, which\r\npenetrated the right side of the occipital bone, below the external\r\norifice of the ear, and entered the brain for more than three inches;\r\nand yet the child made a speedy recovery.\r\n\r\nBaron Larrey knew of a man whose head was completely transfixed by a\r\nramrod, which extended from the middle of the forehead to the left side\r\nof the nape of the neck; despite this serious injury the man lived two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nJewett records the case of an Irish drayman who, without treatment,\r\nworked for forty-seven days after receiving a penetrating wound of the\r\nskull 1/4 inch in diameter and four inches deep. Recovery ensued in\r\nspite of the delay in treatment.\r\n\r\nGunshot Injuries.--Swain mentions a patient who stood before a looking\r\nglass, and, turning his head far around to the left, fired a pistol\r\nshot into his brain behind the right ear. The bullet passed into his\r\nmouth, and he spat it out. Some bleeding occurred from both the\r\ninternal and external wounds; the man soon began to suffer with a\r\ntroublesome cough, with bloody expectoration; his tongue was coated and\r\ndrawn to the right; he became slightly deaf in his right ear and\r\ndragged his left leg in walking. These symptoms, together with those of\r\ncongestion of the lung, continued for about a week, when he died,\r\napparently from his pulmonary trouble.\r\n\r\nFord quotes the case of a lad of fifteen who was shot in the head, 3/4\r\ninch anterior to the summit of the right ear, the ball escaping through\r\nthe left os frontis, 1 1/4 inch above the center of the brow. Recovery\r\nensued, with a cicatrix on the forehead, through which the pulsations\r\nof the brain could be distinctly seen. The senses were not at all\r\ndeteriorated.\r\n\r\nRichardson tells of a soldier who was struck by a Minie ball on the\r\nleft temporal bone; the missile passed out through the left frontal\r\nbone 1/2 inch to the left of the middle of the forehead.  He was only\r\nstunned, and twenty-four hours later his intellect was undisturbed.\r\nThere was no operation; free suppuration with discharges of fragments\r\nof skull and broken-down substance ensued for four weeks, when the\r\nwounds closed kindly, and recovery followed.\r\n\r\nAngle records the case of a cowboy who was shot by a comrade in\r\nmistake. The ball entered the skull beneath the left mastoid process\r\nand passed out of the right eye. The man recovered.\r\n\r\nRice describes the case of a boy of fourteen who was shot in the head,\r\nthe ball directly traversing the brain substance, some of which\r\nprotruded from the wound. The boy recovered. The ball entered one inch\r\nabove and in front of the right ear and made its exit through the\r\nlambdoidal suture posteriorly.\r\n\r\nHall of Denver, Col., in an interesting study of gunshot wounds of the\r\nbrain, writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It is in regard to injuries involving the brain that the question of\r\nthe production of immediate unconsciousness assumes the greatest\r\ninterest. We may state broadly that if the medulla or the great centers\r\nat the base of the brain are wounded by a bullet, instant\r\nunconsciousness must result; with any other wounds involving the\r\nbrain-substance it will, with very great probability, result. But there\r\nis a very broad area of uncertainty. Many instances have been recorded\r\nin which the entrance of a small bullet into the anterior part of the\r\nbrain has not prevented the firing of a second shot on the part of the\r\nsuicide. Personally, I have not observed such a case, however.  But,\r\naside from the injuries by the smallest missiles in the anterior parts\r\nof the brain, we may speak with almost absolute certainty with regard\r\nto the production of unconsciousness, for the jar to the brain from the\r\nblow of the bullet upon the skull would produce such a result even if\r\nthe damage to the brain were not sufficient to do so.\r\n\r\n\"Many injuries to the brain from bullets of moderate size and low\r\nvelocity do not cause more than a temporary loss of consciousness, and\r\nthe subjects are seen by the surgeon, after the lapse of half an hour\r\nor more, apparently sound of mind.  These are the cases in which the\r\nball has lost its momentum in passing through the skull, and has\r\nconsequently done little damage to the brain-substance, excepting to\r\nmake a passage for itself for a short distance into the brain. It is\r\napparently well established that, in the case of the rifle-bullet of\r\nhigh velocity, and especially if fired from the modern military weapons\r\nusing nitro-powders, and giving an enormous initial velocity to the\r\nbullet, the transmission of the force from the displaced particles of\r\nbrain (and this rule applies to any other of the soft organs as well)\r\nto the adjacent parts is such as to disorganize much of the tissue\r\nsurrounding the original track of the missile. Under these\r\ncircumstances a much slighter wound would be necessary to produce\r\nunconsciousness or death than in the case of a bullet of low velocity,\r\nespecially if it were light in weight. Thus I have recorded elsewhere\r\nan instance of instant death in a grizzly bear, an animal certainly as\r\ntenacious of life as any we have, from a mere furrow, less than a\r\nquarter of an inch in depth, through the cortex of the brain, without\r\ninjury of the skull excepting the removal of the bone necessary for the\r\nproduction of this furrow. The jar to the brain from a bullet of great\r\nvelocity, as in this case, was alone sufficient to injure the organ\r\nirreparably. In a similar manner I have known a deer to be killed by\r\nthe impact of a heavy rifle-ball against one horn, although there was\r\nno evidence of fracture of the skull. On the other hand, game animals\r\noften escape after such injuries not directly involving the brain,\r\nalthough temporarily rendered unconscious, as I have observed in\r\nseveral instances, the diagnosis undoubtedly being concussion of the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n\"Slight injury to the brain, and especially if it be unilateral, then,\r\nmay not produce unconsciousness. It is not very uncommon for a missile\r\nfrom a heavy weapon to strike the skull, and be deflected without the\r\nproduction of such a state. Near the town in which I formerly\r\npracticed, the town-marshal shot at a negro, who resisted arrest, at a\r\ndistance of only a few feet, with a 44-caliber revolver, striking the\r\nculprit on the side of the head.  The wound showed that the ball struck\r\nthe skull and plowed along under the scalp for several inches before\r\nemerging, but it did not even knock the negro down, and no\r\nunconsciousness followed later. I once examined an express-messenger\r\nwho had been shot in the occipital region by a weapon of similar size,\r\nwhile seated at his desk in the car. The blow was a very glancing one\r\nand did not produce unconsciousness, and probably, as in the case of\r\nthe negro, because it did not strike with sufficient directness.\"\r\n\r\nHead Injuries with Loss of Cerebral Substance.--The brain and its\r\nmembranes may be severely wounded, portions of the cranium or cerebral\r\nsubstance destroyed or lost, and yet recovery ensue.  Possibly the most\r\nnoted injury of this class was that reported by Harlow and commonly\r\nknown as \"Bigelow's Case\" or the \"American Crow-bar Case.\" Phineas P.\r\nGage, aged twenty-five, a foreman on the Rutland and Burlington\r\nRailroad, was employed September 13, 1847, in charging a hole with\r\npowder preparatory to blasting. A premature explosion drove a\r\ntamping-iron, three feet seven inches long, 1 1/4 inches in diameter,\r\nweighing 13 1/4 pounds, completely through the man's head. The iron was\r\nround and comparatively smooth; the pointed end entered first. The iron\r\nstruck against the left side of the face, immediately anterior to the\r\ninferior maxillary and passed under the zygomatic arch, fracturing\r\nportions of the spheroid bone and the floor of the left orbit; it then\r\npassed through the left anterior lobe of the cerebrum, and, in the\r\nmedian line, made its exit at the junction of the coronal and sagittal\r\nsutures, lacerating the longitudinal sinus, fracturing the parietal and\r\nfrontal bones, and breaking up considerable of the brain; the globe of\r\nthe left eye protruded nearly one-half of its diameter. The patient was\r\nthrown backward and gave a few convulsive movements of the extremities.\r\nHe was taken to a hotel 3/4 mile distant, and during the transportation\r\nseemed slightly dazed, but not at all unconscious. Upon arriving at the\r\nhotel he dismounted from the conveyance, and without assistance walked\r\nup a long flight of stairs to the hall where his wound was to be\r\ndressed. Harlow saw him at about six o'clock in the evening, and from\r\nhis condition could hardly credit the story of his injury, although his\r\nperson and his bed were drenched with blood. His scalp was shaved, the\r\ncoagula and debris removed, and among other portions of bone was a\r\npiece of the anterior superior angle of each parietal bone and a\r\nsemicircular piece of the frontal bone, leaving an opening 3 1/2 inches\r\nin diameter. At 10 P.M. on the day of the injury Gage was perfectly\r\nrational and asked about his work and after his friends. After a while\r\ndelirium set in for a few days, and on the eleventh day he lost the\r\nvision in the left eye. His convalescence was rapid and uneventful. It\r\nwas said that he discharged pieces of bone and cerebral substance from\r\nhis mouth for a few days. The iron when found was smeared with blood\r\nand cerebral substance.\r\n\r\nAs was most natural such a wonderful case of cerebral injury attracted\r\nmuch notice. Not only was the case remarkable in the apparent innocuous\r\nloss of cerebral substance, but in the singular chance which exempted\r\nthe brain from either concussion or compression, and subsequent\r\ninflammation. Professor Bigelow examined the patient in January, 1850,\r\nand made a most excellent report of the case, and it is due to his\r\nefforts that the case attained world-wide notoriety. Bigelow found the\r\npatient quite recovered in his faculties of body and mind, except that\r\nhe had lost the sight of the injured eye. He exhibited a linear\r\ncicatrix one inch long near the angle of the ramus of the left lower\r\njaw.  His left eyelid was involuntarily closed and he had no power to\r\novercome his ptosis. Upon the head, well covered by the hair, was a\r\nlarge unequal depression and elevation. In order to ascertain how far\r\nit might be possible for a bar of the size causing the injury to\r\ntraverse the skull in the track assigned to it, Bigelow procured a\r\ncommon skull in which the zygomatic arches were barely visible from\r\nabove, and having entered a drill near the left angle of the inferior\r\nmaxilla, he passed it obliquely upward to the median line of the\r\ncranium just in front of the junction of the sagittal and coronal\r\nsutures. This aperture was then enlarged until it allowed the passage\r\nof the bar in question, and the loss of substance strikingly\r\ncorresponded with the lesion said to have been received by the patient.\r\nFrom the coronoid process of the inferior maxilla there was removed a\r\nfragment measuring about 3/4 inch in length. This fragment, in the\r\npatient's case, might have been fractured and subsequently reunited.\r\nThe iron bar, together with a cast of the patient's head, was placed in\r\nthe Museum of the Massachusetts Medical College.\r\n\r\nBigelow appends an engraving to his paper. In the illustration the\r\nparts are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Lateral view of a prepared cranium representing the iron bar\r\ntraversing its cavity.\r\n\r\n(2) Front view of same.\r\n\r\n(3) Plan of the base seen from within. In these three figures the optic\r\nforamina are seen to be intact and are occupied by small white rods.\r\n\r\n(4) Cast taken from the shaved head of the patient representing the\r\nappearance of the fracture in 1850, the anterior fragment being\r\nconsiderably elevated in the profile view.\r\n\r\n(5) The iron bar with length and diameter in proportion to the size of\r\nthe other figures.\r\n\r\nHeaton reports a case in which, by an explosion, a tamping-iron was\r\ndriven through the chin of a man into the cerebrum. Although there was\r\nloss of brain-substance, the man recovered with his mental faculties\r\nunimpaired. A second case was that of a man who, during an explosion,\r\nwas wounded in the skull. There was visible a triangular depression,\r\nfrom which, possibly, an ounce of brain-substance issued. This man also\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nJewett mentions a case in which an injury somewhat similar to that in\r\nBigelow's case was produced by a gas-pipe.\r\n\r\nAmong older writers, speaking of loss of brain-substance with\r\nsubsequent recovery, Brasavolus saw as much brain evacuated as would\r\nfill an egg shell; the patient afterward had an impediment of speech\r\nand grew stupid. Franciscus Arcaeus gives the narrative of a workman\r\nwho was struck on the head by a stone weighing 24 pounds falling from a\r\nheight. The skull was fractured; fragments of bone were driven into the\r\nbrain. For three days the patient was unconscious and almost lifeless.\r\nAfter the eighth day a cranial abscess spontaneously opened, from the\r\nsinciput to the occiput, and a large quantity of \"corruption\" was\r\nevacuated.  Speech returned soon after, the eyes opened, and in twenty\r\ndays the man could distinguish objects. In four months recovery was\r\nentire. Bontius relates a singular accident to a sailor, whose head was\r\ncrushed between a ship and a small boat; the greater part of the\r\noccipital bone was taken away in fragments, the injury extending almost\r\nto the foremen magnum. Bontius asserts that the patient was perfectly\r\ncured by another surgeon and himself. Galen mentions an injury to a\r\nyouth in Smyrna, in whom the brain was so seriously wounded that the\r\nanterior ventricles were opened; and vet the patient recovered.\r\nGlandorp mentions a case of fracture of the skull out of which his\r\nfather took large portions of brain and some fragments of bone. He adds\r\nthat the man was afterward paralyzed an the opposite side and became\r\nsingularly irritable. In his \"Chirurgical Observations,\" Job van\r\nMeek'ren tells the story of a Russian nobleman who lost part of his\r\nskull, and a dog's skull was supplied in its place. The bigoted divines\r\nof the country excommunicated the man, and would not annul his sentence\r\nuntil he submitted to have the bit of foreign bone removed.\r\n\r\nMendenhall reports the history of an injury to a laborer nineteen years\r\nold. While sitting on a log a few feet from a comrade who was chopping\r\nwood, the axe glanced and, slipping from the woodman's grasp, struck\r\nhim just above the ear, burying the \"bit\" of the axe in his skull. Two\r\nhours afterward he was seen almost pulseless, and his clothing drenched\r\nwith blood which was still oozing from the wound with mixed\r\nbrain-substance and fragments of bone. The cut was horizontal on a\r\nlevel with the orbit, 5 1/2 inches long externally, and, owing to the\r\nconvex shape of the axe, a little less internally. Small spicules of\r\nbone were removed, and a cloth was placed on the battered skull to\r\nreceive the discharges for the inspection of the surgeon, who on his\r\narrival saw at least two tablespoonfuls of cerebral substance on this\r\ncloth. Contrary to all expectation this man recovered, but, strangely,\r\nhe had a marked and peculiar change of voice, and this was permanent.\r\nFrom the time of the reception of the injury his whole mental and moral\r\nnature had undergone a pronounced change.  Before the injury, the\r\npatient was considered a quiet, unassuming, and stupid boy, but\r\nuniversally regarded as honest.  Afterward he became noisy,\r\nself-asserting, sharp, and seemingly devoid of moral sense or honesty.\r\nThese new traits developed immediately, and more strikingly so soon as\r\nconvalescence was established.\r\n\r\nBergtold quotes a case reported in 1857 of extreme injury to the\r\ncranium and its contents. While sleeping on the deck of a canal boat, a\r\nman at Highspire was seriously injured by striking his head against a\r\nbridge. When seen by the surgeon his hair was matted and his clothes\r\nsaturated with blood. There was a terrible gap in the scalp from the\r\nsuperciliary ridge to the occipital bone, and, though full of clots,\r\nthe wound was still oozing. In a cloth on a bench opposite were rolled\r\nup a portion of the malar bone, some fragments of the os frontis, one\r\nentire right parietal bone, detached from its fellow along the sagittel\r\nsuture, and from the occipital along the lambdoidal suture, perhaps\r\ntaking with it some of the occipital bone together with some of the\r\nsquamous portion of the temporal bone. This bone was as clean of soft\r\nparts as if it had been removed from a dead subject with a scalpel and\r\nsaw. No sight of the membranes or of the substance of the brain was\r\nobtained. The piece of cranium removed was 6 3/4 inches in the\r\nlongitudinal diameter, and 5 3/4 inches in the short oval diameter. The\r\ndressing occupied an hour, at the end of which the patient arose to his\r\nfeet and changed his clothes as though nothing had happened. Twenty-six\r\nyears after the accident there was slight unsteadiness of gait, and\r\ngradual paralysis of the left leg and arm and the opposite side of the\r\nface, but otherwise the man was in good condition. In place of the\r\nparietal bone the head presented a marked deficiency as though a slice\r\nof the skull were cut out. The depressed area measured five by six\r\ninches. In 1887 the man left the hospital in Buffalo with the paralysis\r\nimproved, but his mental equilibrium could be easily disturbed. He\r\nbecame hysteric and sobbed when scolded.\r\n\r\nBuchanan mentions the history of a case in a woman of twenty-one, who,\r\nwhile working in a mill, was struck by a bolt. Her skull was fractured\r\nand driven into the brain comminuted. Hanging from the wound was a bit\r\nof brain-substance, the size of a finger, composed of convolution as\r\nwell as white matter. The wound healed, there was no hernia, and at the\r\ntime of report the girl was conscious of no disturbance, not even a\r\nheadache. There was nothing indicative of the reception of the injury\r\nexcept a scar near the edge of the hair on the upper part of the right\r\nside of the forehead. Steele, in a school-boy of eight, mentions a case\r\nof very severe injury to the bones of the face and head, with escape of\r\ncerebral substance, and recovery. The injury was caused by falling into\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThere was a seaman aboard of the U.S.S. \"Constellation,\" who fell\r\nthrough a hatchway from the masthead, landing on the vertex of the\r\nhead. There was copious bleeding from the ears, 50 to 60 fluid-ounces\r\nof blood oozing in a few hours, mingled with small fragments of\r\nbrain-tissue. The next day the discharge became watery, and in it were\r\nfound small pieces of true brain-substance. In five weeks the man\r\nreturned to duty complaining only of giddiness and of a \"stuffed-up\"\r\nhead. In 1846 there is a record of a man of forty who fell from a\r\nscaffold, erected at a height of 20 feet, striking on his head. He was\r\nat first stunned, but on admission to the hospital recovered\r\nconsciousness. A small wound was found over the right eyebrow,\r\nprotruding from which was a portion of brain-substance. There was\r\nslight hemorrhage from the right nostril, and some pain in the head,\r\nbut the pulse and respiration were undisturbed. On the following day a\r\nfragment of the cerebral substance, about the size of a hazel-nut,\r\ntogether with some brood-clots, escaped from the right nostril. In this\r\ncase the inner wall of the frontal sinus was broken, affording exit for\r\nthe lacerated brain.\r\n\r\nCooke and Laycock mention a case of intracranial injury with extensive\r\ndestruction of brain-substance around the Rolandic area; there was\r\nrecovery but with loss of the so called muscular sense. The patient, a\r\nworkman of twenty-nine, while cutting down a gum-tree, was struck by a\r\nbranch as thick as a man's arm, which fell from 100 feet overhead,\r\ninflicting a compound comminuted fracture of the cranium. The right eye\r\nwas contused but the pupils equal; the vertex-wound was full of\r\nbrain-substance and pieces of bone, ten of which were removed, leaving\r\nan oval opening four by three inches. The base of the skull was\r\nfractured behind the orbits; a fissure 1/4 inch wide was discernible,\r\nand the right frontal bone could be easily moved. The lacerated and\r\ncontused brain-substance was removed. Consciousness returned six days\r\nafter the operation. The accompanying illustrations (Figs.  196 and\r\n197) show the extent of the injury. The lower half of the ascending\r\nfrontal convolution, the greater half of the sigmoid gyrus, the\r\nposterior third of the lower and middle frontal convolutions, the base\r\nand posterior end of the upper convolution, and the base of the\r\ncorresponding portion of the falciform lobe were involved. The sensory\r\nand motor functions of the arm were retained in a relative degree.\r\nThere was power of simple movements, but complex movements were\r\nawkward. The tactile localization was almost lost.\r\n\r\nMorton mentions a patient of forty-seven, who was injured in a railroad\r\naccident near Phoenixville, Pa.; there was a compound comminuted\r\nfracture of the skull involving the left temporal, spheroid, and\r\nsuperior maxillary bones. The side of the head and the ear were\r\nconsiderably lacerated; several teeth were broken, and besides this\r\nthere was injury to the aura and cerebral substance. There was profound\r\ncoma for ten days and paralysis of the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 6th, and 7th\r\ncranial nerves, particularly affecting the left side of the face. There\r\nwas scarcely enough blood-supply left to the orbit to maintain life in\r\nthe globe. The man primarily recovered, but ninety-one days from the\r\ninjury he died of cerebral abscess.\r\n\r\nThere is the record of a curious brain-injury in a man of twenty-two,\r\nwho was struck on the skull by a circular saw. The saw cut directly\r\ndown into the brain, severing the superior longitudinal sinus, besides\r\ntearing a branch of the meningeal artery. The wound was filled with\r\nsawdust left by the saw while it was tearing through the parts. After\r\nordinary treatment the man recovered.\r\n\r\nBird reports a compound comminuted fracture of the left temporal\r\nregion, with loss of bone, together with six drams of brain-substance,\r\nwhich, however, was followed by recovery. Tagert gives an instance of\r\ncompound depressed fracture of the skull, with loss of brain-substance,\r\nin which recovery was effected without operative interference. Ballou,\r\nBartlett, Buckner, Capon, Carmichael, Corban, Maunder and many others,\r\ncite instances of cranial fracture and loss of brain-substance, with\r\nsubsequent recovery. Halsted reports the history of a boy of seventeen,\r\nwho, while out fowling, had the breech-pin of a shot-gun blown out, the\r\nsharp point striking the forehead in the frontal suture, crushing the\r\nos frontis, destroying 1 3/4 inches of the longitudinal sinus, and\r\ncausing severe hemorrhage from both the longitudinal and frontal\r\nsinuses. The pin was pulled out by the boy, who washed his own face,\r\nand lay down; he soon became semi-comatose, in which condition he\r\nremained for some days; but, after operation, he made complete recovery.\r\n\r\nLoss of Brain-substance from Cerebral Tumor.--Koser is accredited with\r\nreporting results of a postmortem held on a young man of twenty who\r\nsuffered from a cerebral tumor of considerable duration. It was stated\r\nthat, although there was a cavity in the brain at least five inches in\r\nlength, the patient, almost up to the time of death, was possessed of\r\nthe senses of touch, taste, hearing, and smell, showed considerable\r\ncontrol over his locomotor muscles, and could talk. In fact, he was\r\npractically discommoded in no other way than by loss of vision, caused\r\nby pressure on the optic centers. It was also stated that the retention\r\nof memory was remarkable, and, up to within two weeks of his death, the\r\npatient was able to memorize poems. The amount of involvement\r\ndiscovered postmortem in cases similar to the preceding is astonishing.\r\nAt a recent pathologic display in London several remarkable specimens\r\nwere shown.\r\n\r\nExtensive Fractures of the Skull. Jennings mentions an instance of\r\nextensive fracture of the skull, 14 pieces of the cranium being found.\r\nThe patient lived five weeks and two days after the injury, the\r\nimmediate cause of death being edema of the lungs.  His language was\r\nincoherent and full of oaths. Belloste, in his \"Hospital Surgeon,\"\r\nstates that he had under has care a most dreadful case of a girl of\r\neleven or twelve years, who received 18 or 19 cutlass wounds of the\r\nhead, each so violent as to chip out pieces of bone; but,\r\nnotwithstanding her severe injuries, she made recovery. At the\r\nEmergency Hospital in Washington, D.C., there was received a negress\r\nwith at least six gaping wounds of the head, in some cases denuding the\r\nperiosteum and cutting the cranium. During a debauch the night before\r\nshe had been engaged in a quarrel with a negro with whom she lived, and\r\nwas struck by him several times on the head with an axe. She lay all\r\nnight unconscious, and was discovered the next morning with her hair\r\nand clothes and the floor on which she lay drenched with blood.  The\r\nambulance was summoned to take her to the morgue, but on the arrival of\r\nthe police it was seen that feeble signs of life still existed. On\r\nadmission to the hospital she was semi-comatose, almost pulseless,\r\ncold, and exhibiting all the signs of extreme hemorrhage and shock. Her\r\nhead was cleaned up, but her condition would not permit of any other\r\ntreatment than a corrosive-sublimate compress and a bandage of\r\nScultetus. She was taken to the hospital ward, where warmth and\r\nstimulants were applied, after which she completely reacted. She\r\nprogressed so well that it was not deemed advisable to remove the\r\nhead-bandage until the fourth day, when it was seen that the wounds had\r\nalmost entirely healed and suppuration was virtually absent. The\r\npatient rapidly and completely recovered, and her neighbors, on her\r\nreturn home, could hardly believe that she was the same woman whom, a\r\nfew days before, they were preparing to take to the morgue.\r\n\r\nA serious injury, which is not at all infrequent, is that caused by\r\ndiving into shallow water, or into a bath from which water has been\r\nwithdrawn. Curran mentions a British officer in India who, being\r\noverheated, stopped at a station bath in which the previous night he\r\nhad had a plunge, and without examining, took a violent \"header\" into\r\nthe tank, confidently expecting to strike from eight to ten feet of\r\nwater. He dashed his head against the concrete bottom 12 feet below\r\n(the water two hours previously having been withdrawn) and crushed his\r\nbrain and skull into an indistinguishable mass.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases on record in which an injury, particularly a\r\ngunshot wound of the skull, though showing no external wound, has\r\ncaused death by producing a fracture of the internal table of the\r\ncranium. Pare gives details of the case of a nobleman whose head was\r\nguarded by a helmet and who was struck by a ball, leaving no external\r\nsign of injury, but it was subsequently found that there was an\r\ninternal fracture of the cranium. Tulpius and Scultetus are among the\r\nolder writers reporting somewhat similar instances, and there are\r\nseveral analogous cases reported as having occurred during the War of\r\nthe Rebellion. Boling reports a case in which the internal table was\r\nsplintered to a much greater extent than the external.\r\n\r\nFracture of the base of the skull is ordinarily spoken of as a fatal\r\ninjury, reported instances of recovery being extremely rare, but\r\nBattle, in a paper on this subject, has collected numerous statistics\r\nof nonfatal fracture of the base of the brain, viz.:--\r\n\r\n                                        Male. Female.\r\n  Anterior fossa, . . . . . . . . . . .    16    5\r\n  Middle fossa, . . . . . . . . . . . .    50    6\r\n  Posterior fossa,. . . . . . . . . . .    10    1\r\n  Middle and anterior fossae, . . . . .    15    5\r\n  Middle and posterior fossae,. . . . .     4    1\r\n  Anterior, middle, and posterior fossae,   1    0\r\n                                        ------ ------\r\n                                           96    18  Total, 114.\r\n\r\nIn a paper on nonmortal fractures of the base of the skull, Lidell\r\ngives an account of 135 cases. MacCormac reports a case of a boy of\r\nnine who was run over by a carriage drawn by a pair of horses. He\r\nsuffered fracture of the base of the skull, of the bones of the face,\r\nand of the left ulna, and although suppuration at the points of\r\nfracture ensued, followed by an optic neuritis, an ultimate recovery\r\nwas effected. Ball, an Irish surgeon, has collected several instances\r\nin which the base of the skull has been driven in and the condyle of\r\nthe jaw impacted in the opening by force transmitted through the lower\r\nmaxilla.\r\n\r\nThe tolerance of foreign bodies in the brain is most marvelous.  In the\r\nancient chronicles of Koenigsberg there is recorded the history of a\r\nman who for fourteen years carried in his head a piece of iron as large\r\nas his finger. After its long lodgment, during which the subject was\r\nlittle discommoded, it finally came out by the palatine arch. There is\r\nalso an old record of a ball lodging near the sella turcica for over a\r\nyear, the patient dying suddenly of an entirely different accident.\r\nFabricius Hildanus relates the history of an injury, in which, without\r\ncausing any uncomfortable symptoms, a ball rested between the skull and\r\ndura for six months.\r\n\r\nAmatus Lusitanus speaks of a drunken courtesan who was wounded in a\r\nfray with a long, sharp-pointed knife which was driven into the head.\r\nNo apparent injury resulted, and death from fever took place eight\r\nyears after the reception of the injury. On opening the head a large\r\npiece of knife was found between the skull and dura. It is said that\r\nBenedictus mentions a Greek who was wounded, at the siege of Colchis,\r\nin the right temple by a dart and taken captive by the Turks; he lived\r\nfor twenty years in slavery, the wound having completely healed.\r\nObtaining his liberty, he came to Sidon, and five years after, as he\r\nwas washing his face, he was seized by a violent fit of sneezing, and\r\ndischarged from one of his nostrils a piece of the dart having an iron\r\npoint of considerable length.\r\n\r\nIn about 1884 there died in the Vienna Hospital a bookbinder of\r\nforty-five, who had always passed as an intelligent man, but who had at\r\nirregular intervals suffered from epileptic convulsions.  An iron nail\r\ncovered with rust was discovered in his brain; from the history of his\r\nlife and from the appearances of the nail it had evidently been lodged\r\nin the cerebrum since childhood.\r\n\r\nSlee mentions a case in which, after the death of a man from septic\r\nperitonitis following a bullet-wound of the intestines, he found\r\npostmortem a knife-blade 5/16 inch in width projecting into the brain\r\nto the depth of one inch. The blade was ensheathed in a strong fibrous\r\ncapsule 1/2 inch thick, and the adjacent brain-structure was apparently\r\nnormal. The blade was black and corroded, and had evidently passed\r\nbetween the sutures during boyhood as there was no depression or\r\ndisplacement of the cranial bones. The weapon had broken off just on a\r\nlevel with the skull, and had remained in situ until the time of death\r\nwithout causing any indicative symptoms. Slee does not state the man's\r\nage, but remarks that he was a married man and a father at the time of\r\nhis death, and had enjoyed the best of health up to the time he was\r\nshot in the abdomen. Callaghan, quoted in Erichsen's \"Surgery,\" remarks\r\nthat he knew of an officer who lived seven years with a portion of a\r\ngun-breech weighing three ounces lodged in his brain.\r\n\r\nLawson mentions the impaction of a portion of a breech of a gun in the\r\nforehead of a man for twelve years, with subsequent removal and\r\nrecovery. Waldon speaks of a similar case in which a fragment of the\r\nbreech weighing three ounces penetrated the cranium, and was lodged in\r\nthe brain for two months previous to the death of the patient.\r\n\r\nHuppert tells of the lodgment of a slate-pencil three inches long in\r\nthe brain during lifetime, death ultimately being caused by a slight\r\nhead-injury. Larry mentions a person who for some time carried a six\r\nounce ball in the brain and ultimately recovered.  Peter removed a\r\nmusket-ball from the frontal sinus after six years' lodgment, with\r\nsuccessful issue. Mastin has given an instance in which the blade of a\r\npen-knife remained in the brain six months, recovery following its\r\nremoval. Camden reports a case in which a ball received in a gunshot\r\nwound of the brain remained in situ for thirteen years; Cronyn mentions\r\na similar case in which a bullet rested in the brain for eight years.\r\nDoyle successfully removed an ounce Minie ball from the brain after a\r\nfifteen years' lodgment.\r\n\r\nPipe-stems, wires, shot, and other foreign bodies, are from time to\r\ntime recorded as remaining in the brain for some time. Wharton has\r\ncompiled elaborate statistics on this subject, commenting on 316 cases\r\nin which foreign bodies were lodged in the brain, and furnishing all\r\nthe necessary information to persons interested in this subject.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the nose, with marked deformity, are in a measure combated\r\nby devices invented for restoring the missing portions of the injured\r\nmember. Taliacotius, the distinguished Italian surgeon of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, devised an operation which now bears his name, and consists in\r\nfashioning a nose from the fleshy tissues of the arm. The arm is\r\napproximated to the head and held in this position by an apparatus or\r\nsystem of bandages for about ten days, at which time it is supposed\r\nthat it can be severed, and further trimming and paring of the nose is\r\nthen practiced. A column is subsequently made from the upper lip. In\r\nthe olden days there was a timorous legend representing Taliacotius\r\nmaking noses for his patients from the gluteal regions of other\r\npersons, which statement, needless to say, is not founded on fact.\r\nVarious modifications and improvements on the a Talicotian method have\r\nbeen made; but in recent years the Indian method, introduced by Carpue\r\ninto England in 1816, is generally preferred. Syme of Edinburgh, Wood,\r\nand Ollier have devised methods of restoring the nose, which bear their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nOhmann-Dumesnil reports a case of rhinophyma in a man of seventy-two,\r\nan alcoholic, who was originally affected with acne rosacea, on whom he\r\nperformed a most successful operation for restoration. The accompanying\r\nillustration shows the original deformity--a growth weighing two\r\npounds--and also pictures the appearance shortly after the operation.\r\nThis case is illustrative of the possibilities of plastic surgery in\r\nthe hands of a skilful and ingenious operator.\r\n\r\nAbout 1892 Dr. J. P. Parker then of Kansas City, Mo., restored the\r\nmissing bridge of a patient's nose by laying the sunken part open in\r\ntwo long flaps, denuding the distal extremity of the little finger of\r\nthe patient's right hand of nail, flesh, tendons, etc., and binding it\r\ninto the wound of the nose until firm union had taken place. The finger\r\nwas then amputated at the second joint and the plastic operation\r\ncompleted, with a result pleasing both to patient and operator.\r\n\r\nThere is a case quoted of a young man who, when first seen by his\r\nmedical attendant, had all the soft parts of the nose gone, except\r\none-third of the left ala and a thin flap of the septum which was lying\r\non the upper lip. The missing member was ferreted out and cleansed, and\r\nafter an hour's separation sutured on. The nostrils were daily syringed\r\nwith a corrosive sublimate solution, and on the tenth day the dressing\r\nwas removed; the nose was found active and well, with the single\r\nexception of a triangular notch on the right side, which was too\r\ngreatly bruised by the violence of the blow to recover. When we\r\nconsider the varicosity of this organ we can readily believe the\r\npossibility of the foregoing facts, and there is little doubt that more\r\nprecaution in suturing severed portions of the nose would render the\r\noperation of nose making a very rare one.\r\n\r\nMaxwell mentions a curious case of attempted suicide in which the ball,\r\npassing through the palatine process of the superior maxillary bone,\r\ncrushing the vomer to the extent of its own diameter, fell back through\r\nthe right nostril into the pharynx, was swallowed, and discharged from\r\nthe anus.\r\n\r\nDeformities of the nose causing enormous development, or the condition\r\ncalled \"double-nose\" by Bartholinus, Borellus, Bidault, and others, are\r\nordinarily results of a pathologic development of the sebaceous glands.\r\nIn some cases tumors develop from the root of the nose, forming what\r\nappears to be a second nose. In other cases monstrous vegetations\r\ndivide the nose into many tumors. In the early portion of this century\r\nmuch was heard about a man who was a daily habitue of the Palais-Royal\r\nGardens. His nose was divided into unequally sized tumors, covering\r\nnearly his entire face. Similar instances have been observed in recent\r\nyears. Hey mentions a case in which the tumor extended to the lower\r\npart of the under lip, which compressed the patient's mouth and\r\nnostrils to such an extent that while sleeping, in order to insure\r\nsufficient respiration, he had to insert a tin-tube into one of his\r\nnostrils. Imbert de Lannes is quoted as operating on a former Mayor of\r\nAngouleme. This gentleman's nose was divided into five lobes by\r\nsarcomatous tumors weighing two pounds, occupying the external surface\r\nof the face, adherent to the buccinator muscles to which they extended,\r\nand covering the chin. In the upright position the tumors sealed the\r\nnostrils and mouth, and the man had to bend his head before and after\r\nrespiration. In eating, this unfortunate: person had to lift his tumors\r\naway from his mouth, and during sleep the monstrous growths were\r\nsupported in a sling attached to his night cap. He presented such a\r\nhideous aspect that he was virtually ostracized from society The growth\r\nhad been in progress for twelve years, but during twenty-two months'\r\nconfinement in Revolutionary prisons the enlargement had been very\r\nrapid. Fournier says that the most beautiful result followed the\r\noperation which was considered quite hazardous.\r\n\r\nForeign bodies in the nose present phenomena as interesting as wounds\r\nof this organ. Among the living objects which have been found in the\r\nnose may be mentioned flies, maggots, worms, leeches, centipedes, and\r\neven lizards. Zacutus Lusitanus tells of a person who died in two days\r\nfrom the effects of a leech which was inadvertently introduced into the\r\nnasal fossa, and there is a somewhat similar case of a military\r\npharmacist, a member of the French army in Spain, who drank some water\r\nfrom a pitcher and exhibited, about a half hour afterward, a persistent\r\nhemorrhage from the nose. Emaciation progressively continued, although\r\nhis appetite was normal. Three doctors, called in consultation,\r\nprescribed bleeding, which, however, proved of no avail. Three weeks\r\nafterward he carried in his nostril a tampon of lint, wet with an\r\nastringent solution, and, on the next day, on blowing his nose, there\r\nfell from the right nostril a body which he recognized as a leech.\r\nHealey gives the history of four cases in which medicinal leeches were\r\nremoved from the mouth and posterior nares of persons who had, for some\r\ndays previously, been drinking turbid water. Sinclair mentions the\r\nremoval of a leech from the posterior nares.\r\n\r\nIn some regions, more particularly tropical ones, there are certain\r\nflies that crawl into the nostrils of the inhabitants and deposit eggs,\r\nin the cavities. The larvae develop and multiply with great rapidity,\r\nand sometimes gain admission into the frontal sinus, causing intense\r\ncephalalgia, and even death.\r\n\r\nDempster reports an instance of the lodgment of numerous live maggots\r\nwithin the cavity of the nose, causing sloughing of the palate and\r\nother complications. Nicholson mentions a case of ulceration and\r\nabscess of the nostrils and face from which maggots were discharged.\r\nJarvis gives the history of a strange and repeated hemorrhage from the\r\nnose and adjacent parts that was found to be due to maggots from the\r\nova of a fly, which had been deposited in the nose while the patient\r\nwas asleep. Tomlinson gives a case in which maggots traversed the\r\nEustachian tube, some being picked out of the nostrils, while others\r\nwere coughed up.  Packard records the accidental entrance of a\r\ncentipede into the nostril. There is an account of a native who was\r\nadmitted to the Madras General Hospital, saying that a small lizard had\r\ncrawled up his nose. The urine of these animals is very irritating,\r\nblistering any surface it touches. Despite vigorous treatment the\r\npatient died in consequence of the entrance of this little creature.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances among the older writers in which a pea has\r\nremained in the nose for such a length of time as to present evidences\r\nof sprouting. The Ephemerides renders an instance of this kind, and\r\nBreschet cites the history of a young boy, who, in 1718, introduced a\r\npea into his nostril; in three days it had swollen to such an extent as\r\nto fill the whole passage. It could not be extracted by an instrument,\r\nso tobacco snuff was used, which excited sneezing, and the pea was\r\nejected.\r\n\r\nVidal and the Ephemerides report several instances of tolerance of\r\nforeign bodies in the nasal cavities for from twenty to twenty-five\r\nyears. Wiesman, in 1893, reported a rhinolith, which was composed of a\r\ncherry-stone enveloped in chalk, that had been removed after a sojourn\r\nof sixty years, with intense ozena as a consequence of its lodgment.\r\nWaring mentions the case of a housemaid who carried a rhinolith, with a\r\ncherry-stone for a nucleus, which had been introduced twenty-seven\r\nyears before, and which for twenty-five years had caused no symptoms.\r\nGrove describes a necrosed inferior turbinated bone, to which was\r\nattached a coffee-grain which had been retained in the nostril for\r\ntwenty years., Hickman gives an instance of a steel ring which for\r\nthirteen and a half years had been impacted in the nasopharyngeal fossa\r\nof a child. It was detected by the rhinoscope and was removed. Parker\r\nspeaks of a gunbreech bolt which was removed from the nose after five\r\nyears' lodgment. Major mentions the removal of a foreign body from the\r\nnose seven years after its introduction.\r\n\r\nHoward removed a large thimble from the posterior nares, although it\r\nhad remained in its position for some time undetected. Eve reports a\r\ncase in which a thimble was impacted in the right posterior nares.\r\nGazdar speaks, of a case of persistent neuralgia of one-half of the\r\nface, caused by a foreign body in the nose.  The obstruction was\r\nremoved after seven years' lodgment and the neuralgia disappeared.\r\nMolinier has an observation on the extraction of a fragment of a\r\nknife-blade which had rested four years in the nasal fossae, where the\r\nblade had broken off during a quarrel.\r\n\r\nA peculiar habit, sometimes seen in nervous individuals, is that of\r\n\"swallowing the tongue.\" Cohen claims that in some cases of supposed\r\nlaryngeal spasm the tongue is swallowed, occluding the larynx, and\r\nsometimes with fatal consequences. There are possibly a half score of\r\ncases recorded, but this anomaly is very rare, and Major is possibly\r\nthe only one who has to a certainty demonstrated the fact by a\r\nlaryngoscopic examination. By the laryngoscope he was enabled to\r\nobserve a paroxysm in a woman, in which the tongue retracted and\r\nimpinged on the epiglottis, but quickly recovered its position. Pettit\r\nmentions suffocation from \"tongue swallowing,\" both with and without\r\nsection of the frenum.  Schobinger cites a similar instance, due to\r\nloosening of the frenum.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the foregoing phenomenon is the habit of \"tongue sucking.\"\r\nMorris mentions a young lady of fifteen who spontaneously dislocated\r\nher jaw, owing indirectly to this habit.  Morris says that from infancy\r\nthe patient was addicted to this habit, which was so audible as to be\r\nheard in all parts of the room. The continued action of the pterygoid\r\nmuscles had so preternaturally loosened the ligaments and muscular\r\nstructures supporting the joint as to render them unable to resist the\r\nviolent action of \"tongue sucking\" even during sleep.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the Tongue.--Hobbs describes a man of twenty-three who,\r\nwhile working, had a habit of protruding his tongue. One day he was hit\r\nunder the chin by the chain of a crane on a pier, his upper teeth\r\ninflicting a wound two inches deep, three inches from the tip, and\r\ndividing the entire structure of the tongue except the arteries. The\r\nedges of the wound were brought into apposition by sutures, and after\r\nthe removal of the latter perfect union and complete restoration of the\r\nsensation of taste ensued. Franck mentions regeneration of a severed\r\ntongue; and Van Wy has seen union of almost entirely severed parts of\r\nthe tongue. De Fuisseaux reports reunion of the tongue by suture after\r\nalmost complete transverse division.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a German soldier who, May 2, 1813, was wounded\r\nat the battle of Gross-Gorschen by a musket ball which penetrated the\r\nleft cheek, carrying away the last four molars of the upper jaw and\r\npassing through the tongue, making exit on the left side, and forcing\r\nout several teeth of the left lower jaw.  To his surprise, thirty years\r\nafterward, one of the teeth was removed from an abscess of the tongue.\r\nBaker speaks of a boy of thirteen who was shot at three yards distance.\r\nThe bullet knocked out two teeth and passed through the tongue,\r\nalthough it produced no wound of the pharynx, and was passed from the\r\nanus on the sixth day. Stevenson mentions a case of an organist who\r\nfell forward when stooping with a pipe in his mouth, driving its stem\r\ninto the roof of the pharynx. He complained of a sore throat for\r\nseveral days, and, after explanation, Stevenson removed from the soft\r\npalate a piece of clay pipe nearly 1 1/4 inches long.  Herbert tells of\r\na case resembling carcinoma of the tongue, which was really due to the\r\nlodgment of a piece of tooth in that organ.\r\n\r\nArticulation Without the Tongue.--Total or partial destruction of the\r\ntongue does not necessarily make articulation impossible.  Banon\r\nmentions a man who had nothing in his mouth representing a tongue. When\r\nhe was young, he was attacked by an ulceration destroying every vestige\r\nof this member. The epiglottis, larynx, and pharynx, in fact the\r\nsurrounding structures were normal, and articulation, which was at\r\nfirst lost, became fairly distinct, and deglutition was never\r\ninterfered with. Pare gives a description of a man whose tongue was\r\ncompletely severed, in consequence of which he lost speech for three\r\nyears, but was afterward able to make himself understood by an\r\ningenious bit of mechanism. He inserted under the stump of the tongue a\r\nsmall piece of wood, in a most marvelous way replacing the missing\r\nmember. Articulation with the absence of some constituent of the vocal\r\napparatus has been spoken of on page 254.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the Tongue.--It sometimes happens that the tongue is so\r\nlarge that it is rendered not only useless but a decided hindrance to\r\nthe performance of the ordinary functions into which it always enters.\r\nEhrlich, Ficker, Klein, Rodforffer, and the Ephemerides, all record\r\ninstances in which a large tongue was removed either by ligation or\r\namputation. Von Siebold records an instance in which death was caused\r\nby the ligature of an abnormally sized tongue. There is a modern record\r\nof three cases of enormous tongues, the result of simple hypertrophy.\r\nIn one case the tongue measured 6 1/4 inches from the angle of the\r\nmouth about the sides and tip to the opposite angle, necessitating\r\namputation of the protruding portion.\r\n\r\nCarnochan reports a case in which hypertrophy of the tongue was reduced\r\nto nearly the normal size by first tying the external carotid, and six\r\nweeks later the common carotid artery. Chalk mentions partial\r\ndislocation of the lower jaw from an enlarged tongue. Lyford speaks of\r\nenlargement of the tongue causing death.\r\n\r\nThe above conditions are known as macroglossia, which is a congenital\r\nhypertrophy of the tongue analogous to elephantiasis.  It is of slow\r\ngrowth, and as the organ enlarges it interferes with deglutition and\r\nspeech. It may protrude over the chin and reach even as far down as the\r\nsternum.\r\n\r\nThe great enlargement may cause deformities of the teeth and lower jaw,\r\nand even present itself as an enormous tumor in the neck. The\r\nprotruding tongue itself may ulcerate, possibly bleed, and there is\r\nconstant dribbling of saliva. The disease is probably due to congenital\r\ndefect aggravated by frequent attacks of glossitis, and the treatment\r\nconsists in the removal of the protruding portions by the knife,\r\nligation, the cautery, or ecraseur.\r\n\r\nLiving Fish in the Pharynx.--Probably the most interesting cases of\r\nforeign bodies are those in which living fish enter the pharynx and\r\nesophagus. Chevers has collected five cases in which death was caused\r\nby living fish entering the mouth and occluding the air-passages. He\r\nhas mentioned a case in which a large catfish jumped into the mouth of\r\na Madras bheestie. An operation on the esophagus was immediately\r\ncommenced, but abandoned, and an attempt made to push the fish down\r\nwith a probang, which was, in a measure, successful. However, the\r\npatient gave a convulsive struggle, and, to all appearances, died. The\r\ntrachea was immediately opened, and respiration was restored. During\r\nthe course of the night the man vomited up pieces of fish bone softened\r\nby decomposition. In 1863 White mentions that the foregoing accident is\r\nnot uncommon among the natives of India, who are in the habit of\r\nswimming with their mouths open in tanks abounding with fish. There is\r\na case in which a fisherman, having both hands engaged in drawing a\r\nnet, and seeing a sole-fish about eight inches long trying to escape\r\nthrough the meshes of the net, seized it with his teeth. A sudden\r\nconvulsive effort of the fish enabled it to enter the fisherman's\r\nthroat, and he was asphyxiated before his boat reached the shore. After\r\ndeath the fish was found in the cardiac end of the stomach. There is\r\nanother case of a man named Durand, who held a mullet between his teeth\r\nwhile rebaiting his hook. The fish, in the convulsive struggles of\r\ndeath, slipped down the throat, and because of the arrangement of its\r\nscales it could be pushed down but not up; asphyxiation, however,\r\nensued. Stewart has extensively described the case of a native\r\n\"Puckally\" of Ceylon who was the victim of the most distressing\r\nsymptoms from the impaction of a living fish in his throat. The native\r\nhad caught the fish, and in order to extract it placed its head between\r\nhis teeth, holding the body with the left hand and the hook with the\r\nright. He had hardly extracted the hook, when the fish pricked his palm\r\nwith his long and sharp dorsal fin, causing him suddenly to release his\r\ngrasp on the fish and voluntarily open his mouth at the same time. The\r\nfish quickly bolted into his mouth, and, although he grasped the tail\r\nwith his right hand, and squeezed his pharynx with his left, besides\r\ncoughing violently, the fish found its way into the esophagus. Further\r\nattempts at extraction were dangerous and quite likely to fail; his\r\nsymptoms were distressing, he could not hold his head erect without the\r\nmost agonizing pain and he was almost prostrated from fright and\r\nasphyxia; it was thought advisable to push the fish into the stomach,\r\nand after an impaction of sixteen hours the symptoms were relieved. The\r\nfish in this instance was the Anabas scandens or \"walking perch\" of\r\nCeylon, which derives its name from its power of locomotion on land and\r\nits ability to live out of water for some time. It is from four to five\r\ninches long and has a dorsal fin as sharp as a knife and directed\r\ntoward the tail, and pectoral fins following the same direction; these\r\nwould admit of entrance, but would interfere with extraction. MacLauren\r\nreports the history of a young man who, after catching a fish, placed\r\nit between his teeth. The fish, three inches long, by a sudden\r\nmovement, entered the pharynx. Immediately ensued suffocation, nausea,\r\nvomiting, together with the expectoration of blood and mucus. There was\r\nemphysema of the face, neck, and chest. The fish could be easily felt\r\nimpacted in the tissues, but, after swallowing much water and vinegar,\r\ntogether with other efforts at extraction, the fins were\r\nloosened--about twenty-four hours after the accident. By this time the\r\nemphysema had extended to the scrotum. There was much expectoration of\r\nmuco-purulent fluid, and on the third day complete aphonia, but the\r\nsymptoms gradually disappeared, and recovery was complete in eight\r\ndays. Dantra is accredited with describing asphyxiation, accompanied by\r\ngreat agony, in a man who, while swimming, had partially swallowed a\r\nlive fish. The fish was about three inches in length and one in\r\nbreadth, and was found lying on the dorsum of his tongue and, together\r\nwith numerous clots of blood, filled his mouth. Futile attempts to\r\nextract the fish by forceps were made. Examination showed that the fish\r\nhad firmly grasped the patient's uvula, which it was induced to\r\nrelinquish when its head was seized by the forceps and pressed from\r\nside to side. After this it was easily extracted and lived for some\r\ntime. There was little hemorrhage after the removal of the offending\r\nobject, and the blood had evidently come from the injuries to the sides\r\nof the mouth, caused by the fins.  The uvula was bitten, not torn.\r\nThere is an interesting account of a native of India, who, while\r\nfishing in a stream, caught a flat eel-like fish from fifteen to\r\nsixteen inches long. After the fashion of his fellows he attempted to\r\nkill the eel by biting off its head; in the attempt the fish slipped\r\ninto his gullet, and owing to its sharp fins could not be withdrawn.\r\nThe man died one hour later in the greatest agony; so firmly was the\r\neel impacted that even after death it could not be extracted, and the\r\nman was buried with it protruding from his mouth.\r\n\r\nA Leech in the Pharynx.--Granger, a surgeon in Her Majesty's Indian\r\nService, writes:--\"Several days ago I received a note from the\r\npolitical sirdar, asking me if I would see a man who said he had a\r\nleech in his throat which he was unable to get rid of. I was somewhat\r\nsceptical, and thought that possibly the man might be laboring under a\r\ndelusion. On going outside the fort to see the case, I found an old\r\nPathan graybeard waiting for me. On seeing me, he at once spat out a\r\nlarge quantity of dark, half-clotted blood to assure me of the serious\r\nnature of his complaint. His history--mostly made out with the aid of\r\ninterpreters--was that eleven days ago he was drinking from a\r\nrain-water tank and felt something stick in his throat, which he could\r\nnot reject. He felt this thing moving, and it caused difficulty in\r\nswallowing, and occasionally vomiting. On the following day he began to\r\nspit up blood, and this continued until he saw me. He stated that he\r\nonce vomited blood, and that he frequently felt that he was going to\r\nchoke.\r\n\r\n\"On examining his throat, a large clot of blood was found to be\r\nadherent to the posterior wall of the pharynx. On removing this clot of\r\nblood, no signs of the presence of a leech could be detected. However,\r\non account of the symptoms complained of by the patient I introduced a\r\npolypus forceps into the lower part of the pharynx and toward the\r\nesophagus, where a body, distinctly moving, was felt. This body I\r\nseized with the forceps, and with considerable force managed to remove\r\nit. It was a leech between 2 1/2 and three inches in length, and with a\r\nbody of the size of a Lee-Metford bullet. No doubt during the eleven\r\ndays it had remained in the man's throat the leech had increased in\r\nsize.  Nevertheless it must have been an animal of considerable size\r\nwhen the man attempted to swallow it. I send this case as a typical\r\nexample of the carelessness of natives of the class from which we\r\nenlist our Sepoys, as to the nature of the water they drink. This man\r\nhad drunk the pea-soup like water of a tank dug in the side of the\r\nhill, rather than go a few hundred yards to a spring where the water is\r\nperfectly clear and pure. Though I have not met with another case of\r\nleeches being taken with drinking water, I am assured that such cases\r\nare occasionally met with about Agra and other towns in the North-West\r\nProvinces. This great carelessness as to the purity or impurity of\r\ntheir drinking water shows the difficulty medical officers must\r\nexperience in their endeavors to prevent the Sepoys of a regiment from\r\ndrinking water from condemned or doubtful sources during a cholera or\r\ntyphoid epidemic.\"\r\n\r\nForeign Bodies in the Pharynx and Esophagus.--Aylesbury mentions a boy\r\nwho swallowed a fish-hook while eating gooseberries. He tried to pull\r\nit up, but it was firmly fastened, and a surgeon was called. By\r\ningeniously passing a leaden bullet along the line, the weight of the\r\nlead loosened the hook, and both bullet and hook were easily drawn up.\r\nBabbit and Battle report an ingenious method of removing a piece of\r\nmeat occluding the esophagus--the application of trypsin. Henry speaks\r\nof a German officer who accidentally swallowed a piece of beer bottle,\r\n3/8 x 1/8 inch, which subsequently penetrated the esophagus, and in its\r\ncourse irritated the recurrent laryngeal and vagi, giving rise to the\r\nmost serious phlegmonous inflammation and distressing respiratory\r\nsymptoms. A peculiar case is that of the man who died after a fire at\r\nthe Eddystone Lighthouse. He was endeavoring to extinguish the flames\r\nwhich were at a considerable distance above his head, and was looking\r\nup with his mouth open, when the lead of a melting lantern dropped down\r\nin such quantities as not only to cover his face and enter his mouth,\r\nbut run over his clothes.  The esophagus and tunica in the lower part\r\nof the stomach were burned, and a great piece of lead, weighing over 7\r\n1/2 ounces, was taken from the stomach after death.\r\n\r\nEvans relates the history of a girl of twenty-one who swallowed four\r\nartificial teeth, together with their gold plate; two years and eight\r\ndays afterward she ejected them after a violent attack of retching.\r\nGauthier speaks of a young girl who, while eating soup, swallowed a\r\nfragment of bone. For a long time she had symptoms simulating phthisis,\r\nbut fourteen years afterward the bone was dislodged, and, although the\r\nyoung woman was considered in the last stages of phthisis, she\r\ncompletely recovered in six weeks. Gastellier has reported the case of\r\na young man of sixteen who swallowed a crown piece, which became lodged\r\nin the middle portion of the esophagus and could not be removed. For\r\nten months the piece of money remained in this position, during which\r\nthe young man was never without acute pain and often had convulsions.\r\nHe vomited material, sometimes alimentary, sometimes mucus, pus, or\r\nblood, and went into the last stage of marasmus. At last, after this\r\nlong-continued suffering, following a strong convulsion and syncope,\r\nthe coin descended to the stomach, and the young man expectorated great\r\nquantities of pus. After thirty-five years, the coin had not been\r\npassed by the rectum.\r\n\r\nInstances of migration of foreign bodies from the esophagus are\r\nrepeatedly recorded. There is an instance of a needle which was\r\nswallowed and lodged in the esophagus, but twenty-one months afterward\r\nwas extracted by an incision at a point behind the right ear. Kerckring\r\nspeaks of a girl who swallowed a needle which was ultimately extracted\r\nfrom the muscles of her neck.  Poulet remarks that Vigla has collected\r\nthe most interesting of these cases of migration of foreign bodies.\r\nHevin mentions several cases of grains of wheat abstracted from\r\nabscesses of the thoracic parietes, from thirteen to fifteen days after\r\ningestion.  Bonnet and Helmontius have reported similar facts.\r\nVolgnarius has seen a grain of wheat make its exit from the axilla, and\r\nPolisius mentions an abscess of the back from which was extracted a\r\ngrain of wheat three months after ingestion. Bally reports a somewhat\r\nsimilar instance, in which, three months after ingestion, during an\r\nattack of peripneumonia, a foreign body was extracted from an abscess\r\nof the thorax, between the 2d and 3d ribs. Ambrose found a needle\r\nencysted in the heart of a negress. She distinctly stated that she had\r\nswallowed it at a time calculated to have been nine years before her\r\ndeath. Planque speaks of a small bone perforating the esophagus and\r\nextracted through the skin.\r\n\r\nAbscess or ulceration, consequent upon periesophagitis, caused by the\r\nlodgment of foreign bodies in the esophagus, often leads to the most\r\nserious results. There is an instance of a soldier who swallowed a bone\r\nwhile eating soup, who died on the thirty-first day from the rupture\r\ninternally of an esophageal abscess.  Grellois has reported the history\r\nof a case of a child twenty-two months old, who suffered for some time\r\nwith impaction of a small bone in the esophagus. Less than three months\r\nafterward the patient died with all the symptoms of marasmus, due to\r\ndifficult deglutition, and at the autopsy an abscess was seen in the\r\nposterior wall of the pharynx, opposite the 3d cervical vertebra;\r\nextensive caries was also noticed in the bodies of the 2d, 3d, and 4th\r\ncervical vertebrae. Guattani mentions a curious instance in which a man\r\nplaying with a chestnut threw it in the air, catching it in his mouth.\r\nThe chestnut became lodged in the throat and caused death on the\r\nnineteenth day. At the autopsy it was found that an abscess\r\ncommunicating with the trachea had been formed in the pharynx and\r\nesophagus.\r\n\r\nA peculiarly fatal accident in this connection is that in which a\r\nforeign body in the esophagus ulcerates, and penetrates one of the\r\nneighboring major vessels. Colles mentions a man of fifty-six who,\r\nwhile eating, perceived a sensation as of a rent in the chest. The pain\r\nwas augmented during deglutition, and almost immediately afterward he\r\ncommenced to expectorate great quantities of blood. On the following\r\nday he vomited a bone about an inch long and died on the same day. At\r\nthe autopsy it was found that there was a rent in the posterior wall of\r\nthe esophagus, about 1/2 inch long, and a corresponding wound of the\r\naorta. There was blood in the pleura, pericardium, stomach, and\r\nintestines. There is one case in which a man of forty-seven suddenly\r\ndied, after vomiting blood, and at the autopsy it was demonstrated that\r\na needle had perforated the posterior wall of the esophagus and wounded\r\nthe aorta. Poulet has collected 31 cases in which ulceration caused by\r\nforeign bodies in the esophagus has resulted in perforation of the\r\nwalls of some of the neighboring vessels. The order of frequency was as\r\nfollows: aorta, 17; carotids, four; vena cava, two; and one case each\r\nof perforation of the inferior thyroid artery, right coronary vein,\r\ndemi-azygos vein, the right subclavicular artery (abnormal), and the\r\nesophageal artery. In three of the cases collected there was no autopsy\r\nand the vessel affected was not known.\r\n\r\nIn a child of three years that had swallowed a half-penny, Atkins\r\nreports rupture of the innominate artery. No symptoms developed, but\r\nsix weeks later, the child had an attack of ulcerative stomatitis, from\r\nwhich it seemed to be recovering nicely, when suddenly it ejected two\r\nounces of bright red blood in clots, and became collapsed out of\r\nproportion to the loss of blood. Under treatment, it rallied somewhat,\r\nbut soon afterward it ejected four ounces more of blood and died in a\r\nfew minutes. At the autopsy 3/4 pint of blood was found in the stomach,\r\nand a perforation was discovered on the right side of the esophagus,\r\nleading into a cavity, in which a blackened half-penny was found.  A\r\nprobe passed along the aorta into the innominate protruded into the\r\nsame cavity about the bifurcation of the vessel.\r\n\r\nDenonvilliers has described a perforation of the esophagus and aorta by\r\na five-franc piece. A preserved preparation of this case, showing the\r\ncoin in situ, is in the Musee Dupuytren.  Blaxland relates the instance\r\nof a woman of forty-five who swallowed a fish bone, was seized with\r\nviolent hematemesis, and died in eight hours. The necropsy revealed a\r\npenetration of the aorta through the thoracic portion of the esophagus.\r\nThere is also in the Musee Dupuytren a preparation described by\r\nBousquet, in which the aorta and the esophagus were perforated by a\r\nvery irregular piece of bone. Mackenzie mentions an instance of death\r\nfrom perforation of the aorta by a fish-bone.\r\n\r\nIn some cases penetration of the esophagus allows the further\r\npenetration of some neighboring membrane or organ in the same manner as\r\nthe foregoing cases. Dudley mentions a case in which fatal hemorrhage\r\nwas caused by penetration of the esophagus and lung by a chicken-bone.\r\nBuist speaks of a patient who swallowed two artificial teeth. On the\r\nfollowing day there was pain in the epigastrium, and by the fourth day\r\nthe pain extended to the vertebrae, with vomiting, delirium, and death\r\non the fifth day.  At the autopsy it was found that a foreign body,\r\nseven cm. long had perforated the pericardium, causing a suppurative\r\npericarditis. Dagron reports a unique instance of death by purulent\r\ninfection arising from perforation of the esophagus by a pin. The\r\npatient was a man of forty-two, and, some six weeks before he presented\r\nhimself for treatment, before swallowing had experienced a severe pain\r\nlow down in the neck. Five days before admission he had had a severe\r\nchill, followed by sweating and delirium. He died of a supraclavicular\r\nabscess on the fifth day; a black steel pin was found against the\r\nesophagus and trachea.\r\n\r\nIn connection with foreign bodies in the esophagus, it might be\r\ninteresting to remark that Ashhurst has collected 129 cases of\r\nesophagotomy for the removal of foreign bodies, resulting in 95\r\nrecoveries and 34 deaths. Gaudolphe collected 142 cases with 110\r\nrecoveries.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the neck are usually inflicted with suicidal intent or in\r\nbattle. Cornelius Nepos says that while fighting against the\r\nLacedemonians, Epaminondas was sensible of having received a mortal\r\nwound, and apprehending that the lance was stopping a wound in an\r\nimportant vessel, remarked that he would die when it was withdrawn.\r\nWhen he was told that the Boeotians had conquered, exclaiming \"I die\r\nunconquered,\" he drew out the lance and perished. Petrus de Largenta\r\nspeaks of a man with an arrow in one of his carotids, who was but\r\nslightly affected before its extraction, but who died immediately after\r\nthe removal of the arrow. Among the remarkable recoveries from injuries\r\nof the neck is that mentioned by Boerhaave, of a young man who lived\r\nnine or ten days after receiving a sword-thrust through the neck\r\nbetween the 4th and 5th vertebrae, dividing the vertebral artery.\r\nBenedictus, Bonacursius, and Monroe, all mention recovery after cases\r\nof cut-throat in which the esophagus as well as the trachea was\r\nwounded, and food protruded from the external cut. Warren relates the\r\nhistory of a case in which the vertebral artery was wounded by the\r\ndischarge of a pistol loaded with pebbles. The hemorrhage was checked\r\nby compression and packing, and after the discharge of a pebble and a\r\npiece of bone from the wound, the man was seen a month afterward in\r\nperfect health. Corson of Norristown, Pa., has reported the case of a\r\nquarryman who was stabbed in the neck with a shoemaker's knife,\r\nsevering the left carotid one inch below its division. He was seen\r\nthirty minutes later in an apparently lifeless condition, but efforts\r\nat resuscitation were successfully made. The hemorrhage ceased\r\nspontaneously, and at the time of report, the man presented the\r\nsymptoms of one who had had his carotid ligated (facial atrophy on one\r\nside, no pulse, etc.). Baron Larrey mentions a case of gunshot wound in\r\nwhich the carotid artery was open at its division into internal and\r\nexternal branches, and says that the wound was plugged by an\r\nartilleryman until ligation, and in this primitive manner the patient\r\nwas saved. Sale reports the case of a girl of nineteen, who fell on a\r\nchina bowl that she had shattered, and wounded both the right common\r\ncarotid artery and internal jugular vein. There was profuse and\r\ncontinuous hemorrhage for a time, and subsequently a false aneurysm\r\ndeveloped, which ruptured in about three months, giving rise to\r\nenormous momentary hemorrhage; notwithstanding the severity of the\r\ninjury and the extent of the hemorrhage, complete recovery ensued. Amos\r\nrelates the instance of a woman named Mary Green who, after complete\r\ndivision of all the vessels of the neck, walked 23 yards and climbed\r\nover an ordinary bar-gate nearly four feet high.\r\n\r\nCholmeley reports the instance of a Captain of the First Madras\r\nFusileers, who was wounded at Pegu by a musket-ball penetrating his\r\nneck. The common carotid was divided and for five minutes there was\r\nprofuse hemorrhage which, however, strange to say, spontaneously\r\nceased. The patient died in thirty-eight hours, supposedly from spinal\r\nconcussion or shock.\r\n\r\nRelative to ligature of the common carotid artery, Ashhurst mentions\r\nthe fact that the artery has been ligated in 228 instances, with 94\r\nrecoveries. Ellis mentions ligature of both carotids in four and a half\r\ndays, as a treatment for a gunshot wound, with subsequent recovery.\r\nLewtas reports a case of ligation of the innominate and carotid\r\narteries for traumatic aneurysm (likely a hematoma due to a gunshot\r\ninjury of the subclavian artery). The patient was in profound collapse,\r\nbut steadily reacted and was discharged cured on the forty-fifth day,\r\nwith no perceptible pulse at the wrist and only a feeble beat in the\r\npulmonary artery.\r\n\r\nGarengeot, Wirth, Fine, and Evers, all mention perforating wounds of\r\nthe trachea and esophagus with recoveries. Van Swieten and Hiester\r\nmention cases in which part of the trachea was carried away by a ball,\r\nwith recovery. Monro, Tulpius, Bartholinus, and Pare report severance\r\nof the trachea with the absence of oral breathing, in which the divided\r\nportions were sutured, with successful results. In his \"Theatro\r\nNaturae,\" Bodinus says that William, Prince of Orange, lost the sense\r\nof taste after receiving a wound of the larynx; according to an old\r\nauthority, a French soldier became mute after a similar accident.\r\nDavies-Colley mentions a boy of eighteen who fell on a stick about the\r\nthickness of the index finger, transfixing his neck from right to left;\r\nhe walked to a doctor's house, 250 yards away, with the stick in situ.\r\nIn about two weeks he was discharged completely well. During treatment\r\nhe had no hemorrhage of any importance, and his voice was not affected,\r\nbut for a while he had slight dysphagia.\r\n\r\nBarker gives a full account of a barber who was admitted to a hospital\r\ntwo and a half hours after cutting his throat. He had a deep wound\r\nrunning transversely across the neck, from one angle of the jaw to the\r\nother, cutting open the floor of the mouth and extending from the inner\r\nborder of the sternocleido-mastoid to the other, leaving the large\r\nvessels of the neck untouched. The razor had passed through the\r\nglosso-epiglottidean fold, a tip of the epiglottis, and through the\r\npharynx down to the spinal column. There was little hemorrhage, but the\r\nman could neither swallow nor speak. The wound was sutured, tracheotomy\r\ndone, and the head kept fixed on the chest by a copper splint. He was\r\ningeniously fed by esophageal tubes and rectal enemata; in three weeks\r\nspeech and deglutition were restored. Shortly afterward the esophageal\r\ntube was removed and recovery was virtually complete.  Little mentions\r\nan extraordinary case of a woman of thirty-six who was discharged from\r\nGarland's asylum, where she had been an inmate for three months. This\r\nunfortunate woman had attempted suicide by self-decapitation from\r\nbehind forward. She was found, knife in hand, with a huge wound in the\r\nback of the neck and her head bobbing about in a ghastly manner. The\r\nincision had severed the skin, subcutaneous tissues and muscles, the\r\nligaments and bone, opening the spinal canal, but not cutting the cord.\r\nThe instrument used to effect this major injury was a blunt\r\npotato-peeling knife. Despite this terrible wound the patient lived to\r\nthe sixth day.\r\n\r\nHislop records a case of cut-throat in a man of seventy-four. He had a\r\nhuge gaping wound of the neck, extending to within a half inch of the\r\ncarotids on each side. The trachea was almost completely severed, the\r\nband left was not more than 1/4 inch wide. Hislop tied four arteries,\r\nbrought the ends of the trachea together with four strong silk sutures,\r\nand, as the operation was in the country, he washed the big cavity of\r\nthe wound out with cold spring-water. He brought the superficial\r\nsurfaces together with ten interrupted sutures, and, notwithstanding\r\nthe patient's age, the man speedily recovered. This emphasizes the fact\r\nthat the old theory of leaving wounds of this nature open was\r\nerroneous. Solly reports the case of a tailor of twenty-two who\r\nattempted suicide by cutting through the larynx, entirely severing the\r\nepiglottis and three-fourths of the pharynx. No bleeding point was\r\nfound, and recovery ensued.\r\n\r\nCowles describes the case of a soldier of thirty-five who, while\r\nescaping from the patrols, was shot by the Officer of the Day with a\r\nsmall bullet from a pistol. The ball entered the right shoulder,\r\nimmediately over the suprascapular notch, passed superficially upward\r\nand forward into the neck, wounding the esophagus posteriorly at a\r\npoint opposite the thyroid cartilage, and lodged in the left side of\r\nthe neck. The patient had little hemorrhage, but had expectorated and\r\nswallowed much blood. He had a constant desire to swallow, which\r\ncontinued several days. The treatment was expectant; and in less than\r\nthree weeks the soldier was returned to duty. From the same authority\r\nthere is a condensation of five reports of gunshot wounds of the neck,\r\nfrom all of which the patients recovered and returned to duty.\r\n\r\nBraman describes the case of a man on whom several injuries were\r\ninflicted by a drunken companion. The first wound was slight; the\r\nsecond a deep flesh-wound over the trapezius muscle; the third extended\r\nfrom the right sterno-cleido-mastoid midway upward to the middle of the\r\njaw and down to the rapine of the trachea. The external jugular, the\r\nexternal thyroid, and the facial arteries were severed. Braman did not\r\nfind it necessary to ligate, but was able to check the hemorrhage with\r\nlint and persulphate of iron, in powder, with pressure. After fourteen\r\nhours the wound was closed; the patient recovered, and was returned to\r\nduty in a short time.\r\n\r\nThomas has reported the case of a man sixty-five years old who in an\r\nattempt at suicide with a penknife, had made a deep wound in the left\r\nside of the neck. The sternohyoid and omohyoid muscles were divided;\r\nthe internal jugular vein was cut through, and its cut ends were\r\ncollapsed and 3/4 inch apart; the common carotid artery was cut into,\r\nbut not divided; the thyroid cartilage was notched, and the external\r\nand anterior jugular veins were severed. Clamp-forceps were immediately\r\napplied to the cut vessels and one on each side the aperture in the\r\ncommon carotid from which a small spurt of blood, certainly not half a\r\nteaspoonful, came out. The left median basilic vein was exposed by an\r\nincision, and 20 ounces of warm saline solution were slowly perfused,\r\nan ordinary glass syringe with a capacity of five ounces, with an\r\nIndia-rubber tubing attached to a canula in the vein being employed.\r\nAfter seven ounces of fluid had been injected, the man made a short,\r\ndistinct inspiration; at ten ounces a deeper one (the radial pulse\r\ncould now be felt beating feebly); at 15 ounces the breathing became\r\nregular and deep; at 18 ounces the man opened his eyes, but did not\r\nappear to be conscious. The clamped vessels were now tied with catgut\r\nand the wound cleansed with phenol lotion and dressed with\r\ncyanid-gauze.  The man was surrounded by hot-water bottles and the foot\r\nof the bed elevated 18 inches. In the course of an hour the patient had\r\nrecovered sufficiently to answer in a squeaky voice to his name when\r\ncalled loudly. Improvement proceeded rapidly until the twenty-second\r\nday, when violent hemorrhage occurred, preceded a few hours previously\r\nby a small trickle, easily controlled by pressure. The wound was at\r\nonce opened and blood found oozing from the distal extremities of the\r\ncarotid artery and jugular vein, which were promptly clamped. The\r\ncommon carotid artery was not sound, so that ligatures were applied to\r\nthe internal and external carotids and to the internal jugular with a\r\nsmall branch entering into it. The patient was in great collapse, but\r\nquickly rallied, only to suffer renewed hemorrhage from the internal\r\ncarotid nine days later. This was controlled by pressure with sponges,\r\nand a quart of hot water was injected into the rectum.  From this time\r\non the patient made a slow recovery, a small sinus in the lower part of\r\nthe neck disappearing on the removal of the catgut ligature.\r\n\r\nAdams describes the case of a woman who attempted suicide with a common\r\ntable-knife, severing the thyroid, cricoid, and first three rings of\r\nthe trachea, and lacerating the sternohyoid and thyroid arteries; she\r\nfinally recovered.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious case of suicide of a woman who, while under the\r\neffects of opium, forced the handle of a mirror into her mouth. From\r\nall appearances, the handle had broken off near the junction and she\r\nhad evidently fallen forward with the remaining part in her mouth,\r\ndriving it forcibly against the spine, and causing the point of the\r\nhandle to run downward in front of the cervical vertebrae. On\r\npostmortem examination, a sharp piece of wood about two inches long,\r\ncorresponding to the missing portion of the broken mirror handle, was\r\nfound lying between the posterior wall of the esophagus and the spine.\r\nHennig mentions a case of gunshot wound of the neck in which the musket\r\nball was lodged in the posterior portion of the neck and was\r\nsubsequently discharged by the anus.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the cervical vertebrae, while extremely grave, and declared\r\nby some authors to be inevitably fatal, are, however, not always\r\nfollowed by death or permanently bad results. Barwell mentions a man of\r\nsixty-three who, in a fit of despondency, threw himself from a window,\r\nhaving fastened a rope to his neck and to the window-sill. He fell 11\r\nor 12 feet, and in doing so suffered a subluxation of the 4th cervical\r\nvertebra. It slowly resumed the normal position by the elasticity of\r\nthe intervertebral fibrocartilage, and there was complete recovery in\r\nten days.  Lazzaretto reports the history of the case of a seaman whose\r\natlas was dislocated by a blow from a falling sail-yard. The\r\ndislocation was reduced and held by adhesive strips, and the man made a\r\ngood recovery. Vanderpool of Bellevue Hospital, N.Y., describes a\r\nfracture of the odontoid process caused by a fall on the back of the\r\nhead; death, however, did not ensue until six months later. According\r\nto Ashhurst, Philips, the elder Cline, Willard Parker, Bayard, Stephen\r\nSmith, May, and several other surgeons, have recorded complete recovery\r\nafter fracture of the atlas and axis. The same author also adds that\r\nstatistic investigation shows that as large a proportion as 18 per cent\r\nof injuries of the cervical vertebrae occurring in civil practice,\r\nrecover. However, the chances of a fatal issue in injuries of the\r\nvertebrae vary inversely with the distance of the point of injury from\r\nthe brain. Keen has recorded a case in which a conoidal ball lodged in\r\nthe body of the third cervical vertebra, from which it was extracted\r\nsix weeks later. The paralysis, which, up to the time of extraction,\r\nhad affected all four limbs, rapidly diminished. In about five weeks\r\nafter the removal of the bullet nearly the entire body of the 3d\r\ncervical vertebra, including the anterior half of the transverse\r\nprocess and vertebral foremen, was spontaneously discharged. Nearly\r\neight years afterward Keen saw the man still living, but with his right\r\nshoulder and arm diminished in size and partly paralyzed.\r\n\r\nDoyle reports a case of dislocated neck with recovery. During a runaway\r\nthe patient was thrown from his wagon, and was soon after found on the\r\nroadside apparently dead. Physicians who were quickly summoned from the\r\nimmediate neighborhood detected faint signs of life; they also found a\r\ndeformity of the neck, which led them to suspect dislocation. An\r\nambulance was called, and without any effort being made to relieve the\r\ndeformity the man was placed in it and driven to his home about a mile\r\ndistant. The jolting over the rough roads greatly aggravated his\r\ncondition. When Doyle saw the patient, his general appearance presented\r\na hopeless condition, but being satisfied that a dislocation existed,\r\nDoyle immediately prepared to reduce it. Two men were told to grasp the\r\nfeet and two more the head, and were directed to make careful but\r\nstrong extension. At the same time the physician placed his right hand\r\nagainst the neck just over the pomum Adami, and his left against the\r\nocciput, and, while extension was being made, he flexed the head\r\nforward until the chin nearly touched the breast, after which the head\r\nwas returned to its normal position. The manipulation was accompanied\r\nby a clicking sensation, caused by the replacement of the dislocated\r\nvertebra. The patient immediately showed signs of relief and improved\r\nrapidly.  Perceptible but feeble movements were made by all the limbs\r\nexcept the right arm. The patient remained in a comatose condition for\r\neight or nine days, during which he had enuresis and intestinal torpor.\r\nHe suffered from severe concussion of the brain, which accounted for\r\nhis prolonged coma. Delirium was present, but he was carefully watched\r\nand not allowed to injure himself. His recovery was tedious and was\r\ndelayed by several relapses. His first complaint after consciousness\r\nreturned (on the tenth day) was of a sense of constriction about the\r\nneck, us if he were being choked. This gradually passed off, and his\r\nimprovement went on without development of any serious symptoms.  At\r\nthe time of report he appeared in the best of health and was quite able\r\nto attend to his daily avocations. Doyle appends to his report the\r\nstatement that among 394 cases embraced in Ashhurst's statistics, in\r\ntreatment of dislocations in the cervical region, the mortality has\r\nbeen nearly four times greater when constitutional or general treatment\r\nhas been relied on exclusively than when attempts had been made to\r\nreduce the dislocation by extension, rotation, etc. Doyle strongly\r\nadvocates attempts at reduction in such cases.\r\n\r\nFigure 205 represents a photograph of Barney Baldwin, a switchman of\r\nthe Louisville and Nashville Railroad, who, after recovery from\r\ncervical dislocation, exhibited himself about the country, never\r\nappearing without his suspensory apparatus.\r\n\r\nAcheson records a case of luxation of the cervical spine with recovery\r\nafter the use of a jury-mast. The patient was a man of fifty-five, by\r\ntrade a train-conductor. On July 10, 1889, he fell backward in front of\r\na train, his head striking between the ties; the brake-body caught his\r\nbody, pushing it forward on his head, and turned him completely over.\r\nThree trucks passed over him.  When dragged from beneath the train, his\r\nupper extremities were paralyzed. At noon the next day, nineteen hours\r\nafter the accident, examination revealed bruises over the body, and he\r\nsuffered intense pain at the back of the neck and base of the skull.\r\nPosteriorly, the neck presented a natural appearance; but anteriorly,\r\nto use the author's description, his neck resembled a combined case of\r\nmumps and goiter. The sternomastoid muscle bulged at the angle of the\r\njaw, and was flaccid, and his \"Adam's apple\" was on a level with the\r\nchin. Sensation in the upper extremities was partially restored, and,\r\nalthough numb, he now had power of movement in the arms and hands, but\r\ncould not rotate his neck. A diagnosis of cervical dislocation was\r\nmade, and violent extension, with oscillation forward and backward, was\r\npracticed, and the abnormal appearance subsided at once. No crepitus\r\nwas noticed. On the fourth day there was slight hemorrhage from the\r\nmouth, which was more severe on the fifth and sixth days. The lower jaw\r\nhad been forced past the upper, until the first molar had penetrated\r\nthe tissues beneath the tongue. A plaster-of-Paris apparatus was\r\napplied, and in two months was exchanged for one of sole-leather. In\r\nrising from the recumbent position the man had to lift his head with\r\nhis hands. Fifty days after the accident he suffered excruciating pain\r\nat the change of the weather, and at the approach of a storm the\r\njoints, as well as the neck, were involved. It was believed (one\r\nhundred and seven days after the accident) that both fracture and\r\nluxation existed. His voice had become guttural, but examination of the\r\nfauces was negative. The only evidence of paralysis was in the fingers,\r\nwhich, when applied to anything, experienced the sensation of touching\r\ngravel. The mottling of the tissues of the neck, which appeared about\r\nthe fiftieth day, had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thorburn, Hilton had a patient who lived fourteen years\r\nwith paraplegia due to fracture of the 5th, 6th, and 7th cervical\r\nvertebrae. Shaw is accredited with a case in which the patient lived\r\nfifteen months, the fracture being above the 4th cervical vertebra.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of foreign bodies in the larynx and trachea, the first to\r\nbe considered will be liquids. There is a case on record of an infant\r\nwho was eating some coal, and being discovered by its mother was forced\r\nto rapidly swallow some water. In the excitement, part of the fluid\r\nswallowed fell into the trachea, and death rapidly ensued. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to mention the instances in which pus or blood from ruptured\r\nabscesses entered the trachea and caused subsequent asphyxiation. A\r\ncurious instance is reported by Gaujot of Val-de-Grace of a soldier who\r\nwas wounded in the Franco-Prussian war, and into whose wound an\r\ninjection of the tincture of iodin was made. The wound was of such an\r\nextent as to communicate with a bronchus, and by this means the iodin\r\nentered the respiratory tract, causing suffocation. According to\r\nPoulet, Vidal de Cassis mentions an inmate of the Charite Hospital, in\r\nParis, who, full of wine, had started to vomit; he perceived Corvisart,\r\nand knew he would be questioned, therefore he quickly closed his mouth\r\nto hide the proofs of his forbidden ingestion. The materials in his\r\nmouth were forced into the larynx, and he was immediately asphyxiated.\r\nLaennec, Merat, and many other writers have mentioned death caused by\r\nthe entrance of vomited materials into the air-passages. Parrot has\r\nobserved a child who died by the penetration of chyme into the\r\nair-passages. The bronchial mucous and underlying membrane were already\r\nin a process of digestion.  Behrend, Piegu, and others cite analogous\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a foreign body in the larynx is at all times the cause\r\nof distressing symptoms, and, sometimes, a substance of the smallest\r\nsize will cause death. There is a curious accident recorded that\r\nhappened to a young man of twenty-three, who was anesthetized in order\r\nto extract a tooth. A cork had been placed between the teeth to keep\r\nthe mouth open. The tooth was extracted but slipped from the forceps,\r\nand, together with the cork, fell into the pharynx. The tooth was\r\nejected in an effort at vomiting, but the cork entered the larynx, and,\r\nafter violent struggles, asphyxiation caused death in an hour. The\r\nautopsy demonstrated the presence of the cork in the larynx. A somewhat\r\nanalogous case, though not ending fatally, was reported by Hertz of a\r\nwoman of twenty-six, who was anesthetized for the extraction of the\r\nright second inferior molar. The crown broke off during the operation,\r\nand immediately after the extraction she had a fit of coughing. About\r\nfifteen days later she experienced pain in the lungs. Her symptoms\r\nincreased to the fifth week, when she became so feeble as to be\r\nconfined to her bed. A body seemed to be moving in the trachea,\r\nsynchronously with respiration. At the end of the fifth week the\r\nmissing crown of the tooth was expelled after a violent fit of\r\ncoughing; the symptoms immediately ameliorated, and recovery was rapid\r\nthereafter. Aronsohn speaks of a child who was playing with a toy\r\nwind-instrument, and in his efforts to forcibly aspirate air through\r\nit, the child drew the detached reed into the respiratory passages,\r\ncausing asphyxiation. At the autopsy the foreign body was found at the\r\nsuperior portion of the left bronchus. There are other cases in which,\r\nwhile sucking oranges or lemons, seeds have been aspirated; and there\r\nis a case in which, in a like manner, the claw of a crab was drawn into\r\nthe air-passages. There are two cases mentioned in which children\r\nplaying with toy balloons, which they inflated with their breath, have,\r\nby inspiration, reversed them and drawn the rubber of the balloon into\r\nthe opening of the glottis, causing death. Aronsohn, who has already\r\nbeen quoted, and whose collection of instances of this nature is\r\nprobably the most extensive, speaks of a child in the street who was\r\neating an almond; a carriage threw the child down and he suddenly\r\ninspired the nut into the air-passages, causing immediate asphyxia The\r\nsame author also mentions a soldier walking in the street eating a\r\nplum, who, on being struck by a horse, suddenly started and swallowed\r\nthe seed of the fruit.  After the accident he had little pain or\r\noppression, and no coughing, but twelve hours afterward he rejected the\r\nseed in coughing.\r\n\r\nA curious accident is that in which a foreign body thrown into the air\r\nand caught in the mouth has caused immediate asphyxiation. Suetonius\r\ntransmits the history of a young man, a son of the Emperor Claudius,\r\nwho, in sport, threw a small pear into the air and caught it in his\r\nmouth, and, as a consequence, was suffocated. Guattani cites a similar\r\ninstance of a man who threw up a chestnut, which, on being received in\r\nthe mouth, lodged in the air-passages; the man died on the nineteenth\r\nday.  Brodie reported the classic observation of the celebrated\r\nengineer, Brunel, who swallowed a piece of money thrown into the air\r\nand caught in his mouth. It fell into the open larynx, was inspired,\r\ncausing asphyxiation, but was removed by inversion of the man's body.\r\n\r\nSennert says that Pope Adrian IV died from the entrance of a fly into\r\nhis respiratory passages; and Remy and Gautier record instances of the\r\npenetration of small fish into the trachea.  There are, again,\r\ninstances of leeches in this location.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the impaction of artificial teeth in the neighborhood of\r\nthe larynx has been unrecognized for many years.  Lennox Browne reports\r\nthe history of a woman who was supposed to have either laryngeal\r\ncarcinoma or phthisis, but in whom he found, impacted in the larynx, a\r\nplate with artificial teeth attached, which had remained in this\r\nposition twenty-two months unrecognized and unknown. The patient, when\r\nquestioned, remembered having been awakened in the night by a violent\r\nattack of vomiting, and finding her teeth were missing assumed they\r\nwere thrown away with the ejections. From that time on she had suffered\r\npain and distress in breathing and swallowing, and became the subject\r\nof progressive emaciation. After the removal of the impacted plate and\r\nteeth she soon regained her health.  Paget speaks of a gentleman who\r\nfor three months, unconsciously, carried at the base of the tongue and\r\nepiglottis, very closely fitted to all the surface on which it rested,\r\na full set of lost teeth and gold palate-plate. From the symptoms and\r\nhistory it was suspected that he had swallowed his set of false teeth,\r\nbut, in order to prevent his worrying, he was never informed of this\r\nsuspicion, and he never once suspected the causes of his symptoms.\r\n\r\nWrench mentions a case illustrative of the extent to which imagination\r\nmay produce symptoms simulating those ordinarily caused by the\r\nswallowing of false teeth. This man awoke one morning with his nose and\r\nthroat full of blood, and noticed that his false teeth, which he seldom\r\nremoved at night, were missing.  He rapidly developed great pain and\r\ntumor in the larynx, together with difficulty in deglutition and\r\nspeech. After a fruitless search, with instrumental and laryngoscopic\r\naid, the missing teeth were found--in a chest of drawers; the symptoms\r\nimmediately subsided when the mental illusion was relieved.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious case of a man drowned near Portsmouth. After the\r\nrecovery of his body it was seen that his false teeth were impacted at\r\nthe anterior opening of the glottis, and it was presumed that the shock\r\ncaused by the plunge into the cold water had induced a violent and deep\r\ninspiration which carried the teeth to the place of impaction.\r\n\r\nPerrin reports a case of an old man of eighty-two who lost his life\r\nfrom the impaction of a small piece of meat in the trachea and glottis.\r\nIn the Musee Valde-Grace is a prepared specimen of this case showing\r\nthe foreign body in situ. In the same museum Perrin has also deposited\r\na preparation from the body of a man of sixty-two, who died from the\r\nentrance of a morsel of beef into the respiratory passages. At the\r\npostmortem a mobile mass of food about the size of a hazel-nut was\r\nfound at the base of the larynx at the glossoepiglottic fossa. About\r\nthe 5th ring of the trachea the caliber of this organ was obstructed by\r\na cylindric alimentary bolus about six inches long, extending almost to\r\nthe bronchial division. Ashhurst shows a fibrinous cast, similar to\r\nthat found in croup, caused by a foreign body removed by Wharton,\r\ntogether with a shawl-pin, from a patient at the Children's Hospital\r\nseven hours after the performance of tracheotomy. Search for the\r\nforeign body at the time of the operation was prevented by profuse\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary instances of foreign bodies in the larynx and trachea are\r\nso common that they will not be mentioned here. Their variety is\r\ninnumerable and it is quite possible for more than two to be in the\r\nsame location simultaneously. In his treatise on this subject Gross\r\nsays that he has seen two, three, and even four substances\r\nsimultaneously or successively penetrate the same location. Berard\r\npresented a stick of wood extracted from the vocal cords of a child of\r\nten, and a few other similar instances are recorded.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Press and Circular finds in an Indian contemporary some\r\ncurious instances of misapplied ingenuity on the part of certain\r\nhabitual criminals in that country. The discovery on a prisoner of a\r\nheavy leaden bullet about 3/4 inch in diameter led to an inquiry as to\r\nthe object to which it was applied. It was ascertained that it served\r\nto aid in the formation of a pouch-like recess at the base of the\r\nepiglottis. The ball is allowed to slide down to the desired position,\r\nand it is retained there for about half an hour at a time. This\r\noperation is repeated many times daily until a pouch the desired size\r\nresults, in which criminals contrive to secrete jewels, money, etc., in\r\nsuch a way as to defy the most careful search, and without interfering\r\nin any way with speech or respiration. Upward of 20 prisoners at\r\nCalcutta were found to be provided with this pouch-formation. The\r\nresources of the professional malingerer are exceedingly varied, and\r\ntestify to no small amount of cunning.  The taking of internal\r\nirritants is very common, but would-be in-patients very frequently\r\novershoot the mark and render recovery impossible. Castor-oil seeds,\r\ncroton beans, and sundry other agents are employed with this object in\r\nview, and the medical officers of Indian prisons have to be continually\r\non the lookout for artificially induced diseases that baffle diagnosis\r\nand resist treatment. Army surgeons are not altogether unfamiliar with\r\nthese tricks, but compared with the artful Hindoos the British soldier\r\nis a mere child in such matters.\r\n\r\nExcision of the larynx has found its chief indication in carcinoma, but\r\nhas been employed in sarcoma, polyps, tuberculosis, enchondroma,\r\nstenosis, and necrosis. Whatever the procedure chosen for the\r\noperation, preliminary tracheotomy is a prerequisite. It should be made\r\nwell below the isthmus of the thyroid gland, and from three to fifteen\r\ndays before the laryngectomy. This affords time for the lungs to become\r\naccustomed to the new manner of breathing, and the trachea becomes\r\nfixed to the anterior wall of the neck.\r\n\r\nPowers and White have gathered 69 cases of either total or partial\r\nextirpation of the larynx, to which the 240 cases collected and\r\nanalyzed by Eugene Kraus, in 1890, have been added.  The histories of\r\nsix new cases are given. Of the 309 operations, 101, or 32 per cent of\r\nthe patients, died within the first eight weeks from shock, hemorrhage,\r\npneumonia, septic infection, or exhaustion. The cases collected by\r\nthese authors show a decrease in the death ratio in the total\r\nexcision,--29 per cent as against 36 per cent in the Kraus tables. The\r\nmortality in the partial operation is increased, being 38 per cent as\r\nopposed to 25 per cent. Cases reported as free from the disease before\r\nthe lapse of three years are of little value, except in that they\r\ndiminish, by so much, the operative death-rate. Of 180 laryngectomies\r\nfor carcinoma prior to January 1, 1892, 72, or 40 per cent, died as a\r\nresult of the operation; 51 of the remaining 108 had recurrence during\r\nthe first year, and 11, or ten per cent of the survivors, were free\r\nfrom relapse three or more years after operation. In 77 cases of\r\npartial laryngectomy for cancer, 26, or 33 per cent, died during the\r\nfirst two months; of the remaining 51, seven cases, or 13 per cent, are\r\nreported as free from the disease three or more years after the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nInjuries destroying great portions of the face or jaw, but not causing\r\ndeath, are seldom seen, except on the battle-field, and it is to\r\nmilitary surgery that we must look for the most striking instances of\r\nthis kind. Ribes mentions a man of thirty-three who, in the Spanish\r\ncampaign in 1811, received an injury which carried away the entire body\r\nof the lower jaw, half of each ramus, and also mangled in a great\r\ndegree the neighboring soft parts. He was transported from the field of\r\nbattle, and, despite enormous hemorrhage and suppuration, in two months\r\nrecovered. At the time of report the wounded man presented no trace of\r\nthe inferior maxillary bone, but by carrying the finger along the side\r\nof the pharynx in the direction of the superior dental arch the\r\ncoronoid apophyses could be recognized, and about six lines nearer the\r\ntemporal extremity the ramus could be discovered. The tongue was\r\nmissing for about one-third its length, and was thicker than natural\r\nand retracted on the hyoid bone. The sublingual glands were adherent to\r\nthe under part of the tongue and were red and over-developed. The\r\ninferior parts of the cheeks were cicatrized with the lateral and\r\nsuperior regions of the neck, and with the base of the tongue and the\r\nhyoid bone. The tongue was free under and in front of the larynx. The\r\npatient used a gilded silver plate to fix the tongue so that\r\ndeglutition could be carried on.  He was not able to articulate sounds,\r\nbut made himself understood through the intervention of this plate,\r\nwhich was fixed to a silver chin. The chin he used to maintain the\r\ntongue-plate, to diminish the deformity, and to retain the saliva,\r\nwhich was constantly dribbling on the neck. The same author quotes the\r\ninstance of a man of fifty, who, during the siege of Alexandria in\r\n1801, was struck in the middle of his face, obliquely, by a cannonball,\r\nfrom below upward and from right to left. A part of the right malar\r\nbone, the two superior maxillary bones, the nasal bones, the cartilage,\r\nthe vomer, the middle lamina of the ethmoid, the left maxillary bone, a\r\nportion of the left zygomatic arch, and a great portion of the inferior\r\nmaxilla were carried away, or comminuted, and all the soft parts\r\ncorrespondingly lacerated. Several hours afterward this soldier was\r\ncounted among the number of dead, but Larrey, the surgeon-in-chief of\r\nthe army, with his typical vigilance and humanity, remarked that the\r\npatient gave signs of life, and that, despite the magnitude of his\r\nwound, he did not despair of his recovery. Those portions in which\r\nattrition was very great were removed, and the splinters of bone taken\r\nout, showing an enormous wound. Three months were necessary for\r\ncicatrization, but it was not until the capitulation of Marabou, at\r\nwhich place he was wounded, that the patient was returned to France. At\r\nthis time he presented a hideous aspect. There were no signs of nose,\r\nnor cartilage separating the entrance of the nostrils, and the vault of\r\nthe nasal fossa could be easily seen. There was a part of the posterior\r\nregion of the right superior maxilla, but the left was entirely\r\ngone--in fact, the man presented an enormous triangular opening in the\r\ncenter of the face, as shown by the accompanying illustration. The\r\ntongue and larynx were severely involved, and the sight in the left eye\r\nwas lost. This patient continually wore a gilded silver mask, which\r\ncovered his deformity and rendered articulation a little less\r\ndifficult. The saliva continually dribbled from the mouth and from the\r\ninferior internal portion of his mask, compelling him to carry some\r\nsubstance to receive the dribblings. Whymper mentions an analogous\r\ninstance of a gunner who had his whole lower jaw torn away by a shell,\r\nbut who recovered and used an ingenious contrivance in the shape of a\r\nsilver mask for remedying the loss of the parts. Steiner mentions a\r\nwound from a cannon-ball, which carried away the left half of the\r\ninferior maxilla, stripping the soft parts as high as the malar, and on\r\nthe left side of the neck to within 1 1/2 inches of the clavicle,\r\nlaying bare the transverse processes of the 2d and 3d vertebrae, end\r\nexposing the external carotid and most of its branches.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a foreign body, such as the breech of a gun,\r\nmay be imbedded for some time in the face, with subsequent safe\r\nremoval. Keith mentions an instance of the successful removal of the\r\nbreech of a fowling-piece from the face, at the root of the nose, after\r\na lodgment of four months; and Fraser cites an analogous instance in\r\nwhich the breech was imbedded in the bones of the face for eight years\r\nSmith records an instance in which a broken piece of tobacco-pipe\r\npenetrated the cheek, remained there for seven months, but was\r\nsuccessfully extracted.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving accidents to the head and neck, a most curious case,\r\ncited by O'Neill, will be briefly reviewed. A boy of twelve was\r\nentrusted to carry a new iron pot to the destination of its purchaser.\r\nProbably to facilitate transportation, the boy removed his hat and\r\nplaced the pot obliquely on the back part of his head, but a sudden\r\nmovement caused it to slip forward and downward over the head.\r\nUnavailing efforts were made at the time and after he reached home, to\r\nremove the pot from his head, but in vain, and he continued all the\r\nnight greatly prostrated by fright, hunger, and thirst, together with\r\nthe efforts at removal.  The next morning he was taken to a neighboring\r\nblacksmith, who, by greasing one of his fingers, managed to insinuate\r\nit between the head and pot. Placing the other side of the pot against\r\nan anvil he struck over the location of his finger a quick, heavy tap\r\nwith a hammer, and the pot fell to pieces. The little patient was much\r\nexhausted by all his treatment and want of sleep, and, in fact, could\r\nhardly have endured his situation much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL ANOMALIES OF THE EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\nReunion of Digits.--An interesting phenomenon noticed in relation to\r\nsevered digits is their wonderful capacity for reunion.  Restitution of\r\na severed part, particularly if one of considerable function, naturally\r\nexcited the interest of the older writers. Locher has cited an instance\r\nof avulsion of the finger with restitution of the avulsed portion; and\r\nBrulet, Van Esh, Farmer, Ponteau, Regnault, and Rosenberg cite\r\ninstances of reunion of a digit after amputation or severance. Eve's\r\n\"Remarkable Cases in Surgery\" contains many instances of reunion of\r\nboth fingers and thumbs, and in more recent years several other similar\r\ncases have been reported. At the Emergency Hospital in Washington,\r\nD.C., there was a boy brought in who had completely severed one of his\r\ndigits by a sharp bread-cutter. The amputated finger was wrapped up in\r\na piece of brown paper, and, being apparently healthy and the wound\r\nabsolutely clean, it was fixed in the normal position on the stump, and\r\ncovered by a bichlorid dressing. In a short time complete function was\r\nrestored. In this instance no joint was involved, the amputation being\r\nin the middle of the 2d phalanx. Staton has described a case in which\r\nthe hand was severed from the arm by an accidental blow from an axe.\r\nThe wound extended from the styloid process directly across to the\r\ntrapezium, dividing all the muscles and blood-vessels, cutting through\r\nbones. A small portion of the skin below the articulation, with the\r\nulna, remained intact. After an unavoidable delay of an hour, Staton\r\nproceeded to replace the hand with silver sutures, adhesive plaster,\r\nand splints. On the third day pulsation was plainly felt in the hand,\r\nand on the fourteenth day the sutures were removed. After some time the\r\npatient was able to extend the fingers of the wounded member, and\r\nfinally to grasp with all her wonted strength.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction or accidental production of nails after the original\r\npart has been torn away by violence or destroyed by disease, is quite\r\ninteresting. Sometimes when the whole last phalanx has been removed,\r\nthe nail regrows at the tip of the remaining stump. Tulpius seems to\r\nhave met with this remarkable condition. Marechal de Rougeres, Voigtel,\r\nand Ormancey have related instances of similar growths on the 2d\r\nphalanx after the loss of the 1st. For several months a woman had\r\nsuffered from an ulcer of the middle finger of the right hand, in\r\nconsequence of a whitlow; there was loss of the 3d phalanx, and the\r\nwhole of the articular surface and part of the compact bony structure\r\nof the 2d. On examining the sore, Ormangey saw a bony sequestrum which\r\nappeared to keep it open. He extracted this, and, until cicatrization\r\nwas complete, he dressed the stump with saturnine cerate. Some months\r\nafterward Ormangey saw with astonishment that the nail had been\r\nreproduced; instead of following the ordinary direction, however, it\r\nlay directly over the face of the stump, growing from the back toward\r\nthe palmer aspect of the stump digit, as if to cover and protect the\r\nstump. Blandin has observed a case of the same description. A third\r\noccurred at the Hopital de la Charite, in a woman, who, in consequence\r\nof a whitlow, had lost the whole of the 3d phalanx of one of the\r\nforefingers. The soft and fleshy cushion which here covered the 2d\r\nphalanx was terminated by a small, blackish nail, like a grain of spur\r\nrye.  It is probable that in these cases the soft parts of the 3d\r\nphalanx, and especially the ungual matrix, had not been wholly\r\ndestroyed. In his lectures Chevalier speaks of analogous cases.\r\n\r\nIn some instances avulsion of a finger is effected in a peculiar\r\nmanner. In 1886 Anche reported to his confreres in Bordeaux a rare\r\naccident of this nature that occurred to a carpenter. The man's finger\r\nwas caught between a rope and the block of a pulley.  By a sudden and\r\nviolent movement on his part he disengaged the hand but left the 3d\r\nfinger attached to the pulley. At first examination the wound looked\r\nlike that of an ordinary amputation by the usual oval incision; from\r\nthe center of the wound the proximal fragment of the 1st phalanx\r\nprojected. Polaillon has collected 42 similar instances, in none of\r\nwhich, however, was the severance complete.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that in avulsion of the finger an entire tendon\r\nis stripped up and torn off with the detached member.  Vogel describes\r\nan instance of this nature, in which the long flexor of the thumb was\r\ntorn off with that digit. In the Surgical Museum at Edinburgh there is\r\npreserved a thumb and part of the flexor longus pollicis attached,\r\nwhich were avulsed simultaneously. Nunnely has seen the little finger\r\ntogether with the tendon and body of the longer flexor muscle avulsed\r\nby machinery. Stone details the description of the case of a boy named\r\nLowry, whose left thumb was caught between rapidly twisting strands of\r\na rope, and the last phalanx, the neighboring soft parts, and also the\r\nentire tendon of the flexor longus pollicis were instantly torn away.\r\nThere was included even the tendinous portion of that small slip of\r\nmuscle taking its origin from the anterior aspect of the head and upper\r\nportion of the ulna, and which is so delicate and insignificant as to\r\nbe generally overlooked by anatomists. There was great pain along the\r\ncourse of the tract of abstraction of the tendon.\r\n\r\nPinkerton describes a carter of thirty-one who was bitten on the thumb\r\nby a donkey. The man pulled violently in one direction, and the donkey,\r\nwho had seized the thumb firmly with his teeth, pulled forcibly in the\r\nother direction until the tissues gave way and the man ran off, leaving\r\nhis thumb in the donkey's mouth. The animal at once dropped the thumb,\r\nand it was picked up by a companion who accompanied the man to the\r\nhospital. On examination the detached portion was found to include the\r\nterminal phalanx of the thumb, together with the tendon of the flexor\r\nlongus pollicis measuring ten inches, about half of which length had a\r\nfringe of muscular tissue hanging from the free borders, indicating the\r\nextent and the penniform arrangement of the fibers attached to it.\r\nMeyer cites a case in which the index finger was torn off and the\r\nflexor muscle twisted from its origin. The authors know of an\r\nunreported case in which a man running in the street touched his hand\r\nto a hitching block he was passing; a ring on one of his fingers caught\r\nin the hook of the block, and tore off the finger with the attached\r\ntendon and muscle. There is a similar instance of a Scotch gentleman\r\nwho slipped, and, to prevent falling, he put out his hand to catch the\r\nrailing. A ring on one of his fingers became entangled in the railing\r\nand the force of the fall tore off the soft parts of the finger\r\ntogether with the ring.\r\n\r\nThe older writers mentioned as a curious fact that avulsion of the arm,\r\nunaccompanied by hemorrhage, had been noticed. Belchier, Carmichael,\r\nand Clough report instances of this nature, and, in the latter case,\r\nthe progress of healing was unaccompanied by any uncomfortable\r\nsymptoms. In the last century Hunezoysky observed complete avulsion of\r\nthe arm by a cannon-ball, without the slightest hemorrhage. The\r\nEphemerides contains an account of the avulsion of the hand without any\r\nbleeding, and Woolcomb has observed a huge wound of the arm from which\r\nhemorrhage was similarly absent. Later observations have shown that in\r\nthis accident absence of hemorrhage is the rule and not the exception.\r\nThe wound is generally lacerated and contused and the mouths of the\r\nvessels do not gape, but are twisted and crushed. The skin usually\r\nseparates at the highest point and the muscles protrude, appearing to\r\nbe tightly embraced and almost strangulated by the skin, and also by\r\nthe tendons, vessels, and nerves which, crushed and twisted with the\r\nfragments of bone, form a conical stump.  Cheselden reports the history\r\nof a case, which has since become classic, that he observed in St.\r\nThomas' Hospital in London, in 1837. A miller had carelessly thrown a\r\nslip-knot of rope about his wrist, which became caught in a revolving\r\ncog, drawing him from the ground and violently throwing his body\r\nagainst a beam.  The force exerted by the cog drawing on the rope was\r\nsufficient to avulse his whole arm and shoulder-blade. There was\r\ncomparatively little hemorrhage and the man was insensible to pain;\r\nbeing so dazed and surprised he really was unconscious of the nature of\r\nhis injury until he saw his arm in the wheel.\r\n\r\nAccording to Billroth the avulsion of an arm is usually followed by\r\nfatal shock. Fischer, however, relates the case of a lion-tamer whose\r\nwhole left arm was torn from the shoulder by a lion; the loss of blood\r\nbeing very slight and the patient so little affected by shock that he\r\nwas able to walk to the hospital.\r\n\r\nMussey describes a boy of sixteen who had his left arm and\r\nshoulder-blade completely torn from his body by machinery. The patient\r\nbecame so involved in the bands that his body was securely fastened to\r\na drum, while his legs hung dangling. In this position he made about 15\r\nrevolutions around the drum before the motion of the machinery could be\r\neffectually stopped by cutting off the water to the great wheel. When\r\nhe was disentangled from the bands and taken down from the drum a huge\r\nwound was seen at the shoulder, but there was not more than a pint of\r\nblood lost. The collar-bone projected from the wound about half an\r\ninch, and hanging from the wound were two large nerves (probably the\r\nmedian and ulnar) more than 20 inches long.  He was able to stand on\r\nhis feet and actually walked a few steps; as his frock was opened, his\r\narm, with a clot of blood, dropped to the floor. This boy made an\r\nexcellent recovery. The space between the plastered ceiling and the\r\ndrum in which the revolutions of the body had taken place was scarcely\r\n7 1/2 inches wide. Horsbeck's case was of a negro of thirty-five who,\r\nwhile pounding resin on a 12-inch leather band, had his hand caught\r\nbetween the wheel and band. His hand, forearm, arm, etc., were rapidly\r\ndrawn in, and he was carried around until his shoulder came to a large\r\nbeam, where the body was stopped by resistance against the beam, fell\r\nto the floor, and the arm and scapula were completely avulsed and\r\ncarried on beyond the beam. In this case, also, the man experienced\r\nlittle pain, and there was comparatively little hemorrhage. Maclean\r\nreports the history of an accident to a man of twenty-three who had\r\nboth arms caught between a belt and the shaft while working in a woolen\r\nfactory, and while the machinery was in full operation. He was carried\r\naround the shaft with great velocity until his arms were torn off at a\r\npoint about four inches below the shoulder-joint on each side. The\r\npatient landed on his feet, the blood spurting from each brachial\r\nartery in a large stream. His fellow-workmen, without delay, wound a\r\npiece of rope around each bleeding member, and the man recovered after\r\nprimary amputation of each stump.  Will gives an excellent instance of\r\navulsion of the right arm and scapula in a girl of eighteen, who was\r\ncaught in flax-spinning machinery. The axillary artery was seen lying\r\nin the wound, pulsating feebly, but had been efficiently closed by the\r\ntorsion of the machinery. The girl recovered.\r\n\r\nAdditional cases of avulsion of the upper extremity are reported by\r\nAubinais, Bleynie, Charles, George, James, Jones, Marcano, Belchier,\r\nBraithwaite, and Hendry.\r\n\r\nAvulsion of the Lower Extremity.--The symptoms following avulsion of\r\nthe upper extremity are seen as well in similar accidents to the leg\r\nand thigh, although the latter are possibly the more fatal. Horlbeck\r\nquotes Benomont's description of a small boy who had his leg torn off\r\nat the knee by a carriage in motion; the child experienced no pain, and\r\nwas more concerned about the punishment he expected to receive at home\r\nfor disobedience than about the loss of his leg. Carter speaks of a boy\r\nof twelve who incautiously put the great toe of his left foot against a\r\npinion wheel of a mill in motion. The toe was fastened and drawn into\r\nthe mill, the leg following almost to the thigh. The whole left leg and\r\nthigh, together with the left side of the scrotum, were torn off; the\r\nboy died as a result of his injuries.\r\n\r\nAshurst reported to the Pathological Society of Philadelphia the case\r\nof a child of nine who had its right leg caught in the spokes of a\r\ncarriage wheel. The child was picked up unconscious, with its thigh\r\nentirely severed, and the bone broken off about the middle third; about\r\nthree inches higher the muscles were torn from the sheaths and appeared\r\nas if cut with a knife. The great sciatic nerve was found hanging 15\r\ninches from the stump, having given way from its division in the\r\npopliteal space. The child died in twelve hours. One of the most\r\ninteresting features of the case was the rapid cooling of the body\r\nafter the accident and prolongation of the coolness with slight\r\nvariations until death ensued. Ashurst remarks that while the cutaneous\r\nsurface of the stump was acutely sensitive to the touch, there was no\r\nmanifestation of pain evinced upon handling the exposed nerve.\r\n\r\nWith reference to injuries to the sciatic nerve, Kuster mentions the\r\ncase of a strong man of thirty, who in walking slipped and fell on his\r\nback. Immediately after rising to his feet he felt severe pain in the\r\nright leg and numbness in the foot. He was unable to stand, and was\r\ncarried to his house, where Kuster found him suffering great pain. The\r\ndiagnosis had been fracture of the neck of the femur, but as there was\r\nno crepitation and passive movements caused but little pain, Kuster\r\nsuspected rupture of the sciatic nerve. The subsequent history of the\r\ncase confirmed this diagnosis. The patient was confined to bed six\r\nweeks, and it was five months afterward before he was able to go about,\r\nand then only with a crutch and a stick.\r\n\r\nPark mentions an instance of rupture of the sciatic nerve caused by a\r\npatient giving a violent lurch during an operation at the hip-joint.\r\n\r\nThe instances occasionally observed of recovery of an injured leg after\r\nextensive severance and loss of substance are most marvelous. Morton\r\nmentions a boy of sixteen, who was struck by one of the blades of a\r\nreaping machine, and had his left leg cut through about 1 1/4 inches\r\nabove the ankle-joint. The foot was hanging by the portion of skin\r\ncorresponding to the posterior quarter of the circumference of the leg,\r\ntogether with the posterior tibial vessels and nerves. These were the\r\nonly structures escaping division, although the ankle-joint itself was\r\nintact. There was comparatively little hemorrhage and no shock; a\r\nligature was applied to the vessels, the edges of the wound were drawn\r\ntogether by wire sutures, and the cut surfaces of the tibia were placed\r\nin as good apposition as possible, although the lower fragment\r\nprojected slightly in front of the upper. The wound was dressed and\r\nhealing progressed favorably; in three months the wound had filled up\r\nto such an extent that the man was allowed to go on crutches. The\r\npatient was discharged in five months, able to walk very well, but\r\nowing to the loss of the function of the extensor tendons the toes\r\ndragged.\r\n\r\nWashington reports in full the case of a boy of eleven, who, in handing\r\na fowling piece across a ditch, was accidentally shot.  The contents of\r\nthe gun were discharged through the leg above the ankle, carrying away\r\nfive-sixths of the structure--at the time of the explosion the muzzle\r\nof the gun was only two feet away from his leg. The portions removed\r\nwere more than one inch of the tibia and fibula (irregular fractures of\r\nthe ends above and below), a corresponding portion of the posterior\r\ntibial muscle, and the long flexors of the great and small toes, as\r\nwell as the tissue interposed between them and the Achilles tendon. The\r\nanterior tibial artery was fortunately uninjured. The remaining\r\nportions consisted of a strip of skin two inches in breadth in front of\r\nthe wound, the muscles which it covered back of the wound, the Achilles\r\ntendon, and another piece of skin, barely enough to cover the tendon.\r\nThe wound was treated by a bran-dressing, and the limb was saved with a\r\nshortening of but 1 1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nThere are several anomalous injuries which deserve mention.  Markoe\r\nobserved a patient of seventy-two, who ruptured both the quadriceps\r\ntendons of each patella by slipping on a piece of ice, one tendon first\r\ngiving way, and followed almost immediately by the other. There was the\r\nusual depression immediately above the upper margin of the patella, and\r\nthe other distinctive signs of the accident. In three months both\r\ntendons had united to such an extent that the patient was able to walk\r\nslowly. Gibney records a case in which the issue was not so successful,\r\nhis patient being a man who, in a fall ten years previously, had\r\nruptured the right quadriceps tendon, and four years later had suffered\r\nthe same accident on the opposite side. As a result of his injuries, at\r\nthe time Gibney saw him, he had completely lost all power of extending\r\nthe knee-joint. Partridge mentions an instance, in a strong and healthy\r\nman, of rupture of the tendon of the left triceps cubiti, caused by a\r\nfall on the pavement. There are numerous cases in which the tendo\r\nAchillis has recovered after rupture,--in fact, it is unhesitatingly\r\nsevered when necessity demands it, sufficient union always being\r\nanticipated. None of these cases of rupture of the tendon are unique,\r\nparallel instances existing in medical literature in abundance.\r\n\r\nMarshall had under his observation a case in which the femoral artery\r\nwas ruptured by a cart wheel passing over the thigh, and death ensued\r\nalthough there were scarcely any external signs of contusion and\r\npositively no fracture. Boerhaave cites a curious instance in which a\r\nsurgeon attempted to stop hemorrhage from a wounded radial artery by\r\nthe application of a caustic, but the material applied made such\r\ninroads as to destroy the median artery and thus brought about a fatal\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nSpontaneous fractures are occasionally seen, but generally in advanced\r\nage, although muscular action may be the cause. There are several cases\r\non record in which the muscular exertion in throwing a stone or ball,\r\nor in violently kicking the leg, has fractured one or both of the bones\r\nof an extremity. In old persons intracapsular fracture may be caused by\r\nsuch a trivial thing as turning in bed, and even a sudden twist of the\r\nankle has been sufficient to produce this injury. In a boy of thirteen\r\nStorrs has reported fracture of the femur within the acetabulum.  In\r\naddition to the causes enumerated, inflammation of osseous tissue, or\r\nosteoid carcinoma, has been found at the seat of a spontaneous fracture.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting subjects in the history of surgery is the\r\ngradual evolution of the rational treatment of dislocations.  Possibly\r\nno portion of the whole science was so backward as this.  Thirty-five\r\ncenturies ago Darius, son of Hydaspis, suffered a simple luxation of\r\nthe foot; it was not diagnosed in this land of Apis and of the deified\r\ndiscoverer of medicine. Among the wise men of Egypt, then in her acme\r\nof civilization, there was not one to reduce the simple luxation which\r\nany student of the present day would easily diagnose and successfully\r\ntreat. Throughout the dark ages and down to the present century, the\r\nhideous and unnecessary apparatus employed, each decade bringing forth\r\nnew types, is abundantly pictured in the older books on surgery; in\r\nsome almost recent works there are pictures of windlasses and of\r\nindividuals making superhuman efforts to pull the luxated member\r\nback--all of which were given to the student as advisable means of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nRelative to anomalous dislocations the field is too large to be\r\ndiscussed here, but there are two recent ones worthy of mention.\r\nBradley relates an instance of death following a subluxation of the\r\nright humerus backward on the scapula It could not be reduced because\r\nthe tendon of the biceps lay between the head of the humerus and a\r\npiece of the bone which was chipped off.\r\n\r\nBaxter-Tyrie reports a dislocation of the shoulder-joint, of unusual\r\norigin, in a man who was riding a horse that ran away up a steep hill.\r\nAfter going a few hundred yards the animal abated its speed, when the\r\nrider raised his hand to strike. Catching sight of the whip, the horse\r\nsprang forward, while the man felt an acute pain and a sense of\r\nsomething having given way at his shoulder. He did not fall off, but\r\nrode a little further and was helped to dismount. On examination a\r\nsubcoracoid dislocation of the head of the humerus was found. The\r\nexplanation is that as the weight of the whip was inconsiderable (four\r\nounces) the inertia of the arm converted it into a lever of the first\r\norder. Instead of fulfilling its normal function of preventing\r\ndisplacement, the coraco-acromial arch acted as a fulcrum. The limb\r\nfrom the fingers to that point acted as the \"long arm,\" and the head\r\nand part of the neck of the humerus served as the \"short arm.\" The\r\ninertia of the arm, left behind as it were, supplied the power, while\r\nthe ruptured capsular ligament and displacement of the head of the bone\r\nwould represent the work done.\r\n\r\nCongenital Dislocations.--The extent and accuracy of the knowledge\r\npossessed by Hippocrates on the subject of congenital dislocations have\r\nexcited the admiration of modern writers, and until a comparatively\r\nrecent time examples of certain of the luxations described by him had\r\nnot been recorded. With regard, for instance, to congenital\r\ndislocations at the shoulder-joint, little or nothing was known save\r\nwhat was contained in the writings of Hippocrates, till R. M. Smith and\r\nGuerin discussed the lesion in their works.\r\n\r\nAmong congenital dislocations, those of the hips are most common--in\r\nfact, 90 per cent of all. They are sometimes not recognizable until\r\nafter the lapse of months and sometimes for years, but their\r\ncauses--faulty developments of the joint, paralysis, etc.--are supposed\r\nto have existed at birth. One or both joints may be involved, and\r\naccording to the amount of involvement the gait is peculiar. As to the\r\nreduction of such a dislocation, the most that can be done is to\r\ndiminish the deformity and functional disability by traction and\r\npalliative measures with apparatus. The normal structure of the joint\r\ndoes not exist, and therefore the dislocation admits of no reduction.\r\nCongenital dislocations of the shoulder are also seen, owing to faulty\r\ndevelopment of the glenoid fossa; and at the knee, the leg generally\r\nbeing in extreme hyperextension, the foot sometimes resting on the\r\nabdomen. Congenital luxation of the femora, when it appears in adult\r\nwomen is a prominent factor in dystocia.  There is a dislocation found\r\nat birth, or occurring shortly after, due to dropsy of the joint in\r\nutero; and another form due to succeeding paralysis of groups of\r\nmuscles about the joint.\r\n\r\nThe interesting instances of major amputations are so numerous and so\r\nwell known as to need no comment here. Amputation of the hip with\r\nrecovery is fast becoming an ordinary operation; at Westminster\r\nHospital in London, there is preserved the right humerus and scapula,\r\npresenting an enormous bulk, which was removed by amputation at the\r\nshoulder-joint, for a large lymphosarcoma growing just above the\r\nclavicle. The patient was a man of twenty-two, and made a good\r\nrecovery. Another similar preparation is to be seen in London at St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospital.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous, synchronous, or consecutive amputations of all the limbs\r\nhave been repeatedly performed. Champeuois reports the case of a\r\nSumatra boy of seven, who was injured to such an extent by an explosion\r\nas to necessitate the amputation of all his extremities, and, despite\r\nhis tender age and the extent of his injuries, the boy completely\r\nrecovered. Jackson, quoted by Ashhurst, had a patient from whom he\r\nsimultaneously amputated all four limbs for frost-bite.\r\n\r\nMuller reports a case of amputation of all four limbs for frost-bite,\r\nwith recovery. The patient, aged twenty-six, while traveling to his\r\nhome in Northern Minnesota, was overtaken by a severe snow storm, which\r\ncontinued for three days; on December 13th he was obliged to leave the\r\nstage in a snow-drift on the prairie, about 110 miles distant from his\r\ndestination. He wandered over the prairie that day and night, and the\r\nfollowing four days, through the storm, freezing his limbs, nose, ears,\r\nand cheeks, taking no food or water until, on December 16th, he was\r\nfound in a dying condition by Indian scouts, and taken to a\r\nstation-house on the road. He did not reach the hospital at Fort\r\nRidgely until the night of December 24th--eleven days after his first\r\nexposure. He was almost completely exhausted, and, after thawing the\r\nice from his clothes, stockings, and boots,--which had not been removed\r\nsince December 13th,--it was found that both hands and forearms were\r\ncompletely mortified up to the middle third, and both feet and legs as\r\nfar as the upper third; both knees over and around the patellae, and\r\nthe alae and tip of the nose all presented a dark bluish appearance and\r\nfairly circumscribed swelling. No evacuation of the bowels had taken\r\nplace for over two weeks, and as the patient suffered from singultus\r\nand constant pain over the epigastric region, a light cathartic was\r\ngiven, which, in twenty-four hours, gave relief.  The four frozen limbs\r\nwere enveloped in a solution of zinc chlorid. The frozen ears and\r\ncheeks healed in due time, and the gangrenous parts of the nose\r\nseparated and soon healed, with the loss of the tip and parts of the\r\nalae, leaving the septum somewhat exposed. On January 10th the lines of\r\ndemarcation were distinct and deep on all four limbs, though the\r\npatient, seconded by his wife, at first obstinately opposed operative\r\ninterference; on January 13th, after a little hesitancy, the man\r\nconsented to an amputation of the arms. This was successfully carried\r\nout on both forearms, at the middle third, the patient losing hardly\r\nany blood and complaining of little pain. The great relief afforded by\r\nthis operation so changed his aversion to being operated upon that on\r\nthe next day he begged to have both legs amputated in the same manner,\r\nwhich was done, three days afterward, with the same favorable result.\r\nAfter some minor complications the patient left for his home, perfectly\r\nrecovered, June 9, 1866.\r\n\r\nBegg of Dundee successfully performed quadruple amputation on a woman,\r\nthe victim of idiopathic gangrene. With artificial limbs she was able\r\nto earn a livelihood by selling fancy articles which she made herself.\r\nThis woman died in 1885, and the four limbs, mounted on a lay figure,\r\nwere placed in the Royal College of Surgeons, in London. Wallace, of\r\nRock Rapids, Iowa, has successfully removed both forearms, one leg, and\r\nhalf of the remaining foot, for frost-bite. Allen describes the case of\r\na boy of eight who was run over by a locomotive, crushing his right\r\nleg, left foot, and left forearm to such an extent as to necessitate\r\nprimary triple amputation at the left elbow, left foot, and right leg,\r\nthe boy recovering. Ashhurst remarks that Luckie, Alexander, Koehler,\r\nLowman, and Armstrong have successfully removed both legs and one arm\r\nsimultaneously for frost-bite, all the patients making excellent\r\nrecoveries in spite of their mutilations; he adds that he himself has\r\nsuccessfully resorted to synchronous amputation of the right hip-joint\r\nand left leg for a railroad injury occurring in a lad of fifteen, and\r\nhas twice synchronously amputated three limbs from the same patient,\r\none case recovering.\r\n\r\nWharton reports a case of triple major amputation on a negro of\r\ntwenty-one, who was run over by a train. His right leg was crushed at\r\nthe knee, and the left leg crushed and torn off in the middle third;\r\nthe right forearm and hand were crushed. In order to avoid chill and\r\nexposure, he was operated on in his old clothes, and while one limb was\r\nbeing amputated the other was being prepared. The most injured member\r\nwas removed first.  Recovery was uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nThere are two cases of spontaneous amputation worthy of record.\r\nBoerhaave mentions a peasant near Leyden, whose axillary artery was\r\ndivided with a knife, causing great effusion of blood, and the patient\r\nfainted. The mouth of the vessel was retracted so far as to render\r\nligature impossible, and the poor man was abandoned to what was\r\nconsidered an inevitable fate by his unenlightened attendants.\r\nExpecting to die every moment, he continued several days in a languid\r\nstate, but the hemorrhage ceased spontaneously, and the arm decayed,\r\nshrunk, and dried into a mummified stump, which he carried about for\r\nquite a while. Rooker speaks of a fracture of the forearm, near the\r\nlower part of the middle third, in a patient aged fourteen. Incipient\r\ngangrene below the seat of fracture, with associate inflammation,\r\ndeveloped; but on account of the increasing gangrene it was determined\r\nto amputate. On the fifth day the line of demarcation extended to the\r\nspine of the scapula, laying bare the bone and exposing the acromion\r\nprocess and involving the pectoral muscles. It was again decided to let\r\nNature continue her work. The bones exfoliated, the spine and the\r\nacromial end of the scapula came away, and a good stump was formed.\r\nFigure 212 represents the patient at the age of twenty-eight.\r\n\r\nBy ingenious mechanical contrivances persons who have lost an extremity\r\nare enabled to perform the ordinary functions of the missing member\r\nwith but slight deterioration. Artificial arms, hands, and legs have\r\nbeen developed to such a degree of perfection that the modern\r\nmechanisms of this nature are very unlike the cumbersome and intricate\r\ncontrivances formerly used.\r\n\r\nLe Progres Medical contains an interesting account of a curious contest\r\nheld between dismembered athletes at Nogent-Sur-Marne, a small town in\r\nthe Department of the Seine, in France. Responding to a general\r\ninvitation, no less than seven individuals who had lost either leg or\r\nthigh, competed in running races for prizes.  The enterprising cripples\r\nwere divided into two classes: the cuissards, or those who had lost a\r\nthigh, and jambards, or those who had lost a leg; and, contrary to what\r\nmight have been expected, the grand champion came from the former\r\nclass. The distance in each race was 200 meters. M. Roullin, whose\r\nthigh, in consequence of an accident, was amputated in 1887, succeeded\r\nin traversing the course in the remarkable time of thirty seconds\r\n(about 219 yards); whereas M. Florrant, the speediest jambard, required\r\nthirty-six seconds to run the same distance; and was, moreover,\r\ndefeated by two other cuissards besides the champion.  The junior race\r\nwas won in thirty-five seconds, and this curious day's sport was ended\r\nby a course de consolation, which was carried off in thirty-three\r\nseconds by M. Mausire, but whether he was a cuissard or a jambard was\r\nnot stated.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions in England, cricket matches have been organized\r\nbetween armless and legless men. In Charles Dickens' paper, \"All the\r\nYear Round,\" October 5, 1861, there is a reference to a cricket match\r\nbetween a one-armed eleven and a one-legged eleven. There is a recent\r\nreport from De Kalb, Illinois, of a boy of thirteen who had lost both\r\nlegs and one arm, but who was nevertheless enabled to ride a bicycle\r\nspecially constructed for him by a neighboring manufacturer. With one\r\nhand he guided the handle bar, and bars of steel attached to his stumps\r\nserved as legs. He experienced no trouble in balancing the wheel; it is\r\nsaid that he has learned to dismount, and soon expects to be able to\r\nmount alone; although riding only three weeks, he has been able to\r\ntraverse one-half a mile in two minutes and ten seconds. While the\r\nforegoing instance is an exception, it is not extraordinary in the\r\npresent day to see persons with artificial limbs riding bicycles, and\r\neven in Philadelphia, May 30, 1896, there was a special bicycle race\r\nfor one-legged contestants.\r\n\r\nThe instances of interesting cases of foreign bodies in the extremities\r\nare not numerous. In some cases the foreign body is tolerated many\r\nyears in this location. There are to-day many veterans who have bullets\r\nin their extremities. Girdwood speaks of the removal of a foreign body\r\nafter twenty-five years' presence in the forearm. Pike mentions a man\r\nin India, who, at the age of twenty-two, after killing a wounded hare\r\nin the usual manner by striking it on the back of the neck with the\r\nside of the hand, noticed a slight cut on the hand which soon healed\r\nbut left a lump under the skin. It gave him no trouble until two months\r\nbefore the time of report, when he asked to have the lump removed,\r\nthinking it was a stone. It was cut down upon and removed, and proved\r\nto be the spinous process of the vertebra of a hare. The bone was\r\nliving and healthy and had formed a sort of arthrodial joint on the\r\nbase of the phalanx of the little finger and had remained in this\r\nposition for nearly twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nWhite has described a case in which a nail broken off in the foot,\r\nseparated into 26 splinters, which, after intense suffering, were\r\nsuccessfully removed. There was a case recently reported of a man\r\nadmitted to the Bellevue Hospital, New York, whose arm was supposed to\r\nhave been fractured by an explosion, but instead of which 11 feet of\r\nlead wire were found in it by the surgeons. The man was a machinist in\r\nthe employ of the East River Lead Co., and had charge of a machine\r\nwhich converted molten lead into wire. This machine consists of a steel\r\nbox into which the lead is forced, being pressed through an aperture\r\n1/8 inch in diameter by hydraulic pressure of 600 tons. Reaching the\r\nair, the lead becomes hard and is wound on a large wheel in the form of\r\nwire. Just before the accident this small aperture had become clogged,\r\nand the patient seized the projecting wire in his hand, intending to\r\nfree the action of the machine, as he had previously done on many\r\noccasions, by a sharp, strong pull; but in so doing an explosion\r\noccurred, and he was hurled to the floor unconscious. While on the way\r\nto the hospital in the ambulance, he became conscious and complained of\r\nbut little pain except soreness of the left arm about the elbow. The\r\nswelling, which had developed very rapidly, made it impossible for the\r\nsurgeons to make an examination, but on the following day, when the\r\ninflammation had subsided sufficiently, a diagnosis of fracture of the\r\nbones of the arm was made. There was no external injury of the skin of\r\nany magnitude, and the surgeons decided to cut down on the trifling\r\ncontusion, and remove what appeared to be a fragment of bone, lodged\r\nslightly above the wrist. An anesthetic was administered, and an\r\nincision made, but to the amazement of the operators, instead of bone,\r\na piece of wire one inch in length and 1/8 inch in diameter was\r\nremoved. On further exploration piece after piece of the wire was taken\r\nout until finally the total length thus removed aggregated 11 feet, the\r\nlongest piece measuring two feet and the shortest 1/4 inch. The wire\r\nwas found imbedded under the muscles of the arm, and some of it had\r\nbecome wedged between the bones of the forearm. Probably the most\r\nremarkable feature of this curious accident was the fact that there was\r\nno fracture or injury to the bone, and it was thought possible that the\r\nfunction of the arm would be but little impaired.\r\n\r\nTousey reports a case of foreign body in the axilla that was taken for\r\na necrotic fragment of the clavicle. The patient was a boy of sixteen,\r\nwho climbed up a lamp-post to get a light for his bicycle lamp; his\r\nfeet slipped off the ornamental ledge which passed horizontally around\r\nthe post about four feet from the ground, and he fell. In the fall a\r\nlead pencil in his waistcoat pocket caught on the ledge and was driven\r\ninto the axilla, breaking off out of sight. This was supposed to be a\r\npiece of the clavicle, and was only discovered to be a pencil when it\r\nwas removed six weeks after.\r\n\r\nThere are several diseases of the bone having direct bearing on the\r\nanomalies of the extremities which should have mention here.\r\nOsteomalacia is a disease of the bones in adult life, occurring most\r\nfrequently in puerperal women, but also seen in women not in the\r\npuerperal state, and in men. It is characterized by a progressive\r\nsoftening of the bone-substance, from a gradual absorption of the lime\r\nsalts, and gives rise to considerable deformity, and occasionally to\r\nspontaneous fracture.\r\n\r\nRachitis or rickets is not a disease of adult life, but of infancy and\r\nchildhood, and never occurs after the age of puberty.  It seldom begins\r\nbefore six months or after three years. There are several theories as\r\nto its causation, one being that it is due to an abnormal development\r\nof acids. There is little doubt that defective nutrition and bad\r\nhygienic surroundings are prominent factors in its production. The\r\nprincipal pathologic change is seen in the epiphyseal lines of long\r\nbones and beneath the periosteum. Figure 213 shows the appearance\r\nduring life of a patient with the highest grade of rachitis, and it can\r\nbe easily understood what a barrier to natural child-birth it would\r\nproduce. In rachitis epiphyseal swellings are seen at the wrists and\r\nankle-joints, and in superior cases at the ends of the phalanges of the\r\nfingers and toes. When the shaft of a long bone is affected, not only\r\ndeformity, but even fracture may occur.  Under these circumstances the\r\nhumerus and femur appear to be the bones most likely to break; there is\r\nan associate deformity of the head, known as \"craniotabes,\" together\r\nwith pigeon-breast and various spinal curvature. The accompanying\r\nillustration is from a drawing of a skeleton in the Warren Museum in\r\nBoston. The subject was an Indian, twenty-one years of age, one of the\r\nSix Nations.  His mode of locomotion was by a large wooden bowl, in\r\nwhich he sat and moved forward by advancing first one side of the bowl\r\nand then the other, by means of his hands. The nodules or \"adventitious\r\njoints\" were the result of imperfect ossification, or, in other words,\r\nof motion before ossification was completed.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to rachitis is achondroplasia, or the so called fetal\r\nrickets--a disease in which deformity results from an arrest, absence,\r\nor perversion of the normal process of enchondral ossification. It is\r\ndecidedly an intrauterine affection, and the great majority of fetuses\r\ndie in utero. Thomson reports three living cases of achondroplasia. The\r\nfirst was a child five months of age, of pale complexion, bright and\r\nintelligent, its head measuring 23 inches in length. There was a narrow\r\nthorax showing the distinct beads of rickets; the upper and lower limbs\r\nwere very short, but improved under antirachitic treatment. The child\r\ndied of pneumonia. The other two cases were in adults, one thirty-nine\r\nand the other thirty-six. The men were the same height, 49 inches, and\r\nresembled each other in all particulars.  They both enjoyed good\r\nhealth, and, though somewhat dwarfed, were of considerable\r\nintelligence. Neither had married. Both the upper and; lower limbs\r\nshowed exaggerations of the normal curves; the hands and feet were\r\nbroad and short; the gait of both of these little men was waddling, the\r\nhunk swaying when they attempted to make any rapid progress.\r\n\r\nOsteitis deformans is a hyperplasia of bone described by Paget in 1856.\r\nPaget's patient was a gentleman of forty-six who had always enjoyed\r\ngood health; without assignable cause he began to be subject to aching\r\npains in the thighs and legs. The bones of the left leg began to\r\nincrease in size, and a year or two later the left femur; also enlarged\r\nconsiderably. During a period of twenty years these changes were\r\nfollowed by a growth of other bones. The spine became firm and; rigid,\r\nthe head increased 5 1/4 inches in circumference. The bones of the face\r\nwere not affected. When standing, the patient had a peculiar bowed\r\ncondition of the legs, with marked flexure at the knees. He finally\r\ndied of osteosarcoma, originating in the left radius, Paget collected\r\neight cases, five of whom died of malignant disease. The postmortem of\r\nPaget's case showed extreme thickening in the bones affected, the femur\r\nand cranium particularly showing osteoclerosis. Several cases have been\r\nrecorded in this country; according to Warren, Thieberge analyzed 43\r\ncases; 21 were men, 22 women; the disease appeared usually after forty.\r\n\r\nAcromegaly is distinguished from osteitis deformans in that it is\r\nlimited to hypertrophy of the hands, feet, and face, and it usually\r\nbegins earlier. In gigantism the so-called \"giant growth of bones\" is\r\noften congenital in character, and is unaccompanied by inflammatory\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThe deformities of the articulations may be congenital but in most\r\ncases are acquired. When these are of extreme degree, locomotion is\r\neffected in most curious ways. Ankylosis at unnatural angles and even\r\ncomplete reversion of the joints has been noticed. Pare gives a case of\r\nreversion, and of crooked hands and feet; and Barlow speaks of a child\r\nof two and three-quarter years with kyphosis, but mobility of the\r\nlumbar region, which walked on its elbows and knees. The pathology of\r\nthis deformity is obscure, but there might have been malposition in\r\nutero. Wilson presented a similar case before the Clinical Society of\r\nLondon, in 1888. The \"Camel-boy,\" exhibited some years ago throughout\r\nthe United States, had reversion of the joints, which resembled those\r\nof quadrupeds. He walked on all fours, the mode of progression\r\nresembling that of a camel.\r\n\r\nFigure 216 represents Orloff, \"the transparent man,\" an exhibitionist,\r\nshowing curious deformity of the long bones and atrophy of the\r\nextremities. He derived his name from the remarkable transparency of\r\nhis deformed members to electric light, due to porosity of the bones\r\nand deficiency of the overlying tissues.\r\n\r\nFigure 217, taken from Hutchinson's \"Archives of Surgery,\" represents\r\nan extreme case of deformity of the knee-joints in a boy of seven, the\r\nresult of severe osteoarthritis. The knees and elbows were completely\r\nankylosed.\r\n\r\nInfantile spinal paralysis is often the cause of distressing\r\ndeformities, forbidding locomotion in the ordinary manner. In a paper\r\non the surgical and mechanical treatment of such deformities Willard\r\nmentions a boy of fourteen, the victim of infantile paralysis, who at\r\nthe age of eleven had never walked, but dragged his legs along. His\r\nlegs were greatly twisted, and there was flexion at right angles at the\r\nhips and knees. There was equinovarus in the left foot and equinovalgus\r\nin the right.  By an operation of subcutaneous section at the hips,\r\nknees, and feet, with application of plaster-of-Paris and extension,\r\nthis hopeless cripple walked with crutches in two months, and with an\r\napparatus consisting of elastic straps over the quadriceps femoris,\r\nperoneals, and weakened muscles, the valgus-foot being supported\r\nbeneath the sole. In six months he was walking long distances; in one\r\nyear he moved speedily on crutches. Willard also mentions another case\r\nof a girl of eleven who was totally unable to support the body in the\r\nerect position, but could move on all fours, as shown in figure 219.\r\nThere was equinovarus in the right foot and valgus in the left. The\r\nleft hip was greatly distorted, not only in the direction of flexion,\r\nbut there was also twisting of the femoral neck, simulating\r\ndislocation. This patient was also operated on in the same manner as\r\nthe preceding one.\r\n\r\nRelative to anomalous increase or hypertrophy of the bones of the\r\nextremities, Fischer shows that an increase in the length of bone may\r\nfollow slight injuries. He mentions a boy of twelve, who was run over\r\nby a wagon and suffered a contusion of the bones of the right leg. In\r\nthe course of a year this leg became 4 1/2 cm.  longer than the other,\r\nand the bones were also much thicker than in the other. Fischer also\r\nreports several cases of abnormal growth of bone following necrosis. A\r\ncase of shortening 3 3/4 cm., after a fracture, was reduced to one cm.\r\nby compensatory growth. Elongation of the bone is also mentioned as the\r\nresult of the inflammation of the joint. Warren also quotes Taylor's\r\ncase of a lady who fell, injuring, but not fracturing, the thigh.\r\nGradual enlargement, with an outward curving of the bone, afterward\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL ANOMALIES OF THE THORAX AND ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the lung or bronchus are always serious, but contrary to\r\nthe general idea, recovery after extensive wound of the lung is quite a\r\ncommon occurrence. Even the older writers report many instances of\r\nremarkable recoveries from lung-injuries, despite the primitive and\r\ndirty methods of treatment. A review of the literature previous to this\r\ncentury shows the names of Arcaeus, Brunner, Collomb, Fabricius\r\nHildanus, Vogel, Rhodius, Petit, Guerin, Koler, Peters, Flebbe, and\r\nStalpart, as authorities for instances of this nature. In one of the\r\njournals there is a description of a man who was wounded by a\r\nbroad-sword thrust in the mediastinum. After death it was found that\r\nnone of the viscera were wounded, and death was attributed to the fact\r\nthat the in-rush of air counterbalancing the pressure within the lungs\r\nleft them to their own contractile force, with resultant collapse,\r\nobstruction to the circulation, and death. It is said that Vesalius\r\ndemonstrated this condition on the thorax of a pig.\r\n\r\nGooch gives an instance of a boy of thirteen who fell from the top of a\r\nbarn upon the sharp prow of a plough, inflicting an oblique wound from\r\nthe axilla to below the sternum, slightly above the insertion of the\r\ndiaphragm. Several ribs were severed, and the left thoracic cavity was\r\nwholly exposed to view, showing the lungs, diaphragm, and pericardium\r\nall in motion. The lungs soon became gangrenous, and in this horrible\r\nstate the patient lived twelve days. One of the curious facts noticed\r\nby the ancient writers was the amelioration of the symptoms caused by\r\nthoracic wounds after hemorrhage from other locations; and naturally,\r\nin the treatment of such injuries, this circumstance was used in\r\nadvocacy of depletion. Monro speaks of a gentleman who was wounded in a\r\nduel, and who had all the symptoms of hemothorax; his condition was\r\nimmediately relieved by the evacuation of a considerable quantity of\r\nbloody matter with the urine. Swammerdam records a similar case, and\r\nFabricius ab Aquapendente noticed a case in which the opening in the\r\nthorax showed immediate signs of improvement after the patient voided\r\nlarge quantities of bloody urine. Glandorp also calls attention to the\r\nforegoing facts. Nicolaus Novocomensis narrates the details of the case\r\nof one of his friends, suffering from a penetrating wound of the\r\nthorax, who was relieved and ultimately cured by a bloody evacuation\r\nwith the stool.\r\n\r\nThere is an extraordinary recovery reported in a boy of fifteen who, by\r\nfalling into the machinery of an elevator, was severely injured about\r\nthe chest. There were six extensive lacerations, five through the skin\r\nabout six inches long, and one through the chest about eight inches\r\nlong. The 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs were fractured and torn apart, and\r\nabout an inch of the substance of the 4th rib was lost. Several jagged\r\nfragments were removed; a portion of the pleura, two by four inches,\r\nhad been torn away, exposing the pericardium and the left lung, and\r\nshowing the former to have been penetrated and the latter torn. The\r\nlung collapsed completely, and for three or four months no air seemed\r\nto enter it, but respiration gradually returned. The lacerated\r\nintegument could only be closed approximately by sutures. It is worthy\r\nof remark that, although extremely pale, the patient complained of but\r\nlittle pain, and exhibited only slight symptoms of shock. The pleural\r\ncavity subsequently filled with a dirty serum, but even this did not\r\ninterfere with the healing of the wound and the restoration of the\r\nlung; the patient recovered without lateral curvature.\r\n\r\nBartholf reports a case of rapid recovery after perforating wound of\r\nthe lung. The pistol-ball entered the back 1 1/2 inches to the right of\r\nthe spinous process of the 6th dorsal vertebra, and passed upward and\r\nvery slightly inward toward the median line.  Its track could be\r\nfollowed only 1 1/4 inches. Emphysema appeared fifteen minutes after\r\nthe reception of the wound, and soon became pronounced throughout the\r\nfront and side of the neck, a little over the edge of the lower jaw,\r\nand on the chest two inches below the sternum and one inch below the\r\nclavicle. In four hours respiration became very frequent, short, and\r\ngasping, the thoracic walls and the abdomen scarcely moving. The man\r\ncontinued to improve rapidly, the emphysema disappeared on the seventh\r\nday, and eighteen days after the reception of the wound he was\r\ndischarged. There was slight hemorrhage from the wound at the time, but\r\nthe clot dried and closed the wound, and remained there until it was\r\nremoved on the morning of his discharge, leaving a small, dry, white\r\ncicatrix.\r\n\r\nLoss of Lung-tissue.--The old Amsterdam authority, Tulpius, has\r\nrecorded a case in which a piece of lung of about three fingers'\r\nbreadth protruded through a large wound of the lung under the left\r\nnipple. This wound received no medical attention for forty-eight hours,\r\nwhen the protruding portion of lung was thought to be dead, and was\r\nligated and cut off; it weighed about three ounces. In about two weeks\r\nthe wound healed with the lung adherent to it and this condition was\r\nfound six years later at the necropsy of this individual. Tulpius\r\nquoted Celaus and Hippocrates as authorities for the surgical treatment\r\nof this case. In 1787 Bell gave an account of a case in which a large\r\nportion of the lung protruded and was strangulated by the edges of the\r\nthoracic wound, yet the patient made a good recovery.  Fabricius\r\nHildanus and Ruysch record instances of recovery in which large pieces\r\nof lung have been cut off; and it is said that with General Wolfe at\r\nQuebec there was another officer who was shot through the thorax and\r\nwho recovered after the removal of a portion of the lung. In a letter\r\nto one of his medical friends Roscius says that he succeeded in cutting\r\noff part of a protruding, livid, and gangrenous lung, after a\r\npenetrating wound of the chest, with a successful result. Hale reports\r\na case of a penetrating stab-wound in which a piece of lung was removed\r\nfrom a man of twenty-five.\r\n\r\nTait claims that surgical treatment, as exemplified by Biondi's\r\nexperiment in removing portions of lung from animals, such as dogs,\r\nsheep, cats, etc., is not practical; he adds that his deductions are\r\nmisleading, as the operation was done on healthy tissue and in deep and\r\nnarrow-chested animals. Excision of diseased portions of the lung has\r\nbeen practised by Kronlein (three cases), Ruggi of Bologna (two cases),\r\nBlock, Milton, Weinlechner; one of Kronlein's patients recovered and\r\nMilton's survived four months, but the others promptly succumbed after\r\nthe operation. Tuffier is quoted as showing a patient, aged\r\ntwenty-nine, upon whom, for beginning tuberculosis, he had performed\r\npneumonectomy four years before. At the operation he had removed the\r\ndiseased area at the apex of the right lung, together with sound tissue\r\nfor two cm. in every direction.  Tuffier stated that the result of his\r\noperation had been perfectly successful and the patient had shown no\r\nsuspicious symptoms since.\r\n\r\nRupture of the Lung Without Fracture.--It is quite possible for the\r\nlung to be ruptured by external violence without fracture of the ribs;\r\nthere are several such cases on record. The mechanism of this rare and\r\nfatal form of injury has been very aptly described by Gosselin as due\r\nto a sudden pressure exerted on the thoracic wall at the moment of full\r\ninspiration, there being a spasm of the glottis or obstruction of the\r\nlarynx, in consequence of which the lung bursts. An extravasation of\r\nair occurs, resulting in the development of emphysema, pneumothorax,\r\netc.  Subsequently pleurisy, pneumonia, or even pus in the pleural\r\ncavity often result. Hemoptysis is a possible, but not a marked\r\nsymptom. The mechanism is identical with that of the bursting of an\r\ninflated paper bag when struck by the hand. Other observers discard\r\nthis theory of M. Gosselin and claim that the rupture is due to direct\r\npressure, as in the cases in which the heart is ruptured without\r\nfracture of the ribs. The theory of Gosselin would not explain these\r\ncardiac ruptures from external violence on the thoracic walls, and,\r\ntherefore, was rejected by some.  Pare, Morgagni, Portal, Hewson Smith,\r\nDupuytren, Laennec, and others mention this injury. Gosselin reports\r\ntwo cases terminating in recovery. Ashurst reports having seen three\r\ncases, all of which terminated fatally before the fifth day; he has\r\ncollected the histories of 39 cases, of which 12 recovered. Otis has\r\ncollected reports of 25 cases of this form of injury from military\r\npractice exclusively. These were generally caused by a blow on the\r\nchest, by a piece of shell, or other like missile.  Among the 25 cases\r\nthere were 11 recoveries. As Ashhurst very justly remarks, this injury\r\nappears more fatal in civil than in military life.\r\n\r\nPyle reports a case successfully treated, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Lewis W., ten years old, white, born in Maryland, and living now in\r\nthe District of Columbia, was brought in by the Emergency Hospital\r\nambulance, on the afternoon of November 10th, with a history of having\r\nbeen run over by a hose-cart of the District Fire Department. The boy\r\nwas in a state of extreme shock, having a weak, almost imperceptible\r\npulse; his respirations were shallow and rapid, and his temperature\r\nsubnormal. There were no signs of external injury about his thoracic\r\ncavity and no fracture of the ribs could be detected, although\r\ncarefully searched for; there was marked emphysema; the neck and side\r\nof the face were enormously swollen with the extravasated air; the\r\ntissues of the left arm were greatly infiltrated with air, which\r\nenabled us to elicit the familiar crepitus of such infiltration when an\r\nattempt at the determination of the radial pulse was made.\r\nConsciousness was never lost. There were several injuries to the face\r\nand scalp; and there was hemorrhage from the nose and mouth, which was\r\nattributed to the fact that the patient had fallen on his face,\r\nstriking both nose and lip. This was confirmed subsequently by the\r\nabsence of any evidences of hemoptysis during the whole period of\r\nconvalescence. The saliva was not even blood-streaked; therefore, it\r\ncan be said with verity that there was no hemoptysis. Shortly after\r\nadmission the patient reacted to the stimulating treatment, his pulse\r\nbecame stronger, and all evidences of threatened collapse disappeared.\r\nHe rested well the first night and complained of no pain, then or\r\nsubsequently. The improvement was continuous. The temperature remained\r\nnormal until the evening of the fifth day, when it rose to 102.2\r\ndegrees, end again, on the evening of the sixth, to 102.3 degrees. This\r\nrise was apparently without significance as the patient at no time\r\nseemed disturbed by it. On the eighth day the temperature again reached\r\nthe normal and has since remained there. The boy is apparently well\r\nnow, suffers no inconvenience, and has left the hospital, safe from\r\ndanger and apparently free from any pulmonary embarrassment. He uses\r\nwell-developed diaphragmatic breathing which is fully sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nPollock reports the case of a boy of seven, whose lung was ruptured by\r\na four-wheeled cab which ran over him. He was discharged well in\r\nthirty-two days. Bouilly speaks of recovery in a boy of seventeen,\r\nafter a rupture of the lung without fracture.  There are several other\r\ninteresting cases of recovery on record.\r\n\r\nThere are instances of spontaneous rupture of the lung, from severe\r\ncough. Hicks speaks of a child of ten months suffering with a severe\r\ncough resembling pertussis, whose lung ruptured about two weeks after\r\nthe beginning of the cough, causing death on the second day. Ferrari\r\nrelates a curious case of rupture of the lung from deep inspiration.\r\n\r\nComplete penetration or transfixion of the thoracic cavity is not\r\nnecessarily fatal, and some marvelous instances of recovery after\r\ninjuries of this nature, are recorded. Eve remarks that General Shields\r\nwas shot through the body by a discharge of a cannon at Cerro Gordo,\r\nand was given up as certain to die. The General himself thought it was\r\ngrape-shot that traversed his chest. He showed no signs of hemoptysis,\r\nand although in great pain, was able to give commands after reception\r\nof the wound. In this case, the ball had evidently entered within the\r\nright nipple, had passed between the lungs, through the mediastinum,\r\nemerging slightly to the right of the spine. Guthrie has mentioned a\r\nparallel instance of a ball traversing the thoracic cavity, the patient\r\ncompletely recovering after treatment. Girard, Weeds, Meacham, Bacon,\r\nFryer and others report cases of perforating gunshot wounds of the\r\nchest with recovery.\r\n\r\nSewell describes a case of transfixion of the chest in a youth of\r\neighteen. After mowing and while carrying his scythe home, the patient\r\naccidentally fell on the blade; the point passed under the right\r\naxilla, between the 3d and 4th right ribs, horizontally through the\r\nchest, and came out through corresponding ribs of the opposite side,\r\nmaking a small opening. He fell to the ground and lay still until his\r\nbrother came to his assistance; the latter with great forethought and\r\ncaution carefully calculated the curvature of the scythe blade, and\r\nthus regulating his direction of tension, successfully withdrew the\r\ninstrument. There was but little hemoptysis and the patient soon\r\nrecovered. Chelius records an instance of penetration of the chest by a\r\ncarriage shaft, with subsequent recovery. Hoyland mentions a man of\r\ntwenty-five who was discharging bar-iron from the hold of a ship; in a\r\nstooping position, preparatory to hoisting a bundle on deck, he was\r\nstruck by one of the bars which pinned him to the floor of the hold,\r\npenetrating the thorax, and going into the wood of the flooring to the\r\nextent of three inches, requiring the combined efforts of three men to\r\nextract it. The bar had entered posteriorly between the 9th and 10th\r\nribs of the left side, and had traversed the thorax in an upward and\r\noutward direction, coming out anteriorly between the 5th and 6th ribs,\r\nabout an inch below and slightly external to the nipple. There was\r\nlittle constitutional disturbance, and the man was soon discharged\r\ncured. Brown records a case of impalement in a boy of fourteen. While\r\nrunning to a fire, he struck the point of the shaft of a carriage,\r\nwhich passed through his left chest, below the nipple. There was,\r\nstrangely, no hemorrhage, and no symptoms of so severe an injury; the\r\nboy recovered.\r\n\r\nThere is deposited in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in\r\nLondon, a mast-pivot, 15 inches in length and weighing between seven\r\nand eight pounds, which had passed obliquely through the body of a\r\nsailor. The specimen is accompanied by a colored picture of the\r\nsufferer himself in two positions. The name of the sailor was Taylor,\r\nand the accident occurred aboard a brig lying in the London docks. One\r\nof Taylor's mates was guiding the pivot of the try-sail into the main\r\nboom, when a tackle gave way. The pivot instantly left the man's hand,\r\nshot through the air point downward striking Taylor above the heart,\r\npassing out lower down posteriorly, and then imbedded itself in the\r\ndeck. The unfortunate subject was carried at once to the London\r\nHospital, and notwithstanding his transfixion by so formidable an\r\ninstrument, in five months Taylor had recovered sufficiently to walk,\r\nand ultimately returned to his duties as a seaman.\r\n\r\nIn the same museum, near to this spike, is the portion of a shaft of\r\nthe carriage which passed through the body of a gentleman who happened\r\nto be standing near the vehicle when the horse plunged violently\r\nforward, with the result that the off shaft penetrated his body under\r\nthe left arm, and came out from under the right arm, pinning the\r\nunfortunate man to the stable door. Immediately after the accident the\r\npatient walked upstairs and got in bed; his recovery progressed\r\nuninterruptedly, and his wounds were practically healed at the end of\r\nnine weeks; he is reported to have lived eleven years after this\r\nterrible accident.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Medical Gazette there is an account of a private of\r\nthirty-five, who was thrown forward and off his horse while endeavoring\r\nto mount. He fell on a lance which penetrated his chest and came out\r\nthrough the scapula. The horse ran for about 100 yards, the man hanging\r\non and trying to stop him. After the extraction of the lance the\r\npatient recovered. Longmore gives an instance of complete transfixion\r\nby a lance of the right side of the chest and lung, the patient\r\nrecovering. Ruddock mentions cases of penetrating wounds of both lungs\r\nwith recovery.\r\n\r\nThere is a most remarkable instance of recovery after major thoracic\r\nwounds recorded by Brokaw. In a brawl, a shipping clerk received a\r\nthoracic wound extending from the 3d rib to within an inch of the\r\nnavel, 13 1/2 inches long, completely severing all the muscular and\r\ncartilaginous structures, including the cartilages of the ribs from the\r\n4th to the 9th, and wounding the pleura and lung. In addition there was\r\nan abdominal wound 6 1/2 inches long, extending from the navel to about\r\ntwo inches above Poupart's ligament, causing almost complete intestinal\r\nevisceration. The lung was partially collapsed. The cartilages were\r\nligated with heavy silk, and the hemorrhage checked by ligature and by\r\npacking gauze in the inter-chondral spaces. The patient speedily\r\nrecovered, and was discharged in a little over a month, the only\r\ndisastrous result of his extraordinary injuries being a small ventral\r\nhernia.\r\n\r\nIn wounds of the diaphragm, particularly those from stabs and gunshot\r\ninjuries, death is generally due to accompanying lesions rather than to\r\ninjury. Hollerius, and Alexander Benedictus, made a favorable diagnosis\r\nof wounds made in the fleshy portions of the diaphragm, but despaired\r\nof those in the tendinous portions.  Bertrand, Fabricius Hildanus, la\r\nMotte, Ravaton, Valentini, and Glandorp, record instances of recovery\r\nfrom wounds of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThere are some peculiar causes of diaphragmatic injuries on record,\r\nlaughter, prolonged vomiting, excessive eating, etc., being mentioned.\r\nOn the other hand, in his \"Essay on Laughter (du Ris),\" Joubert quotes\r\na case in which involuntary laughter was caused by a wound of the\r\ndiaphragm; the laughter mentioned in this instance was probably caused\r\nby convulsive movements of the diaphragm, due to some unknown\r\nirritation of the phrenic nerve.  Bremuse gives an account of a man who\r\nliterally split his diaphragm in two by the ingestion of four plates of\r\npotato soup, numerous cups of tea and milk, followed by a large dose of\r\nsodium bicarbonate to aid digestion. After this meal his stomach\r\nswelled to an enormous extent and tore the diaphragm on the right side,\r\ncausing immediate death.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm may be ruptured by external violence (a fall on the chest\r\nor abdomen), or by violent squeezing (railroad accidents, etc.), or\r\naccording to Ashhurst, by spasmodic contraction of the part itself. If\r\nthe injury is unaccompanied by lesion of the abdominal or thoracic\r\nviscera, the prognosis is not so unfavorable as might be supposed.\r\nUnless the laceration is extremely small, protrusion of the stomach or\r\nsome other viscera into the thoracic cavity will almost invariably\r\nresult, constituting the condition known as internal or diaphragmatic\r\nhernia. Pare relates the case of a Captain who was shot through the\r\nfleshy portion of the diaphragm, and though the wound was apparently\r\nhealed, the patient complained of a colicky pain.  Eight months\r\nafterward the patient died in a violent paroxysm of this pain. At the\r\npostmortem by Guillemeau, a man of great eminence and a pupil of Pare,\r\na part of the colon was found in the thorax, having passed through a\r\nwound in the diaphragm. Gooch saw a similar case, but no history of the\r\ninjury could be obtained. Bausch mentions a case in which the omentum,\r\nstomach, and pancreas were found in the thoracic cavity, having\r\nprotruded through an extensive opening in the diaphragm. Muys, Bonnet,\r\nBlancard, Schenck, Sennert, Fantoni, and Godefroy record instances in\r\nwhich, after rupture of the diaphragm, the viscera have been found in\r\nthe thorax; there are many modern cases on record. Internal hernia\r\nthrough the diaphragm is mentioned by Cooper, Bowles, Fothergill,\r\nMonro, Ballonius, Derrecagiax, and Schmidt. Sir Astley Cooper mentioned\r\na case of hernia ventriculi from external violence, wherein the\r\ndiaphragm was lacerated without any fracture of the ribs. The man was\r\naged twenty-seven, and being an outside passenger on a coach (and also\r\nintoxicated), when it broke down he was projected some distance,\r\nstriking the ground with considerable force. He died on the next day,\r\nand the diagnosis was verified at the necropsy, the opening in the\r\ndiaphragm causing stricture of the bowel.\r\n\r\nPostempski successfully treated a wound of the diaphragm complicated\r\nwith a wound of the omentum, which protruded between the external\r\nopening between the 10th and 11th ribs; he enlarged the wound, forced\r\nthe ribs apart, ligated and cut off part of the omentum, returned its\r\nstump to the abdomen, and finally closed both the wound in the\r\ndiaphragm and the external wound with sutures. Quoted by Ashhurst,\r\nHunter recorded a case of gunshot wound, in which, after penetrating\r\nthe stomach, bowels, and diaphragm the ball lodged in the thoracic\r\ncavity, causing no difficulty in breathing until shortly before death,\r\nand even then the dyspnea was mechanical--from gaseous distention of\r\nthe intestines.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis in the thoracic cavity is a curious condition which may be\r\nbrought about by a penetrating wound of the diaphragm. In 1872 Sargent\r\ncommunicated to the Boston Society for Medical Improvement an account\r\nof a postmortem examination of a woman of thirty-seven, in whom he had\r\nobserved major injuries twenty years before. At that time, while\r\nsliding down some hay from a loft, she was impaled on the handle of a\r\npitchfork which entered the vagina, penetrated 22 inches, and was\r\narrested by an upper left rib, which it fractured; further penetration\r\nwas possibly prevented by the woman's feet striking the floor. Happily\r\nthere was no injury to the bladder, uterus, or intestines. The\r\nprincipal symptoms were hemorrhage from the vagina and intense pain\r\nnear the fractured rib, followed by emphysema. The pitchfork-handle was\r\nwithdrawn, and was afterward placed in the museum of the Society, the\r\nabrupt bloody stain, 22 inches from the rounded end, being plainly\r\nshown. During twenty years the woman could never lie on her right side\r\nor on her back, and for half of this time she spent most of the night\r\nin the sitting position. Her last illness attracted little attention\r\nbecause her life had been one of suffering. After death it was found\r\nthat the cavity in the left side of the chest was entirely filled with\r\nabdominal viscera. The opening in the diaphragm was four inches in\r\ndiameter, and through it had passed the stomach, transverse colon, a\r\nfew inches of the descending colon, and a considerable portion of the\r\nsmall intestines. The heart was crowded to the right of the sternum and\r\nwas perfectly healthy, as was also the right lung. The left lung was\r\ncompressed to the size of a hand.  There were marked signs of\r\nperitonitis, and in the absence of sufficient other symptoms, it could\r\nbe said that this woman had died of peritonitis in the left thoracic\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nExtended tolerance of foreign bodies loose in the thoracic cavity has\r\nbeen noticed. Tulpins mentions a person who had a sponge shut up in his\r\nthoracic cavity for six weeks; it was then voided by the mouth, and the\r\nman recovered. Fabricius Hildanus relates a similar instance in which a\r\nsponge-tent was expelled by coughing.  Arnot reports a case in which a\r\npiece of iron was found in a cyst in the thorax, where it had remained\r\nfor fourteen years. Leach gives a case in which a bullet was impacted\r\nin the chest for forty-two years. Snyder speaks of a fragment of\r\nknife-blade which was lodged in the chest twelve years and finally\r\ncoughed up.\r\n\r\nForeign Bodies in the Bronchi.--Walnut kernels, coins, seeds, beans,\r\ncorks, and even sponges have been removed from the bronchi. In the\r\npresence of Sir Morrell Mackenzie, Johnston of Baltimore removed a toy\r\nlocomotive from the subglottic cavity by tracheotomy and thyreotomy.\r\nThe child had gone to sleep with the toy in his mouth and had\r\nsubsequently swallowed it. Eldredge presented a hopeless consumptive,\r\nwho as a child of five had swallowed an umbrella ferrule while\r\nwhistling through it, and who expelled it in a fit of coughing\r\ntwenty-three years after. Eve of Nashville mentions a boy who placed a\r\nfourpenny nail in a spool to make a whistle, and, by a violent\r\ninspiration, drew the nail deep into the left bronchus. It was removed\r\nby tracheotomy.  Liston removed a large piece of bone from the right\r\nbronchus of a woman, and Houston tells of a case in which a molar tooth\r\nwas lodged in a bronchus causing death on the eleventh day. Warren\r\nmentions spontaneous expulsion of a horse-shoe nail from the bronchus\r\nof a boy of two and one-half years. From Dublin, in 1844, Houston\r\nreports the case of a girl of sixteen who inhaled the wooden peg of a\r\nsmall fiddle and in a fit of coughing three months afterward expelled\r\nit from the lungs. In 1849 Solly communicated the case of a man who\r\ninhaled a pebble placed on his tongue to relieve thirst. On removal\r\nthis pebble weighed 144 grains. Watson of Murfreesboro removed a\r\nportion of an umbrella rib from a trachea, but as he failed to locate\r\nor remove the ferrule, the case terminated fatally. Brigham mentions a\r\nchild of five who was seized with a fit of coughing while she had a\r\nsmall brass nail in her mouth; pulmonary phthisis ensued, and in one\r\nyear she died. At the postmortem examination the nail was found near\r\nthe bifurcation of the right bronchus, and, although colored black, was\r\nnot corroded.\r\n\r\nMarcacci reported an observation of the removal of a bean from the\r\nbronchus of a child of three and a half years. The child swallowed the\r\nbean while playing, immediately cried, and became hoarse. No one having\r\nnoticed the accident, a diagnosis of croup was made and four leeches\r\nwere applied to the neck. The dyspnea augmented during the night, and\r\nthere was a whistling sound with each respiratory movement. On the next\r\nday the medical attendants suggested the possibility of a foreign body\r\nin the larynx.  Tracheotomy was performed but the dyspnea continued,\r\nshowing that the foreign body was lodged below the incision. The blood\r\nof one of the cut vessels entered the trachea and caused an extra\r\nparoxysm of dyspnea, but the clots of blood were removed by curved\r\nforceps. Marcacci fils practised suction, and placed the child on its\r\nhead, but in vain. A feather was then introduced in the wound with the\r\nhope that it would clean the trachea and provoke respiration; when the\r\nfeather was withdrawn the bean followed. The child was much\r\nasphyxiated, however, and five or six minutes elapsed before the first\r\ndeep inspiration. The wound was closed, the child recovered its voice,\r\nand was well four days afterward. Annandale saw a little patient who\r\nhad swallowed a bead of glass, which had lodged in the bronchus. He\r\nintroduced the handle of a scalpel into the trachea, producing\r\nsufficient irritation to provoke a brusque expiration, and at the\r\nsecond attempt the foreign body was expelled. Hulke records the case of\r\na woman, the victim of a peculiar accident happening during the\r\nperformance of tracheotomy, for an affection of the larynx. The\r\ninternal canule of the tracheotomy-tube fell into the right bronchus,\r\nbut was removed by an ingenious instrument extemporaneously devised\r\nfrom silver wire. A few years ago in this country there was much public\r\nexcitement and newspaper discussion over the daily reports which came\r\nfrom the bedside of a gentleman who had swallowed a cork, and which had\r\nbecome lodged in a bronchus. Tracheotomy was performed and a special\r\ncorkscrew devised to extract it, but unfortunately the patient died of\r\nslow asphyxiation and exhaustion. Herrick mentions the case of a boy of\r\nfourteen months who swallowed a shawl-pin two inches long, which\r\nremained in the lungs four years, during which time there was a\r\nconstant dry and spasmodic cough, and corresponding depression and\r\nemaciation. When it was ultimately coughed up it appeared in one large\r\npiece and several smaller ones, and was so corroded as to be very\r\nbrittle. After dislodgment of the pin there was subsidence of the cough\r\nand rapid recovery.\r\n\r\nLapeyre mentions an elderly gentleman who received a sudden slap on the\r\nback while smoking a cigarette, causing him to start and take a very\r\ndeep inspiration. The cigarette was drawn into the right bronchus,\r\nwhere it remained for two months without causing symptoms or revealing\r\nits presence. It then set up a circumscribed pneumonia and cardiac\r\ndropsy which continued two months longer, at which time, during a\r\nviolent fit of coughing, the cigarette was expelled enveloped in a\r\nwaxy, mucus-like matter. Louis relates the case of a man who carried a\r\nlouis-d'or in his lung for six and a half years.\r\n\r\nThere is a case on record of a man who received a gunshot wound, the\r\nball entering behind the left clavicle and passing downward and across\r\nto the right clavicle. Sometime afterward this patient expectorated two\r\npieces of bone and a piece of gum blanket in which he was enveloped at\r\nthe time of the injury. Carpenter describes a case of fatal pleuritis,\r\napparently due to the presence of four artificial teeth which had been\r\nswallowed thirteen years before.\r\n\r\nCardiac Injuries.--For ages it has been the common opinion relative to\r\ninjuries of the heart that they are necessarily fatal and that, as a\r\nrule, death immediately follows their reception.  Notwithstanding this\r\ncurrent belief a careful examination of the literature of medicine\r\npresents an astounding number of cases in which the heart has been\r\npositively wounded, and the patients have lived days, months, and even\r\nrecovered; postmortem examination, by revealing the presence of\r\ncicatrices in the heart, confirming the original diagnosis. This\r\nquestion is one of great interest as, in recent years, there has been\r\nconstant agitation of the possibility of surgical procedures in cardiac\r\nas well as cerebral injuries. Del Vecchio has reported a series of\r\nexperiments on dogs with the conclusion that in case of wounds in human\r\nbeings suture of the heart is a possible operation. In this connection\r\nhe proposes the following operative procedure: Two longitudinal\r\nincisions to be made from the lower border of the 3d rib to the upper\r\nborder of the 7th rib, one running along the inner margin of the\r\nsternum, the other about ten mm. inside the nipple-line. These\r\nincisions are joined by a horizontal cut made in the fourth intercostal\r\nspace. The 4th, 5th, and 6th ribs and cartilages are divided and the\r\nouter cutaneous flaps turned up; pushing aside the pleura with the\r\nfinger, expose the pericardium and incise it longitudinally; suture the\r\nheart-wound by interrupted sutures. Del Vecchio adds that Fischer has\r\ncollected records of 376 cases of wounds of the heart with a mortality\r\ntwo to three minutes after the injury of 20 per cent. Death may occur\r\nfrom a few seconds to nine months after the accident. Keen and Da Costa\r\nquote Del Vecchio, and, in comment on his observations, remark that\r\ndeath in cases of wound of the heart is due to pressure of effused\r\nblood in the pericardial sac, and, because this pressure is itself a\r\ncheek to further hemorrhage, there seems, as far as hemorrhage is\r\nconcerned, to be rather a question whether operative interference may\r\nnot be itself more harmful than beneficial. It might be added that the\r\nshock to the cardiac action might be sufficient to check it, and at\r\npresent we would have no sure means of starting pulsation if once\r\nstopped. In heart-injuries, paracentesis, followed, if necessary, by\r\nincision of the pericardium, is advised by some surgeons.\r\n\r\nRealizing the fatality of injuries of the heart, in consequence of\r\nwhich almost any chance by operation should be quickly seized by\r\nsurgeons rather than trust the lives of patients to the infinitesimal\r\nchance of recovery, it would seem that the profession should carefully\r\nconsider and discuss the feasibility of any procedure in this\r\ndirection, no matter how hypothetic.\r\n\r\nHall states that his experience in the study of cardiac wounds, chiefly\r\non game-animals, would lead him to the conclusion that transverse\r\nwounds the lower portions of the heart, giving rise to punctures rather\r\nthan extensive lacerations, do not commonly cause cessation of life for\r\na time varying from some considerable fraction of a minute to many\r\nminutes or even hours, and especially if the puncture be valvular in\r\ncharacter, so as to prevent the loss of much blood. However, if the\r\nwound involve the base of the organ, with extensive laceration of the\r\nsurrounding parts, death is practically instantaneous. It would seem\r\nthat injury to the muscular walls of the heart is much less efficient\r\nin the production of immediate death than destruction of the cardiac\r\nnervous mechanism, serious irritation of the latter producing almost\r\ninstantaneous death from shock. In addition, Hall cites several of the\r\ninstances on which he based his conclusions. He mentions two wild geese\r\nwhich flew respectively 1/4 and 3/4 of a mile after having been shot\r\nthrough the heart, each with a pellet of BB shot, the base in each\r\ninstance being uninjured; in several instances antelope and deer ran\r\nseveral rods after being shot with a rifle ball in a similar manner; on\r\nthe other hand, death was practically instantaneous in several of these\r\nanimals in which the base of the heart was extensively lacerated.\r\nAgain, death may result instantaneously from wounds of the precordial\r\nregion, or according to Erichsen, if held directly over the heart, from\r\nthe discharge of a pistol containing powder alone, a result\r\noccasionally seen after a blow on the precordial region. It is well,\r\nhowever, to state that in times of excitement, one may receive an\r\ninjury which will shortly prove fatal, and yet not be aware of the fact\r\nfor some time, perhaps even for several minutes. It would appear that\r\nthe nervous system is so highly tuned at such times, that it does not\r\nrespond to reflex irritations as readily as in the absence of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nInstances of Survival after Cardiac Injuries.--We briefly cite the\r\nprincipal interesting instances of cardiac injuries in which death has\r\nbeen delayed for some time, or from which the patient ultimately\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nPare relates the case of a soldier who received a blow from a halberd,\r\npenetrating the left ventricle, and who walked to the surgeon's tent to\r\nhave his wound dressed and then to his own tent 260 yards away.\r\nDiemerbroeck mentions two instances of long survival after cardiac\r\ninjuries, in one of which the patient ran 60 paces after receiving the\r\nwound, had complete composure of mind, and survived nine days. There is\r\nan instance in which a man ran 400 paces after penetration of the left\r\nventricle, and lived for five hours. Morand gives an instance of\r\nsurvival for five days after wound of the right ventricle. Saucerotte\r\nspeaks of survival for three days after injury to the heart.\r\n\r\nBabington speaks of a case of heart-injury, caused by transfixion by a\r\nbayonet, in which the patient survived nine hours. Other older cases\r\nare as follows: l'Ecluse, seven days; the Ephemerides, four and six\r\ndays; Col de Vilars, twelve days; Marcucci, eighteen days; Bartholinus,\r\nfive days; Durande, five days; Boyer, five days; Capelle, twenty six\r\nhours; Fahner, eleven days; Marigues, thirteen days; Morgagni, eight\r\ndays; la Motte, twelve hours; Rhodius, Riedlin, two days; Saviard,\r\neleven days; Sennert, three days; Triller, fourteen days; and Tulpius,\r\ntwo and fifteen days; and Zittman, eight days.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Berri, heir to the French throne, who was assassinated in\r\n1826, lived several hours with one of his ventricles opened.  His\r\nsurgeon, Dupuytren, was reprimanded for keeping the wound open with a\r\nprobe introduced every two hours, but this procedure has its advocates\r\nat the present day. Randall mentions a gunshot wound of the right\r\nventricle which did not cause death until the sixty-seventh day. Grant\r\ndescribes a wound in which a ball from a revolver entered a little to\r\nthe right of the sternum, between the cartilages of the 5th and 6th\r\nribs, and then entered the right ventricle about an inch from the apex.\r\nIt emerged from the lower part, passed through the diaphragm, the\r\ncardiac end of the stomach, and lodged in the left kidney. The patient\r\nremained in a state of collapse fifteen hours after being shot, and\r\nwith little or no nourishment lived twenty-six days. At the postmortem\r\nexamination the wounds in the organs were found to be healed, but the\r\ncicatrices were quite evident. Bowling gives a case of gunshot wound of\r\nthe shoulder in which death resulted eleven weeks after, the bullet\r\nbeing found in the left ventricle of the heart. Thompson has reported a\r\nbayonet wound of the heart, after the reception of which the patient\r\nlived four days. The bayonet entered the ventricle about 1 1/2 inches\r\nfrom the left apex, traversing the left wall obliquely, and making exit\r\nclose to the septum ventriculorum. Roberts mentions a man who ran 60\r\nyards and lived one hour after being shot through both lungs and the\r\nright auricle. Curran mentions the case of a soldier who, in 1809, was\r\nwounded by a bullet which entered his body to the left of the sternum,\r\nbetween the 2d and 3d ribs. He was insensible a half hour, and was\r\ncarried aboard a fighting ship crowded with sailors. There was little\r\nhemorrhage from his wound, and he survived fourteen days. At the\r\npostmortem examination some interesting facts were revealed. It was\r\nfound that the right ventricle was transversely opened for about an\r\ninch, the ball having penetrated its anterior surface, near the origin\r\nof the pulmonary artery. The ball was found loose in the pericardium,\r\nwhere it had fallen during the necropsy. There was a circular lacerated\r\nopening in the tricuspid valve, and the ball must have been in the\r\nright auricle during the fourteen days in which the man lived. Vite\r\nmentions an example of remarkable tenacity of life after reception of a\r\ncardiac wound, the subject living four days after a knife-wound\r\npenetrating the chest into the pericardial sac and passing through the\r\nleft ventricle of the heart into the opposite wall. Boone speaks of a\r\ngunshot wound in which death was postponed until the thirteenth day.\r\nBullock mentions a case of gunshot wound in which the ball was found\r\nlodged in the cavity of the ventricle four days and eighteen hours\r\nafter infliction of the wound. Carnochan describes a penetrating wound\r\nof the heart in a subject in whom life had been protracted eleven days.\r\nAfter death the bullet was found buried and encysted in the heart.\r\nHolly reports a case of pistol-shot wound through the right ventricle,\r\nseptum, and aorta, with the ball in the left ventricle. There was\r\napparent recovery in fourteen days and sudden death on the fifty-fifth\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHamilton gives an instance of a shoemaker sixty-three years old who,\r\nwhile carrying a bundle, fell with rupture of the heart and lived\r\nseveral minutes. On postmortem examination an opening in the heart was\r\nfound large enough to admit a blowpipe. Noble speaks of duration of\r\nlife for five and a half days after rupture of the heart; and there are\r\ninstances on record in which life has been prolonged for thirteen hours\r\nand for fifty-three hours after a similar injury. Glazebrook reports\r\nthe case of a colored man of thirty, of powerful physique, who was\r\nadmitted to the Freedmen's Hospital, Washington, D.C., at 12.30 A.M.,\r\non February 5, 1895.  Upon examination by the surgeons, an incised\r\nwound was discovered one inch above the left nipple, 3 1/4 inches to\r\nthe left of the median line, the incision being 2 1/4 inches in length\r\nand its direction parallel with the 3d rib. The man's general condition\r\nwas fairly good, and the wound was examined. It was impossible to trace\r\nits depth further than the 3d rib, although probing was resorted to; it\r\nwas therefore considered a simple wound, and dressed accordingly.\r\nTwelve hours later symptoms of internal hemorrhage were noticed, and at\r\n8 A.M., February 6th, the man died after surviving his injury\r\nthirty-two hours. A necropsy was held three hours after death, and an\r\noblique incision 3/4 inch in length was found through the cartilage-end\r\nof the 3d rib. A similar wound was next found in the pericardium, and\r\nupon examining the heart there was seen a clean, incised wound 1/2 inch\r\nin length, directly into the right ventricle, the endocardial wound\r\nbeing 3/8 inch long. Both the pericardium and left pleura were\r\ndistended with fresh blood and large clots.  Church reports a case of\r\ngunshot wound of the heart in a man of sixty-seven who survived three\r\nhours. The wound had been made by a pistol bullet (32 caliber), was\r\nsituated 1 1/4 inches below the mammary line, and slightly to the left\r\nof the center of the sternum; through it considerable blood had\r\nescaped. The postmortem examination showed that the ball had pierced\r\nthe sternum just above the xiphoid cartilage, and had entered the\r\npericardium to the right and at the lower part. The sac was filled with\r\nblood, both fresh and clotted. There was a ragged wound in the anterior\r\nwall 1/2 inch in diameter. The wound of exit was 5/8 inch in diameter.\r\nAfter traversing the heart the ball had penetrated the diaphragm,\r\nwounded the omentum in several places, and become lodged under the skin\r\nposteriorly between the 9th and 10th ribs. Church adds that the \"Index\r\nCatalogue of the Surgeon-General's Library\" at Washington contains 22\r\ncases of direct injury to the heart, all of which lived longer than his\r\ncase: 17 lived over three days; eight lived over ten days; two lived\r\nover twenty-five days; one died on the fifty-fifth day, and there were\r\nthree well-authenticated recoveries. Purple tabulates a list of 42\r\ncases of heart-injury which survived from thirty minutes to seventy\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nFourteen instances of gunshot wounds of the heart have been collected\r\nfrom U.S. Army reports, in all of which death followed very promptly,\r\nexcept in one instance in which the patient survived fifty hours. In\r\nanother case the patient lived twenty-six hours after reception of the\r\ninjury, the conical pistol-ball passing through the anterior margin of\r\nthe right lobe of the lung into the pericardium, through the right\r\nauricle, and again entered the right pleural cavity, passing through\r\nthe posterior margin of the lower lobe of the right lung; at the\r\nautopsy it was found in the right pleural cavity. The left lung and\r\ncavity were perfectly normal. The right lung was engorged and somewhat\r\ncompressed by the blood in the pleural cavity. The pericardium was much\r\ndistended and contained from six to eight ounces of partially\r\ncoagulated blood. There was a fibrinous clot in the left ventricle.\r\n\r\nNonfatal Cardiac Injuries.--Wounds of the heart are not necessarily\r\nfatal. Of 401 cases of cardiac injury collected by Fischer there were\r\nas many as 50 recoveries, the diagnosis being confirmed in 33 instances\r\nby an autopsy in which there were found distinct signs of the cardiac\r\ninjury. By a peculiar arrangement of the fibers of the heart, a wound\r\ntransverse to one layer of fibers is in the direction of another layer,\r\nand to a certain extent, therefore, valvular in function; it is\r\nprobably from this fact that punctured wounds of the heart are often\r\nattended with little or no bleeding.\r\n\r\nAmong the older writers, several instances of nonfatal injuries to the\r\nheart are recorded. Before the present century scientists had observed\r\ngame-animals that had been wounded in the heart in the course of their\r\nlives, and after their ultimate death such direct evidence as the\r\npresence of a bullet or an arrow in their hearts was found. Rodericus a\r\nVeiga tells the story of a deer that was killed in hunting, and in\r\nwhose heart was fixed a piece of arrow that appeared to have been there\r\nsome time. Glandorp experimentally produced a nonfatal wound in the\r\nheart of a rabbit. Wounds of the heart, not lethal, have been reported\r\nby Benivenius, Marcellus Donatus, Schott, Stalpart van der Wiel, and\r\nWolff. Ollenrot reports an additional instance of recovery from\r\nheart-injury, but in his case the wound was only superficial.\r\n\r\nThere is a recent case of a boy of fourteen, who was wounded in the\r\nheart by a pen-knife stab. The boy was discharged cured from the\r\nMiddlesex Hospital, but three months after the reception of the injury\r\nhe was taken ill and died. A postmortem examination showed that the\r\nright ventricle had been penetrated in a slanting direction; the cause\r\nof death was apoplexy, produced by the weakening and thinning of the\r\nheart's walls, the effect of the wound. Tillaux reports the case of a\r\nman of sixty-five, the victim of general paralysis, who passed into his\r\nchest a blade 16 cm. long and 2 mm. broad. The wound of puncture was 5\r\ncm. below the nipple and 2 cm. to the outside. The left side of the\r\nchest was emphysematous and ecchymosed. The heart-sounds were regular,\r\nand the elevation of the skin by the blade coincided with the\r\nventricular systole. The blade was removed on the following day, and\r\nthe patient gradually improved. Some thirteen months after he had\r\nexpectoration of blood and pus and soon died. At the necropsy it was\r\nseen that the wound had involved both lungs; the posterior wall of the\r\nventricle and the inferior lobe of the right lung were traversed from\r\nbefore backward, and from left to right, but the ventricular cavity was\r\nnot penetrated. Strange to say, the blade had passed between the\r\nvertebral column and the esophagus, and to the right of the aorta, but\r\nhad wounded neither of these organs.\r\n\r\nO'Connor mentions a graduate of a British University who, with suicidal\r\nintent, transfixed his heart with a darning-needle. It was extracted by\r\na pair of watchmaker's pliers. In five days the symptoms had all\r\nabated, and the would-be suicide was well enough to start for the\r\nContinent. Muhlig was consulted by a mason who, ten years before, had\r\nreceived a blow from a stiletto near the left side of the sternum. The\r\ncicatrix was plainly visible, but the man said he had been able to\r\nperform his daily labors, although at the present time suffering from\r\nintense dyspnea and anasarca. A loud bellows-sound could be heard,\r\nwhich the man said had been audible since the time of reception of the\r\ninjury. This was a double bruit accompanying systole, and entirely\r\nobscuring the physical signs. From this time the man speedily failed,\r\nand after his death there were cicatricial signs found, particularly on\r\nthe wall of the left ventricle, together with patency of the\r\ninterventricular septum, with signs of cicatrization about this rent.\r\nAt the side of the left ventricle the rent was twice as large and lined\r\nwith cicutricial tissue.\r\n\r\nStelzner mentions a young student who attempted suicide by thrusting a\r\ndarning-needle into his heart. He complained of pain and dyspnea; in\r\ntwenty-four hours his symptoms increased to such an extent that\r\noperation was deemed advisable on account of collapse. The 5th rib was\r\nresected and the pleural cavity opened.  When the pericardial sac was\r\nincised, a teaspoonful of turbid fluid oozed out, and the needle was\r\nfelt in an oblique position in the right ventricle. By pressure of a\r\nfinger passed under the heart, the eye of the needle was pressed\r\nthrough the anterior wall and fixed on the operator's finger-nail. An\r\nattempt to remove by the forceps failed, as the violent movements of\r\nthe heart drew the needle back into the cavity. About this stage of the\r\noperation an unfortunate accident happened--the iodoform tampon, which\r\nprotected the exposed pleural cavity, was drawn into this cavity during\r\na deep inspiration, and could not be found. Notwithstanding subsequent\r\npneumothorax and extensive pleuritic effusion, the patient made a good\r\nrecovery at the end of the fourth week and at the time of report it was\r\nstill uncertain whether the needle remained in the heart or had\r\nwandered into the mediastinum. During the discussion which followed the\r\nreport of this case, Hahn showed a portion of a knitting-needle which\r\nhad been removed from the heart of a girl during life. The extraction\r\nwas very slow in order to allow of coagulation along the course of the\r\nwound in the heart, and to guard against hemorrhage into the\r\npericardial sac, which is so often the cause of death in punctured\r\nwounds of this organ. Hahn remarked that the pulse, which before the\r\nremoval had been very rapid, sank to 90.\r\n\r\nMarks reports the case of a stab-wound penetrating the left 9th\r\nintercostal space, the diaphragm, pleura, pericardium, and apex of the\r\nheart. It was necessary to enlarge the wound, and, under an anesthetic,\r\nafter removing one and one-half inches of the 9th and 10th ribs, the\r\nwound was thoroughly packed with iodoform gauze and in twenty-one days\r\nthe patient recovered. Lavender mentions an incised wound of the heart\r\npenetrating the right ventricle, from which the patient recovered.\r\nPurple gives, an account of a recovery from a wound penetrating both\r\nventricles.  The diagnosis was confirmed by a necropsy nine years\r\nthereafter.  Stoll records a nonfatal injury to the heart.\r\n\r\nMastin reports the case of a man of thirty-two who was shot by a\r\n38-caliber Winchester, from an ambush, at a distance of 110 yards. The\r\nball entered near the chest posteriorly on the left side just below and\r\nto the outer angle of the scapula, passed between the 7th and 8th ribs,\r\nand made its exit from the intercostal space of the 4th and 5th ribs, 2\r\n1/4 inches from the nipple. A line drawn from the wound of entrance to\r\nthat of exit would pass exactly through the right ventricle. After\r\nreceiving the wound the man walked about twenty steps, and then,\r\nfeeling very weak from profuse hemorrhage from the front of the wound,\r\nhe sat down. With little or no treatment the wound closed and steady\r\nimprovement set in; the patient was discharged in three weeks. As the\r\nman was still living at last reports, the exact amount of damage done\r\nin the track of the bullet is not known, although Mastin's supposition\r\nis that the heart was penetrated.\r\n\r\nMellichamp speaks of a gunshot wound of the heart with recovery, and\r\nFord records an instance in which a wound of the heart by a buckshot\r\nwas followed by recovery. O'Connor reports a case under his observation\r\nin which a pistol-ball passed through three of the four cavities of the\r\nheart and lodged in the root of the right lung. The patient, a boy of\r\nfifteen, died of the effects of cardiac disease three years and two\r\nmonths later. Bell mentions a case in which, six years after the\r\nreceipt of a gunshot wound of the chest, a ball was found in the right\r\nventricle. Christison speaks of an instance in which a bullet was found\r\nin the heart of a soldier in Bermuda, with no apparent signs of an\r\nopening to account for its entrance. There is a case on record of a boy\r\nof fourteen who was shot in the right shoulder, the bullet entering\r\nthrough the right upper border of the trapezius, two inches from the\r\nacromion process. Those who examined him supposed the ball was lodged\r\nnear the sternal end of the clavicle, four or five inches from where it\r\nentered. In about six weeks the boy was at his labors. Five years later\r\nhe was attacked with severe pneumonia and then first noticed tumultuous\r\naction of the heart which continued to increase after his recovery.\r\nAfterward the pulsation could be heard ten or 12 feet away. He died of\r\nanother attack of pneumonia fifteen years later and the heart was found\r\nto be two or three times its natural size, soft and flabby, and, on\r\nopening the right ventricle, a bullet was discovered embedded in its\r\nwalls. There was no scar of entrance discernible, though the\r\npericardium was adherent. Biffi of Milan describes the case of a\r\nlunatic who died in consequence of gangrene of the tongue from a bite\r\nin a paroxysm of mania. At the necropsy a needle, six cm. in length,\r\nwas found transfixing the heart, with which the relatives of the\r\ndeceased said he had stabbed himself twenty-two months prior to his\r\ndeath. There is a collection of cases in which bullets have been lodged\r\nin the heart from twenty to thirty years.\r\n\r\nBalch reports a case in which a leaden bullet remained twenty years in\r\nthe walls of the heart. Hamilton mentions an instance of gunshot wound\r\nof the heart, in which for twenty years a ball was embedded in the wall\r\nof the right ventricle, death ultimately being caused by pneumonia.\r\nNeedles have quite frequently been found in the heart after death;\r\nGraves, Leaming, Martin, Neill, Piorry, Ryerson, and others record such\r\ncases. Callender mentions recovery of the patient after removal of a\r\nneedle from the heart.\r\n\r\nGarangeot mentions an aged Jesuit of seventy-two, who had in the\r\nsubstance of his heart a bone 4 1/2 inches long and possibly an inch\r\nthick. This case is probably one of ossification of the cardiac muscle;\r\nin the same connection Battolini says that the heart of Pope Urban VII\r\ncontained a bone shaped like the Arab T.\r\n\r\nAmong the older writers we frequently read of hairs, worms, and snakes\r\nbeing found in the cavities of the heart. The Ephemerides, Zacutus\r\nLusitanus, Pare, Swinger, Riverius, and Senac are among the authorities\r\nwho mention this circumstance. The deception was possibly due to the\r\npresence of loose and shaggy membrane attached to the endocardial\r\nlining of the heart, or in some cases to echinococci or trichine. A\r\nstrange case of foreign body in the heart was reported some time since\r\nin England. The patient had swallowed a thorn of the Prunus spinosa\r\n(Linn.), which had penetrated the esophagus and the pericardium and\r\nentered the heart. A postmortem examination one year afterward\r\nconfirmed this, as a contracted cicatrix was plainly visible on the\r\nposterior surface of the heart about an inch above the apex, through\r\nwhich the thorn had penetrated the right ventricle and lodged in the\r\ntricuspid valve. The supposition was that the thorn had been swallowed\r\nwhile eating radishes. Buck mentions a case of hydatid cysts in the\r\nwall of the left ventricle, with rupture of the cysts and sudden death.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising the extent of injury to the pericardium Nature will\r\ntolerate. In his \"Comment on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates,\" Cardanus\r\nsays that he witnessed the excision of a portion of the pericardium\r\nwith the subsequent cure of the patient. According to Galen, Marulus,\r\nthe son of Mimographus, recovered after a similar operation. Galen also\r\nadds, that upon one occasion he removed a portion of carious sternum\r\nand found the pericardium in a putrid state, leaving a portion of the\r\nheart naked. It is said that in the presence of Leucatel and several\r\ntheologians, Francois Botta opened the body of a man who died after an\r\nextended illness and found the pericardium putrefied and a great\r\nportion of the heart destroyed, but the remaining portion still\r\nslightly palpitating.  In this connection Young mentions a patient of\r\nsixty-five who in January, 1860, injured his right thumb and lost the\r\nlast joint by swelling and necrosis. Chloroform was administered to\r\nexcise a portion of the necrosed bone and death ensued. Postmortem\r\nexamination revealed gangrene of the heart and a remarkable tendency to\r\ngangrene elsewhere (omentum, small intestines, skin, etc.). Recently,\r\nDalton records a remarkable case of stab-wound of the pericardium with\r\ndivision of the intercostal artery, upon which he operated. An incision\r\neight inches long was made over the 4th rib, six inches of the rib were\r\nresected, the bleeding intercostal artery was ligated, the blood was\r\nturned out of the pericardial cavity, this cavity being irrigated with\r\nhot water.  The wound in the pericardium, which was two inches long,\r\nwas sutured and the external wound was closed. Recovery followed.\r\nHarris gives an instance of a man who was injured by a bar of iron\r\nfalling on his shoulder, producing a compound fracture of the ribs as\r\nlow as the 7th, and laying the heart and lungs bare without seriously\r\ninjuring the pericardium.\r\n\r\nRupture of the heart from contusion of the chest is not always\r\ninstantly fatal. According to Ashhurst, Gamgee has collected 28 cases\r\nof rupture of this viscus, including one observed by himself. In nine\r\nof these cases there was no fracture, and either no bruise of the\r\nparietes or a very slight one. The pericardium was intact in at least\r\nhalf of the cases, and in 22 in which the precise seat of lesion was\r\nnoticed the right ventricle was ruptured in eight, the left in three,\r\nthe left auricle in seven, the right in four. The longest period during\r\nwhich any patient survived the injury was fourteen hours.\r\n\r\nAmong the older writers who note this traumatic injury are Fine, who\r\nmentions concussion rupturing the right ventricle, and Ludwig, who\r\nreports a similar accident. Johnson mentions rupture of the left\r\nventricle in a paroxysm of epilepsy. There is another species of\r\nrupture of the heart which is not traumatic, in which the rupture\r\noccurs spontaneously, the predisposing cause being fatty degeneration,\r\ndilatation, or some other pathologic process in the cardiac substance.\r\nIt is quite possible that the older instances of what was known as\r\n\"broken-heart,\" which is still a by-word, were really cases in which\r\nviolent emotion had produced rupture of a degenerated cardiac wall.\r\nWright gives a case of spontaneous rupture of the heart in which death\r\ndid not occur for forty-eight hours. Barth has collected 24 cases of\r\nspontaneous rupture of the heart, and in every instance the seat of\r\nlesion was in the left ventricle. It was noticed that in some of these\r\ncases the rupture did not take place all at once, but by repeated minor\r\nlacerations, death not ensuing in some instances for from two to eleven\r\ndays after the first manifestation of serious symptoms. A more recent\r\nanalysis is given by Meyer of cases reported since 1870: Meyer collects\r\n25 cases of rupture of the left ventricle seven of the right ventricle,\r\nand four of the right auricle. Within the last year Collings has\r\nreported a case of idiopathic rupture of the heart in a man of\r\nfifty-three, who had always lived a temperate life, and whose only\r\ntrouble had been dyspepsia and a weak heart. There was no history of\r\nrheumatism or rheumatic fever. The man's father had died suddenly of\r\nheart disease. After feeling out of sorts for a time, the man\r\nexperienced severe pain in the precordium and felt too ill to leave his\r\nbed. He gradually became worse and sick after taking food. Speech\r\nbecame thick, the mouth was drawn to the right, and the right eye was\r\npartially closed. The left arm became paralyzed, then the right leg.\r\nThe tongue deviated to the right on protrusion. The sphincters were\r\nunaffected. The heart sounds were faint and without added sounds. The\r\nman was moved to a water-bed, his body and head being kept horizontal,\r\nand great care being taken to avoid sudden movement. Later, when his\r\npelvis was raised to allow the introduction of a bed-pan, almost\r\ninstantaneous death ensued. Upon postmortem examination prolonged and\r\ncareful search failed to reveal any microscopic change in the brain,\r\nits vessels, or the meninges. On opening the pericardium it was found\r\nto be filled with blood-clot, and on washing this away a laceration\r\nabout 1 1/2 inches in length was found in the left ventricle; the\r\naperture was closed by a recent clot. The cavities of the heart were\r\ndilated, the walls thin and in advanced stage of fatty degeneration.\r\nThere was no valvular disease. The aorta and its main branches were\r\natheromatous. Both lungs contained calcifying tubercle; the abdomen was\r\nloaded with fat; the spleen was soft; the kidneys were engorged, but\r\notherwise healthy.\r\n\r\nStokes gives the case of a man who was severely crushed between the\r\narms of a water-wheel of great size and the embankment on which the\r\naxle of the wheel was supported; a peculiar factor of the injury being\r\nthat his heart was displaced from left to right.  At the time of\r\nreport, after recovery from the injury, the patient exhibited\r\nremarkable tolerance of great doses of digitalis. When not taking\r\ndigitalis, his pulse was 100 to 120, regular, and never intermittent.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the Heart.--The heart of a man of ordinary size weighs\r\nnine ounces, and that of a woman eight; in cases of hypertrophy, these\r\nweights may be doubled, although weights above 25 ounces are rare.\r\nAccording to Osler, Beverly Robinson describes a heart weighing 53\r\nounces, and Dulles has reported one weighing 48 ounces. Among other\r\nmodern records are the following: Fifty and one-half ounces, 57 ounces,\r\nand one weighing four pounds and six ounces. The Ephemerides contains\r\nan incredible account of a heart that weighed 14 pounds. Favell\r\ndescribes a heart that only weighed 3 1/2 ounces.\r\n\r\nWounds of the aorta are almost invariably fatal, although cases are\r\nrecorded by Pelletan, Heil, Legouest, and others, in which patients\r\nsurvived such wounds for from two months to several years. Green\r\nmentions a case of stab-wound in the suprasternal fossa. The patient\r\ndied one month after of another cause, and at the postmortem\r\nexamination the aorta was shown to have been opened; the wound in its\r\nwalls was covered with a spheric, indurated coagulum. No attempt at\r\nunion had been made.\r\n\r\nZillner observed a penetrating wound of the aorta after which the\r\npatient lived sixteen days, finally dying of pericarditis.  Zillner\r\nattributed this circumstance to the small size of the wound, atheroma\r\nand degeneration of the aorta and slight retraction of the inner coat,\r\ntogether with a possible plugging of the pericardial opening. In 1880\r\nChiari said that while dissecting the body of a man who died of\r\nphthisis, he found a false aneurysm of the ascending aorta with a\r\ntransverse rupture of the vessel by the side of it, which had\r\ncompletely cicatrized.  Hill reports the case of a soldier who was\r\nstabbed with a bowie-knife nine inches long and three inches wide. The\r\nblade passed through the diaphragm, cut off a portion of the liver, and\r\nsevered the descending aorta at a point about the 7th dorsal vertebra;\r\nthe soldier lived over three hours after complete division of this\r\nimportant vessel. Heil reports the case of a man of thirty-two, a\r\nsoldier in the Bavarian army, who, in a quarrel in 1812, received a\r\nstab in the right side. The instrument used was a common table-knife,\r\nwhich was passed between the 5th and 6th ribs, entering the left lung,\r\nand causing copious hemorrhage.  The patient recovered in four months,\r\nbut suffered from amaurosis which had commenced at the time of the\r\nstab. Some months afterward he contracted pneumonia and was readmitted\r\nto the hospital, dying in 1813. At the postmortem the cicatrix in the\r\nchest was plainly visible, and in the ascending aorta there was seen a\r\nwound, directly in the track of the knife, which was of irregular\r\nborder and was occupied by a firm coagulum of blood.  The vessel had\r\nbeen completely penetrated, as, by laying it open, an internal cicatrix\r\nwas found corresponding to the other. Fatal hemorrhage had been avoided\r\nin this case by the formation of coagulum in the wound during the\r\nsyncope immediately following the stab, possibly aided by extended\r\nexposure to cold.\r\n\r\nSundry Cases.--Sandifort mentions a curious case of coalescence of the\r\nesophagus and aorta, with ulceration and consequent rupture of the\r\naorta, the hemorrhage proceeding from the stomach at the moment of\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\nHeath had a case of injury to the external iliac artery from external\r\nviolence, with subsequent obliteration of the vessel.  When the patient\r\nwas discharged no pulse could be found in the leg.\r\n\r\nDismukes reports a case in which the patient had received 13 wounds,\r\ncompletely severing the subclavian artery, and, without any medical or\r\nsurgical aid, survived the injury two hours.\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the degree of hemorrhage which may follow an injury so\r\nslight as that of falling on a needle we cite an instance, reported by\r\na French authority, of a child who picked up a needle, and, while\r\nrunning with it to its mother, stumbled and fell, the needle\r\npenetrating the 4th intercostal space, the broadened end of it\r\nremaining outside of the wound. The mother seized the needle between\r\nher teeth and withdrew it, but the child died, before medical aid could\r\nbe summoned, from internal hemorrhage, causing pulmonary pressure and\r\ndyspnea.\r\n\r\nRupture of the esophagus is attributable to many causes. Dryden\r\nmentions vomiting as a cause, and Guersant reports the case of a little\r\ngirl of seven, who, during an attack of fever, ruptured her esophagus\r\nby vomiting. In 1837 Heyfelder reported the case of a drunkard, who, in\r\na convulsion, ruptured his esophagus and died. Williams mentions a case\r\nin which not only the gullet, but also the diaphragm, was ruptured in\r\nvomiting. In this country, Bailey and Fitz have recorded cases of\r\nrupture of the esophagus.  Brewer relates a parallel instance of\r\nrupture from vomiting. All the foregoing cases were linear ruptures,\r\nbut there is a unique case given by Boerhaave in 1724, in which the\r\nrent was transverse. Ziemssen and Mackenzie have both translated from\r\nthe Latin the report of this case which is briefly as follows: The\r\npatient, Baron de Wassenaer, was fifty years of age, and, with the\r\nexception that he had a sense of fulness after taking moderate meals,\r\nhe was in perfect health. To relieve this disagreeable feeling he was\r\nin the habit of taking a copious draught of an infusion of \"blessed\r\nthistle\" and ipecacuanha. One day, about 10.30 in the evening, when he\r\nhad taken no supper, but had eaten a rather hearty dinner, he was\r\nbothered by a peculiar sensation in his stomach, and to relieve this he\r\nswallowed about three tumbler-fuls of his usual infusion, but to no\r\navail. He then tried to excite vomiting by tickling the fauces, when,\r\nin retching, he suddenly felt a violent pain; he diagnosed his own case\r\nby saying that it was \"the bursting of something near the pit of the\r\nstomach.\" He became prostrated and died in eighteen and one-half hours;\r\nat the necropsy it was seen that without any previously existing signs\r\nof disease the esophagus had been completely rent across in a\r\ntransverse direction.\r\n\r\nSchmidtmuller mentions separation of the esophagus from the stomach;\r\nand Flint reports the history of a boy of seven who died after being\r\ntreated for worms and cerebral symptoms. After death the contents of\r\nthe stomach were found in the abdominal cavity, and the esophagus was\r\ncompletely separated from the stomach.  Flint believed the separation\r\nwas postmortem, and was possibly due to the softening of the stomach by\r\nthe action of the gastric acids. In this connection may be mentioned\r\nthe case reported by Hanford of a man of twenty-three who had an attack\r\nof hematemesis and melanema two years before death. A postmortem was\r\nmade five hours after death, and there was so much destruction of the\r\nstomach by a process resembling digestion that only the pyloric and\r\ncardiac orifices were visible. Hanford suggests that this was an\r\ninstance of antemortem digestion of the stomach which physiologists\r\nclaim is impossible.\r\n\r\nNearly all cases of rupture of the stomach are due to carcinoma, ulcer,\r\nor some similar condition, although there have been instances of\r\nrupture from pressure and distention. Wunschheim reports the case of a\r\nman of fifty-two who for six months presented symptoms of gastric\r\nderangement, and who finally sustained spontaneous rupture of the\r\nposterior border of the stomach due to overdistention. There was a tear\r\ntwo inches long, beginning near the cardiac end and running parallel to\r\nthe lesser curvature. The margin of the tear showed no evidence of\r\ndigestion. There were obstructing esophageal neoplasms about 10 1/3\r\ninches from the teeth, which prevented vomiting. In reviewing the\r\nliterature Wunschheim found only six cases of spontaneous rupture of\r\nthe stomach. Arton reports the case of a negro of fifty who suffered\r\nfrom tympanites. He was a hard drinker and had been aspirated several\r\ntimes, gas heavily laden with odors of the milk of asafetida being\r\ndischarged with a violent rush. The man finally died of his malady, and\r\nat postmortem it was found that his stomach had burst, showing a slit\r\nfour inches long. The gall bladder contained two quarts of inspissated\r\nbile. Fulton mentions a case of rupture of the esophageal end of a\r\nstomach in a child.  The colon was enormously distended and the walls\r\nthickened. When three months old it was necessary to puncture the bowel\r\nfor distention. Collins describes spontaneous rupture of the stomach in\r\na woman of seventy-four, the subject of lateral curvature of the spine,\r\nwho had frequent attacks of indigestion and tympanites. On the day of\r\ndeath there was considerable distention, and a gentle purgative and\r\nantispasmodic were given.  Just before death a sudden explosive sound\r\nwas heard, followed by collapse. A necropsy showed a rupture two inches\r\nlong and two inches from the pyloric end. Lallemand mentions an\r\ninstance of the rupture of the coats of the stomach by the act of\r\nvomiting.  The patient was a woman who had suffered with indigestion\r\nfive or six months, but had been relieved by strict regimen. After\r\nindulging her appetite to a greater extent than usual, she experienced\r\nnausea, and made violent and ineffectual efforts to discharge the\r\ncontents of the stomach. While suffering great agony she experienced a\r\nsensation as if something was tearing in the lower part of her belly.\r\nThe woman uttered several screams, fell unconscious, and died that\r\nnight. Postmortem examination showed that the anterior and middle part\r\nof the stomach were torn obliquely to the extent of five inches. The\r\ntear extended from the smaller toward the greater curvature. The edges\r\nwere thin and irregular and presented no marks of disease. The cavity\r\nof the peritoneum was full of half-digested food. The records of St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospital, London, contain the account of a man of\r\nthirty-four who for two years had been the subject of paroxysmal pain\r\nin the stomach. The pains usually continued for several hours and\r\nsubsided with vomiting. At St. Bartholomew's he had an attack of\r\nvomiting after a debauch. On the following day he was seized with\r\nvomiting accompanied by nausea and flatus, and after a sudden attack of\r\npain at the pit of the stomach which continued for two hours, he died.\r\nA ragged opening at the esophageal orifice, on the anterior surface of\r\nthe stomach was found. This tear extended from below the lesser\r\ncurvature to its extremity, and was four inches long. There were no\r\nsigns of gastric carcinoma or ulcer.\r\n\r\nClarke reports the case of a Hindoo of twenty-two, under treatment for\r\nague, who, without pain or vomiting, suddenly fell into collapse and\r\ndied twenty-three hours later. He also mentions a case of rupture of\r\nthe stomach of a woman of uncertain history, who was supposed to have\r\ndied of cholera. The examination of the bodies of both cases showed\r\ntrue rupture of the stomach and not mere perforation. In both cases, at\r\nthe time of rupture, the stomach was empty, and the gastric juice had\r\ndigested off the capsules of the spleens, thus allowing the escape of\r\nblood into the abdominal cavities. The seats of rupture were on the\r\nanterior walls. In the first case the coats of the stomach were\r\natrophied and thin. In the second the coats were healthy and not even\r\nsoftened. There was absence of softening, erosion, or rupture on the\r\nposterior walls.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the amount of paralytic distention that is possible,\r\nBamberger mentions a case in which 70 pounds of fluid filled the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nVoluntary Vomiting.--It is an interesting fact that some persons\r\nexhibit the power of contracting the stomach at will and expelling its\r\ncontents without nausea. Montegre mentions a distinguished member of\r\nthe Faculty of Paris, who, by his own volition and without nausea or\r\nany violent efforts, could vomit the contents of his stomach. In his\r\ntranslation of \"Spallanzani's Experiments on Digestion\" Sennebier\r\nreports a similar instance in Geneva, in which the vomiting was brought\r\nabout by swallowing air.\r\n\r\nIn discussing wounds and other injuries of the stomach no chapter would\r\nbe complete without a description of the celebrated case of Alexis St.\r\nMartin, whose accident has been the means of contributing so much to\r\nthe knowledge of the physiology of digestion. This man was a French\r\nCanadian of good constitution, robust and healthy, and was employed as\r\na voyageur by the American Fur Company. On June 16, 1822, when about\r\neighteen years of age, he was accidentally wounded by a discharge from\r\na musket.  The contents of the weapon, consisting of powder and\r\nduck-shot, entered his left side from a distance of not more than a\r\nyard off. The charge was directed obliquely forward and inward,\r\nliterally blowing off the integument and muscles for a space about the\r\nsize of a man's hand, carrying away the anterior half of the 6th rib,\r\nfracturing the 5th rib, lacerating the lower portion of the lowest lobe\r\nof the left lung, and perforating the diaphragm and the stomach. The\r\nwhole mass of the discharge together with fragments of clothing were\r\ndriven into the muscles and cavity of the chest. When first seen by Dr.\r\nBeaumont about a half hour after the accident, a portion of the lung,\r\nas large as a turkey's egg was found protruding through the external\r\nwound.  The protruding lung was lacerated and burnt. Immediately below\r\nthis was another protrusion, which proved to be a portion of the\r\nstomach, lacerated through all its coats. Through an orifice, large\r\nenough to admit a fore-finger, oozed the remnants of the food he had\r\ntaken for breakfast. His injuries were dressed; extensive sloughing\r\ncommenced, and the wound became considerably enlarged. Portions of the\r\nlung, cartilages, ribs, and of the ensiform process of the sternum came\r\naway. In a year from the time of the accident, the wound, with the\r\nexception of a fistulous aperture of the stomach and side, had\r\ncompletely cicatrized. This aperture was about 2 1/2 inches in\r\ncircumference, and through it food and drink constantly extruded unless\r\nprevented by a tent-compress and bandage. The man had so far recovered\r\nas to be able to walk and do light work, his digestion and appetite\r\nbeing normal. Some months later a small fold or doubling of the\r\nstomachal coats slightly protruded until the whole aperture was filled,\r\nso as to supersede the necessity of a compress, the protruding coats\r\nacting as a valve when the stomach was filled. This valvular protrusion\r\nwas easily depressed by the finger. St. Martin suffered little pain\r\nexcept from the depression of the skin. He took his food and drink like\r\nany healthy person, and for eleven years remained under Dr. Beaumont's\r\nown care in the Doctor's house as a servant. During this time were\r\nperformed the experiments on digestion which are so well known. St.\r\nMartin was at all times willing to lend himself in the interest of\r\nphysiologic science. In August, 1879, The Detroit Lancet contains\r\nadvices that St. Martin was living at that time at St. Thomas, Joliette\r\nCounty, Province of Quebec, Canada. At the age of seventy-nine he was\r\ncomparatively strong and well, and had always been a hard worker. At\r\nthis time the opening in the stomach was nearly an inch in diameter,\r\nand in spite of its persistence his digestion had never failed him.\r\n\r\nSpizharny relates a remarkable case of gastric fistula in the loin, and\r\ncollects 61 cases of gastric fistula, none of which opened in the loin.\r\nThe patient was a girl of eighteen, who had previously had\r\nperityphlitis, followed by abscesses about the navel and lumbar region.\r\nTwo fistulae were found in the right loin, and were laid open into one\r\ncanal, which, after partial resection of the 12th rib, was dilated and\r\ntraced inward and upward, and found to be in connection with the\r\nstomach. Food was frequently found on the dressings, but with the\r\ncareful use of tampons a cure was effected.\r\n\r\nIn the olden times wounds of the stomach were not always fatal.  The\r\ncelebrated anatomist, Fallopius, successfully treated two cases in\r\nwhich the stomach was penetrated so that food passed through the wound.\r\nJacobus Orthaeus tells us that in the city of Fuldana there was a\r\nsoldier who received a wound of the stomach, through which food passed\r\nimmediately after being swallowed; he adds that two judicious surgeons\r\nstitched the edges of the wound to the integuments, thereby effecting a\r\ncure. There is another old record of a gastric fistula through which\r\nsome aliment passed during the period of eleven years.\r\n\r\nArcher tells of a man who was stabbed by a negro, the knife entering\r\nthe cartilages of the 4th rib on the right side, and penetrating the\r\nstomach to the extent of two inches at a point about two inches below\r\nthe xiphoid cartilage. The stomachal contents, consisting of bacon,\r\ncabbage, and cider, were evacuated. Shortly after the reception of the\r\ninjury, an old soldier sewed up the wound with an awl, needle, and\r\nwax-thread; Archer did not see the patient until forty-eight hours\r\nafterward, at which time he cleansed and dressed the wound. After a\r\nsomewhat protracted illness the patient recovered, notwithstanding the\r\nextent of injury and the primitive mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nTravers mentions the case of a woman of fifty-three who, with suicidal\r\nintent, divided her abdominal parietes below the navel with a razor,\r\nwounding the stomach in two places. Through the wound protruded the\r\ngreater part of the larger curvature of the stomach; the arch of the\r\ncolon and the entire greater omentum were both strangulated. A small\r\nportion of the coats of the stomach, including the wound, was nipped\r\nup, a silk ligature tied about it, and the entrails replaced. Two\r\nmonths afterward the patient had quite recovered, though the ligature\r\nof the stomach had not been seen in the stool. Clements mentions a\r\nrobust German of twenty-two who was stabbed in the abdomen with a dirk,\r\nproducing an incised wound of the stomach. The patient recovered and\r\nwas returned to duty the following month.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases on record in which injury of the stomach has been\r\ndue to some mistake or accident in the juggling process of\r\nknife-swallowing or sword-swallowing. The records of injuries of this\r\nnature extend back many hundred years, and even in the earlier days the\r\ndelicate operation of gastrotomy, sometimes with a successful issue,\r\nwas performed upon persons who had swallowed knives. Gross mentions\r\nthat in 1502 Florian Mathias of Bradenberg removed a knife nine inches\r\nlong from the stomach of a man of thirty-six, followed by a successful\r\nrecovery. Glandorp, from whom, possibly, Gross derived his information,\r\nrelates this memorable case as being under the direction of Florianus\r\nMatthaesius of Bradenburg. The patient, a native of Prague, had\r\nswallowed a knife eight or nine inches long, which lay pointing at the\r\nsuperior portion of the stomach. After it had been lodged in this\r\nposition for seven weeks and two days gastrotomy was performed, and the\r\nknife extracted; the patient recovered. In 1613 Crollius reports the\r\ncase of a Bohemian peasant who had concealed a knife in his mouth,\r\nthinking no one would suspect he possessed the weapon; while he was\r\nexcited it slipped into the stomach, from whence it subsequently\r\npenetrated through to the skin; the man recovered. There is another old\r\ncase of a man at Prague who swallowed a knife which some few weeks\r\nafterward made its exit from an abdominal abscess. Gooch quotes the\r\ncase of a man, belonging to the Court of Paris, who, nine months after\r\nswallowing a knife, voided it at the groin. In the sixteenth century\r\nLaurentius Joubert relates a similar case, the knife having remained in\r\nthe body two years. De Diemerbroeck mentions the fact that a knife ten\r\ninches long was extracted by gastrotomy, and placed among the rarities\r\nin the anatomic chamber of the University at Leyden. The operation was\r\ndone in 1635 at Koenigsberg, by Schwaben, who for his surgical prowess\r\nwas appointed surgeon to the King of Poland. The patient lived eight\r\nyears after the operation.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in 1691, while playing tricks with a knife 6 1/2 inches\r\nlong, a country lad of Saxony swallowed it, point first.  He came under\r\nthe care of Weserern, physician to the Elector of Brandenburgh, who\r\nsuccessfully extracted it, two years and seven months afterward, from\r\nthe pit of the lad's stomach. The horn haft of the knife was\r\nconsiderably digested. In 1720 Hubner of Rastembourg operated on a\r\nwoman who had swallowed an open knife.  After the incision it was found\r\nthat the knife had almost pierced the stomach and had excited a slight\r\nsuppuration. After the operation recovery was very prompt.\r\n\r\nBell of Davenport, Iowa, performed gastrotomy on a man, who, while\r\nattempting a feat of legerdemain, allowed a bar of lead, 10 1/8 inches\r\nlong, 1 1/2 inches wide, and 9 1/2 ounces in weight, to slip into his\r\nstomach. The bar was removed and the patient recovered. Gussenbauer\r\ngives an account of a juggler who turned his head to bow an\r\nacknowledgment of applause while swallowing a sword; he thus brought\r\nhis upper incisors against the sword, which broke off and slipped into\r\nhis stomach. To relieve suffocation the sword was pushed further down.\r\nGastrotomy was performed, and the piece of sword 11 inches long was\r\nextracted; as there was perforation of the stomach before the\r\noperation, the patient died of peritonitis.\r\n\r\nAn hour after ingestion, Bernays of St. Louis successfully removed a\r\nknife 9 1/2 inches long. By means of an army-bullet forceps the knife\r\nwas extracted easily through an incision 5/8 inch long in the walls of\r\nthe stomach. Gross speaks of a man of thirty who was in the habit of\r\ngiving exhibitions of sword-swallowing in public houses, and who\r\ninjured his esophagus to such an extent as to cause abscess and death.\r\nIn the Journal of the American Medical Association, March 1, 1896,\r\nthere is an extensive list of gastrotomies performed for the removal of\r\nknives and other foreign bodies, from the seventeenth century to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe physiologic explanation of sword-swallowing is quite interesting.\r\nWe know that when we introduce the finger, a spoon, brush, etc., into\r\nthe throat of a patient, we cause extremely disagreeable symptoms.\r\nThere is nausea, gagging, and considerable hindrance with the function\r\nof respiration. It therefore seems remarkable that there are people\r\nwhose physiologic construction is such that, without apparent\r\ndifficulty, they are enabled to swallow a sword many inches long. Many\r\nof the exhibitionists allow the visitors to touch the stomach and\r\noutline the point of the sabre through the skin. The sabre used is\r\nusually very blunt and of rounded edges, or if sharp, a guiding tube of\r\nthin metal is previously swallowed. The explanation of these\r\nexhibitions is as follows: The instrument enters the mouth and pharynx,\r\nthen the esophagus, traverses the cardiac end of the stomach, and\r\nenters the latter as far as the antrum of the pylorus, the small\r\nculdesac of the stomach. In their normal state in the adult these\r\norgans are not in a straight line, but are so placed by the passage of\r\nthe sword. In the first place the head is thrown back, so that the\r\nmouth is in the direction of the esophagus, the curves of which\r\ndisappear or become less as the sword proceeds; the angle that the\r\nesophagus makes with the stomach is obliterated, and finally the\r\nstomach is distended in the vertical diameter and its internal curve\r\ndisappears, thus permitting the blade to traverse the greater diameter\r\nof the stomach. According to Guyot-Daubes, these organs, in a straight\r\nline, extend a distance of from 55 to 62 cm., and consequently the\r\nperformer is enabled to swallow an instrument of this length. The\r\nlength is divided as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Mouth and pharynx, . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 to 12 cm.\r\n  Esophagus, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 to 28 cm.\r\n  Distended stomach, . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 to 22 cm.\r\n                                            -------------\r\n                                             55 to 62 cm.\r\n\r\nThese acrobats with the sword have rendered important service to\r\nmedicine. It was through the good offices of a sword-swallower that the\r\nScotch physician, Stevens, was enabled to make his experiments on\r\ndigestion. He caused this assistant to swallow small metallic tubes\r\npierced with holes. They were filled, according to Reaumur's method,\r\nwith pieces of meat. After a certain length of time he would have the\r\nacrobat disgorge the tubes, and in this way he observed to what degree\r\nthe process of digestion had taken place. It was also probably the\r\nsword-swallower who showed the physicians to what extent the pharynx\r\ncould be habituated to contact, and from this resulted the invention of\r\nthe tube of Faucher, the esophageal sound, ravage of the stomach, and\r\nillumination of this organ by electric light. Some of these individuals\r\nalso have the faculty of swallowing several pebbles, as large even as\r\nhen's eggs, and of disgorging them one by one by simple contractions of\r\nthe stomach.  From time to time individuals are seen who possess the\r\npower of swallowing pebbles, knives, bits of broken glass, etc., and,\r\nin fact, there have been recent tricky exhibitionists who claimed to be\r\nable to swallow poisons, in large quantities, with impunity.  Henrion,\r\ncalled \"Casaandra,\" a celebrated example of this class, was born at\r\nMetz in 1761. Early in life he taught himself to swallow pebbles,\r\nsometimes whole and sometimes after breaking them with his teeth. He\r\npassed himself off as an American savage; he swallowed as many as 30 or\r\n40 large pebbles a day, demonstrating the fact by percussion on the\r\nepigastric region.  With the aid of salts he would pass the pebbles and\r\nmake them do duty the next day. He would also swallow live mice and\r\ncrabs with their claws cut. It was said that when the mice were\r\nintroduced into his mouth, they threw themselves into the pharynx where\r\nthey were immediately suffocated and then swallowed. The next morning\r\nthey would be passed by the rectum flayed and covered with a mucous\r\nsubstance. Henrion continued his calling until 1820, when, for a\r\nmoderate sum, he was induced to swallow some nails and a plated iron\r\nspoon 5 1/2 inches long and one inch in breadth. He died seven days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bonet, there was a man by the name of Pichard who\r\nswallowed a razor and two knives in the presence of King Charles II of\r\nEngland, the King himself placing the articles into the man's mouth. In\r\n1810 Babbington and Curry are accredited with citing the history of an\r\nAmerican sailor in Guy's Hospital, London, who frequently swallowed\r\npenknives for the amusement of his audiences. At first he swallowed\r\nfour, and three days later passed them by the anus; on another occasion\r\nhe swallowed 14 of different sizes with the same result. Finally he\r\nattempted to gorge himself with 17 penknives, but this performance was\r\nfollowed by horrible pains and alarming abdominal symptoms. His\r\nexcrement was black from iron. After death the cadaver was opened and\r\n14 corroded knives were found in the stomach, some of the handles being\r\npartly digested; two were found in the pelvis and one in the abdominal\r\ncavity. Pare recalls the instance of a shepherd who suffered\r\ndistressing symptoms after gulping a knife six inches long. Afterward\r\nthe knife was abstracted from his groin. Fabricius Hildanus cites a\r\nsomewhat similar case.\r\n\r\nEarly in the century there was a man known as the \"Yankee\r\nknife-swallower,\" whose name was John Cummings, an American sailor, who\r\nhad performed his feats in nearly all the ports of the world. One of\r\nhis chief performances was swallowing a billiard ball. Poland mentions\r\na man (possibly Cummings) who, in 1807, was admitted to Guy's Hospital\r\nwith dyspeptic symptoms which he attributed to knife-swallowing. His\r\nstory was discredited at first; but after his death, in March, 1809,\r\nthere were 30 or 40 fragments of knives found in his stomach. One of\r\nthe back-springs on a knife had transfixed the colon and rectum.  In\r\nthe Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for 1825 there is an account of a\r\njuggler who swallowed a knife which remained in his stomach and caused\r\nsuch intense symptoms that gastrotomy was advised; the patient,\r\nhowever, refused operation.\r\n\r\nDrake reports a curious instance of polyphagia. The person described\r\nwas a man of twenty-seven who pursued the vocation of a\r\n\"sword-swallower.\" He had swallowed a gold watch and chain with a seal\r\nand key attached; at another time he swallowed 34 bullets and voided\r\nthem by the anus. At Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in August, 1819, in one day\r\nand night he swallowed 19 pocket-knives and 41 copper cents. This man\r\nhad commenced when a lad of fifteen by swallowing marbles, and soon\r\nafterward a small penknife. After his death his esophagus was found\r\nnormal, but his stomach was so distended as to reach almost to the\r\nspine of the ilium, and knives were found in the stomach weighing one\r\npound or more. In his exhibitions he allowed his spectators to hear the\r\nclick of the knives and feel them as low down as the anterior superior\r\nspine of the ilium.\r\n\r\nThe present chief of the dangerous \"profession\" of sword-swallowing is\r\nChevalier Cliquot, a French Canadian by birth, whose major trick is to\r\nswallow a real bayonet sword, weighted with a cross-bar and two\r\n18-pound dumbbells. He can swallow without difficulty a 22-inch cavalry\r\nsword; formerly, in New York, he gave exhibitions of swallowing\r\nfourteen 19-inch bayonet swords at once. A negro, by the name of Jones,\r\nexhibiting not long since in Philadelphia, gave hourly exhibitions of\r\nhis ability to swallow with impunity pieces of broken glass and china.\r\n\r\nForeign Bodies in the Alimentary Canal.--In the discussion of the\r\nforeign bodies that have been taken into the stomach and intestinal\r\ntract possibly the most interesting cases, although the least\r\nauthentic, are those relating to living animals, such as fish, insects,\r\nor reptiles. It is particularly among the older writers that we find\r\naccounts of this nature. In the Ephemerides we read of a man who\r\nvomited a serpent that had crept into his mouth, and of another person\r\nwho ejected a beetle that had gained entrance in a similar manner. From\r\nthe same authority we find instances of the vomiting of live fish,\r\nmice, toads, and also of the passage by the anus of live snails and\r\nsnakes. Frogs vomited are mentioned by Bartholinus, Dolaeus,\r\nHellwigius, Lentilus, Salmuth, and others. Vege mentions a man who\r\nswallowed a young chicken whole. Paullini speaks of a person who, after\r\ngreat pain, vomited a mouse which he had swallowed. Borellus,\r\nBartholinus, Thoner, and Viridet, are among the older authorities\r\nmentioning persons who swallowed toads. Hippocrates speaks of asphyxia\r\nfrom a serpent which had crawled into the mouth.\r\n\r\nBorellus states that he knew a case of a person who vomited a\r\nsalamander. Plater reports the swallowing of eels and snails.  Rhodius\r\nmentions persons who have eaten scorpions and spiders with impunity.\r\nPlanchon writes of an instance in which a live spider was ejected from\r\nthe bowel; and Colini reports the passage of a live lizard which had\r\nbeen swallowed two days before, and there is another similar case on\r\nrecord. Marcellus Donatus records an instance in which a viper, which\r\nhad previously crawled into the mouth, had been passed by the anus.\r\nThere are also recorded instances in French literature in which persons\r\naffected with pediculosis, have, during sleep, unconsciously swallowed\r\nlice which were afterward found in the stools.\r\n\r\nThere is an abundance of cases in which leeches have been accidentally\r\nswallowed. Pliny, Aetius, Dioscorides, Scribonius-Largus, Celsus,\r\nOribasius, Paulus Aegineta, and others, describe such cases.\r\nBartholinus speaks of a Neapolitan prince who, while hunting, quenched\r\nhis thirst in a brook, putting his mouth in the running water. In this\r\nway he swallowed a leech, which subsequently caused annoying hemorrhage\r\nfrom the mouth. Timaeus mentions a child of five who swallowed several\r\nleeches, and who died of abdominal pains, hemorrhage, and convulsions.\r\nRhodius, Riverius, and Zwinger make similar observations. According to\r\nBaron Larrey the French soldiers in Napoleon's Egyptian campaign\r\noccasionally swallowed leeches.  Grandchamp and Duval have commented on\r\ncurious observations of leeches in the digestive tract. Dumas and\r\nMarques also speak of the swallowing of leeches. Colter reports a case\r\nin which beetles were vomited. Wright remarks on Banon's case of\r\nfresh-water shrimps passed from the human intestine. Dalton, Dickman,\r\nand others, have discussed the possibility of a slug living in the\r\nstomach of man. Pichells speaks of a case in which beetles were\r\nexpelled from the stomach; and Pigault gives an account of a living\r\nlizard expelled by vomiting. Fontaine, Gaspard, Vetillart, Ribert,\r\nMacAlister, and Waters record cases in which living caterpillars have\r\nbeen swallowed.\r\n\r\nSundry Cases.--The variety of foreign bodies that have been swallowed\r\neither accidentally or for exhibitional or suicidal purposes is\r\nenormous. Nearly every imaginable article from the minutest to the most\r\nincredible size has been reported. To begin to epitomize the literature\r\non this subject would in itself consume a volume, and only a few\r\ninstances can be given here, chosen in such a way as to show the\r\nvariety, the effects, and the possibilities of their passage through\r\nthe intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nChopart says that in 1774 the belly of a ravenous galley-slave was\r\nopened, and in the stomach were found 52 foreign bodies, including a\r\nbarrel-hoop 19 inches long, nails, pieces of pipe, spoons, buckles,\r\nseeds, glass, and a knife. In the intestines of a person Agnew found a\r\npair of suspenders, a mass of straw, and three roller-bandages, an inch\r\nin width and diameter. Velpeau mentions a fork which was passed from\r\nthe anus twenty months after it was swallowed. Wilson mentions an\r\ninstance of gastrotomy which was performed for the extraction of a fork\r\nswallowed sixteen years before. There is an interesting case in which,\r\nin a delirium of typhoid fever, a girl of twenty-two swallowed two iron\r\nforks, which were subsequently expelled through an abdominal abscess. A\r\nFrench woman of thirty-five, with suicidal intent, swallowed a\r\nfour-pronged fork, which was removed four years afterward from the\r\nthigh. For two years she had suffered intense pain in both thighs. In\r\nthe Royal College of Surgeons in London there is a steel button-hook 3\r\n1/2 inches in length which was accidentally swallowed, and was passed\r\nthree weeks later by the anus, without having given rise to any symptom.\r\n\r\nAmong the insane a favorite trait seems to be swallowing nails.  In the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions is an account of the contents of the stomach\r\nof an idiot who died at thirty-three. In this organ were found nine\r\ncart-wheel nails, six screws, two pairs of compasses, a key, an iron\r\npin, a ring, a brass pommel weighing nine ounces, and many other\r\narticles. The celebrated Dr. Lettsom, in 1802, spoke of an idiot who\r\nswallowed four pounds of old nails and a pair of compasses. A lunatic\r\nin England e swallowed ten ounces of screws and bits of crockery, all\r\nof which were passed by the anus. Boardman gives an account of a child\r\naffected with hernia who swallowed a nail 2 1/2 inches long. In a few\r\ndays the nail was felt in the hernia, but in due time it was passed by\r\nthe rectum. Blower reports an account of a nail passing safely through\r\nthe alimentary canal of a baby. Armstrong mentions an insane\r\nhair-dresser of twenty-three, in whose stomach after death were found\r\n30 or more spoon handles, 30 nails, and other minor articles.\r\n\r\nClosmadenc reported a remarkable case which was extensively quoted. The\r\npatient was an hysteric young girl, an inmate of a convent, to whom he\r\nwas called to relieve a supposed fit of epilepsy. He found her\r\nhalf-asphyxiated, and believed that she had swallowed a foreign body.\r\nHe was told that under the influence of exaggerated religious scruples\r\nthis girl inflicted penance upon herself by swallowing earth and holy\r\nmedals. At the first dose of the emetic, the patient made a strong\r\neffort to vomit, whereupon a cross seven cm. long appeared between her\r\nteeth. This was taken out of her mouth, and with it an enormous rosary\r\n220 cm. long, and having seven medals attached to it. Hunt recites a\r\ncase occurring in a pointer dog, which swallowed its collar and chain,\r\nonly imperfectly masticating the collar. The chain and collar were\r\nimmediately missed and search made for them. For several days the dog\r\nwas ill and refused food. Finally the gamekeeper saw the end of the\r\nchain hanging from the dog's anus, and taking hold of it, he drew out a\r\nyard of chain with links one inch long, with a cross bar at the end two\r\ninches in length; the dog soon recovered. The collar was never found,\r\nand had apparently been digested or previously passed.\r\n\r\nFear of robbery has often led to the swallowing of money or jewelry.\r\nVaillant, the celebrated doctor and antiquarian, after a captivity of\r\nfour months in Algiers, was pursued by Tunis pirates, and swallowed 15\r\nmedals of gold; shortly after arriving at Lyons he passed them all at\r\nstool. Fournier and Duret published the history of a galley slave at\r\nBrest in whose stomach were found 52 pieces of money, their combined\r\nweight being one pound, 10 1/4 ounces. On receiving a sentence of three\r\nyears' imprisonment, an Englishman, to prevent them being taken from\r\nhim, swallowed seven half-crowns. He suffered no bad effects, and the\r\ncoins not appearing the affair was forgotten. While at stool some\r\ntwenty months afterward, having taken a purgative for intense abdominal\r\npain, the seven coins fell clattering into the chamber. Hevin mentions\r\nthe case of a man who, on being captured by Barbary pirates, swallowed\r\nall the money he had on his person.  It is said that a certain Italian\r\nswallowed 100 louis d'ors at a time.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that false teeth are accidentally swallowed,\r\nand even passed through the intestinal tract. Easton mentions a young\r\nman who accidentally swallowed some artificial teeth the previous\r\nnight, and, to further their passage through the bowel, he took a dose\r\nof castor oil. When seen he was suffering with pain in the stomach, and\r\nwas advised to eat much heavy food and avoid aperients. The following\r\nday after several free movements he felt a sharp pain in the lower part\r\nof his back. A large enema was given and the teeth and plate came away.\r\nThe teeth were cleansed and put back in his mouth, and the patient\r\nwalked out. Nine years later the same accident again happened to the\r\nman but in spite of treatment nothing was seen of the teeth for a month\r\nafterward, when a body appeared in the rectum which proved to be a gold\r\nplate with the teeth in it. In The Lancet of December 10, 1881, there\r\nis an account of a vulcanite tooth-plate which was swallowed and passed\r\nforty-two hours later. Billroth mentions an instance of gastrotomy for\r\nthe removal of swallowed artificial teeth, with recovery; and another\r\ncase in which a successful esophagotomy was performed. Gardiner\r\nmentions a woman of thirty-three who swallowed two false teeth while\r\nsupping soup. A sharp angle of the broken plate had caught in a fold of\r\nthe cardiac end of the stomach and had caused violent hematemesis.\r\nDeath occurred seventeen hours after the first urgent symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in London there is an\r\nintestinal concretion weighing 470 grains, which was passed by a woman\r\nof seventy who had suffered from constipation for many years. Sixteen\r\nyears before the concretion was passed she was known to have swallowed\r\na tooth. At one side of the concretion a piece had been broken off\r\nexposing an incisor tooth which represented the nucleus of the\r\nformation. Manasse recently reported the case of a man of forty-four\r\nwhose stomach contained a stone weighing 75 grams. He was a joiner and,\r\nit was supposed, habitually drank some alcoholic solution of shellac\r\nused in his trade. Quite likely the shellac had been precipitated in\r\nthe stomach and gave rise to the calculus.\r\n\r\nBerwick mentions a child of eight months who was playing with a\r\ndetached organ-handle, and put it in its mouth. Seeing this the mother\r\nattempted to secure the handle, but it was pushed into the esophagus. A\r\nphysician was called, but nothing was done, and the patient seemed to\r\nsuffer little inconvenience. Three days later the handle was expelled\r\nfrom the anus. Teakle reports the successful passage through the\r\nalimentary canal of the handle of a music-box. Hashimoto,\r\nSurgeon-General of the Imperial Japanese Army, tells of a woman of\r\nforty-nine who was in the habit of inducing vomiting by irritating her\r\nfauces and pharynx with a Japanese toothbrush--a wooden instrument six\r\nor seven inches long with bristles at one end. In May, 1872, she\r\naccidentally swallowed this brush. Many minor symptoms developed, and\r\nin eleven months there appeared in the epigastric region a fluctuating\r\nswelling, which finally burst, and from it extended the end of the\r\nbrush. After vainly attempting to extract the brush the attending\r\nphysician contented himself with cutting off the projecting portion.\r\nThe opening subsequently healed; and not until thirteen years later did\r\nthe pain and swelling return. On admission to the hospital in October,\r\n1888, two fistulous openings were seen in the epigastric region, and\r\nthe foreign body was located by probing. Finally, on November 19, 1888,\r\nthe patient was anesthetized, one of the openings enlarged, and the\r\nbrush extracted. Five weeks later the openings had all healed and the\r\npatient was restored to health.\r\n\r\nGarcia reports an interesting instance of foreign body in a man between\r\nforty-five and fifty. This man was afflicted with a syphilitic\r\naffection of the mouth, and he constructed a swab ten inches long with\r\nwhich to cleanse his fauces. While making the application alone one\r\nday, a spasmodic movement caused him to relinquish his grasp on the\r\nhandle, and the swab disappeared. He was almost suffocated, and a\r\nphysician was summoned; but before his arrival the swab had descended\r\ninto the esophagus. Two weeks later, gastro-peritoneal symptoms\r\npresented, and as the stick was located, gastrotomy was proposed; the\r\npatient, however, would not consent to an operation. On the\r\ntwenty-sixth day an abscess formed on the left side below the nipple,\r\nand from it was discharged a large quantity of pus and blood. Four days\r\nafter this, believing himself to be better, the man began to redress\r\nthe wound, and from it he saw the end of a stick protruding. A\r\nphysician was called, and by traction the stick was withdrawn from\r\nbetween the 3d and 4th ribs; forty-nine days after the accident the\r\nwound had healed completely. Two years afterward the patient had an\r\nattack of cholera, but in the fifteen subsequent years he lived an\r\nactive life of labor.\r\n\r\nOccasionally an enormous mass of hair has been removed from the\r\nstomach. A girl of twenty a with a large abdominal swelling was\r\nadmitted to a hospital. Her illness began five years previously, with\r\nfrequent attacks of vomiting, and on three occasions it was noticed\r\nthat she became quite bald. Abdominal section was performed, the\r\nstomach opened, and from it was removed a mass of hair which weighed\r\nfive pounds and three ounces. A good recovery ensued. In the Museum of\r\nSt. George's Hospital, London, are masses of hair and string taken from\r\nthe stomach and duodenum of a girl of ten. It is said that from the age\r\nof three the patient had been in the habit of eating these articles.\r\nThere is a record in the last century of a boy of sixteen who ate all\r\nthe hair he could find; after death his stomach and intestines were\r\nalmost completely lined with hairy masses. In the Journal of the\r\nAmerican Medical Association, March 1, 1896, there is a report of a\r\ncase of hair-swallowing.\r\n\r\nForeign Bodies in the Intestines.--White relates the history of a case\r\nin which a silver spoon was swallowed and successfully excised from the\r\nintestinal canal. Houston mentions a maniac who swallowed a rusty iron\r\nspoon 11 inches long. Fatal peritonitis ensued and the spoon was found\r\nimpacted in the last acute turn of the duodenum. In 1895, in London,\r\nthere was exhibited a specimen, including the end of the ileum with the\r\nadjacent end of the colon, showing a dessert spoon which was impacted\r\nin the latter.  The spoon was seven inches long, and its bowl measured\r\n1 1/2 inches across. There was much ulceration of the mucous membrane.\r\nThis spoon had been swallowed by a lunatic of twenty-two, who had made\r\ntwo previous ineffectual attempts at suicide. Mason describes the case\r\nof a man of sixty-five who, after death by strangulated hernia, was\r\nopened, and two inches from the ileocecal valve was found an earthen\r\negg-cup which he had swallowed. Mason also relates the instance of a\r\nman who swallowed metal balls 2 1/2 inches in diameter; and the case of\r\na Frenchman who, to prevent the enemy from finding them, swallowed a\r\nbox containing despatches from Napoleon. He was kept prisoner until the\r\ndespatches were passed from his bowels. Denby discovered a large\r\negg-cup in the ileum of a man. Fillion mentions an instance of recovery\r\nfollowing the perforation of the jejunum by a piece of horn which had\r\nbeen swallowed. Madden tells of a person, dying of intestinal\r\nobstruction, in whose intestines were found several ounces of crude\r\nmercury and a plum-stone. The mercury had evidently been taken for\r\npurgative effect. Rodenbaugh mentions a most interesting case of beans\r\nsprouting while in the bowel.  Harrison relates a curious case in which\r\nthe swallowed lower epiphysis of the femur of a rabbit made its way\r\nfrom the bowel to the bladder, and was discharged thence by the urethra.\r\n\r\nIn cases of appendicitis foreign bodies have been found lodged in or\r\nabout the vermiform appendix so often that it is quite a common lay\r\nidea that appendicitis is invariably the result of the lodgment of some\r\nforeign body accidentally swallowed. In recent years the literature of\r\nthis subject proves that a great variety of foreign bodies may be\r\npresent. A few of the interesting cases will be cited in the following\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\nIn the New England Medical Journal, 1843, is an account of a vermiform\r\nappendix which was taken from the body of a man of eighty-eight who had\r\ndied of pneumothorax. During life there were no symptoms of disease of\r\nthe appendix, and after death no adhesions were found, but this organ\r\nwas remarkably long, and in it were found 122 robin-shot. The old\r\ngentleman had been excessively fond of birds all his life, and was\r\naccustomed to bolt the meat of small birds without properly chewing it;\r\nto this fact was attributed the presence of these shot in the appendix.\r\nA somewhat similar case was that of a man who died in the Hotel-Dieu in\r\n1833. The ileum of this man contained 92 shot and 120 plum stones.\r\nBuckler reports a case of appendicitis in a child of twelve, in which a\r\ncommon-sized bird-shot was found in the appendix. Packard presented a\r\ncase of appendicitis in which two pieces of rusty and crooked wire, one\r\n2 1/2 and the other 1 1/2 inches long, were found in the omentum,\r\nhaving escaped from the appendix. Howe describes a case in which a\r\ndouble oat, with a hard envelope, was found in the vermiform appendix\r\nof a boy of four years and one month of age. Prescott reports a case of\r\nwhat he calls fatal colic from the lodgment of a chocolate-nut in the\r\nappendix; and Noyes relates an instance of death in a man of thirty-one\r\nattributed to the presence of a raisin-seed in the vermiform appendix.\r\nNeedles, pins, peanuts, fruit-stones, peas, grape-seeds, and many\r\nsimilar objects have been found in both normal and suppurative\r\nvermiform appendices.\r\n\r\nIntestinal Injuries.--The degree of injury that the intestinal tract\r\nmay sustain, and after recovery perform its functions as usual, is most\r\nextraordinary; and even when the injury is of such an extent as to be\r\nmortal, the persistence of life is remarkable.  It is a well known fact\r\nthat in bull-fights, after mortal injuries of the abdomen and bowels,\r\nhorses are seen to struggle on almost until the sport is finished.\r\nFontaine reports a case of a Welsh quarryman who was run over by a\r\nheavy four-horse vehicle.  The stump of a glass bottle was crushed into\r\nthe intestinal cavity, and the bowels protruded and were bruised by the\r\nwheels of the wagon. The grit was so firmly ground into the bowel that\r\nit was impossible to remove it; yet the man made a complete recovery.\r\nNicolls has the case of a man of sixty-nine, a workhouse maniac, who on\r\nAugust 20th attempted suicide by running a red-hot poker into his\r\nabdomen. His wound was dressed and he was recovering, but on September\r\n11th he tore the cast off his abdomen, and pulled out of the wound the\r\nomentum and 32 inches of colon, which he tore off and threw between his\r\npallet and the wall. Strange to say he did not die until eight days\r\nafter this horrible injury.\r\n\r\nTardieu relates the case of a chemist who removed a large part of the\r\nmesentery with a knife, and yet recovered. Delmas of Montpellier\r\nreports the history of a wagoner with complete rupture of the\r\nintestines and rupture of the diaphragm, and who yet finished his\r\njourney, not dying until eighteen hours after.\r\n\r\nSuccessful Intestinal Resection.--In 1755 Nedham of Norfolk reported\r\nthe case of a boy of thirteen who was run over and eviscerated. It was\r\nfound necessary to remove 57 inches of the protruding bowel, but the\r\nboy made a subsequent recovery.  Koebererle of Strasburg performed an\r\noperation on a woman of twenty-two for the relief of intestinal\r\nobstruction. On account of numerous strictures it was found necessary\r\nto remove over two yards of the small intestine; the patient recovered\r\nwithout pain or trouble of any kind. In his dissertation on \"Ruptures\"\r\nArnaud remarks that he cut away more than seven feet of gangrenous\r\nbowel, his patient surviving. Beehe reports recovery after the removal\r\nof 48 inches of intestine. The case was one of strangulation of an\r\numbilical hernia.\r\n\r\nSloughing of the Intestine Following Intussusception.--Lobstein\r\nmentions a peasant woman of about thirty who was suddenly seized with\r\nan attack of intussusception of the bowel, and was apparently in a\r\nmoribund condition when she had a copious stool, in which she evacuated\r\nthree feet of bowel with the mesentery attached. The woman recovered,\r\nbut died five months later from a second attack of intussusception, the\r\nileum rupturing and peritonitis ensuing. There is a record in this\r\ncountry of a woman of forty-five who discharged 44 inches of intestine,\r\nand who survived for forty-two days. The autopsy showed the sigmoid\r\nflexure gone, and from the caput ceci to the termination the colon only\r\nmeasured 14 inches. Vater gives a history of a penetrating abdominal\r\nwound in which a portion of the colon hung from the wound during\r\nfourteen years, forming an artificial anus.\r\n\r\nAmong others mentioning considerable sloughing of intestine following\r\nintussusception, and usually with complete subsequent recovery, are\r\nBare, 13 inches of the ileum; Blackton, nine inches; Bower, 14 inches;\r\nDawson, 29 inches; Sheldon, 4 1/2 feet; Stanley, three feet; Tremaine,\r\n17 inches; and Grossoli, 40 cm.\r\n\r\nRupture of the Intestines.--It is quite possible for the intestine to\r\nbe ruptured by external violence, and cases of rupture of all parts of\r\nthe bowel have been recorded. Titorier gives the history of a case in\r\nwhich the colon was completely separated from the rectum by external\r\nviolence. Hinder reports the rupture of the duodenum by a violent kick.\r\nEccles, Ely, and Pollock also mention cases of rupture of the duodenum.\r\nZimmerman, Atwell, and Allan report cases of rupture of the colon.\r\n\r\nOperations upon the gastrointestinal tract have been so improved in the\r\nmodern era of antisepsis that at the present day they are quite common.\r\nThere are so many successful cases on record that the whole subject\r\ndeserves mention here.\r\n\r\nGastrostomy is an operation for establishing a fistulous opening in the\r\nstomach through the anterior wall. Many operations have been devised,\r\nbut the results of this maneuver in malignant disease have not thus far\r\nbeen very satisfactory. It is quite possible that, being an operation\r\nof a serious nature, it is never performed early enough, the patient\r\nbeing fatally weakened by inanition. Gross and Zesas have collected,\r\nrespectively, 207 and 162 cases with surprisingly different rates of\r\nmortality: that of Gross being only 29.47 per cent, while that of Zesas\r\nwas for cicatricial stenoses 60 per cent, and for malignant cases 84\r\nper cent. It is possible that in Zesas's statistics the subjects were\r\nso far advanced that death would have resulted in a short time without\r\noperation. Gastrotomy we have already spoken of.\r\n\r\nPyloroplasty is an operation devised by Heineke and Mikulicz, and is\r\ndesigned to remove the mechanic obstruction in cicatricial stenoses of\r\nthe pylorus, at the same time creating a new pylorus.\r\n\r\nGastroenterostomy and pylorectomy are operations devised for the relief\r\nof malignant disease of the pylorus, the diseased portions being\r\nremoved and the parts resected.\r\n\r\nGastrectomy or extirpation of the stomach is considered by most\r\nsurgeons entirely unjustifiable, as there is seldom hope of cure or\r\nprospect of amelioration. La Tribune Medicale for January 16, 1895,\r\ngives an abstract of Langenbuch's contribution upon total extirpation\r\nof the stomach. Three patients were treated, of whom two died. In the\r\nfirst case, on opening the abdominal cavity the stomach was found very\r\nmuch contracted, presenting extensive carcinomatous infiltration on its\r\nposterior surface. After division of the epiploon section was made at\r\nthe pylorus and at the cardiac extremities; the portions removed\r\nrepresented seven-eighths of the stomach. The pylorus was stitched to\r\nthe remains of the cardiac orifice, making a cavity about the size of a\r\nhen's egg. In this case a cure was accomplished in three weeks.  The\r\nsecond case was that of a man in whom almost the entire stomach was\r\nremoved, and the pyloric and cardiac ends were stitched together in the\r\nwound of the parietes. The third case was that of a man of sixty-two\r\nwith carcinoma of the pylorus.  After pylorectomy, the line of suture\r\nwas confined with iodoform-gauze packing. Unfortunately the patient\r\nsuffered with bronchitis, and coughing caused the sutures to give way;\r\nthe patient died of inanition on the twenty-third day.\r\n\r\nEnterostomy, or the formation of a fecal fistula above the ileocecal\r\nvalve, was performed for the first time by Nelaton in 1840, but the\r\nmortality since 1840 has been so great that in most cases it is deemed\r\ninadmissible.\r\n\r\nColostomy, an operation designed to make a fistulous opening in any\r\nportion of the rectum, was first practiced by Littre. In early times\r\nthe mortality of inguinal colostomy was about five per cent, but has\r\nbeen gradually reduced until Konig reports 20 cases with only one death\r\nfrom peritonitis, and Cripps 26 cases with only one death. This will\r\nalways retain its place in operative surgery as a palliative and\r\nlife-saving operation for carcinomatous stenosis of the lower part of\r\nthe colon, and in cases of carcinoma of the rectum in which operation\r\nis not feasible.\r\n\r\nIntestinal anastomosis, whereby two portions of a severed or resected\r\nbowel can be intimately joined, excluding from fecal circulation the\r\nportion of bowel which has become obstructed, was originally suggested\r\nby Maisonneuve, and was studied experimentally by von Hacken. Billroth\r\nresorted to it, and Senn modified it by substituting decalcified\r\nbone-plates for sutures.  Since that time, Abbe, Matas, Davis, Brokaw,\r\nRobinson, Stamm, Baracz, and Dawburn, have modified the material of the\r\nplates used, substituting catgut rings, untanned leather, cartilage,\r\nraw turnips, potatoes, etc. Recently Murphy of Chicago has invented a\r\nbutton, which has been extensively used all over the world, in place of\r\nsutures and rings, as a means of anastomosis. Hardly any subject has\r\nhad more discussion in recent literature than the merits of this\r\ningenious contrivance.\r\n\r\nForeign Bodies in the Rectum.--Probably the most celebrated case of\r\nforeign body introduced into the rectum is the classic one mentioned by\r\nHevin. Some students introduced the frozen tail of a pig in the anus of\r\na French prostitute. The bristles were cut short, and having prepared\r\nthe passage with oil, they introduced the tail with great force into\r\nthe rectum, allowing a portion to protrude. Great pain and violent\r\nsymptoms followed; there was distressing vomiting, obstinate\r\nconstipation, and fever. Despite the efforts to withdraw the tail, the\r\narrangement of the bristles which allowed entrance, prevented removal.\r\nOn the sixth day, in great agony, the woman applied to Marchettis, who\r\ningeniously adopted the simple procedure of taking a long hollow reed,\r\nand preparing one of its extremities so that it could be introduced\r\ninto the rectum, he was enabled to pass the reed entirely around the\r\ntail and to withdraw both. Relief was prompt, and the removal of the\r\nforeign body was followed by the issue of stercoraceous matter which\r\nhad accumulated the six days it had remained in situ.\r\n\r\nTuffet is quoted as mentioning a farmer of forty-six who, in\r\nmasturbation, introduced a barley-head into his urethra. It was found\r\nnecessary to cut the foreign body out of the side of the glans. A year\r\nlater he put in his anus a cylindric snuff-box of large size, and this\r\nhad to be removed by surgical methods.  Finally, a drinking goblet was\r\nused, but this resulted in death, after much suffering and lay\r\ntreatment. In his memoirs of the old Academy of Surgery in Paris,\r\nMorand speaks of a monk who, to cure a violent colic, introduced into\r\nhis fundament a bottle of l'eau de la reine de Hongrie, with a small\r\nopening in its mouth, by which the contents, drop by drop, could enter\r\nthe intestine. He found he could not remove the bottle, and violent\r\ninflammation ensued. It was at last necessary to secure a boy with a\r\nsmall hand to extract the bottle. There is a record of a case in which\r\na tin cup or tumbler was pushed up the rectum and then passed into the\r\ncolon where it caused gangrene and death. It was found to measure 3 1/2\r\nby 3 1/2 by two inches. There is a French case in which a preserve-pot\r\nthree inches in diameter was introduced into the rectum, and had to be\r\nbroken and extracted piece by piece.\r\n\r\nCloquet had a patient who put into his rectum a beer glass and a\r\npreserving pot. Montanari removed from the rectum of a man a mortar\r\npestle 30 cm. long, and Poulet mentions a pederast who accidentally\r\nkilled himself by introducing a similar instrument, 55 cm. long, which\r\nperforated his intestine. Studsgaard mentions that in the pathologic\r\ncollection at Copenhagen there is a long, smooth stone, 17 cm. long,\r\nweighing 900 gm., which a peasant had introduced into his rectum to\r\nrelieve prolapsus. The stone was extracted in 1756 by a surgeon named\r\nFrantz Dyhr. Jeffreys speaks of a person who, to stop diarrhea,\r\nintroduced into his rectum a piece of wood measuring seven inches.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable case recorded of a stick in the anus of a man of\r\nsixty, the superior extremity in the right hypochondrium, the inferior\r\nin the concavity of the sacrum. The stick measured 32 cm. in length;\r\nthe man recovered. It is impossible to comprehend this extent of\r\nstraightening of the intestine without great twisting of the mesocolon.\r\nTompsett mentions that he was called to see a workman of sixty-five,\r\nsuffering from extreme rectal hemorrhage. He found the man very feeble,\r\nwithout pulse, pale, and livid. By digital examination he found a hard\r\nbody in the rectum, which he was sure was not feces. This body he\r\nremoved with a polyp-forceps, and found it to be a cylindric\r\ncandle-box, which measured six inches in circumference, 2 1/2 in\r\nlength, and 1 1/2 in diameter. The removal was followed by a veritable\r\nflood of fecal material, and the man recovered. Lane reports\r\nperforation of the rectum by the introduction of two large pieces of\r\nsoap; there was coincident strangulated hernia.\r\n\r\nHunter mentions a native Indian, a resident of Coorla, who had\r\nintroduced a bullock's horn high up into his abdomen, which neither he\r\nnor his friends could extract. He was chloroformed and placed in the\r\nlithotomy position, his buttocks brought to the edge of the bed, and\r\nafter dilatation of the sphincter, by traction with the fingers and\r\ntooth-forceps, the horn was extracted. It measured 11 inches long. The\r\nyoung imbecile had picked it up on the road, where it had been rendered\r\nextremely rough by exposure, and this caused the difficulty in\r\nextraction.\r\n\r\nIn Nelson's Northern Lancet, 1852, there is the record of a case of a\r\nman at stool, who slipped on a cow's horn, which entered the rectum and\r\nlodged beyond the sphincter. It was only removed with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nA convict at Brest put up his rectum a box of tools. Symptoms of\r\nvomiting, meteorism, etc., began, and became more violent until the\r\nseventh day, when he died. After death, there was found in the\r\ntransverse colon, a cylindric or conic box, made of sheet iron, covered\r\nwith skin to protect the rectum and, doubtless, to aid expulsion. It\r\nwas six inches long and five inches broad and weighed 22 ounces. It\r\ncontained a piece of gunbarrel four inches long, a mother-screw steel,\r\na screw-driver, a saw of steel for cutting wood four inches long,\r\nanother saw for cutting metal, a boring syringe, a prismatic file, a\r\nhalf-franc piece and four one-franc pieces tied together with thread, a\r\npiece of thread, and a piece of tallow, the latter presumably for\r\ngreasing the instruments. On investigation it was found that these\r\nconic cases were of common use, and were always thrust up the rectum\r\nbase first. In excitement this prisoner had pushed the conic end up\r\nfirst, thus rendering expulsion almost impossible. Ogle gives an\r\ninteresting case of foreign body in the rectum of a boy of seventeen.\r\nThe boy was supposed to be suffering with an abdominal tumor about the\r\nsize of a pigeon's egg under the right cartilages; it had been noticed\r\nfour months before. On admission to the hospital the lad was suffering\r\nwith pain and jaundice; sixteen days later he passed a stick ten inches\r\nlong, which he reluctantly confessed that he had introduced into the\r\nanus.  During all his treatment he was conscious of the nature of his\r\ntrouble, but he suffered rather than confess. Studsgaard mentions a man\r\nof thirty-five who, for the purpose of stopping diarrhea, introduced\r\ninto his rectum a preserve-bottle nearly seven inches long with the\r\nopen end uppermost. The next morning he had violent pain in the\r\nabdomen, and the bottle could be felt through the abdominal wall. It\r\nwas necessary to perform abdominal section through the linea alba,\r\ndivide the sigmoid flexure, and thus remove the bottle. The intestine\r\nwas sutured and the patient recovered. The bottle measured 17 cm. long,\r\nfive cm. in diameter at its lower end, and three cm. at its upper end.\r\n\r\nBriggs reports a case in which a wine glass was introduced into the\r\nrectum, and although removed twenty-four hours afterward, death ensued.\r\nHockenhull extracted 402 stones from the rectum of a boy of seven.\r\nLanderer speaks of a curious case in which the absorptive power of the\r\nrectum was utilized in the murder of a boy of fifteen. In order to come\r\ninto the possession of a large inheritance the murderess poisoned the\r\nboy by introducing the ends of some phosphorous matches into his\r\nrectum, causing death that night; there was intense inflammation of the\r\nrectum. The woman was speedily apprehended, and committed suicide when\r\nher crime was known.\r\n\r\nComplete transfixion of the abdomen does not always have a fatal issue.\r\nIn fact, two older writers, Wisemann and Muys, testify that it is quite\r\npossible for a person to be transfixed without having any portion of\r\nthe intestines or viscera wounded. In some nations in olden times, the\r\nextremest degree of punishment was transfixion by a stake. In his\r\nvoyages and travels, in describing the death of the King of Demaa at\r\nthe hands of his page, Mendez Pinto says that instead of being reserved\r\nfor torture, as were his successors Ravaillac, and Gerard, the slayer\r\nof William the Silent, the assassin was impaled alive with a long stake\r\nwhich was thrust in at his fundament and came out at the nape of his\r\nneck. There is a record of a man of twenty-five, a soldier in the\r\nChinese war of 1860, who, in falling from his horse, was accidentally\r\ntransfixed by a bayonet. The steel entered his back two inches to the\r\nleft of the last dorsal vertebra, and reappeared two inches to the left\r\nand below the umbilicus; as there was no symptom of visceral wound\r\nthere were apparently no injuries except perforation of the parietes\r\nand the peritoneum.  The man recovered promptly.\r\n\r\nRoss reports a case of transfixion in a young male aborigine, a native\r\nof New South Wales, who had received a spear-wound in the epigastrium\r\nduring a quarrel; extraction was impossible because of the\r\nsharp-pointed barbs; the spear was, therefore, sawed off, and was\r\nremoved posteriorly by means of a small incision. The edges of the\r\nwound were cleansed, stitched, and a compress and bandage applied.\r\nDuring the night the patient escaped and joined his comrades in the\r\ncamp, and on the second day was suffering with radiating pains and\r\ndistention. The following day it was found that the stitches and\r\nplaster had been removed, and the anterior wound was gaping and\r\ncontained an ichorous discharge.  The patient was bathing the wound\r\nwith a decoction of the leaves of the red-gum tree. Notwithstanding\r\nthat the spear measured seven inches, and the interference of\r\ntreatment, the abdominal wound closed on the sixth day, and recovery\r\nwas uninterrupted.  Gilkrist mentions an instance in which a ramrod was\r\nfired into a soldier's abdomen, its extremity lodging in the spinal\r\ncolumn, without causing the slightest evidence of wounds of the\r\nintestines or viscera. A minute postmortem examination was held some\r\ntime afterward, the soldier having died by drowning, but the results\r\nwere absolutely negative as regards any injury done by the passage of\r\nthe ramrod.\r\n\r\nHumphreys says that a boy of eleven, while \"playing soldier\" with\r\nanother boy, accidentally fell on a rick-stake. The stake was slightly\r\ncurved at its upper part, being 43 inches long and three inches in\r\ncircumference, and sharp-pointed at its extremity. As much as 17 1/2\r\ninches entered the body of the lad. The stake entered just in front of\r\nthe right spermatic cord, passed beneath Poupart's ligament into the\r\ncavity of the abdomen, traversed the whole cavity across to the left\r\nside; it then entered the thorax by perforating the diaphragm,\r\ndisplaced the heart by pushing it to the right of the sternum, and\r\npierced the left lung. It then passed anteriorly under the muscles and\r\nintegument in the axillary space, along the upper third of the humerus,\r\nwhich was extended beyond the head, the external skin not being\r\nruptured.  The stick remained in situ for four hours before attempts at\r\nextraction were made. On account of the displacement of the heart it\r\nwas decided not to give chloroform. The boy was held down by four men,\r\nand Humphreys and his assistant made all the traction in their power.\r\nAfter removal not more than a teaspoonful of blood followed. The heart\r\nstill remained displaced, and a lump of intestine about the size of an\r\norange protruded from the wound and was replaced. The boy made a slow\r\nand uninterrupted recovery, and in six weeks was able to sit up. The\r\ntesticle sloughed, but five months later, when the boy was examined, he\r\nwas free from pain and able to walk. There was a slight enlargement of\r\nthe abdomen and a cicatrix of the wound in the right groin. The right\r\ntesticle was absent, and the apex of the heart was displaced about an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nWoodbury reports the case of a girl of fourteen, who fell seven or\r\neight feet directly upon an erect stake in a cart; the tuberosity was\r\nfirst struck, and then the stake passed into the anus, up the rectum\r\nfor two inches, thence through the rectal wall, and through the body in\r\nan obliquely upward direction.  Striking the ribs near the left nipple\r\nit fractured three, and made its exit. The stake was three inches in\r\ncircumference, and 27 inches of its length passed into the body, six or\r\nseven inches emerging from the chest. This girl recovered so rapidly\r\nthat she was able to attend school six weeks afterward. In a case\r\nreported by Bailey a middle-aged woman, while sliding down a hay-stack,\r\nstruck directly upon a pitchfork handle which entered the vagina; the\r\nwhole weight of the woman was successfully maintained by the cellular\r\ntissue of the uterovaginal culdesac.\r\n\r\nMinot speaks of the passage of one prong of a pitchfork through the\r\nbody of a man of twenty-one, from the perineum to the umbilicus; the\r\nman recovered.\r\n\r\nHamilton reports a case of laceration of the perineum with penetration\r\nof the pelvic cavity to the depth of ten inches by a stick 3/4 inch\r\nthick. Prowse mentions the history of a case of impalement in a man of\r\nthirty-four, who, coming down a hay-stack, alighted on the handle of a\r\npitchfork which struck him in the middle of the scrotum, and passed up\r\nbetween the skin and fascia to the 10th rib. Recovery was prompt.\r\n\r\nThere are several cases on record in which extensive wounds of the\r\nabdominal parietes with protrusion and injury to the intestine have not\r\nbeen followed by death. Injuries to the intestines themselves have\r\nalready been spoken of, but there are several cases of evisceration\r\nworthy of record.\r\n\r\nDoughty says that at midnight on June 7, 1868, he was called to see a\r\nman who had been stabbed in a street altercation with a negro. When\r\nfirst seen in the street, the patient was lying on his back with his\r\nabdomen exposed, from which protruded an enormous mass of intestines,\r\nwhich were covered with sand and grit; the small intestine (ileum) was\r\nincised at one point and scratched at another by the passing knife. The\r\nincision, about an inch in length, was closed with a single stitch of\r\nsilk thread, and after thorough cleansing the whole mass was returned\r\nto the abdominal cavity. In this hernial protrusion were recognized\r\nfour or five feet of the ileum, the cecum with its appendix, part of\r\nthe ascending colon with corresponding portions of the mesentery; the\r\ndistribution of the superior mesentery, made more apparent by its\r\nliving pulsation, was more beautifully displayed in its succession of\r\narches than in any dissection that Doughty had ever witnessed.\r\nNotwithstanding the extent of his injuries the patient recovered, and\r\nat last reports was doing finely.\r\n\r\nBarnes reports the history of a negro of twenty-five who was admitted\r\nto the Freedmen's Hospital, New Orleans, May 15, 1867, suffering from\r\nan incised wound of the abdomen, from which protruded eight inches of\r\ncolon, all of the stomach, and nearly the whole of the small\r\nintestines. About 2 1/2 feet of the small intestine, having a whitish\r\ncolor, appeared to be filled with food and had much of the\r\ncharacteristic feeling of a sausage. The rest of the small intestine\r\nhad a dark-brown color, and the stomach and colon, distended with gas,\r\nwere leaden-colored. The viscera had been exposed to the atmosphere for\r\nover an hour.  Having nothing but cold Mississippi water to wash them\r\nwith, Barnes preferred returning the intestines without any attempt at\r\nremoving blood and dirt further than wiping with a cambric handkerchief\r\nand the stripping they would naturally be subjected to in being\r\nreturned through the opening. In ten minutes they were returned; they\r\nwere carefully examined inch by inch for any wound, but none was found.\r\nThree silver sutures were passed through the skin, and a firm compress\r\napplied. The patient went to sleep shortly after his wound was dressed,\r\nand never had a single subsequent bad symptom; he was discharged on May\r\n24th, the wound being entirely healed, with the exception of a\r\ncartilage of a rib which had not reunited.\r\n\r\nRogers mentions the case of a carpenter of thirty-six who was struck by\r\na missile thrown by a circular saw, making a wound two inches above the\r\numbilicus and to the left. Through the opening a mass of intestines and\r\na portion of the liver, attached by a pedicle, protruded. A portion of\r\nthe liver was detached, and the liver, as well as the intestines, were\r\nreplaced, and the man recovered.\r\n\r\nBaillie, Bhadoory, Barker, Edmundson, Johnson, and others, record\r\ninstances of abdominal wounds accompanied by extensive protrusion of\r\nthe intestines, and recovery. Shah mentions an abdominal wound with\r\nprotrusion of three feet of small intestine. By treatment with ice,\r\nphenol, and opium, recovery was effected without peritonitis.\r\n\r\nAmong nonfatal perforating gunshot wounds of the abdomen, Loring:\r\nreports the case of a private in the First Artillery who recovered\r\nafter a double gunshot perforation of the abdomen. One of the balls\r\nentered 5 1/2 inches to the left of the umbilicus, and two inches above\r\nthe crest of the ilium, making its exit two inches above the crest of\r\nthe ilium, on a line with and two inches from the 4th lumbar vertebra.\r\nThe other ball entered four inches below and to the rear of the left\r\nnipple, making its exit four inches directly below the point of\r\nentrance. In their passages these balls did not wound any of the\r\nviscera, and with the exception of traumatic fever there was no\r\ndisturbance of the health of the patient. Schell records the case of a\r\nsoldier who was wounded July 3, 1867, by a conoid ball from a Remington\r\nrevolver of the Army pattern. The ball entered on the left side of the\r\nabdomen, its lower edge grazing the center of Poupart's ligament, and\r\npassing backward, inward, and slightly upward, emerged one inch to the\r\nleft of the spinous process of the sacrum. On July 6th all the symptoms\r\nof peritonitis made their appearance. On July 11th there was free\r\ndischarge of fecal matter from both anterior and posterior wounds. This\r\ndischarge continued for three days and then ceased. By August 12th both\r\nwounds were entirely healed. Mineer reports a case of a wound from a\r\nrevolver-ball entering the abdomen, passing through the colon, and\r\nextracted just above the right ilium. Under simple treatment the\r\npatient recovered and was returned to duty about ten weeks afterward.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of cases on record in which a bullet entering the\r\nabdominal cavity is subsequently voided either by the bladder or by the\r\nbowel. Ducachet mentions two cases at the Georgetown Seminary Hospital\r\nduring the late war in which Minie balls entering the abdominal wall\r\nwere voided by the anus in a much battered condition. Bartlett reports\r\nthe case of a young man who was accidentally shot in the abdomen with a\r\nColt's revolver.  Immediately after the accident he complained of\r\nconstant and pressing desire to void his urine. While urinating on the\r\nevening of the third day, the ball escaped from the urethra and fell\r\nwith a click into the chamber. After the discharge of the ball the\r\nintolerable symptoms improved, and in two or three weeks there was\r\ncomplete recovery. Hoag mentions a man who was wounded by a round\r\nmusket-ball weighing 400 grains. It had evidently passed through the\r\nlung and diaphragm and entered the alimentary canal; it was voided by\r\nthe rectum five days after the injury. Lenox mentions the fact of a\r\nbullet entering the abdominal wall and subsequently being passed from\r\nthe rectum. Day and Judkins report similar cases. Rundle speaks of the\r\nlodgment of a bullet, and its escape, after a period of seven and\r\none-half years, into the alimentary canal, causing internal\r\nstrangulation and death.\r\n\r\nWounds of the liver often end very happily, and there are many cases on\r\nrecord in which such injuries have been followed by recovery, even when\r\nassociated with considerable loss of liver-substance. In the older\r\nrecords, Glandorp and Scultetus mention cures after large wounds of the\r\nliver. Fabricius Hildanus reports a case that ended happily, in which a\r\npiece of liver was found in the wound, having been separated by a\r\nsword-thrust.  There is a remarkable example of recovery after multiple\r\nvisceral wounds, self-inflicted by a lunatic. This man had 18 wounds,\r\n14 having penetrated the abdomen, the liver, colon, and the jejunum\r\nbeing injured; by frequent bleeding, strict regimen, dressing, etc., he\r\nrecovered his health and senses, but relapsing a year and a half later,\r\nhe again attempted suicide, which gave the opportunity for a postmortem\r\nto learn the extent of the original injuries. Plater, Schenck,\r\nCabrolius, the Ephemerides, and Nolleson mention recovery after wounds\r\nof the liver. Salmuth and the Ephemerides report questionable instances\r\nin which portions of the liver were ejected in violent vomiting.\r\nMacpherson describes a wound of the liver occurring in a Hindoo of\r\nsixty who had been struck by a spear. A portion of the liver was\r\nprotruding, and a piece weighing 1 1/4 ounces was removed, complete\r\nrecovery following.\r\n\r\nPostempski mentions a case of suture of the liver after a stab-wound.\r\nSix sutures of chromicized cat-gut were carefully tightened and\r\nfastened with a single loop. The patient left his bed on the sixth day\r\nand completely recovered. Gann reports a case of harpoon-wound of the\r\nliver. While in a dory spearing fish in the Rio Nuevo, after a sudden\r\nlurch of the boat, a young man of twenty-eight fell on the sharp point\r\nof a harpoon, which penetrated his abdomen. About one inch of the\r\nharpoon was seen protruding from below the tip of the ensiform\r\ncartilage; the harpoon was seven inches long. It was found that the\r\ninstrument had penetrated the right lobe of the liver; on passing the\r\nhand backward along the inferior surface of the liver, the point could\r\nbe felt projecting through its posterior border. On account of two\r\nsharp barbs on the spear-point, it was necessary to push the harpoon\r\nfurther in to disengage the barbs, after which it was easily removed.\r\nRecovery followed, and the patient was discharged in twenty-one days.\r\n\r\nRomme discusses the subject of punctured wounds of the liver, as a\r\nspecial text using the case of the late President Carnot. He says that\r\nin 543 cases of traumatism of the liver collected by Elder, 65 were\r\ncaused by cutting or sharp-pointed instruments. Of this group, 23\r\nrecovered and 42 died. The chief causes of death were hemorrhage and\r\nperitonitis. The principal symptoms of wounds of the liver, such as\r\ntraumatic shock, collapse, local and radiating pains, nausea, vomiting,\r\nand respiratory disturbances were all present in the case of President\r\nCarnot. From an experience gained in the case of the President, Romme\r\nstrongly recommends exploratory celiotomy in all penetrating wounds of\r\nthe liver. Zeidler reports three cases of wound of the liver in which\r\nrecovery ensued. The hemorrhage in one case was arrested by the tampon,\r\nand in the other by the Pacquelin cautery.\r\n\r\nMcMillan describes a man of twenty who was kicked by a horse over the\r\nliver and rupturing that organ. A large quantity of offensive fluid was\r\ndrawn off from the liver, and the man recovered. Frazer reports a case\r\nof rupture of liver and kidney in a boy of thirteen who was squeezed\r\nbetween the tire and driving chain of a mill, but who recovered despite\r\nhis serious symptoms. Allen mentions recovery after an extensive\r\nincised wound of the abdomen, liver, and lung. Massie cites an instance\r\nof gunshot wound of the right hypochondrium, with penetration and\r\nprotrusion of the liver. The patient, a boy of seven, recovered after\r\nexcision of a small part of the protruding liver. Lawson Tait has\r\nincised the liver to the extent of three inches, evacuated two gallons\r\nof hydatids, and obtained successful recovery in ten weeks.\r\n\r\nThere are several cases of wound of the liver followed by recovery\r\nreported by surgeons of the United States Army.  Whitehead mentions a\r\nman of twenty-two who on June 3, 1867, was shot in the liver by a slug\r\nfrom a pistol. At the time of the injury he bled freely from the wound\r\nof entrance continuing to lose blood and bile until daylight the next\r\nmorning, when the hemorrhage ceased, but the flow of bile kept on. By\r\nJune 10th there was considerable improvement, but the wound discharged\r\nblood-clots, bile, and serum. When the patient left the hospital on\r\nJuly 15th the wound was healthy, discharging less than 1 1/2 ounces\r\nduring the twenty-four hours, of a mixture of free bile, and bile mixed\r\nwith thick material. When last heard from--July 27, 1867--the patient\r\nwas improving finely in flesh and strength.  McKee mentions a\r\ncommissary-sergeant stationed at Santa Fe, New Mexico, who recovered\r\nafter a gunshot wound of the liver. Hassig reports the case of a\r\nprivate of twenty-six who was wounded in a fray near Paducah, Kentucky,\r\nby a conoid ball, which passed through the liver. The ball was cut out\r\nthe same day. The patient recovered and was returned to duty in May,\r\n1868. Patzki mentioned a private in the Sixth Cavalry, aged\r\ntwenty-five, who recovered from a gunshot wound of the abdomen,\r\npenetrating the right lobe of the liver and the gall-bladder.\r\n\r\nResection of the Liver.--It is remarkable to what extent portions of\r\nthe liver may be resected by the knife, cautery, or ligature, and the\r\npatient recover. Langenbuch records a case in which he successfully\r\nremoved the greater portion of the left lobe of a woman of thirty. The\r\nlobe had been extensively deformed by tight lacing, and caused serious\r\ninconvenience. There was considerable hemorrhage, but the vessels were\r\nsecured, and the woman made a good recovery. McWhinnie, in The Lancet,\r\nrecords a case of dislodgment of an enlarged liver from tight lacing.\r\nTerrilon mentions an instance in which a portion of the liver was\r\nremoved by ligature after celiotomy. The ligature was removed in seven\r\ndays, and the sphacelated portion of the liver came off with it.  A\r\ncicatrix was completed at the end of six weeks, and the patient, a\r\nwoman of fifty-three, made an excellent recovery.  Bastianelli\r\ndiscusses those cases in which portions of the liver, having been\r\nconstricted from the general body of the organ and remaining attached\r\nby a pedicle, give rise to movable tumors of the abdomen. He records\r\nsuch a case in a woman of thirty-seven who had five children. A piece\r\nof liver weighing 500 grams was removed, and with it the gall-bladder,\r\nand the patient made an uninterrupted recovery. Tricomi reports a case\r\nin which it was found necessary to remove the left lobe of the liver.\r\nAn attempt had been made to remove a liver-tumor the size of a fist by\r\nconstricting the base with an elastic ligature. This attempt was a\r\nfailure, and cure was also unsuccessfully attempted by wire ligature\r\nand the thermocautery. The growth was cut away, bleeding was arrested\r\nby the thermocautery and by iron-solution, the wound entirely healed,\r\nand the patient recovered. Valerian von Meister has proved that the\r\nliver has marvelous powers of regeneration, and that in rabbits, cats,\r\nand dogs, even three-fourths of the organ may be reproduced in from\r\nforty-five to sixty-five days.  This regeneration is brought about\r\nchiefly by hypertrophy of the lobules.\r\n\r\nFloating liver is a rare malady in which the liver forms an abdominal\r\nprominence that may be moved about, and which changes its situation as\r\nthe patient shifts the attitude. The condition usually arises from a\r\nlax abdominal wall following repeated pregnancies. The accompanying\r\nillustration exhibits a typical case verified by postmortem examination.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the Liver.--The average weight of the normal liver is\r\nfrom 50 to 55 ounces, but as noted by Powell, it may become so\r\nhypertrophic as to weigh as much as 40 pounds. Bonet describes a liver\r\nweighing 18 pounds; and in his \"Medical and Surgical Observations,\"\r\nGooch speaks of a liver weighing 28 pounds.  Vieussens, the celebrated\r\nanatomist, reports an instance in which the liver weighed 20 pounds,\r\nand in his \"Aphorisms,\" Vetter cites a similar instance. In 1811 Kraus\r\nof Germany describes a liver weighing 25 pounds; modern instances of\r\nenlarged liver are too numerous to be quoted here.\r\n\r\nRupture of the gall-bladder, although generally followed by death, is\r\nnot always fatal. In such cases bile is usually found in the abdominal\r\ncavity. Fergus mentions a case in which, after this accident, the\r\npatient was considered convalescent and was walking about, when, on the\r\nseventh day, peritonitis suddenly developed and proved fatal in two\r\ndays. Several cases of this accident have been reported as treated\r\nsuccessfully by incision and drainage (Lane) or by inspiration (Bell).\r\nIn these cases large quantities of bile escaped into the abdominal\r\ncavity.  Peritonitis does not necessarily follow. Cholecystotomy for\r\nthe relief of the distention of the gall-bladder from obstruction of\r\nthe common or cystic duct and for the removal of gall-stones was first\r\nperformed in 1867 by Bobbs of Indianapolis, but it is to Marion Sims,\r\nin 1878, that perfection of the operation is due. It has been gradually\r\nimproved and developed, until today it is a most successful operation.\r\nTait reports 54 cases with 52 perfect recoveries. Cholyecystectomy, or\r\nexcision of the gall-bladder, was first practiced in 1880 by Langenbuch\r\nof Berlin, and is used in cases in which gall-stones are repeatedly\r\nforming. Ashhurst's statistics show only four deaths in 28 cases.\r\n\r\nAt St. Bartholomew's Hospital, in London, is a preserved specimen of a\r\ngall-bladder which had formed the contents of a hernial sac, and which,\r\nnear the fundus, shows a constriction caused by the femoral ring. It\r\nwas taken from a woman of forty-five who was admitted into the hospital\r\nwith a strangulated femoral hernia.  The sac was opened and its\r\ncontents were returned. The woman died in a few days from peritonitis.\r\nThe gall-bladder was found close to the femoral ring, and showed a\r\nmarked constriction. The liver was misshapen from tight lacing,\r\nelongated and drawn downward toward the ring. There was no evidence\r\nthat any portion of intestine or other structure besides the\r\ngall-bladder had passed through the ring.\r\n\r\nThe fatality of rupture of the spleen is quite high. Out of 83 cases of\r\ninjury to this organ collected by Elder, and quoted by MacCormac, only\r\n11 recovered; but the mortality is less in punctured or incised wounds\r\nof this organ, the same authorities mentioning 29 recoveries out of 35\r\ncases. In his \"Surgery\" Gooch says that at the battle of Dettingen one\r\nof Sir Robert Rich's Dragoons was left all night on the field,\r\nweltering in his blood, his spleen hanging out of his body in a\r\ngangrenous state. The next morning he was carried to the surgeons who\r\nligated the large vessels, and extirpated the spleen; the man recovered\r\nand was soon able to do duty. In the Philosophical Transactions there\r\nis a report of a man who was wounded in the spleen by a large\r\nhunting-knife. Fergusson found the spleen hanging from the wound and\r\nligated it. It separated in ten days and the patient recovered.\r\n\r\nWilliams reports a stab-wound of the spleen in a negro of twenty-one.\r\nThe spleen protruded, and the protruding part was ligated by a silver\r\nwire, one-half of the organ sloughing off; the patient recovered. Sir\r\nAstley Cooper mentions a curious case, in which, after vomiting, during\r\nwhich the spleen was torn from its attachments, this organ produced a\r\nswelling in the groin which was supposed to be a hernia. The vomiting\r\ncontinued, and at the end of a week the woman died; it was then found\r\nthat the spleen had been turned half round on its axis, and detached\r\nfrom the diaphragm; it had become enlarged; the twist interrupted the\r\nreturn of the blood. Portal speaks of a rupture of the spleen simply\r\nfrom engorgement. There was no history of a fall, contusion, or other\r\ninjury. Tait describes a case of rupture of the spleen in a woman who,\r\nin attempting to avoid her husband's kick, fell on the edge of the\r\ntable. There were no signs of external violence, but she died the third\r\nday afterward. The abdomen was found full of blood, and the spleen and\r\nperitoneal covering was ruptured for three inches.\r\n\r\nSplenectomy, excision of the spleen, has been performed a number of\r\ntimes, with varying results, but is more successful when performed for\r\ninjury than when for disease. Ashhurst has tabulated a total of 109\r\noperations, 27 having been for traumatic causes, and all but five\r\nhaving terminated successfully; of 82 operations for disease, only 32\r\nrecovered. Vulpius has collected 117 cases of splenectomy, with a\r\ndeath-rate of 50 per cent. If, however, from these cases we deduct\r\nthose suffering with leukocythemia and lardaceous spleen, in which the\r\noperation should not be performed, the mortality in the remaining 85\r\ncases is reduced to 33 per cent. Terrier speaks of splenectomy for\r\ntorsion or twisting of the pedicle, and such is mentioned by Sir Astley\r\nCooper, who has found records of only four such cases.  Conklin reports\r\na successful case of splenectomy for malarial spleen, and in reviewing\r\nthe subject he says that the records of the past decade in operations\r\nfor simple hypertrophy, including malaria, show 20 recoveries and eight\r\ndeaths. He also adds that extirpation in cases of floating or displaced\r\nspleen was attended with brilliant results. Zuccarelli is accredited\r\nwith reporting two cases of splenectomy for malarial spleen, both of\r\nwhich recovered early. He gives a table of splenectomies performed in\r\nItaly, in which there were nine cases of movable spleen, with two\r\ndeaths; eight cases of simple hypertrophy, with three deaths; 12 cases\r\nof malarial spleen, with three deaths; four cases of leukemia and\r\npseudoleukemia, with two deaths. In his experiments on rabbits it was\r\nproved by Tizzoni, and in his experiments on dogs, by Crede, that an\r\nindividual could live without a spleen; but these observations were\r\nonly confirmatory of what had long been known, for, in 1867, Pean\r\nsuccessfully removed a spleen from a woman of twenty. Tricomi reports\r\neight cases in which he had extirpated the spleen for various morbid\r\nconditions, with a fortunate issue in all but one. In one case he\r\nligated the splenic artery. In The Lancet there is an account of three\r\nrecent excisions of the spleen for injury at St. Thomas Hospital in\r\nLondon, and it is added that they are among the first of this kind in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nAbnormalities of Size of the Spleen.--The spleen may be extremely\r\nsmall. Storck mentions a spleen that barely weighed an ounce; Schenck\r\nspeaks of one in the last century that weighed as much as 20 pounds.\r\nFrank describes a spleen that weighed 16 pounds; there is another\r\nrecord of one weighing 15 pounds. Elliot mentions a spleen weighing 11\r\npounds; Burrows one, 11 pounds; Blasius, four pounds; Osiander, nine\r\npounds; Blanchard, 31 pounds; Richardson, 3 1/2 pounds; and Hare, 93\r\nounces.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic duct, although so much protected by its anatomical\r\nposition, under exceptional circumstances has been ruptured or wounded.\r\nKirchner has collected 17 cases of this nature, two of which were due\r\nto contusions of the chest, one each to a puncture, a cut, and a\r\nshot-wound, and three to erosion from suppuration. In the remaining\r\ncases the account fails to assign a definite cause. Chylothorax, or\r\nchylous ascites, is generally a result of this injury. Krabbel mentions\r\na patient who was run over by an empty coal car, and who died on the\r\nfifth day from suffocation due to an effusion into the right pleural\r\ncavity. On postmortem examination it was found that the effusion was\r\nchyle, the thoracic duct being torn just opposite the 9th dorsal\r\nvertebra, which had been transversely fractured. In one of Kirchner's\r\ncases a girl of nine had been violently pushed against a window-sill,\r\nstriking the front of her chest in front of the 3d rib. She suffered\r\nfrom pleural effusion, which, on aspiration, proved to be chyle. She\r\nultimately recovered her health. In 1891 Eyer reported a case of\r\nrupture of the thoracic duct, causing death on the thirty-eighth day.\r\nThe young man had been caught between a railroad car and an engine, and\r\nno bones were broken.\r\n\r\nManley reports a case of rupture of the thoracic duct in a man of\r\nthirty-five, who was struck by the pole of a brewery wagon; he was\r\nknocked down on his back, the wheel passing squarely over his abdomen.\r\nThere was subsequent bulging low down in the right iliac fossa, caused\r\nby the presence of a fluid, which chemic and microscopic examination\r\nproved was chyle. From five to eight ounces a day of this fluid were\r\ndischarged, until the tenth day, when the bulging was opened and\r\ndrained. On the fifteenth day the wound was healed and the man left the\r\nhospital quite restored to health.\r\n\r\nKeen has reported four instances of accidental injury to the thoracic\r\nduct, near its termination at the base of the left side of the neck;\r\nthe wounding was in the course of removals for deep-seated growths in\r\nthis region. Three of the cases recovered, having sustained no\r\ndetriment from the injury to the thoracic duct. One died; but the fatal\r\ninfluence was not specially connected with the wound of the duct.\r\n\r\nPossibly the boldest operation in the history of surgery is that for\r\nligation of the abdominal aorta for inguinal aneurysm. It was first\r\npracticed by Sir Astley Cooper in 1817, and has since been performed\r\nseveral times with a uniformly fatal result, although Monteiro's\r\npatient survived until the tenth day, and there is a record in which\r\nligature of the abdominal aorta did not cause death until the eleventh\r\nday. Loreta of Bologna is accredited with operating on December 18,\r\n1885, for the relief of a sailor who was suffering from an abdominal\r\naneurysm caused by a blow. An incision was made from the ensiform\r\ncartilage to the umbilicus, the aneurysm exposed, and its cavity filled\r\nup with two meters of silver-plated wire. Twenty days after no evidence\r\nof pulsation remained in the sac, and three months later the sailor was\r\nwell and able to resume his duties.\r\n\r\nLigation of the common iliac artery, which, in a case of gunshot\r\ninjury, was first practiced by Gibson of Philadelphia in 1812, is,\r\nhappily, not always fatal. Of 82 cases collected by Ashhurst, 23\r\nterminated successfully.\r\n\r\nForeign bodies loose in the abdominal cavity are sometimes voided at\r\nstool, or may suppurate externally. Fabricius Hildanus gives us a\r\nhistory of a person wounded with a sword-thrust into the abdomen, the\r\npoint breaking off. The sword remained one year in the belly and was\r\nvoided at stool. Erichsen mentions an instance in which a cedar\r\nlead-pencil stayed for eight months in the abdominal cavity. Desgranges\r\ngives a case of a fish-spine in the abdominal cavity, and ten years\r\nafterward it ulcerated through an abscess in the abdominal wall.\r\nKeetley speaks of a man who was shot when a boy; at the time of the\r\naccident the boy had a small spelling-book in his pocket. It was not\r\nuntil adult life that from an abscess of the groin was expelled what\r\nremained of the spelling-book that had been driven into the abdomen\r\nduring boyhood. Kyle speaks of the removal of a corn-straw 33 inches in\r\nlength by an incision ten inches long, at a point about equidistant\r\nfrom the umbilicus to the anterior spinous process of the right ilium.\r\n\r\nThere are several instances on record of tolerance of foreign bodies in\r\nthe skin and muscles of the back for an extended period. Gay speaks of\r\na curious case in which the point of a sheath-knife remained in the\r\nback of an individual for nine years. Bush reported to Sir Astley\r\nCooper the history of a man who, as he supposed, received a wound in\r\nthe back by canister shot while serving on a Tartar privateer in 1779.\r\nThere was no ship-surgeon on board, and in about a month the wound\r\nhealed without surgical assistance. The man suffered little\r\ninconvenience and performed his duties as a seaman, and was impressed\r\ninto the Royal Navy. In August, 1810, he complained of pain in the\r\nlumbar region. He was submitted to an examination, and a cicatrix of\r\nthis region was noticed, and an extraneous body about 1/2 inch under\r\nthe integument was felt. An incision was made down it, and a rusty\r\nblade of a seaman's clasp-knife extracted from near the 3d lumbar\r\nvertebra. The man had carried this knife for thirty years. The wound\r\nhealed in a few days and there was no more inconvenience.\r\n\r\nFracture of the lower part of the spine is not always fatal, and\r\nnotwithstanding the lay-idea that a broken back means certain death,\r\npatients with well-authenticated cases of vertebral fracture have\r\nrecovered. Warren records the case of a woman of sixty who, while\r\ncarrying a clothes-basket, made a misstep and fell 14 feet, the basket\r\nof wet clothes striking the right shoulder, chest, and neck. There was\r\nfracture of the 4th dorsal vertebra at the transverse processes. By\r\nseizing the spinous process it could be bent backward and forward, with\r\nthe peculiar crepitus of fractured bone. The clavicle was fractured two\r\ninches from the acromial end, and the sternal end was driven high up\r\ninto the muscles of the neck. The arm and hand were paralyzed, and the\r\nwoman suffered great dyspnea. There was at first a grave emphysematous\r\ncondition due to the laceration of several broken ribs. There was also\r\nsuffusion and ecchymosis about the neck and shoulder. Although\r\ncomplicated with tertiary syphilis, the woman made a fair recovery, and\r\neight weeks later she walked into a doctor's office. Many similar and\r\nequally wonderful injuries to the spine are on record.\r\n\r\nThe results sometimes following the operation of laminectomy for\r\nfracture of the vertebrae are often marvelous. One of the most\r\nsuccessful on record is that reported by Dundore. The patient was a\r\nsingle man who lived in Mahanoy, Pa., and was admitted to the State\r\nHospital for Injured Persons, Ashland, Pa., June 17, 1889, suffering\r\nfrom a partial dislocation of the 9th dorsal vertebra.  The report is\r\nas follows--\"He had been a laborer in the mines, and while working was\r\ninjured March 18, 1889, by a fall of top rock, and from this date to\r\nthat of his admission had been under the care of a local physician\r\nwithout any sign of improvement. At the time of his admission he\r\nweighed but 98 pounds, his weight previous to the injury being 145. He\r\nexhibited entire loss of motion in the lower extremities, with the\r\nexception of very slight movement in the toes of the left foot;\r\nsensation was almost nil up to the hips, above which it was normal; he\r\nhad complete retention of urine, with a severe cystitis. His tongue was\r\nheavily coated, the bowels constipated, and there was marked anorexia,\r\nwith considerable anemia. His temperature varied from 99 degrees to 100\r\ndegrees in the morning, and from 101 degrees to 103 degrees in the\r\nevening. The time which had elapsed since the accident precluded any\r\nattempt at reduction, and his anemic condition would not warrant a more\r\nradical method.\r\n\r\n\"He was put on light, nourishing diet, iron and strychnin were given\r\ninternally, and electricity was applied to the lower extremities every\r\nother day; the cystitis was treated by irrigating the bladder each day\r\nwith Thiersch's solution. By August his appetite and general condition\r\nwere much improved, and his weight had increased to 125 pounds, his\r\ntemperature being 99 degrees or less each morning, and seldom as high\r\nas 100 degrees at night. The cystitis had entirely disappeared, and he\r\nwas able, with some effort, to pass his urine without the aid of a\r\ncatheter. Sensation in both extremities had slightly improved, and he\r\nwas able to slightly move the toes of the right foot. This being his\r\ncondition, an operation was proposed as the only means of further and\r\npermanent improvement, and to this he eagerly consented, and,\r\naccordingly, on the 25th of August, the 9th dorsal vertebra was\r\ntrephined.\r\n\r\n\"The cord was found to be compressed and greatly congested, but there\r\nwas no evidence of laceration. The laminae and spinous processes of the\r\n8th and 9th dorsal vertebrae were cut away, thus relieving all pressure\r\non the cord; the wound was drained and sutured, and a plaster-of-Paris\r\njacket applied, a hole being cut out over the wound for the purpose of\r\nchanging the dressing when necessary. By September 1st union was\r\nperfect, and for the next month the patient remained in excellent\r\ncondition, but without any sign of improvement as to sensation and\r\nmotion. Early in October he was able to slightly move both legs, and\r\nhad full control of urination; from this time on his paralysis rapidly\r\nimproved; the battery was applied daily, with massage morning and\r\nevening; and in November the plaster-of-Paris jacket was removed, and\r\nhe propelled himself about the ward in a rolling chair, and shortly\r\nafter was able to get about slowly on crutches. He was discharged\r\nDecember 23d, and when I saw him six months later he walked very well\r\nand without effort; he carried a cane, but this seemed more from habit\r\nthan from necessity. At present date he weighs 150 pounds, and drives a\r\nhuckster wagon for a living, showing very little loss of motion in his\r\nlower extremities.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough few cases show such wonderful improvement as this one,\r\nstatistics prove that the results of this operation are sometimes most\r\nadvantageous. Thorburn collects statistics of 50 operations from 1814\r\nto 1885, undertaken for relief of injuries of the spinal cord. Lloyd\r\nhas compiled what is possibly the most extensive collection of cases of\r\nspinal surgery, his cases including operations for both disease and\r\ninjury. White has collected 37 cases of recent date; and Chipault\r\nreports two cases, and collected 33 cases. Quite a tribute to the\r\nmodern treatment by antisepsis is shown in the results of laminectomy.\r\nOf his non-antiseptic cases Lloyd reports a mortality of 65 per cent;\r\nthose surviving the operation are distributed as follows: Cured, one;\r\npartially cured, seven; unknown, two; no improvement, five. Of those\r\ncases operated upon under modern antiseptic principles, the mortality\r\nwas 50 per cent; those surviving were distributed as follows: Cured,\r\nfour; partially cured, 15; no improvement, 11. The mortality in White's\r\ncases, which were all done under antiseptic precautions, was 38 per\r\ncent. Of those surviving, there were six complete recoveries, six with\r\nbenefit, and 11 without marked benefit. Pyle collects 52 cases of\r\nspinal disease and injury, in which laminectomy was performed. All the\r\ncases were operated upon since 1890. Of the 52 cases there were 15\r\ndeaths (a mortality of 29.4 per cent), 26 recoveries with benefit, and\r\nfive recoveries in which the ultimate result has not been observed. It\r\nmust be mentioned that several of the fatal cases reported were those\r\nof cervical fracture, which is by far the most fatal variety.\r\n\r\nInjury to the spinal cord does not necessarily cause immediate death.\r\nMills and O'Hara, both of Philadelphia, have recorded instances of\r\nrecovery after penetrating wound of the spinal marrow. Eve reports\r\nthree cases of gunshot wound in which the balls lodged in the vertebral\r\ncanal, two of the patients recovering. He adds some remarks on the\r\ndivision of the spinal cord without immediate death.\r\n\r\nFord mentions a gunshot wound of the spinal cord, the patient living\r\nten days; after death the ball was found in the ascending aorta. Henley\r\nspeaks of a mulatto of twenty-four who was stabbed in the back with a\r\nknife. The blade entered the body of the 6th dorsal vertebra, and was\r\nso firmly embedded that the patient could be raised entirely clear of\r\nthe bed by the knife alone. An ultimate recovery ensued.\r\n\r\nAlthough the word hernia can be construed to mean the protrusion of any\r\nviscus from its natural cavity through normal or artificial openings in\r\nthe surrounding structures, the usual meaning of the word is protrusion\r\nof the abdominal contents through the parietes--what is commonly spoken\r\nof as rupture.  Hernia may be congenital or acquired, or may be single\r\nor multiple--as many as five having been seen in one individual.  More\r\nthan two-thirds of cases of rupture suffer from inguinal hernia In the\r\noblique form of inguinal hernia the abdominal contents descend along\r\nthe inguinal canal to the outer side of the epigastric artery, and\r\nenter the scrotum in the male, and the labium majus in the female. In\r\nthis form of hernia the size of the sac is sometimes enormous, the\r\naccompanying illustration showing extreme cases of both scrotal and\r\nlabial hernia.  Umbilical hernia may be classed under three heads:\r\ncongenital, infantile, and adult. Congenital umbilical hernia occurs\r\nmost frequently in children, and is brought about by the failure of the\r\nabdominal walls to close. When of large size it may contain not only\r\nthe intestines, but various other organs, such as the spleen, liver,\r\netc. In some monsters all the abdominal contents are contained in the\r\nhernia. Infantile umbilical hernia is common, and appears after the\r\nseparation of the umbilical cord; it is caused by the yielding of the\r\ncicatrix in this situation.  It never reaches a large size, and shows a\r\ntendency to spontaneous cure. Adult umbilical hernia rarely commences\r\nin infancy. It is most commonly seen in persons with pendulous bellies,\r\nand is sometimes of enormous size, in addition to the ordinary\r\nabdominal contents, containing even the stomach and uterus. A few years\r\nsince there was a man in Philadelphia past middle age, the victim of\r\nadult umbilical hernia so pendulous that while walking he had to\r\nsupport it with his arms and hands.  It was said that this hernia did\r\nnot enlarge until after his service as a soldier in the late war.\r\n\r\nAbbott recites the case of an Irish woman of thirty-five who applied to\r\nknow if she was pregnant. No history of a hernia could be elicited. No\r\npregnancy existed, but there was found a ventral hernia of the\r\nabdominal viscera through an opening which extended the entire length\r\nof the linea alba, and which was four inches wide in the middle of the\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\nPim saw a colored woman of twenty-four who, on December 29, 1858, was\r\ndelivered normally of her first child, and who died in bed at 3 A.M. on\r\nFebruary 12, 1859. The postmortem showed a tumor from the ensiform\r\ncartilage to the symphysis pubis, which contained the omentum, liver\r\n(left lobe), small intestines, and colon. It rested upon the abdominal\r\nmuscles of the right side. The pelvic viscera were normally placed and\r\nthere was no inguinal nor femoral hernia.\r\n\r\nHulke reports a case remarkable for the immense size of the rupture\r\nwhich protruded from a spot weakened by a former abscess.  There was a\r\npartial absence of the peritoneal sac, and the obstruction readily\r\nyielded to a clyster and laxative. The rupture had a transverse\r\ndiameter of 14 1/2 inches, with a vertical diameter of 11 1/2 inches.\r\nThe opening was in the abdominal walls outside of the internal inguinal\r\nring. The writhings of the intestines were very conspicuous through the\r\nwalls of the pouch.\r\n\r\nDade reports a case of prodigious umbilical hernia. The patient was a\r\nwidow of fifty-eight, a native of Ireland. Her family history was good,\r\nand she had never borne any children. The present dimensions of the\r\ntumor, which for fifteen years had been accompanied with pain, and had\r\nprogressively increased in size, are as follows: Circumference at the\r\nbase, 19 1/2 inches; circumference at the extremity, 11 1/4 inches;\r\ndistance of extremity from abdominal wall, 12 3/4 inches. Inspection\r\nshowed a large lobulated tumor protruding from the abdominal wall at\r\nthe umbilicus. The veins covering it were prominent and distended.  The\r\ncirculation of the skin was defective, giving it a blue appearance.\r\nVermicular contractions of the small intestines could be seen at the\r\ndistance of ten feet. The tumor was soft and velvety to the touch, and\r\ncould only partially be reduced.  Borborygmus could be easily heard. On\r\npercussion the note over the bulk was tympanitic, and dull at the base.\r\nThe distal extremity contained a portion of the small intestine instead\r\nof the colon, which Wood considered the most frequent occupant. The\r\numbilicus was completely obliterated. Dade believed that this hernia\r\nwas caused by the weakening of the abdominal walls from a blow, and\r\nconsidered that the protrusion came from an aperture near the umbilicus\r\nand not through it, in this manner differing from congenital umbilical\r\nhernia.\r\n\r\nA peculiar form of hernia is spontaneous rupture of the abdominal\r\nwalls, which, however, is very rare. There is an account of such a case\r\nin a woman of seventy-two living in Pittsburg, who, after a spasmodic\r\ncough, had a spontaneous rupture of the parietes. The rent was four\r\ninches in length and extended along the linea alba, and through it\r\nprotruded a mass of omentum about the size of a child's head. It was\r\nsuccessfully treated and the woman recovered. Wallace reports a case of\r\nspontaneous rupture of the abdominal wall, following a fit of coughing.\r\nThe skin was torn and a large coil of ileum protruded, uncovered by\r\nperitoneum.  After protracted exposure of the bowel it was replaced,\r\nthe rent was closed, and the patient recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSURGICAL ANOMALIES OF THE GENITO-URINARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nWounds of the kidney may be very severe without causing death, and even\r\none entire kidney may be lost without interfering with the functions of\r\nlife. Marvand, the Surgeon-Major of an Algerian regiment, reports the\r\ncase of a young Arab woman who had been severely injured in the right\r\nlumbar region by a weapon called a \"yataghan,\" an instrument which has\r\nonly one cutting edge. On withdrawing this instrument the right kidney\r\nwas extruded, became strangulated between the lips of the wound, and\r\ncaused considerable hemorrhage. A ligature was put around the base of\r\nthe organ, and after some weeks the mass separated. The patient\r\ncontinued in good health the whole time, and her urinary secretion was\r\nnormal. She was discharged in two months completely recovered. Price\r\nmentions the case of a groom who was kicked over the kidney by a horse,\r\nand eighteen months later died of dropsy.  Postmortem examination\r\nshowed traces of a line of rupture through the substance of the gland;\r\nthe preparation was deposited in St.  George's Hospital Museum in\r\nLondon. The case is singular in that this man, with granular\r\ndegeneration of the kidney, recovered from so extensive a lesion, and,\r\nmoreover, that he remained in perfect health for over a year with his\r\nkidney in a state of destructive disease. Borthwick mentions a dragoon\r\nof thirty who was stabbed by a sword-thrust on the left side under the\r\nshort rib, the sword penetrating the pelvis and wounding the kidney.\r\nThere was no hemorrhage from the external wound, nor pain in the\r\nspermatic cord or testicle. Under expectant treatment the man\r\nrecovered. Castellanos mentions a case of recovery from punctured wound\r\nof the kidney by a knife that penetrated the tubular and cortical\r\nsubstance, and entered the pelvis of the organ. The case was peculiar\r\nin the absence of two symptoms, viz., the escape of urine from the\r\nwound, and retraction of the corresponding testicle. Dusenbury reports\r\nthe case of a corporal in the army who was wounded on April 6, 1865,\r\nthe bullet entering both the liver and kidney. Though there was injury\r\nto both these important organs, there was no impairment of the\r\npatient's health, and he recovered.\r\n\r\nBryant reports four cases of wound of the kidney, with recovery.  All\r\nof these cases were probably extraperitoneal lacerations or ruptures.\r\nCock found a curious anomaly in a necropsy on the body of a boy of\r\neighteen, who had died after a fall from some height.  There was a\r\ncompound, transverse rupture of the left kidney, which was twice as\r\nlarge as usual, the ureter also being of abnormal size. Further search\r\nshowed that the right kidney was rudimentary, and had no vein or artery.\r\n\r\nWard mentions a case of ruptured kidney, caused by a fall of seven\r\nfeet, the man recovering after appropriate treatment.  Vernon reports a\r\ncase of serious injury to the kidney, resulting in recovery in nine\r\nweeks. The patient fell 40 feet, landing on some rubbish and old iron,\r\nand received a wound measuring six inches over the right iliac crest,\r\nthrough which the lower end of the right kidney protruded; a piece of\r\nthe kidney was lost. The case was remarkable because of the slight\r\namount of hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nNephrorrhaphy is an operation in which a movable or floating kidney is\r\nfixed by suture through its capsule, including a portion of\r\nkidney-substance, and then through the adjacent lumbar fascia and\r\nmuscles. The ultimate results of this operation have been most\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nNephrolithotomy is an operation for the removal of stone from the\r\nkidney. The operation may be a very difficult one, owing to the\r\nadhesions and thickening of all the perinephric tissues, or to the\r\nsmall size or remote location of the stone.\r\n\r\nThere was a recent exhibition in London, in which were shown the\r\nresults of a number of recent operations on the kidney. There was\r\none-half of a kidney that had been removed on account of a\r\nrapidly-growing sarcoma from a young man of nineteen, who had known of\r\nthe tumor for six months; there was a good recovery, and the man was\r\nquite well in eighteen months afterward. Another specimen was a right\r\nkidney removed at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. It was much dilated, and\r\nonly a small amount of the kidney-substance remained. A calculus\r\nblocked the ureter at its commencement. The patient was a woman of\r\nthirty-one, and made a good recovery. From the Middlesex Hospital was a\r\nkidney containing a uric acid calculus which was successfully removed\r\nfrom a man of thirty-five. From the Cancer Hospital at Brompton there\r\nwere two kidneys which had been removed from a man and a woman\r\nrespectively, both of whom made a good recovery. From the King's\r\nCollege Hospital there was a kidney with its pelvis enlarged and\r\noccupied by a large calculus, and containing little secreting\r\nsubstance, which was removed from a man of forty-nine, who recovered.\r\nThese are only a few of the examples of this most interesting\r\ncollection. Large calculi of the kidney are mentioned in Chapter XV.\r\n\r\nRupture of the ureter is a very rare injury. Poland has collected the\r\nhistories of four cases, one of which ended in recovery after the\r\nevacuation by puncture, at intervals, of about two gallons of fluid\r\nresembling urine. The other cases terminated in death during the first,\r\nfourth, and tenth weeks respectively.  Peritonitis was apparently not\r\npresent in any of the cases, the urinary extravasation having occurred\r\ninto the cellular tissue behind the peritoneum.\r\n\r\nThere are a few recorded cases of uncomplicated wounds of the ureters.\r\nThe only well authenticated case in which the ureter alone was divided\r\nis the historic injury of the Archbishop of Paris, who was wounded\r\nduring the Revolution of 1848, by a ball entering the upper part of the\r\nlumbar region close to the spine.  Unsuccessful attempts were made to\r\nextract the ball, and as there was no urine in the bladder, but a\r\nquantity escaping from the wound, a diagnosis of divided ureter was\r\nmade. The Archbishop died in eighteen hours, and the autopsy showed\r\nthat the ball had fractured the transverse process of the 3d lumbar\r\nvertebra, and divided the cauda equina just below its origin; it had\r\nthen changed direction and passed up toward the left kidney, dividing\r\nthe ureter near the pelvis, and finally lodged in the psoas muscle.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that the ureter is wounded in the removal of\r\nuterine, ovarian, or other abdominal tumors. In such event, if it is\r\nimpossible to transplant to the bladder, the divided or torn end should\r\nbe brought to the surface of the loin or vagina, and sutured there. In\r\ncases of malignant growth, the ureter has been purposely divided and\r\ntransplanted into the bladder.  Penrose, assisted by Baldy, has\r\nperformed this operation after excision of an inch of the left ureter\r\nfor carcinomatous involvement. The distal end of the ureter was\r\nligated, and the proximal end implanted in the bladder according to Van\r\nHook's method, which consists in tying the lowered end of the ureter,\r\nthen making a slit into it, and invaginating the upper end into the\r\nlower through this slit. A perfect cure followed. Similar cases have\r\nbeen reported by Kelly, Krug, and Bache Emmet. Reed reports a most\r\ninteresting series in which he has successfully transplanted ureters\r\ninto the rectum.\r\n\r\nUreterovaginal fistulae following total extirpation of the uterus,\r\nopening of pelvic abscesses, or ulcerations from foreign bodies, are\r\nrepaired by an operation termed by Bazy of Paris ureterocystoneostomy,\r\nand suggested by him as a substitute for nephrectomy in those cases in\r\nwhich the renal organs are unaffected. In the repair of such a case\r\nafter a vaginal hysterectomy Mayo reports a successful reimplantation\r\nof the ureter into the bladder.\r\n\r\nStricture of the ureter is also a very rare occurrence except as a\r\nresult of compression of abdominal or pelvic new growths.  Watson has,\r\nhowever, reported two cases of stricture, in both of which a ureter was\r\nnearly or quite obliterated by a dense mass of connective tissue. In\r\none case there was a history of the passage of a renal calculus years\r\npreviously. In both instances the condition was associated with\r\npyonephrosis. Watson has collected the reports of four other cases from\r\nmedical literature.\r\n\r\nA remarkable procedure recently developed by gynecologists,\r\nparticularly by Kelly of Baltimore, is catheterization and sounding of\r\nthe ureters. McClellan records a case of penetration of the ureter by\r\nthe careless use of a catheter.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the Bladder.--Rupture of the bladder may result from\r\nviolence without any external wound (such as a fall or kick) applied to\r\nthe abdomen. Jones reports a fatal case of rupture of the bladder by a\r\nhorse falling on its rider. In this case there was but little\r\nextravasation of urine, as the vesical aperture was closed by omentum\r\nand bowel. Assmuth reports two cases of rupture of the bladder from\r\nmuscular action. Morris cites the history of a case in which the\r\nbladder was twice ruptured: the first time by an injury, and the second\r\ntime by the giving way of the cicatrix. The patient was a man of\r\nthirty-six who received a blow in the abdomen during a fight in a\r\npublic house on June 6, 1879. At the hospital his condition was\r\ndiagnosed and treated expectantly, but he recovered perfectly and left\r\nthe hospital July 10, 1879. He was readmitted on August 4, 1886, over\r\nseven years later, with symptoms of rupture of the bladder, and died on\r\nthe 6th. The postmortem showed a cicatrix of the bladder which had\r\ngiven way and caused the patient's death.\r\n\r\nRupture of the bladder is only likely to happen when the organ is\r\ndistended, as when empty it sinks behind the pubic arch and is thus\r\nprotected from external injury. The rupture usually occurs on the\r\nposterior wall, involving the peritoneal coat and allowing\r\nextravasation of urine into the peritoneal cavity, a condition that is\r\nalmost inevitably fatal unless an operation is performed.  Bartels\r\ncollected the data of 98 such cases, only four recovering. When the\r\nrent is confined to the anterior wall of the bladder the urine escapes\r\ninto the pelvic tissues, and the prognosis is much more favorable.\r\nBartels collected 54 such cases, 12 terminating favorably. When\r\nceliotomy is performed for ruptured bladder, in a manner suggested by\r\nthe elder Gross, the mortality is much less. Ashhurst collected the\r\nreports of 28 cases thus treated, ten of which recovered--a mortality\r\nof 64.2 per cent. Ashhurst remarks that he has seen an extraperitoneal\r\nrupture of the anterior wall of the bladder caused by improper use of\r\ninstruments, in the case of retention of urine due to the presence of a\r\ntight urethral stricture.\r\n\r\nThere are a few cases on record in which the bladder has been ruptured\r\nby distention from the accumulation of urine, but the accident is a\r\nrare one, the urethra generally giving way first.  Coats reports two\r\ncases of uncomplicated rupture of the bladder.  In neither case was a\r\nhistory of injury obtainable. The first patient was a maniac; the\r\nsecond had been intoxicated previous to his admission to the hospital,\r\nwith symptoms of acute peritonitis. The diagnosis was not made. The\r\nfirst patient died in five days and the second in two days after the\r\nonset of the illness. At the autopsies the rent was found to be in both\r\ninstances in the posterior wall of the bladder a short distance from\r\nthe fundus; the peritoneum was not inflamed, and there was absolutely\r\nno inflammatory reaction in the vesical wound. From the statistics of\r\nFerraton and Rivington it seems that rupture of the bladder is more\r\ncommon in intoxicated persons than in others--a fact that is probably\r\nexplained by a tendency to over-distention of the bladder which\r\nalcoholic liquors bring about. The liquor imbibed increases the amount\r\nof urine, and the state of blunted consciousness makes the call to\r\nempty the bladder less appreciated. The intoxicated person is also\r\nliable to falls, and is not so likely to protect himself in falling as\r\na sober person.\r\n\r\nGunshot Wounds of the Bladder.--Jackson relates the remarkable recovery\r\nof a private in the 17th Tennessee Regiment who was shot in the pelvis\r\nat the battle of Mill Springs or Fishing Creek, Ky.  He was left\r\nsupposedly mortally wounded on the field, but was eventually picked up,\r\nand before receiving any treatment hauled 164 miles, over mountainous\r\nroads in the midst of winter and in a wagon without springs. His urine\r\nand excretions passed out through the wounds for several weeks and\r\nseveral pieces of bone came away. The two openings eventually healed,\r\nbut for twenty-two months he passed pieces of bone by the natural\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nEve records the case of a private in the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry who\r\nwas shot in the right gluteal region, the bullet penetrating the\r\nbladder and making its exit through the pubis. He rode 30 miles, during\r\nwhich the urine passed through the wound. Urine was afterward voided\r\nthrough the left pubic opening, and spicules of bone were discharged\r\nfor two years afterward; ultimate recovery ensued.\r\n\r\nBarkesdale relates the history of the case of a Confederate soldier who\r\nwas shot at Fredericksburg in the median line of the body, 1 1/2 inches\r\nabove the symphysis, the wound of exit being in the median line at the\r\nback, 1/2 inch lower down. Urine escaped from both wounds and through\r\nthe urethra. There were no bad symptoms, and the wounds healed in four\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThe bladder is not always injured by penetration of the abdominal wall,\r\nbut may be wounded by penetration through the anus or vagina, or even\r\nby an instrument entering the buttocks and passing through the smaller\r\nsacrosciatic notch. Camper records the case of a sailor who fell from a\r\nmast and struck upon some fragments of wood, one of which entered the\r\nanus and penetrated the bladder, the result being a rectovesical\r\nfistula. About a year later the man consulted Camper, who\r\nunsuccessfully attempted to extract the piece of wood; but by incising\r\nthe fistula it was found that two calculi had formed about the wooden\r\npieces, and when these were extracted the patient recovered. Perrin\r\ngives the history of a man of forty who, while adjusting curtains, fell\r\nand struck an overturned chair; one of the chair-legs penetrated the\r\nanus. Its extraction was followed by a gush of urine, and for several\r\ndays the man suffered from incontinence of urine and feces. By the\r\ntenth day he was passing urine from the urethra, and on the\r\ntwenty-fifth day there was a complete cicatrix of the parts; fifteen\r\ndays later he suffered from an attack of retention of urine lasting\r\nfive days; this was completely relieved after the expulsion of a small\r\npiece of trouser-cloth which had been pushed into the bladder at the\r\ntime of the accident. Post reports the case of a young man who, in\r\njumping over a broomstick, was impaled upon it, the stick entering the\r\nanus without causing any external wound, and penetrating the bladder,\r\nthus allowing the escape of urine through the anus. A peculiar sequela\r\nwas that the man suffered from a calculus, the nucleus of which was a\r\npiece of the seat of his pantaloons which the stick had carried in.\r\n\r\nCouper reports a fatal case of stab-wound of the buttocks, in which the\r\nknife passed through the lesser sacrosciatic notch and entered the\r\nbladder close to the trigone. The patient was a man of twenty-three, a\r\nseaman, and in a quarrel had been stabbed in the buttocks with a long\r\nsailor's knife, with resultant symptoms of peritonitis which proved\r\nfatal. At the autopsy it was found that the knife had passed through\r\nthe gluteal muscles and divided part of the great sacrosciatic\r\nligament. It then passed through the small sacrosciatic notch,\r\ncompletely dividing the pudic artery and nerve, and one vein, each end\r\nbeing closed by a clot.  The knife entered the bladder close to the\r\ntrigone, making an opening large enough to admit the index finger.\r\nThere were well-marked evidences of peritonitis and cellulitis.\r\n\r\nOld-time surgeons had considerable difficulty in extracting arrow-heads\r\nfrom persons who had received their injuries while on horseback. Conrad\r\nGesner records an ingenious device of an old surgeon who succeeded in\r\nextracting an arrow which had resisted all previous attempts, by\r\nplacing the subject in the very position in which he was at the time of\r\nreception of the wound.  The following noteworthy case shows that the\r\nbladder may be penetrated by an arrow or bullet entering the buttocks\r\nof a person on horseback. Forwood describes the removal of a vesical\r\ncalculus, the nucleus of which was an iron arrow-head, as follows:\r\n\"Sitimore, a wild Indian, Chief of the Kiowas, aged forty-two, applied\r\nto me at Fort Sill, Indian Territory, August, 1869, with symptoms of\r\nstone in the bladder. The following history was elicited: In the fall\r\nof 1862 he led a band of Kiowas against the Pawnee Indians, and was\r\nwounded in a fight near Fort Larned, Kansas. Being mounted and leaning\r\nover his horse, a Pawnee, on foot and within a few paces, drove an\r\narrow deep into his right buttock. The stick was withdrawn by his\r\ncompanions, but the iron point remained in his body. He passed bloody\r\nurine immediately after the injury, but the wound soon healed, and in a\r\nfew weeks he was able to hunt the buffalo without inconvenience.  For\r\nmore than six years he continued at the head of his band, and traveled\r\non horseback, from camp to camp, over hundreds of miles every summer. A\r\nlong time after the injury he began to feel distress in micturating,\r\nwhich steadily increased until he was forced to reveal this sacred\r\nsecret (as it is regarded by these Indians), and to apply for medical\r\naid. His urine had often stopped for hours, at which times he had\r\nlearned to obtain relief by elevating his hips, or lying in different\r\npositions. The urine was loaded with blood and mucus and with a few pus\r\nglobules, and the introduction of a sound indicated a large, hard\r\ncalculus in the bladder. The Indians advised me approximately of the\r\ndepth to which the shaft had penetrated and the direction it took, and\r\njudging from the situation of the cicatrix and all the circumstances it\r\nwas apparent that the arrow-head had passed through the glutei muscles\r\nand the obturator foremen and entered the cavity of the bladder, where\r\nit remained and formed the nucleus of a stone. Stone in the bladder is\r\nextremely rare among the wild Indians, owing, no doubt, to their almost\r\nexclusive meat diet and the very healthy condition of their digestive\r\norgans, and this fact, in connection with the age of the patient and\r\nthe unobstructed condition of his urethra, went very far to sustain\r\nthis conclusion. On August 23d I removed the stone without difficulty\r\nby the lateral operation through the perineum. The lobe of the prostate\r\nwas enlarged, which seemed to favor the extent of the incision beyond\r\nwhat would otherwise have been safe. The perineum was deep and the\r\ntuberosities of the ischii unnaturally approximated. The calculus of\r\nthe mixed ammoniaco-magnesian variety was egg-shaped, and weighed 19\r\ndrams.  The arrow-point was completely covered and imbedded near the\r\ncenter of the stone. It was of iron, and had been originally about 2\r\n1/2 inches long, by 7/8 inch at its widest part, somewhat reduced at\r\nthe point and edges by oxidation. The removal of the stone was\r\nfacilitated by the use of two pairs of forceps,--one with broad blades,\r\nby which I succeeded in bringing the small end of the stone to the\r\nopening in the prostate, while the other, long and narrow, seized and\r\nheld it until the former was withdrawn. In this way the forceps did not\r\noccupy a part of the opening while the large end of the stone was\r\npassing through it.  The capacity of the bladder was reduced, and its\r\ninner walls were in a state of chronic inflammation. The patient\r\nquickly recovered from the effects of the chloroform and felt great\r\nrelief, both in body and mind, after the operation, and up to the\r\neighth day did not present a single unfavorable symptom. The urine\r\nbegan to pass by the natural channel by the third day, and continued\r\nmore or less until, on the seventh day, it had nearly ceased to flow at\r\nthe wound. But the restless spirit of the patient's friends could no\r\nlonger be restrained. Open hostility with the whites was expected to\r\nbegin at every moment, and they insisted on his removal. He needed\r\npurgative medicine on the eighth day, which they refused to allow him\r\nto take. They assumed entire charge of the case, and the following day\r\nstarted with him to their camps 60 miles away. Nineteen days after he\r\nis reported to have died; but his immediate relatives have since\r\nassured me that his wound was well and that no trouble arose from it.\r\nThey described his symptoms as those of bilious remittent fever, a\r\nsevere epidemic of which was prevailing at the time, and from which\r\nseveral white men and many Indians died in that vicinity.\" The calculus\r\nwas deposited in the Army Medical Museum at Washington, and is\r\nrepresented in the accompanying photograph, showing a cross-section of\r\nthe calculus with the arrow-head in situ.\r\n\r\nAs quoted by Chelius, both Hennen and Cline relate cases in which men\r\nhave been shot through the skirts of the jacket, the ball penetrating\r\nthe abdomen above the tuberosity of the ischium, and entering the\r\nbladder, and the men have afterward urinated pieces of clothing,\r\nthreads, etc., taken in by the ball. In similar cases the bullet itself\r\nmay remain in the bladder and cause the formation of a calculus about\r\nitself as a nucleus, as in three cases mentioned by McGuire of\r\nRichmond, or the remnants of cloth or spicules of bone may give rise to\r\nsimilar formation. McGuire mentions the case of a man of twenty-three\r\nwho was wounded at the Battle of McDowell, May 8, 1862. The ball struck\r\nhim on the horizontal ramus of the left pubic bone, about an inch from\r\nthe symphysis, passed through the bladder and rectum, and came out just\r\nbelow the right sacrosciatic notch, near the sacrum. The day after the\r\nbattle the man was sent to the general hospital at Staunton, Va., where\r\nhe remained under treatment for four months.  During the first month\r\nurine passed freely through the wounds made by the entrance and exit of\r\nthe ball, and was generally mixed with pus and blood. Fecal matter was\r\nfrequently discharged through the posterior wound. Some time during the\r\nthird week he passed several small pieces of bone by the rectum. At the\r\nend of the fifth week the wound of exit healed, and for the first time\r\nafter his injury urine was discharged through the urethra. The wound of\r\nentrance gradually closed after five months, but opened again in a few\r\nweeks and continued, at varying intervals, alternately closed and open\r\nuntil September, 1865. At this time, on sounding the man, it was found\r\nthat he had stone; this was removed by lateral operation, and was found\r\nto weigh 2 1/4 ounces, having for its nucleus a piece of bone about 1/2\r\ninch long. Dougherty reports the operation of lithotomy, in which the\r\ncalculus removed was formed by incrustations about an iron bullet.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which there is a fistula of the bladder the subject may\r\nlive for some time, in some cases passing excrement through the\r\nurethra, in others, urine by the anus. These cases seem to have been of\r\nparticular interest to the older writers, and we find the literature of\r\nthe last century full of examples.  Benivenius, Borellus, the\r\nEphemerides, Tulpius, Zacutus Lusitanus, and others speak of excrement\r\npassing through the penis; and there are many cases of vaginal anus\r\nrecorded. Langlet cites an instance in which the intestine terminated\r\nin the bladder. Arand mentions recovery after atresia of the anus with\r\npassage of excrement from the vulva. Bartholinus, the Ephemerides,\r\nFothergill, de la Croix, Riedlin, Weber, and Zacutus Lusitanus mention\r\ninstances in which gas was passed by the penis and urethra. Camper\r\nrecords such a case from ulcer of the neighboring or connecting\r\nintestine; Frank, from cohesion and suppuration of the rectum;\r\nMarcellus Donatus, from penetrating ulcer of the rectum; and Petit,\r\nfrom communication of the rectum and bladder in which a cure was\r\neffected by the continued use of the catheter for the evacuation of\r\nurine.\r\n\r\nFlatus through the vagina, vulva, and from the uterus is mentioned by\r\nBartholinus, the Ephemerides, Meckel, Mauriceau, Paullini, Riedlin,\r\nTrnka, and many others in the older literature. Dickinson mentions a\r\nBurmese male child, four years old, who had an imperforate anus and\r\nurethra, but who passed feces and urine successfully through an opening\r\nat the base of the glans penis. Dickinson eventually performed a\r\nsuccessful operation on this case. Modern literature has many similar\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nIn the older literature it was not uncommon to find accounts of persons\r\npassing worms from the bladder, no explanations being given to account\r\nfor their presence in this organ. Some of these cases were doubtless\r\ninstances of echinococcus, trichinae, or the result of rectovesical\r\nfistula, but Riverius mentions an instance in which, after drinking\r\nwater containing worms, a person passed worms in the urine. In the old\r\nJournal de physique de Rozier is an account of a man of forty-five who\r\nenjoyed good health, but who periodically urinated small worms from the\r\nbladder. They were described as being about 1 1/2 lines long, and\r\ncaused no inconvenience. There is also mentioned the case of a woman\r\nwho voided worms from the bladder. Tupper describes a curious case of a\r\nwoman of sixty-nine who complained of a severe, stinging pain that\r\ncompletely overcame her after micturition. An ulceration of the neck of\r\nthe bladder was suspected, and the usual remedies were applied, but\r\nwithout effect. An examination of the urine was negative. On\r\nrecommendation of her friends the patient, before going to bed, steeped\r\nand drank a decoction of knot-grass. During the night she urinated\r\nfreely, and claimed that she had passed a worm about ten inches long\r\nand of the size of a knitting-needle.  It exhibited motions like those\r\nof a snake, and was quite lively, living five or six days in water. The\r\ncase seems quite unaccountable, but there is, of course, a possibility\r\nthat the animal had already been in the chamber, or that it was passed\r\nby the bowel. A rectovaginal or vesical fistula could account for the\r\npresence of this worm had it been voided from the bowel; nevertheless\r\nthe woman adhered to her statement that she had urinated the worm, and,\r\nas confirmatory evidence, never complained of pain after passing the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nForeign bodies in the bladder, other than calculi (which will be spoken\r\nof in Chapter XV), generally gain entrance through one of the natural\r\npassages, as a rule being introduced, either in curiosity or for\r\nperverted satisfaction, through the urethra.  Morand mentions an\r\ninstance in which a long wax taper was introduced into the bladder\r\nthrough the urethra by a man. At the University Hospital, Philadelphia,\r\nWhite has extracted, by median cystotomy, a long wax taper which had\r\nbeen used in masturbation.  The cystoscopic examination in this case\r\nwas negative, and the man's statements were disbelieved, but the\r\noperation was performed, and the taper was found curled up and covered\r\nby mucus and folds of the bladder. It is not uncommon for needles,\r\nhair-pins, and the like to form nuclei for incrustations. Gross found\r\nthree caudal vertebrae of a squirrel in the center of a vesical\r\ncalculus taken from the bladder of a man of thirty-five.  It was\r\nafterward elicited that the patient had practiced urethral masturbation\r\nwith the tail of this animal. Morand relates the history of a man of\r\nsixty-two who introduced a sprig of wheat into his urethra for a\r\nsupposed therapeutic purpose. It slipped into the bladder and there\r\nformed the nucleus of a cluster calculus. Dayot reports a similar\r\nformation from the introduction of the stem of a plant. Terrilon\r\ndescribes the case of a man of fifty-four who introduced a pencil into\r\nhis urethra. The body rested fifteen days in this canal, and then\r\npassed into the bladder. On the twenty-eighth day he had a chill, and\r\nduring two days made successive attempts to break the pencil. Following\r\neach attempt he had a violent chill and intense evening fever. On the\r\nthirty-third day Terrilon removed the pencil by operation.  Symptoms of\r\nperivesical abscess were present, and seventeen days after the\r\noperation, and fifty days after the introduction of the pencil, the\r\npatient died. Caudmont mentions a man of twenty-six who introduced a\r\npencil-case into his urethra, from whence it passed into his bladder.\r\nIt rested about four years in this organ before violent symptoms\r\ndeveloped. Perforation of the bladder took place, and the patient died.\r\nPoulet mentions the case of a man of seventy-eight, in whose bladder a\r\nmetallic sound was broken off. The fractured piece of sound, which\r\nmeasured 17 cm.  in length, made its exit from the anus, and the\r\npatient recovered. Wheeler reports the case of a man of twenty-one who\r\npassed a button-hook into his anus, from whence it escaped into his\r\nbladder. The hook, which was subsequently spontaneously passed,\r\nmeasured 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nAmong females, whose urethrae are short and dilatable, foreign bodies\r\nare often found in the bladder, and it is quite common for smaller\r\narticles of the toilet, such as hair-pins, to be introduced into the\r\nbladder, and there form calculi. Whiteside describes a case in which a\r\nforeign body introduced into the bladder was mistaken for pregnancy,\r\nand giving rise to corresponding symptoms. The patient was a young girl\r\nof seventeen who had several times missed her menstruation, and who was\r\nconsidered pregnant. The abdomen was more developed than usual in a\r\nyoung woman. The breasts were voluminous, and the nipples surrounded by\r\na somber areola. At certain periods after the cessation of\r\nmenstruation, she had incontinence of urine, and had also repeatedly\r\nvomited. The urine was of high specific gravity, albuminous, alkaline,\r\nand exhaled a disagreeable odor. In spite of the signs of pregnancy\r\nalready noted, palpitation and percussion did not show any augmentation\r\nin the size of the uterus, but the introduction of a catheter into the\r\nbladder showed the existence of a large calculus. Under chloroform the\r\ncalculus and its nucleus were disengaged, and proved to be the handle\r\nof a tooth-brush, the exact size of which is represented in the\r\naccompanying illustration. The handle was covered with calcareous\r\ndeposits, and was tightly fixed in the bladder. At first the young\r\nwoman would give no explanation for its presence, but afterward\r\nexplained that she had several times used this instrument for relief in\r\nretention of urine, and one day it had fallen into the bladder. A short\r\ntime after the operation menstruation returned for the first time in\r\nseven months, and was afterward normal. Bigelow reports the case of a\r\nwoman who habitually introduced hair-pins and common pins into her\r\nbladder.  She acquired this mania after an attempt at dilatation of the\r\nurethra in the relief of an obstinate case of strangury. Rode reports\r\nthe case of a woman who had introduced a hog's penis into her urethra.\r\nIt was removed by an incision into this canal, but the patient died in\r\nfive days of septicemia. There is a curious case quoted of a young\r\ndomestic of fourteen who was first seen suffering with pain in the\r\nsides of the genital organs, retention of urine, and violent tenesmus.\r\nShe was examined by a midwife who found nothing, but on the following\r\nday the patient felt it necessary to go to bed. Her general symptoms\r\npersisted, and meanwhile the bladder became much distended. The patient\r\nhad made allusion to the loss of a hair-pin, a circumstance which\r\ncorresponded with the beginning of her trouble. Examination showed the\r\norifice of the urethra to be swollen and painful to the touch, and from\r\nits canal a hair-pin 6.5 cm. long was extracted. The patient was unable\r\nto urinate, and it was necessary to resort to catheterization. By\r\nevening the general symptoms had disappeared, and the next day the\r\npatient urinated as usual.\r\n\r\nThere are peculiar cases of hair in the bladder, in which all history\r\nas to the method of entrance is denied, and which leave as the only\r\nexplanation the possibility that the bladder was in communication with\r\nsome dermoid cyst. Hamelin mentions a case of this nature. It is said\r\nthat all his life Sir William Elliot was annoyed by passing hairs in\r\nurination. They would lodge in the urethra and cause constant\r\nirritation. At his death a stone was taken from the bladder, covered\r\nwith scurf and hair. Hall relates the case of a woman of sixty, from\r\nwhose bladder, by dilatation of the urethra, was removed a bundle of\r\nhairs two inches long, which, Hall says, without a doubt had grown from\r\nthe vesical walls.\r\n\r\nRetention of Foreign Bodies in the Pelvis.--It is a peculiar fact that\r\nforeign bodies which once gain entrance to the pelvis may be tolerated\r\nin this location for many years. Baxter describes a man who suffered an\r\ninjury from a piece of white board which entered his pelvis, and\r\nremained in position for sixteen and a half years; at this time a piece\r\nof wood 7 1/2 inches long was discharged at stool, and the patient\r\nrecovered. Jones speaks of a case in which splinters of wood were\r\nretained in the neighborhood of the rectum and vagina for sixteen\r\nyears, and spontaneously discharged. Barwell mentions a case in which a\r\ngum elastic catheter that had been passed into the vagina for the\r\npurpose of producing abortion became impacted in the pelvis for twenty\r\nmonths, and was then removed.\r\n\r\nRupture of the Male Urethra.--The male urethra is occasionally ruptured\r\nin violent coitus. Frank and the Philosophical Transactions are among\r\nthe older authorities mentioning this accident. In Frank's case there\r\nwas hemorrhage from the penis to the extent of five pounds. Colles\r\nmentions a man of thirty-eight, prone to obesity, and who had been\r\nmarried two months, who said that in sexual congress he had hurt\r\nhimself by pushing his penis against the pubic bone, and added that he\r\nhad a pain that felt as though something had broken in his organ. The\r\ninteguments of the penis became livid and swollen and were extremely\r\npainful. His urine had to be drawn by a catheter, and by the fifth day\r\nhis condition was so bad that an incision was made into the tumor, and\r\npus, blood, urine, and air issued. The patient suffered intense rigors,\r\nhis abdomen became tympanitic, and he died.  Postmortem examination\r\nrevealed the presence of a ruptured urethra.\r\n\r\nWatson relates an instance of coitus performed en postillon by a man\r\nwhile drunk, with rupture of the urethra and fracture of the corpus\r\nspongiosum only. Loughlin mentions a rupture of the corpus spongiosum\r\nduring coitus. Frank cites a curious case of hemorrhage from a fall\r\nwhile the penis was erect. It is not unusual to find ruptured urethrae\r\nfollowing traumatism, and various explanations are given for it in the\r\nstandard works on surgery.\r\n\r\nFracture of the Penis.--A peculiar accident to the penis is fracture,\r\nwhich sometimes occurs in coitus. This accident consists in the\r\nlaceration of the corpora cavernosa, followed by extensive\r\nextravasation of blood into the erectile tissue. It has also occurred\r\nfrom injury inflicted accidentally or maliciously, but always happening\r\nwhen the organ was erect. An annoying sequel following this accident is\r\nthe tendency to curvature in erection, which is sometimes so marked as\r\nto interfere with coitus, and even render the patient permanently\r\nimpotent.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a laborer of twenty-seven who, in attempting to\r\nmicturate with his penis erect, pressed it downward with considerable\r\nforce and fractured the corpora cavernosa.  Veazie relates a case of\r\nfracture of the corpora cavernosa occurring in coitus. During the act\r\nthe female suddenly withdrew, and the male, following, violently struck\r\nthe pubes, with the resultant injury. Recovery ensued. M'Clellan speaks\r\nof removing the cavernous septum from a man of fifty-two, in whom this\r\npart had become infiltrated with lime-salts and resembled a long,\r\nnarrow bone. When the penis was erect it was bent in the form of a\r\nsemicircular bow.\r\n\r\nThe Transactions of the South Carolina Medical Association contain an\r\naccount of a negro of sixty who had urethral stricture from gonorrhea\r\nand who had been treated for fifteen years by caustics. The penis was\r\nseven inches in circumference around the glans, and but little less\r\nnear the scrotum. The glans was riddled with holes, and numerous\r\nfistulae existed on the inferior surface of the urethra, the meatus\r\nbeing impermeable. So great was the weight and hypertrophy that\r\namputation was necessary.  John Hunter speaks of six strictures\r\nexisting in one urethra at one time; Lallemand of seven; Bolot of\r\neight; Ducamp of five; Boyer thought three could never exist together;\r\nLeroy D'Etoilles found 11, and Rokitansky met with four.\r\n\r\nSundry Injuries to the Penis.--Fabricius Hildanus mentions a curious\r\ncase of paraphimosis caused by violent coitus with a virgin who had an\r\nextremely narrow vagina. Joyce relates a history of a stout man who\r\nawoke with a vigorous erection, and feeling much irritation, he\r\nscratched himself violently. He soon bled copiously, his shirt and\r\nunderlying sheets and blankets being soaked through. On examination the\r\npenis was found swollen, and on drawing back the foreskin a small jet\r\nof blood spurted from a small rupture in the frenum. The authors have\r\nknowledge of a case in which hemorrhage from the frenum proved fatal.\r\nThe patient, in a drunken wager, attempted to circumcise himself with a\r\npiece of tin, and bled to death before medical aid could be summoned.\r\nIt sometimes happens that the virile member is amputated by an animal\r\nbite. Paullini and Celliez mention amputation of the penis by a\r\ndog-bite. Morgan describes a boy of thirteen who was feeding a donkey\r\nwhich suddenly made a snap at him, unfortunately catching him by the\r\ntrousers and including the penis in one of the folds. By the violence\r\nof the bite the boy was thrown to the ground, and his entire prepuce\r\nwas stripped off to the root as if it had been done by a knife. There\r\nwas little hemorrhage, and the prepuce was found in the trousers,\r\nlooking exactly like the finger of a glove. Morgan stated that this was\r\nthe third case of the kind of which he had knowledge. Bookey records a\r\ncase in which an artilleryman was seized by the penis by an infuriated\r\nhorse, and the two crura were pulled out entire.\r\n\r\nAmputation of the penis is not always followed by loss of the sexual\r\npower and instinct, but sometimes has the mental effect of temporarily\r\nincreasing the desire. Haslam reports the case of a man who slipped on\r\nthe greasy deck of a whaler, and falling forward with great violence\r\nupon a large knife used to cut blubber, completely severed his penis,\r\nbeside inflicting a wound in the abdomen through which the intestines\r\nprotruded. After recovery there was a distinct increase of sexual\r\ndesire and frequent nocturnal emissions. In the same report there is\r\nrecorded the history of a man who had entirely lost his penis, but had\r\nsupplied himself with an ivory succedaneum. This fellow finally became\r\nso libidinous that it was necessary to exclude him from the workhouse,\r\nof which he was an inmate.\r\n\r\nNorris gives an account of a private who received a gunshot wound of\r\nthe penis while it was partly erect. The wound was acquired at the\r\nsecond battle of Fredericksburg. The ball entered near the center of\r\nthe glans penis, and taking a slightly oblique direction, it passed out\r\nof the right side of the penis 1 1/2 inches beyond the glans; it then\r\nentered the scrotum, and after striking the pelvis near the symphysis,\r\nglanced off around the innominate bone, and finally made its exit two\r\ninches above the anus. The after-effects of this injury were\r\nincontinence of urine, and inability to assume the erect position.\r\n\r\nBookey cites the case of six wounds from one bullet with recovery. The\r\nbullet entered the sole and emerged from the dorsum of the foot. It\r\nthen went through the right buttock and came out of the groin, only to\r\npenetrate the dorsum of the penis and emerge at the upper part of the\r\nglans. Rose speaks of a case in which a man had his clothes caught in\r\nmachinery, drawing in the external genital organs. The testicles were\r\nfound to be uninjured, but the penis was doubled out of sight and\r\nembedded in the scrotum, from whence it was restored to its natural\r\nposition and the man recovered.\r\n\r\nNelaton describes a case of luxation of the penis in a lad of six who\r\nfell from a cart. Nelaton found the missing member in the scrotum,\r\nwhere it had been for nine days. He introduced Sir Astley Cooper's\r\ninstrument for tying deeply-seated arteries through a cutaneous tube,\r\nand conducting the hook under the corporus cavernosum, seized this\r\ncrosswise, and by a to-and-fro movement succeeded in replacing the\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nMoldenhauer describes the case of a farmer of fifty-seven who was\r\ninjured in a runaway accident, a wheel passing over his body close to\r\nthe abdomen. The glans penis could not be recognized, since the penis\r\nin toto had been torn from its sheath at the corona, and had slipped or\r\nbeen driven into the inguinal region.  This author quotes Stromeyer's\r\ncase, which was that of a boy of four and a half years who was kicked\r\nby a horse in the external genital region. The sheath was found empty\r\nof the penis, which had been driven into the perineum.\r\n\r\nRaven mentions a case of spontaneous retraction of the penis in a man\r\nof twenty-seven. While in bed he felt a sensation of coldness in the\r\npenis, and on examination he found the organ (a normal-sized one)\r\nrapidly retracting or shrinking. He hastily summoned a physician, who\r\nfound that the penis had, in fact, almost disappeared, the glans being\r\njust perceptible under the pubic arch, and the skin alone visible. The\r\nnext day the normal condition was restored, but the patient was weak\r\nand nervous for several days after his fright. In a similar case,\r\nmentioned by Ivanhoff, the penis of a peasant of twenty-three, a\r\nmarried man, bodily disappeared, and was only captured by repeated\r\neffort. The patient was six days under treatment, and he finally became\r\nso distrustful of his virile member that, to be assured of its\r\nconstancy, he tied a string about it above the glans.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the penis and testicles self-inflicted are grouped together\r\nand discussed in Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, spontaneous gangrene of the penis has its origin in some\r\nintense fever. Partridge describes a man of forty who had been the\r\nvictim of typhus fever, and whose penis mortified and dried up,\r\nbecoming black and like the empty finger of a cast-off glove; in a few\r\ndays it dropped off. Boyer cites a case of edema of the prepuce,\r\nnoticed on the fifteenth day of the fever, and which was followed by\r\ngangrene of the penis. Rostan mentions gangrene of the penis from\r\nsmall-pox. Intermittent fever has been cited as a cause. Koehler\r\nreports a fatal instance of gangrene of the penis, caused by a\r\nprostatic abscess following gonorrhea. In this case there was\r\nthrombosis of the pelvic veins. Hutchinson mentions a man who, thirty\r\nyears before, after six days' exposure on a raft, had lost both legs by\r\ngangrene. At the age of sixty-six he was confined to bed by subacute\r\nbronchitis, and during this period his whole penis became gangrenous\r\nand sloughed off. This is quite unusual, as gangrene is usually\r\nassociated with fever; it is more than likely that the gangrene of the\r\nleg was not connected with that of the penis, but that the latter was a\r\ndistinct after-result. Possibly the prolonged exposure at the time he\r\nlost his legs produced permanent injury to the blood-vessels and nerves\r\nof the penis. There is a case on record in which, in a man of\r\nthirty-seven, gangrene of the penis followed delirium tremens, and was\r\nattributed to alcoholism.  Quoted by Jacobson, Troisfontaines records a\r\ncase of gangrene of the skin and body of the penis in a young man, and\r\nwithout any apparent cause. Schutz speaks of regeneration of the penis\r\nafter gangrenous destruction.\r\n\r\nGangrene of the penis does not necessarily hinder the performance of\r\nmarital functions. Chance mentions a man whose penis sloughed off,\r\nleaving only a nipple-like remnant. However, he married four years\r\nlater, and always lived in harmony with his wife. At the time of his\r\ndeath he was the father of a child, subsequent to whose birth his wife\r\nhad miscarried, and at the time of report she was daily expecting to be\r\nagain confined.\r\n\r\nWillett relates the instance of a horseman of thirty-three who, after\r\nusing a combination of refuse oils to protect his horse from gnats, was\r\nprompted to urinate, and, in so doing, accidentally touched his penis\r\nwith the mixture. Sloughing phagedena rapidly ensued, but under medical\r\ntreatment he eventually recovered.\r\n\r\nPriapism is sometimes seen as a curious symptom of lesion of the spinal\r\ncord. In such cases it is totally unconnected with any voluptuous\r\nsensation and is only found accompanied by motor paralysis. It may\r\noccur spontaneously immediately after accident involving the cord, and\r\nis then probably due to undue excitement of the portion of the cord\r\nbelow the lesion, which is deprived of the regulating influence of the\r\nbrain. Priapism may also develop spontaneously at a later period, and\r\nis then due to central irritation from extravasation into the substance\r\nof the cord, or to some reflex cause. It may also occur from simple\r\nconcussion, as shown by a case reported by Le Gros Clark. Pressure on\r\nthe cerebellum is supposed to account for cases of priapism observed in\r\nexecutions and suicides by hanging. There is an instance recorded of an\r\nItalian \"castrate\" who said he provoked sexual pleasure by partially\r\nhanging himself. He accidentally ended his life in pursuance of this\r\npeculiar habit. The facts were elicited by testimony at the inquest.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, in literature, records of long continued priapism\r\nin which either the cause is due to excessive stimulation of the sexual\r\ncenter or in which the cause is obscure or unknown. There may or may\r\nnot be accompanying voluptuous feelings. The older records contain\r\ninstances of continued infantile priapism caused by the constant\r\nirritation of ascarides and also records of prolonged priapism\r\nassociated with intense agony and spasmodic cramps. Zacutus Lusitanus\r\nspeaks of a Viceroy of India who had a long attack of stubborn priapism\r\nwithout any voluptuous feeling. Gross refers to prolonged priapism, and\r\nremarks that the majority of cases seem to be due to excessive coitus.\r\n\r\nMoore reports a case in a man of forty who had been married fifteen\r\nyears, and who suffered spasmodic contractions of the muscles of the\r\npenis after an incomplete coitus. This pseudopriapism continued for\r\ntwenty-three days, during which time he had unsuccessfully resorted to\r\nthe application of cold, bleeding, and other treatment; but on the\r\ntwenty-sixth day, after the use of bladders filled with cold water,\r\nthere was a discharge from the urethra of a glairy mucus, similar in\r\nnature to that in seminal debility. There was then complete relaxation\r\nof the organ. During all this time the man slept very little, only\r\noccasionally dozing. Donne describes an athletic laborer of twenty-five\r\nwho received a wound from a rifle-ball penetrating the cranial parietes\r\nimmediately in the posterior superior angle of the parietal bone, and a\r\nfew lines from the lambdoid suture.  The ball did not make egress, but\r\npassed posteriorly downward.  Reaction was established on the third\r\nday, but the inflammatory symptoms influenced the genitalia. Priapism\r\nbegan on the fifth day, at which time the patient became affected with\r\na salacious appetite, and was rational upon every subject except that\r\npertaining to venery. He grew worse on the sixth day, and his medical\r\nadviser was obliged to prohibit a female attendant.  Priapism\r\ncontinued, but the man went into a soporose condition, with occasional\r\nintervals of satyriasis. In this condition he survived nine days; there\r\nwas not the slightest abatement of the priapism until a few moments\r\nbefore his death. Tripe relates the history of a seaman of twenty-five,\r\nin perfect health, who, arriving from Calcutta on April 12, 1884,\r\nlodged with a female until the 26th. At this time he experienced an\r\nunusually fierce desire, with intense erection of the penis which, with\r\npain, lasted throughout the night. Though coitus was frequently\r\nresorted to, these symptoms continued. He sought aid at the London\r\nHospital, but the priapism was persistent, and when he left, on May\r\n10th, the penis formed an acute angle with the pubes, and he again had\r\nfree intercourse with the same female. At the time of leaving England\r\nthe penis made an angle of about 45 degrees with the pubes, and this\r\ncondition, he affirmed, lasted three months. On his return to England\r\nhis penis was flaccid, and his symptoms had disappeared.\r\n\r\nSalzer presents an interesting paper on priapism which was quoted in\r\nThe Practitioner of London. Salzer describes one patient of forty-six\r\nwho awoke one morning with a strong erection that could not be reduced\r\nby any means. Urine was voided by jerks and with difficulty, and only\r\nwhen the subject was placed in the knee and elbow position. Despite all\r\ntreatment this condition continued for seven weeks. At this time the\r\npatient's spleen was noticed to be enormously enlarged. The man died\r\nabout a year after the attack, but a necropsy was unfortunately\r\nrefused. Salzer, in discussing the theories of priapism, mentions eight\r\ncases previously reported, and concludes, that such cases are\r\nattributable to leukemia. Kremine believes that continued priapism is\r\nproduced by effusion of blood into the corpora cavernosa, which is\r\nimpeded on its return. He thinks it corresponds to bleeding at the nose\r\nand rectum, which often occurs in perfectly healthy persons. Longuet\r\nregards the condition of the blood in leukemia as the cause of such\r\npriapism, and considers that the circulation of the blood is retarded\r\nin the smaller vessels, while, owing to the great increase in the\r\nnumber of white corpuscles, thrombi are formed. Neidhart and Matthias\r\nconclude that the origin of this condition might be sought for in the\r\ndisturbance of the nerve-centers. After reviewing all these theories,\r\nSalzer states that in his case the patient was previously healthy and\r\nnever had suffered the slightest hemorrhage in any part, and he\r\ntherefore rejects the theory of extravasation. He is inclined to\r\nsuppose that the priapism was due to the stimulation of the nervi\r\nerigentes, brought about either by anatomic change in the nerves\r\nthemselves, or by pressure upon them by enlarged lumbar glands, an\r\nassociate condition of leukemia.\r\n\r\nBurchard reports a most interesting case of prolonged priapism in an\r\nEnglish gentleman of fifty-three. When he was called to see the man on\r\nJuly 15th he found him suffering with intense pain in the penis, and in\r\na state of extreme exhaustion after an erection which had lasted five\r\nhours uninterruptedly, during the whole of which time the organ was in\r\na state of violent and continuous spasm. The paroxysm was controlled by\r\n3/4 grain morphin and 1/50 grain atropin. Five hours later, after a\r\ntroubled sleep, there was another erection, which was again relieved by\r\nhypodermic medication. During the day he had two other paroxysms, one\r\nlasting forty-five minutes; and another, three hours later, lasting\r\neighteen minutes. Both these were controlled by morphin.  There was no\r\nloss of semen, but after the paroxysms a small quantity of glairy mucus\r\nescaped from the meatus. The rigidity was remarkable, simulating the\r\nspasms of tetanus. No language could adequately describe the suffering\r\nof the patient. Burchard elicited the history that the man had suffered\r\nfrom nocturnal emissions and erotic dreams of the most lascivious\r\nnature, sometimes having three in one night. During the day he would\r\nhave eight or ten erections, unaccompanied by any voluptuous emotions.\r\nIn these there would rarely be any emission, but occasionally a small\r\nmucous discharge. This state of affairs had continued three years up to\r\nthe time Burchard saw him, and, chagrined by pain and his malady, the\r\npatient had become despondent. After a course of careful treatment, in\r\nwhich diet, sponging, application of ice-bags, and ergot were features,\r\nthis unfortunate man recovered.\r\n\r\nBruce mentions the case of an Irishman of fifty-five who, without\r\napparent cause, was affected with a painful priapism which lasted six\r\nweeks, and did not subside even under chloroform. Booth mentions a case\r\nof priapism in a married seaman of fifty-five, due to local\r\ninflammation about the muscles, constricting the bulb of the penis. The\r\naffection lasted five weeks, and was extremely painful. There was a\r\nsimilar case of priapism which lasted for three weeks, and was\r\nassociated with hydrocele in a man of forty-eight.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the testicle and scrotum may be productive of most serious\r\nissue. It is a well-known surgical fact that a major degree of shock\r\naccompanies a contusion of this portion of the body. In fact, Chevers\r\nstates that the sensitiveness of the testicles is so well known in\r\nIndia, that there are cases on record in which premeditated murder has\r\nbeen effected by Cossiah women, by violently squeezing the testicles of\r\ntheir husbands. He also mentions another case in which, in frustrating\r\nan attempt at rape, death was caused in a similar manner. Stalkartt\r\ndescribes the case of a young man who, after drinking to excess with\r\nhis paramour, was either unable, or indifferent in gratifying her\r\nsexual desire. The woman became so enraged that she seized the scrotum\r\nand wrenched it from its attachments, exposing the testicles. The left\r\ntesticle was completely denuded, and was hanging by the vas deferens\r\nand the spermatic vessels. There was little hemorrhage, and the wound\r\nwas healed by granulation.\r\n\r\nAvulsion of the male external genitalia is not always accompanied by\r\nserious consequences, and even in some cases the sexual power is\r\npreserved. Knoll described a case in 1781, occurring in a peasant of\r\nthirty-six who fell from a horse under the wheels of a carriage. He was\r\nfirst caught in the revolving wheels by his apron, which drew him up\r\nuntil his breeches were entangled, and finally his genitals were torn\r\noff. Not feeling much pain at the time, he mounted his horse and went\r\nto his house. On examination it was found that the injury was\r\naccompanied with considerable hemorrhage. The wound extended from the\r\nsuperior part of the pubes almost to the anus; the canal of the urethra\r\nwas torn away, and the penis up to the neck of the bladder. There was\r\nno vestige of either the right scrotum or testicle. The left testicle\r\nwas hanging by its cord, enveloped in its tunica vaginalis. The cord\r\nwas swollen and resembled a penis stripped of its integument. The\r\nprostate was considerably contused. After two months of suffering the\r\npatient recovered, being able to evacuate his urine through a fistulous\r\nopening that had formed. In ten weeks cicatrization was perfect. In his\r\n\"Memoirs of the Campaign of 1811,\" Larrey describes a soldier who,\r\nwhile standing with his legs apart, was struck from behind by a bullet.\r\nThe margin of the sphincter and, the skin of the perineum, the bulbous\r\nportion of the urethra, some of the skin of the scrotum, and the right\r\ntesticle were destroyed. The spermatic cord was divided close to the\r\nskin, and the skin of the penis and prepuce was torn. The soldier was\r\nleft as dead on the field, but after four months' treatment he\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nMadden mentions a man of fifty who fell under the feet of a pair of\r\nhorses, and suffered avulsion of the testicles through the scrotum. The\r\norgans were mangled, the spermatic cord was torn and hung over the\r\nanus, and the penis was lacerated from the frenum down. The man lost\r\nhis testicles, but otherwise completely recovered. Brugh reports an\r\ninstance of injury to the genitalia in a boy of eighteen who was caught\r\nin a threshing-machine. The skin of the penis and scrotum, and the\r\ntissue from the pubes and inguinal region were torn from the body.\r\nCicatrization and recovery were complete. Brigham cites an analogous\r\ncase in a youth of seventeen who was similarly caught in threshing\r\nmachinery. The skin of the penis and the scrotum was entirely torn\r\naway; both sphincters of the anus were lacerated, and the perineum was\r\ndivested of its skin for a space 2 1/2 inches wide.  Recovery ensued,\r\nleaving a penis which measured, when flaccid, three inches long and 1\r\n1/2 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThere is a case reported of a man who had his testicles caught in\r\nmachinery while ginning cotton. The skin of the penis was stripped off\r\nto its root, the scrotum torn off from its base, and the testicles were\r\ncontused and lacerated, and yet good recovery ensued. A peculiarity of\r\nthis case was the persistent erection of the penis when cold was not\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nGibbs mentions a case in which the entire scrotum and the perineum,\r\ntogether with an entire testicle and its cord attached, and nearly all\r\nthe integument of the penis were torn off, yet the patient recovered\r\nwith preservation of sexual powers. The patient was a negro of\r\ntwenty-two who, while adjusting a belt, had his coat (closely buttoned)\r\ncaught in the shafting, and his clothes and external genitals torn off.\r\nOn examination it was found that the whole scrotum was wrenched off,\r\nand also the skin and cellular tissue, from 2 1/2 inches above the\r\nspine of the pubes down to the edge of the sphincter ani, including all\r\nthe breadth of the perineum, together with the left testicle with five\r\ninches of its cord attached, and all the integument and cellular\r\ncovering of the penis except a rim nearly half an inch wide at the\r\nextremity and continuous with the mucous membrane of the prepuce. The\r\nright testicle was hanging by its denuded cord, and was apparently\r\ncovered only by the tunica vaginalis as high up as the abdominal ring,\r\nwhere the elastic feeling of the intestines was distinctly perceptible.\r\nThere was not more than half an ounce of blood lost. The raw surface\r\nwas dressed, the gap in the perineum brought together, and the patient\r\nmade complete recovery, with preservation of his sexual powers. Other\r\ncases of injuries to the external genital organs (self-inflicted) will\r\nbe found in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the sexual power after injuries of this kind is not\r\nuncommon. There is a case reported of a man whose testicles were\r\ncompletely torn away, and the perineal urethra so much injured that\r\nmicturition took place through the wound. After a tedious process the\r\nwound healed and the man was discharged, but he returned in ten days\r\nwith gonorrhea, stating that he had neither lost sexual desire nor\r\npower of satisfaction. Robbins mentions a man of thirty-eight who, in\r\n1874, had his left testicle removed. In the following year his right\r\ntesticle became affected and was also removed. The patient stated that\r\nsince the removal of the second gland he had regular sexual desire and\r\ncoitus, apparently not differing from that in which he indulged before\r\ncastration. For a few months previous to the time of report the cord on\r\nthe left side, which had not been completely extirpated, became\r\nextremely painful and was also removed.\r\n\r\nAtrophy of the testicle may follow venereal excess, and according to\r\nLarrey, deep wounds of the neck may produce the same result, with the\r\nloss of the features of virility. Guthrie mentions a case of\r\nspontaneous absorption of the testicle. According to Larrey, on the\r\nreturn of the French Army from the Egyptian expedition the soldiers\r\ncomplained of atrophy and disappearance of the testicle, without any\r\nvenereal affection. The testicle would lose its sensibility, become\r\nsoft, and gradually diminish in size. One testicle at a time was\r\nattacked, and when both were involved the patient was deprived of the\r\npower of procreation, of which he was apprised by the lack of desire\r\nand laxity of the penis. In this peculiar condition the general health\r\nseemed to fail, and the subjects occasionally became mentally deranged.\r\nAtrophy of the testicles has been known to follow an attack of mumps.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the diseases of Barbadoes Hendy mentions several\r\npeculiar cases under his observation in which the scrotum sloughed,\r\nleaving the testicles denuded. Alix and Richter mention a singular\r\nmodification of rheumatic inflammation of the testicle, in which the\r\naffection flitted from one testicle to the other, and alternated with\r\nrheumatic pains elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere is a case of retraction of the testicle reported in a young\r\nsoldier of twenty-one who, when first seen, complained of a swelling in\r\nthe right groin. He stated that while riding bareback his horse\r\nsuddenly plunged and threw him on the withers. He at once felt a\r\nsickening pain in the groin and became so ill that he had to dismount.\r\nOn inspection an oval tumor was seen in the groin, tender to the touch\r\nand showing no impulse on coughing.  The left testicle was in its usual\r\nposition, but the right was absent. The patient stated positively that\r\nboth testicles were in situ before the accident. An attempt at\r\nreduction was made, but the pain was so severe that manipulation could\r\nnot be endured. A warm bath and laudanum were ordered, but\r\nunfortunately, as the patient at stool gave a sudden bend to the left,\r\nhis testicle slipped up into the abdomen and was completely lost to\r\npalpation.  Orchitis threatened, but the symptoms subsided; the patient\r\nwas kept under observation for some weeks, and then as a tentative\r\nmeasure, discharged to duty. Shortly afterward he returned, saying that\r\nhe was ill, and that while lifting a sack of corn his testicle came\r\npartly down, causing him great pain. At the time of report his left\r\ntesticle was in position, but the right could not be felt. The scrotum\r\non that side had retracted until it had almost disappeared; the right\r\nexternal ring was very patent, and the finger could be passed up in the\r\ninguinal canal; there was no impulse on coughing and no tendency to\r\nhernia.\r\n\r\nA unique case of ectopia of the testicle in a man of twenty-four is\r\ngiven by Popoff. The scrotum was normally developed, and the right\r\ntesticle in situ. The left half of the scrotum was empty, and at the\r\nroot of the penis there was a swelling the size of a walnut, covered\r\nwith normal skin, and containing an oval body about four-fifths the\r\nsize of the testicle, but softer in constituency. The patient claimed\r\nthat this swelling had been present since childhood. His sexual power\r\nhad been normal, but for the past six months he had been impotent. In\r\nchildhood the patient had a small inguinal hernia, and Popoff thought\r\nthis caused the displacement of the testicle.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar case occurred in the Hotel-Dieu, Paris.  Through the\r\nagency of compression one of the testes was forced along the corpus\r\ncavernosum under the skin as far as the glans penis. It was easily\r\nreduced, and at a subsequent autopsy it was found that it had not been\r\nseparated from the cord. Gluiteras a cites a parallel case of\r\ndislocation of the testicle into the penis. It was the result of\r\ntraumatism--a fall upon the wheel of a cart. It was reduced under\r\nanesthesia, after two incisions had been made, the adhesions broken up,\r\nand the shrunken sac enlarged by stretching.\r\n\r\nRupture of the spermatic arteries and veins has caused sudden death.\r\nSchleiser is accredited with describing an instance in which a healthy\r\nman was engaged in a fray in the dark, and, suddenly crying out, fell\r\ninto convulsions and died in five minutes. On examination the only\r\ninjury found was the rupture of both spermatic arteries at the internal\r\nring, produced by a violent pull on the scrotum and testicles by one of\r\nhis antagonists. Shock was evidently a strong factor in this case.\r\nFabricius Hildanus gives a case of impotency due to lesions of the\r\nspermatic vessels following a burn. There is an old record of an aged\r\nman who, on marrying, found that he had erections but no ejaculations.\r\nHe died of ague, and at the autopsy it was found that the verumontanum\r\nwas hard and of the size of a walnut and that the ejaculatory ducts\r\ncontained calculi about the size and shape of peas.\r\n\r\nHydrocele is a condition in which there is an abnormal quantity of\r\nfluid in the tunica vaginalis. It is generally caused by traumatism,\r\nviolent muscular efforts, or straining, and is much more frequent in\r\ntropic countries than elsewhere. It sometimes attains an enormous size.\r\nLeigh mentions a hydrocele weighing 120 pounds, and there are records\r\nof hydroceles weighing 40 and 60 pounds. Larrey speaks of a sarcocele\r\nin the coverings of the testicle which weighed 100 pounds. Mursinna\r\ndescribes a hydrocele which measured 27 inches in its longest and 17 in\r\nits transverse axis.\r\n\r\nTedford gives a curious case of separation of the ovary in a woman of\r\ntwenty-eight. After suffering from invagination of the bowel and\r\ninflammation of the ovarian tissue, an ovary was discharged through an\r\nopening in the sigmoid flexure, and thence expelled from the anus.\r\n\r\nIn discussing injuries of the vagina, the first to be mentioned will be\r\na remarkable case reported by Curran. The subject was an Irish girl of\r\ntwenty. While carrying a bundle of clothes that prevented her from\r\nseeing objects in front of her, she started to pass over a stile, just\r\nopposite to which a goat was lying. The woman wore no underclothing,\r\nand in the ascent her body was partially exposed, and, while in this\r\nenforced attitude, the goat, frightened by her approach, suddenly\r\nstarted up, and in so doing thrust his horn forcibly into her anus and\r\nabout two or three inches up her rectum. The horn then passed through\r\nthe bowel and its coverings, just above the hymen, and was then\r\nwithdrawn as she flinched and fell back. The resultant wound included\r\nthe lower part of the vagina and rectum, the sphincter and, the\r\nfourchet, and perineum. Hemorrhage was profuse, and the wound caused\r\nexcruciating pain. The subject fainted on the spot from hemorrhage and\r\nshock. Her modesty forbade her summoning medical aid for three days,\r\nduring which time the wound was undergoing most primitive treatment.\r\nAfter suturing, cicatrization followed without delay.\r\n\r\nTrompert mentions a case of rupture of the vagina by the horn of a\r\nbull. There is a case recorded in the Pennsylvania Hospital Reports of\r\na girl of nineteen who jumped out of a second-story window. On reaching\r\nthe ground, her foot turned under her as she fell. The high heel of a\r\nFrench boot was driven through the perineum one inch from the median\r\nline, midway between the anus and the posterior commissure of the labia\r\nmajora. The wound extended into the vagina above the external opening,\r\nin which the heel, now separated from the boot, projected, and whence\r\nit was removed without difficulty. This wound was the only injury\r\nsustained by the fall.\r\n\r\nBeckett records a case of impalement in a woman of forty-five who,\r\nwhile attempting to obtain water from a hogshead, fell with one limb\r\ninside the cistern, striking a projecting stave three inches wide and\r\n1/2 inch thick. The external labia were divided, the left crus of the\r\nclitoris separated, the nymphae lacerated, and the vaginal wall\r\npenetrated to the extent of five inches; the patient recovered by the\r\nfourth week.\r\n\r\nHomans reports recovery from extensive wounds acquired by a negress who\r\nfell from a roof, striking astride an upright barrel.  There was a\r\nwound of the perineum, and penetration of the posterior wall of the\r\nvagina, with complete separation of the soft parts from the symphysis\r\npubis, and extrusion of the bladder.\r\n\r\nHowe reports a case of impalement with recovery in a girl of fifteen\r\nwho slid down a hay-stack, striking a hay-hook which penetrated her\r\nperineum and passed into her body, emerging two inches below the\r\numbilicus and one inch to the right of the median line.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the vagina may be so extensive as to allow protrusion of\r\nthe intestines, and some horrible cases of this nature are recorded. In\r\nThe Lancet for 1873 there is reported a murder or suicide of this\r\ndescription. The woman was found with a wound in the vagina, through\r\nwhich the intestines, with clean-cut ends, protruded. Over 7 1/2 feet\r\nof the intestines had been cut off in three pieces. The cuts were all\r\nclean and carefully separated from the mesentery. The woman survived\r\nher injuries a whole week, finally succumbing to loss of blood and\r\nperitonitis. Her husband was tried for murder, but was acquitted by a\r\nGlasgow jury. Taylor mentions similar cases of two women murdered in\r\nEdinburgh some years since, the wounds having been produced by razor\r\nslashes in the vagina. Taylor remarks that this crime seems to be quite\r\ncommon in Scotland. Starkey reports an instance in which the body of an\r\nold colored woman was found, with evidences of vomiting, and her\r\nclothing stained with blood that had evidently come from her vagina. A\r\npostmortem showed the abdominal cavity to be full of blood; at Douglas'\r\nculdesac there was a tear large enough to admit a man's hand, through\r\nwhich protruded a portion of the omentum; this was at first taken for\r\nthe membranes of an abortion. There were distinct signs of acute\r\nperitonitis. After investigation it was proved that a drunken\r\nglass-blower had been seen leaving her house with his hand and arm\r\nstained with blood.  In his drunken frenzy this man had thrust his hand\r\ninto the vagina, and through the junction of its posterior wall with\r\nthe uterus, up into the abdominal cavity, and grasped the uterus,\r\ntrying to drag it out. Outside of obstetric practice the injury is\r\nquite a rare one.\r\n\r\nThere is a case of death from a ruptured clitoris reported by\r\nGutteridge. The woman was kicked while in a stooping position and\r\nsuccumbed to a profuse hemorrhage, estimated to be between three and\r\nfour pounds, and proceeding from a rupture of the clitoris.\r\n\r\nDischarge of Vaginal Parietes.--Longhi describes the case of a woman of\r\ntwenty-seven, an epileptic, with metritis and copious catamenia twice a\r\nmonth. She was immoderately addicted to drink and sexual indulgence,\r\nand in February, 1835, her menses ceased.  On May 8th she was admitted\r\nto the hospital with a severe epileptic convulsion, and until the 18th\r\nremained in a febrile condition, with abdominal tenderness, etc. On the\r\n21st, while straining as if to discharge the contents of the rectum,\r\nshe felt a voluminous body pass through the vagina, and fancied it was\r\nthe expected fetus. After washing this mass it was found to be a\r\nportion of the vaginal parietes and the fleshy body of the neck of the\r\nuterus. The woman believed she had miscarried, and still persisted in\r\nrefusing medicine. Cicatrization was somewhat delayed; immediately on\r\nleaving the hospital she returned to her old habits, but the pain and\r\nhemorrhage attending copulation was so great that she had finally to\r\ndesist. The vagina, however, gradually yielding, ceased to interfere\r\nwith the gratification of her desires. Toward the end of June the\r\nmenses reappeared and flowed with the greatest regularity. The portions\r\ndischarged are preserved in the Milan Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe injuries received during coitus have been classified by Spaeth as\r\nfollows: Deep tears of the hymen with profuse hemorrhage; tears of the\r\nclitoris and of the urethra (in cases of atresia hymenis);\r\nvesicovaginal fistula; laceration of the vaginal fornices, posteriorly\r\nor laterally; laceration of the septum of a duplex vagina; injuries\r\nfollowing coitus after perineorrhaphy. In the last century Plazzoni\r\nreports a case of vaginal rupture occurring during coitus. Green of\r\nBoston; Mann of Buffalo; Sinclair and Munro of Boston, all mention\r\nlacerations occurring during coitus. There is an instance recorded of\r\nextensive laceration of the vagina in a woman, the result of coitus\r\nwith a large dog. Haddon and Ross both mention cases of rupture of the\r\nvagina in coitus; and Martin reports a similar case resulting in a\r\nyoung girl's death. Spaeth speaks of a woman of thirty-one who, a few\r\ndays after marriage, felt violent pain in coitus, and four days later\r\nshe noticed that fecal matter escaped from the vagina during stool.\r\nExamination showed that the columns of the posterior wall were torn\r\nfrom their attachment, and that there was a rectovaginal fistula\r\nadmitting the little finger. Hofmokl cites an instance in which a\r\npowerful young man, in coitus with a widow of fifty-eight, caused a\r\ntear of her fornix, followed by violent hemorrhage. In another case by\r\nthe same author, coitus in a sitting posture produced a rupture of the\r\nposterior fornix, involving the peritoneum; although the patient lost\r\nmuch blood, she finally recovered. In a third instance, a young girl,\r\nwhose lover had violent connection with her while she was in an\r\nexaggerated lithotomy position, suffered a large tear of the right\r\nvaginal wall. Hofmokl also describes the case of a young girl with an\r\nundeveloped vagina, absence of the uterus and adnexa, who during a\r\nforcible and unsuccessful attempt at coitus, had her left labium majus\r\ntorn from the vaginal wall. The tear extended into the mons veneris and\r\ndown to the rectum, and the finger could be introduced into the vaginal\r\nwound to the depth of two inches. The patient recovered in four weeks,\r\nbut was still anemic from the loss of blood.\r\n\r\nCrandall cites instances in which hemorrhage, immediately after coitus\r\nof the marriage-night, was so active as to almost cause death. One of\r\nhis patients was married three weeks previously, and was rapidly\r\nbecoming exhausted from a constant flowing which started immediately\r\nafter her first coitus. Examination showed this to be a case of active\r\nintrauterine hemorrhage excited by coitus soon after the menstrual flow\r\nhad ceased and while the uterus and ovaries were highly congested. In\r\nanother case the patient commenced flooding while at the dinner table\r\nin the Metropolitan Hotel in New York, and from the same cause an\r\nalmost fatal hemorrhage ensued. Hirst of Philadelphia has remarked that\r\nbrides have been found on their marital beds completely covered with\r\nblood, and that the hemorrhage may have been so profuse as to soak\r\nthrough the bed and fall on the floor. Lacerations of the urethra from\r\nurethral coitus in instances of vaginal atresia or imperforate hymen\r\nmay also excite serious hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nForeign Bodies in the Vagina.--The elasticity of the vagina allows the\r\npresence in this passage of the most voluminous foreign bodies. When we\r\nconsider the passage of a fetal head through the vagina the ordinary\r\nforeign bodies, none of which ever approximate this size, seem quite\r\nreasonable. Goblets, hair-pins, needles, bottles, beer glasses,\r\ncompasses, bobbins, pessaries, and many other articles have been found\r\nin the vagina.  It is quite possible for a phosphatic incrustation to\r\nbe found about a foreign body tolerated in this location for some time.\r\nHubbauer speaks of a young girl of nineteen in whose vagina there was a\r\nglass fixed by incrustations which held it solidly in place. It had\r\nbeen there for six months and was only removed with great difficulty.\r\nHolmes cites a peculiar case in which the neck of a bottle was found in\r\nthe vagina of a woman. One point of the glass had penetrated the\r\nbladder and a calculus had formed on this as well as on the vaginal end.\r\n\r\nWhen a foreign body remains in the vagina for a long time and if it is\r\ncomposed of material other than glass, it becomes influenced by the\r\ncorrosive action of the vaginal secretion. For instance, Cloquet\r\nremoved a foreign body which was incrusted in the vagina, and found the\r\ncork pessary which had formed its nucleus completely rotted. A similar\r\ninstrument found by Gosselin had remained in the vagina thirty-six\r\nyears, and was incrustated with calcareous salts. Metal is always\r\nattacked by the vaginal secretions in the most marked manner. Cloquet\r\nmentions that at an autopsy of a woman who had a pewter goblet in her\r\nvagina, lead oxid was found in the gangrenous debris.\r\n\r\nLong Retention of Pessaries, etc.--The length of time during which\r\npessaries may remain in the vagina is sometimes astonishing. The\r\naccompanying illustration shows the phosphatic deposits and\r\nincrustations around a pessary after a long sojourn in the vagina. The\r\nspecimen is in the Musee Dupoytren. Pinet mentions a pessary that\r\nremained in situ for twenty-five years.  Gerould of Massilon, Ohio,\r\nreports a case in which a pessary had been worn by a German woman of\r\neighty-four for more than fifty years. She had forgotten its existence\r\nuntil reminded of it by irritation some years before death. It was\r\nremarkable that when the pessary was removed it was found to have\r\nlargely retained its original wax covering. Hurxthal mentions the\r\nremoval of a pessary which had been in the pelvis for forty-one years.\r\nJackson speaks of a glove-pessary remaining in the vagina thirty-five\r\nyears.  Mackey reports the removal of a glass pessary after fifty-five\r\nyears' incarceration.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a young girl addicted to onanism who died from\r\nthe presence of a pewter cup in her vagina; it had been there fourteen\r\nmonths. Shame had led her to conceal her condition for all the period\r\nduring which she suffered pain in the hypogastrium, and diarrhea. She\r\nhad steadily refused examination.  Bazzanella of Innsbruck removed a\r\ndrinking glass from the vagina by means of a pair of small obstetric\r\nforceps. The glass had been placed there ten years previously by the\r\nwoman's husband.  Szigethy reports the case of a woman of seventy-five\r\nwho, some thirty years before, introduced into her vagina a ball of\r\nstring previously dipped in wax. The ball was effectual in relieving a\r\nprolapsed uterus, and was worn with so little discomfort that she\r\nentirely forgot it until it was forced out of place by a violent\r\neffort. The ball was seven inches in circumference, and covered with\r\nmucus, but otherwise unchanged. Breisky is accredited with the report\r\nof a case of a woman suffering with dysmenorrhea, in whose vagina was\r\nfound a cotton reel which had been introduced seven years before. The\r\nwoman made a good recovery. Pearse mentions a woman of thirty-six who\r\nhad suffered menorrhagia for ten days, and was in a state of great\r\nprostration and suffering from strong colicky pains. On examination he\r\nfound a silk-bobbin about an inch from the entrance, which the patient\r\nhad introduced fourteen years before. She had already had attacks of\r\nperitonitis and hemorrhage, and a urethrovaginal fistula was found. The\r\nbobbin itself was black. This patient had been married twice, and had\r\nbeen cared for by physicians, but the existence of a body 3/4 inch long\r\nhad never been noticed. Poulet quotes two curious cases: in one a\r\npregnant woman was examined by a doctor who diagnosticated\r\ncarcinomatous degeneration of the neck of the uterus. Capuron, who was\r\nconsulted relative to the case, did not believe that the state of the\r\nwoman's health warranted the diagnosis, and on further examination the\r\ngrowth was found to have been a sponge which had previously been\r\nintroduced by the woman into the vagina. The other case, reported by\r\nGuyon, exemplified another error in diagnosis. The patient was a woman\r\nwho suffered from continuous vaginal hemorrhage, and had been given\r\nextensive treatment without success. Finally, when the woman was in\r\nextreme exhaustion, an injection of vinegar-water was ordered, the use\r\nof which was followed by the expulsion from the vagina of a live leech\r\nof a species very abundant in the country. The hemorrhage immediately\r\nceased and health returned.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of a woman of twenty-eight who was suddenly surprised\r\nby some one entering her chamber at the moment she was introducing a\r\ncedar pencil into her vagina. With the purpose of covering up her act\r\nand dissembling the woman sat down, and the shank of the wood was\r\npushed through the posterior wall of the vagina into the peritoneal\r\ncavity. The intestine was, without doubt, pierced in two of its curves,\r\nwhich was demonstrated later by an autopsy. A plastic exudation had\r\nevidently agglutinated the intestine at the points of penetration, and\r\nprevented an immediate fatal issue. Erichsen practiced extraction eight\r\nmonths after the accident, and a pencil 5 1/2 inches long, having a\r\nstrong fecal odor, was brought out. The patient died the fourth day\r\nafter the operation, from peritonitis, and an autopsy showed the\r\nperforation and agglutination of the two intestinal curvatures.\r\nGetchell relates the description of a calculus in the vagina, formed\r\nabout a hair-pin as a nucleus. It is reported that a country girl came\r\nto the Hotel-Dieu to consult Dupoytren, and stated that several years\r\nbefore she had been violated by some soldiers, who had introduced an\r\nunknown foreign body into her vagina, which she never could extract.\r\nDupuytren found this to be a small metallic pot, two inches in\r\ndiameter, with its concavity toward the uterus. It contained a solid\r\nblack substance of a most fetid odor.\r\n\r\nForeign bodies are generally introduced in the uterus either\r\naccidentally in vaginal applications, or for the purpose of producing\r\nabortion. Zuhmeister describes a case of a woman who shortly after the\r\nfirst manifestations of pregnancy used a twig of a tree to penetrate\r\nthe matrix. She thrust it so strongly into the uterus that the wall was\r\nperforated, and the twig became planted in the region of the kidneys.\r\nAlthough six inches long and of the volume of a goose feather, this\r\nbranch remained five months in the pelvis without causing any\r\nparticular inconvenience, and was finally discharged by the rectum.\r\nBrignatelli mentions the case of a woman who, in culpable practices,\r\nintroduced the stalk of a reed into her uterus. She suffered no\r\ninconvenience until the next menstrual epoch which was accompanied by\r\nviolent pains. She presented the appearance of one in the pains of\r\nlabor. The matrix had augmented in volume, and the orifice of the\r\nuterine cervix was closed, but there was hypertrophy as if in the\r\nsecond or third month of pregnancy.  After examination a piece of reed\r\nthree cm. long was extracted from the uterus, its external face being\r\nincrusted with hard calcareous material. Meschede of Schwetz, Germany,\r\nmentions death from a hair-pin in the uterine cavity.\r\n\r\nCrouzit was called to see a young girl who had attempted criminal\r\nabortion by a darning-needle. When he arrived a fetus of about three\r\nmonths had already been expelled, and had been wounded by the\r\ninstrument. It was impossible to remove the needle, and the placenta\r\nwas not expelled for two days. Eleven days afterward the girl commenced\r\nto have pains in the inguinal region, and by the thirty-fifth day an\r\nelevation was formed, and the pains increased in violence. On the\r\nseventy-ninth day a needle six inches long was expelled from the\r\nswelling in the groin, and the patient recovered. Lisfranc extracted\r\nfrom the uterus of a woman who supposed herself to be pregnant at the\r\nthird month, a fragment of a large gum-elastic sound which during\r\nillicit maneuvers had broken off within five cm. of its extremity, and\r\npenetrated the organ. Lisfranc found there was not the slightest sign\r\nof pregnancy, despite the woman's belief that she was with child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS SURGICAL ANOMALIES.\r\n\r\nMarvelous Recoveries from Multiple Injuries.--There are injuries so\r\nnumerous or so great in extent, and so marvelous in their recovery,\r\nthat they are worthy of record in a section by themselves. They are\r\nfound particularly in military surgery. In the Medical and\r\nPhilosophical Commentaries for 1779 is the report of the case of a\r\nlieutenant who was wounded through the lungs, liver, and stomach, and\r\nin whose armpit lodged a ball. It was said that when the wound in his\r\nback was injected, the fluid would immediately be coughed up from his\r\nlungs. Food would pass through the wound of the stomach. The man was\r\ngreatly prostrated, but after eleven months of convalescence he\r\nrecovered. In the brutal capture of Fort Griswold, Connecticut, in\r\n1781, in which the brave occupants were massacred by the British,\r\nLieutenant Avery had an eye shot out, his skull fractured, the\r\nbrain-substance scattering on the ground, was stabbed in the side, and\r\nleft for dead; yet he recovered and lived to narrate the horrors of the\r\nday forty years after.\r\n\r\nA French invalid-artillery soldier, from his injuries and a peculiar\r\nmask he used to hide them, was known as \"L'homme a la tete de cire.\"\r\nThe Lancet gives his history briefly as follows: During the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, he was horribly wounded by the bursting of a\r\nPrussian shell. His whole face, including his two eyes, were literally\r\nblown away, some scanty remnants of the osseous and muscular systems,\r\nand the skull covered with hair being left. His wounds healed, giving\r\nhim such a hideous and ghastly appearance that he was virtually\r\nostracized from the sight of his fellows. For his relief a dentist by\r\nthe name of Delalain constructed a mask which included a false palate\r\nand a set of false teeth. This apparatus was so perfect that the\r\nfunctions of respiration and mastication were almost completely\r\nrestored to their former condition, and the man was able to speak\r\ndistinctly, and even to play the flute. His sense of smell also\r\nreturned. He wore two false eyes simply to fill up the cavities of the\r\norbits, for the parts representing the eyes were closed.  The mask was\r\nso well-adapted to what remained of the real face, that it was\r\nconsidered by all one of the finest specimens of the prothetic art that\r\ncould be devised. This soldier, whose name was Moreau, was living and\r\nin perfect health at the time of the report, his bizarre face, without\r\nexpression, and his sobriquet, as mentioned, making him an object of\r\ngreat curiosity. He wore the Cross of Honor, and nothing delighted him\r\nmore than to talk about the war. To augment his meager pension he sold\r\na pamphlet containing in detail an account of his injuries and a\r\ndescription of the skilfully devised apparatus by which his declining\r\nlife was made endurable. A somewhat similar case is mentioned on page\r\n585.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable case of a soldier suffering numerous and almost\r\nincredible injuries and recovering and pursuing his vocation with\r\nundampened ardor is that of Jacques Roellinger, Company B, 47th New\r\nYork Volunteers. He appeared before a pension board in New York, June\r\n29, 1865, with the following history: In 1862 he suffered a sabre-cut\r\nacross the quadriceps extensor of the left thigh, and a sabre-thrust\r\nbetween the bones of the forearm at the middle third. Soon afterward at\r\nWilliamsburg, Va., he was shot in the thigh, the ball passing through\r\nthe middle third external to the femur. At Fort Wagner, 1863, he had a\r\nsword-cut, severing the spinal muscles and overlying tissue for a\r\ndistance of six inches.  Subsequently he was captured by guerillas in\r\nMissouri and tortured by burning splinters of wood, the cicatrices of\r\nwhich he exhibited; he escaped to Florida, where he was struck by a\r\nfragment of an exploding shell, which passed from without inward,\r\nbehind the hamstring on the right leg, and remained embedded and could\r\nbe plainly felt. When struck he fell and was fired on by the retiring\r\nenemy. A ball entered between the 6th and 7th ribs just beneath the\r\napex of the heart, traversed the lungs and issued at the right 9th rib.\r\nHe fired his revolver on reception of this shot, and was soon\r\nbayonetted by his own comrades by mistake, this wound also penetrating\r\nthe body. He showed a depressed triangular cicatrix on the margin of\r\nthe epigastrium.  If the scars are at all indicative, the bayonet must\r\nhave passed through the left lobe of the liver and border of the\r\ndiaphragm.  Finally he was struck by a pistol-ball at the lower angle\r\nof the left lower jaw, this bullet issuing on the other side of the\r\nneck. As exemplary of the easy manner in which he bore his many\r\ninjuries during a somewhat protracted convalescence, it may be added\r\nthat he amused his comrades by blowing jets of water through the\r\napertures on both sides of his neck. Beside the foregoing injuries he\r\nreceived many minor ones, which he did not deem worthy of record or\r\nremembrance. The greatest disability he suffered at the time of\r\napplying for a pension resulted from an ankylosed knee. Not satisfied\r\nwith his experience in our war, he stated to the pension examiners that\r\nhe was on his way to join Garibaldi's army. This case is marvelous when\r\nwe consider the proximity of several of the wounds to a vital part; the\r\nslightest deviation of position would surely have resulted in a fatal\r\nissue for this apparently charmed life. The following table shows the\r\nman's injuries in the order of their reception:--\r\n\r\n(1) Sabre-cut across the quadriceps femoris of right leg, dividing the\r\ntendinous and muscular structures.\r\n\r\n(2) Sabre-thrust between the bones in the middle third of the right\r\nforearm.\r\n\r\n(3) Shot in the right thigh, the ball passing through the middle third.\r\n\r\n(4) A sword-cut across the spinal muscles covering the lower dorsal\r\nvertebrae.\r\n\r\n(5) Tortured by guerillas in Indian fashion by having burning splinters\r\nof wood applied to the surface of his right thorax.\r\n\r\n(6) An exploded shell passed through the hamstring muscles of the right\r\nthigh and embedded itself in the ligamentous tissues of the internal\r\ncondyle of the femur.\r\n\r\n(7) Shot by a ball between the 6th and 7th ribs of the left side.\r\n\r\n(8) Bayonetted through the body, the steel passing through the left\r\nlobe of the liver and penetrating the posterior border of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n(9) Pistol-ball shot through the sternocleido muscle of one side of the\r\nneck, emerging through the corresponding muscle of the other side of\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\n(10) Sabre-thrust between the bones of the left forearm.\r\n\r\n(11) Pistol-shot through the left pectoralis major and left deltoid\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n(12) Deep cut dividing the commissure between the left thumb and\r\nforefinger down to the carpal bones.\r\n\r\nSomewhat analogous to the foregoing is a case reported in 1834 by\r\nMcCosh from Calcutta. The patient was a native who had been dreadfully\r\nbutchered in the Chooar campaign. One of his hands was cut off above\r\nthe wrist. The remaining stump was nearly amputated by a second blow. A\r\nthird blow penetrated the shoulder-joint.  Beside these and several\r\nother slashes, he had a cut across the abdomen extending from the\r\numbilicus to the spine. This cut divided the parietes and severed one\r\nof the coats of the colon.  The intestines escaped and lay by his side.\r\nHe was then left on the ground as dead. On arrival at the hospital his\r\nwounds were dressed and he speedily convalesced, but the injured colon\r\nruptured and an artificial anus was formed and part of the feces were\r\ndischarged through the wound. This man was subsequently seen at\r\nMidnapore healthy and lusty although his body was bent to one side in\r\nconsequence of a large cicatrix; a small portion of the feces\r\noccasionally passed through the open wound.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a private soldier, aged twenty-seven, who\r\nsuffered a gunshot wound of the skull, causing compound fracture of the\r\ncranium, and who also received compound fractures of both bones of the\r\nleg. He did not present himself for treatment until ten days later. At\r\nthis time the head-injury caused him no inconvenience, but it was\r\nnecessary to amputate the leg and remove the necrosed bones from the\r\ncranial wounds; the patient recovered.\r\n\r\nRecovery After Injuries by Machinery, with Multiple Fractures,\r\netc.--Persons accidentally caught in some portions of powerful\r\nmachinery usually suffer several major injuries, any one of which might\r\nhave been fatal, yet there are marvelous instances of recovery after\r\nwounds of this nature. Phares records the case of a boy of nine who,\r\nwhile playing in the saw-gate of a cotton-press, was struck by the\r\nlever in revolution, the blow fracturing both bones of the leg about\r\nthe middle. At the second revolution his shoulder was crushed; the\r\nthird passed over him, and the fourth, with maximum momentum struck his\r\nhead, carrying away a large part of the integument, including one\r\neyebrow, portions of the skull, membranes, and brain-substance. A piece\r\nof cranial bone was found sticking in the lever, and there were stains\r\nof brain on all the 24 posts around the circumference of the hole.\r\nPossibly from 1 1/2 to two ounces of cerebral substance were lost. A\r\nphysician was called, but thinking the case hopeless he declined to\r\noffer surgical interference. Undaunted, the father of the injured lad\r\nstraightened the leg, adjusted the various fractures, and administered\r\ncalomel and salts. The boy progressively recovered, and in a few weeks\r\nhis shoulder and legs were well. About this time a loosened fragment of\r\nthe skull was removed almost the size and shape of a dessert spoon,\r\nwith the handle attached, leaving a circular opening directly over the\r\neye as large as a Mexican dollar, through which cerebral pulsation was\r\nvisible. A peculiar feature of this case was that the boy never lost\r\nconsciousness, and while one of his playmates ran for assistance he got\r\nout of the hole himself, and moved to a spot ten feet distant before\r\nany help arrived, and even then he declined proffered aid from a man he\r\ndisliked. This boy stated that he remembered each revolution of the\r\nlever and the individual injuries that each inflicted. Three years\r\nafter his injury he was in every respect well. Fraser mentions an\r\ninstance of a boy of fifteen who was caught in the crank of a\r\nbalance-wheel in a shingle-mill, and was taken up insensible. His skull\r\nwas fractured at the parietal eminence and the pericranium stripped\r\noff, leaving a bloody tumor near the base of the fracture about two\r\ninches in diameter. The right humerus was fractured at the external\r\ncondyle; there was a fracture of the coronoid process of the ulna, and\r\na backward dislocation at the elbow. The annular ligament was ruptured,\r\nand the radius was separated from the ulna. On the left side there was\r\na fracture of the anatomic neck of the humerus, and a dislocation\r\ndownward. The boy was trephined, and the comminuted fragments removed;\r\nin about six weeks recovery was nearly complete. Gibson reports the\r\nhistory of a girl of eight who was caught by her clothing in a\r\nperpendicular shaft in motion, and carried around at a rate of 150 or\r\n200 times a minute until the machinery could be stopped.  Although she\r\nwas found in a state of shock, she was anesthetized, in order that\r\nimmediate attention could be given to her injuries, which were found to\r\nbe as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) An oblique fracture of the middle third of the right femur.\r\n\r\n(2) A transverse fracture of the middle third of the left femur.\r\n\r\n(3) A slightly comminuted transverse fracture of the middle third of\r\nthe left tibia and fibula.\r\n\r\n(4) A transverse fracture of the lower third of the right humerus.\r\n\r\n(5) A fracture of the lower third of the right radius.\r\n\r\n(6) A partial radiocarpal dislocation.\r\n\r\n(7) Considerable injuries of the soft parts at the seats of fracture,\r\nand contusions and abrasions all over the body.\r\n\r\nDuring convalescence the little patient suffered an attack of measles,\r\nbut after careful treatment it was found by the seventy-eighth day that\r\nshe had recovered without bony deformity, and that there was bony union\r\nin all the fractures. There was slight tilting upward in the left\r\nfemur, in which the fracture had been transverse, but there was no\r\nperceptible shortening.\r\n\r\nHulke describes a silver-polisher of thirty-six who, while standing\r\nnear a machine, had his sleeve caught by a rapidly-turning wheel, which\r\ndrew him in and whirled him round and round, his legs striking against\r\nthe ceiling and floor of the room. It was thought the wheel had made 50\r\nrevolutions before the machinery was stopped. After his removal it was\r\nfound that his left humerus was fractured at its lower third, and\r\napparently comminuted. There was no pulse in the wrist in either the\r\nradial or ulnar arteries, but there was pulsation in the brachial as\r\nlow as the ecchymosed swelling. Those parts of the hand and fingers\r\nsupplied by the median and radial nerves were insensible. The right\r\nhumerus was broken at the middle, the end of the upper fragment\r\npiercing the triceps, and almost protruding through the skin. One or\r\nmore of the middle ribs on the right side were broken near the angle,\r\nand there was a large transverse rent in the quadriceps extensor.\r\nDespite this terrible accident the man made a perfect recovery, with\r\nthe single exception of limitation of flexion in the left elbow-joint.\r\n\r\nDewey details a description of a girl of six who was carried around the\r\nupright shaft of a flour mill in which her clothes became entangled.\r\nSome part of the body struck the bags or stones with each revolution.\r\nShe sustained a fracture of the left humerus near the insertion of the\r\ndeltoid, a fracture of the middle third of the left femur, a compound\r\nfracture of the left femur in the upper third, with protrusion of the\r\nupper fragment and considerable venous hemorrhage, and fracture of the\r\nright tibia and fibula at the upper third. When taken from the shafting\r\nthe child was in a moribund state, with scarcely perceptible pulse, and\r\nall the accompanying symptoms of shock. Her injuries were dressed, the\r\nfractures reduced, and starch bandages applied; in about six weeks\r\nthere was perfect union, the right leg being slightly shortened. Six\r\nmonths later she was playing about, with only a slight halt in her gait.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Multiple Fractures.--Westmoreland speaks of a man who was\r\npressed between two cars, and sustained a fracture of both collar-bones\r\nand of the sternum; in addition, six or eight ribs were fractured,\r\ndriven into and lacerating the lung. The heart was displaced. In spite\r\nof these terrible injuries, the man was rational when picked up, and\r\nlived nearly half a day. In comment on this case Battey mentions an\r\ninstance in which a mill-sawyer was run over by 20 or 30 logs, which\r\nproduced innumerable fractures of his body, constituting him a surgical\r\ncuriosity. He afterward completely recovered, and, as a consequence of\r\nhis miraculous escape, became a soothsayer in his region. West reports\r\na remarkable recovery after a compound fracture of the femur, fracture\r\nof the jaw, and of the radius, and possibly injury to the base of the\r\nskull, and injury to the spine.\r\n\r\nThere is on record an account of a woman of forty-three who, by\r\nmuscular action in lifting a stone, fractured her pubes, external to\r\nthe spine, on the left side. Not realizing her injury she continued\r\nhard work all that day, but fell exhausted on the next.  She recovered\r\nin about a month, and was able to walk as well as ever.\r\n\r\nVinnedge reports recovery after concussion of the brain and extreme\r\nshock, associated with fracture of the left femur, and comminuted\r\nfractures of the left tibia and fibula.\r\n\r\nTufnell mentions recovery after compound comminuted fracture of the\r\nleg, with simple fracture of both collar-bones, and dislocation of the\r\nthumb. Nankivell speaks of a remarkable recovery in an individual who\r\nsuffered compound comminuted fracture of both legs, and fracture of the\r\nskull. It was found necessary to amputate the right thigh and left leg.\r\nErichsen effected recovery by rest alone, in an individual whose ribs\r\nand both clavicles were fractured by being squeezed.\r\n\r\nGilman records recovery after injuries consisting of fracture of the\r\nfrontal bone near the junction with the right parietal; fracture of the\r\nright radius and ulna at the middle third and at the wrist; and\r\ncompound fracture of the left radius and ulna, 1 1/4 inches above the\r\nwrist. Boulting reports a case of an individual who suffered compound\r\nfractures of the skull and humerus, together with extensive laceration\r\nof the thigh and chest, and yet recovered.\r\n\r\nBarwell mentions recovery after amputation of the shoulder-joint, in an\r\nindividual who had suffered fracture of the base of the skull, fracture\r\nof the jaw, and compound fracture of the right humerus. There was high\r\ndelirium followed by imbecility in this case. Bonnet reports a case of\r\nfracture of both thighs, two right ribs, luxation of the clavicle, and\r\naccidental club-foot with tenotomy, with good recovery from all the\r\ncomplications. Beach speaks of an individual who suffered fracture of\r\nboth thighs, and compound comminuted fracture of the tibia, fibula, and\r\ntarsal bones into the ankle-joint, necessitating amputation of the leg.\r\nThe patient not only survived the operation, but recovered with good\r\nunion in both thighs. As illustrative of the numerous fractures a\r\nperson may sustain at one time, the London Medical Gazette mentions an\r\ninjury to a girl of fourteen, which resulted in 31 fractures.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Falls.--In this connection it is of interest to note from\r\nhow great a height a person may fall without sustaining serious injury.\r\nA remarkable fall of a miner down 100 meters of shaft (about 333 feet)\r\nwithout being killed is recorded by M.  Reumeaux in the Bulletin de\r\nl'Industrie Minerale. Working with his brother in a gallery which\r\nissued on the shaft, he forgot the direction in which he was pushing a\r\ntruck; so it went over, and he after it, falling into some mud with\r\nabout three inches of water. As stated in Nature, he seems neither to\r\nhave struck any of the wood debris, nor the sides of the shaft, and he\r\nshowed no contusions when he was helped out by his brother after about\r\nten minutes. He could not, however, recall any of his impressions\r\nduring the fall. The velocity on reaching the bottom would be about 140\r\nfeet, and time of fall 4.12 seconds; but it is thought he must have\r\ntaken longer. It appears strange that he should have escaped simple\r\nsuffocation and loss of consciousness during a time sufficient for the\r\nwater to have drowned him.\r\n\r\nWhile intoxicated Private Gough of the 42d Royal Highlanders attempted\r\nto escape from the castle at Edinburgh. He fell almost perpendicularly\r\n170 feet, fracturing the right frontal sinus, the left clavicle, tibia,\r\nand fibula. In five months he had so far recovered as to be put on duty\r\nagain, and he served as an efficient soldier. There is an account of\r\nrecovery after a fall of 192 feet, from a cliff in County Antrim,\r\nIreland. Manzini mentions a man who fell from the dome of the Invalides\r\nin Paris, without sustaining any serious accident, and there is a\r\nrecord from Madrid of a much higher fall than this without serious\r\nconsequence. In 1792 a bricklayer fell from the fourth story of a high\r\nhouse in Paris, landing with his feet on the dirt and his body on\r\nstone. He bled from the nose, and lost consciousness for about\r\nforty-five minutes; he was carried to the Hotel-Dieu where it was found\r\nthat he had considerable difficulty in breathing; the regions about the\r\nexternal malleoli were contused and swollen, but by the eighth day the\r\npatient had recovered. In the recent reparation of the Hotel Raleigh in\r\nWashington, D.C., a man fell from the top of the building, which is\r\nabove the average height, fracturing several ribs and rupturing his\r\nlung. He was taken to the Emergency Hospital where he was put to bed,\r\nand persistent treatment for shock was pursued; little hope of the\r\nman's recovery was entertained. His friends were told of his apparently\r\nhopeless condition. There were no external signs of the injury with the\r\nexception of the emphysema following rupture of the lung. Respiration\r\nwas limited and thoracic movement diminished by adhesive straps and a\r\nbinder; under careful treatment the man recovered.\r\n\r\nKartulus mentions an English boy of eight who, on June 1, 1879, while\r\nplaying on the terrace in the third story of a house in Alexandria, in\r\nattempting to fly a kite in company with an Arab servant, slipped and\r\nfell 71 feet to a granite pavement below. He was picked up conscious,\r\nbut both legs were fractured about the middle. He had so far recovered\r\nby the 24th of July that he could hobble about on crutches. On the 15th\r\nof November of the same year he was seen by Kartulus racing across the\r\nplayground with some other boys; as he came in third in the race he had\r\nevidently lost little of his agility. Parrott reports the history of a\r\nman of fifty, weighing 196 pounds, who fell 110 feet from the steeple\r\nof a church. In his descent he broke a scaffold pole in two, and fell\r\nthrough the wooden roof of an engine-house below, breaking several\r\nplanks and two strong joists, and landing upon some sacks of cement\r\ninside the house. When picked up he was unconscious, but regained his\r\nsenses in a short time, and it was found that his injuries were not\r\nserious. The left metacarpal bones were dislocated from the carpal\r\nbones, the left tibia was fractured, and there were contusions about\r\nthe back and hips. Twelve days later he left for home with his leg in\r\nplaster. Farber and McCassy report a case in which a man fell 50 feet\r\nperpendicularly through an elevator shaft, fracturing the skull. Pieces\r\nof bone at the superior angle of the occipital bone were removed,\r\nleaving the aura exposed for a space one by four inches. The man was\r\nunconscious for four days, but entirely recovered in eighteen days,\r\nwith only a slightly subnormal hearing as an after-effect of his fall.\r\n\r\nFor many years there have been persons who have given exhibitions of\r\nhigh jumps, either landing in a net or in the water. Some of these\r\nhazardous individuals do not hesitate to dive from enormous heights,\r\nbeing satisfied to strike head first or to turn a somersault in their\r\ndescent. Nearly all the noted bridges in this country have had their\r\n\"divers.\" The death of Odlum in his attempt to jump from Brooklyn\r\nbridge is well known. Since then it has been claimed that the feat has\r\nbeen accomplished without any serious injury. It is reported that on\r\nJune 20, 1896, a youth of nineteen made a headlong dive from the top of\r\nthe Eads bridge at St. Louis, Mo., a distance of 125 feet. He is said\r\nto have swum 250 feet to a waiting tug, and was taken on board without\r\nhaving been hurt.\r\n\r\nProbably the most interesting exhibition of this kind that was ever\r\nseen was at the Royal Aquarium, London, in the summer of 1895. A part\r\nof the regular nightly performance at this Hall, which is familiar on\r\naccount of its immensity, was the jump of an individual from the\r\nrafters of the large arched roof into a tank of water about 15 by 20\r\nfeet, and from eight to ten feet deep, sunken in the floor of the hall.\r\nAnother performer, dressed in his ordinary street clothes, was tied up\r\nin a bag and jumped about two-thirds of this height into the same tank,\r\nbreaking open the bag and undressing himself before coming to the\r\nsurface. In the same performance a female acrobat made a backward dive\r\nfrom the topmost point of the building into a net stretched about ten\r\nfeet above the floor. Nearly every large acrobatic entertainment has\r\none of these individuals who seem to experience no difficulty in\r\nduplicating their feats night after night.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that people falling from great heights die in the\r\nact of descent. An interview with the sailor who fell from the\r\ntop-gallant of an East Indiaman, a height of 120 feet, into the water,\r\nelicited the fact that during the descent in the air, sensation\r\nentirely disappeared, but returned in a slight degree when he reached\r\nthe water, but he was still unable to strike out when rising to the\r\nsurface. By personal observation this man stated that he believed that\r\nif he had struck a hard substance his death would have been painless,\r\nas he was sure that he was entirely insensible during the fall.\r\n\r\nA writer in the Pall Mall Gazette, in speaking of the accidents which\r\nhad happened in connection with the Forth Bridge, tells of a man who\r\ntrusted himself to work at the height of 120 feet above the waters of\r\nthe Firth, simply grasping a rope. His hands became numb with cold, his\r\ngrasp relaxed, and he fell backward down into the water, but was\r\nbrought out alive. In another instance a spanner fell a distance of 300\r\nfeet, knocked off a man's cap, and broke its way through a four-inch\r\nplank. Again, another spanner fell from a great height, actually\r\ntearing off a man's clothes, from his waistcoat to his ankle, but\r\nleaving him uninjured. On another occasion a staging with a number of\r\nworkmen thereon gave way. Two of the men were killed outright by\r\nstriking some portion of the work in their descent; two others fell\r\nclear of the girders, and were rescued from the Firth little worse for\r\ntheir great fall.\r\n\r\nResistance of Children to Injuries.--It is a remarkable fact that young\r\nchildren, whose bones, cartilages, and tissues are remarkably elastic,\r\nare sometimes able to sustain the passage over their bodies of vehicles\r\nof great weight without apparent injury. There is a record early in\r\nthis century of a child of five who was run over across the epigastrium\r\nby a heavy two-wheeled cart, but recovered without any bad symptoms.\r\nThe treatment in this case is quite interesting, and was as follows:\r\nvenesection to faintness, castor oil in infusion of senna until there\r\nwas a free evacuation of the bowels, 12 leeches to the abdomen and\r\nspine, and a saline mixture every two hours! Such depleting\r\ntherapeutics would in themselves seem almost sufficient to provoke a\r\nfatal issue, and were given in good faith as the means of effecting a\r\nrecovery in such a case. In a similar instances a wagon weighing 1200\r\npounds passed over a child of five, with no apparent injury other than\r\na bruise near the ear made by the wheel.\r\n\r\nInfant-vitality is sometimes quite remarkable, a newly-born child\r\nsometimes surviving extreme exposure and major injuries. There was a\r\nremarkable instance of this kind brought to light in the Mullings vs.\r\nMullings divorce-case, recorded in The Lancet. It appeared that Mrs.\r\nMullings, a few hours after her confinement at Torquay, packed her\r\nnewly-born infant boy in a portmanteau, and started for London. She had\r\ntelegraphed Dr. J. S. Tulloch to meet her at Paddington, where he found\r\nhis patient apparently in good condition, and not weak, as he expected\r\nin a woman shortly to be confined. On the way to her apartments, which\r\nhad been provided by Dr. Tulloch, Mrs. Mullings remarked to the Doctor\r\nthat she had already borne her child. Dr. Tulloch was greatly\r\nsurprised, and immediately inquired what she had done with the baby.\r\nShe replied that it was in a box on top of the cab. When the box was\r\nopened the child was found alive. The Lancet comments on the remarkable\r\nfact that, shortly after confinement, a woman can travel six or seven\r\nhours in a railroad train, and her newly-born babe conveyed the same\r\ndistance in a portmanteau, without apparent injury, and without\r\nattracting attention.\r\n\r\nBooth reports a remarkable case of vitality of a newly-born child which\r\ncame under his observation in October, 1894. An illegitimate child,\r\nabandoned by its mother, was left at the bottom of a cesspool vault;\r\nshe claimed that ten hours before Booth's visit it had been\r\naccidentally dropped during an attempt to micturate. The infant lived\r\ndespite the following facts: Its delivery from an ignorant,\r\ninexperienced, unattended negress; its cord not tied; its fall of 12\r\nfeet down the pit; its ten hours' exposure in the cesspool; its\r\nsmothering by foul air, also by a heavy covering of rags, paper, and\r\nstraw; its pounding by three bricks which fell in directly from eight\r\nfeet above (some loose bricks were accidentally dislodged from the\r\nsides of the vault, in the maneuvers to extricate the infant); its\r\nlowered temperature previous to the application of hot bottles,\r\nblankets, and the administration of cardiac stimulants. Booth adds that\r\nthe morning after its discovery the child appeared perfectly well, and\r\nsome two months afterward was brought into court as evidence in the\r\ncase. A remarkable case of infant vitality is given on page 117.\r\n\r\nOperations in the Young and Old.--It might be of interest to mention\r\nthat such a major operation as ovariotomy has been successfully\r\nperformed in an infant. In a paper on infant ovariotomy, several\r\ninstances of this nature are mentioned.  Roemer successfully performed\r\novariotomy on a child one year and eight months old; Swartz, on a child\r\nof four; Barker, on a child of four; Knowsley Thornton, on a child of\r\nseven, and Spencer Wells Cupples, and Chenoweth, on children of eight.\r\nRein performed ovariotomy on a girl of six, suffering from a\r\nmultilocular cyst of the left ovary. He expresses his belief that\r\nchildhood and infancy are favorable to laparotomy.\r\n\r\nKidd removed a dermoid from a child of two years and eleven months;\r\nHooks performed the same operation on a child of thirty months. Chiene\r\nextirpated an ovary from a child of three; Neville duplicated this\r\noperation in a child one month younger; and Alcock performed ovariotomy\r\non a child of three.\r\n\r\nSuccessful ovariotomies are infrequent in the extremely aged.  Bennett\r\nmentions an instance in a woman of seventy-five, and Davies records a\r\nsimilar instance. Borsini and Terrier cite instances of successful\r\novariotomy in patients of seventy-seven.  Carmichael performed the\r\noperation at seventy-four. Owens mentions it at eighty; and Homans at\r\neighty-two years and four months. Dewees records a successful case of\r\novariotomy in a woman over sixty-seven; McNutt reports a successful\r\ninstance in a patient of sixty-seven years and six months; the tumor\r\nweighed 60 pounds, and there were extensive adhesions. Maury removed a\r\nmonocystic ovarian tumor from a woman of seventy-four, his patient\r\nrecovering. Pippingskold mentions an ovariotomy at eighty. Terrier\r\ndescribes double ovariotomy for fibromata in a woman of seventy-seven.\r\nAron speaks of an operation for pilous dermoid of the ovary in a woman\r\nof seventy-five. Shepherd reports a case of recurrent proliferous cyst\r\nin a woman of sixty-three, on whom successful ovariotomy was performed\r\ntwice within nine months. Wells mentions an ovarian cyst in a woman of\r\nsixty-five, from which 72 pints of fluid were removed.\r\n\r\nHawkins describes the case of a musician, M. Rochard, who at the age of\r\none hundred and seven was successfully operated on for strangulated\r\nhernia of upward of thirty hours' duration. The wound healed by first\r\nintention, and the man was well in two weeks. Fowler operated\r\nsuccessfully for strangulated umbilical hernia on a patient of\r\nsixty-eight.\r\n\r\nRepeated Operations.--Franzolini speaks of a woman of fifty on whom he\r\nperformed six celiotomies between June, 1879, and April, 1887. The\r\nfirst operation was for fibrocystic disease of the uterus. Since the\r\nlast operation the woman had had remarkably good health, and there was\r\nevery indication that well-merited recovery had been effected. The\r\nEphemerides contains an account of a case in which cystotomy was\r\nrepeated four times, and there is another record of this operation\r\nhaving been done five times on a man. Instances of repeated Cesarean\r\nsection are mentioned on page 130.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, we mention a marvelous operation performed\r\nby Billroth on a married woman of twenty-nine, after her sixth\r\npregnancy. This noted operator performed, synchronously, double\r\novariotomy and resections of portions of the bladder and ileum, for a\r\nlarge medullary carcinomatous growth of the ovary, with surrounding\r\ninvolvement. Menstruation returned three months after the operation,\r\nand in fifteen months the patient was in good health in every way, with\r\nno apparent danger of recurrence of the disease.\r\n\r\nSelf-performed Surgical Operations.--There have been instances in which\r\nsurgeons and even laymen have performed considerable operations upon\r\nthemselves. On the battlefield men have amputated one of their own\r\nlimbs that had been shattered. In such cases there would be little\r\npain, and premeditation would not be brought into play in the same\r\ndegree as in the case of M. Clever de Maldigny, a surgeon in the Royal\r\nGuards of France, who successfully performed a lithotomy on himself\r\nbefore a mirror. He says that after the operation was completed the\r\nurine flowed in abundance; he dressed the wound with lint dipped in an\r\nemollient solution, and, being perfectly relieved from pain, fell into\r\na sound sleep. On the following day, M. Maldigny says, he was as\r\ntranquil and cheerful as if he had never been a sufferer. A Dutch\r\nblacksmith and a German cooper each performed lithotomy on themselves\r\nfor the intense pain caused by a stone in the bladder.  Tulpius,\r\nWalther, and the Ephemerides each report an instance of self-performed\r\ncystotomy.\r\n\r\nThe following case is probably the only instance in which the patient,\r\nsuffering from vesical calculus, tried to crush and break the stone\r\nhimself. J. B., a retired draper, born in 1828, while a youth of\r\nseventeen, sustained a fracture of the leg, rupture of the urethra, and\r\nlaceration of the perineum, by a fall down a well, landing astride an\r\niron bar. A permanent perineal fistula was established, but the patient\r\nwas averse to any operative remedial measure. In the year 1852 he\r\nbecame aware of the presence of a calculus, but not until 1872 did he\r\nask for medical assistance. He explained that he had introduced a\r\nchisel through his perineal fistula to the stone, and attempted to\r\ncomminute it himself and thus remove it, and by so doing had removed\r\nabout an ounce of the calculus. The physician started home for his\r\nforceps, but during the interval, while walking about in great pain,\r\nthe man was relieved by the stone bursting through the perineum,\r\nfalling to the floor, and breaking in two.  Including the ounce already\r\nchiselled off, the stone weighed 14 1/2 ounces, and was 10 5/8 inches\r\nin its long circumference. B.  recovered and lived to December, 1883,\r\nstill believing that he had another piece of stone in his bladder.\r\n\r\nIn Holden's \"Landmarks\" we are told that the operation of dividing the\r\nAchilles tendon was first performed by an unfortunate upon himself, by\r\nmeans of a razor. According to Patterson, the late Mr. Symes told of a\r\npatient in North Scotland who, for incipient hip-disease, had the\r\ncautery applied at the Edinburgh Infirmary with resultant great relief.\r\nAfter returning home to the country he experienced considerable pain,\r\nand despite his vigorous efforts he was unable to induce any of the men\r\nto use the cautery upon him; they termed it \"barbarous treatment.\" In\r\ndesperation and fully believing in the efficacy of this treatment as\r\nthe best means of permanently alleviating his pain, the crippled\r\nScotchman heated a poker and applied the cautery himself.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the marvelous instances of Cesarean sections\r\nself-performed, and in the literature of obstetric operations many of\r\nthe minor type have been done by the patient herself. In the foregoing\r\ncases it is to be understood that the operations have been performed\r\nsolely from the inability to secure surgical assistance or from the\r\nincapacity to endure the pain any longer. These operations were not the\r\nself-mutilations of maniacs, but were performed by rational persons,\r\ndriven to desperation by pain.\r\n\r\nPossibly the most remarkable instances of extensive loss of blood, with\r\nrecoveries, are to be found in the older records of venesection. The\r\nchronicles of excessive bleeding in the olden days are well known to\r\neverybody. Perhaps no similar practice was so universally indulged in.\r\nBoth in sickness and in health, depletion was indicated, and it is no\r\nexaggeration to say that about the hospital rooms at times the floors\r\nwere covered with blood. The reckless way in which venesection was\r\nresorted to, led to its disuse, until to-day it has so vanished from\r\nmedical practice that even its benefits are overlooked, and depletion\r\nis brought about in some other manner. Turning to the older writers, we\r\nfind Burton describing a patient from whom he took 122 ounces of blood\r\nin four days. Dover speaks of the removal of 111 and 190 ounces; Galen,\r\nof six pounds; and Haen, of 114 ounces. Taylor relates the history of a\r\ncase of asphyxia in which he produced a successful issue by extracting\r\none gallon of blood from his patient during twelve hours. Lucas speaks\r\nof 50 venesections being practiced during one pregnancy. Van der Wiel\r\nperformed venesection 49 times during a single pregnancy. Balmes\r\nmentions a case in which 500 venesections were performed in twenty-five\r\nyears. Laugier mentions 300 venesections in twenty-six months.\r\nOsiander speaks of 8000 ounces of blood being taken away in thirty-five\r\nyears. Pechlin reports 155 venesections in one person in sixteen years,\r\nand there is a record of 1020 repeated venesections.\r\n\r\nThe loss of blood through spontaneous hemorrhage is sometimes\r\nremarkable. Fabricius Hildanus reports the loss of 27 pounds of blood\r\nin a few days; and there is an older record of 40 pounds being lost in\r\nfour days. Horstius, Fabricius Hildanus, and Schenck, all record\r\ninstances of death from hemorrhage of the gums. Tulpius speaks of\r\nhemoptysis lasting chronically for thirty years, and there is a similar\r\nrecord of forty years' duration in the Ephemerides. Chapman gives\r\nseveral instances of extreme hemorrhage from epistaxis. He remarks that\r\nBartholinus has recorded the loss of 48 pounds of blood from the nose;\r\nand Rhodius, 18 pounds in thirty-six hours. The Ephemerides contains an\r\naccount of epistaxis without cessation for six weeks. Another writer in\r\nan old journal speaks of 75 pounds of blood from epistaxis in ten days.\r\nChapman also mentions a case in which, by intestinal hemorrhage, eight\r\ngallons of blood were lost in a fortnight, the patient recovering. In\r\nanother case a pint of blood was lost daily for fourteen days, with\r\nrecovery. The loss of eight quarts in three days caused death in\r\nanother case; and Chapman, again, refers to the loss of three gallons\r\nof blood from the bowel in twenty-four hours. In the case of\r\nMichelotti, recorded in the Transactions of the Royal Society, a young\r\nman suffering from enlargement of the spleen vomited 12 pounds of blood\r\nin two hours, and recovered.\r\n\r\nIn hemorrhoidal hemorrhages, Lieutaud speaks of six quarts being lost\r\nin two days; Hoffman, of 20 pounds in less than twenty-four hours, and\r\nPanaroli, of the loss of one pint daily for two years.\r\n\r\nArrow-Wounds.--According to Otis the illustrious Baron Percy was wont\r\nto declare that military surgery had its origin in the treatment of\r\nwounds inflicted by darts and arrows; he used to quote Book XI of the\r\nIliad in behalf of his belief, and to cite the cases of the patients of\r\nChiron and Machaon, Menelaus and Philoctetes, and Eurypiles, treated by\r\nPatroclus; he was even tempted to believe with Sextus that the name\r\niatros, medicus, was derived from ios, which in the older times\r\nsignified \"sagitta,\" and that the earliest function of our professional\r\nancestors was the extraction of arrows and darts. An instrument called\r\nbeluleum was invented during the long Peloponnesian War, over four\r\nhundred years before the Christian era. It was a rude\r\nextracting-forceps, and was used by Hippocrates in the many campaigns\r\nin which he served. His immediate successor, Diocles, invented a\r\ncomplicated instrument for extracting foreign bodies, called\r\ngraphiscos, which consisted of a canula with hooks. Otis states that it\r\nwas not until the wars of Augustus that Heras of Cappadocia designed\r\nthe famous duck-bill forceps which, with every conceivable\r\nmodification, has continued in use until our time. Celsus instructs\r\nthat in extracting arrow-heads the entrance-wound should be dilated,\r\nthe barb of the arrow-head crushed by strong pliers, or protected\r\nbetween the edges of a split reed, and thus withdrawn without\r\nlaceration of the soft parts. According to the same authority, Paulus\r\nAegineta also treated fully of wounds by arrow-heads, and described a\r\nmethod used in his time to remove firmly-impacted arrows. Albucasius\r\nand others of the Arabian school did little or nothing toward aiding\r\nour knowledge of the means of extracting foreign bodies. After the\r\nfourteenth century the attention of surgeons was directed to wounds\r\nfrom projectiles impelled by gunpowder. In the sixteenth century arrows\r\nwere still considerably used in warfare, and we find Pare a delineating\r\nthe treatment of this class of injuries with the sovereign good sense\r\nthat characterized his writings. As the use of firearms became\r\nprevalent the literature of wounds from arrows became meager, and the\r\nreport of an instance in the present day is very rare.\r\n\r\nBill has collected statistics and thoroughly discussed this subject,\r\nremarking upon the rapidity with which American Indians discharge their\r\narrows, and states that it is exceptional to meet with only a single\r\nwound. It is commonly believed that the Indian tribes make use of\r\npoisoned arrows, but from the reports of Bill and others, this must be\r\na very rare custom. Ashhurst states that he was informed by Dr. Schell,\r\nwho was stationed for some time at Fort Laramie, that it is the\r\nuniversal custom to dip the arrows in blood, which is allowed to dry on\r\nthem; it is not, therefore, improbable that septic material may thus be\r\ninoculated through a wound.\r\n\r\nMany savage tribes still make use of the poisonous arrow. The Dyak uses\r\na sumpitan, or blow-tube, which is about seven feet long, and having a\r\nbore of about half an inch. Through this he blows his long, thin dart,\r\nanointed on the head with some vegetable poison. Braidwood speaks of\r\nthe physiologic action of Dajaksch, an arrow-poison used in Borneo.\r\nArnott has made observations relative to a substance produced near\r\nAden, which is said to be used by the Somalies to poison their arrows.\r\nMesser of the British Navy has made inquiries into the reputed\r\npoisonous nature of the arrows of the South Sea Islanders.\r\n\r\nOtis has collected reports of arrow-wounds from surgical cases\r\noccurring in the U. S. Army. Of the multiple arrow-wounds, six out of\r\nthe seven cases were fatal. In five in which the cranial cavity was\r\nwounded, four patients perished. There were two remarkable instances of\r\nrecovery after penetration of the pleural cavity by arrows. The great\r\nfatality of arrow-wounds of the abdomen is well known, and, according\r\nto Bill, the Indians always aim at the umbilicus; when fighting\r\nIndians, the Mexicans are accustomed to envelop the abdomen, as the\r\nmost vulnerable part, in many folds of a blanket.\r\n\r\nOf the arrow-wounds reported, nine were fatal, with one exception, in\r\nwhich the lesion implicated the soft parts only.  The regions injured\r\nwere the scalp, face, and neck, in three instances; the parietes of the\r\nchest in six; the long muscles of the back in two; the abdominal\r\nmuscles in two; the hip or buttocks in three; the testis in one; the\r\nshoulder or arm in 13; forearm or hand in six; the thigh or leg in\r\nseven.\r\n\r\nThe force with which arrows are projected by Indians is so great that\r\nit has been estimated that the initial velocity nearly equals that of a\r\nmusket-ball. At a short distance an arrow will perforate the larger\r\nbones without comminuting them, causing a slight fissure only, and\r\nresembling the effect of a pistol-ball fired through a window-glass a\r\nfew yards off.\r\n\r\nAmong extraordinary cases of recovery from arrow-wounds, several of the\r\nmost striking will be recorded. Tremaine mentions a sergeant of\r\nthirty-four who, in a fray with some hostile Indians, received seven\r\narrow-wounds: two on the anterior surface of the right arm; one in the\r\nright axilla; one on the right side of the chest near the axillary\r\nborder; two on the posterior surface of the left arm near the\r\nelbow-joint, and one on the left temple. On June 1st he was admitted to\r\nthe Post Hospital at Fort Dodge, Kan.  The wound on the right arm near\r\nthe deltoid discharged, and there was slight exfoliation of the\r\nhumerus. The patient was treated with simple dressings, and was\r\nreturned to duty in July, 1870.\r\n\r\nGoddard mentions an arrow-wound by which the body was transfixed.  The\r\npatient was a cutler's helper at Fort Rice, Dakota Territory.  He was\r\naccidentally wounded in February, 1868, by an arrow which entered the\r\nback three inches to the right of the 5th lumbar vertebra, and emerged\r\nabout two inches to the right of the ensiform cartilage. During the\r\nfollowing evening the patient lost about eight ounces of blood\r\nexternally, with a small amount internally. He was confined to his bed\r\nsome two weeks, suffering from circumscribed peritonitis with\r\nirritative fever. In four weeks he was walking about, and by July 1st\r\nwas actively employed. The arrow was deposited in the Army Medical\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nMuller gives a report of an arrow-wound of the lung which was\r\nproductive of pleurisy but which was followed by recovery. Kugler\r\nrecites the description of the case of an arrow-wound of the thorax,\r\ncomplicated by frightful dyspnea and blood in the pleural cavity and in\r\nthe bronchi, with recovery.\r\n\r\nSmart extracted a hoop-iron arrow-head, 1 3/4 inches long and 1/2 inch\r\nin breadth, from the brain of a private, about a month after its\r\nentrance. About a dram of pus followed the exit of the arrow-head.\r\nAfter the operation the right side was observed to be paralyzed, and\r\nthe man could not remember his name. He continued in a varying\r\ncondition for a month, but died on May 13, 1866, fifty-two days after\r\nthe injury. At the postmortem it was found that the brain-tissue, to\r\nthe extent of 3/4 inch around the track of the arrow as a center, was\r\nsoftened and disorganized. The track itself was filled with thick pus\r\nwhich extended into the ventricles.\r\n\r\nPeabody reports a most remarkable case of recovery from multiple\r\narrow-wounds. In a skirmish with some Indians on June 3, 1863, the\r\npatient had been wounded by eight distinct arrows which entered\r\ndifferent parts of the body. They were all extracted with the exception\r\nof one, which had entered at the outer and lower margin of the right\r\nscapula, and had passed inward and upward through the upper lobe of the\r\nright lung or trachea. The hemorrhage at this time was so great that\r\nall hope was abandoned.  The patient, however, rallied, but continued\r\nto experience great pain on swallowing, and occasionally spat blood. In\r\nJuly, 1866, more than three years after the injury, he called on Dr.\r\nPeabody to undergo an examination with a view of applying for a\r\npension, stating that his health was affected from the presence of an\r\narrow-head. He was much emaciated, and expressed himself as tired of\r\nlife. Upon probing through a small fistulous opening just above the\r\nsuperior end of the sternum, the point of the arrow was found resting\r\nagainst the bone, about 1 1/2 inches below, the head lying against the\r\ntrachea and esophagus, with the carotid artery, jugular vein, and\r\nnerves overlying. After some little difficulty the point of the arrow\r\nwas raised above the sternum, and it was extracted without the loss of\r\nan ounce of blood. The edge grazed against the sheath of the innominate\r\nartery during the operation. The missile measured an inch at the base,\r\nand was four inches long. The health of the patient underwent\r\nremarkable improvement immediately after the operation.\r\n\r\nSerious Insect-stings.--Although in this country the stings of insects\r\nare seldom productive of serious consequences, in the tropic climates\r\ndeath not unfrequently results from them. Wounds inflicted by large\r\nspiders, centipedes, tarantulae, and scorpions have proved fatal. Even\r\nin our country deaths, preceded by gangrene, have sometimes followed\r\nthe bite of a mosquito or a bee, the location of the bite and the\r\nidiosyncrasy of the individual probably influencing the fatal issue. In\r\nsome cases, possibly, some vegetable poison is introduced with the\r\nsting.  Hulse, U.S.N., reports the case of a man who was bitten on the\r\npenis by a spider, and who subsequently exhibited violent symptoms\r\nsimulating spinal meningitis, but ultimately recovered.  Kunst mentions\r\na man of thirty-six who received several bee-stings while taking some\r\nhoney from a tree, fell from the tree unconscious, and for some time\r\nafterward exhibited signs of cerebral congestion. Chaumeton mentions a\r\nyoung man who did not perceive a wasp in a glass of sweet wine, and\r\nswallowed the insect. He was stung in the throat, followed by such\r\nintense inflammation that the man died asphyxiated in the presence of\r\nhis friends, who could do nothing to relieve him. In connection with\r\nthis case there is mentioned an English agriculturist who saved the\r\nlife of one of his friends who had inadvertently swallowed a wasp with\r\na glass of beer. Alarming symptoms manifested themselves at the moment\r\nof the sting. The farmer made a kind of paste from a solution of common\r\nsalt in as little water as possible, which he gave to the young man,\r\nand, after several swallows of the potion, the symptoms disappeared as\r\nif by enchantment. There is a recent account from Bridgeport, Conn., of\r\na woman who, while eating a pear, swallowed a hornet that had alighted\r\non the fruit. In going down the throat the insect stung her on the\r\ntonsil. Great pain and inflammation followed, and in a short time there\r\nwas complete deprivation of the power of speech.\r\n\r\nMease relates the case of a corpulent farmer who, in July, 1835, was\r\nstung upon the temple by a common bee. He walked to a fence a short\r\ndistance away, thence to his house, 20 yards distant, lay down, and\r\nexpired in ten minutes. A second case, which occurred in June, 1811, is\r\nalso mentioned by Mease. A vigorous man was stung in the septum of the\r\nnose by a bee. Supported by a friend he walked to his house, a few\r\nsteps distant, and lay down. He rose immediately to go to the well,\r\nstepped a few paces, fell, and expired. It was thirty minutes from the\r\ntime of the accident to the man's death. A third case is reported by\r\nthe same author from Kentucky. A man of thirty-five was stung on the\r\nright superior palpebrum, and died in twenty minutes. Mease reports a\r\nfourth ease from Connecticut, in which a man of twenty-six was stung by\r\na bee on the tip of the nose. He recovered after treatment with\r\nten-grain doses of Dover's Powder, and persistent application of\r\nplantain leaves. A fifth case was that of a farmer in Pennsylvania who\r\nwas stung in the left side of the throat by a wasp which he had\r\nswallowed in drinking cider. Notwithstanding medical treatment, death\r\nensued twenty-seven hours afterward. A sixth case, which occurred in\r\nOctober, 1834, is given by the same author. A middle-aged man was stung\r\nby a yellow wasp on the middle finger of the right hand, and died in\r\nless than twenty minutes after having received his wound. A seventh\r\ncase was that of a New York farmer who, while hoeing, was bitten on the\r\nfoot by a spider. Notwithstanding medical treatment, principally\r\nbleeding, the man soon expired.\r\n\r\nDesbrest mentions the sting of a bee above the eyebrow followed by\r\ndeath. Zacutus saw a bee-sting which was followed by gangrene.\r\nDelaistre mentions death from a hornet-sting in the palate.  Nivison\r\nrelates the case of a farmer of fifty who was stung in the neck by a\r\nbee. The usual swelling and discoloration did not follow, but\r\nnotwithstanding vigorous medical treatment the man died in six days.\r\nThompson relates three cases of bee-sting, in all of which death\r\nsupervened within fifteen minutes,--one in a farmer of fifty-eight who\r\nwas stung in the neck below the right ear; a second in an inn-keeper of\r\nfifty who was stung in the neck, and a third of a woman of sixty-four\r\nwho was stung on the left brow. \"Chirurgus\" recalls the details of a\r\ncase of a wasp-sting in the middle finger of the right hand of a man of\r\nforty, depriving him of all sense and of muscular power. Ten minutes\r\nafter receiving it he was unconscious, his heart-beats were feeble, and\r\nhis pulse only perceptible.\r\n\r\nSyphilis from a Flea-bite.--Jonathan Hutchinson, in the October, 1895,\r\nnumber of his unique and valuable Archives of Surgery, reports a\r\nprimary lesion of most unusual origin. An elderly member of the\r\nprofession presented himself entirely covered with an evident\r\nsyphilitic eruption, which rapidly disappeared under the use of\r\nmercury. The only interest about the case was the question as to how\r\nthe disease had been acquired. The doctor was evidently anxious to give\r\nall the information in his power, but was positive that he had never\r\nbeen exposed to any sexual risk, and as he had retired from practice,\r\nno possibility of infection in that manner existed. He willingly\r\nstripped, and a careful examination of his entire body surface revealed\r\nno trace of lesion whatever on the genitals, or at any point, except a\r\ndusky spot on one leg, which looked like the remains of a boil. This,\r\nthe doctor stated, had been due to a small sore, the dates of the\r\nappearance and duration of which were found to fit exactly with those\r\nof a primary lesion. There had also been some enlargement of the\r\nfemoral glands. He had never thought of the sore in this connection,\r\nbut remembered most distinctly that it followed a flea-bite in an\r\nomnibus, and had been caused, as he supposed, by his scratching the\r\nplace, though he could not understand why it lasted so long. Mr.\r\nHutchinson concludes that all the evidence tends to show that the\r\ndisease had probably been communicated from the blood of an infected\r\nperson through the bite of the insect. It thus appears that even the\r\nproverbially trivial fleabite may at times prove a serious injury.\r\n\r\nSnake-bites.--A writer in an Indian paper asserts that the traditional\r\nimmunity of Indian snake-charmers is due to the fact that having been\r\naccidentally bitten by poisonous serpents or insects more than once,\r\nand having survived the first attack, they are subsequently immune. His\r\nassertion is based on personal acquaintance with Madari Yogis and\r\nFakirs, and an actual experiment made with a Mohammedan Fakir who was\r\nimmune to the bites of scorpions provided by the writer. The animals\r\nwere from five to seven inches long and had lobster-like claws. Each\r\nbite drew blood, but the Fakir was none the worse.\r\n\r\nThe venom of poisonous snakes may be considered the most typical of\r\nanimal poisons, being unrivaled in the fatality and rapidity of its\r\naction. Fortunately in our country there are few snake-bites, but in\r\nthe tropic countries, particularly India, the mortality from this cause\r\nis frightful. Not only are there numerous serpents in that country, but\r\nthe natives are lightly dressed and unshod, thus being exposed to the\r\nbites of the reptiles. It is estimated by capable authorities that the\r\ndeaths in India each year from snake-bites exceed 20,000. It is stated\r\nthat there were 2893 human beings killed by tigers, leopards, hyenas,\r\nand panthers in India during the year 1894, and in the same year the\r\nsame species of beasts, aided by snakes, killed 97,371 head of cattle.\r\nThe number of human lives destroyed by snakes in India in 1894 was\r\n21,538. The number of wild beasts killed in the same year was 13,447,\r\nand the number of snakes killed was 102,210.\r\n\r\nYarrow of Washington, who has been a close student of this subject, has\r\nfound in this country no less than 27 species of poisonous snakes,\r\nbelonging to four genera. The first genus is the Crotalus, or\r\nrattlesnake proper; the second is the Caudisona, or ground-rattlesnake;\r\nthe third is the Ancistrodon, or moccasin, one of the species of which\r\nis a water-snake; and the fourth is the Elaps, or harlequin snake.\r\nThere is some dispute over the exact degree of the toxic qualities of\r\nthe venom of the Heloderma suspectum, or Gila monster. In India the\r\ncobra is the most deadly snake. It grows to the length of 5 1/2 feet,\r\nand is most active at night. The Ophiophagus, or hooded cobra, is one\r\nof the largest of venomous snakes, sometimes attaining a length of 15\r\nfeet; it is both powerful, active, and aggressive. The common snakes of\r\nthe deadly variety in the United States are the rattlesnake, the\r\n\"copperhead,\" and the moccasin; and it is from the bites of one of\r\nthese varieties that the great majority of reported deaths are caused.\r\nBut in looking over medical literature one is struck with the scarcity\r\nof reports of fatal snake-bites. This is most likely attributable to\r\nthe fact that, except a few army-surgeons, physicians rarely see the\r\ncases. The natural abode of the serpents is in the wild and uninhabited\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe venom is delivered to the victim through the medium of a long fang\r\nwhich is connected with a gland in which the poison is stored. The\r\nsupply may be readily exhausted; for a time the bite would then be\r\nharmless. Contrary to the general impression, snake-venom when\r\nswallowed is a deadly poison, as proved by the experiments of Fayrer,\r\nMitchell, and Reichert. Death is most likely caused by paralysis of the\r\nvital centers through the circulation. In this country the wounds\r\ninvariably are on the extremities, while in India the cobra sometimes\r\nstrikes on the shoulder or neck.\r\n\r\nIf called on to describe accurately the symptoms of snake-venom\r\npoisoning, few medical men could respond correctly. In most cases the\r\nwound is painful, sometimes exaggerated by the mental condition, which\r\nis wrought up to a pitch rarely seen in other equally fatal injuries.\r\nIt is often difficult to discern the exact point of puncture, so minute\r\nis it. There is swelling due to effusion of blood, active inflammation,\r\nand increasing pain.  If the poison has gained full entrance into the\r\nsystem, in a short time the swelling extends, vesicles soon form, and\r\nthe disorganization of the tissues is so rapid that gangrene is liable\r\nto intervene before the fatal issue. The patient becomes prostrated\r\nimmediately after the infliction of the wound, and his condition\r\nstrongly indicates the use of stimulants, even if the medical attendant\r\nwere unfamiliar with the history of the snake-bite. There may be a\r\nslight delirium; the expression becomes anxious, the pulse rapid and\r\nfeeble, the respiration labored, and the patient complains of a sense\r\nof suffocation.  Coma follows, and the respirations become slower and\r\nslower until death results. If the patient lives long enough, the\r\ndiscoloration of the extremity and the swelling may spread to the neck,\r\nchest and back. Loss of speech after snake-bite is discussed in Chapter\r\nXVII, under the head of Aphasia.\r\n\r\nA peculiar complication is a distressing inflammation of the mouth of\r\nindividuals that have sucked the wounds containing venom. This custom\r\nis still quite common, and is preferred by the laity to the surer and\r\nmuch wiser method of immediate cauterization by fire. There is a\r\ncurious case reported of a young man who was bitten on the ankle by a\r\nviper; he had not sucked the wound, but he presented such an enormous\r\nswelling of the tongue as to be almost provocative of a fatal issue. In\r\nthis case the lingual swelling was a local effect of the general\r\nconstitutional disturbance.\r\n\r\nCases of Snake-bite.--The following case illustrative of the tenacity\r\nof virulence of snake-venom was reported by Mr. Temple, Chief Justice\r\nof Honduras, and quoted by a London authority.  While working at some\r\nwood-cutting a man was struck on a heavy boot by a snake, which he\r\nkilled with an axe. He imagined that he had been efficiently protected\r\nby the boot, and he thought little of the incident. Shortly afterward\r\nhe began to feel ill, sank into a stupor, and succumbed. His boots were\r\nsold after his death, as they were quite well made and a luxury in that\r\ncountry.  In a few hours the purchaser of the boots was a corpse, and\r\nevery one attributed his death to apoplexy or some similar cause. The\r\nboots were again sold, and the next unfortunate owner died in an\r\nequally short time. It was then thought wise to examine the boots, and\r\nin one of them was found, firmly embedded, the fang of the serpent. It\r\nwas supposed that in pulling on the boots each of the subsequent owners\r\nhad scratched himself and became fatally inoculated with the venom,\r\nwhich was unsuspected and not combated. The case is so strange as to\r\nappear hypothetic, but the authority seems reliable.\r\n\r\nThe following are three cases of snake-bite reported by surgeons of the\r\nUnited States Army, two followed by recovery, and the other by death:\r\nMiddleton mentions a private in the Fourth Cavalry, aged twenty-nine,\r\nwho was bitten by a rattlesnake at Fort Concho, Texas, June 27, 1866.\r\nThe bite opened the phalangeal joint of the left thumb, causing violent\r\ninflammation, and resulted in the destruction of the joint. Three years\r\nafterward the joint swelled and became extremely painful, and it was\r\nnecessary to amputate the thumb. Campbell reports the case of a private\r\nof the Thirteenth Infantry who was bitten in the throat by a large\r\nrattlesnake. The wound was immediately sucked by a comrade, and the man\r\nreported at the Post Hospital, at Camp Cooke, Montana, three hours\r\nafter the accident. The only noticeable appearance was a slightly wild\r\nlook about the eyes, although the man did not seem to be the least\r\nalarmed. The region of the wound was hard and somewhat painful,\r\nprobably from having been bruised by the teeth of the man who sucked\r\nthe wound; it remained so for about three hours. The throat was bound\r\nup in rancid olive oil (the only kind at hand) and no internal remedy\r\nwas administered. There were no other bad consequences, and the patient\r\nsoon returned to duty.\r\n\r\nLe Carpentier sends the report of a fatal case of rattlesnake-bite: A\r\nprivate, aged thirty-seven, remarkable for the singularity of his\r\nconduct, was known in his Company as a snake-charmer, as he had many\r\ntimes, without injury, handled poisonous snakes. On the morning of July\r\n13, 1869, he was detailed as guard with the herd at Fort Cummings, New\r\nMexico, when, in the presence of the herders, he succeeded in catching\r\na rattlesnake and proving his power as a sorcerer. The performance\r\nbeing over and the snake killed, he caught sight of another of the same\r\nclass, and tried to duplicate his previous feat; but his dexterity\r\nfailed, and he was bitten in the middle finger of the right hand. He\r\nwas immediately admitted to the Post Hospital, complaining only of a\r\nlittle pain, such as might follow the sting of a bee or wasp. A\r\nligature was applied above the wound; the two injuries made by the\r\nfangs were enlarged by a bistoury; ammonia and the actual cautery were\r\napplied; large doses of whiskey were repeated frequently, the\r\nconstitution of the patient being broken and poor. Vomiting soon came\r\non but was stopped without trouble, and there were doubts from the\r\nbeginning as to his recovery. The swelling of the hand and arm\r\ngradually increased, showing the particular livid and yellowish tint\r\nfollowing the bites of poisonous snakes. A blister was applied to the\r\nbitten finger, tincture of iodin used, and two ounces of whiskey given\r\nevery two hours until inebriety was induced. The pulse, which was very\r\nmuch reduced at first, gained gradually under the influence of\r\nstimulants; two grains of opium were given at night, the patient slept\r\nwell, and on the next day complained only of numbness in the arm. The\r\nswelling had extended as far as the shoulder-joint, and the blood,\r\nwhich was very fluid, was incessantly running from the wound. Carbolic\r\nacid and cerate were applied to the arm, with stimulants internally. On\r\nthe 15th his condition was good, the swelling had somewhat augmented,\r\nthere was not so much lividity, but the yellowish hue had increased. On\r\nthe 16th the man complained of pain in the neck, on the side of the\r\naffected limb, but his general condition was good. Examining his\r\ngenitals, an iron ring 3/4 inch in diameter was discovered, imbedded in\r\nthe soft tissues of the penis, constricting it to such a degree as to\r\nhave produced enormous enlargement of the parts. Upon inquiry it seemed\r\nthat the ring had been kept on the parts very long, as a means of\r\npreservation of chastity; but under the influence of the snake's venom\r\nthe swelling had increased, and the patient having much trouble in\r\npassing water was obliged to complain. The ring was filed off with some\r\ndifficulty. Gangrene destroyed the extremity of the bitten finger. From\r\nthis date until the 30th the man's condition improved somewhat. The\r\nprogress of the gangrene was stopped, and the injured finger was\r\ndisarticulated at the metacarpal articulation. Anesthesia was readily\r\nobtained, but the appearance of the second stage was hardly\r\nperceptible. Le Carpentier was called early on the next morning, the\r\npatient having been observed to be sinking; there was stertorous\r\nrespiration, the pulse was weak and slow, and the man was only partly\r\nconscious. Electricity was applied to the spine, and brandy and\r\npotassium bromid were given, but death occurred about noon. A necropsy\r\nwas made one hour after death. There was general softening of the\r\ntissues, particularly on the affected side. The blood was black and\r\nvery fluid,--not coagulable. The ventricles of the brain were filled\r\nwith a large amount of serum; the brain was somewhat congested. The\r\nlungs were healthy, with the exception of a few crude tubercles of\r\nrecent formation on the left side. The right ventricle of the heart was\r\nempty, and the left filled with dark blood, which had coagulated. The\r\nliver and kidneys were healthy, and the gall-bladder very much\r\ndistended with bile. The intestines presented a few livid patches on\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\nHydrophobia.--The bite of an enraged animal is always of great danger\r\nto man, and death has followed a wound inflicted by domestic animals or\r\neven fowls; a human bite has also caused a fatal issue. Rabies is\r\nfrequently observed in herbivorous animals, such as the ox, cow, or\r\nsheep, but is most commonly found in the carnivore, such as the dog,\r\nwolf, fox, jackal, hyena, and cat and other members of the feline\r\ntribe. Fox reports several cases of death from symptoms resembling\r\nthose of hydrophobia in persons who were bitten by skunks. Swine,\r\nbirds, and even domestic poultry have caused hydrophobia by their\r\nbites.  Le Cat speaks of the bite of an enraged duck causing death, and\r\nThiermeyer mentions death shortly following the bite of a goose, as\r\nwell as death in three days from a chicken-bite. Camerarius describes a\r\ncase of epilepsy which he attributed to a horse-bite.  Among the older\r\nwriters speaking of death following the bite of an enraged man, are van\r\nMeek'ren, Wolff, Zacutus Lusitanus, and Glandorp. The Ephemerides\r\ncontains an account of hydrophobia caused by a human bite. Jones\r\nreports a case of syphilitic inoculation from a human bite on the hand.\r\n\r\nHydrophobia may not necessarily be from a bite; a previously-existing\r\nwound may be inoculated by the saliva alone, conveyed by licking.\r\nPliny, and some subsequent writers, attributed rabies to a worm under\r\nthe animal's tongue which they called \"lytta.\" There is said to be a\r\nsuperstition in India that, shortly after being bitten by a mad dog,\r\nthe victim conceives pups in his belly; at about three months these\r\nmove rapidly up and down the patient's intestines, and being mad like\r\ntheir progenitor, they bite and bark incessantly, until they finally\r\nkill the unfortunate victim. The natives of Nepaul firmly believe this\r\ntheory. All sorts of curious remedies have been suggested for the cure\r\nof hydrophobia. Crabs-claws, Spanish fly, and dragon roots, given three\r\nmornings before the new or full moon, was suggested as a specific by\r\nSir Robert Gordon. Theodore De Vaux remarks that the person bitten\r\nshould immediately pluck the feathers from the breech of an old cock\r\nand apply them bare to the bites. If the dog was mad the cock was\r\nsupposed to swell and die. If the dog was not mad the cock would not\r\nswell; in either case the person so treated was immune. Mad-stones, as\r\nwell as snake-stones, are believed in by some persons at the present\r\nday.  According to Curran, at one time in Ireland the fear of\r\nhydrophobia was so great that any person supposed to be suffering from\r\nit could be legally smothered.\r\n\r\nAccording to French statistics, hydrophobia is an extremely fatal\r\ndisease, although the proportion of people bitten and escaping without\r\ninfection is overwhelmingly greater than those who acquire the disease.\r\nThe mortality of genuine hydrophobia is from 30 to 80 per cent,\r\ninfluenced by efficient and early cauterization and scientific\r\ntreatment. There is little doubt that many of the cases reported as\r\nhydrophobia are merely examples of general systemic infection from a\r\nlocal focus of sepsis, made possible by some primitive and uncleanly\r\ntreatment of the original wound. There is much superstition relative to\r\nhydrophobia; the majority of wounds seen are filled with the hair of\r\nthe dog, soot, ham-fat, and also with particles of decayed food and\r\nsaliva from the mouth of some person who has practiced sucking the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the period of incubation of hydrophobia in man is before\r\nthe end of the second month, although rarely cases are seen as many as\r\nsix months from the reception of the bite. The first symptoms of the\r\ndisease are melancholia, insomnia, loss of appetite, and occasionally\r\nshooting pains, radiating from the wound. There may be severe pain at\r\nthe back of the head and in the neck. Difficulty in swallowing soon\r\nbecomes a marked symptom.  The speech assumes a sobbing tone, and\r\noccasionally the expression of the face is wild and haggard. As regards\r\nthe crucial diagnostic test of a glass of water, the following account\r\nof a patient's attempt to drink is given by Curtis and quoted by\r\nWarren: \"A glass of water was offered the patient, which he refused to\r\ntake, saying that he could not stand so much as that, but would take it\r\nfrom a teaspoon. On taking the water from the spoon he evinced some\r\ndiscomfort and agitation, but continued to raise the spoon. As it came\r\nwithin a foot of his lips, he gagged and began to gasp violently, his\r\nfeatures worked, and his head shook. He finally almost tossed the water\r\ninto his mouth, losing the greater part of it, and staggered about the\r\nroom gasping and groaning. At this moment the respirations seemed\r\nwholly costal, and were performed with great effort, the elbows being\r\njerked upward with every inspiration. The paroxysm lasted about half a\r\nminute. The act of swallowing did not appear to cause distress, for he\r\ncould go through the motions of deglutition without any trouble. The\r\napproach of liquid toward the mouth would, however, cause distress.\" It\r\nis to be remarked that the spasm affects the mechanism of the\r\nrespiratory apparatus, the muscles of mastication and deglutition being\r\nonly secondarily contracted.\r\n\r\nPasteur discovered that the virulence of the virus of rabies could be\r\nattenuated in passing it through different species of animals, and also\r\nthat inoculation of this attenuated virus had a decided prophylactic\r\neffect on the disease; hence, by cutting the spinal cord of inoculated\r\nanimals into fragments a few centimeters long, and drying them, an\r\nemulsion could be made containing the virus. The patients are first\r\ninoculated with a cord fourteen days old, and the inoculation is\r\nrepeated for nine days, each time with a cord one day fresher. The\r\nintensive method consists in omitting the weakest cords and giving the\r\ninoculations at shorter intervals. As a curious coincidence, Pliny and\r\nPasteur, the ancient and modern, both discuss the particular virulence\r\nof saliva during fasting.\r\n\r\nThere is much discussion over the extent of injury a shark-bite can\r\nproduce. In fact some persons deny the reliability of any of the\r\nso-called cases of shark-bites. Ensor reports an interesting case\r\noccurring at Port Elizabeth, South Africa. While bathing, an expert\r\nswimmer felt a sharp pain in the thigh, and before he could cry out,\r\nfelt a horrid crunch and was dragged below the surface of the water. He\r\nstruggled for a minute, was twisted about, shaken, and then set free,\r\nand by a supreme effort, reached the landing stairs of the jetty,\r\nwhere, to his surprise, he found that a monstrous shark had bitten his\r\nleg off. The leg had been seized obliquely, and the teeth had gone\r\nacross the joints, wounding the condyles of the femur. There were three\r\nmarks on the left side showing where the fish had first caught him. The\r\namputation was completed at once, and the man recovered.  Macgrigor\r\nreports the case of a man at a fishery, near Manaar, who was bitten by\r\na shark. The upper jaw of the animal was fixed in the left side of the\r\nbelly, forming a semicircular wound of which a point one inch to the\r\nleft of the umbilicus was the upper boundary, and the lower part of the\r\nupper third of the thigh, the lower boundary. The abdominal and lumbar\r\nmuscles were divided and turned up, exposing the colon in its passage\r\nacross the belly.  Several convolutions of the small intestines were\r\nalso laid bare, as were also the three lowest ribs. The gluteal muscles\r\nwere lacerated and torn, the tendons about the trochanter divided,\r\nlaying the bone bare, and the vastus externus and part of the rectus of\r\nthe thigh were cut across. The wound was 19 inches in length and four\r\nor five inches in breadth. When Dr. Kennedy first saw the patient he\r\nhad been carried in a boat and then in a palanquin for over five miles,\r\nand at this time, three hours after the reception of the wound, Kennedy\r\nfreed the abdominal cavity of salt water and blood, thoroughly cleansed\r\nthe wound of the hair and the clots, and closed it with adhesive\r\nstrips. By the sixteenth day the abdominal wound had perfectly closed,\r\nthe lacerations granulated healthily, and the man did well. Boyle\r\nreports recovery from extensive lacerated wounds from the bite of a\r\nshark. Both arms were amputated as a consequence of the injuries.\r\nFayrer mentions shark-bites in the Hooghley.\r\n\r\nLeprosy from a Fish-bite.--Ashmead records the curious case of a man\r\nthat had lived many years in a leprous country, and while dressing a\r\nfish had received a wound of the thumb from the fin of the fish.\r\nSwelling of the arm followed, and soon after bullae upon the chest,\r\nhead, and face. In a few months the blotches left from this eruption\r\nbecame leprous tubercles, and other well-marked signs of the malady\r\nfollowed. The author asked if in this case we have to do with a latent\r\nleprosy which was evoked by the wound, or if it were a case of\r\ninoculation from the fish?\r\n\r\nCutliffe records recovery after amputation at the elbow-joint, as a\r\nconsequence of an alligator-bite nine days before admission to the\r\nhospital. The patient exhibited a compound comminuted fracture of the\r\nright radius and ulna in their lower thirds, compound comminuted\r\nfractures of the bones of the carpus and metacarpus, with great\r\nlaceration of the soft parts, laying bare the wrist-joint, besides\r\nseveral penetrating wounds of the arm and fore-arm. Mourray gives some\r\nnotes on a case of crocodile-bite with removal of a large portion of\r\nomentum. Sircar speaks of recovery from a crocodile-bite. Dudgeon\r\nreports two cases of animal-bites, both fatal, one by a bear, and the\r\nother by a camel. There is mention of a compound dislocation of the\r\nwrist-joint from a horse-bite. Fayrer speaks of a wolf-bite of the\r\nforearm, followed by necrosis and hemorrhage, necessitating ligature of\r\nthe brachial artery and subsequent excision of the elbow-joint.\r\n\r\nInjuries from Lightning.--The subject of lightning-stroke, with its\r\ndiverse range of injuries, is of considerable interest, and, though not\r\nuncommon, the matter is surrounded by a veil of superstition and\r\nmystery. It is well known that instantaneous or temporary\r\nunconsciousness may result from lightning-stroke.  Sometimes\r\nsuperficial or deep burns may be the sole result, and again paralysis\r\nof the general nerves, such as those of sensation and motion, may be\r\noccasioned. For many years the therapeutic effect of a lightning-stroke\r\nhas been believed to be a possibility, and numerous instances are on\r\nrecord. The object of this article will be to record a sufficient\r\nnumber of cases of lightning-stroke to enable the reader to judge of\r\nits various effects, and form his own opinion of the good or evil of\r\nthe injury. It must be mentioned here that half a century ago Le Conte\r\nwrote a most extensive article on this subject, which, to the present\r\ntime, has hardly been improved upon.\r\n\r\nThe first cases to be recorded are those in which there has been\r\ncomplete and rapid recovery from lightning-stroke. Crawford mentions a\r\nwoman who, while sitting in front of her fireplace on the first floor\r\nof a two-story frame building, heard a crash about her, and realized\r\nthat the house had been struck by lightning. The lightning had torn all\r\nthe weather-boarding off the house, and had also followed a spouting\r\nwhich terminated in a wooden trough in a pig-sty, ten feet back of the\r\nhouse, and killed a pig. Another branch of the fluid passed through the\r\ninside of the building and, running along the upper floor to directly\r\nover where Mrs. F. was sitting, passed through the floor and descended\r\nupon the top of her left shoulder. Her left arm was lying across her\r\nabdomen at the time, the points of the fingers resting on the crests of\r\nthe ilium. There was a rent in the dress at the top of the shoulder,\r\nand a red line half an inch wide running from thence along the inside\r\nof the arm and fore-arm. In some places there was complete vesication,\r\nand on its palmer surface the hand lying on the abdomen was completely\r\ndenuded. The abdomen, for a space of four inches in length and eight\r\ninches in breadth, was also blistered. The fluid then passed from the\r\nfingers to the crest of the ilium, and down the outside of the leg,\r\nbursting open the shoes, and passing then through the floor.  Again a\r\nred line half an inch wide could be traced from the ilium to the toes.\r\nThe clothing was not scorched, but only slightly rent at the point of\r\nthe shoulder and where the fingers rested.  This woman was neither\r\nknocked off her chair nor stunned, and she felt no shock at the time.\r\nAfter ordinary treatment for her burns she made rapid and complete\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nHalton reports the history of a case of a woman of sixty-five who,\r\nabout thirty-five minutes before he saw her, had been struck by\r\nlightning. While she was sitting in an outbuilding a stroke of\r\nlightning struck and shattered a tree about a foot distant. Then,\r\nleaving the tree about seven feet from the ground, it penetrated the\r\nwall of the building, which was of unplastered frame, and struck Mrs.\r\nP. on the back of the head, at a point where her hair was done up in a\r\nknot and fastened by two ordinary hair-pins. The hair was much\r\nscorched, and under the knot the skin of the scalp was severely burned.\r\nThe fluid crossed, burning her right ear, in which was a gold ear-ring,\r\nand then passed over her throat and down the left sternum, leaving a\r\nburn three inches wide, covered by a blister. There was another burn,\r\n12 inches long and three inches wide, passing from just above the crest\r\nof the ilium forward and downward to the symphysis pubis. The next burn\r\nbegan at the patella of the right knee, extending to the bottom of the\r\nheel, upon reaching which it wound around the inner side of the leg.\r\nAbout four inches below the knee a sound strip of cuticle, about 1 1/2\r\ninches, was left intact. The lightning passed off the heel of the foot,\r\nbursting open the heel of a strongly sewed gaiter-boot. The woman was\r\nrendered unconscious but subsequently recovered.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of a lightning-stroke is the fact that it very\r\noften strips the affected part of its raiment, as in the previous case\r\nin which the shoe was burst open. In a discussion before the Clinical\r\nSociety of London, October 24 1879, there were several instances\r\nmentioned in which clothes had been stripped off by lightning. In one\r\ncase mentioned by Sir James Paget, the clothes were wet and the man's\r\nskin was reeking with perspiration. In its course the lightning\r\ntraveled down the clothes, tearing them posteriorly, and completely\r\nstripping the patient. The boots were split up behind and the laces\r\ntorn out.  This patient, however, made a good recovery. Beatson\r\nmentions an instance in which an explosion of a shell completely tore\r\noff the left leg of a sergeant instructor, midway between the knee and\r\nankle. It was found that the foot and lower third of the leg had been\r\ncompletely denuded of a boot and woolen stocking, without any apparent\r\nabrasion or injury to the skin. The stocking was found in the battery\r\nand the boot struck a person some distance off. The stocking was much\r\ntorn, and the boot had the heel missing, and in one part the sole was\r\nseparated from the upper.  The laces in the upper holes were broken but\r\nwere still present in the lower holes. The explanation offered in this\r\ncase is similar to that in analogous cases of lightning-stroke, that\r\nis, that the gas generated by the explosion found its way between the\r\nlimb and the stocking and boot and stripped them off.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious collection of relics, consisting of the clothes of a\r\nman struck by lightning, artistically hung in a glass case in the\r\nMuseum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, and the history of the\r\ninjury, of which these remnants are the result, is given by Professor\r\nStewart, the curator, as follows: At half past four on June 8, 1878,\r\nJames Orman and others were at work near Snave, in Romney Marsh, about\r\neight miles from Ashford. The men were engaged in lopping willows, when\r\nthe violence of the rain compelled them to take refuge under a hedge.\r\nThree of the men entered a shed near by, but Orman remained by the\r\nwillow, close to the window of the shed. Scarcely were the three inside\r\nwhen a lightning-stroke entered the door, crossed the shed, and passed\r\nout the window, which it blew before it into the field. The men noticed\r\nthat the tree under which Orman stood was stripped of its bark. Their\r\ncompanion's boots stood close to the foot of the tree, while the man\r\nhimself lay almost perfectly naked a few yards further on, calling for\r\nhelp.  When they left him a few moments previously, he was completely\r\nclad in a cotton shirt, cotton jacket, flannel vest, and cotton\r\ntrousers, secured at the waist with leather straps and buckles.  Orman\r\nalso wore a pair of stout hobnail boots, and had a watch and chain.\r\nAfter the lightning-stroke, however, all he had on him was the left arm\r\nof his flannel vest. The field was strewn for some distance with\r\nfragments of the unfortunate man's clothing.  Orman was thrown down,\r\nhis eyebrows burned off, and his whiskers and beard much scorched. His\r\nchest was covered with superficial burns, and he had sustained a\r\nfracture of the leg. His strong boots were torn from his feet, and his\r\nwatch had a hole burned right through it, as if a soldering iron had\r\nbeen used. The watch-chain was almost completely destroyed, only a few\r\nlinks remaining. Together with some fused coins, these were found close\r\nby, and are deposited in a closed box in the Museum. According to\r\nOrman's account of the affair, he first felt a violent blow on the\r\nchest and shoulders, and then he was involved in a blinding light and\r\nhurled into the air. He said he never lost consciousness; but when at\r\nthe hospital he seemed very deaf and stupid. He was discharged\r\nperfectly cured twenty weeks after the occurrence. The scientific\r\nexplanation of this amazing escape from this most eccentric vagary of\r\nthe electric fluid is given,--the fact that the wet condition of the\r\nman's clothing increased its power of conduction, and in this way saved\r\nhis life. It is said that the electric current passed down the side of\r\nOrman's body, causing everywhere a sudden production of steam, which by\r\nits expansion tore the clothing off and hurled it away.  It is a\r\ncurious fact that where the flannel covered the man's skin the burns\r\nwere merely superficial, whereas in those parts touched by the cotton\r\ntrousers they were very much deeper. This case is also quoted and\r\ndescribed by Dr. Wilks.\r\n\r\nThere was a curious case of lightning-stroke reported at Cole Harbor,\r\nHalifax. A diver, while at work far under the surface of the water, was\r\nseriously injured by the transmission of a lightning-stroke, which\r\nfirst struck the communicating air pump to which the diver was\r\nattached. The man was brought to the surface insensible, but he\r\nafterward recovered.\r\n\r\nPermanent Effect of Lightning on the Nervous System.--MacDonald\r\nmentions a woman of seventy-eight who, some forty-two years previous,\r\nwhile ironing a cap with an Italian iron, was stunned by an extremely\r\nvivid flash of lightning and fell back unconscious into a chair. On\r\nregaining consciousness she found that the cap which she had left on\r\nthe table, remote from the iron, was reduced to cinders. Her clothes\r\nwere not burned nor were there any marks on the skin. After the stroke\r\nshe felt a creeping sensation and numbness, particularly in the arm\r\nwhich was next to the table. She stated positively that in consequence\r\nof this feeling she could predict with the greatest certainty when the\r\natmosphere was highly charged with electricity, as the numbness\r\nincreased on these occasions. The woman averred that shortly before or\r\nduring a thunder storm she always became nauseated. MacDonald offers as\r\na physiologic explanation of this case that probably the impression\r\nproduced forty-two years before implicated the right brachial plexus\r\nand the afferent branches of the pneumogastric, and to some degree the\r\nvomiting center in the medulla; hence, when the atmosphere was highly\r\ncharged with electricity the structures affected became more readily\r\nimpressed. Camby relates the case of a neuropathic woman of\r\nthirty-eight, two of whose children were killed by lightning in her\r\npresence. She herself was unconscious for four days, and when she\r\nrecovered consciousness, she was found to be hemiplegic and\r\nhemianesthetic on the left side. She fully recovered in three weeks.\r\nTwo years later, during a thunder storm, when there was no evidence of\r\na lightning-stroke, she had a second attack, and three years later a\r\nthird attack under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere are some ocular injuries from lightning on record. In these cases\r\nthe lesions have consisted of detachment of the retina, optic atrophy,\r\ncataract, hemorrhages into the retina, and rupture of the choroid,\r\nparalysis of the oculomotor muscles, and paralysis of the optic nerve.\r\nAccording to Buller of Montreal, such injuries may arise from the\r\nmechanic violence sustained by the patient rather than by the thermal\r\nor chemic action of the current. Buller describes a case of\r\nlightning-stroke in which the external ocular muscles, the crystalline\r\nlens, and the optic nerve were involved. Godfrey reports the case of\r\nDaniel Brown, a seaman on H.M.S. Cambrian. While at sea on February 21,\r\n1799, he was struck both dumb and blind by a lightning-stroke. There\r\nwas evidently paralysis of the optic nerve and of the oculomotor\r\nmuscles; and the muscles of the glottis were also in some manner\r\ndeprived of motion.\r\n\r\nThat an amputation can be perfectly performed by a lightning-stroke is\r\nexemplified in the case of Sycyanko of Cracow, Poland. The patient was\r\na boy of twelve, whose right knee was ankylosed. While riding in a\r\nfield in a violent storm, a loud peal of thunder caused the horse to\r\nrun away, and the child fell stunned to the ground. On coming to his\r\nsenses the boy found that his right leg was missing, the parts having\r\nbeen divided at the upper end of the tibia. The wound was perfectly\r\nround and the patella and femur were intact. There were other signs of\r\nburns about the body, but the boy recovered. Some days after the injury\r\nthe missing leg was found near the place where he was first thrown from\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\nThe therapeutic effect of lightning-stroke is verified by a number of\r\ncases, a few of which will be given. Tilesius mentions a peculiar case\r\nwhich was extensively quoted in London. Two brothers, one of whom was\r\ndeaf, were struck by lightning. It was found that the inner part of the\r\nright ear near the tragus and anti-helix of one of the individuals was\r\nscratched, and on the following day his hearing returned. Olmstead\r\nquotes the history of a man in Carteret County, N.C., who was seized\r\nwith a paralytic affection of the face and eyes, and was quite unable\r\nto close his lids. While in his bedroom, he was struck senseless by\r\nlightning, and did not recover until the next day, when it was found\r\nthat the paralysis had disappeared, and during the fourteen years which\r\nhe afterward lived his affection never returned.  There is a record of\r\na young collier in the north of England who lost his sight by an\r\nexplosion of gunpowder, utterly destroying the right eye and fracturing\r\nthe frontal bone. The vision of the left eye was lost without any\r\nserious damage to the organ, and this was attributed to shock. On\r\nreturning from Ettingshall in a severe thunder storm, he remarked to\r\nhis brother that he had seen light through his spectacles, and had\r\nimmediately afterward experienced a piercing sensation which had passed\r\nthrough the eye to the back of the head. The pain was brief, and he was\r\nthen able to see objects distinctly. From this occasion he steadily\r\nimproved until he was able to walk about without a guide.\r\n\r\nLe Conte mentions the case of a negress who was struck by lightning\r\nAugust 19, 1842, on a plantation in Georgia. For years before the\r\nreception of the shock her health had been very bad, and she seemed to\r\nbe suffering from a progressive emaciation and feebleness akin to\r\nchlorosis. The difficulty had probably followed a protracted\r\namenorrhea, subsequent to labor and a retained placenta In the course\r\nof a week she had recovered from the effects of lightning and soon\r\nexperienced complete restoration to health; and for two years had been\r\na remarkably healthy and vigorous laborer. Le Conte quotes five similar\r\ncases, and mentions one in which a lightning-shock to a woman of\r\ntwenty-nine produced amenorrhea, whereas she had previously suffered\r\nfrom profuse menstruation, and also mentions another case of a woman of\r\nseventy who was struck unconscious; the catamenial discharge which had\r\nceased twenty years before, was now permanently reestablished, and the\r\nshrunken mammae again resumed their full contour.\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature or superstition as to lightning-stroke is its\r\nphotographic properties. In this connection Stricker of Frankfort\r\nquotes the case of Raspail of a man of twenty-two who, while climbing a\r\ntree to a bird's nest, was struck by lightning, and afterward showed\r\nupon his breast a picture of the tree, with the nest upon one of its\r\nbranches. Although in the majority of cases the photographs resembled\r\ntrees, there was one case in which it resembled a horse-shoe; another,\r\na cow; a third, a piece of furniture; a fourth, the whole surrounding\r\nlandscape. This theory of lightning-photographs of neighboring objects\r\non the skin has probably arisen from the resemblance of the burns due\r\nto the ramifications of the blood-vessels as conductors, or to peculiar\r\nelectric movements which can be demonstrated by positive charges on\r\nlycopodium powder.\r\n\r\nA lightning-stroke does not exhaust its force on a few individuals or\r\nobjects, but sometimes produces serious manifestations over a large\r\narea, or on a great number of people.  It is said that a church in the\r\nvillage of Chateauneuf, in the Department of the Lower Alps, in France,\r\nwas struck by three successive lightning strokes on July 11, 1819,\r\nduring the installation of a new pastor. The company were all thrown\r\ndown, nine were killed and 82 wounded. The priest, who was celebrating\r\nmass, was not affected, it is believed, on account of his silken robe\r\nacting as an insulator. Bryant of Charlestown, Mass., has communicated\r\nthe particulars of a stroke of lightning on June 20, 1829, which\r\nshocked several hundred persons. The effect of this discharge was felt\r\nover an area of 172,500 square feet with nearly the same degree of\r\nintensity. Happily, there was no permanent injury recorded. Le Conte\r\nreports that a person may be killed when some distance--even as far as\r\n20 miles away from the storm--by what Lord Mahon calls the \"returning\r\nstroke.\"\r\n\r\nSkin-grafting is a subject which has long been more or less familiar to\r\nmedical men, but which has only recently been developed to a\r\npractically successful operation. The older surgeons knew that it was\r\npossible to reunite a resected nose or an amputated finger, and in\r\nHunter's time tooth-replantation was quite well known. Smellie has\r\nrecorded an instance in which, after avulsion of a nipple in suckling,\r\nrestitution was effected.  It is not alone to the skin that grafting is\r\napplicable; it is used in the cornea, nerves, muscles, bones, tendons,\r\nand teeth.  Wolfer has been successful in transplanting the mucous\r\nmembranes of frogs, rabbits, and pigeons to a portion of mucous\r\nmembrane previously occupied by cicatricial tissue, and was the first\r\nto show that on mucous surfaces, mucous membrane remains mucous\r\nmembrane, but when transplanted to skin, it becomes skin.  Attempts\r\nhave been made to transplant a button of clear cornea of a dog, rabbit,\r\nor cat to the cornea of a human being, opaque as the result of\r\nophthalmia, and von Hippel has devised a special method of doing this.\r\nRecently Fuchs has reported his experience in cornea-grafting in\r\nsections, as a substitute for von Hippel's method, in parenchymatous\r\nkeratitis and corneal staphyloma, and though not eminently successful\r\nhimself, he considers the operation worthy of trial in cases that are\r\nwithout help, and doomed to blindness.\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter was the first to perform the implantation of teeth; and\r\nYounger the first to transplant the teeth of man in the jaws of man;\r\nthe initial operation should be called replantation, as it was merely\r\nthe replacement of a tooth in a socket from which it had accidentally\r\nor intentionally been removed. Hunter drilled a hole in a cock's comb\r\nand inserted a tooth, and held it by a ligature. Younger drilled a hole\r\nin a man's jaw and implanted a tooth, and proved that it was not\r\nnecessary to use a fresh tooth.  Ottolengni mentions the case of a man\r\nwho was struck by a ruffian and had his two central incisors knocked\r\nout. He searched for them, washed them in warm water, carefully washed\r\nthe teeth-sockets, and gently placed the teeth back in their position,\r\nwhere they remained firmly attached. At the time of report, six years\r\nafter the accident, they were still firmly in position. Pettyjohn\r\nreports a successful case of tooth-replantation in his young daughter\r\nof two, who fell on the cellar stairs, completely excising the central\r\nincisors. The alveolar process of the right jaw was fractured, and the\r\ngum lacerated to the entire length of the root. The teeth were placed\r\nin a tepid normal saline solution, and the child chloroformed, narcosis\r\nbeing induced in sleep; the gums were cleaned antiseptically, and 3 1/2\r\nhours afterward the child had the teeth firmly in place. They had been\r\nout of the mouth fully an hour.  Four weeks afterward they were as firm\r\nas ever. By their experiments Gluck and Magnus prove that there is a\r\nreturn of activity after transplantation of muscle. After excision of\r\nmalignant tumors of muscles, Helferich of Munich, and Lange of New\r\nYork, have filled the gap left by the excision of the muscle affected\r\nby the tumor with transplanted muscles from dogs. Gluck has induced\r\nreproduction of lost tendons by grafting them with cat-gut, and\r\naccording to Ashhurst, Peyrot has filled the gaps in retracted tendons\r\nby transplanting tendons, taken in one case from a dog, and in another\r\nfrom a cat.\r\n\r\nNerve-grafting, as a supplementary operation to neurectomy, has been\r\npracticed, and Gersung has transplanted the nerves of lower animals to\r\nthe nerve stumps of man.\r\n\r\nBone-grafting is quite frequently practiced, portions from a recently\r\namputated limb, or portions removed from living animals, or bone-chips,\r\nmay be used. Senn proposed decalcified bone-plates to be used to fill\r\nin the gaps. Shifting of the bone has been done, e.g., by dividing a\r\nstrip of the hard palate covered with its soft parts, parallel to the\r\nfissure in cleft palate, but leaving unsevered the bony attachments in\r\nfront, and partially fracturing the pedicle, drawing the bony flaps\r\ntogether with sutures; or, when forming a new nose, by turning down\r\nwith the skin and periosteum the outer table of the frontal bone, split\r\noff with a chisel, after cutting around the part to be removed.\r\nTrueheart reports a case of partial excision of the clavicle,\r\nsuccessfully followed by the grafting of periosteal and osseous\r\nmaterial taken from a dog. Robson and Hayes of Rochester, N.Y., have\r\nsuccessfully supplemented excision of spina bifida by the\r\ntransplantation of a strip of periosteum from a rabbit. Poncet hastened\r\na cure in a case of necrosis with partial destruction of the periosteum\r\nby inserting grafts taken from the bones of a dead infant and from a\r\nkid. Ricketts speaks of bone-grafting and the use of ivory, and remarks\r\nthat Poncet of Lyons restored a tibia in nine months by grafting to the\r\nsuperior articular surface.  Recently amalgam fillings have been used\r\nin bone-cavities to supplant grafting.\r\n\r\nIn destructive injuries of the skin, various materials were formerly\r\nused in grafting, none of which, however, have produced the same good\r\neffect as the use of skin by the Thiersch Method, which will be\r\ndescribed later.\r\n\r\nRodgers, U.S.N., reports the case of a white man of thirty-eight who\r\nsuffered from gangrene of the skin of the buttocks caused by sitting in\r\na pan of caustic potash. When seen the man was intoxicated, and there\r\nwas a gangrenous patch four by six inches on his buttocks. Rodgers used\r\ngrafts from the under wing of a young fowl, as suggested by Redard,\r\nwith good result. Vanmeter of Colorado describes a boy of fourteen with\r\na severe extensive burn; a portion beneath the chin and lower jaw, and\r\nthe right arm from the elbow to the fingers, formed a granulating\r\nsurface which would not heal, and grafting was resorted to. The\r\nneck-grafts were supplied by the skin of the father and brother, but\r\nthe arm-grafts were taken from two young puppies of the Mexican\r\nhairless breed, whose soft, white, hairless skin seemed to offer itself\r\nfor the purpose with good prospect of a successful result.  The outcome\r\nwas all that could be desired. The puppy-grafts took faster and proved\r\nthemselves to be superior to the skin-grafts.  There is a case reported\r\nin which the skin of a greyhound seven days old, taken from the\r\nabdominal wall and even from the tail, was used with most satisfactory\r\nresults in grafting an extensive ulcer following a burn on the left leg\r\nof a boy of ten. Masterman has grafted with the inner membrane of a\r\nhen's egg, and a Mexican surgeon, Altramirano, used the gills of a cock.\r\n\r\nFowler of Brooklyn has grafted with the skin from the back and abdomen\r\nof a large frog. The patient was a colored boy of sixteen, who was\r\nextensively burned by a kerosene lamp. The burns were on the legs,\r\nthighs, buttocks, and right ankle, and the estimated area of burnt\r\nsurface was 247.95 square inches. The frog skin was transferred to the\r\nleft buttocks, and on the right buttocks eight long strips of white\r\nskin were transferred after the manner of Thiersch. A strip of human\r\nskin was placed in one section over the frog skin, but became necrotic\r\nin four days, not being attached to the granulating surface. The man\r\nwas discharged cured in six months. The frog skin was soft, pliable,\r\nand of a reddish hue, while the human white skin was firm and rapidly\r\nbecoming pigmented. Leale cites the successful use of common warts in a\r\ncase of grafting on a man of twenty who was burned on the foot by a\r\nstream of molten metal. Leale remarks that as common warts of the skin\r\nare collections of vascular papillae, admitting of separation without\r\ninjury to their exceptionally thick layer of epidermis, they are\r\nprobably better for the purposes of skin-grafting than ordinary skin of\r\nless vitality or vascularity. Ricketts has succeeded in grafting the\r\nskin of a frog to that of a tortoise, and also grafting frog skin to\r\nhuman skin. Ricketts remarks that the prepuce of a boy is remarkably\r\ngood material for grafting. Sponge-grafts are often used to hasten\r\ncicatrization of integumental wounds. There is recorded an instance in\r\nwhich the breast of a crow and the back of a rat were grafted together\r\nand grew fast. The crow dragged the rat along, and the two did not seem\r\nto care to part company.\r\n\r\nRelative to skin-grafting proper, Bartens succeeded in grafting the\r\nskin of a dead man of seventy on a boy of fourteen. Symonds reports\r\ncases of skin-grafting of large flaps from amputated limbs, and says\r\nthis method is particularly available in large hospitals where they\r\nhave amputations and grafts on the same day.  Martin has shown that,\r\nafter many hours of exposure in the open air at a temperature of nearly\r\n32 degrees F., grafts could be successfully applied, but in such\r\ntemperatures as 82 degrees F., exposure of from six to seven hours\r\ndestroyed their vitality, so that if kept cool, the limb of a healthy\r\nindividual amputated for some accident, may be utilized for grafting\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nReverdin originated the procedure of epidermic grafting. Small grafts\r\nthe size of a pin-head doing quite as well as large ones.\r\nUnfortunately but little diminution of the cicatricial contraction is\r\neffected by Reverdin's method. Thiersch contends that healing of a\r\ngranulated surface results first from a conversion of the soft,\r\nvascular granulation-papillae, by contraction of some of their elements\r\ninto young connective-tissue cells, into \"dry, cicatricial papillae,\"\r\nactually approximating the surrounding tissues, thus diminishing the\r\narea to be covered by epidermis; and, secondly, by the covering of\r\nthese papillae by epidermic cells. Thiersch therefore recommends that\r\nfor the prevention of cicatricial contraction, the grafting be\r\nperformed with large strips of skin.\r\n\r\nHarte gives illustrations of a case of extensive skin-grafting on the\r\nthigh from six inches above the great trochanter well over the median\r\nline anteriorly and over the buttock. This extent is shown in Figure\r\n228, taken five months after the accident, when the granulations had\r\ngrown over the edge about an inch. Figure 229 shows the surface of the\r\nwound, six and one-half months after the accident and three months\r\nafter the applications of numerous skin-grafts.\r\n\r\nCases of self-mutilation may be divided into three classes:--those in\r\nwhich the injuries are inflicted in a moment of temporary insanity from\r\nhallucinations or melancholia; with suicidal intent; and in religious\r\nfrenzy or emotion.  Self-mutilation is seen in the lower animals, and\r\nKennedy, in mentioning the case of a hydrocephalic child who ate off\r\nits entire under lip, speaks also of a dog, of cats, and of a lioness\r\nwho ate off their tails. Kennedy mentions the habit in young children\r\nof biting the finger-nails as an evidence of infantile trend toward\r\nself-mutilation. In the same discussion Collins states that he knew of\r\nan instance in India in which a horse lay down, deliberately exposing\r\nhis anus, and allowing the crows to pick and eat his whole rectum. In\r\ntemporary insanity, in fury, or in grief, the lower animals have been\r\nnoticed by naturalists to mutilate themselves.\r\n\r\nSelf-mutilation in man is almost invariably the result of meditation\r\nover the generative function, and the great majority of cases of this\r\nnature are avulsions or amputations of some parts of the genitalia. The\r\nolder records are full of such instances. Benivenius, Blanchard,\r\nKnackstedt, and Schenck cite cases. Smetius mentions castration which\r\nwas effected by using the finger-nails, and there is an old record in\r\nwhich a man avulsed his own genitals. Scott mentions an instance in\r\nwhich a man amputated his genitals and recovered without subsequent\r\nsymptoms. Gockelius speaks of self-castration in a ruptured man, and\r\nGolding, Guyon, Louis, Laugier, the Ephemerides, Alix, Marstral, and\r\nothers, record instances of self-castration. In his Essays Montaigne\r\nmentions an instance of complete castration performed by the individual\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThiersch mentions a case of a man who circumcised himself when\r\neighteen. He married in 1870, and upon being told that he was a father\r\nhe slit up the hypogastrium from the symphysis pubis to the umbilicus,\r\nso that the omentum protruded; he said his object was to obtain a view\r\nof the interior. Although the knife was dirty and blunt, the wound\r\nhealed after the removal of the extruding omentum. A year later he laid\r\nopen one side of the scrotum. The prolapsed testicle was replaced, and\r\nthe wound healed without serious effect. He again laid open his abdomen\r\nin 1880, the wound again healing notwithstanding the prolapse of the\r\nomentum. In May of the same year he removed the right testicle, and\r\nsewed the wound up himself. Four days later the left was treated the\r\nsame way. The spermatic cord however escaped, and a hematoma, the size\r\nof a child's head, formed on account of which he had to go to the\r\nhospital. This man acted under an uncontrollable impulse to mutilate\r\nhimself, and claimed that until he castrated himself he had no peace of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar report in an Italian journal which was quoted in\r\nLondon. It described a student at law, of delicate complexion, who at\r\nthe age of fourteen gave himself up to masturbation. He continually\r\nstudied until the age of nineteen, when he fell into a state of\r\ndulness, and complained that his head felt as if compressed by a circle\r\nof fire. He said that a voice kept muttering to him that his generative\r\norgans were abnormally deformed or the seat of disease. After that, he\r\nimagined that he heard a cry of \"amputation! amputation!\" Driven by\r\nthis hallucination, he made his first attempt at self-mutilation ten\r\ndays later. He was placed in an Asylum at Astino where, though closely\r\nwatched, he took advantage of the first opportunity and cut off\r\ntwo-thirds of his penis, when the delirium subsided. Camp describes a\r\nstout German of thirty-five who, while suffering from delirium tremens,\r\nfancied that his enemies were trying to steal his genitals, and seizing\r\na sharp knife he amputated his penis close to the pubes. He threw the\r\nsevered organ violently at his imaginary pursuers. The hemorrhage was\r\nprofuse, but ceased spontaneously by the formation of coagulum over the\r\nmouth of the divided vessels. The wound was quite healed in six weeks,\r\nand he was discharged from the hospital, rational and apparently\r\ncontent with his surgical feat.\r\n\r\nRichards reports the case of a Brahman boy of sixteen who had\r\ncontracted syphilis, and convinced, no doubt, that \"nocit empta dolore\r\nvoluptus,\" he had taken effective means of avoiding injury in the\r\nfuture by completely amputating his penis at the root.  Some days after\r\nhis admission to the hospital he asked to be castrated, stating that he\r\nintended to become an ascetic, and the loss of his testes as well as of\r\nhis penis appeared to him to be an imperative condition to the\r\nattainment of that happy consummation. Chevers mentions a somewhat\r\nsimilar case occurring in India.\r\n\r\nSands speaks of a single man of thirty who amputated his penis.  He\r\ngave an incomplete history of syphilis. After connection with a woman\r\nhe became a confirmed syphilophobe and greatly depressed.  While\r\nlaboring under the hallucination that he was possessed of two bodies he\r\ntied a string around the penis and amputated the organ one inch below\r\nthe glans. On loosening the string, three hours afterward, to enable\r\nhim to urinate, he lost three pints of blood, but he eventually\r\nrecovered. In the Pennsylvania Hospital Reports there is an account of\r\na married man who, after drinking several weeks, developed mania a\r\npotu, and was found in his room covered with blood. His penis was\r\ncompletely cut off near the pubes, and the skin of the scrotum was so\r\nfreely incised that the testicles were entirely denuded, but not\r\ninjured. A small silver cap was made to cover the sensitive urethra on\r\na line with the abdominal wall.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of a tall, powerfully-built Russian peasant of\r\ntwenty-nine, of morose disposition, who on April 3d, while reading his\r\nfavorite book, without uttering a cry, suddenly and with a single pull\r\ntore away his scrotum together with his testes. He then arose from the\r\nbank where he had been sitting, and quietly handed the avulsed parts to\r\nhis mother who was sitting near by, saying to her: \"Take that; I do not\r\nwant it any more.\" To all questions from his relatives he asked pardon\r\nand exemption from blame, but gave no reason for his act. This patient\r\nmade a good recovery at the hospital. Alexeef, another Russian, speaks\r\nof a similar injury occurring during an attack of delirium tremens.\r\n\r\nBlack details the history of a young man of nineteen who went to his\r\nbath-room and deliberately placing his scrotum on the edge of the tub\r\nhe cut it crossways down to the wood. He besought Black to remove his\r\ntesticle, and as the spermatic cord was cut and much injured, and\r\nhemorrhage could only be arrested by ligature, the testicle was\r\nremoved. The reason assigned for this act of mutilation was that he had\r\nso frequent nocturnal emissions that he became greatly disgusted and\r\ndepressed in spirit thereby. He had practiced self-abuse for two years\r\nand ascribed his emissions to this cause. Although his act was that of\r\na maniac, the man was perfectly rational. Since the injury he had had\r\nnormal and frequent emissions and erections.\r\n\r\nOrwin mentions the case of a laborer of forty who, in a fit of remorse\r\nafter being several days with a prostitute, atoned for his\r\nunfaithfulness to his wife by opening his scrotum and cutting away his\r\nleft testicle with a pocket knife. The missing organ was found about\r\nsix yards away covered with dirt. At the time of infliction of this\r\ninjury the man was calm and perfectly rational. Warrington relates the\r\nstrange case of Isaac Brooks, an unmarried farmer of twenty-nine, who\r\nwas found December 5, 1879, with extensive mutilations of the scrotum;\r\nhe said that he had been attacked and injured by three men. He swore to\r\nthe identity of two out of the three, and these were transported to ten\r\nyears' penal servitude. On February 13, 1881, he was again found with\r\nmutilation of the external genitals, and again said he had been set\r\nupon by four men who had inflicted his injury, but as he wished it kept\r\nquiet he asked that there be no prosecution. Just before his death on\r\nDecember 31, 1881, he confessed that he had perjured himself, and that\r\nthe mutilations were self-performed.  He was not aware of any morbid\r\nideas as to his sexual organs, and although he had an attack of\r\ngonorrhea ten years before he seemed to worry very little over it.\r\nThere is an account of a Scotch boy who wished to lead a \"holy life,\"\r\nand on two occasions sought the late Mr. Liston's skilful aid in\r\npursuance of this idea. He returned for a third time, having himself\r\nunsuccessfully performed castration.\r\n\r\nA case of self-mutilation by a soldier who was confined in the\r\nguard-house for drunkenness is related by Beck. The man borrowed a\r\nknife from a comrade and cut off the whole external genital apparatus,\r\nremarking as he flung the parts into a corner: \"Any----fool can cut his\r\nthroat, but it takes a soldier to cut his privates off!\" Under\r\ntreatment he recovered, and then he regretted his action.\r\n\r\nSinclair describes an Irishman of twenty-five who, maniacal from\r\nintemperance, first cut off one testicle with a wire nail, and then the\r\nsecond with a trouser-buckle. Not satisfied with the extent of his\r\ninjuries he drove a nail into his temple, first through the skin by\r\nstriking it with his hand, and then by butting it against the\r\nwall,--the latter maneuver causing his death.\r\n\r\nThere is on record the history of an insane medical student in Dublin\r\nwho extirpated both eyes and threw them on the grass. He was in a state\r\nof acute mania, and the explanation offered was that as a \"grinder\"\r\nbefore examination he had been diligently studying the surgery of the\r\neye, and particularly that relating to enucleation. Another Dublin case\r\nquoted by the same authority was that of a young girl who, upon being\r\narrested and committed to a police-cell in a state of furious\r\ndrunkenness, tore out both her eyes. In such cases, as a rule, the\r\nfinger-nails are the only instrument used. There is a French case also\r\nquoted of a woman of thirty-nine who had borne children in rapid\r\nsuccession. While suckling a child three months old she became much\r\nexcited, and even fanatical, in reading the Bible. Coming to the\r\npassage, \"If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, etc.,\" she was so\r\nimpressed with the necessity of obeying the divine injunction that she\r\nenucleated her eye with a meat-hook. There is mentioned the case of a\r\nyoung woman who cut off her right hand and cast it into the fire, and\r\nattempted to enucleate her eyes, and also to hold her remaining hand in\r\nthe fire. Haslam reports the history of a female who mutilated herself\r\nby grinding glass between her teeth.\r\n\r\nChanning gives an account of the case of Helen Miller, a German Jewess\r\nof thirty, who was admitted to the Asylum for Insane Criminals at\r\nAuburn, N.Y., in October, 1872, and readmitted in June, 1875, suffering\r\nfrom simulation of hematemesis. On September 25th she cut her left\r\nwrist and right hand; in three weeks she became again \"discouraged\"\r\nbecause she was refused opium, and again cut her arms below the elbows,\r\ncleanly severing the skin and fascia, and completely hacking the\r\nmuscles in every direction. Six weeks later she repeated the latter\r\nfeat over the seat of the recently healed cicatrices. The right arm\r\nhealed, but the left showed erysipelatous inflammation, culminating in\r\nedema, which affected the glottis to such an extent that tracheotomy\r\nwas performed to save her life. Five weeks after convalescence, during\r\nwhich her conduct was exemplary, she again cut her arms in the same\r\nplace. In the following April, for the merest trifle, she again\r\nrepeated the mutilation, but this time leaving pieces of glass in the\r\nwounds. Six months later she inflicted a wound seven inches in length,\r\nin which she inserted 30 pieces of glass, seven long splinters, and\r\nfive shoe-nails. In June, 1877, she cut herself for the last time. The\r\nfollowing articles were taken from her arms and preserved: Ninety-four\r\npieces of glass, 34 splinters, two tacks, five shoe-nails, one pin, and\r\none needle, besides other things which were lost,--making altogether\r\nabout 150 articles.\r\n\r\n\"Needle-girls,\" etc.--A peculiar type of self-mutilation is the habit\r\nsometimes seen in hysteric persons of piercing their flesh with\r\nnumerous needles or pins. Herbolt of Copenhagen tells of a young Jewess\r\nfrom whose body, in the course of eighteen months, were extracted 217\r\nneedles. Sometime after 100 more came from a tumor on the shoulder. As\r\nall the symptoms in this case were abdominal, it was supposed that\r\nduring an epileptic seizure this girl had swallowed the needles; but as\r\nshe was of an hysteric nature it seems more likely they had entered the\r\nbody through the skin. There is an instance in which 132 needles were\r\nextracted from a young lady's person. Caen describes a woman of\r\ntwenty-six, while in prison awaiting trial, succeeding in committing\r\nsuicide by introducing about 30 pins and needles in the chest region,\r\nover the heart. Her method was to gently introduce them, and then to\r\npress them deeper with a prayer-book. An autopsy showed that some of\r\nthe pins had reached the lungs, some were in the mediastinum, on the\r\nback part of the right auricle; the descending vena cave was\r\nperforated, the anterior portion of the left ventricle was transfixed\r\nby a needle, and several of the articles were found in the liver.\r\nAndrews removed 300 needles from the body of an insane female. The\r\nLancet records an account of a suicide by the penetration of a\r\ndarning-needle in the epigastrium. There were nine punctures in this\r\nregion, and in the last the needle was left in situ and fixed by\r\nworsted. In 1851 the same journal spoke of an instance in which 30 pins\r\nwere removed from the limbs of a servant girl. It was said that while\r\nhanging clothes, with her mouth full of pins, she was slapped on the\r\nshoulder, causing her to start and swallow the pins. There is another\r\nreport of a woman who swallowed great numbers of pins. On her death one\r\npound and nine ounces of pins were found in her stomach and duodenum.\r\nThere are individuals known as \"human pin-cushions,\" who publicly\r\nintroduce pins and needles into their bodies for gain's sake.\r\n\r\nThe wanderings of pins and needles in the body are quite well known.\r\nSchenck records the finding of a swallowed pin in the liver. Haller\r\nmentions one that made its way to the hand. Silvy speaks of a case in\r\nwhich a quantity of swallowed pins escaped through the muscles, the\r\nbladder, and vagina; there is another record in which the pins escaped\r\nmany years afterward from the thigh. The Philosophical Transactions\r\ncontain a record of the escape of a pin from the skin of the arm after\r\nit had entered by the mouth. Gooch, Ruysch, Purmann, and Hoffman speak\r\nof needle-wanderings. Stephenson gives an account of a pin which was\r\nfinally voided by the bladder after forty-two years' sojourn in a\r\nlady's body. On November 15, 1802, the celebrated Dr. Lettsom spoke of\r\nan old lady who sat on a needle while riding in a hackney coach; it\r\npassed from the injured leg to the other one, whence it was extracted.\r\nDeckers tells of a gentleman who was wounded in the right\r\nhypochondrium, the ball being taken thirty years afterward from the\r\nknee. Borellus gives an account of a thorn entering the digit and\r\npassing out of the body by the anus.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, a prick of a pin not entering a vital center or\r\norgan has been the indirect cause of death. Augenius writes of a tailor\r\nwho died in consequence of a prick of a needle between the nail and\r\nflesh of the end of the thumb. Amatus Lusitanus mentions a similar\r\ninstance in an old woman, although, from the symptoms given, the direct\r\ncause was probably tetanus.  In modern times Cunninghame, Boring, and\r\nHobart mention instances in which death has followed the prick of a\r\npin: in Boring's case the death occurred on the fifth day.\r\n\r\nManufacture of Crippled Beggars.--Knowing the sympathy of the world in\r\ngeneral for a cripple, in some countries low in the moral scale,\r\nvoluntary mutilation is sometimes practiced by those who prefer begging\r\nto toiling. In the same manner artificial monstrosities have been\r\nmanufactured solely for gain's sake. We quite often read of these\r\ninstances in lay-journals, but it is seldom that a case comes under the\r\nimmediate observation of a thoroughly scientific mind. There is,\r\nhowever, on record a remarkable instance accredited to Jamieson of\r\nShanghai who presented to the Royal College of Surgeons a pair of feet\r\nwith the following history: Some months previously a Chinese beggar had\r\nexcited much pity and made a good business by showing the mutilated\r\nstumps of his legs, and the feet that had belonged to them slung about\r\nhis neck. While one day scrambling out of the way of a constable who\r\nhad forbidden this gruesome spectacle, he was knocked down by a\r\ncarriage in the streets of Shanghai, and was taken to the hospital,\r\nwhere he was questioned about the accident which deprived him of his\r\nfeet. After selling the medical attendant his feet he admitted that he\r\nhad purposely performed the amputations himself, starting about a year\r\npreviously. He had fastened cords about his ankles, drawing them as\r\ntightly as he could bear them, and increasing the pressure every two or\r\nthree days. For a fortnight his pain was extreme, but when the bones\r\nwere bared his pains ceased. At the end of a month and a half he was\r\nable to entirely remove his feet by partly snapping and partly cutting\r\nthe dry bone. Such cases appear to be quite common in China, and by\r\ninvestigation many parallels could elsewhere be found.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese custom of foot-binding is a curious instance of\r\nself-mutilation. In a paper quoted in the Philadelphia Medical Times,\r\nJanuary 31, 1880, a most minute account of the modus operandi, the\r\nduration, and the suffering attendant on this process are given.\r\nStrapping of the foot by means of tight bandages requires a period of\r\ntwo or three years' continuance before the desired effect is produced.\r\nThere is a varying degree of pain, which is most severe during the\r\nfirst year and gradually diminishes after the binding of all the joints\r\nis completed.  During the binding the girl at night lies across the\r\nbed, putting her legs on the edge of the bed-stead in such a manner as\r\nto make pressure under the knees, thus benumbing the parts below and\r\navoiding the major degree of pain. In this position, swinging their\r\nlegs backward and forward, the poor Chinese girls pass many a weary\r\nnight. During this period the feet are unbound once a month only. The\r\noperation is begun by placing the end of a long, narrow bandage on the\r\ninside of the instep and carrying it over the four smaller toes,\r\nsecuring them under the foot. After several turns the bandage is\r\nreversed so as to compress the foot longitudinally. The young girl is\r\nthen left for a month, and when the bandage is removed the foot is\r\noften found gangrenous and ulcerated, one or two toes not infrequently\r\nbeing lost. If the foot is thus bound for two years it becomes\r\nvirtually dead and painless. By this time the calf disappears from lack\r\nof exercise, the bones are attenuated, and all the parts are dry and\r\nshrivelled. In after-life the leg frequently regains its muscles and\r\nadipose tissue, but the foot always remains small. The binding process\r\nis said to exert a markedly depressing influence upon the emotional\r\ncharacter of the subject, which lasts through life, and is very\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nTo show how minute some of the feet of the Chinese women are, Figure I\r\nof the accompanying plate, taken from a paper by Kenthughes on the\r\n\"Feet of Chinese Ladies\" is from a photograph of a shoe that measured\r\nonly 3 1/4 inches anteroposteriorly. The foot which it was intended to\r\nfill must have been smaller still, for the bandage would take up a\r\ncertain amount of space. Figure II is a reproduction of a photograph of\r\na foot measuring 5 1/2 inches anteroposteriorly, the wrinkled\r\nappearance of the skin being due to prolonged immersion in spirit. This\r\nphotograph shows well the characteristics of the Chinese foot--the\r\nprominent and vertically placed heel, which is raised generally about\r\nan inch from the level of the great toe; the sharp artificial cavus,\r\nproduced by the altered position of the os calcis, and the downward\r\ndeflection of the foot in front of the mediotarsal joint; the straight\r\nand downward pointing great toe, and the infolding of the smaller toes\r\nunderneath the great toe. In Figure III we have a photograph of the\r\nskeleton of a Chinese lady's foot about five inches in anteroposterior\r\ndiameter. The mesial axis of the os calcis is almost directly vertical,\r\nwith a slight forward inclination, forming a right angle with the bones\r\nin front of the mediotarsal joint. The upper three-quarters of the\r\nanterior articular surface of the calcis is not in contact with the\r\ncuboid, the latter being depressed obliquely forward and downward, the\r\nlower portion of the posterior facet on the cuboid articulating with a\r\nnew surface on the under portion of the bone.  The general shape of the\r\nbone closely resembles that of a normal one--a marked contrast to its\r\nwasted condition and tapering extremity in paralytic calcaneus.\r\nExtension and flexion at the ankle are only limited by the shortness of\r\nthe ligaments; there is no opposition from the conformation of the\r\nbones. The astragalus is almost of normal shape; the trochlea is\r\nslightly prolonged anteriorly, especially on the inner side, from\r\ncontact with the tibial articular surface. The cartilage on the exposed\r\nposterior portion of the trochlea seems healthy. The head of the\r\nastragalus is very prominent on the outer side, the scaphoid being\r\ndepressed downward and inward away from it. The anterior articular\r\nsurface is prolonged in the direction of the displaced scaphoid. The\r\nscaphoid, in addition to its displacement, is much compressed on the\r\nplanter surface, being little more than one-half the width of the\r\ndorsal surface. The cuboid is displaced obliquely downward and forward,\r\nso that the upper part of the posterior articular surface is not in\r\ncontact with the calcis.\r\n\r\nA professional leg-breaker is described in the Weekly Medical Review of\r\nSt. Louis, April, 1890. This person's name was E. L.  Landers, and he\r\nwas accredited with earning his living by breaking or pretending to\r\nbreak his leg in order to collect damages for the supposed injury.\r\nMoreover, this individual had but one leg, and was compelled to use\r\ncrutches. At the time of report he had succeeded in obtaining damages\r\nin Wichita, Kansas, for a supposed fracture. The Review quotes a\r\nnewspaper account of this operation as follows.--\r\n\r\n\"According to the Wichita Dispatch he represented himself as a\r\ntelegraph operator who was to have charge of the postal telegraph\r\noffice in that city as soon as the line reached there. He remained\r\nabout town for a month until he found an inviting piece of defective\r\nsidewalk, suitable for his purpose, when he stuck his crutch through\r\nthe hole and fell screaming to the ground, declaring that he had broken\r\nhis leg. He was carried to a hospital, and after a week's time, during\r\nwhich he negotiated a compromise with the city authorities and\r\ncollected $1000 damages, a confederate, claiming to be his nephew,\r\nappeared and took the wounded man away on a stretcher, saying that he\r\nwas going to St.  Louis. Before the train was fairly out of Wichita,\r\nLanders was laughing and boasting over his successful scheme to beat\r\nthe town. The Wichita story is in exact accord with the artistic\r\nmethods of a one-legged sharper who about 1878 stuck his crutch through\r\na coal-hole here, and, falling heels over head, claimed to have\r\nsustained injuries for which he succeeded in collecting something like\r\n$1500 from the city. He is described as a fine-looking fellow, well\r\ndressed, and wearing a silk hat. He lost one leg in a railroad\r\naccident, and having collected a good round sum in damages for it,\r\nadopted the profession of leg-breaking in order to earn a livelihood.\r\nHe probably argued that as he had made more money in that line than in\r\nany other he was especially fitted by natural talents to achieve\r\ndistinction in this direction. But as it would be rather awkward to\r\nlose his remaining leg altogether he modified the idea and contents\r\nhimself with collecting the smaller amounts which ordinary fractures of\r\nthe hip-joint entitle such an expert 'fine worker' to receive.\r\n\r\n\"He first appeared here in 1874 and succeeded, it is alleged, in\r\nbeating the Life Association of America. After remaining for some time\r\nin the hospital he was removed on a stretcher to an Illinois village,\r\nfrom which point the negotiations for damages were conducted by\r\ncorrespondence, until finally a point of agreement was reached and an\r\nagent of the company was sent to pay him the money. This being\r\naccomplished the agent returned to the depot to take the train back to\r\nSt. Louis when he was surprised to see the supposed sufferer stumping\r\naround on his crutches on the depot platform, laughing and jesting over\r\nthe ease with which he had beaten the corporation.\r\n\r\n\"He afterward fell off a Wabash train at Edwardsville and claimed to\r\nhave sustained serious injuries, but in this case the company's\r\nattorneys beat him and proved him to be an impostor. In 1879 he\r\nstumbled into the telegraph office at the Union Depot here, when Henry\r\nC. Mahoney, the superintendent, catching sight of him, put him out,\r\nwith the curt remark that he didn't want him to stick that crutch into\r\na cuspidor and fall down, as it was too expensive a performance for the\r\ncompany to stand. He beat the Missouri Pacific and several other\r\nrailroads and municipalities at different times, it is claimed, and\r\nmanages to get enough at each successful venture to carry him along for\r\na year or eighteen months, by which time the memory of his trick fades\r\nout of the public mind, when he again bobs up serenely.\"\r\n\r\nAnomalous Suicides.--The literature on suicide affords many instances\r\nof self-mutilations and ingenious modes of producing death. In the\r\nDublin Medical Press for 1854 there is an extraordinary case of\r\nsuicide, in which the patient thrust a red-hot poker into his abdomen\r\nand subsequently pulled it out, detaching portions of the omentum and\r\n32 inches of the colon.  Another suicide in Great Britain swallowed a\r\nred-hot poker. In commenting on suicides, in 1835, Arntzenius speaks of\r\nan ambitious Frenchman who was desirous of leaving the world in a\r\ndistinguished manner, and who attached himself to a rocket of enormous\r\nsize which he had built for the purpose, and setting fire to it, ended\r\nhis life. On September 28, 1895, according to the Gaulois and the New\r\nYork Herald (Paris edition) of that date, there was admitted to the\r\nHopital St. Louis a clerk, aged twenty-five, whom family troubles had\r\nrendered desperate and who had determined to seek death as a relief\r\nfrom his misery.  Reviewing the various methods of committing suicide\r\nhe found none to his taste, and resolved on something new. Being\r\nfamiliar with the constituents of explosives, he resolved to convert\r\nhis body into a bomb, load it with explosives, and thus blow himself to\r\npieces. He procured some powdered sulphur and potassium chlorate, and\r\nplacing each in a separate wafer he swallowed both with the aid of\r\nwater. He then lay down on his bed, dressed in his best clothes,\r\nexpecting that as soon as the two explosive materials came into contact\r\nhe would burst like a bomb and his troubles would be over. Instead of\r\nthe anticipated result the most violent collicky pains ensued, which\r\nfinally became so great that he had to summon his neighbors, who took\r\nhim to the hospital, where, after vigorous application with the\r\nstomach-pump, it was hoped that his life would be saved. Sankey\r\nmentions an epileptic who was found dead in his bed in the Oxford\r\nCounty Asylum; the man had accomplished his end by placing a round\r\npebble in each nostril, and thoroughly impacting in his throat a strip\r\nof flannel done up in a roll. In his \"Institutes of Surgery\" Sir\r\nCharles Bell remarks that his predecessor at the Middlesex Hospital\r\nentered into a conversation with his barber over an attempt at suicide\r\nin the neighborhood, during which the surgeon called the \"would-be\r\nsuicide\" a fool, explaining to the barber how clumsy his attempts had\r\nbeen at the same time giving him an extempore lecture on the anatomic\r\nconstruction of the neck, and showing him how a successful suicide in\r\nthis region should be performed. At the close of the conversation the\r\nunfortunate barber retired into the back area of his shop, and\r\nfollowing minutely the surgeon's directions, cut his throat in such a\r\nmanner that there was no hope of saving him. It is supposed that one\r\ncould commit suicide by completely gilding or varnishing the body, thus\r\neliminating the excretory functions of the skin. There is an old story\r\nof an infant who was gilded to appear at a Papal ceremony who died\r\nshortly afterward from the suppression of the skin-function. The fact\r\nis one well established among animals, but after a full series of\r\nactual experiments, Tecontjeff of St.  Petersburg concludes that in\r\nthis respect man differs from animals. This authority states that in\r\nman no tangible risk is entailed by this process, at least for any\r\nlength of time required for therapeutic purposes. \"Tarred and\r\nfeathered\" persons rarely die of the coating of tar they receive. For\r\nother instances of peculiar forms of suicide reference may be made to\r\nnumerous volumes on this subject, prominent among which is that by\r\nBrierre de Boismont, which, though somewhat old, has always been found\r\ntrustworthy, and also to the chapters on this subject written by\r\nvarious authors on medical jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nReligious and Ceremonial Mutilations.--Turning now to the subject of\r\nself-mutilation and self-destruction from the peculiar customs or\r\nreligious beliefs of people, we find pages of information at our\r\ndisposal. It is not only among the savage or uncivilized tribes that\r\nsuch ideas have prevailed, but from the earliest times they have had\r\ntheir influence upon educated minds. In the East, particularly in\r\nIndia, the doctrines of Buddhism, that the soul should be without fear,\r\nthat it could not be destroyed, and that the flesh was only its\r\nresting-place, the soul several times being reincarnated, brought about\r\ngreat indifference to bodily injuries and death. In the history of the\r\nBrahmans there was a sect of philosophers called the Gymnosophists, who\r\nhad the extremest indifference to life. To them incarnation was a\r\npositive fact, and death was simply a change of residence. One of these\r\nphilosophers, Calanus, was burned in the presence of Alexander; and,\r\naccording to Plutarch, three centuries later another Gymnosophist named\r\nJarmenochegra, was similarly burned before Augustus. Since this time,\r\naccording to Brierre de Boismont, the suicides from indifference to\r\nlife in this mystic country are counted by the thousands. Penetrating\r\nJapan the same sentiment, according to report, made it common in the\r\nearlier history of that country to see ships on its coasts, filled with\r\nfanatics who, by voluntary dismantling, submerged the vessels little by\r\nlittle, the whole multitude sinking into the sea while chanting praises\r\nto their idols. The same doctrines produced the same result in China.\r\nAccording to Brucker it is well known that among the 500 philosophers\r\nof the college of Confucius, there were many who disdained to survive\r\nthe loss of their books (burned by order of the savage Emperor\r\nChi-Koung-ti), and throwing themselves into the sea, they disappeared\r\nunder the waves. According to Brierre de Boismont, voluntary mutilation\r\nor death was very rare among the Chaldeans, the Persians, or the\r\nHebrews, their precepts being different from those mentioned. The\r\nHebrews in particular had an aversion to self-murder, and during a\r\nperiod in their history of 4000 years there were only eight or ten\r\nsuicides recorded. Josephus shows what a marked influence on suicides\r\nthe invasion of the Romans among the Hebrews had.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, as in India, there were Gymnosophists. In Egypt Sesostris,\r\nthe grandest king of the country, having lost his eyesight in his old\r\nage, calmly and deliberately killed himself.  About the time of Mark\r\nAnthony and Cleopatra, particularly after the battle of Actium, suicide\r\nwas in great favor in Egypt. In fact a great number of persons formed\r\nan academy called The Synapothanoumenes, who had for their object the\r\nidea of dying together. In Western Europe, as shown in the ceremonies\r\nof the Druids, we find among the Celts a propensity for suicide and an\r\nindifference to self-torture. The Gauls were similarly minded,\r\nbelieving in the dogma of immortality and eternal repose. They thought\r\nlittle of bodily cares and ills. In Greece and Rome there was always an\r\napology for suicide and death in the books of the philosophers. \"Nil\r\nigitur mors est, ad nos neque pertinet hilum; quando quidem natura\r\nanimi mortalis habetur!\" cries Lucretius.  With the advent of\r\nChristianity, condemning as it did the barbarous customs of\r\nself-mutilation and self-murder, these practices seem to disappear\r\ngradually; but stoicism and indifference to pain were exhibited in\r\nmartyrdom. Toward the middle ages, when fanaticism was at its height\r\nand the mental malady of demoniacal possession was prevalent, there was\r\nsomething of a reversion to the old customs. In the East the Juggernaut\r\nprocession was still in vogue, but this was suppressed by civilized\r\nauthorities; outside of a few minor customs still prevalent among our\r\nown people we must to-day look to the savage tribes for the\r\nperpetuation of such practices.\r\n\r\nIn an excellent article on the evolution of ceremonial institutions\r\nHerbert Spencer mentions the Fuegians, Veddahs, Andamanese, Dyaks,\r\nTodas, Gonds, Santals, Bodos, and Dhimals, Mishmis, Kamchadales, and\r\nSnake Indians, as among people who form societies to practice simple\r\nmutilations in slight forms.  Mutilations in somewhat graver forms, but\r\nstill in moderation, are practiced by the Tasmanians, Tamaese, the\r\npeople of New Guinea, Karens, Nagas, Ostiaks, Eskimos, Chinooks,\r\nComanches, and Chippewas. What might be called mixed or compound\r\nmutilations are practiced by the New Zealanders, East Africans, Kondes,\r\nKukas, and Calmucks. Among those practising simple but severe\r\nmutilations are the New Caledonians, the Bushmen, and some indigenous\r\nAustralians. Those tribes having for their customs the practice of\r\ncompound major mutilations are the Fiji Islanders, Sandwich Islanders,\r\nTahitians, Tongans, Samoans, Javanese, Sumatrans, natives of Malagasy,\r\nHottentots, Damaras, Bechuanas, Kaffirs, the Congo people, the Coast\r\nNegroes, Inland Negroes, Dahomeans, Ashantees, Fulahs, Abyssinians,\r\nArabs, and Dakotas.  Spencer has evidently made a most extensive and\r\ncomprehensive study of this subject, and his paper is a most valuable\r\ncontribution to the subject. In the preparation of this section we have\r\nfrequently quoted from it.\r\n\r\nThe practice of self-bleeding has its origin in other mutilations,\r\nalthough the Aztecs shed human blood in the worship of the sun. The\r\nSamoiedes have a custom of drinking the blood of warm animals. Those of\r\nthe Fijians who were cannibals drank the warm blood of their victims.\r\nAmong the Amaponda Kaffirs there are horrible accounts of kindred\r\nsavage customs. Spencer quotes:--\"It is usual for the ruling chief on\r\nhis accession to be washed in the blood of a near relative, generally a\r\nbrother, who is put to death for the occasion.\" During a Samoan\r\nmarriage-ceremony the friends of the bride \"took up stones and beat\r\nthemselves until their heads were bruised and bleeding.\" In Australia a\r\nnovitiate at the ceremony of manhood drank a mouthful of blood from the\r\nveins of the warrior who was to be his sponsor.\r\n\r\nAt the death of their kings the Lacedemonians met in large numbers and\r\ntore the flesh from their foreheads with pins and needles. It is said\r\nthat when Odin was near his death he ordered himself to be marked with\r\na spear; and Niort, one of his successors, followed the example of his\r\npredecessor. Shakespeare speaks of \"such as boast and show their\r\nscars.\" In the olden times it was not uncommon for a noble soldier to\r\nmake public exhibition of his scars with the greatest pride; in fact,\r\non the battlefield they invited the reception of superficial\r\ndisfiguring injuries, and to-day some students of the learned\r\nuniversities of Germany seem prouder of the possession of scars\r\nreceived in a duel of honor than in awards for scholastic attainments.\r\n\r\nLichtenstein tells of priests among the Bechuanas who made long cuts\r\nfrom the thigh to the knee of each warrior who slew an enemy in battle.\r\nAmong some tribes of the Kaffirs a kindred custom was practiced; and\r\namong the Damaras, for every wild animal a young man destroyed his\r\nfather made four incisions on the front of his son's body. Speaking of\r\ncertain Congo people, Tuckey says that they scar themselves principally\r\nwith the idea of rendering themselves agreeable to the women of their\r\ntribe. Among the Itzaex Indians of Yucatan, a race with particularly\r\nhandsome features, some are marked with scarred lines, inflicted as\r\nsigns of courage.\r\n\r\nCosmetic Mutilations.--In modern times there have been individuals\r\nexpert in removing facial deformities, and by operations of various\r\nkinds producing pleasing dimples or other artificial signs of beauty.\r\nWe have seen an apparatus advertised to be worn on the nose during the\r\nnight for the purpose of correcting a disagreeable contour of this\r\norgan. A medical description of the artificial manufacture of dimples\r\nis as follows:--\"The modus operandi was to make a puncture in the skin\r\nwhere the dimple was required, which would not be noticed when healed,\r\nand, with a very delicate instrument, remove a portion of the muscle.\r\nInflammation was then excited in the skin over the subcutaneous pit,\r\nand in a few days the wound, if such it may be called, was healed, and\r\na charming dimple was the result.\" It is quite possible that some of\r\nour modern operators have overstepped the bounds of necessity, and\r\nperformed unjustifiable plastic operations to satisfy the vanity of\r\ntheir patients.\r\n\r\nDobrizhoffer says of the Abipones that boys of seven pierce their\r\nlittle arms in imitation of their parents. Among some of the indigenous\r\nAustralians it is quite customary for ridged and linear scars to be\r\nself-inflicted. In Tanna the people produce elevated scars on the arms\r\nand chests. Bancroft recites that family-marks of this nature existed\r\namong the Cuebas of Central America, refusal being tantamount to\r\nrebellion. Schomburgk tells that among the Arawaks, after a Mariquawi\r\ndance, so great is their zeal for honorable scars, the blood will run\r\ndown their swollen calves, and strips of skin and muscle hang from the\r\nmangled limbs. Similar practices rendered it necessary for the United\r\nStates Government to stop some of the ceremonial dances of the Indians\r\nunder their surveillance.\r\n\r\nA peculiar custom among savages is the amputation of a finger as a\r\nsacrifice to a deity. In the tribe of the Dakotas the relatives of a\r\ndead chief pacified his spirit by amputating a finger. In a similar\r\nway, during his initiation, the young Mandan warrior, \"holding up the\r\nlittle finger of his left hand to the Great Spirit,\" ... \"expresses his\r\nwillingness to give it as a sacrifice, and he lays it on the dried\r\nbuffalo skull, when another chops it off near the hand with a blow of\r\nthe hatchet.\" According to Mariner the natives of Tonga cut off a\r\nportion of the little finger as a sacrifice to the gods for the\r\nrecovery of a superior sick relative. The Australians have a custom of\r\ncutting off the last joint of the little finger of females as a token\r\nof submission to powerful beings alive and dead. A Hottentot widow who\r\nmarries a second time must have the distal joint of her little finger\r\ncut off; another joint is removed each time she remarries.\r\n\r\nAmong the mutilations submitted to on the death of a king or chief in\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, Cook mentions in his \"Voyages\" the custom of\r\nknocking out from one to four front teeth.\r\n\r\nAmong the Australian tribes the age of virility and the transition into\r\nmanhood is celebrated by ceremonial customs, in which the novices are\r\nsubjected to minor mutilations. A sharp bone is used for lancing their\r\ngums, while the throw-stick is used for knocking out a tooth.\r\nSometimes, in addition to this crude dentistry, the youth is required\r\nto submit to cruel gashes cut upon his back and shoulders, and should\r\nhe flinch or utter any cry of pain he is always thereafter classed with\r\nwomen.  Haygarth writes of a semi-domesticated Australian who said one\r\nday, with a look of importance, that he must go away for a few days, as\r\nhe had grown to man's estate, and it was high time he had his teeth\r\nknocked out. It is an obligatory rite among various African tribes to\r\nlose two or more of their front teeth. A tradition among certain\r\nPeruvians was that the Conqueror Huayna Coapae made a law that they and\r\ntheir descendants should have three front teeth pulled out in each jaw.\r\nCieza speaks of another tradition requiring the extraction of the teeth\r\nof children by their fathers as a very acceptable service to their\r\ngods. The Damaras knock out a wedge-shaped gap between two of their\r\nfront teeth; and the natives of Sierra Leone file or chip their teeth\r\nafter the same fashion.\r\n\r\nDepilatory customs are very ancient, and although minor in extent are\r\nstill to be considered under the heading of mutilations. The giving of\r\nhair to the dead as a custom, has been perpetuated through many tribes\r\nand nations. In Euripides we find Electra admonishing Helen for sparing\r\nher locks, and thereby defrauding the dead. Alexander the Great shaved\r\nhis locks in mourning for his friend, Hephaestion, and it was supposed\r\nthat his death was hastened by the sun's heat on his bare head after\r\nhis hat blew off at Babylon. Both the Dakota Indians and the Caribs\r\nmaintain the custom of sacrificing hair to the dead. In Peru the custom\r\nwas varied by pulling out eyelashes and eyebrows and presenting them to\r\nthe sun, the hills, etc. It is said this custom is still in\r\ncontinuance. When Clovis was visited by the Bishop of Toulouse he gave\r\nhim a hair from his beard and was imitated by his followers. In the\r\nArthurian legends we find \"Then went Arthur to Caerleon; and thither\r\ncame messages from King Ryons who said, 'even kings have done me\r\nhomage, and with their beards I have trimmed a mantle. Send me now thy\r\nbeard, for there lacks yet one to the finishing of the mantle.'\" The\r\nassociation between short hair and slavery arose from the custom of\r\ntaking hair from the slain. It existed among the Greeks and Romans, and\r\nwas well known among the indigenous tribes of this continent. Among the\r\nShoshones he who took the most scalps gained the most glory.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the prisoners of the Chicimecs Bancroft says they were\r\noften scalped while yet alive, and the bloody trophies placed on the\r\nheads of their tormentors. In this manner we readily see that long hair\r\namong the indigenous tribes and various Orientals, Ottomans, Greeks,\r\nFranks, Goths, etc., was considered a sign of respect and honor. The\r\nrespect and preservation of the Chinese queue is well known in the\r\npresent day. Wishing to divide their brother's kingdom, Clothair and\r\nChildebert consulted whether to cut off the hair of their nephews, the\r\nrightful successors, so as to reduce them to the rank of subjects, or\r\nto kill them. The gods of various people, especially the greater gods,\r\nwere distinguished by their long beards and flowing locks. In all\r\npictures Thor and Samson were both given long hair, and the belief in\r\nstrength and honor from long hair is proverbial. Hercules is always\r\npictured with curls.  According to Goldzhier, long locks of hair and a\r\nlong beard are mythologic attributes of the sun. The sun's rays are\r\ncompared to long locks or hairs on the face of the sun. When the sun\r\nsets and leaves his place to the darkness, or when the powerful summer\r\nsun is succeeded by the weak rays of the winter sun, then Samson's long\r\nlocks, through which alone his strength remains, are cut off by the\r\ntreachery of his deceitful concubine Delilah (the languishing,\r\naccording to the meaning of the name). The beaming Apollo was,\r\nmoreover, called the \"Unshaven;\" and Minos cannot conquer the solar\r\nhero, Nisos, until the latter loses his golden hair. In Arabic\r\n\"Shams-on\" means the sun, and Samson had seven locks of hair, the\r\nnumber of the planetary bodies. In view of the foregoing facts it seems\r\nquite possible that the majority of depilatory processes on the scalp\r\noriginated in sun-worship, and through various phases and changes in\r\nreligions were perpetuated to the Middle Ages. Charles Martel sent\r\nPepin, his son, to Luithprand, king of the Lombards, that he might cut\r\nhis first locks, and by this ceremony hold for the future the place of\r\nhis illustrious father. To make peace with Alaric, Clovis became his\r\nadopted son by offering his beard to be cut. Among the Caribs the hair\r\nconstituted their chief pride, and it was considered unequivocal proof\r\nof the sincerity of their sorrow, when on the death of a relative they\r\ncut their hair short. Among the Hebrews shaving of the head was a\r\nfuneral rite, and among the Greeks and Romans the hair was cut short in\r\nmourning, either for a relative or for a celebrated personage.\r\nAccording to Krehl the Arabs also had such customs. Spencer mentions\r\nthat during an eruption in Hawaii, \"King Kamahameha cut off part of his\r\nown hair\" ... \"and threw it into the torrent (of lava).\"\r\n\r\nThe Tonga regarded the pubic hairs as under the special care of the\r\ndevil, and with great ceremony made haste to remove them. The female\r\ninhabitants of some portions of the coast of Guinea remove the pubic\r\nhairs as fast as they appear. A curious custom of Mohammedan ladies\r\nafter marriage is to rid themselves of the hirsute appendages of the\r\npubes. Depilatory ointments are employed, consisting of equal parts of\r\nslaked lime and arsenic made into a paste with rose-water. It is said\r\nthat this important ceremony is not essential in virgins. One of the\r\nceremonies of assuming the toga virilis among the indigenous\r\nAustralians consists in submitting to having each particular hair\r\nplucked singly from the body, the candidate being required not to\r\ndisplay evidences of pain during the operation. Formerly the Japanese\r\nwomen at marriage blackened their teeth and shaved or pulled out their\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe custom of boring the ear is very old, mention of it being made in\r\nExodus xxi., 5 and 6, in which we find that if a Hebrew servant served\r\nfor six years, his freedom was optional, but if he plainly said that he\r\nloved his master, and his wife and children, and did not desire to\r\nleave their house, the master should bring him before the judges; and\r\naccording to the passage in Exodus, \"he shall also bring him to the\r\ndoor or unto the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through\r\nwith an awl; and he shall serve him forever.\" All the Burmese, says\r\nSangermano, without exception, have the custom of boring their ears.\r\nThe days when the operations were performed were kept as festivals. The\r\nludicrous custom of piercing the ears for the wearing of ornaments,\r\ntypical of savagery and found in all indigenous African tribes, is\r\nuniversally prevalent among our own people.\r\n\r\nThe extremists in this custom are the Botocudos, who represent the most\r\ncruel and ferocious of the Brazilian tribes, and who especially cherish\r\na love for cannibalism. They have a fondness for disfiguring themselves\r\nby inserting in the lower parts of their ears and in their under lips\r\nvariously shaped pieces of wood ornaments called peleles, causing\r\nenormous protrusion of the under lip and a repulsive wide mouth, as\r\nshown in Figure 230.\r\n\r\nTattooing is a peculiar custom originating in various ways. The\r\nmaterials used are vermilion, indigo, carbon, or gunpowder. At one time\r\nthis custom was used in the East to indicate caste and citizenship.\r\nBoth sexes of the Sandwich Islanders have a peculiar tattooed mark\r\nindicative of their tribe or district. Among the Uapes, one tribe, the\r\nTucanoes, have three vertical blue lines.  Among other people tattooed\r\nmarks indicated servility, and Boyle says the Kyans, Pakatans, and\r\nKermowits alone, among the Borneo people, practised tattooing, and adds\r\nthat these races are the least esteemed for bravery. Of the Fijians the\r\nwomen alone are tattooed, possibly as a method of adornment.\r\n\r\nThe tattooing of the people of Otaheite, seen by Cook, was surmised by\r\nhim to have a religious significance, as it presented in many instances\r\n\"squares, circles, crescents, and ill-designed representations of men\r\nand dogs.\" Every one of these people was tattooed upon reaching\r\nmajority. According to Carl Bock, among the Dyaks of Borneo all of the\r\nmarried women were tattooed on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the\r\nthighs. The decoration is one of the privileges of matrimony, and is\r\nnot permitted to unmarried girls. Andrew Lang says of the Australian\r\ntribes that the Wingong or the Totem of each man is indicated by a\r\ntattooed representation of it on his flesh. The celebrated American\r\ntraveler, Carpenter, remarks that on his visit to a great prison in\r\nBurmah, which contains more than 3000 men, he saw 6000 tattooed legs.\r\nThe origin of the custom he was unable to find out, but in Burmah\r\ntattooing was a sign of manhood, and professional tattooers go about\r\nwith books of designs, each design warding off some danger. Bourke\r\nquotes that among the Apaches-Yumas of Arizona the married women are\r\ndistinguished by several blue lines running from the lower lip to the\r\nchin; and he remarks that when a young woman of this tribe is anxious\r\nto become a mother she tattoos the figure of a child on her forehead.\r\nAfter they marry Mojave girls tattoo the chin with vertical blue lines;\r\nand when an Eskimo wife has her face tattooed with lamp-black she is\r\nregarded as a matron in society.  The Polynesians have carried this\r\ndermal art to an extent which is unequaled by any other people, and it\r\nis universally practiced among them. Quoted by Burke, Sullivan states\r\nthat the custom of tattooing continued in England and Ireland down to\r\nthe seventh century. This was the tattooing with the woad. Fletcher\r\nremarks that at one time, about the famous shrine of Our Lady of\r\nLoretto, were seen professional tattooers, who for a small sum of money\r\nwould produce a design commemorative of the pilgrim's visit to the\r\nshrine. A like profitable industry is pursued in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nUniversal tattooing in some of the Eastern countries is used as a means\r\nof criminal punishment, the survival of the persecuted individual being\r\nimmaterial to the torturers, as he would be branded for life and\r\nostracized if he recovered. Illustrative of this O'Connell tells of a\r\ncase in Hebra's clinic. The patient, a man five feet nine inches in\r\nheight, was completely tattooed from head to foot with all sorts of\r\ndevices, such as elephants, birds, lions, etc., and across his\r\nforehead, dragons. Not a square of even a quarter inch had been exempt\r\nfrom the process. According to his tale this man had been a leader of a\r\nband of Greek robbers, organized to invade Chinese Tartary, and,\r\ntogether with an American and a Spaniard, was ordered by the ruler of\r\nthe invaded province to be branded in this manner as a criminal. It\r\ntook three months' continuous work to carry out this sentence, during\r\nwhich his comrades succumbed to the terrible agonies.  During the\r\nentire day for this extended period indigo was pricked in this\r\nunfortunate man's skin. Accounts such as this have been appropriated by\r\nexhibitionists, who have caused themselves to be tattooed merely for\r\nmercenary purposes. The accompanying illustration represents the\r\nappearance of a \"tattooed man\" who exhibited himself. He claimed that\r\nhis tattooing was done by electricity. The design showing on his back\r\nis a copy of a picture of the Virgin Mary surrounded by 31 angels.\r\n\r\nThe custom of tattooing the arms, chest, or back is quite prevalent,\r\nand particularly among sailors and soldiers. The sequences of this\r\ncustom are sometimes quite serious. Syphilis has been frequently\r\ncontracted in this manner, and Maury and Dulles have collected 15 cases\r\nof syphilis acquired in tattooing.  Cheinisse reports the case of a\r\nyoung blacksmith who had the emblems of his trade tattooed upon his\r\nright forearm. At the end of forty days small, red, scaly elevations\r\nappeared at five different points in the tattooed area. These broke\r\ndown and formed ulcers. When examined these ulcers presented the\r\npeculiarities of chancres, and there was upon the body of the patient a\r\nwell-marked syphilitic roseola. It was ascertained that during the\r\ntattooing the operator had moistened the ink with his own saliva.\r\n\r\nHutchinson exhibited drawings and photographs showing the condition of\r\nthe arms of two boys suffering from tuberculosis of the skin, who had\r\nbeen inoculated in the process of tattooing.  The tattooing was done by\r\nthe brother of one of the lads who was in the last stages of phthisis,\r\nand who used his own saliva to mix the pigment. The cases were under\r\nthe care of Murray of Tottenham, by whom they had been previously\r\nreported. Williams has reported the case of a militiamen of seventeen\r\nwho, three days after an extensive tattooing of the left forearm,\r\ncomplained of pain, swelling, and tenderness of the left wrist. A day\r\nlater acute left-sided pneumonia developed, but rapidly subsided. The\r\nleft shoulder, knee, and ankle were successively involved in the\r\ninflammation, and a cardiac bruit developed. Finally chorea developed\r\nas a complication, limited for a time to the left side, but shortly\r\nspreading to the right, where rheumatic inflammation was attacking the\r\njoints. The last, however, quickly subsided, leaving a general, though\r\nmild chorea and a permanently damaged heart.\r\n\r\nInfibulation of the male and female external genital organs for the\r\nprevention of sexual congress is a very ancient custom. The Romans\r\ninfibulated their singers to prevent coitus, and consequent change in\r\nthe voice, and pursued the same practice with their actors and dancers.\r\nAccording to Celsus, Mercurialis, and others, the gladiators were\r\ninfibulated to guard against the loss of vigor by sexual excesses. In\r\nan old Italian work there is a figure of an infibulated musician--a\r\nlittle bronze statue representing a lean individual tortured or\r\ndeformed by carrying an enormous ring through the end of the penis. In\r\none of his pleasantries Martial says of these infibulated singers that\r\nthey sometimes break their rings and fail to place them back--\"et cujus\r\nrefibulavit turgidum faber peruem.\" Heinsius considers Agamemnon\r\ncautious when he left Demodocus near Clytemnestra, as he remarks that\r\nDemodocus was infibulated. For such purposes as the foregoing\r\ninfibulation offered a more humane method than castration.\r\n\r\nInfibulation by a ring in the prepuce was used to prevent premature\r\ncopulation, and was in time to be removed, but in some cases its\r\nfunction was the preservation of perpetual chastity.  Among some of the\r\nreligious mendicants in India there were some who were condemned to a\r\nlife of chastity, and, in the hotter climates, where nudity was the\r\ncustom, these persons traveled about exposing an enormous preputial\r\nring, which was looked upon with adoration by devout women. It is said\r\nthese holy persons were in some places so venerated that people came on\r\ntheir knees, and bowing below the ring, asked forgiveness--possibly for\r\nsexual excesses.\r\n\r\nRhodius mentions the usage of infibulation in antiquity, and Fabricius\r\nd'Aquapendente remarks that infibulation was usually practiced in\r\nfemales for the preservation of chastity. No Roman maiden was able to\r\npreserve her virginity during participation in the celebrations in the\r\nTemples of Venus, the debauches of Venus and Mars, etc., wherein vice\r\nwas authorized by divine injunction; for this reason the lips of the\r\nvagina were closed by rings of iron, copper, or silver, so joined as to\r\nhinder coitus, but not prevent evacuation. Different sized rings were\r\nused for those of different ages. Although this device provided against\r\nthe coitus, the maiden was not free from the assaults of the Lesbians.\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, in place of infibulation, chastity-girdles were\r\nused, and in the Italian girdles, such as the one exhibited in the\r\nMusee Cluny in Paris, both the anus and vulva were protected by a steel\r\ncovering perforated for the evacuations. In the Orient, particularly in\r\nIndia and Persia, according to old travelers, the labia were sewed\r\ntogether, allowing but a small opening for excretions. Buffon and Brown\r\nmention infibulation in Abyssinia, the parts being separated by a\r\nbistoury at the time of marriage. In Circassia the women were protected\r\nby a copper girdle or a corset of hide and skin which, according to\r\ncustom, only the husband could undo. Peney speaks of infibulation for\r\nthe preservation of chastity, as observed by him in the Soudan. Among\r\nthe Nubians this operation was performed at about the age of eight with\r\ngreat ceremony, and when the time for marriage approached the vulva had\r\nto be opened by incision. Sir Richard Buxton, a distinguished traveler,\r\nalso speaks of infibulation, and, according to him, at the time of the\r\nmarriage ceremony the male tries to prove his manhood by using only\r\nNature's method and weapon to consummate the marriage, but if he failed\r\nhe was allowed artificial aid to effect entrance. Sir Samuel Baker is\r\naccredited in The Lancet with giving an account in Latin text of the\r\nmodus operandi of a practice among the Nubian women of removing the\r\nclitoris and nymphae in the young girl, and abrading the adjacent walls\r\nof the external labia so that they would adhere and leave only a\r\nurethral aperture.\r\n\r\nThis ancient custom of infibulation is occasionally seen at the present\r\nday in civilized countries, and some cases of infibulation from\r\njealousy are on record. There is mentioned, as from the Leicester\r\nAssizes, the trial of George Baggerly for execution of a villainous\r\ndesign on his wife. In jealousy he \"had sewed up her private parts.\"\r\nRecently, before the New York Academy of Medicine, Collier reported a\r\ncase of pregnancy in a woman presenting nympha-infibulation. The\r\npatient sought the physician's advice in the summer of 1894, while\r\nsuffering from uterine disease, and being five weeks pregnant. She was\r\na German woman of twenty-eight, had been married several years, and was\r\nthe mother of several children. Collier examined her and observed two\r\nholes in the nymphae. When he asked her concerning these, she\r\nreluctantly told him that she had been compelled by her husband to wear\r\na lock in this region. Her mother, prior to their marriage, sent her\r\nover to the care of her future husband (he having left Germany some\r\nmonths before). On her arrival he perforated the labia minora, causing\r\nher to be ill several weeks; after she had sufficiently recovered he\r\nput on a padlock, and for many years he had practiced the habit of\r\nlocking her up after each intercourse. Strange to relate, no physician,\r\nexcept Collier, had ever inquired about the openings. In this\r\nconnection the celebrated Harvey mentions a mare with infibulated\r\ngenitals, but these did not prevent successful labor.\r\n\r\nOccasionally infibulation has been used as a means of preventing\r\nmasturbation. De la Fontaine has mentioned this fact, and there is a\r\ncase in this country in which acute dementia from masturbation was\r\ncured by infibulation. In this instance the prepuce was perforated in\r\ntwo opposite places by a trocar, and two pewter sounds (No. 2) were\r\nintroduced into the wounds and twisted like rings. On the eleventh day\r\none of the rings was removed, and a fresh one introduced in a new\r\nplace. A cure was effected in eight weeks. There is recent mention made\r\nof a method of preventing masturbation by a cage fastened over the\r\ngenitals by straps and locks. In cases of children the key was to be\r\nkept by the parents, but in adults to be put in some part of the house\r\nremote from the sleeping apartment, the theory being that the desire\r\nwould leave before the key could be obtained.\r\n\r\nAmong some peoples the urethra was slit up as a means of preventing\r\nconception, making a meatus near the base of the penis. Herodotus\r\nremarks that the women of a certain portion of Egypt stood up while\r\nthey urinated, while the men squatted.  Investigation has shown that\r\nthe women were obliged to stand up on account of elongated nymphae and\r\nlabia, while the men sought a sitting posture on account of the\r\ntermination of the urethra being on the inferior side of the base of\r\nthe penis, artificially formed there in order to prevent conception. In\r\nthe Australian Medical Gazette, May, 1883, there is an account of some\r\nof the methods of the Central Australians of preventing conception. One\r\nwas to make an opening into the male urethra just anterior to the\r\nscrotum, and another was to slit up the entire urethra so far as to\r\nmake but a single canal from the scrotum to the glans penis.  Bourke\r\nquotes Palmer in mentioning that it is a custom to split the urethra of\r\nthe male of the Kalkadoon tribe, near Cloncurry, Queensland, Australia\r\nMayer of Vienna describes an operation of perforation of the penis\r\namong the Malays; and Jagor and Micklucho-Maclay report similar customs\r\namong the Dyaks and other natives of Borneo, Java, and Phillipine\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nCircumcision is a rite of great antiquity. The Bible furnishes frequent\r\nrecords of this subject, and the bas-reliefs on some of the old\r\nEgyptian ruins represent circumcised children. Labat has found traces\r\nof circumcision and excision of nymphae in mummies.  Herodotus remarks\r\nthat the Egyptians practiced circumcision rather as a sanitary measure\r\nthan as a rite. Voltaire stated that the Hebrews borrowed circumcision\r\nfrom the Egyptians; but the Jews claimed that the Phoenicians borrowed\r\nthis rite from the Israelites.\r\n\r\nSpencer and others say that in the early history of the Christian\r\nreligion, St. Paul and his Disciples did not believe in circumcision,\r\nwhile St. Peter and his followers practiced it.  Spencer mentions that\r\nthe Abyssinians take a phallic trophy by circumcision from the enemy's\r\ndead body. In his \"History of Circumcision,\" Remondino says that among\r\nthe modern Berbers it is not unusual for a warrior to exhibit virile\r\nmembers of persons he has slain; he also says that, according to\r\nBergman, the Israelites practiced preputial mutilations; David brought\r\n200 prepuces of the Philistines to Saul. Circumcision is practiced in\r\nnearly every portion of the world, and by various races, sometimes\r\nbeing a civil as well as a religious custom. Its use in surgery is too\r\nwell known to be discussed here. It might be mentioned, however, that\r\nRake of Trinidad, has performed circumcision 16 times, usually for\r\nphimosis due to leprous tuberculation of the prepuce. Circumcision, as\r\npracticed on the clitoris in the female, is mentioned on page 308.\r\n\r\nCeremonial Ovariotomy.--In the writings of Strabonius and Alexander ab\r\nAlexandro, allusion is made to the liberties taken with the bodies of\r\nfemales by the ancient Egyptians and Lydians.  Knott says that ablation\r\nof the ovaries is a time-honored custom in India, and that he had the\r\nopportunity of physically examining some of the women who had been\r\noperated on in early life. At twenty-five he found them strong and\r\nmuscular, their mammary glands wholly undeveloped, and the normal\r\ngrowth of pubic hairs absent. The pubic arch was narrow, and the\r\nvaginal orifice practically obliterated. The menses had never appeared,\r\nand there seemed to be no sexual desire. Micklucho-Maclay found that\r\none of the most primitive of all existing races--the New\r\nHollanders--practiced ovariotomy for the utilitarian purpose of\r\ncreating a supply of prostitutes, without the danger of burdening the\r\npopulation by unnecessary increase. MacGillibray found a native\r\novariotomized female at Cape York who had been subjected to the\r\noperation because, having been born dumb, she would be prevented from\r\nbearing dumb children,--a wise, though primitive, method of preventing\r\nsocial dependents.\r\n\r\nCastration has long been practiced, either for the production of\r\neunuchs, or castrata, through vengeance or jealousy, for excessive\r\ncupidity, as a punishment for crime, in fanaticism, in ignorance, and\r\nas a surgical therapeutic measure (recently, for the relief of\r\nhypertrophied prostate). The custom is essentially Oriental in origin,\r\nand was particularly used in polygamous countries, where the mission of\r\neunuchs was to guard the females of the harem. They were generally\r\nlarge, stout men, and were noted for their vigorous health. The history\r\nof eunuchism is lost in antiquity. The ancient Book of Job speaks of\r\neunuchs, and they were in vogue before the time of Semiramis; the King\r\nof Lydia, Andramytis, is said to have sanctioned castration of both\r\nmale and female for social reasons. Negro eunuchs were common among the\r\nRomans. All the great emperors and conquerors had their eunuchs.\r\nAlexander the Great had his celebrated eunuch, Bagoas, and Nero, his\r\nSporus, etc. Chevers says that the manufacture of eunuchs still takes\r\nplace in the cities of Delhi, Lucknow, and Rajpootana. So skilful are\r\nthe traveling eunuch-makers that their mortality is a small fraction of\r\none per cent. Their method of operation is to encircle the external\r\ngenital organs with a tight ligature, and then sweep them off at one\r\nstroke. He also remarks that those who retain their penises are of but\r\nlittle value or trusted. He divided the Indian eunuchs into three\r\nclasses: those born so, those with a penis but no testicles, and those\r\nminus both testicles and penis. Curran describes the traveling\r\neunuch-makers in Central India, and remarks upon the absence of death\r\nafter the operation, and invites the attention of gynecologists and\r\noperators to the successful, though crude, methods used. Curran says\r\nthat, except those who are degraded by practices of sexual perversions,\r\nthese individuals are vigorous bodily, shrewd, and sagacious, thus\r\nproving the ancient descriptions of them.\r\n\r\nJamieson recites a description of the barbarous methods of making\r\neunuchs in China. The operators follow a trade of eunuch-making, and\r\nkeep it in their families from generation to generation; they receive\r\nthe monetary equivalent of about $8.64 for the operation.  The patient\r\nis grasped in a semi-prone position by an assistant, while two others\r\nhold the legs. After excision the wounded parts are bathed three times\r\nwith a hot decoction of pepper-pods, the wound is covered with paper\r\nsoaked in cold water, and bandages applied. Supported by two men the\r\npatient is kept walking for two or three hours and then tied down. For\r\nthree days he is allowed nothing to drink, and is not allowed to pass\r\nhis urine, the urethra being filled with a pewter plug. It generally\r\ntakes about one hundred days for the wound to heal, and two per cent of\r\nthe cases are fatal. There is nocturnal incontinence of urine for a\r\nlong time after the operation.\r\n\r\nExamples of castration because of excessive cupidity, etc.,--a most\r\nunwarranted operation,--are quite rare and are usually found among\r\necclesiastics. The author of \"Faustin, or le Siecle Philosophique,\"\r\nremarked that there were more than 4000 castrated individuals among the\r\necclesiastics and others of Italy. The virtuous Pope Clement XIV\r\nforbade this practice, and describes it as a terrible abuse; but in\r\nspite of the declaration of the Pope the cities of Italy, for some\r\ntime, still continued to contain great numbers of these victims. In\r\nFrance an article was inserted into the penal code providing severe\r\npunishment for such mutilations. Fortunately castration for the\r\nproduction of \"castrata,\" or tenor singers, has almost fallen into\r\ndisuse.  Among the ancient Egyptians and Persians amputation of the\r\nvirile member was inflicted for certain crimes of the nature of rape.\r\n\r\nCastration as a religious rite has played a considerable role.  With\r\nall their might the Emperors Constantine and Justinian opposed the\r\ndelirious religion of the priests of Cybele, and rendered their offence\r\nequivalent to homicide. At the annual festivals of the Phrygian Goddess\r\nAmma (Agdistis) it was the custom of young men to make eunuchs of\r\nthemselves with sharp shells, and a similar rite was recorded among\r\nPhoenicians.  Brinton names severe self-mutilators of this nature among\r\nthe ancient Mexican priests. Some of the Hottentots and indigenous\r\nAustralians enforced semicastration about the age of eight or nine.\r\n\r\nThe Skoptzies, religious castrators in Russia, are possibly the most\r\nfamous of the people of this description. The Russian government has\r\ncondemned members of this heresy to hard labor in Siberia, but has been\r\nunable to extinguish the sect. Pelikan, Privy Counsel of the\r\ngovernment, has exhaustively considered this subject. Articles have\r\nappeared in Le Progres Medical, December.  1876. and there is an\r\naccount in the St. Louis Clinical Record, 1877-78. The name Skoptzy\r\nmeans \"the castrated,\" and they call themselves the \"White Doves.\" They\r\narose about 1757 from the Khlish or flagellants. Paul I caused\r\nSseliwanow, the true founder, to return from Siberia, and after seeing\r\nhim had him confined in an insane asylum. After an interview, Alexander\r\nI transferred him to a hospital. Later the Councillor of State,\r\nJelansky, converted by Sseliwanow, set the man free and soon the\r\nSkoptzies were all through Russia and even at the Court. The principal\r\nargument of these people is the nonconformity of orthodox believers,\r\nespecially the priests, to the doctrines professed, and they contrast\r\nthe lax morals of these persons with the chaste lives, the abstinence\r\nfrom liquor, and the continual fasts of the \"White Doves.\" For the\r\npurpose of convincing novices of the Scriptural foundation of their\r\nrites and belief they are referred to Matthew xix., 12: \"and there be\r\neunuchs which have made themselves for the kingdom of Heaven's sake,\"\r\netc.; and Mark ix., 43-47; Luke xxiii., 29: \"blessed are the barren,\"\r\netc., and others of this nature. As to the operation itself, pain is\r\nrepresented as voluntary martyrdom, and persecution as the struggle of\r\nthe spirit of darkness with that of light. They got persons to join the\r\norder by monetary offers. Another method was to take into service young\r\nboys, who soon became lost to society, and lied with effrontery and\r\nobstinacy. They had secret methods of communicating with one another,\r\nand exhibited a passion for riches, a fact that possibly accounts for\r\ntheir extended influence. The most perfect were those \"worthy of\r\nmounting the white horse,\" the \"bearers of the Imperial seal,\" who were\r\ndeprived of the testicles, penis, and scrotum. The operation of\r\ncastration among these people was performed at one stroke or at two\r\ndifferent times, in the former case one cicatrix being left, and in the\r\nlatter two. The greater number--those who had submitted to the \"first\r\npurification,\" conferring upon them the \"lesser seal\"--had lost\r\ntesticles and scrotum. These people are said to have lost the \"keys of\r\nhell,\" but to retain the \"key of the abyss\" (female genitals). As\r\ninstruments of excision the hot iron, pieces of glass, old wire,\r\nsharpened bone, and old razors are used. Only nine fatal cases\r\nresulting from the operation are known. At St. Petersburg Liprandi knew\r\na rich Skoptzy who constantly kept girls--mostly Germans--for his own\r\ngratification, soon after having entered into the \"first purification.\"\r\nFew of them were able to remain with him over a year, and they always\r\nreturned to their homes with health irretrievably lost. Women members\r\nof the order do not have their ovaries removed, but mutilation is\r\npracticed upon the external genitals, the mammae, and nipples. The\r\nfirst ablation is obtained by applying fire or caustics to the nipples,\r\nthe second by amputation of the breasts, one or both, the third by\r\ndiverse gashes, chiefly across the breast, and the fourth by resection\r\nof the nymphae or of the nymphae and clitoris, and the superior major\r\nlabia, the cicatrices of which would deform the vulva. Figure 232\r\nrepresents the appearance of the external genital organs of a male\r\nSkoptzy after mutilation; Figure 233 those of a female.\r\n\r\nBattey speaks of Skoptzies in Roumania who numbered at the time of\r\nreport 533 persons. They came from Russia and practiced the same\r\nceremonies as the heretics there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nANOMALOUS TYPES AND INSTANCES OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nTumors.--In discussing tumors and similar growths no attempt will be\r\nmade to describe in detail the various types. Only the anomalous\r\ninstances or examples, curious for their size and extent of\r\ninvolvement, will be mentioned. It would be a difficult matter to\r\ndecide which was the largest tumor ever reported. In reviewing\r\nliterature so many enormous growths are recorded that but few can be\r\ngiven here. Some of the large cystic formations have already been\r\nmentioned; these are among the largest tumors.  Scrotal tumors are\r\nrecorded that weighed over 200 pounds; and a limb affected with\r\nelephantiasis may attain an astonishing size.  Delamater is accredited\r\nwith a report of a tumor that weighed 275 pounds, the patient only\r\nweighing 100 pounds at death. Benign tumors will be considered first.\r\n\r\nPure adenoma of the breast is a rare growth. Gross was able to collect\r\nbut 18 examples; but closely allied to this condition is what is known\r\nas diffuse hypertrophy of the breast. In some parts of the world,\r\nparticularly in India and Africa, long, dependent breasts are signs of\r\nbeauty. On the other hand we learn from Juvenal and Martial that, like\r\nourselves, the Greeks detested pendant and bulky breasts, the signs of\r\nbeauty being elevation, smallness, and regularity of contour. In the\r\nGrecian images of Venus the breasts are never pictured as engorged or\r\nenlarged. The celebrated traveler Chardin says that the Circassian and\r\nGeorgian women have the most beautiful breasts in the world; in fact\r\nthe Georgians are so jealous of the regular contour and wide interval\r\nof separation of their breasts that they refuse to nourish their\r\nchildren in the natural manner.\r\n\r\nThe amount of hypertrophy which is sometimes seen in the mammae is\r\nextraordinary. Borellus remarks that he knew of a woman of ordinary\r\nsize, each of whose mammae weighed about 30 pounds, and she supported\r\nthem in bags hung about her neck. Durston reports a case of sudden\r\nonset of hypertrophy of the breast causing death.  At the postmortem it\r\nwas found that the left breast weighed 64 pounds and the right 40\r\npounds. Boyer successfully removed two breasts at an interval of\r\ntwenty-six days between the two operations. The mass excised was\r\none-third of the total body-weight.\r\n\r\nSchaeffer speaks of hypertrophied mammae in a girl of fourteen, the\r\nright breast weighing 3900 grams (136 1/2 oz.) and the right 3500 grams\r\n(122 1/2 oz.). Hamilton reports a case of hypertrophied glands in a\r\nwoman of thirty-two, which, within the short space of a year, reached\r\nthe combined weight of 52 pounds.  They were successfully excised.\r\nVelpeau, Billroth, and Labarracque have reported instances of the\r\nremoval of enormously hypertrophied mammae. In 1886 Speth of Munich\r\ndescribed a hypertrophy of the right breast which increased after every\r\npregnancy. At the age of twenty-six the woman had been five times\r\npregnant in the space of a little over five years, and at this time the\r\nright breast hung down to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. It\r\nweighed 20 pounds, and its greatest circumference was 25 inches. There\r\nwas no milk in this breast, although the left was in perfect lactation.\r\nThis case was one of pure hypertrophy and not an example of\r\nfibro-adenoma, as illustrated by Billroth. Warren figures a case of\r\ndiffused hypertrophy of the breast which was operated on by Porter. The\r\nright breast in its largest circumference measured 38 inches and from\r\nthe chest-wall to the nipple was 17 inches long, the circumference at\r\nthe base being 23 inches; the largest circumference of the left breast\r\nwas 28 inches; its length from the chest-wall to the nipple was 14\r\ninches, and its circumference at the base 23 inches. The skin was\r\nedematous and thickened. Throughout both breasts were to be felt\r\nhardened movable masses, the size of oranges. Microscopic examination\r\nshowed the growth to be a diffused intracanalicular fibroma. A peculiar\r\ncase was presented before the Faculty at Montpellier. The patient was a\r\nyoung girl of fifteen and a half years. After a cold bath, just as the\r\nmenses were appearing, it was found that the breasts were rapidly\r\nincreasing in size; she was subsequently obliged to leave service on\r\naccount of their increased size, and finally the deformity was so great\r\nas to compel her to keep from the public view. The circumference of the\r\nright breast was 94 cm. and of the left 105 cm.; the pedicle of the\r\nformer measured 67 cm. and of the latter 69 cm.; only the slightest\r\nvestige of a nipple remained. Removal was advocated, as applications of\r\niodin had failed; but she would not consent to operation. For eight\r\nyears the hypertrophy remained constant, but, despite this fact, she\r\nfound a husband. After marriage the breasts diminished, but she was\r\nunable to suckle either of her three children, the breasts becoming\r\nturgid but never lactescent.  The hypertrophy diminished to such a\r\ndegree that, at the age of thirty-two, when again pregnant, the\r\ncircumference of the right breast was only 27 cm. and of the left 33\r\ncm. Even thus reduced the breasts descended almost to the navel. When\r\nthe woman was not pregnant they were still less voluminous and seemed\r\nto consist of an immense mass of wrinkled, flaccid skin, traversed by\r\nenormous dilated and varicose blood-vessels, the mammary glands\r\nthemselves being almost entirely absent.\r\n\r\nDiffuse hypertrophy of the breast is occasionally seen in the male\r\nsubject. In one case reported from the Westminster Hospital in London,\r\na man of sixty, after a violent fall on the chest, suffered enormous\r\nenlargement of the mammae, and afterward atrophy of the testicle and\r\nloss of sexual desire.\r\n\r\nThe names goiter, struma, and bronchocele are applied indiscriminately\r\nto all tumors of the thyroid gland; there are, however, several\r\ndistinct varieties among them that are true adenoma, which, therefore,\r\ndeserves a place here. According to Warren, Wolfler gives the following\r\nclassification of thyroid tumors: 1. Hypertrophy of the thyroid gland,\r\nwhich is a comparatively rare disease; 2. Fetal adenoma, which is a\r\nformation of gland tissue from the remains of fetal structures in the\r\ngland; 3. Gelatinous or interacinous adenoma, which consists in an\r\nenlargement of the acini by an accumulation of colloid material, and an\r\nincrease in the interacinous tissue by a growth of round cells. It is\r\nthis latter form in which cysts are frequently found. The accompanying\r\nillustration pictures an extreme ease of cystic goiter shown by Warren.\r\nA strange feature of tumors of the thyroid is that pressure-atrophy and\r\nflattening of the trachea do not take place in proportion to the size\r\nof the tumor. A small tumor of the middle lobe of the gland, not larger\r\nthat a hen's egg, will do more damage to the trachea than will a large\r\ntumor, such as that shown by Senn, after Bruns. When a tumor has\r\nattained this size, pressure-symptoms are often relieved by the weight\r\nof the tumor making traction away from the trachea. Goiter is endemic\r\nin some countries, particularly in Switzerland and Austria, and appears\r\nparticularly at the age of childhood or of puberty. Some communities in\r\nthis country using water containing an excess of calcium salt show\r\ndistinct evidences of endemic goiter. Extirpation of the thyroid gland\r\nhas in recent years been successfully practiced. Warren has extirpated\r\none lobe of the thyroid after preliminary ligation of the common\r\ncarotid on the same side. Green practiced rapid removal of the tumor\r\nand ligated the bleeding vessels later. Rose tied each vessel before\r\ncutting, proceeding slowly. Senn remarks that in 1878 he witnessed one\r\nof Rose's operations which lasted for four hours. Although the operatic\r\ntechnic of removal of the thyroid gland for tumor has been greatly\r\nperfected by Billroth, Lucke, Julliard, Reverdin, Socin, Kocher, and\r\nothers, the current opinion at the present day seems to be that\r\ncomplete extirpation of the thyroid gland, except for malignant\r\ndisease, is unjustifiable. Partial extirpation of the thyroid gland is\r\nstill practiced; and Wolfler has revived the operation of ligating the\r\nthyroid arteries in the treatment of tumors of the thyroid gland.\r\n\r\nFibromata.--One of the commonest seats of fibroma is the skin.\r\nMultiple fibromata of the skin sometimes occur in enormous numbers and\r\ncover the whole surface of the body; they are often accompanied by\r\npendulous tumors of enormous size. Virchow called such tumors fibroma\r\nmolluscum. Figure 237 represents a case of multiple fibromata of the\r\nskin shown by Octerlony. Pode mentions a somewhat similar case in a man\r\nof fifty-six, under the care of Thom. The man was pale and emaciated,\r\nwith anxious expression, complaining of a tumor which he described as a\r\n\"wishing-mark.\" On examination he was found to be covered with a number\r\nof small tumors, ranging in size from that of a small orange to that of\r\na pin's head; from the thoracic wall over the lower true ribs of the\r\nright side was situated a large pendulous tumor, which hung down as far\r\nas the upper third of the thigh. He said that it had always been as\r\nlong as this, but had lately become thicker, and two months previously\r\nthe skin over the lower part of the tumor had ulcerated. This large\r\ntumor was successfully removed; it consisted of fibrous tissue, with\r\nlarge veins running in its substance. The excised mass weighed 51\r\npounds. The patient made an early recovery.\r\n\r\nKeloids are fibromata of the true skin, which may develop spontaneously\r\nor in a scar. Although the distinction of true and false keloid has\r\nbeen made, it is generally discarded. According to Hebra a true typical\r\nkeloid is found once in every 2000 cases of skin-disease. It is,\r\nhowever, particularly the false keloid, or keloid arising from\r\ncicatrices, with which we have mostly to deal. This tumor may arise\r\nfrom a scar in any portion of the body, and at any age. There seems to\r\nbe a disposition in certain families and individuals to\r\nkeloid-formations, and among negroes keloids are quite common, and\r\noften of remarkable size and conformation. The form of injury causing\r\nthe cicatrix is no factor in the production of keloid, the sting of an\r\ninsect, the prick of a needle, and even the wearing of ear-rings having\r\nbeen frequent causes of keloid-formations among the negro race.\r\nCollins describes a negress of ninety, born of African parents, who\r\nexhibited multiple keloids produced by diverse injuries. At fourteen\r\nshe was burned over her breasts by running against a shovelful of hot\r\ncoals, and several months later small tumors appeared, which never\r\nsuppurated. When a young girl a tumor was removed from the front of her\r\nneck by operation, and cicatricial tumors then spread like a band\r\nencircling one-half her neck.  There were keloids over her scapulae,\r\nwhich followed the application of blisters. On her back, over, and\r\nfollowing the direction of the ribs, were growths attributed to the\r\nwounds caused by a flogging. This case was quite remarkable for the\r\npredisposition shown to keloid at an early age, and the variety of\r\nfactors in causation.\r\n\r\nAbout 1867 Duhring had under his observation at the Philadelphia\r\nHospital a negro whose neck was encircled by enormous keloids, which,\r\nalthough black, otherwise resembled tomatoes. A photograph of this\r\nremarkable case was published in Philadelphia in 1870.\r\n\r\nA lipoma is a tumor consisting of adipose tissue. When there is much\r\nfibrous tissue in the tumor it is much firmer, and is known as a\r\nfibro-lipoma. Brander describes a young native of Manchuria, North\r\nChina, from whom he removed a fibro-lipoma weighing 50 pounds. The\r\ngrowth had progressively enlarged for eleven years, and at the time of\r\nextirpation hung as an enormous mass from beneath the left scapula. In\r\noperating the tumor had to be swung on a beam. The hemorrhage was\r\nslight and the patient was discharged in five days.\r\n\r\nThe true lipoma must be distinguished from diffuse accumulations of fat\r\nin different parts of the body in the same way that fibroma is\r\ndistinguished from elephantiasis. Circumscribed lipoma appears as a\r\nlobulated soft tumor, more or less movable, lying beneath the skin. It\r\nsometimes reaches enormous size and assumes the shape of a pendulous\r\ntumor.\r\n\r\nDiffuse lipoma, occurring in the neck, often gives the patient a\r\ngrotesque and peculiar appearance. It is generally found in men\r\naddicted to the use of alcohol, and occurs between thirty-five and\r\nforty-five years of age; in no case has general obesity been described.\r\nIn one of Madelung's cases a large lobe extended downward over the\r\nclavicle. The growth has been found between the larynx and the pharynx.\r\nBlack reports a remarkable case of fatty tumor in a child one year and\r\nfive months old which filled the whole abdominal cavity, weighing nine\r\npounds and two ounces.  Chipault mentions a case of lipoma of the\r\nparietal region, observed by Rotter. This monstrous growth was three\r\nfeet three inches long, descending to the knees. It had its origin in\r\nthe left parietal region, and was covered by the skin of the whole left\r\nside of the face and forehead. The left ear was plainly visible in the\r\nupper third of the growth.\r\n\r\nChondroma, or enchondroma, is a cartilaginous tumor occurring\r\nprincipally where cartilage is normally found, but sometimes in regions\r\ncontaining no cartilage. Enchondroma may be composed of osteoid tissue,\r\nsuch as is found in the ossifying callous between the bone and the\r\nperiosteum, and, according to Virchow, then takes the name of\r\nosteochondroma. Virchow has divided chondromata into two forms--those\r\nwhich he calls ecchondromata, which grow from cartilage, and those that\r\ngrow independently from cartilage, or the enchondromata, which latter\r\nare in the great majority.  Enchondroma is often found on the long\r\nbones, and very frequently upon the bones of the hands or on the\r\nmetatarsal bones.\r\n\r\nFigure 244 represents an enchondroma of the thumb. Multiple\r\nenchondromata are most peculiar, and may attain enormous sizes.\r\nWhittaker describes a farmer of forty who exhibited peculiar tumors of\r\nthe fingers, which he calls multiple osteoecchondromata. His family\r\nhistory was negative. He stated that at an early age he received a\r\nstroke of lightning, which rendered him unconscious for some time. He\r\nknows of nothing else that could be in possible relation with his\r\npresent condition.  Nine months after this accident there was noticed\r\nan enlargement of the middle joint of the little finger, and about the\r\nsame time an enlargement on the middle finger. Gradually all the joints\r\nof the right hand became involved. The enlargement increased so that at\r\nthe age of twelve they were of the size of walnuts, and at this time\r\nthe patient began to notice the same process developing in the left\r\nhand. The growths continued to develop, new nodules appearing, until\r\nthe fingers presented the appearance of nodulated potatoes.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent of the fibro-cartilaginous tumors is the\r\n\"mixed cartilaginous\" tumor of Paget, which grows in the interstitial\r\ntissues of the parotid gland, and sometimes attains enormous size.\r\nMatas presented the photograph of a negress having an enormous fibroma\r\ngrowing from the left parotid region; and there is a photograph of a\r\nsimilar case in the Mutter Museum of the College of Physicians,\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThe hyaline enchondroma is of slow growth, but may at times assume\r\nimmense proportions, as is shown in the accompanying illustration,\r\ngiven by Warren, of a patient in whom the growth was in the scapula.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 there is quoted the description of a peculiar growth which,\r\nthough not definitely described, may be spoken of here. It was an\r\nenormous encysted tumor, springing from the clavicle of a Veronese\r\nnobleman. Contrary to general expectations it was successfully removed\r\nby Portalupi, a surgeon of Venice. It weighed 57 pounds, being 20 1/2\r\ninches long and 30 inches in circumference. It is said this tumor\r\nfollowed the reception of a wound.\r\n\r\nAmong the benign bone tumors are exostoses--homologous outgrowths\r\ndiffering from hypertrophies, as they only involve a limited part of\r\nthe circumference. When developmental, originating in childhood, the\r\noutgrowths may be found on any part of the skeleton, and upon many and\r\ngenerally symmetric parts at the same time, as is shown in Figure 248.\r\n\r\nBarwell had a case of a girl with 38 exostoses. Erichsen mentions a\r\nyoung man of twenty-one with 15 groups of symmetric exostoses in\r\nvarious portions of the body; they were spongy or cancellous in nature.\r\n\r\nHartmann shows two cases of multiple exostoses, both in males, and\r\nuniversally distributed over the body.\r\n\r\nMacland of the French navy describes an affection of the bones of the\r\nface known as anakhre or goundron (gros-nez). It is so common that\r\nabout one per cent of the natives of certain villages on the Ivory\r\nCoast, West Africa, are subject to it. As a rule the earliest symptoms\r\nin childhood are: more or less persistent headache, particularly\r\nfrontal, sanguineous and purulent discharge from the nostrils, and the\r\nformation of symmetric swellings the size of an almond in the region of\r\nthe nasal processes of the superior maxilla. The cartilage does not\r\nseem to be involved, and, although it is not so stated, the nasal duct\r\nappears to remain intact.\r\n\r\nThe headache and discharge continue for a year, and the swelling\r\ncontinually increases through life, although the symptoms gradually\r\ndisappear, the skin not becoming involved, and no pain being present.\r\nIt has been noticed in young chimpanzees. The illustration represents a\r\nman of forty who suffered from the disease since puberty. Pressure on\r\nthe eyeball had started and the native said he expected that in two\r\nyears he would lose his sight. Figure 251 shows an analogous condition,\r\ncalled by Hutchinson symmetric osteomata of the nasal processes of the\r\nmaxilla. His patient was a native of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAmong neuromata, multiple neurofibroma is of considerable interest,\r\nchiefly for the extent of general involvement.  According to Senn,\r\nHeusinger records the case of a sailor of twenty-three in whom all the\r\nnerves were affected by numerous nodular enlargements. Not a nerve in\r\nthe entire body was found normal. The enlargement was caused by\r\nincrease in the connective tissue, the axis-cylinders being normal. In\r\nthis case there was neither pain nor tenderness.\r\n\r\nPrudden reports the case of a girl of twenty-five who, during\r\nconvalescence from variola, became paraplegic, and during this time\r\nmultiple neuromata appeared. At the postmortem more than a thousand\r\ntumors were found affecting not only the peripheral branches and the\r\nsympathetic, but also the cranial nerves and the pneumogastric. Under\r\nthe microscope these tumors showed an increase in the interfascicular\r\nas well as perivascular fibers, but the nerve-fibers were not increased\r\nin size or number.  Virchow collected 30 cases of multiple\r\nneurofibromata. In one case he found 500, in another from 800 to 1000\r\ntumors.\r\n\r\nPlexiform neuroma is always congenital, and is found most frequently in\r\nthe temporal region, the neck, and the sides of the face, but almost\r\nany part of the body may be affected. Christot reports two cases in\r\nwhich the tumors were located upon the cheek and the neck. Czerny\r\nobserved a case in which the tumor involved the lumbar plexus. Quoted\r\nby Senn, Campbell de Morgan met with a plexiform neuroma of the\r\nmusculo-spiral nerve and its branches.  The patient was a young lady,\r\nand the tumor, which was not painful, had undergone myxomatous\r\ndegeneration.\r\n\r\nNeuroma of the vulva is a pathologic curiosity. Simpson reports a case\r\nin which the tumor was a painful nodule situated near the urinary\r\nmeatus. Kennedy mentions an instance in which the tumor appeared as\r\nextremely tender tubercles.\r\n\r\nTietze describes a woman of twenty-seven who exhibited a marked type of\r\nplexiform neurofibroma. The growth was simply excised and recovery was\r\npromptly effected.\r\n\r\nCarcinomatous growths, if left to themselves, make formidable\r\ndevastations of the parts which they affect. Warren pictures a case of\r\nnoli-me-tangere, a destructive type of epithelial carcinoma. The\r\npatient suffered no enlargement of the lymphatic glands. The same\r\nabsence of glandular involvement was observed in another individual, in\r\nwhom there was extensive ulceration. The disease had in this case\r\noriginated in the scar of a gunshot wound received during the Civil\r\nWar, and had destroyed the side of the nose, the eye, the ear, the\r\ncheek, including the corresponding half of the upper and lower lips.\r\n\r\nHarlan reports a most extraordinary epithelioma of the orbit in a boy\r\nof about five years. It followed enucleation, and attained the size\r\ndepicted in a few months.\r\n\r\nSarcomata, if allowed full progress, may attain great size. Plate 10\r\nshows an enormous sarcoma of the buttocks in an adult negro.  Fascial\r\nsarcomata are often seen of immense size. Senn shows a tumor of this\r\nvariety which was situated between the scapulae.\r\n\r\nSchwimmer records a curious case of universal small sarcomata over the\r\nwhole body of a teacher of the age of twenty-one, in the Hungarian\r\nlowlands. The author called the disease sarcomata pigmentosum diffusum\r\nmultiplex.\r\n\r\nThe bones are a common seat of sarcomatous growths, the tumor in this\r\ninstance being called osteosarcoma. It may affect any bone, but rarely\r\ninvolves an articulation; at times it skips the joint and goes to the\r\nneighboring bone.\r\n\r\nA case of nasal sarcoma is shown by Moore. The tumor was located in the\r\nnasal septum, and caused a frightful deformity. In this case pain was\r\nabsent, the sense of smell was lost, and the sight of the right eye\r\nimpaired. Moore attempted to remove the tumor, but in consequence of\r\nsome interference of respiration the patient died on the table.\r\n\r\nTiffany reports several interesting instances of sarcoma, one in a\r\nwhite female of nineteen following a contusion of tibia. The growth had\r\nall the clinical history of an osteosarcoma of the tibia, and was\r\namputated and photographed after removal. In another case, in a white\r\nmale of thirty, the same author successfully performed a hip-amputation\r\nfor a large sarcoma of the left femur. The removed member was sent\r\nentire to the Army Medical Museum at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe fatality and incurability of malignant growths has done much to\r\nstimulate daring and marvelous operations in surgery. The utter\r\nhopelessness of the case justifies almost any means of relief, and many\r\nof the visceral operations, resections of functional organs, and\r\nextraordinary amputations that were never dreamed of in the early\r\nhistory of medicine are to-day not only feasible and justifiable, but\r\neven peremptorily demanded.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins sometimes become so enlarged and distorted as to\r\nsimulate the appearance of one varicose tumor. Adams describes a\r\ncurious case of congenital dilatation of the arteries and veins in the\r\nright lower limb, accompanied by an anastomosis with the interior of\r\nthe os calcis. The affected thigh exceeded the other in size by\r\none-third, all the veins being immensely swelled and distorted. The\r\narteries were also distorted and could be felt pulsating all over the\r\nlimb. The patient died at thirty from rupture of the aneurysm.\r\n\r\nAbbe shows a peculiar aneurysmal varix of the finger in a boy of nine.\r\nWhen a babe the patient had, on the dorsum of the little finger, a\r\nsmall nevus, which was quiescent for many years. He received a deep cut\r\nat the base of the thumb, and immediately after this accident the nevus\r\nbegan to enlarge rapidly. But for the local aneurysmal thrill at the\r\npoint of the scar the condition would have been diagnosed as angioma,\r\nbut as a bruit could be heard over the entire mass it was called an\r\naneurysmal varix, because it was believed there was a connection\r\nbetween a rather large artery and a vein close to the mass. There is a\r\ncurious case reported of cirsoid tumor of the ear of a boy of thirteen.\r\nFigure 259 shows the appearance before and after operation.\r\n\r\nJessop records a remarkable case of multiple aneurysm. This case was\r\nparticularly interesting as it was accompanied by a postmortem\r\nexamination. Pye-Smith reports an extremely interesting case in which\r\ndeath occurred from traumatic aneurysm of an aberrant subclavian\r\nartery. The patient fell from a height of 28 feet, lost consciousness\r\nfor a few minutes, but soon recovered it. There was no evidence of any\r\nfracture, but the man suffered greatly from dyspnea, pain between the\r\nshoulders, and collapse. The breath-sounds on auscultation and the\r\ndifficulty in swallowing led to the belief that one of the bronchi was\r\nblocked by the pressure of a hematoma. Dyspnea continued to increase,\r\nand eighteen days after admission the man was in great distress, very\r\nlittle air entering the chest. He had no pulse at the right wrist, and\r\nPye-Smith was unable to feel either the temporal or carotid beats on\r\nthe right side, although these vessels were felt pulsating on the left\r\nside. Laryngotomy was done with the hope of removing a foreign body,\r\nbut the man died on the tenth day. A postmortem examination disclosed\r\nthe existence of an aberrant right subclavian artery in the posterior\r\nmediastinum, and this was the seat of a traumatic aneurysm that had\r\nruptured into the esophagus.\r\n\r\nRelative to the size of an aneurysm, Warren reported a case of the\r\nabdominal aorta which commenced at the origin of the celiac axis and\r\npassed on to the surfaces of the psoas and iliac muscles, descending to\r\nthe middle of the thigh The total length of the aneurysm was 19 inches,\r\nand it measured 18 inches in circumference.\r\n\r\nA peculiar sequence of an aortic aneurysm is perforation of the sternum\r\nor rib. Webb mentions an Irish woman who died of aneurysm of the aorta,\r\nwhich had perforated the sternum, the orifice being plugged by a large\r\nclot. He quotes 17 similar cases which he has collected as occurring\r\nfrom 1749 to 1874, and notes that one of the patients lived seven weeks\r\nafter the rupture of the aneurysmal sac.\r\n\r\nLarge Uterine Tumors.--Before the meeting of the American Medical\r\nAssociation held in Washington, D.C., 1891, McIntyre a reported a case\r\nof great interest. The patient, a woman of thirty-eight, five feet 5\r\n1/2 inches in height, coarse, with masculine features, having hair on\r\nher upper lip and chin, and weighing 199 1/2 pounds, was found in a\r\npoor-house in Trenton, Missouri, on November 26, 1890, suffering from a\r\ncolossal growth of the abdomen. The accompanying illustration is from a\r\nphotograph which was taken at the time of the first interview. The\r\nmeasurements made at the time were as follows: circumference at the\r\nlargest part, just below the umbilicus, 50 inches; circumference just\r\nbelow the mammae, 35 inches; from the xiphoid cartilage to the\r\nsymphysis pubis, 32 inches, not including the appendum, which is shown\r\nin the picture. Percussion suggested a fluid within a sac.  The uterus\r\nwas drawn up to the extent of from 12 to 14 inches.  The woman walked\r\nwith great difficulty and with a waddling gait, bending far backward\r\nthe better to keep \"the center of gravity within the base,\" and to\r\nenable her to sustain the enormous weight of the abdomen. She was\r\ncompelled to pass her urine while standing. Attempts had been made six\r\nand two years before to tap this woman, but only a few drops of blood\r\nfollowed several thrusts of a large trocar. A diagnosis was made of\r\nmultilocular ovarian cyst or edematous myoma of the uterus, and on the\r\nmorning of December 7, 1890, an operation was performed. An incision 14\r\ninches in length was first made in the linea alba, below the umbilicus,\r\nand afterward extended up to the xiphoid cartilage.  The hemorrhage\r\nfrom the abdominal wall was very free, and the enormously distended\r\nvessels required the application of a large number of pressure-forceps.\r\nAdhesions were found almost everywhere the most difficult to manage\r\nbeing those of the liver and diaphragm. The broad ligaments and\r\nFallopian tubes were ligated on either side, the tumor turned out, the\r\nthick, heavy pedicle transfixed and ligated, and the enormous growth\r\ncut away.  After operation the woman was immediately placed on platform\r\nscales, and it was found that she had lost 93 1/2 pounds.\r\nUnfortunately the patient developed symptoms of septicemia and died on\r\nthe fifth day. In looking over the literature on this subject McIntyre\r\nfound no mention of any solid tumor of this size having been removed.\r\nOn April 18, 1881, Keith, late of Edinburgh, now of London,\r\nsuccessfully removed an edematous myoma, together with the uterus,\r\nwhich was 42 pounds in weight. In a recent work Tait remarks that the\r\nlargest uterine myoma which he ever removed weighed 68 pounds, and adds\r\nthat it grew after the menopause.  McIntyre believes that his tumor,\r\nweighing 93 1/2 pounds, is the largest yet reported. Eastman reports\r\nthe removal of a fibroid tumor of the uterus weighing 60 pounds. The\r\npatient recovered from the operation.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible for a fibrocyst of the uterus to attain an\r\nenormous size, equaling the ovarian cysts. Stockard describes an\r\ninstance of this nature in a negress of fifty, the mother of several\r\nchildren. About twelve years before a cyst in the right iliac region\r\nwas tapped. The woman presented the following appearance: The navel\r\nhung below her knees, and the skin near the umbilicus resembled that of\r\nan elephant. The abdomen in its largest circumference measured 68\r\ninches, and 27 inches from the ensiform cartilage to the umbilicus. The\r\numbilicus was five inches in diameter and three inches in length. Eight\r\ngallons and seven pints of fluid were removed by tapping, much\r\nremaining. The whole tumor weighed 135 pounds. Death from exhaustion\r\nfollowed on the sixth day after the tapping.\r\n\r\nOvarian cysts, of which by far the greater number are of the glandular\r\nvariety, form extremely large tumors; ovarian dropsies of enormous\r\ndimensions are recorded repeatedly throughout medical literature. Among\r\nthe older writers Ford mentions an instance of ovarian dropsy from\r\nwhich, by repeated operations, 2786 pints of water were drawn.\r\nMartineau describes a remarkable case of twenty-five years' duration,\r\nin which 80 paracenteses were performed and 6630 pints of fluid were\r\nwithdrawn. In one year alone 495 pints were withdrawn. Tozzetti\r\nmentions an ovarian tumor weighing 150 pounds. Morand speaks of an\r\novarian cyst from which, in ten months, 427 pounds of fluid were\r\nwithdrawn. There are old records of tubal cysts weighing over 100\r\npounds. Normand speaks of an ovary degenerating into a scirrhous mass\r\nweighing 55 pounds. Among recent operations Briddon describes the\r\nremoval of an ovarian cyst which weighed 152 pounds, death resulting.\r\nHelmuth mentions an ovarian cyst from which, in 12 tappings, 559 pounds\r\nof fluid were withdrawn. Delivery was effected by instrumental aid. The\r\ntumor of 70 pounds was removed and death followed. McGillicuddy\r\nmentions a case of ovarian cyst containing 132 pounds of fluid. The\r\npatient was a woman of twenty-eight whose abdomen at the umbilicus\r\nmeasured 69 inches in circumference and 47 inches from the sternum to\r\nthe pubes. Before the operation the great tumor hung down as far as the\r\nknees, the abdominal wall chafing the thighs. Figure 263 shows the\r\nappearance of a large ovarian cyst weighing 149 pounds. The emaciation\r\nof the subject is particularly noticeable. Reifsnyder describes a\r\nnative Chinese woman affected with an ovarian tumor seen at the\r\nMargaret Williamson Hospital at Shanghai. She was four feet eight\r\ninches in height, and twenty-five years of age.  The tumor had been\r\ngrowing for six years until the circumference at the umbilicus measured\r\nfive feet 7 3/4 inches; 88 quarts of fluid were drawn off and the woman\r\nrecovered. In the College of Physicians, Philadelphia, there are\r\nphotographs of this case, with an inscription saying that the patient\r\nwas a young Chinese woman who measured but four feet eight inches in\r\nheight, while her girth was increased by an ovarian cyst to five feet 9\r\n1/8 inches. The tumor was removed and weighed 182 1/2 pounds; it\r\ncontained 22 gallons of fluid. Figure 265 shows the appearance of the\r\nwoman two months after the operation, when the girth was reduced to\r\nnormal. Stone performed ovariotomy on a girl of fifteen, removing a\r\ntumor weighing 81 1/2 pounds. Ranney speaks of the successful removal\r\nof a unilocular tumor weighing 95 pounds; and Wall tells of a death\r\nafter removal of an ovarian tumor of the same weight. Rodenstein\r\nportrays the appearance of a patient of forty-five after death from an\r\nenormous glandular ovarian cystoma. The tumor was three feet high,\r\ncovered the breasts, extended to the knees, and weighed 146 pounds.\r\nKelly speaks of a cyst weighing 116 pounds; Keith one of 89 1/2 pounds;\r\nGregory, 80 pounds; Boerstler, 65 pounds; Bixby, 70 pounds; and Alston\r\na tumor of 70 pounds removed in the second operation of ovariotomy.\r\n\r\nDayot reports the removal of an enormous ovarian cyst from a girl of\r\nseventeen. The tumor had been present three years, but the patient and\r\nher family refused an operation until the size of the tumor alarmed\r\nthem. Its largest circumference was five feet 11 inches. The distance\r\nfrom the xiphoid to the symphysis pubis was three feet. The tumor was\r\ncovered with veins the size of the little finger. The apex of the heart\r\nwas pushed to the 3d interspace and the umbilicus had disappeared.\r\nThere were 65 quarts of a thick, brown fluid in the tumor. The patient\r\nrecovered in twenty-five days.\r\n\r\nCullingworth of St. Thomas Hospital, London, successfully removed from\r\na girl of sixteen an ovarian cyst weighing over 80 pounds.  The patient\r\nwas admitted to the hospital April 30, 1895. She gave a history of a\r\nsingle menstruation, which took place in March or April, 1893, and said\r\nthat in the latter month she noticed that she was growing large. She\r\nwas tapped at Christmas, 1893, when a large quantity of fluid was\r\nremoved, and again in February, 1894, and a third time in May, 1894,\r\nbut without useful results. For the previous six months she had been\r\nalmost entirely bedridden because of the great size of the tumor. There\r\nwere no symptoms referring to the bladder and rectum. At the time she\r\nentered the hospital she was much emaciated, the eyes were sunken, and\r\nher cheeks had a livid hue. The chest was thin and the lower ribs were\r\neverted; dulness began at the lower border of the 3d cartilage, and the\r\napex-beat was best felt in the third space.  Liver-dulness began at the\r\n4th rib cartilage in the nipple line.  The abdomen was enormously\r\ndistended, and covered by large veins running from below upward to the\r\nthorax. About 3 1/2 inches above the umbilicus there was a sulcus with\r\nits convexity downward.  There was dulness over the whole abdomen,\r\nexcept at the sides parallel with the lumbar spines, and a resonant\r\nband over the stomach. The greatest girth was 54 1/2 inches. By vaginal\r\nexamination the cervix was found to be pulled up and obliterated; the\r\nanterior vaginal wall was bulged downward by the tumor. On May 3d\r\nabdominal section was performed. An incision eight inches long was made\r\nin the mid-line of the abdomen. A cystic tumor, formed of small cysts\r\nin its upper part and of somewhat larger ones in the lower part, was\r\nrevealed. It was adherent to the abdominal wall, liver, spleen, and\r\nomentum. The adhesions were separated and the cyst tapped with a large\r\ntrocar, and then the septa between the cysts were broken down with the\r\nfingers. The pedicle was rather small and was tied in the usual way,\r\nand the tumor was removed. Its seat of origin was the left ovary. The\r\nright ovary and the uterus were healthy, but poorly developed.  The\r\ntumor weighed between 80 and 90 pounds,--the patient having weighed 170\r\npounds on the night before the operation and 79 1/2 pounds a week after\r\nthe operation. Alarming symptoms of collapse were present during the\r\nnight after the operation, but the patient responded to stimulation by\r\nhypodermic injections of 1/20 grain of strychnin and of brandy, and\r\nafter the first twenty-four hours the recovery was uninterrupted.\r\nCullingworth thinks that the most interesting points in the case are:\r\nthe age of the patient, the enormous size of the tumor, and the advice\r\ngiven by the surgeon who first attended the patient (insisting that no\r\noperation should be performed). This case shows anew the uselessness of\r\ntapping ovarian cysts.\r\n\r\nIn the records of enormous dropsies much material of interest is to be\r\nfound, and a few of the most interesting cases on record will be cited.\r\nIn the older times, when the knowledge of the etiology and pathology of\r\ndropsies was obscure, we find the records of the most extraordinary\r\ncases. Before the Royal Society, in 1746, Glass of Oxford read the\r\nreport of a case of preternatural size of the abdomen, and stated that\r\nthe dropsy was due to the absence of one kidney. The circumference of\r\nthe abdomen was six feet four inches, and the distance from the xiphoid\r\nto the os pubis measured four feet 1/2 inch. In this remarkable case 30\r\ngallons of fluid were drawn off from the abdomen after death.\r\nBartholinus mentions a dropsy of 120 pounds; and Gockelius one of 180\r\npounds; there is recorded an instance of a dropsy of 149 pounds. There\r\nis an old record of a woman of fifty who had suffered from ascites for\r\nthirty years. She had been punctured 154 times, and each time about 20\r\npints were drawn off. During each of two pregnancies she was punctured\r\nthree or four times; one of her children was still living. It has been\r\nsaid that there was a case in Paris of a person who was punctured 300\r\ntimes for ascites. Scott reports a case of ascites in which 928 pints\r\nof water were drawn off in 24 successive tappings, from February, 1777,\r\nto May, 1778. Quoted by Hufeland, Van Wy mentions 1256 pounds of fluid\r\nbeing drawn from the abdomen of a woman in five years. Kaltschmid\r\ndescribes a case of ascites in which, in 12 paracenteses, 500 pounds of\r\nfluid were removed. In 1721 Morand reported two cases of ascites in one\r\nof which, by the means of 57 paracenteses, 970 pounds of fluid were\r\ndrawn off in twenty-two months. In the other case 1708 pounds of fluid\r\nissued in ten months. There is a record of 484 pounds of \"pus\" being\r\ndischarged during a dropsy.\r\n\r\nThe Philosophical Transactions contain the account of a case of\r\nhydronephrosis in which there were 240 pounds of water in the sac.\r\nThere are several cases on record in which ovarian dropsies have\r\nweighed over 100 pounds; and Blanchard mentions a uterine dropsy of 80\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe Ephemerides contains an account of a case of hydrocephalus in which\r\nthere were 24 pounds of fluid, and similar cases have been noted.\r\n\r\nElliotson reports what he calls the largest quantity of pus from the\r\nliver on record. His patient was a man of thirty-eight, a victim of\r\nhydatid disease of the liver, from whom he withdrew one gallon of\r\noffensive material.\r\n\r\nLieutaud cites a case, reported by Blanchard, in which, in a case of\r\nhydatid disease, the stomach contained 90 pounds of fluid.\r\n\r\nAnkylosis of the articulations, a rare and curious anomaly, has been\r\nseen in the human fetus by Richaud, Joulin, Bird, and Becourt.\r\nAnkylosis of all the joints, with muscular atrophy, gives rise to a\r\ncondition that has been popularly termed \"ossified man.\" A case of this\r\nnature is described, the patient being a raftsman, aged seventeen, who\r\nsuffered with inflammatory symptoms of the right great toe, which were\r\nfollowed in the next ten years by progressive involvement of all the\r\njoints of the extremities, and of the vertebrae and temporo-maxillary\r\narticulations, with accompanying signs of acute articular rheumatism.\r\nAt the age of thirty-one the pains had subsided, leaving him completely\r\ndisabled. All the joints except the fingers and toes had become\r\nankylosed, and from nonusage the muscles had atrophied. There were no\r\ndislocations, anesthesia, or bedsores, and the viscera were normal;\r\nthere were apparently no gouty deposits, as an examination of the urine\r\nwas negative.\r\n\r\nJ. R. Bass, the well-known \"ossified man\" of the dime museums, has been\r\nexamined by many physicians, and was quite intelligent and cheerful in\r\nspite of his complete ankylosis. Figure 269 represents his appearance\r\nin 1887.\r\n\r\nPercy speaks of a man named Simoore, born in 1752, who at the age of\r\nfifteen was afflicted with ankylosis of all the joints, and at\r\ndifferent angles He was unable to move even his jaw, and his teeth had\r\nto be extracted in order to supply him with nourishment. Even his ribs\r\nwere ankylosed; his chest puffed up, and the breathing was entirely\r\nabdominal. In spite of his infirmities, after his pains had ceased he\r\nlived a comparatively comfortable life. His digestion was good, and his\r\nexcretory functions were sufficient. The urine always showed\r\nphosphates, and never the slightest sign of free phosphoric acid. He\r\nstill retained his sexual feeling, and occasionally had erections. This\r\nman died in 1802 at the age of fifty, asphyxia being the precursor of\r\ndeath. His skeleton was deposited in the Museum of the ecole de\r\nMedecine de Paris. In the same Museum there was another similar\r\nskeleton, but in this subject there was motion of the head upon the\r\nfirst vertebra, the lower jaw was intact, and the clavicle, arms, and\r\nsome of the digits of the right hand were movable.\r\n\r\nAn ossified man has been recently found and exhibited to the Paris\r\nAcademy of Medicine. He is a Roumanian Jew of thirty who began to\r\nossify twelve years ago, first up the right side of his back, then down\r\nthe left side. He has hardened now to the nape of the neck, his head is\r\nturned to the left, and the jaws are ankylosed. He can still move his\r\narms and legs a little with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nAkin to the foregoing condition is what is known as petrifaction or\r\nossification of portions of the living human body other than the\r\narticulations. Of the older writers Hellwigius, Horstius, and Schurig\r\nspeak of petrifaction of the arm. In the Philosophical Transactions\r\nthere was a case recorded in which the muscles and ligaments were so\r\nextensively converted into bone that all the joints were fixed, even\r\nincluding the vertebrae, head, and lower jaw. In a short time this man\r\nwas, as it were, one single bone from his head to his knees, the only\r\njoints movable being the right wrist and knee. For over a century there\r\nhas been in the Trinity College at Dublin the skeleton of a man who\r\ndied about 20 miles from the city of Cork. The muscles about the\r\nscapula, and the dorsum of the ilium (the glutei) were converted into\r\ngreat masses of bone, equal to the original muscles in thickness and\r\nbulk. Half of the muscles of the hips and thighs were converted into\r\nbone, and for a long time this specimen was the leading curiosity of\r\nthe Dublin Museum. In the Isle of Man, some years ago, there was a case\r\nof ossification which continued progressively for many years. Before\r\ndeath this man was reduced to almost a solid mass of bony substance.\r\nWith the exception of one or two toes his entire frame was solidified.\r\nHe was buried in Kirk Andreas Churchyard, and his grave was strictly\r\nguarded against medical men by his friends, but the body was finally\r\nsecured and taken to Dublin by Dr. McCartney.\r\n\r\nCalculi.--In reviewing the statistics of vesical calculi, the strangest\r\nanomalies in their size and weight have been noticed.  Among the older\r\nwriters the largest weights have been found. Le Cat speaks of a\r\ncalculus weighing over three pounds, and Morand is accredited with\r\nhaving seen a calculus which weighed six pounds. In his statistics in\r\n1883 Cross collected reports on 704 stones, and remarked that only nine\r\nof these weighed above four ounces, and only two above six, and that\r\nwith the last two the patient succumbed. Of those removed successfully\r\nHarmer of Norwich reports one of 15 ounces; Kline, one of 13 ounces 30\r\ngrains; Mayo of Winchester, 14 ounces two drams; Cheselden, 12 ounces;\r\nand Pare in 1570 removed a calculus weighing nine ounces.  Sir Astley\r\nCooper remarks that the largest stone he ever saw weighed four ounces,\r\nand that the patient died within four hours after its removal. Before\r\nthe Royal Society of London in 1684 Birch reported an account of a\r\ncalculus weighing five ounces.  Fabricius Hildanus mentions calculi\r\nweighing 20 and 21 ounces; Camper, 13 ounces; Foschini, 19 ounces six\r\ndrams; Garmannus, 25 ounces; Greenfield, 19 ounces; Heberden, 32\r\nounces; Wrisberg, 20 ounces; Launai, 51 ounces; Lemery, 27 ounces;\r\nPaget, in Kuhn's Journal, 27 ounces (from a woman); Pauli, 19 ounces;\r\nRudolphi, 28 ounces; Tozzetti, 39 ounces; Threpland, 35 ounces; and\r\nthere is a record of a calculus weighing over six pounds. There is\r\npreserved in Trinity College, Cambridge, a stone weighing 34 ounces\r\ntaken from the bladder of the wife of Thomas Raisin, by Gutteridge, a\r\nsurgeon of Norwich. This stone was afterward sent to King Charles II\r\nfor inspection. In his \"Journey to Paris\" Dr. Lister said that he saw a\r\nstone which weighed 51 ounces; it had been taken from one of the\r\nreligious brothers in June, 1690, and placed in the Hopital de la\r\nCharite. It was said that the monk died after the operation. There is a\r\nrecord of a calculus taken from the bladder of an individual living in\r\nAberdeen. This stone weighed two pounds, three ounces, and six drams.\r\nIn the Hunterian Museum in London there is a stone weighing 44 ounces,\r\nand measuring 16 inches in circumference. By suprapubic operation\r\nDuguise removed a stone weighing 31 ounces from a patient who survived\r\nsix days.  A Belgian surgeon by the name of Uytterhoeven, by the\r\nsuprapubic method extracted a concretion weighing two pounds and\r\nmeasuring 6 1/2 inches long and four wide. Frere Come performed a high\r\noperation on a patient who died the next day after the removal of a\r\n24-ounce calculus. Verduc mentions a calculus weighing three pounds\r\nthree ounces. It was said that a vesical calculus was seen in a dead\r\nboy at St. Edmund's which was as large as the head of a new-born child.\r\nIt has been remarked that Thomas Adams, Lord Mayor of London, who died\r\nat the age of eighty-two, had in his bladder at the time of his death a\r\nstone which filled the whole cavity, and which was grooved from the\r\nureters to the urethral opening, thus allowing the passage of urine.\r\nRecent records of large calculi are offered: by Holmes, 25 ounces;\r\nHunter, 25 ounces; Cayley, 29 ounces; Humphrys, 33 ounces; Eve, 44\r\nounces; and Janeway, 51 ounces. Kirby has collected reports ol a number\r\nof large vesical calculi.\r\n\r\nBarton speaks of stone in the bladder in very young children.  There is\r\na record of a stone at one month, and another at three years. Todd\r\ndescribes a stone in the bladder of a child of sixteen months. May\r\nremoved an enormous stone from a young girl, which had its nucleus in a\r\nbrass penholder over three inches long.\r\n\r\nMultiple Vesical Calculi.--Usually the bladder contains a single\r\ncalculus, but in a few instances a large number of stones have been\r\nfound to coexist. According to Ashhurst, the most remarkable case on\r\nrecord is that of the aged Chief Justice Marshal, from whose bladder\r\nDr. Physick of Philadelphia is said to have successfully removed by\r\nlateral lithotomy more than 1000 calculi.  Macgregor mentions a case in\r\nwhich 520 small calculi coexisted with a large one weighing 51 ounces.\r\nThere is an old record of 32 stones having been removed from a man of\r\neighty-one, a native of Dantzic, 16 of which were as large as a\r\npigeon's egg. Kelly speaks of 228 calculi in the bladder of a man of\r\nseventy-three, 12 being removed before death. The largest weighed 111\r\ngrains.  Goodrich took 96 small stones from the bladder of a lad. Among\r\nthe older records of numerous calculi Burnett mentions 70; Desault,\r\nover 200; the Ephemerides, 120; Weickman, over 100; Fabricius Hildanus,\r\n2000 in two years; and there is a remarkable case of 10,000 in all\r\nissuing from a young girl. Greenhow mentions 60 stones removed from the\r\nbladder. An older issue of The Lancet contains an account of lithotrity\r\nperformed on the same patient 48 times.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the calculi are discharged spontaneously. Trioen mentions\r\nthe issue of a calculus through a perineal aperture, and there are many\r\nsimilar cases on record. There is an old record of a stone weighing\r\nfive ounces being passed by the penis. Schenck mentions a calculus\r\nperforating the bladder and lodging in the groin. Simmons reports a\r\ncase in which a calculus passed through a fistulous sore in the loins\r\nwithout any concomitant passage of urine through the same passage.\r\nVosberg mentions a calculus in a patent urachus; and calculi have\r\noccasionally been known to pass from the umbilicus. Gourges mentions\r\nthe spontaneous excretion of a five-ounce calculus; and Thompson speaks\r\nof the discharge of two calculi of enormous size.\r\n\r\nOf the extravesical calculi some are true calculi, while others are\r\nsimply the result of calcareous or osseous degeneration.  Renal and\r\nbiliary calculi are too common to need mention here.  There are some\r\nextraordinary calculi taken from a patient at St.  Bartholomew's\r\nHospital and deposited in the museum of that institution. The patient\r\nwas a man of thirty-eight. In the right kidney were found a calculus\r\nweighing 36 1/2 ounces, about 1000 small calculi, and a quantity of\r\ncalcareous dust. In the left kidney there was a calculus weighing 9 3/4\r\nounces, besides a quantity of calcareous dust. The calculi in this case\r\nconsisted chiefly of phosphate of magnesium and ammonium. Cordier of\r\nKansas City, Mo., successfully removed a renal calculus weighing over\r\nthree ounces from a woman of forty-two. The accompanying illustration\r\nshows the actual size of the calculus.\r\n\r\nAt the University College Hospital, London, there are exhibited 485\r\ngall-stones that were found postmortem in a gall-bladder.  Vanzetti\r\nreports the removal of a preputial calculus weighing 224 grams.\r\nPhillipe mentions the removal of a calculus weighing 50 grams from the\r\nprepuce of an Arab boy of seven. Croft gives an account of some\r\npreputial calculi removed from two natives of the Solomon Islands by an\r\nemigrant medical officer in Fiji. In one case 22 small stones were\r\nremoved, and in the other a single calculus weighing one ounce 110\r\ngrains. Congenital phimosis is said to be very common among the natives\r\nof Solomon Islands.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1695, Bernard removed two stones from the meatus\r\nurinarius of a man, after a lodgment of twenty years. Block mentions a\r\nsimilar case, in which the lodgment had lasted twenty-eight years.\r\nWalton speaks of a urethral calculus gradually increasing in size for\r\nfifty years. Ashburn shows what he considers the largest calculus ever\r\nremoved from the urethra.  It was 2 1/8 inches long, and 1 1/4 inches\r\nin diameter; it was white on the outside, very hard, and was shaped and\r\nlooked much like a potato. Its dry weight was 660 grains. At one end\r\nwas a polished surface that corresponded with a similar surface on a\r\nsmaller stone that lay against it; the latter calculus was shaped like\r\na lima bean, and weighed 60 grains. Hunt speaks of eight calculi\r\nremoved from the urethra of a boy of five. Herman and the Ephemerides\r\nmention cases of calculi in the seminal vesicles.\r\n\r\nCalcareous degeneration is seen in the ovary, and Peterman speaks of a\r\nstone in the ovary. Uterine calculi are described by Cuevas and Harlow;\r\nthe latter mentions that the calculus he saw was egg-shaped. There is\r\nan old chronicle of a stone taken from the womb of a woman near Trent,\r\nSomersetshire, at Easter, 1666, that weighed four ounces. The\r\nEphemerides speaks of a calculus coming away with the menstrual fluid.\r\n\r\nStones in the heart are mentioned by medical writers, and it is said\r\nthat two stones as large as almonds were found in the heart of the Earl\r\nof Balcarres.\r\n\r\nMorand speaks of a calculus ejected from the mouth by a woman.\r\n\r\nAn old record says that stones in the brain sometimes are the cause of\r\nconvulsions. D'Hericourt reports the case of a girl who died after six\r\nmonths' suffering, whose pineal gland was found petrified, and the\r\nincredible size of a chicken's egg. Blasius, Diemerbroeck, and the\r\nEphemerides, speak of stones in the location of the pineal gland.\r\n\r\nSalivary calculi are well known; they may lodge in any of the buccal\r\nducts. There is a record of the case of a man of thirty-seven who\r\nsuffered great pain and profuse salivation. It was found that he had a\r\nstone as large as a pigeon's egg under his tongue.\r\n\r\nUmbilical calculi are sometimes seen, and Deani reports such a case.\r\nThere is a French record of a case of exstrophy of the umbilicus,\r\nattended with abnormal concretions.\r\n\r\nAetius, Marcellus Donatus, Scaliger, and Schenck mention calculi of the\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\nThere are some extraordinary cases of retention and suppression of\r\nurine on record. Actual retention of urine, that is, urinary secretion\r\npassed into the bladder, but retention in the latter viscus by\r\ninanition, stricture, or other obstruction, naturally cannot continue\r\nany great length of time without mechanically rupturing the vesical\r\nwalls; but suppression of urine or absolute anuria may last an\r\nastonishingly extended period. Of the cases of retention of urine,\r\nFereol mentions that of a man of forty-nine who suffered absolute\r\nretention of urine for eight days, caused by the obstruction of a uric\r\nacid calculus. Cunyghame reports a ease of mechanic obstruction of the\r\nflow of urine for eleven days. Trapenard speaks of retention of urine\r\nfor seven days.  Among the older writers Bartholinus mentions ischuria\r\nlasting fourteen days; Cornarius, fourteen days; Rhoclius, fifteen\r\ndays; the Ephemerides, ten, eleven, and twelve days. Croom notes a case\r\nof retention of urine from laceration of the vagina during first\r\ncoitus. Foucard reports a case of retention of urine in a young girl of\r\nnineteen, due to accumulation of the menstrual fluid behind an\r\nimperforate hymen.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of urine in cases of ischuria is sometimes quite\r\nexcessive. De Vilde speaks of 16 pints being drawn off. Mazoni cites a\r\ncase in which 15 pounds of urine were retained; and Wilson mentions 16\r\npounds of urine being drawn off. Frank reports instances in which both\r\n12 and 30 pounds of urine were evacuated.  There is a record at the\r\nbeginning of this century in which it is stated that 31 pounds of urine\r\nwere evacuated in a case of ischuria.\r\n\r\nFollowing some toxic or thermic disturbance, or in diseased kidneys,\r\nsuppression of urine is quite frequently noticed. The older writers\r\nreport some remarkable instances: Haller mentions a case lasting\r\ntwenty-two weeks; Domonceau, six months; and Marcellus Donatus, six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nWhitelaw describes a boy of eight who, after an attack of scarlet\r\nfever, did not pass a single drop of urine from December 7th to\r\nDecember 20th when two ounces issued, after vesication over the\r\nkidneys. On January 2d two ounces more were evacuated, and no more was\r\npassed until the bowel acted regularly. On January 5th a whole pint of\r\nurine passed; after that the kidneys acted normally and the boy\r\nrecovered. It would be no exaggeration to state that this case lasted\r\nfrom December 5th to January 5th, for the evacuations during this\r\nperiod were so slight as to be hardly worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nLemery reports observation of a monk who during eight years vomited\r\nperiodically instead of urinating in a natural way. Five hours before\r\nvomiting he experienced a strong pain in the kidneys. The vomitus was\r\nof dark-red color, and had the odor of urine. He ate little, but drank\r\nwine copiously, and stated that the vomiting was salutary to him, as he\r\nsuffered more when he missed it.\r\n\r\nBryce records a case of anuria of seventeen days' standing.  Butler\r\nspeaks of an individual with a single kidney who suffered suppression\r\nof urine for thirteen days, caused by occlusion of the ureter by an\r\ninspissated thrombus. Dubuc observed a case of anuria which continued\r\nfor seventeen days before the fatal issue.  Fontaine reports a case of\r\nsuppression of urine for twenty-five days. Nunneley showed the kidneys\r\nof a woman who did not secrete any urine for a period of twelve days,\r\nand during this time she had not exhibited any of the usual symptoms of\r\nuremia. Peebles mentions a case of suspension of the functions of the\r\nkidneys more than once for five weeks, the patient exhibiting neither\r\ncoma, stupor, nor vomiting. Oke speaks of total suppression of urine\r\nduring seven days, with complete recovery; and Paxon mentions a case in\r\na child that recovered after five days' suppression. Russell reports a\r\ncase of complete obstructive suppression for twenty days followed by\r\ncomplete recovery. Scott and Shroff mention recovery after nine days'\r\nsuppression.\r\n\r\nThe most persistent constipation may exist for weeks, or even months,\r\nwith fair health. The fact seemed to be a subject of much interest to\r\nthe older writers. De Cabalis mentions constipation lasting\r\nthirty-seven days; Caldani, sixty-five days; Lecheverel, thirty-four\r\ndays; and Pomma, eight months; Sylvaticus, thirty months; Baillie,\r\nfifteen weeks; Blanchard, six weeks; Smetius, five mouths; Trioen,\r\nthree months; Devilliers, two years; and Gignony, seven years. Riverius\r\nmentions death following constipation of one month, and says that the\r\nintestines were completely filled. Moosman mentions death from the same\r\ncause in sixty days. Frank speaks of constipation from intestinal\r\nobstructions lasting for three weeks, and Manget mentions a similar\r\ncase lasting three months.\r\n\r\nEarly in the century Revolat reported in Marseilles an observation of\r\nan eminently nervous subject addicted to frequent abuse as regards\r\ndiet, who had not had the slightest evacuation from the bowel for six\r\nmonths. A cure was effected in this case by tonics, temperance,\r\nregulation of the diet, etc. In Tome xv of the Commentaries of Leipzig\r\nthere is an account of a man who always had his stercoral evacuations\r\non Wednesdays, and who suffered no evil consequences from this\r\nabnormality. This state of affairs had existed from childhood, and, as\r\nthe evacuations were abundant and connected, no morbific change or\r\nmalformation seemed present. The other excretions were slightly in\r\nexcess of the ordinary amount. There are many cases of constipation on\r\nrecord lasting longer than this, but none with the same periodicity and\r\nwithout change in the excrement. Tommassini records the history of a\r\nman of thirty, living an ordinary life, who became each year more\r\nconstipated. Between the ages of twenty and twenty-four the evacuations\r\nwere gradually reduced to one in eight or ten days, and at the age of\r\ntwenty-six, to one every twenty-two days. His leanness increased in\r\nproportion to his constipation, and at thirty his appetite was so good\r\nthat he ate as much as two men. His thirst was intense, but he secreted\r\nurine natural in quantity and quality. Nothing seemed to benefit him,\r\nand purgatives only augmented his trouble. His feces came in small,\r\nhard balls. His tongue was always in good condition, the abdomen not\r\nenlarged, the pulse and temperature normal.\r\n\r\nEmily Plumley was born on June 11,1850, with an imperforate anus, and\r\nlived one hundred and two days without an evacuation. During the whole\r\nperiod there was little nausea and occasional regurgitation of the\r\nmother's milk, due to over-feeding. Cripps mentions a man of forty-two\r\nwith stricture of the rectum, who suffered complete intestinal\r\nobstruction for two months, during which time he vomited only once or\r\ntwice. His appetite was good, but he avoided solid food. He recovered\r\nafter the performance of proctotomy.\r\n\r\nFleck reports the case of a Dutchman who, during the last two years, by\r\nsome peculiar innervation of the intestine, had only five or six bowel\r\nmovements a year. In the intervals the patient passed small quantities\r\nof hard feces once in eight or ten days, but the amount was so small\r\nthat they constituted no more than the feces of one meal. Two or three\r\ndays before the principal evacuation began the patient became ill and\r\nfelt uncomfortable in the back; after sharp attacks of colic he would\r\npass hard and large quantities of offensive feces. He would then feel\r\nbetter for two or three hours, when there would be a repetition of the\r\nsymptoms, and so on until he had four or five motions that day.  The\r\nfollowing day he would have a slight diarrhea and then the bowels would\r\nreturn to the former condition. The principal fecal accumulations were\r\nin the ascending and transverse colon and not only could be felt but\r\nseen through the abdominal wall. The patient was well nourished and had\r\ntried every remedy without success. Finally he went to Marienbad where\r\nhe drank freely of the waters and took the baths until the bowel\r\nmovements occurred once in two or three days.\r\n\r\nThere is a record of a man who stated that for two years he had not\r\npassed his stool by the anus, but that at six o'clock each evening he\r\nvoided feces by the mouth. His statement was corroborated by\r\nobservation. At times the evacuation took place without effort, but was\r\noccasionally attended with slight pain in the esophagus and slight\r\nconvulsions. Several hours before the evacuation the abdomen was hard\r\nand distended, which appearance vanished in the evening. In this case\r\nthere was a history of an injury in the upper iliac region.\r\n\r\nThe first accurate ideas in reference to elephantiasis arabum are given\r\nby Rhazes, Haly-Abas, and Avicenna, and it is possibly on this account\r\nthat the disease received the name elephantiasis arabum. The disease\r\nwas afterward noticed by Forestus, Mercurialis, Kaempfer, Ludoff, and\r\nothers. In 1719 Prosper Alpinus wrote of it in Egypt, and the medical\r\nofficers of the French army that invaded Egypt became familiar with it;\r\nsince then the disease has been well known.\r\n\r\nAlard relates as a case of elephantiasis that of a lady of Berlin,\r\nmentioned in the Ephemerides of 1694, who had an abdominal tumor the\r\nlower part of which reached to the knees. In this case the tumor was\r\nsituated in the skin and no vestige of disease was found in the\r\nabdominal cavity and no sensible alteration had taken place in the\r\nveins. Delpech quotes a similar case of elephantiasis in the walls of\r\nthe abdomen in a young woman of twenty-four, born at Toulouse.\r\n\r\nLymphedema, or elephantiasis arabum, is a condition in which, in the\r\nsubstance of a limb or a part, there is diffused dilatation of the\r\nlymphatics, with lymphostasis. Such a condition results when there is\r\nobstruction of so large a number of the ducts converging to the root of\r\nthe extremity or part that but little relief through collateral trunks\r\nis possible. The affected part becomes swollen and hardened, and\r\nsometimes attains an enormous size. It is neither reducible by position\r\nnor pressure. There is a corresponding dilatation and multiplication of\r\nthe blood-vessels with the connective-tissue hypertrophy. The muscles\r\nwaste, the skin becomes coarse and hypertrophied. The swollen limb\r\npresents immense lobulated masses, heaped up at different parts,\r\nseparated from one another by deep sulci, which are especially marked\r\nat the flexures of the joints. Although elephantiasis is met with in\r\nall climates, it is more common in the tropics, and its occurrence has\r\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated in these localities to be dependent on the\r\npresence in the lymphatics of the filaria sanguinis hominis. The\r\naccompanying illustration shows the condition of the limb of a girl of\r\ntwenty-one, the subject of lymphedema, five years after the inception\r\nof the disease. The changes in the limb were as yet moderate. The\r\nphotograph from which the cut was made was taken in 1875 At the present\r\ntime (seventeen years later) the case presents the typical condition of\r\nthe worst form of elephantiasis. Repeated attacks of lymphangitis have\r\noccurred during this period, each producing an aggravation of the\r\nprevious condition. The leg below the knee has become enormously\r\ndeformed by the production of the elephantoid masses; the outer side of\r\nthe thigh remains healthy, but the skin of the inner side has developed\r\nso as to form a very large and pendant lobulated mass.  A similar\r\ncondition has begun to develop in the other leg, which is row about in\r\nthe condition of the first, as shown in the figure. Figure 273\r\nrepresents this disease in its most aggravated form, a condition rarely\r\nobserved in this country. As an example of the change in the weight of\r\na person after the inception of this disease, we cite a case reported\r\nby Griffiths. The patient was a woman of fifty-two who, five years\r\nprevious, weighed 148 pounds. The elephantoid change was below the\r\nwaist, yet at the time of report the woman weighed 387 pounds. There\r\nwas little thickening of the skin. The circumference of the calf was 28\r\ninches; of the thigh, 38 inches; and of the abdomen, 80 inches; while\r\nthat of the arm was only 15 inches.\r\n\r\nThe condition commonly known as \"Barbadoes leg\" is a form of\r\nelephantiasis deriving its name from its relative frequency in\r\nBarbadoes.\r\n\r\nFigure 275 represents a well-known exhibitionist who, from all\r\nappearances, is suffering from an elephantoid hypertrophy of the lower\r\nextremities, due to a lymphedema. Quite a number of similar\r\nexhibitionists have been shown in recent years, the most celebrated of\r\nwhom was Falmy Mills, one of whose feet alone was extensively involved,\r\nand was perhaps the largest foot ever seen.\r\n\r\nElephantiasis seldom attacks the upper extremities. Of the older cases\r\nRayer reports four collected by Alard. In one case the hard and\r\npermanent swelling of the arm occurred after the application of a\r\nblister; in another the arm increased so that it weighed more than 200\r\nGenoese pounds, 40 of which consisted of serum. The swellings of the\r\narm and forearm resembled a distended bladder.  The arteries, veins,\r\nand nerves had not undergone any alteration, but the lymphatics were\r\nvery much dilated and loaded with lymph.\r\n\r\nThe third case was from Fabricius Hildanus, and the fourth from Hendy.\r\nFigure 276 represents a remarkable elephantoid change in the hand of an\r\nelderly German woman. Unfortunately there is no medical description of\r\nthe case on record, but the photograph is deemed worthy of reproduction.\r\n\r\nTerry describes a French mulatto girl of eleven whose left hand was\r\nenormously increased in weight and consistency, the chief enlargement\r\nbeing in the middle finger, which was 6 1/2 inches long, and 5 1/2\r\ninches about the nail, and 8 1/2 around the base of the finger. The\r\nindex finger was two inches thick and four inches long, twisted and\r\ndrawn, while the other fingers were dwarfed. The elephantiasis in this\r\ncase slowly and gradually increased in size until the hand weighed 3\r\n1/2 pounds. The skin of the affected finger, contrary to the general\r\nappearance of a part affected with elephantiasis, was of normal color,\r\nsmooth, shiny, showed no sensibility, and the muscles had undergone\r\nfatty degeneration. It was successfully amputated in August, 1894. The\r\naccompanying illustration shows a dorsal view of the affected hand.\r\n\r\nMagalhaes of Rio Janeiro reports a very interesting case of\r\nelephantiasis of the scalp, representing dermatolysis, in which the\r\nfold of hypertrophied skin fell over the face like the hide of an\r\nelephant, somewhat similar in appearance to the \"elephant-man.\" Figure\r\n279 represents a somewhat similar hypertrophic condition of the scalp\r\nand face reported in the Photographic Review of Medicine and Surgery,\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nElephantiasis of the face sometimes only attacks it on one side.  Such\r\na case was reported by Alard, in which the elephantiasis seems to have\r\nbeen complicated with eczema of the ear. Willier, also quoted by Alard,\r\ndescribes a remarkable case of elephantiasis of the face. After a\r\ndebauch this patient experienced violent pain in the left cheek below\r\nthe zygomatic arch; this soon extended under the chin, and the\r\nsubmaxillary glands enlarged and became painful; the face swelled and\r\nbecame erythematous, and the patient experienced nausea and slight\r\nchills. At the end of six months there was another attack, after which\r\nthe patient perceived that the face continued puffed. This attack was\r\nfollowed by several others, the face growing larger and larger. In\r\nsimilar cases tumefaction assumes enormous proportions, and Schenck\r\nspeaks of a man whose head exceeded that of an ox in size, the lower\r\npart of the face being entirely covered with the nose, which had to be\r\nraised to enable its unhappy owner to breathe.\r\n\r\nRayer cites two instances in which elephantiasis of the breast enlarged\r\nthese organs to such a degree that they hung to the knees. Salmuth\r\nspeaks of a woman whose breasts increased to such a size that they hung\r\ndown to her knees. At the same time she had in both axillae glandular\r\ntumors as large as the head of a fetus.  Borellus also quotes the case\r\nof a woman whose breasts became so large that it was necessary to\r\nsupport them by straps, which passed over the shoulders and neck.\r\n\r\nElephantiasis is occasionally seen in the genital regions of the\r\nfemale, but more often in the scrotum of the male, in which location it\r\nproduces enormous tumors, which sometimes reach to the ground and\r\nbecome so heavy as to prevent locomotion. This condition is curious in\r\nthe fact that these immense tumors have been successfully removed, the\r\ntesticles and penis, which had long since ceased to be distinguished,\r\nsaved, and their function restored. Alibert mentions a patient who was\r\noperated upon by Clot-Bey, whose scrotum when removed weighed 110\r\npounds; the man had two children after the disease had continued for\r\nthirteen years, but before it had obtained its monstrous development--a\r\nproof that the functions of the testicles had not been affected by the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThere are several old accounts of scrotal tumors which have evidently\r\nbeen elephantoid in conformation. In the Ephemerides in 1692 there was\r\nmentioned a tumor of the scrotum weighing 200 pounds. In the West\r\nIndies it was reported that rats have been known to feed on these\r\nenormous tumors, while the deserted subjects lay in a most helpless\r\ncondition. Larrey mentioned a case of elephantiasis of the scrotum in\r\nwhich the tumor weighed over 200 pounds. Sir Astley Cooper removed a\r\ntumor of 56 pounds weight from a Chinese laborer. It extended from\r\nbeneath the umbilicus to the anterior border of the anus; it had begun\r\nin the prepuce ten years previously. Clot-Bey removed an elephantoid\r\ntumor of the scrotum weighing 80 pounds, performing castration at the\r\nsame time. Alleyne reports a case of elephantiasis, in which he\r\nsuccessfully removed a tumor of the integuments of the scrotum and\r\npenis weighing 134 pounds.\r\n\r\nBicet mentions a curious instance of elephantiasis of the penis and\r\nscrotum which had existed for five years. The subject was in great\r\nmental misery and alarm at his unsightly condition. The parts of\r\ngeneration were completely buried in the huge mass. An operation was\r\nperformed in which all of the diseased structures that had totally\r\nunmanned him were removed, the true organs of generation escaping\r\ninviolate. Thebaud mentions a tumor of the scrotum, the result of\r\nelephantiasis, which weighed 63 1/2 pounds. The weight was ascertained\r\nby placing the tumor on the scales, and directing the patient to squat\r\nover them without resting any weight of the body on the scales. This\r\nman could readily feel his penis, although his surgeons could not do\r\nso.  The bladder was under perfect control, the urine flowing over a\r\nchannel on the exterior of the scrotum, extending 18 inches from the\r\nmeatus. Despite his infirmity this patient had perfect sexual desire,\r\nand occasional erections and emissions. A very interesting operation\r\nwas performed with a good recovery.\r\n\r\nPartridge reports an enormous scrotal tumor which was removed from a\r\nHindoo of fifty-five, with subsequent recovery of the subject. The\r\ntumor weighed 111 1/2 pounds. The ingenious technic of this operation\r\nis well worth perusal by those interested.  Goodman successfully\r\nremoved an elephantiasis of the scrotum from a native Fiji of\r\nforty-five. The tumor weighed 42 pounds, without taking into\r\nconsideration the weight of the fluid which escaped in abundance during\r\nthe operation and also after the operation, but before it was weighed.\r\nVan Buren and Keyes mention a tumor of the scrotum of this nature\r\nweighing 165 pounds. Quoted by Russell, Hendy describes the case of a\r\nnegro who had successive attacks of glandular swelling of the scrotum,\r\nuntil finally the scrotum was two feet long and six feet in\r\ncircumference. It is mentioned that mortification of the part caused\r\nthis patient's ultimate death.\r\n\r\nFigure 281 is taken from a photograph loaned to the authors by Dr.\r\nJames Thorington. The patient was a native of Fiji, and was\r\nsuccessfully operated on, with preservation of the testes. The tumor,\r\non removal, weighed 120 pounds.\r\n\r\nW. R. Browne, Surgeon-General, reports from the Madras General Hospital\r\nan operation on a patient of thirty-five with elephantoid scrotum of\r\nsix years' duration. The proportions of the scrotum were as follows:\r\nHorizontally the circumference was six feet 6 1/2 inches, and\r\nvertically the circumference was six feet ten inches. The penis was\r\nwholly hidden, and the urine passed from an opening two feet 5 1/2\r\ninches from the pubis. The man had complete control of his bladder, but\r\nwas unable to walk.  The operation for removal occupied one hour and\r\ntwenty minutes, and the tumor removed weighed 124 3/4 pounds. Little\r\nblood was lost on account of an elastic cord tied about the neck of the\r\ntumor, and secured by successful removal of a scrotal tumor weighing 56\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nFenger describes a case of the foregoing nature in a German of\r\ntwenty-three, a resident of Chicago. The growth had commenced eight\r\nyears previously, and had progressively increased. There was no pain or\r\nactive inflammation, and although the patient had to have especially\r\nconstructed trousers he never ceased his occupation as a driver. The\r\nscrotum was represented by a hairless tumor weighing 22 pounds, and\r\nhanging one inch below the knees.  No testicles or penis could be made\r\nout. Fenger removed the tumor, and the man was greatly improved in\r\nhealth. There was still swelling of the inguinal glands on both sides,\r\nbut otherwise the operation was very successful. The man's mental\r\ncondition also greatly improved. Fenger also calls especial attention\r\nto the importance of preserving the penis and testes in the operation,\r\nas although these parts may apparently be obliterated their functions\r\nare undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of this major operation show a surprisingly small\r\nmortality. Fayrer operated on 28 patients with 22 recoveries and six\r\ndeaths, one from shock and five from pyemia The same surgeon collected\r\n193 cases, and found the general mortality to be 18 per cent. According\r\nto Ashhurst, Turner, who practiced as a medical missionary in the\r\nSamoan Islands, claims to have operated 136 times with only two deaths.\r\nMcLeod, Fayrer's successor in India, reported 129 cases with 23 deaths.\r\n\r\nEarly in this century Rayer described a case of elephantiasis in a boy\r\nof seventeen who, after several attacks of erysipelas, showed marked\r\ndiminution of the elephantoid change; the fact shows the antagonism of\r\nthe streptococcus erysipelatis to hypertrophic and malignant processes.\r\n\r\nAcromegaly is a term introduced by Marie, and signifies large\r\nextremities. It is characterized by an abnormally large development of\r\nthe extremities and of the features of the face,--the bony as well as\r\nthe soft parts. In a well-marked case the hands and feet are greatly\r\nenlarged, but not otherwise deformed, and the normal functions are not\r\ndisturbed. The hypertrophy involves all the tissues, giving a curious\r\nspade-like appearance to the hands. The feet are similarly enlarged,\r\nalthough the big toe may be relatively much larger. The nails also\r\nbecome broad and large. The face increases in volume and becomes\r\nelongated, in consequence of the hypertrophy of the superior and\r\ninferior maxillary bones. The latter often projects beyond the upper\r\nteeth. The teeth become separated, and the soft parts increase in size.\r\nThe nose is large and broad, and the skin of the eyelids and ears is\r\nenormously hypertrophied. The tongue is greatly hypertrophied. The\r\ndisease is of long duration, and late in the history the bones of the\r\nspine and thorax may acquire great deformity. As we know little of the\r\ninfluences and sources governing nutrition, the pathology and etiology\r\nof acromegaly are obscure. Marie regards the disease as a systemic\r\ndystrophy analogous to myxedema, due to a morbid condition of the\r\npituitary body, just as myxedema is due to disease of the thyroid. In\r\nseveral of the cases reported the squint and optic atrophy and the\r\namblyopia have pointed to the pituitary body as the seat of a new\r\ngrowth of hypertrophy. Pershing shows a case of this nature.  The\r\nenlargement of the face and extremities was characteristic, and the\r\ncerebral and ocular symptoms pointed to the pituitary body as the seat\r\nof the lesion. Unverricht, Thomas, and Ransom report cases in which the\r\nocular lesions, indicative of pituitary trouble, were quite prominent.\r\nOf 22 cases collected by Tamburini 19 showed some change in the\r\npituitary body, and in the remaining three cases either the diagnosis\r\nwas uncertain or the disease was of very short duration. Linsmayer\r\nreported a case in which there was a softened adenoma in the pituitary\r\nbody, and the thymus was absent.\r\n\r\nHersman reports an interesting case of progressive enlargement of the\r\nhands in a clergyman of fifty. Since youth he had suffered with pains\r\nin the joints. About three years before the time of report he noticed\r\nenlargement of the phalangeal joint of the third finger of the right\r\nhand. A short time later the whole hand became gradually involved and\r\nthe skin assumed a darker hue.  Sensation and temperature remained\r\nnormal in both hands; acromegaly was excluded on account of the absence\r\nof similar changes elsewhere. Hersman remarks that the change was\r\nprobably due to increase in growth of the fibrous elements of the\r\nsubcutaneous lesions about the tendons, caused by rheumatic poison.\r\nFigure 283 shows the palmer and dorsal surfaces of both hands.\r\n\r\nChiromegaly is a term that has been applied by Charcot and Brissaud to\r\nthe pseudoacromegaly that sometimes occurs in syringomyelia. Most of\r\nthe cases that have been reported as a combination of these two\r\ndiseases are now thought to be only a syringomyelia. A recent case is\r\nreported by Marie. In this connection it is interesting to notice a\r\ncase of what might be called acute symptomatic transitory\r\npseudoacromegaly, reported by Potovski: In an insane woman, and without\r\nascertainable cause, there appeared an enlargement of the ankles,\r\nwrists, and shoulders, and later of the muscles, with superficial\r\ntrophic disturbances that gradually disappeared. The author excludes\r\nsyphilis, tuberculosis, rheumatism, gout, hemophilia, etc., and\r\nconsiders it to have been a trophic affection of cerebral origin.\r\nCases of pneumonia osteoarthropathy simulating acromegaly have been\r\nreported by Korn and Murray.\r\n\r\nMegalocephaly, or as it was called by Virchow, leontiasis ossea, is due\r\nto a hypertrophic process in the bones of the cranium. The cases\r\nstudied by Virchow were diffuse hyperostoses of the cranium. Starr\r\ndescribes what he supposes to be a case of this disease, and proposes\r\nthe title megalocephaly as preferable to Virchow's term, because the\r\nsoft parts are also included in the hypertrophic process. A woman of\r\nfifty-two, married but having no children, and of negative family\r\nhistory, six years before the time of report showed the first symptoms\r\nof the affection, which began with formication in the finger-tips. This\r\ngradually extended to the shoulders, and was attended with some\r\nuncertainty of tactile sense and clumsiness of movement, but actual\r\nanesthesia had never been demonstrated. This numbness had not invaded\r\nthe trunk or lower extremities, although there was slight uncertainty\r\nin the gait. There had been a slowly progressing enlargement of the\r\nhead, face, and neck, affecting the bone, skin, and subcutaneous\r\ntissues, the first to the greatest degree.  The circumference of the\r\nneck was 16 inches; the horizontal circumference of the head was 24\r\ninches; from ear to ear, over the vertex, 16 inches; and from the root\r\nof the nose to the occipital protuberance, 16 inches. The cervical\r\nvertebrae were involved, and the woman had lost five inches in height.\r\nIt may be mentioned here that Brissaud and Meige noticed the same loss\r\nin height, only more pronounced, in a case of gigantism, the loss being\r\nmore than 15 inches. In Starr's case the tongue was normal and there\r\nwas no swelling of the thyroid.\r\n\r\nCretinism is an endemic disease among mountainous people who drink\r\nlargely of lime water, and is characterized by a condition of physical,\r\nphysiologic, and mental degeneracy and nondevelopment, and possibly\r\ngoiter. The subjects of this disease seldom reach five feet in height,\r\nand usually not more than four.  The word cretin is derived from the\r\nLatin creatura. They are found all over the world. In Switzerland it is\r\nestimated that in some cantons there is one cretin to every 25\r\ninhabitants. In Styria, the Tyrol, and along the Rhine cretins are\r\nquite common, and not long since cases existed in Derbyshire. These\r\ncreatures have been allowed to marry and generate, and thus extend\r\ntheir species. In \"Le Medicin de Campagne,\" Balzac has given a vivid\r\npicture of the awe and respect in which they were held and the way in\r\nwhich they were allowed to propagate. Speaking of the endemic cretins,\r\nBeaupre says: \"I see a head of unusual form and size, a squat and\r\nbloated figure, a stupid look, bleared, hollow, and heavy eyes, thick,\r\nprojecting eyelids, and a flat nose. His face is of a leaden hue, his\r\nskin dirty, flabby, covered with tetters, and his thick tongue hangs\r\ndown over his moist, livid lips; his mouth, always open and full of\r\nsaliva, shows teeth going to decay. His chest is narrow, his back\r\ncurved, his breath asthmatic, his limbs short, misshapen, without\r\npower. The knees are thick and inclined inward, the feet flat. The\r\nlarge head droops listlessly on the breast; the abdomen is like a bag.\"\r\nThe cretin is generally deaf and dumb, or only able to give a hoarse\r\ncry. He is indifferent to heat and cold, and even to the most revolting\r\nodors. The general opinion has always been that the sexual desire and\r\ngenital organs are fully developed.\r\n\r\nA quotation under our observation credits Colonel Sykes with the\r\nfollowing statistics of cretinism, which show how in some locations it\r\nmay be a decided factor of population. In December, 1845, in a\r\npopulation of 2,558,349 souls (the locality not mentioned), there were\r\n18,462 people with simple goiter. Of the cretins without goiter there\r\nwere 2089. Of cretins with goiter there were 3909; and cretins in which\r\ngoiter was not stated 962, making a total of 6960. Of these 2185 had\r\nmere animal instincts; 3531 possessed very small intellectual\r\nfaculties; 196 were almost without any; 1048 not classified. Of this\r\nnumber 2483 were born of healthy and sane fathers; 2285 from healthy\r\nmothers; 961 from goitrous fathers; 1267 from goitrous mothers; 49 from\r\ncretin fathers; 41 from cretin mothers; 106 from cretin fathers with\r\ngoiter; 66 from cretin mothers with goiter; 438 fathers and 405 mothers\r\nwere not specified.\r\n\r\nSporadic cretinism, or congenital myzedema, is characterized by a\r\ncongenital absence of the thyroid, diminutiveness of size, thickness of\r\nneck, shortness of arms and legs, prominence of the abdomen, large size\r\nof the face, thickness of the lips, large and protruding tongue, and\r\nimbecility or idiocy. It is popularly believed that coitus during\r\nintoxication is the cause of this condition. Osler was able to collect\r\n11 or 12 cases in this country. The diagnosis is all-important, as the\r\ntreatment by the thyroid extract produces the most noteworthy results.\r\nThere are several remarkable recoveries on record, but possibly the\r\nmost wonderful is the case of J. P. West of Bellaire, Ohio, the\r\nportraits of which are reproduced in Plate 11. At seventeen months the\r\nchild presented the typical appearance of a sporadic cretin. The\r\nastonishing results of six months' treatment with thyroid extract are\r\nshown in the second figure. After a year's treatment the child presents\r\nthe appearance of a healthy and well-nourished little girl.\r\n\r\nMyxedema proper is a constitutional condition due to the loss of the\r\nfunction of the thyroid gland. The disease was first described by Sir\r\nWilliam Gull as a cretinoid change, and later by William Ord of London,\r\nwho suggested the name. It is characterized clinically by a\r\nmyxedematous condition of the subcutaneous tissues and mental failure,\r\nand anatomically by atrophy of the thyroid gland. The symptoms of\r\nmyxedema, as given by Ord, are marked increase in the general bulk of\r\nthe body, a firm, inelastic swelling of the skin, which does not pit on\r\npressure; dryness and roughness which tend, with swelling, to\r\nobliterate the lines of expression in the face; imperfect nutrition of\r\nthe hair; local tumefaction of the skin and subcutaneous tissues,\r\nparticularly in the supraclavicular region.  The physiognomy is\r\nremarkably altered; the features are coarse and broad, the lips thick,\r\nthe nostrils broad and thick, and the mouth enlarged. There is a\r\nstriking slowness of thought and of movement; the memory fails, and\r\nconditions leading to incipient dementia intervene. The functions of\r\nthe thoracic and abdominal organs seem to be normal, and death is\r\ngenerally due to some intercurrent disease, possibly tuberculosis. A\r\ncondition akin to myxedema occurs after operative removal of the\r\nthyroid gland.\r\n\r\nIn a most interesting lecture Brissaud shows the intimate relation\r\nbetween myxedema, endemic cretinism, sporadic cretinism, or\r\nmyxedematous idiocy, and infantilism. He considers that they are all\r\ndependent upon an inherited or acquired deficiency or disease of the\r\nthyroid gland, and he presents cases illustrating each affection.\r\nFigure 285 shows a case of myxedema, one of myxedema in a case of\r\narrested development--a transition case between myxedema of the adult\r\nand sporadic cretinism--and a typical case of sporadic cretinism.\r\n\r\nCagots are an outcast race or clan of dwarfs in the region of the\r\nPyrenees, and formerly in Brittany, whose existence has been a\r\nscientific problem since the sixteenth century, at which period they\r\nwere known as Cagots, Gahets, Gafets, Agotacs, in France; Agotes or\r\nGafos, in Spain; and Cacous, in Lower Brittany. Cagot meant the dog of\r\na Goth; they were of supposed Gothic origin by some, and of Tartar\r\norigin by others. These people were formerly supposed to have been the\r\ndescendants of lepers, or to have been the victims of leprosy\r\nthemselves. From the descriptions there is a decided difference between\r\nthe Cagots and the cretins. In a recent issue of Cosmos a writer\r\ndescribes Cagots as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"They inhabit the valley of the Ribas in the northwestern part of the\r\nSpanish province now called Gerona. They never exceed 51 1/2 inches in\r\nheight, and have short, ill-formed legs, great bellies, small eyes,\r\nflat noses, and pale, unwholesome complexions. They are usually stupid,\r\noften to the verge of idiocy, and much subject to goiter and scrofulous\r\naffections. The chief town of the Ribas Valley is Ribas, a place of\r\n1500 inhabitants, about 800 feet above sea-level. The mountains rise\r\nabout the town to a height of from 6000 to 8000 feet, and command an\r\namazingly beautiful panorama of mountain, plain, and river, with\r\nSpanish cities visible upon the one side and French upon the other. The\r\nregion is rich, both agriculturally and minerally, and is famous for\r\nits medicinal springs. In this paradise dwell the dwarfs, perhaps as\r\ndegraded a race of men and women as may be found in any civilized\r\ncommunity. They are almost without education, and inhabit wretched huts\r\nwhen they have any shelter. The most intelligent are employed as\r\nshepherds, and in summer they live for months at an elevation of more\r\nthan 6000 feet without shelter. Here they see no human creature save\r\nsome of their own kind, often idiots, who are sent up every fifteen or\r\ntwenty days with a supply of food.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that formal marriage is almost unknown among them.  The\r\nwomen in some instances are employed in the village of Ribas as nurses\r\nfor children, and as such are found tender and faithful. Before\r\ncommunication throughout the region was as easy as it is now, it was\r\nthought lucky to have one of these dwarfs in a family, and the dwarfs\r\nwere hired out and even sold to be used in beggary in neighboring\r\ncities. There are somewhat similar dwarfs in other valleys of the\r\nPyrenees, but the number is decreasing, and those of the Ribas Valley\r\nare reduced to a few individuals.\"\r\n\r\nHiccough is a symptom due to intermittent, sudden contraction of the\r\ndiaphragm. Obstinate cases are most peculiar, and sometimes exhaust the\r\nphysician's skill. Symes divides these cases into four groups:--\r\n\r\n(1) Inflammatory, seen particularly in inflammatory diseases of the\r\nviscera or abdominal membranes, and in severe cases of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n(2) Irritative, as in direct stimulus of the diaphragm in swallowing\r\nsome very hot substance; local disease of the esophagus near the\r\ndiaphragm, and in many conditions of gastric and intestinal disorder,\r\nmore particularly those associated with flatus.\r\n\r\n(3) Specific or idiopathic, in which there are no evident causes\r\npresent; it is sometimes seen in cases of nephritis and diabetes.\r\n\r\n(4) Neurotic, in which the primary cause is in the nervous\r\nsystem,--hysteria, epilepsy, shock, or cerebral tumors.\r\n\r\nThe obstinacy of continued hiccough has long been discussed.  Osler\r\ncalls to mind that in Plato's \"Symposium\" the physician, Eryximachus,\r\nrecommended to Aristophanes, who had hiccough from eating too much,\r\neither to hold his breath or to gargle with a little water; but if it\r\nstill continued, \"tickle your nose with something and sneeze, and if\r\nyou sneeze once or twice even the most violent hiccough is sure to go.\"\r\nThe attack must have been a severe one, as it is stated subsequently\r\nthat the hiccough did not disappear until Aristophanes had excited the\r\nsneezing.\r\n\r\nAmong the older medical writers Weber speaks of singultus lasting for\r\nfive days; Tulpius, for twelve days; Eller and Schenck, for three\r\nmonths; Taranget, for eight months; and Bartholinus, for four years.\r\n\r\nAt the present day it is not uncommon to read in the newspapers\r\naccounts of prolonged hiccoughing. These cases are not mythical, and\r\nare paralleled by a number of instances in reliable medical literature.\r\nThe cause is not always discernible, and cases sometimes resist all\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nHolston reports a case of chronic singultus of seven years' standing.\r\nIt had followed an attack of whooping-cough, and was finally cured\r\napparently by the administration of strychnin.  Cowan speaks of a\r\nshoemaker of twenty-two who experienced an attack of constant singultus\r\nfor a week, and then intermittent attacks for six years. Cowan also\r\nmentions instances of prolonged hiccough related by Heberden, Good,\r\nHoffman, and Wartmouth.  Barrett is accredited with reporting a case of\r\npersistent hiccough in a man of thirty-five. Rowland speaks of a man of\r\nthirty-five who hiccoughed for twelve years. The paroxysms were almost\r\nconstant, and occurred once or twice a minute during the hours when the\r\nman was not sleeping. There was no noise with the cough. There is\r\nanother case related in the same journal of a man who died on the\r\nfourth day of an attack of singultus, probably due to abscess of the\r\ndiaphragm, which no remedy would relieve.  Moore records a case of a\r\nchild, injured when young, who hiccoughed until about twenty years of\r\nage (the age at the time of report). Foot mentions a lad of fifteen\r\nwho, except when asleep, hiccoughed incessantly for twenty-two weeks,\r\nand who suffered two similar, but less severe, attacks in the summer of\r\n1879, and again in 1880. The disease was supposed to be due to the\r\nhabit of pressing the chest against the desk when at school.  Dexter\r\nreports a case of long-continued singultus in an Irish girl of\r\neighteen, ascribed to habitual masturbation. There was no intermission\r\nin the paroxysm, which increased in force until general convulsions\r\nensued. The patient said that the paroxysm could be stopped by firm\r\npressure on the upper part of the external genital organs. Dexter\r\napplied firm pressure on her clitoris, and the convulsions subsided,\r\nand the patient fell asleep. They could be excited by firm pressure on\r\nthe lower vertebrae. Corson speaks of a man of fifty-seven who, after\r\nexposure to cold, suffered exhausting hiccough for nine days; and also\r\nrecords the case of an Irish servant who suffered hiccough for four\r\nmonths; the cause was ascribed to fright. Stevenson cites a fatal\r\ninstance of hiccough in a stone-mason of forty-four who suffered\r\ncontinuously from May 14th to May 28th. The only remedy that seemed to\r\nhave any effect in this case was castor-oil in strong purgative doses.\r\n\r\nWillard speaks of a man of thirty-four who began to hiccough after an\r\nattack of pneumonia, and continued for eighty-six hours.  The treatment\r\nconsisted of the application of belladonna and cantharides plasters,\r\nbismuth, and lime-water, camphor, and salts of white hellebore inhaled\r\nthrough the nose in finest powder. Two other cases are mentioned by the\r\nsame author. Gapper describes the case of a young man who was seized\r\nwith loud and distressing hiccough that never ceased for a minute\r\nduring eighty hours. Two ounces of laudanum were administered in the\r\nthree days without any decided effect, producing only slight languor.\r\n\r\nRanney reports the case of an unmarried woman of forty-four who\r\nsuffered from paroxysms of hiccough that persisted for four years. A\r\npeculiarity of this attack was that it invariably followed movements of\r\nthe upper extremities. Tenderness and hyperesthesia over the spinous\r\nprocesses of the 4th, 5th, and 6th cervical vertebrae led to the\r\napplication of the thermocautery, which, in conjunction with the\r\nadministration of ergot and bromide, was attended with marked benefit,\r\nthough not by complete cure. Barlow mentions a man with a rheumatic\r\naffection of the shoulder who hiccoughed when he moved his joints.\r\nBarlow also recites a case of hiccough which was caused by pressure on\r\nthe cicatrix of a wound in the left hand.\r\n\r\nBeilby reports a peculiar case in a girl of seventeen who suffered an\r\nanomalous affection of the respiratory muscle, producing a sound like a\r\ncough, but shriller, almost resembling a howl. It was repeated every\r\nfive or six seconds during the whole of the waking moments, and\r\nsubsided during sleep. Under rest and free purgation the patient\r\nrecovered, but the paroxysms continued during prolonged intervals, and\r\nin the last six years they only lasted from twenty-four to forty-eight\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nParker reports four rebellious cases of singultus successfully treated\r\nby dry cups applied to the abdomen. In each case it was necessary to\r\nrepeat the operation after two hours, but recovery was then rapid.\r\nTatevosoff reports a brilliant cure in a patient with chronic chest\r\ntrouble, by the use of common snuff, enough being given several times\r\nto induce lively sneezing. Griswold records a successful treatment of\r\none case in a man of fifty, occurring after a debauch, by the\r\nadministration of glonoin, 1/150 of a grain every three hours.\r\nHeidenhain records a very severe and prolonged case caused, as shown\r\nlater at the operation and postmortem examination, by carcinoma of the\r\npancreas. The spasms were greatly relieved by cocain administered by\r\nthe mouth, as much as 15 grains being given in twelve hours. Laborde\r\nand Lepine report the case of a young girl who was relieved of an\r\nobstinate case of hiccough lasting four days by traction on her tongue.\r\nAfter the tongue had been held out of the mouth for a few minutes the\r\nhiccoughs ceased. Laborde referred to two cases of a similar character\r\nreported by Viand.\r\n\r\nAnomalous Sneezing.--In the olden times sneezing was considered a good\r\nomen, and was regarded as a sacred sign by nearly all of the ancient\r\npeoples. This feeling of reverence was already ancient in the days of\r\nHomer. Aristotle inquired into the nature and origin of the\r\nsuperstition, somewhat profanely wondering why sneezing had been\r\ndeified rather than coughing. The Greeks traced the origin of the\r\nsacred regard for sneezing to the days of Prometheus, who blessed his\r\nman of clay when he sneezed.  According to Seguin the rabbinical\r\naccount says that only through Jacob's struggle with the angel did\r\nsneezing cease to be an act fatal to man. Not only in Greece and Rome\r\nwas sneezing revered, but also by races in Asia and Africa, and even by\r\nthe Mexicans of remote times. Xenophon speaks of the reverence as to\r\nsneezing, in the court of the King of Persia. In Mesopotamia and some\r\nof the African towns the populace rejoiced when the monarch sneezed. In\r\nthe present day we frequently hear \"God bless you\" addressed to persons\r\nwho have just sneezed, a perpetuation of a custom quite universal in\r\nthe time of Gregory the Great, in whose time, at a certain season, the\r\nair was filled with an unwholesome vapor or malaria which so affected\r\nthe people that those who sneezed were at once stricken with\r\ndeath-agonies. In this strait the pontiff is said to have devised a\r\nform of prayer to be uttered when the paroxysm was seen to be coming\r\non, and which, it was hoped, would avert the stroke of the death-angel.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious cases of anomalous sneezing on record, some of\r\nwhich are possibly due to affections akin to our present \"hay fever,\"\r\nwhile others are due to causes beyond our comprehension. The\r\nEphemerides records a paroxysm of continual sneezing lasting thirty\r\ndays. Bonet, Lancisi, Fabricius Hildanus, and other older observers\r\nspeak of sneezing to death. Morgagni mentions death from congestion of\r\nthe vasa cerebri caused by sneezing. The Ephemerides records an\r\ninstance of prolonged sneezing which was distinctly hereditary.\r\n\r\nEllison makes an inquiry for treatment of a case of sneezing in a white\r\nchild of ten. The sneezing started without apparent cause and would\r\ncontinue 20 or 30 times, or until the child was exhausted, and then\r\nstop for a half or one minute, only to relapse again. Beilby speaks of\r\na boy of thirteen who suffered constant sneezing (from one to six times\r\na minute) for one month.  Only during sleep was there any relief. The\r\npatient recovered under treatment consisting of active leeching,\r\npurgation, and blisters applied behind the ear, together with the\r\napplication of olive oil to the nostrils.\r\n\r\nLee reports a remarkable case of yawning followed by sneezing in a girl\r\nof fifteen who, just before, had a tooth removed without difficulty.\r\nHalf an hour afterward yawning began and continued for five weeks\r\ncontinuously. There was no pain, no illness, and she seemed amused at\r\nher condition. There was no derangement of the sexual or other organs\r\nand no account of an hysteric spasm.  Potassium bromid and belladonna\r\nwere administered for a few days with negative results, when the\r\nattacks of yawning suddenly turned to sneezing. One paroxysm followed\r\nanother with scarcely an interval for speech. She was chloroformed once\r\nand the sneezing ceased, but was more violent on recovery therefrom.\r\nAmmonium bromid in half-drachm doses, with rest in bed for psychologic\r\nreasons, checked the sneezing. Woakes presented a paper on what he\r\ndesignated \"ear-sneezing,\" due to the caking of cerumen in one ear.\r\nIrritation of the auricular branch of the vagus was produced, whence an\r\nimpression was propagated to the lungs through the pulmonary branches\r\nof the vagus. Yawning was caused through implication of the third\r\ndivision of the 5th nerve, sneezing following from reflex implication\r\nof the spinal nerves of respiration, the lungs being full of air at the\r\ntime of yawning. Woakes also speaks of \"ear-giddiness\" and offers a new\r\nassociate symptom--superficial congestion of the hands and forearm.\r\n\r\nA case of anomalous sneezing immediately prior to sexual intercourse is\r\nmentioned on page 511.\r\n\r\nHemophilia is an hereditary, constitutional fault, characterized by a\r\ntendency to uncontrollable bleeding, either spontaneous or from slight\r\nwounds. It is sometimes associated with a form of arthritis (Ogler).\r\nThis hemorrhagic diathesis has been known for many years; and the fact\r\nthat there were some persons who showed a peculiar tendency to bleed\r\nafter wounds of a trifling nature is recorded in some of the earliest\r\nmedical literature. Only recently, however, through the writings of\r\nBuel, Otto, Hay, Coates, and others, has the hereditary nature of the\r\nmalady and its curious mode of transmission through the female line\r\nbeen known. As a rule the mother of a hemophile is not a \"bleeder\"\r\nherself, but is the daughter of one. The daughters of a hemophile,\r\nthough healthy and free from any tendency themselves, are almost\r\ncertain to transmit the disposition to the male offspring. The\r\ncondition generally appears after some slight injury in the first two\r\nyears of life; but must be distinguished from the hemorrhagic\r\naffections of the new-born, which will be discussed later. The social\r\ncondition of the family does not alter the predisposition; the old Duke\r\nof Albany was a \"bleeder\"; and bleeder families are numerous, healthy\r\nlooking, and have fine, soft skins.\r\n\r\nThe duration of this tendency, and its perpetuation in a family, is\r\nremarkable. The Appleton-Swain family of Reading, Mass., has shown\r\nexamples for two centuries. Osler has been advised of instances already\r\noccurring in the seventh generation. Kolster has investigated\r\nhemophilia in women, and reports a case of bleeding in the daughter of\r\na hemophilic woman. He also analyzes 50 genealogic trees of hemophilic\r\nfamilies, and remarks that Nasse's law of transmission does not hold\r\ntrue. In 14 cases the transmission was direct from the father to the\r\nchild, and in 11 cases it was direct from the mother to the infant.\r\n\r\nThe hemorrhagic symptoms of bleeders may be divided into external\r\nbleedings, either spontaneous or traumatic; interstitial bleedings,\r\npetechiae, and ecchymoses; and the joint-affections.  The external\r\nbleedings are seldom spontaneous, and generally follow cuts, bruises,\r\nscratches, and often result seriously. A minor operation on a hemophile\r\nmay end in death; so slight an operation as drawing a tooth has been\r\nfollowed by the most disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nArmstrong, Blagden, and Roberts, have seen fatal hemorrhage after the\r\nextraction of teeth. MacCormac observed five bleeders at St.  Thomas\r\nHospital, London, and remarks that one of these persons bled twelve\r\ndays after a tooth-extraction. Buchanan and Clay cite similar\r\ninstances. Cousins mentions an individual of hemorrhagic diathesis who\r\nsuccumbed to extensive extravasation of blood at the base of the brain,\r\nfollowing a slight fall during an epileptic convulsion. Dunlape reports\r\na case of hemorrhagic diathesis, following suppression of the\r\ncatamenia, attended by vicarious hemorrhage from the gums, which\r\nterminated fatally.  Erichsenf cites an instance of extravasation of\r\nblood into the calf of the leg of an individual of hemophilic\r\ntendencies. A cavity was opened, which extended from above the knee to\r\nthe heel; the clots were removed, and cautery applied to check the\r\nbleeding. There was extension of the blood-cavity to the thigh, with\r\nedema and incipient gangrene, necessitating amputation of the thigh,\r\nwith a fatal termination.\r\n\r\nMackenzie reports an instance of hemophilic purpura of the retina,\r\nfollowed by death. Harkin gives an account of vicarious bleeding from\r\nthe under lip in a woman of thirty-eight. The hemorrhage occurred at\r\nevery meal and lasted ten minutes. There is no evidence that the woman\r\nwas of hemophilic descent.\r\n\r\nOf 334 cases of bleeding in hemophilia collected by Grandidier, 169\r\nwere from the nose, 43 from the mouth, 15 from the stomach, 36 from the\r\nbowels, 16 from the urethra, 17 from the lungs, and a few from the skin\r\nof the head, eyelids, scrotum, navel, tongue, finger-tips, vulva, and\r\nexternal ear. Osler remarks that Professor Agnew knew of a case of a\r\nbleeder who had always bled from cuts and bruises above the neck, never\r\nfrom those below. The joint-affections closely resemble acute\r\nrheumatism. Bleeders do not necessarily die of their early bleedings,\r\nsome living to old age. Oliver Appleton, the first reported American\r\nbleeder, died at an advanced age, owing to hemorrhage from a bed-sore\r\nand from the urethra. Fortunately the functions of menstruation and\r\nparturition are not seriously interfered with in hemophilia.\r\nMenstruation is never so excessive as to be fatal. Grandidier states\r\nthat of 152 boy subjects 81 died before the termination of the seventh\r\nyear. Hemophilia is rarely fatal in the first year.\r\n\r\nOf the hemorrhagic diseases of the new-born three are worthy of note.\r\nIn syphilis haemorrhagica neonatorum the child may be born healthy, or\r\njust after birth there may appear extensive cutaneous extravasations\r\nwith bleeding from the mucous surfaces and from the navel; the child\r\nmay become deeply jaundiced. Postmortem examination shows extensive\r\nextravasations into the internal viscera, and also organic syphilitic\r\nlesions.\r\n\r\nWinckel's disease, or epidemic hemoglobinuria, is a very fatal\r\naffection, sometimes epidemic in lying-in institutions; it develops\r\nabout the fourth day after birth. The principal symptom is hematogenous\r\nicterus with cyanosis,--the urine contains blood and blood-coloring\r\nmatter. Some cases have shown in a marked degree acute fatty\r\ndegeneration of the internal organs--Buhl's disease.\r\n\r\nApart from the common visceral hemorrhages, the results of injuries at\r\nbirth, bleeding from one or more of the surfaces is a not uncommon\r\nevent in the new-born, particularly in hospital-practice. According to\r\nOsler Townsend reports 45 cases in 6700 deliveries, the hemorrhage\r\nbeing both general and from the navel alone. Bleeding also occurs from\r\nthe bowels, stomach, and mouth, generally beginning in the first week,\r\nbut in rare instances it is delayed to the second or third. Out of 50\r\ncases collected by Townsend 31 died and 19 recovered. The nature of the\r\ndisease is unknown, and postmortem examination reveals no pathologic\r\nchanges, although the general and not local nature of the affection,\r\nits self-limited character, the presence of fever, and the greater\r\nprevalence of the disease in hospitals, suggest an infectious origin\r\n(Townsend). Kent a speaks of a new-born infant dying of spontaneous\r\nhemorrhage from about the hips.\r\n\r\nInfantile scurvy, or Barlow's disease, has lately attracted marked\r\nattention, and is interesting for the numerous extravasations and\r\nspontaneous hemorrhages which are associated with it. A most\r\ninteresting collection of specimens taken from the victims of Barlow's\r\ndisease were shown in London in 1895.\r\n\r\nIn an article on the successful preventive treatment of tetanus\r\nneonatorum, or the \"scourge of St. Kilda,\" of the new-born, Turner says\r\nthe first mention of trismus nascentium or tetanus neonatorum was made\r\nby Rev. Kenneth Macaulay in 1764, after a visit to the island of St.\r\nKilda in 1758. This gentleman states that the infants of this island\r\ngive up nursing on the fourth or fifth day after birth; on the seventh\r\nday their gums are so clinched together that it is impossible to get\r\nanything down their throats; soon after this they are seized with\r\nconvulsive fits and die on the eighth day. So general was this trouble\r\non the island of St. Kilda that the mothers never thought of making any\r\npreparation for the coming baby, and it was wrapped in a dirty piece of\r\nblanket till the ninth or tenth day, when, if the child survived, the\r\naffection of the mother asserted itself. This lax method of caring for\r\nthe infant, the neglect to dress the cord, and the unsanitary condition\r\nof the dwellings, make it extremely probable that the infection was\r\nthrough the umbilical cord. All cases in which treatment was properly\r\ncarried out by competent nurses have survived. This treatment consisted\r\nin dressing the cord with iodoform powder and antiseptic wool, the\r\nbreast-feeding of the baby from the first, and the administration of\r\none-grain doses of potassium bromid at short intervals. The infant\r\ndeath-rate on the island of St. Kilda has, consequently, been much\r\nreduced. The author suggests the use of a new iodin-preparation called\r\nloretin for dressing the cord. The powder is free from odor and is\r\nnonpoisonous.\r\n\r\nHuman Parasites.--Worms in the human body are of interest on account of\r\nthe immense length some species attain, the anomalous symptoms which\r\nthey cause, or because of their anomalous location and issue. According\r\nto modern writers the famous Viennese collection of helminths contains\r\nchains of tenia saginata 24 feet long. The older reports, according to\r\nwhich the taenia solium (i.e., generally the taenia saginata) grew to\r\nsuch lengths as 40, 50, 60, and even as much as 800 yards, are\r\ngenerally regarded as erroneous. The observers have apparently taken\r\nthe total of all the fragments of the worm or worms evacuated at any\r\ntime and added them, thus obtaining results so colossal that it would\r\nbe impossible for such an immense mass to be contained in any human\r\nintestine.\r\n\r\nThe name solium has no relation to the Latin solus, or solium. It is\r\nquite possible for a number of tapeworms to exist simultaneously in the\r\nhuman body. Palm mentions the fact of four tapeworms existing in one\r\nperson; and Mongeal has made observations of a number of cases in which\r\nseveral teniae existed simultaneously in the stomach. David speaks of\r\nthe expulsion of five teniae by the ingestion of a quantity of sweet\r\nwine. Cobbold reports the case of four simultaneous tapeworms; and\r\nAguiel describes the case of a man of twenty-four who expelled a mass\r\nweighing a kilogram, 34.5 meters long, consisting of several different\r\nworms. Garfinkel mentions a case which has been extensively quoted, of\r\na peasant who voided 238 feet of tapeworms, 12 heads being found.\r\nLaveran reports a case in which 23 teniae were expelled in the same\r\nday. Greenhow mentions the occurrence of two teniae mediocanellata.\r\n\r\nThe size of a tapeworm in a small child is sometimes quite surprising.\r\nEven the new-born have exhibited signs of teniae, and Haussmann has\r\ndiscussed this subject. Armor speaks of a fully-matured tapeworm being\r\nexpelled from a child five days old.  Kennedy reports cases in which\r\ntapeworms have been expelled from infants five, and five and one-half\r\nmonths old. Heisberg gives an account of a tapeworm eight feet in\r\nlength which came from a child of two. Twiggs describes a case in which\r\na tapeworm 36 feet long was expelled from a child of four; and Fabre\r\nmentions the expulsion of eight teniae from a child. Occasionally the\r\ntapeworm is expelled from the mouth. Such cases are mentioned by Hitch\r\nand Martel. White speaks of a tapeworm which was discharged from the\r\nstomach after the use of an emetic. Lile mentions the removal of a\r\ntapeworm which had been in the bowel twenty-four years.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar effects of a tapeworm are exaggerated appetite and thirst,\r\nnausea, headaches, vertigo, ocular symptoms, cardiac palpitation, and\r\nMursinna has even observed a case of trismus, or lockjaw, due to taenia\r\nsolium. Fereol speaks of a case of vertigo, accompanied with epileptic\r\nconvulsions, which was caused by teniae. On the administration of\r\nkousso three heads were expelled simultaneously. There is a record of\r\nan instance of cardiac pulsation rising to 240 per minute, which ceased\r\nupon the expulsion of a large tapeworm. It is quite possible for the\r\npresence of a tapeworm to indirectly produce death. Garroway describes\r\na case in which death was apparently imminent from the presence of a\r\ntapeworm. Kisel has recorded a fatal case of anemia, in a child of six,\r\ndependent on teniae.\r\n\r\nThe number of ascarides or round-worms in one subject is sometimes\r\nenormous. Victor speaks of 129 round-worms being discharged from a\r\nchild in the short space of five days. Pole mentions the expulsion of\r\n441 lumbricoid worms in thirty-four days, and Fauconneau-Dufresne has\r\nreported a most remarkable case in which 5000 ascarides were discharged\r\nin less than three years, mostly by vomiting. The patient made an\r\nultimate recovery.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances in which the lumbricoid worms have pierced the\r\nintestinal tract and made their way to other viscera, sometimes leading\r\nto an anomalous exit. There are several cases on record in which the\r\nlumbricoid worms have been found in the bladder. Pare speaks of a case\r\nof this kind during a long illness; and there is mention of a man who\r\nvoided a worm half a yard long from his bladder after suppression of\r\nurine. The Ephemerides contains a curious case in which a stone was\r\nformed in the bladder, having for its nucleus a worm. Fontanelle\r\npresented to the Royal Academy of Medicine of Paris several yards of\r\ntapeworm passed from the urethra of a man of fifty-three. The following\r\nis a quotation from the British Medical Journal: \"I have at present a\r\npatient passing in his urine a worm-like body, not unlike a tapeworm as\r\nfar as the segments and general appearance are concerned, the length of\r\neach segment being about 1/4 inch, the breadth rather less; sometimes 1\r\n1/2 segments are joined together. The worm is serrated on the one side,\r\neach segment having 1 1/2 cusps. The urine pale, faintly acid at first,\r\nwithin the last week became almost neutral. There was considerable\r\nvesical irritation for the first week, with abundant mucus in the\r\nurine, specific gravity was 1010; there were no albumin nor tube-casts\r\nnor uric acid in the urinary sediments.  Later there were pus-cells and\r\nabundant pus. Tenderness existed behind the prostate and along the\r\ncourse of left ureter.  Temperature of patient oscillated from 97.5\r\ndegrees to 103.2 degrees F. There was no history at any time of\r\nrecto-vesical fistula. Can anyone suggest the name, etc., of this\r\nhelminth?\"\r\n\r\nOther cases of worms in the bladder are mentioned in Chapter XIII\r\n\r\nMitra speaks of the passage of round-worms through the umbilicus of an\r\nadult; and there is a case mentioned in which round-worms about seven\r\ninches long were voided from the navel of a young child. Borgeois\r\nspeaks of a lumbricoid worm found in the biliary passages, and another\r\nin the air passages.\r\n\r\nTurnbull has recorded two cases of perforation of the tympanic membrane\r\nfrom lumbricoides. Dagan speaks of the issue of a lumbricoid from the\r\nexternal auditory meatus. Laughton reports an instance of lumbricoid in\r\nthe nose. Rake speaks of asphyxia from a round-worm. Morland mentions\r\nthe ejection of numerous lumbricoid worms from the mouth.\r\n\r\nWorms have been found in the heart; and it is quite possible that in\r\ncases of trichinosis, specimens of the trichinae may be discovered\r\nanywhere in the line of cardiac or lymphatic circulation. Quoted by\r\nFournier, Lapeyronnie has seen worms in the pericardial sac, and also\r\nin the ventricle. There is an old record of a person dying of\r\nintestinal worms, one of which was found in the left ventricle. Castro\r\nand Vidal speak of worms in the aorta. Rake reports a case of sudden\r\ndeath from round-worm; and Brown has noted a similar instance.\r\n\r\nThe echinococcus is a tiny cestode which is the factor in the\r\nproduction of the well-known hydatid cysts which may be found in any\r\npart of the body. Delafield and Prudden report the only instance of\r\nmultilocular echinococcus seen in this country. Their patient was a\r\nGerman who had been in this country five years.  There are only about\r\n100 of these cases on record, most of them being in Bavaria and\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nThe filaria sanguinis hominis is a small worm of the nematode species,\r\nthe adult form of which lives in the lymphatics, and either the adult\r\nor the prematurely discharged ova (Manson) block the lymph-channels,\r\nproducing the conditions of hematochyluria, elephantiasis, and\r\nlymph-scrotum. The Dracunculus medinensis or Guinea-worm is a\r\nwidely-spread parasite in parts of Africa and the West Indies.\r\nAccording to Osler several cases have occurred in the United States.\r\nJarvis reports a case in a post-chaplain who had lived at Fortress\r\nMonroe, Va., for thirty years. Van Harlingen's patient, a man of\r\nforty-seven, had never lived out of Philadelphia, so that the worm must\r\nbe included among the parasites infesting this country.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1896, Henry of Philadelphia showed microscopic slides\r\ncontaining blood which was infested with numbers of living and active\r\nfilaria embryos. The blood was taken from a colored woman at the\r\nWoman's Hospital, who developed hematochyluria after labor. Henry\r\nbelieved that the woman had contracted the disease during her residence\r\nin the Southern States.\r\n\r\nCurran gives quite an exhaustive article on the disease called in olden\r\ntimes \"eaten of worms,\"--a most loathsome malady. Herod the Great, the\r\nEmperor Galerius, and Philip II of Spain perished from it. In speaking\r\nof the Emperor Galerius, Dean Milman, in his \"History of Latin\r\nChristianity,\" says, \"a deep and fetid ulcer preyed on the lower parts\r\nof his body and ate them away into a mass of living corruption.\"\r\nGibbon, in his \"Decline and Fall,\" also says that \"his (Galerius's)\r\ndeath was caused by a very painful and lingering disorder. His body,\r\nswelled by an intemperate course of life to an unwieldy corpulence, was\r\ncovered with ulcers and devoured by immense swarms of those insects who\r\nhave given their names to this most loathsome disease.\" It is also said\r\nthat the African Vandal King, the Arian Huneric, died of the disease.\r\nAntiochus, surnamed the \"Madman,\" was also afflicted with it; and\r\nJosephus makes mention of it as afflicting the body of Herod the Great.\r\nThe so-called \"King Pym\" died of this \"morbus pedicularis,\" but as\r\nprejudice and passion militated against him during his life and after\r\nhis death, this fact is probably more rumor than verity. A case is\r\nspoken of by Curran, which was seen by an army-surgeon in a very aged\r\nwoman in the remote parts of Ireland, and another in a female in a\r\ndissecting-room in Dublin. The tissues were permeated with lice which\r\nemerged through rents and fissures in the body.\r\n\r\nInstances of the larvae of the estrus or the bot-fly in the skin are\r\nnot uncommon. In this country Allen removed such larvae from the skin\r\nof the neck, head, and arm of a boy of twelve. Bethune, Delavigne,\r\nHowship, Jacobs, Jannuzzi and others, report similar cases. These\r\nflesh-flies are called creophilae, and the condition they produce is\r\ncalled myiosis. According to Osler, in parts of Central America, the\r\neggs of a bot-fly, called the dermatobia, are not infrequently\r\ndeposited in the skin, and produce a swelling very like the ordinary\r\nboil. Matas has described a case in which the estrus larvae were found\r\nin the gluteal region.  Finlayson of Glasgow has recently reported an\r\ninteresting case in a physician who, after protracted constipation and\r\npain in the back and sides, passed large numbers of the larvae of the\r\nflower-fly, anthomyia canicularis, and there are other instances of\r\nmyiosis interna from swallowing the larvae of the common house-fly.\r\n\r\nThere are forms of nasal disorder caused by larvae, which some native\r\nsurgeons in India regard as a chronic and malignant ulceration of the\r\nmucous membranes of the nose and adjacent sinuses in the debilitated\r\nand the scrofulous. Worms lodging in the cribriform plate of the\r\nethmoid feed on the soft tissues of that region. Eventually their\r\nravages destroy the olfactory nerves, with subsequent loss of the sense\r\nof smell, and they finally eat away the bridge of the nose. The head of\r\nthe victim droops, and he complains of crawling of worms in the\r\ninterior of the nose. The eyelids swell so that the patient cannot see,\r\nand a deformity arises which exceeds that produced by syphilis. Lyons\r\nsays that it is one of the most loathsome diseases that comes under the\r\nobservation of medical men. He describes the disease as \"essentially a\r\nscrofulous inflammation of the Schneiderian membrane, ... which finally\r\nattacks the bones.\" Flies deposit their ova in the nasal discharges,\r\nand from their infection maggots eventually arise. In Sanskrit peenash\r\nsignifies disease of the nose, and is the Indian term for the disease\r\ncaused by the deposition of larvae in the nose. It is supposed to be\r\nmore common in South America than in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nANOMALOUS SKIN-DISEASES.\r\n\r\nIchthyosis is a disease of the skin characterized by a morbid\r\ndevelopment of the papillae and thickening of the epidermic lamellae;\r\naccording as the skin is affected over a larger or smaller area, or\r\nonly the epithelial lining of the follicles, it is known as ichthyosis\r\ndiffusa, or ichthyosis follicularis. The hardened masses of epithelium\r\ndevelop in excess, the epidermal layer loses in integrity, and the\r\nsurface becomes scaled like that of a fish. Ichthyosis may be\r\ncongenital, and over sixty years ago Steinhausen described a fetal\r\nmonster in the anatomic collection in Berlin, the whole surface of\r\nwhose body was covered with a thick layer of epidermis, the skin being\r\nso thick as to form a covering like a coat-of-mail. According to Rayer\r\nthe celebrated \"porcupine-man\" who exhibited himself in England in 1710\r\nwas an example of a rare form of ichthyosis. This man's body, except\r\nthe face, the palms of the hands, and the soles of the feet, was\r\ncovered with small excrescences in the form of prickles. These\r\nappendages were of a reddish-brown color, and so hard and elastic that\r\nthey rustled and made a noise when the hand was passed over their\r\nsurfaces. They appeared two months after birth and fell off every\r\nwinter, to reappear each summer. In other respects the man was in very\r\ngood health. He had six children, all of whom were covered with\r\nexcrescences like himself. The hands of one of these children has been\r\nrepresented by Edwards in his \"Gleanings of Natural History.\" A picture\r\nof the hand of the father is shown in the fifty-ninth volume of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions.\r\n\r\nPettigrew mentions a man with warty elongations encasing his whole\r\nbody. At the parts where friction occurred the points of the\r\nelongations were worn off. This man was called \"the biped armadillo.\"\r\nHis great grandfather was found by a whaler in a wild state in Davis's\r\nStraits, and for four generations the male members of the family had\r\nbeen so encased. The females had normal skins. All the members of the\r\nwell-known family of Lambert had the body covered with spines. Two\r\nmembers, brothers, aged twenty-two and fourteen, were examined by\r\nGeoffroy-Saint-Hilaire.  This thickening of the epidermis and hair was\r\nthe effect of some morbid predisposition which was transmitted from\r\nfather to son, the daughters not being affected. Five generations could\r\nbe reckoned which had been affected in the manner described.\r\n\r\nThe \"porcupine-man\" seen by Baker contracted small-pox, and his skin\r\nwas temporarily freed from the squamae, but these reappeared shortly\r\nafterward. There are several older records of prickly men or\r\nporcupine-men. Ascanius mentions a porcupine-man, as do Buffon and\r\nSchreber. Autenreith speaks of a porcupine-man who was covered with\r\ninnumerable verrucae. Martin described a remarkable variety of\r\nichthyosis in which the skin was covered with strong hairs like the\r\nbristles of a boar. When numerous and thick the scales sometimes\r\nassumed a greenish-black hue. An example of this condition was the\r\nindividual who exhibited under the name of the \"alligator-boy.\" Figure\r\n286 represents an \"alligator-boy\" exhibited by C. T. Taylor. The skin\r\naffected in this case resembled in color and consistency that of a\r\nyoung alligator. It was remarked that his olfactory sense was intact.\r\n\r\nThe harlequin fetus, of which there are specimens in Guy's Hospital,\r\nLondon Hospital, and the Royal College of Surgeons Museum, is the\r\nresult of ichthyosis congenita. According to Crocker either after the\r\nremoval of the vernix caseosa, which may be thick, or as the skin dries\r\nit is noticeably red, smooth, shiny, and in the more severe cases\r\ncovered with actual plates.  In the harlequin fetus the whole surface\r\nof the body is thickly covered with fatty epidermic plates, about 1/16\r\ninch in thickness, which are broken up by horizontal and vertical\r\nfissures, and arranged transversely to the surface of the body like a\r\nloosely-built stone wall. After birth these fissures may extend down\r\ninto the corium, and on movement produce much pain.  The skin is so\r\nstiff and contracted that the eyes cannot be completely opened or shut,\r\nthe lips are too stiff to permit of sucking, and are often inverted;\r\nthe nose and ears are atrophied, the toes are contracted and cramped,\r\nand, if not born dead, the child soon dies from starvation and loss of\r\nheat. When the disease is less severe the child may survive some time.\r\nCrocker had a patient, a male child one month old, who survived three\r\nmonths. Hallopeau and Elliot also report similar cases.\r\n\r\nContagious follicular keratosis is an extremely rare affection in which\r\nthere are peculiar, spine-like outgrowths, consisting in exudations of\r\nthe mouths of the sebaceous glands. Leloir and Vidal shorten the name\r\nto acne cornee.\r\n\r\nErasmus Wilson speaks of it as ichthyosis sebacea cornea. H. G.  Brooke\r\ndescribes a case in a girl of six. The first sign had been an eruption\r\nof little black spots on the nape of the neck. These spots gradually\r\ndeveloped into papules, and the whole skin took on a dirty yellow\r\ncolor. Soon afterward the same appearances occurred on both shoulders,\r\nand, in the same order, spread gradually down the outer sides of the\r\narms--first black specks, then papules, and lastly pigmentation. The\r\nblack specks soon began to project, and comedo-like plugs and small,\r\nspine-like growths were produced. Both the spines and plugs were very\r\nhard and firmly-rooted. They resisted firm pressure with the forceps,\r\nand when placed on sheets of paper rattled like scraps of metal.  A\r\ndirect history of contagion was traced from this case to others.\r\n\r\nMibelli describes an uncommon form of keratodermia (porokeratosis). The\r\npatient was a man of twenty-one, and exhibited the following changes in\r\nhis skin: On the left side of the neck, beyond a few centimeters below\r\nthe lobe of the ear, there were about ten small warty patches,\r\nirregularly scattered, yellowish-brown in color, irregular in outline,\r\nand varying in size from a lentil to a half-franc piece, or rather\r\nmore. Similar patches were seen on other portions of the face. Patches\r\nof varying size and form, sharply limited by a kind of small,\r\nperipheral \"dike,\" sinuous but uninterrupted, of a color varying from\r\nred to whitish-red, dirty white, and to a hue but little different from\r\nthat of the healthy skin. Similar patches were seen on the right hand,\r\nand again on the back of the right hand was a wide space, prolonged\r\nupward in the form of a broad band on the posterior surface of the\r\nforearm to just below the olecranon, where the skin was a little\r\nsmoother and thinner than the surrounding skin, and altogether bare of\r\nhairs. The disease was noticed at the age of two, and gradually\r\nprogressed. The patient always enjoyed the most perfect health, but had\r\ncontracted syphilis three years before. A brother of the patient, aged\r\ntwenty-four, for sixteen years has had the same skin-affection as this\r\npatient, on the back of the hand, and the sister and father had noticed\r\nsimilar lesions.\r\n\r\nDiffuse symmetric scleroderma, or hide-bound disease, is quite rare,\r\nand presents itself in two phases: that of infiltration (more properly\r\ncalled hypertrophy) and atrophy, caused by shrinkage. The whole body\r\nmay be involved, and each joint may be fixed as the skin over it\r\nbecomes rigid. The muscles may be implicated independently of the skin,\r\nor simultaneously, and they give the resemblance of rigor mortis. The\r\nwhole skin is so hard as to suggest the idea of a frozen corpse,\r\nwithout the coldness, the temperature being only slightly subnormal.\r\nThe skin can neither be pitted nor pinched. As Crocker has well put it,\r\nwhen the face is affected it is gorgonized, so to speak, both to the\r\neye and to the touch. The mouth cannot be opened; the lids usually\r\nescape, but if involved they are half closed, and in either case\r\nimmovable. The effect of the disease on the chest-walls is to seriously\r\ninterfere with the respiration and to flatten and almost obliterate the\r\nbreasts; as to the limbs, from the shortening of the distended skin the\r\njoints are fixed in a more or less rigid position. The mucous membranes\r\nmay be affected, and the secretion of both sweat and sebum is\r\ndiminished in proportion to the degree of the affection, and may be\r\nquite absent. The atrophic type of scleroderma is preceded by an edema,\r\nand from pressure-atrophy of the fat and muscles the skin of the face\r\nis strained over the bones; the lips are shortened, the gums shrink\r\nfrom the teeth and lead to caries, and the nostrils are compressed. The\r\nstrained skin and the emotionless features (relieved only by\r\ntelangiectatic striae) give the countenance a ghastly, corpse-like\r\naspect. The etiology and pathology of this disease are quite obscure.\r\nHappily the prognosis is good, as there is a tendency to spontaneous\r\nrecovery, although the convalescence may be extended.\r\n\r\nAlthough regarded by many as a disease distinct from scleroderma,\r\nmorphea is best described as a circumscribed scleroderma, and presents\r\nitself in two clinical aspects: patches and bands, the patches being\r\nthe more common.\r\n\r\nScleroderma neonatorum is an induration of the skin, congenital and\r\noccurring soon after birth, and is invariably fatal. A disease somewhat\r\nanalogous is edema neonatorum, which is a subcutaneous edema with\r\ninduration affecting the new-born. If complete it is invariably fatal,\r\nbut in a few cases in which the process has been incomplete recovery\r\nhas occurred. Gerard reports recovery from a case of sclerema\r\nneonatorum in an infant five weeks old, which seemed in perfect health\r\nbut for this skin-affection. The back presented a remarkable induration\r\nwhich involved the entire dorsal aspect, including the deltoid regions,\r\nthe upper arms, the buttocks, and the thighs, down to and involving the\r\npopliteal spaces. The edges of the indurated skin were sharply defined,\r\nirregular, and map-like. The affected skin was stretched, but not\r\nshiny, and exhibited a pink mottling; it could not be pinched between\r\nthe fingers; pressure produced no pitting, but rendered the surface\r\npale for a time. The induration upon the buttocks had been noticed\r\nimmediately after birth, and the region was at first of a deep pink\r\ncolor. During the first nine days the trouble had extended to the\r\nthighs, but only shortly before the examination had it attacked the\r\narms.  Inunctions of codliver oil were at first used, but with little\r\nimprovement. Blue ointment was substituted, and improvement commenced.\r\nAs the induration cleared up, outlying patches of the affected skin\r\nwere left surrounded by normal integument. No pitting could be produced\r\neven after the tension of the skin had decreased during recovery. The\r\nlowest rectal temperature was 98 degrees F. In a little more than four\r\nmonths the skin became normal. The treatment with mercurial ointment\r\nwas stopped some time before recovery.\r\n\r\nPossibly the most interesting of the examples of skin-anomaly was the\r\n\"elephant-man\" of London. His real name was Merrick. He was born at\r\nLeicester, and gave an elaborate account of shock experienced by his\r\nmother shortly before his birth, when she was knocked down by an\r\nelephant at a circus; to this circumstance he attributed his\r\nunfortunate condition. He derived his name from a proboscis-like\r\nprojection of his nose and lips, together with a peculiar deformity of\r\nthe forehead. He was victimized by showmen during his early life, and\r\nfor a time was shown in Whitechapel Road, where his exhibition was\r\nstopped by the police. He was afterward shown in Belgium, and was there\r\nplundered of all his savings. The gruesome spectacle he presented\r\nostracized him from the pleasures of friendship and society, and\r\nsometimes interfered with his travels. On one occasion a steamboat\r\ncaptain refused to take him as a passenger. Treves exhibited him twice\r\nbefore the Pathological Society of London. His affection was not\r\nelephantiasis, but a complication of congenital hypertrophy of certain\r\nbones and pachydermatocele and papilloma of the skin.  From his youth\r\nhe suffered from a disease of the left hip-joint.  The papillary masses\r\ndeveloped on the skin of the back, buttock, and occiput. In the right\r\npectoral and posterior aspect of the right axillary region, and over\r\nthe buttocks, the affected skin hung in heavy pendulous flaps. His left\r\narm was free from disease. His head grew so heavy that at length he had\r\ngreat difficulty in holding it up. He slept in a sitting or crouching\r\nposition, with his hands clasped over his legs, and his head on his\r\nknees. If he lay down flat, the heavy head showed a tendency to fall\r\nback and produce a sense of suffocation. For a long time he was an\r\ninmate of the London Hospital, where special quarters were provided for\r\nhim, and it was there that he was found dead, April 11, 1890; while in\r\nbed his ponderous head had fallen backward and dislocated his neck.\r\n\r\nAinhum may be defined as a pathologic process, the ultimate result of\r\nwhich is a spontaneous amputation of the little toe. It is confined\r\nalmost exclusively to negroes, chiefly males, and of African descent.\r\nIn Brazil it is called \"ainham\" or \"quigila.\" \"Ainham\" literally means\r\nto saw, and is doubtless a colloquial name derived from a supposed\r\nslow, sawing process. The Hindoo name for it is \"sukha pakla,\" meaning\r\ndry suppuration.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 da Silva Lima of Bahia, at the Misericordia Hospital, gave the\r\nfirst reports of this curious disease, and for quite a period it was\r\nsupposed to be confined to Brazilian territory.  Since then, however,\r\nit has been reported from nearly every quarter of the globe. Relative\r\nto its geographic distribution, Pyle states that da Silva Lima and\r\nSeixas of Bahia have reported numerous cases in Brazil, as have\r\nFigueredo, Pereira, Pirovano, Alpin, and Guimares. Toppin reports it in\r\nPernambuco. Mr. Milton reports a case from Cairo, and Dr. Creswell at\r\nSuez, both in slaves. E. A. G. Doyle reports several cases at the\r\nFernando Hospital, Trinidad. Digby reports its prevalence on the west\r\ncoast of Africa, particularly among a race of negroes called Krumens.\r\nMessum reports it in the South African Republic, and speaks of its\r\nprevalence among the Kaffirs. Eyles reports it on the Gold Coast. It\r\nhas also been seen in Algiers and Madagascar.  Through the able efforts\r\nof Her Majesty's surgeons in India the presence of ainhum has been\r\nshown in India, and considerable investigation made as to its etiology,\r\npathologic histology, etc.  Wise at Dacca, Smyth and Crombie at\r\nCalcutta, Henderson at Bombay, and Warden, Sen, Crawford, and Cooper in\r\nother portions of Southern India have all rendered assistance in the\r\ninvestigation of ainhum. In China a case has been seen, and British\r\nsurgeons speak of it as occurring in Ceylon. Von Winckler presents an\r\nadmirable report of 20 cases at Georgetown, British Guiana. Dr.\r\nPotoppidan sends a report of a case in a negress on St. Thomas Island.\r\nThe disease has several times been observed in Polynesia.\r\n\r\nDr. Hornaday reports a case in a negress from North Carolina, and,\r\ncurious to relate, Horwitz of Philadelphia and Shepherd of Canada found\r\ncases in negroes both of North Carolina antecedents.  Dr. James Evans\r\nreports a case in a negro seventy-four years of age, at Darlington,\r\nS.C. Dr. R. H. Days of Baton Rouge, La., had a case in a negress, and\r\nDr. J. L. Deslates, also of Louisiana, reports four cases in St. James\r\nParish. Pyle has seen a case in a negress aged fifty years, at the\r\nEmergency Hospital in Washington.\r\n\r\nSo prevalent is the disease in India that Crawford found a case in\r\nevery 2500 surgical cases at the Indian hospitals. The absence of pain\r\nor inconvenience in many instances doubtless keeps the number of cases\r\nreported few, and again we must take into consideration the fact that\r\nthe class of persons afflicted with ainhum are seldom brought in\r\ncontact with medical men.\r\n\r\nThe disease usually affects the 5th phalanx at the interphalangeal\r\njoint. Cases of the 4th and other phalanges have been reported. Cooper\r\nspeaks of a young Brahman who lost his left great toe by this process.\r\nCrombie speaks of a simultaneous amputation of both fourth toes.\r\nPotoppidan reports a similar case in a negress on St. Thomas Island.\r\nSen reports a case in a supernumerary digit in a child, whose father, a\r\nHindoo, lost a toe by ainhum. Eyles reports a case in a negro in whom\r\nthe second finger was affected. Mirault, at Angiers, speaks of a case\r\nin which two fingers were lost in fifteen days, a fact which makes his\r\ndiagnosis dubious. Beranger-Ferraud has seen all the toes amputated,\r\nand there is a wax model by Baretta, Paris, in the Army Medical Museum\r\nat Washington, in which all the toes of the right foot have been\r\namputated, and the process is fast making progress at the middle third\r\nof the leg.\r\n\r\nAinhum is much more common in males than in females; it is, in fact,\r\ndistinctly rare in the latter. Of von Winckler's 20 cases all were\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nIt may occur at any age, but is most common between thirty and\r\nthirty-five. It has been reported in utero by Guyot, and was seen to\r\nextend up to the thigh, a statement that is most likely fallacious.\r\nHowever, there are well-authenticated cases in infants, and again in\r\npersons over seventy years of age.\r\n\r\nIn some few cases the metatarso-phalangeal joint is affected; but no\r\ncase has been seen at the base of the ungual phalanx. The duration of\r\nthe disease is between two and four years, but Dr. Evans's case had\r\nbeen in progress fifty years. It rarely runs its full course before a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAinhum begins as a small furrow or crack, such as soldiers often\r\nexperience, at the digito-plantar fold, seen first on the inner side.\r\nThis process of furrowing never advances in soldiers, and has been\r\ngiven a name more expressive than elegant. In ainhum the toe will swell\r\nin a few days, and a pain, burning or shooting in nature, may be\r\nexperienced in the foot and leg affected. Pain, however, is not\r\nconstant. There may be an erythematous eruption accompanying the\r\nswelling. The furrow increases laterally and in depth, and meets on the\r\ndorsal aspect of the toe, giving the toe the appearance of being\r\nconstricted by a piece of fine cord. As the furrow deepens the distal\r\nend of the toe becomes ovoid, and soon an appearance as of a marble\r\nattached to the toe by a fibrous pedicle presents itself. By this time\r\nthe swelling, if any, has subsided. The distal end of the toe bends\r\nunder the foot, and becomes twisted when walking, and causes\r\ninconvenience, and, unfortunately, says Eyles, it is in this last stage\r\nonly that the Fanti presents himself. There is in the majority of cases\r\na small ulcer in or near the digito-plantar fold, which causes most of\r\nthe pain, particularly when pressed upon. This ulcer does not occur\r\nearly, and is not constant. The case under Pyle's observation showed no\r\nulceration, and was absolutely painless, the negress applying for\r\ndiagnosis rather than treatment. The furrow deepens until spontaneous\r\namputation takes place, which rarely occurs, the patient generally\r\nhastening the process by his own operation, or by seeking surgical\r\ntreatment. A dry scab forms at the furrow, and when picked and repicked\r\nconstantly re-forms, being composed of horny desquamation or necrosis.\r\n\r\nThe histology of ainhum shows it to be a direct ingrowth of epithelium,\r\nwith a corresponding depression of surface due to a rapid hyperplasia\r\nthat pushes down and strangles the papillae, thus cutting off the blood\r\nsupply from the epithelial cells, causing them to undergo a horny\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nThe disease is not usually symmetric, as formerly stated, nor is it\r\nsimultaneous in different toes. There are no associated constitutional\r\nsymptoms, no tendency to similar morbid changes in other parts, and no\r\ninfiltration elsewhere. There is little or no edema with ainhum. In\r\nainhum there is, first, simple hypertrophy, then active hyperplasia The\r\npapillae degenerate when deprived of blood supply, and become horny.\r\nMeanwhile the pressure thus exerted on the nervi vasorum sets up\r\nvascular changes which bring about epithelial changes in more distant\r\nareas, the process advancing anteriorly, that is, in the direction of\r\nthe arteries.  This makes the cause, according to Eyles, an\r\ninflammatory and trophic phenomenon due mainly to changes following\r\npressure on the vasomotor nerves.\r\n\r\nEtiology.--The theories of the causation of ainhum are quite numerous.\r\nThe first cause is the admirable location for a furrow in the\r\ndigito-plantar fold, and the excellent situation of the furrow for the\r\nentrance of sand or other particles to make the irritation constant,\r\nthus causing chronic inflammatory changes, which are followed\r\nsubsequently by the changes peculiar to ainhum. The cause has been\r\nascribed to the practice of wearing rings on the toes; but von Winckler\r\nsays that in his locality (British Guinea) this practice is confined to\r\nthe coolie women, and in not one of his 20 cases had a ring been\r\npreviously worn on the toe; in fact all of the patients were males.\r\nDigby says, however, that the Krumens, among whom the disease is\r\ncommon, have long worn brass or copper rings on the fifth toe. Again\r\nthe natives of India, who are among those most frequently afflicted,\r\nhave no such custom.\r\n\r\nInjury, such as stone-bruise, has been attributed as the initial cause,\r\nand well-authenticated cases have been reported in which traumatism is\r\ndistinctly remembered; but Smyth, Weber, and several other observers\r\ndeny that habits, accidents, or work, are a feature in causation.\r\n\r\nVon During reports a curious case which he calls sclerodactylia\r\nannularis ainhumoides. The patient was a boy about twelve years old,\r\nborn in Erzeroum, brought for treatment for scabies, and not for the\r\naffection about to be described. A very defective history led to the\r\nbelief that a similar affection had not been observed in the family.\r\nWhen he was six years old it began on the terminal phalanges of the\r\nmiddle fingers. A myxomatous swelling attacked the phalanges and\r\neffected a complete absorption of the terminal phalanx. It did not\r\nadvance as far as gangrene or exfoliation of bone. At the time of\r\nreport the whole ten fingers were involved; the bones seemed to be\r\nthickened, the soft parts being indurated or sclerosed. In the right\r\nindex finger a completely sclerosed ring passed around the middle\r\nphalanx. The nails on the absorbed phalanges had become small and\r\nconsiderably thickened plates. No analogous changes were found\r\nelsewhere, and sensation was perfectly normal in the affected parts.\r\nThere were no signs whatever of a multiple neuritis nor of a leprous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThere is a rare and curious condition known as \"deciduous skin\" or\r\nkeratolysis, in which the owners possess a skin, which, like that of a\r\nserpent, is periodically cast off, that of the limbs coming off like\r\nthe finger of a glove. Preston of Canterbury, New Zealand, mentions the\r\ncase of a woman who had thus shed her skin every few weeks from the age\r\nof seven or even earlier. The woman was sixty-seven years of age; the\r\nskin in every part of the body came away in casts and cuticles which\r\nseparated entire and sometimes in one unbroken piece like a glove or\r\nstocking. Before each paroxysm she had an associate symptom of malaise.\r\nEven the skin of the nose and ears came off complete. None of the\r\npatient's large family showed this idiosyncrasy, and she said that she\r\nhad been told by a medical man that it had been due to catching cold\r\nafter an attack of small-pox. Frank mentions a case in which there was\r\nperiodic and complete shedding of the cuticle and nails of the hands\r\nand feet, which was repeated for thirty-three consecutive years on July\r\n24th of each year, and between the hours of 3 P.M. and 9 P.M. The\r\npatient remembered shedding for the first time while a child at play.\r\nThe paroxysms always commenced abruptly, constitutional febrile\r\nsymptoms were first experienced, and the skin became dry and hot. The\r\nacute symptoms subsided in three or four hours and were entirely gone\r\nin twelve hours, with the exception of the redness of the skin, which\r\ndid not disappear for thirty-six hours more. The patient had been\r\ndelirious during this period. The cuticle began to shed some time\r\nbetween the third and twelfth day, in large sheets, as pictured in the\r\naccompanying illustrations. The nails were shed in about four weeks\r\nafter the acute stage. Crocker had an instance of this nature in a man\r\nwith tylosis palmae, in which the skin was cast off every autumn, but\r\nthe process lasted two months. Lang observed a case in which the\r\nfingers alone were affected.\r\n\r\nThere is a case of general and habitual desquamation of the skin in the\r\nEphemerides of 1686; and Newell records a case which recovered under\r\nthe use of Cheltenham water for several seasons.  Latham describes a\r\nman of fifty who was first seized about ten years previously with a\r\nsingular kind of fever, and this returned many times afterward, even\r\ntwice in the course of the same year, attended with the same symptoms\r\nand circumstances, and appearing to be brought on by obstructed\r\nperspiration, in consequence of catching cold. Besides the common\r\nfebrile symptoms, upon the invasion of the disease his skin universally\r\nitched, more especially at the joints, and the itching was followed by\r\nmany little red spots, with a small degree of swelling. Soon after this\r\nhis fingers became stiff; hard, and painful at the ends, and at the\r\nroots of the nails. In about twenty-four hours the cuticle began to\r\nseparate from the cutis, and in ten or twelve days this separation was\r\ngeneral from head to foot, during which time he completely turned the\r\ncuticle off from the wrists to the fingers' ends like a glove, and in\r\nlike manner on the legs to the toes, after which his nails shot\r\ngradually from their roots, at first with exquisite pain, which abated\r\nas the separation of the cuticle advanced, and the old nails were\r\ngenerally thrown off by new ones in about six months. The cuticle rose\r\nin the palms and soles like blisters, having, however, no fluid\r\nbeneath, and when it came off it left the underlying cutis exposed for\r\na few days.  Sometimes, upon catching cold, before quite free from\r\nfeverish symptoms, a second separation of the cuticle from the cutis\r\noccurred, but it appeared so thin as to be like scurf, demonstrating\r\nthe quick renewal of the parts.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar case in the Philosophical Transactions in a miller\r\nof thirty-five who was exposed to great heat and clouds of dust. On the\r\nfirst cold a fever attacked him, and once or twice a year, chiefly in\r\nthe autumn, this again occurred, attended with a loosening and\r\ndetachment of the cuticle. The disorder began with violent fever,\r\nattended with pains in the head, back, limbs, retching, vomiting, dry\r\nskin, furred tongue, urgent thirst, constipation, and high-colored\r\nurine. Usually the whole surface of the body then became yellow. It\r\nafterward became florid like a rash, and then great uneasiness was felt\r\nfor several days, with general numbness and tingling; the urine then\r\nbegan to deposit a thick sediment. About the third week from the first\r\nattack the cuticle appeared elevated in many places, and in eight or\r\nten days afterward became so loose as to admit of its easy removal in\r\nlarge flakes. The cuticle of the hands, from the wrists to the fingers'\r\nends, came off like a glove. The patient was never disposed to sweat,\r\nand when it was attempted to force perspiration he grew worse; nor was\r\nhe much at ease until his urine deposited a sediment, after which he\r\nfelt little inconvenience but from the rigidity of the skin. The nails\r\nwere not detached as in the previous case.\r\n\r\nIt is quite natural that such cases as this should attract the\r\nattention of the laity, and often find report in newspapers. The\r\nfollowing is a lay-report of a \"snake-boy\" in Shepardstown, Va.:--\r\n\r\n\"Jim Twyman, a colored boy living with his foster-parents ten miles\r\nfrom this place, is a wonder. He is popularly known as the \"snake-boy.\"\r\nMentally he is as bright as any child of his age, and he is popular\r\nwith his playmates, but his physical peculiarities are probably\r\nunparalleled. His entire skin, except the face and hands, is covered\r\nwith the scales and markings of a snake. These exceptions are kept so\r\nby the constant use of Castile soap, but on the balance of his body the\r\nscales grow abundantly. The child sheds his skin every year. It causes\r\nhim no pain or illness. From the limbs it can be pulled in perfect\r\nshape, but off the body it comes in pieces. His feet and hands are\r\nalways cold and clammy. He is an inordinate eater, sometimes spending\r\nan hour at a meal, eating voraciously all the time, if permitted to do\r\nso. After these gorgings he sometimes sleeps two days. There is a\r\nstrange suggestion of a snake in his face, and he can manipulate his\r\ntongue, accompanied by hideous hisses, as viciously as a serpent.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the name of dermatitis exfoliativa neonatorum, Ritter has\r\ndescribed an eruption which he observed in the foundling asylum at\r\nPrague, where nearly 300 cases occurred in ten years.  According to\r\nCrocker it begins in the second or third week of life, and occasionally\r\nas late as the fifth week, with diffuse and universal scaling, which\r\nmay be branny or in laminae like pityriasis rubra, and either dry or\r\nwith suffusion beneath the epidermis. Sometimes it presents flaccid\r\nbullae like pemphigus foliaceus, and then there are crusts as well as\r\nscales, with rhagades on the mouth, anus, etc.; there is a total\r\nabsence of fever or other general symptoms. About 50 per cent die of\r\nmarasmus and loss of heat, with or without diarrhea. In those who\r\nrecover the surface gradually becomes pale and the desquamation ceases.\r\nOpinions differ regarding it, some considering it of septic origin,\r\nwhile others believe it to be nothing but pemphigus foliaceus. Kaposi\r\nregards it as an aggravation of the physiologic exfoliation of the\r\nnew-born. Elliott of New York reports two cases with a review of the\r\nsubject, but none have been reported in England. Cases on the Continent\r\nhave been described by Billard, von Baer, Caspary, those already\r\nmentioned, and others.\r\n\r\nThe name epidemic exfoliative dermatitis has been given to an epidemic\r\nskin-disease which made its appearance in 1891 in England; 425 cases\r\nwere collected in six institutions, besides sporadic cases in private\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, in London, some photographs and sketches were exhibited that\r\nwere taken from several of the 163 cases which occurred in the\r\nPaddington Infirmary and Workhouse, under the care of Dr. Savill, from\r\nwhose negatives they were prepared. They were arranged in order to\r\nillustrate the successive stages of the disorder. The eruption starts\r\nusually with discrete papules, often in stellate groups, and generally\r\narranged symmetrically when on the limbs. These become fused into\r\ncrimson, slightly raised maculae, which in severe cases become further\r\nfused into red thickened patches, in which the papules can still be\r\nfelt and sometimes seen. Vesicles form, and exudation occurs in only\r\nabout one-third of the cases. Desquamation of the epidermis is the\r\ninvariable feature of all cases, and it usually commences between the\r\nfourth and eighth days. In severe cases successive layers of the\r\nepidermis are shed, in larger or smaller scales, throughout the whole\r\ncourse of the malady. One-half of the epidermis shed from the hand of a\r\npatient is exhibited in this collection.\r\n\r\nOf sphaceloderma, or gangrene of the skin, probably the most\r\ninteresting is Raynaud's disease of symmetric gangrene, a vascular\r\ndisorder, which is seen in three grades of intensity: there is local\r\nsyncope, producing the condition known as dead-fingers or dead-toes,\r\nand analogous to that produced by intense cold; and local asphyxia,\r\nwhich usually follows local syncope, or may develop independently.\r\nChilblains are the mildest manifestation of this condition. The\r\nfingers, toes, and ears, are the parts usually affected. In the most\r\nextreme degree the parts are swollen, stiff, and livid, and the\r\ncapillary circulation is almost stagnant; this is local or symmetric\r\ngangrene, the mildest form of which follows asphyxia. Small areas of\r\nnecrosis appear on the pads of the fingers and of the toes; also at the\r\nedges of the ears and tip of the nose. Occasional symmetric patches\r\nappear on the limbs and trunk, and in extensive cases terminate in\r\ngangrene. Raynaud suggested that the local syncope was produced by\r\ncontraction of the vessels; the asphyxia is probably caused by a\r\ndilatation of the capillaries and venules, with persistence of the\r\nspasm of the arterioles. According to Osler two forms of congestion\r\noccur, which may be seen in adjacent fingers, one of which may be\r\nswollen, intensely red, and extremely hot; the other swollen, cyanotic,\r\nand intensely cold. Sometimes all four extremities are involved, as in\r\nSouthey's case, in a girl of two and a half in whom the process began\r\non the calves, after a slight feverish attack, and then numerous\r\npatches rapidly becoming gangrenous appeared on the backs of the legs,\r\nthighs, buttocks, and upper arms, worse where there was pressure; the\r\nchild died thirty-two hours after the onset. The whole phenomenon may\r\nbe unilateral, as in Smith's case, quoted by Crocker,--in a girl of\r\nthree years in whom the left hand was cold and livid, while on the\r\nright there was lividity, progressing to gangrene of the fingers and of\r\nthe thumb up to the first knuckles, where complete separation occurred.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of cases of apparently spontaneous gangrene of\r\nthe skin have been recorded in medical literature as occurring\r\ngenerally in hysteric young women. Crocker remarks that they are\r\ngenerally classified as erythema gangraenosum, and are always to be\r\nregarded with grave suspicion of being self-induced. Ehrl records an\r\ninteresting case of this nature with an accompanying illustration. The\r\npatient was a girl of eighteen whose face, left breast, anus, legs, and\r\nfeet became affected every autumn since her sixth year, after an attack\r\nof measles. At first the skin became red, then water-blisters formed,\r\nthe size of a grain of corn, and in three days reaching the size of a\r\nhazel-nut; these burst and healed, leaving no scars. The menses\r\nappeared at the fifteenth year, lasted eight days, with great loss of\r\nblood, but there was no subsequent menstruation, and no vicarious\r\nhemorrhage. Afterward the right half of the face became red for three\r\nor four weeks, with a disturbance of the sensibility of this part,\r\nincluding the right half of the mucosa of the mouth and the conjunctive\r\nof the right eye. At the seventeenth year the patient began to have a\r\nleft-sided headache and increased sweating of the right half of the\r\nbody. In 1892 the periodically-appearing skin-affection became worse.\r\nInstead of healing, the broken vessels became blackish and healed\r\nslowly, leaving ulcers, granulations, and scars, and the gangrenous\r\ntendency of the skin increased. Disturbance of the sight shortly\r\nintervened, associated with aphonia. The sensibility of the whole body,\r\nwith the exception of the face, was greatly impaired, and there was\r\ntrue gangrene of the corium. A younger sister of the patient was\r\nsimilarly affected with symptoms of hysteria, hemianesthesia, etc.\r\n\r\nNeuroses of the skin consist in augmentation of sensibility or\r\nhyperesthesia and diminution of sensibility or anesthesia. There are\r\nsome curious old cases of loss of sensation. Ferdinandus mentions a\r\ncase of a young man of twenty-four who, after having been seized with\r\ninsensibility of the whole body with the exception of the head, was\r\ncured by purgatives and other remedies. Bartholinus cites the case of a\r\nyoung man who lost the senses of taste and feeling; and also the case\r\nof a young girl who could permit the skin of her forehead to be pricked\r\nand the skin of her neck to be burned without experiencing any pain. In\r\nhis \"Surgery\" Lamothe mentions a case of insensibility of the hands and\r\nfeet in consequence of a horse-kick in the head without the infliction\r\nof any external wound. In the \"Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences\" for\r\nthe year 1743, we read an account of a soldier who, after having\r\naccidentally lost all sensation in his left arm, continued to go\r\nthrough the whole of the manual exercise with the same facility as\r\never. It was also known that La Condamine was able to use his hands for\r\nmany years after they had lost their sensation. Rayer gives a case of\r\nparalysis of the skin of the left side of the trunk without any\r\naffection of the muscles, in a man of forty-three of apoplectic\r\nconstitution. The paralysis extended from the left mammary region to\r\nthe haunch, and from the vertebrae to the linea alba. Throughout this\r\nwhole extent the skin was insensible and could be pinched or even\r\npunctured without the patient being aware that he was even touched. The\r\nparts did not present any perceptible alteration in texture or in\r\ncolor. The patient was free from fever and made no complaint except a\r\nslight headache. Rayer quotes another case in a man of sixty who had\r\nbeen bitten three years previously by a dog that was not mad. He was\r\ngreatly frightened by the accident and every time he saw a dog he\r\ntrembled violently, and on one occasion he suffered a convulsive attack\r\nfor one and a half hours. The convulsions increased in number and\r\nfrequency, he lost his memory, and exhibited other signs of incipient\r\ndementia. He was admitted to the hospital with two small wounds upon\r\nthe head, one above the left eyebrow and the other on the scalp,\r\noccasioned by a fall on his entrance into the hospital. For several\r\ndays a great degree of insensibility of the skin of the whole body was\r\nobserved without any implication of the power of voluntary motion. He\r\nwas entirely cured in eighteen days.\r\n\r\nDuhring reports a very rare form of disease of the skin, which may be\r\ndesignated neuroma cutis dolorosum, or painful neuroma of the skin. The\r\npatient was a boiler-maker of seventy who had no family history bearing\r\non the disease. Ten years previously a few cutaneous tubercles the size\r\nand shape of a split-pea were noticed on the left shoulder, attended\r\nwith decided itching but not with pain. The latter symptom did not come\r\non until three years later. In the course of a year or two the lesions\r\nincreased in number, so that in four years the shoulder and arm were\r\nthickly studded with them. During the next five years no particular\r\nchanges occurred either in lesions or in the degree of pain. The region\r\naffected simply looked like a solid sheet of variously-sized,\r\nclosely-packed, confluent tubercles, hard and dense. The tubercles were\r\nat all times painful to the touch, and even the contact of air was\r\nsufficient to cause great suffering.  During the paroxysms, which\r\noccurred usually at several short intervals every day, the skin changed\r\ncolor frequently and rapidly, passing through various reddish and\r\nviolet tints, at times becoming purplish.\r\n\r\nAs a paroxysm came on the man was in the habit of gently pressing and\r\nholding the arm closely to his body. At one time he endured the attack\r\nin a standing posture, walking the floor, but usually he seated himself\r\nvery near a hot stove, in a doubled-up, cramped position, utterly\r\nunmindful of all surroundings, until the worst pain had ceased.\r\nFrequently he was unable to control himself, calling out piteously and\r\nvehemently and beseeching that his life be terminated by any means. In\r\ndesperation he often lay and writhed on the floor in agony. The intense\r\nsuffering lasted, as a rule, for about a half hour, but he was never\r\nwithout pain of the neuralgic type. He was freer of pain in summer than\r\nin winter.  Exsection of the brachial plexus was performed, but gave\r\nonly temporary relief. The man died in his eighty-fourth year of senile\r\ndebility.\r\n\r\nAccording to Osler the tubercula dolorosa or true fascicular neuroma is\r\nnot always made up of nerve-fibers, but, as shown by Hoggan, may be an\r\nadenomatous growth of the sweat-glands.\r\n\r\nYaws may be defined as an endemic, specific, and contagious disease,\r\ncharacterized by raspberry-like nodules with or without constitutional\r\ndisturbance. Its synonym, frambesia, is from the French, framboise, a\r\nraspberry. Yaws is derived from a Carib word, the meaning of which is\r\ndoubtful. It is a disease confined chiefly to tropical climates, and is\r\nfound on the west coast of Africa for about ten degrees on each side of\r\nthe equator, and also on the east coast in the central regions, but\r\nrarely in the north. It is also found in Madagascar, Mozambique,\r\nCeylon, Hindoostan, and nearly all the tropical islands of the world.\r\nCrocker believes it probable that the button-scurvy of Ireland, now\r\nextinct, but described by various writers of 1823 to 1857 as a\r\ncontagious disease which was prevalent in the south and in the interior\r\nof the island, was closely allied to yaws, if not identical with it.\r\nThe first mention of the yaws disease is by Oviedo, in 1535, who met\r\nwith it in San Domingo. Although Sauvages at the end of the last\r\ncentury was the first to give an accurate description of this disease,\r\nmany physicians had observed it before.\r\n\r\nFrambesia or yaws was observed in Brazil as early as 1643, and in\r\nAmerica later by Lebat in 1722. In the last century Winterbottom and\r\nHume describe yaws in Africa, Hume calling it the African distemper. In\r\n1769 in an essay on the \"Natural History of Guiana,\" Bancroft mentions\r\nyaws; and Thomson speaks of it in Jamaica. Hillary in 1759 describes\r\nyaws in Barbadoes; and Bajou in Domingo and Cayenne in 1777, Dazille\r\nhaving already observed it in San Domingo in 1742.\r\n\r\nCrocker takes his account of yaws from Numa Rat of the Leeward Islands,\r\nwho divides the case into four stages: incubation, primary, secondary,\r\nand tertiary. The incubation stage is taken from the date of infection\r\nto the first appearance of the local lesion at the sight of\r\ninoculation. It varies from three to ten weeks. The symptoms are vague,\r\npossibly palpitation, vertigo, edema of the limbs and eyelids. The\r\nprimary stage begins with the initial lesion, which consists of a\r\npapule which may be found most anywhere on the body. This papule\r\nulcerates. The secondary stage commences about a fortnight after the\r\npapule has healed.  There is intermittent fever, headache, backache,\r\nand shooting pains in the limbs and intercostal spaces, like those of\r\ndengue, with nocturnal exacerbations. An eruption of minute red spots\r\nappears first on the face, and gradually extends so that the whole body\r\nis covered at the end of three days. By the seventh day the apex of the\r\npapule is of a pale yellow color, and the black skin has the appearance\r\nof being dotted over with yellow wax. The papule then develops into\r\nnodules of cylindric shape, with a dome-shaped, thick, yellow crust. It\r\nis only with the crust off that there is any resemblance to a\r\nraspberry. During the month following the raspberry appearance the skin\r\nis covered with scabs which, falling off, leave a pale macula; in dark\r\nraces the macula becomes darker than normal, but in pale races it\r\nbecomes paler than the natural skin, and in neither case is it scarcely\r\never obliterated. Intense itching is almost always present, and anemia\r\nis also a constant symptom. The disease is essentially contagious and\r\noccurs at all ages and among all sexes, to a lesser degree in whites\r\nand hybrids, and is never congenital. It seems to have a tendency to\r\nundergo spontaneous recovery.\r\n\r\nFurunculus orientalis, or its synonyms, Oriental boil, Aleppo boil,\r\nDelhi boil, Biskra button, etc., is a local disease occurring chiefly\r\non the face and other uncovered spots, endemic in limited districts in\r\nhot climates, characterized by the formation of a papule, a nodule, and\r\na scab, and beneath the last a sharply punched-out ulcer. Its different\r\nnames indicate the districts in which it is common, nearly always in\r\ntropical or subtropical climates. It differs from yaws in the absence\r\nof febrile symptoms, in its unity, its occurrence often on the feet and\r\nthe backs of the hands, its duration, and the deep scar which it\r\nleaves. A fatal issue is rare, but disfiguring and disabling cicatrices\r\nmay be left unless great care is employed.\r\n\r\nPigmentary Processes.--Friction, pressure, or scratching, if long\r\ncontinued, may produce extensive and permanent pigmentation. This is\r\nseen in its highest degree in itching diseases like prurigo and\r\npityriasis. Greenhow has published instances of this kind under the\r\nname of \"vagabond's disease,\" a disease simulating morbus addisonii,\r\nand particularly found in tramps and vagrants.  In aged people this\r\ncondition is the pityriasis nigra of Willan.  According to Crocker in\r\ntwo cases reported by Thibierge, the oral mucous membrane was also\r\nstained. Carrington and Crocker both record cases of permanent\r\npigmentation following exposure to great cold. Gautier is accredited\r\nwith recording in 1890 the case of a boy of six in whom pigmented\r\npatches from sepia to almost black began to form at the age of two, and\r\nwere distributed all over the body. Precocious maturity of the genital\r\norgans preceded and accompanied the pigmentation, but the hair was illy\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nChloasma uterinum presents some interesting anomalies. Swayne records a\r\nsingular variety in a woman in whom, during the last three months of\r\nthree successive pregnancies, the face, arms, hands, and legs were\r\nspotted like a leopard, and remained so until after her confinement.\r\nCrocker speaks of a lady of thirty whose skin during each pregnancy\r\nbecame at first bronze, as if it had been exposed to a tropical sun,\r\nand then in spots almost black. Kaposi knew a woman with a pigmented\r\nmole two inches square on the side of the neck, which became quite\r\nblack at each pregnancy, and which was the first recognizable sign of\r\nher condition. It is quite possible that the black disease of the Garo\r\nHills in Assam is due to extreme and acute development of a pernicious\r\nform of malaria. In chronic malaria the skin may be yellowish, from a\r\nchestnut-brown to a black color, after long exposure to the influence\r\nof the fever. Various fungi, such as tinea versicolor and the Mexican\r\n\"Caraati,\" may produce discoloration on the skin.\r\n\r\nAcanthosis Nigricans may be defined as a general pigmentation with\r\npapillary mole-like growths. In the \"International Atlas of Rare Skin\r\nDiseases\" there are two cases pictured, one by Politzer in a woman of\r\nsixty-two, and the other by Janovsky in a man of forty-two. The regions\r\naffected were mostly of a dirty-brown color, but in patches of a\r\nbluish-gray. The disease began suddenly in the woman, but gradually in\r\nthe man. Crocker has reported a case somewhat similar to these two,\r\nunder the head of general bronzing without constitutional symptoms, in\r\na Swedish sailor of twenty-two, with rapid onset of pigmentation.\r\n\r\nXeroderma pigmentosum, first described by Kaposi in 1870, is a very\r\nrare disease, but owing to its striking peculiarities is easily\r\nrecognized. Crocker saw the first three cases in England, and describes\r\none as a type. The patient was a girl of twelve, whose general health\r\nand nutrition were good. The disease began when she was between twelve\r\nand eighteen months old, without any premonitory symptom. The disease\r\noccupied the parts habitually uncovered in childhood. The whole of\r\nthese areas was more or less densely speckled with pigmented,\r\nfreckle-like spots, varying in tint from a light, raw umber to a deep\r\nsepia, and in size from a pin's head to a bean, and of a roundish and\r\nirregular shape.  Interspersed among the pigment-spots, but not so\r\nnumerous, were white atrophic spots, which in some parts coalesced,\r\nforming white, shining, cicatrix-like areas. The skin upon this was\r\nfinely wrinkled, and either smooth or shiny, or covered with thin,\r\nwhite scales. On these white areas bright red spots were conspicuous,\r\ndue to telangiectasis, and there were also some stellate vascular spots\r\nand strife interspersed among the pigment. Small warts were seen\r\nspringing up from some of the pigment spots. These warts ulcerated and\r\ngave rise to numerous superficial ulcerations, covered with yellow\r\ncrusts, irregularly scattered over the face, mostly on the right side.\r\nThe pus coming from these ulcers was apparently innocuous. The patient\r\ncomplained neither of itching nor of pain. Archambault has collected 60\r\ncases, and gives a good resume to date. Amiscis reports two cases of\r\nbrothers, in one of whom the disease began at eight months, and in the\r\nother at a year, and concludes that it is not a lesion due to external\r\nstimuli or known parasitic elements, but must be regarded as a\r\nspecific, congenital dystrophy of the skin, of unknown pathogenesis.\r\nHowever, observations have shown that it may occur at forty-three years\r\n(Riehl), and sixty-four years (Kaposi). Crocker believes that the\r\ndisease is an atrophic degeneration of the skin, dependent on a primary\r\nneurosis, to which there is a congenital predisposition.\r\n\r\nNigrities is a name given by the older writers to certain black\r\nblotches occurring on the skin of a white person--in other words, it is\r\na synonym of melasma. According to Rayer it is not uncommon to see the\r\nscrotum and the skin of the penis of adults almost black, so as to form\r\na marked contrast with the pubes and the upper part of the thighs.\r\nHaller met with a woman in whom the skin of the pubic region was as\r\nblack as that of a negress.  During nursing the nipples assume a deep\r\nblack color which disappears after weaning. Le Cat speaks of a woman of\r\nthirty years, whose forehead assumed a dusky hue of the color of iron\r\nrust when she was pregnant about the seventh month. By degrees the\r\nwhole face became black except the eyes and the edges of the lips,\r\nwhich retained their natural color. On some days this hue was deeper\r\nthan on others; the woman being naturally of a very fair complexion had\r\nthe appearance of an alabaster figure with a black marble head. Her\r\nhair, which was naturally exceedingly dark, appeared coarser and\r\nblacker. She did not suffer from headache, and her appetite was good.\r\nAfter becoming black, the face was very tender to the touch. The black\r\ncolor disappeared two days after her accouchement, and following a\r\nprofuse perspiration by which the sheets were stained black. Her child\r\nwas of a natural color. In the following pregnancy, and even in the\r\nthird, the same phenomenon reappeared in the course of the seventh\r\nmonth; in the eighth month it disappeared, but in the ninth month this\r\nwoman became the subject of convulsions, of which she had one each day.\r\nThe existence of accidental nigrities rests on well-established facts\r\nwhich are distinctly different from the pigmentation of purpura,\r\nicterus, or that produced by metallic salts. Chomel quotes the case of\r\na very apathic old soldier, whose skin, without any appreciable cause,\r\nbecame as brown as that of a negro in some parts, and a yellowish-brown\r\nin others. Rustin has published the case of a woman of seventy who\r\nbecame as black as a negress in a single night. Goodwin relates the\r\ncase of an old maiden lady whose complexion up to the age of twenty-one\r\nwas of ordinary whiteness, but then became as black as that of an\r\nAfrican. Wells and Rayer have also published accounts of cases of\r\naccidental nigrities. One of the latter cases was a sailor of\r\nsixty-three who suffered from general nigrities, and the other was in a\r\nwoman of thirty, appearing after weaning and amenorrhea.\r\n\r\nMitchell Bruce has described an anomalous discoloration of the skin and\r\nmucous membranes resembling that produced by silver or cyanosis. The\r\npatient, a harness-maker of forty-seven, was affected generally over\r\nthe body, but particularly in the face, hands, and feet. The\r\nconjunctival, nasal, and aural mucosa were all involved. The skin felt\r\nwarm, and pressure did not influence the discoloration. The pains\r\ncomplained of were of an intermittent, burning, shooting character,\r\nchiefly in the epigastric and left lumbar regions. The general health\r\nwas good, and motion and sensation were normal. Nothing abnormal was\r\ndiscovered in connection with the abdominal and thoracic examinations.\r\nThe pains and discoloration had commenced two years before his\r\nadmission, since which time the skin had been deepening in tint. He\r\nremained under observation for three months without obvious change in\r\nhis symptoms. There was nothing in the patient's occupation to account\r\nfor the discoloration. A year and a half previously he had taken\r\nmedicine for his pains, but its nature could not be discovered. He had\r\nhad syphilis.\r\n\r\nGaltier mentions congenital and bronze spots of the skin. A man born in\r\nSwitzerland the latter part of the last century, calling himself Joseph\r\nGalart, attracted the attention of the curious by exhibiting himself\r\nunder the name of the \"Living Angel.\" He presented the following\r\nappearance: The skin of the whole posterior part of the trunk, from the\r\nnape of the neck to the loins, was of a bronze color. This color\r\nextended over the shoulders and the sides of the neck, and this part\r\nwas covered with hairs of great fineness and growing very thick; the\r\nskin of the rest of the body was of the usual whiteness. Those parts\r\nwere the darkest which were the most covered with hair; on the back\r\nthere was a space of an inch in diameter, which had preserved its\r\nwhiteness, and where the hairs were fewer in number, darker at their\r\nbases, and surrounded by a very small black circle; the hair was\r\nthinner at the sides of the neck; there were a great many individual\r\nhairs surrounded by circles of coloring matter; but there were also\r\nmany which presented nothing of this colored areola. In some places the\r\ngeneral dark color of the skin blended with the areola surrounding the\r\nroots of the hair, so that one uniform black surface resulted. In many\r\nplaces the dark color changed into black. The irides were brown. The\r\nman was of very unstable character, extremely undecided in all his\r\nundertakings, and had a lively but silly expression of countenance. A\r\ndistinct smell, as of mice, with a mixture of a garlicky odor, was\r\nemitted from those parts where the excessive secretion of the coloring\r\nmatter took place. In those places the heat was also greater than\r\nnatural. Rayer recites the case of a young man whom he saw, whose\r\neyelids and adjacent parts of the cheeks were of a bluish tint, similar\r\nto that which is produced on the skin by the explosion of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nBillard has published an extraordinary case of blue discoloration of\r\nthe skin in a young laundress of sixteen. Her neck, face, and upper\r\npart of the chest showed a beautiful blue tint, principally spreading\r\nover the forehead, the alae, and the mouth. When these parts were\r\nrubbed with a white towel the blue parts of the skin were detached on\r\nthe towel, coloring it, and leaving the skin white. The girl's lips\r\nwere red, the pulse was regular and natural, and her strength and\r\nappetite like that of a person in health. The only morbid symptom was a\r\ndry cough, but without mucous rattle or any deficiency of the sound of\r\nthe chest or alteration of the natural beat of the heart. The catamenia\r\nhad never failed. She had been engaged as a laundress for the past two\r\nyears. From the time she began this occupation she perceived a blueness\r\naround her eyes, which disappeared however on going into the air. The\r\nphenomenon reappeared more particularly when irons were heated by a\r\nbright charcoal fire, or when she worked in a hot and confined place.\r\nThe blueness spread, and her breast and abdomen became shaded with an\r\nazure blue, which appeared deeper or paler as the circulation was\r\naccelerated or retarded.  When the patient's face should have blushed,\r\nthe face became blue instead of red. The changes exhibited were like\r\nthe sudden transition of shades presented by the chameleon. The\r\nposterior part of the trunk, the axillae, the sclerotic coats of the\r\neyes, the nails, and the skin of the head remained in their natural\r\nstate and preserved their natural color. The linen of the patient was\r\nstained blue. Chemical analysis seemed to throw no light on this case,\r\nand the patient improved on alkaline treatment. She vomited blood,\r\nwhich contained sufficient of the blue matter to stain the sides of the\r\nvessel. She also stated that in hemorrhage from the nose she had seen\r\nblue drops among the drops of blood.  One cannot but suspect indigo as\r\na factor in the causation of this anomalous coloration.\r\n\r\nArtificial discolorations of the skin are generally produced by\r\ntattooing, by silver nitrate, mercury, bismuth, or some other metallic\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nMelasma has been designated as an accidental and temporary blackish\r\ndiscoloration of the skin. There are several varieties: that called\r\nAddison's disease, that due to uterine disease, etc.  In this affection\r\nthe skin assumes a dark and even black hue.\r\n\r\nLeukoderma is a pathologic process, the result of which is a deficiency\r\nin the normal pigmentation of the skin, and possibly its appendages.\r\nIts synonyms are leukopathia, vitiligo, achroma, leukasmus, and\r\nchloasma album. In India the disease is called sufaid-korh, meaning\r\nwhite leprosy. It has numerous colloquial appellations, such as chumba\r\nor phoolyree (Hindoo), buras (Urdu), cabbore (Singalese), kuttam\r\n(Taneil), dhabul (Bengal). It differs from albinism in being an\r\nacquired deficiency of pigment, not universal and not affecting the\r\neye. Albinism is congenital, and the hair and eyes are affected as well\r\nas the skin.\r\n\r\nThe disease is of universal distribution, but is naturally more\r\nnoticeable in the dark-skinned races. It is much more common in this\r\ncountry among the negroes than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nThe \"leopard-boy of Africa,\" so extensively advertised by dime museums\r\nover the country, was a well-defined case of leukoderma in a young\r\nmulatto, a fitting parallel for the case of ichthyosis styled the\r\n\"alligator-boy.\"\r\n\r\nFigure 293 represents a family of three children, all the subjects of\r\nleukoderma. Leukoderma is more common among females.  It is rarely seen\r\nin children, being particularly a disease of middle age. Bissell\r\nreports a case in an Indian ninety years of age, subsequent to an\r\nattack of rheumatism thirty years previous.  It is of varying duration,\r\nnearly every case giving a different length of time. It may be\r\nassociated with most any disease, and is directly attributable to none.\r\nIn a number of cases collected rheumatism has been a marked feature. It\r\nhas been noticed following typhoid fever and pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn white persons there are spots or blotches of pale, lustreless\r\nappearance either irregular or symmetric, scattered over the body. In\r\nthe negro and other dark-skinned races a mottled appearance is seen. If\r\nthe process goes to completion, the whole surface changes to white. The\r\nhair, though rarely affected, may present a mottled appearance. There\r\nseems to be no constitutional disturbances, no radical change in the\r\nskin, no pain--in fact, no disturbance worthy of note. The eye is not\r\naffected; but in a negro the sclerotic generally appears muddy.\r\n\r\nIt appears first in small spots, either on the lips, nose, eyelids,\r\nsoles, palms, or forehead, and increases peripherally--the several\r\nspots fusing together. The skin is peculiarly thin and easily\r\nirritated. Exposure to the sun readily blisters it, and after the\r\nslightest abrasion it bleeds freely.  Several cases have been reported\r\nin which the specific gravity of the urine was extremely high, due to\r\nan excess of urea. Wood calls attention to the wave-like course of\r\nleukoderma, receding on one side, increasing on the other. The fading\r\nis gradual, and the margins may be abrupt or diffuse. The mucous\r\nmembranes are rosy. The functions of the swell-glands are unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the absence of pigment causing a loss of the olfactory\r\nsense, spoken of by Wallace, is not borne out by several observations\r\nof Wood and others. Wilson says: \"Leukasma is a neurosis, the result of\r\nweakened innervation of the skin, the cause being commonly referable to\r\nthe organs of assimilation or reproduction.\" It is not a dermatitis, as\r\na dermatitis usually causes deposition of pigment. The rays of the sun\r\nbronze the skin; mustard, cantharides, and many like irritants cause a\r\ndermatitis, which is accompanied by a deposition of pigment.\r\nLeukoderma is as common in housemaids as in field-laborers, and is in\r\nno way attributable to exposure of sun or wind. True leukodermic\r\npatches show no vascular changes, no infiltration, but a partial\r\nobliteration of the rete mucosum. It has been ascribed to syphilis; but\r\nsyphilitic leukoderma is generally the result of cicatrices following\r\nsyphilitic ulceration.\r\n\r\nMany observers have noticed that negroes become several degrees lighter\r\nafter syphilization; but no definite relation between syphilis and\r\nleukoderma has yet been demonstrated in this race.  Postmortem\r\nexaminations of leukodermic persons show no change in the suprarenal\r\ncapsule, a supposed organ of pigmentation.\r\n\r\nClimate has no influence. It is seen in the Indians of the Isthmus of\r\nDarien, the Hottentots, and the Icelanders. Why the cells of the rete\r\nmucosum should have the function in some races of manufacturing or\r\nattracting pigment in excess of those of other races, is in itself a\r\nmystery. By his experiments on the pigment-cells of a frog Lister has\r\nestablished the relation existing between these elements and\r\ninnervation, which formerly had been supposititious.\r\n\r\nDoubtless a solution of the central control of pigmentation would\r\nconfirm the best theory of the cause of leukoderma--i.e., faulty\r\ninnervation of the skin. At present, whether the fault is in the cell\r\nproper, the conducting media, or the central center, we are unable to\r\nsay. It is certainly not due to any vascular disturbances, as the skin\r\nshows no vascular changes.\r\n\r\nWhite spots on the nails are quite common, especially on young people.\r\nThe mechanic cause is the presence of air between the lamellae of the\r\naffected parts, but their origin is unknown.  According to Crocker in\r\nsome cases they can be shown to be a part of trophic changes.\r\nBielschowsky records the case of a man with peripheral neuritis, in\r\nwhom white spots appeared at the lower part of the finger-nails, grew\r\nrapidly, and in three weeks coalesced into a band across each nail a\r\nmillimeter wide. The toes were not affected. Shoemaker mentions a\r\npatient who suffered from relapsing fever and bore an additional band\r\nfor each relapse. Crocker quotes a case reported by Morison of\r\nBaltimore, in which transverse bars of white, alternating with the\r\nnormal color, appeared without ascertainable cause on the finger-nails\r\nof a young lady and remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nGiovannini describes a case of canities unguium in a patient of\r\ntwenty-nine, following an attack of typhoid fever. On examining the\r\nhands of this patient the nails showed in their entire extent a white,\r\nopaque, almost ivory color. An abnormal quantity of air found in the\r\ninterior of the nails explains in this particular case their impaired\r\nappearance. It is certain that the nails, in order to have admitted\r\nsuch a large quantity of air into their interior must have altered in\r\ntheir intimate structure; and Giovannini suggests that they were\r\nsubject to an abnormal process of keratinization. Unna describes a\r\nsimilar case, which, however, he calls leukonychia.\r\n\r\nPlica polonica, or, as it was known in Cracow--weicselzopf, is a\r\ndisease peculiar to Poland, or to those of Polish antecedents,\r\ncharacterized by the agglutination, tangling, and anomalous development\r\nof the hair, or by an alteration of the nails, which become spongy and\r\nblackish. In older days the disease was well known and occupied a\r\nprominent place in books on skin-diseases.  Hercules de Saxonia and\r\nThomas Minadous, in 1610, speak of plica as a disease already long\r\nknown. The greater number of writers fix the date of its appearance in\r\nPoland at about the year 1285, under the reign of Lezekle-Noir.\r\nLafontaine stated that in the provinces of Cracow and Sandomir plica\r\nformerly attacked the peasantry, beggars, and Jews in the proportion of\r\n1 1/2 in 20; and the nobility and burghers in the proportion of two in\r\n30 or 40. In Warsaw and surrounding districts the disease attacked the\r\nfirst classes in the proportion of one to ten, and in the second\r\nclasses one to 30. In Lithuania the same proportions were observed as\r\nin Warsaw; but the disease has gradually grown rarer and rarer to the\r\npresent day, although occasional cases are seen even in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nPlica has always been more frequent on the banks of the Vistula and\r\nBorysthenes, in damp and marshy situations, than in other parts of\r\nPoland. The custom formerly prevailing in Poland of shaving the heads\r\nof children, neglect of cleanliness, the heat of the head-dress, and\r\nthe exposure of the skin to cold seem to favor the production of this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nPlica began after an attack of acute fever, with pains like those of\r\nacute rheumatism in the head and extremities, and possibly vertigo,\r\ntinnitus aurium, ophthalmia, or coryza. Sometimes a kind of redness was\r\nobserved on the thighs, and there was an alteration of the nails, which\r\nbecame black and rough, and again, there was clammy sweat. When the\r\nscalp was affected the head was sore to the touch and excessively\r\nitchy. A clammy and agglutinating sweat then occurred over the cranium,\r\nthe hair became unctuous, stuck together, and appeared distended with\r\nan adhesive matter of reddish-brown color, believed by many observers\r\nto be sanguineous. The hair was so acutely sensitive that the slightest\r\ntouch occasioned severe pain at the roots. A viscid matter of a very\r\noffensive smell, like that of spoiled vinegar, or according to Rayer\r\nlike that of mice or garlic, exuded from the whole surface of each\r\naffected hair. This matter glued the hairs together, at first from\r\ntheir exit at the skin, and then along the entire length; it appeared\r\nto be secreted from the whole surface of the scalp and afterward dried\r\ninto an incrustation. If there was no exudation the disease was called\r\nplica sicca. The hair was matted and stuck together in a variety of\r\nways, so as to resemble ropes (plica multiformis). Sometimes these\r\nmasses united together and formed one single thick club like the tail\r\nof a horse (plica caudiformis). Again, and particularly in females, the\r\nhair would become matted and glued together into one uniform intricate\r\nmass of various magnitudes.  The hair of the whole body was likely to\r\nbe attacked with this disease. Kalschmidt of Jena possessed the pubes\r\nof a woman dead of plica, the hair of which was of such length that it\r\nmust have easily gone around the body. There was formerly a\r\nsuperstition that it was dangerous to cut the hair until the discharge\r\ndiminished. Lafontaine, Schlegel, and Hartman all assure us that the\r\nsection of the affected masses before this time has been known to be\r\nfollowed by amaurosis, convulsions, apoplexy, epilepsy, and even death.\r\nAlarmed or taught by such occurrences, the common people often went\r\nabout all their lives with the plica gradually dropping off. Formerly\r\nthere was much theorizing and discussion regarding the etiology and\r\npathology of plica, but since this mysterious affection has been proved\r\nto be nothing more than the product of neglect, and the matting due to\r\nthe inflammatory exudation, excited by innumerable pediculi,\r\nagglutinating the hair together, the term is now scarcely mentioned in\r\ndermatologic works. Crocker speaks of a rare form which he entitles\r\nneuropathic plica, and cites two cases, one reported by Le Page whose\r\nspecimen is in the Royal College of Surgeons Museum; and the other was\r\nin a Hindoo described by Pestonji. Both occurred in young women, and in\r\nboth it came on after washing the hair in warm water, one in a few\r\nminutes, and the other in a few hours. The hair was drawn up into a\r\nhard tangled lump, impossible to unravel, limited to the right side in\r\nLe Page's patient, who had very long hair, and in Pestonji's case to\r\nthe back of the head, where on each side was an elongated mass, very\r\nhard and firm, like a rope and about the size of the fist. There was no\r\nreason to believe that it was ascribable to imposture; the Hindoo woman\r\ncut the lumps off herself and threw them away. Le Page found the most\r\ncontracted hairs flattened.  Stellwagon reports a case of plica in a\r\nwoman. It occupied a dollar-sized area above the nape of the neck, and\r\nin twelve years reached the length of 12 feet. There was no history of\r\nits manner of onset.\r\n\r\nTinea nodosa is a name given by Morris and Cheadle to a case of nodular\r\ngrowth on the beard and whiskers of a young man. In a case noticed by\r\nCrocker this disease affected the left side of the mustache of a\r\nmedical man, who complained that the hair, if twisted up, stuck\r\ntogether. When disintegrated the secretion in this case seemed to be\r\ncomposed of fungous spores. Epithelium fragments, probably portions of\r\nthe internal root-sheath, sometimes adhere to the shaft of the hair as\r\nit grows up, and look like concretions. Crocker states that he is\r\ninformed by White of Boston that this disease is common in America in\r\nassociation with alopecia furfuracea, and is erroneously thought to be\r\nthe cause of the loss of hair, hence the popular name, \"hair-eaters.\"\r\n\r\nThomson describes a case of mycosis fungoides in a young girl of the\r\nage of fourteen, whom he saw in Brussels toward the end of October,\r\n1893. She was the third of a family of 13 children of whom only five\r\nsurvived. Of the children born subsequently to the patient, the first\r\nwere either premature or died a few days after their births. The\r\nseventh was under treatment for interstitial keratitis and tuberculous\r\nulceration of the lips and throat. The disease in the patient made its\r\nappearance about seven months previously, as a small raised spot in the\r\nmiddle of the back just above the buttocks. Many of the patches\r\ncoalesced. At the time of report the lumbar region was the seat of the\r\ndisease, the affection here presenting a most peculiar appearance,\r\nlooking as if an enormous butterfly had alighted on the patient's back,\r\nwith its dark blue wings covered with silvery scales, widely expanded.\r\nThe patient was not anemic and appeared to be in the best of health.\r\nNone of the glands were affected. According to Thomson there is little\r\ndoubt that this disease is caused by non-pyogenic bacteria gaining\r\naccess to the sweat-glands. The irritation produced by their presence\r\ngives rise to proliferation of the connective-tissue corpuscles.\r\n\r\nJamieson reports a case of mycosis in a native of Aberdeenshire aged\r\nthirty-eight. There was no history of any previous illness.  The\r\ndisease began three years previous to his application for treatment, as\r\na red, itching, small spot on the cheek. Two years later lumps\r\npresented themselves, at first upon his shoulders.  The first thing to\r\nstrike an observer was the offensive odor about the patient. In the\r\nhospital wards it made all the occupants sick. The various stages of\r\nthe disease were marked upon the different parts of the body. On the\r\nchest and abdomen it resembled an eczema, on the shoulders there were\r\nbrown, pinkish-red areas. On the scalp the hair was scanty, the\r\neye-brows denuded, and the eyelashes absent. The forehead was leonine\r\nin aspect. From between the various nodosities a continual discharge\r\nexuded, the nodosities being markedly irregular over the limbs. The\r\nbacks of the hands, the dorsums of the feet, the wrists and ankles, had\r\nclosely approximating growths upon them, while under the thick\r\nepidermis of the palms of the hands were blisters. Itching was intense.\r\nThe patient became emaciated and died thirteen days after his admission\r\ninto the hospital. A histologic examination showed the sarcomatous\r\nnature of the various growths. The disease differed from\r\n\"button-scurvy.\" Mycosis fungoides approximates, clinically and\r\nhistologically, granulomata and sarcomata.\r\n\r\nMorris described an interesting case of universal dermatitis, probably\r\na rare variety of mycosis fungoides. The patient had for many years a\r\ndisease which had first appeared on the arms and legs, and which was\r\nusually regarded by the physicians who saw the case as eczema. At times\r\nthe disease would entirely disappear, but it relapsed, especially\r\nduring visits to India. At the time the patient came under the care of\r\nMorris, his general health seemed unaffected. The skin of the whole\r\nbody, except the face, the scalp, and the front of the chest, was of a\r\nmahogany color. The skin of the lips was so thickened that it could not\r\nbe pinched into folds, and was of a mottled appearance, due to\r\nhemorrhagic spots. All over the thickened and reddened surface were\r\nscattered crops of vesicles and boils. The nails were deformed, and the\r\ntoes beyond the nails were tense with a serous accumulation. The glands\r\nin the right axilla and the groin were much enlarged. The hair on the\r\npubes had disappeared. The abdomen was in a condition similar to that\r\nupon the limbs, but less in degree. The front of the chest below the\r\nnipples was covered with dark papules the size of a pin's head. The\r\nback, the buttocks, the face, and the scalp presented similar lesions.\r\nThe most striking lesions were three ulcers--one on the back of the\r\nright hand, one on the right temple, and the other on the left cheek.\r\nThe largest was the size of a florin, and had elevated borders,\r\nsomewhat infiltrated; they were covered with a brown, dry scab.  The\r\npatient suffered from itching at night so that he could not sleep. He\r\nwas kept under observation, and in spite of treatment the malady\r\nadvanced in a periodic manner, each exacerbation being preceded by a\r\nfeeling of tension in the parts, after which a crop of vesicles would\r\nappear. Sometimes, especially on the feet, bullae formed. The patient\r\nfinally left the hospital and died of an intercurrent attack of\r\npneumonia. A microscopic examination revealed a condition which might\r\nbe found with a number of the chronic affections of the skin, but, in\r\naddition, there were certain cell-inclusions which were thought to\r\nrepresent psorosperms. Morris thought this case corresponded more to\r\nmycosis fungoides than any other malady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nANOMALOUS NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy has been professionally recognized as a distinct type of\r\ndisease since the time of Hippocrates, but in earlier times, and\r\npopularly throughout later times, it was illy defined. The knowledge of\r\nthe clinical symptoms has become definite only since the era of\r\ncerebral local anatomy and localization. Examination of the older\r\nrecords of epilepsy shows curious forms recorded.  The Ephemerides\r\nspeaks of epilepsy manifested only on the birthday. Testa mentions\r\nepilepsy recurring at the festival of St. John, and Bartholinus reports\r\na case in which the convulsions corresponded with the moon's phases.\r\nPaullini describes epilepsy which occurred during the blowing of wind\r\nfrom the south, and also speaks of epilepsy during the paroxysms of\r\nwhich the individual barked. Fabricius and the Ephemerides record\r\ndancing epilepsy. Bartholinus and Hagendorn mention cases during which\r\nvarious splendors appeared before the eyes during the paroxysm.  Godart\r\nPortius, and Salmuth speak of visions occurring before and after\r\nepileptic paroxysms. The Ephemerides contains records of epilepsy in\r\nwhich blindness preceded the paroxysm, in which there was singing\r\nduring it, and a case in which the paroxysm was attended with\r\nsingultus. Various older writers mention cases of epilepsy in which\r\ncurious spots appeared on the face; and the kinds of aura mentioned are\r\ntoo numerous to transcribe.\r\n\r\nBaly mentions a case of epilepsy occasioned by irritation in the socket\r\nof a tooth. Webber reports a case of epilepsy due to phimosis and to\r\nirritation from a tooth. Beardsley speaks of an attempt at\r\nstrangulation that produced epilepsy. Brown-Sequard records an instance\r\nproduced by injury to the sciatic nerve.  Doyle gives an account of the\r\nproduction of epilepsy from protracted bathing in a pond. Duncan cites\r\nan instance of epilepsy connected with vesical calculus that was cured\r\nby lithotomy. Museroft mentions an analogous case. Greenhow speaks of\r\nepilepsy arising from an injury to the thumb. Garmannus, early in the\r\neighteenth century, describes epilepsy arising from fright and terror.\r\nBristowe in 1880, and Farre speak of similar instances. In Farre's case\r\nthe disease was temporarily cured by an attack of acute rheumatism.\r\nThorington of Philadelphia has seen a paroxysm of epilepsy induced by\r\nthe instillation of atropia in the eye of a child nearly cured of the\r\nmalady. It was supposed that the child was terrified on awakening and\r\nfinding its vision suddenly diminished, and that the convulsions were\r\ndirectly due to the emotional disturbance. Orwin describes epilepsy\r\nfrom prolonged lactation, and instances of ovarian and uterine epilepsy\r\nare quite common.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar case of running epilepsy recorded. The patient was\r\na workman who would be suddenly seized with a paroxysm, and\r\nunconsciously run some distance at full speed. On one occasion he ran\r\nfrom Peterborough to Whittlesey, where he was stopped and brought back.\r\nOnce he ran into a pit containing six feet of water, from which he was\r\nrescued. Yeo says that sexual intercourse occasionally induces\r\nepilepsy, and relates a case in which a severe epileptic fit terminated\r\nfatally three days after the seizure, which occurred on the nuptial\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nDrake reports the case of a man who was wounded in the War of 1812,\r\nnear Baltimore, the ball passing along the left ear and temple so close\r\nas to graze the skin. Eighteen years after the accident he suffered\r\nwith pain in the left ear and temple, accompanied by epileptic fits and\r\npartial amnesia, together with an entire loss of power of remembering\r\nproper names and applying them to the objects to which they belonged.\r\nHe would, for instance, invariably write Kentucky for Louisville.\r\nBeirne records the case of a dangerous lunatic, an epileptic, who was\r\nattacked by a fellow-inmate and sustained an extensive fracture of the\r\nright parietal bone, with great hemorrhage, followed by coma. Strange\r\nto say, after the accident he recovered his intellect, and was cured of\r\nhis epileptic attacks, but for six years he was a paralytic from the\r\nhips down.\r\n\r\nThe Dancing Mania.--Chorea has appeared in various epidemic forms under\r\nthe names of St. Vitus's dance, St. Guy's dance, St.  Anthony's dance,\r\nchoromania, tanzplage, orchestromania, dance of St. Modesti or St.\r\nJohn, the dancing mania, etc.; although these various functional\r\nphenomena of the nervous system have been called chorea, they bear very\r\nlittle resemblance to what, at the present day, is called by this name.\r\nThe epidemic form appeared about 1374, although Hecker claims that, at\r\nthat time, it was no new thing. Assemblages of men and women were seen\r\nat Aix-la-Chapelle who, impelled by a common delusion, would form\r\ncircles, hand in hand, and dance in wild delirium until they fell to\r\nthe ground exhausted, somewhat after the manner of the Ghost-Dance or\r\nMessiah-Dance of our North American Indians. In their Bacchantic leaps\r\nthey were apparently haunted by visions and hallucinations, the fancy\r\nconjuring up spirits whose names they shrieked out. Some of them\r\nafterward stated that they appeared to be immersed in a stream of blood\r\nwhich obliged them to leap so high. Others saw the heavens open and\r\ndisclose the Saviour enthroned with the Virgin Mary. The participants\r\nseemed to suffer greatly from tympanites which was generally relieved\r\nby compression or thumping on the abdomen. A few months after this\r\ndancing malady had made its appearance at Aix-la-Chapelle it broke out\r\nat Cologne, and about the same time at Metz, the streets of which were\r\nsaid to have been filled with 1100 dancers.  This rich city became the\r\nscene of the most ruinous disorder.  Peasants left their plows,\r\nmechanics their shops, servants their masters, children their homes;\r\nand beggars and idle vagabonds, who understood how to imitate the\r\nconvulsions, roved from place to place, inducing all sorts of crime and\r\nvice among the afflicted. Strasburg was visited by the dancing plague\r\nin 1418, and it was here that the plague assumed the name of St.\r\nVitus's dance. St. Vitus was a Sicilian youth who, just at the time he\r\nwas about to undergo martyrdom by order of Diocletian, in the year 303,\r\nis said to have prayed to God that He might protect all those who would\r\nsolemnize the day of his commemoration and fast upon its eve. The\r\npeople were taught that a voice from heaven was then heard saying,\r\n\"Vitus, thy prayer is accepted.\"\r\n\r\nParacelsus called this malady (Chorus sancti viti) the lascivious\r\ndance, and says that persons stricken with it were helpless until\r\nrelieved by either recovery or death. The malady spread rapidly through\r\nFrance and Holland, and before the close of the century was introduced\r\ninto England. In his \"Anatomy of Melancholy\" Burton refers to it, and\r\nspeaks of the idiosyncrasies of the individuals afflicted. It is said\r\nthey could not abide one in red clothes, and that they loved music\r\nabove all things, and also that the magistrates in Germany hired\r\nmusicians to give them music, and provided them with sturdy companions\r\nto dance with.  Their endurance was marvelous. Plater speaks of a woman\r\nin Basle whom he saw, that danced for a month. In Strasburg many of\r\nthem ate nothing for days and nights until their mania subsided.\r\nParacelsus, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, was the first to\r\nmake a study of this disease. He outlined the severest treatment for\r\nit, and boasted that he cured many of the victims.  Hecker conjectures\r\nthat probably the wild revels of St. John's day, 1374, gave rise to\r\nthis mental plague, which thenceforth visited so many thousands with\r\nincurable aberrations of mind and disgusting distortions of the body.\r\nAlmost simultaneous with the dance of \"St. With,\" there appeared in\r\nItaly and Arabia a mania very similar in character which was called\r\n\"tarantism,\" which was supposed to originate in the bite of the\r\ntarantula. The only effective remedy was music in some form. In the\r\nTigre country, Abyssinia, this disease appeared under the name of\r\n\"Tigretier.\" The disease, fortunately, rapidly declined, and very\r\nlittle of it seems to have been known in the sixteenth century, but in\r\nthe early part of the eighteenth century a peculiar sect called the\r\n\"Convulsionnaires\" arose in France; and throughout England among the\r\nMethodist sect, insane convulsions of this nature were witnessed; and\r\neven to the present day in some of the primitive religious meetings of\r\nour people, something not unlike this mania of the Middle Ages is\r\nperpetuated.\r\n\r\nParacelsus divided the sufferers of St. Vitus's dance into three\r\nclasses .--\r\n\r\n(1) Those in which the affliction arose from imagination (chorea\r\nimaginativa).\r\n\r\n(2) Those which had their origin in sexual desires depending on the\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n(3) Those arising from corporeal causes (chorea naturalis). This last\r\ncase, according to a strange notion of his own he explained by\r\nmaintaining that in certain vessels which are susceptible of an\r\ninternal pruriency, and thence produced laughter, the blood is set into\r\ncommotion in consequence of an alteration in the vital spirits, whereby\r\nare occasioned involuntary fits of intoxicating joy, and a propensity\r\nto dance. The great physician Sydenham gave the first accurate\r\ndescription of what is to-day called chorea, and hence the disease has\r\nbeen named \"Sydenham's chorea.\" So true to life was his portrayal of\r\nthe disease that it has never been surpassed by modern observers.\r\n\r\nThe disease variously named palmus, the jumpers, the twitchers, lata,\r\nmiryachit, or, as it is sometimes called, the emeryaki of Siberia, and\r\nthe tic-convulsif of La Tourette, has been very well described by Gray\r\nwho says that the French authors had their attention directed to the\r\nsubject by the descriptions of two American authors--those of Beard\r\nupon \"The Jumpers of Maine,\" published in 1880, and that of Hammond\r\nupon \"Miryachit,\" a similar disease of the far Orient. Beard found that\r\nthe jumpers of Maine did unhesitatingly whatever they were told to do.\r\nThus, one who was sitting in a chair was told to throw a knife that he\r\nhad in his hand, and he obeyed so quickly that the weapon stuck in a\r\nhouse opposite; at the same time he repeated the command given him,\r\nwith a cry of alarm not unlike that of hysteria or epilepsy. When he\r\nwas suddenly clapped upon the shoulder he threw away his pipe, which he\r\nhad been filling with tobacco. The first parts of Virgil's aeneid and\r\nHomer's Iliad were recited to one of these illiterate jumpers, and he\r\nrepeated the words as they came to him in a sharp voice, at the same\r\ntime jumping or throwing whatever he had in his hand, or raising his\r\nshoulder, or making some other violent motion. It is related by\r\nO'Brien, an Irishman serving on an English naval vessel, that an\r\nelderly and respectable Malay woman, with whom he was conversing in an\r\nentirely unsuspecting manner, suddenly began to undress herself, and\r\nshowed a most ominous and determined intention of stripping herself\r\ncompletely, and all because a by-standing friend had suddenly taken off\r\nhis coat; at the same time she manifested the most violent anger at\r\nwhat she deemed this outrage to her sex, calling the astonished friend\r\nan abandoned hog, and begging O'Brien to kill him. O'Brien,\r\nfurthermore, tells of a cook who was carrying his child in his arms\r\nover the bridge of a river, while at the same time a sailor carried a\r\nlog of wood in like manner; the sailor threw his log of wood on an\r\nawning, amusing himself by causing it to roll over the cloth, and\r\nfinally letting it fall to the bridge; the cook repeated every motion\r\nwith his little boy, and killed him on the spot. This miryachit was\r\nobserved in Malaysia, Bengal, among the Sikhs and the Nubians, and in\r\nSiberia, whilst Beard has observed it in Michigan as well as in Maine.\r\nCrichton speaks of a leaping ague in Angusshire, Scotland.\r\n\r\nGray has seen only one case of acute palmus, and records it as follows:\r\n\"It was in a boy of six, whose heredity, so far as I could ascertain\r\nfrom the statements of his mother, was not neurotic. He had had trouble\r\nsome six months before coming to me.  He had been labeled with a number\r\nof interesting diagnoses, such as chorea, epilepsy, myotonia, hysteria,\r\nand neurasthenia. His palmodic movements were very curious. When\r\nstanding near a table looking at something, the chin would suddenly\r\ncome down with a thump that would leave a black-and-blue mark, or his\r\nhead would be thrown violently to one side, perhaps coming in contact\r\nwith some adjacent hard object with equal force, or, while standing\r\nquietly, his legs would give a sudden twitch, and he would be thrown\r\nviolently to the ground, and this even happened several times when he\r\nwas seated on the edge of a stool. The child was under my care for two\r\nweeks, and, probably because of an intercurrent attack of diarrhea,\r\ngrew steadily worse during that time, in spite of the full doses of\r\narsenic which were administered to him. He was literally covered with\r\nbruises from the sudden and violent contacts with articles of\r\nfurniture, the floor, and the walls. At last, in despair at his\r\ncondition, I ordered him to be undressed and put to bed, and steadily\r\npushed the Fowler's solution of arsenic until he was taking ten drops\r\nthree times a day, when, to my great surprise, he began to improve\r\nrapidly, and at the end of six weeks was perfectly well.  Keeping him\r\nunder observation for two weeks longer I finally sent him to his home\r\nin the West, and am informed that he has since remained perfectly well.\r\nIt has seemed to me that many of the cases recorded as paramyoclonus\r\nmultiples have been really acute palmus.\"\r\n\r\nGray mentions two cases of general palmus with pseudomelancholia, and\r\ndescribes them in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"The muscular movements are of the usual sudden, shock-like type, and\r\nof the same extent as in what I have ventured to call the general form.\r\nWith them, however, there is associated a curious pseudomelancholia,\r\nconsisting of certain fixed melancholy suspicious delusions, without,\r\nhowever, any of the suicidal tendencies and abnormal sensations up and\r\ndown the back of the head, neck, or spine, or the sleeplessness, which\r\nare characteristic of most cases of true melancholia. In both of my\r\ncases the palmus had existed for a long period, the exact limits of\r\nwhich, however, I could not determine, because the patient scouted the\r\nidea that he had had any trouble of the kind, but which the testimony\r\nof friends and relatives seemed to vouch for.  They were both men, one\r\nthirty-six and one thirty-eight years of age. The pseudomelancholia,\r\nhowever, had only existed in one case for about a year, and in the\r\nother for six months. One case passed away from my observation, and I\r\nknow nothing of its further course. The other case recovered in nine\r\nmonths' treatment, and during the three years that have since elapsed\r\nhe has been an active business man, although I have not seen him myself\r\nduring that period, as he took a great dislike to me because I was\r\nforced to take strong measures to keep him under treatment, so\r\npersistent were his suspicions.\"\r\n\r\nAthetosis was first described by Hammond in 1871, who gave it the name\r\nbecause it was mainly characterized by an inability to retain the\r\nfingers and toes in any position in which they might be planed, as well\r\nas by their continuous motion. According to Drewry \"athetosis is a\r\ncerebral affection, presenting a combination of symptoms characterized\r\nchiefly by a more or less constant mobility of the extremities and an\r\ninability to retain them in any fixed position. These morbid,\r\ngrotesque, involuntary movements are slow and wavy, somewhat regular\r\nand rigid, are not jerky, spasmodic, nor tremulous. The movements of\r\nthe digits are quite different from those attending any other disease,\r\nimpossible to imitate even by the most skilful malingerer, and, if once\r\nseen, are not likely to be forgotten. In an athetoid hand, says Starr,\r\nthe interossei and lumbricales, which flex the metacarpo-phalangeal and\r\nextend the phalangeal joints, are affected; rarely are the long\r\nextensors and the long flexors affected. Therefore the hand is usually\r\nin the so-called interosseal position, with flexion of the proximal and\r\nextension of the middle and distal phalanges. The athetoid movements of\r\nthe toes correspond to those of the fingers in point of action. In a\r\ngreat majority of cases the disease is confined to one side\r\n(hemiathetosis), and is a sequel of hemiplegia. The differential\r\ndiagnosis of athetosis is generally easily made. The only nervous\r\naffections with which it could possibly be confounded are chorea and\r\nparalysis agitans. Attention to the twitching, spasmodic, fibrillary\r\nmovements, having a quick beginning and a quick ending, which is\r\ncharacteristic in Sydenham's chorea, would at once exclude that\r\ndisease. These jerky movements peculiar to St.  Vitus's dance may be\r\neasily detected in a few or many muscles, if moderate care and patience\r\nbe exercised on the part of the examiner. This form of chorea is almost\r\nalways a disease of childhood. So-called post-hemiplegic chorea is, in\r\nthe opinion of both Hammond and Gray, simply athetosis. The silly,\r\ndancing, posturing, wiry movements, and the facial distortion observed\r\nin Huntington's chorea would hardly be mistaken by a careful observer\r\nfor athetosis. The two diseases, however, are somewhat alike. Paralysis\r\nagitans (shaking palsy), with its coarse tremor, peculiar facies,\r\nimmobility, shuffling gait, the 'bread-crumbling' attitude of the\r\nfingers, and deliberate speech, would be readily eliminated even by a\r\nnovice. It is, too, a disease of advanced life, usually. Charcot, Gray,\r\nRinger, Bernhardt, Shaw, Eulenberg, Grassel; Kinnicutt, Sinkler, and\r\nothers have written on this affection.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the report of a case by Drewry, of double (or, more\r\nstrictly speaking, quadruple) athetosis, associated with epilepsy and\r\ninsanity: \"The patient was a negro woman, twenty-six years old when she\r\nwas admitted into this, the Central State (Va.) Hospital, in April,\r\n1886. She had had epilepsy of the grand mal type for a number of years,\r\nwas the mother of one child, and earned her living as a domestic. A\r\ncareful physical examination revealed nothing of importance as an\r\netiologic factor. Following in the footsteps of many of those\r\nunfortunates afflicted with epilepsy, she degenerated into a state of\r\nalmost absolute imbecility.\r\n\r\n\"Some degree of mental deficiency seems usually to accompany athetosis,\r\neven when uncomplicated by any other degenerating neurosis. Athetoid\r\nsymptoms of an aggravated character, involving both upper and both\r\nlower extremities, had developed previous to her admission into this\r\nhospital, but it was impossible to find out when and how they began.\r\nShe had never had, to the knowledge of her friends, an attack of\r\n'apoplexy,' nor of paralysis. The head was symmetric, and without scars\r\nthereon. The pedal extremities involuntarily assumed various distorted\r\npositions and were constantly in motion. The toes were usually in a\r\nstate of tonic spasm,--contracted, and drawn downward or extended,\r\npointing upward, and slightly separated. Irregular alternate extension\r\nand flexion of the toes were marked. The feet were moved upon the\r\nankles in a stiff and awkward manner. During these 'complex involuntary\r\nmovements,' the muscles of the calf became hard and rigid. The act of\r\nwalking was accomplished with considerable difficulty, on account of\r\ncontractures, and because the feet were not exactly under the control\r\nof the will. The unnatural movements of the hands corresponded to those\r\nof the lower extremities, though they were more constant and active.\r\nThe fingers, including the thumbs, were usually widely separated and\r\nextended, though they were sometimes slightly flexed. The hands were\r\ncontinually in slow, methodic, quasi-rhythmic motion, never remaining\r\nlong in the same attitude. In grasping an object the palm of the hand\r\nwas used, it being difficult to approximate the digits. The\r\nwrist-joints were also implicated, there being alternate flexion and\r\nextension. In fact these odd contortions affected the entire limb from\r\nthe shoulder to the digital extremities. When standing or walking the\r\narms were held out horizontally, as if to maintain the equilibrium of\r\nthe body. The patient's general physical health was fairly good. She\r\nfrequently complained of headache, and when she was exceedingly\r\nirritable and violent all the athetoid movements would be intensified.\r\nSpeech was jerky and disordered, which gave it a distinctive character.\r\nThe special senses seemed to be unimpaired, and the pupils were normal,\r\nexcept when an epileptic attack came on.  Death occurred in January,\r\n1895, after an obstinate attack of status epilepticus.\" Paramyoclonus\r\nmultiplex is a condition of chronic muscular spasm affecting the trunk,\r\noccasionally the muscles of the face, abdomen, or diaphragm. The\r\nmuscles affected are usually in the trunk and in the limbs, and not in\r\nthe toes and hand; occasionally the movements are tonic as well as\r\nclonic; the degree of spasm varies greatly, and according to Gray may\r\nsometimes be so violent as to throw the patient down or out of the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nSaltatoric spasm is an extremely rare condition, first observed by\r\nBamberger in 1859. The calf, hip, knee, and back-muscles are affected\r\nby clonic spasm, causing springing or jumping movements when the\r\npatient attempts to stand. The disease is transient, and there are no\r\nmental symptoms.\r\n\r\nProgressive muscular atrophy has been observed as far back as\r\nHippocrates, but it is only in recent times that we have had any\r\ndefinite knowledge of the subject. It is divided into four types, the\r\nhand type (causing the griffin-or claw-hand, or the ape-hand); the\r\njuvenile type (generally in the muscles of the shoulder and arm); the\r\nfacial type; and the peroneal type.  Generalized progressive atrophy\r\nleads to a condition that simulates the appearance of a \"living\r\nskeleton.\"\r\n\r\nFacial hemiatrophy is an incurable disease, as yet of unknown\r\npathology. It consists of wasting of the bones, subcutaneous tissues,\r\nand muscles of one-half of the face or head, the muscles suffering but\r\nslightly. The accompanying illustration shows a case in which there was\r\nosseous depression of the cranium and a localized alopecia. The disease\r\nis very rare, only about 100 cases having been reported. Of five cases\r\nseen by Dana, three were in females and two in males; in all the cases\r\nthat could be found the origin was between the tenth and twentieth\r\nyears. It is a chronic affection, usually beginning in early life,\r\nincreasing slowly for years, and then becoming stationary. It is\r\ndistinguished from one-sided muscular atrophy by the electric reaction,\r\nwhich is not lost in the facial muscles in facial hemiatrophy, and\r\nthere is no atrophy of other muscles of the body.\r\n\r\nBurr contributes an exhaustive paper on hemiatrophy of the tongue with\r\nreport of a case as follows: \"L. B., female, mulatto, thirty-one years\r\nold, married, came to the Medico-Chirurgical Hospital, Philadelphia,\r\nSeptember 23, 1895, complaining that her 'tongue was crooked.' Save\r\nthat she had had syphilis, her personal history is negative. In\r\nFebruary, 1895, she began to suffer from headache, usually behind the\r\nleft ear, and often preventing sleep. At times there is quite severe\r\nvertigo. Several weeks after the onset, headache persisting, she awoke\r\nin the night and found the left side of the tongue swollen, black, and\r\npainless. For some hours she could neither speak nor chew, but\r\nbreathing was not interfered with. After a few days all symptoms passed\r\naway except headache, and she thought no more of the matter until\r\nrecently, as stated above, she noticed by accident that her tongue was\r\ndeformed. She is a spare, poorly-fed, muddy-skinned mulatto girl. The\r\nleft half of the tongue is only about one-half as large as the right.\r\nThe upper surface is irregularly depressed and elevated. There are no\r\nscars. When protruded it turns sharply to the left. Fibrillary\r\ntwitching is not present. The mucous membrane is normal. Common\r\nsensation and taste are preserved. The pharyngeal reflex is present.\r\nThe palate moves well. There is no palsy or wasting of the face. The\r\npupils are of normal size and react well to light and with\r\naccommodation. Station and gait are normal. There is no incoordination\r\nof movement in the arms or legs. The knee-jerks are much increased.\r\nThere is an attempt at, but no true, clonus; that is, passive flexion\r\nof the foot causes two or three jerky movements. There is no glandular\r\nswelling or tumor about the jaw or in the neck. Touch and pain-sense\r\nare normal in the face and hands, but she complains of numbness in the\r\nhands as if she had on tight gloves. There is no trouble in speaking,\r\nchewing, or swallowing. There is no pain or rigidity in the neck\r\nmuscles.  Examination of the pharynx reveals no disease of the bones.\r\nUnder specific treatment the patient improved.\"\r\n\r\nAstasia-abasia was named by Blocq, who collected 11 cases.  According\r\nto Knapp, four cases have been reported in America. The disease\r\nconsists in an inability to stand erect or walk normally, although\r\nthere is no impairment of sensation, of muscular strength, or of the\r\ncoordination of other muscles in walking than the lower extremities. In\r\nattempting to walk the legs become spasmodic; there are rapid flexions\r\nand extensions of the legs on the thighs, and of the thighs on the\r\npelvis. The steps are short, and the feet drag; the body may make great\r\noscillations if the patient stands, walks, or sits, and the head and\r\narms make rhythmical movements; walking may become impossible, the\r\npatient appearing to leap up on one foot and then up on the other, the\r\nbody and head oscillating as he advances; he may be able to walk\r\ncross-legged, or by raising the legs high; or to walk on his hands and\r\nfeet; he may be able to walk at certain times and not at others; or to\r\nhop with both feet together; he may succeed with great strides and with\r\nthe arms extended; or finally he may be able to use his legs perfectly\r\nif suspended (Gray). There are various types which have been called the\r\nparalytic, the choreic, and the saltatory. A tendency to go backward or\r\nretropulsion has been observed, according to Gray, as has also a\r\ntendency to go forward or propulsion. A curious phenomenon in this\r\ndisease is that the patient can use the legs perfectly well lying in\r\nbed.  The prognosis seems to be favorable.\r\n\r\nMeniere's disease is a disease probably of the semicircular canals,\r\ncharacterized by nausea, vomiting, vertigo, deafness, tinnitus aurium,\r\nand various other phenomena. It is also called aural or auditory\r\nvertigo. The salient symptom is vertigo, and this varies somewhat in\r\ndegree according to the portions of the ear affected. If the disease is\r\nin the labyrinth, the patient is supposed to stagger to one side, and\r\nthe vertigo is paroxysmal, varying to such a degree as to cause simple\r\nreeling, or falling as if shot. Gray reports the history of a patient\r\nwith this sensational record: He had been a peasant in Ireland, and one\r\nday crossing one of the wide moors in a dog-cart, he was suddenly, as\r\nhe thought, struck a violent blow from behind, so that he believed that\r\nhe lost consciousness for some time. At all events, when he was able to\r\nget up he found his horse and cart some distance off, and, of course,\r\nnot a soul in sight. Under the belief that he had been struck by some\r\nenemy he went quietly home and said nothing about it. Some time\r\nafterward, however, in crossing another lonely place he had a similar\r\nexperience, and as he came to the conclusion that nobody could have\r\nbeen near him, he made up his mind that it was some malevolent stroke\r\nof the devil and he consulted a priest who agreed with him in his\r\nbelief, and gave him an amulet to wear. A series of similar attacks\r\noccurred and puzzled as to whether there was some diabolical agency at\r\nwork, or whether he was the victim of some conspiracy, he emigrated to\r\nAmerica; for several months he had no attacks. A new paroxysm occurring\r\nhe consulted Gray, who found indubitable evidence of labyrinthine\r\ndisease. The paroxysms of this disease are usually accompanied by\r\nnausea and vomiting, and on account of the paleness of the face, and\r\nthe cold, clammy perspiration, attacks have frequently been mistaken\r\nfor apoplexy.  In disease of the middle ear the attacks are continuous\r\nrather than paroxysmal. If the disease is in the middle or internal\r\nears, loud noises are generally heard, but if the disease is in the\r\nexternal ear, the noises are generally absent, and the vertigo of less\r\ndegree but continuous. The prognosis varies with the location of the\r\ndisease, but is always serious.\r\n\r\nHuman rumination has been known for many years. Bartholinus, Paullinus,\r\nBlanchard, Bonet, the Ephemerides, Fabricius Hildanus, Horstius,\r\nMorgagni, Peyer, Rhodius, Vogel, Salmuth, Percy, Laurent, and others\r\ndescribe it. Fabricius d'Aquapendente personally knew a victim of\r\nrumination, or, as it is generally called, merycism. The dissection by\r\nBartholinus of a merycol showed nothing extraordinary in the cadaver.\r\nWinthier knew a Swede of thirty-five, in Germany, apparently healthy,\r\nbut who was obliged when leaving the table to retire to some remote\r\nplace where he might eject his food into his mouth again, saying that\r\nit gave him the sensation of sweetest honey. The patient related that\r\nfrom his infancy he had been the subject of acid eructations, and at\r\nthe age of thirty he commenced rumination as a means of relief. To\r\nthose who are interested in the older records of these cases Percy and\r\nLaurent offer the descriptions of a number of cases.\r\n\r\nIn a recent discussion before the American Neurological Association\r\nHammond defined merycism as the functions of remastication and\r\nrumination in the human subject. He referred to several cases, among\r\nthem that of the distinguished physiologist, Brown-Sequard, who\r\nacquired the habit as a result of experiments performed upon himself.\r\nHammond reported a case of a young man who was the subject of merycism,\r\nand whose mental condition was also impaired. No special treatment was\r\nundertaken, but the patient was trephined, with the purpose of\r\nimproving his mental condition. There were no unusual features\r\nconnected with the operation, but it was noticed that there were no\r\nruminations with the meals he took until the fifth day, when a slight\r\nrumination occurred. Eight days later a similar button was removed from\r\nthe corresponding side of the left skull, and from that time (about six\r\nmonths) to the time of report, there had been no regurgitation. Whether\r\nthe cure of the merycism in this case was directly due to the\r\noperations on the cranium, or the result of the mental improvement, is\r\na question for discussion. Hammond added that, when acquired, merycism\r\nwas almost invariably the result of over-eating and loading the\r\nesophagus, or the result of fast eating.\r\n\r\nIn remarks upon Hammond's paper Knapp said that two cases had come to\r\nhis knowledge, both in physicians, but one of them he knew of only by\r\nhearsay. The other man, now over thirty, had regurgitated his food from\r\nearly childhood, and he did not know that he had anything very unusual\r\nthe matter with him until he began some investigations upon the\r\nfunctions and diseases of the stomach. This man was not nervous, and\r\nwas certainly not an idiot. He had done active work as a physician, and\r\ncalled himself in perfect health. He was something of an epicure, and\r\nnever suffered from indigestion. After a hearty meal the regurgitation\r\nwas more marked. Food had been regurgitated, tasting as good as when\r\nfirst eaten, several hours after the eating. If he attempted to check\r\nthe regurgitation he sometimes had a slight feeling of fulness in the\r\nstomach. Lloyd said that these cases were forms of neuroses, and were\r\ntypes of hysteric vomiting. There was no gustatory satisfaction\r\nconnected with any form of hysteric vomiting that he had seen. In some\r\nof these cases of hysteric vomiting the food does not appear to enter\r\nthe stomach, but is rejected by a sort of spasm of the esophagus. This\r\nhas been called \"esophagismus,\" and is apparently closely allied to\r\nthis neurosis, which some have called \"merycism.\" The President of the\r\nAssociation said that this would seem to be an affection common among\r\nphysicians. A student friend of his who had been affected in this way,\r\nhad written an elaborate monograph on the subject.  He was disgusted\r\nwith the habit, and finally overcame it by the exercise of his\r\nwill-power.\r\n\r\nRunge discusses three cases of hereditary rumination. These patients\r\nbelonged to three generations in the male line. The author subjected\r\nthe contents of the stomach of one patient to quite an extensive\r\nanalysis, without finding any abnormality of secretion.\r\n\r\nWakefulness.--Generally speaking, the length of time a person can go\r\nwithout sleep is the same as that during which he can survive without\r\nfood. Persons, particularly those of an hysteric nature, are prone to\r\nmake statements that they have not slept for many days, or that they\r\nnever sleep at all, but a careful examination and watch during the\r\nnight over these patients show that they have at least been in a\r\ndrowsy, somnolent condition, which is in a measure physiologically\r\nequivalent to sleep. Accounts of long periods of wakefulness arise from\r\ntime to time, but a careful examination would doubtless disprove them.\r\nAs typical of these accounts, we quote one from Anderson, Indiana,\r\nDecember 11, 1895:--\r\n\r\n\"David Jones of this city, who attracted the attention of the entire\r\nmedical profession two years ago by a sleepless spell of ninety-three\r\ndays, and last year by another spell which extended over one hundred\r\nand thirty-one days, is beginning on another which he fears will be\r\nmore serious than the preceding ones. He was put on the circuit jury\r\nthree weeks ago, and counting to-day has not slept for twenty days and\r\nnights. He eats and talks as well as usual, and is full of business and\r\nactivity. He does not experience any bad effects whatever from the\r\nspell, nor did he during his one hundred and thirty-one days. During\r\nthat spell he attended to all of his farm business. He says now that he\r\nfeels as though he never will sleep again. He does not seem to bother\r\nhimself about the prospects of a long and tedious wake. He cannot\r\nattribute it to any one thing, but thinks that it was probably\r\nsuperinduced by his use of tobacco while young.\"\r\n\r\nSomnambulism, or, as it has been called, noctambulation, is a curious\r\nphase of nocturnal cerebration analogous to the hypnotic state, or\r\ndouble consciousness occasionally observed in epileptics. Both\r\nHippocrates and Aristotle discuss somnambulism, and it is said that the\r\nphysician Galen was a victim of this habit. Horstius, ab Heers, and\r\nmany others of the older writers recorded interesting examples of this\r\nphenomenon. Schenck remarks on the particular way in which\r\nsomnambulists seem to escape injury. Haller, Hoffmann, Gassendi,\r\nCaelius Rhodiginus, Pinel, Hechler, Bohn, Richter,--in fact nearly all\r\nthe ancient physiologists and anatomists have written on this subject.\r\nThe marvelous manifestations of somnambulism are still among the more\r\nsurprising phenomena with which science has to deal. That a person\r\ndeeply immersed in thought should walk and talk while apparently\r\nunconscious, excites no surprise, but that anyone should when fast\r\nasleep perform a series of complicated actions which undoubtedly demand\r\nthe assistance of the senses is marvelous indeed. Often he will rise in\r\nthe night, walk from room to room, go out on porticoes, and in some\r\ncases on steep roofs, where he would not dare to venture while awake.\r\nFrequently he will wander for hours through streets and fields,\r\nreturning home and to bed without knowledge of anything having\r\ntranspired.\r\n\r\nThe state of the eyes during somnambulism varies considerably.  They\r\nare sometimes closed, sometimes half-closed, and frequently quite open;\r\nthe pupil is sometimes widely dilated, sometimes contracted, sometimes\r\nnatural, and for the most part insensible to light.\r\n\r\nSomnambulism seems to be hereditary. Willis cites an example in which\r\nthe father and the children were somnambulists, and in other cases\r\nseveral individuals in the same family have been afflicted. Horstius\r\ngives a history of three young brothers who became somnambulistic at\r\nthe same epoch. A remarkable instance of somnambulism was the case of a\r\nlad of sixteen and a half years who, in an attack of somnambulism, went\r\nto the stable, saddled his horse, asked for his whip, and disputed with\r\nthe toll-keeper about his fare, and when he awoke had no recollection\r\nwhatever of his acts, having been altogether an hour in his trance.\r\n\r\nMarville quotes the case of an Italian of thirty, melancholic, and a\r\ndeep thinker, who was observed one evening in his bed. It was seen that\r\nhe slept with his eyes open but fixed and immovable. His hands were\r\ncold, and his pulse extremely slow. At midnight he brusquely tore the\r\ncurtains of his bed aside, dressed himself, went to his stable, and\r\nmounted a horse. Finding the gate of the court yard closed he opened it\r\nwith the aid of a large stone. Soon he dismounted, went to a billiard\r\nroom, and simulated all the movements of one playing. In another room\r\nhe struck with his empty hands a harpsichord, and finally returned to\r\nhis bed. He appeared to be irritated when anybody made a noise, but a\r\nlight placed under his nose was apparently unnoticed. He awoke if his\r\nfeet were tickled, or if a horn was blown in his ear. Tissot transmits\r\nto us the example of a medical student who arose in the night, pursued\r\nhis studies, and returned to bed without awaking; and there is another\r\nrecord of an ecclesiastic who finished his sermon in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Bordeaux attests the case of a young ecclesiastic who\r\nwas in the habit of getting up during the night in a state of\r\nsomnambulism, taking pen, ink, and paper, and composing and writing\r\nsermons. When he had finished a page he would read aloud what he had\r\nwritten and correct it. In order to ascertain whether the somnambulist\r\nmade any use of his eyes the Archbishop held a piece of cardboard under\r\nhis chin to prevent his seeing the paper upon which he was writing. He\r\ncontinued to write without being in the slightest degree incommoded. In\r\nthis state he also copied out pieces of music, and when it happened\r\nthat the words were written in too large characters and did not stand\r\nover the corresponding notes he perceived his error, blotted them out,\r\nand wrote them over again with great exactness.\r\n\r\nNegretti, a sleep-walker, sometimes carried a candle about with him as\r\nif to furnish him light in his employment, but when a bottle was\r\nsubstituted he carried it, fancying that he had the candle. Another\r\nsomnambulist, Castelli, was found by Dr. Sloane translating Italian and\r\nFrench and looking out words in his dictionary. His candle was\r\npurposely extinguished, whereupon he immediately began groping about,\r\nas if in the dark, and, although other lighted candles were in the\r\nroom, he did not resume his occupation until he had relighted his\r\ncandle at the fire. He was insensible to the light of every candle\r\nexcepting the one upon which his attention was fixed.\r\n\r\nTuke tells of a school-boy who being unable to master a school-problem\r\nin geometry retired to bed still thinking of the subject; he was found\r\nlate at night by his instructor on his knees pointing from spot to spot\r\nas though he were at the blackboard. He was so absorbed that he paid no\r\nattention to the light of the candle, nor to the speech addressed to\r\nhim. The next morning the teacher asked him if he had finished his\r\nproblem, and he replied that he had, having dreamt it and remembered\r\nthe dream. There are many such stories on record. Quoted by Gray,\r\nMesnet speaks of a suicidal attempt made in his presence by a\r\nsomnambulistic woman. She made a noose of her apron, fastened one end\r\nto a chair and the other to the top of a window. She then kneeled down\r\nin prayer, made the sign of the cross, mounted a stool, and tried to\r\nhang herself. Mesnet, scientific to the utmost, allowed her to hang as\r\nlong as he dared, and then stopped the performance. At another time she\r\nattempted to kill herself by violently throwing herself on the floor\r\nafter having failed to fling herself out of the window. At still\r\nanother time she tried poison, filling a glass with water, putting\r\nseveral coins into it, and hiding it after bidding farewell to her\r\nfamily in writing; the next night, when she was again somnambulistic,\r\nshe changed her mind once more, writing to her family explaining her\r\nchange of purpose. Mesnet relates some interesting experiments made\r\nupon a French sergeant in a condition of somnambulism, demonstrating\r\nthe excitation of ideas in the mind through the sense of touch in the\r\nextremities. This soldier touched a table, passed his hands over it,\r\nand finding nothing on it, opened the drawer, took out a pen, found\r\npaper and an inkstand, and taking a chair he sat down and wrote to his\r\ncommanding officer speaking of his bravery, and asking for a medal. A\r\nthick metallic plate was then placed before his eyes so as to\r\ncompletely intercept vision.  After a few minutes, during which he\r\nwrote a few words with a jumbled stroke, he stopped, but without any\r\npetulance. The plate was removed and he went on writing. Somnambulism\r\nmay assume such a serious phase as to result in the commission of\r\nmurder. There is a case of a man of twenty-seven, of steady habits, who\r\nkilled his child when in a state of somnambulism. He was put on trial\r\nfor murder, and some of the most remarkable facts of his somnambulistic\r\nfeats were elicited in the evidence. It is said that once when a boy he\r\narose at night while asleep, dressed himself; took a pitcher and went\r\nfor milk to a neighboring farm, as was his custom. At another time he\r\nworked in a lumber-yard in a rain-storm while asleep. Again, when about\r\ntwenty-one, he was seen in a mill-pond wading about attempting to save\r\nhis sister who he imagined was drowning. The worst phase of his\r\nsomnambulism was the impending fears and terrible visions to which he\r\nwas subjected. Sometimes he would imagine that the house was on fire\r\nand the walls about to fall upon him, or that a wild beast was\r\nattacking his wife and child; and he would fight, screaming\r\ninarticulately all the while. He would chase the imaginary beast about\r\nthe room, and in fact had grasped one of his companions, apparently\r\nbelieving he was in a struggle with a wild beast. He had often injured\r\nhimself in these struggles, and had often attacked his father, his\r\nwife, sister, fellow-lodgers, and while confined in jail he attacked\r\none of his fellow-prisoners. His eyes would always be wide open and\r\nstaring; he was always able to avoid pieces of furniture which were in\r\nhis way, and he occasionally threw them at his visionary enemies. At\r\nthe time of the murder of his child, in a somnambulistic attack, he\r\nimagined that he saw a wild beast rise up from the floor and fly at his\r\nchild, a babe of eighteen months. He sprang at the beast and dashed it\r\nto the ground, and when awakened, to his horror and overwhelming grief\r\nhe found that he had killed his beloved baby.  A similar record has\r\nbeen reported of a student who attempted during the night to stab his\r\nteacher; the man was disarmed and locked up in another portion of the\r\nbuilding; but he had not the slightest remembrance of the events of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nYellowlees speaks of homicide by a somnambulist. According to a\r\nprominent New York paper, one of the most singular and at the same time\r\nsad cases of somnambulism occurred a few years ago near Bakersville,\r\nN.C. A young man there named Garland had been in the habit of walking\r\nin his sleep since childhood. Like most other sleep-walkers when\r\nunmolested, his ramblings had been without harm to himself or others.\r\nConsequently his wife paid little attention to them. But finally he\r\nbegan to stay away from the house longer than usual and always returned\r\nsoaking wet. His wife followed him one night. Leaving his home he\r\nfollowed the highway until he came to a rough, narrow pig-trail leading\r\nto the Tow River. His wife followed with difficulty, as he picked his\r\nway through the tangled forest, over stones and fallen trees and along\r\nthe sides of precipitous cliffs. For more than a mile the sleeper\r\ntrudged on until he came to a large poplar tree, which had fallen with\r\nits topmost branches far out in the river.  Walking on the log until he\r\ncame to a large limb extending over the water, he got down on his hands\r\nand knees and began crawling out on it. The frightened wife screamed,\r\ncalling to him to wake up and come back. He was awakened by the cries,\r\nfell into the river, and was drowned. Each night for weeks he had been\r\ntaking that perilous trip, crawling out on the limb, leaping from it\r\ninto the river, swimming to the shore, and returning home unconscious\r\nof anything having happened.\r\n\r\nDreams, nightmare, and night terrors form too extensive a subject and\r\none too well known to be discussed at length here, but it might be well\r\nto mention that sometimes dreams are said to be pathognomonic or\r\nprodromal of approaching disease. Cerebral hemorrhage has often been\r\npreceded by dreams of frightful calamities, and intermittent fever is\r\noften announced by persistent and terrifying dreams. Hammond has\r\ncollected a large number of these prodromic dreams, seeming to indicate\r\nthat before the recognizable symptoms of disease present themselves a\r\nvariety of morbid dreams may occur. According to Dana, Albers says:\r\n\"Frightful dreams are signs of cerebral congestion. Dreams about fire\r\nare, in women, signs of impending hemorrhage. Dreams about blood and\r\nred objects are signs of inflammatory conditions.  Dreams of distorted\r\nforms are frequently a sign of abdominal obstruction and diseases of\r\nthe liver.\"\r\n\r\nCatalepsy, trance, and lethargy, lasting for days or weeks, are really\r\nexamples of spontaneously developed mesmeric sleep in hysteric patients\r\nor subjects of incipient insanity. If the phenomenon in these cases\r\ntakes the form of catalepsy there is a waxy-like rigidity of the\r\nmuscles which will allow the limbs to be placed in various positions,\r\nand maintain them so for minutes or even hours. In lethargy or\r\ntrance-states the patient may be plunged into a deep and prolonged\r\nunconsciousness lasting from a few hours to several years. It is in\r\nthis condition that the lay journals find argument for their stories of\r\npremature burial, and from the same source the fabulous \"sleeping\r\ngirls\" of the newspapers arise. Dana says that some persons are in the\r\nhabit of going into a mesmeric sleep spontaneously. In these states\r\nthere may be a lowering of bodily temperature, a retarding of the\r\nrespiration and heart-action, and excessive sluggishness of the action\r\nof the bowels. The patients can hear and may respond to suggestions,\r\nthough apparently insensible to painful impressions, and do not appear\r\nto smell, taste, or see; the eyes are closed, turned upward, and the\r\npupils contracted as in normal sleep.\r\n\r\nThis subject has been investigated by such authorities as Weir Mitchell\r\nand Hammond, and medical literature is full of interesting cases, many\r\ndiffering in the physiologic phenomena exhibited; some of the most\r\nstriking of these will be quoted. Van Kasthoven of Leyden reports a\r\nstrange case of a peasant of Wolkwig who, it is alleged, fell asleep on\r\nJune 29, 1706, awakening on January 11, 1707, only to fall asleep again\r\nuntil March 15th of the same year. Tuke has resurrected the remarkable\r\ncase reported by Arnold of Leicester, early in this century. The\r\npatient's name was John Engelbrecht. This man passed into a condition\r\nof catalepsy in which he heard everything about him distinctly, but in\r\nhis imagination he seemed to have passed away to another world, this\r\ncondition coming on with a suddenness which he describes as with \"far\r\nmore swiftness than any arrow can fly when discharged from a\r\ncross-bow.\" He also lost his sensation from the head downward, and\r\nrecovered it in the opposite direction. At Bologna there was observed\r\nthe case of a young female who after a profound grief had for forty-two\r\nsuccessive days a state of catalepsy lasting from midday to midnight.\r\nMuller of Lowenburg records a case of lethargy in a young female,\r\nfollowing a sudden fright in her fourteenth year, and abrupt\r\nsuppression of menstruation. This girl was really in a sleep for four\r\nyears. In the first year she was awake from one minute to six hours\r\nduring the day. In the second and third years she averaged four hours\r\nwakefulness in ninety-six hours. She took very little nourishment and\r\nsometimes had no bowel-movement for sixteen days. Scull reports the\r\nhistory of a man of twenty-seven suffering with incipient phthisis, who\r\nremained bedridden and in a state of unconsciousness for fifteen\r\nmonths. One day while being fed he spoke out and asked for a glass of\r\nwater in his usual manner, and so frightened his sister that she ran\r\nfrom the room. The man had remembered nothing that had occurred during\r\nthe fifteen months, and asked who was president and seemed eager for\r\nnews. One curious fact was that he remembered a field of oats which was\r\njust sprouting about the time he fell in the trance.  The same field\r\nwas now standing in corn knee-high. After his recovery from the trance\r\nhe rapidly became worse and died in eighteen months. There is a record\r\nof a man near Rochester, N.Y., who slept for five years, never waking\r\nfor more than sixteen hours at a time, and then only at intervals of\r\nsix weeks or over.  When seized with his trance he weighed 160, but he\r\ndwindled down to 90 pounds. He passed urine once or twice a day, and\r\nhad a stool once in from six to twenty days. Even such severe treatment\r\nas counter-irritation proved of no avail. Gunson mentions a man of\r\nforty-four, a healthy farmer, who, after being very wet and not\r\nchanging his clothes, contracted a severe cold and entered into a long\r\nand deep sleep lasting for twelve hours at a time, during which it was\r\nimpossible to waken him. This attack lasted eight or nine months, but\r\nin 1848 there was a recurrence accompanied by a slight trismus which\r\nlasted over eighteen months, and again in 1860 he was subjected to\r\nperiods of sleep lasting over twenty-four hours at a time. Blaudet\r\ndescribes a young woman of eighteen who slept forty days, and again\r\nafter her marriage in her twentieth year she slept for fifty days; it\r\nwas necessary to draw a tooth to feed her. Four years later, on Easter\r\nday, 1862, she became insensible for twelve months, with the exception\r\nof the eighth day, when she awoke and ate at the table, but fell asleep\r\nin the chair. Her sleep was so deep that nothing seemed to disturb her;\r\nher pulse was slow, the respirations scarcely perceptible, and there\r\nwere apparently no evacuations.\r\n\r\nWeir Mitchell collected 18 cases of protracted sleep, the longest\r\ncontinuing uninterruptedly for six months. Chilton's case lasted\r\nseventeen weeks. Six of the 18 cases passed a large part of each day in\r\nsleep, one case twenty-one hours, and another twenty-three hours. The\r\npatients were below middle life; ten were females, seven males, and one\r\nwas a child whose sex was not given. Eight of the 18 recovered easily\r\nand completely, two recovered with loss of intellect, one fell a victim\r\nto apoplexy four months after awakening, one recovered with insomnia as\r\na sequel, and four died in sleep. One recovered suddenly after six\r\nmonths' sleep and began to talk, resuming the train of thought where it\r\nhad been interrupted by slumber. Mitchell reports a case in an\r\nunmarried woman of forty-five. She was a seamstress of dark complexion\r\nand never had any previous symptoms. On July 20, 1865, she became\r\nseasick in a gale of wind on the Hudson, and this was followed by an\r\noccasional loss of sight and by giddiness.  Finally, in November she\r\nslept from Wednesday night to Monday at noon, and died a few days\r\nlater. Jones of New Orleans relates the case of a girl of twenty-seven\r\nwho had been asleep for the last eighteen years, only waking at certain\r\nintervals, and then remaining awake from seven to ten minutes. The\r\nsleep commenced at the age of nine, after repeated large doses of\r\nquinin and morphin. Periods of consciousness were regular, waking at 6\r\nA.M.  and every hour thereafter until noon, then at 3 P.M., again at\r\nsunset, and at 9 P.M., and once or twice before morning. The sleep was\r\ndeep, and nothing seemed to arouse her. Gairdner mentions the case of a\r\nwoman who, for one hundred and sixty days, remained in a lethargic\r\nstupor, being only a mindless automaton.  Her life was maintained by\r\nmeans of the stomach tube. The Revue d'Hypnotisme contains the report\r\nof a young woman of twenty-five, who was completing the fourth year of\r\nan uninterrupted trance.  She began May 30, 1883, after a fright, and\r\non the same day, after several convulsive attacks, she fell into a\r\nprofound sleep, during which she was kept alive by small quantities of\r\nliquid food, which she swallowed automatically. The excretions were\r\ngreatly diminished, and menstruation was suppressed. There is a case\r\nreported of a Spanish soldier of twenty-two, confined in the Military\r\nHospital of San Ambrosio, Cuba, who had been in a cataleptic state for\r\nfourteen months. His body would remain in any position in which it was\r\nplaced; defecation and micturition were normal; he occasionally sneezed\r\nor coughed, and is reported to have uttered some words at night. The\r\nstrange feature of this case was that the man was regularly nourished\r\nand increased in weight ten pounds. It was noted that, some months\r\nbefore, this patient was injured and had suffered extreme depression,\r\nwhich was attributed to nostalgia, after which he began to have\r\nintermittent and temporary attacks, which culminated as related.\r\nCamuset and Planes in January, 1896, mention a man who began to have\r\ngrand hallucinations in 1883. In March, 1884, he exhibited the first\r\nsigns of sleep, and on March 10th it was necessary to put him to bed,\r\nwhere he remained, more or less continuously for three months,\r\nawakening gradually, and regaining his normal condition by the middle\r\nof June. He was fed by hand three times daily, was placed on a\r\nnight-chair, and with one exception never evacuated in bed. Five months\r\nafterward he showed no signs of relapse. The latest report of a\r\n\"sleeping girl\" is that of the young Dutch maiden, Maria Cvetskens, of\r\nStevenswerth, who on December 5, 1895, had been asleep for two hundred\r\nand twenty days. She had been visited by a number of men of good\r\nprofessional standing who, although differing as to the cause of her\r\nprolonged sleep, universally agreed that there was no deception in the\r\ncase. Her parents were of excellent repute, and it had never occurred\r\nto them to make any financial profit out of the unnatural state of\r\ntheir daughter.\r\n\r\nHypnotism.--The phenomenon of hypnotism was doubtless known to the\r\nOriental nations, and even to the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, as\r\nwell as to other nations since the downfall of the Roman Empire. \"The\r\nfakirs of India, the musicians of Persia, the oracles of Greece, the\r\nseers of Rome, the priests and priestesses of Egypt, the monastic\r\nrecluses of the Middle Ages, the ecstatics of the seventeenth and early\r\npart of the eighteenth century exhibited many symptoms that were, and\r\nare still, attributed by religious enthusiasts to supernatural\r\nagencies, but which are explainable by what we know of hypnotism. The\r\nHesychasts of Mount Athos who remained motionless for days with their\r\ngaze directed steadily to the navel; the Taskodrugites who remained\r\nstatuesque for a long period with the finger applied to the nose; the\r\nJogins who could hibernate at will; the Dandins of India who became\r\ncataleptoid by 12,000 repetitions of the sacred word Om; St.  Simeon\r\nStylites who, perched on a lofty pillar, preserved an attitude of\r\nsaint-like withdrawal from earthly things for days; and even Socrates,\r\nof whom it was said that he would stand for hours motionless and\r\nwordless--all these are probable instances of autohypnotism.\" (Gray.)\r\n\r\nHypnotism is spoken of as a morbid mental state artificially produced,\r\nand characterized by perversion or suspension of consciousness, and\r\nabeyance of volition; a condition of suggestibility leads the patient\r\nto yield readily to commands of external sense-impressions, and there\r\nis intense concentration of the mental faculties upon some idea or\r\nfeeling. There are several methods of inducing hypnosis, one of which\r\nis to give particular direction to the subject's imagination by\r\nconcentrating the attention upon an arbitrary point, or by raising an\r\nimage of the hypnotic state in the patient's mind. The latter is most\r\nreadily induced by speech. Faria formerly strained the attention of the\r\nsubject as much as possible, and suddenly called out, \"Sleep!\" This\r\nmethod has been used by others. Physical methods consist of certain\r\nstimuli of sight, hearing, and touch. Taste and smell have generally\r\ngiven negative results. Fixation of the gaze has been the most\r\nsuccessful, but the ticking of a watch has been used. According to\r\nMoll, among uncivilized races particular instruments are used to\r\nproduce similar states, for example, the magic drum's sound among the\r\nLapps, or among other races the monotony of rhythm in song, etc.\r\nInstead of these continuous, monotonous, weak stimulations of the\r\nsenses, we find also that sudden and violent ones are made use of--for\r\nexample in the Salpetriere, the field of Charcot's work, the loud noise\r\nof a gong, or a sudden ray of light; however, it is more than doubtful\r\nwhether these sudden, strong, physical stimuli, without any mental\r\nstimuli, can induce hypnosis. Perhaps we have to do here with states\r\nnot far removed from paralysis from fright. The sense of touch is also\r\nbrought into play in hypnosis; Richet set great value on the so-called\r\nmesmeric strokes or passes. It is often stated that touches on the\r\nforehead induce a sleepy state in many persons. Hypnotism is practiced\r\nby stimulation of the muscular sense, such as cradle-rocking, used to\r\nsend little children to sleep. Similar states are said to be produced\r\namong uncivilized people by violent whirling or dancing movements; the\r\nmovements are, however, accompanied by music and other mental\r\nexcitations.\r\n\r\nHypnosis is spoken of by Huc and Hellwald of the Buddhist convents in\r\nThibet; and Sperling, who has had a particularly wide experience in the\r\nfield of hypnotism, and whose opinion is of particular value, says that\r\nhe has seen dervishes in Constantinople who, from the expression of\r\ntheir eyes and their whole appearance, as well as from peculiar\r\npostures they maintain for a long time, impressed him as being in a\r\nhypnotic state. The state may have been induced by singing and uniform\r\nwhirling motions. Hildebrandt, Jacolliot, Fischer, Hellwald, and other\r\ntrustworthy witnesses and authors tell us strange things about the\r\nfakirs of India, which set any attempt at explanation on the basis of\r\nour present scientific knowledge at defiance--that is, if we decline to\r\naccept them as mere juggler's tricks. Hypnotism seems to be the only\r\nexplanation. It is a well known fact that both wild and domestic beasts\r\ncan be hypnotized and the success of some of the animal-tamers is due\r\nto this fact. In hypnotism we see a probable explanation for the\r\nfaith-cures which have extended over many centuries, and have their\r\nanalogy in the supposed therapeutic powers of the Saints.\r\n\r\nThe medicolegal aspect of hypnotism may be called in to answer whether\r\ncrime may be committed at suggestion. Such examples have already been\r\nbefore the public in the recent trial of the Parisian strangler,\r\nEyraud. It was claimed that his accomplice in the crime, Gabrielle\r\nBompard, had been hypnotized. Bernheim narrates a case of outrage\r\neffected in the hypnotic condition, which was brought to light by a\r\ntrial in the South of France.\r\n\r\nAs to the therapeutic value of hypnotism, with the exception of some\r\nminor benefits in hysteric cases and in insomnia, the authors must\r\nconfess that its use in Medicine seems very limited.\r\n\r\nAfrican sleep-sickness is a peculiar disorder, apparently infectious in\r\ncharacter, which occurs among the negroes of the western coast of\r\nAfrica. It has been transported to other regions but is endemic in\r\nAfrica. According to Dana it begins gradually with malaise and\r\nheadache. Soon there is drowsiness after meals which increases until\r\nthe patient is nearly all the time in a stupor. When awake he is dull\r\nand apathetic. There is no fever; the temperature may be subnormal. The\r\npulse, too, is not rapid, the skin is dry, the tongue moist but coated,\r\nthe bowels regular.  The eyes become congested and prominent. The\r\ncervical glands enlarge. The disease ends in coma and death. Recovery\r\nrarely occurs. Sometimes the disease is more violent, and toward the\r\nend there are epileptic convulsions and muscular tremors. Autopsies\r\nhave revealed no pathologic changes.\r\n\r\nRecently Forbes contributes an interesting paper on the sleeping\r\nsickness of Africa. The disease may occur in either sex and at any age,\r\nthough it is most frequent from the twelfth to the twentieth years, and\r\nin the male sex. It begins with enlargement of the cervical glands, and\r\ndrowsiness and sleep at unusual hours. At first the patient may be\r\naroused, but later sinks into a heavy stupor or coma. Death occurs in\r\nfrom three to twelve months, and is due to starvation. Forbes reports\r\n11 fatal cases, and two that passed from observation. At the autopsy\r\nare found hyperemia of the arachnoid, and slight chronic\r\nleptomeningitis and pachymeningitis. There is also anemia of the\r\nbrain-substance.  In one of his cases the spleen was enlarged. He was\r\ninclined to regard the disease as a neurosis.\r\n\r\nAphasia is a disease of the faculty of language, that is, a disturbance\r\nof the processes by which we see, hear, and at the same time appreciate\r\nthe meaning of symbols. It includes also the faculty of expressing our\r\nideas to others by means of the voice, gesture, writing, etc. The\r\ntrouble may be central or in the conducting media. The varieties of\r\naphasia are:--\r\n\r\n(1) Amnesia of speech.\r\n\r\n(2) Amnesia of speech and written language.\r\n\r\n(3) Amnesia of speech, written language, and gesture.\r\n\r\nIn most cases there is no paralysis of the tongue or speech-forming\r\norgans. As a rule the intellect is unaffected, the patient has the\r\nideas, but lacks the power to give them proper expression through\r\nwords, written language, or gesture. If the patient is enable to write,\r\nthe condition is known as agraphia.  Word-blindness, word-deafness,\r\netc., are terms of different forms of aphasia.\r\n\r\nWhat was probably a case of incomplete aphasia is mentioned by Pliny,\r\nthat of Messala Corvinus who was unable to tell his own name; and many\r\ninstances of persons forgetting their names are really nothing but\r\ncases of temporary or incomplete aphasia. In some cases of incomplete\r\nand in nearly all cases of complete aphasia, involuntary sentences are\r\nejaculated. According to Seguin a reverend old gentleman affected with\r\namnesia of words was forced to utter after the sentence, \"Our Father\r\nwho art in heaven,\" the words \"let Him stay there.\" A lady seen by\r\nTrousseau would rise on the coming of a visitor to receive him with a\r\npleased and amiable expression of countenance, and show him to a chair,\r\nat the same time addressing to him the words, \"cochon, animal, fichue\r\nbete,\" French words hardly allowable in drawing-room usage. She was\r\ntotally aphasic but not paralyzed.  Women often use semi-religious\r\nexpressions like \"Oh dear,\" or \"Oh Lord.\" Men of the lower classes\r\nretain their favorite oaths remarkably. Sometimes the phrases\r\nejaculated are meaningless, as in Broca's celebrated case.\r\n\r\nAphasia may be the result of sudden strong emotions, in such cases\r\nbeing usually temporary; it may be traumatic; it may be the result of\r\neither primary or secondary malnutrition or degeneration.\r\n\r\nThere are some cases on record in which the sudden loss and the sudden\r\nreturn of the voice are quite marvelous.\r\n\r\nHabershon reports the case of a woman who on seeing one of her children\r\nscalded fell unconscious and motionless, and remained without food for\r\nthree days. It was then found that she suffered from complete aphasia.\r\nFive weeks after the incident she could articulate only in a very\r\nlimited vocabulary.\r\n\r\nIn the Philosophical Transactions Archdeacon Squire tells of the case\r\nof Henry Axford, who lost the power of articulation for four years;\r\nafter a horrible dream following a debauch he immediately regained his\r\nvoice, and thereafter he was able to articulate without difficulty.\r\n\r\nBall records a curious case of what he calls hysteric aphonia.  The\r\npatient was a young lady who for several months could neither sing nor\r\nspeak, but on hearing her sister sing a favorite song, she began to\r\nsing herself; but, although she could sing, speech did not return for\r\nseveral weeks. Ball remarks that during sleep such patients may cry out\r\nloudly in the natural voice.\r\n\r\nWadham reports the case of a boy of eighteen who was admitted to his\r\nward suffering with hemiplegia of the left side. Aphasia developed\r\nseveral days after admission and continued complete for three months.\r\nThe boy gradually but imperfectly recovered his speech. Over six months\r\nafter the original admission he was readmitted with necrosis of the\r\njaw, for which he underwent operation, and was discharged a month\r\nlater. From this time on he became progressively emaciated until his\r\ndeath, twelve months after Wadham first saw him. A postmortem\r\nexamination showed nearly total destruction of the Island of Reil,\r\npopularly called the speech-center. Jackson mentions a hemiplegic\r\npatient with aphasia who could only utter the words \"come on to me,\"\r\n\"come on,\" and \"yes\" and \"no.\" Bristowe cites the history of a sailor\r\nof thirty-six, a patient of St. Thomas Hospital, London, who suffered\r\nfrom aphasia for nine months. His case was carefully explained to him\r\nand he nodded assent to all the explanations of the process of speech\r\nas though he understood all thoroughly. He was gradually educated to\r\nspeak again by practicing the various sounds. It may be worth while to\r\nstate that after restoration of speech he spoke with his original\r\nAmerican accent.\r\n\r\nOgle quotes six cases of loss of speech after bites of venomous snakes.\r\nTwo of the patients recovered. According to Russ this strange symptom\r\nis sometimes instantaneous and in other instances it only appears after\r\nan interval of several hours. In those who survive the effects of the\r\nvenom it lasts for an indefinite period. One man seen by Russ had not\r\nonly lost his speech in consequence of the bite of a fer-de-lance\r\nsnake, but had become, and still remained, hemiplegic. In the rest of\r\nRuss's cases speech alone was abolished. Russ remarks that the\r\nintelligence was altogether intact, and sensibility and power of motion\r\nwere unaffected. One woman who had been thus condemned to silence,\r\nsuddenly under the influence of a strong excitement recovered her\r\nspeech, but when the emotion passed away speech again left her.  Ogle\r\naccounts for this peculiar manifestation of aphasia by supposing that\r\nthe poison produces spasm of the middle cerebral arteries, and when the\r\nsymptom remains a permanent defect the continuance of the aphasia is\r\nprobably due to thrombosis of arteries above the temporary constriction.\r\n\r\nAnosmia, or loss of smell, is the most common disorder of olfaction; it\r\nmay be caused by cortical lesions, olfactory nerve-changes, congenital\r\nabsence, or over-stimulation of the nerves, or it may be a symptom of\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\nOgle, after mentioning several cases of traumatic anosmia, suggests\r\nthat a blow on the occiput is generally the cause. Legg reports a\r\nconfirmatory case, but of six cases mentioned by Notta two were caused\r\nby a blow on the crown of the head, and two on the right ear. The\r\nprognosis in traumatic anosmia is generally bad, although there is a\r\nrecord of a man who fell while working on a wharf, striking his head\r\nand producing anosmia with partial loss of hearing and sight, and who\r\nfor several weeks neither smelt nor tasted, but gradually recovered.\r\n\r\nMitchell reports a case of a woman of forty who, after an injury to her\r\nnose from a fall, suffered persistent headache and loss of smell. Two\r\nyears later, at bedtime, or on going to sleep, she had a sense of\r\nhorrible odors, which were fecal or animal, and most intense in nature.\r\nThe case terminated in melancholia, with delirium of persecution,\r\nduring which the disturbance of smell passed away.\r\n\r\nAnosmia has been noticed in leukoderma and allied disturbances of\r\npigmentation. Ogle mentions a negro boy in Kentucky whose sense of\r\nsmell decreased as the leukoderma extended. Influenza, causing\r\nadhesions of the posterior pillars of the fauces, has given rise to\r\nanosmia.\r\n\r\nOccasionally overstimulation of the olfactory system may lead to\r\nanosmia. Graves mentions a captain of the yeomanry corps who while\r\ninvestigating the report that 500 pikes were concealed at the bottom of\r\na cesspool in one of the city markets superintended the emptying of the\r\ncesspool, at the bottom of which the arms were found. He suffered\r\ngreatly from the abominable effluvia, and for thirty-six years\r\nafterward he remained completely deprived of the sense of smell.\r\n\r\nIn a discussion upon anosmia before the Medico-Chirurgical Association\r\nof London, January 25, 1870, there was an anosmic patient mentioned who\r\nwas very fond of the bouquet of moselle, and Carter mentioned that he\r\nknew a man who had lost both the senses of taste and smell, but who\r\nclaimed that he enjoyed putrescent meat. Leared spoke of a case in an\r\nepileptic affected with loss of taste and smell, and whose paroxysms\r\nwere always preceded by an odor of peach-blossoms.\r\n\r\nHyperosmia is an increase in the perception of smell, which rarely\r\noccurs in persons other than the hysteric and insane. It may be\r\ncultivated as a compensatory process, as in the blind, or those engaged\r\nin particular pursuits, such as tea-tasting.  Parosmia is a rare\r\ncondition, most often a symptom of hysteria or neurasthenia, in which\r\neverything smells of a similar, peculiar, offensive odor.\r\nHallucinations of odor are sometimes noticed in the insane. They form\r\nmost obstinate cases, when the hallucination gives rise to imaginary\r\ndisagreeable, personal odors.\r\n\r\nPerversion of the tactile sense, or wrong reference to the sensation of\r\npain, has occasionally been noticed. The Ephemerides records a case in\r\nwhich there was the sense of two objects from a single touch on the\r\nhypochondrium. Weir Mitchell remarks that soldiers often misplace the\r\nlocation of pain after injuries in battle. He also mentions several\r\ncases of wrong reference of the sensation of pain. These instances\r\ncannot be called reflex disturbances, and are most interesting. In one\r\ncase the patient felt the pain from a urethral injection in gonorrhea,\r\non the top of the head. In another an individual let an omnibus-window\r\nfall on his finger, causing but brief pain in the finger, but violent\r\npains in the face and neck of that side. Mitchell also mentions a\r\nnaturalist of distinction who had a small mole on one leg which, if\r\nroughly rubbed or pinched, invariably seemed to cause a sharp pain in\r\nthe chin.\r\n\r\nNostalgia is the name generally given to that variety of melancholia in\r\nwhich there is an intense longing for home or country. This subject has\r\napparently been overlooked in recent years, but in the olden times it\r\nwas extensively discussed.  Swinger, Harderus, Tackius, Guerbois,\r\nHueber, Therrin, Castellanau, Pauquet, and others have written\r\nextensively upon this theme. It is said that the inhabitants of cold\r\ncountries, such as the Laplanders and the Danes, are the most\r\nsusceptible to this malady. For a long time many writers spoke of the\r\nfrequency and intensity of nostalgia among the Swiss. Numerous cases of\r\nsuicide from this affliction have been noticed among these hardy\r\nmountaineers, particularly on hearing the mountain-song of their homes,\r\n\"Ranz des vaches.\" This statement, which is an established fact, is\r\npossibly due to the social constitution of the Swiss mountaineers, who\r\nare brought up to a solitary home life, and who universally exhibit\r\ngreat attachment to and dependence upon their parents and immediate\r\nfamily. In the European armies nostalgia has always been a factor in\r\nmortality. In the Army of the Moselle, and in Napoleon's Alpine Army,\r\nthe terrible ravages of suicide among the young Bretons affected with\r\nnostalgia have been recorded; it is among the French people that most\r\nof the investigation on this subject has been done. Moreau speaks of a\r\nyoung soldier in a foreign country and army who fell into a most\r\nprofound melancholy when, by accident, he heard his native tongue.\r\nAccording to Swinger and Sauvages women are less subject to nostalgia\r\nthan men. Nostalgia has been frequently recorded in hospital wards.\r\nPercy and Laurent have discussed this subject very thoroughly, and cite\r\nseveral interesting cases among emigrants, soldiers, marines, etc.\r\nHamilton speaks of a recruit who became prostrated by longing for his\r\nhome in Wales. He continually raved, but recovered from his delirium\r\nwhen assured by the hospital authorities of his forthcoming furlough.\r\nTaylor records two cases of fatal nostalgia. One of the victims was a\r\nUnion refugee who went to Kentucky from his home in Tennessee. He died\r\ntalking about and pining for his home. The second patient was a member\r\nof a regiment of colored infantry; he died after repeatedly pining for\r\nhis old home.\r\n\r\nAnimals are sometimes subject to nostalgia, and instances are on record\r\nin which purchasers have been compelled to return them to the old home\r\non account of their literal home-sickness. Oswald tells of a bear who,\r\nin the presence of food, committed suicide by starvation.\r\n\r\nHypochondria consists of a mild form of insanity in which there is a\r\ntendency to exaggerate the various sensations of the body and their\r\nimportance, their exaggeration being at times so great as to amount to\r\nactual delusion. All sorts of symptoms are dwelt upon, and the doctor\r\nis pestered to the extreme by the morbid fears of the patient.\r\n\r\nMorbid fears or impulses, called by the Germans Zwangsvorstellungen, or\r\nZwangshandlungen, and by the French, peurs maladies, have only been\r\nquite recently studied, and form most interesting cases of minor\r\ninsanity. Gelineau has made extensive investigations in this subject,\r\nand free reference has been made to his work in the preparation of the\r\nfollowing material.\r\n\r\nAichmophobia is a name given by the French to the fear of the sight of\r\nany sharp-pointed instrument, such as a pin, needle, fish-spine, or\r\nnaked sword. An illustrious sufferer of this 'phobia was James I of\r\nEngland, who could never tolerate the appearance of a drawn sword.\r\nGelineau reports an interesting case of a female who contracted this\r\nmalady after the fatigue of lactation of two children. She could not\r\ntolerate knives, forks, or any pointed instruments on the table, and\r\nwas apparently rendered helpless in needle-work on account of her\r\ninability to look at the pointed needle.\r\n\r\nAgoraphobia is dread of an open space, and is sometimes called\r\nKenophobia. The celebrated philosopher Pascal was supposed to have been\r\naffected with this fear. In agoraphobia the patient dreads to go across\r\na street or into a field, is seized with an intense feeling of fright,\r\nand has to run to a wall or fall down, being quite unable to proceed.\r\nThere is violent palpitation, and a feeling of constriction is\r\nexperienced. According to Suckling, pallor and profuse perspiration are\r\nusually present, but there is no vertigo, confusion of mind, or loss of\r\nconsciousness. The patient is quite conscious of the foolishness of the\r\nfears, but is unable to overcome them. The will is in abeyance and is\r\nquite subservient to the violent emotional disturbances. Gray mentions\r\na patient who could not go over the Brooklyn Bridge or indeed over any\r\nbridge without terror. Roussel speaks of a married woman who had never\r\nhad any children, and who was apparently healthy, but who for the past\r\nsix months had not been able to put her head out of the window or go\r\nupon a balcony. When she descended into the street she was unable to\r\ntraverse the open spaces. Chazarin mentions a case in a woman of fifty,\r\nwithout any other apparent symptom of diathesis. Gelineau quotes a case\r\nof agoraphobia, secondary to rheumatism, in a woman of thirty-nine.\r\nThere is a corresponding fear of high places often noticed, called\r\nacrophobia; so that many people dare not trust themselves on high\r\nbuildings or other eminences.\r\n\r\nThalassophobia is the fear of the view of immense spaces or\r\nuninterrupted expanses. The Emperor Heraclius, at the age of\r\nfifty-nine, had an insurmountable fear of the view of the sea; and it\r\nis said that when he crossed the Bosphorus a bridge of boats was\r\nformed, garnished on both sides with plants and trees, obscuring all\r\nview of the water over which the Emperor peacefully traversed on\r\nhorseback. The moralist Nicole, was equally a thalassophobe, and always\r\nhad to close his eyes at the sight of a large sheet of water, when he\r\nwas seized with trembling in all his limbs. Occasionally some accident\r\nin youth has led to an aversion to traversing large sheets of water,\r\nand there have been instances in which persons who have fallen into the\r\nwater in childhood have all their lives had a terror of crossing\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nClaustrophobia is the antithesis of agoraphobia. Raggi describes a case\r\nof such a mental condition in a patient who could not endure being\r\nwithin an enclosure or small space. Suckling mentions a patient of\r\nfifty-six who suffered from palpitation when shut in a railway carriage\r\nor in a small room. She could only travel by rail or go into a small\r\nroom so long as the doors were not locked, and on the railroad she had\r\nto bribe the guard to leave the doors unlocked. The attacks were purely\r\nmental, for the woman could be deceived into believing that the door to\r\na railroad carriage was unlocked, and then the attack would immediately\r\nsubside. Suckling also mentions a young woman brought to him at Queen's\r\nHospital who had a great fear of death on getting into a tram car, and\r\nwas seized with palpitation and trembling on merely seeing the car.\r\nThis patient had been in an asylum. The case was possibly due more to\r\nfear of an accident than to true claustrophobia. Gorodoichze mentions a\r\ncase of claustrophobia in a woman of thirty-eight, in whose family\r\nthere was a history of hereditary insanity. Ball speaks of a case in a\r\nwoman who was overcome with terror half way in the ascension of the\r\nTour Saint-Jacques, when she believed the door below was closed.\r\nGelineau quotes the case of a brave young soldier who was believed to\r\nbe afraid of nothing, but who was unable to sleep in a room of which\r\nthe door was closed.\r\n\r\nAstrophobia or astropaphobia is a morbid fear of being struck by\r\nlightning. It was first recognized by Bruck of Westphalia, who knew a\r\npriest who was always in terror when on a country road with an\r\nunobstructed view of the sky, but who was reassured when he was under\r\nthe shelter of trees. He was advised by an old physician always to use\r\nan umbrella to obstruct his view of the heavens, and in this way his\r\njourneys were made tranquil. Beard knew an old woman who had suffered\r\nall her life from astrophobia.  Her grandmother had presented the same\r\nsusceptibility and the same fears. Sometimes she could tell the\r\napproach of a storm by her nervous symptoms. Caligula, Augustus, Henry\r\nIII, and other celebrated personages, were overcome with fear during a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nMysophobia is a mild form of insanity characterized by a dread of the\r\ncontact of dirt. It was named by Hammond, whose patient washed her\r\nhands innumerable times a day, so great was the fear of contamination.\r\nThese patients make the closest inspection of their toilet, their\r\neating and drinking utensils, and all their lives are intensely worried\r\nby fear of dirt.\r\n\r\nHematophobia is a horror of blood, which seems to be an instinctive\r\nsentiment in civilized man, but which is unknown among savages. When\r\nthe horror is aggravated to such an extent as to cause distressing\r\nsymptoms or unconsciousness, it takes the name of hematophobia. There\r\nare many cases on record and nearly every physician has seen one or\r\nmore, possibly among his colleagues.\r\n\r\nNecrophobia and thanatophobia are allied maladies, one being the fear\r\nof dead bodies and the other the fear of death itself.\r\n\r\nAnthropophobia is a symptom of mental disease consisting in fear of\r\nsociety. Beard, Mitchell, Baillarger, and others have made observations\r\non this disease. The antithesis of this disease is called monophobia.\r\nPatients are not able to remain by themselves for even the shortest\r\nlength of time. This morbid dread of being alone is sometimes so great\r\nthat even the presence of an infant is an alleviation. Gelineau cites\r\nan instance in a man of forty-five which was complicated with\r\nagoraphobia.\r\n\r\nBacillophobia is the result of abnormal pondering over bacteriology.\r\nHuchard's case was in a woman of thirty-eight who, out of curiosity,\r\nhad secretly read the works of Pasteur, and who seemed to take\r\nparticular pleasure in conning over the causes of death in the\r\nhealth-reports. Goyard mentions an instance in a Swiss veterinary\r\nsurgeon.\r\n\r\nKleptophobia, examples of which have been cited by Cullere, is the fear\r\nof stealing objects in view, and is often the prelude of kleptomania.\r\nThe latter disease has gained notoriety in this country, and nearly\r\nevery large store has agents to watch the apparently growing number of\r\nkleptomaniacs. These unfortunate persons, not seldom from the highest\r\nclasses of society, are unable to combat an intense desire to purloin\r\narticles. Legal proceedings have been instituted against many, and\r\nspecialists have been called into court to speak on this question.\r\nRelatives and friends have been known to notify the large stores of the\r\nthieving propensities of such patients.\r\n\r\nLe Grande du Saulle has given to the disease in which there is a morbid\r\ndoubt about everything done, the name folie de doute. Gray mentions a\r\ncase in a patient who would go out of a door, close it, and then come\r\nback, uncertain as to whether he had closed it, close it again, go off\r\na little way, again feel uncertain as to whether he had closed it\r\nproperly, go back again, and so on for many times. Hammond relates the\r\nhistory of a case in an intelligent man who in undressing for bed would\r\nspend an hour or two determining whether he should first take off his\r\ncoat or his shoes. In the morning he would sit for an hour with his\r\nstockings in his hands, unable to determine which he should put on\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nSyphilophobia is morbid fear of syphilis. Lyssophobia is a fear of\r\nhydrophobia which sometimes assumes all the symptoms of the major\r\ndisease, and even produces death. Gelineau, Colin, Berillon, and others\r\nhave studied cases. In Berillon's case the patient was an artist, a\r\nwoman of brunet complexion, who for six years had been tormented with\r\nthe fear of becoming mad, and in whom the symptoms became so intense as\r\nto constitute pseudobydrophobia. At their subsidence she was the victim\r\nof numerous hallucinations which almost drove her to the point of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nSpermatophobia has been noticed among the ignorant, caused or increased\r\nby inspection of sensational literature, treatises on the subject of\r\nspermatorrhea, etc. Ferre mentions a woman of thirty-six, of intense\r\nreligious scruples, who was married at eighteen, and lost her husband\r\nsix years afterward. She had a proposition of marriage which she\r\nrefused, and was prostrated by the humid touch of the proposer who had\r\nkissed her hand, imagining that the humidity was due to semen. She was\r\nseveral times overcome by contact with men in public conveyances, her\r\nfear of contamination being so great. Zoophobia, or dread of certain\r\nanimals, has been mentioned under another chapter under the head of\r\nidiosyncrasies. Pantophobia is a general state of fear of everything\r\nand everybody. Phobophobia, the fear of being afraid, is another\r\ncoinage of the wordmakers. The minor 'phobias, such as pyrophobia, or\r\nfear of fire; stasophobia, or inability to arise and walk, the victims\r\nspending all their time in bed; toxicophobia or fear of poison, etc.,\r\nwill be left to the reader's inspection in special works on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nDemonomania is a form of madness in which a person imagines himself\r\npossessed of the devil. Ancient records of this disease are frequent,\r\nand in this century Lapointe reports the history of demonomania in\r\nfather, mother, three sons, and two daughters, the whole family, with\r\nthe exception of one son, who was a soldier, being attacked. They\r\nimagined themselves poisoned by a sorceress, saw devils, and had all\r\nsorts of hallucinations, which necessitated the confinement of the\r\nwhole family in an asylum for over a month. They continued free from\r\nthe hallucinations for two years, when first the mother, and then\r\ngradually all the other members of the family, again became afflicted\r\nwith demonomania and were again sent to the asylum, when, after a\r\nresidence therein of five months, they were all sufficiently cured to\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\nParticular aversions may be temporary only, that is, due to an existing\r\ncondition of the organism, which, though morbid, is of a transitory\r\ncharacter. Such, for instance, are those due to dentition, the\r\ncommencement or cessation of the menstrual function, pregnancy, etc.\r\nThese cases are frequently of a serious character, and may lead to\r\nderangement of the mind. Millington relates the history of a lady who,\r\nat the beginning of her first pregnancy, acquired an overpowering\r\naversion to a half-breed Indian woman who was employed in the house as\r\na servant. Whenever this woman came near her she was at once seized\r\nwith violent trembling; this ended in a few minutes with vomiting and\r\ngreat mental and physical prostration lasting several hours. Her\r\nhusband would have sent the woman away, but Mrs. X insisted on her\r\nremaining, as she was a good servant, in order that she might overcome\r\nwhat she regarded as an unreasonable prejudice. The effort was,\r\nhowever, too great, for upon one occasion when the woman entered Mrs.\r\nX's apartment rather unexpectedly, the latter became greatly excited,\r\nand, jumping from an open window in her fright, broke her arm, and\r\notherwise injured herself so severely that she was confined to her bed\r\nfor several weeks. During this period, and for some time afterward, she\r\nwas almost constantly subject to hallucinations, in which the Indian\r\nwoman played a prominent part. Even after her recovery the mere thought\r\nof the woman would sometimes bring on a paroxysm of trembling, and it\r\nwas not till after her confinement that the antipathy disappeared.\r\n\r\nCircular or periodic insanity is a rare psychosis. According to Drewry\r\nreports of very few cases have appeared in the medical journals. \"Some\r\nsystematic writers,\" says Drewry, \"regard it as a mere subdivision of\r\nperiodic insanity (Spitzka). A distinguished alienist and author of\r\nScotland however has given us an admirable lecture on the subject. He\r\nsays: 'I have had under my care altogether about 40 cases of typical\r\nfolie circulaire.' In the asylum at Morningside there were, says Dr.\r\nClouston, in 800 patients 16 cases of this peculiar form of mental\r\ndisease. Dr. Spitzka, who was the first American to describe it, found\r\nin 2300 cases of pauper insane four per cent to be periodic, and its\r\nsub-group, circular, insanity. Dr. Stearns states that less than\r\none-fourth of one per cent of cases in the Hartford (Conn.) Retreat\r\nclassed as mania and melancholia have proved to be folie circulaire.\r\nUpon examination of the annual reports of the superintendents of\r\nhospitals for the insane in this country, in only a few are references\r\nmade to this as a distinct form of insanity. In the New York State\r\nhospitals there is a regular uniform classification of mental diseases\r\nin which 'circular (alternating) insanity' occupies a place. In the\r\nreport of the Buffalo Hospital for 1892, in statistical table No. 4,\r\n'showing forms of insanity in those admitted, etc., since 1888,' out of\r\n1428 cases, only one was 'alternating (circular) insanity.' In the St.\r\nLawrence Hospital only one case in 992 was credited to this special\r\nclass. In the institution in Philadelphia, of which Dr. Chapin is the\r\nsuperintendent, 10,379 patients have been treated, only three of whom\r\nwere diagnosed cases of manie circulaire. Of the 900 cases of insanity\r\nin the State Hospital at Danville, Pa., less than four per cent were\r\nput in this special class. There are in the Central (Va.) State\r\nHospital (which is exclusively for the colored insane) 775 patients,\r\nthree of whom are genuine cases of circular insanity, but they are\r\nincluded in 'periodic insanity.' This same custom evidently prevails in\r\nmany of the other hospitals for the insane.\"\r\n\r\nDrewry reports three cases of circular insanity, one of which was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"William F., a negro, thirty-six years old, of fair education, steady,\r\nsober habits, was seized with gloomy depression a few weeks prior to\r\nhis admission to this hospital, in September, 1886. This condition came\r\non after a period of fever. He was a stranger in the vicinity and\r\nscarcely any information could be obtained regarding his antecedents.\r\nWhen admitted he was in a state of melancholic hypochondriasis; he was\r\nthe very picture of abject misery. Many imaginary ills troubled his\r\npeace of mind. He spoke of committing suicide, but evidently for the\r\npurpose of attracting attention and sympathy. On one occasion he said\r\nhe intended to kill himself, but when the means to do so were placed at\r\nhis command, he said he would do the deed at another time. The most\r\ntrivial physical disturbances were exaggerated into very serious\r\ndiseases. From this state of morbid depression he slowly emerged, grew\r\nbrighter, more energetic, neater in personal appearance, etc. During\r\nthis period of slow transition or partial sanity he was taken out on\r\nthe farm where he proved to be a careful and industrious laborer. He\r\nescaped, and when brought back to the hospital a few weeks subsequently\r\nhe was in a condition of great excitement and hilarity. His expression\r\nwas animated, and he was, as it were, overflowing with superabundance\r\nof spirit, very loquacious, and incessantly moving. He bore an air of\r\ngreat importance and self-satisfaction; said he felt perfectly well and\r\nhappy, but abused the officers for keeping him 'confined unjustly in a\r\nlunatic asylum.' It was his habit almost daily, if not interfered with,\r\nto deliver a long harangue to his fellow-patients, during which he\r\nwould become very excited and noisy. He showed evidences of having a\r\nremarkable memory, particularly regarding names and dates. (Unusual\r\nmemory is frequently observed in this type of insanity, says Stearns.)\r\nHe was sometimes disposed to be somewhat destructive to furniture,\r\netc., was neat in person, but would frequently dress rather\r\n'gorgeously,' wearing feathers and the like in his hat, etc. He was not\r\noften noisy and sleepless at night, and then only for a short time. His\r\nphysical health was good. This 'mental intoxication,' as it were,\r\nlasted nearly a year. After this long exacerbation of excitement there\r\nwas a short remission and then depression again set in, which lasted\r\nabout fifteen months. At this time this patient is in the depressed\r\nstage or period of the third circle. So, thus the cycles have\r\ncontinuously repeated their weary rounds, and in all probability they\r\nwill keep this up 'until the final capitation in the battle of life has\r\ntaken place.'\"\r\n\r\nKatatonia, according to Gray, is a cerebral disease of cyclic symptoms,\r\nranging in succession from primary melancholia to mania, confusion, and\r\ndementia, one or more of these stages being occasionally absent, while\r\nconvulsive and epileptoid symptoms accompany the mental changes.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly impossible to enter into the manifold forms and\r\ninstances of insanity in this volume, but there is one case, seldom\r\nquoted, which may be of interest. It appeared under the title, \"A\r\nModern Pygmalion.\" It recorded a history of a man named Justin, who\r\ndied in the Bicetre Insane Asylum. He had been an exhibitor of wax\r\nworks at Montrouge, and became deeply impressed with the beautiful\r\nproportions of the statue of a girl in his collection, and ultimately\r\nbecame intensely enamored with her. He would spend hours in\r\ncontemplation of the inanimate object of his affections, and finally\r\nhad the illusion that the figure, by movements of features, actually\r\nresponded to his devotions.  Nemesis as usual at last arrived, and the\r\nwife of Justin, irritated by his long neglect, in a fit of jealousy\r\ndestroyed the wax figure, and this resulted in a murderous attack on\r\nhis wife by Justin who resented the demolition of his love. He was\r\nfinally secured and lodged in Bicetre, where he lived for five years\r\nunder the influence of his lost love.\r\n\r\nAn interesting condition, which has been studied more in France than\r\nelsewhere, is double consciousness, dual personality, or, as it is\r\ncalled by the Germans, Doppelwahrnehmungen. In these peculiar cases an\r\nindividual at different times seems to lead absolutely different\r\nexistences. The idea from a moralist's view is inculcated in\r\nStevenson's \"Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde.\" In an article on this subject\r\nWeir Mitchell illustrated his paper by examples, two of which will be\r\nquoted. The first was the case of Mary Reynolds who, when eighteen\r\nyears of age, became subject to hysteric attacks, and on one occasion\r\nshe continued blind and deaf for a period of five or six weeks. Her\r\nhearing returned suddenly, and her sight gradually. About three months\r\nafterward she was discovered in a profound sleep. Her memory had fled,\r\nand she was apparently a new-born individual. When she awoke it became\r\napparent that she had totally forgotten her previous existence, her\r\nparents, her country, and the house where she lived. She might be\r\ncompared to an immature child. It was necessary to recommence her\r\neducation. She was taught to write, and wrote from right to left, as in\r\nthe Semitic languages. She had only five or six words at her\r\ncommand--mere reflexes of articulation which were to her devoid of\r\nmeaning. The labor of re-education, conducted methodically, lasted from\r\nseven to eight weeks. Her character had experienced as great a change\r\nas her memory; timid to excess in the first state, she became gay,\r\nunreserved, boisterous, daring, even to rashness. She strolled through\r\nthe woods and the mountains, attracted by the dangers of the wild\r\ncountry in which she lived. Then she had a fresh attack of sleep, and\r\nreturned to her first condition; she recalled all the memories and\r\nagain assumed a melancholy character, which seemed to be aggravated. No\r\nconscious memory of the second state existed. A new attack brought back\r\nthe second state, with the phenomenon of consciousness which\r\naccompanied it the first time.  The patient passed successively a great\r\nmany times from one of these states to the other. These repeated\r\nchanges stretched over a period of sixteen years. At the end of that\r\ntime the variations ceased. The patient was then thirty-six years of\r\nage; she lived in a mixed state, but more closely resembling the second\r\nthan the first; her character was neither sad nor boisterous, but more\r\nreasonable. She died at the age of sixty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe second case was that of an itinerant Methodist minister named\r\nBourne, living in Rhode Island, who one day left his home and found\r\nhimself, or rather his second self, in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Having\r\na little money, he bought a small stock in trade, and instead of being\r\na minister of the gospel under the Methodist persuasion, he kept a\r\ncandy shop under the name of A.  J. Brown, paid his rent regularly, and\r\nacted like other people.  At last, in the middle of the night, he awoke\r\nto his former consciousness, and finding himself in a strange place,\r\nsupposed he had made a mistake and might be taken for a burglar. He was\r\nfound in a state of great alarm by his neighbors, to whom he stated\r\nthat he was a minister, and that his home was in Rhode Island. His\r\nfriends were sent for and recognized him, and he returned to his home\r\nafter an absence of two years of absolutely foreign existence. A most\r\ncareful investigation of the case was made on behalf of the London\r\nSociety for Psychical Research.\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive paper on this subject, written by Richard Hodgson in the\r\nproceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, states that Mr.\r\nBourne had in early life shown a tendency to abnormal psychic\r\nconditions; but he had never before engaged in trade, and nothing could\r\nbe remembered which would explain why he had assumed the name A. J.\r\nBrown, under which he did business. He had, however, been hypnotized\r\nwhen young and made to assume various characters on the stage, and it\r\nis possible that the name A. J. Brown was then suggested to him, the\r\nname resting in his memory, to be revived and resumed when he again\r\nwent into a hypnotic trance.\r\n\r\nAlfred Binet describes a case somewhat similar to that of Mary\r\nReynolds: \"Felida, a seamstress, from 1858 up to the present time (she\r\nis still living) has been under the care of a physician named Azam in\r\nBordeaux. Her normal, or at least her usual, disposition when he first\r\nmet her was one of melancholy and disinclination to talk, conjoined\r\nwith eagerness for work.  Nevertheless her actions and her answers to\r\nall questions were found to be perfectly rational. Almost every day she\r\npassed into a second state. Suddenly and without the slightest\r\npremonition save a violent pain in the temples she would fall into a\r\nprofound slumber-like languor, from which she would awake in a few\r\nmoments a totally different being. She was now as gay and cheery as she\r\nhad formerly been morose. Her imagination was over-excited.  Instead of\r\nbeing indifferent to everything, she had become alive to excess. In\r\nthis state she remembered everything that had happened in the other\r\nsimilar states that had preceded it, and also during her normal life.\r\nBut when at the end of an hour or two the languor reappeared, and she\r\nreturned to her normal melancholy state, she could not recall anything\r\nthat had happened in her second, or joyous, stage. One day, just after\r\npassing into the second stage, she attended the funeral of an\r\nacquaintance.  Returning in a cab she felt the period coming on which\r\nshe calls her crisis (normal state). She dozed several seconds, without\r\nattracting the attention of the ladies who were in the cab, and awoke\r\nin the other state, absolutely at a loss to know why she was in a\r\nmourning carriage with people who, according to custom, were praising\r\nthe qualities of a deceased person whose name she did not even know.\r\nAccustomed to such positions, she waited; by adroit questions she\r\nmanaged to understand the situation, and no one suspected what had\r\nhappened. Once when in her abnormal condition she discovered that her\r\nhusband had a mistress, and was so overcome that she sought to commit\r\nsuicide. Yet in her normal mind she meets the woman with perfect\r\nequilibrium and forgetfulness of any cause for quarrel. It is only in\r\nher abnormal state that the jealousy recurs. As the years went on the\r\nsecond state became her usual condition. That which was at first\r\naccidental and abnormal now constitutes the regular center of her\r\npsychic life. It is rather satisfactory to chronicle that as between\r\nthe two egos which alternately possess her, the more cheerful has\r\nfinally reached the ascendant.\"\r\n\r\nJackson reports the history of the case of a young dry-goods clerk who\r\nwas seized with convulsions of a violent nature during which he became\r\nunconscious. In the course of twenty-four hours his convulsions abated,\r\nand about the third day he imagined himself in New York paying court to\r\na lady, and having a rival for her favors; an imaginary quarrel and\r\nduel ensued. For a half-hour on each of three days he would start\r\nexactly where he had left off on the previous day. His eyes were open\r\nand to all appearances he was awake during this peculiar delirium. When\r\nasked what he had been doing he would assert that he had been asleep.\r\nHis language assumed a refinement above his ordinary discourse. In\r\nproportion as his nervous system became composed, and his strength\r\nimproved, this unnatural manifestation of consciousness disappeared,\r\nand he ultimately regained his health.\r\n\r\nA further example of this psychologic phenomenon was furnished quite\r\nmeetly at a meeting of the Clinical Society of London, where a well\r\nknown physician exhibited a girl of twelve, belonging to a family of\r\ngood standing, who displayed in the most complete and indubitable form\r\nthis condition of dual existence. A description of the case is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"Last year, after a severe illness which was diagnosed to be\r\nmeningitis, she became subject to temporary attacks of unconsciousness,\r\non awakening from which she appeared in an entirely different\r\ncharacter. In her normal condition she could read and write and speak\r\nfluently, and with comparative correctness. In the altered mental\r\ncondition following the attack she loses all memory for ordinary\r\nevents, though she can recall things that have taken place during\r\nprevious attacks. So complete is this alteration of memory, that at\r\nfirst she was unable to remember her own name or to identify herself or\r\nher parents. By patient training in the abnormal condition she has been\r\nenabled to give things their names, though she still preserves a\r\nbaby-fashion of pronouncing. She sometimes remains in the abnormal\r\ncondition for days together and the change to her real self takes place\r\nsuddenly, without exciting surprise or dismay, and she forthwith\r\nresumes possession of her memory for events of her ordinary life.\r\nDuring the last month or two she appears to have entered on a new\r\nphase, for after a mental blank of a fortnight's duration she awakened\r\ncompletely oblivious of all that had happened since June, 1895, and she\r\nalludes to events that took place just anterior to that date as though\r\nthey were of recent occurrence; in fact she is living mentally in July,\r\n1895.  These cases, though rare, are of course not infrequently met\r\nwith, and they have been carefully studied, especially in France, where\r\nwomen appear more prone to neurotic manifestations. The hypothesis that\r\nfinds most favor is that the two halves of the brain do not work in\r\nunison; in other words, that there has been some interference with the\r\nconnections which in the ordinary normal being make of a wonderful\r\ncomposite organ like the brain one organic whole.\"\r\n\r\nProust tells a story of a Parisian barrister of thirty-three. His\r\nfather was a heavy drinker, his mother subject to nervous attacks, his\r\nyounger brother mentally deficient, and the patient himself was very\r\nimpressionable. It was said that a judge in a court, by fixing his gaze\r\non him, could send him into an abnormal state. On one occasion, while\r\nlooking into a mirror in a cafe, he suddenly fell into a sleep, and was\r\ntaken to the Charite where he was awakened. He suffered occasional loss\r\nof memory for considerable lengths of time, and underwent a change of\r\npersonality during these times. Though wide awake in such conditions he\r\ncould remember nothing of his past life, and when returned to his\r\noriginal state he could remember nothing that occurred during his\r\nsecondary state, having virtually two distinct memories. On September\r\n23, 1888, he quarreled with his stepfather in Paris and became his\r\nsecond self for three weeks.  He found himself in a village 100 miles\r\nfrom Paris, remembering nothing about his journey thereto; but on\r\ninquiry he found that he had paid a visit to the priest of the village\r\nwho thought his conduct odd, and he had previously stayed with an\r\nuncle, a bishop, in whose house he had broken furniture, torn up\r\nletters, and had even had sentence passed upon him by a police court\r\nfor misdemeanor. During these three weeks he had spent the equivalent\r\nof $100, but he could not recall a single item of expenditure.  Davies\r\ncites a remarkable case of sudden loss of memory in a man who, while on\r\nhis way to Australia, was found by the police in an exhausted condition\r\nand who was confined in the Kent County Insane Asylum. He suffered\r\nabsolute loss of all memory with the exception of the names of two men\r\nnot close acquaintances, both of whom failed to recognize him in his\r\nchanged condition in confinement. Four months later his memory returned\r\nand his identity was established.\r\n\r\nIn the Revue Philosophique for 1885 there are the details of a case of\r\na young man who seemed able to assume six states of what might be\r\nfairly called different personalities. The memories attached to each of\r\nthese states were very different, though only one was completely\r\nexclusive of the others. The handwriting varied from complete\r\ncompetence to complete incompetence. His character varied between\r\nchildish timidity, courteous reserve, and reckless arrogance; and to\r\nfour of his conditions there was a form of hysteric paralysis attached.\r\nMere suggestion would not only induce any one of these varied forms of\r\nparalysis, but also the memories, capacities, and characters habitually\r\naccompanying it.\r\n\r\nA young man named Spencer, an inmate of the Philadelphia Hospital, was\r\nexhibited before the American Neurological Society in June, 1896, as an\r\nexample of dual personality. At the time of writing he is and has been\r\nin apparently perfect health, with no evidence of having been in any\r\nother condition. His faculties seem perfect, his education manifests\r\nitself in his intelligent performance of the cleric duties assigned to\r\nhim at the hospital, yet the thread of continuous recollection which\r\nconnects the present moment with its predecessors--consciousness and\r\nmemory--has evidently been snapped at some point of time prior to March\r\n3d and after January 19th, the last date at which he wrote to his\r\nparents, and as if in a dream, he is now living another life. The\r\nhospital staff generally believe that the man is not \"shamming,\" as\r\nmany circumstances seem to preclude that theory.  His memory is perfect\r\nas to everything back to March 3d. The theory of hypnotism was advanced\r\nin explanation of this case.\r\n\r\nThe morbid sympathy of twin brothers, illustrated in Dumas's \"Corsican\r\nBrothers,\" has been discussed by Sedgwick, Elliotson, Trousseau,\r\nLaycock, Cagentre, and others. Marshall Hall relates what would seem to\r\nverify the Corsican myth, the history of twin brothers nine months of\r\nage, who always became simultaneously affected with restlessness,\r\nwhooping and crowing in breathing three weeks previous to simultaneous\r\nconvulsions, etc. Rush describes a case of twin brothers dwelling in\r\nentirely different places, who had the same impulse at the same time,\r\nand who eventually committed suicide synchronously. Baunir describes a\r\nsimilar development of suicidal tendency in twin brothers. A peculiar\r\ncase of this kind was that of the twin brothers Laustand who were\r\nnurses in a hospital at Bordeaux; they invariably became ill at the\r\nsame time, and suffered cataract of the lens together.\r\n\r\nAutomatism has been noticed as a sequel to cranial injuries, and Huxley\r\nquotes a remarkable case reported by Mesnet. The patient was a young\r\nman whose parietal bone was partially destroyed by a ball. He exhibited\r\nsigns of hemiplegia on the right side, but these soon disappeared and\r\nhe became subject to periodic attacks lasting from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours, during which he was a mere automaton. In these\r\nattacks he walked continually, incessantly moving his jaw, but not\r\nuttering a word. He was insensible to pain, electric shock, or\r\npin-prick. If a pen was placed in his hand he would write a good\r\nletter, speaking sensibly about current topics. When a cigarette-paper\r\nwas placed in his hand he sought his tobacco box, and adroitly rolled a\r\ncigarette and lighted it. If the light went out he procured another,\r\nbut would not allow another to substitute a match. He allowed his\r\nmustache to be burned without resistance, but would not allow a light\r\nto be presented to him. If chopped charpie was put in his pocket\r\ninstead of tobacco he knew no difference. While in his periods of\r\nautomatism he was in the habit of stealing everything within his grasp.\r\nHe had been a concert singer, and a peculiar fact was that if given\r\nwhite gloves he would carefully put them on and commence a pantomime of\r\nthe actions of a singer, looking over his music, bowing, assuming his\r\nposition, and then singing.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly in hypnotic subjects that manifestations of\r\nautomatism are most marked. At the suggestion of battle an imaginary\r\nstruggle at once begins, or if some person present is suggested as an\r\nenemy the fight is continued, the hypnotic taking care not to strike\r\nthe person in question. Moll conceded that this looked like simulation,\r\nbut repetition of such experiments forced him to conclude that these\r\nwere real, typical hypnoses, in which, in spite of the sense-delusions,\r\nthere was a dim, dreamy consciousness existing, which influenced the\r\nactions of the subject, and which prevented him from striking at a\r\nhuman being, although hitting at an imaginary object. Many may regard\r\nthis behavior of hypnotics as pure automatism; and Moll adds that, as\r\nwhen walking in the street while reading we automatically avoid\r\nknocking passers-by, so the hypnotic avoids hitting another person,\r\nalthough he is dimly or not at all aware of his existence.\r\n\r\nGibbs reports a curious case of lack of integrity of the will in a man\r\nof fifty-five. When he had once started on a certain labor he seemed to\r\nhave no power to stop the muscular exercise that the task called forth.\r\nIf he went to the barn to throw down a forkful of hay, he would never\r\nstop until the hay was exhausted or someone came to his rescue. If sent\r\nto the wood-pile for a handful of wood, he would continue to bring in\r\nwood until the pile was exhausted or the room was full. On all\r\noccasions his automatic movements could only be stopped by force.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting in Breslau Meschede rendered an account of a man who\r\nsuffered from simple misdirection of movement without any mental\r\nderangement. If from his own desire, or by direction of others, he\r\nwanted to attempt any muscular movement, his muscles performed the\r\nexact opposite to his inclinations. If he desired to look to the right,\r\nhis eyes involuntarily moved to the left. In this case the movement was\r\nnot involuntary, as the muscles were quiet except when called to action\r\nby the will, and then they moved to the opposite.\r\n\r\nPresentiment, or divination of approaching death, appearing to be a\r\nhypothetic allegation, has been established as a strong factor in the\r\nproduction of a fatal issue in many cases in which there was every hope\r\nfor a recovery. In fact several physicians have mentioned with dread\r\nthe peculiar obstinacy of such presentiment.  Hippocrates, Romanus,\r\nMoller, Richter, Jordani, and other older writers speak of it.\r\nMontgomery reports a remarkable case of a woman suffering from\r\ncarcinoma of the uterus. He saw her on October 6, 1847, when she told\r\nhim she had a strong presentiment of death on October 28th. She stated\r\nthat she had been born on that day, her first husband had died on\r\nOctober 28th, and she had married her second husband on that day. On\r\nOctober 27th her pulse began to fail, she fell into a state of extreme\r\nprostration, and at noon on the 28th she died. In substantiation of the\r\npossibility of the influence of presentiment Montgomery cites another\r\ncase in which he was called at an early hour to visit a lady, the\r\nmother of several children. He found her apparently much agitated and\r\ndistressed, and in great nervous excitement over a dream she had had,\r\nin which she saw a handsome monument erected by some children to their\r\nmother. She had awakened and became dreadfully apprehensive, she could\r\nnot tell as to what.  The uneasiness and depression continued, her\r\npulse continued to grow weak, and she died at twelve that night without\r\na struggle.  Andrews has made several observations on this subject, and\r\nconcludes that presentiment of death is a dangerous symptom, and one\r\nwhich should never be overlooked. One of his cases was in a man with a\r\nfractured leg in the Mercy Hospital at Pittsburg. The patient was in\r\ngood health, but one day he became possessed of a cool, quiet, and\r\nperfectly clear impression that he was about to die. Struck with his\r\nconviction, Andrews examined his pulse and general condition minutely,\r\nand assured the patient there was not the slightest ground for\r\napprehension. But he persisted, and was attacked by pneumonia three\r\ndays later which brought him to the verge of the grave, although he\r\nultimately recovered. In another instance a young man of ruddy\r\ncomplexion and apparent good health, after an operation for varicocele,\r\nhad a very clear impression that he would die. Careful examination\r\nshowed no reason for apprehension. After five or six days of\r\nencouragement and assurance, he appeared to be convinced that his\r\nreasoning was foolish, and he gave up the idea of death. About the\r\nninth day the wound presented a healthy, rosy appearance, and as the\r\npatient was cheerful he was allowed to leave his bed. After a few hours\r\nthe nurse heard the noise of labored breathing, and on investigation\r\nfound the patient apparently in a dying condition.  He was given\r\nstimulants and regained consciousness, but again relapsed, and died in\r\na few moments. At the necropsy the heart was found healthy, but there\r\nwere two or three spots of extravasated blood in the brain, and\r\nevidences of cerebral congestion. Vos remarks that he remembers a case\r\nhe had when dressing for Mr. Holden at St. Bartholomew's Hospital: \"A\r\nman who had been intemperate was rolling a sod of grass, and got some\r\ngrit into his left palm. It inflamed; he put on hot cow-dung poultices\r\nby the advice of some country friends. He was admitted with a\r\ndreadfully swollen hand. It was opened, but the phlegmonous process\r\nspread up to the shoulder, and it was opened in many places, and at\r\nlast, under chloroform, the limb was amputated below the joint. The\r\nstump sloughed, and pus pointing at the back of the neck, an opening\r\nwas again made. He became in such a weak state that chloroform could\r\nnot be administered, and one morning he had such a dread of more\r\nincisions that, saying to us all standing round his bed, 'I can bear it\r\nno more, I must now die,' he actually did die in a few minutes in our\r\npresence. His was the last arm that Mr. Holden ever amputated at St.\r\nBartholomew's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHISTORIC EPIDEMICS.\r\n\r\nA short history of the principal epidemics, including as it does the\r\ndescription of anomalous diseases, many of which are now extinct, and\r\nthe valuable knowledge which finally led to their extinction, the\r\nextraordinary mortalities which these epidemics caused, and many other\r\nassociate points of interest would seem fitting to close the\r\nobservations gathered in this volume. As the illustrious Hecker says,\r\nin the history of every epidemic, from the earliest times, the spirit\r\nof inquiry was always aroused to learn the machinery of such stupendous\r\nengines of destruction; and even in the earliest times there was\r\nneither deficiency in courage nor in zeal for investigation. \"When the\r\nglandular plague first made its appearance as a universal epidemic,\r\nwhilst the more pusillanimous, haunted by visionary fears, shut\r\nthemselves up in their closets, some physicians at Constantinople,\r\nastonished at the phenomena opened the boils of the deceased. The like\r\nhas occurred both in ancient and modern times, not without favorable\r\nresults for Science; nay, more mature views excited an eager desire to\r\nbecome acquainted with similar or still greater visitations among the\r\nancients, but, as later ages have always been fond of referring to\r\nGrecian antiquity, the learned of those times, from a partial and\r\nmeagre predilection, were contented with the descriptions of\r\nThucydides, even where nature had revealed, in infinite diversity, the\r\nworkings of her powers.\"\r\n\r\nThere cannot but be a natural interest in every medical mind to-day in\r\nthe few descriptions given of the awful ravages of the epidemics which,\r\nfortunately, in our enlightened sanitary era, have entirely\r\ndisappeared. In the history of such epidemics the name of Hecker stands\r\nout so prominently that any remarks on this subject must necessarily,\r\nin some measure, find their origin in his writings, which include\r\nexhaustive histories of the black death, the dancing mania, and the\r\nsweating sickness. Few historians have considered worthy of more than a\r\npassing note an event of such magnitude as the black death, which\r\ndestroyed millions of the human race in the fourteenth century and was\r\nparticularly dreadful in England. Hume has given but a single paragraph\r\nto it and others have been equally brief. Defoe has given us a journal\r\nof the plague, but it is not written in a true scientific spirit; and\r\nCaius, in 1562, gave us a primitive treatise on the sweating sickness.\r\nIt is due to the translation of Hecker's \"Epidemics of the Middle Ages\"\r\nby Babbington, made possible through the good offices of the Sydenham\r\nSociety, that a major part of the knowledge on this subject of the\r\nEnglish-reading populace has been derived.\r\n\r\nThe Black Death, or, as it has been known, the Oriental plague, the\r\nbubonic plague, or in England, simply the plague, and in Italy, \"la\r\nMortalega\" (the great mortality) derived its name from the Orient; its\r\ninflammatory boils, tumors of the glands, and black spots, indicative\r\nof putrid decomposition, were such as have been seen in no other\r\nfebrile disease. All the symptoms were not found in every case, and in\r\nmany cases one symptom alone preceded death. Although afflicted with\r\nall the manifestations of the plague, some patients recovered.\r\nAccording to Hecker the symptoms of cephalic affliction were seen; many\r\npatients were stupefied and fell into a deep sleep, or became\r\nspeechless from palsy of the tongue, while others remained sleepless\r\nand without rest. The fauces and tongue were black and as if suffused\r\nwith blood; no beverage could assuage the burning thirst, so that\r\nsuffering continued without alleviation until death, which many in\r\ntheir despair accelerated with their own hands. Contagion was evident,\r\nfor attendants caught the disease from their parents and friends, and\r\nmany houses were emptied of their inhabitants. In the fourteenth\r\ncentury this affection caused still deeper sufferings, such as had not\r\nbeen hitherto experienced. The organs of respiration became the seats\r\nof a putrid inflammation, blood was expectorated, and the breath\r\npossessed a pestiferous odor. In the West an ardent fever, accompanied\r\nby an evacuation of blood, proved fatal in the first three days. It\r\nappears that buboes and inflammatory boils did not at first appear, but\r\nthe disease in the form of carbuncular affection of the lungs (anthrax\r\nartigen) caused the fatal issue before the other symptoms developed.\r\nLater on in the history of the plague the inflammatory boils and buboes\r\nin the groins and axillae were recognized at once as prognosticating a\r\nfatal issue.\r\n\r\nThe history of this plague extends almost to prehistoric times.  There\r\nwas a pest in Athens in the fifth century before Christ.  There was\r\nanother in the second century, A.D., under the reign of Marcus\r\nAurelius, and again in the third century, under the reign of the Gauls;\r\nfollowing this was the terrible epidemic of the sixth century, which,\r\nafter having ravaged the territory of the Gauls, extended westward. In\r\n542 a Greek historian, Procopius, born about the year 500, gives a good\r\ndescription of this plague in a work, \"Pestilentia Gravissima,\" so\r\ncalled in the Latin translation. Dupouy in \"Le Moyen Age Medical,\" says\r\nthat it commenced in the village of Peleuse, in Egypt, and followed a\r\ndouble course, one branch going to Alexandria and the other to\r\nPalestine. It reached Constantinople in the Spring of 543, and produced\r\nthe greatest devastation wherever it appeared. In the course of the\r\nsucceeding half century this epidemic became pandemic and spread over\r\nall the inhabited earth. The epidemic lasted four months in\r\nConstantinople, from 5000 to 10,000 people dying each day. In his\r\n\"History of France,\" from 417 to 591, Gregorius speaks of a malady\r\nunder the name inguinale which depopulated the Province of Arles. In\r\nanother passage this illustrious historian of Tours says that the town\r\nof Narbonne was devastated by a maladie des aines. We have records of\r\nepidemics in France from 567 to 590, in which bubonic symptoms were a\r\nprominent feature. About the middle of the fourteenth century the\r\nbubonic plague made another incursion from the East. In 1333, fifteen\r\nyears before the plague appeared in Europe, there were terrible\r\ndroughts in China followed by enormous floods in which thousands of\r\npeople perished. There are traditions of a plague in Tche in 1334,\r\nfollowing a drought, which is said to have carried off about 5,000,000\r\npeople. During the fifteen years before the appearance of the plague in\r\nEurope there were peculiar atmospheric phenomena all over the world,\r\nbesides numerous earthquakes. From the description of the stinking\r\natmosphere of Europe itself at this time it is quite possible that part\r\nof the disease came, not from China, but originated in Southern Europe\r\nitself. From China the route of caravans ran to the north of the\r\nCaspian Sea, through Asia, to Tauris. Here ships were ready to take the\r\nproduce of the East to Constantinople, the capital of commerce, and the\r\nmedium of communication between Europe, Asia, and Africa. Other\r\ncaravans went from Europe to Asia Minor and touched at the cities south\r\nof the Caspian Sea, and lastly there were others from Bagdad through\r\nArabia to Egypt; the maritime communication on the Red Sea to Arabia\r\nand Egypt was also not inconsiderable. In all these directions\r\ncontagion found its way, though doubtless Constantinople and the\r\nharbors of Asia Minor were the chief foci of infection, whence it\r\nradiated to the most distant seaports and islands. As early as 1347 the\r\nMediterranean shores were visited by the plague, and in January, 1348,\r\nit appeared in the south of France, the north of Italy, and also in\r\nSpain. Place after place was attacked throughout the year, and after\r\nravishing the whole of France and Germany, the plague appeared in\r\nEngland, a period of three months elapsing before it reached London.\r\nThe northern kingdoms were attacked in 1349, but in Russia it did not\r\nmake its appearance before 1351.\r\n\r\nAs to the mortality of this fearful epidemic Dupony considers that in\r\nthe space of four years more than 75,000,000 fell victims, that is,\r\nabout half of the population of the countries visited. Hecker estimates\r\nthat from 1347 to 1351, 25,000,000 people died, or one-quarter of the\r\ntotal population of Europe. It was reported to Pope Clement that\r\nthroughout the East, probably with the exception of China, nearly\r\n24,000,000 people had fallen victims to the plague. Thirteen millions\r\nare said to have died in China alone. Constantinople lost two-thirds of\r\nits population.  When the plague was at its greatest violence Cairo\r\nlost daily from 10,000 to 15,000, as many as modern plagues have\r\ncarried off during their whole course. India was depopulated. Tartary,\r\nMesopotamia, Syria, Armenia, and Arabia were covered with dead bodies.\r\nIn this latter country Arabian historians mention that Maara el nooman,\r\nSchisur, and Harem in some unaccountable manner remained free. The\r\nshores of the Mediterranean were ravaged and ships were seen on the\r\nhigh seas without sailors. In \"The Decameron\" Boccaccio gives a most\r\ngraphic description of the plague and states that in Florence, in four\r\nmonths, 100,000 perished; before the calamity it was hardly supposed to\r\ncontain so many inhabitants. According to Hecker, Venice lost 100,000;\r\nLondon, 100,000; Paris, 50,000; Siena, 70,000; Avignon, 60,000;\r\nStrasburg, 16,000; Norwich, 51,100. Dupony says that in one month there\r\nwere 56,000 victims in Marseilles, and at Montpellier three-quarters of\r\nthe population and all the physicians were stricken with the epidemic.\r\n\r\nJohanna of Burgundy, wife of King Philip VI of Valois; Johanna II,\r\nQueen of Navarre, granddaughter of Philippe le Bel; Alphonse XI of\r\nCastile, and other notable persons perished. All the cities of England\r\nsuffered incredible losses. Germany seems to have been particularly\r\nspared; according to a probable calculation, only about 1,250,000\r\ndying. Italy was most severely visited, and was said to have lost most\r\nof its inhabitants. In the north of Europe two of the brothers of\r\nMagnus, King of Sweden, died; and in Westgothland alone 466 priests\r\ndied. The plague showed no decrease in the northern climates of Iceland\r\nand Greenland, and caused great havoc in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of such a great pandemic plague can be readily\r\nsurmised. The mental shock sustained by all nations during the\r\nprevalence of the black plague is beyond parallel and description. An\r\nawful sense of contrition and repentance seized Christians of every\r\ncommunity. They resolved to forsake their vices, and to make\r\nrestitution for past offenses; hence extreme religious fanaticism held\r\nfull sway throughout Europe. The zeal of the penitents stopped at\r\nnothing. The so-called Brotherhood of the Cross, otherwise known as the\r\nOrder of Flagellants, which had arisen in the thirteenth century, but\r\nwas suppressed by the mandates and strenuous efforts of the Church, was\r\nrevived during the plague, and numbers of these advocates of\r\nself-chastisement roamed through the various countries on their great\r\npilgrimages.  Their power increased to such an extent that the Church\r\nwas in considerable danger, for these religious enthusiasts gained more\r\ncredit among the people, and operated more strongly on their minds than\r\nthe priests from whom they so entirely withdrew that they even absolved\r\neach other. Their strength grew with such rapidity, and their numbers\r\nincreased to such an extent daily, that the State and the Church were\r\nforced to combine for their suppression. Degeneracy, however, soon\r\ncrept in, crimes were committed, and they went beyond their strength in\r\nattempting the performance of miracles. One of the most fearful\r\nconsequences of this frenzy was the persecution of the Jews. This alien\r\nrace was given up to the merciless fury and cruelty of the populace.\r\nThe persecution of the Jews commenced in September and October, 1348,\r\nat Chillon on Lake Geneva, where criminal proceedings were instituted\r\nagainst them on the mythic charge of poisoning the public wells. These\r\npersecuted people were summoned before sanguinary tribunals, beheaded\r\nand burned in the most fearful manner. At Strasburg 2000 Jews were\r\nburned alive in their own burial-ground, where a large scaffold had\r\nbeen erected, their wealth being divided among the people. In Mayence\r\n12,000 Jews were said to have been put to a cruel death. At Eslingen\r\nthe whole Jewish community burned themselves in their synagogue, and\r\nmothers were often seen throwing their children on the pile, to prevent\r\nthem from being baptized, and then precipitating themselves into the\r\nflames. The cruel and avaricious desires of the monarchs against these\r\nthrifty and industrious people added fuel to the flames of the popular\r\npassion, and even a fanatic zeal arose among the Jews to perish as\r\nmartyrs to their ancient religion. When we sum up the actual effects as\r\nwell as the after effects of the black death, we are appalled at the\r\nmagnitude of such a calamity, the like of which the world had never\r\nseen before.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the plague was generally\r\ndiffused throughout Europe, and in the latter half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury a final Occidental incursion of the plague took place. From\r\n1603 to 1604 over 30,000 people perished in London from the plague, and\r\nin 1625 the mortality in that city amounted to 35,417 persons. But the\r\ngreat plague of London did not begin until 1664. In this plague the\r\npatient at first became sensible of great weariness and fatigue, had\r\nslight chills, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and pains in the loins. The\r\nmental disturbance rapidly increased, and stupor and delirium ensued.\r\nThe face was alternately flushed and pallid, and a sense of\r\nconstriction was experienced in the region of the heart. Darting pains\r\nwere felt all over the body, soon followed by the enlargement of the\r\nlymphatic glands, or by the formation of carbuncles in various parts of\r\nthe body. About the third day the tongue became dry and brown, and the\r\ngums, tongue, and teeth were covered with a dark fur, and the\r\nexcretions became offensive; paralysis intervened; ecchymosed patches\r\nor stripes due to extravasation appeared on the skin; finally the pulse\r\nsank, the body grew cold and clammy, delirium or coma seized the\r\nvictim, and in five or six days, sometimes in two or three, the painful\r\nstruggle was at an end.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that the disease originated in the Orient and was\r\nbrought to London from Holland. In his \"Journal of the Plague in\r\nLondon\" Defoe describes its horrors, and tells of the dead-cart which\r\nwent through the streets gathering the victims. A few extracts from\r\nPepys's \"Diary,\" the evidence of an eye-witness and a contemporary,\r\nshow the ghastly aspects of this terrible visitation. On August 31st he\r\nwrites: \"In the City, this week, died 7496, and of them 6102 died of\r\nthe plague. But it is found that the true number of the dead this week\r\nis nearer 10,000; partly from the poor who cannot be taken care of\r\nthrough the greatness of the number, and partly from the Quakers and\r\nothers that will not have any bell rung for them.\" According to Adams,\r\nJohn Evelyn noted in his \"Kalendarium\":--\"Sept. 7th.--Near 10,000 now\r\ndied weekly; however, I went all along the City and suburbs from Kent\r\nstreet to St. James's, a dismal passage, and dangerous to see so many\r\ncoffins exposed in the streets; the streets thin of people, the shops\r\nshut up, and all in silence, no one knowing whose turn might be next.\"\r\n\r\nAs the cold weather came on the plague diminished in intensity and the\r\npeople regained their confidence and returned to the city. According to\r\nAdams, in the first week of March, 1666, deaths by the plague had\r\ndecreased to 42; and by the end of the month it was nearly extinct\r\nafter carrying off about 100,000 victims. In our days we can hardly\r\ncomprehend the filthy hygienic conditions under which the people in the\r\ncities lived, and it was probably to this fact that the growth and\r\nperpetuation of this plague was due.\r\n\r\nAs to the bubonic plague recently raging in Camptown, China, Mary Niles\r\nsays that it was the same disease as the great London plague, and was\r\ncharacterized mainly by glandular enlargement. It had not appeared in\r\nthe Canton district for forty years or more, though it was endemic in\r\nYunnan. In some places it began in the winter; and as early as January\r\nshe herself found the first case in Canton in an infected house. In no\r\ncase was direct contagiousness found to exist. The glands enlarged\r\ntwelve hours after the fever began, and sometimes suppurated in\r\nnonfatal cases in a short time. Kitasato has recently announced the\r\ndiscovery of the specific cause of the bubonic plague.\r\n\r\nSweating Sickness.--According to Hecker, very shortly after Henry's\r\ntriumphant march from Bosworth Field, and his entry into the capital on\r\nAugust 8, 1485, the sweating sickness began its ravages among the\r\npeople of the densely populated city. According to Lord Bacon the\r\ndisease began about September 21st, and lasted to the end of October,\r\n1485. The physicians could do little or nothing for the people, and\r\nseemed to take no account of the clinical history of the disease,--in\r\nthis respect not unlike the Greek physicians who for four hundred years\r\npaid no attention to small-pox because they could find no description\r\nof it in the immortal works of Galen. The causes seemed to be\r\nuncleanliness, gluttony, immoderate drinking, and also severe\r\ninundations leaving decaying vegetation. Richmond's army has been\r\nconsidered a factor in the germination of the seeds of pestilent\r\ndisorder which broke out soon after in the camps of Litchfield, and on\r\nthe banks of the Severn.\r\n\r\nSweating sickness was an inflammatory rheumatic fever, with great\r\ndisorder of the nervous system, and was characterized by a profuse and\r\ninjurious perspiration. In the English epidemic the brain, meninges,\r\nand the nerves were affected in a peculiar manner. The functions of the\r\npneumogastric nerves were violently disordered in this disease, as was\r\nshown by the oppressed respiration and extreme anxiety, with nausea and\r\nvomiting,--symptoms to which modern physicians attach much importance.\r\nThe stupor and profound lethargy show that there was an injury to the\r\nbrain, to which, in all probability, was added a stagnation of black\r\nblood in the torpid veins. Probably decomposing blood gave rise to the\r\noffensive odor of the person.  The function of the lungs was\r\nconsiderably impaired. The petechial fever in Italy in 1505 was a form\r\nof the sweating sickness. There were visitations in 1506 and in 1515 in\r\nEngland.  In 1517 the disease lasted full six months and reached its\r\ngreatest height about six weeks after its appearance, but was\r\napparently limited to England. Meningeal symptoms were characteristic\r\nof the third visitation of the disease. In 1528 and 1529 there was a\r\nfourth visitation which resulted in the destruction of the French Army\r\nbefore Naples. It is said that in 1524 a petechial fever carried off\r\n50,000 people in Milan, and possibly this was the same disease. In 1529\r\nthe disease had spread all over Europe, attended with great mortality.\r\n\r\nGermany, France, and Italy were visited equally. The famine in Germany,\r\nat this time, is described by authorities in a tone of deep sympathy.\r\nSwabia, Lorraine, Alsace, and provinces on the border of the lower\r\nRhine, were frightfully affected, so that the disease reached the same\r\nheights there as in France. In England Henry VIII endeavored to avoid\r\nthe epidemic by continual traveling, until at last he grew tired of so\r\nunsettled a life and determined to await his destiny at Tytynhangar. It\r\nwas not the inhabitants of the land alone who were affected, but even\r\nfish and the fowls of the air sickened. According to Schiller, in the\r\nneighborhood of Freiburg in Breisgau, dead birds were found scattered\r\nunder the trees with boils as large as peas under their\r\nwings,--indicating among them a disease, and this extended far beyond\r\nthe southern districts of the Rhine. The disease was undoubtedly of a\r\nmiasmatic infectious nature, as was proved by its rapid spread and the\r\noccasional absence of a history of contagion. It was particularly\r\nfavored in its development by high temperature and humidity.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of the sweating sickness, similar to that of the black\r\nplague, was again to increase religious fanaticism and recreate the\r\nzeal of persecution.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of April, 1551, there was an outbreak of the fifth and last\r\nepidemic of sweating fever in Shrewsbury, on the Severn.  With stinking\r\nmists it gradually spread all over England, and on the 9th of July it\r\nreached London. The mortality was very considerable. The English\r\nresidents were particularly susceptible, foreigners being comparatively\r\nexempt. The epidemic terminated about the 30th of September. Since that\r\ntime the sweating sickness has never reappeared in England; but in the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century a disease very similar in symptoms\r\nand course broke out in Picardy, in Northern France.  Toward the end of\r\nthe century it spread to the South of France, and since that time has\r\nappeared epidemically, 195 distinct outbreaks having been observed in\r\nthe course of one hundred and sixty-nine years, from 1618 to 1787. The\r\ndisease has frequently appeared in Italy since 1755, and in various\r\nparts of Germany since 1801. In Belgium it has been observed in a few\r\nplaces within the present century (Rohe).\r\n\r\nChronologic Table of the Principal Plagues.--In December, 1880, H. P.\r\nPotter, F.R.C.S., published a chronologic table of some of the\r\nprincipal plagues on record. In comments on his table, Potter says that\r\nhe has doubtless included mention of many plagues which, although\r\ndescribed under that name, are probably a dissimilar disease, writers\r\nhaving applied the terms pestilential and pestilent in a generic sense\r\nto diseases specifically different. It must also be remembered that, in\r\nsome cases, death must have been due to famine, want, and privation,\r\nwhich are so frequently coexistent with pestilence. Following the idea\r\nof Hecker, the dancing manias have been included in this table.\r\n\r\n{table omitted}\r\n\r\nSmall-pox.--From certain Chinese records it appears that small-pox, or\r\na disease with similar symptoms, was known in China before the\r\nChristian era, and it was supposed to have been known at a very early\r\nperiod in India. Most likely it was introduced into Europe in the\r\nsecond century by a Roman army returning from Asia. Before the sixth\r\ncentury, the terrible century of the great plague, there seem to be no\r\nrecords of small-pox or other eruptive fevers. Neither Hippocrates,\r\nGalen, nor the Greek physicians who practiced at Rome, mention\r\nsmall-pox, although it is now believed that the Emperor Marcus Aurelius\r\ndied of this disease. According to Dupony, the first document\r\nmentioning variola was in 570 A.D., by Marius, a scholar of Avenches,\r\nin Switzerland. (\"Anno 570, morbus validus cum profluvio ventris, et\r\nvariola, Italiam Galliamque valde affecit.\") Ten years later Gregory of\r\nTours describes an epidemic with all the symptoms of small-pox in the\r\nfifth reign of King Childebert (580); it started in the region of\r\nAuvergne, which was inundated by a great flood; he also describes a\r\nsimilar epidemic in Touraine in 582. Rhazes, or as the Arabs call him,\r\nAbu Beer Mohammed Ibn Zacariya Ar-Razi, in the latter part of the ninth\r\ncentury wrote a most celebrated work on small-pox and measles, which is\r\nthe earliest accurate description of these diseases, although Rhazes\r\nhimself mentions several writers who had previously described them, and\r\nwho had formulated rules for their cure. He explained these diseases by\r\nthe theory of fermentation, and recommended the cooling treatment.\r\nAdams remarks that although it is probable that small-pox existed for\r\nages in Hindoostan and China, being completely isolated in those\r\ncountries from the European world, it was not introduced into the West\r\nuntil the close of the seventh century. Imported into Egypt by the\r\nArabians, it followed in the tracks of their conquests, and was in this\r\nway propagated over Europe. The foregoing statement disagrees with\r\nDupony and others. It is well known that small-pox was prevalent in\r\nEurope before Rhazes's description of it, and after the Crusades it\r\nspread over Central and Western Europe, but did not extend to the\r\nnorthern countries until some years later. In 1507 the Spaniards\r\nintroduced it into San Domingo, and in 1510 into Mexico, where it\r\nproved a more fatal scourge than the swords of Cortez and his\r\nfollowers, for according to Robertson it swept away in Mexico three\r\nmillions and a half of people. In 1707 it appeared in Iceland, and\r\ncarried off more than one-fourth of its inhabitants; in 1733, according\r\nto Collinson, it almost depopulated Greenland.  The Samoyeds, Ostiaks,\r\nand other natives of Eastern Siberia, have frequently suffered from\r\ndevastating epidemics. In Kamchatka the disease was introduced in 1767,\r\nand many villages were completely depopulated. According to Moore, at\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century nearly one-fourteenth of the\r\npopulation died from small-pox in England, and at the end of the\r\ncentury the number of the victims had increased to one-tenth. In the\r\nlast century the statement was made in England that one person in every\r\nthree was badly pock-marked. The mortality of the disease at the latter\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century was about three to every thousand\r\ninhabitants annually. India has always been a fertile ground for the\r\ndevelopment of small-pox, and according to Rohe the mortality from\r\nsmall-pox has been exceedingly great for the past twenty years. From\r\n1866 to 1869, 140,000 persons died in the Presidencies of Bombay and\r\nCalcutta, and several years later, from 1873 to 1876, 700,000 died from\r\nthis disease. China, Japan, and the neighboring countries are\r\nfrequently visited with small-pox, and nearly all the inhabitants of\r\nCorea are said to bear evidences of the disease. In the Marquesas\r\nIslands one-fourth of the inhabitants had fallen victims to the disease\r\nsince 1863. It was first introduced into the Sandwich Islands in 1853,\r\nand it then carried off eight per cent of the natives.  Australia,\r\nTasmania, New Zealand, and the Fiji Archipelago have to the present day\r\nremained exempt from small-pox; although it has been carried to\r\nAustralia in vessels, rigorous quarantine methods have promptly checked\r\nit. On the American continent it was believed that small-pox was\r\nunknown until the conquest of Mexico. It has been spread through\r\nvarious channels to nearly all the Indian tribes of both North and\r\nSouth America, and among these primitive people, unprotected by\r\ninoculation or vaccination, its ravages have been frightful.\r\n\r\nThat small-pox a disease so general and so fatal at one time--has,\r\nthrough the ingenuity of man, in civilized communities at least, become\r\nalmost extinct, is one of the greatest triumphs of medicine.\r\n\r\nInoculation was known in Europe about 1700, and in 1717 the famous\r\nletter of Lady Montagu from Adrianople was issued, containing in part\r\nthe following statements:--\r\n\r\n\"The small-pox, so fatal and so general amongst us, is here entirely\r\nharmless, by the invention of ingrafting, which is the term they give\r\nit. There is a set of old women who make it their business to perform\r\nthe operation every autumn in the month of September, when the great\r\nheat is abated. People send to one another to know if any of their\r\nfamily has a mind to have the small-pox; they make parties for this\r\npurpose, and when they are met, the old woman comes with a nut-shell\r\nfull of the matter of the best sort of small-pox, and asks what vein\r\nyou please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you offer her\r\nwith a large needle, and puts into the vein as much matter as can lie\r\nupon the head of her needle, and after that binds up the little wound\r\nwith a hollow shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this letter Lady Montagu had her son inoculated in Turkey,\r\nand four years later her daughter was to be the first subject\r\ninoculated in England. She made rapid progress notwithstanding the\r\nopposition of the medical profession, and the ignorance and credulity\r\nof the public. The clergy vituperated her for the impiety of seeking to\r\ncontrol the designs of Providence.  Preaching in 1722, the Rev. Edward\r\nMassey, for example, affirmed that Job's distemper was confluent\r\nsmall-pox, and that he had been inoculated by the Devil. Lady Montagu,\r\nhowever, gained many supporters among the higher classes. In 1721 Mead\r\nwas requested by the Prince of Wales to superintend the inoculation of\r\nsome condemned criminals, the Prince intending afterward to continue\r\nthe practice in his own family; the experiment was entirely successful,\r\nand the individuals on whom it was made afterward received their\r\nliberty (Adams).\r\n\r\nAccording to Rohe, inoculation was introduced into this country in 1721\r\nby Dr. Zabdiel Boylston of Boston, who had his attention directed to\r\nthe practice by Cotton Mather, the eminent divine.  During 1721 and\r\n1722 286 persons were inoculated by Boylston and others in\r\nMassachusetts, and six died. These fatal results rendered the practice\r\nunpopular, and at one time the inoculation hospital in Boston was\r\nclosed by order of the Legislature. Toward the end of the century an\r\ninoculating hospital was again opened in that city.\r\n\r\nEarly in the eighteenth century inoculation was extensively practiced\r\nby Dr. Adam Thomson of Maryland, who was instrumental in spreading a\r\nknowledge of the practice throughout the Middle States.\r\n\r\nDespite inoculation, as we have already seen, during the eighteenth\r\ncentury the mortality from small-pox increased. The disadvantage of\r\ninoculation was that the person inoculated was affected with a mild\r\nform of small-pox, which however, was contagious, and led to a virulent\r\nform in uninoculated persons.  As universal inoculation was manifestly\r\nimpracticable, any half-way measure was decidedly disadvantageous, and\r\nit was not until vaccination from cow-pox was instituted that the first\r\ndecided check on the ravages of small-pox was made.\r\n\r\nVaccination was almost solely due to the persistent efforts of Dr.\r\nEdward Jenner, a pupil of the celebrated John Hunter, born May 17, 1749.\r\n\r\nIn his comments on the life of Edward Jenner, Adams, in \"The Healing\r\nArt,\" has graphically described his first efforts to institute\r\nvaccination, as follows: \"To the ravages of small-pox, and the\r\npossibility of finding some preventive Jenner had long given his\r\nattention. It is likely enough that his thoughts were inclined in this\r\ndirection by the remembrance of the sufferings inflicted upon himself\r\nby the process of inoculation. Through six weeks that process lingered.\r\nHe was bled, purged, and put on a low diet, until 'this barbarism of\r\nhuman veterinary practice' had reduced him to a skeleton. He was then\r\nexposed to the contagion of the small-pox. Happily, he had but a mild\r\nattack; yet the disease itself and the inoculating operations, were\r\nprobably the causes of the excessive sensitiveness which afflicted him\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\n\"When Jenner was acting as a surgeon's articled pupil at Sudbury, a\r\nyoung countrywoman applied to him for advice. In her presence some\r\nchance allusion was made to the universal disease, on which she\r\nremarked: 'I shall never take it, for I have had the cow-pox.' The\r\nremark induced him to make inquiries; and he found that a pustular\r\neruption, derived from infection, appeared on the hands of milkers,\r\ncommunicated from the teats of cows similarly disordered; this eruption\r\nwas regarded as a safeguard against small-pox. The subject occupied his\r\nmind so much that he frequently mentioned it to John Hunter and the\r\ngreat surgeon occasionally alluded to it in his lectures, but never\r\nseems to have adopted Jenner's idea that it might suggest some\r\nefficacious substitute for inoculation. Jenner, however, continued his\r\ninquiries, and in 1780 he confided to his friend, Edward Gardner, his\r\nhope and prayer that it might be his work in life to extirpate smallpox\r\nby the mode of treatment now so familiar under the name of vaccination.\r\n\r\n\"At the meetings of the Alveston and Radborough Medical Clubs, of both\r\nof which Jenner was a member, he so frequently enlarged upon his\r\nfavorite theme, and so repeatedly insisted upon the value of cow-pox as\r\na prophylactic, that he was denounced as a nuisance, and in a jest it\r\nwas even proposed that if the orator further sinned, he should then and\r\nthere be expelled. Nowhere could the prophet find a disciple and\r\nenforce the lesson upon the ignorant; like most benefactors of mankind\r\nhe had to do his work unaided.  Patiently and perseveringly he pushed\r\nforward his investigations.  The aim he had in view was too great for\r\nridicule to daunt, or indifference to discourage him. When he surveyed\r\nthe mental and physical agony inflicted by the disease, and the thought\r\noccurred to him that he was on the point of finding a sure and certain\r\nremedy, his benevolent heart overflowed with unselfish gladness.  No\r\nfeeling of personal ambition, no hope or desire of fame, sullied the\r\npurity of his noble philanthropy. 'While the vaccine discovery was\r\nprogressive,' he writes, 'the joy at the prospect before me of being\r\nthe instrument destined to take away from the world one of its greatest\r\ncalamities, blended with the fond hope of enjoying independence, and\r\ndomestic peace and happiness, were often so excessive, that, in\r\npursuing my favorite subject among the meadows, I have sometimes found\r\nmyself in a kind of reverie.  It is pleasant to recollect that those\r\nreflections always ended in devout acknowledgments to that Being from\r\nwhom this and all other blessings flow.' At last an opportunity\r\noccurred of putting his theory to the test. On the 14th day of May,\r\n1796,--the day marks an epoch in the Healing Art, and is not less\r\nworthy of being kept as a national thanksgiving than the day of\r\nWaterloo--the cow-pox matter or pus was taken from the hand of one\r\nSarah Holmes, who had been infected from her master's cows, and was\r\ninserted by two superficial incisions into the arms of James Phipps, a\r\nhealthy boy of about eight years of age. The cow-pox ran its ordinary\r\ncourse without any injurious effect, and the boy was afterward\r\ninoculated for the small-pox,--happily in vain. The protection was\r\ncomplete; and Jenner thenceforward pursued his experiments with\r\nredoubled ardor. His first summary of them, after having been examined\r\nand approved by several friends, appeared under the title of 'An\r\nInquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae,' in June,\r\n1798. In this important work he announced the security against the\r\nsmall-pox afforded by the true cow-pox, and proceeded to trace the\r\norigin of that disease in the cow to a similar affection of the horse's\r\nheel.\"\r\n\r\nThis publication produced a great sensation in the medical world, and\r\nvaccination spread so rapidly that in the following summer Jenner had\r\nthe indorsement of the majority of the leading surgeons of London.\r\nVaccination was soon introduced into France, where Napoleon gave\r\nanother proof of his far-reaching sagacity by his immediate recognition\r\nof the importance of vaccination. It was then spread all over the\r\ncontinent; and in 1800 Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse of Boston introduced it\r\ninto America; in 1801, with his sons-in-law, President Jefferson\r\nvaccinated in their own families and those of their friends nearly 200\r\npersons. Quinan has shown that vaccination was introduced into Maryland\r\nat least simultaneously with its introduction into Massachusetts. De\r\nCurco introduced vaccination into Vienna, where its beneficial results\r\nwere displayed on a striking scale; previously the average annual\r\nmortality had been about 835; the number now fell to 164 in 1801, 61 in\r\n1802, and 27 in 1803. After the introduction of vaccination in England\r\nthe mortality was reduced from nearly 3000 per million inhabitants\r\nannually to 310 per million annually. During the small-pox epidemic in\r\nLondon in 1863, Seaton and Buchanan examined over 50,000 school\r\nchildren, and among every thousand without evidences of vaccination\r\nthey found 360 with the scars of small-pox, while of every thousand\r\npresenting some evidence of vaccination, only 1.78 had any such traces\r\nof small-pox to exhibit. Where vaccination has been rendered\r\ncompulsory, the results are surprising. In 1874 a law was established\r\nin Prussia that every child that had not already had small-pox must be\r\nvaccinated in the first year of its life, and every pupil in a private\r\nor public institution must be revaccinated during the year in which his\r\nor her twelfth birthday occurs. This law virtually stamped small-pox\r\nout of existence; and according to Frolich not a single death from\r\nsmall-pox occurred in the German army between 1874 and 1882.\r\nNotwithstanding the arguments advanced in this latter day against\r\nvaccination, the remembrance of a few important statistic facts is all\r\nthat is necessary to fully appreciate the blessing which Jenner\r\nconferred upon humanity. In the last century, besides the enormous\r\nmortality of small-pox (it was computed that, in the middle of the last\r\ncentury, 2,000,000 victims perished in Russia from small-pox), the\r\nmarks of affliction, blindness, deafness, etc., were plain in at least\r\none member of every family.\r\n\r\nAsiatic cholera probably originated centuries ago in India, where it is\r\nnow endemic and rages to such an extent as to destroy 750,000\r\ninhabitants in the space of five years. There is questionable evidence\r\nof the existence of cholera to be found in the writings of some of the\r\nclassic Grecian and Indian authors, almost as far back as the beginning\r\nof the Christian era. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\ntravelers in the East gave accounts of this disease. Sonnerat, a French\r\ntraveler, describes a pestilence having all the characteristics of\r\nAsiatic cholera which prevailed in the neighborhood of Pondicherry and\r\nthe Coromandel coast from 1768 to 1769, and which, within a year,\r\ncarried off 60,000 of those attacked. According to Rohe, Jasper Correa,\r\nan officer in Vasco da Gama's expedition to Calicut, states that\r\nZamorin, the chief of Calicut, lost 20,000 troops by the disease.\r\nAlthough cholera has frequently extended to Europe and America, its\r\nravages have never been nearly as extensive as in the Oriental\r\noutbreaks. An excellent short historic sketch of the epidemics of the\r\ncholera observed beyond the borders of India has been given by Rohe. In\r\n1817 cholera crossed the boundaries of India, advancing southeasterly\r\nto Ceylon, and westerly to Mauritius, reaching the African coast in\r\n1820. In the following two years it devastated the Chinese Empire and\r\ninvaded Japan, appearing at the port of Nagasaki in 1822. It advanced\r\ninto Asiatic Russia, and appeared as far east as St. Petersburg in\r\n1830, from whence it spread north to Finland. In 1831 it passed through\r\nGermany, invading France and the western borders of Europe, entering\r\nthe British Isles in 1832, and crossing the Atlantic Ocean for the\r\nfirst time, appeared in Canada, having been carried thence by some\r\nIrish emigrants.\r\n\r\nFrom Canada it directly made its way to the United States by way of\r\nDetroit. In the same year (1832) it appeared in New York and rapidly\r\nspread along the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n\"During the winter of 1832 it appeared at New Orleans, and passed\r\nthence up the Mississippi Valley. Extending into the Indian country,\r\ncausing sad havoc among the aborigines, it advanced westward until its\r\nfurther progress was stayed by the shores of the Pacific Ocean. In 1834\r\nit reappeared on the east coast of the United States, but did not gain\r\nmuch headway, and in the following year New Orleans was again invaded\r\nby way of Cuba. It was again imported into Mexico in 1833. In 1835 it\r\nappeared for the first time in South America, being restricted,\r\nhowever, to a mild epidemic on the Guiana coast.\r\n\r\n\"In 1846 the disease again advanced beyond its natural confines,\r\nreaching Europe by way of Turkey, in 1848. In the autumn of this year\r\nit also appeared in Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden,\r\nand the United States, entering by way of New York and New Orleans. In\r\nthe succeeding two years the entire extent of country east of the Rocky\r\nMountains was invaded. During 1851 and 1852 the disease was frequently\r\nimported by emigrants, who were annually arriving in great numbers from\r\nthe various infected countries of Europe. In 1853 and 1854 cholera\r\nagain prevailed extensively in this country, being, however, traceable\r\nto renewed importation of infected material from abroad. In the\r\nfollowing two years it also broke out in numerous South American\r\nStates, where it prevailed at intervals until 1863. Hardly had this\r\nthird great pandemic come to an end before the disease again advanced\r\nfrom the Ganges, spreading throughout India, and extending to China,\r\nJapan, and the East Indian Archipelago, during the years 1863 to 1865.\r\nIn the latter year it reached Europe by way of Malta and Marseilles. It\r\nrapidly spread over the Continent, and in 1866 was imported into this\r\ncountry by way of Halifax, New York, and New Orleans. This epidemic\r\nprevailed extensively in the Western States, but produced only slight\r\nravages on the Atlantic Coast, being kept in check by appropriate\r\nsanitary measures. In the same year (1866) the disease was also carried\r\nto South America, and invaded for the first time the states bordering\r\non the Rio de la Plata and the Pacific coast of the Continent.\r\n\r\n\"Cholera never entirely disappeared in Russia during the latter half of\r\nthe sixth decade, and in 1870 it again broke out with violence,\r\ncarrying off a quarter of a million of the inhabitants before dying out\r\nin 1873. It spread from Russia into Germany and France and was\r\nimported, in 1873, into this country, entering by way of New Orleans\r\nand extending up the Mississippi Valley. None of the Atlantic coast\r\ncities suffered from this epidemic in 1873, and since that year the\r\nUnited States has been entirely free from the disease, with the\r\nexception of a few imported cases in New York harbor in 1887\" (and in\r\n1893). In 1883 an epidemic of cholera raged in Egypt and spread to many\r\nof the Mediterranean ports, and reappeared in 1885 with renewed\r\nviolence. In Spain alone during this latter epidemic the total number\r\nof cases was over one-third of a million, with nearly 120,000 deaths.\r\nIn 1886 cholera caused at least 100,000 deaths in Japan. In the latter\r\npart of 1886 cholera was carried from Genoa to Buenos Ayres, and\r\ncrossing the Andean range invaded the Pacific coast for a second time.\r\nIn Chili alone there were over 10,000 deaths from cholera in the first\r\nsix months of 1887. Since then the entire Western hemisphere has been\r\nvirtually free from the disease.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 there was an epidemic of cholera in the Orient; and in 1892 and\r\n1893 it broke out along the shores of the Mediterranean, invading all\r\nthe lines of commerce of Europe, Hamburg in the North and Marseilles in\r\nthe South being especially affected. In the summer of 1893 a few cases\r\nappeared in New York Bay and several in New York city, but rigorous\r\nquarantine methods prevented any further spread.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever is now a rare disease, and epidemics are quite infrequent.\r\nIt has long been known under the names of hospital-fever,\r\nspotted-fever, jail-fever, camp-fever, and ship-fever, and has been the\r\nregular associate of such social disturbances as overcrowding,\r\nexcesses, famine, and war. For the past eight centuries epidemics of\r\ntyphus have from time to time been noticed, but invariably can be\r\ntraced to some social derangement.\r\n\r\nYellow Fever is a disease prevailing endemically in the West Indies and\r\ncertain sections of what was formerly known as the Spanish Main.\r\nGuiteras recognizes three areas of infection:--\r\n\r\n(1) The focal zone from which the disease is never absent, including\r\nHavana, Vera Cruz, Rio, and the other various Spanish-American points.\r\n\r\n(2) The perifocal zone, or regions of periodic epidemics, including the\r\nports of the tropical Atlantic and Africa.\r\n\r\n(3) The zone of accidental epidemics, between the parallels of 45\r\ndegrees north and 35 degrees south latitude.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century Guadaloupe, Dominica, Martinique, and\r\nBarbadoes suffered from epidemics of yellow fever. After the first half\r\nof the seventeenth century the disease was prevalent all through the\r\nWest Indies. It first appeared in the United States at the principal\r\nports of Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston, in 1693, and in 1699 it\r\nreappeared in Philadelphia and Charleston, and since that time many\r\ninvasions have occurred, chiefly in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of 1793 in Philadelphia, so graphically described by\r\nMatthew Carey, was, according to Osler, the most serious that has ever\r\nprevailed in any city of the Middle States. Although the population of\r\nthe city was only 40,000, during the months of August, September,\r\nOctober, and November the mortality, as given by Carey, was 4041, of\r\nwhom 3435 died in the months of September and October. During the\r\nfollowing ten years epidemics of a lesser degree occurred along the\r\ncoast of the United States, and in 1853 the disease raged throughout\r\nthe Southern States, there being a mortality in New Orleans alone of\r\nnearly 8000. In the epidemic of 1878 in the Southern States the\r\nmortality was nearly 16,000.  South America was invaded for the first\r\ntime in 1740, and since 1849 the disease has been endemic in Brazil.\r\nPeru and the Argentine Republic have also received severe visitations\r\nof yellow fever since 1854. In Cuba the disease is epidemic during\r\nJune, July, and August, and it appears with such certainty that the\r\nRevolutionists at the present time count more on the agency of yellow\r\nfever in the destruction of the unacclimated Spanish soldiers than on\r\ntheir own efforts.\r\n\r\nLeprosy is distinctly a malady of Oriental origin, and existed in\r\nprehistoric times in Egypt and Judea. It was supposed to have been\r\nbrought into Europe by a Roman army commanded by Pompey, after an\r\nexpedition into Palestine. Leprosy was mentioned by several authors in\r\nthe Christian era. France was invaded about the second century, and\r\nfrom that time on to the Crusades the disease gradually increased. At\r\nthis epoch, the number of lepers or ladres becoming so large, they were\r\nobliged to confine themselves to certain portions of the country, and\r\nthey took for their patron St. Lazare, and small hospitals were built\r\nand dedicated to this saint. Under Louis VIII 2000 of these hospitals\r\nwere counted, and later, according to Dupony, there were 19,000 in the\r\nFrench kingdom. Various laws and regulations were made to prevent the\r\nspread of the contagion. In 1540 it was said that there were as many as\r\n660 lepers in one hospital in Paris.\r\n\r\nNo mention is made in the Hippocratic writings of elephantiasis\r\ngraecorum, which was really a type of leprosy, and is now considered\r\nsynonymous with it. According to Rayer, some writers insist that the\r\naffection then existed under the name of the Phoenician disease. Before\r\nthe time of Celsus, the poet Lucretius first speaks of elephantiasis\r\ngraecorum, and assigns Egypt as the country where it occurs. Celsus\r\ngives the principal characteristics, and adds that the disease is\r\nscarcely known in Italy, but is very common in certain other countries.\r\nGalen supplies us with several particular but imperfect\r\ncases--histories of elephantiasis graecorum, with a view to demonstrate\r\nthe value of the flesh of the viper, and in another review he adds that\r\nthe disease is common in Alexandria. Aretaeus has left a very accurate\r\npicture of the symptoms of elephantiasis graecorum; and Pliny\r\nrecapitulates the principal features and tells us that the disease is\r\nindigenous in Egypt. The opinion of the contagiousness of elephantiasis\r\ngraecorum which we find announced in Herodotus and Galen is more\r\nstrongly insisted upon by Caelius Aurelianus who recommends isolation\r\nof those affected.  Paulus aegenita discusses the disease. The Arabian\r\nwriters have described elephantiasis graecorum under the name of juzam,\r\nwhich their translators have rendered by the word lepra. Later,\r\nHensler, Fernel Pare, Vesalius, Horstius, Forestus, and others have\r\ndiscussed it.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of leprosy in Europe pale before the numbers affected in\r\nthe East. The extent of its former ravages is unknown, but it is\r\nestimated that at the present day there are over 250,000 lepers in\r\nIndia, and the number in China is possibly beyond computation.\r\nAccording to Morrow, in 1889 in the Sandwich Islands there were 1100\r\nlepers in the settlement at Molokai.  Berger states that there were 100\r\ncases at Key West; and Blanc found 40 cases at New Orleans. Cases of\r\nleprosy are not infrequently found among the Chinese on the Pacific\r\ncoast, and an occasional case is seen in the large cities of this\r\ncountry. At the present day in Europe, where leprosy was once so well\r\nknown, it is never found except in Norway and the far East.\r\n\r\nPossibly few diseases have caused so much misery and suffering as\r\nleprosy. The banishment from all friends and relatives, the\r\nconfiscation of property and seclusion from the world, coupled with\r\npoverty and brutality of treatment,--all emphasize its physical horror\r\na thousandfold. As to the leper himself, no more graphic description\r\ncan be given than that printed in The Ninteenth Century, August, 1884:\r\n\"But leprosy! Were I to describe it no one would follow me. More cruel\r\nthan the clumsy torturing weapons of old, it distorts, and scars, and\r\nhacks, and maims, and destroys its victim inch by inch, feature by\r\nfeature, member by member, joint by joint, sense by sense, leaving him\r\nto cumber the earth and tell the horrid tale of a living death, till\r\nthere is nothing left of him. Eyes, voice, nose, toes, fingers, feet,\r\nhands, one after the other are slowly deformed and rot away, until at\r\nthe end of ten, fifteen, twenty years, it may be, the wretched leper,\r\nafflicted in every sense himself, and hateful to the sight, smell,\r\nhearing, and touch of others, dies, despised and the most abject of\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nSyphilis.--Heretofore the best evidence has seemed to prove that\r\nsyphilis had its origin in 1494, during the siege of Naples by Charles\r\nVIII of France; but in later days many investigators, prominent among\r\nthem Buret, have stated that there is distinct evidence of the\r\nexistence of syphilis in prehistoric times. Buret finds evidence of\r\ntraces of syphilis among the Chinese five thousand years ago, among the\r\nEgyptians at the time of the Pharaohs, among the Hebrews and Hindoos in\r\nbiblic times, and among the Greeks and Romans after Christ. Some\r\nAmerican writers claim to have found evidences of syphilitic disease in\r\nthe skulls and other bones of the prehistoric Indian mounds, thus\r\ngiving further evidence to the advocates of the American origin of\r\nsyphilis. The Spaniards claimed that, returning from America in 1493,\r\nColumbus brought with him syphilis. Friend says: \"One thing is\r\nremarkable; the Spaniards, upon their first expedition to America,\r\nbrought home from thence this contagious disorder, and soon after\r\ncarried another affection thither, the small-pox, of which the Indian\r\nPrince Montezuma died.\" The first descriptions of syphilis are given\r\nunder the name of morbus gallicus, while the French in return called it\r\nmorbus neapolitanus or mal d'Italie. The name of syphilis was said to\r\nhave been first given to it by a physician of Verona, in a poem\r\ndescribing the disease.  Inspired by heroic epics Fracastor places\r\nbefore us the divinities of paganism, and supposes that a shepherd,\r\nwhom he called Syphilus, had addressed words offensive to Apollo, and\r\nhad deserted his altars. To punish him the God sent him a disease of\r\nthe genitals, which the inhabitants of the country called the disease\r\nof Syphilus.\r\n\r\n\"Syphilidemque ab eo labem dixere coloni.\"\r\n\r\nBuret traces the origin of the word syphilis from sun, with, and filia,\r\nlove, the companion of love; which means in plain language that the pox\r\nis a disease transmitted more especially by venereal relations. The\r\nfirst great epidemic of syphilis occurred between 1493 and 1496, and\r\nattacked all ranks, neither the Church nor the Crown being spared. The\r\nravages of this disease were increased by the treatment with mercury\r\nwhich soon afterward was found in proper doses to be a specific in this\r\ndisease. It is possible that the terrible manifestations of syphilis of\r\nwhich we read in the older writers were in a great measure due to the\r\nenormous doses of mercury. At the present day syphilis is universally\r\nprevalent. In his excellent monograph Sturgis estimated in New York, in\r\n1873, that one out of 18 suffered from it; and White of Philadelphia\r\npronounces the opinion that \"not less than 50,000 people in that city\r\nare affected with syphilis.\" According to Rohe, on this basis Gihon\r\nestimates the number of syphilitics in the United States at one time as\r\n2,000,000.\r\n\r\nTo-day no disease, except possibly tuberculosis, is a greater agency in\r\naugmenting the general mortality and furthering sickness than syphilis.\r\nIts hereditary features, the numerous ways in which it may be\r\ncommunicated outside of the performance of the sexual act, and the\r\ncareful way in which it is kept from the sanitary authorities render it\r\na scourge which, at the present day, we seem to have no method of\r\nsuccessfully repressing.\r\n\r\nModern Mortality from Infectious Diseases.--As to the direct influence\r\non the mortality of the most common infectious diseases of the present\r\nday, tuberculosis, universally prevalent, is invariably in the lead. No\r\nrace or geographic situation is exempt from it. Osler mentions that in\r\nthe Blood Indian Reserve of the Canadian Northwest Territories, during\r\nsix years, among a population of about 2000 there were 127 deaths from\r\npulmonary consumption. This enormous death-rate, it is to be\r\nremembered, occurred in a tribe occupying one of the finest climates of\r\nthe world, among the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, a region in\r\nwhich consumption is extremely rare among the white population, and in\r\nwhich cases of tuberculosis from the Eastern provinces do remarkably\r\nwell. Mayo-Smith quotes a table illustrating the annual deaths (based\r\non the returns from 1887 to 1891) from certain infectious diseases per\r\n10,000 European inhabitants. The figures for each disease give a rough\r\nmeasure of its prevalence in different countries.
