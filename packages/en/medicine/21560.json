In the end the project was\r\ninterrupted by his last illness and death. Since then, circumstances\r\nhave prevented the work being undertaken until the present time.\r\n\r\nHaving been associated with him in his health work for some years,\r\nand having often discussed with him all his methods, I have had\r\nconsiderable advantages in undertaking to carry out his intention in\r\nthe shape of the volume now given to the public.\r\n\r\nIt represents as nearly as possible the book he planned himself; and\r\nthough greatly reduced in bulk, all that is of importance in the\r\noriginal eleven volumes has been inserted in it. It is complete in\r\nevery way; and in many details of treatment, improved methods, applied\r\nin later years by Dr. Kirk, have been substituted for the older methods\r\nhe first introduced.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement in alphabetical order has been very carefully attended\r\nto, and the treatment for any particular trouble within the scope of\r\nthe work can be quickly turned up.\r\n\r\nThis edition is sent forth in the hope that it may have even a wider\r\ncirculation than the last, and may be still more largely blessed than\r\nthat has been, to the relief of suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nI would appeal to those who know the value of this treatment to make\r\nthe book known to the many who would benefit by its teaching. The cost\r\nof the original edition was considerable, but this one is sold so\r\ncheaply that anyone may possess it.\r\n\r\n_EDWARD BRUCE KIRK._\r\n\r\nE. U. Manse,\r\n    Barrhead, Scotland.\r\n        _September, 1899._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this edition of \"Papers on Health\" some changes, as well as some\r\nentirely new features are introduced.\r\n\r\nThe large demand for the first one-volume edition has made it clear\r\nthat the public approve of the methods, both of arrangement and of\r\ncondensation employed in it.\r\n\r\nAnother edition being called for, it appeared evident that several\r\nchanges were desirable, in order to bring the book in line with rapidly\r\nincreasing medical knowledge, and to give full effect to more recent\r\nexperiences in the application of Dr. Kirk's treatment.\r\n\r\nSince the \"Papers\" were first written, medical, and especially\r\nsurgical, practice has very greatly changed, and some of the practices\r\nagainst which Dr. Kirk most vehemently protested have passed away.\r\nHence, certain modifications introduced into this edition, for which\r\nthe editor accepts full responsibility. For those who wish to consult\r\nthe actual writings of Dr. Kirk, the original eleven volume edition is\r\nstill available.\r\n\r\nGreat advances have also been made in the knowledge of the causes of\r\ndisease; and preventive methods of treatment by regulation of diet and\r\nhabits of life are much better understood. To incorporate some\r\nreference to these in a work dealing with health generally, appeared to\r\nus absolutely necessary. For these additions also the writer accepts\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWhere it appeared to be useful, illustrations have been introduced,\r\nwhich may help those to whom the treatment is quite new, to practice it\r\nmore easily and correctly, and to understand better the theories on\r\nwhich it is founded.\r\n\r\nThese changes have enlarged the book, and somewhat increased the price,\r\nwhich is, however, still such as to place the volume within the reach\r\nof all classes.\r\n\r\nIt is most gratifying to know through letters received from almost all\r\nparts of the world, that many are benefitted very greatly by the\r\ntreatments described. We have constant evidence coming before us from\r\nour own experience with patients of the powerful effect they have in\r\nhealing the sick, and even saving life. We send out this new edition in\r\nthe hope that it may spread still more widely, the knowledge of such\r\nsimple and yet effective means of cure.\r\n\r\n_EDWARD BRUCE KIRK_\r\n\r\nE. U. Manse,\r\n    Barrhead, Scotland.\r\n        _July, 1904._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this book we set forth a series of simple remedies and preventives\r\nof many common troubles. They are all well tried and have been proved\r\nby long experience to be effective and safe.\r\n\r\nWe give, as far as we know, the reasons why they are likely to do good,\r\nbut we acknowledge that there are things which we cannot fully explain.\r\nFor instance, we do not know why a well aired lather of M'Clinton's\r\nSoap should have the soothing effect it undoubtedly possesses, or why\r\nspreading handfuls of this lather over the stomach of a person\r\nsuffering from retching or indigestion should give such relief, we only\r\nknow that it does!\r\n\r\nSome may sneer at the remedy and say it is a case of faith healing and\r\nassert that any other application, if put on with equal credulity,\r\nwould have the same effect. But take a case that lately came under our\r\nnotice. Indigestion and colic had rendered a baby a few weeks old\r\nrestless and miserable from the day of its birth. The nurse was kept\r\nnursing it all night long, trying to soothe it; at last the mother who\r\nhad frequently tried the soap lather for occasional attacks of\r\nindigestion, and always with good effect, determined to try it on the\r\nbaby. It worked like a charm, the little one was at once soothed and\r\nslept all night, only waking once for its food. This was repeated for\r\nseveral nights, for until the lather was applied the child would not\r\nsettle to sleep. In a few days the child was quite well, the habit of\r\nsleeping was established and the application was discontinued. Now it\r\ncannot be said that faith in the remedy had anything to do with the\r\nresult in this case. We only wish every mother would have faith enough\r\nto give this simple treatment a fair trial, making up the lather as\r\ndescribed in this book and not, as many do, \"improving\" on our method\r\nby rubbing the soap on the wet skin and making a sort of lather with\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\nWe may say that the soap used for making this lather is not M'Clinton's\r\nshaving soap. The latter is specially made to give a thick durable\r\nlather; for curative purposes use the lather from M'Clinton's toilet or\r\nhousehold soap.\r\n\r\nAgain, why should the use of the linen underwear we recommend have such\r\na beneficial effect on sufferers from rheumatism and various skin\r\ntroubles? We have suggested possible explanations, and if these seem\r\ninadequate we can only say we know that it has these effects no matter\r\nhow they are produced.\r\n\r\nThere are many things in nature that we cannot explain, and since the\r\ndiscovery of X Rays, Radium, etc., scientists are much less dogmatic in\r\ndeclaring anything impossible.\r\n\r\nThe diet we recommend for health and disease is as simple and cheap as\r\nour other treatment. That plain fare is good for both mind and body was\r\nproved by the four youths at the Babylonian Court over 2,000 years ago,\r\nbut alas people squander that priceless boon, health, by letting\r\nappetite rule their lives.\r\n\r\nWe only ask for our treatment a fair trial on our lines. We claim that\r\nours are common sense methods. Anyone can see that if a head is hot and\r\nfevered the application of a cold towel is likely to lower that heat\r\nand reduce the fever. But it is no use putting a little bit of wet rag\r\non and then saying our treatment has failed. Large towels repeatedly\r\nchanged for an hour or more may be needed, and this will give more\r\ntrouble than administering some dose from the chemist's shop, but the\r\nresults are well worth the additional work.\r\n\r\nThe day is hastening on when men and women will see what fools they\r\nhave been, not because they had no sense, but certainly because they\r\nhad failed to use the abundance which God has given to all.\r\n\r\nNot one of the remedies we have recommended can hurt any one, as they\r\nare only those which we have for years seen used successfully by\r\nordinary persons who were willing to do their best to cure the\r\nsuffering. If we can secure one night of sound sleep, or one day of\r\ncomfort for another, we are bound to do our very best, and it is a\r\nwonderful reward to know that one has secured even this in our\r\nsuffering world. Our Heavenly Father gives no monopoly of this\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Vertebral Column; 2. Skull; 4. Sternum; 7. Collar\r\nBone; 15. Hip Bone; 16. Sacrum; 18. Femur; 19. Knee Pan; 21.

If it be cut open, a wound is made\r\nwhich is often very difficult to heal. Avoid then, _cutting_ in such\r\ncases. If the swelling develops under FOMENTATION (_see_), the uncut\r\nflesh through which it will then break will be in a better state\r\neventually for healing than if cut. Where corrupt matter is clearly\r\npresent, and in seeking an outlet is endangering the surrounding\r\nhealthy tissue, the cutting open of the swelling will, on the other\r\nhand, greatly relieve, and conduce to a more speedy cure. This is best\r\nperformed by a thoroughly good surgeon. Thorough syringing of the\r\ncavity from which the matter comes out (_see_ Wounds, Syringing) is the\r\nbest means of cure, aided by thorough heating of the swelling and\r\nsurrounding parts with moist heat for an hour or more twice a day. This\r\nheating must embrace a large part of the limb or body, as the case may\r\nbe. If the trouble be on the hip or groin, the armchair FOMENTATION\r\n(_see_) should be employed. Other parts should be treated on the same\r\nliberal principle of heating (_see_ Fomentation).\r\n\r\nRich diet is extremely hurtful. Egg switched in cream, rum, brandy, and\r\nsuch things are to be carefully avoided. Alcoholic liquors are\r\nespecially fatal. _See_ Alcohol; Assimilation; Diet; Drinks: Foods,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOatmeal jelly (_see_ Food in Illness), wheaten meal porridge, Saltcoats\r\nbiscuits (_see_ Biscuits and Water), form the best nutrients in such\r\ncases. These are really much stronger diet than the egg, brandy, etc.\r\n\r\nIf the abscess be in the foot or leg, with indications of diseased\r\nbone, the leg should be bathed in hot water up to the knee. Dissolve a\r\npiece of M'Clinton's soap in the water used, and let it be as hot as\r\ncan be borne. After drying, rub the limb gently yet firmly with olive\r\noil for five minutes. Dress with oil, lint, and a proper bandage.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a limb which threatened the very life of the patient\r\ntreated as above. The general symptoms abated almost immediately;\r\ngrowth, as well as healing, set in, and the limb was quite restored to\r\nits normal condition. But patient persistence in treatment is needed\r\nfor a bad case.\r\n\r\nIf under bathing or fomentation the abscess seems to swell, such is\r\nonly the natural progress of cure, and should not be regarded as\r\nincrease of the trouble. Where the swelling shews undoubted signs of\r\ndiseased matter below the surface, it may be opened as above directed.\r\nWe know of limbs that have been long distorted, and under rubbing and\r\nfomenting they are becoming gradually all they ought to be. No one need\r\nfear that by such treatment they will grow worse. _See_ Armpit\r\nSwelling; Bone, Diseased; Knee; Limbs, Inflamed, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcetic Acid.--For use in our treatment we recommend Coutts' Acetic\r\nAcid. It is of uniform strength and purity, and can be had from most\r\ndruggists. Weak acid may be understood as one part of this to twelve\r\nparts of water. In many cases, however, much greater weakness than this\r\nis necessary, owing to the tenderness of the parts treated. As a\r\ngeneral rule, the dilute acid should only cause a _gentle_ nipping\r\nsensation and heat in the sore. If it is painful, no good is done.\r\nFrequent gentle applications are always much better than a few severe\r\nones.\r\n\r\nTasting the acid is a good test. If it can be swallowed without\r\ninconvenience, it may then be tried on a tender part, and if necessary\r\neven further reduced in strength. Where more convenient to get it,\r\nwhite wine vinegar may be used instead of this weak acid; it will do\r\nequally well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcidity of the Stomach.--Often caused by unwholesome food, bad or\r\ndeficient teeth, or by too rapid eating. Where these causes exist, they\r\nshould be first removed. Eat slowly, and not too much at a time, and\r\nsee that only _well-cooked_, easily digested food be taken. Pastry,\r\nsweets and carbonaceous foods in general should not be taken alone at\r\nthe same meal, they should always accompany some form of proteid food.\r\nIf, however, pain in stomach is found after meal it will be found that\r\nmilk can be substituted with comfort. (_See_ Diet). (_See_ Food in\r\nHealth). If this does not cure, do not take soda as a remedy. Although\r\nsoda neutralises the sourness, it produces other effects, and tends to\r\ncause disease of the stomach. A wineglassful of hot water, with a\r\nteaspoonful of white vinegar in it, is the best cure. Although this is\r\nitself acid, it acts so as to remove the _cause_ of the sourness in the\r\nstomach, and is most beneficial otherwise. It is still better to take a\r\ntablespoonful of this hot water and vinegar every five minutes for an\r\nhour daily before dinner. Instead of the vinegar, a slice of lemon may\r\nbe put in the hot water. This will act more efficiently in some cases.\r\nIn other cases a teaspoonful of Glauber's Salts, taken in a _large_\r\ntumblerful of hot water, half-an-hour before breakfast, for a few\r\nweeks, will relieve almost entirely.\r\n\r\nReaders must note not to use _both_ the salts and vinegar drink at\r\nonce. They are intended to cure different sorts of stomach acidity,\r\ncaused differently.\r\n\r\nLook also well to the warming of COLD FEET (_see_), and see that the\r\nwhole skin be cleansed daily with soap lather (_see_ Lather and Soap)\r\nand stimulated with olive-oil rubbing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAconite.--Often in cases where our treatment fails to cure, the failure\r\nis due to the patient taking aconite as an allopathic remedy. Used\r\nhomoeopathically, it may be harmless, but if taken in considerable\r\ndoses, even once a month, it prevents all cure. It gives relief in\r\nheart palpitation, and in case of extreme sensibility, but its other\r\npoisonous effects far outweigh the temporary benefits. A gentle, kindly\r\nsoaping with soap lather (_see_ Lather and Soap) over all the body will\r\nrelieve extreme sensibility far better than aconite, and can be\r\nfrequently repeated without injury. Aconite must be avoided if our\r\ntreatment is to be effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nAction, Balance of.--An excellent guide to the proper treatment of any\r\ncase is to be found in the distribution of heat in the patient's body.\r\nHot parts are to be cooled, and cold parts warmed, often both at the\r\nsame time, so as to restore the proper balance of vital action. _Gentle\r\nprogressive_ measures are always best in this, especially with\r\nchildren. Cold feet are warmed by BATHING (_see_) and FOMENTATION\r\n(_see_). A heated head may be cooled with COLD TOWELS (_see_) or with\r\nsoap LATHER (_see_). This principle of seeking a proper balance should\r\nbe borne in mind throughout all our treatment. Its importance can\r\nhardly be exaggerated, as the restoration of this balance alone will\r\nfrequently effect an almost magical cure where drugs have been wholly\r\nineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Pains.--_See_ Child-bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir.--The Black Hole of Calcutta is an object lesson of how necessary\r\nto life is the renewal of the air supply. Few people, however, reflect\r\nthat a deficient supply of fresh air may affect the health, though far\r\nshort of what will cause death. Many hospitable people will invite so\r\nmany friends to their houses that the amount of air each can get is\r\nless than 1-20th of what the law insists shall be provided for the\r\nprisoners in our gaols. Superabundant provision is made for the wants\r\nof the stomachs of these guests, but none at all for the more important\r\norgan--the lungs. The headaches and lack of appetite next morning are\r\nattributed to the supper instead of the repeatedly breathed air, for\r\neach guest gives off almost 20 cubic feet of used-up air per hour. No\r\none would ask their guests to wash with water others had used; how many\r\noffer them air which has been made foul by previous use? Everyone knows\r\nthat in our lungs oxygen is removed from the air inhaled, and its place\r\ntaken by carbonic acid gas. Besides this deoxydizing, the air becomes\r\nloaded with organic matter which is easily detected by the olfactory\r\norgans of those who have just come in, and so are in a position to\r\npromptly compare the air inside with what they have been breathing. The\r\nexhilaration produced by deep breathing of pure air is well known.\r\nWhat, therefore, prevents everyone enjoying it at all times? Simply the\r\nfear of \"cold\"--an unfortunate name for that low form of fever properly\r\ncalled catarrh, and a name which is largely responsible for this\r\nmistaken idea. \"Colds\" are now known to be infectious, being often\r\ncaught in close ill-ventilated places of public assembly. Most people\r\nsuppose that it is the change from the heat to the cold outside that\r\ngives them \"cold,\" whereas the \"cold\" has been contracted inside. There\r\nis no lack of evidence that wide open windows day and night, summer and\r\nwinter, so strengthen and invigorate that colds are rarely taken, and\r\nwhen taken, generally in a mild form. This also applies to influenza.\r\nIf delicate consumptives can stand, without any gradual breaking-in to\r\nit, unlimited fresh air, and can lie by day and night in open sheds, no\r\none need dread at once to adopt the open-window system. Although few\r\nwill believe it, until they try it, a wide open window does not produce\r\na draught as does one slightly opened, and it is safer and pleasanter\r\nto go in for abundant fresh air than to try what might be called a\r\nmoderate course. Many think that with an open window the heat of the\r\nfire is practically wasted. They do not know that the _radiant_ heat of\r\nthe fire will warm the person it falls on even though the temperature\r\nof the room is very low. The Canadian hunter before his fire is\r\ncomfortably warm, though the air around him may be a long way below\r\nzero. Extra clothing may be worn if any chilliness is felt. While the\r\nbody is warm cold air has an invigorating effect on the lungs. Indeed,\r\nthe body soon gets accustomed to the colder air, and those who practise\r\nkeeping open windows winter and summer find that they do not require\r\nheavier clothing than those who sit with windows shut. A slight or even\r\nconsiderable feeling of coldness, when due to cold air and not to\r\nill-health, will not harm.\r\n\r\nThis is no new idea. Dr. Henry McCormac, of Belfast, father of the\r\neminent surgeon, Sir William McCormac, wrote forty years ago:--\"The\r\nmainly unreasoning dread of night air, so termed, is a great impediment\r\nto free ventilation by night. And yet day and night air is the same\r\nvirtually, does not differ appreciably. The air by night, whether damp\r\nor dry, is equally pure, equally salubrious with the air by day, and\r\ncalls not less solicitously for ceaseless admission into our dwellings.\r\nAir, ere it reaches the lungs, is always damp. Quite dry air is\r\nirrespirable. It needs no peculiar or unusual habitude in order to\r\nrespire what is termed night air. Exposure to contact with the day air\r\nequally prepares us for exposure to the contact with the night air. We\r\ncan multiply our coverings by night with even greater ease than we can\r\nby day, and with the most perfect certainty of producing and obtaining\r\nwarmth. Good heavens! How is it that people are so wildly mistaken as\r\nif the great wise Deity, as he does by every exquisite and perfect\r\nadaption, did not intend that we should make use of the purest,\r\nsweetest air day and night always? The prospective results of breathing\r\npurest air by night are so infinitely desirable, the immediate\r\nenjoyment is so great that it only needs a trial to be approved of and\r\nadopted for ever.... Reasonable precautions--that is to say, adequate\r\nnight coverings--being resorted to, no colour of risk to the lungs,\r\neven of the most delicate, can possibly ensue. For, it is stagnant air,\r\nair pre-breathed only, and not pure unprerespired air that makes lungs\r\ndelicate. Although air, warmth, food, and cleanliness be cardinal\r\nconditions and essential to life, still the most important of all\r\nhealth factors is air--air pure and undefiled alike by day and by\r\nnight.... The constant uneasy dread of taking cold, which haunts the\r\nminds of patients and their friends, is doubtless the one great reason\r\nwhy fresh air is thrust aside. And yet cold will not be caught, were it\r\nin Nova Zembla itself, by night, if only the sleeper's body be\r\nadequately covered.... The pulses or puffs of air that comes in\r\nceaselessly, winter and summer, through open windows by night inspire\r\njust as if one slept in the open air, a sort of ecstasy. Gush follows\r\ngush, full of delightfulness, replacing the used-up air and purifying\r\nthe blood. It has oftimes been said to me, 'I open the windows the\r\nmoment I get out of bed;' to this I have uniformly replied, 'the moment\r\nto open the window is before you get into bed, not when you get out of\r\nit.' You cannot otherwise with entire certainty secure the benefit of\r\nan ever ceaselessly renewed night air so all essential to the blood's\r\nrenewal and the maintenance of health.... With abundant night coverings\r\nthere is no shadow of risk. There is none of rheumatism, none of\r\nbronchitis, in short no risk whatever. The only, the real risk, which\r\nwe incur, is that of closing our sleeping chamber windows, of debarring\r\nourselves of pure air during our repose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAppetite.--Should be an indication that food in general or some certain\r\nkind of food is needed by the body. Thus the appetite is the natural\r\ntest of the amount and kind of food required. Over-eating and\r\nindulgence in stimulating foods and drinks, insufficient mastication\r\nand bolting of the food (_see_ Over-eating, etc.) give us a false\r\nappetite, thus causing over-eating once more. A return to a simple and\r\nmoderate diet will restore the natural appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir Bath.--This may with advantage to the health of the skin and body\r\nin general, be indulged in every morning during some of the toilet\r\noperations, such as shaving, or preferably, dumbell exercise or Swedish\r\ngymnastics. If exercises are done in a nude condition the utmost\r\nfreedom for the muscles is obtained. In a short time a notable change\r\nwill be observed in the skin, which will lose its pasty appearance, and\r\nbecome soft flesh and of a healthy colour. If possible have the bedroom\r\nwith windows facing the morning sun, so that the sunlight can also\r\nshine in. There are many sanitaria on the Continent and in America\r\nwhere this form of \"bathing\" is practised. Indeed, one of the great\r\nbenefits of sea-bathing (overlooked in this country) is the exposure of\r\nthe skin to air and light. Consequently if the weather and social\r\ncustom permits, as much time as possible should be spent after\r\nimmersion, lounging on the sand. A child's natural instinct leads it to\r\nplay about after its bath in the sea instead of coming at once to be\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\nA young infant will enjoy lying on a rug on the floor without any\r\nclothing and with the window open. Older children will benefit by\r\nrunning about the garden in summer time in bare feet, and with only one\r\ngarment, say a cotton frock.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to clothe children too warmly, indeed, the same\r\nmay be said of adults. Garments should always be loose and porous, so\r\nas to allow of the beneficial action of the air on the skin. One of the\r\nobjections to corsets is that they do not fulfil these conditions\r\n(_see_ Tight Lacing, Skin, Care of.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAir-tight Covering.--The covering of oiled silk, or guttapercha, so\r\nfrequently placed over wet bandages when these are applied to any part\r\nof the body, is not only useless, but often positively hurtful. It is\r\ntrue that the waterproof covering retains the moisture in the bandage,\r\nbut it is also true that great heat is developed, and the waste\r\nproducts in the perspiration are retained on the surface of the skin.\r\nThe effect of this is injurious in a very high degree. A little soft\r\nold linen for the wet bandage, with a piece of double new flannel over\r\nit, will leave all the pores of the skin open, and allow all waste\r\nproducts to pass away freely, while the heat and moisture are retained\r\nas much as necessary.\r\n\r\nIn other cases two folds of moist flannel next to skin, and two folds\r\nof the same, dry, above the moist ones, will make an excellent bandage.\r\nThis applied all over the abdomen, in case of abdominal dropsy, will\r\nhave a most beneficial result.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we often say new flannel is simply that few know how to\r\nwash it so as to retain its soft and porous nature as it is when good\r\nand new. That softness and porousness may be retained in a very easy\r\nway. When you have put your soiled flannel through two good washings\r\nwith soap in the usual way, dip it in clean boiling water, and finish\r\ncleaning it with that dipping. You will have it white and fine as when\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nM'Clinton's soap, being made from plant ashes and not from soda, is\r\nmuch less liable to shrink and harden flannel; in fact, it is best for\r\nall fine washing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcohol.--This, in various forms, as brandy, whiskey, rum, wine,\r\ncordials, beer and stout, is a frequent prescription in many troubles.\r\nIn no cases have we known good effects from its use, which is most\r\nstrongly to be condemned. Various reasons for this statement will be\r\nfound under the heading of troubles for which alcohol is prescribed.\r\nHere we simply give the fundamental truths as to its action on the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn our system of treatment we ever seek to nurse and stimulate those\r\nnerve-masses which constitute the sources of vital action. Every drop\r\nof alcohol does so much to weaken and destroy these. A certain\r\nquantity, if taken by the strongest man, will kill that man as surely\r\nas a bullet in the brain. Half the quantity will only render him\r\ninsensible. Half that, again, only renders him incapable of controlling\r\nhis bodily movements. Half that, again, only slightly disturbs the\r\nsystem; but it affects him in the very same manner in which the fatal\r\ndose affects him, though not in the same degree. It is a narcotic, and\r\nlike all such, it always _reduces_ vital action, while nothing is more\r\nimportant in all healing than to _increase_ it. Hence alcohol is the\r\ndeadly foe of healing, and one chief preparer of the system to fall\r\nbefore disease. The so-called stimulating action of alcohol has been\r\nthoroughly explained by the author of these papers in other writings,\r\nand shewn to be simply an indirect and temporary effect, obtained at\r\nthe price of a considerable reduction of the general vitality of the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nYoung ladies, as a class, are subject to a terrible danger. Great\r\nnumbers of mothers actually make their daughters drunkards by ever and\r\nagain dosing them with brandy. This is done in secret, and imagined to\r\nbe a most excellent thing. For instance, if the bowels get lax, as is\r\nthe case in certain stages of disease, brandy is given as a remedy. How\r\nlittle do those who give it know that it is lessening vital energy and\r\nmaking cure impossible! But it is doing nothing else. We have many\r\ntimes over seen the dying sufferer restless and ill with nothing but\r\nthe effects of constant small doses of brandy, or alcohol in some other\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIn looseness of the bowels we give a teaspoonful of lemon juice in a\r\nlittle hot water and sugar. That has as much effect as is desirable,\r\nand it has no bad effect whatever. Or enema injections may be employed.\r\n(_See_ Diarrhoea, Dysentery, Enema). Even infants are treated with\r\n\"brandy,\" till we cannot help believing they die of the drink, and\r\nwould survive if it were put away. Gradually the cruel folly of all\r\nthis will, we doubt not, dawn upon the general mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmputations.--These are often performed in cases in which proper\r\ntreatment on the lines of these papers, would save both life and limb.\r\nBy all means, before consenting to such an irrevocable act as\r\namputating a limb, let the treatment with fomentations, hot water, and\r\nacetic acid be well and thoroughly tried. Many limbs which were\r\nmedically condemned have been thus saved within our personal knowledge.\r\nIn some cases the disease may be obstinate; but at least let a fair\r\ntrial be given to our treatment before giving up a limb. The treatment\r\nwill be found under the headings of the various troubles and parts\r\naffected (_see_ Armpit Swelling; Bone, Diseased; Knee-swelling; Pains,\r\netc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAngina Pectoris.--In a variety of cases, more or less severe spasmodic\r\npains are felt in the chest. Angina Pectoris (literally, _agony of the\r\nchest_) is one of the worst of these. All these pains, as a rule, may\r\nbe removed completely by treatment such as the following:--\r\n\r\nPrepare a bed (long enough for the patient to lie at full length upon\r\nhis back), with a large thick sheet folded on the lower part of it.\r\nSpread over this sheet a blanket wrung out of hot water, so as to be\r\nboth moist (but not wet) and warm (_see_ Fomentation). See that the\r\nblanket is not so hot as to burn the patient and add to his pain. It\r\nmust be tested with the back of the hand, and be just as warm as this\r\ncan well bear. On this let the patient lie down, and wrap him up\r\ntightly in it from the feet up to above the haunches. Have two or three\r\ntowels folded so as to be about six inches broad, and the length of\r\nthat part of the patient's spine above the hot blanket. Wring these out\r\nof cold water. Place one over the spine, so as to lie close along it;\r\non this, place a dry towel to keep the damp from the bed, and let the\r\npatient lie down on his back, so as to bring the cold towel in close\r\ncontact with the spine. When this towel becomes warm, another cold one\r\nmust be put in its place. After about half an hour's pack and eight\r\nchanges of the cold towel, the pain in the chest should be subdued for\r\nthe time. If the cold towel does not heat in five minutes, the\r\npatient's vitality is low, and a _hot_ cloth should be placed along the\r\nspine, and renewed several times, and then another cold one; but as a\r\nrule this will not be required. When taken out of the pack, let the\r\nskin be washed with SOAP (_see_) and warm water; then a slight sponge\r\nof nearly cold water, and a gentle rubbing with olive or almond oil.\r\nRub the back first, and gently \"shampoo\" all the muscles; that is,\r\nknead and move the muscles under the skin so as to make them rub over\r\none another.\r\n\r\nIf the pain in the chest be of an inflammatory nature, the cold towels\r\nmust be applied over the place where it is felt, instead of on the\r\nspine (_see_ Inflammation.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnkle Swelling.--When long continued in connection with disease or\r\naccident, this sometimes leads to a partial withering of the limb up to\r\nits very root. In such a case it is best to deal first with the roots\r\nof those nerves which supply the limb, which are, in the case of the\r\nlegs, in the lower part of the back. It is important to apply light\r\npressure to these roots by gently squeezing the muscles of the lower\r\nback. This raises a feeling of gentle heat, which slowly passes down\r\nthe limbs even to the toes. Then the gentle pressure and squeezing must\r\nbe carried all down the limb, avoiding any degree of pain, until all\r\nits muscles have had their share. While progressing _down_ the limb\r\nwith his rubbing, let the rubber be careful that the individual strokes\r\nof his hands be _upwards_, towards the hip. The blood will thus be\r\npropelled towards the _heart_, while the _stimulus_ of rubbing is\r\nconveyed along the nerve trunks towards the foot. The squeezing should\r\nbe done with a grasping movement of the hands, the limb being held\r\nencircled in both hands, thumbs upwards. Warm olive oil is used in this\r\nsqueezing, and also, if the skin be hard and dry, soap lather (_see_\r\nLather).\r\n\r\nEven slight displacements of bones will disappear under such treatment,\r\nif patiently continued day after day, as the patient can bear it\r\nwithout fatigue. In such gentle remedies, perseverance plays a large\r\npart. (_See_ Abscess; Diet; Exercise).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnkle, Twisted or Crushed.--Place the foot as soon as possible in warm\r\nwater, as hot as can comfortably be borne; keep it there until free\r\nfrom pain, or for an hour, or even more if necessary. If the flesh be\r\ntorn, dress with cloths wrung out of vinegar or weak acetic acid before\r\nplacing in the water.\r\n\r\nWhen the bath has done its work, and the limb comes out of the water\r\nalarmingly swollen, good and skilful bandaging will do excellent work.\r\nIf you have at hand an old shirt, or some such thing, tear it into\r\nstrips about three inches wide, till you have as much material as will\r\nswathe the whole limb from behind the toes up to the top of the thigh.\r\nThis need not be all in one piece, but only so that you may apply it in\r\nsuch a way as to bring a very gentle pressure on the whole surface of\r\nthe injured limb. It is important that the bandaging should be\r\ncomfortable. The way in which bandaging is sometimes done is cruel in\r\nthe extreme. Cases that are a disgrace to humanity are constantly\r\ncoming under our notice, in which limbs are lost for life by the\r\ntreatment they receive in this respect. Skilful surgeons do it in the\r\nmost gentle manner; they even swathe the limbs in soft loose cotton\r\nbefore they apply the bandages, so that a perfectly equal and\r\ncomforting pressure may be secured. Lay the limb to rest, well and\r\nsoftly supported in a horizontal position. When the swelling falls,\r\ngently tighten the bandage from time to time as required. Each time the\r\nbandages are removed for this purpose, sponge the limb with warm\r\nvinegar or weak ACETIC ACID (_see_). When the swelling subsides, the\r\nankle may be put again in the hot bath for half-an-hour, and then, if\r\nany bones be broken, is the time for setting them right. The ankle will\r\nprobably turn black. If so, do not apply leeches, but allow the black\r\nblood to be absorbed by natural process.\r\n\r\nA twisted or bruised wrist or hand is to be treated in the same way.\r\nThe swelling may also be removed by gentle rubbing _upwards_ along the\r\nlimb, so as to help the blood in its course.\r\n\r\n\r\nArmpit Swelling.--Often this comes as the result of a chill, or of\r\nenfeeblement of the system from various causes. In the early stage,\r\nsuch a swelling should not be treated so as to develop a sore.\r\nTreatment with iodine is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, in this early stage, is to increase vital action in\r\nthe part, and also in the whole system (_see_ Abscess). Moist heat is\r\nto be applied. Make a BRAN POULTICE (_see_), which should come right\r\nround from over the spine, over the swelling, and over the whole\r\nshoulder. Let this be kept hot for an hour at least. If it can be thus\r\napplied twice a day without too much fatigue, do so. If the swelling\r\nsoftens and becomes less under this treatment, a few cold cloths may be\r\napplied to brace the part and aid its vitality. Do not, on any account,\r\nmake the patient shiver. If the swelling increases and becomes\r\ndiscoloured, keep to the hot treatment until it bursts and discharges.\r\nFor treatment then, _see_ Abscess; Wounds.\r\n\r\nDuring all this treatment the whole back should be gently rubbed daily\r\nwith warm olive oil for half an hour, if as much can be borne.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssimilation.--Is the process whereby the digested food is carried into\r\nthe blood stream, and thus conveyed to the different parts of the body\r\nwhere the hungry cells are in need of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--A bit of the inner coat of the small\r\nintestine.]\r\n\r\nFine threads of blood vessels (capillaries) take it up from the stomach\r\nand intestines. Also along the intestines there are little projections\r\n(villi), through which the food passes into a blood stream leading to\r\nthe liver, where the blood is then purified. These projections also\r\ncontain lacteals or little vessels containing blood without its red\r\ncorpuscles. A duct carries this colourless blood mixed with absorbed\r\nfood to the left side of the neck, where it empties into the blood\r\nstream. These lacteals have a special affinity for the fat of the food.\r\nMost of the rest of the food, including the proteid and the\r\ncarbohydrate or starchy portion now in the form of sugar, passes into\r\nthe capillaries, and then is led to the liver.\r\n\r\nThe liver will not let through more sugar than is required, storing it\r\nup for future use. It also acts as a careful guardian, by arresting\r\nmany poisons which would otherwise pass into the general circulation.\r\nThe liver requires for the proper performance of its functions plenty\r\nof pure blood, hence the necessity for fresh air and exercise, that the\r\nlungs may work well. The liver is easily influenced by alcoholic\r\nbeverages, and by getting too hard work to do through eating rich\r\nfoods. A consideration of this delicate and intricate process, whereby\r\nthe digested food is absorbed, will show that badly-digested food can\r\nnot hope to be well assimilated, consequently attention should be paid\r\nto the quantity and quality of the food we eat (_see_ Digestion; Diet).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Two villi containing lacteals. The white canals\r\nare lacteals, the darker lines indicate blood vessels (capillaries).\r\nMagnified 100 diameters. (_From \"Quain's Anatomy_.\")]\r\n\r\nWhatever thus makes living substance is nourishment; whatever fails to\r\ndo so is not. If food be taken, and even digested, without being thus\r\nassimilated, it becomes an injury to a patient instead of a help. In\r\ncases of fever, inflammatory disease, or wasting sores, much rich food\r\nfeeds the fire. It is like laying rafters on the roof of a burning\r\nhouse for purposes of repair. In such a case small quantities of milk,\r\nor milk and hot water (_see_ Digestion), represent the total food which\r\ncan be effectively used in the body. We write on this subject that in\r\ntreatment our friends may watch not to injure by making the blood too\r\nrich in elements which the system cannot usefully assimilate. Such\r\nfoods as oatmeal jelly and wheaten porridge will often furnish more\r\nreal nourishment than pounds of bread, beef, and potatoes. A little\r\ncareful thought will guide to correct treatment in this matter. An\r\neasily assimilated diet is found in Saltcoats biscuits and hot water;\r\nmany inveterate stomach troubles have yielded to this, when taken as\r\nsole diet for some weeks (_see_ Biscuits and Water).\r\n\r\nTreatment may also be given for lack of assimilative power. The back,\r\nespecially on either side of the spine, is rubbed with gentle pressure\r\nand hot olive oil. This pressure is so applied that a genial heat\r\narises along the whole spinal column. This done twice a day, for\r\nhalf-an-hour at a time, and continued for several weeks, will markedly\r\nrestore assimilative power. Cases which have been perfectly helpless\r\nfor eight and even ten years are cured by this simple method,\r\nsufficiently and carefully followed.\r\n\r\nWe had a patient who was stout, but weak and weary, with the muscles\r\nslack and showing loss of power. The effect of back-rubbing,\r\naccompanied by easily assimilated food in small quantities and often,\r\nwas to lessen his weight by a considerable amount. But the muscular\r\npower at once began to increase, and the man was soon like one made\r\nanew. Digestion had not been impaired in this case, but the blood\r\nformed by it was not converted into good living substance. Sight and\r\nhearing have even been restored by these means when the failure in eye\r\nor ear has been due to waste material accumulating, as frequently is\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nIn connection with many troubles, what may be called _local\r\nassimilation_ has to be considered. A foot, say, with a bad abscess or\r\ndiseased bone (_see_ Pain, Severe) is cured by hot bathing and\r\npressure. From a shrunken and feeble limb, the leg grows to a healthy\r\nand strong one. This occurs because the heat and pressure have so\r\nstimulated its vitality that the material supplied by the blood can be\r\nutilised in the leg for purposes of healthy growth. So with any other\r\npart of the body. Such diet as we have indicated supplies easily\r\nassimilated substance. The local heating, pressure, and bathing enable\r\nthis substance to be utilised where it is needed. A little careful\r\nthought on this line will guide to proper treatment of almost any case\r\nwhere assimilation has failed, either locally or generally, and will\r\nlead the way to a method of cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsthma exists in various forms, having equally various causes. One of\r\nthese causes, giving rise to a comparatively simple form of the\r\ndisease, is cramp of the ring-muscle of the windpipe, so contracting\r\nthe windpipe that breathing is rendered difficult. A \"wheeze\" is heard\r\nin breathing, though there is no bronchitis or lung trouble present.\r\nThe cause of this cramp is an irritation of the ring-muscle's nerve. It\r\ncan be relieved by pressing cold cloths gently along the spine, from\r\nthe back of the head to between the shoulders, taking care that the\r\npatient remains _generally warm_ during the treatment, and attending to\r\nthe feet and skin as directed below in this article. Sometimes the\r\ncause seems to lie in the air of the place where the sufferer resides.\r\nA change either to high ground or the seaside will often entirely\r\nremove asthma, especially in the young. In any such case a trial should\r\nbe made of several places, if that be at all possible, and that place\r\nfixed upon where the asthma is least felt. At SEAMILL SANATORIUM\r\n(_see_) many asthmatic persons have found complete freedom from their\r\ntrouble from the day of their arrival, and the treatment given has made\r\nthis cure permanent.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of asthma is lack of power in the breathing muscles. In\r\nsuch a case the patient clings to a particular _attitude_, in which\r\nalone he can breathe. This is in most cases due to a lack of vitality\r\nin the root nerve which supply the breathing muscles.\r\n\r\nAn attack of this may often be relieved by rubbing, with the points of\r\nthe fingers chiefly, gently yet firmly up and down each side of the\r\nspine, close to the bone. Even rubbing above the clothing will\r\nfrequently relieve. The roots of the nerves supplying power to the\r\nbreathing muscles lie just on each side of the spine, and this kind of\r\nrubbing stimulates these roots. It is not rubbing of the skin or\r\nbackbone which is wanted, but such gentle treatment of the nerve roots\r\non either side of the bone as makes them glow with genial warmth. This\r\nrubbing is of course better done on the surface of the skin. See that\r\nthe patient is warm, then dip the fingers in cold water, and rub as\r\ndirected. When the water makes the patient feel chilly or he tires of\r\nit, use fresh olive oil, warmed if necessary. Avoid all alcoholic\r\ndrinks, which simply rob the nerves of the very power needed for cure.\r\nTemporary relief may be given by such drinks, but it is at the expense\r\nof lowered life and reduced chances of recovery.\r\n\r\nA tablespoonful of _hot_ water every five minutes is the best curative\r\ndrink. It may be given for several hours if required. To give this\r\nrubbing treatment and drinking hot water fair play, however, attention\r\nmust be paid most carefully to the _feet_ and _skin_ of the patient.\r\nThe feet frequently are cold, and in bad cases swell, the skin at and\r\nabove the swelling being pale and soft. In minor cases this state of\r\nthe feet may be treated by rubbing with hot olive oil. In serious cases\r\nrubbing is to be alternated with bathing the feet in hot water, until\r\nthe feet and limbs glow with heat. This may be done two or three times\r\na day, for half an hour, or even an hour. It increases very greatly the\r\nvital power for breathing.\r\n\r\nAgain, the skin in bad cases of asthma becomes dry, hard, and a light\r\nbrown substance forms on its surface. If the skin thus fails, severe\r\nwork is thrown on the already overloaded lungs, and the breathing is\r\nmuch worse. Give the patient a night's pack in the SOAPY BLANKET\r\n(_see_). If there is not strength to stand the entire treatment, keep\r\nin the blanket pack for a shorter time--one, two, or three hours. Not\r\nmore than two nights of this treatment should be needed at a time. The\r\nsoapy blanket greatly stimulates the skin, and opens all the closed\r\npores, immensely relieving the lungs. If feet, skin, and back be\r\ntreated as we have advised, even a very obstinate case of asthma should\r\nbe cured. _See_ Appendix; Bathing the Feet; Rubbing; Soap; Soapy\r\nBlanket.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack Failures.--Often a severe pain in the toe, foot, ankle, or lower\r\nleg has its cause, not in anything wrong with the part which is\r\npainful, but in some failure of nerve in the patient's _back_.\r\nBlistering or other treatment of the painful part will often injure,\r\nand cannot do much, in any case, to cure. Pains even in the knee and\r\ngroin sometimes have the same cause--in back failure. In other cases\r\nthe symptoms are, weariness, stiffness, inability to stoop, or stand\r\nlong without support, and pains in the stomach and thighs.\r\n\r\nA little thought will enable any one to distinguish between pains due\r\nto back failure and those due to local causes. If there is no\r\nappearance of anything wrong at the part pained, then the evil is\r\nprobably in the back. It is even a good rule to consider the pain at\r\nfirst as due to back failure rather than local causes, for by treatment\r\nof the back the local trouble, when that is present, is much helped and\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nIn the case of pains in the arms or hands, the _upper_ part of the back\r\nis indicated; in leg and foot troubles, the _lower_ part. Neuralgic\r\npains are almost always of this class.\r\n\r\nIn any case of this kind, heat may be applied to the spine, and rubbing\r\nwith hot oil given to it, at its upper or lower part as required. If\r\nthe heat and rubbing increase the pain, then cold applications may be\r\nused. Sometimes heat and cold may be needed alternately; but common\r\nsense must guide, and all irritation or chilling of the patient must be\r\ncarefully avoided.\r\n\r\nThe best manner of applying cold to the spine is described in article\r\non Angina Pectoris. Towels are folded as there directed. The moist one\r\n(well wrung out) is placed next the spine, either over the part desired\r\nor the whole spine. The dry one is placed over this, and the patient\r\nlies down on his back on the top of them; or, if he cannot lie, as\r\nsometimes happens, the towels are gently pressed with the hand against\r\nthe spine until sufficient cooling has resulted. The patient should\r\nnever be made to shiver. If he feels chilly, hot fomentations to the\r\nfeet and legs, as described in article on Angina Pectoris, may be\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalance, Loss of.--Cases where loss of balance in walking and standing\r\nare due to St. Vitus' Dance will be treated under that head. Other\r\ncases, where loss of power in the motor nerves causes this\r\nunsteadiness, are treated of here. As these cases differ totally from\r\nSt. Vitus' Dance in cause and treatment, it is well carefully to\r\ndistinguish between them. In St. Vitus' Dance, then, notice that the\r\npatient cannot lie still. In case of simple loss of power, he staggers\r\nor falls only when moving, or trying to move. Probably also in the last\r\ncase there are cold feet and clammy skin. For this, bathe the feet at\r\nbedtime in hot water, dry, and rub them with hot oil. Then apply to the\r\nback on going to bed a warm cloth, covered with soap lather (_see_\r\nLather), with dry towel above it. Do this each night for a week. When\r\ntaking off the cloth, sponge the back with warm vinegar or weak acid\r\n(_see_ Acetic Acid), and rub with warm olive oil.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of this treatment, apply each night for two or three days,\r\na large BRAN POULTICE (_see_) across the loins for an hour at bedtime,\r\nwith olive oil before and after. Above all, conscientiously let the\r\npatient _rest_. A good deal of lying in bed and on a sofa must be\r\ntaken, and good nourishment given (_see_ Assimilation, etc.). Some\r\nweeks of alternate treatment like this should effect a great\r\nimprovement, if not a radical cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalance of Action--_See_ Action, Balance of.\r\n\r\n\r\nBand, Flannel.--A piece of fine new flannel made to cover the whole\r\nback, and sewed under the usual underclothing, has a truly wonderful\r\neffect when worn in certain cases of illness. The same effect is not\r\nproduced by doubling the flannels that are worn. What we have specially\r\nto call attention to is the fact that the piece is extra to all that\r\nwhich covers the rest of the body. The heat of the back, which is so\r\nvery important from the nerve structure of the spinal system, is made\r\nto gather under a single ply of flannel, but much more quickly under\r\ntwo folds of the same material. When, therefore, there is anything like\r\nnatural heat in the back, this piece of new flannel makes it gather\r\nquickly, and keeps it stimulating the parts to which it is confined.\r\nThen, if the front of the body is more thinly clad, it is very much the\r\nsame as when a hot bag or a bran poultice is applied to the back, and a\r\ncold cloth in front. The effect is not so immediate, but in the course\r\nof time it gets to be even greater. We have never been able to see much\r\ncome of \"magnetic\" or \"electric\" belts other than would result from\r\nwearing the woollen material they are covered with; but we have seen\r\nconstantly all the good effects ascribed to the most costly appliances\r\nproduced by a bit of new flannel. If there can be a good rubbing given\r\nwith olive oil, and then the extra flannel put on, the effect is\r\ndelightful. Again, when the skin has been cleansed effectually with the\r\nmixture for NIGHT SWEATS (_see_), put the flannel on. It causes a\r\ngathering of heat, which stimulates the spinal nerves, and produces\r\ngood effects all over the body and limbs.\r\n\r\nA broad band of extra new flannel round the lower half of the body is\r\nsomewhat equivalent to fomentation got in the armchair, or in the hot\r\npack of the lower body. Those who are exposed, as coachmen are, and\r\nsubject to lumbago and other troubles, will find a flannel band work\r\nwonders. This flannel band on the lower back is valuable in cases of\r\nrheumatism, sciatica, and various kidney troubles. On the upper back it\r\nis good for bronchitis and some forms of asthma.\r\n\r\nIt may be used in connection with the other forms of treatment given\r\nfor these in separate articles. When linen underwear is worn, this band\r\nshould be worn under that, next the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nBandage, Four-ply Flannel.--The four-ply flannel bandage is simply what\r\nits name implies--a bandage of the shape and size to cover the parts\r\ntreated, and at least four-ply thick. It is wrung out of cold water,\r\nand covered with a thick dry bandage while applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nBandaging.--_See_ Veins, Swollen, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarley.--If this grain is well grown and thoroughly well cooked, it\r\nwill be found to be one of the best foods for restoring an exhausted\r\ndigestive system.\r\n\r\nTake two or three handfuls of \"pot\" barley; boil this in water for two\r\nhours at least, thoroughly to burst the grain; then water and grain\r\ntogether are turned into a suitable dish, and placed, covered over, in\r\nthe oven, where it may simmer for another two hours. When turned out,\r\nit may be salted to taste. After the four hours' cooking, the grain and\r\nwater are a kind of barley pudding. A dessertspoonful of this every\r\nhalf-hour, from eight in the morning till eight at night, will help\r\nwonderfully a weak stomach, if taken as the _only diet_. This is what\r\nis meant when \"barley pudding\" is prescribed in these articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nBathing.--Cold baths, while greatly to be recommended to those who are\r\nstrong, should not be taken by any one who does not feel invigorated by\r\nthem. As every one should, if possible, bathe daily, the following\r\nmethod is worth knowing, as it combines all the advantages of hot and\r\ncold bathing. The principle is the same as explained in Cooling in\r\nHeating. Sponge all over with hot water and wash with M'Clinton's soap;\r\nthen sponge all over with cold water. No chilliness will then be felt.\r\nVery weak persons may use tepid instead of cold water. These baths\r\ntaken every morning will greatly tend to prevent the person catching\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nCold bathing in water which is _hard_ is a mistake, especially in\r\nbathing of infants. The skin under its influence becomes hard and dry.\r\nWarm bathing and M'Clinton's soap will remedy this.\r\n\r\n\r\nBathing the Feet.--This apparently simple treatment, if the best\r\nresults are desired, must be gone about most carefully. A foot-bath for\r\nten or twenty minutes, though a considerable help in many cases, is not\r\nat all sufficient. It must be given, in most cases, for forty minutes\r\nto give sensible relief. Some patients faint long before this time if\r\nthe feet are placed in very hot water from the beginning. To avoid this\r\nfaintness, proceed as follows: Get a vessel that will hold the feet\r\neasily, and be deep enough to reach nearly up to the knees. Put water\r\nin this one inch deep, and at blood heat--that is, just to feel warm to\r\nan ordinary hand. Set the feet to be bathed in this, and have plenty of\r\nhot water at hand. Let the patient be comfortably covered and seated,\r\nand wait two minutes or so. Add then a little hotter water, and every\r\ntwo minutes add a little more water, hotter every time, gradually\r\nincreasing the quantity and temperature of the water. In half an hour a\r\ngood strong heat and large deep bath will be reached, and in only a\r\nvery few cases will there be any faintness. If the heat is raised too\r\nfast, give a little cold water to drink, and proceed more slowly. This\r\nis in cases where simple stimulus to vital action is required.\r\n\r\nIf the bathing be for sores, or disease of joints, the sores should be\r\ndressed first with cold cream or vaseline, or covered with a cloth\r\ndipped in olive oil. If the skin becomes irritated from prolonged\r\nbathing, cover before bathing with a cloth dipped in weak vinegar or\r\nvery weak ACETIC ACID (_see_). If the patient is too weak for bathing,\r\na fomentation may be applied as described in article on Angina\r\nPectoris, only extending, however, over the knees. Such fomentation may\r\nalso be used whenever cold cloths applied to a diseased or inflamed\r\npart tend to cause a chill. It will quite prevent this.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaths for Head.--In many cases of indigestion and brain exhaustion\r\nhead-baths are of great value. School teachers, business men, and many\r\nothers suffering from these, will find a daily head-bath half an hour\r\nbefore dinner of the greatest value. This treatment should be given,\r\nhowever, only to those who are vigorous enough to bear it. Some are too\r\nexhausted, and for these other methods must be employed. The head-bath\r\nis given by rubbing the whole head well with soap lather (_see_ Lather;\r\nSoap); then wash off and treat with cold water poured over the head for\r\na short time--a few seconds only; then rub vigorously with a dry, warm\r\ntowel till the head glows with friction. In the case of ladies, the\r\nhair may be thrown over the front of the head while the back of the\r\nhead is treated thus, and then thrown back while the front of the head\r\nis treated also, the bulk of the hair being thus kept dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBedsores.--There are cases in which the outer skin has been taken off\r\nby long lying, or wearing wet compresses for a long time. A large part\r\nof the body is reduced, as some would say, to \"red flesh\"--in reality\r\nit is reduced to inner skin deprived of its outer layer. We have taken\r\na few handfuls of finely wrought soap lather (_see_ Lather; Soap), and\r\nspread them as lightly as possible over this fiery surface. There was\r\nan instant change from severe distress to perfect comfort, and healing\r\nbegan at once. This treatment may be applied to any simple abrasions of\r\nthe skin. Bedsores are not likely to occur if the skin is sponged daily\r\nwith water and this mild soap, and rubbed with Rectified Spirit of\r\nWine, to which a small piece of camphor has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeef Tea.--It is well to bear in mind that there is scarcely any\r\nnourishment even in home-made beef juice (the best form of any extract\r\nof meat).\r\n\r\nHome-made beef juice is prepared by scraping the meat into shreds,\r\nplacing in a jar, and leaving the water to soak into the meat for about\r\nhalf-an-hour. Then place in a saucepan on the fire for an hour, during\r\nwhich time it must not boil. After being then brought to the boil, it\r\nshould be removed immediately, and the lump of meat removed.\r\n\r\nSome idea may be obtained of the relatively small amount of nourishment\r\neven in this form of extract when it is remembered that the thin flaky\r\nmatter which sinks to the bottom in the bowl is practically the only\r\nnutritive portion in the dish.\r\n\r\nAll extracts and such-like preparations are inferior to home-made beef\r\ntea in value. We do not deny, then, the value of beef extracts as\r\nstimulants in certain diseased conditions, but we do not recognise them\r\nas a useful food. Further, the stimulating effect upon the heart is\r\nlargely due to the hot water they are made with (_see_ Bone Diseased).\r\n\r\n\r\nBile, Black.--For this take two tablespoonfuls of hot water every five\r\nminutes for six hours per day. A good many cases, some even given up by\r\nthe doctors, have been cured by this simple, yet efficient means.\r\n\r\n\r\nBile on the Stomach.--Take half a teacupful of hot water every ten\r\nminutes for ten hours. Next day take the same every twenty minutes for\r\na like period. The third day the same every hour. For ten days after\r\ntake the same before each meal. We have seen a case of liver complaint\r\nof more than twenty years' standing cured thus. See also that the feet\r\nand legs are rendered healthful, and kept so. If cold and clammy, they\r\nshould be bathed in hot water for five minutes or so, dried, and rubbed\r\nwith warm olive oil.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken also to give a simple diet. Oatmeal jelly, wheaten\r\nmeal porridge, barley pudding (_see_ Barley), and such foods, should\r\nform the staple nourishment. Avoid eggs, butter, cream, and beef. _See\r\nalso_ Sea-Sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiscuits and Water.--The biscuits referred to are manufactured in\r\nSaltcoats.[A] They are made from the purest whole wheaten flour. The\r\nlate Mr. Bryden, of the Saltcoats Home, used them along with hot water\r\nas sole diet in many serious digestive troubles, with marvellous\r\nsuccess. Where no food will lie on the stomach, one small, or half a\r\nlarge, biscuit is to be taken three times a day, as a meal, and at\r\nmeal-times. This will prove amply sufficient to maintain the system in\r\nsuch a case, until the stomach gains power for more. In the case of\r\nSORES and ABSCESSES (_see_), such a diet of biscuits and water provides\r\npure blood, and makes healing by other treatment very much easier. We\r\nhave known limbs saved from amputation largely by such diet. It will\r\nsuit equally well the delicate young lady and the strong labourer. Too\r\nmuch of ordinary food goes to increase ulceration and nourish disease.\r\nThe Saltcoats biscuit provides nothing for these ends, and is of\r\nimmense value as an aid to cure. One great advantage of this diet is\r\nthat it is a _dry_ one, and the biscuits _must_ be thoroughly chewed to\r\nenable them to be swallowed at all. The saliva is thereby thoroughly\r\nmixed with the food, which is all-important to make it digestible.\r\nThese biscuits are also so plain as not to tempt the patient to eat\r\nmore than he can digest, which is the great danger in sickness. The\r\nslops of gruel and cornflour so often given are never chewed at all,\r\nand often do nothing but harm. Such starchy foods really require to be\r\nmore thoroughly mixed with saliva than any other food, as unless, by\r\naction of the saliva, the starch is converted into sugar it cannot be\r\nassimilated in the stomach.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: By Mr. R. Black, baker.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBleeding.--In any case of this pack the feet and legs as directed in\r\nLungs, Bleeding from, and press cold cloths to the place the blood\r\ncomes from, stomach, womb (_see_ Miscarriage), or lungs. If it comes\r\nfrom the nose, apply the cold cloths to the head and back of the neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlisters.--The destruction of the skin over any painful part, by means\r\nof blisters, is to be always avoided if possible (_see_ Burns, Knee,\r\nPleurisy, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBlood.--A most common trouble is anæmia, a lack of good red blood,\r\nshowing itself in a waxy paleness and whiteness of lips, often\r\naccompanied by exhaustion and great fatigue. To remedy this, first\r\nsecure a supply of pure water, of which 80 per cent. of the blood is\r\nmade up. Give this warm in dessertspoonfuls every five minutes. Give\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls, or perhaps only one, of very light food, or milk\r\nand boiling water half and half, every half-hour. This may be done in\r\nsmaller portions every fifteen minutes, or in larger quantities every\r\nhour or two hours, according to the state of the digestion. Fruit is a\r\nvaluable means of quenching the anæmia thirst, besides being very\r\nbeneficial for the blood. Green vegetables and salads are also most\r\nvaluable (_see_ Vegetables; Assimilation; Diet; Digestion). As much\r\nfresh air as possible is also to be breathed by the patient. Either\r\nmuch time must be spent in the open air, or, if strength forbid this,\r\nthe room must be thoroughly ventilated. Close air is the enemy of good\r\nblood. We know of many cases cured by this simple regimen. Care must\r\nalso be taken to increase the patient's vitality by various means. If\r\n_thoroughly good_ medical advice can be obtained, it should be taken\r\n(_see_ Air and Appetite; Balance, Loss of, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBlood Poisoning.--(_See_ Blood, Purifying; Sores).\r\n\r\n\r\nBlood, Purifying.--Fever arising from bad state of the blood may be\r\ntreated by careful cooling of the spine and head, with towels _well\r\nwrung_ out of cold water, frequently changed (_see_ Fever). The pulse\r\nin one case so treated was reduced from 130 to 96 by a few\r\napplications. If a sore exists, treat it as in article Sores. If an\r\neruption in the skin breaks out, cover the surface at night with soap\r\nlather (_see_ Lather; Soap). Wipe that off with weak acetic acid\r\n(_see_) in the morning, and the skin will come right. Let the diet be\r\nsimple and cooling (_see_ Abscess; Assimilation; Skin; Sores; Appendix,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nBlood, Supply of.--To supply good blood in cases where it is lacking,\r\neither from indigestion or low vitality, nothing is better than milk,\r\ndiluted with an equal quantity of _boiling water_. It may be less or\r\nmore diluted, as the patient's power of digestion is greater or less,\r\nbut in all cases half and half can be tried first. This forms a natural\r\nblood supply. Claret, switched egg and brandy, are to be carefully\r\navoided. _Boiling_ water amalgamates with the milk, and care therefore\r\nmust be taken to see that it is really boiling. Give a teacupful of\r\nthis every two hours. If the patient is very weak, this may be the only\r\ndiet. But often he will be going about work or business, and yet\r\nneeding fresh, good blood supply. Then the cupful may be taken every\r\ntwo hours, in addition to the usual meals. Experience will soon show\r\nhow this may be done. But two hours after a meal, the milk and water\r\nmay be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoils.--The following treatment will be found effective to heal less\r\nsevere forms of boils, by soothing the whole fevered system of nerves,\r\nand stimulating the skin in its getting rid of waste material.\r\n\r\nBegin, then, by thoroughly soaping the head (_see_ Head, Soaping). Go\r\nto the back next, and soap similarly. The same process may, if desired,\r\nbe carried over the whole body to the very tips of the fingers and\r\ntoes. In a delicate case, do this in portions so as not to run any risk\r\nof exposing the patient too much.\r\n\r\nLay on the boil, after the soaping, and while the patient is under its\r\nsoothing influence, a large piece of thickly folded flannel, or a small\r\nsponge, squeezed out of water as hot as the patient can bear. Continue\r\nthis, with frequent re-heating of the application for a\r\nquarter-of-an-hour, then allow the patient to rest.\r\n\r\nWhen you have soaped a patient as we have described, say twice, it is\r\nnecessary to wash off the particles that may remain on the skin with\r\nwhite vinegar or weak acetic acid. Then, if you have overcooled with\r\nthe soap and acid, it will be well to rub over with warm oil. By these\r\nsimple methods of treatment you will banish all tendency to boils. You\r\nwill change great suffering into comparative comfort, not only without\r\nexpenditure of strength, but in a way in which you add vigour to the\r\nwhole frame. One very great advantage of this treatment is that you do\r\nnot need to move the patient in any distressing way. If you have only\r\ntact and gentleness of touch, you can do all that we have described\r\nwithout causing one moment's distress. The severe form of boil known as\r\n_Carbuncle_ is very dangerous, and in such cases good surgical aid is\r\nnecessary, in addition to above treatment (_see_ Diet).\r\n\r\n\r\nBone, Diseased.--Diseased bone is not incurable. Bone is indeed\r\nconstantly being replaced as it disappears in the ordinary waste of the\r\nbody. Defective vitality in any part may cause an accumulation of bad\r\nmaterial, which forms the basis of bone disease.\r\n\r\nTo cut off a diseased foot or ankle is easy, and soon done. To cure it,\r\nmay take a long time and much patience, but is worth a great deal. We\r\nknow large numbers of limbs that are sound and good now, that were\r\ndoomed once to be amputated, but which we were able to rescue in time.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a very short time of well-regulated fomentation improves the\r\ngeneral health, and prevents the diseased material spreading from the\r\nfoot or ankle through the body.\r\n\r\nTake, then, a case in which the ankle bone has first become painful,\r\nperhaps without any perceptible cause, or it may be as the result of an\r\ninjury to the part. It then swells and becomes inflamed. At this stage\r\ntwo or three fomentations (_see_) well applied may very likely cure it\r\nentirely. But if neglected, or leeched, blistered, and the skin spoiled\r\nwith iodine, what is called disease of the bone may set in, accompanied\r\nwith discharge of matter at one or more places on the ankle. This\r\ndischarge, where it is evidently lodging in the limb, may be assisted\r\nto escape by careful lancing by a good surgeon. For such a case,\r\nfomentation of as much of the limb as possible is the treatment. Let a\r\nbath be procured, in which the limb may be immersed in hot water as\r\ndeeply as possible, even up to the very thigh. Let the water at first\r\nbe comfortably warm. Increase its temperature gradually until as hot as\r\ncan be borne without pain. Keep the limb in this bath for an hour, or\r\nfor such shorter period as the patient may be able to bear it. Gently\r\ndry, and rub all over with warm olive oil. Wipe this gently off, and\r\ncover the limb with clothing. Then syringe any sores with weak acid\r\n(_see_ Acetic Acid; Wounds), and dress with bandage (_see_ Ankle,\r\nTwisted). Do this twice each day, and persevere.\r\n\r\nIf it cannot well be bathed, let it be fomented by a large piece of\r\nflannel soaked with boiling water, and placed round the diseased part.\r\nWe have seen a wasting bone healed entirely in a few weeks by this\r\nmeans. We have seen a man with the bones of both his legs splintering\r\noff and coming through the skin perfectly healed in a few months. It\r\nstands to reason that it should be so. The bathing in his case, like\r\nthe fomenting in others, were so effectually done that the bones\r\nthemselves were heated, and strong healing action set in at once. We\r\nsaw lately a piece of dead bone above four inches long come out of a\r\nyoung man's arm as the result of nothing else but fomentation. The arm\r\nwas soon as whole and as useful as could be desired, though it had been\r\nto all appearance only fit to be taken off at the elbow. The steady\r\nsupply of moist heat does wonders in this way.\r\n\r\nWe have seen some most remarkable specimens of what was erroneously\r\nthought sufficient fomentation. One was a case of diseased thigh-bone.\r\nA bit of old flannel, about a quarter of a yard square, had been wrung\r\nout of water slightly tepid and laid on the skin, covered by a little\r\ncloth scarcely equal in size. The application would not have conveyed\r\nactivity to the skin on which it was laid, though it required to convey\r\nit to the heart of a large mass of bone. The helpless complaint of the\r\noperator was that it did no good. How in the world could it do good?\r\nNot less than six or seven or even eight yards of a blanket are\r\nrequired. That is to be folded and rolled up so that a good quantity of\r\nboiling water may be poured first into one end of it and then into the\r\nother. It has to be squeezed and kneaded till the heated water and\r\nsteam are fairly soaking the inside of the blanket. When this is opened\r\nup, it is far too hot to put to the skin, but a double flannel or\r\nstrong towel may be put on first, so that the heat shall go gradually\r\nthrough to the body, and by-and-by into the bone. This may be done at\r\nleast once a day--if agreeable, it may be done twice. But it must be so\r\nwell done that the heat shall effect the bone, or you cannot look for\r\nany result of importance.\r\n\r\nIf under the bathing the skin becomes irritated, as it will often do,\r\ncover it with cloths soaked in _weak_ vinegar till the bathing is over.\r\nIf the skin suffers from the fomentation, do the same thing, and if\r\nthis does not cure, dress it, before putting on the fomentation\r\nflannels, with SOAP (_see_) lather as if for shaving, spread like\r\nbutter on a cloth, and made to shelter the skin from irritation till\r\nthe fomenting is done. This is of great importance in many cases; the\r\nskin is often so sensitive that it cannot well be bathed without being\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Preparing Blanket for Fomentation.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of hip-joint disease, the ARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_) is\r\nthe best form of fomenting. For other parts, common sense will guide\r\nhow to produce an extensive and thorough heating of the diseased part\r\nand its neighbourhood by some similar means (_see_ Bathing the Feet;\r\nPains, etc.). It is only heating the failed tissues, only keeping on\r\nsuch heating, and all the elements of perfect cure are supplied. Even\r\nlimbs which have shrunk and become shorter, grow out to their natural\r\nsize under this patient heating.\r\n\r\nGet \"steel drops\" and all such-like sent down the sewer. The rats may\r\nhave them if they are disposed. Give wheaten or oatmeal porridge, bread\r\nor Saltcoats biscuits, with good buttermilk, and the poor creature,\r\nhalf dead with poisonous \"drops,\" begins ere long to have red on his\r\nlips and on his cheeks, some fresh vigour in his muscles, and healthy\r\nbone in the course of formation, where bone was only wasting before.\r\nHow is this explained? On the simple principle that the bodily system\r\ncan turn wheaten meal into all the elements wanted for good bodily\r\nhealth. Beef tea, soups, \"fine things\" of all descriptions, never on\r\nearth gave human beings solid strength, but in myriads of cases they\r\nhave been successfully employed to take it away. Above all, they fail\r\nto give healthy bone.\r\n\r\nGet the patient to take wheaten or oaten meal porridge twice a day at\r\nleast. We are not so stern as some in forbidding all else, though in\r\nthis we may fall short; but by all means let eating and drinking be\r\nconsidered in the light of what we have been writing (_see_ Food in\r\nHealth).\r\n\r\nGood air is important in this, as in all cases of ill-health.\r\n\r\nMuch depends, in this treatment, on cheerfulness of mind. Let the\r\npatient feel that he is going to be cured. Avoid opium, tobacco,\r\nalcoholic drinks, and all worry. This will actually increase the vital\r\nexchange in the body and very much help the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBone, Soft.--Often, in the young, the bones are so soft that they bend\r\nmore or less, and the beginning of a distressing deformity appears.\r\n\r\nIn such a case plaster jackets and steel bands are of little use, and\r\noften very painful. It is better to use bandages, applied so as to\r\nsupport where that is necessary. Also avoid all long sitting, such as\r\nis found at school. It is best sometimes not to permit the child to\r\nwalk at all. Better far to lose two years of schooling than to be\r\ndeformed for life. Parents should see to it, with all weakly children,\r\nthat school does not become a means of trouble. Continuous education is\r\nnot nearly so important as is sometimes supposed.\r\n\r\nFor positive treatment, let the parts be well and carefully rubbed\r\n(_see_ Massage) every day with olive oil, in such a way as to direct a\r\nflow of blood to the feeble bone. It must largely be left to the\r\nhealer's common sense how this is to be done, but a little thought will\r\nshow how. At many Hydropathic Establishments it may be learned.\r\n\r\nThis careful rubbing, with good diet and proper bandaging, will\r\ngradually effect a cure in most cases. But here, as elsewhere, patience\r\nmust rule. Plenty of good porridge and milk, with abundance of fresh\r\nair, work wonders in this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nBowels, Glands of.--Symptoms of glandular trouble in the bowels\r\nare--weariness and pallor, lack of appetite, softness and shrinking of\r\nlimbs, with swelling of the belly. In its earlier stages, before\r\nconsumption sets in, this trouble may be perfectly cured. We have seen\r\neven apparently hopeless cases recover under proper treatment. In its\r\nessence the trouble is a failure of power in the nervous centres upon\r\nwhich health of the bowels depends. To supply this needed power, take a\r\nsmall bag of cotton cloth, like a little pillow-slip, of just the size\r\nto cover the patient's whole back. Fill this with bran, prepared as for\r\npoultice (_see_ Bran Poultice). Oil the back before applying this, and\r\nplace, if needed, four ply or so of cloth on the back to moderate the\r\nheat to the skin. After half-an-hour, if the patient feels desirous,\r\nrenew for another hour; do this each day at bedtime for a week at\r\nleast. Rub the body all over with warm olive oil when this is taken\r\noff; then place a bandage with only a gentle tightness in such a way as\r\njust to help the relaxed bowels, but only just so much--not by any\r\nmeans to try and force them into what might be thought proper\r\ndimensions. Give a teaspoonful of liquorice mixture (_see_\r\nConstipation) thrice a day before meals in a little hot water. Feed on\r\nwheaten porridge and generally light diet, being careful to regulate it\r\nso as to make the bowels work easily and naturally. If not too bad a\r\ncase, this treatment will soon tell favourably. Enemas (_see_) of\r\neither cold or warm water, as required, will also greatly help.\r\n\r\n\r\nBowels, Inflammation of.--This (called medically Peritonitis) is an\r\ninflammation of the membrane covering the bowels. It results from chill\r\nor strain, and sometimes, in the case of child-birth, from dirt\r\nintroduced into the parts by handling with unwashed hands. In such\r\ncases, the utmost care must be taken to ensure cleanliness, which will\r\nsecure against one fertile cause of the disease. The hands should be\r\nalways fresh and clean, and all cloths, etc., should be either most\r\ncarefully washed or burnt. Where the trouble arises from strain, or\r\nchill, these lower the vitality, and the membrane becomes gorged with\r\nblood at fever heat. To regulate this heat, then, and free the membrane\r\nfrom the blood which over-fills it, is to lead to a cure. Rub the back\r\nwith warm olive oil, place on it a large BRAN POULTICE (_see_), or an\r\nindia-rubber bag of hot water covered with _moist_ flannel; this must\r\nin either case be large enough to cover the entire lower back. Anything\r\nmay be used, if these cannot be had, which will powerfully stimulate\r\nthe back with moist heat. Wring a small thin towel out of cold water,\r\nand place it over the bowels. At first this must be _very gently_ laid\r\non. After a little, and when several times freshly applied, this cold\r\ncloth may be very gently pressed all over the bowels. Relief will\r\nalmost certainly come ere this has been done for an hour. Then a rest\r\nmay be given for two hours, and after that a large fomentation applied\r\nto feet and legs (_see_ Fomentation). While this is on, the cold cloths\r\nmay be changed over the bowels again, and over the chest as well. After\r\nan hour of this, great relief should be felt. If there is great thirst\r\na small bit of ice may be sucked, or a few drops of vinegar in water\r\nmay be taken; but the outside cooling will probably render this\r\nunnecessary. Avoid all alcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\nShivering and a feeling of cold is often the earliest symptom, and as\r\nit is of immense importance that warming measures should be promptly\r\napplied. Hot bricks, or bottles, placed merely to the soles of the\r\nfeet, are but poor helps: it would be vastly better to pack the feet\r\nand legs in a hot blanket fomentation at once, and, if pain at all\r\nshows itself, to apply a large fomentation to the lower part of the\r\nback. The sooner this is done the better; besides, there is the\r\nconsolation that the treatment can never do any harm even if applied in\r\na case in which there has occurred a harmless chill. The dread which\r\nsome medical men have of cold applications is wonderful, but we know\r\nthat the front-rank men have no such fear. When care is taken to have\r\nthe hot application on first, there is, and can be, no possible danger\r\nin any case in cooling down the burning circulation. One or two\r\napplications have sufficed in many cases we have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBowels, Lax.--A teaspoonful of lemon juice (freshly expressed), along\r\nwith hot water and sugar, will often relieve where the bowels are\r\nacting excessively. For infants in diarrhoea a mixture of honey and\r\nlemon juice is an excellent cure, and has been most successful in our\r\nexperience. Avoid brandy and alcohol generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nBowels, Locking of.--Sometimes when one part of the bowels is much more\r\nactive than another, it passes into that other, and they become\r\n_locked_, like a stocking half turned inside out. This causes dreadful\r\npain, and if not soon relieved is fatal. Purgatives are of no use, and\r\nusually make matters worse. A surgical operation in very skilful hands\r\nwill relieve, and must be quickly performed when necessary.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which the one part of the bowels has not yet gone far into\r\nthe other, nothing more is required than a cold cloth gently pressed\r\nover the parts. We have seen relief set in on the fifth or sixth change\r\nof such a cloth, when nothing else was used whatever. When a hot bag,\r\nor bran poultice, has been put on the back, and cold cloths\r\npersistently changed over the bowels, the whole matter has been put to\r\nrights, and natural motion of the bowels has been had within an hour\r\nafter the applications have been begun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior of small intestine.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a stronger measure than merely heating the back and\r\ncooling the front in this way. The patient may be put at once into a\r\nsitting bath or small tub, and a panful of cold water poured or dashed\r\non to the bowels; they then contract so powerfully, and shorten\r\nthemselves so much, that all invagination, as it is called, is made to\r\ncease instantly. We should be disposed to try the mildest method in the\r\nfirst instance, unless the case is one in which the lock in the bowels\r\nhad just taken place. Then it might be well to dash the pailful of\r\nwater on so as to put all right at once, and afterwards simply to apply\r\nsuch remedies as would tend to prevent a recurrence of the evil.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, usually the case that the distress has lasted some time\r\nbefore an opportunity of doing anything occurs, inflammation, more or\r\nless, has set in, weeks may have passed, and blundering treatment may\r\nhave done great mischief. Then it is safe to use the heat at the back,\r\nand frequently changed cold cloths in front, so as to reduce the\r\ninflammation, and contract the bowels more slowly, so as to remove the\r\nobstruction. When these have been used for some time, if the\r\nobstruction is not removed it will be well to resort to the stronger\r\nmeasures. Nothing is more beautifully simple than the ordinary action\r\nof the bowels. The healthful movement is like that by which an\r\nearth-worm moves along the ground: so long as the tube is thus moving\r\nits contents onward, by contraction and expansion, no part can pass\r\ninside or outside that which is before it; but when one part loses\r\nnervous tension, and expands without contracting quickly enough, the\r\npart behind it tends to worm itself into it, and a \"knot,\" as it is\r\nsometimes called, is formed. No possible instrument can reach it except\r\nby cutting the body outright, but the action of cold is so powerful in\r\ncontracting the tube that the \"loop,\" as it is also called, is drawn\r\nout, and the right state of things is produced. It is important to\r\nremark that there are glands near the lower bowel that swell and form\r\ntumours. The cold applications reduce these very speedily to their\r\nusual size, and if their swelling is an obstruction, it is soon\r\nremoved. But it is the lock in the tube itself that is the real malady\r\nof which so many die, and with which so many more narrowly escape.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is best avoided by attention to the regular action of the\r\nbowels. It arises from great irregularity in that action.\r\n\r\n\r\nBowels, Reversed.--_See_ Bowels, Locking of, above.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrain Exercise.--Proper exercise for the brain is most important. But\r\nthis is not to be found in that kind of severe mental labour which is\r\nsometimes mistaken for it. Children at play have genuine brain\r\nexercise. So has a man at what is called a \"hobby,\" such as\r\nphotography, golf, or cycling. The child at school, the man in his\r\noffice, are not at exercise, but at wearing work. This distinction is\r\nmost important. Exercise, again, is not found in careless dreaming, but\r\nin some form of \"play\" which calls for steady, but almost unconscious,\r\nand altogether enjoyable thinking. Books sometimes furnish this, when\r\nthey lift the mind as far as possible out of its usual track, and\r\nproduce only pleasant thoughts. Tragedies, novels which end miserably,\r\nor which are pessimistic, should all be avoided. Perhaps some easy\r\nscience or art is the best exercise of all, when the brain is suffering\r\nfrom overstrain. But taste will guide in this. The great matter is to\r\nhave pleasurable, easy, and natural employment for the brain. This and\r\nnot work is strengthening \"exercise,\" whether in child or man. So far\r\nas we can we should see that the weary get it. For he who procures this\r\nfor his fellow works immense good.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, for instance, a student attacked with dysentery while in\r\nthe hardest part of the session at the university. His whole system\r\nbecame prostrate, and muscular activity to a very small degree would\r\nhave killed him; so would the continued mental toil necessary to go on\r\nwith his studies. Yet his brain was in need of exercise almost from the\r\nfirst appearance of his disease. He must have this or be miserable, and\r\nnot likely soon to recover. An intensely interesting book fell into his\r\nhands, altogether away from his track of toil. He read day after day at\r\nthis book. This was his \"exercise\"--that is, it was the activity of\r\nthat one only part of his physical system which needed such exercise\r\nfor the time. That exercise allowed all the other organs to recuperate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrain, Inflammation of.--This arises often from over-schooling of young\r\nboys and girls. Care should ever be taken to avoid this. Obstinate\r\nconstipation in the bowels, chills and exposure, are also fruitful\r\nsources. Much worry and anxiety also bring on this serious illness. All\r\nsometimes combine to produce a bad case. Pain in the head sets in,\r\nfollowed by convulsive attacks; yet the trouble may be cured in many\r\ncases with comparative ease. Leeches, opium, and blistering are to be\r\navoided as most injurious. For treatment it is well to begin at the\r\nfeet; if these are clammy and cold, wrap in hot fomentation up over the\r\nknees (_see_ Fomentation). Proceed to give a pretty warm injection of\r\nwater into the lower bowel (_see_ Enemas). This should be repeated\r\nseveral times, allowing it to pass off each time. If this increases the\r\npain, try an injection of cold water. This treatment of feet and bowels\r\nis most important, and should never be neglected; it renders the\r\ntreatment of the head tenfold more effective. Cold cloths may now be\r\ngently pressed for some time over the head. If the pulse is violent and\r\nfeverish, let several towels be well wrung out of cold or even iced\r\nwater, fold one so as to cover the entire head and back of the neck,\r\nand have the others ready, similarly folded. Press the first on gently,\r\nespecially at the back of the head, so that the cooling cloth covers\r\nthe head all over and soothes the violently heated brain. As soon as\r\none towel grows warm, take a fresh cold one. Relief should come in an\r\nhour at least, but longer may be required. During the cooling see that\r\nthe heat of the fomentation on the legs is well kept up; change if\r\nnecessary. When the more painful symptoms abate, oil the lower part of\r\nthe back, and place on it a bran poultice (as recommended in Bowels,\r\nInflammation of). This will go far to prevent any relapse. If the\r\nsymptoms recur, use the treatment again. _See_ Brow, Weary; Eyes,\r\nFailing Sight. _See also_, for other brain troubles: Restlessness;\r\nSleeplessness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrain Rest.--The need for this is often indicated by irritability of\r\ntemper. This coming on is generally a warning that a period of rest\r\nmust be taken. An overheated brow is also another indication. If this\r\nshows itself in a child during or after school, together with\r\nlistlessness and excitability, all idea of lessons should at once be\r\nlaid aside for a time. It is nothing less than cruelty to work an\r\noverheated brain in such a case. Let the child go free from school till\r\nall the head trouble is removed. Also let the head be soaped (_see_\r\nHead, Soaping).\r\n\r\nSometimes pain in the head sets in from overwork. Even in the young,\r\nfainting may show itself. Rest is essential, and will prove a perfect\r\ncure, together with a little brain exercise of the kind described in\r\narticle Brain Exercise, always avoiding fatigue. Let all readers\r\nremember that it is better to lose six months in rest than become\r\npermanently incapable, therefore let old and young take rest in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBran Poultice.--Get a sufficient quantity of good bran in an ordinary\r\nwashhand basin. _Heat_ the basin before beginning operations. Have also\r\na boiling kettle at hand. Pour the boiling water by little and little\r\ninto the bran, and mix and stir it up until it is all a moist mass, but\r\nnot _wet_. The thing is to avoid putting in more water than the bran\r\ncan easily absorb and hold. Then have ready a flannel bag of the size\r\nand shape required for the poultice. Fill this with the bran, and it is\r\nready. The skin to which it is applied should first be oiled with olive\r\noil. The poultice may be fastened on with flannel bands. In any case it\r\nmust lie tightly on the skin. The patient must lie on it, if it be\r\napplied to the back. One or two tablespoonfuls of mustard may be added\r\nif great power is required, not otherwise.\r\n\r\nInstead of this poultice, an india-rubber bag full of hot water may be\r\nused, with two or three ply of moist flannel between it and the skin.\r\nOur only reason for recommending bran is that many could not afford the\r\nindia-rubber bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nBread, Wheaten.--In some cases the bran in whole wheaten bread and\r\nSaltcoats biscuits is found to irritate the stomach and bowels. As diet\r\nfor those able to digest the bran, nothing is better. Where it cannot\r\nbe digested, ordinary bakers' bread boiled in water to soft pap is\r\nfound to make a good substitute. This must not be boiled with milk\r\nunless where there is diarrhoea to be cured, as milk tends to produce\r\nbile and costiveness. Oatmeal jelly (_see_ Food in Illness) is also a\r\ngood substitute for biscuits and wheaten bread.\r\n\r\nOften the water with which bread is baked causes it to be difficult of\r\ndigestion. Hard water is bad for this. For an invalid, bread baked with\r\ndistilled water, or pure rain water, is often a means of great comfort\r\nand help. A slight admixture of pure CANE SYRUP (_see_) or liquorice\r\njuice in the water will tend to prevent bile and costiveness. A\r\nsufficient action of the bowels is of great importance for where good\r\nnutrition is desired.\r\n\r\nBread, especially when fresh, is made much more digestible by slowly\r\ntoasting it in the oven till it is a golden brown throughout. It is\r\nthen known as \"zweibach\" (twice baked). When eaten dry, it requires\r\nconsiderable mastication, and for that reason is much better than soft\r\nbread. It can be also broken up and eaten with hot milk and sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreast with Corded Muscles.--Often a slight hardness shows itself in a\r\nwoman's breast, when the muscular tissue becomes what is called\r\n\"corded.\" It is well, first of all, in all cases of breast trouble to\r\navoid alarming the patient. Great anxiety is often endured through fear\r\nof cancer when there is no need. A \"corded\" breast may usually quite\r\neasily be cured, and the patient should be made perfectly easy in mind\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nTake a good lather of soap (_see_ Lather; Soap). Apply this night and\r\nmorning, gently lathering the breast for some time. After this, each\r\ntime, rub the back well with hot olive oil, so as to produce a thorough\r\nglow of heat all over it. Sometimes the swelling will disperse under\r\nthis treatment. It may, however, grow larger and show a tendency to\r\nbreak. In this case treat as in next article.\r\n\r\nWe shall also probably find, on examining, that the skin was failing to\r\ndo its part well. If rubbed with Cayenne lotion the clean, healthy skin\r\nwill send off much more waste than was allowed to pass through it\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreast, Swelling in.--A blow on the breast, or the drain of nursing a\r\nchild, along with a chill, often produces swelling, sometimes hard and\r\npainful. This, if left uncured, may even develop into an ABSCESS\r\n(_see_). As it sometimes arises from dirt being left on the nipples,\r\nall nursing mothers should be particular about cleanliness, which\r\nitself prevents many ills.\r\n\r\nFor cure, bathe the feet in hot water (_see_ Bathing Feet), rub them\r\nover with warm olive oil, and wear good cotton stockings if in bed. If\r\ngoing about, put a pair of woollen stockings over the cotton ones. Rub\r\nthe back as recommended above, using first a little hot vinegar, then\r\nthe oil. The feet bathing may be every three days, and rubbing the\r\nsame. If the swelling does not yield to this, place the patient\r\ncomfortably in bed. Put a good-sized basin of hot water, which has been\r\nboiled and allowed to cool so far, tightly under the breast, so that it\r\nmay be bathed with a sponge. Do not use too hot water, but just\r\ncomfortably hot. Keep up fresh supplies, and bathe for an hour if\r\npatient can bear it. If she becomes fatigued, lay her down to rest for\r\nfifteen minutes or so, and then continue treatment. No poulticing is\r\nneeded when this is well done. A thorough heating of the whole breast\r\nis what is wanted; rub gently with olive oil, and cover warmly after\r\nbathing (_see_ Cancer).\r\n\r\n\r\nBreast, Sore Nipples on.--Take a little warm vinegar or weak acid\r\n(_see_ Acetic Acid). Bathe the sore nipple with this, _avoiding pain_,\r\nfor about ten minutes. Every two minutes dry, and anoint gently with\r\nwarm olive oil. We have seen _one application_ cure a bad nipple; but\r\napply twice daily as long as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreath and Blood.--Often difficulty of breathing, especially in close\r\nair, mistaken even for asthma, is due simply to the quality of blood\r\nsupplied to the lungs. Sometimes giving up the use of sugar effects a\r\ncure, for sugar produces an excess of carbon in the blood, which\r\nrequires an excess of oxygen in the lungs to purify it. Thus breathing\r\nis difficult, especially where oxygen is deficient in the air breathed.\r\nSometimes the lungs are not strong enough to stand the necessary fresh\r\nair required in such cases, or other troubles may prevent a delicate\r\nperson from exposing themselves. Then it is of importance so to\r\nregulate the diet that less oxygen will do all that is needed in the\r\nlungs. \"Rich\" food, much fatty matter, sugar, and all sweets and\r\nsweetened things, are to be avoided. If this be done, the need for much\r\noxygen disappears, and the patient will have no difficulty of breathing\r\nin suitably ventilated places.\r\n\r\nBut the best treatment is hot oil rubbing along the spine, over the\r\nstomach, and even down the limbs to the ankles. An hour of this every\r\nday will work wonders. Or a large BRAN POULTICE (_see_) may be laid\r\nacross the back for an hour twice a day. Cultivate also all cheerful\r\nthoughts, and banish sad ones as far as possible. Sad thoughts greatly\r\ndiminish nerve power.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreath, and the Heart.--Stout people are usually more or less \"scant of\r\nbreath.\" Accumulations of fatty material, or changing of muscle into\r\nfat, cause this, especially if about the chest and heart. To reduce the\r\nfat, and grow healthy muscle instead, will perfectly cure the\r\ndifficulty of breath. Moderate open-air exercise and simple food, such\r\nas Saltcoats biscuits, oatmeal jelly, and barley puddings will largely\r\nhelp this. Avoid also all alcoholic liquors, the use of which is often\r\n_the sole cause_ of the trouble. Keep the skin active (_see_ Skin).\r\n\r\nThe hot FOMENTATION (_see_) to feet and legs is a truly powerful remedy\r\nfor all lack of force in the system, especially if followed by the\r\nmassage treatment described in MASSAGE (_see_).\r\n\r\n\r\nBreath, Hot.--This may be felt either because the breath is actually\r\nhot, or because the membranes of the tongue and mouth are unusually\r\ntender, and _feel_ the breath hot in consequence when it is not really\r\nso. This latter case is usually accompanied by a sore tongue. To heal\r\nthe tongue, it must be soaked freely with vinegar or weak ACETIC ACID\r\n(_see_), so diluted as to give only a very slight feeling of smarting\r\nafter even prolonged application. Apply it with a good camel's hair\r\nbrush, and brush with a little fine almond or olive oil after the acid.\r\nThe mouth may be rinsed with the acid, but brushing is best.\r\n\r\nBut where real heat is found in the breath, it arises from an\r\noverheated state of the body internally. This frequently arises from\r\nfailure in the stomach to digest properly. If the hot breath arises\r\nfrom this, small drinks of hot water, frequently taken, will usually\r\ncure it. A warm bran poultice, placed on the back at bedtime opposite\r\nthe stomach, will prove a more powerful remedy in addition to the hot\r\nwater. More powerful effect still will be found in such stimulus to the\r\nskin as washing it all over twice a week with vinegar or weak acetic\r\nacid. On other days let the patient be rubbed over with good olive oil,\r\nmixed with enough CAYENNE \"TEA\" (_see_) to cause a slight burning\r\nsensation. Let this also be done twice a week, and twice a week also\r\nwash all over with M'Clinton's soap and hot water. A plain diet of\r\ncourse, should be observed (_see_ Digestion; Dyspepsia; Food; Teeth,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nBreath, and Muscles.--Sometimes difficulty of breathing is due, not to\r\nanything wrong with lungs or windpipe, but to failure in the diaphragm\r\n(or large muscular \"floor\" of the chest), and the other chest muscles,\r\nwhich work the lungs. A feeling of sinking and weakness round the waist\r\nindicates in such a case diaphragm failure. Gentle heat at the small of\r\nthe back, and olive oil rubbing, form treatment for this. For other\r\nchest muscles, give a warm washing each night with SOAP (_see_) over\r\nthe body, and rub, especially the back and chest, with hot olive oil.\r\nYou soon bring the muscles into good trim.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreath, and Nerve.--Difficult breathing, especially in ascending a\r\nhill, is often due simply to the lack of the nerve power by which the\r\nbreathing muscles work. A teacupful of hot water half-an-hour before\r\neach meal, by helping digestion, will often remove the difficulty. Rub\r\neach evening along the spinal cord with hot olive oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreath, and the Skin.--The organs of breathing remove much waste from\r\nthe system, but the skin also removes a very large part. If either\r\nfails, the other has more work thrown upon it, as we see in the severe\r\n\"night sweats\" which accompany chest and lung failure. In such cases,\r\nrub with CAYENNE LOTION (_see_ and Night Sweats). Avoid the use of hard\r\nwater in washing and bathing, especially with infants.\r\n\r\nCold baths for the weakly, chills, damp beds, and such things, cause\r\nrheumatism and colds by stopping the proper discharge of waste by the\r\nskin. After such chill, or cold in damp bed, a hot wash and good hot\r\noil rubbing will avert all evil. This may not always be available; but,\r\nif it can be got at all, should be given as soon as possible. The use\r\nof the soapy blanket is of the utmost value in severe cases (_see_\r\nSoapy Blanket). Strict cleanliness of person and underwear should be\r\nobserved. The AIR BATH (_see_) will also give tone to the skin (_see_\r\nSkin and Underwear).\r\n\r\n\r\nBreathing, and Bronchia.--The _bronchia_ are the branching small tubes\r\nwhich lead from the windpipe to all parts of the lungs. Two different\r\nstates of these often pass as bronchitis. In one of these the tubes are\r\nswelled, congested, and full of fiery heat. The whole body is also\r\nfevered, and breathing is difficult, with cough. This is true\r\nBRONCHITIS (_see_). But often, with difficult breathing and irritating\r\ncough, there is no heat and fever. In this case bronchitis treatment\r\ngives no relief. This is, indeed, only an irritated state of the lining\r\nof the tubes, and far from dangerous. A change of climate to a drier\r\natmosphere will often entirely cure it. Often also a time spent in a\r\nroom, where the air is kept dry but fresh, and at one steady\r\ntemperature of about 60 deg., will cure. Our chief purpose in\r\nmentioning it, however, is that this comparatively slight trouble may\r\nnot be mistaken for true bronchitis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lungs and other internal organs.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBreathing, Correct Method of.--The capacity of an ordinary pair of\r\nlungs is about 250 cubic inches. In ordinary breathing, however, we\r\nonly take in from 20 to 30 cubic inches. Hence the necessity for\r\npractising correct deep breathing.\r\n\r\nCorrect breathing requires cultivation and effort at first, afterwards\r\nit will become unconscious. The head should be thrown back, the\r\nshoulders squared, and a slow deep breath gradually inspired through\r\nthe nose till the lungs are filled throughout with air. The expiration\r\nshould be just as gradual with relaxation of every muscle. It is most\r\nimportant that the _lower_ part of the chest should first be filled by\r\ndepressing the diaphragm (the muscular floor of the lungs). Some\r\npractise is needed before this habit is acquired, but it is well worth\r\ncultivating. Place the hands on the sides of the abdomen while\r\ninspiring, to feel that _this_ is expanding. Teachers of singing insist\r\non diaphragmatic breathing, which is also of great benefit to the\r\nstomach, liver, and other organs. By the movement it gives to the\r\nintestines their action is also assisted, and constipation is\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nThis deep breathing may be practised several times each day (say ten\r\nbreaths at a time) till the habit of correct breathing is acquired. It\r\nwill be found to have a wonderfully soothing and calming effect (_see_\r\nWorry). Such exercise should always be taken in the open-air, or in a\r\nroom with a widely open window. A good plan is to take them in bed\r\nbefore rising, with little or no clothes on, while lying flat on the\r\nback.\r\n\r\nPaleness, langour, irritability, and general ill-health result from\r\ninsufficient breathing. Furthermore, the system becomes unable to\r\nresist disease. We know no aid to beauty more effective than the\r\npractice of deep breathing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreathing, in Going Uphill.--_See_ Breath, and Nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish Cholera is to a certain extent epidemic--that is, it affects a\r\nlarge number of people in a particular place, being, it is believed,\r\nconveyed mainly by the common house flies. War should be waged against\r\nthese, and great care taken to guard food, especially that of children,\r\nagainst them, by using covers, etc. If this were done the appalling\r\ndeath-rate in summer from this disease among the young would be largely\r\nreduced. Typhoid fever and other diseases are probably also spread by\r\nflies. Care should be taken to remove promptly all refuse from about\r\nthe house, and so prevent flies breeding on it.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary diarrhoea, injections of cold water by the enema will\r\nusually cure, especially if a little vinegar or a few drops of acetic\r\nacid be added to the water. But in British Cholera this proves\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\nThis is not an affection of merely one part of the system, but of the\r\nwhole. If, then, you brace with the cold enema one part, no doubt so\r\nfar you do good and not harm, but you cannot by this, cure an affection\r\nof the whole system. British Cholera is a sweating from the surfaces of\r\nthe whole alimentary organs. This internal sweat flows into the stomach\r\nand causes vomiting, and into the bowels causing purging that cannot be\r\nstayed by any application to the lower part merely.\r\n\r\nThe problem to be solved is how to give more life force. Whenever the\r\ninjection of cold water fails, and especially when it rather increases\r\nthe complaint, and vomiting or sickness shows that the attack is of the\r\nnature of British Cholera, you will do well to pack feet and legs in a\r\ngood blanket fomentation. Put a little olive oil on before and after\r\nsuch a packing. One application may be sufficient; but it may be\r\nnecessary to repeat the packing. Give frequent sips of hot water. It\r\nwill be well also to use the cold injection, as it will be found to\r\ntake good effect whenever the vital force has been increased by the hot\r\npacking. If cramp has shown itself, it will be needful to cool the\r\nspinal nerves (_see_ Angina Pectoris), but this only when you are\r\neffectually heating the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe first injection may be followed by even an excessive motion, but if\r\nthat is followed up with another injection still of cold water, there\r\nwill be nothing experienced after but perfect comfort, and no more\r\ntrouble with the bowels.\r\n\r\nThe violent irritation that follows after a very simple over-action of\r\nthe lower bowel is quite prevented when this remedy is effectually\r\nused. In less severe cases, where fermentation of food is the cause of\r\nthe disease, frequently a dessertspoonful of castor oil, or other\r\nsimple purgative, will prove sufficient to cure.\r\n\r\nBrandy often gets the credit of curing in such cases. It does so simply\r\nbecause the cases in which it _kills_ are not taken into account. It\r\nalways _lessens_ vital energy, and in British Cholera increase of this\r\nis urgently required.\r\n\r\n\r\nBronchitis.--This frequent and severe trouble results most usually from\r\nchill to the skin throwing overwork on the lungs and bronchial tubes.\r\nThese last become inflamed and swollen. A fiery heat and pain in the\r\nchest follows, the whole system becomes fevered, and breathing is\r\ndifficult, and accompanied by severe cough.\r\n\r\nKneipp linen underwear, which is porous, and has a stimulating effect\r\non the skin, assists it to perform its functions, and will therefore\r\nprove useful to sufferers from Bronchitis.\r\n\r\nAbundance of fresh air will often entirely prevent Bronchitis. We have\r\nknown people who suffered from it every winter for years who never had\r\nit again after learning the value of the constantly open window.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest stage, when the chill is first felt, let the patient go\r\nto bed. First sponge up and down the back quickly with hot soap and\r\nwater. Dry this off, and sponge or rub gently with hot vinegar. Dry\r\nthis off, and rub with warm olive oil. This will often ward off an\r\nattack entirely.\r\n\r\nWhen the trouble has fairly obtained hold, treatment must be applied to\r\nthe back and chest as follows. Place on the upper part of the back a\r\nBRAN POULTICE (_see_), large enough to cover the entire shoulders and\r\nupper back. Let the patient lie in bed comfortably on this. Then apply\r\ntowels wrung out of _cold_ water on the chest where pain and\r\nbreath-catching are felt. Let the towels be large, and at least four\r\nply. Change for a fresh one as soon as that on the chest becomes\r\nheated. When this has been done as long as the poultice keeps hot, take\r\nall off, rub back and chest with hot vinegar, dry off, rub with hot\r\noil, dry off, and cover all with warm new flannel. If needful, repeat\r\nthe application. We have seldom seen it required twice.\r\n\r\nIf the fever is very great, use no olive oil, and for a strong patient\r\nthe cold towels may be used without the poultice. But immediately these\r\nreduce the fever, the poultice should be used as directed.\r\n\r\nIn many cases where medical men have given up hope, this treatment has\r\neffected a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrow, The Weary.--Sometimes in the case of a child at school, the\r\nresult of overwork shows itself in a weariness and weight in the brow.\r\nOften parents are glorying in the school successes of their children,\r\nwhen these are having their brains destroyed. Careful watching should\r\never be given to the young. The aim in education should be to draw out\r\nthe faculties, and teach the young to think for themselves, rather than\r\nto cram in a mass of facts which will enable them to take prizes and\r\npass examinations with honours.\r\n\r\nThe results of continued overwork are fatal, but in its earlier stages\r\nit is easily remedied. Hence the need for watching and treating such an\r\nearly symptom as head weariness. For treatment see that the feet are\r\nwarm, bathing them if necessary (_see_ Bathing Feet). Stop school at\r\nonce, and give as much exercise in the open air, at play, as possible.\r\nThen rub gently with both hands up and over the brow and sides of the\r\nhead over the ears, then up the back and over top of the head. Rub all\r\nover the head with the finger points (not nails), so as to raise a glow\r\nin the skin of the scalp. This treatment is best done while the patient\r\nsits, and the operator stands behind or beside him. Gentleness of touch\r\nthere must be, and no irritation of the patient. With abstention from\r\nall lessons, it will soon cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBruises.--For slight bruises, such as children frequently get by\r\nfalling, a little butter or vaseline, applied immediately, is an\r\nexcellent remedy. For more serious injuries, such as bruised nails of\r\nthe fingers or toes, or such as result from violent knocks on any part,\r\nthe best remedy is hot fomentation or hot bathing, whichever may be\r\nmost convenient in application. Persistent and repeated treatment in\r\nthis way, with oil dressing, will cure in almost any case not so severe\r\nas to be beyond remedy. Even where it is thought wise to send for a\r\nsurgeon, this bathing is the proper first treatment, and will do much\r\nto relieve the inevitable pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns.--For _slight_ burns, immerse the injured part in cold water, and\r\nkeep there till the pain abates. This is where only redness of skin is\r\nproduced. In case of a blister forming, do not break or cut it, but\r\nperseveringly cool with cold water, and leave the blister till it comes\r\naway of itself, when the sore will be found healed beneath it.\r\n\r\nWhere a large surface is injured, some other part of the body must be\r\n_fomented_; best the legs and feet, or the back, while the injured part\r\nis persistently cooled. Thus a dangerous chill is avoided. The ARMCHAIR\r\nFOMENTATION may be used, or a large BRAN POULTICE (_see both these_),\r\nand thus the heat of the body kept up while cold water is applied to\r\nthe burns. If these cannot be immersed, as in the case of the face,\r\ncover them with an air-tight covering, and apply iced or cold cloths\r\nabove this. The linseed oil and lime-water known as \"Carron Oil\" forms\r\nthe best dressing to apply. If a burn has, however, gone so far as to\r\nbecome, owing to neglect, a festering sore, then warm water treatment\r\nis required, as recommended for ABSCESS (_see_). _See also_ Wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nButtermilk.--Where we prescribe this, either for drinking or for\r\nexternal use in poultices or bathing, it is very important it should be\r\npure and fresh. If kept too long, it causes often terrible pain when\r\napplied to eruptive sores. There must be no \"watering\" or doctoring\r\nwith cream of tartar, if good results are desired. If the milk be too\r\nlong kept, and cannot be had fresh, it may be mixed with a little sweet\r\nmilk and all churned well together. Then it may be used. If still\r\npainful, mix again with more sweet milk. To soak diseased skin in good\r\nfresh buttermilk is so powerful a means of cure, that to procure it a\r\ngood deal of trouble is well spent. It is also invaluable as a daily\r\ndrink for regulating the bowels, and maintaining health. Sterilise all\r\nsweet milk used.\r\n\r\nIf buttermilk cannot be had, acetic acid or vinegar, or the juice of\r\nlemons, may be mixed with sweet milk or even water, until the mixture\r\nattains about the usual sourness of buttermilk. This makes an efficient\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nButtermilk Poultice.--Boiled potatoes beaten up with fresh buttermilk\r\nmake an excellent poultice for all eruptive sores, scabbed heads, and\r\nheated skin affections. After these always apply soap lather (_see_\r\nLather). If buttermilk cannot be had, use acetic acid or vinegar, as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\nCancer.--Swellings in the breast often arouse fear of cancer, but are\r\ngenerally very simple affairs and easily yield to treatment as in\r\narticle Breast, Swelling in. If not, we should chill the diseased\r\ngrowth so as to arrest it. Now this, as we have proved, may be\r\neffectually done, and the sorely tried patient may be saved a world of\r\npain, and perhaps cured. We have seen more than one apparently\r\ndesperate case, even where the breast had been cut off and the evil was\r\nagain showing itself, in which effective cooling arrested the growth\r\nand saved the sufferer. When a growth of this kind has gone a certain\r\nlength, there is severe pain. The cooling removes this, and secures the\r\npatient unspeakably precious rest without narcotics. But this is not\r\nall: it puts an effectual stop to the swelling. If the case has not\r\ngone very far, the swelling falls, and may disappear; but even when it\r\nhas gone too far for this, the disease is stayed, and all symptoms of\r\nit are lessened. All swelling but the actual separate growth is\r\nremoved. For instance, when the swelling has passed from the breast\r\ninto the armpit it has been dispelled, and entirely confined to the\r\nactual substance of the tumour. This is managed simply by the\r\npersistent and vigorous use of cold towels. They must be large enough\r\nto allow of fourfold covering of the whole breast. They are wrung out\r\nof cold water at first, and, if possible, cooled with ice instead of\r\nbeing wrung out after. One at a time is kindly pressed all round and\r\nover the swollen breast. It is heated in one or two minutes, and must\r\nbe changed. The second is pressed round and all over the breast in the\r\nsame way. It is soon heated too, but you may have three of them in a\r\ncircle, and if you have a bit of ice for those that are cooling, you\r\nhave cold enough. Some would put on an ice-bag, and let it lie, but we\r\nhave never been able to advise this, as it is very apt to destroy the\r\nouter skin by too severe cold. This treatment requires work--no doubt\r\nof that--but the effects are well worth it.\r\n\r\nWhen the cooling treatment, given twice a day, or oftener if it can be\r\nwithout discomfort, has reduced the swelling and put back the tumour,\r\ntill it may fairly be regarded as capable of absorption, it will be\r\nwell to try the effect of hot fomentation by bathing (_see_ Breast,\r\nSwelling in). This will not do harm, but good, if it is only used so\r\nfar as to try whether the stage for hot treatment has been reached. If\r\nthe hot bathing is agreeable, and instead of causing pain, rather\r\nsoothes and comforts, it may be strongly tried. But this will be only\r\nif the effectual cooling has put back the disease, or if it has been\r\nreally mastered. So long as it shows a tendency to increase, it will be\r\nwell to continue the cooling.\r\n\r\nEven if it be not possible to remove the disease, its progress may be\r\narrested, and it may be rendered dormant for the rest of life. We know\r\npersons sent off to die with growths who are now quite well and have\r\nbeen so for many years, with these growths only rendered dormant. Even\r\nif this is not possible, it may be that we render the growth so slow\r\nthat it shall come to nothing important in the remainder of even a long\r\nlife. We should never hesitate to do our utmost in any case.\r\n\r\nBesides the local treatment given above, vital action in the whole\r\nbodily system has to be increased on a definite line. This is the\r\nripening and removing used-up substance from the body. It is sluggish\r\nripening of substance to which we trace the morbid living growth; that\r\nsluggishness must be overcome. The first and most important means for\r\nthis is fresher air for the lungs. The seaside home, if there are no\r\ndrugs or drinks prescribed in ignorance, nor any other drawback, will\r\nbe found of immense value here.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to fresh air is pure distilled water. It should be\r\nused both in preparing food and for drinking. This constant use of\r\ndistilled water is one of the most important remedies in cases of\r\ncancer. Comfortable clothing (_see_ Underwear) should be worn by night\r\nand day, and damp avoided. The food should be such as can be most\r\neasily assimilated. Whole wheaten meal in various forms and pure water\r\nwork wonders on \"hopeless cases.\"\r\n\r\nBut when all these conditions have been supplied, \"pack\" the whole body\r\nat eight o'clock at night in cloths lightly wrung out of hot vinegar\r\nand water, half and half, and covering these with dry sheets and\r\nblankets, give the patient an hour in this \"pack.\" On taking out of\r\nthis, rub gently all over with hot olive oil, dry that off and put to\r\nbed. In the morning, at half-past seven or so, pack in a soapy blanket\r\nfor an hour, then sponge with vinegar and rub with oil. Take a stick of\r\ngood liquorice, with half an ounce of senna leaves, and put these in a\r\nquart of water, boil the whole down to a pint, giving a teaspoonful of\r\nthis in a little hot water three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCancer in Face.--Treat as far as possible as recommended for breast\r\ncancer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCancer in Foot.--We have noted one case in which \"Cancerous Gangrene\"\r\nin the foot, pronounced incurable by the medical attendant, was cured\r\nby our instructions in the following simple manner. Buttermilk\r\npoultices (_see_) were used over the whole foot to thoroughly cleanse\r\nthe sores. These were then carefully lathered with soap (_see_ Lather\r\nand Soap). Vinegar or weak acid was applied with sponges and syringe\r\nafter this, and made thoroughly to penetrate all the sores to the\r\nbottom. This was done twice a day, and in one week improvement set in.\r\nIn a comparatively short time the patient could walk miles without\r\nfatigue. This treatment may be applied to all angry sores.\r\n\r\n\r\nCane Syrup.--In the original edition, good treacle was recommended as a\r\nlaxative. This treacle, which was prepared from cane sugar, we\r\nunderstand is now not to be had--what is sold as treacle being largely\r\nmixed with glucose. We therefore recommend instead the use of golden\r\nsyrup made from pure cane sugar. This can be had (in tins), guaranteed\r\nby the makers to be genuine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbuncle.--_See_ Boil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatarrh.--Is simply an inflammation due to impurity of the blood. These\r\nimpurities arise from bad air or wrong food, and remain in the body\r\ntill a chill of some kind or other forces the blood and the impurities\r\nwith the blood to some part, resulting in inflammation. Catarrh in the\r\nmucous membrane, connected with respiration, is commonly called a\r\n\"cold,\" and is decidedly infectious (_see_ Air). A cold must be\r\nregarded as an effort of Nature to get rid of these impurities.\r\nBreathing of fresh, even cold air, will expedite, not hinder the cure.\r\n\r\nWashing the hands and face in _cold_ water, and drying vigorously, will\r\noften cure it when beginning as \"cold in the head.\" Cold, applied in a\r\ncertain way, cures the after effects of chill, but it must be so\r\napplied as only to affect the part to which it is applied, while the\r\ngeneral heat of the body is kept up. Catarrh may occur in any internal\r\nmembrane of the body. If these can be reached, as the nostrils, or even\r\nthe bowels, may be by syringing, then nothing is better to effect a\r\ncure than cool water and vinegar, or weak acetic acid. Brush the\r\nnostrils often with this, and cold in the head will soon be cured. It\r\ncan be applied still better by means of a nasal douche. Syringing the\r\nbowels with this cool acid mixture in the more serious catarrh of these\r\nwill also cure. Patient perseverance is wanted, however, in the latter\r\ncase. Get also the external skin to act thoroughly. Where the cause of\r\ninternal catarrh is exhaustion, through overwork or worry, the cause\r\nmust be removed. Let the sufferer learn trust in a living Heavenly\r\nFather, and cast all burdens upon Him, and the physical treatment will\r\nhave a fair chance to cure. _See_ Breath and Skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCauliflower Growths.--These begin like warts, and in the earlier stages\r\npoulticing and soaking with weak acid almost invariably cure. After\r\nsome months the growth looks like the head of a cauliflower, and\r\nbecomes dangerous if on a vital region. It is not really a parasite,\r\nbut rather a diseased state of the skin, which is perfectly curable.\r\nFirst every part is carefully cleansed with a small camel's-hair brush\r\nand weak acid (_see_ Acetic Acid). Then the buttermilk poultice is\r\napplied all night, or even night and day (_see_ Buttermilk Poultice).\r\nCleanse again after poulticing. Careful and persevering continuance of\r\nthis treatment will effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCayenne and Mustard.--Mustard spread on a _cold_ towel and applied to\r\nthe spine or lumbar region of the back is often an effective aid to the\r\ncold treatment. If such applications have to be made more than once,\r\ncayenne pepper is preferable to the mustard, and equally powerful. When\r\ncold cloths alone fail, this more powerful treatment may be tried. Pain\r\nand burning after cayenne are relieved by applying olive oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCayenne Lotion, or \"Sweating Mixture.\"--This is made with one or two\r\ntablespoonfuls of cayenne pepper (as desired weak or strong), half a\r\npint of white vinegar, and a pint of boiling water. These are mixed and\r\ninfused for half-an-hour. The mixture is then carefully strained so as\r\nto remove the pepper grains. Dilute, if too strong, with water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCayenne \"Tea.\"--Infuse an ounce of good cayenne pepper in a pint of\r\nboiling water. Strain out the pepper. This produces a glow of heat on\r\nthe skin when rubbed on, and may be a valuable adjunct to oil rubbing\r\nwhere that is intended to raise such a glow.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanging Treatment.--To wisely alter and arrange the treatment in any\r\ncase is of the utmost importance. Treatment which at first gives great\r\nrelief will often become ineffective or even painful. Then some other\r\nway of cure must be tried. Sometimes cold applications will become\r\npainfully cold. Heating for a time is then effective, and cooling can\r\nagain be given after the heating. Soapy lather on an inflamed part will\r\ndo delightful service for a while, then it may become painful. Warm oil\r\nmay then be used instead. When this becomes irritant, a return to the\r\nsoap will cure. Or the hot bathing of a sore knee may be most effective\r\nfor a while, and then may give rise to sore pain. In such a case, cease\r\nthe bathing, and for a time apply the soapy lather. Do not despair\r\nbecause a thing \"loses its effect.\" Its apparent loss of power only\r\nindicates a needed change of treatment. Common sense will guide in\r\nthis, and the true healer and nurse will be able to judge what is best\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nWe have a case in which, after long rubbing with acetic acid, the skin\r\nseemed to become so used to it that little or no effect was produced.\r\nFor a few days an alkali, in the simple form of \"hartshorn\" (ammonia)\r\nwas rubbed on instead of the acid. The acid rubbing was then resumed,\r\nand produced its usual effect. Such plans will occur to all who are\r\nthoughtful, and do not just blindly follow instructions.\r\n\r\nCold-water cloths have got in certain circles to be fashionable, so\r\nthat they are used exclusively in all cases. A knee joint has got\r\nwrong, and it is deemed the right thing to wear a cold bandage\r\nconstantly round it. But this fails to have the desired effect. It may\r\nnot fail entirely, so long as there is some vital energy on which to\r\n\"come and go,\" as we say, the effect of the reaction will be to give a\r\nmeasure of relief. But in very many cases this vital energy is\r\ndeficient. If in such a case the person advising it has only thought\r\nenough to have recourse to an hour's hot fomentation once or twice a\r\nday, the effect desired may not be long delayed. Supposing something\r\nlike inflammation of the lungs has to be dealt with. Cold is applied on\r\nthe chest, as it is often most successfully applied, when there is\r\nstill a good deal of energy to be drawn upon. But in this case there is\r\nnot sufficient energy. Well pack the feet and legs in a thoroughly hot\r\nfomentation, such as will renew a full supply of heat all over the\r\nbody. Then you will find the cooling of the chest thoroughly effectual.\r\nIn a very considerable correspondence we meet often with this resolve:\r\n\"We shall continue to do as you direct till we hear from you again.\" We\r\nremember telling a young man to put a hot bran poultice between his\r\nshoulders for a troublesome cough. We saw him no more for months, but\r\nwhen we did meet him he apologised for not continuing the application.\r\nHe said, \"I poulticed my shoulders for three weeks, and they began to\r\nget soft, so I stopped doing it.\" We certainly thought his head had\r\nbeen soft to begin with! Why should not sensible men and women get a\r\nlittle independent thought of their own?\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remark that the cessation of all treatment is a\r\nchange, and often a very beneficial one too. If you do not know what to\r\ndo when any treatment is \"losing its effect,\" or having the opposite\r\neffect to that which it had, just cease to do anything till you see\r\nmanifestly what is needed. The rest of a week, or even two, may be just\r\nthe thing wanted. If it is, it will ease the pain; if it does not, you\r\nwill see that probably the opposite of what you had been doing will\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapped Hands.--Our idea is that this is caused by the soda in the soap\r\nused. At any rate, we have never known any one to suffer from chapped\r\nhands who used M'Clinton's soap _only_.\r\n\r\nIt is made from the ash of plants, which gives it a mildness not\r\napproached by even the most expensive soaps obtainable.\r\n\r\nIf the hands have become chapped, fill a pair of old loose kid gloves\r\nwith well wrought Lather (_see_), putting these on just when getting\r\ninto bed, and wearing till morning. Doing this for two or three nights\r\nwill cure chapped, or even the more painful \"hacked\" hands, where the\r\nouter skin has got hard and cracked down to the tender inner layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nChest Pains.--_See_ Angina Pectoris.\r\n\r\n\r\nChest Protectors.--These are often piled on the front of the body,\r\nwhile the far more important _back_ is left exposed. In many cases of\r\ndelicacy and cough, particularly with women, it is far more effective\r\nto protect the upper back with warm extra flannel than to place\r\ncovering on the chest. This alone will sometimes cure distressing\r\ncoughs. In every case, such \"protection,\" whether to back or breast,\r\nshould be such as to secure free escape of perspiration (_see_\r\nUnderwear). A sheet of fine wadding is excellent. Where less heat is\r\ndesired, new flannel is the best. Often, also, chest trouble is best\r\nhelped by protecting the soles of the feet. If these and the back are\r\nkept warm, there is little fear or harm at the front of the chest. Let\r\nthe back covering, where it is used, come down as far as the top of the\r\nhip bones.\r\n\r\n\r\nChilblains.--These occur in hands and feet where the circulative power\r\nis feeble, either from weakness or from tight pressure of boots or\r\ngloves. The cold has power, owing to lack of circulation, to partly\r\nkill the skin, which thus becomes painfully inflamed, and swells. To\r\nincrease and maintain circulation in the part is to cure it. In the\r\nearly stages, when heat and itching are felt, a good rubbing with hot\r\nolive oil and cayenne tea will often cure. But if this fail, pack the\r\nfoot or hand in cloths soaked with vinegar. If the pain is great, place\r\nthe packed foot or hand in hot water for a few minutes or more. After\r\nthis immersion repack with vinegar-soaked cloths, cover well up with\r\ndry flannel, and wear this packing all night. In cases where weakness\r\nis the root of the trouble, rub the back once a day with hot oil until\r\na glow of heat arises all over it. Do this daily for a fortnight _at\r\nleast_. Where tight boots or gloves are the cause, these must be\r\ndiscarded for more easily fitting ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nChild-bearing.--Simple remedies such as we advocate are found of\r\nimmense service in mitigating both the pains of child-birth and the\r\ntroubles coming before and after it.\r\n\r\nTo see that the medical man is one thoroughly competent is the first\r\nduty of those responsible in such a case. Incompetent and careless\r\ndoctors are the cause of much trouble. Get, then, the _best you can_.\r\nMuch may be done, however, to prevent trouble by very simple means.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings usually accompanying pregnancy and the birth of children\r\nin civilized countries are largely confined to the higher classes.\r\nWorking women escape much of the pain their more luxurious sisters have\r\nto endure. Travellers tell us how, among the Red Indians, Negroes,\r\nSouth Sea Islanders and others who live more in a state of nature than\r\nwe, the women suffer but little in childbirth, and return to their\r\nordinary occupations almost immediately after the event. The adoption\r\nof a simple and natural diet, healthy exercise combined with sufficient\r\nrest and rational clothing, have been found to ensure an easy delivery\r\nas well as good health for mother and child.\r\n\r\nThe _diet_ of the pregnant mother is of great importance. Too much food\r\nis worse than useless. Food should only be taken of such a kind and\r\nquality as can be easily assimilated. The mother is best who takes only\r\nso much light food as she can easily convert into good blood. More,\r\nsimply loads the system with useless waste or fat.\r\n\r\nThe diet during pregnancy should be mainly vegetables, fruit, salad,\r\nrice, tapioca, milk, eggs in moderation, and a small amount of\r\nwholemeal bread. A little meat or fish once a day is allowable for\r\nthose whom it suits, but rich, spicy dishes, pastry, strong tea, coffee\r\nand all alcoholic drinks are very injurious. Three meals a day with no\r\n\"snacks\" of any kind between, are sufficient. For those who have reason\r\nto dread a hard confinement, oatmeal is best avoided. To avoid fluids\r\nwhile eating is important, especially for those who have a weak\r\ndigestion. One may drink half-an-hour before meals or three hours\r\nafter, but if plenty of fruit and salad is eaten and little salt used\r\nwith the food there will be little thirst. Too much fluid should not be\r\ndrunk, if thirst is felt, water very slowly sipped will quench it\r\nbetter than copious draughts. During pregnancy there is often a craving\r\nfor acid fruits, this is nature's call for what is needful at such a\r\ntime. Fruits and green vegetables supply a large quantity of most\r\nvaluable salts which go to make good blood and build up all parts of\r\nthe body. Never force the appetite. Food that is neither relished nor\r\ndigested will do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIt must never be forgotten that the blood of the child is being\r\ndirectly derived from that of the mother, consequently if the diet is\r\nof such a nature as to induce over-abundance of fat, the child will be\r\nborn too fat. This does not mean a healthy child by any means, and it\r\nmay mean considerable extra pain for the mother. A mother inclined to\r\nthinness need not fear that this diet will reduce her. The taking of\r\ncream, eggs, bacon and other fat foods often has the opposite effect\r\nfrom that desired. A thin person adopting the above light diet will\r\ngenerally get into good condition.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of _exercise_, the first we would recommend is general\r\nhousework, provided windows are kept open, avoiding the more laborious\r\nparts, and always being careful not to get over-fatigued. Light\r\ngardening, walks, if not too long, and light gymnastic exercises are\r\nall beneficial. The exercises described in the appendix, practised for\r\nten minutes at a time, once or twice a day, are quite suitable for the\r\nexpectant mother, while deep breathing (_see_ Breathing, Correct Method\r\nof) is most valuable.\r\n\r\nThe subject of _dress_ should be particularly studied. Garments which\r\nare light, warm, porous, and which in no way impede or restrict the\r\nmovements and natural functions of the body, should be worn. It has\r\nbeen found that those who wear no corset nor tight band or bodice will\r\nsuffer but little, if at all, from morning sickness. Corsets, by\r\nholding immobile the waist muscles, prevent their getting strong.\r\nAnyone who is accustomed to corsets, when she leaves them off for a day\r\nwill complain of \"such a tired feeling, as if she would break in two.\"\r\nThis is easily accounted for, the muscles, unused to the task of\r\nholding up the body, are flabby and useless. These same muscles when\r\ncalled on, at the moment of delivery, are totally unfit for their work,\r\nhence comes a large amount of the unnecessary suffering. The remedy\r\nis--discard the corsets, bear with the tiredness for a week or two and\r\nregularly practice the exercises recommended above, especially the\r\nwaist exercises of bending and turning. The muscles will soon gain\r\nstrength, and the corset be found to be quite unnecessary and most\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of pregnancy, when there is sickness and vomiting,\r\nwe have seen it cured, even when so severe as to threaten life, by\r\nspreading over the patient's irritated stomach, a soft, fine soap\r\nlather (_see_ Lather and Soap). It acts in such cases like a charm. The\r\nlather is well and _gently_ spread with a _soft_ brush all over the\r\nstomach. Wipe it gently off with a _soft_ cloth. Cover again with fresh\r\nlather. Do this five or six times. Then treat the back in the same\r\nmanner, behind the stomach. In half-an-hour all retching should cease.\r\nWhen the stomach has had a rest of some hours, a small quantity of\r\nlight food may be given. Half a Saltcoat's biscuit (_see_) thoroughly\r\nmasticated, and a little milk and boiling water may be enough to take\r\nat one time. Do not force the appetite, wait until a desire for food is\r\nfelt. Pass by degrees to ordinary food.\r\n\r\nIf the mother, at any time, feels faint, on no account give brandy.\r\nDrop five drops of tincture of cayenne on a lump of sugar. Dissolve it\r\nin half a teacupful of hot water, and give this instead. In cases of\r\nheartburn, take small drinks of hot water, say a tablespoonful every\r\nfive minutes. A very great help to the expecting mother is found in the\r\ncold sitz-bath (_see_ Sitting Bath). Baths known as \"Matlock Baths\" may\r\nbe had, which suit very well for this purpose; but a tub for washing,\r\nof a suitable size, would do very well, or even a large sized bedroom\r\nbasin will serve. Put in cold water, three inches deep, and let the\r\npatient sit in it. In winter have the water cold, but not freezing. The\r\nrest of the body may be kept warm with a wrap, and if the patient feels\r\ncold, the feet may be placed in hot water. Taken once or twice a day\r\nthis bath will have a tonic effect on the whole system, and a markedly\r\ncheering effect on the mind. The time in the bath is shorter or longer\r\naccording to the patient's strength and power of reaction. Feeling will\r\nbe the best guide, but even a dip of half-a-minute will do good.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the actual birth, we repeat that those concerned should\r\nsee to the attendance of a _really_ skilful medical man. Chloroform in\r\nthe hands of such a doctor is of immense value, but in unskilful hands\r\nit is dangerous. Therefore let expense be no bar, where it is possible,\r\nto the obtaining the best medical aid that can be had.\r\n\r\nMany trivial matters greatly affect the mother during child-birth, and\r\nthe few succeeding hours. We have known a stupid remark by an\r\nincompetent nurse spoil a mother's health for months. The greatest care\r\nmust be exercised by all concerned to say only cheerful and soothing\r\nthings to the sufferer. Even the aspect of the room is important. It\r\nshould look sunwards, if possible, and hideous pictures should be\r\nremoved, while perhaps some text speaking comfortably of the Good\r\nShepherd, who \"will gently lead those that are with young,\" may be hung\r\nup. Trifles these, but their effect is no trifle.\r\n\r\nDo not keep the patient in too hot a room; fresh air is of great value.\r\nDo not leave her for nine days in an unchanged bed. The necessary\r\nsponging and changing should be done daily. Cleanliness means comfort\r\nhere, and comfort health. It is not early sponging and washing, but a\r\nnine days' steaming in unchanged bedclothes which causes chills. After\r\ncool sponging, a gentle rubbing under the bedclothes with hot olive\r\noil, over the body and limbs, will be very refreshing. All clothes,\r\netc., and the hands of the attendants should be most carefully washed\r\nand cleaned before they touch the patient. Too much care in this matter\r\nof cleanliness cannot be taken, as it is of the _first importance_ as a\r\npreventative of many troubles.\r\n\r\nWhat are called \"After Pains\" often give much distress. Drugs and\r\nalcohol should be strictly avoided. The difficulty here is in the\r\nobjection so many have to cold applications. These, after child-birth,\r\nare not dangerous, but form a short and simple road to health. Making\r\nhandfuls of soapy lather (_see_ Lather) and rubbing these gently over\r\nthe pains, both back and front, is most powerfully soothing, and has no\r\ntendency to chill.\r\n\r\nWhere severe pains, indicating inflammatory action, are felt in the\r\nbowels, this lather should at once be applied, and followed up with\r\ncold cloths over the bowels, applied as to the chest in Bronchitis\r\n(_see_). The bran poultice should always be applied at the same time,\r\nputting it on before the cold towels, over all the lower back (_see_\r\nBran Poultice). Sips of hot water will also powerfully help in all\r\ncases of such pain.\r\n\r\nTreatment on these lines will deal with even very severe cases of After\r\nPains.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren and Teachers.--Children are of the utmost value to society;\r\nthrough any one of them the divine light may shine which will bless\r\nmany generations. They are very easily hurt by unwise treatment and\r\nteaching. We would have the teacher and parent impressed with the\r\npreciousness of even the most delicate child. _Health of mind and\r\nbody_, not attainment, must be the _first consideration_ in the\r\nteaching of the young. It ought to be as much the teacher's business to\r\nsee that pupils do not suffer in health as to see that lessons (often\r\nquite useless) are learned (_see_ articles on Brow, Weary, and Eyes,\r\nFailing Sight). We would again emphasise the truth that no child should\r\nbe undervalued for its delicate health. Delicate children have often\r\nbecome men and women without whom the world would be vastly poorer.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren in Fever.--Fevered children, whether in any actual fever, as\r\nscarlet, typhoid, or any other, or merely heated from some minor\r\nailment, should be treated as under Fever. Have two small towels, wring\r\nthem tightly out of cold water, fold one gently round the head. _Press\r\nit gently_ all round and over the head. It will be heated in one minute\r\nin some cases, longer in others. Change it for the other then, and\r\nproceed alternately till the head is cooled. Perhaps that may take\r\nhalf-an-hour. The time will be less for a young infant, more for a boy\r\nor girl in their teens. Common sense, and an examination of the pulse,\r\nwill guide as to the proper time. The head is the chief consideration\r\nin this treatment, but attention to the state of the stomach and bowels\r\nis also very important. Any indigestible substance must be removed, and\r\nsips or small drinks of hot water will greatly help in this, as well as\r\nproper medicine. Castor oil is a good, simple drug for ordinary cases.\r\nIf there is coldness in the feet in such fevered cases, a fomentation\r\nmay be applied over the legs, or even up to the haunches. This will\r\ngreatly reinforce the cooling of the head, and prevent any possible\r\nchill. The water used for cooling should be about 50 deg. F., or at\r\nleast near that temperature, in the case of infants. Water which has\r\nstood some time in an ordinary room will do excellently. It should\r\nneither be icy nor warm. Typhoid fever itself has been cured with this\r\nhead cooling alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Clothing.--An infant's clothing should be soft, warm, and\r\nlight in weight, covering all parts of the body with equal warmth.\r\nTight bands and long, heavy skirts should never be used, the dress and\r\npetticoat being just long enough to keep the feet covered and warm. If\r\nfrom the first a baby is \"held out\" always after being nursed, it\r\nlearns to urinate at that time, and the clumsy diapers can be dispensed\r\nwith in a few months. _No ordinary pins_ should be used, and as few\r\nsafety pins as possible. Tapes properly arranged will keep all secure.\r\n\r\nFlannelette should never be used, being so very inflammable (_see_\r\nChildren's Dangers).\r\n\r\nWith infants, as with older children, it is a mistake to heap on too\r\nmuch clothing. Many children by such coddling, which is intended to\r\nprevent them catching cold, are rendered delicate and susceptible to\r\nchills. Just enough clothing should be worn to keep the little one\r\ncomfortably warm and no more. The same applies to bed-clothes; they\r\nshould be light and not excessive, only enough to keep the child\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nBabies thoroughly enjoy a time every day without clothes, when they can\r\nkick to their hearts' content. If this is begun by degrees, a short\r\ntime at first, gradually getting longer every day, there will be no\r\ndanger of giving the child cold through letting it lie unclothed, on a\r\nrug on the floor for half-an-hour at a time, with the window open. The\r\nair-bath will invigorate and strengthen the system. Rubbing with the\r\nhand all over the little ones body during this time will be enjoyed,\r\nand effectually prevent any chilliness, if it is dreaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Dangers.--Avoidance of the causes of disease requires some\r\nidea of the dangers to which children are exposed in the usual\r\nupbringing. For instance, sitting on damp ground, cold stones, or even\r\na cool window-sill, is a fruitful cause of bowel trouble. The remedy\r\nfor such an exposure is proper warm FOMENTATION (_see_) of the chilled\r\nparts, followed by hot olive oil rubbing and careful clothing.\r\n\r\nAgain, _rich diet_, especially for delicate children, is a great cause\r\nof trouble. What we have written concerning food, and the article\r\nAssimilation, should be read to guide on this.\r\n\r\nAgain, the child is exposed to falls, and falls into water, leading\r\nsometimes to drowning. Timely thought would prevent nearly all such\r\naccidents. Do not wait until the trouble comes. Protect exposed streams\r\nand wells near the house. Shut doors and gates in time. Also the\r\ndirections of the Humane Society for the recovery of the partly drowned\r\n(_see_ Drowning) should be in every house, and as soon as possible both\r\nboys and girls should learn to swim.\r\n\r\nAgain, children are in danger through careless attendants. They may be\r\nlet fall, or capsized in perambulators. Spinal injury is often caused\r\nby such falls. In case of any broken or disjointed limbs, the bandaging\r\nof infants should be of a gentle kind, and encasement in starch or\r\nplaster jackets should be avoided. In every way the natural growth and\r\ncirculation should be helped, not hindered by strapping and tight\r\nbandaging. The timely consulting of a _really good_ doctor will often\r\nprevent serious trouble in any case of a fall.\r\n\r\nAnother source of danger is the exposure of children to the possibility\r\nof burning or scalding. Wherever there are young children fires should\r\nbe guarded, and matters so arranged that they cannot come in the way of\r\nboiling water. Much that seems impossible in such protection becomes\r\neasy enough to a determined person, and a great deal of sore illness\r\ncan be averted by taking a little trouble. A child should never be in\r\nthe place where there is a pan of boiling water on the floor, nor in\r\nany house should it be _possible_ for a child to pull a kettle full of\r\nboiling water on its head.\r\n\r\nIf, however, scalding occur, apply the cold treatment as detailed in\r\nthe article on Burns.\r\n\r\nIn case of contracted limbs or features, occurring from severe burning,\r\nthe rubbing treatment (_see_ Children's Healthy Growth), will be\r\neffective as a cure.\r\n\r\nChildren's clothing should never be made of flannelette, it is so\r\nliable to take fire if the child approaches the grate. At hundreds of\r\ninquests coroners have directed attention to the terrible loss of life\r\nfrom this cause.\r\n\r\nMedicines and all poisonous substances should be carefully labelled,\r\nand kept out of children's reach. If by accident a child should have\r\ntaken poison administer an antidote (_see_ Poisoning). Should a child\r\nswallow a nail, button or some such hard substance, do not give any\r\npurgative medicine. It will pass out more safely when embedded in solid\r\nfæces. Examine the stools carefully so that anxiety may be allayed when\r\nthe foreign substance is seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Deformed Feet.--_See_ Club Foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Healthy Growth.--Often either the whole system or some part\r\nfails to grow properly. In this way the spine or legs may become\r\ncurved, or generally the child is small and feeble. Growth depends\r\nlargely on the organic nerve centres. Lack of power there causes even\r\ndeformity itself. Treatment, therefore, must be such as to restore to\r\nthese centres their energy, and increase it. Do not force the child to\r\nstand or walk when wearied. If he uniformly refuses these attitudes,\r\nhave patience till he gathers power. Wash all over at bedtime with warm\r\nwater and M'Clinton's soap. Dry, and rub all over with warm olive oil.\r\nWipe this also gently off. Let the rubbing be such, along each side of\r\nthe spine, as will bring the organic nerves into action. Gentle, slow,\r\nsteady motion of the hand is best for this. All painful or irritating\r\nrubbing is positively hurtful. Let this be done every night, and even\r\nincipient deformity will be cured in time.\r\n\r\nThe nerves are in some cases irritable, and great restlessness and\r\ninvoluntary movement, accompanied even with twisting of the neck, shows\r\nitself. This will yield to skilful cooling of the spinal nerves with\r\ndamp cloths. _See_ St. Vitus' Dance.\r\n\r\nAn opposite kind of nervous failure shows itself as paralysis. The hand\r\nand arm, or foot, trails helplessly, owing to motor nerve failure. This\r\nwill often yield to the spinal rubbing and poulticing mentioned above.\r\nAnother state of failure is indicated by \"numbness\" in the fingers and\r\ntoes. The spinal rubbing and poulticing with bran will also be\r\neffective for this. Sometimes lack of nerve force shows itself as\r\nfailure to walk at the proper time. The child cannot use its limbs\r\nproperly, although these are right enough in shape and size. The cure\r\nfor this is persistent gentle rubbing with warm oil, as recommended\r\nabove, over the whole body, but especially over the back. Feel for the\r\nmuscles and bones, and adapt your hand to their shape, going down into\r\nthe hollows immediately on each side of the spine, and paying\r\nparticular attention to the _upper_ part in the failure of the _arms_,\r\nand the _lower_ part in failure of the _legs_. This rubbing is a most\r\npowerful remedy, but it must be patiently and well applied twice a day\r\nfor a length of time. Bear in mind that gradual cures are most\r\npermanent. Even creeping paralysis in adult persons yields to this\r\nrubbing. No doubt it is _work_, but it is well repaid. All troubles\r\nwhere failing nerves are concerned may be treated with some\r\nmodification of this heat and rubbing. Our readers can easily adapt it\r\nto particular needs by a little thought. _See_ Spine, Misshapen, and\r\nMassage.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Limbs.--Frequently a failure of some kind shows itself in\r\nthe limbs of some children. Usually it appears as either _bending_ or\r\ninability to walk at the proper age, or both together. To use \"steel\r\nboots\" and kindred appliances is to ignore the true nature of the\r\ntrouble, and most likely to increase it. What is wanted is proper\r\ngrowth in the limb. To secure this, the nerve system of the spine must\r\nbe stimulated, and there is no better stimulus to be had than\r\n\"massage.\" When any substance is rubbed on, it is almost always the\r\nrubbing, rather than the substance, which has the good effect. Hence we\r\nrecommend rubbing with simply good olive oil. For an infant, the back\r\nmust be massaged very gently, taking care not to hurt the child in any\r\nway. It should be applied especially up and down each side of the back\r\nbone, where there is a softer region, full of important nerve centres.\r\nThe limbs may also be gently rubbed. A genial heat should be raised in\r\nall the infant's body by these means, and, if rightly done, the child\r\nwill eagerly wish for it again. Half-an-hour a day may be given to\r\nthis. It is well to persevere for a long time, and never give up hope.\r\nMany a weak-limbed child has grown up a strong, healthy man or woman.\r\n_See_ Massage.\r\n\r\nThe food in such cases should be good ordinary food. We have never been\r\nable to see the good of cod liver oil that is so generally recommended.\r\nIt seems to us a most unnatural thing for a human being, young or old.\r\nCream and butter will supply a far more easily assimilated fat at much\r\nlower cost. We may also say that honey is more wholesome and fattening\r\nthan malt extract, and costs only one-fifth of the price.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of children on corn flour, often made with but little milk,\r\nis a fruitful source of rickets. The same may be said of white bread,\r\nthe flour having been largely deprived of its food salts. Giving\r\nchildren lime water, with the idea that the body can convert it into\r\nbone (as a hen makes her egg shells out of old mortar) is an entire\r\nmistake. The human system cannot use such inorganic material. The men\r\nof best bone, so far as we can judge, are those who have been nourished\r\nin great measure on good oatmeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Nerves.--The nervous system of children is often damaged by\r\nshock or fright, sometimes very seriously, so that paralysis or\r\nhysterical affections come on.\r\n\r\nBlindness, deafness, loss of speech, every possible loss of function\r\nmay follow a violent shock to a child's mind or bodily system. Care\r\nmust be taken to avoid this. The moment you see the child affected by\r\nany strange sight or sound have, if possible, the child removed or the\r\naffecting object put away, or have some one who can soothe the child\r\nbrought to calm its mind. This properly done, and done quickly, will\r\nusually prevent any evil effects. If, however, these come on, treatment\r\ncan do a very great deal to remedy the ill. If fits come on, lay the\r\nchild flat on his back, with head slightly raised. Place a piece of\r\ncork or wood between the teeth, fastened so as to prevent the\r\npossibility of its being swallowed, and loosen all the clothes, until\r\nthe fit is over. Continue to soothe the mind, and instil happy thoughts\r\nsuch as God gives every Christian the right to think, even in the worst\r\ntimes of trial. Bring before the child's mind some cheery tales or\r\ninteresting objects. Allay all fears, and soothe all sorrows, as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the fits come on again, with blackening of the face, _do\r\nnot treat harshly_, but apply a cold towel along the spinal cord in the\r\nmorning in bed. This will soothe even unreasonable passion, and remove\r\nstubbornness. Or if the fit is \"on,\" put warmly to bed, and then apply\r\nthe cold towel. Medical aid, when available, should also be summoned.\r\nIf a faint comes on, that points to the need of a hot fomentation along\r\nthe spine instead of a cold towel. It is not difficult as a rule to\r\ndistinguish between the fit, with its frequent convulsive cramps and\r\nblackening of the face, and the simple faint of exhaustion. In the\r\nfirst the patient is all \"strung up,\" and in the last the very\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Sleep.--This most important matter of good sleep for the\r\nchild depends not only on health of body but on ease of the infant's\r\nmind. It is wrong to treat the child otherwise than through the\r\nunderstanding, where he is afraid, or in a strange place. Waking up,\r\nafter being put to sleep in a strange room, the little one may receive\r\na shock which may prevent sleep for the rest of the night. If he be\r\npatiently soothed and matters explained, all will be well; but it is a\r\ngreat cruelty to thrash or threaten in such a case. To frighten a child\r\nwith ghost stories, or \"Bogies,\" IS TO COMMIT A SERIOUS CRIME. It is\r\nnot dealt with by the law, but it certainly deserves to be. Never bring\r\nbefore a child's mind any _imaginary terrors_; rather teach it to\r\nunderstand them in such a way as to remove any cause of fear. But do\r\nnot _force_ a child to examine an object which it fears, you may do\r\nterrible damage before you can explain. All fears should be most\r\ncarefully dealt with, and no force employed; the little one who has no\r\nimaginary terrors, and is kindly taught to think every fearful image at\r\nbottom some innocent cloak or shadow, will sleep soundly and grow\r\nhealthy in mind.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, ill-health is the cause of wakefulness, other means must\r\nbe used. Cold feet, and chilly feelings generally, frequently keep\r\nchildren from sleep. Pack in such cases the lower limbs up to the waist\r\nin thick folded flannel FOMENTATION (_see_). This will often not only\r\ngive sleep, but prevent more serious trouble. All soothing powders and\r\nnarcotic drugs should be most strictly avoided.\r\n\r\nOften the child is sleepless from feverish heat instead of coldness;\r\nthen cooling applications should be used (_see_ Children in Fever).\r\nThese may take the form of two caps for the head of thickest cotton\r\ncloth: one, tight fitting, to be wrung out of cold water and put on,\r\nthe other, looser and dry, to be put on over the first. This alone will\r\noften secure a night's sleep. Or the head may be soaped (_see_ Head,\r\nSoaping). It is inadvisable to rock a child to sleep, it will go to\r\nsleep if comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Strength.--The question often arises as to the ability of\r\nchildren to bear certain kinds of treatment. It must ever be\r\nremembered, both in hot and cold applications, that the infant should\r\nbe _gently_ dealt with. Violent cold and burning heat must alike be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nWith a gentle application of heat before bracing cold is used,\r\nconsiderable power of endurance is imparted. Strong blisters and\r\nviolent medicines should never be used. Very much less treatment will\r\naffect the infant than that required for an older child. And in almost\r\nevery case the most durable cures are reached by gradual progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Swellings.--Sometimes these occur as merely relaxed tissue\r\nfull of blood. In this case everything about the part seems right and\r\nhealthy except the swelling. The skin is right and the temperature\r\nalso. Treatment such as restores nerve energy will usually cure these\r\n(_see_ Children's Nerves). In other cases the tumour will be full of\r\nwatery waste, or there may be a simple dropsical swelling owing to\r\nfailure in kidney action. This last is usually easily cured. It ought\r\nnever to be \"tapped,\" as this draws off the strength desired. A simple\r\nFOUR-PLY BANDAGE (_see_) of new flannel worn round the body will often\r\nbe enough to cure infants of even dropsical tumours. In other cases\r\nthis is used in conjunction with the bran poultice and rubbing\r\nrecommended above for cases of nerve failure.\r\n\r\nWherever the swelling is, increase the vital force that supplies the\r\ngland, and so you will cure the whole evil at its source. Many will\r\ntell you to \"purify the blood,\" but there is no blood purifier like the\r\nsystem which God himself has provided, in the organs of the body made\r\nfor the purpose. Only increase the action of these, and you will have\r\npure everything as well as pure blood. You will do it by good\r\nfomentation, by good rubbing, by judicious clothing, and also by wise\r\nfeeding. You will do it to some extent even by good kind words. You\r\nwill help the process by good, clean washing, such as warm vinegar\r\ngives over a weakened surface. You will scarcely fail to gain your end\r\nif you use these means in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Teething.--_See_ Teething.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren's Treatment.--This should always be managed so as to soothe\r\nand not excite the little patients. They are very sensitive to heat and\r\ncold. When these are applied the child often cries, so that the\r\n\"treatment\" is condemned and given up. What should be condemned is the\r\nnurse's want of skill. In every case the cold or hot application should\r\nbe so managed as to be agreeable. Very gentle heat at first may be\r\nsucceeded by stronger heat without shock. So mildly cool applications\r\nmay be followed by colder ones in the same way. There is no sense or\r\nbenefit in dashing a burning poultice or freezing towel on a delicate\r\nperson, either infant or adult, and sense is above all our guide in\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nChills.--(1) Nerve or imaginary chills. These are _feelings_ of cold,\r\nwhere there is no real chilling; the back feels as if cold water were\r\npoured down it, or even the whole body feels chilled, when an\r\nexamination will show that there is no real chill whatever. Nervous\r\npatients are peculiarly liable to this, and often are greatly alarmed\r\nat it. The treatment in such cases is partly mental; let the patient\r\nknow that the chilly feeling is only a _feeling_, and nothing alarming.\r\nThis will often of itself remove it; so will a cheery thought or a\r\ncheery talk. Physical treatment may begin with such a rubbing of the\r\nhead as is recommended in Eyes, Squinting. Then treat the whole body to\r\na gentle massage on similar principles. This will sometimes cause nerve\r\nchills at first to increase; but the patient will soon disregard this,\r\nand the squeezing very gently of the muscles will stimulate and revive\r\nthe organic nerves. Warm olive oil used in this squeezing process will\r\nhelp greatly. It may be that a considerable time will be required\r\nbefore these nerve states are entirely overcome, but with anything like\r\ncareful treatment they will gradually be so. Keep the patient warm in\r\nbed the while. Give easily assimilated food (_see_ Assimilation). A\r\nmixture of milk and _boiling_ water in equal quantities may be freely\r\ntaken. This treatment will besides greatly help nervousness of every\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n(2) In the case of _real_ chill to the surface of the body, _shivering_\r\nis an early symptom. If the frame is strong, the shiver may pass off\r\nand no evil results follow: but frequently this is not the case, and\r\ntrouble is apt to intervene. In such a case give a thorough rubbing all\r\nover the body, and especially the back and chilled part, with warm\r\nolive oil; this, if applied early enough, will probably prevent all ill\r\nconsequences,--it will at least mitigate them. If the chill has passed\r\ninto feverishness however, this treatment will not suit; but we only\r\ndeal here with the cold shivering stage. The rubbing will be greatly\r\nassisted by a good hot fomentation to the feet, or even up to the\r\nhaunches. The use of Kneipp linen underwear, by promoting a healthy\r\naction of the skin, and rapidly conducting away the perspiration from\r\nits surface, will do much to prevent chills, either real or imaginary.\r\n_See_ Angina Pectoris, Underwear, Massage.\r\n\r\n\r\nChloroform.--_See_ Child-bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCirculation of the Blood.--Nothing is more important for the health or\r\nhealing of any organ or part of the body than a good supply of arterial\r\nblood. Venous blood, collected by the veins after it has done its work\r\nall over the body, or blood stagnating in congested organs, is useless\r\nfor growth and healing. To promote a vigorous circulation of blood in\r\nany part we wish to cure is, then, of great importance; this may be\r\ndone by helping the heart in various ways, especially if that be weak.\r\nLying down, and lying comfortably on the face, greatly assists\r\ncirculation. Placing a fainting person in this position will often\r\nsuffice to restore him. In congestion of any part, if possible keep\r\nthat part,--head, hand, or foot, as the case may be--above the level,\r\nso that the escape of blood from it may be easy. _Raising_ an inflamed\r\nfinger or toe thus, and keeping it up, will often relieve severe pain.\r\nIn inflamed kidneys, make the sufferer lie on his face as much as\r\npossible. Other positions in other cases will be suggested by common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nAgain, heat expands the vessels of the body, and cold contracts them.\r\nCooling a congested part assists to drive excess of blood out of it,\r\nand heating some other part opens accommodation for the blood so\r\nexpelled. This explains our hot poultice and fomentation as used with\r\ncold cloths. Common sense will show us how to apply it as a principle\r\nof treatment in many cases.\r\n\r\nAgain, a congested limb may often be very greatly relieved by proper\r\nrubbing along the soft parts, the strokes being firm and steady, and\r\ndirected from the extremity of the limb towards the body. This rubbing\r\nalong the thigh relieves very much all swellings in the foot, ankle,\r\nleg and knee. This principle may be widely applied by a little\r\ncommon-sense thought.\r\n\r\n\r\nClimate and Soil.--The soil on which one lives is a matter of primary\r\nimportance; it may be a matter of life or death for a weakly person,\r\nbut it is important for every one. First, as regards the subsoil on\r\nwhich a house is built. If this be clay, or impervious rock, then no\r\npossible system of drainage can make the site a dry one; this condition\r\nof affairs will be very bad indeed for health. No house should be built\r\non such a soil if at all possible to avoid it. Light open gravel and\r\nsand, as subsoil, make the very best health conditions. The surface\r\nsoil is also important. If this be such that streets and garden walks\r\ndry quickly after rain, you have elements of health; if they remain\r\nlong wet, then you have elements of unhealthiness. If the soil be\r\nright, then the climate is to be considered. The mere situation of two\r\nhouses, only half a mile apart, will make all the difference in this,\r\nand should be carefully watched. A house sheltered on the south and\r\nwest, exposed to the north and east, is badly situated; the opposite\r\nexposure is usually good. Plenty of sun should fall upon the house all\r\nday, and on all sides, if that be possible. Yet it must be seen that no\r\nhollow or stagnant air be chosen; it is nearly as bad as stagnant\r\nwater, for in mild winds, dryness of soil and air, and abundant sun,\r\nlie much virtue for health and healing.\r\n\r\n\r\nClothing.--Clothing should be light yet warm, and sufficiently free so\r\nas not to interfere with bodily movements. The clothing next the skin\r\nshould, we think, be linen, as being more porous and absorbent than\r\nwool (_see_ Underwear). No woman who values her health should submit to\r\nany tight lacing. The organs of the body require every inch of space\r\nfor the proper performance of their functions, and if they are unduly\r\nsqueezed many serious complaints may result. Besides the skin is a\r\nbreathing organ, and it is most important that air should readily reach\r\nit (_see_ Tight Lacing).\r\n\r\nLong trains should not be worn, as they are most effective agents for\r\nsweeping up germs of diphtheria, consumption, etc. Skirts should not be\r\nhung from the waist, but from the shoulders, and should be light in\r\nweight. Tight boots and high heels are both to be condemned.\r\n\r\nThe practice of wearing mufflers, or any tight wrapping round the neck\r\nregion, is injurious and enervating to this part of the body. The\r\nsailor, though exposed to more rough weather than any other class, is\r\nfree from throat or chest trouble, and can stand both heat and cold\r\nbetter than soldiers. Sailors are, indeed, the only sensibly dressed\r\nmen in our country. Soldiers, in their tight-fitting tunic and stiff\r\ncollars, are the worst. They constantly die of heat and apoplexy, when\r\nfarm labourers doing more work are nothing the worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nClub Foot.--Children are not unfrequently born with this deformity in\r\none or other of its various shapes. The cause is to be sought in such a\r\ndefective state of the nervous system as hinders the proper growth of\r\nthese parts. If the nerves are treated rightly, the limbs will so grow\r\nthat the defect will disappear. We speak from positive knowledge of\r\ncases so cured.\r\n\r\nTreatment must first stimulate the spinal nerves; gentle, continued\r\nrubbing on each side of the spine with hot olive oil will do this.\r\nProceed, after some time of this, to rub and knead the haunch, thigh,\r\nand leg with the same hot oil. Continue this, gradually descending,\r\nuntil the defective foot is reached and similarly treated. We have\r\nknown even adults cured in this way, with perseverance. Ten or fifteen\r\nminutes of this treatment before a fire, or in a warm room, every\r\nnight, will do wonders. A skilful surgeon can do much to remedy this,\r\nbut one _really_ skilful should be chosen. _See_ Massage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold in the Head.--Infants often are prevented sucking by this form of\r\ncold closing up the nostrils. In such a case have a small cap of cotton\r\nto fit the head. Wring this out of cold water, and fit it on the\r\nchild's head. Put on over it a rather larger and thicker cap of the\r\nsame material. Often the nostrils will open in two or three seconds,\r\nand the cold will speedily be cured, if no more be wrong. Observe that\r\nthe child be _warm_ during this treatment. If the case is obstinate,\r\nsecure good medical aid, for constitutional weakness, or even some\r\ndeformity of the nostrils, may be present as cause, where the trouble\r\nexists from birth.\r\n\r\nFor adults similarly affected, a towel wrung out of cold water and\r\nwrapped round the head, with another _dry_ one above, will answer the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFor severe cases, pack the feet and legs in hot fomentation for an\r\nhour, and apply a cold towel as above. This last method should always\r\nbe pursued where the patient feels chilly. Cold in the head may often\r\nbe checked by use of dilute vinegar. _See_ Nostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold, Settled.--A cold is often easily overcome. At other times it\r\n\"sits down,\" as country people say, and refuses to be cured, a hard dry\r\ncough continuing for a long time, and causing sleeplessness and general\r\nweakness. In such a case first try to secure an increase generally of\r\nvital energy. At night rub the feet and legs with hot olive oil. Pack\r\nthem for three-quarters of an hour in a good _large_ blanket\r\nfomentation, open out, and dry well, oil and dry again, put on a pair\r\nof cotton stockings, and put the patient to bed. In the morning, place\r\na towel tightly wrung out of cold water all round the back and breast.\r\nCover this well with dry towels, and tuck the patient in, so that he\r\nbecomes warm and comfortable. In three-quarters of an hour open out,\r\ndry the skin, oil it and dry again. Then the ordinary clothing may be\r\nput on. The second evening it will be well to pack in the SOAPY BLANKET\r\n(_see_). Next morning the towel envelope should be repeated as before.\r\nThe third evening, put a large BRAN POULTICE (_see_) between the\r\nshoulders. While this is on apply cold to the chest, as in treatment\r\nfor BRONCHITIS (_see_). It is good to take sips of hot water at any\r\ntime if the cough is troublesome. A teaspoonful of boiled liquorice and\r\nlinseed two or three times a day has a good effect. This treatment\r\nusually cures a pretty severe case.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold, Taking.--Where cold is easily \"taken,\" it is the skin which is\r\ndefective in its action. The cure must therefore deal with it. Even\r\nspasmodic asthma can be traced to the failure of the skin to throw off\r\nwaste sufficiently. Men exposed to great heats and chills, women and\r\nchildren whose nervous energy is small, are liable to this skin\r\nfailure. Kneipp linen underwear, besides being more absorbent of\r\nperspiration than woollens, has a stimulating effect on the skin owing\r\nto a certain hardness (by no means unpleasant) of the fibre. Wearing it\r\nis an excellent preventive of skin failure (_see_ Underwear). This may\r\nalso be treated by careful, kindly rubbing over the whole body with\r\nwarm olive oil, the patient being kept warm during the operation. This\r\nrubbing may with advantage come after a sponging with M'Clinton's soap\r\n(_see_ Soap). To face the wintry blast at half-past five in the morning\r\nis for many severely trying. This treatment the night before will give\r\nimmense help to those who are so exposed. It is the best preventive\r\nagainst taking cold known to us.\r\n\r\nThere is one great difficulty that stands in the way of such a remedy\r\nas we have suggested--that is, the \"trouble\" which it implies, not so\r\nmuch to ourselves as to others. Many a useful life is lost lest\r\n\"trouble\" should be given. It needs to be well understood that this is\r\na temptation. If we can buy a quantity of some drug from a chemist\r\naccording to the prescription of some medical man, and just quietly\r\nswallow it, that \"troubles\" nobody. So powders to sweat us, and powders\r\nto stop our sweating, are readily \"taken,\" greatly to increase all\r\ntendency to \"take cold.\" Our relatives and others have, as the fruit of\r\nsuch a system, worlds of serious trouble and loss that might all be\r\nsaved if only a very little trouble were given in the more natural and\r\nreasonable way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold Cloths.--_See_ Towels, Cold Wet.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstipation.--This trouble is often only aggravated and made chronic\r\nby the use of purgatives. Some simple change of diet, such as a ripe\r\nuncooked apple, eaten before breakfast, or a fruit diet for a day or\r\ntwo may put all right. So also with the use of wheaten meal porridge or\r\nbread. When this can be taken with pure CANE SYRUP (_see_), the two\r\ntogether will make such a change in the food as will frequently banish\r\nall inaction of the bowels. Rest must be reckoned on, especially if the\r\npatient has been using purgatives freely. Do not act as if castor oil\r\nwere a necessary article of diet. When the constipation is more\r\nobstinate, in the case of a child, good golden syrup may be given, a\r\nteaspoonful after each meal. A quarter of a pound of the best Spanish\r\nliquorice, costing sixpence, should be boiled in a pint of water down\r\nto three-quarters of a pint and strained. A dessertspoonful of this\r\nafter each meal may be given instead of the treacle. It is the best\r\ntonic we know, and infinitely better than quinine and other costlier\r\ndrugs. If a stronger mixture be desired, put half-an-ounce of senna\r\nleaf in the juice while being boiled. This may be increased to a whole\r\nounce of senna if still stronger effect be desired.\r\n\r\nSome are more liable than others to attacks of constipation, but\r\nchronic constipation may generally be put down to errors in diet, or\r\nwant of sufficient exercise. Indigestible foods, such as pastry and\r\nheavy puddings, as well as foods which leave little residue in the\r\nintestine, such as white bread, puddings, arrowroot, are highly\r\nconstipating. Tea has also a similar effect, also large quantities of\r\nmeat. Constipation is seldom found in vegetarians, since vegetables and\r\nfruits act as a stimulus to the intestine. Brown bread and oatmeal\r\nporridge have also an aperient effect. If it is suspected that milk has\r\nbeen a cause of constipation in any particular case, it may be boiled\r\nand used with coffee instead of tea.\r\n\r\nMuch may be done by judicious exercise to relieve chronic constipation,\r\nand help the liver to work (_see_ Appendix; Physical Culture). Deep\r\nbreathing will also affect the intestines and urge a motion. Bathing\r\nand massage of the abdomen are also useful (_see_ Massage). Clothing\r\nshould be light and loose, tight lacing being a frequent cause of\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to keep the bowels regular, as protracted\r\nconstipation leads to many painful affections, such as headaches,\r\npiles, and even inflammation of the intestine, the various products of\r\nputrefaction being absorbed and carried through the blood stream. A\r\ndaily motion should invariably be solicited at a regular hour. On\r\nrising, before the morning bath, is a good time, though some prefer\r\njust before retiring to bed, and more, probably, go immediately after\r\nbreakfast. The great thing is to get into the habit of going daily at a\r\nfixed time; nothing should be allowed to interfere with this, and it is\r\nhighly desirable that children should be accustomed to this habit.\r\nParents should, therefore, see that the schools selected have\r\nsufficient closet accommodation, as schools in private houses often\r\nhave but the one closet for a large number. As a result of this\r\nrestricted accommodation, the habit of using aperient medicines is\r\nacquired with _very_ injurious results, for if the call of nature is\r\nneglected the desire passes away, and constipation is inevitable. It\r\nsoon comes to be a settled condition and will often be the cause of\r\nlife-long ill-health. The evils from the formation of such a physical\r\nhabit will far outweigh all the so-called accomplishments that may be\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nHot or cold water taken in sips throughout the day has often proved a\r\nmost valuable cure for constipation.\r\n\r\nWhen artificial means are required to move the bowels, an enema is much\r\nto be preferred to drugs. The way to administer it, so as to be most\r\neffective, is as follows: Use a fountain enema holding three quarts.\r\nPut into it two or three quarts of water as warm as can be comfortably\r\nborne. A teaspoonful of salt added to the water will make it more\r\neffective, or soapy water may be used, made from M'Clinton's soap. The\r\nfountain should be hung up as high above the patient as the\r\nindia-rubber tube will allow. The patient should lie on the right side,\r\nwith knees drawn up. The tube should then be introduced into the\r\nrectum, and should be three or four inches in. The water may then be\r\nturned on with the thumb valve. If the abdomen can be rubbed by an\r\nattendant in an upward direction it will be better. The water should be\r\nretained, if possible, twenty minutes or half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nA HOT FOMENTATION (_see_) over the liver, before using the enema, will\r\nmake it more effective.\r\n\r\nA bulb enema syringe may be used instead of the fountain, and less\r\nwater--a pint or even less, and the water tepid or cold, may be\r\npreferred by some. The disadvantage of a bulb syringe is however that\r\nsometimes air gets in along with the water, causing pain and\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsumption, Prevention of.--This most insidious and deadly disease is\r\ncaused by a tiny vegetable growth derived from persons or animals\r\nalready suffering from tuberculosis. The spit of consumptive patients\r\nswarms with such germs, and when it dries and becomes dust the germs\r\nmay be stirred up and breathed, or may mix with food, _e.g._, milk, and\r\nso enter the body. A dried handkerchief may also carry the infection.\r\n\r\nBut these germs, though continually carried into the lungs of almost\r\nall, do not develop in all. The healthy body can resist them, and it is\r\nonly in the body which possesses little resistance, owing to a low\r\nstate of health, that they take root, and so start the disease.\r\n\r\nWant of pure air, such as is caused by badly ventilated rooms, dark,\r\ndamp, and dirty houses, want of good food, or bad food, alcoholic\r\ndrinks, frequent illnesses, dirty habits, are powerful causes in\r\nproducing this low state of health, which is so favourable to the\r\ngrowth of the consumptive germ. Therefore we insist on fresh air,\r\nespecially for children in schools, for employees in factories, for\r\nclerks in offices. All places of public resort should be provided with\r\nproper ventilation. The breath from the lungs is loaded with poisonous\r\norganic matter, and if continually re-breathed poisons the blood. The\r\nsmell of a room is often an indication of whether the air is pure or\r\nnot, especially in the nostrils of one entering from the outer air. Let\r\nall windows be kept open day and night, and let fresh air and sunlight\r\ncontinually flood the room. Nothing will kill disease germs quicker.\r\nAvoid choosing a residence with but little open spaces around, such as\r\nbasement tenements and back to back houses. Have an open fireplace in\r\nthe room. Gas or oil for lighting, heating, or cooking renders the air\r\nimpure, and in need of constant renewal. _See_ Air.\r\n\r\nDirt, either in the house or around, poisons the air, and refuse should\r\nbe removed to a distance from the dwelling. Tea leaves should be\r\nsprinkled on floors before being swept. Remove dust with damp dusters,\r\nwhich should be boiled. Cleanliness should be strictly attended to, and\r\nschools and factories should be plentifully supplied with soap and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe food consumed by the vast majority of people is far from being as\r\nnourishing as it should be. Tea and white bread have replaced porridge\r\nand milk. This should not be. Cocoa might with advantage replace tea,\r\nand porridge and milk by itself would make a highly nutritious meal\r\n(_see_ articles on Diet).\r\n\r\nStimulants are not required by the healthy body, and intemperance is a\r\nfruitful predisposing cause of consumption. Skim milk is not a suitable\r\nfood for the young. _See_ Infants' Food.\r\n\r\nInfectious diseases, such as Typhoid and Scarlatina, are frequently\r\nconveyed by cow's milk. There is also reason to believe that in certain\r\ncases of Tuberculosis the infection has been conveyed by milk from\r\ntuberculous cows. These risks can only be absolutely avoided by\r\nsterilising the milk, _i.e._, by placing the jug in a pan of water and\r\nbringing the water to the boil, keeping it so for twenty minutes. If\r\nthe milk is kept covered, and rapidly cooled by placing in another pan\r\nof cold water, but little boiled taste will be felt. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, sterilised milk disagrees with an infant; if so, the strictest\r\nwatch must be kept on the history of the milk used.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that this disease is not hereditary. It is only\r\nthe delicacy of constitution predisposing to the disease that is\r\ninherited. This delicacy may, especially in childhood, be remedied. We\r\nhave known hundreds of tender children made strong by liberal daily\r\nMASSAGE (_see_). In all cases where hereditary weakness is feared this\r\nshould be resorted to. In many cases nothing more is needed to banish\r\nconsumption out of families than the stimulation of the skin by this\r\nmassage. Wearing linen underwear (_see_ Underwear) also assists in this\r\ndirection and prevents chills. As it is of prime importance to increase\r\nthe chest capacity, and this is most easily done in youth, great\r\nattention should be paid to chest expanding exercises (_see_ Appendix)\r\nand deep breathing. The cultivation of singing will greatly help.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsumption, Treatment of.--Turning now to the case when consumption\r\nhas actually shown itself, the above treatment is exactly the course to\r\nbe pursued. But we would emphasise the fact that unlimited fresh air\r\nand good nourishing foods are the only cure. If the patient can afford\r\nit, it is best to go to one of the Sanatoria for consumptives in order\r\nthat he may see how the fresh air cure is practically carried out. It\r\nmeans simply breathing every mouthful of air as pure as it can possibly\r\nbe obtained. Sleeping out in a hut, with the side completely open, and\r\nwith protection only from the rain, with abundance of clothing, and, if\r\nnecessary, hot-water jars to supply the required heat, is strongly\r\nrecommended, and every hour of the day, as far as possible, should be\r\nspent in the open air, reclining or taking gentle exercise.\r\n\r\nThe food should be nourishing and abundant. Plenty of milk, butter, and\r\neggs should form the basis of the diet. The strictest precautions\r\nshould be taken against spreading infection, and the patient be made to\r\nunderstand that these measures are intended not only to protect the\r\npublic and his friends, but to allow of his social intercourse with\r\nthem, and to assist his own cure. The source of danger being the spit,\r\nit should be collected in a pocket spittoon or piece of paper, and be\r\ndestroyed before it has time to dry. Spitting on floors or elsewhere is\r\nhighly dangerous. The spittoon should be boiled carefully. A\r\nconsumptive should not swallow his phlegm, as the disease may thus be\r\nconveyed to parts of the body not already infected. Kissing a\r\nconsumptive person on the lips is attended with risk, and consumptive\r\npatients should not wear a heavy moustache or beard, as the phlegm\r\ndrying on the hair is a source of danger.\r\n\r\nThe bed on which the consumptive lies should not be in a corner, but\r\nout from the wall, so as to admit of cleaning and ventilation. Curtains\r\nand carpets are dust catchers; reduce the amount of such articles as\r\nmuch as possible. In the event of a death from consumption, the room\r\noccupied by the invalid should not be used again until it has been\r\nthoroughly disinfected. The Public Health Authorities are usually ready\r\nto carry out this work. If not, the floor and woodwork should be wiped\r\nwith damp dusters, and then scoured with soap and water. If the walls\r\nare papered, the paper should be well damped, stripped off, and burnt.\r\nIf the walls have been white-washed, this should be renewed with\r\nlimewash, containing a quarter of a pound of chlorinated lime to the\r\ngallon of limewash. The quilt, pillow case, blankets, and sheets of the\r\npatient's bed should be steeped in boiling water and then washed.\r\n\r\nOften consumption is associated with wasting sores on the neck or other\r\nparts, which are extremely difficult to heal. These should be soaked in\r\nwarm weak ACETIC ACID (_see_) daily, and dressed with olive oil. They\r\nmay be greatly mitigated, if not cured, by this simple means. _See_\r\nAbscess; Bone, Diseased. The directions as to diet in cases of abscess\r\napply also to these cases. Besides such outward applications, the\r\nrubbing along each side of the spine should be applied. _See_\r\nChildren's Healthy Growth. The ARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_) may also be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe very rapid pulse, and extreme fever, which accompany advanced and\r\nrapid consumption, may often be greatly mitigated by cooling cloths\r\napplied over the heart. Sponging over the whole body with vinegar or\r\nweak ACETIC ACID (_see_) also greatly refreshes the patient. It may be\r\ndone under the bedclothes, so as to avoid all possibility of chill.\r\nCold cloths over the heart and chest, if they cause chilliness, may be\r\naccompanied with fomentation of the feet and legs.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of a consumptive should be recorded three times a day,\r\nand if above normal the patient should stay in bed till it is reduced.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature has been reduced, gentle exercise is very useful.\r\nGradually increasing walks should be taken each day.\r\n\r\n\r\nContraction of Sinews.--This often occurs at the knee, bending the\r\njoint so that the patient cannot stretch his limb or walk properly. The\r\ninjury in such a case is usually at the ends of the sinews, where they\r\nare inserted into the bone. If the limb be straightened and put up in\r\nsplints, so as to secure perfect rest, it is well to see that once\r\nevery twenty-four hours it be removed from its fastenings and treated\r\nin some way to obtain a cure. Otherwise the whole limb will harden into\r\na straight and unbendable condition, worse than its original bend. When\r\nthe fastenings are removed, then, each day, let the limb be rubbed and\r\nbathed for an hour. Treat the whole body with soaping and oil rubbing\r\n(_see_ Lather and Massage). While bathing the limb it is to be rubbed\r\nwith this soap, and the lather rubbed gently into all the skin. Rub,\r\nafter soaping and drying, with hot olive oil. Dry this off, and wrap\r\nthe limb in warm flannel. With this treatment no splints or plaster\r\njackets are at all likely to be required. The limb usually soon comes\r\nright.\r\n\r\nSometimes this contraction affects the hip joint, and causes great\r\ndistress and lameness. The upper end of the thigh bone is even\r\nsometimes drawn a little out of its proper position. For this, the\r\nmuscles of the back, and specially of the side and hip which is lame,\r\nare rubbed with gentle pressure and hot olive oil as often and as long\r\nas may be convenient. Strong fomentations are also applied for\r\nhalf-an-hour daily (_see_ Armchair Fomentation). We know of one case in\r\nwhich this treatment has cured such contraction both of the knee and\r\nhip joint. Whether the cause be rheumatism or other trouble, or an\r\ninjury, the treatment is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nConvulsions.--For an ordinary convulsive attack in the case of a child,\r\nhold the child's head over a basin and pour tepid water (blood heat, 98\r\ndeg. F.) over the head. This will usually be sufficient. If not, seat\r\nthe child in a bath of hot water nearly up to the waist. If bad,\r\nindigestible food causes the fit, give teaspoonfuls of hot water every\r\nfew minutes for some hours. If the case is obstinate, a BRAN POULTICE\r\n(_see_) may be put over the lower back, and cold towels gently pressed\r\nover the stomach and bowels.\r\n\r\nFits from children's teething are more troublesome. They may often be\r\nprevented by placing a compress wrung out of cool water along the spine\r\nwhile the infant is warm in the cradle, and changing it so as to\r\nmaintain the cooling effect. A handkerchief folded eight ply does very\r\nwell. Four or five changes may be sufficient. Rub with a little warm\r\noil when the cloth comes off. If the fits do come on, treat as above\r\ndirected for fits from indigestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCooking.--The cooking of vegetables requires particular care. The\r\nvaluable salts and other nutritive ingredients they contain are easily\r\ndissolved by water, and when they are drained, and the water thrown\r\naway, as is usually done, all this nutriment is lost. Double cooking\r\npots are easily procurable for meat, porridge, etc. These are quite\r\nsuitable for vegetables--cabbage, turnips, carrots, peas, etc. The\r\nvegetable should be placed, without water, in the inner pot; it will\r\ntake somewhat longer to cook than when boiled in the usual way. The\r\nouter vessel should be partly filled with water kept boiling. Any juice\r\nwhich comes out of the vegetable should be served in the dish along\r\nwith it. It may be thickened with a little flour and butter, or if a\r\nregular white sauce is being made, the juice should be used instead of\r\npart of the water. If no double boiler is procurable, an ordinary tin\r\ncan, inside a saucepan will serve very well. Many who consider certain\r\nvegetables indigestible, as usually prepared, will find that when\r\ncooked in this way they agree with them perfectly. The fact that the\r\ncolour of cabbage, peas, etc., is not so green as when boiled in a\r\ngreat deal of water, is not of importance, when the flavour and\r\nwholesomeness are so much increased. In stews and vegetable soups the\r\nsalts are, of course, preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCooling in Heating.--Often it is difficult to get a sufficient cooling\r\neffect by means of cold cloths without unduly chilling the patient.\r\nWhen the head has to be cooled, as in the very dangerous disease\r\nmeningitis, the effect must pass through the mass of the skull before\r\nreaching the brain. A large and long continued application is needed\r\nfor this. The surface is apt then to be overcooled before the interior\r\nof the head is affected. In such a case the surface of the head, when\r\nthe patient feels it too cold, should be gently rubbed, as directed in\r\nEyes, Squinting, until this feeling goes off. Then the cooling may be\r\nresumed. Or if rubbing be disagreeable, a warm cloth may be applied for\r\na short time, and cooling then resumed. In this way a succession of\r\n_waves_ of heating and cooling can for a long time be sent through the\r\nsurface, with good effect and no chill. The short heating restores the\r\nsurface, and does not interfere with the cooling effect reaching the\r\ninterior parts. The same principle applies to cooling any part of the\r\nbody (_see_ Bathing). Any _deep-seated_ inflammation is best reached in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the large hip-joints it is of vast importance to reach\r\ninflammatory action in parts that are not near the surface, and cold\r\ncloths, pressed constantly, produce distress in the surface, if there\r\nis no intermission in supplying them. The patient is apt to rush to the\r\nconclusion that he must just yield to be blistered, painted with\r\niodine, covered with belladonna plaster, or burned with red-hot irons!\r\nThat is, he will yield to be made a great deal worse in every respect\r\nthan he is, because he is not aware that it is quite possible to cure\r\nhim without making him worse even for a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoughs.--These will be found treated under the various heads of Colds,\r\nBronchitis, Consumption, etc., but some particular cases of _mere\r\ncough_ demand special attention. A tickling cough sometimes comes on,\r\nand seems to remain in spite of all efforts to get rid of it. It is\r\nworse at night, and keeps the sufferer from sleeping, causing much\r\ndistress. Where the breathing organs are weak, this cough is caused by\r\nan extra flow of blood to them, especially on lying down, the blood\r\nacting as an irritant by pressing where it should not. In such cases a\r\nBRAN POULTICE (_see_) applied as directed for Bronchitis, with cooling\r\napplications to the part where the tickling is felt, should soon effect\r\na cure. _See_ Restlessness.\r\n\r\nWe had a case lately in which these features were very marked. It\r\nseemed as if the patient had caught cold and this was showing itself in\r\nsevere and alarming coughing. The skin was yellow, and there were other\r\nsigns of failure in the organs that purify the blood. Irritating\r\nsubstances were passing into the lungs because of failure in the liver\r\nand kidneys, and not from anything in the lungs themselves. In such\r\ncases the cough is merely a way of throwing off everything which ought\r\nnot to be in the breathing organs.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is very simple. Let the patient take about three\r\ntablespoonfuls of hot water every ten minutes for four hours. Before\r\nthese four hours are expired, the substances causing irritation will be\r\nso diluted that they will cease to irritate, and the organs failing to\r\ndo their duty will be in full working order.\r\n\r\n\r\nCramp in the Limbs.--The treatment of this is to apply cold cloths to\r\nthe roots of the nerves which govern the affected limb or limbs. For\r\nthe legs, the cold is applied to the lower spine; for the arms or\r\nhands, it is applied to the upper part. The limbs affected should also\r\nbe rubbed briskly with the hands, or a rough towel. Often the\r\nirritating heat causing the cramp is in but a small part of the spine,\r\nand the whole body is cold, or at least too chilly to make the cold\r\ncloths a pleasant cure. In such a case FOMENTATION (_see_) of the feet\r\nand legs will supply sufficient heat to make the cure by cold pleasant\r\nand safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCramp in the Stomach.--This very severe trouble, though resisting\r\nordinary methods of treatment, is not difficult to cure by right means.\r\nIf help is at hand, the patient may be placed in a shallow bath, and\r\ncold water splashed with a sponge or towel against the back. A bad case\r\nhas been cured with two minutes of this treatment. After it, the\r\npatient must be well dried and put to bed.\r\n\r\nWhen help is not available, a substitute for the cold splashing is a\r\nthick cold compress, the length of the spine, which must be laid on the\r\nbed, and the patient lie down on it. This must be changed when it grows\r\nhot, and a few changes usually give relief.\r\n\r\nPersons who are suffering have often very strong prejudices. For\r\nexample, one who has decided most firmly that he \"cannot do at all with\r\nanything cold,\" is suffering from cramp, and nothing but cold will\r\nrelieve him, but you must not even hint at any such application. You\r\nmust in such a case consider how this prejudice took its rise. You will\r\nprobably find that cold has been unskilfully applied to this patient,\r\nand bad effects have been produced, not by the cold, but by its\r\nunskilful application. For instance, in a case of cramp the irritation\r\nand excess of heat may be both confined to a very small space, no more\r\nthan that which is filled by the root of one nerve; the rest of the\r\nbody may be cold rather than hot. There is need first that this general\r\ncold should be dealt with, and a general heat produced by some means or\r\nother. This is usually best done by packing feet and legs in a hot\r\nblanket fomentation. But this again is not an easy matter when cramp\r\nprevails. If you move the limbs in the least the cramp comes on, and\r\nthe patient screams with pain. Still, you need not be defeated; you can\r\nlet the limbs lie, and heat them from above by placing the hot blanket\r\nover them as they lie. As soon as you get heat raised in the body\r\ngenerally, by some such means as this, you are safe enough to apply all\r\nthe cold that is needed. That may be so little that a common\r\npocket-handkerchief will be enough. This wrung out of cold water, and\r\nfolded so as to cover about three inches square of the lower part of\r\nthe spine, may be gently pressed. If this is really well done, there\r\nwill be no shivering from the cold, and there probably will be a\r\ncessation of the cramp. The one thing wanted is that the cold cloth\r\nshall be placed right over the root of the nerve which is irritated,\r\nand consequently overheated. The prejudice is thus overcome, and it is\r\nseen that cold is not to be absolutely avoided, because it has been\r\nonce or twice, or many times, wrongly applied.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the cramp returning, means must be adopted to increase vital\r\nenergy in the system. Entire mental rest for an hour after meals must\r\nbe taken. If the patient says \"I cannot get this,\" then he simply will\r\nsoon have to give up all work, and perhaps narrowly escape a departure\r\nfrom this working world altogether.\r\n\r\nEach morning before rising, the compress should be applied as above for\r\na short time; the back should then be rubbed with hot olive oil before\r\ndressing. This treatment, and proper rest, will prevent return of the\r\ncramp. If the patient falls asleep on the compress, allow this sleep to\r\ncontinue unbroken: it is invaluable. So also is the avoidance of all\r\nanxious thought, which is best secured by complete trust in a loving\r\nGod and Saviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCroup, Less Serious Form.--The less serious croup proceeds from a\r\nnervous closing of the windpipe, the attack being brought on by any\r\ncauses of irritation in the nervous system. In this case, when the fit\r\nreaches a certain stage, the throat opens, and breathing proceeds as\r\nusual. This croup is a cramp of the windpipe; the cramp is caused by an\r\nirritation of the nerves controlling it, which are already in a\r\ncondition to be easily irritated. The cure is to apply cooling cloths\r\nto the spine. Take the child warm in bed in the morning, and rub the\r\nlittle back with warm olive oil. Ring out a towel of _cool_, not quite\r\ncold, water; fold this into a narrow compress, and place it along the\r\nspine; place a dry towel above it and wrap up warm. Change for a fresh\r\ncool towel in two or three minutes. If the child falls asleep on this,\r\nleave him till he wakes voluntarily. Rub the back again with oil before\r\ndressing. The cooling may continue for an hour or so. If this treatment\r\nfail, the child may be given medicine to produce vomiting, which\r\nfrequently relieves. Before putting to bed at night wash the child all\r\nover with plenty of M'Clinton's SOAP (_see_), dry and rub over with\r\nwarm olive oil. Continue this treatment for some days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCroup, More Serious Form.--This is caused by an accumulation of\r\nmaterial in the windpipe, which is coughed up in pieces of pipe-like\r\nsubstance, and which, if not removed, threatens suffocation. For\r\ntreatment, first give sips of hot water (distilled water is best)\r\nfrequently. We have seen only five teaspoonfuls of this taken by a\r\nchild followed by the throwing off of such a quantity of matter from\r\nthe throat as had nearly caused suffocation. The further treatment is\r\nthe bran poultice between the shoulders, and cold cloths on the chest,\r\nas prescribed in the article on Bronchitis. These may not cure in all\r\ncases, but will do so in many apparently otherwise hopeless. The moment\r\nthe symptoms are perceived, treatment should be begun, as this disease\r\nis very rapid in its progress.\r\n\r\nWhen an actual attack of croup of this kind comes on, and is severe, it\r\nis usual to put the child in a warm bath. If the water is a little\r\nbelow blood heat, and laved on the back, this will go far to relieve;\r\nbut it will not have a tenth of the effect which a cold towel will\r\nhave, if placed along the spine. It is indeed wonderful how spasms and\r\nthe various forms of cramp give way to this. When a little warm olive\r\noil is first rubbed on and then off, there is no danger of cold or of\r\nany bad effect (_see_ Cramp in Stomach). If this croup is obstinate,\r\nthere may be more serious disease of the throat, and good medical\r\nadvice should be had.\r\n\r\n\r\nCures Losing their Effect.--After a fortnight's treatment often matters\r\nseem to come to a standstill in a case, and then the attendants are apt\r\nto despair. Such a state of things indicate only the need for some\r\nchange in treatment, or perhaps for a rest from treatment for some\r\ndays. Common sense must guide, and the case may be more keenly looked\r\ninto: it may have changed its character in the time that has passed,\r\nand different treatment require to be given. It is well not to give up\r\nuntil all has been tried which in any way seems likely to suit the\r\ncase. All the various articles bearing on it should be carefully read\r\nand pondered, and no doubt the way to change the treatment will open\r\nup. _See_ Changing Treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCures, as Self-Applied.--Often young people in lodgings are in\r\ndifficulty for want of some one to apply the necessary treatment in\r\ntheir own case. It is often, however, possible to treat oneself quite\r\nsuccessfully by exercising care and common sense. Help should always be\r\ngot if possible, but where it cannot, it may be done without. In the\r\ncase of applying cold cloths to any part, when it is necessary to\r\nchange these frequently, a basin of cold water may stand by the bedside\r\nso that the patient can wring out towels without getting up. A still\r\nbetter plan is to have several towels wrung out to begin with--these\r\nmay be hung over a rail or chairs until required. When the first has\r\nbeen heated it must be hung over the rail or chair so as to be as much\r\nspread out as possible. Evaporation will then cool it sufficiently to\r\nbe used when its turn comes again. Each towel is to be treated in a\r\nsimilar way in turn. Four towels will give an hour's cooling with very\r\nlittle trouble in this way. So a bran poultice may be prepared and laid\r\non the bed, so that one can lie down on it, and with the cold towels\r\nhandy, as above, most effective treatment given. Common sense is the\r\nguide here, as everywhere in our treatment, and a little thought will\r\nsolve difficulties at first apparently insoluble.\r\n\r\n\r\nDamp Beds.--An ordinary bed which has not been slept in for some weeks,\r\nalthough perfectly dry to begin with, will _become_ damp, even in a dry\r\nhouse, and, unless properly dried, will be a great danger to its next\r\noccupant. This is a preventable danger, and all who entertain guests\r\nshould see that they are not exposed to it. Many a fatal illness is due\r\nto the culpable carelessness of those who put a guest into such a bed.\r\nIgnorance in such a matter is shameful. All who have charge in a house\r\nshould fully understand their responsibility in this matter.\r\n\r\nBut if you are put into such a bed it is infinitely better to rise and\r\ndress, and make the best of a night of discomfort, than to sleep among\r\nthe damp. If, however, you have so slept, and feel the bad effect, the\r\nbest cure will be the SOAPY BLANKET (_see_). If this cannot be had, a\r\ngood hot footbath, with the heat kept just comfortable for half-an-hour\r\nor more, will do very well. This should be done at the earliest\r\npossible moment.\r\n\r\nIt will add greatly to the efficiency of such treatment if hot water\r\ncan be had to drink in small quantities, and often. A few drops of\r\ncayenne \"tea\" in the water will act as a gentle stimulant.\r\nOld-fashioned folk place great confidence in a \"hot drink\" in such a\r\ncase. This is all very well if they only keep the alcohol out of it:\r\nthat destroys vital resources, but never supplies them. We have known\r\ncases in which all power was lost through a single night in a damp bed.\r\nPossibly in these cases it might not have been easy to restore the lost\r\nvitality by any amount of treatment; but we rather think that a speedy\r\napplication of genial heat all over would have restored it. In some\r\napparently hopeless instances it has done so.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeafness.--_See_ Hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecline.--_See_ Consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeclining Limb, A.--_See_ Limbs, Drawn up.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelirium in Fever.--The best way of treating this truly distressing\r\nsymptom is by cooling and soothing applications to the head. We have\r\nseen in one case large cool cloths applied to the head for some time\r\nevery three hours or so. An almost immediate cessation of the delirium\r\nfollowed this application, and it only returned a few minutes before\r\nthe time for the next cooling. If the pulse becomes rather slow than\r\nrapid, and the body rather cool than hot, while delirium still\r\ncontinues, then hot cloths may be applied to the head. When either hot\r\nor cold appliances are removed, rub olive oil into the roots of the\r\nhair, and dry off.\r\n\r\nAn excellent treatment is also to cover the whole head with soap\r\nlather. _See_ Head, Soaping.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the state of the patient determines the\r\ntreatment. If he is hot, cold treatment is required. If he is cool or\r\nchilly, then give the warm treatment. If he _changes_ from hot to cold,\r\nthen alter the treatment accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn some diseases delirium occurs, not because of fever, but because of\r\npoisonous elements in the blood supplied to the brain. This is the case\r\nin liver and kidney troubles, when waste products are not got rid of by\r\nthese organs as they should be.\r\n\r\nTo get these organs to work, the best thing is to drink half a\r\nteacupful of hot water every ten minutes for two hours at a time. Do\r\nthis once a day for two days. Probably it will cause purging, but that\r\nis part of the cure. If the case does not yield in any way to this, a\r\nlarge hot bran poultice should be placed over the whole of the _right_\r\nside under the arm, from the spine right round to the breast-bone\r\n(_see_ Bran Poultice). This should be renewed if necessary, so as to\r\nkeep up the heat for an hour. Next day place a similar poultice over\r\nall the lower part of the back, so as to help the kidneys and bowels.\r\nDry after these poultices, and rub gently with warm olive oil. The\r\ndelirium will usually yield to a few days of such treatment. We have\r\nseen the reason under such treatment return with a rapidity that\r\nastonished the medical attendant. He had given the patient three months\r\nto gain what was complete in less than one. _See_ Fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression.--This is usually a bodily illness, though often regarded as\r\nmental only. It appears in loss of interest in all that otherwise would\r\nbe most interesting. A mother loses interest in her children, a man in\r\nhis business, and so on. Students, and children overpressed at lessons,\r\nare apt to suffer from it. It is simply the result of a drain of energy\r\nfrom the system, until the brain has an insufficient supply. Those who\r\nhave the care of the young would do well to watch carefully against\r\nthis state coming on. If it appears, all work should be given up, and\r\nas much play take its place as possible. No cramming of ideas into a\r\nweakening mind can ever be equal to the possession of health and\r\nenergy, as a preparation for life.\r\n\r\nTreatment should be such as to restore energy. The whole back should be\r\nfomented with a large blanket fomentation, being rubbed with olive oil\r\nbefore and after. Let this be done for an hour in the morning; in the\r\nevening give the ARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_). Carry this on for a\r\nweek, and then rest for another week, only rubbing the back with a\r\nlittle hot olive oil each night. Cultivate open-air life; sleep as much\r\nas possible--eight hours at least, or better nine. Carefully prepared\r\nand easily digested food should be given, and change of company, scene,\r\nand climate are most effective helps; but rest from work is the chief\r\nmatter. _See_ Restlessness and Worry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiabetes.--There are two more or less distinct stages of this serious\r\ntrouble; the first stage is generally curable, the second stage\r\ngenerally incurable. Yet good natural means of cure will very much\r\nalleviate even the incurable stage. The earlier as well as the later\r\nstages are marked by extreme _thirst_. This, in the case of some poor\r\nsufferers, is enormous. Gallons of water are taken, and the more is\r\ntaken the more is wanted. But this thirst is not the effect of heat, as\r\nfever thirst is. It cannot be quenched by means of cold cloths often\r\nchanged over the stomach, as fever thirst can. A sufferer in this\r\ndisease will set a large pitcher down at the bedside to serve for the\r\nnight, and drink it all before morning; but there is no extra heat\r\nanywhere to account for this. The thirst is more like that which is\r\ncaused by eating very salt food. It points to the character of the\r\njuices which are affecting the stomach, and not to any heated condition\r\nof the stomach itself. The drinking is a desperate effort to dilute\r\nthese juices; and, at least by cold water, that cannot be done. A\r\nwineglassful of hot water taken every ten minutes for an hour, or two\r\nhours, or three, or ten hours, as is felt to be comfortable, will do\r\nwonders in the early stages of this disease. This water, when taken at\r\nthe right heat, at once mixes with the strongly concentrated juices of\r\nthe stomach, and causes them to be easily managed by that and other\r\norgans. It is truly wonderful what this very simple remedy will effect\r\nby itself alone. The next thing to be noticed is the excessive hunger.\r\nThe food, whatever it may be, fails to quell this hunger. Here, again,\r\nit is clearly the stomach with which we have to do. When the hunger is\r\ndeveloped we should think the case further advanced than when thirst\r\nalone is experienced. The hot water meets this symptom as it meets the\r\nother. It is also of the very greatest moment to give right food.\r\nOatmeal and buttermilk steeped together for a time and then moderately\r\nboiled, a very little salt or sugar being added, produces a food which\r\nwe do not expect to see excelled by the most costly that can be got\r\nanywhere. Wheaten meal, or barley meal, will do as well as, and perhaps\r\nin some cases better than, oatmeal, but these may be chosen according\r\nto taste. The chief thing is the ease with which this food is converted\r\ninto a large supply of the best of blood for all purposes of\r\nnourishment. Food containing much starchy matter, as white bread, rice,\r\nand all sugar, must be forbidden. To make up for this, an abundance of\r\nfat should be consumed. The bowels should be kept open by a suitable\r\ndiet and exercise.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the excessive urinary discharge which is so strong a\r\nfeature of this disease. The body seems as if it were melting away in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWe can benefit the kidneys vastly through acting on the liver, as well\r\nas on themselves. By a large hot bran poultice over the liver we can\r\nadd new life to that, and whatever does so tends to benefit the\r\nkidneys. After using this large poultice, with plenty of oil rubbed on\r\nbefore and after, say three or four times, place it over the kidneys\r\nand use it as often there. If the heat is well kept up for an hour at a\r\ntime, one poultice a day would do, but, if the patient desires it,\r\ntwice a day will be all the better. It is good to do the best that can\r\nbe done with the skin. By means of soap and oil rubbing, and the\r\ncleansing effects of diluted acetic acid, very considerable help may be\r\ngained. Good can be done by a hot fomentation of the feet and legs to\r\nthe knees, with oiling after, so as to have these extremities in a\r\ncomfortable state. Tea, coffee, and sugar _must be avoided_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea.--Sudden attacks of this, though in a mild form, are very\r\ntroublesome. An enema of _cold_ water is in such cases often an\r\nimmediate cure. The first injection may be followed by even an\r\nexcessive motion, but if a second cold injection be given this will\r\ncease. But in more troublesome cases, where the patient is an infant,\r\nor very weak, this is not applicable. For such cases, mix equal\r\nquantities of honey and lemon juice (one or two teaspoonfuls of each),\r\nand add enough boiling water to dilute it for taking. Give this three\r\nor even four times a day. It will usually and speedily cure, and is\r\nrelished by infants.\r\n\r\nOften the cause of diarrhoea in infants is the infection of milk by\r\nflies (_see_ British Cholera), or from dirty feeding bottles. Bottles\r\nwith tubes should _never_ be used. The india-rubber teat should be\r\nsmelt to see that it is perfectly sweet and clean before the bottle is\r\nfilled. Unsuitable or too rich food will bring this trouble on.\r\n\r\nA tablespoonful of blackberry (or brambleberry as it is also called)\r\njelly may be given--it is a powerful and simple remedy. In adults, a\r\ndose of castor oil, with a few drops of laudanum in it, will probably\r\nremove all trouble, if it be due to nothing more than indigestible\r\nfood. Where the cold enema is dreaded, one of hot thin starch, with\r\nfifteen drops of laudanum in it, may be used for adults.\r\n\r\nStale vegetable or animal food, also impure water, are fruitful sources\r\nof diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nThe mind has a great effect on this trouble, anxiety and worry are\r\nfrequent causes. _See_ Worry. A comfortable seat by the fire, and an\r\ninteresting book, will often relieve.\r\n\r\nWhen the diarrhoea is very serious, use the four-ply flannel bandage.\r\n_See_ Bandage; British Cholera; Dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet.--The composition of different articles of food varies. A turnip\r\nis not the same as a piece of cheese. It is more watery, and has more\r\nfibre in it, and we speak of it as less nutritious. There are, however,\r\nin almost all foods certain chemical substances present which have\r\ndifferent duties to perform in the body, and which are present in\r\nwidely different proportions in the various articles we use for food.\r\n\r\n_Water_ is the most common of these substances. Soups, vegetables,\r\nfruits, puddings, are largely water. Some foods contain less of it than\r\nothers, but on the whole a very large, if not the largest, part of all\r\nfood consists of water. This large amount is needed. Water makes up\r\ntwo-thirds of the body, and nearly two quarts are given off daily in\r\nthe various excretions and secretions. If enough be not taken the\r\ntissues get dry, and Nature indicates her want in thirst.\r\n\r\nAnother of these substances is _starch_, or its equivalent, sugar.\r\nRice, bread, and vegetables in general, are largely made up of this\r\nstarchy or sugary substance, which, as it contains a considerable\r\nquantity of carbon, we speak of as the _carbonaceous_ element in food.\r\nThis is the substance which goes to feed the muscles, replacing the\r\nwaste from work done, just as fuel is required for the fires of an\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nYet another substance in food is _fat_. It may be animal, such as beef\r\nor mutton fat, and butter, or vegetable, as the oils in nuts, in the\r\nolive, etc. Fat, like carbonaceous food, also goes to feed the muscles,\r\nbut both are required in a healthy diet.\r\n\r\nOf the first importance, however, is the _proteid_ element in food.\r\nMeat, milk, cheese, eggs, peas, etc., contain proteid in considerable\r\nquantities. Its use is to repair the exhausted tissues themselves. The\r\nmuscles and nerves get worn out in their daily work, and require\r\nrebuilding. This is what proteid goes to do, and from this, its high\r\nimport in animal economy, is called Proteid (protos--first). Finally,\r\nin all natural foods there are certain _salts_, which also build up,\r\n_e.g._, lime, which goes to make up bone. These salts may be seen in\r\nthe ash of any common vegetable after being burnt.\r\n\r\nThese four kinds of food substance make up our daily food, and a\r\ncertain amount of each substance is required to replace the daily\r\nexpenditure, a proportion which varies, however, under different\r\ncircumstances. _See_ Food in Health.\r\n\r\nAs the relative amount of proteid, carbonaceous matter, water, and\r\nsalts, may vary considerably in different articles, we rightly have\r\ncombinations of food at our meals. A pudding of corn-flour and water\r\ncontains no building material, hence we add milk and eggs, which do. A\r\nmeal of meat and cheese requires bread and potatoes, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAppetite is a good test of the amount and also of the particular kind\r\nof food required, provided the appetite is in a healthy condition. If a\r\nhealthy man refrain from carbonaceous foods for a day or so, he feels a\r\ngreat longing for them, a sign that the body really needs them. It is\r\nof immense importance, then, that the appetite should not be accustomed\r\nto over-indulgence, for then it is no guide in our selection of foods\r\n(_see_ Appetite). If disease indicates such over-indulgence, food\r\nshould be restricted till the appetite is accustomed to a smaller diet.\r\nBilious people, for example, may have accustomed their appetite to\r\ndesire more carbonaceous and fatty foods than necessary. On the\r\ncontrary, badly-fed people often require a coaxing of the appetite to\r\neat strengthening foods, such as oatmeal, cheese, and brown bread.\r\n\r\nIn order to regulate our diet, it is of importance to have some idea of\r\nthe composition of common articles of food. We get our food, as\r\neverybody knows, from the vegetable and animal kingdoms. The majority\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon race live on a diet of animal and vegetable\r\ncombined, but many exclude flesh from their diet. In Southern Asia, for\r\nexample, the vast bulk of the people rarely, or never, touch meat. The\r\nvegetable kingdom supplies us largely with the carbonaceous or\r\nmuscle-forming food, whereas the animal kingdom is rich in proteid, or\r\ntissue-forming food. Much proteid, however, can be obtained from the\r\nvegetable kingdom--peas, beans, lentils, dried fruits, and nuts being\r\nparticularly rich in it. We should endeavour to cultivate an appetite\r\nfor these vegetables containing proteid, as it is a great mistake to\r\nrely entirely for this element on meat, as so many of our race do. The\r\nanimal products--such as cheese, milk, and eggs--will also form an\r\nefficient substitute for much flesh-food. This simple diet suits both\r\nthe brain-worker and the athlete, though each will have to make a\r\nselection of those foods most required by him. Certainly much animal\r\nfood is liable to produce kidney disease, gout, and kindred troubles.\r\nIf we have a tendency to corpulence (and many have this in advancing\r\nyears), to resort to an exclusive meat diet will produce these\r\ntroubles. Far better abstain from vegetables, such as potatoes, and\r\nfrom sweet dishes, pastry, etc., and eat largely of the green-leaf\r\nvegetables and fruits with the articles of a simple diet which build\r\nbut do not fatten the body. (_See_ Diet and Corpulence; Diet for Middle\r\nAge, and the Aged.)\r\n\r\nFruit is a very useful article of food. The acid helps to keep the\r\nblood alkaline (which alkalinity is necessary for the normal\r\nperformance of its functions). It prevents acidity of the stomach. The\r\ndried fruits, such as dates, figs, raisins, are very rich in proteid.\r\nNuts also are rich in proteid and in fat; they require, however,\r\ncareful mastication. Mills can be purchased cheaply for grinding nuts;\r\nthe ground meal, either alone or made into a cream, forms a delicious\r\nadjunct to stewed fruit.\r\n\r\nGreen vegetables are a much neglected food. The salts they contain are\r\nvery useful. They require careful cooking. A cabbage boiled in the\r\nordinary way loses in the water its valuable salts. In case of\r\nflatulence arising from indigestion, the use of vegetables may,\r\nhowever, require to be restricted, at least for a time. Some vegetables\r\nare palatable raw, such as salads and celery. Indeed, raw vegetables\r\nhave a tonic effect on the bowels.\r\n\r\nBread should never be too fresh, and should be thoroughly chewed.\r\nZwieback (twice baked) can be recommended, especially for those who\r\nsuffer from indigestion. It is made by cutting bread, preferably\r\nwheaten, in thin slices, and putting these in a slow oven till\r\nthoroughly dry and lightly browned. Wholemeal bread should always be\r\npresent on the table, as its use prevents constipation. Indian corn can\r\nbe made into a number of palatable cakes, and is a very nutritious\r\nfood. Home-made jam and honey are digestible forms of sugar, but like\r\nall sugar foods should be consumed in moderation, especially by\r\nsedentary individuals. Condiments should be avoided, the healthy\r\nappetite is better without them, and they irritate the stomach.\r\n\r\nRegarding animal foods, they are often spoilt by over-cooking, and it\r\nshould be remembered that when lightly done they are easiest to digest.\r\nWhite fish, tender steak, or juicy joint and cutlet are superior to the\r\noily fish, and kidney, liver, and heart. These internal organs should\r\nbe avoided, as they contain even more than the rest of the animal\r\ncertain extracts liable to produce URIC ACID (_see_). Milk, cheese,\r\neggs, and butter are not open to these objections. Cheese is a food\r\nvery rich in proteid. It requires careful chewing, and may with\r\nadvantage be grated before use. Buttermilk is a valuable and\r\nstrengthening food. A generation or so ago the Scotch peasants lived\r\nalmost exclusively on buttermilk and oatmeal, and were a magnificent\r\ntype of men in every respect. Whey is a pleasant drink, and may be made\r\na substitute for tea where the latter is prohibited. It is also\r\nbeneficial for the kidneys. Jellies are a pleasant addition to the diet\r\nof convalescents, but have little nutritive value.\r\n\r\nWe would strongly urge upon our readers the advantages of simple diet.\r\nWe mean by this the avoidance of all those rich and spiced dishes which\r\nare made up in so many ways to tempt the appetite, of alcohol in every\r\nform, of meat to the extent often consumed by the well-to-do, of pastry\r\nand such indigestible food as heavy cakes, of fried food in general;\r\nand, on the other hand, the adoption of a diet largely consisting of\r\nmilk, cheese, eggs, butter, cereals, root and green vegetables, fruits,\r\nand nuts. It will not be found an expensive diet; on the contrary, it\r\nis remarkably cheap; it will give little trouble, for but little\r\ncooking will be needed. It may require some little effort at first, and\r\nsome breakings with social customs, but far less of both than will be\r\nimagined. Seeing that a large part of disease is ultimately traceable\r\nto a rich and stimulating diet, and to too much food in general,\r\nsimplicity is imperative on all who seek for the preservation of\r\nhealth. Eat less, eat better (or more slowly, with perfect\r\nmastication), eat simpler foods at your meals, eat at these meals only\r\nwhen you require it, and never between your meals. Such eating will\r\nensure good digestion, good assimilation, good blood, and good health.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet and Corpulence.--A tendency to obesity should always be carefully\r\nchecked by attention to diet and exercise (_see_ Exercise). The\r\nfattening foods are those which contain either fat or carbonaceous\r\nsubstances. Carbonaceous substances are found in bread, sugar,\r\narrowroot, puddings in general, pastry, potatoes. The fats, such as\r\nbutter, cream, and animal fat, should be much restricted in their use.\r\nAs we have above indicated, however, it is not wise, as many corpulent\r\npeople do in their efforts to get rid of this superabundance of fat, to\r\nmake up for their restriction by an increase in the quantity of meat\r\nconsumed. Cheese, peas, beans, buttermilk, and oatmeal might with\r\nadvantage be drawn upon instead. At the same time, if the circulation\r\nis good it is well with such proteid diet to increase the amount of\r\nwater drunk during the day, as this helps to eliminate the waste which\r\nwould otherwise overtax the kidneys. Green vegetables and fruits should\r\nform a large part of the diet.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that it is dangerous to strike out at once all\r\nfattening foods from the diet; many have injured their health\r\npermanently by such injudicious haste, and brought on floating kidneys,\r\netc. Remember, also, that exercise is a much safer reducer of fat than\r\na very great reduction in diet, unless there has been a decided\r\ntendency to continually overeat. All alcoholic beverages must be\r\nstrictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet for the Lean.--To a large extent the preceding article will\r\nsuggest what is suitable here, remembering, however, that regular\r\nexercise will be also necessary in order to enable the muscles to\r\nincrease in size. Green vegetables and fruits should be largely used in\r\naddition to the carbonaceous foods, as their FOOD SALTS (_see_) are\r\nnecessary to keep the blood in a condition to allow of proper\r\nassimilation. In the case of nervous and consumptive patients, the more\r\ndigestible forms of fat, such as cream and butter, are to be\r\nrecommended. Some thin people do not seem able to assimilate much fat.\r\nThese cases will do better on a smaller quantity. Remember always that\r\nit is not what is eaten, but what is assimilated, that goes to increase\r\nthe weight, therefore if any particular food is found, after a careful\r\ntrial, to constantly disagree, it must be accepted that for that one at\r\nall events, it is not a suitable article of diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet for Middle Age and the Aged.--In advancing years when less\r\nexercise is, as a rule, taken, a restriction in the amount of food\r\nconsumed is highly desirable. The increasing corpulence, which often\r\nbegins to show itself from 30 to 40, is far from being a healthy sign;\r\nindeed, is often the premonitory symptom of serious disease. It should\r\nbe remembered that a lessening quantity of food is required from middle\r\nlife on. This applies to all the elements of food. It is noticeable\r\nthat a fat person seldom lives to old age, most octogenarians being\r\nthin and wiry, and almost all attribute their long life to increasing\r\nwatchfulness over their health, and largely over what they eat.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is young and taking active exercise, a good deal of\r\nsurplus food can be worked off, and if the excess be too great, a\r\nbilious attack tends to prevent any more being taken, for a time at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nBut as we get on in life, the surplus food, if much is eaten, is\r\ndeposited in various parts of the body as fatty or gouty accumulations.\r\nThe liver becomes deranged, and loss of health and strength are at once\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nIt is then, as Sir Henry Thompson has well pointed out, that the fond\r\nbut foolish wife often does her husband incalculable harm by her\r\nefforts to \"keep up his system.\" She urges and tempts him to take more\r\nfood, fetching him, between meals, cups of beef-tea, soup, or cocoa,\r\nwhen he really would be greatly the better of total abstinence from all\r\nfood for several days. What we have said about appetite being the best\r\nguide applies to the old especially, and if they could but realize what\r\na very small quantity of food is necessary, they would not be perturbed\r\nto find that their appetite guided them to eat very much less than at a\r\nyounger age.\r\n\r\nMilk, which is the ideal food for the very young, is for that reason\r\noften undesirable for the old, and it is a great mistake for such to\r\ndrink much of it with solid food.\r\n\r\nDiet for the very aged becomes mainly a question of invalid diet, and\r\nit must be remembered that much should be granted to the individual's\r\nchoice and liking. All foods for the aged should be light and easily\r\ndigested, and careful attention paid to proper cooking.\r\n\r\nA striking example of lost health recovered and life and activity\r\nprolonged to a great age, by strict temperance in food, is Cornaro, a\r\nVenetian nobleman of the sixteenth century, who lived over 100 years.\r\nHe says:--\"Our kind mother Nature, in order that old men may live to\r\nstill greater age, has contrived matters so that they should be able to\r\nsubsist on little, as I do, for large quantities of food cannot be\r\ndigested by old and feeble stomachs. By always eating little, the\r\nstomach, not being much burdened, need not wait long to have an\r\nappetite. It is for this reason that dry bread relishes so well with\r\nme.... When one arrives at old age, he ought to divide that food of\r\nwhich he was accustomed to make but two meals into four, and as in his\r\nyouth he made but two collations in a day, he should in his old age\r\nmake four, provided he lessen the quantity as his years increase. And\r\nthis is what I do, agreeably to my own experience; therefore my\r\nspirits, not oppressed by much food, but barely kept up, are always\r\nbrisk, especially after eating, nor do I ever find myself the worse for\r\nwriting immediately after meals, nor is my understanding ever clearer,\r\nor am I apt to be drowsy, the food I take being in too small a quantity\r\nto send up fumes to the brain. Oh, how advantageous it is for an old\r\nman to eat but little! Accordingly, I, who know it, eat but just enough\r\nto keep body and soul together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDigestion.--Digestion is the process whereby the food we eat is turned\r\ninto material fit to be assimilated by the blood. It begins in the\r\nmouth by the mechanical grinding and crushing of the food, and the\r\nchemical conversion of the starchy part into sugar, in which form alone\r\nit can be assimilated. This conversion is carried out by the saliva.\r\nHence the necessity for thorough mastication, even of sloppy foods that\r\ndo not seem to require it, and for attention to the teeth in order that\r\nthey may thoroughly chew. Alcohol and tobacco, as they spoil the\r\nsaliva, are very unfavourable to digestion, and should always be\r\navoided. Twenty minutes longer to chew one's dinner is worth a whole\r\nbox of pills, and no one need expect good digestion who neglects\r\nthorough chewing and salivation of the food. This may, with advantage,\r\nbe increased to an extent which most people would think quite absurd.\r\nIt has been proved that when all food is chewed until completely\r\nreduced to a liquid, its nutritive qualities are so increased that\r\nabout half as much will suffice. This is of immense importance in all\r\ncases of weak digestion, or indeed whenever an absence of vigorous\r\nhealth renders the economy of vital energy important.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Digestive System.]\r\n\r\nIn the stomach the food meets with the gastric juice, which has the\r\nproperty of turning proteid (_see_ Diet for the various substances\r\ncontained in food) into material ready for assimilation. The walls of\r\nthe stomach are muscular, and their contraction churns the food with\r\nthe juice. The gastric juice is secreted by glands embedded in the\r\nwalls of the stomach, and is poured out when food is taken.\r\n\r\nThe whole food, now in the form of a paste, passes into a pipe about 12\r\ninches long (the Duodenum), into which pours the secretion of the\r\npancreas and that of the liver (bile). The pancreatic juice acts upon\r\nthe starch which has escaped the action of the saliva, and also\r\ncontinues the work of the stomach. It furthermore emulsifies the fat or\r\ndivides it into extremely fine drops.\r\n\r\nThe food passes now into a long coiled pipe--the small intestine. This\r\nsecretes the intestinal juice which further assists the pancreatic\r\njuice. Absorption has been proceeding from the stomach onwards (_see_\r\nAssimilation). The mass of undigested food is pushed along the small\r\nintestine by means of muscles in its walls and passes into the large\r\nintestine where a similar process to that of the small intestine goes\r\non, the remains of the food ultimately reaching the vent in a semi\r\nsolid form, consisting of the undigested part and the débris of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nDuring this complex process much blood and energy is needed for the\r\nabdominal region, therefore hard work or exercise should not\r\nimmediately follow a meal. It will be noticed that each stage of\r\ndigestion prepares the food for the next stage _e.g._, the mouth\r\nprepares the food for the stomach. Now, as the food ceases to be under\r\nour control when it leaves the mouth, every effort should, as we have\r\nsaid, there be made to prepare the food for its reception by the\r\nstomach. Chew food dry as far as possible, for that excites saliva. It\r\nis best not to drink till after the meal. The digestive powers often\r\nbecome weakened in advancing years, but may be greatly preserved, and\r\neven restored to health after long debility, by careful attention to\r\nthe above hints.\r\n\r\nDrinks made of lemon juice or orange juice and water are often very\r\ngood to help an invalid digestion, but nothing is better than sips of\r\nhot water for some time before a meal. Distilled water is especially a\r\nmost valuable drink. Cooling applications to a fevered stomach and warm\r\nfomentations to a cold one will often promote digestion marvellously.\r\nThe feet and legs may be fomented if cold while the cold cloth is\r\npressed over the stomach, especially if the process be long continued.\r\nWhere heat is necessary it should be gradually and cautiously applied,\r\nso that sickening the patient may be avoided. (_See also_ Assimilation,\r\nFood in Health, Indigestion).\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet, Economy in.--Dr. Hutchison, one of our greatest authorities on\r\nthe subject of Dietetics, has well said--\r\n\r\n\"The dearest foods are by no means the best. 'Cheap and nasty' is not a\r\nphrase which can be applied to things which you eat. A pound of Stilton\r\ncheese at 1s. 2d. contains no more nutriment than a pound of American\r\ncheese at sixpence. A given weight of bloater will yield more building\r\nmaterial than the same quantity of salmon or sole.\r\n\r\n\"The upper classes in this country eat too much. The labouring classes\r\nare insufficiently fed--much worse fed than their brethren in America.\r\nOne of the chief consequences is an undue craving for alcoholic\r\nstimulants; another is that our poor are not properly armed against\r\ntuberculosis and epidemic disease.\r\n\r\n\"How can this be rectified? Anyone who knows anything about the poor\r\nman's budget knows that he already spends as much on food as he is\r\nable. As it is, 50 per cent. of a workman's wages are absorbed in its\r\npurchase, so that half the struggle for life is a struggle for food.\r\n\r\n\"The only remedy is to buy the things which are the most nourishing and\r\nwhich yield the most energy. Quite a good diet can be obtained for\r\nfourpence a day, yet the average working man spends sevenpence.\r\n\r\n\"I advise the buying of more vegetable foods, particularly peas, beans,\r\nand lentils, and the cheaper varieties of fish. The working classes\r\nshould also be taught how to cook cheese, and thus make it more\r\ndigestible, as the Italians do. Cheese contains much building material,\r\nand is therefore a valuable article of diet.\r\n\r\n\"I strongly recommend one good meal of oatmeal a day, instead of so\r\nmuch bread, butter, and tea, which is the staple diet of so many poor\r\nfamilies, because it is easily prepared, and because of human laziness.\r\n\r\n\"Skimmed milk is better than no milk at all, for it contains all the\r\noriginal proteids, and has only lost its fat. More dripping and\r\nmargarine should be eaten, instead of jam; margarine being quite as\r\ndigestible and nourishing as butter.\"\r\n\r\nVegetable oils are, however, more digestible than animal fats. Cocoanut\r\nbutter is a cheap and excellent substitute for margarine or butter. As\r\nit contains no water it will go much further.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of bad economy is the use of cod liver oil. Butter or\r\neven cream are quite as fattening and much more digestible.\r\n\r\nMalt extract is much dearer than honey, which is superior to it in\r\nvalue as a food.\r\n\r\nTo supply a healthy man with the amount of proteid required by him\r\ndaily in beef extracts would cost 7s., in milk (a comparatively\r\nexpensive food) would only cost about 1s.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiphtheria.--The most striking symptom of diphtheria is the growth of a\r\nsubstance in the upper part of the windpipe, which threatens to close\r\nit entirely. Good medical skill is of first importance here, yet much\r\nmay be done where that is not available. We have often seen the\r\nswallowing of a little hot water and treacle enable the children to\r\nthrow up the entire obstruction and make the breathing perfectly free.\r\nMark at once whether the feet are cold or warm. If cold, oil them well\r\nwith olive oil, and pack in a hot blanket fomentation to the knees.\r\nWhen the feet and knees are thoroughly warm in this, put a cold cloth\r\non the back of the neck down between the shoulders. Change this as\r\noften as felt comfortable. The throat may be brushed out with a weak\r\nsolution of Condy's Fluid, but a strong solution of common salt will do\r\nvery well. Good white vinegar and water (_see_ Acetic Acid) is perhaps\r\nbest of all. We have never seen this fail in changing the character of\r\nsuch growths, and if the windpipe can be washed out repeatedly with it,\r\nwe should feel sure of a desirable result. Now, we have seen a humble\r\nworking man's wife wash out the throat of her son as well as any\r\nmedical man could do it, using Condy's Fluid for the purpose with full\r\nsuccess. When you can, have the help of a medical man, but when you are\r\nso placed that such help is impossible, you need not fear to try\r\nyourself. If there is much fever, cold cloths may be applied to the\r\nhead to reduce the heat. As the disease is strongly infectious, care\r\nshould be taken to isolate the patient, and attendants should avoid his\r\nbreath. Abundance of fresh air and light should be allowed to enter the\r\nroom, and one window at least should be open as far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDouche, Cold.--In its most powerful form this is a _solid_ stream of\r\nwater directed down on the patient's shoulders and spine. It may be\r\napplied either by an apparatus fixed up for the purpose, or by merely\r\npouring from a watering-can _without_ a rose. Its power depends on the\r\ngreat heating in the skin which springs up when it is withdrawn. This\r\nheating power again depends on the strong shock given to the system\r\nwhen it is applied. Thus it will be seen that what is called a \"Spray\"\r\nor \"Spray Douche\" is of little use for the same purpose, as it gives\r\nlittle or no primary shock. It is with this application as with many.\r\nThe patient's feeling benefit is the great and true evidence of the\r\ntreatment being right. When the douche issues in bodily comfort and\r\ncheering to the mind, all is right. If it issues in discomfort, then\r\nsome other treatment must be tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Downbearing.\"--This expression will cover many troubles especially\r\ncommon among women, where the weight of the internal organs becomes\r\ndistressingly felt. These are usually supported without our being\r\nconscious of their weight at all. But in weakness, or after long\r\nfatigue and standing, it becomes felt as a severe downward pressure.\r\nThis is often caused by the pressure of corset and skirts upon the\r\nwaist. In cases where it is troublesome, much help will be derived by\r\nadopting some device for suspending the clothes from the shoulders.\r\nThis may quite cure the trouble (_see_ Tight Lacing). For more serious\r\ncases, take daily a short SITZ-BATH (_see_) in cold water, with the\r\nfeet in hot water. Internal syringing is often required, which is best\r\ndone with the \"Fountain Enema,\" and very weak acetic acid and water\r\n(_see_ Acetic Acid). A more powerful application is to have cold water\r\npoured over the front of the body while sitting in the sitz-bath, from\r\na watering-can with a garden rose on the spout. This must be done\r\ngently at first, and afterwards more strongly and with colder water.\r\nThis also prevents the troublesome \"flooding\" from the womb, which so\r\noften accompanies \"down-bearing.\" The water employed in the douche must\r\nbe _cold_, but it need not be icy cold. Ordinary cold tap water does\r\nvery well. In serious cases medical advice should be sought, as the\r\nwomb may be displaced. A golden rule for the prevention of this\r\ndistressing ailment is to pass water frequently. If women would always\r\ndo this before pushing heavy furniture, hanging up pictures, &c., many\r\ninternal ailments would be prevented, as when the bladder is empty\r\nthere is little danger of the womb being displaced.\r\n\r\nAfter the system has been weakened by a miscarriage, this flooding\r\noften occurs. Apply the above treatment: it checks the flooding, and\r\nbraces the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrinks, Refreshing.--This is a matter of great importance to the sick.\r\nNor is anything more important to be said on them than this, that the\r\nfoundation of all such drinks must be _water_. This water must be\r\n_pure_, and is best distilled, or boiled and filtered. Long boiling\r\nwill spoil water, and half-an-hour is long enough to boil. To add to\r\nthis pure water, we may take the juice of half a lemon, sweetened to\r\ntaste. Few patients will fail to relish this. A whole orange may be\r\nused instead of half a lemon. A substitute may be made by taking\r\nhalf-a-teaspoonful of good white vinegar instead of the orange or\r\nlemon. Also in many cases where the cold drink is not relished, it may\r\nbe taken warm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDropsy.--This trouble is rather a symptom than a disease. It rises from\r\naccumulation of watery waste in the body, owing to improper action of\r\nthe skin, lungs, or kidneys, and sometimes follows scarlet or other\r\nfevers and lung affections. By far the greatest danger in such cases\r\narises from fashionable medicines. It is of the last importance that\r\nnothing should be given to lessen life by injuring already weakened\r\nvital action. It is when this is done by metallic preparations that\r\nsuch cases become very grave and even hopeless. There is a prominent\r\nerror in connection with all dropsical tendencies, which should be\r\nremoved. That is the idea that the \"water\" which collects in such\r\nswellings is similar to good drinking water, and that giving the\r\nthirsty patient water to drink is increasing his illness. The so-called\r\n\"water\" which swells the face, or the feet, or any other part of the\r\nbody, in dropsy, is used-up matter such as is, in good health, removed\r\n(imperceptibly, in greatest measure) by the organs fitted for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWater, especially if given about blood heat, is at once used for most\r\nimportant vital purposes. This hot fresh water mingling with the\r\npoisonous \"water\" of dropsy dilutes it--renders it not only so much\r\nless injurious, but tends powerfully to its removal. The thirst of the\r\npatient is in perfect harmony with this truth, as all natural symptoms\r\nare ever in harmony with nature. If there are convulsive attacks, they\r\nare the result of used-up matter returning into the circulation, and\r\nreaching even the brain and central parts of the nervous system. The\r\ncure is gained when the defective organs are brought to act well. It is\r\nshortsighted action to deal with the kidneys alone in this trouble.\r\nThey often fail because they are overloaded through the failure of\r\nlungs and skin to do their part. First, it is well to act on the lungs\r\nby gentle rubbing with hot olive oil between the shoulders and over all\r\nthe back--done best in a warm room by the fire, or in bed. This may be\r\ncontinued for half-an-hour or more twice daily. The skin may be\r\nstimulated by a smart sponging with vinegar or weak acetic acid, and a\r\nrubbing all over with soap lather, and afterwards with hot olive oil.\r\nThis lathering and rubbing to be done at another time from the first\r\nrubbing for the lungs. Then apply a large warm bran poultice to the\r\nlower part of the back behind the kidneys.\r\n\r\nWe have often found the following simple treatment effectual, where the\r\npatient is not very weak. If there are any signs of heart failure, do\r\nnot use it. But if the patient is fairly strong, it is most beneficial.\r\nYou have a case, say, of dropsy in the abdomen: put on two folds of\r\nsoft flannel, wrung out of cold water; put two folds dry over the moist\r\nones. Keep away all oiled silk and everything of the kind. You will\r\nvery soon have an astonishing outflow of insensible perspiration, but\r\nit passes off through the soft porous flannel without any obstruction\r\nwhatever. You will find that under this the swelling soon comes down,\r\nand even disappears entirely. It is necessary, in such treatment, to\r\nrenew the bandage so as to keep all fresh and healthful, but your work\r\nis abundantly rewarded. In such a case as this the matter to be passed\r\noff is so great that a cotton or ordinary linen bandage may fail, as\r\nbeing too impervious, when a flannel bandage will succeed. A Kneipp\r\nlinen bandage is perfectly porous, and will not irritate the skin as\r\nflannel often does. Worn-out underwear can be kept for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIf stronger heat seems to be needed, a soft cloth four-ply thick, large\r\nenough to cover the whole lower back, should be dipped in CAYENNE\r\nLOTION (_see_), slightly squeezed, and placed on the back. Over this a\r\ndry cloth should be placed, and the patient should lie down on a bran\r\npoultice or hot-water bag for an hour or two. Afterwards the back\r\nshould be rubbed with olive oil, and a band of soft new flannel worn\r\nround the body.\r\n\r\nEven if the swelling is caused by rupture this treatment is the best.\r\nThe rupture must be reduced (_see_ Rupture) and sustained by a proper\r\ntruss, for which the patient should apply to a responsible surgical\r\ninstrument maker. This treatment alone has cured many dropsical\r\npatients. Where failure of the heart's action complicates the trouble,\r\nthis treatment will usually relieve the heart as well as kidneys. For\r\ndrink in such cases see article Drinks. For food give whatever is most\r\neasily digested and passed into good blood. Wheaten-meal food, oatmeal\r\njelly, etc., are good. _See also_ Biscuits and Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrowning.--Many valuable lives have been saved by an elementary\r\nknowledge of what to do in the case of one apparently suffocated or\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nCommence treatment immediately in the open air, with the face down,\r\nneck and chest exposed, and all tight clothing such as braces removed.\r\n\r\nThe points to be aimed at are--first and _immediately_, the Restoration\r\nof Breathing; and secondly, after breathing is restored, the promotion\r\nof Warmth and Circulation. The efforts to restore Breathing must be\r\ncommenced immediately and energetically, and persevered in for one or\r\ntwo hours, or until a medical man has pronounced that life is extinct.\r\nEfforts to promote Warmth and Circulation beyond removing the wet\r\nclothes and drying the skin must not be made until the first appearance\r\nof natural breathing, for if circulation of the blood be induced before\r\nbreathing has recommenced the restoration to life will be endangered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turning on the Chest.]\r\n\r\n_First_: Roll the patient over on his chest, with one of the arms under\r\nthe forehead, when the water will readily leave the mouth. _Second_: If\r\nbreathing does not recommence then, place him on his face, supporting\r\nthe chest on a roll of clothing. Turn the body gently on the side, then\r\nbriskly on the face repeating these movements, about 15 times in the\r\nminute. (By placing him on his chest the weight of the body forces the\r\nair out; when turned on the side air enters the chest). Five minutes is\r\nthe longest that can be afforded to this treatment. _Third_: Turn him\r\non his back, draw his tongue forward, keeping it forward by a band\r\npassing over it and under the chin, placing the roll of clothing under\r\nthe shoulder blades. Then, kneeling at his head, grasp the arms just\r\nbelow the elbows, draw them above the head, keeping them stretched for\r\nabout two seconds. Then turn down the arms and press them firmly for\r\ntwo seconds against the sides of the chest. (The outstretched position\r\nallows air to be drawn into the lungs, the other position allows it to\r\nbe pressed out.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arms extended.]\r\n\r\nWhen a spontaneous effort to respire is observed, proceed to induce\r\nCirculation and Warmth. This is accomplished by rubbing the limbs\r\nupwards with firm grasp and pressure underneath the warm blankets, or\r\nover the dry clothing which through bystanders or other means should\r\nhave been already procured, apply hot flannels, hot water bottles,\r\nheated bricks, etc., to the pit of the stomach, the armpits, between\r\nthe thighs and the soles of the feet.\r\n\r\nAllow abundance of fresh air to play about the patient. Administer a\r\nteaspoonful of warm water, and then if the power of swallowing have\r\nreturned, give hot milk, coffee, etc., in small quantities. The patient\r\nshould be kept in bed and a disposition to sleep encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe above treatment should be persevered in for some hours, as it is an\r\nerroneous opinion that persons are irrecoverable because life does not\r\nsoon make its appearance, persons having been restored after\r\npersevering for many hours. The appearances which generally accompany\r\nDeath, are: Cessation of the heart's action, eyes half-closed, pupils\r\ndilated, tongue approaching to the inner edges of the lips, lips and\r\nnostrils covered with a frothy mucus. Coldness and pallor of surface\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elbows on the Chest.]\r\n\r\n_Cautions_: Prevent crowding, avoid rough usage; if the body is on the\r\nback have the tongue secured. Never hold up the body by the feet. Never\r\nplace the body in a warm bath, unless under medical direction, and even\r\nthen only momentarily.\r\n\r\n\r\nDwining.--We give this name to a trouble from which we have been able\r\nto save some patients, as expressing best the general failure and\r\nweakness which sometimes constitute a serious danger, even where all\r\nspecific symptoms are wanting. Some cases of this kind we have cured,\r\nwhen they were supposed to be hopelessly dying, by the use of simple\r\nsoap lather. The skin of the patient is usually dry, and the pulse\r\nfeverish. In such a case take lather, made as directed in article Head,\r\nSoaping, and spread it gently all over the stomach and heart. Repeat\r\nthis six or seven times, keeping the patient warm in bed. Then, after\r\ndrying, do the same thing to the back. This does immense good. For the\r\ngeneral skin stimulation, rub over with the mixture for NIGHT SWEATS\r\n(_see_). The skin is rubbed over with this five or six times, once a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhere there is no feverishness, but rather cold feelings, then use the\r\n_warm_ lather as directed, and rub well all over afterwards with hot\r\nolive oil. This treatment alone we know to have cured many.\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery.--This is an affection of the bowels of the nature of\r\ndiarrhoea, but much worse, as in it _blood_ accompanies the bowel\r\ndischarge. It usually begins as diarrhoea, and at this stage may be\r\ncured by either warm vinegar and water or simple cold water injected\r\ninto the bowel (_see_ Diarrhoea). Where there is any reason to suspect\r\nthe water supply, that should be boiled for half-an-hour and cooled\r\nbefore use. Attention to the diet, taking for a time _milk_ diet alone,\r\nis also important. Nothing can be better than boiled bread and milk,\r\ngiving no more than the sufferer feels he needs. When the diarrhoea has\r\npassed into true dysentery, with blood discharge, or the trouble begins\r\nas such, then enemas of weak acetic acid, or vinegar and water, given\r\n_warm_ (_i.e._, a little over blood heat), must be used instead of cold\r\nwater. As much vinegar should be used as will make the mixture (_see_\r\nAcetic Acid) very slightly smarting when applied to a tender part of\r\nthe skin--say, to the corner of the eye. What is wanted is just as much\r\nacid as will act healingly on the injured vessels, and no more. An\r\nenema of this water mixed with acid may be repeated as long as required\r\nwith perfect safety and good effect every time. Even if the disease has\r\nmade very serious progress, this will tell upon it powerfully. These\r\nwarm enemas should be very resolutely followed up as long as they give\r\nthe least comfortable feeling. No one who has not felt their magical\r\neffect can conceive how powerful they are. We have seen a patient on\r\nthe point of giving in and lying down as a helpless invalid made\r\nperfectly fit for work in less than an hour by this mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nWhere the trouble has passed into that stage where the patient is much\r\nweakened, in addition to this the ARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_) should\r\nbe employed; or if the patient be too weak, the fomentation may be\r\nproperly wrapped round him in bed without rising. If the patient be too\r\nweak for wrapping round the body, he may be first wrapped round the\r\nlegs, and so strengthened as to stand the stronger remedy. Olive oil\r\nmust be rubbed on the skin before and after fomenting. The heat may be\r\nkept up for an hour. If too weak to stand even this, the feet and legs\r\nmay be first fomented, and afterwards the body. This treatment has\r\nsaved many cases from disaster. _See also_ British Cholera; Diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n\r\nDyspepsia.--_See_ Indigestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarache.--In the common form this is purely neuralgic. The nerves are\r\nin shape and distribution like some tender plant, the root in the brain\r\nor spinal cord, and the ends of the branches in the organs supplied by\r\nthem with nerve power. They are best affected, and most easily cured,\r\nby applications to the root rather than the branch ends. This is\r\ngreatly the case with earache, which is a trouble of the nerves of the\r\near--not those of hearing, but the ordinary nerves supplying the part.\r\nThe remedy is to press cold cloths on the _back of the head and neck_.\r\nThis will often give instant relief. It is best done when the patient\r\nis thoroughly warm. If he be cold and clammy in feeling, the feet and\r\nlegs must be well fomented before applying the cooling. Rub all parts\r\ntreated with warm olive oil when the treatment is finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nEars, Running.--In this trouble there is indicated a failure somewhere\r\nof the clearance of waste from the body. This matter gathers locally in\r\nthe ear, where suppuration and discharge take place. A cure must not be\r\ndirected to the ear alone, but first the general waste-removing system\r\nshould be stimulated with special reference to its service in the ear.\r\nRubbing the back with hot olive oil and gentle pressure for a long\r\ntime, say forty minutes daily, will go further to cure the ears than\r\nanything which can be done to themselves. Gatherings, by this\r\ntreatment, are often quickly dissolved and dispersed.\r\n\r\nWhere actual waste matter runs out of the ear, the treatment is to have\r\na round camel's-hair brush and soak the interior of the ear, using the\r\nbrush, with warm weak vinegar, or weak acetic acid, just sour to the\r\ntaste; then brush with a little fine almond oil, and wipe very gently\r\nas dry as possible.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to syringe the ears very gently with this dilute acetic\r\nacid; do not force the acid strongly against the internal parts of the\r\near, but rather let it soak in. It may be continued as long as is felt\r\nagreeable. Do this twice a day; have also a good warm bran poultice\r\nplaced at the back of the head and neck for an hour each day, oiling\r\nthe skin before and after. This is best done at bedtime. If this\r\ntreatment be pursued carefully, the ears should soon come right.\r\n\r\n\r\nEars, Singing in the.--Partial deafness is often accompanied by noises\r\nin the ear, which are very annoying. This is caused by the internal\r\nstate of the ear, and is often due especially to the state of the aural\r\nnerve. Similar noises are heard also when we place our fingers in our\r\nears, or when we hold a shell or hollow vessel against one of them. In\r\nthe latter case, what we hear is the rush of blood in the vessels of\r\nthe ear. In this way, singing in the ears often arises in the course of\r\nthe treatment recommended in the last article for running ears. If it\r\nbecome too loud, a cessation of the heating at the back of the head,\r\nand a brief cooling application, will relieve it. Therefore, in such\r\ncases, it is well to use COOLING IN HEATING (_see_).\r\n\r\n\r\nEczema.--Skin eruptions, known under this name, have very various\r\ncauses. Treatment must vary accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhere the cause is a failure of the skin to act properly, the _whole_\r\nskin of the body, especially the chest and back, will be dry and hard.\r\nIn this case apply SOAPY BLANKETS (_see_).\r\n\r\nIf the soapy blanket be too severe on the patient, then apply general\r\nlathering with M'Clinton's Soap. Use a badger's-hair shaving brush, and\r\nhave the lather like whipped cream with _no free water_ along with it.\r\nWe have known a few of these applications cure a case of long standing.\r\n\r\nWhere general debility is present, along with the disease, use all\r\nmeans to increase the patient's vitality. Simple diet is best (_see_\r\nDiet, Saltcoats' Biscuits, Barley, Assimilation, Digestion), and\r\nabundance of fresh air, within and without the house, by night and by\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhere the disease results from a parasite, some ointment should be\r\nused, and is best applied under the immediate direction of a specialist\r\nin Diseases of the Skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nElbow Joint.--See Armpit Swelling and Bone.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemas, Cold Water.--Prejudice often exists against _cold_ treatment of\r\nany kind, but it must be overcome, unless the sick would lose some of\r\nthe most precious means of relief which we possess. The Enema Syringe,\r\nor Fountain Enema, may be had from any druggist, and is used to inject\r\nliquid into the lower bowel. To inject _cold water_ by this means is a\r\nmost efficient method of relief for internal heat and irritation, as\r\nwell as for DIARRHOEA (_see_). Sick headaches are also often instantly\r\ncured by this means. What we are here concerned with, however, is to\r\nsay that this remedy is as _safe_ as it is simple, so long as\r\ndiscomfort is not felt by the patient. Cold enemas may be given\r\nrepeatedly, where they are felt to be comforting, without any danger\r\nwhatever. If the bowels move after the first application, there is no\r\nneed to be alarmed. Repeat the cold injection, and the diarrhoea will\r\ncease. The _cold_ enema does not produce or aggravate constipation; on\r\nthe contrary, it often relieves and cures the sluggish bowels. In cases\r\nwhere medicine has to be almost constantly taken, its use, and the\r\ndisuse of the drugs, will often effect a complete cure. In many\r\ninstances in which outward cooling cannot be borne, the thermometer\r\nwill indicate that there is excessive internal heat, and the pulse will\r\nbe quick also. In such cases it will be possible to give the most\r\ndelightful relief by cautiously applied internal cold.\r\n\r\nFever that might be relieved by cold packing and sponging with vinegar,\r\nor some such means, will be far more speedily reduced by these cold\r\ninjections, and fever which cannot be reduced by these means alone will\r\ngive way when this is added.\r\n\r\nThere are cases in which a sort of paralysis of the lower bowel renders\r\nwhat is called \"opening medicine\" constantly necessary. The consequence\r\nof these continued doses is to produce greater and greater paralysis,\r\nand ultimately death itself; in these cases the cold enema is of great\r\nvalue. If there is lack of power in the bowel, it is well to increase\r\nit by a warm bran poultice, or hot bag on the back, and to brace the\r\nvessels and muscles within with the cold enema. (_See_ Constipation.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEpidemics.--The key to action in case of epidemics prevailing in the\r\ndistrict is found, when we consider that always, many residing amid\r\ninfection escape it. They do so in virtue of better resisting power,\r\nrather than because no seeds of disease ever reach them. In case of\r\nepidemic, then, besides daily sponging with acetic acid or vinegar, and\r\n_scrupulous cleanliness_, everything should be done to increase health\r\nand vitality in the household. Plenty of fresh air and sunlight, open\r\nwindows day and night, and good plain food, are most powerful aids to\r\nresisting disease. The milk and water used in the household should all\r\nbe boiled and _allowed to cool_ before use, the boiling lasting\r\nhalf-an-hour. The family where all this is done may expect to escape\r\ninfection, and therefore may maintain that calmness and freedom from\r\nfear which is itself a very important help against it.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilepsy.--The first sign of such an illness is a brief and slight\r\nattack of \"absence.\" We notice once or twice that the person \"loses\r\nhimself\" for a few moments, but recovers so speedily that we scarcely\r\nare sure whether anything of importance has occurred. He is perfectly\r\nunaware that he has so \"lost himself\" or been \"absent\" at all. That\r\npart of the brain on the activity of which consciousness depends has\r\nbeen for the moment inactive.\r\n\r\nThere is another symptom--that is, the \"falling\" which gives one of its\r\ntitles to this malady. It is called \"the falling sickness.\" There is a\r\npeculiarity in the falling of one who is affected in this way. In some\r\ncases consciousness partially remains, but the balancing power of the\r\nbrain is lost. A patient in this case sees the ground rise till it\r\nstrikes him violently on the forehead. We remember a friend telling us\r\nthat he was walking along a railway, when all at once the rail seemed\r\nto rise and strike him in the face: he had fallen on the rail, and\r\nseriously wounded himself. The same thing occurs to the person who has\r\ntaken enough alcohol to deprive him for the time of brain action for\r\nthe usual balancing of his body. Just as there is a certain part of the\r\nbrain which gives men consciousness, so is there a part which gives\r\nmuscular control, such as we use in balancing the body, and there is a\r\nstream of vital action flowing from the nerve sources by which both are\r\nsupplied. If this stream is diverted from these organs, \"absence\" and\r\n\"falling\" are the natural and necessary result.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases in which there are only \"absence\" and \"falling,\"\r\nbut in others, symptoms much more alarming appear. The next of these\r\nwhich we notice introduces us to a totally distinct element in our\r\nexplanation. It is found in the \"screaming\" that follows instantly on\r\nunconsciousness, and precedes the \"falling\" generally. The sufferer is\r\nentirely unaware of all that occurs with him, and screams by no\r\nvoluntary act on his part. The symptom is purely bodily, and expresses\r\nno thought or feeling, good or bad, though it is similar to the scream\r\nof terror, and makes the same impression on the uninformed hearer. The\r\nmuscles are used in the scream of epilepsy, just as the muscles of\r\nordinary movement are used in St. Vitus' Dance, but there is nothing of\r\nthe mind whatever in the movement. The organ of the mind is unsupplied\r\nwith vital action, but the organs of voice are over-supplied. It is\r\nbeyond doubt this over-supply which shows itself in the scream, for\r\nthere is nothing else to account for it.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of the movements of the jaw that are so terribly\r\nstrong, and so sorely wound the tongue, in the case of those suffering\r\nin this way. The jaws open and shut with great force, and without the\r\nmind regulating their movement. All the motor nerves are convulsed with\r\nstrong action, and the muscles they supply are wrought to the utmost,\r\nwhile all consciousness and control are entirely suspended. There is\r\nsuch an overwhelming supply of activity to the mere muscular system\r\nthat the sources of that supply are soon exhausted, and the motion\r\nceases for a time. Consciousness does not at once return fully, but the\r\nconvulsions cease, and something like a sleep follows before the brain\r\nhas its needed supply.\r\n\r\nHow is it that vital action seizes these mere motor nerves and leaves\r\nthe brain? There is a symptom in cases of epilepsy which tends to throw\r\nsome light on this question. It is seen in the extreme activity of the\r\nbrain, indicated by the incessant talking of the patient before a\r\nseries of convulsions come on, when taken along with the extreme\r\ndepression and silence that follow such a series. During whole nights,\r\neven, the sufferer will talk, till every organ is exhausted; then comes\r\na series of violent convulsions, then a season of perfect silence and\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the disease points to the remedy. That which will\r\nnurse the brain, and at the same time lessen nervous force in the\r\nsystem, will tend to cure the evil. Strong fomentations round the lower\r\npart of the body may be used. Soap in fine LATHER (_see_) should be\r\nmade to cover the skin at bedtime, and washed off with weak ACETIC ACID\r\n(_see_) in the morning. Easily digested food should be taken, and all\r\nso-called stimulants strictly avoided. We should endeavour to secure\r\nthe soothing of the spinal system of nerves. This is done in a degree\r\nthat is incredible to those who have not actually witnessed it by a\r\npersevering use of the cold treatment of the back. The best time is\r\nearly in the morning, after the patient has had a good night's sleep.\r\nFor a whole hour spinal treatment should then be used. We have no faith\r\nin any royal road to success in such a cure, but we have faith in\r\ncommon sense and right good work. Taking three towels, and putting two\r\nof them in cold water, the \"operator\" is ready to begin. It will be\r\nwell first to rub the patient's back gently with a little warm olive\r\noil. This will obviate all danger of shock or shiver when the cold\r\ncloth is placed on the skin. Then wring out one of the cold towels\r\nthoroughly, so as to have it damp and not dripping; fold it lengthways\r\neight ply. Put the one over the other, place both on the centre of the\r\npatient's back as he is sitting up in bed to receive them, keeping the\r\ndamp towel next the skin. Adjust these cloths nicely, make the patient\r\nlie down upon them, and cover him snugly up with the bedclothes. So\r\nlong as the feeling is nice, let well alone. When the towel becomes\r\nhot, wring out the second, and change it on the back. Carry this out\r\nfor a full hour, and if the patient is disposed to go to sleep again,\r\nencourage him to do so.\r\n\r\nContinued for weeks every morning this humble treatment, without any\r\naddition, has an incredibly soothing effect on an excitable system. But\r\nit will be well to add to it some nursing of the head and feet, so that\r\nevery encouragement may be given to a diffusion of nerve action over\r\nthe body. At night, before going to bed, the feet and legs should be\r\nbathed in hot water for a quarter of an hour, dried, rubbed gently with\r\nwarm olive oil, and a pair of soft cotton stockings drawn on. While the\r\npatient is being treated, every possible wearing and irritation of the\r\nbrain must be avoided, and when lying on the cold towel, the head\r\nshould be soothingly rubbed by a gentle hand. If an actual violent\r\nattack comes on, loose all tight clothes, place a piece of cork between\r\nthe patient's teeth to prevent biting the tongue, give plenty of fresh\r\nair, and keep the patient in a recumbent position.\r\n\r\nEverything should be done, by training, to increase the patient's\r\nself-control, and all stimulants should be avoided as most injurious.\r\n_See_ Head, Rubbing the.\r\n\r\nIt is important that those liable to these attacks should be kept\r\nemployed. Nothing is so harmful as idleness. Everything tending to good\r\nhealth is of value, but the essentials of the treatment are found in\r\nsoothing the spine as above, and stimulating the brain by the head\r\nrubbing. Unless in cases in which the very structure of the system has\r\nbeen, so to speak, altered by long-continued disease of this sort, we\r\nshould look for good results from such treatment as this. Even in the\r\nworst cases it would be possible to mitigate the severity of the\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nA difference in the focus of the eyes often causes a strain on the\r\nbrain in the effort to adjust them. This sometimes causes epilepsy, and\r\nwe have known many cases cured by the use of spectacles made to correct\r\nthis inequality. In all cases of this disease, therefore, an optician\r\nshould be consulted, to see if there is any defect in the eyes.\r\n\r\nOther illnesses are sometimes mistaken for epilepsy: for example, the\r\nliver and kidneys in a defective state and impurities passing in the\r\nblood to the brain, will explain certain forms of that which passes as\r\nepilepsy. It is often easy to cure attacks of this nature by merely\r\nbringing the liver and kidneys into working order. If there is a\r\nyellowness of the skin, or other signs of the blood failing to be\r\npurified in a natural way, then that should first be dealt with, and\r\nthe fits will often be removed as soon as good action is established in\r\nthe purifying organs. But in all cases in which there is anything like\r\nreal \"fits,\" it will be found of great importance to study the\r\nover-and-under-actions of the nerve system as by far the most essential\r\nelements in the disease. _See_ Jaundice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEruptions.--_See_ Hives; \"Outstrikes;\" Saltrome, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nErysipelas.--This troublesome disease is also known as St. Anthony's\r\nFire, or the Rose. The skin becomes fiery red or even purplish in hue.\r\nA violent heat and pain in the part accompany this, and fever and\r\ngeneral disturbance of the system follow in a severe case. Swelling of\r\nthe parts follows, with much distress and danger. _Air_ irritates\r\nviolently the sore parts, and is usually excluded.\r\n\r\nIn curing the trouble, regard must be had to the cause, which is\r\nusually a general failure of strength from overwork, worry, or some\r\nother disease. If a cure is to be effected, _rest_ of mind and body is\r\nnecessary, and must be secured at any possible cost. For local\r\napplication, the sore parts are thickly dusted with fine fresh flour,\r\nand covered with soft wadding or surgeon's lint. The air is excluded,\r\nand all is kept _strictly dry_. A waterproof covering over the lint\r\nwill help this, but is not absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nBut, now, is there nothing that can be done to quicken that inner\r\naction, the slowness of which has paved the way for all this mischief?\r\nThis might be done in two ways. After the affected parts, say the face,\r\nhave been secured in this pack of flour, it will be easy to place a hot\r\nblanket, soaked partly, but not at all _wet_, with boiling water, all\r\nround the head of the patient. As soon as the heat begins to enter the\r\nhead, a sense of comfort will be experienced. Care must be taken to\r\nkeep the _inner cloths dry_, and heat is best given by an india-rubber\r\nbag. When this cannot be had, however, the blanket may be used. At\r\nintervals, as the patient feels it desirable, this fomentation may be\r\nrenewed. It will hasten recovery as well as arrest the spreading of the\r\nmalady, while it will secure such recovery as will not readily dispose\r\nto a return of the evil. The feet and legs are likely to be cold. As\r\nthe sufferer lies still in bed, but not when the other fomentation is\r\non, these should be wrapped in a hot fomentation, allowed to lie in it\r\nfor a good half-hour, taken out of it and dried, rubbed with warm olive\r\noil, and covered with a pair of soft cotton stockings. If this\r\ntreatment is at all well carried out, the feeling of comfort given will\r\nsoon tell how it is working. Of course, if the feet and legs are the\r\nparts affected, the fomentation must be applied elsewhere, say on the\r\nback, or on the haunches.\r\n\r\nWhere erysipelas appears in connection with wounds or sores, the same\r\ntreatment is to be pursued, as far as possible consistent with dressing\r\nthe sores. These should be carefully cleansed, dusted with boric acid,\r\nand covered with a layer of wadding bandage. The limb should be raised\r\nto a horizontal position. Simple food should be given, and the sufferer\r\nkept quiet. In all cases of skin trouble, linen should be worn next the\r\nskin. _See_ Underwear.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise.--Where this is advised medically, it is often taken in a\r\nmanner far from wise. For weakly people seeking strength, exercise\r\nshould never be pursued to the extent of fatigue. Up to a certain point\r\nit does good; beyond that, harm. The beginning of harm is indicated by\r\nthe feeling of weariness. At the same time it must be remembered that\r\nwhat is felt as weariness may be merely laziness. This must be\r\nenergetically combated. There is no royal road to health any more than\r\nto learning.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this disinclination for exercise may arise from too much\r\nor too rich food, and a more sparing diet may remove it. _See_\r\nAppendix; Physical Culture.\r\n\r\nWhen even walking is out of the question, a kind of exercise may be\r\ngiven by gently massaging the limbs while the patient is in bed. The\r\nback muscles should also be gently rubbed and kneaded, so as to cause\r\nthem to move under the skin, without effort on the patient's part. But\r\nno fatigue must be caused. The amount may be gradually increased as the\r\npatient can stand it. _See_ Brain Exercise; Massage.\r\n\r\n\r\nExhaustion.--Often very serious trouble takes the form of simple\r\noverwhelming weariness. The patient's system has been wrought down till\r\nit can no longer respond even to stimulus, and life itself seems ebbing\r\naway. In such cases treat as for DEPRESSION (_see_) avoiding too\r\nenergetic treatment, and gradually infusing new life by massage and\r\nfomenting.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpectoration.--What is commonly called a \"cough and spit\" is sometimes\r\ndue to some serious trouble of the lungs, and in all cases a doctor\r\nshould be consulted at once. Often, however, it is due to the failure\r\nof the skin or other organs duly to carry off the waste of the body,\r\nwhich then accumulates in the air tubes. If we get a good revivifying\r\ntreatment of the skin, such cough and spit will speedily be cured. A\r\nmild vapour bath, with thorough SOAPING (_see_ Soap) will usually be\r\nsufficient in a slight case.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is a sweating of the skin itself which does not cure\r\nexpectoration, but which must itself be cured. That is the night or\r\nearly morning sweating, which is very reducing. It is the insensible\r\nperspiration which is needed to remove the spit. Give one good sponging\r\nover the body with acetic acid; follow this the evening after with\r\ncayenne \"tea,\" afterwards rubbing with warm olive oil. For two or three\r\nevenings repeat this treatment. There should then be a loosening of the\r\nphlegm, and a lessening of the flow through the lungs. The sufferer may\r\nbe very weak, and yet these things may be so gently and kindly done,\r\nthat no fatigue is experienced.\r\n\r\nIf above treatment does not cure, the SOAPY BLANKET (_see_) may be used\r\nonce a week, with daily sponging with vinegar or weak acetic acid, and\r\nrubbing with warm olive oil. This should cure in a few weeks, where\r\nthere is no real disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Accidents to.--Three distinct classes of these are to be\r\nconsidered. They require very different treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen the eyeball is cut or pierced, if the cut be deep or large, a\r\nsurgeon must deal with it. But if small, a drop or two of castor oil\r\nlet fall into the eye will often be all that is required. Where\r\ninflammation comes on, the tepid pouring recommended below for bad eyes\r\nwill greatly help. If more severe, the treatment for inflamed eyes may\r\nbe given. _Perfect rest_ and _thorough exclusion of light_ are very\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nIf the eye is bruised, bathe with warm water, to which a little vinegar\r\nor boracic acid has been added. If after bathing, pain continues, drop\r\nin castor oil, and on the outside of the eyelid lay a pad dipped in a\r\nmixture of equal parts of laudanum and water. Change this cloth\r\nfrequently until the pain is relieved.\r\n\r\nTreat in this way also for insects stinging the eye.\r\n\r\nWhen the eye is burned, either by sparks or by some burning chemical\r\nsubstance, cold cloths should be persistently applied to the eye. The\r\nsoftest rags or surgeon's lint should be cut up into small pieces that\r\nwill just cover the eye. Dip these in the coldest water, and press it\r\nout a little, so that it will not run off. Place these little bits of\r\nwet cloth one after another on the eye or eyes affected. The patient\r\nwill not be able to endure pressure further than the weight of the\r\ncloths themselves. These can be taken off and changed for cold ones as\r\nthe feeling of the sufferer directs. After a time the cooling will be\r\nfelt to have gone far enough, and the cloths may be allowed to lie;\r\nwhen they get too warm they can be taken off, or if the heat and pain\r\nreturn they can be renewed.\r\n\r\nWhile this treatment is going on it will be necessary to open the\r\neyelids at intervals, so as to let off the tears that collect in such\r\ncases and cause great distress. These will flow out when in the most\r\ngentle way you have laid one thumb on the upper eyebrow, and the other\r\njust below the lower eyelid, so that you can draw the lids just\r\nslightly open.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Cataract on.--This disease has been arrested, and in earlier\r\nstages even cured, by the treatment described in, Eyes, failing sight.\r\nBy means of this treatment we have seen a totally blind eye restored in\r\na few weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Danger to Sight of.--Where inflammation has gone so far as to\r\nlead to suppuration, or even to ulceration of the eyes, there is grave\r\ndanger of blindness, and this is often the case with infants and\r\nchildren who have been wrongly treated or neglected. In such a case,\r\ncease at once all irritating and painful treatment and drugs. First,\r\nwash the eyes by gently dropping over them distilled water, or boiled\r\nrain water which has been cooled. The water should be used about blood\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so, have another warm bathing by means of gentle\r\npouring over the eyes, but do not rub the eyelids. Let there be no\r\nfriction beyond that of the soft and warm water running over the face\r\nin the bathing. Rather have patience till that washes all waste matter\r\naway than run any risk of irritating the eyeball. All this time watch\r\nwhat the sufferer evidently likes, and follow his likings--that is, as\r\nto warmer or colder water, and so on. It will not be very long before\r\nyou have thoroughly cleaned the eyes, while at the same time you have\r\ninfused fresh life into them. To the water used a little vinegar or\r\nacetic acid should next be added, or Condy's fluid may be used when it\r\nis convenient. But care must be taken that no great smarting is caused.\r\n_See_ Acetic Acid.\r\n\r\nAs the discharge from ulcerated eyes is very infectious, care should be\r\ntaken not to communicate it to other persons' eyes. Strict cleanliness\r\nshould be observed, and all rags employed should be burnt, and\r\ndisinfectants used to cleanse the patient's and nurse's hands, etc.\r\nTowels should be boiled for half-an-hour before being washed, after\r\nthey have been used in such a case.\r\n\r\nNow a most important matter must be attended to. Castor oil is the most\r\nsoothing that can be used with the eyes. Fresh olive oil comes next,\r\nbut it is usually just as easy to get the one as the other. With a\r\nfeather, or fine camel's-hair brush, and as gently as possible, cover\r\nthe eyelids with this oil heated to about blood heat. Do not try to\r\nforce it on the eyeballs, but if the lids open so much as to let it in,\r\nallow it to lubricate the eyeball also. Rub it gently over the eyebrows\r\nand all round the eyes, and dry it gently off. Cover the eyes then with\r\na soft covering, and let them have perfect rest.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a tiny piece of dust or iron may stick in the\r\nsurface of the eye, and refuse to be washed away by the tears. Take a\r\nsquare inch of writing paper, curve one of the sides of it, and draw it\r\nlightly and quickly over the spot. Never use any sharp instrument or\r\npin. Repeat the operation a few times if unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nDiet as recommended in article Eyes, Hazy Sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Failing Sight.--This often comes as the result simply of an\r\nover-wearied body and mind, without any pain or accident whatever. It\r\nappears as an inability to see small distant objects, or to see at all\r\nin dusky twilight. The sight is also variable--good when the patient is\r\nnot wearied, and bad when he is tired. When this comes on under thirty\r\nyears of age, the eyes have almost certainly been overworked, and need\r\nrest. Rest from all reading and other work trying for the eyes is the\r\nbest cure. If this can be had, it should be taken, with much outdoor\r\nexercise. Fresh air is a fine tonic for the eyes. Where total rest\r\ncannot be had, take as much as possible, and nurse the failing nerves\r\nas follows. Apply the bran poultice, as directed for inflamed eyes,\r\njust as long as it is felt to be comforting--with one patient it will\r\nbe longer, with another shorter. Now there is a cooling of the brow and\r\nof the eyes themselves, which is as important almost as the heating of\r\nthe back of the head. We always find, as a matter of fact, that a cold\r\napplication opposed to a hot one produces a vastly better result that\r\ntwo hot ones opposed, or one hot one by itself alone. So we find in the\r\ncase of the eyes. We have now, as we write these lines, eyes under our\r\ncare that are mending every day by means of a bran poultice at the back\r\nof the head and neck, and a cold cloth changed on the brow and eyes.\r\nThey do not mend anything like so well if heat alone is used. Rub the\r\nback of the head and neck with hot olive oil before and after\r\npoulticing, and dry well. Do this for an hour at a time, _twice_, or if\r\npossible _three times_, a day. Continue for a fortnight, cease\r\ntreatment for a week, and again treat for another fortnight. This\r\nshould make such improvement as to encourage to further perseverance\r\nwith the cure. Sometimes failing sight follows neuralgia. In this case\r\nthe rubbing described in Eyes, Squinting, given twice a day for fifteen\r\nor twenty minutes each day, will be useful in addition to above\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nEven in cases in which \"cataract\" is fully formed, we find that the\r\ndisease is arrested, and the patient at least gets no worse. But where\r\nthis malady is only threatened the haze soon passes away. We most\r\nearnestly wish and pray that this simple treatment should be as widely\r\nknown as there are failing eyes in this world of trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Hazy Sight.--Frequently, after inflammation, and even when that\r\nhas ceased, the sight is left in a hazy condition. The eyes may be in\r\nsuch cases rather cold than hot, and not amenable to the cooling\r\napplications. The whole system also lacks vital action. First, in such\r\na case, wash the back thoroughly all over at night with hot water and\r\nSOAP (_see_). Dry well and rub hot olive oil into the skin until dry.\r\nIn the morning rub the back for a few minutes with vinegar or weak\r\nACETIC ACID (_see_) before getting out of bed, dry, and rub with warm\r\nolive oil. A strip of new flannel should be sewn on the underclothing,\r\nso as to cover the whole back. The feet and legs should be bathed\r\n(_see_ Bathing Feet) twice a week. All alcoholic drinks, and most\r\ndrugs, should be avoided, while only such food should be taken as can\r\nbe converted into good blood. Half a teacupful of _distilled_ water\r\nshould be taken before each meal. The whole of this diet tends to\r\nproduce healthy blood, which is the great means of dissolving all\r\nhaziness in the lenses and humours of the eyes.\r\n\r\nEvery drop of alcohol does so much to reduce that action. We have heard\r\nthis beautifully described by one of the foremost of living medical\r\nmen. He began by stating, what no one can doubt, that a certain\r\nquantity of alcohol taken by the strongest man will kill that man as\r\neffectually as if he were shot through the head with a rifle bullet.\r\nNow a certain portion of alcohol takes a man's sight entirely away.\r\nHalf that quantity will only render his vision \"double\"--that is, unfit\r\nhim to see objects as they really are. Half that again will only\r\nperceptibly impair the power of the eyes; but the action of the\r\nsmallest particle of the substance is the same in nature as that of the\r\nlargest quantity. Hence that action is to reduce the very efficiency of\r\nthe nerves of the eye, which it is of such immense importance to nurse\r\nto the uttermost. No mere dictum, however strongly expressed, can hold\r\nfor a moment against this transparent reason. Hence, if a person must\r\ntake alcoholic liquor, the cure of inflammation in his eyes, and of the\r\nthickening of the transparent portions of these organs, is simply out\r\nof the question unless the disease is comparatively slight, and his\r\nnervous constitution strong.\r\n\r\nThe very same reason holds good of tobacco. So of opium. So of every\r\nother narcotic, whatever it may be called. Hundreds of men lose their\r\neyesight by the use of tobacco alone. We have seen their eyeballs\r\ngradually becoming sightless when no change could be detected in their\r\neyes--only the optic nerve gradually lost its sensibility till they\r\nwere entirely blind. We are perfectly aware that there are those who\r\nwill scout the idea of such an effect, and prescribe these very\r\nnarcotics largely in such cases; it is because such drugs are used and\r\nordered that we are compelled thus to reason about them. In all cases\r\nof failing eyesight they should be carefully avoided. So should all\r\nfoods which are not easily converted into healthful blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Healthy.--Cheap, ill-printed literature is responsible for much\r\neye trouble, and it is well worth while to pay, if possible, a little\r\nextra for books well printed, especially in the case of those who read\r\nmuch. When reading sit erect, with the back to the light, so that it\r\nfalls over the shoulder. Too fine work, dim light, wrong diet, and want\r\nof exercise produce the dull and strained eye, which eventually becomes\r\nseriously diseased. Opening the eyes under cold water will help to\r\nstrengthen them, and massaging the muscles of the eye by passing the\r\nfinger and thumb round the socket (with scarcely any pressure on the\r\nball itself) will be found of advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Inflamed.--For all kinds of burning inflammatory pain in the\r\neyes, the following treatment is most effective. Place a hot BRAN\r\nPOULTICE (_see_) beneath the back of the head and neck while the\r\npatient lies on the back. Press gently fresh cool damp cloths,\r\nfrequently changed, all over the eyeballs and sockets, so as to draw\r\nout the heat. No one who has not seen this done can imagine how\r\npowerful a remedy it is. It may also be necessary, if the feet be cold,\r\nto foment up to the knees. This last fomentation is best done at\r\nbedtime, and the feet and legs should be rubbed with olive oil, and a\r\npair of cotton stockings put on to sleep in, to keep the feet\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nIf the eyes are very sensitive the treatment should go on in dim light,\r\nas may be felt necessary. The poultice and cold cloths may be used for\r\nan hour twice a day. In bad cases, where sight has been seriously\r\naffected, a good rubbing of all the skin of the head with the finger\r\ntips may be given before the poultice is applied. This rubbing must not\r\nbe a trial to the patient, but gently done, with kindly good will, and\r\nit must be pursued for fifteen or twenty minutes, until the whole head\r\nis in a warm glow.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Inflamed, with General Eruptions over the Body.--In some cases\r\nthe eye trouble is only a part of a general skin inflammation,\r\naccompanied with heat all over the body, and an acrid, irritating\r\ndischarge from eruptions on the face and elsewhere, especially on the\r\nhead. The cold cloths and poultice will not work in such a case. The\r\nchief agent in the cure is fine soap lather (_see_ Head, Soaping). Let\r\nthe head be shampooed with it for half-an-hour. The whole body should\r\nthen be lathered and shampooed for a short time in a warm bath; this is\r\nbest done at bedtime. Much water is not needed; warm soapy lather, well\r\nrubbed all over, is what is required. Ordinary soap will make the skin\r\nworse; only M'Clinton's will do to soothe and heal it (_see_ Soap). If\r\nwhite specks show on the eyes, the treatment in article on Eyes, Danger\r\nto Sight of, will cure these. When this complaint is obstinate and\r\nrefuses to heal, medical advice should be sought, as blood poisoning is\r\nprobably present.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Paralysis of.--The partial paralysis of the muscles of one eye\r\nproduces double vision, so that the patient sees two similar objects\r\nwhere there is only one. This double vision is often, however, the\r\nresult of stomach derangement. If so, it may soon pass away. The true\r\nparalysis is more persistent. To cure this, rub the entire skin of the\r\nhead gently and steadily with the hands and finger-tips (stroking\r\nalways _upwards_) for some fifteen minutes. Then apply cold cloths to\r\nthe eyes as already directed. If the cold cloths are uncomfortable, hot\r\nones should be tried. Do this for fifteen minutes also. Continue\r\nalternately for an hour twice or three times a day. We have known one\r\nsuch day's treatment remove the double vision _entirely_, and no\r\nrelapse occur, but in most cases the treatment must be persevered in\r\nand returned to until the paralysis is overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Spots on.--These spots are of two different kinds, and yet they\r\nare very much the same in nature and substance. What is called \"a\r\ncataract\" is of a different character. We refer not to this, but to the\r\nspots that form on the surface of the eyeball, and those that form in\r\nthe membrane of the eyelid. When inflammation has gone on for some time\r\non the eyeball itself, portions of whitish matter form on the glassy\r\nsurface and soon interfere with the sight. When inflammation has gone\r\non in the eyelid, little knots like pin-heads form, producing a feeling\r\nas if sand were in the eye. Afterwards these knots grow large and swell\r\nthe eyelid, and at times the matter in them grows hard, and seems to\r\ntake up a lasting abode in that tissue. Strong and destructive liquids\r\nor powders are sometimes applied, that so affect the whole substance of\r\nthe eye as to cause blindness. Nothing of this nature is required at\r\nall. First, the skin of the head must be dealt with. You will find that\r\nthis is hot and dry, and somewhat hard on the skull. Rub this gently\r\nwith the dry hands for a few minutes, then press a cloth tightly wrung\r\nout of cold water all round the head. Rub and cool alternately for\r\nhalf-an-hour or more if it continues to produce an agreeable feeling.\r\nWhen the head is all soothed, and good action has been secured, at\r\nleast on its surface, begin with the eye itself. The same treatment is\r\nrequired for both classes of cases. The eye will be shut at first. You\r\ntake a fine camel's-hair brush, such as is used by artists, and some\r\nvinegar or acetic acid, so weak that you can swallow a portion of it\r\nwithout hurting your throat. This is a very good test of strength for\r\nthe acid. You carefully brush over the outside of the eyelids and all\r\nround the eye with this weak acid. This must be done most carefully and\r\npatiently for a length of time, till all sweatiness is washed off, and\r\na fine warm feeling is produced by the acid. The matter softens and\r\nbreaks up, so that it begins to pass away. We have seen a little ball\r\nof hard white matter break up and come away after a single brushing\r\ncarefully done. When the matter is in the eyelid, and is so situated\r\nthat you can brush over it in the inside of the lid, it is well to do\r\nso; but this operation must be gently and carefully done. When you have\r\nbrushed with the acid long enough, dry the eyelids and cheek carefully,\r\nand rub with a little fresh olive or almond oil. It will be well to\r\ncover the eye from the cold, and from any dust that might irritate. You\r\nwill soon find that it is as clear and sound as could be wished.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyes, Squinting.--Various affections of the eyeball muscles cause this.\r\nTo cure it is often easy, sometimes very difficult. The method of\r\ntreatment is to stimulate all the nerves of the head and face, and at\r\nthe same time to soothe their irritation. This is accomplished by\r\nmassaging the brow and entire head. It must be gently and soothingly\r\ndone. The open hands are drawn upwards over the brow from the eyebrows,\r\nthe rubber standing behind the patient. Then both sides of the head and\r\nthe back of the head are stroked similarly. After this the whole head\r\nis rubbed briskly with the finger-points. This should be done often,\r\neven four or five times in the day. If the patient objects, it is being\r\nunskilfully done; the right sort of rubbing is always pleasant. A\r\nsquinting eye has been cured in a few rubbings, where the case was a\r\nsimple one. If the head becomes very hot, it may be cooled as directed\r\nabove for Children's Sleep. Squinting may be produced or increased by\r\nthat state of the stomach and bowels in which worms are bred.\r\n\r\n\r\nFace, Skin of.--To secure a healthy appearance of this is worth much\r\ntrouble, and any eruption or unhealthy redness is a great trial,\r\nespecially to ladies. To cure and prevent these, it is usually\r\nnecessary to look first to the _diet_. A disagreeable redness of the\r\nnose, and pimples in various places, is the common result of too much\r\nrich food, not to speak of alcoholic drink, which is always most\r\ninjurious to the face skin. The use of corsets is another fertile\r\nsource of this trouble, and many in their desire to improve their\r\nfigure ruin their faces. Plain, easily digested food is to be taken.\r\nTea must only be used _at most_ twice in the day, and should be\r\nexceedingly weak. Half-a-teacupful of hot water should be taken before\r\nevery meal, and everything possible done to promote digestion. The\r\nwhole skin must be brought into a healthy state by daily washing with\r\nM'Clinton's soap (_see_ Soap); no other should be used for toilet\r\npurposes. It is far better than the boasted and expensive \"complexion\r\nsoaps,\" and can now be had in various forms. Many faces are injured by\r\nthe kind of soap used in washing. The use of the kind we recommend is\r\nremarkably pleasant and beneficial, and a full account of it, and of\r\nour motives in recommending it, will be found under article Soap. If,\r\nhowever, the face will not stand the touch of water at all, good\r\nBUTTERMILK (_see_) forms the best wash and cooling application. Also a\r\n_cloth mask_ may be worn all night, lined inside with soft creamy soap\r\nlather. In violent face irritation this last treatment is especially\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nFor pimples on the face, the general treatment for the skin mentioned\r\nabove (_see_ Eyes, Inflamed) is to be used, especially applied to the\r\nskin of the back. The buttermilk wash may also be used, but the best\r\neffect comes from the general treatment of the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFainting.--Fatigue, excessive heat, fright, loss of blood, hunger,\r\netc., are common causes.\r\n\r\nThe action of the heart is temporarily interfered with, and pallor, a\r\nsweat on the forehead, with an indescribable feeling of sinking away,\r\nprecede unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to bend down the patient's head till it\r\ntouches the knees, and keep it there for a few minutes. After he has\r\npartially recovered consciousness, the clothing should be loosened, and\r\nall tight bands or braces removed. The face and hands should be bathed\r\nin cold water, slapping the face with a wet towel. Some stimulant, such\r\nas hot tea, coffee, or sal volatile, may then be given.\r\n\r\nIf there is a wound causing loss of blood, it should be attended to at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIn case fainting is due to hunger, the greatest care should be taken to\r\ngive only small quantities of food after recovery, as a large amount\r\nmay prove fatal.\r\n\r\nA sip of cold water, or bathing the face with cold water, will\r\ngenerally prevent a threatened fainting. If there appears any immediate\r\ndanger of a relapse, keep the patient in a horizontal position for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPersons liable to fainting fits should be careful to avoid extremes of\r\ntemperature, such as very hot or very cold baths.\r\n\r\n\r\nFall, A.--After a fall from a height, where there is no apparent\r\noutward injury, there is often such a severe shock to the spinal cord\r\nand brain that continued unconsciousness occurs. In such a case, foment\r\nthe spine at first, to remove the effects of the concussion. This may\r\nbring on serious difficulty of breathing, owing to congestion of the\r\nspinal cord. This can be removed by applying cold cloths along the\r\nspine. If the difficulty of breathing be present from the first, then\r\napply the cold at once. The first effect of such a fall is to deprive\r\nthe brain and spinal cord of vital force. This must be restored by\r\n_heat_. Subsequent effects due to congestion can be removed by cold.\r\nThe effects of a shock in a railway accident may be similarly treated.\r\nCommon sense will guide in using heat or cold by watching the effect.\r\nWhere heat fails try cold. This is the simple rule. It is good also to\r\ngive the patient some simple purgative medicine, and some warm drink.\r\n_Avoid all doses of alcoholic drinks._ We have known the flickering\r\nflame of life almost extinguished by a teaspoonful of brandy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding, Over.--It is well to remember that over-feeding is a relative\r\nterm. To take more than a weak stomach can digest, is to over-feed,\r\nalthough very little be taken. We give some invalids food every two\r\nhours but that food is only two-thirds of a teacupful of milk, mixed\r\nwith a third of boiling water. In every case we must watch to give the\r\nright amount, no less and no more. Every case will require to be\r\nconsidered by itself in the light of common sense. The amount of food\r\neaten should be just sufficient to supply the body with material to\r\nreplace that consumed in work, build up its wasted tissues and leave a\r\nslight surplus over for reserve store. Anything more is harmful. In\r\nyouth, if too much be eaten, nature relieves herself by giving the\r\ntransgressor of her laws a bilious attack, during which there is no\r\nappetite, and so the excess is worked off. In later years this safety\r\nvalve does not work, and the surplus is generally stored as useless\r\nfat, impeding the action of the heart or other internal organs, or as\r\ngouty deposits in various parts. The Anglo-Saxon race at all events\r\ndoes not limit its diet as we think it should, and Sir Henry Thompson,\r\nM.D., has stated that in his opinion more ill-health arises from\r\nover-eating than from the use of intoxicating liquor, great a source of\r\nillness as this last undoubtedly is.\r\n\r\nTemperance in diet is absolutely necessary therefore, if one would be\r\nhealthy, and the avoidance of stimulating foods, with a restriction of\r\nflesh foods especially, is a precept which the great majority of\r\nwell-to-do people need to attend to.\r\n\r\nBilious attacks, headaches, indigestion, etc., are simply nature's\r\nprotest against the excess of food being forced upon her, and the\r\nnatural cure is to severely restrict, or still better, entirely stop\r\nthe food supply for a day or two. The idea that \"the system must be\r\nkept up\" is a very foolish one; people have lived for forty days and\r\nupwards on water alone, and a few days' fasting is a far safer remedy\r\nfor the troubles we have mentioned than purgative drugs.\r\n\r\nThose who have a stomach which quickly rebels against too much or\r\nunsuitable food, may, as Sir Henry Thompson says, congratulate\r\nthemselves on having a good janitor preventing the entrance of what\r\nwould injure. The man who can and does eat anything, rarely lives to\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nThe perfect appetite which comes from the moderate use of simple foods\r\nis a relish which must be experienced to be appreciated.\r\n\r\nOne way in which the amount of food needed to satisfy the appetite and\r\nbuild up the body may be very largely reduced, is by increasing the\r\namount of mastication. If each bite of food is chewed and chewed until\r\nit is all reduced to a liquid state, the amount required will be less\r\nthan half of what is usually taken, and so much less strain will be\r\nthrown on the excretory organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeet, Cold.--Continued coldness of the feet gives rise to many more\r\nserious troubles, and should always be attended to. There is no better\r\ncure than daily BATHING THE FEET (_see_), followed by rubbing for\r\nseveral minutes, say five, with hot olive oil after drying. Rub\r\nbriskly, until the feet glow. Put on dry warm stockings, and see that\r\nall foot-gear is kept as dry as possible. Another method of curing cold\r\n_sweaty_ feet is to rub the soles with CAYENNE \"TEA\" (_see_), and\r\nafterwards with warm olive oil. Dry carefully, and wear an extra pair\r\nof dry cotton socks or stockings. When the sweating is very abundant\r\nand obstinate, there is usually more or less failure in the nerves\r\nwhich keep the skin in order. The feet must then be properly _bathed_\r\n(_see_ Bathing the Feet), then dried and treated with cayenne lotion as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeet Giving Way.--Where there is a great deal of standing to be done by\r\nany one, the feet sometimes yield more or less at the arch of the\r\ninstep. This becomes flattened, and even great pain ensues; lameness\r\nsometimes follows. Young girls who have to stand much are especially\r\nliable to suffer in this way. In the first place _rest must be had_.\r\nWise masters will provide due rest for their employees, foolish ones\r\noverwork them. Rest is not against, but in favour of work; work cannot\r\nbe well done without due rest. The proper rest for feet such as we\r\nspeak of will be the most easy and comfortable position. _Comfort_ is\r\nthe test of the right treatment. Bathe the feet in hot water for a good\r\nwhile, using plenty of soap. Rub gently with hot olive oil, pressing\r\nany displaced bones into, or near, their place. Carefully avoid giving\r\npain. Massage similarly with oil the whole limb, and also the back\r\n(_see_ Massage). Do this every day at least once. You may have months\r\nto wait, but a sound limb is worth a good deal of patience. When\r\nstanding is absolutely necessary, strips of strong sticking plaster\r\npassed down from above the ankle bones, and round under the instep,\r\nhelp greatly.\r\n\r\nBoots are better than shoes, and should be comfortably easy, with low\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever.--In all fevers, to _cool down_ the excessive heat of the patient\r\n(_see_ Heat, Internal) is the best process of treatment. This may be\r\nbest done by continued cooling of the head. Have a towel well wrung out\r\nof cold water. Fold it so as to envelop the head. Press it gently to\r\nthe head all round, changing the place of pressure frequently. Have a\r\nsecond towel ready, and continue cooling with freshly cooled towels\r\nperhaps for an hour or an hour-and-a-half. Then leave the last cold\r\ntowel on, and put a dry towel above it. The next cooling, when the\r\nfever heat again arises, may be given, if it can be managed, by placing\r\na cold towel along the spine. Cover this with a dry one, and let the\r\npatient lie on it. Change this, though not quite so frequently as in\r\nthe case of the head. Work _carefully and gently_, so as not to annoy\r\nthe patient. If ice can be had, it may be put in the water used to cool\r\nthe cloths. If the feet be cold, foment them in a blanket (_see_\r\nFomentation). Keep this on the feet for an hour. There will most likely\r\nbe great relief with even one course of such treatment. It must,\r\nhowever, be _persevered in_ until the fever be conquered. In any case\r\nof fever, when a patient is too weak to bear the hot fomentation and\r\ncold towels, we would recommend rubbing the feet and limbs if cold with\r\nhot oil, and the stomach and chest, and if possible the back with soap\r\nlather. It is well at first to soap the stomach only, and for some\r\ntime; and each time till the last it is well to wipe off what you have\r\nrubbed on, so that the skin may be as clean as possible for the next.\r\nTo do this only once is often quite sufficient to soothe, so that the\r\npatient falls off into a gentle, natural sleep.\r\n\r\nNow, no one need imagine that there is any difficulty in the way of\r\nanyone carrying out the right treatment. We have known a young sister\r\nwho saw her brother brought home in fever. The medical man predicted a\r\nlong and serious illness, and the necessity of being prepared for all\r\nthe usual features of such a case. The sister heard all in thoughtful\r\nsilence, but when the doctor went away she said to herself, \"May not I\r\nlower this flame? At any rate I will try.\" So through the night she so\r\neffectually cooled her brother's head that when the medical man came\r\nnext day he expressed his most agreeable disappointment, saying, \"It is\r\nto be a very light case after all.\" So it turned out to be, but it\r\nwould not have been so but for that brave sister's aid. We cannot but\r\nearnestly beseech all who have the opportunity to go and do likewise.\r\nOften, especially among the poor, dirt and hot, close air have made the\r\nfever room a source of frightful danger to all around. Absolute\r\ncleanliness, abundance of pure air, and disinfection of the stools,\r\nshould always be attended to.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever at Night.--Frequently, in illness, a fever sets in as night\r\napproaches, and increases toward midnight, passing away during the day.\r\nThe treatment may be as below for Intermitting Fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Delirium in.--_See_ Delirium.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Gastric.--In this fever, now known as a form of Typhoid, the\r\ndisease spreads a sort of blight over the nervous centres, and from the\r\nfirst greatly lowers their power. The patient is too weak to bear the\r\npowerful cooling recommended in Fever; there is also a tendency to\r\nprolonged and \"low\" fever. First of all, in such a case, the feet and\r\nlegs must be fomented. Watch against burning the patient, but get as\r\ngood and powerful a heat as possible right up over the knees. Then\r\nafter about fifteen minutes the cooling of the head may proceed as in\r\nfever. Both cooling and heating must proceed together.\r\n\r\nWe must think of not merely relieving, but of curing the patient, by\r\nattacking the poisonous substance where it has lodged in the nerve\r\ncentres of the bowels. Pure water, with just as much acetic acid or\r\nvinegar dropped into it as will make it taste the least sour, should be\r\ngiven in tablespoonfuls (and hot) as frequently as the patient can take\r\nit without discomfort. If possible it should be distilled water, or\r\nrain water filtered, but certainly as pure and soft as can be procured.\r\nThere is no drug that can be prescribed that is equal to pure water,\r\nand no acid better than common white vinegar. These three things--the\r\nstrong fomentation of the feet and legs, the cooling of the head, and\r\nthe dissolution of the poisonous substances by means of pure water, and\r\ntheir counteraction by means of acid in very small strength--will do\r\nwonders in gastric fever. The \"turn\" may be secured in a week instead\r\nof three, if these things are skilfully and persistently applied. We\r\nshould say that the strong fomentation and cooling of the head should\r\nnot be done oftener than twice a day, and only once if the patient\r\nfeels too weak for twice. But as a general rule, the person who is ill\r\nwill wish these things at least twice a day. The sips of water should\r\nbe given, say in a dozen separate tablespoonfuls at a time, at least\r\nthrice a day--oftener if desired by the patient.\r\n\r\nFor food there is nothing equal to good fresh buttermilk. All alcoholic\r\ndrinks are damaging in a high degree in such an illness as this. Sweet\r\nmilk, if somewhat diluted with good water, will do, but there is\r\nnothing so good as the buttermilk fresh from the churn.\r\n\r\nAbsolute rest in bed is necessary, and no solid food should be given to\r\nthe patient until his temperature has been ten days at normal point.\r\nAll food given in the illness should be liquid enough to pass through\r\nthe meshes of a milk strainer. Care should be taken in this matter, as\r\ndeath has often followed the taking of solid food, when otherwise\r\nrecovery would have come.\r\n\r\nMilk should always form the largest portion of the diet, and may be\r\ngiven with arrowroot or oatflour. Beef tea is of little use, and is\r\nalways to be avoided if there is a tendency to diarrhoea. Plenty of\r\ncold water may always be given.\r\n\r\nIn a community which is visited by gastric fever as an epidemic this\r\nfact is striking--only a portion of the people are affected by the\r\nvisitation. Here is one man who drinks the water which gives gastric\r\nfever to another; that water goes into his stomach as it does into that\r\nof his neighbour, and passes through his system the same, yet death is\r\nthe result in one case, and not even sickness or inconvenience in the\r\nother. In the latter case the system has the power of resistance, and\r\nour aim should be to increase this. Therefore we say by all means look\r\nto the healthful state of the lungs and bowels when you have the least\r\nreason to fear that bad water may bring gastric fever to you or yours.\r\nIf there is any tendency to constipation get some liquorice, and boil\r\nit thoroughly with about half an ounce of senna leaves to a twopenny\r\nstick. Strain well, and let all in any danger have a teaspoonful of\r\nthis thrice a day. It will do wonders in keeping matters in a good\r\nstate within. If possible, give a good rubbing all over once a week\r\nwith hot vinegar, and follow that up with warm olive oil. That will do\r\na great deal to keep things right outside. Take and give more rest than\r\nusual to the toil-worn when such danger is near, and have as good food\r\nprovided for all as is possible. There may be danger in the air, and\r\nstill worse danger in the water to those whose vital force has got low,\r\nwhile there is none in either to those whose systems are in good tune.\r\n\r\nYou are, perhaps, ready to ask if we care nothing about bad water?\r\nCertainly; we care a great deal about it, as we do about bad air. By\r\nall means condemn wells and streams that are corrupted, and insist on\r\nthe opening of better ones. Make it a first condition of having\r\nanything to do with a place for habitation that it has good air and\r\ngood water. We are only pointing out the best safeguard when neither\r\nthe one nor the other can be insured.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where water is suspected, it should be boiled before use.\r\n\r\nThere is, in great numbers of persons, both old and young, what may be\r\ncalled the natural aptitude of healing. They are kept back from trying\r\nto help because it is regarded as so dangerous a thing to go near\r\nfever, and also to interfere where only professional skill is legally\r\nallowed. To apply such a remedy as that which we have here sketched for\r\ngastric fever is perfectly safe in both senses. No medical man worthy\r\nof being regarded will find any fault with it, and there is no danger\r\nto either the patient or the person applying it.\r\n\r\nThe mode we have pointed out involves nothing that may not be easily\r\nhad by the very poorest. What is wanted is only one or two who shall be\r\nChristian enough to care just a little for human bodies as well as\r\nhuman souls, and who shall study such simple and accessible remedies,\r\nand be ready to guide their fellow-creatures in a time of trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Hay.--_See_ Hay Fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Influenza.--This is a slow, smouldering kind of fever. For\r\ntreatment, pack the feet and legs in hot fomentation over the knees,\r\nand apply cold cloths over the stomach and heart, taking care in\r\napplying the cold if the patient is weak. In such a case only\r\nmoderately cool cloths should be used. Carry out these two processes\r\neffectively, and a cure should soon result. Give light food--milk and\r\nwater, and milk diet generally. Give small quantities frequently rather\r\nthan a good deal at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Intermitting.--For this the treatment may be given as in gastric\r\nfever, and, in addition, the stomach and bowels should be carefully\r\nlathered over with soap lather (_see_ Lather). This has a wonderfully\r\nsoothing effect. It may be spread with the hand over the skin, and\r\nfresh supplies gently rubbed on until much of the fever is removed.\r\nSome five minutes' lathering at a time is enough--this may be done\r\nseveral times a-day. Carefully dry after it, and let the patient rest.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to anticipate such attacks by softening the skin when\r\nit shows a tendency to be hard and dry. A gentle rubbing now and again\r\nwith fine lather and good olive oil will secure this. We say lather and\r\noil because, when there is no fever heat, lather by itself is too\r\ncooling, but when mixed with a little oil the mixture is comforting\r\nrather than chilling, and softens nicely.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Rheumatic.--This results from severe damp chills, usually\r\nfollowing exhaustion from some cause. Its best treatment at an early\r\nstage is by heat applied to the spinal nerves. If the trouble be\r\nchiefly in the legs, treat the lower back; if in the arms, treat the\r\nupper back. The heat is best applied by a large BRAN POULTICE (_see_).\r\nA teaspoonful of tincture of Guaiacum may be given before each\r\npoulticing, which may be done twice a day for an hour. We have known an\r\nillness that threatened to last six weeks cured in one week by this\r\nmeans. Give also teaspoonfuls of hot water from time to time.\r\n\r\nWhere the trouble has advanced to severe fever, and swelling of the\r\njoints, an entirely different treatment is best. Let a lather of soap\r\nbe made (_see_ Lather), and spread over the chest first, and afterwards\r\ngradually over the whole body. After four or five coats of lather have\r\nbeen put on, wipe off with a dry cloth, and proceed to lather again. We\r\nhave seen half-an-hour of this treatment, well done, greatly relieve\r\nthe fever; it was continued twice a day, and in three days the trouble\r\nwas conquered. Care must be taken not to chill the patient. The soaping\r\ncan be accomplished with only a small part of the body uncovered at\r\nonce, and, with proper precautions, the bed can be kept perfectly dry.\r\nIf a proper liniment is procured and lints sprinkled with it wrapped\r\nround the joints, the pain will be wonderfully relieved. But such\r\nliniments are only to be had on the prescription of a really good\r\nmedical man, who will not, if he really seeks to heal, and knows his\r\nbusiness, object to our treatment being applied.\r\n\r\nSometimes, after rheumatic fever, one or more of the joints become\r\nstiff. This stiffness varies in different cases from an apparently\r\ncomplete solidifying of the joint to only a slight inconvenience in its\r\nuse. We have seen many such joints, even very bad cases, completely\r\ncured by a proper use of _heat_ and _massage_. It is, however, no\r\ntrifling matter to undertake the necessary work, and perseverance is an\r\nabsolute requisite. Even very obstinate stiffening will _in time_ be\r\novercome by frequent and strong fomentation, followed by rubbing with\r\nolive oil in such a way as to squeeze gently all the muscles and sinews\r\nof the limb, and move them under the skin. This should be followed by\r\n_gentle_ bending of the joint, back and forward as far as it will go\r\n_without pain_. It may need to be done twice a day for many weeks, yet\r\nthe result is worth even more trouble, when you literally make the\r\n\"lame to walk\" (_see_ Rheumatism).\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Scarlet, or Scarlatina.--As a first precaution, when an epidemic\r\nof this exists, children should be sponged twice a week all over with\r\nhot vinegar before being put to bed. This is a powerful preventive. If\r\nanything like sore throat appears, bathe the child's feet in hot water\r\nuntil a free perspiration is produced. Dry well, _under a blanket_, and\r\nrub all over with hot vinegar, then put the patient to bed. If in the\r\nmorning there is no evident fever, repeat the sponging with hot\r\nvinegar, dry well, rub with hot olive oil, and dry again. If the fever\r\ndefinitely develops, place the child in a light airy room, from which\r\nall unnecessary carpets, curtains and furniture have been removed. No\r\none should enter this room except those on duty in nursing, nor should\r\nany from the house ride in public conveyances or attend meetings. These\r\nprecautions are just as necessary in slight as in severe cases, as\r\ninfection from a mild case may cause a fatally severe attack in another\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nWhere the rash of the fever seems reluctant to appear, the SOAPY\r\nBLANKET (_see_) will bring it out very speedily. But the above simple\r\ntreatment is usually sufficient. When vomiting is almost the first\r\nsymptom, six teaspoonfuls of hot water are to be taken every ten\r\nminutes for an hour; then treat as above with foot-bath, hot vinegar,\r\nand oil.\r\n\r\nIn a severe case have medical aid if at all possible. Where there is\r\ngreat fever spread a large dry towel or sheet on the bed. Lay one wrung\r\nout of lukewarm water on it; let the patient lie down on this.\r\nCarefully wrap him up in the damp cloth, then over that wrap the dry\r\none, with a blanket outside over all, and the bedclothes above. This\r\nwill certainly soothe for a time. It may be repeated every two hours,\r\nfor twenty minutes or half-an-hour at a time, night and day, till the\r\nfever is subdued.\r\n\r\nFor nourishment in succeeding weakness, give milk and boiling water,\r\nmixed in equal parts, every two hours. If stimulants are required, give\r\nCAYENNE \"TEA\" (_see_), reduced in strength until it just _slightly_\r\nburns the mouth, half a teacupful every half-hour. Cool the head also\r\nif necessary, as directed for typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever, Typhoid.--Treat as under Fever, Gastric, and Fever. In addition,\r\ngreat care should be taken to disinfect and destroy any stools, and\r\nespecially to prevent these getting into any drinking water.\r\n\r\nKeep the patient at rest in bed.\r\n\r\nNo solid food should be given during the _whole course_ of the illness.\r\nMilk mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water is best. Give only a\r\nwineglassful at a time, as often as the patient can take it. If the\r\npatient craves solid food, it must _on no account_ be given. It is\r\nalmost certain to cause a relapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFits.--_See_ Convulsions; Nervous Attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlannel Bands.--_See_ Band, Flannel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlatulence.--This is the accumulation of gases in the body, usually\r\ncaused by fermentation of the food at some part of the digestive\r\nprocess. A failure of the vital energy in the stomach and related\r\norgans is generally the cause. Over-exertion, worry, grief, any\r\nprolonged strain, will cause this failure. As first treatment, then,\r\nthe _cause_ should be removed, if this be at all possible. Do less\r\nwork, cultivate simple faith in God instead of worry. Do not sorrow\r\nover-much. The best material remedy is to take tablespoonfuls of hot\r\nwater every few minutes for several hours. If cold, the feet should be\r\nbathed (_see_ Bathing Feet), or fomented, for about an hour at a time.\r\nThese two simple remedies will generally prove sufficient, if\r\npersevered in.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlushings, Hot.--These are often a really serious trouble, especially\r\nto women, at certain stages of life. Most often they come about the age\r\nof fifty, but in weakly persons may occur at any time. A disturbance in\r\nthe nervous system, due to lack of energy, is the cause of such\r\nfeelings. They are often accompanied by DEPRESSION (_see_). Any\r\ntreatment ought to be directed to strengthening the nervous system. A\r\ngood plain diet, easy to digest, is a most important matter. Soaping\r\nwith soap lather over all the body (_see_ LATHER) will greatly restore\r\nthe tone of the nerves of the skin. This may be done every night, and\r\nthe CAYENNE LOTION (_see_) rubbed all over every morning for a week or\r\ntwo. This treatment will usually prove successful in curing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFomentation.--Some general remarks on this important treatment we give\r\nhere. First, no fomenting should be done for at least an hour after a\r\nmeal. And it should usually be followed by a period of complete rest. A\r\nvery good way to foment any part of the back or front of the body is by\r\nan india-rubber bag of hot water of the proper size and shape, with two\r\nor three ply of moist flannel between the bag and the skin. These bags\r\ncan now be had of very various sizes and shapes, and one or more should\r\nbe in every house. In fomenting a knee, foot, or ankle, a good sized\r\nhalf or even whole blanket is necessary. Fold this one way until it is\r\ntwenty inches broad. Lay it out on a clean floor or table, and sprinkle\r\n_sparingly_ boiling water across one end. Roll this end over and\r\nsprinkle the roll, turn over again and sprinkle again, and so on until\r\nthe whole is rolled up. Thoroughly knead and twist it, so that all is\r\npenetrated by the moist heat (_see_ illustration, page 32). Or it may\r\nbe prepared by soaking the blanket in boiling water, and wringing it\r\nout with a wringing machine. It may then be unrolled and unfolded so as\r\nto permit proper wrapping round the limb to be fomented. Care must be\r\ntaken not to _burn_ the patient, or give any shock by applying the\r\nfomentation too hot. It must be comfortable. _See_ Heat And Weakness.\r\n\r\nSometimes fomentation may seem to increase the pain, say in a swelled\r\nlimb, and yet we should persevere in the treatment. This may seem to\r\ncontradict our dictum that we should be guided by the feelings of the\r\npatient. The reason is that if some dead matter has lodged deep down in\r\nthe limb, it will have to be brought up to the surface ere the diseased\r\nstate can be remedied. If strong fomentation is used in such a case, it\r\nis not unlikely to increase the painfulness of the limb, and a swelling\r\nmay appear. It will at once be said that the disease is \"getting\r\nworse.\" This is quite a mistake--the increased pain is arising from\r\nsuch stirring of life as will bring about a complete cure. If the\r\ntreatment is continued, the swelling will by-and-by come to a head and\r\nburst, and can be treated as in Abcess.\r\n\r\n\r\nFomentation, Armchair.--This is applied as follows. Over a large\r\narmchair spread a folded sheet. Provide a good large blanket prepared\r\nas above in Fomentation. Then rub the haunches, thighs, lower back and\r\nabdomen of the patient with a little olive oil. Wrap these parts in a\r\nwarm dry towel. Open up the hot blanket and spread it (still some\r\nthree-ply thick) on the sheet on the armchair. Let the patient sit down\r\nupon it as soon as it is cool enough not to hurt. Fold the blanket all\r\nround the patient's lower body and thighs. Draw the sheet over all, and\r\ncover up well to retain the heat. At the end of an hour, or such less\r\ntime as the patient can endure, a smart washing with hot vinegar, and a\r\ngentle rub with warm olive oil, will complete the treatment. This is\r\nbest done at bedtime, as the patient must go to bed immediately after\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn cases of failure of the large hip-joints, or of the lower limbs, in\r\nsciatica and lumbago, the armchair fomentation is of great use; also\r\nwhen running sores exist from one of the hips or lower back, or even in\r\nnumbness or lack of vitality in the feet and toes. It is referred to\r\nunder the headings of the troubles in which it is of advantage.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we are dealing with lack of vitality in some organ in the\r\nlower part of the body. We argue that the nerves supplying this organ\r\nare needing in some way to be increased in force. This is to be done by\r\ngetting them heated. There is an arrangement in nature which hinders\r\nthis being quickly done. The rapid circulation of the blood which is\r\ngoing on all round these nerves tends to keep them about the same\r\ntemperature. The heat, as it is applied, passes off rapidly in the\r\nstream of the blood. But if the heating process is carried on long\r\nenough, the whole blood of the body becomes gently raised in\r\ntemperature, and by-and-by the heat applied to the surface reaches the\r\nroots of the nerves, not only by means of the circulation, but by\r\ngradually passing through the skin muscles, and the bones that are near\r\nit. New life is infused, and that where it is specially required. The\r\nflagging organ soon shows that it responds to this true stimulant.\r\nAfter a few such fomentations it begins to act as perhaps it has ceased\r\nto act for months, and even for years. We speak of what we have seen\r\nagain and again in cases where distress was caused by what is called\r\n\"sluggishness\" in some important organ, or when such an organ was\r\naltogether ceasing to act properly. The armchair fomentation is more\r\nsuccessful than the hot sitz-bath, though this is by no means to be\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood and Mental Power.--Unsuitable or ill-cooked food has a most\r\nserious effect on the mental powers; and when we take the case of a\r\nmental worker, we see that, in order to carry this power right on\r\nthrough a long life, proper diet is of great importance. Also many good\r\nmental workers are more sensitive than ordinary men: they are more\r\neasily destroyed by strong drink or opium. The nip of brandy, the\r\nsoothing draught, are terrible dangers to such. Instances of brain\r\npower continued far into old age are always lessons in plainness of\r\ndiet and temperance. One such temperate man will do as much work as ten\r\nwho are luxurious eaters, tipplers, and smokers. Diet for mental\r\nworkers should be light and easily digested, with a preponderance of\r\nproteid food (_see_ Diet). Rich, tough and fatty foods, and hot\r\nstimulating drinks should be avoided. As mental work is generally\r\nsedentary work, and consequently having a constipating tendency, some\r\nof the vegetable foods giving a stimulus to the muscles of the\r\nintestines should form a part of the diet, such as green vegetables,\r\nfruits, and oatmeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood in Health.--As will be seen from many of these articles, the\r\nquestion of diet is one of the greatest importance, in health as well\r\nas in disease. The onset of disease is, in fact, often due to\r\nlong-continued abuse of the whole digestive system through the use of\r\nunsuitable food. By unsuitable food, we mean not so much food that is\r\nbad in itself, but rather that which is not suited to the temperament\r\nor work of the eater, or to the climate and circumstances in which he\r\nfinds himself. A ploughman or fisherman, for example, may thrive on\r\ndiet which will inevitably produce disease in the system of one whose\r\nwork confines him to the house for the most of his time. One condition\r\nof a healthy life is, therefore, careful consideration of our work and\r\ncircumstances before deciding on our diet. Also, a man of excitable and\r\nirritable temperament will need different diet from one of a slow and\r\nquiet nature. The food which will only stimulate the latter will\r\nover-excite the former, and may even make him quite ill. What is\r\ncommonly called bad temper is often only the result of wrong diet, and\r\nwill disappear under a milder course of food. It will, of course, be\r\nseen at once from this, that the case of every man must be considered\r\nby itself. A decision as to proper diet can therefore only be made when\r\nall the facts about a case are known, and in this matter the man\r\nhimself must decide a good deal for himself; nevertheless some general\r\ndirections can be given which will help our readers to a decision in\r\ntheir own case.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we would guard against a very common error--viz.,\r\nthat a smaller quantity of food, _chemically_ of a less nutritive kind,\r\nmeans less nourishment to the body. On this head we refer to the\r\narticles on Digestion and Assimilation. It may only be remarked here\r\nthat what the _body actually uses_, and what is _taken into the\r\nstomach_, are two very different things. It is often the case that food\r\ncontaining less actual nourishment will give greater nourishment to the\r\nbody than chemically richer food, because the former fits the state of\r\nthe digestive system better. What each one must consider is, not what\r\nfood has most of the chemical elements needed by the body, but what\r\nfood will give up to his own body the most of these elements.\r\n\r\nAnother error is that the use of medicine can for long assist the body\r\nto use heavier food. In a case of disease, medicine often is of the\r\ngreatest value as a temporary aid to digestion, but its continual use\r\nis the parent of great evils, and at last defeats the very end for\r\nwhich it was given. If a person needs continually to use medicine,\r\nthere is probably either some organic disease present, _or, more\r\ncommonly, great errors in the diet taken_. Avoiding medicine, then,\r\nexcept as a very temporary resource, and remembering that food is to be\r\njudged more by the way it agrees with us than by its chemical\r\nconstitution, what rules can we give for diet in certain common cases?\r\n\r\nFirst, diet should vary in summer and winter as the season varies.\r\nFoods rich in fat, such as ham and bacon, should be for winter use\r\nonly, and should even then be more or less used as the weather is cold\r\nor mild. For summer diet, milk foods, such as milk puddings, etc., ripe\r\nfruits, and green vegetables should predominate, being varied also with\r\nthe heat or coolness of the weather. In very hot summer weather, animal\r\nfood should be very sparingly partaken of. It must also be borne in\r\nmind that warm clothing or heated rooms may convert a winter climate\r\ninto a summer one.\r\n\r\nSecond, diet should vary according to the occupation of the eater. The\r\nwriter and brain-worker will do best, as a rule, on little butcher\r\nmeat, taking chiefly fish, eggs, and light milk foods, with vegetables\r\nand fruits. Alcohol in any form is especially fatal to brain-workers,\r\nand must be avoided, if there is to be really good health.\r\n\r\nThird, food must vary according to temperament, age, etc. To give rules\r\nunder this head is almost impossible. The growing boy will need\r\nproportionately more food than the adult, the man more than the woman.\r\nIt is indeed true here that what is one man's food is another man's\r\npoison, and that every man must find out for himself what he needs. It\r\nmay be generally said that the food which digests without the eater\r\nbeing aware in any way of the process is the best for him.\r\n\r\nIt may safely be affirmed in relation to this question of food in\r\nhealth, that the middle and upper classes eat quite too much. Hence the\r\nstomach trouble and goutiness (often in a disguised form) that they\r\nsuffer from. Too much carbonaceous food will produce corpulency, and\r\ntoo much animal food URIC ACID (_see_). On the other hand, the poor,\r\nfor want of knowledge of really economical nourishing foods, suffer\r\nfrom want of nutrition.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity is always present, in case of sickness among the poor,\r\nby philanthropic persons to inculcate the value of good food. Instead\r\nof bringing a basket of beef tea, tea, and jelly, take oatmeal, fruit,\r\nmilk, and vegetables.\r\n\r\nWhat we have said should be sufficient as a hint to those who wish to\r\nregulate their diet on common-sense principles. A little careful\r\nthought should enable any one to work out a satisfactory scheme of diet\r\nfor his own particular case. Regularity in meals is of great\r\nimportance. There should be fixed hours for meals, with which nothing\r\nshould be allowed to interfere, no matter how pressing the business may\r\nbe. Do not assume, however, that it is necessary to eat at meal times,\r\nno matter whether appetite for food be present or not. To eat without\r\nappetite is an infringement of natural law, and it is far better to go\r\nwithout the meal if nature does not demand it than to yield to custom,\r\nor to imagine it necessary to eat because the dinner bell has rung. If\r\nnot hungry do not eat at all, wait till the next meal time; do not take\r\na \"snack\" in an hour or two. Three meals are, as a rule, better than\r\nmore, and many have found two suit them best. Probably one-half the\r\nhuman race (the inhabitants of China and Hindostan) live on two meals a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nFood in Illness.--Light, easily digested food is of the first\r\nimportance in many illnesses. To know easily procured and simple foods,\r\nwhich are really light, is a great matter. Saltcoats biscuits (_see_\r\nBiscuits and Water) form one of the best and most nourishing foods. So\r\ndoes oatmeal jelly, prepared by steeping oatmeal in water for a night,\r\nor for some hours, straining out the coarse part, and boiling the\r\nliquor until it will become jelly-like when cold. Oatmeal steeped in\r\nbuttermilk for a time, and then moderately boiled, makes an excellent\r\ndiet. Wheaten meal or barley meal may be used for these dishes instead\r\nof oatmeal, according to taste. Many other dishes, with rice,\r\narrowroot, sago, etc., will suggest themselves to good cooks; but for\r\nsustaining the invalid and producing healthy blood, none surpass those\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFright.--Some most distressing troubles come as the result of frights.\r\nIn many cases much may be done to relieve such troubles, which arise\r\nfrom severe shock to the brain and nervous system. The results may be\r\nvery various--from mere stomach troubles to paralysis--but the cure in\r\nall cases lies mainly in giving fresh energy to the nervous system.\r\n\r\nIf a blanket fomentation is placed all up and down the back, over a\r\nrubbing of warm olive oil, and the excited person is laid on that, one\r\ngood step will have been taken in the way of restoration. Then this may\r\nbe aided by cool cloths very cautiously laid over the stomach and\r\nbowels, so as to cool in front, while heat is given at the back. This\r\nwill be specially desirable if the heat at the back is rather high.\r\nWhen the blanket loses its heat it need not be taken off, but a\r\npoultice of bran, highly heated, may be placed under it, so that the\r\nheat from the bran may come gradually and comfortably through, and pass\r\ninto the body in that gradual way. So soon as a sense of genial comfort\r\nspreads over the back, it will be found that a right state is stealing\r\nover the organs that were threatened by paralysis through the alarm.\r\nThe defect very soon disappears.\r\n\r\n\r\nGangrene.--_See_ Cancer in Foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nGatherings.--_See_ Abscess; Ankle; Armpit; Bone, Diseased.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiddiness and Trembling.--This comes very often as the result of loss\r\nof nerve power in the spinal system, due to weakness, shock, or simply\r\nold age. A great deal may be done to relieve, and in many cases to\r\ncompletely cure, by the following simple means. Wrap the patient round\r\nthe middle in a soapy blanket, rubbing well afterwards with hot olive\r\noil. Give an hour's fomentation at a time each night for a few nights;\r\nrest for a day or two, and repeat. The fomentation must be a blanket\r\none, but should only extend from the armpits to the hips, not over the\r\nlimbs. For treatment of giddiness arising from the stomach see\r\nIndigestion. Half a teacupful of hot water every ten minutes for five\r\nhours is usually an effective cure. This should be done daily for three\r\ndays. Let it be kept in mind that we must not have \"hard\" water--that\r\nis, water impregnated with mineral substances, such as lime or iron. We\r\nmust have \"soft\" water, that is, such as rain water nicely filtered, or\r\n\"distilled\" water, which can be had from any good chemist for twopence\r\na quart.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlands of Bowels.--_See_ Bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlands, Swollen.--This is a very common trouble, especially in the\r\nyoung. To restore the skin to healthy action is the first important\r\nmatter. This may be done by bathing the feet (_see_ Bathing the Feet)\r\nuntil free perspiration ensues, wrapping the patient meanwhile in a\r\nwarm blanket. Dry well, and sponge with hot vinegar and water; dry\r\nagain, rub with hot olive oil, and put to bed. As a diet, Saltcoats\r\nbiscuits and water for some time have of themselves formed a complete\r\ncure (_see_ Biscuits and Water). The _comfort_ of the patient will\r\nregulate the amount of bathing. Do this every night for a fortnight,\r\nexcept on the Sabbath (when rest from all treatment seems best). If the\r\nswelling be slight, two days' treatment may cure it; if the case be\r\nsevere and of long standing, a longer time will be required.\r\n\r\nFor treatment of the neck, if there is no sore, put round it a cloth\r\ndipped in hot vinegar, and a good poultice of bran or moist hot bag\r\nround over this. Put this on for half-an-hour before rising in the\r\nmorning. After taking them off, rub with warm olive oil, and wipe that\r\noff gently. Put a single band of fine new flannel round the neck for\r\nthe day. If there be suppuration, or running sores, treat in the same\r\nway unless the vinegar prove painful, when it may be weakened with\r\nwater until comfortable. This treatment will, we know, cure even a very\r\nbad case of tubercular glands. _See_ Wounds.\r\n\r\nThere are men so skilful in medicine that they can aid wonderfully in\r\nsuch cases, and surgeons so apt at operating that they too, can do much\r\ngood. But we should not for a moment think of leaving patients to\r\ndepend on what can be swallowed, or what lancet and probe can do, when\r\nthe very sources of life itself are neglected, and cures waited on for\r\nmonths that may be secured in a week or even less. Above all, when you\r\nknow how to do it, infuse new life in the body, and promote the\r\nthrowing off of that used-up matter which is showing itself in the\r\ndisease. How many parents bow down before the idea that swollen glands\r\nare constitutional to their children, when the fact is that these\r\nchildren have very fine skins, and need to have these kept in extra\r\ngood order, not merely in the way of washing, but so that they shall\r\nperform their part of throwing off this used-up material of the body\r\nefficiently. Some of the most beautiful of our race are thus lost to\r\nthe world when they might easily be saved.\r\n\r\nIn some cases swollen glands are caused by bad teeth, running from the\r\nEAR (_see_), sores or insects on the head, or inflamed tonsils. If such\r\ncauses are present, they should be removed. Extract bad teeth, cure\r\nrunning ears, and properly cleanse the head. Gargle the throat for\r\nswollen and inflamed tonsils with warm water, in which a little salt is\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\nGout.--Some have a predisposition to this most painful disease, and\r\nrequire to keep a strict watch on their diet. Meat, specially the\r\ninternal organs, meat extracts, alcohol, tea, and coffee must be\r\navoided, and milk, buttermilk and porridge, cheese, eggs, and\r\nvegetables, especially green vegetables, made into light and digestible\r\ndishes, should be relied on solely. Further, the diet should be a small\r\none, most thoroughly and slowly masticated, and plenty of pure water is\r\nadvisable, in order to help the elimination of the waste which causes\r\nthe trouble. _See_ Uric Acid.\r\n\r\nIf the feet be affected, apply gentle heat to the lower part of the\r\nspine by Fomentation (_see_). Sometimes a cold cloth on the lower spine\r\nwill soothe, but more often heat is the true cure. Wrap the sore foot\r\nin softest cotton, and foment _very gently_ through this, using only\r\n_warm_ cloths, and taking care to avoid giving pain. The cloths should\r\nbe just a little _below_ blood heat. Cold cloths are a serious mistake,\r\nbut at a temperature a little below blood heat a gentle soothing is\r\nproduced. Care must in every case be taken to do only what the patient\r\nfeels comforting.\r\n\r\n\r\nGravel.--Sometimes mere internal inflammation is mistaken for this\r\ndisease. In the case of inflammation of the bladder, apply a large hot\r\nBRAN POULTICE (_see_) to the lower back, and change cold towels over\r\nthe front of the body where the pain is. Afterwards rub all parts over\r\nwith hot olive oil, and wipe dry. Take only plain food, oat or\r\nwheat-meal porridge, Saltcoats biscuits, etc.\r\n\r\nWhere actual stones are formed, or a tendency to their formation\r\nexists, all water drunk should be distilled, or boiled rain water.\r\nWhere stones are present the heat may be applied to the back, but _no\r\ncold in front_. The soft water tends to dissolve the stones, the heat\r\nassists in their expulsion from the body. Diet same as in GOUT (_see_).\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth of Body.--See Limb, Saving a.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuaiacum.--This drug is a West Indian gum, and is one of those remedies\r\nwe are glad to say will do no harm, while in rheumatism and gout it is\r\nmost beneficial. A teaspoonful of the tincture in a cup of hot water,\r\nor one or two of the tabloids now so easily had, may be taken three\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHæmorrhage.--See Bleeding; Wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nHair Coming off.--There are many forms of this disfiguring trouble,\r\nboth in the case of young and old persons. It is chiefly due to a wrong\r\nstate of the skin of the head, which is best treated with careful\r\nrubbing with vinegar or weak acetic acid, and finishing with good olive\r\noil. The acid must not be used too strong--not stronger than ordinary\r\nvinegar. This may be done every evening, and should be rubbed on for\r\nfifteen minutes, till a comfortable feeling is aroused. Dry the head,\r\nand then rub on olive oil for five minutes. The vinegar should rather\r\nbe dabbed than rubbed on. Wash all over in the morning with M'Clinton's\r\nsoap. Or this treatment may be applied every other night, and on\r\nalternate nights the head may be packed up with lather (_see_ Head,\r\nSoaping). This treatment is quite safe, and will usually effect a cure,\r\nwhich is more than can be said of the expensive hair washes so much\r\nadvertised. Many of these are most dangerous. As far as possible go\r\nwith the head uncovered, and brush the hair frequently. Brushing\r\nstimulates the grease glands, and causes the hair to become glossy.\r\nProbably the reason men lose their hair so much more than women is that\r\nthe brushing and combing the latter must give it stimulates the hair\r\nroots. Massaging the skin of the scalp with the fingers night and\r\nmorning will greatly promote growth of the hair. _See_ Head, Massaging.\r\n\r\n\r\nHands, Clammy.--Rub the hands and arms well twice a day with CAYENNE\r\nLOTION (_see_).\r\n\r\n\r\nHands, Cold.--Much more than is readily believed depends on the state\r\nof the hands and feet. We are already familiar with the subject of\r\ncoldness in the feet, but we meet with cases in which the coldness of\r\nthe hands is as striking. It is not readily thought that cold hands\r\nhave anything to do with such illness, for instance, as that of bad\r\naction in the stomach. There are cases in which a very great deal can\r\nbe done to relieve a congested state of the vessels of the stomach, and\r\neven a similar state of the lungs, by only bathing the hands in hot\r\nwater and then rubbing them with hot oil till they have been thoroughly\r\nheated and reddened, as they are when effectually warmed.\r\nHalf-an-hour's bathing of hands in water just a little above blood heat\r\nproduces a wonderful effect on an invalid when there is too great\r\nweakness to stand longer treatment. This is well known to be true of\r\nhalf-an-hour's good feet bathing. In some cases bathing both of hands\r\nand feet is much needed. The overburdened heart finds it a vast benefit\r\nwhen by such a bathing the blood is allowed to flow easily through the\r\nvessels of the feet and hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nHands, Dry and Hard.--Pack the hands in SOAP LATHER (_see_) mixed with\r\na little fine olive oil. The soap must be finely lathered with a brush,\r\nnot _melted_. Pure soft water, never too hot nor too cold, should be\r\nused, and the hands thoroughly dried after washing. _See_ Chapped\r\nHands.\r\n\r\n\r\nHay Fever.--A most effective preventive and cure for this is the\r\ninhaling through the nostrils the vapour of strong acetic acid. The\r\nacid may be on a sponge enclosed in a smelling bottle, and its vapour\r\nmay be freely inhaled. Sponge all over each night with hot acid and\r\nwater. The head also may be wet with pretty strong acid, and tied up so\r\nas to keep in the vapour. Do not, however, use a waterproof covering.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeadache.--There is a vast variety of ailments associated with what is\r\ncalled headache. In itself, it is just more or less _pain_ in the head.\r\nWhen there is such pain, it means that some of the nerves in the head\r\nare in a wrong state, probably in nearly all cases a state of more or\r\nless _pressure_. This pressure hinders the free flow of vital action\r\nalong the nerve, and this hindrance we feel as pain. To remove the\r\npressure is, then, to relieve the pain. Pressure from overwork often\r\ncauses headache on week-days, which goes off on Sabbath. The _rest_\r\nhere removes the pressure, and so the pain. The pressure results from a\r\nfailure of energy in some part of the head, slight swelling then taking\r\nplace. To increase the energy is to effect a cure. This may be done by\r\nfirst, at bedtime, soaping the back with warm water and SOAP (_see_).\r\nThen dry, and rub firmly yet gently with hot olive oil, until the whole\r\nback glows with warmth. This may take perhaps fifteen minutes. Then\r\ngive three minutes of warm water pouring over the back. Dry again, and\r\noil with hot oil, and put the patient to bed. Avoid much tea. Avoid\r\naltogether tobacco and alcoholic liquors, which of themselves will\r\noften cause the trouble. This treatment applies to all that numerous\r\nclass of headaches which arise from overwork and fag. A cure may often\r\nbe had by its means, without taking a holiday. But where this can be\r\ndone, it is well to take it.\r\n\r\nThe headache, however, may be caused indirectly by the failure of some\r\nof the organs to do their duty, when other methods must be adopted. The\r\nuse of tobacco so injuriously affects the whole system that headache\r\noften results, and refuses to be cured unless the tobacco be given up.\r\nIt is hard to do this, but the difficulty must be faced. Cold, damp\r\nfeet are a common cause of headaches. Let these be well bathed (_see_\r\nBathing Feet) for some days, even twice or three times a day, and many\r\nkinds of headaches will be cured. Constipation, or sluggish action of\r\nthe bowels, frequently causes headache. The cure is obvious (_see_\r\nConstipation). Imperfect action of the kidneys also causes it. In such\r\na case apply a large, warm bran poultice (_see_) across the back behind\r\nthe kidneys. Oil the skin before and after poulticing. Do this once a\r\nday at bedtime for a week, if necessary, but not longer than a week at\r\na time. Take half a teacupful of water before each meal. Use freely the\r\nlemon drink described in Drinks, Refreshing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeadache, Sick.--The stomach and head affect each other powerfully, and\r\na disordered stomach causes severe headache, known as _sick headache_.\r\nIn many cases a few tablespoonfuls of hot water, taken at intervals of\r\nfive minutes, will effect a cure. He is himself \"simple\" who laughs at\r\nthis as \"simple.\" If a dose of hot water _cures_, and removes any need\r\nfor expensive drugs, that is a matter for thankfulness and not for\r\nlaughter. When some substance not easily dissolved has lodged in the\r\nstomach, hot water is often all that is needed to remove the trouble.\r\nBut it must be remembered that over-eating, or the eating of\r\nindigestible food, must be given up, and the food must be masticated\r\ntill it is reduced to a liquid condition.\r\n\r\nMany will say they have not time for this, but time must be taken, and\r\nhalf the quantity of food well masticated will nourish better than the\r\nwhole imperfectly masticated.\r\n\r\nHeadache on waking in the morning is a frequent result of stomach\r\ndisorder. In such a case take two teacupfuls of hot water, with an\r\ninterval of ten minutes between. In many cases a slice of lemon in the\r\nhot water powerfully aids to cure. Especially is this the case where\r\npains in the bowels are felt along with the headache. If lemons cannot\r\nbe had, a few drops of vinegar will form a good substitute. Continue to\r\ntake half a teacupful at intervals all day.\r\n\r\nSick headache may, however, arise from the head causing disorder in the\r\nstomach. The head may then be fomented gently, and if necessary soaped\r\n(_see_ Head, Skin of) or massaged (_see_ Head, Rubbing, Massage), which\r\nshould in most cases remove the trouble if carefully and well done.\r\n\r\nHeadaches are frequently caused by anxiety and worry, which have all\r\nthe marks of sick headache. Dull pain and heat, more or less\r\npersistent, also arise from this cause. The treatment for such cases is\r\ngiven in the preceding article for pressure from overwork. It is well\r\nto see, in such cases, that the mental and spiritual cures be applied,\r\nas well as the material. Let there be resolute putting away of all\r\nworrying ideas at night, and during every leisure time. Let perfect\r\ntrust in a loving Heavenly Father relieve us of all burdens. Much may\r\nthus be done to cure even a sore head and weary brain. We are of \"more\r\nvalue than many sparrows\" to One whose power and wisdom are really\r\ninfinite. Take both sides of this great truth, the spiritual and the\r\nmaterial, and you will find it a glorious help in worry and\r\ndisappointing failure. What a remedy it is when good medical treatment\r\nand true faith in God come together to give peace to the weary one!\r\n_See_ Worry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHead Baths.--_See_ Baths for Head.\r\n\r\n\r\nHead, Massaging the.--This is so important in many cases of neuralgia,\r\nheadache, and eye troubles, that we here describe it. The brow is first\r\ngently stroked _upward_ from behind, with the palm of the hand, while\r\nthe back of the patient's head rests against the chair or other\r\nsupport. The sides of the head are then similarly treated, using a hand\r\nfor each side simultaneously. Then the back of the head is stroked\r\nupward also. After this is well done, the top of the head is stroked\r\nsimilarly from front to back. Then the whole head, except the forehead,\r\nis rubbed briskly but lightly with the tips of the fingers with a\r\nscratching motion, but _not_ using the nails. This is best done piece\r\nby piece, taking care to do every part in turn. This treatment may be\r\noften alternated with the cooling of the head with cold towels, with\r\nthe best results. In all cases of head uneasiness and neuralgia it is\r\n_invaluable_ (_see_ Eyes, Paralysis of; Eyes, Squinting; Massage).\r\nFrequently a small part of the head will be found where the rubbing\r\nwith the finger tips is particularly soothing. Special attention, of\r\ncourse, should be given to this, as it is nature's guide to relief. But\r\nif pain and uneasiness result from the rubbing, it should be stopped,\r\nand some other cure substituted. Understand that what you have to do is\r\nto gently press the returning stream of venous blood on in its course\r\nfrom the weighted brow back over the top of the head. Rub very slowly\r\nand deliberately, as the stream you are affecting flows slowly. The\r\nfrequency with which you change from the rubbing to the cold cloth, and\r\nfrom that again to the rubbing, will depend a good deal on the heat\r\nthat you find persistent in the head, but usually you may rub two\r\nminutes and cool during one minute. More or less relief will come in a\r\nvery short time, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour there will\r\nbe a very great change for the better.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe had a very curious case lately. A little girl was brought to us one\r\nmorning who had been quite blind of one eye for a fortnight. We tried\r\nthe eye with a rather powerful lens, but she could see nothing. That\r\neye had a squint, which was also of a fortnight's standing. The pupil\r\nof the eye was dilated, but nothing else seemed wrong. The girl was\r\naffected with worms in some degree, but otherwise healthy. We gave her\r\nhead a massaging, such as we have been describing, for some ten minutes\r\nor so. She was given the first of four or five doses of santolina next\r\nmorning, which her mother said she threw up and some bilious matter\r\nbesides. She was brought to us an hour or so after, and we found that\r\nshe had forgotten which had been the blind eye. She now saw perfectly\r\nwith both, and the squint was gone. We had not tried whether the\r\nrubbing had had the curative effect before the santolina was given, or\r\nwhether it was after the latter that the sight was restored, but we are\r\ndisposed to think that the squinting and blindness both had given way\r\nto the head's improvement by the massaging.\r\n\r\n\r\nHead, Skin of the.--The nerves of sensibility are very largely supplied\r\nto the skin of the head, and many large nerves pass under it. It is\r\ntherefore an important matter that it be kept in a right condition. In\r\nvarious troubles it becomes hard and dry, and even contracts and\r\npresses very painfully upon the head, feeling as if it were dried\r\nparchment. The pain thus caused is different from neuralgia, and cannot\r\nbe relieved by cooling, but is easily cured by soaping the head (_see_\r\nHead, Soaping). This may be done every night, and the head tied up with\r\nthe soap lather until morning. It may then be sponged, dried, and a\r\nlittle hot olive oil rubbed into the skin. In a serious case, where the\r\npatient is in bed, this treatment may be given night and morning.\r\nAlways, in treating such a head, be very gentle, for the least touch is\r\noften painful to the irritated skin. The use of a pure and proper\r\npomade, such as some preparation of vaseline, is of importance where\r\nthe skin is dry, and tends powerfully to preserve the skin and hair in\r\nhealthy condition.\r\n\r\nCareful brushing of the hair, and rubbing of the skin of the scalp\r\nwill, too, be of use. _See_ Hair.\r\n\r\n\r\nHead, Soaping.--Have a piece of M'Clinton's soap, a good shaving brush,\r\nand a bowl of warm water. Rub the wet brush on the soap, and work the\r\nlather up in the hollow of the left hand, taking more soap and water in\r\nthe brush as necessary, until the left hand is full of creamy, thick\r\nlather. Lay this on all over the patient's head. Make another handful,\r\nand lay that on also. The lather may be wrought into the mass of hair\r\nuntil it reaches the skin, the brush being dipped in the warm water,\r\nand used to work the lather well into the skin of the head. This must\r\nbe continued until the whole head is thickly covered with fine white\r\nlather, like a wig in appearance. You need have no difficulty with ever\r\nso much hair. You only comb that nicely back at first, and place the\r\nsoap lather on the fore part of the head. Then you bring the hair\r\nforward, and soap the back part. You may work on at this process for\r\nhalf-an-hour. You will by that time have produced a most delightful\r\nfeeling in both body and mind of your patient. Tie a soft handkerchief\r\nover all, and leave for as long as needed--even all night if required.\r\nWhen removing the lather, use a sponge and warm vinegar or weak acid\r\n(_see_ Acetic Acid), and dry gently with a soft towel. This application\r\ncan be used with good effect in all cases of hard, dry skin on the\r\nhead, and formation of white scurf. It preserves the hair, and\r\nstimulates its growth. It also removes the painful sensitiveness to\r\ntouch so often felt in the hair and head skin. Care must ever be taken\r\nto do it all with a gentle hand. So done it is priceless in its\r\nsoothing and healing effects on irritable nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\nHead, Sounds in.--As the result and accompaniment of deafness these are\r\nsometimes most distressing, even preventing the patient from sleeping.\r\nThey are often caused by chill producing some inflammation of the ear,\r\nand stoppage of the internal or external air passages. Have a large\r\nFOMENTATION (_see_) carefully packed round the whole head. If properly\r\ndone, the patient will be comfortable in it for an hour. The\r\nfomentation must then be taken off, the head rubbed quite dry, and a\r\nwarm covering put on. Do this before bedtime for three or four nights.\r\nThen desist for three nights. After this place a hot BRAN POULTICE\r\n(_see_) on the back of the head, neck, and spine, so that the patient\r\ncan lie comfortably upon it for an hour. Oil before and after with\r\nolive oil. Give this at bedtime for three or four nights, and rest\r\nagain for three or four days more. Avoid exposure during this\r\ntreatment. It is suitable for all cases of ear trouble through chill.\r\n\r\nIt will be specially important to see that the feet are comfortable,\r\nand that health generally is looked to. _See_ Ears; Hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth and Money.--It will be noticed that the remedies we recommend\r\nare in almost every case very cheap--even, like hot water, costing\r\nnothing, as they are in every house. This very simplicity and\r\ncommonness has turned many against our treatment. We know, indeed, of\r\none curious case where olive oil was derided and despised by a\r\nrheumatic patient, until his friends got it labelled \"Poison, for\r\nexternal use only.\" It was then eagerly applied, and effected a cure.\r\nWe warn our readers very seriously against this folly. It is traded in\r\nby some who sell the simplest things as secret cures at exorbitant\r\nprices, and impoverish still further those who are poor enough already.\r\nThe _price_ of a drug or appliance is no indication of its value as a\r\ncure. Neither is its lack of price. Nor is the price of any particular\r\nfood or drink an indication of its value. Good and nutritious foods are\r\ngenerally cheap and easily procured. _See_ Diet, Economy in. Our effort\r\nhas been to find out cures within the reach of every household; and we\r\nhave found that, as God has put water and air freely within man's\r\nreach, so has He put those things which best cure disease within the\r\nreach of the poorest. Let us not then despise such things because they\r\nare common.\r\n\r\n\r\nHearing.--We have had so much success in helping the deaf that we feel\r\nwarranted in seeking to spread the knowledge of our methods as widely\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nDeafness is caused in many ways--very often by exposure of the head to\r\na chill, especially in infancy. We have seen it even arise from\r\nenclosing the head in a bag of ice with a view to extreme cooling. What\r\nis called \"throat deafness\" is a different matter, but yields to the\r\nsame treatment as the cases of chill. The process of cure is very\r\nsimilar to that used in cases of failing sight (_see_ under Eyes), for\r\nthe aural nerve has to be stimulated as the optic nerve in these cases.\r\nRub the back of the head and neck, using hot olive oil, and continuing\r\ngently, yet firmly, until all the parts are in a glow of heat. Do this\r\nsome time during the day. At night apply the BRAN POULTICE (_see_),\r\noiling before and after, to the back of head and neck, the patient\r\nlying down on it for an hour at bedtime. _Gently_ syringe the ears with\r\ntepid water, but only so far as to cleanse them. Rub with ACETIC ACID\r\n(_see_) behind the ears, but _not so as to cause soreness_. In an\r\nobstinate case continue treatment for a month, then rest for a\r\nfortnight, and continue for another month.\r\n\r\nCases of deafness arising from dryness and hardness in the ears are to\r\nbe treated differently. The ear is brushed internally with soap lather\r\n(_see_ Lather and Soap). Dip a brush, such as is used for water-colour\r\ndrawing, into hot water, rub it on the soap, and gently brush the\r\ninside of the ear. Renew the lather frequently, keeping up the heat.\r\nWith another brush moisten the same parts with fine almond oil. Gently,\r\nbut thoroughly, dry out the ear with a fine roll of lint or _soft_\r\ncotton. In a fortnight we have seen great benefit from this done daily\r\nor twice a day. Be careful not to use pressure on the inside of the ear\r\nwhen washing or drying, as this may cause the wax to harden into balls,\r\npressing on the drum. The whole head may also be rubbed with acetic\r\nacid, not so as to cause pain, but simply a strong heat in the skin. In\r\nall treatment of so delicate an organ as the ear, avoid giving _pain_.\r\n\r\nIf the deafness proceed simply from a relaxed state of the tissues in\r\nthe tubes of the ear, the cold douche applied to the head, with careful\r\ndrying and rubbing afterwards, will often effect a cure. But it is only\r\na _sudden_, _brief_, cold splash which is wanted, not a stream directed\r\nfor any time on the head, which might do serious injury. In this\r\nconnection it may be noticed that a child should never be punished by\r\n\"boxing its _ears_.\" Children have had their hearing permanently\r\ninjured by this thoughtless practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeartburn.--_See_ Acidity in Stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeat and Weakness.--We have over and over again shown in these papers\r\nhow heat passes into vital action, and gives strength to failing organs\r\nand nerves. But the heat supplied to these organs must be at a certain\r\ntemperature. All experience goes to show that _gentle_ heating will do\r\nall that is required. Moreover, too hot a fomentation, especially if a\r\nlarge one, will weaken the patient, and defeat its own ends. In such a\r\ncase it is folly to throw up the treatment, and say that heat weakens,\r\nwhen all that is needed is to apply heat at a lower temperature. The\r\nright degree of warmth is indicated by the comfort of the patient. It\r\nwill vary in almost every individual case, and must be found by careful\r\ntrial. Also it may vary from hour to hour. The heat comfortable during\r\nthe day may be found insufficient or too great by night, and so on. We\r\nmust in these matters apply our common sense, and make a real effort of\r\nthought, if we wish to be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeat, Internal.--There is a usual (normal) temperature in all the blood\r\nand tissues of the body. If the body be either warmer or colder than\r\nthis point (98.4 deg. Fahr.), its health is interfered with. A\r\n\"clinical thermometer\" is used to ascertain whether the bodily\r\ntemperature is normal or not. It is to be had at every druggist's, and\r\nis of great importance in a household. By its means the rise of\r\ntemperature can be detected often before any serious symptoms set in,\r\nand due means taken to check trouble in its early stages. The\r\ninstrument is used by putting it under the armpit, or, with children,\r\nbetween the legs, so that the mercury bulb is entirely enfolded and\r\nhidden between the arm, or leg, and the body. Left in this position for\r\nfive minutes, it is taken out and read. It may also be held in the\r\nmouth, under the tongue, with lips close on it.\r\n\r\nWhere a good deal of fever is shown, as by a rising of the mercury to\r\n101 deg., measures to reduce it should at once be taken, as shown in\r\nthe articles on various kinds of Fever. By watching the temperature,\r\nand taking it from time to time, we can see when cooling is sufficient.\r\nWhere the temperature is too low--that is, below 98-2/5 deg.--rub all\r\nover with warm olive oil, and clothe in good soft flannel. Other\r\nmethods for increasing vital action may also be tried, as given in many\r\nof our articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeel, Sprained.--Often in sprains all attention is given to the bruised\r\nand torn _muscles_, while similarly bruised and torn _nerves_ are\r\noverlooked; yet upon the nerves the perfect healing of the muscles\r\ndepends. Hence, in a sprain of the heel we must be careful not to\r\ndirect attention to the heel exclusively. That may be bathed (_see_\r\nBathing Feet) and duly rubbed with oil. A good plan is to apply cloths\r\ndipped in cold water and vinegar. Keep the limb perfectly still, and do\r\nnot attempt to use it for at least a fortnight. After this it may be\r\ncured to all appearance, yet a weakness may be left which prevents\r\nanything like the full and free use of the limb. It may be all right\r\nwhen resting, but suffers when used for any length of time: this\r\nindicates pretty plainly that _rest_ is needed, and is an essential\r\nthing for cure. But besides this rest, the foot should be packed during\r\nthe night in soap lather (_see_ Lather and Soap). Wash the foot in\r\nvinegar or weak acetic acid, rub the whole limb from the ankle\r\n_upwards_ in such a way as to draw the blood up from the foot, avoiding\r\nall down-strokes. Use a little olive oil in this rubbing. Note that the\r\nwhole limb needs treatment. The juice of _Lady Wrack_, such as is to be\r\nfound on the west coast of Scotland, is an excellent remedy for\r\nsprained joints; but we only mention it, as it must be inaccessible to\r\nmany of our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHiccup.--Though often but slight, disappearing in a few minutes by some\r\nsimple device, such as holding the breath, when long continued this\r\nbecomes most serious. Very often it is an added distress in trouble\r\nwhich is itself incurable; but while the patient's life cannot be\r\nsaved, the hiccup may be relieved. In the common case of infant hiccup,\r\na lessening of the over-supply of food may be all that is required. One\r\nor two teaspoonfuls of hot water given to the infant will usually give\r\nimmediate relief. For a grown-up person with a slight attack, one or\r\ntwo teacupfuls of the same will also usually prove a remedy. For\r\nserious cases the treatment is a large BRAN POULTICE (_see_) placed on\r\nthe back, opposite the stomach. Well oil the back before and after the\r\npoultice, and leave it on for an hour. If this fails, after a little,\r\nprepare a blanket as directed under Fomentation. Roll it up until it is\r\nthe size of the patient's back, and let him lie down on it. (Read here\r\narticle on Heat and Weakness.) Then a small cold towel may be passed\r\ngently over the stomach. This will generally relieve. It may be\r\nrepeated if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHip-Joint Disease.--Thorough heating, with moist heat is the best\r\ntreatment for this trouble. This implies time, work, and patience; but\r\nall these are well spent. Let a strong fomentation be given twice a day\r\nto the hip joint, with oiling before and after, each application\r\nlasting at least an hour (_see_ Cooling in Heating; Fomentation; Heat\r\nand Weakness). In all probability a gathering of matter will come to\r\nthe surface and discharge itself. Treat this as recommended in article\r\non Abscess, and persevere until the joint is thoroughly renovated. It\r\nmay take a time, and the treatment should always be intermitted on\r\nSabbath, and sometimes a few days' rest be given. The patient's\r\n_comfort_ is the safe guide in this.\r\n\r\n\r\nHives.--_See_ Rash.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoarseness.--This trouble we may consider in _three_ ways:--First, as\r\nthe effect of overstrain in using the voice; in this case rest must be\r\ntaken from speaking or other such work. Remedies which restore the\r\nvoice without rest are very likely to do permanent injury. For\r\napplication to the throat, use vinegar or weak ACETIC ACID (_see_) of\r\nsuch strength as to cause just slight smarting of the throat when\r\napplied as a gargle, or with a proper brush, such as any chemist will\r\nsupply. This may be done frequently, and, together with rest, will\r\nrarely fail to cure. Rubbing the throat externally with acetic acid of\r\nfull strength until a rash appears is often very helpful. Those engaged\r\nin public speaking would do well, especially in youth, to cultivate the\r\nhabit of correct breathing (_see_ Breathing, Correct Method of).\r\nArticulation should be clear, and the words formed sonorously, and from\r\nthe stomach, as it were. This, indeed, will apply to everyone. Such a\r\nmethod of producing the voice will not only be harmonious, but will\r\nexercise insensibly a beneficial influence on the nervous system and\r\nmental tone of the individual.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that actors who study the method of voice production do\r\nnot suffer from that form of sore throat known as clergymen's sore\r\nthroat, simply because they have learned to produce their voice in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSecondly, hoarseness may arise from exposure to cold, damp air. In this\r\ncase it is best to apply mild heat to the _roots_ of the nerves which\r\nsupply the voice organs. This is best done by applying a bran poultice\r\nto the back of the neck, oiling before and after with olive oil.\r\nCarefully dry the skin, and wear a piece of new flannel, for a time,\r\nover the part poulticed. This may be supplemented by brushing as above\r\nwith the vinegar.\r\n\r\nThirdly, failure of skin action, or of the proper action of other\r\nwaste-removing organs, may be the cause of hoarseness. In addition to\r\nthe treatment recommended above, we must in this case stimulate the\r\nskin: this is best done by rubbing with Cayenne \"Tea\" (_see_) all over\r\nthe body at bedtime. Let this be done for four or five nights, and the\r\nthroat treatment be given in the morning, when a cure may be looked\r\nfor. _See_ Underwear.\r\n\r\n\r\nHooping Cough.--_See_ Whooping Cough.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope and Healing.--The mind has always an influence on the body. Life\r\nrises and falls under the influences of ideas, so as to prove that\r\nthese are a matter of life and death to man. To give an invalid _hope_\r\nis, then, to help mightily in healing the disease, whereas to tell\r\npatients that they are incurable is the sure way to make them so. But\r\nthere is, on the other hand, little good in falsehood and false hope:\r\nthis has often been found to fail and leave the patient in complete\r\ndespair. No one can tell the immense power for healing which is exerted\r\nwhen one who truly hopes for the patient looks brightly into his eyes,\r\nand speaks with a genuine ring of hope of the possibility of cure. So\r\nmany cases found incurable by the usual treatment have yielded to that\r\nrecommended in these papers, that in almost all cases we may see some\r\nground for hope, if not of cure, at least of great alleviation. To give\r\nthis impression to a patient is to half win the battle.\r\n\r\nThere are many who speak most carelessly, even wickedly, to those in\r\ntrouble. They think it a duty to dash their hopes and predict gloomy\r\nthings. Such should never enter a sick-room, and should, indeed, change\r\nentirely their manner of speech. To go about the world sowing doubt and\r\ngloom in men's hearts is a sorry occupation, and one that will have to\r\nbe accounted for to Him who is emphatically the \"God of hope.\"\r\n\r\nLook, then, in treatment for every least sign of improvement.\r\nDiscourage all doubts and encourage all hopes, and you will make what\r\nwould be a really hopeless case, if the patient were left to despair,\r\none that can be comparatively easily cured. \"A word to the wise is\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHot Flushings.--_See_ Flushings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHot-water Bags.--The flat rubber bags of various shapes, to be had from\r\nall rubber shops, make excellent substitutes for poultice or\r\nfomentation; but care must be taken to have two or more ply of _moist_\r\nflannel between the bag and the skin of the patient. This ensures a\r\nsupply of moist heat, which is in almost every case the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nHousemaid's Knee.--To cure a swelling on the knee-joint is, as a rule,\r\neasy. _Rest_ is a first and paramount necessity. Bathing with hot\r\nwater, not too hot for comfort, for at least an hour each day is\r\nusually sufficient. If the knee has been blistered, or leeched, it is\r\nmore difficult to cure; but a cure may be expected if the bathing be\r\ncontinued for a long enough time. It is best done by wrapping a cloth\r\ndipped in vinegar round the knee, and placing the foot in a bath, then\r\npouring hot water on the bandaged knee, lifting it from the bath in a\r\njug.\r\n\r\nWhen pain in bending is felt in the very centre of the knee-joint, this\r\nhot pouring may be needed for a month, or even longer. During the\r\nintervals of pouring a large cold compress should be worn, first well\r\noiling the knee. Cover the compress with oiled silk. This will soften\r\neven a very stiff knee, so as at least to bring about ability to bend\r\nwithout pain. Of course, if there is any disjointing, good surgical aid\r\nmust be had, if possible, to replace the bones in their natural\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrocele.--_See_ Dropsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysteria.--This is usually brought on by some excessive strain upon the\r\nbrain nerves, and may show itself either in the violent or in the\r\nfainting form; it may even pass from the one to the other, fainting\r\nalternating with violent movements and cries. It may often be checked\r\nby plunging the patient's hands into _cold_ water.\r\n\r\nIn the silent stage, where sometimes unconsciousness continues for\r\nhours, a dry blanket should be laid on a bed, and another blanket must\r\nbe rolled up and prepared with hot water as directed in Fomentation.\r\nFold this until it is the size and shape of the patient's back, and lay\r\nher down on it, so that the whole back is well fomented. Take care not\r\nto burn the patient: soothing heat, not irritation, is required.\r\nConsciousness will usually return almost immediately. All except\r\nattendants should be excluded from the room. Allow the patient to rest\r\nin this comfortable warmth until signs of discomfort appear, then\r\ngently rub the back with hot olive oil, dry, and leave to rest or sleep\r\nif possible. Do all with great _steadiness of temper and kindness_;\r\nsuch a condition in the nurse is especially essential in these cases.\r\nWhere the fit is violent, apply every mental soothing influence\r\navailable, and remove from the room all excited persons. Then apply\r\ncold cloths to the spine to soothe the irritated nerves and brain. Two\r\nmay gently and kindly hold the patient, while a third presses on the\r\ncooling cloths. In about half-an-hour the fit should be overcome. A\r\ndifficulty in treating such cases is the terrifying effect of the\r\nviolent movements, or unconsciousness; but these should not create\r\nfear. As a rule, a little patience and treatment as above remove all\r\ndistress. Where there is a hysterical tendency, give abundance of good\r\nfood, and let the patient live as much in the open-air as possible.\r\n\r\nThe patient should be kept employed. God made us all to be workers, and\r\nthis sad affliction is frequently the punishment of idleness. No one\r\nhas any excuse for this, for the world is full of those who are\r\noverworked and whose burden could be lightened. The girl whose only\r\ntask is to exchange her armful of novels at the library will never know\r\nwhat true happiness is, nor deserve to. _See_ Imaginary Troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllness, The Root of.--In treating any trouble it is well to get to the\r\nroot of it. On one occasion a patient complained that the doctor never\r\nstruck at the _root_ of his illness. The doctor lifted his\r\nwalking-stick and smashed the brandy bottle which stood on the table,\r\nremarking that his patient would not have to say that again. This will\r\nillustrate what we mean. Liquor drinking must be given up: it is the\r\nroot of multitudinous ills; so must excessive tea drinking. Tobacco is\r\none of the most insidious of poisons in its effects on the nerves, and\r\nis to be absolutely given up if a cure is expected in nervous cases.\r\nChloral, laudanum, and opium in other forms, may give temporary relief;\r\nbut they are deadly poisons, paralysing the nerves and ultimately\r\ncompletely wrecking the system. The continued use of digitalis for\r\nheart disease is a dreadful danger. We mention these by name as most\r\ncommon, to illustrate the truth that it is vain to treat a patient\r\nwhile the _cause_ of his illness is allowed to act. If any evil habit\r\nof indulgence has given rise to trouble, that habit must be given up; a\r\nhard fight may have to be fought, but the victory is sure to those who\r\npersevere. Often dangerous symptoms appear, but these must be faced: to\r\nrelieve them by a return to drugs is to fasten the chains more surely\r\non the patient. It is better to suffer a little than to be all one's\r\nlife a slave.\r\n\r\n\r\nImaginary Troubles.--These are of two kinds, the one purely imaginary,\r\nthe other where bodily trouble is mixed with the imagined. In the first\r\ncase the patient is in agony with a pain, when nothing wrong can be\r\ndiscovered in the part, or even elsewhere, to account for it. In such a\r\ncase, proper treatment of the BRAIN or SPINE (_see_) will often\r\nrelieve. Again, a patient has set up such a standard of health that\r\nwhat would not trouble any ordinary person at all, gives him much\r\ndistress. An intermitting pulse often is a source of great anxiety; but\r\nwe have known people with intermitting pulses continuing in good health\r\nfor forty years, and living to old age. So with many other heart\r\nsymptoms that need give no concern at all. Sprains to some muscles are\r\noften taken for serious internal inflammation, and a slight cough and\r\nspit are taken for consumption. Care must be taken to resist all such\r\nfancies, and if not otherwise removable, _thoroughly competent_ medical\r\nadvice will often put the patient right. In such a case a medical man\r\nof undoubted high standing is best consulted, for an inferior\r\npractitioner may nearly kill the patient by arousing needless fears,\r\nwhich are afterwards difficult to remove. _See_ Hysteria.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that diseases of the imagination are as actually\r\npainful to the patient as if they really were organic troubles. It is,\r\ntherefore, useless to laugh at or pooh pooh the trouble, or suggest\r\nthat the sufferer is only humbugging. Attention must be paid to diet,\r\nexercise, and to material, mental, and moral surroundings, so as in\r\nevery way to relieve the patient from those apparent troubles that so\r\nannoy him. Great gentleness, firmness, hopefulness, and sympathy will\r\noften bring about an almost unconscious cure. If the trouble has been\r\nbrought about by over-work and worry, complete rest will often be\r\nneeded. If there is something in the surroundings that jars, a change\r\nmay be advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndigestion.--(See also Digestion; Assimilation.) This subject leads\r\nnaturally to a consideration of _food_ in relation to it. The trouble\r\nusually is that food easily enough digested by others causes distress\r\nto the patient. Here we at once see that _cooking_ plays a most\r\nimportant part. Potatoes, for example, when steeped for half-an-hour in\r\nhot water, which is changed before they are boiled, are much more easy\r\nof digestion. The water in which they have been steeped is found\r\n_green_ with unripe sap, which is all removed. Where _unripe_ juice is\r\npresent in any root, this method of cookery is a good one. Eggs placed\r\nin boiling water, and allowed to remain so till the water is getting\r\ncool--say _half-an-hour_--are often found to be much more easily\r\ndigested than as usually prepared. What we aim at in these\r\nillustrations is to show that digestion depends on the _relation of the\r\nfood taken to the juices of the stomach which are to dissolve it_. It\r\nmust be brought into a digestible state if weak stomachs are to deal\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nGreasy, heavy dishes must always be avoided. Also unripe fruit. The\r\ndiet should be spare, as very often indigestion proceeds simply from\r\nthe stomach having had too much to do.\r\n\r\nA very easily digested food is fine jelly of oatmeal made in the\r\nfollowing way:--Take a good handful of the meal and put it in a basin\r\nwith hot water, sufficient to make the mixture rather thin. Let it\r\nsteep for half-an-hour. Strain out all the rough particles, and boil\r\nthe milky substance till it is a jelly, with a very little salt. To an\r\nexceedingly weak patient you give only a dessertspoonful, and no more\r\nfor half-an-hour. If the patient is not so weak you may give a\r\ntablespoonful, but nothing more for half-an-hour. In that time the very\r\nsmall amount of gastric juice which the stomach provides has done its\r\nwork with the very small amount of food given. Really good blood,\r\nthough only very little, has been formed. The step you have taken is a\r\nsmall one, but it is real. You proceed in this way throughout the whole\r\nday. The patient should not swallow it at once, but retain it in the\r\nmouth for a considerable time, so that it may mix with the saliva.\r\n\r\nBy this, or by porridge made from wheaten meal, you may secure good\r\ndigestion when the gastric juice is scanty and poor; but we should not\r\nlike to be restricted to that. We want a stomach that will not fight\r\nshy of any wholesome thing. We must treat it so that when suitable food\r\nis offered it may be comfortably digested.\r\n\r\nNow, there is an exceedingly simple means for putting the glands in\r\norder when they are not so. About half-an-hour before taking any food,\r\ntake half a teacupful of water as hot as you can sip it comfortably.\r\nThis has a truly wonderful effect. Before food is taken, the mucous\r\nmembrane is pale and nearly dry, on account of the contracted state of\r\nthe arteries. In many cases the glands that secrete the gastric juice\r\nare feeble; in others they seem cramped, and far from ready to act when\r\nfood is presented. The hot water has the same effect on them as it has\r\neverywhere else on the body--that of stimulating the circulation and\r\nbringing about natural action. It looks a very frail remedy; but when\r\nwe can, as it were, see these glands opening and filling with arterial\r\nblood the instant they are bathed in this same water, and see how ready\r\nthey become to supply gastric juice for digestion, the remedy does not\r\nlook so insignificant.\r\n\r\nWe have, in scores of cases, seen its effects in the most delightful\r\nway. Persons who have to our knowledge been ill and miserable with\r\ntheir stomachs for years have become perfectly well from doing nothing\r\nbut taking half a teacupful of hot water regularly before taking any\r\nfood. It is true that great good is effected in cases of this kind by\r\ngiving the weakened organ light work to do for a time. Wonders are done\r\nby feeding with wheaten-meal biscuits and water for some time,\r\nbeginning with a very small allowance, and seeing that every mouthful\r\nis thoroughly chewed. Great things, too, are accomplished with such\r\nwheaten-meal porridge as we have already mentioned. But we feel\r\ndisposed to regard the half-teacupful of hot water regularly before\r\neating as the chief means of cure. It is wonderfully cheap: it goes\r\nhard with the druggist if his customers need nothing but a little hot\r\nwater. Still, from what we have seen, and from what some of the very\r\nhighest authorities have told us, we come more and more to look to this\r\nsimple remedy as about all that is required inwardly to cure the worst\r\ncases of indigestion.\r\n\r\nA little pepsin added to the hot water may be of use; also in cases of\r\nacidity a few drops of white vinegar mixed with the water will be found\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nSoda, iron, lime, charcoal, even tar pills are used as remedies for\r\nindigestion; but none of them do much good, and some are highly\r\ninjurious. If used at all, their use should be temporary, and under\r\ngood medical advice.\r\n\r\nIf pain is felt, the stomach may be greatly soothed by soft fine lather\r\n(_see_ Lather and Soap). It acts in such cases like a charm. Spread it\r\ngently over the stomach, and wipe it off with a soft cloth. Cover again\r\nwith fresh lather. Do this five or six times, and cover up the last\r\ncoat with a soft cloth.\r\n\r\nAll indulgences which tend to weaken the stomach are to be avoided.\r\nAlcohol and tobacco must be given up. Over-excitement must be avoided,\r\nand abundance of fresh air breathed, if a cure is to be expected.\r\n\r\nWhere sudden and violent pain comes on after meals, a poultice or hot\r\nfomentation applied directly over the stomach is the best remedy at the\r\ntime. _See_ Flatulence.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfant Nursing.--A mother who has had strength to bear a child is, as a\r\nrule, quite strong enough to nurse it. Suckling is natural, and usually\r\nmost beneficial to health. Many women have better health and appetite\r\nat such a time than at any other. Every mother ought, therefore, unless\r\nher health forbids it, to nurse her own child; no other food is so good\r\nfor it as that which nature provides. We cannot too strongly condemn\r\nthe mother who from indolence or love of pleasure shirks this sacred\r\nduty. By so doing she violates the laws of nature, which can never be\r\ndone with impunity. Many troubles follow, and her constitution is\r\nseriously injured. Alas that we should ever have to say, with Jeremiah:\r\n\"Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their\r\nyoung ones; the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the\r\nostriches in the wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nIf a wet-nurse must be employed, great care should be exercised in\r\nchoosing a healthy person with a child as near as possible to the age\r\nof the infant.\r\n\r\nLet mothers remember that there is great _variety_ in milk. Not only\r\ndoes one mother's milk differ from another, but the same mother's milk\r\nvaries from time to time. Variation in health and diet affects the milk\r\nvery much. Many cases of infant trouble are traceable to the mother's\r\nmilk, which should not be overlooked as a possible cause.\r\n\r\nAgain, an _abundance_ of milk is not always good. An infant may thrive\r\nbetter on a scanty supply of good milk than on an abundance of bad\r\nmilk. Milk derived from drinking ale, porter, or alcoholic drinks of\r\nany kind, though abundant, is very far indeed from good, that produced\r\nby plain and simple diet is always best.\r\n\r\nAgain, the _state of the mother's mind_ has a great deal to do with the\r\nquality of her milk. A fright, or continued worry, may transform good\r\nmilk into most injurious food for the child.\r\n\r\nThere need be no fear caused by these ideas: it is only in exceptional\r\ncases that nursing need be given up; the natural way is always the\r\nbest. But where necessary there need be no hesitation in putting an\r\ninfant on the bottle. The milk of a healthy cow, or condensed milk of\r\nfirst-rate brand, is much to be preferred to that of a wearied,\r\nworn-out, and worried mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfants' Food.--For infants who cannot be nursed at the breast, cows'\r\nmilk in the \"bottle\" is the best substitute. But all milk used from the\r\ncow should be sterilised and cooled before use. That is unless it is\r\nfound on trial that the child thrives better on unsterilised milk. It\r\nis not necessary to have \"one cow's milk;\" but it is important to have\r\nthe milk adapted in strength to the infant's need. If the milk be too\r\nrich, the infant will often break out into spots, or will vomit. A\r\nlittle more boiling water in the bottle mixture will remedy this, and\r\noften prevent serious trouble. The same proportion of water and milk\r\nwill not always do. One dairy's milk, and even one cow's milk, differs\r\nfrom another; and so does the digestive power of infants. We have to\r\nfind out that strength of milk to suit our own baby, and not be led\r\nastray by the advice of other mothers. In health the young infant does\r\nnot require food oftener than every two hours, sometimes even every\r\nthree. It may cry because of cold, wet, or discomfort, not from want of\r\nfood. To overload the stomach with food is harmful and leads to serious\r\ndisorders. Its food requires a certain time for digestion, even in an\r\ninfant, and as the child grows, the intervals between meals ought to be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nA good mixture is two parts of cow's milk to one of water. To every\r\npint of this add four teaspoonfuls of sugar, and a tablespoonful of\r\ncream. Barley water may be used instead of common water. The water\r\nshould be boiling, and should be poured into the milk. The bottle\r\nshould be thoroughly cleansed, and boiled in boiling water before\r\nre-filling. It must be remembered that the saliva does not possess the\r\nproperty of turning starch into sugar till the child is six months old;\r\ntherefore starchy food, such as bread, arrowroot, etc., should on no\r\naccount be given before that age. Preparations for weaning may then\r\nbegin, by giving the child _small_ quantities of oatmeal jelly and\r\nmilk, or even of porridge and milk, so that the weaning comes on\r\ngradually. The time of nursing should not exceed nine months. If,\r\nhowever, a child afterwards be ill, there is no harm in going back for\r\na time to the bottle, even at two years old. Common sense must guide,\r\nand not hard-and-fast rule. Easily assimilated food must ever be\r\nchosen; and as a food for children, oatmeal porridge, well boiled,\r\nholds the first place--far before bread sops. If porridge be not easily\r\ndigested, try oatmeal jelly. Most of the infant foods so largely\r\nadvertised cannot be recommended.\r\n\r\n                *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\nIt is now suspected that tuberculosis is transmitted to children mainly\r\nfrom the milk of cows affected with this disease. Cows are exceedingly\r\nliable to tuberculous disease of the udder. It is therefore very\r\ndifficult to get milk guaranteed free from the tubercle bacillus, and\r\nrecent examinations of that coming into Manchester and Liverpool showed\r\nthat from 18 to 29 per cent. contained this deadly germ. (Strange to\r\nsay, tubercular disease of the mother's breast is practically unknown,\r\nand children never derive the disease from their mother's milk.) It is\r\ntherefore of the greatest importance that only the milk of cows proved\r\nfree from this disease should be used. The disease is easily detected,\r\nand if a demand were created for milk guaranteed free from the germs,\r\ndairymen would soon supply it.\r\n\r\nUnless it is _absolutely certain_ the cows supplying the milk are free\r\nfrom disease, the milk should be sterilised by heating to near boiling\r\npoint, and then cooling _rapidly_. If kept twelve hours, the boiled\r\ntaste goes off it, and children soon get to like it. Though sterilised\r\nmilk will keep for some time without getting sour, it should be\r\nsterilised each day, specially if for infant use.\r\n\r\nThis treatment makes the milk keep without the use of preservatives,\r\nsuch as boric acid. We regret to say the use of these is not illegal,\r\nand they are largely used in preserving milk, butter, hams, etc. We\r\nhave seen very serious illnesses produced in children (and adults too)\r\nby the heavy doses they have got when both the farmer and milk vendor\r\nhave added these preservatives. This they often do at the season when\r\nthe milk easily turns sour. Every care should therefore be taken to get\r\nmilk guaranteed free from these noxious drugs; and if this is\r\nimpossible, condensed milk should be used instead. As there is a great\r\nvariety of brands of condensed milk in the market, always choose one\r\nwhich guarantees that the milk taken has been whole milk, and also\r\nunsweetened.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfants' Sleep.--_See_ Children's Sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfection.--Few things have so great and distressing effect as the fear\r\nof infection in disease. As a rule this fear is not justified by the\r\nfacts, where ordinary precautions are taken. These precautions, too,\r\nneed not be costly, and involve in many cases little more than some\r\ncareful work. Where scarlet fever has shown itself in any household,\r\nthe very first thing is to see to the continuous freshening of the air\r\nin the sick-room and in all the house. Ventilation is, indeed, the\r\nfirst and most important method of disinfection. Chloride of lime and\r\nother disinfecting fluids will decompose the offensive and noxious\r\nodours, but pure air will sweep the organisms of disease themselves\r\naway. Fresh air kills the microbes of certain diseases, _e.g._,\r\nconsumption, and is hostile to all disease. The stools of typhoid\r\npatients should be disinfected, and great care taken that no water or\r\nother fluid is contaminated by them through imperfect sanitation, etc.\r\n(_see_ Fever, Typhoid). Seeing that the seeds of disease are all around\r\nus, the best method of warding off their attacks is to keep the body in\r\na state to resist their inroads by strict attention to diet, exercise\r\nand ventilation. Let all be done also, by fires if necessary, to\r\nthoroughly _dry_ the room and house. See that all the family breathe\r\nfresh air by night as well as by day; have open windows where and when\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAcetic acid is as powerful a disinfectant as carbolic acid, in\r\nproportion to its strength, and has the advantage of being harmless,\r\nunless in the glacial form.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of infectious disease these precautions are almost certain\r\nto prevent its spread, with, in addition, the special ones given under\r\nthe head of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation, Deep-seated.--Often inflammation occurs in the centre of,\r\nor beneath, a mass of muscle, as the hip or thigh. We refer not to the\r\nformation of an ABSCESS (_see_), but to the violent, hot inflammatory\r\naction that often _issues_ in an abscess. For this the treatment should\r\nbe strong moist heat applied to the back, where the _nerve roots_ of\r\nthe inflamed part lie, and _persistent_ cooling of the part which is\r\npainful. The heat may be by bran poultice, fomentation, or hot-water\r\nbag and moist flannel. The cold must not be ice, but only cold water\r\ncloths frequently renewed.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see how people are frightened at the only thing that\r\ngives relief, and not at all at that which does the most damage. A\r\ngentleman wrote us once that he had had eighteen blisters on, but was\r\nafraid to apply a cold cloth. We wrote him that if he still lived after\r\neighteen fly blisters, he would surely not die under a cold cloth. They\r\nwill say they have tried so many things. We reply, that if they had\r\ntried a million wrong things, and shrunk from the right one, they would\r\nbe only so much the worse.\r\n\r\nIf there is local swelling, and signs that an abscess is forming, then\r\ntreat as recommended for Abscess.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Bowels.--_See_ Bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammation of the Brain.--_See_ Brain. _See also_ Knee; Limbs,\r\nInflamed; Lungs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nInflammatory Outbreaks.--Sometimes a severe out-break and eruption will\r\noccur in and around the nostrils or lips, and spread over the face. (If\r\nof the nature of erysipelas, treat as under that head.) In ordinary\r\ncases, there is need for more than local treatment, as it is probable\r\nthat more or less failure in the skin exists. Also the feet will be\r\nmost probably cold and damp. Let these be bathed (_see_ Bathing Feet),\r\nand dried. Then rub them with CAYENNE LOTION (_see_) for some ten\r\nminutes, until in a glow of heat. Dry well, rub on hot olive oil, and\r\ndry again. Do this twice a day for a week. Warm and dry stockings must\r\nbe worn. The skin of the back will probably be found dry and rough.\r\nWash it down daily with SOAP (_see_) and hot water, and rub with warm\r\nolive oil. After a week of this treatment, probably the eruption will\r\nbe much lessened. If it is still troublesome, apply cool cloths to the\r\nwhole head, avoiding the sore parts, until it is generally cooled down\r\nand the skin softened, or the head may be, instead of this, packed in\r\nlather of the soap already mentioned. (_See_ Head, Soaping). For the\r\nsore itself, apply weak vinegar or _very weak_ ACETIC ACID (_see_), and\r\na little olive oil after. But it is best if it can be healed in such\r\ncases without any local application, through the general treatment of\r\nfeet and skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Relaxation.--Pain is often felt in parts of the back or sides\r\nwhich will yield to no medicine such as usually relieves. This most\r\nprobably arises from relaxation and swelling of some internal part of\r\nthe body, so that there is more or less constant pressure on some\r\nnerves. It will be worse after fatigue or long standing, or any mental\r\nworry and excitement. This shows us that one thing necessary to cure is\r\n_rest_: entire rest if possible, if not, as much as can be taken. It is\r\nwell to find out the _easiest_ posture in which to lie, and spend as\r\nmuch time as possible in that posture. Seek, also, by applying cold\r\ncloths to the painful parts, to reduce the swollen tissue. There may\r\nalso be required fomenting of the feet and legs (_see_ Angina Pectoris)\r\nto prevent chill during this cooling. Often pain in the urinary organs\r\nis due to nothing but this relaxation, and yields to such treatment.\r\nRest, however, is a primary necessity in all such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nItch.--_See_ Rash.\r\n\r\n\r\nJaundice.--This disease, or its approach, may be known by several\r\nsigns: a more or less yellow colour of the skin where otherwise white;\r\na yellowness of the whites of the eyes, and failure of the bowels to\r\nact sufficiently, with lack of appetite. It may come on gradually, or\r\nmay be induced suddenly by some disgusting mouthful or sight which\r\naffects the nervous system, and through this the liver and stomach.\r\nWhere a disgust, or, as the Scotch call it, a \"scunner,\" is taken at\r\nany food, especially with children, they should never be forced to eat\r\nit. Jaundice may follow if they are so forced. Those having the care of\r\nchildren should always remember this.\r\n\r\nThe cure is found first in nursing the sympathetic nerves, by a\r\nfomentation for an hour of the whole length of the middle of the back,\r\noiling before and after with olive oil. Four hours later treat the\r\nstomach and bowels in the same way. In another four hours foment the\r\nfeet and legs similarly. All this time give a tablespoonful of hot\r\nwater every ten minutes. Then rest for twelve hours, and repeat the\r\ncycle of treatment. During the twelve hours' rest, the hot water may be\r\ntaken in sips, as desired by the patient. If there is pain in the\r\nregion of the liver, foment that region more strongly. If severe, place\r\na bran poultice on above the liver, and keep it on all day, or even for\r\ntwenty-four hours if the patient is comfortable in it. By the second\r\nday there should be a marked improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nKidney Complaints.--_See_ Urinary Troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnee, Swelling of, or Pain in.--For ordinary slight injuries, complete\r\nrest, and rubbing with spirit lotion, should be sufficient. But where\r\nthere is previous weakness, or constitutional tendency, even slight\r\npain and stiffness, caused by wet or some blow or wrench, the joint\r\nmust be treated thoroughly. Careless and wrong treatment may be given,\r\nand result in severe lameness. We wish, however, to point out that the\r\ntreatment here recommended has cured many cases where this lameness\r\nappeared hopeless, and even restored walking power in limbs which had\r\nbeen ordered to be amputated by surgeons.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the trouble, it should be easy to cure in five\r\nor six days. First apply the SOAPY BLANKET (_see_) at bedtime. Then,\r\nabout eleven o'clock in the fore-noon, place the leg so that the knee\r\nis over a small tub or bath full of very hot water, as hot as can be\r\nborne without pain. Pour this over the knee with a sponge or large soft\r\ncloth for an hour, adding hot water as it cools. If the patient becomes\r\nsick or faint, discontinue the bathing for a time. Dry the limb, rub\r\nwith olive oil, and dry again gently. At five in the afternoon repeat\r\nthe treatment of the knee. At bedtime sponge all over with hot vinegar,\r\nrub with hot olive oil, and put to bed. If the joint has been\r\nstiffened, gentle efforts to move it may be made during the treatment.\r\n\r\nSometimes during this treatment boils will break out over the knee and\r\ndischarge a good deal, but as soon as their work in removing disease is\r\ndone, these will heal up. Generally, however, this will not occur. The\r\ndiet may be such as we recommend in cases of ABSCESS (_see_).\r\n\r\nIn bad cases, the treatment may be continued for weeks before much\r\nfavourable change is noted. Patience and perseverance, however, will\r\nwin the day. The soapy blanket should not be given oftener than three\r\ntimes a week, and a rest from all treatment on the Sabbath is best.\r\n_See also_ Housemaid's Knee.\r\n\r\nOften in cases of knee pain and trouble, when local applications have\r\nlittle power, a BRAN POULTICE (_see_) on the lower back will effect a\r\nspeedy cure. Sensible people will, of course, study and apply fresh\r\ntreatment in such cases. Where the knee, for instance, is in the _hot_\r\nstage of inflammation, hot applications will be injurious. In such a\r\ncase, cold cloths on the knee, with bran poultice on the lower back,\r\nwill be the proper treatment. Try heat first, and if it is hurtful,\r\nvary the treatment to cold and heat, continued as above.\r\n\r\nHere, again, is a knee which gives its owner excruciating pain, and\r\nshows only a little swelling and no sign of diseased matter whatever.\r\nThe hot fomentation and cold towels have both been tried, but there are\r\nnow and again symptoms that show us that the root of the evil has not\r\nbeen reached. We try cold cloths on this knee, but they greatly\r\nincrease the pain. We at length suspect that it is not the knee that is\r\nseriously diseased, but the root of one or more of the nerves that\r\nsupply the link from the lower part of the spine. By this time the pain\r\nhas returned into the knee dreadfully, and everything has failed. But\r\nvery soon after a large, thick towel, folded and wrung out of cold\r\nwater, having plenty of mustard spread on it, is placed across the\r\nhaunches, relief is given in the most charming fashion. The cold cloth\r\nabsorbs superfluous heat, and superfluous vital action to a certain\r\nextent, but the mustard draws it out so much more speedily and\r\npowerfully that the deep-seated roots of the nerves are reached and\r\ncooled down to their normal action. The pain ceases, and the poor\r\nsufferer blesses the mustard. We are just describing what actually\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nSometimes a prejudice arises against heat. If, for example, an inflamed\r\nknee has been strongly heated during the hot stage of the trouble, the\r\npains and injury will have been greatly increased. But one way or other\r\nthat hot stage of the trouble has been got over, and now without heat\r\nit is impossible to cure. The patient, however, and probably the nurse\r\nwaiting upon him, are decided against all hot appliances. These do so\r\nmuch mischief that it is believed to be out of the question to try them\r\nagain. It may be that the prejudice is so strong that you simply can do\r\nnothing; it may not be quite so invincible as that. If you are able to\r\npoint out that it was only because the heat was applied at a wrong\r\ntime, or in far too great strength, and that now, since the\r\ninflammatory power is spent, heat will be sure to have a good effect,\r\nif it is only carefully applied, the prejudice may be removed. We have\r\nseen a patient in this stage, and with both knees bad, wrapped in a\r\nlarge hot blanket fomentation from the ankles to above the knees; and\r\nhe was constrained to exclaim, \"That's the right thing, beyond all\r\ndoubt.\" Then there is no more prejudice.\r\n\r\nSufferers should not be disappointed if for a week or two they are not\r\nsensibly better. In some cases the effect is apparent in four or five\r\ndays, but generally a fortnight or three weeks pass without much\r\nencouragement. We see great despondency sometimes just before all pain\r\ndisappears. Still, as a rule, the new health is seen in the cheek and\r\neye very soon. Where a _violent_ inflammation is obviously proceeding\r\nin the knee, the TURNIP POULTICE (_see_) is the best remedy. If there\r\nbe great heat in all the body, there will be little or no need for\r\nheating any part; judgment must be used for each individual case in\r\nthese matters. While resting as much as possible, the patient will find\r\nit best to lie on the back, with the sore knee supported a little\r\nhigher than the body. A gently applied bandaging of the whole limb is\r\nalso very beneficial, and may be used for all weak limbs, even when the\r\npatient is walking about.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of stiffened knees, even where accidental bending of\r\nthe joint gives very great pain, it is a grave mistake to put the knee\r\nin splints to prevent bending. What is wanted is to encourage bending\r\nas far as that can be done without much pain, so that the joint may not\r\npermanently stiffen. Even where, by the use of splints, permanent\r\nstiffness seems to have been brought on, the warm-water treatment\r\nrecommended above will bring about a loosening and softening of the\r\njoint, which will permit first of a slight bending, and then, with\r\ngentle encouragement, a complete flexibility. The _complete_\r\nrestoration of the limb should be the object kept in view. No case of a\r\nstiffened joint, although it may be free from pain and disease, can be\r\nregarded as satisfactory, and hence treatment should be persevered in\r\nuntil all stiffness is gone. Common sense will direct as to hot and\r\ncold applications, when to apply each, and how long to continue either;\r\nthe patient's comfortable feeling being the very best guide. We are\r\nglad to know of very many apparently hopeless limbs saved by our\r\ntreatment, even where it has been imperfectly carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLacing, Tight.--This produces such serious deformity, and in many ways\r\nso interferes with the health of women, that we are constrained to\r\nwrite upon the subject. We find in cases which come before us that\r\nlacing, both of the feet and the waist, as practised by our women, has\r\ncaused disease, and prevents our curing it. To begin with the lacing of\r\nboots. There is a certain form and size of foot which are supposed to\r\nbe graceful. To obtain this, boots unsuitable in shape, and far too\r\nsmall in size, are used, and tightly laced down upon the foot and\r\nankle, preventing circulation of the blood in these important parts.\r\nThis causes corns and misshapen toes and nails; but its bad effects are\r\nalso felt throughout all the body. We have pointed out in other\r\narticles the great curative power of bathing or fomenting the feet. The\r\ntight lacing of boots produces exactly the opposite effect. It is as\r\npowerful to injure as the other to cure. Cold feet are the cause of\r\nmany most serious troubles. To keep tight-booted feet warm is almost\r\nimpossible. True neatness abhors all such mistaken treatment of the\r\nfeet. Moreover, no supposed good shape, in body or feet, can ever\r\nproduce the impression of beauty which good health never fails to give,\r\nso that the tightly-booted high-heeled girl or woman defeats her own\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nA yet more serious evil is the wearing of corsets. From this comes very\r\nmuch of the ill-health from which women suffer. The stomach, liver, and\r\nother organs are forced downward, their proper blood supply is cut off,\r\nand indigestion, constipation, headache and backache are the inevitable\r\nconsequence. The pressure of these organs causes falling of the womb\r\nand the terrible troubles which employ two-thirds of the fashionable\r\nsurgeons. These have not failed to denounce the folly which brings so\r\nmany patients to them.\r\n\r\nDr. Herbert Snow, the great authority on cancer, and physician to the\r\nLondon Cancer Hospital, attributes almost wholly to the use of corsets\r\nthe fact that for one man who dies of cancer two women die of it. The\r\ncompression of the womb makes it specially liable to be attacked, while\r\nthe rubbing of the hard edge of the corset on the breast sets up cancer\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBesides its evil effects on the abdominal organs, the lungs also\r\nsuffer, the ribs are prevented from expanding and so the wearer can\r\nnever breathe as deeply as is necessary. The muscles of the abdomen and\r\ntrunk are greatly weakened; indeed to this is due the fact that a woman\r\nwho is accustomed to corsets has great difficulty in giving them up.\r\nShe feels as if she would \"come to pieces\" if not supported by them.\r\n\r\nThe exercises given in the appendix will help to restore tone to these\r\nmuscles, and with perseverance in these, vigor and health will return,\r\nand the deformities such as flat or hollow chest, drooping shoulders,\r\nand protuberant abdomen, caused by muscular weakness, will disappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Normal Waist.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Corset formed Waist.]\r\n\r\nAs we have said (_see_ Skin, Care of) clothing should be loose and\r\nporous in order that the skin may perform its functions. Corsets are\r\nboth tight and impervious. The constriction of any part of the body by\r\ntight bands, and the hanging of the clothes from the hips, are highly\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently urged that corsets are necessary if a woman is to have\r\nwell-fitting clothes and a neat figure, but this is by no means the\r\ncase. We illustrate a \"good health waist\" which has the advantage of\r\nallowing freedom of movement and respiration, producing no constriction\r\nof any part, and yet being well-fitting. Buttons are arranged, as shown\r\nin the illustration, to support the skirts so that their weight falls\r\nequally from the shoulders. This waist can be had from the Good Health\r\nSupply Department, 451 Holloway Road, London, N., who will send\r\nparticulars on receipt of a post card.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Good Health Waist (_back view_)\r\n               Good Health Waist (_front view_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLancing Swellings.--See Abscess.\r\n\r\n\r\nLather, How to make.--One of the most powerful soothing influences\r\nwhich can be had, is found in the lather of M'Clinton's soap, so often\r\nrecommended in these pages. Applied to the skin over a stomach which\r\nhas been rejecting all food, and even retching on emptiness, for hours,\r\nit will almost at once stop the irritation. Applied to the head it is\r\ninvaluable (_see_ Brain; Head; Hearing, etc.), and in many cases we\r\nhave known it perform almost miracles of soothing effect. But the\r\nlather must be rightly made, and none but this soap used, if good\r\nresults are to be got. Lather is first _Soap_, secondly _Water_, and\r\nthirdly _Air_, so wrought together to make a mass like whipped cream,\r\nor only a little more fluid. To get this, dip a _good_ shaving brush in\r\nhot water, rub it on the soap a little, take another slight dip of hot\r\nwater, and work the brush in the hollow of the left hand patiently,\r\nuntil you have a handful of fine creamy foam, sufficiently solid not to\r\nrun like water, and yet as soft in its consistency as cream. There is\r\nin the hand just the temperature, consistency, and shape that are\r\nrequired for working the lather, and no dish can properly replace it.\r\nThe lather is to be gathered from the hand with the brush (a soft\r\nbadger's-hair one preferred), and laid with it on the skin of the\r\npatient wherever necessary. Then another handful is quickly made, and\r\nso on until the required surface is covered. Or the lather may be\r\ntransferred to a hot dish, placed over a bowl of boiling water, till\r\nenough is ready. After the application, a soft handkerchief may be laid\r\nloosely on, and, if the lather is to remain on as a pack, a dry\r\ncovering put over this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lather ready for application.]\r\n\r\nIn many cases where it is inconvenient to apply the lather direct to\r\nthe skin, it may be spread on a warm cloth of soft and clean linen or\r\ncotton, and this laid over the part to be treated before it is cold.\r\nThis will also apply where the patient is too weak to sit or lie in the\r\nposition required for lathering the skin. A dry cloth must be put on\r\nthe top of the soapy one, and all fastened on by proper wrapping. In\r\ncases, however, where the skin has to be lathered in order to soothe\r\nthe nervous system or to allay irritation of internal organs, it is\r\nwell, if at all possible, to apply the lather direct to the skin, as\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\nLather of this soap, made in this way, may be spread on the most\r\nsensitive sores (when ulcers have eaten through both outer and inner\r\nskins) with only a very slight feeling of smarting to the patient, and\r\nwith the most healing effect. It is very different with soda soap made\r\nin the usual way. When the skin of the head has got inflamed (as we saw\r\nin the case of a child the other day, where the back of the head was a\r\nmatted mass of most distressing sores), it is charming to see the\r\neffect of this lather. We took a number of handfuls of it, and soaked\r\nthe matted hair and inflamed skin till the poor child looked up with an\r\nexpression of astonished relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegs, Pricking Pains in.--Sometimes curious pricking pains are felt in\r\nthe legs, becoming so severe as even to confine a patient to bed.\r\nNothing can be seen on the skin, and no swelling or other visible sign\r\nof trouble is present. Evidently this requires treatment more\r\nparticularly of the nerves, which go to maintain a proper balanced\r\nstate of feeling in the skin where the pricking is felt. The patient\r\nmust give up using alcohol in any form, and should rest in bed. In\r\ntreatment we do not look to the skin itself, but rather to the nerves,\r\nto effect a cure. There is a failure at the nerve roots, and indeed the\r\npatient will usually be weak and nervous generally. A popular remedy in\r\nsuch a case might be arsenic, which must be avoided, as likely greatly\r\nto injure instead of help. The cure is in increased nutrition of the\r\nnerve substances, by rest and light dietary. _See_ Biscuits and Water,\r\nDiet.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimb, Saving a.--The proper growth of the body in any part depends on\r\nthe power furnished by the nervous system and the cells of that part.\r\nThis power enables these cells to use the nutritive substance in the\r\nblood for the formation of new tissue. By this process, growth in the\r\nhealthy body is continuous through life, replacing equally continuous\r\nwaste. But this all depends on a due balance of power in the process.\r\nSuppose one eats more than can be changed into healthy tissue, the food\r\nmay all go into blood, but the nervous power of the cells is\r\ninsufficient to deal with it. Sluggish living in bad air, tobacco, or\r\nalcoholic drinks, will all cause this. Then some slight wound or bruise\r\nis received, and the overloaded blood fails to act healthfully and heal\r\nthis. A sore is formed, most likely somewhere in the foot or leg, and\r\nthe limb goes from bad to worse in spite of all efforts, while this\r\n_inequality_ between the blood and the tissues continues. This goes on\r\nperhaps for years, and no effort is made to remedy it. Such a case may\r\noften be very easily cured, even where doctors pronounce it hopeless,\r\nif the patient will submit to proper regimen and treatment. Let the\r\nlimb be thoroughly bathed, as far above the knee as possible, with\r\nwater as hot as can be borne (_see_ Bathing Feet). Pour into the water\r\nabout half-a-pint of strong vinegar. Keep up the heat for an hour.\r\nRepeat three times each day--at 11 a.m., 4 p.m., and at bedtime. Rest\r\nfrom treatment on the Sabbath. When perspiration follows this bath, dry\r\nthe patient all over, and rub with vinegar. Dry this off and rub with\r\nolive oil. Dry again, and put on clothes.\r\n\r\nWhen we have to foment a foot or knee in long heatings or bathings, we\r\nfind it well sometimes to cool the lower part of the spinal nerves, and\r\nremove all irritation of them.\r\n\r\nThen for _diet_, let the patient go on good wholesome wheaten biscuits\r\n(_see_ Biscuits and Water) three times a day as food, and pure water,\r\nwith no alcohol of any kind, to drink. And let him give up the use of\r\ntobacco entirely. Many times over, when limbs have been condemned by\r\nthe medical men, we have seen them saved in this way. We have seen the\r\nsame treatment save arms and fingers, reducing them from swollen and\r\nunsightly sores to perfect shape and complete usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimbs, Disjointed, or Sprained.--In the case of an overstretch, or\r\nsprain, which has resulted in a hardened, swollen, and painful state of\r\nthe muscles of the arm, bathe the arm in hot water, using plenty of\r\nSOAP (_see_). While the arm lies in this bath, gently squeeze it with\r\nboth hands, so as to make the muscles work gently over one another, and\r\nthe blood run out and in to the stiff parts. Care must be taken to\r\navoid hurting the patient. No such effort is needed as to require great\r\nstrength--only so much squeezing as urges the blood out of the part\r\nsqueezed, and lets it in again when the pressure is taken off.\r\nPersevere in this for half-an-hour, dry, and rub with warm olive oil.\r\nDo this twice daily until the arm is restored.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a broken or disjointed arm, FOMENTATION (_see_) should\r\nbe vigorously applied until proper surgical aid can be had to set the\r\nbones. Even where a joint has been a long time out, such fomentation\r\npersevered in will soften the part, and permit of proper setting of the\r\nbones. Cold is unfavourable--cold water a decided mistake in such a\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nOf course a surgeon should be employed; but if no medical aid can be\r\nobtained, a person who understands anatomy may replace a disjointed\r\nlimb by fomenting and oiling the muscles thoroughly, and then watching\r\nfor a time when they are relaxed, and when the patient's attention is\r\nnot fixed on the joint. This is the moment to slip the bone into its\r\nplace. If medical aid can be obtained, it is always safe, while waiting\r\nfor the doctor, to foment the broken or disjointed limb. Also a wet\r\ncompress worn over the disjointed limb will, with the fomentation, make\r\nit much easier for him, when he comes, properly to set the bones.\r\n\r\nWhen two bones in any part of the body are disjointed, the cords and\r\nmuscles which tend to keep them firm in their ordinary position usually\r\ndraw the ends past each other so that they overlap. To get the joint\r\nright, the bones must be drawn until the ends can pass each other, and\r\nthen they must be brought into their proper position. Compare the\r\ndisjointed bones with those same bones in a right position in some\r\none's body, and thus you will see how they may be drawn right. There is\r\na way of manipulating the muscles and tendons that in most cases\r\nrenders it unnecessary to use much force, therefore the inexperienced\r\nshould never draw forcibly. Sometimes a joint will repeatedly fail in\r\nthis way. In such a case it may be supported; but means must be used by\r\nhot fomentations to strengthen the joint, and general rubbing,\r\nespecially on the spine, must be used to increase vital force.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimbs, Drawn-up.--We have had many cases of contracted limbs, arising\r\nfrom various causes. Some of these have been completely cured, even\r\nwhen the tendons or _cords_ which were contracted were going to be\r\n_cut_ by medical advice. In one case, however, of which we knew, the\r\nmedical man ordered the very treatment we employ.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we must have EXERCISE (_see_). This may be given by\r\nmassaging the back and limbs with a gentle squeezing motion for\r\nhalf-an-hour twice a day (_see_ MASSAGE). Use hot olive oil for this\r\nrubbing, and _persevere_. If the feet be sweaty, rub them with the\r\nCAYENNE LOTION (_see_). But the effective cure will be found in the\r\ncareful and persevering rubbing and pressure.\r\n\r\nSometimes we find that a failure occurs in the large haunch joint\r\nitself, and that is not only shown by pain and stiffness, but by one or\r\nmore sores that discharge matter, indicating that the bone is diseased.\r\nAt the same time, the sinews of the limb affected give signs of\r\ncontraction, and the heel soon refuses to come to the ground in\r\nwalking. There is clearly a lack of vital energy, such as is wanted to\r\nheal the bone and nourish the leaders in this limb: this lack may have\r\nbeen showing itself for years. Apply the ARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_).\r\nSoon the sores begin to put on a healthier appearance, and ere long\r\nthey heal up. With this and the rubbing, the sinews begin to relax and\r\nlengthen out, so that the heel comes nearer the ground. The limb may\r\neven have become smaller than the other, but it grows so as to come up\r\nwith the healthy one: this will be the case though the fomentation is\r\ndone equally to both. It is a curious thing that the body is so\r\nconstituted that general healthy growth tends to bring on weaker parts\r\nmore rapidly than stronger ones, so as to restore proper proportions.\r\nThe new force applied to the roots of nerves on both sides of the spine\r\ndoes not make the healthy limb grow so as to keep in advance of the\r\nweakened one; it makes the weakened one grow so as to come up with the\r\nhealthier. You do not therefore need to confine the fomenting to one\r\nside; it is better to apply it equally to both sides, and to leave the\r\nlaws of the constitution to arrange all matters as to proportion. These\r\nlaws never fail to do so perfectly. In the hands of a really skilful\r\nsurgeon, much may be done to remedy diseased bone by the modern methods\r\nof antiseptic treatment and operation, but where these are not\r\navailable, the above treatment has most excellent effects, and has\r\nsometimes cured where the surgeon has failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimbs, Fractured.--It is not always easy to say definitely whether a\r\nbone is broken or not. In general, however, the following are signs of\r\nfracture:--(1) Loss of power in the limb; (2) Swelling or pain at the\r\ninjured spot; (3) Distortion of the limb, usually shorter than natural;\r\ngentle pulling makes it temporarily regain its natural position; (4)\r\nWhen the limb is gently moved, it moves at some spot between the\r\njoints, and a grating sound is heard; (5) In case of a bone which lies\r\nnear the skin, a touch will perceive the irregularity due to the\r\nfracture.\r\n\r\nPending the surgeon's arrival, if there is a fracture, do not attempt\r\nto move the patient till the limb is so secured that the broken bone is\r\nprevented from moving. If the arm bone is broken, put one splint inside\r\nand another outside the arm, and tie two bandages, one on each side of\r\nthe fracture. Sling the arm in a small arm-sling like the straw\r\nenvelope of a bottle.\r\n\r\nIf the thigh be fractured, get a long splint, such as a broom handle or\r\na rifle, placing it from the pit of the arm to the foot. Bandage around\r\nthe chest, the hip bones, legs, and feet, and then by two bandages, one\r\nabove and the other below the fracture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Broken Thigh.]\r\n\r\nIf the leg bone or bones be broken, an umbrella makes a good splint.\r\nAnother splint should be applied on the inside of the leg, the two\r\nfirmly bandaged together, and finally the legs tied together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Broken Leg.]\r\n\r\nIf the knee-cap only be fractured, tie the leg on a splint from hip to\r\nfoot, and keep the limb raised.\r\n\r\nAlmost any firm substance which can keep the limb at rest can be used\r\nfor a splint, but if hard it should be padded. If the fracture is\r\naccompanied with severe bleeding, stop the flow first before attending\r\nto the fracture. (_See_ Wounds.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLimbs, Inflamed.--Entirely different treatment from the above is needed\r\nfor such a thing as inflammation of the elbow, wrist, shoulder-joint or\r\nknee.\r\n\r\nSay it is an inflamed elbow that is to be treated. We describe this;\r\nbut similar treatment, with very slight variation, such as common sense\r\nwill suggest, answers for the other joints.\r\n\r\nHave two large plain towels wrung out of cold water, and folded so as\r\nto wrap six ply thick round the elbow. See that the patient is\r\notherwise warm. Place one of the towels round the joint, and gently\r\npress it (avoiding pain) so as to draw the heat out of every part. When\r\nthis is hot substitute the other, and continue with fresh cooling--for\r\nan hour if necessary. The cloth may require to be changed perhaps\r\nthirty times; but the guide to this is furnished by its heating. When\r\nhot, change it. This may be repeated frequently, until the inflammation\r\nis subdued.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimbs, Uncontrollable.--This trouble is found in the double form;\r\nfirst, of limbs which will not move when their owner desires to move\r\nthem; and, second, limbs moving in excessive jerks when they are not\r\ndesired to do so. These cases are often combined, the limbs being rigid\r\nat one time and jerking violently at another. There is no wasting or\r\nunhealthy appearance. We have found this condition caused by excessive\r\nwalking, running, and standing, combined with exposure to frequent\r\nwettings. The result is, in essence, that _motor_ power in the limbs is\r\nin excess, while _controlling_ power is defective: the case is indeed\r\nsimilar to St. Vitus' Dance (_see_). Bathe the feet (_see_ Bathing\r\nFeet) in hot water, and apply cold towels folded and wrung out of cold\r\nwater (but not iced) along the spine. Keep this up for an\r\nhour-and-a-half at a time. By that time the hard rigid feeling in the\r\nlimbs will probably have disappeared, but great helplessness will be\r\nfelt. You have removed the excess of motor energy, and must now\r\nincrease the voluntary energy. This will be accomplished by gently\r\nrubbing the back and limbs with hot olive oil, as in Limbs, Drawn-up.\r\nThis treatment, repeated daily, will usually soon cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiquorice.--_See_ Constipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiver, The.--Where biliousness prevails, without any symptom of real\r\nliver disease, it is well first to look to the state of the stomach and\r\nbowels. Take a teacupful of hot water twenty minutes before meals, and\r\nthe liquorice mixture (_see_ Constipation) after meals. Then give a\r\nstrong blanket fomentation to the feet and legs for an hour in the\r\nevening. If there be pain or feverish heat in the region of the bowels,\r\npress cold cloths over the painful part while the feet are fomented.\r\n\r\nWhen the liver is really swollen, hardened, or painful, the pulse will\r\neither be quick with feverish symptoms or slow with coldness. If it be\r\na feverish case, press cold cloths over the liver, changing them when\r\nwarm, for an hour: at the same time foment the feet and legs as\r\ndirected above. See that there is heat enough to make the patient\r\ncomfortable under the cold applications. Inflammation of the liver will\r\nreadily yield to this treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen the case is a _cold_ one with slow pulse, use no cold cloths, but\r\napply fomentations over the liver, as well as to the feet and legs.\r\nSmoking and alcoholic drinks must be entirely given up--these habits\r\nare peculiarly severe on the liver. The treatment will not be likely to\r\ncure in a day or in a week, but patient perseverance with the\r\nfomentations should eventually effect a cure. Too rich food throws a\r\ngreat strain on the liver, and a plain and spare diet with prolonged\r\nmastication is necessary with above treatment if a cure is to be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocomotor Ataxia.--This disease is a most difficult one to deal with,\r\nand any healing is very slow work. Patients past middle life are\r\nspecially difficult cases, but we have known cure, or at least great\r\nmitigation in younger persons by the following treatment. Beginning,\r\nsay on a Tuesday, let the lower back be well rubbed with hot olive oil,\r\nthe patient sitting with the back to the fire, and well covered, except\r\nwhere being rubbed. Continue this rubbing for half-an-hour and not\r\nlonger than three-quarters-of-an-hour. On Wednesday, soap the back well\r\nwith soap lather (_see_) and after the soap rub with oil again. Next\r\nnight, rub with acetic acid (Coutts's) full strength, until the skin is\r\nred and smarts moderately. Repeat this on Friday, and on Saturday and\r\nSabbath do nothing. On Monday rub with acid again, and on Tuesday,\r\netc., proceed as before. All treatment is best done at night, and the\r\npatient must be kept warm. He should also spend as much time as\r\npossible in the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\nLumbago.--Lumbago differs from both paralysis and cramp of the lower\r\nback in that it is not chiefly nervous, as these are, but is a trouble\r\nin the muscular substance itself. The muscles are either sprained or\r\nchilled, so as to have lost for the time their elasticity. Blistering,\r\nburning, and all such irritating treatment are only so many helps to\r\nthe disease. The true method is found in gentle moist heating of the\r\nlower back by a BRAN POULTICE (_see_), not too hot, but renewed, if\r\nneed be, for an hour each evening. Follow this up with a rubbing with\r\nhot olive oil. Wear a belt of new flannel round the body night and day\r\nin winter, or if exposed to cold. The treatment is simple, but if\r\npersevered in, cures most obstinate cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nLungs, Bleeding from.--This is usually taken as a most alarming, and\r\neven hopeless, symptom. It is not necessarily so at all, and even when\r\na considerable amount of blood is lost, the patient may recover.\r\nTherefore, let friends not be frightened when this occurs, but bend\r\ntheir energies to proper treatment, and all danger may be averted. All\r\nalcohol must be avoided; it is most hurtful in such cases. Pack the\r\nfeet and legs in a hot blanket FOMENTATION (_see_) and press cold\r\ncloths gently and equally over the chest or back where the blood is\r\nfelt to be coming from: thus you stimulate the enfeebled nerves and\r\nbrace the relaxed lungs at one and the same time. Relief will usually\r\nbe felt at the end of two or three minutes. Continue the application\r\ntill all pain and uneasiness are gone.\r\n\r\n_Before_ taking the legs out of the warm pack, dry the chest carefully,\r\nrub it with warm olive oil, and wrap it up in good new flannel. Then\r\ntake out the feet and dry them well; rub them gently and well with warm\r\noil, put on a pair of soft cotton stockings, and allow the patient to\r\nrest. Squeeze an orange and give him an orange drink (_see_ Drinks).\r\n\r\nWhen you have used this fomentation to the feet, and cold cloths once\r\nor twice, it will be well to place a large bran poultice across the\r\nlower part of the back, taking care again that this is only comfortably\r\nhot. When you have had the benefit of this once or twice, you may place\r\na similar poultice between the shoulders; but this only after you have\r\nso far succeeded in cooling down the inflamed lung or lungs, as the\r\ncase may be. During the whole of the treatment it will be well to watch\r\nwhat is agreeable to the sufferer. It is not only that a certain\r\ntreatment, or degree of treatment, comforts, but that it comforts\r\nbecause it heals. Move the patient as little as possible during\r\ntreatment, and do and say all possible to soothe the mind.\r\n\r\nThe whole treatment should be gone over a second time within twelve\r\nhours. The second day give one application of the treatment only, and\r\nrepeat once again the third day. Except for the first time, the\r\ntreatment may be limited to half-an-hour. Avoid hot food or drink, but\r\nit is not necessary to have it positively _cold_. This treatment we\r\nhave found perfectly successful in many cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nLungs, Congestion of the.--Treatment as below. Read preceding and\r\nsucceeding articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLungs, Inflammation of the.--This is a common trouble in our climate,\r\nand, fortunately, one not difficult to cure if taken in time and\r\nproperly treated. It is usually the result of a chill, and is\r\naccompanied with pain and inability to breathe properly, distressing\r\nfever, and often delirium. To begin with, all its evils arise from the\r\nrelaxing of the vessels of the lungs, so that these swell, and the\r\nexcess of blood causes inflammatory action to supervene. To guard\r\nagainst it, then, those influences must be avoided which reduce\r\nvitality; where they cannot be avoided, all must be done to counteract\r\nthem. Mere exposure to cold or wet, unless accompanied by exhaustion\r\nfrom hunger, or grief, or other influence of the kind, rarely causes\r\nthis trouble.\r\n\r\nWhere the trouble has set in, the treatment is the same as recommended\r\nabove in Lungs, Bleeding from. If the patient be a very strong person,\r\nand the fever very great, the fomentation to the feet may be dispensed\r\nwith; but if any uncomfortable coldness is felt, or the patient not\r\nabove average strength, it should always be applied. No one who has not\r\nseen it can imagine the magical effect such treatment has. It is\r\nsimple, but its efficiency has been demonstrated in a very large number\r\nof cases of cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaria.--Is now known to be conveyed by the bite of a certain kind of\r\nmosquito. Those who live in a malarious district should carefully\r\nexclude these from their houses, and by draining swamps and covering\r\nwater butts prevent their breeding, which is always in stagnant water.\r\nIf, however, exposure to infection cannot be prevented, much may be\r\ndone to strengthen the system to resist it. Firstly, note that there is\r\na great deal in the _food and drink_ of a family compelled to live in\r\nsuch a district. If they live largely on animal food, and drink\r\nalcoholic liquors, they will seriously add to the power of malarial\r\ninfluence. The use of simple food and _pure water_ will very much\r\nlessen it. Let us note that the very opposite of the popular\r\nsuperstition is the truth. A single glassful of gin, whiskey, or\r\nbrandy, instead of \"fortifying\" against such infection, actually knocks\r\ndown the \"fortifications\" which nature has reared against its power.\r\nThese drinks, then, must be strictly avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Muscles of Back\r\n               (Surface muscles removed on right side exposing the\r\n                deeper ones).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Massaging the Back.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Massaging the Back.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMassage.--This seems a very simple thing to do, but is by no means easy\r\nto do right, and it is very desirable that any one who can see it done\r\nby a qualified person should take advantage of the opportunity. The\r\nrubber must keep his attention closely fixed on the work, and though\r\nthis is fatiguing to body and mind, it is absolutely necessary if the\r\npatient is to derive full benefit from the treatment. The skin should\r\nfirst be lightly rubbed with olive oil; except in very special cases\r\n\"friction\" between hand and skin is to be avoided. The hand should move\r\nthe skin to and fro over the muscles and bones beneath, and should be\r\nalways elastic, so as to go easily in and out of the hollows, and avoid\r\nviolent contact with projecting bones in the case of emaciated\r\npatients. The good rubber should know anatomy so far as to understand\r\nwhere bones and muscles lie (_See_ Diagram, page 216). An intelligent\r\nmoving of all the muscles of a part is almost equal in benefit to\r\ngymnastic exercise, and can of course be given to those for whom\r\ngymnastics are out of the question. Yet such rubbing may fatigue a very\r\nweak patient, and care must be taken not to carry it too far at one\r\ntime. There should also never be any hurting of the skin. Where the\r\nhands are felt too rough, the back may be covered with a soft cloth,\r\noiled with olive oil. All _strong_ strokes in rubbing the limbs should\r\nbe directed _inwards_ to where the limb joins the body. The lighter\r\nstrokes should be outwards. It is always well to have a light and heavy\r\nstroke, as a joiner has in sawing.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of how to squeeze, let us take an arm that has got wrong\r\nsomehow. If you take this arm between your two hands very gently, you\r\nfeel that it is harder than it should be. The large muscles, even when\r\nthe arm is at perfect rest, have a hard feeling to your hands, and not\r\nthe soft, nice feeling which a perfectly healthy arm has. Probably the\r\nmuscles have been over-stretched, and sprained, or they have been\r\nchilled, and so have lost their elasticity and softness. Well, it will\r\nbe so far good if you can bathe this arm in hot water. It will be\r\nbetter still if the hot water used is full of SOAP (_see_). You can\r\nmake this bathing ten times more effective, if you only know what is\r\nmeant by a proper squeezing of the muscles. You use your two hands in\r\nthe water of the soapy bath, and taking the arm between them, gently\r\npress the muscles between your hands, with a sort of working upon them\r\nthat makes the blood in the stiff parts rush out and in, according as\r\nyou press or relieve the pressure. If you can only get hold of the\r\nidea, it will not be difficult to do this right. It may be that the\r\ncords of the arm are not only hard, but also contracted, so that the\r\narm cannot be straightened or bent as it ought to be, but it is still\r\nso squeezable that you can squeeze the blood out of it, and it is still\r\nso elastic that when you relieve it of the pressure of your hands the\r\nblood rushes back into it. If this squeezing is kindly and slowly done,\r\nit will feel very pleasant, and very soon its good effect will be\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Massaging the Arm.]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes thought that there is some \"magic\" in one person's\r\nhands that is not in another's. Here is a case in which one person has\r\nrubbed, he thinks, perfectly right, and no relief has come. Another\r\nbrings relief in a few minutes. It is concluded that some mysterious\r\n\"gift\" is possessed by the latter. This may do well enough for an\r\nexcuse when you do not care to have the trouble of curing your\r\nfellow-creatures, but it is not true. If we are to \"covet earnestly the\r\nbest gifts,\" it must be possible for all of us to get them. \"The gift\r\nof healing\" is surely one worth \"coveting,\" and we think must be within\r\nreach, or we should not be told so to covet it. _See also_ Head,\r\nRubbing the.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Massaging the Arm.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasles.--An attack of this disease generally begins with a feeling of\r\nweariness. Then it appears as running and irritation of the eyes and\r\nnostrils, at which stage it is often taken for a common cold, the\r\nsymptoms being very similar. Then this irritation spreads more or less\r\nover all the breathing apparatus, and finally the eruption appears in\r\nsmaller or larger red patches, sometimes almost covering the face and\r\nother parts. The usual advice given is to keep the sufferer warm. It is\r\ngood to do this so far as _avoiding chills_ is concerned, but if the\r\nroom be overheated and kept close and dark, only harm will ensue. The\r\nblinds of the windows should be kept drawn up to their full height, to\r\nadmit as much _light_ as possible. _Fresh air_ should be admitted by\r\nkeeping windows open. If the patient complains of sore eyes, these may\r\nbe shaded by a screen, but not by lowering the blinds. This admission\r\nof free air and light is a very great preventive of the \"dregs\" which\r\nform so troublesome a feature in measles. The room can easily be kept\r\nsufficiently warm by fire in winter, even if the window be open. The\r\npatient must not be allowed to read or use his eyes much, or very\r\nserious mischief may ensue.\r\n\r\nWhen it first appears in eyes and nose, a good large BRAN POULTICE\r\n(_see_) should be placed at the back of the neck and down between the\r\nshoulders. Cold cloths should then be pressed over the brow and upper\r\nface. Do this for an hour. Give to drink lemon or orange drinks (_see_\r\nDrinks), taken hot, and in small quantities at a time. If this\r\ntreatment is well done several times, the trouble may possibly be\r\nchecked at the beginning. Where it has gone further, and cough shows\r\nirritation of the air tubes and lungs, then foment the feet and legs\r\nwhile applying cold cloths over the chest, as in BRONCHITIS (_see_). If\r\nthere be fever, and no signs of rash, then, to bring it out, pack in\r\nthe SOAPY BLANKET (_see_). Where this cannot well be done, a most\r\neffectual pack is a small sheet wrung out of warm water and wrapped\r\nround the whole body, with a blanket wrapped well round it outside to\r\nretain the steam about the skin. But the soap is better. As a rule,\r\nthere is not much need for further treatment when the rash fully\r\ndevelops. If, however, fever still remains, rub all over with hot\r\nvinegar. This is best done in the evening.\r\n\r\nWhen all fever has subsided, a good rubbing of the _back only_ may be\r\ngiven with warm olive oil. This may be done once a day. The feet should\r\nbe watched lest they get clammy or cold.\r\n\r\nFor food, wheaten-meal porridge and milk food generally is the best. Do\r\nnot give too much food at first, and keep the bowels well open.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicines.--The delusion that health can be restored by swallowing\r\ndrugs is so widespread that we think it well to quote the following\r\nwise words from the _Lancet_:--\r\n\r\n\"An eminent physician not long deceased was once giving evidence in a\r\nwill case, and on being asked by counsel what fact he chiefly relied\r\nupon as establishing the insanity of the testator, replied without a\r\nmoment's hesitation: 'Chiefly upon his unquestioning faith in the value\r\nof my prescriptions.' It might perfectly well be contended that this\r\nevidence failed to establish the point at issue, and that faith in the\r\nprescriptions of a physician hardly deserved to be stigmatised in so\r\nsevere a manner. But admitting this, there is still little to be said\r\nin favour of the sagacity, even if we admit the sanity, of the numerous\r\npeople who spend money and thought over the business of physicking\r\nthemselves, and who usually, if not indeed always, bring this business\r\nto an unfortunate conclusion. The whole tendency of what may be called\r\npopular pharmacy during the last few years has been in the direction of\r\nintroducing to the public a great variety of powerful medicines, put up\r\nin convenient forms, and advertised in such a manner as to produce in\r\nthe unthinking, a belief that they may be safely and rightly\r\nadministered at all times and seasons, as remedies for some real or\r\nsupposed malady. All this, of course, has been greatly promoted by\r\ncolumn after column of advertisement in magazines and lay newspapers;\r\nbut we are compelled to admit that the medical profession cannot be\r\nheld free from some amount of blame in the matter or from some\r\nresponsibility for the way in which drugs have lately been popularised\r\nand brought into common use as articles of domestic consumption.\r\nMedical men have failed, we think, sufficiently to impress upon the\r\npublic and upon patients that the aim of reasonable people should be to\r\nkeep themselves in health rather than to be always straying, as it\r\nwere, upon the confines of disease and seeking assistance from drugs in\r\norder to return to conditions from which they should never have\r\nsuffered themselves to depart. The various alkaline salts and\r\nsolutions, for example, the advertisements of which meet us at every\r\nturn, and which are offered to the public as specifics, safely to be\r\ntaken, without anything so superfluous as the advice of medical men,\r\nfor all the various evils which are described by the advertisers as\r\ngout or as heartburn, or as the consequences of 'uric acid,' do\r\nunquestionably, in a certain proportion of cases, afford temporary\r\nrelief from some discomfort or inconvenience. They do this\r\nnotwithstanding persistence in the habit or in the indulgence, whatever\r\nit may be, the over-eating, the want of exercise, the excessive\r\nconsumption of alcohol or of tobacco, which is really underlying the\r\nwhole trouble which the drugs are supposed to cure and which at the\r\nvery best they only temporarily relieve, while they permit the\r\ncontinuance of conditions leading ultimately to degeneration of tissue\r\nand to premature death. This is the moral which it is, we contend, the\r\nduty of the profession to draw from the daily events of life. The\r\nnatural secretions of the human stomach are acid, and the acidity is\r\nsubservient to the digestive functions. It cannot be superseded by\r\nartificial alkalinity without serious disturbance of nutrition; and the\r\naim of treatment, in the case of all digestive derangements, should be\r\nto cure them by changing the conditions under which they arise, not to\r\npalliate them for a time by the neutralisation of acid, which may,\r\nindeed, give relief from present trouble, but which leaves unaltered\r\nthe conditions upon which the trouble really depends. Those who look\r\ndown the obituary lists of the newspapers will be struck by the fact\r\nthat large numbers of people, in prosperous circumstances, die as\r\nsexagenarians from maladies to which various names are given but which\r\nare, as a rule, evidences of degeneration and of premature senility,\r\nwhile many who pass this period go on to enter upon an eighth or ninth\r\ndecade of life. The former class, we have no doubt, comprise those who\r\nhave lived without restraint of their appetites, and who have sought to\r\nallay some of the consequences thence arising by self-medication, while\r\nthe latter class comprises those who have lived reasonably, and who, if\r\nannoyed by imperfect digestion, have sought relief by ascertaining and\r\nby abandoning the errors from which it sprang.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the most pernicious and dangerous of all the patent medicines on\r\nthe market are the so-called \"Headache Powders,\" whose almost\r\ninstantaneous effects testify to the potency of the drugs they contain.\r\nSuch powerful agents carry their own condemnation, for they cannot in\r\nthe nature of things _remove the cause_ of the pain; hence their action\r\nis limited to narcotising the nerves. The disease continues, the damage\r\ngoes on, but the faithful sentinels are put to sleep. These headache\r\npowders so increased the deaths from heart failure in New York City a\r\ncouple of years ago that it became necessary to warn the public against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory, Loss of.--A more or less complete suspension of this faculty is\r\na not uncommon form of mental and bodily illness. We do not so much\r\nmean the mere fading of past impressions as the loss of power to recall\r\nthem, so that we cannot recall what we wish to remember. This is a\r\nresult of any serious bodily weakness. It will come on through any\r\nexhausting exertion, or prolonged and weakening illness. Stomach\r\ndisorder will also cause it. In this last case, drinking a little hot\r\nwater at intervals will usually put all right. A cup of very strong tea\r\nwill so derange the stomach in some cases as to cause temporary\r\nsuspension of memory. We mention these cases to prevent overdue alarm\r\nat a perhaps sudden attack. The loss of mental power in such cases does\r\nnot always mean anything very serious.\r\n\r\nJust as the stomach affects the memory, so also much use of memory and\r\nmental strain tells severely upon the stomach. Digestive failures in\r\nstrictly temperate persons often arise from an overstrain of the mind.\r\n\r\nWe explain these two actions, the one of body on mind, and the other of\r\nmind on body, so that care may be taken, on both sides, of the complex\r\nnature we possess. If this is done, there will be little chance of\r\nmemory failing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMind in Disease.--Often a person, because of physical failure, becomes\r\npossessed of an utterly erroneous _idea_, which no reasoning can change\r\nor remove. Indeed, reasoning in such cases is best avoided. Attention\r\nshould rather be directed to the physical cause of the mental state,\r\nwith a view to its removal. Very probably you will find there is want\r\nof sleep, with a dry hard state of the skin of the head, and too high\r\nan internal temperature. You may then work wonders by soaping the head\r\n(_see_ Head, Soaping). The back also should be soaped similarly. If too\r\ngreat a cooling effect is produced by this, wipe off the soap and rub\r\nhot olive oil on the back instead. If this is not sufficient, rub the\r\nlimbs also with the hot oil. We have seen the most pronounced insanity\r\nyield to this treatment, where the cause has been _physical_ and not\r\nmental. The secret of success is in so balancing the heat and cooling\r\napplications that the utmost possible soothing can be given without any\r\nchill.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscarriage.--An expectant mother should lead a quiet, orderly and\r\nhealthful life (_see_ Child-birth). By this we do not mean laziness nor\r\nidleness, nor treating herself as an invalid. On the contrary, plenty\r\nof work, both physical and mental, and regular exercise are most\r\nbeneficial, but care should be taken that work should not go the length\r\nof over-fatigue, and excitement, worry and anxiety should be carefully\r\nguarded against. The round of parties and other social functions into\r\nwhich many brides are drawn, frequently becomes the cause of\r\nmiscarriage and other troubles. Any excitement, mental or physical, is\r\nmost injurious, and the husband and wife who sacrifice present\r\nenjoyment will be richly repaid afterwards in the greater vigor and\r\nhealthiness of the child; while those who live for the present will\r\noften have bitter regrets of what might have been.\r\n\r\nIf any weariness, heaviness, or pain are felt in the region of the\r\nabdomen, groin, or back, half-a-day, a day, or a few days in bed\r\nshould, if possible, be taken. If any appearance of bloody discharge be\r\nnoticed, there is decided danger of miscarriage, and the patient should\r\nimmediately go to bed, remaining, as far as possible, perfectly flat on\r\nthe back until the discharge ceases. It is even useful to raise the\r\nfeet higher than the head, by placing bricks or blocks under the feet\r\nof the bed. The covering on the bed should be light, only just what is\r\nnecessary to keep one comfortable, and the windows should be kept open.\r\nLight food should be sparingly taken for a day or two; not much liquid,\r\nand nothing hot should be drunk. A towel, wrung out of cold water,\r\nplaced over the abdomen or wherever pain is felt, and changed when warm\r\nfor a fresh cold towel (_see_ Bleeding), will help to soothe the pain,\r\nallay the hemorrhage, and induce sleep. The mind should be kept at\r\nease, for such precautions, taken in time, will probably put all right.\r\nAfter the hemorrhage has entirely ceased, and all pain disappeared,\r\nsome days should be spent in bed, and active life be only gradually and\r\ncautiously returned to. When there is danger of miscarriage, purgatives\r\nshould be avoided; a mild enema is a safer remedy, if needful, but for\r\ntwo or three days perfect rest is best, and if the food be restricted,\r\nthe absence of a motion of the bowels will not do any harm. The patient\r\nshould, of course, have the bed to herself.\r\n\r\nMiscarriages most frequently occur from the 8th to the 12th week of\r\npregnancy. The time at which the menses would appear if there were no\r\npregnancy, is a more likely time for a miscarriage than any other.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that miscarriages are very weakening and\r\nlowering to the general health, and to be dreaded much more than a\r\nconfinement. The latter is a natural process, and, under healthy\r\nconditions, recovery of strength after it is rapid, while a miscarriage\r\nis unnatural, and is frequently followed by months of ill-health.\r\nAnother thing to be remembered is that a habit of miscarriage may be\r\nestablished; after one, or more especially after two or three, there is\r\nlikelihood of a further repetition of such accidents, resulting in\r\ntotal break-up of health.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscular Action, Weak.--The heart is the most important of all muscles.\r\nSometimes the action of this is so weak that the pulse in the right\r\nwrist is imperceptible, and that in the left extremely feeble. The\r\nheart may be beating at the usual rate, only its stroke is much too\r\nfeeble; and the effects are found in enfeebled life generally,\r\nsometimes shown in fainting fits. If such come on, lay the patient flat\r\non his back, and if consciousness does not return shortly, apply a hot\r\nFOMENTATION (_see_) to the spine.\r\n\r\nSometimes this heart weakness is only a part of a general muscular\r\nfailure. Muscles elsewhere in the body may even swell and become\r\npainful. If strychnine be prescribed, refuse it. It has only a\r\ntemporary power for good, soon passing into a wholly bad effect.\r\nThoroughly good vapour baths will effect some relief, and may be taken\r\nto begin with. The best remedy is found in gentle rubbing and squeezing\r\nthe muscles in every part, specially attending to any that may be\r\nswollen and painful. Squeeze gently the muscular mass, so as to press\r\nthe blood out of it. Relax the pressure again so as to admit the blood.\r\nWhere no help can be had, we have known a patient so squeeze herself as\r\nto restore action to a useless limb. But of course it is best if it be\r\nwell and frequently done, say twice a day, by a really careful operator\r\nwho has some idea of anatomy. This may seem a simple remedy, but we\r\nhave known two inches added to the length of a shrunken limb by its\r\nmeans, and the patient restored from apparently hopeless lameness to\r\nfair walking power. _See_ Massage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscular Pains.--These pains occur usually when a patient has been for\r\nsome time in one position, sitting or lying, and rises suddenly in a\r\nparticular way. They sometimes take such hold of the breast or back\r\nmuscles as to make it appear as if some serious disease were present;\r\neven in the limbs they may cause great distress on any sudden motion.\r\nThey may arise from a gradual _overdoing_ of the muscles concerned.\r\nThey are similar to what is commonly called a sprain, but as they are\r\n_gradually_ produced their cause is often overlooked, and needless\r\ndistress of mind caused by taking the pain for that of cancer or some\r\nsuch trouble. We write to point out that pains do not always mean\r\nserious disease, and before any one becomes despairing about their\r\nhealth, they should make sure they understand their case thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThese pains, too, refuse to yield to ordinary hot and cold methods of\r\ntreatment. The remedy is found internally in half a teaspoonful of\r\n_tincture of Guaiacum_ in a teacupful of hot water three times a day.\r\nAfter two or three days, a teaspoonful of the tincture may be taken in\r\nthe cup of water. Continue until two ounces of tincture have been used.\r\nOr the tabloids of _Guaiacum and sulphur_, now found in our drug shops,\r\nmay be taken, one tabloid representing the half-teaspoonful of\r\ntincture.\r\n\r\nExternally, rub gently yet firmly the affected muscles with warm oil\r\nfor ten minutes or so once a day for a week or ten days. Of course,\r\nrest must be taken, and the overstress which caused the trouble avoided\r\nin future.\r\n\r\n\r\nMustard Oil.--Where this is recommended the cold-drawn oil is meant,\r\nnot the essential oil. The latter is a fiery blister.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarcotics.--The use of these to give temporary relief, often\r\ndegenerating into a habit, causes so much serious disease that we have\r\nfelt constrained to insert an article warning our readers in regard to\r\nit. The use of tobacco we have found a fruitful source of dangerous\r\nillness. It tends to destroy nerve power, and through this to relax the\r\nmuscular system. It has a most dangerous effect upon the mind, relaxing\r\nthe brain, and even causing some of its functions to cease. It hinders\r\nclear reasoning, and in many cases brings on incipient paralysis. It is\r\na fruitful source of cancerous diseases of the mouth. It destroys\r\nkeenness of vision. It is of no use to quote exceptional cases in such\r\nan argument. Great men have smoked, as some great men have habitually\r\ndrunk, to excess. But that is no argument for the average man of whom\r\nwe speak. The very difficulty he has in giving up the use of tobacco\r\nindicates a diseased state of the nerves, which no wise man will\r\nwillingly bring on himself.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the continued use of opium, chloral, and many drugs taken\r\nto gain soothing or sleep is _dreadful_: so much so that we have seen\r\npatients who were deprived of them, after some time of continuous use,\r\nperfectly _mad_ with agony. Let our readers remember that the relief\r\ngiven in using such drugs comes from a benumbing of the vital nerves.\r\nTheir influence is _deadening_, and, if strong enough, kills as surely\r\nas a bullet. The wise medical man will, if he does administer such\r\ndrugs, take care they are only taken once or twice. If a doctor orders\r\ntheir continual use he is to be distrusted. By all means let our\r\nreaders avoid the terrible snare of ease and sleep obtained through\r\nnarcotics. It is generally easy to give relief, in the various ways\r\ndescribed in these papers, without resort to any such hurtful methods.\r\n\r\nSuppose that you try a very hot application to the roots of the nerves\r\naffected, if you can guess about where those roots are. The doctor\r\nshould help you to know this. The hot poultice is put on--we shall say\r\nit fails to relieve. Well, you put on a cold application at the same\r\nplace. That relieves slightly. Whichever of the applications relieves\r\nshould be followed up vigorously. Do not say, \"Oh, it gives relief for\r\na little, and then the pain returns.\" Follow up the little relief, and\r\nchange from heat to cold as the pain or relief indicates. You can do no\r\npossible harm by such processes, and in multitudes of cases all will\r\nsoon be right, and no opiate required at all. But you must not think\r\nall remedies at an end when you have tried one or two singly, and\r\nrelief does not yet come. The large hot poultice may be put on the\r\nroots of the affected nerves, and ice-cold cloths placed on the\r\nbranches of these nerves at the same time. Then the cold ice cloths may\r\nbe placed on the roots and the hot on the branches. But remedies are\r\nnot exhausted, by any means, when you have thought of two or three\r\napplications of heat and cold. The whole nerve system can be influenced\r\nby the rubbing of the head and spinal region, so as to wake up a strong\r\nincrease of vital action in the nerve centres there. We have seen a\r\npatient who had been for months under medical treatment, and in agony\r\nexcept when deadened with narcotics, rendered independent of all such\r\nthings by a little skilful rubbing alone. Perhaps you object that these\r\nremedies are \"very simple.\" Well, that would be no great harm; but if\r\nthey are so simple, you are surely a simpleton if you let your poor\r\nnerves be killed with morphia, while such obvious remedies are at hand.\r\n(_See_ Massage.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNeck, Stiff.--For this, rub the whole back with soap lather (_see_\r\nLather; Soap), and then with acetic acid and olive oil. Rub the neck\r\nitself as recommended for Muscular Action.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeck, Twisted.--This arises from the undue contraction of some of the\r\nmuscles in the neck. It generally shows itself first in the evening,\r\nafter the day's fatigue, and if neglected, or treated with blistering,\r\niodine, etc., may become a chronic affliction. Yet it is not difficult\r\nto cure by right means. Opium should never be used. We have seen\r\nterrible suffering follow its use. The true cause must be attacked,\r\nwhich is an undue irritation of the nerve which controls one of the\r\nmuscles, so that it contracts and pulls the head away. The nerves of\r\nthe muscles which counteract this pull are also probably low in\r\nvitality, so that there is a slackening on one side and a pull on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, for a cure, there must be _rest_. Not more than three\r\nhours at a time should be spent in an erect posture, and between each\r\nspell of three hours let one hour be spent lying down. Avoid _all_\r\nmovement while lying, as far as possible. Secondly, soap the back\r\nthoroughly with LATHER (_see_) at bedtime. Cover the well-lathered skin\r\nwith a large, soft cloth, leaving the cloth and lather on all night,\r\nand covering over all with flannel in sufficient quantity to keep the\r\npatient warm. If the spasmodic twitching comes on, apply cold cloths\r\nrepeatedly to the back of the neck for an hour in the morning. If this\r\nis felt too cold, apply for a shorter time.\r\n\r\nIf the neck has become hard and fixed in a wrong position, rub as\r\nrecommended in Muscular Action. This treatment has cured many cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nNerve Centres, Failing.--Many diseases flow from this cause, but at\r\npresent we only consider one. That is where a \"numbness\" begins to show\r\nitself in fingers and toes, and to creep up the limbs. No time should\r\nbe lost in treating such a case. It arises from failure in the spinal\r\nnerves, and these must be nursed into renewed vitality. This will be\r\ngreatly helped by wearing over the back next the skin a piece of new\r\nflannel. Rub (_see_ Massage) the back with warm olive oil night and\r\nmorning, working especially up and down each side of the spine. Pursue\r\nthis rubbing gently but persistently, but do not fatigue the patient,\r\nwhich may easily be done. Cease rubbing the moment fatigue manifests\r\nitself. Continue this treatment for weeks even, and also treat, as in\r\nnext articles, _mind_ as well as body. (_See_ Locomotor Ataxia.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNerve Pain.--_See_ Pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNerve Shock.--After a fright, or some very trying experience, some part\r\nof the nervous system is frequently found to have given way. Heat is\r\nfelt in the stomach. Then, if no treatment is given, curious feelings\r\ncome on in the back of the head. Even inflammation of the stomach and\r\nbrain may come on in severe cases. In any such trouble, alcoholic\r\ndrinks, blisters, opium, and all narcotics are to be strictly avoided.\r\nThese only lessen the already weak nerve power. Show the patient in the\r\nfirst place that there is no need for anxiety, the vast majority of\r\nsuch cases being easily curable by right treatment. We have seen this\r\nrelief of mind alone effect a perfect cure. Therefore see to giving it.\r\nWring tightly out of cold water two ply of new flannel, large enough to\r\ngo round the lower part of the body, from waist downwards to hips. Put\r\nthese round the patient, with two dry ply of the same flannel above\r\nthem. Wear this night and day for a week or a fortnight. Keep the feet\r\nalways warm and dry. Give plain, easily digested food. If St. Vitus'\r\nDance shows itself, treat as directed under that head. Study the case\r\nin the light of all said on nervous troubles in these pages, and you\r\nwill be able to cure almost any symptoms which may arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nNerves, Shaken.--By this we mean, not the nerve trouble which follows a\r\nsudden injury or fright, but the result of long-continued worry and\r\noverwork. Sleeplessness, great irritability of temper, depressing\r\nthoughts, restlessness, and even a wish for death, are all symptoms of\r\nthis trouble. In any effort to cure it, the _mind_ must be largely\r\nconsidered. Thoughts of the constant care of a loving, Divine Saviour\r\nfor even the least of His children, must be encouraged. Work, which is\r\nan intolerable burden when depressing thoughts are encouraged, will\r\nbecome easy when these are removed. If you get the sufferer made\r\nhopeful for time and for eternity too, you have half won the battle.\r\n\r\nAgain, in bodily matters, food or drink which is exciting must be given\r\nup, or very sparingly used. Tea should only be taken weak, and _at\r\nmost_ twice a-day. Avoid long conversations, and especially discussions\r\nand debates. Let the head be soaped (_see_ Head, Soaping) with soap\r\nlather at night, and rub all over with hot vinegar and olive oil before\r\nrising in the morning. Many a shaken nervous system will speedily\r\nrecover under such treatment. Take also _eight good hours_ for sleep,\r\nand allow no ideas of business or work to intrude upon them. No more\r\nvaluable habit can be formed, by the healthy as well as by the nervous,\r\nthan this. The whole will should resolutely be bent to remove the\r\nattention from every trying thought, when the hours of work are past,\r\nand especially on retiring to rest. Always recollect that this _can_ be\r\n_done_; assert mentally, or if necessary, audibly, that it shall. Do\r\nnot let initial failure disappoint you; persevere and a habit will be\r\nformed. When the brain gets a fair rest in its hours of leisure, it is\r\nusually equal to all demands in ordinary hours of work.\r\n\r\nAll brain workers, in their leisure hours should let the brain rest,\r\nand if they must do something, let it be as diverse from their work,\r\nand as easy on the thinking power as is possible. (_See_ Worry).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From \"Furneaux's Elementary Physiology.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nNerves, Spinal.--The spinal cord is continuous with the back part of\r\nthe brain. It is a mass of nerve fibres, and from it branch off in\r\npairs, all the way down from the brain, the great nerves which move the\r\nlimbs and muscles of the body, and receive the impressions of sensation\r\nfor conveyance to the brain. It is permeated by numerous blood vessels,\r\nwhich supply what is needed for the upkeep of the whole mass. When\r\nthese relax, and become overfilled with blood, we have congestion of\r\nthe spinal cord. This may often be easily remedied by cold cloths\r\napplied over the spine, with fomentations to the feet if necessary\r\n(_see_ Children's Healthy Growth; Fall; Paralysis; St. Vitus' Dance).\r\nIf, on the other hand, the vessels are contracted, or the blood supply\r\ndefective, we have great languor and coldness. This usually may be\r\nremedied by rubbing over the spine with hot olive oil. Violent heat, or\r\nblistering, simply destroys the skin, and hinders healthy action.\r\nGentle heat, or gentle cooling, long continued, is the best treatment.\r\nEspecially is this true in the case of little children (_see_\r\nChildren's Healthy Growth). For treatment of the nervous system,\r\npeculiar attention should always be paid to the point where all the\r\nspinal nerves enter and issue from the brain. This is at the hollow\r\nusually present at the base of the back of the skull, where it is\r\njointed on to the spinal bones. Rubbing here is most powerful, either\r\nwith acetic acid or olive oil, and hot or cold cloths should always be\r\nwell pressed into the hollow, when applied to the head or upper spine.\r\n(_See_ Diagram, page 234).\r\n\r\nFailures of muscular power are caused by failure in the spinal cord. If\r\na child cannot walk, but only trails his legs, or if he cannot hold his\r\nhead erect, skilful rubbing with hot oil on the spine will often quite\r\ncure the defects. Do not rub too hard. Feel for the muscles around the\r\nspine, and gently insinuate healing influence with your fingers, so as\r\nto reach the nerves below. Use a moderate quantity of oil, and the\r\neffects will be marvellous.\r\n\r\n\r\nNerves, Troubled.--Often a state of the nerves exists, without any\r\napparent unhealthiness, which makes the whole system so sensitive, that\r\nordinary sights, sounds, and smells become unbearable, and the patient\r\nfeels the ordinary round of experience, which would never be noticed\r\notherwise, an intolerable burden. Strange feelings all over the body,\r\nand an indescribable series of seemingly \"fanciful\" troubles, come on.\r\nIt is of no use, and indeed injurious, to treat such cases as merely\r\nfanciful. The wrong bodily condition must be righted if the mental\r\ncondition is to improve. The first thing needed is _quiet_. Quietness\r\nrests the overstrained nervous system very much. Nerve-benumbing drugs\r\nare most hurtful (_see_ Narcotics). Let the light in the room be\r\nsubdued, and strong smells avoided. To rest the skin nerves, wear only\r\nKneipp linen underclothing, and flannels _above_ this if required.\r\nBathe the tongue and palate by taking mildly warm water into the mouth\r\nand ejecting it again. Soap the head, and all over the body, if it can\r\nbe done without chilling, three times a week. (_See_ Head, Soaping;\r\nLather, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nNervous Attacks.--What we call, for want of a better name, \"nerve\r\nforce,\" or \"nerve action,\" is at any one time a definite quantity. In\r\nhealth it is distributed to all the sets of nerves equally, so that all\r\nwork in harmony. But if its distribution be altered in certain ways, we\r\nfind \"fits\" or \"attacks\" coming on. Action is greatly exaggerated in\r\none part, and as greatly lessened in another--hence violent movements\r\nand complete unconsciousness co-exist. Children often have such fits.\r\nWhere they arise from _indigestion_ as a result of bad food, the cure\r\nis found in teaspoonfuls of hot water, and a hot sitz-bath coming up\r\nover the bowels. Where bad blood causes the fits, poultices over the\r\nkidneys will usually help greatly. (For fits of teething children,\r\n_see_ Teething.) _See also_ Epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNervousness.--This frequent and distressing trouble is to be traced to\r\na state of the nervous system in which sensibility has got the upper\r\nhand, and self-control is partly lost. It is difficult accurately and\r\nbriefly to describe, but is an easily recognisable state. Firstly,\r\nthen, we say this is a physical trouble, and the patient must not be\r\nblamed for it, but encouraged kindly to make every effort of _will_ to\r\nthrow it off. A strong will can be cultivated, just as a strong arm, by\r\n_exercise_. Peaceful thoughts and Christian faith can also be\r\ncultivated, and anxious and disturbing ideas put down. Uniform, steady\r\nconduct on the part of all around is an enormous help to the nervous.\r\nFor physical remedies, use no alcoholic drinks. These give temporary\r\nrelief, but are fatal in their after effects. To cure nervousness is\r\nimpossible unless these are given up. The physical treatment necessary\r\nwill be found under Nerves, Shaken, and Nerves, Troubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nNervous Prostration.--Persons suffering from nervous prostration have\r\nprobably allowed the urgency of seeming duty to drive them on in work\r\ntill the vital energies have been fairly exhausted. At last they are\r\ncompletely broken down, and the very fountains of life are dried up.\r\nThe brain itself has become incapable of giving sleep, or sound\r\nthought. But there is no need for despondency: this trouble is\r\nperfectly curable, only the right means must be employed.\r\n\r\nIn every case of real \"nervous prostration,\" our question must be--How\r\nshall we enable this vital element to recreate itself? The answer is,\r\nwith heat. Here we may detail the process which we know to be\r\nsuccessful. Dip a four-ply cotton cloth in cayenne lotion, and lightly\r\nwring out. Lay this gently over the stomach and bowels, and over this\r\nan india-rubber bag full of hot water. All must be only hot enough to\r\nbe comfortable. This application may remain on for two hours without\r\nany change, then it is repeated. Where no bag can be had, a good thick\r\nfomentation should be used instead. _See_ Nerves, Shaken; Nerves,\r\nTroubled, and all articles on nervous trouble.\r\n\r\nMuch depends on consideration of the individual case, and careful\r\nthought and strong sense are needed on the part of all dealing with\r\nsuch cases. (_See_ Changing Treatment.)\r\n\r\nDessertspoonfuls of light food should be given every half-hour, and\r\nincreased in quantity as the patient can bear it. Avoid alcohol and all\r\nnarcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\nNettle Rash.--This is an eruption on the skin, often coming suddenly\r\nand going off again, but sometimes of long standing. It resembles in\r\nappearance the sting of a nettle--hence the name. It is accompanied by\r\nan intolerable itching, and is a very sore trouble where it continues,\r\nor frequently recurs. Its cause is usually defective digestion. We\r\nshould not depend on drugs for a cure, but treat first the whole spinal\r\nsystem. Rub the whole back smartly with vinegar. Wipe this off, and rub\r\nagain with gentle pressure and warm olive oil. Put on the soapy cloth\r\n(_see_ Soap) with the lather very finely wrought (_see_ Lather), and\r\nfree from excess of moisture. Over this lathered cloth put a good\r\nblanket Fomentation (_see_), changing it once or twice, so as to keep\r\nup the heat for half-an-hour. When all this is taken off, we should rub\r\nagain with vinegar and oil, as at first. If the case is a sudden\r\nattack, we may soak the worst parts of the eruption with weak vinegar;\r\nbut if a chronic one, the rash is better left untouched. The treatment\r\nto the spine may be continued daily. If the rash has been irritated\r\ninto running, scabby scores by scratching, it may be cleaned with weak\r\nvinegar. A little cream of tartar or powdered rhubarb and carbonate of\r\nsoda mixed in equal parts may be taken internally after meals--say\r\nabout one-fourth of a teaspoonful in a little water. If this quantity\r\nexercise too great a cooling effect, smaller doses will produce very\r\ngood results. Kneipp Linen Underwear will in many cases of such skin\r\ntrouble give great relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeuralgia.--This is severe pain in one part or other of the body,\r\nsometimes followed by swelling of the painful part, but frequently\r\nwithout much sign of anything wrong at that point. It is, as the name\r\nimplies, a trouble affecting the _nerves_ which are connected with the\r\npainful part, and usually there is nothing whatever wrong where the\r\npain is felt. Where, however, violent pain in the head or jaws results\r\nfrom chill, there is an altogether different trouble, though it is\r\noften called by the same name.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a man who had been in agony all night with pain all over\r\nhis head. We took a large piece of flannel, about the size of a small\r\nblanket, rolled it up so as to get about a quart of boiling water\r\npoured into the heart of the roll. We kneaded the whole for a little\r\ntime, to have the heat and moisture well diffused through the flannel.\r\nWe now placed a large towel fourfold on the pillow under the patient's\r\nhead, so that it could be brought as a good covering over the hot\r\nblanket when that was on. We opened up the blanket steaming hot and\r\nlaid the head in the heart of it, bringing it carefully up all round,\r\nthen brought the large towel over all, and tucked him tidily in about\r\nthe shoulders. In less than two minutes he exclaimed, \"I'm in\r\nParadise!\" The pain was all gone, and in its place was a positive\r\nsensation of delight. There was nothing here but a chilled skull to\r\ndeal with, and as soon as it felt the heat and relaxed, the man was\r\nperfectly relieved. Then came the question as to how what had been got\r\nwas to be secured, so that he might continue well. After he lay about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour in this hot fomentation of the head, we took\r\nit off, and rubbed gently some warm olive oil into the roots of the\r\nhair, and all around the head and neck. We then gave all a good dry\r\nrubbing with a hard towel, and covered up his head carefully, and kept\r\nit covered for a day or two. He required no more treatment of any kind.\r\n\r\nBut when this treatment increases the pain, or fails altogether to\r\nremove it, we have a trouble which calls for the _very opposite\r\ntreatment_. Then we have true neuralgia, which may be in any part of\r\nthe body, and which is relieved by cooling the roots of the nerves\r\nwhich supply that part. For the face and jaws, cold must be applied to\r\nthe back of the head, neck, or brain generally. For pains in arms, cold\r\nis to be applied to the upper, and for pain in legs to the lower part\r\nof the spine; for pain in the body, cool the whole length of the spine.\r\nThe cooling is done by cloths moistened in cold water and well wrung\r\nout, pressed on gently over the part, and renewed as they grow warm. If\r\nthe patient feels chilly, foment or bathe the feet and legs up to the\r\nknees during the process of cooling. This may require to be done for an\r\nhour. Finish by rubbing the parts cooled with hot vinegar and olive\r\noil, and wiping off.\r\n\r\nEven young people are exposed to a great deal of suffering from this\r\nsource, and we feel sure that every one of these may be at once\r\nrelieved and cured by the vigorous use of the cold compress. When the\r\npatient is warm in bed, the cold compress is one of the most delightful\r\nof applications; and the warm olive oil, to keep what has been got,\r\nmake up a real blessing for the sufferer.\r\n\r\nWe have seen cases in which the cold compress has been applied up and\r\ndown the spine, but not with that full effect which could be desired.\r\nSomehow it has not power enough in the hands applying it to reach the\r\nroots of the evil. The want in such a case is generally of a person\r\nsufficiently skilful in the use of the cold towel. There is a way of\r\npressing it gently over all the parts under which the affected nerves\r\nlie, which secures the cooling of those roots very effectually. But\r\nsuch skill is not always at hand when needed. Well, mustard is spread\r\nover the surface of the cold towel, and the compress, thus increased in\r\npower, is placed all along the centre of the back. We find that very\r\nsoon the pain begins to moderate, and ere long it has ceased. If it has\r\nto be applied more than once, cayenne is greatly to be preferred. The\r\npepper does not hurt the skin, the mustard very soon does. A cold damp\r\ntowel, folded at least four-ply, and placed properly, after being\r\nsprinkled well with cayenne, has an excellent effect.\r\n\r\nIn wild toothache, or bad nerve pain in the head, massage all over the\r\nhead for a considerable time will often cure. We know cases in which\r\nagonising pain was thus removed years ago, and it has never returned.\r\nThere was first rubbing, in a gentle soothing way, over the whole head.\r\nAt a certain point, that began to lose its soothing influence. The cold\r\ntowel was then wrapped round the head, and gently pressed. As soon as\r\nit warmed it was changed. This was done for perhaps three or four\r\nminutes, and the rubbing repeated. The whole was kept up for about an\r\nhour. All pain and uneasiness were then gone, and there was no return\r\nof either.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that it is essential properly to distinguish between\r\nthe pain requiring heat and that requiring cold for treatment. In any\r\ncase it is safe first to try the heat. Failing relief with this, the\r\ncold may be tried. Sometimes the cooling of the head and spine succeeds\r\nin driving off several attacks, but eventually fails to relieve. If in\r\nsuch a case the cold is applied over the stomach, there is frequently\r\nalmost instant relief. Where the attacks can be traced to indigestion,\r\nor come on always a certain time after a meal, this is the proper\r\nmethod from the first. Where a decayed tooth is the cause of pain, of\r\ncourse go to the dentist.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight Coughs.--These frequently remain as the so-called dregs of some\r\nillness, and are found very persistent. They are also frequently very\r\nalarming, as they are thought to indicate some trouble in the lungs,\r\nand as immediate steps should be taken to check this, it is well to\r\nconsult a good doctor. But, though coughing at night does of course\r\naccompany lung disease, it is by no means a chief symptom. Also, it is\r\nevident that the treatment applicable to bronchitis and other chest\r\ninflammations will often fail to relieve a night cough, because the\r\nnight cough in question is due to nervous irritation or indigestion.\r\nNarcotics are useless and hurtful. Great relief is frequently found\r\nfrom inhaling the smoke of burning nitre or saltpetre. Blotting paper\r\nmay be soaked in a solution of saltpetre, dried and lighted. Place the\r\nburning substance near enough the patient for him to inhale the smoke,\r\nbut not so near as to interfere with _easy_ breathing, especially in\r\ncases where there is great weakness.\r\n\r\nWhen patients are fairly strong the back should be rubbed with warm\r\nolive oil for ten minutes or so in the morning before getting out of\r\nbed. Then apply a cold towel, well wrung out, folded lengthwise along\r\nthe spine, and over it a dry one. Let the patient lie on this, and\r\nrenew it when heated, continuing altogether for fifteen minutes or so.\r\nGive another fifteen minutes' rubbing with the hot oil before dressing.\r\nIf the patient feels chilly during the cooling, foment the feet and\r\nlegs at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNightmare.--In serious cases of this trouble, the patient awakes some\r\ntime before he gains any power whatever to move, feeling held as in a\r\nvice. But in common instances, the attack is entirely during sleep, and\r\naccompanied by frightful dreams. A heavily-loaded stomach, pressing on\r\nthe solar plexus of the nerves, is a very common cause. The burdened\r\nnerves partially cease action, and this gives rise to the trouble.\r\nAnything similarly affecting these organic nerves will cause it also;\r\nbut if the stomach be at fault, reduce the food and let the last meal\r\nbe light and not later than six o'clock. This followed by a cup of hot\r\nwater, before going to bed, will work a perfect cure. When it is feared\r\nthere may be an attack, _lying on the face_ in bed will often prevent\r\nit, even if the patient so lies for a very short time, and then turns\r\non the side again.\r\n\r\nWhen students, or school children, are over-driven (_see_ Children,\r\nvarious articles), nightmare, very persistent, is one of the symptoms.\r\nIn such cases, there is _urgent need_ of rest, or most serious\r\nconsequences may follow. Treat as recommended in Depression, and if any\r\nnervous troubles show themselves, treat as in various articles on nerve\r\naffections. Bad dreams, especially with children, are a sure sign of\r\nsomething wrong with the health, and should always lead to\r\ninvestigation, that their cause may be found and removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight Pains.--If these are of the nature of _cramps_, which come on\r\nwhile lying in bed, the treatment is similar to that given above as\r\nmorning treatment for Night Coughs, only the cooling must be continued\r\nfor three-quarters of an hour or longer, fomenting the legs if any\r\nchilliness is felt. Cold towels may also be wrung out before going to\r\nbed, and put within reach. These may be applied when the cramps come\r\non. They will usually relieve speedily.\r\n\r\nSpasmodic asthma may be relieved by the same treatment. It often comes\r\non when lying down, and cold towels applied as above directed will\r\ngenerally relieve. Fomentations must be given to the feet and legs, if\r\nany feeling of chill is felt.\r\n\r\nWhere there is _difficulty in breathing_ on lying down, usually the\r\nheart is at fault. Sometimes the heart is all right, and this hard\r\nbreathing is nervous, caused by too sudden lying down. To lie down,\r\npropped up with pillows, which may be removed one by one, is often\r\nsufficient to cure it. The treatment in the morning as in Night Coughs\r\nwill also greatly help.\r\n\r\nAnother set of night troubles are such as arise from unwise use of\r\nfoods or drinks before going to bed. Tea taken at or near bedtime will\r\noften cause sleeplessness, and will be apt also to give spasmodic\r\nasthma; so will all indigestible foods. These overpower weary organs\r\nthat need rest and sleep, and not food. Most people will do well to\r\ntake their last meal four hours before retiring. Taking supper is a\r\nhabit, and in many cases a very bad one.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight Sweats.--This distressing symptom, which accompanies various\r\nillnesses, can in most cases be easily cured. The whole skin is to be\r\nsponged over at bedtime with CAYENNE LOTION (_see_). This is best done\r\nunder the bed-clothes. Acetic acid, the effective essence in vinegar,\r\nhas an astonishing power in healing and stimulating the skin. When it\r\nis assisted by cayenne its healing power is very great indeed. The\r\nnerves are stimulated, the too open pores closed, the skin cleansed,\r\nand the whole system invigorated by such a mixture, and as a result the\r\nnight sweats disappear. Even where the case is hopeless, much suffering\r\nmay be prevented by the use of this mixture. In conjunction with other\r\ntreatment, its use may even turn the scale towards recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoise and Disease.--Perhaps nothing shows more the lack of human\r\nfeeling in many people than the manner in which they inflict sore\r\ndistress on the sick and dying by means of noise. Moreover, recovery is\r\nretarded, and has sometimes been wholly prevented, by nothing but a\r\n_noise_. It must be understood that talking, and also singing, which\r\nare delightful to some, become intolerable pain to the delicate and\r\nweak. They really are _worn out_ by them. And the wearing out is\r\n_real_: it is a destruction of nerve substance, when the nerve of the\r\npatient is already too feeble. Shutting doors violently, and the\r\nendless \"house noises,\" must be avoided. Even a long, loud prayer at\r\nthe bedside of the sick is utterly out of place. It may become\r\nnecessary, in order to prevent such abuses, to exclude from the\r\nsick-room some who will be greatly offended thereby; but courage to\r\ndefend a patient against well-meaning intruders is one essential\r\nqualification of a good nurse. Oil doors that _squeak_, fasten windows\r\nthat _rattle_, but above all keep quiet the tongues that _clatter_. Let\r\nall whispering in the sick one's hearing be avoided. Speak quietly but\r\ndistinctly, so that the patient may not think you are hiding anything\r\nfrom him. Wrap the coals in pieces of paper, so that they can be put on\r\nthe fire by hand, avoiding the noise of shovel or tongs.\r\n\r\nNo one has a right to do what distresses others, and especially when\r\nthey are sick. This principle should guide action. Acting thus will\r\ngive untold rest and ease to the troubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nNostrils, The.--The disease called Polypus, affecting the mouth or\r\nnostril with growths which are usually removed by force, is one of\r\nthose troubles curable by proper use of vinegar or weak acetic acid.\r\nThe extraction of the Polypi is painful, and we have ourselves seen\r\nthem so completely cured, that it is a pity not to make very widely\r\nknown a method of avoiding extraction. A small glass syringe or a\r\n\"nasal douche\" (rubber is best) should be got, such as may easily be\r\nused for syringing the nostrils, or gums, if the growth be on these.\r\nSyringe the growths well with vinegar or ACETIC ACID (_see_), so\r\ndiluted with water as only _very slightly_ to smart when it is applied.\r\nUse this slightly warm, and force it well up the nostril, so that it\r\ngoes even back into the throat. This should be done for a considerable\r\ntime: not so as to feel painful, but long enough to produce a decided\r\neffect, which remains on ceasing. Dry the nostrils with a little soft\r\nlint or clean rag, and force in a little fine almond oil. Do all this\r\ntwice a day for a fortnight at least. In a bad case, a BRAN POULTICE\r\n(_see_) may be applied to the back of the head and neck, coming down\r\nover the spine between the shoulders.\r\n\r\nSimilar growths on other membranes, if accessible, may be cured by acid\r\nin a similar way.\r\n\r\nThis treatment is excellent for an ordinary cold in the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nNourishment.--Nothing is more required in healing than properly to\r\n_nourish_ the enfeebled body. In its commencement proper nourishment\r\ndemands a proper mixture of food and saliva. In fever, if there be\r\nlittle or no saliva present, food requiring much saliva to fit it for\r\ndigestion only injures. This is the case with so-called _rich_ foods,\r\nespecially. Excessive thirst usually marks this deficiency of saliva.\r\nAlways consider carefully the flow of saliva before feeding a patient\r\nin a weak state. Get the mouth to \"water\" somewhat before giving food.\r\nWe have seen a cold cloth changed several times over the stomach start\r\nthe flow of saliva almost miraculously, relieving the thirst, and\r\nprepare for nourishment which could not be taken before.\r\n\r\nGoing further into the matter, we see that very likely the stomach\r\nrequires assistance to dispose of even well-salivated food. There may\r\nbe a lack of gastric juice. In this case, frequent and small quantities\r\nof hot water supplied to the stomach will greatly help it. A\r\nwineglassful of hot water taken every ten minutes for two, four, or ten\r\nhours will be sufficient (_see_ Digestion; Indigestion). It is well to\r\nthink ten times of the readiness of the system to digest, for once of\r\nthe food to be taken. If the stomach be either burning hot or cold and\r\nchilly, let it be cooled or warmed, as the case may be. Either use cold\r\ntowels or give hot water as above, as the case demands. When it is\r\nbrought into something like a natural state of feeling, you may then\r\ngive food. The hot water will often not only prepare the stomach, but\r\nwill start the flow of saliva in the mouth, and that even when the\r\ncooling cloth has failed to do so.\r\n\r\nA medical man will, at times, forbid water, however thirsty the patient\r\nmay be. He is not unlikely to be labouring under a serious mistake. It\r\nmay be just the want of water which is causing the very symptoms which\r\nhe thinks to cure by withholding it. We never saw anything but\r\nsuffering arise from withholding water from the thirsty.\r\n\r\nMilk is a prime element in nourishing the weak. Mixed with its own bulk\r\nof boiling water, or even with twice as much, it is immensely more easy\r\nto digest. The simple water is of vast importance, and the milk mixed\r\nwith boiling water is quite a different substance for digestion from\r\nthe fresh pure milk. It is better to have a teaspoonful of milk and\r\nwater really digested than a pint of rich milk overloading the stomach.\r\n\r\nMany persons put lime-water into the milk to make it digestible. In\r\ndoing so they put a difficulty in the way, in the shape of the lime. If\r\none tries to wash his hands in \"hard\" water, he sees how unfit that\r\nwater is to do the proper work of water in the blood and tissues of the\r\nbody. Now, it is not difficult to meet this evil where the only water\r\nto be had has a great deal of lime in solution. Boiling this water\r\nmakes it deposit much of its lime. If a very, very small bit of soda is\r\nmixed with it in the boiling, it lets down its lime more quickly and\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nAlcoholic drinks--wine, porter, or ale--are often given as means of\r\nnourishment. They are hurtful in the extreme, as the spirit contained\r\nin them spoils, so far as it acts, both the saliva and the gastric\r\njuice. Rum and milk, sack whey, and other such preparations are equally\r\nbad, and have killed many a patient.\r\n\r\nWhile suitable nourishment is necessary for the sick, great care should\r\nbe taken to avoid giving too much. Often the amount of food the patient\r\nrequires or can assimilate is _exceedingly small_. Injudicious attempts\r\nto \"keep up the strength\" by forcing down food that cannot be digested\r\noften destroy the little that remains, and remove the only hope of\r\ncure. (_See_ also Assimilation; Biscuits and Water; Blood; Bread;\r\nButtermilk; Child-Bearing; Constipation; Diet; Drinks; Dyspepsia;\r\nFoods; Heartburn; Infants' Food.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNourishment, Cold in.--If a person is in fever, and is burning with\r\ninternal heat, a little bit of ice, sucked in the mouth, gives great\r\nrelief. The relief is got in this way: the melted ice, in the form of\r\nwater, is little in bulk in proportion to the heat which is absorbed in\r\nmelting it. To absorb the same heat by means of merely cold water,\r\nwould imply a great amount of water, and an inconvenient filling of the\r\nstomach. The heat used up in melting the small bit of ice is great, and\r\nthe amount of water exceedingly small. This gives benefit without\r\ninconvenience; hence, to suck a bit of ice is to be much preferred in\r\nsuch a case to taking a drink of cold water.\r\n\r\nWithin proper limits, beyond all question, cold is, in certain cases,\r\nessential to nourishment. For example, in a case of thirst such as we\r\nhave noticed, the heat of the stomach extending to the mouth is drying\r\nup all the juices that should go to secure digestion and assimilation.\r\nThe saliva is dried up, and the gastric juice equally so. Cold is\r\napplied to the pit of the stomach (not ice, but a moderate degree of\r\nrepeated cold), and the result is, these juices begin to flow.\r\nNourishment is the consequence, and very clearly, in such a case, it is\r\nthe consequence of cold. In other words, it is the result of reducing\r\nthe excessive internal heat, and leaving something like the proper\r\ndegree behind.\r\n\r\nThe place which cold has in nourishing is, so to speak, negative--that\r\nis, it is useful only in reducing overheating. But when we remember how\r\na frosty morning sharpens appetites and makes the cheeks glow with\r\nruddy health, we see that such reduction of overheat is not\r\ninfrequently required.\r\n\r\n\r\nNourishment, Heat in.--Heat is absorbed in building up the bodily\r\ntissues, and given off when they are disintegrated. To rightly\r\nunderstand this is of great importance in all treatment. When a living\r\nsubstance is growing, it demands heat. An illustration of this is the\r\nsun's heat causing what we call \"growing weather.\" Again, where\r\nsubstances are breaking up, as in burning wood, heat is given out. In\r\nthe stomach, a certain amount of heat is needed during digestion. If it\r\nis not given, indigestion ensues. To swallow ice, where the stomach has\r\nalready insufficient heat, is then great folly. On the other hand, to\r\ntake hot water is to do the very thing which gives the stomach what it\r\nneeds, and so to relieve the indigestion. Many times, when the stomach\r\nsimply stands still from lack of energy, it will move immediately on\r\ngetting a glass of hot water to help it. Similarly, a little genial\r\nheat assists other failing organs. As we have shown how cold diminishes\r\nthe excessive action of inflammation and fever, so we now point out\r\nthat if you can find out what organs are feeble and acting\r\ninsufficiently, and stimulate them with gentle heat, you are on the way\r\nto a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nNursing Over.--Few vital processes are more remarkable than that by\r\nwhich food fitted for adults becomes in the mother's breast food fit\r\nfor the little infant. In nursing it is well to remember that all food\r\nis not equally fit to be so changed. Well-boiled porridge, of either\r\noat or wheaten meal, is probably as good as can be got. Malt liquor,\r\nthough causing a large flow of milk, most seriously deteriorates its\r\nquality, and should be entirely avoided. But in this article we think\r\nchiefly of the mother, and of the necessary drain of blood and vital\r\nforce which she bears in nursing. In most cases this drain is easily\r\nborne, in others the child is fed at the mother's expense. The supply\r\nof power, in such cases, is not equal to the loss of it in feeding the\r\nchild, and the reserve in the mother's body is slowly used up. She\r\nbecomes thin and pale, and her nervous system begins to suffer. When\r\nthis is the case, either means must be used to increase her vital\r\npower, or nursing must at once be given up. Of course, where she may\r\nhave had insufficient or unsuitable food, a change of diet may work a\r\ncure; but, as a rule, the drain of nursing will have to be stopped. To\r\nhelp her restoration, whether she ceases to nurse or not, use the\r\nfollowing mixture and treatment: Boil a stick of best liquorice for\r\nhalf-an-hour in a quart of good soft water. Add one quarter of an ounce\r\nof camomile flowers, and boil for another half-hour. Keep the water up\r\nto the quantity by adding _boiling_ water as required. Strain the\r\nmixture, and give a dessertspoonful thrice a day before meals. If the\r\ndessertspoonful be found too much, a teaspoonful may be taken. The\r\npatient, if any heart trouble is felt, should go to bed early, and have\r\nthe feet and legs fomented, and cold cloths pressed over the heart.\r\nThis may be done for three or four nights. After this, each night for a\r\nfortnight the back should be well washed with SOAP (_see_) and hot\r\nwater, and rubbed with vinegar and hot olive oil. Let each be dried off\r\nbefore the other is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nOil, Olive.--A little oil only should be applied to the skin at once.\r\nAny such _smearing_ as dirties the clothes or bedclothes is quite\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of these papers was published, the use of oil\r\nin the \"massage\" treatment has become so widely known that methods of\r\nrubbing are better understood, and its results more appreciated. Hence\r\nit is now easier to procure pure oil, and our readers should be able to\r\nget it cheaply at any first-class grocer's.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpium.--_See_ Narcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\nOranges.--Some things regarding this useful fruit require to be noted\r\nby those using them in sickness. To eat the whole substance of an\r\norange except the outer rind is to give the digestive system some hard\r\nwork. We have known most serious stomach disturbance caused to the\r\nhealthy by doing so. Some parts of the inner rind and partitions of the\r\nfruit act almost like poison. These should always be rejected. The\r\njuice is most beneficial. It is best given to patients by squeezing the\r\norange into a glass, and _straining_ it through muslin into another\r\nglass. Add its own bulk of water and a teaspoonful of sugar, if liked.\r\nThis may be taken warm or cold, and will do where even milk and water\r\ncannot be taken. (_See_ Drinks).\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Outstrikes.\"--These appear on the skin from various causes. In the\r\ncase of infants, they often appear on the head and face during\r\nteething.\r\n\r\nAn experienced medical man is cautious in the extreme of quickly\r\nhealing the distressed skin. He is afraid of \"driving in\" the eruption\r\non the brain. Perhaps he refuses to do anything whatever to heal the\r\nhead. From what we have seen, however, even in the worst cases, when\r\nhead and face and neck were one great sore, we feel assured that there\r\nis no need why this distress should be continued at all. It may be, at\r\nleast in many cases, safely and not very slowly healed.\r\n\r\nThe _whole_ skin of the infant must be brought into vigorous and\r\nhealthy action. The head at first need not be touched; but the entire\r\nskin not affected should be sponged with warm vinegar, and then dried,\r\nrubbed with warm olive oil, and this wiped off carefully and gently, so\r\nfar as it does not adhere to the skin under the soft dry towel. Quite\r\nenough remains to do all the good required; and if more is left on, a\r\nchilliness and nastiness are felt, which prejudice many against the use\r\nof it altogether.\r\n\r\nIt is well, in many cases, not to touch the child with _water_ or\r\n_soap_. The vinegar and oil cleanse the skin and do all that is\r\nrequired. Then vinegar very much diluted should be used warm to apply\r\nwith a soft rag to the sores. Take a teaspoonful of vinegar in a\r\nbreakfastcupful of warm water. If this causes the child to cry when\r\napplied, then dilute still further. Vinegar weak enough to cause hardly\r\nany feeling when it touches the sore, will _heal_; stronger vinegar\r\nwill _injure_.\r\n\r\nWe have known a nurse try to heal an outstricken face by means of good\r\nvinegar at its full strength. She was instructed to use the vinegar\r\nvery much diluted, but fancied it would heal faster if much stronger.\r\nShe might just as well have fancied that it is better to put one's cold\r\nhands into the fire than to hold them at some distance when wishing to\r\nwarm them. The child's face was made greatly worse, of course, and the\r\ncure abandoned. It is therefore necessary to urge that a strength of\r\nacid which secures only the most gentle sensation of smarting is\r\nessential to cure. The weak vinegar is first applied to the outer and\r\nless fiery parts of the outstrike. Try to heal from this inwards, by\r\ngradual advances from day to day. On the less affected parts the weak\r\nacid may be applied twice a day; on the sorer parts only when itching\r\nis so distressing as to demand it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a child whose head, face, and neck were one distressing\r\nsore; we have taken the cloth with the diluted vinegar and daubed a\r\nsquare inch or so of the skin on which the fiery eruption was so full,\r\nand in less than two minutes we have seen the colour change into a\r\nhealthy pink, and remain that colour when the olive oil was applied.\r\nThe child's sores yielded gradually, till the whole illness was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nSometimes such eruptions, in adults as well as children, arise from\r\nsuppressed perspiration, or from the perspiration being of an acrid and\r\nirritating nature. It is sometimes apparently the result of the rubbing\r\noff of a little of the skin, or it comes on without any known accident.\r\nFor a time it seems scarcely worth noticing, and is consequently\r\nneglected; but gradually it spreads on the surface and gives\r\nuneasiness, especially after the patient has been some time in bed. It\r\ngoes on till a large portion of the skin from the knee to the ankle is\r\nreddened and roughened with a moist eruption. Now remedies of various\r\nkinds are tried, but the evil gets worse and worse. The person affected\r\nis often a struggling mother or widow, who has to keep on her feet all\r\nday in anxious toil, and neither gets very good food during the day nor\r\nproper rest during the night. Month after month goes past, and no\r\nrelief comes. The positive agony which such persons suffer is\r\nincredible to those who have not experienced anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nHere the great difficulty often is to get the patient the very chief\r\ncondition for cure--that is, perfect rest for the affected limb. If\r\nthis can in any way be secured, all else is comparatively plain\r\nsailing. But this is sometimes impossible: the children may not be in a\r\nposition to be left, or the little business cannot be allowed to die,\r\nas it would in a month's time if not attended to, or some other\r\nhindrance is in the way. We must just do the best in the circumstances.\r\nWe shall say that we are compelled to do without the rest, probably\r\nalso without certain other things. Rest is very desirable, and so is a\r\ngentle rubbing all over the body, first with warm vinegar and then with\r\nolive oil, but there is perhaps no one capable of doing such a thing\r\nwhose services can be secured. It is easy to \"order\" very useful\r\nprocesses, but among many who would not be exactly called \"poor people\"\r\nit is not easy to have the \"order\" carried out. We must often do\r\nwithout this double rubbing, and yet cure the diseased skin of the\r\nafflicted limb. Let the reader remember that it is no matter of choice\r\nthat we dispense with the rest and the rubbing. If they are possible,\r\nby all means let them be taken advantage of to the utmost.\r\n\r\nFor treatment, unless distinct running sores are formed, bathe the limb\r\nwith warm water and M'Clinton's Soap, which will remove all crusts,\r\nscabs, &c. Then apply zinc ointment. Do not bathe or poultice after the\r\nfirst time. All secretion can be removed by a piece of cotton wool\r\ndipped in warm olive oil. If deep running sores have formed, then we\r\nmust have a water-tight box of rough deal in which the whole leg up to\r\nthe knee can be bathed for an hour in hot water. We see no reason why\r\nit should cost much over a shilling to get this, and it would be a sore\r\nwant if it could not be procured. It is so made that the leg and foot\r\ncan rest easily in it while it is nearly full of hot water. It need not\r\nbe wider than just to hold the limb easily. Some good-hearted joiner\r\nwill put five small boards together so as to meet this want. We shall\r\nsuppose that it is supplied. Now for a few cloths, such as will cover\r\nthe diseased parts, about three-ply all round. Then for vinegar or\r\nacetic acid, so diluted with water that it will just cause a slight\r\nsmarting when heated and touching the affected skin. It must not be so\r\nstrong as to cause burning, nor so weak as to give no sense of its\r\npresence at all, but between these extremes. It can be tried when too\r\nweak, and vinegar or other acetic acid added till a gentle smarting is\r\nfelt. The cloths are dipped in the diluted and heated vinegar, allowed\r\nto drip till no more falls off, and then laid tenderly all round the\r\nsore. A strip of dry cloth may then be wound round so as to keep these\r\non, and the leg thus dressed placed in the bath. It should be kept\r\nthere, with now and again a gentle movement, and the strong comfortable\r\nheat of the water kept up for an hour, unless the patient should feel\r\nsickness before that time. If this comes on, the water is too hot; but,\r\ninstead of merely cooling it, the bath may cease for the time, and\r\nwater not so hot may be tried on a second occasion. Whether the hour\r\nhas been reached or not, good has been done. The leg is taken out of\r\nthe hot water and gently dried--not rubbed, but dried without rubbing.\r\nThen as much cloth as will go twice round all is dipped in warm olive\r\noil, and this is pressed out a little, so that it may not run. The\r\noiled cloth is wrapped all round the limb. Some dry cloth is also\r\nwrapped round, and the first treatment is completed. This should be\r\nrepeated every night before going to bed, for a week at least. It may\r\nbe required for a fortnight if the case is bad and no rest at all can\r\nbe had during the day. We should say the cure may fail for want of this\r\nrest, but this is not likely. In the morning as soon as convenient, the\r\ndiseased skin should be soaked with a warm vinegar cloth, so that it\r\nshall smart just a little. It should then be dressed again with the\r\nwarm olive oil. If at any time during the day or night it gets\r\nirritated and troublesome, this morning dressing may be repeated. It\r\nwill not be very long before the one leg is as good as the other. The\r\ngeneral health, too, of the patient will be sensibly improved.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to point out that a similar treatment to this\r\nwill cure \"outstrikings\" of the same sort in the arms and other parts\r\nof the body, as well as upon the legs. There is required only some such\r\nmodification of the appliances as may meet the particular case. For\r\nexample, we have seen the outstriking between the shoulders, so that it\r\ncould not be reached by bathing, unless by appliances utterly out of\r\nthe question in the circumstances. But dressing with hot vinegar\r\ncloths, allowing these to remain on for twenty minutes or so, and then\r\ndressing with warm olive oil, allowing this to remain for two or three\r\nhours, is quite possible to any one who is so affected; and this will\r\nusually be sufficient for a cure.\r\n\r\nYou have, perhaps, been cured temporarily more than once with arsenic,\r\nand the evil has returned worse and worse. In that case you may require\r\nall the more patience and the longer application of the above\r\ntreatment; but, once cured in this way, you will not, so far as a good\r\nlong experience enables us to judge, be likely to have any relapse. In\r\nvery bad cases we have seen poultices of mashed potatoes made with\r\nbuttermilk cleanse the diseased parts most effectually, and then the\r\nacid takes healing effect very speedily. In these cases ordinary\r\nmedical treatment had utterly and hopelessly failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPain, Severe, in Limbs.--This is often not due to any trouble in the\r\njoint itself, but to some disorder in the large nerves which have their\r\nroots in the lower part of the back. In the case of severe pains in the\r\nback of the leg, ankle, or knee, when a chill to the large limb nerves\r\nhas been the cause, and has raised inflammation, the patient should be\r\nput warm in bed. Take two large towels, thoroughly wrung out of cold\r\nwater. Fold one six or eight ply thick. Gently press this, avoiding\r\ncold shock to the patient, over the lower part of the back. When this\r\ntowel gets hot, spread it out to cool, and apply the other. Continue\r\nthis with each towel alternately, and when finished, or after an hour,\r\nrub the skin with warm olive oil and cover up with new flannel. Similar\r\ncold applications to the _upper_ part of the spine will cure such pains\r\nin the wrists. If the cold application intensifies or fails to relieve\r\nthe pain, it is well to try the ARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_).\r\n\r\nSometimes light pressure in the form of squeezing the muscles of the\r\nlower back is very useful. A very gentle pressure on the right parts is\r\nmost pleasant to the sufferer. At first it simply relieves in some\r\ndegree the weary feeling of the limbs. When it is at all well done, it\r\nsoon raises a gentle heat, which slowly passes down the limbs, even to\r\nthe very toes. This is just life itself communicated to the limb. But\r\nwe must not confine our treatment to the spinal cord. The squeezing, or\r\ngentle pressure, must be carried down the limb; and when new life has\r\nbeen infused so far, it will be well to apply the pressure between the\r\nhands to the swollen and painful part. _See_ Massage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalpitation.--Ordinarily we are not aware of the beating of the heart,\r\nenormous as is the work it does; but in certain cases this beating\r\nbecomes distressingly violent, especially on lying down flat or in\r\nascending hills or stairs. The latter cases are the more serious, yet\r\nboth kinds we have found quite curable. In treatment, fomentation must\r\nbe avoided, and so must doses of the nerve-damaging drug, digitalis.\r\nThe best way is to _cool the heart_, and thus relieve its superabundant\r\naction. But care must be taken that _cold be not applied to a feeble\r\nheart_, but only where action is evidently superabundant. It is usually\r\neasy to distinguish the two kinds of palpitation. The cooling can be\r\ndone by pressing towels wrung out of cold water all over the heart\r\nregion of the left side. Then rub the part so cooled with olive oil,\r\ndry off, and let the patient rest. This may be done in the morning\r\nbefore rising. In cases where the heart is feeble, the following\r\ntreatment should be carried out instead of the cold towels:--Begin at\r\nbedtime with a cloth covered with creamy soap lather, and placed quite\r\nwarm all over the body of the patient. It should be fastened on with\r\nthe body of a dress, or thin vest, so that it may be kept close to the\r\nskin during the night. In the morning the back should be gently washed\r\nwith hot vinegar, dried, and gently rubbed with warm olive oil. In\r\nthose cases where the palpitation is only part of a general\r\nnervousness, which causes great distress and sleeplessness at night,\r\nthe back should be lathered all over with soap (_see_ Lather and Soap)\r\nat bedtime, and the cloth with lather left on all night. In the\r\nmorning, dry off, rub gently with hot vinegar, and then with hot olive\r\noil. If the palpitation resists this treatment, then cold towels should\r\nbe gently pressed to the _spine_, until the whole system is quieted.\r\nThe back should then be rubbed with warm olive oil. So far as this\r\nrestless action is concerned, this is all that is required for complete\r\ncure. We are writing thus in view of cases declared hopeless, but the\r\npatients are now in perfect health. We remember one at this moment in\r\nwhich the heart's action was so bad that the head could not be raised\r\nfrom the pillow, but the person was in a few weeks as well as any one\r\ncould wish to be.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not seen how readily the surplus vital action passes out\r\nof the system when simple cold is rightly applied, can imagine how\r\neasily such cases are cured. It seems to us absurd to speak of \"heart\r\ndisease\" in many of the cases in which people talk of it and set the\r\ncase down as hopeless. It is absurd, simply because it is not heart\r\ndisease, but only a little more action than is comfortable, and which\r\nis reduced in a few minutes by a cold towel. No doubt care and\r\nwillingness to work a little are required, if one would relieve a\r\nsufferer in such a case as this, but that care and energy are sure to\r\nhave the best of all rewards.\r\n\r\nPalpitation often arises from indigestion, in which case _see_\r\nIndigestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalsy.--_See_ Paralysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis.--This serious trouble in slighter forms affects one side of\r\nthe face, or even one eye only. More serious attacks involve the arm,\r\nand even an entire half of the body. It may come suddenly, or may creep\r\nslowly over the frame. In very old persons the case is usually\r\nhopeless, as life itself is fading. In earlier life, and in less\r\nserious cases, a cure is to be expected from proper treatment. Cupping,\r\nblistering, or opiates must be avoided, as all tending to reduce vital\r\nenergy. Treatment must aim at increasing this, not reducing it. Take\r\nfirst the case of paralysis slightly affecting the face. When the\r\npatient is warm in bed, place a BRAN POULTICE (_see_) not too hot, on\r\nthe back of the head and neck. Let the patient lie on it, first rubbing\r\nthe neck and back of head with olive oil. Do this for an hour each day.\r\nAt another time wash the back of head and neck with SOAP (_see_) and\r\nwater, then with vinegar, and finally rub with hot olive oil. Keep the\r\nparts warm with good flannel always.\r\n\r\nIf the whole side be affected, foment strongly the whole spine, and\r\ntreat it in a similar way to the back of the head, as prescribed above.\r\nWe have known cases of comparatively speedy cure by this simple means.\r\nThe heat simply vitalises the partially dead nerves. For paralysis of\r\nthe lower limbs, the treatment is applied to the lower part of the\r\nspine principally, but also to the whole spinal system. There is no\r\nfear of injuring the patient in this treatment, and we know of many\r\ncases of most delightful cure secured by it. What is called the\r\nARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_) is an excellent method of dealing with\r\nparalysis of the lower limbs or any part of them, and may be resorted\r\nto if the above treatment fails. Care must be taken in any case to\r\navoid a chill after fomenting, which might make matters worse than at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerspiration.--By this term we mean not only the sensible perspiration\r\nwhich is felt as a distinct wetness on the skin during exertion or\r\nheat, or in some illnesses, but also, and chiefly, the constant\r\ninsensible perspiration. This latter is far more important than the\r\nformer. No one could live many hours without it, for by its means\r\nseveral pounds weight of waste is got rid of every day. Its importance\r\nwe saw lately in the case of a child greatly swollen in dropsy. A\r\nflannel BANDAGE (_see_) wrung out of warm water, placed round the body,\r\nreduced this swelling completely, without any _sensible_ sign of\r\nexcretion. A very gentle treatment, increasing this insensible\r\nsweating, will often cure without weakening, where violent perspiring\r\nmedicines or treatment cause great weakness. A damp flannel bandage\r\nplaced round the lower half of the body all night for a few nights will\r\nproduce a remarkable increase of insensible perspiration, and in many\r\ncase forms a good substitute for sweating drugs. Along with this the\r\nsoapy lather may be used at bedtime all over the skin (_see_ Lather and\r\nSoap). We have seen a swelling of the hand, which made a medical man\r\ntalk of amputation, cured by these means. Acetic acid, or white-wine\r\nvinegar, rubbed over the skin, produces a similar increase of\r\ninsensible perspiration, and may be used without fear of injury. This\r\ndone once a week will go far to reduce sensitiveness to cold. Indeed,\r\nthe use of M'Clinton's soap and water, along with good acetic acid\r\nsponging once a week, will prevent many serious ills by securing a\r\nconstant gentle excretion of hurtful waste through the stimulated skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiles.--This very common trouble is caused by one or more of the veins\r\nin the lower bowel losing their elasticity, so as to protrude more or\r\nless from the anus, especially when the stress of a motion of the\r\nbowels forces them out. When no blood proceeds from this swollen vein,\r\nit is sometimes called a _blind_ pile. If blood comes, it is called a\r\n_bleeding_ one.\r\n\r\nThere are few illnesses more prevalent than this, few that seem to be\r\nless rationally dealt with, and yet few that are more easily cured.\r\n\r\nIt is distressing to think of what some poor people have to suffer from\r\nthis disease, while they are still compelled to go on working, and even\r\nwalking, in the most depressing sufferings. It is still more\r\ndistressing to think of the painful operations which some have to\r\nundergo in having the relaxed portions of these veins cut out. Even\r\nwhen the piles have got to a very advanced stage it is not difficult to\r\ncure. It will generally be found that there is Constipation (_see_), so\r\nfirst of all, the bowels must be regulated. This may be done by means\r\nof liquorice and senna mixture, and strict attention to diet and\r\nexercise. Then the nerve action in the lower back is to be stimulated\r\nby applying to the back below the waist a large BRAN POULTICE (_see_).\r\nRub the back after this with hot vinegar, dry, rub with olive oil, and\r\nwipe off the oil gently. Do this at bedtime. Into the bowels may be\r\ninjected (with the fountain enema) first one or two injections of warm\r\nwater; then an injection of warm water and white-wine vinegar. Be\r\nparticular to have this mixture not too strong. A trial may be made\r\nwith one tablespoonful of vinegar to a pint of water. If any pain is\r\ncaused, inject simple lukewarm water and use the vinegar and water next\r\ntime weaker. A very weak mixture has a wonderfully healing effect.\r\nAfter one pint of this mixture has been injected, an injection of cool\r\nwater (but not cold) should follow. The vinegar should be so weak that\r\nit will cause no pain, properly speaking,--only just the slightest\r\nsensation of smarting. It will be possible to use the water colder and\r\nthe vinegar stronger as you get on with the cure, but in both, your own\r\nfeelings and good sense will guide you. This direction will suit other\r\ncases of internal syringing, in which membranes have got relaxed, and\r\nneed to be braced with cold and weak acid. In all such troubles it\r\nshould be remembered that the warm or tepid water is used at first only\r\nbecause the cold might be felt uncomfortable till the surfaces are\r\nprepared for it. It is the cold that does the good. After this,\r\nprotruding piles may be gently manipulated by the fingers and pushed\r\nback into their place. During this the patient must press outwards, as\r\nif to discharge fæces from the bowel. The anus will then open and\r\npermit of the piles being pressed in. The injecting treatment may be\r\ngiven twice a day. If too painful, even bathing the parts with the\r\nvinegar and cold water has great healing power.\r\n\r\nLet the sufferer, if at all possible, have _entire rest_ for a\r\nfortnight during the treatment, and lie down as much as convenient.\r\n\r\nIn mild cases, simply bathe the piles with cold water and press them\r\nback into their places. A daily wash of the anus with SOAP (_see_) and\r\nwarm water, followed by a cold sponging, will do much to prevent piles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPimples on the Face.--_See_ Face.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleurisy.--The pleura is the tender double web, or membrane, which\r\nlines the inside of the chest on the one side and covers the lung, or\r\nrather encloses the lung with its other fold. Each of the two lungs has\r\nits pleura in which it works, and each side of the chest is lined by\r\none side of this sensitive organ. The slender lining passes round the\r\ngreater part of one whole side of the body with one-fold, and round the\r\nwhole of the lung with the other. Let us suppose (which often takes\r\nplace) that the front of the body is defended with what is called a\r\n\"chest protector,\" but the sides and back are exposed to a chilling\r\natmosphere. Part of the pleura, and that part which is farthest from\r\nthe surface, is sheltered, but the greater part of it, and that nearest\r\nthe surface, has no such protection. In the case especially of women\r\nthis is the state of things. It seems as if people thought that they\r\nonly need to keep a few inches of the breast warm--that is keeping the\r\nchest all right--though the sides just under the arms, and the back\r\nunder the shoulder-blades, are of far greater importance. The throat is\r\neven muffled, and a \"respirator\" worn, so that fresh air is not allowed\r\nto get inside the lungs, while the pleura is exposed to chill at the\r\nback. The consequence of this is that vital action is so abstracted\r\nfrom the pleura that the tension of its small vessels is relaxed, and\r\nblood is admitted as it is not intended it should be.\r\n\r\nSevere pain is felt on one or both sides, and round under the\r\nshoulder-blade. A painful cough arises, and great fever is produced. In\r\nsuch a case the treatment is on the same principle as that given in\r\nLungs, Inflammation of the, which should be read. The inflamed part\r\nmust be cooled by applying towels well wrung out of cold water round\r\nthe side, applying a fresh one when that on the part becomes warm. If\r\nthe pain does not leave in half-an-hour of this treatment, or if the\r\npatient be weak to begin with, or if any chilliness is felt, pack the\r\nfeet and legs in a large hot fomentation. The cooling of the side may\r\nthen go on safely until a curative effect is produced. We may not be\r\nable to give the theory of action of this treatment, but we know that\r\nin many cases it has perfectly and very speedily been successful, and\r\nthat it leaves no bad results, as blistering and drugging are apt to\r\ndo. We know of one case in which it took twenty-four hours' constant\r\ntreatment to effect a cure. But it did effect it. Two friends took\r\n\"shifts,\" and saw that all was thoroughly done. This will give an idea\r\nof the proper way to go about the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisoning.--The following are the antidotes and remedies for some of\r\nthe more common forms of poisoning.\r\n\r\nAlcohol.--The patient is quite helpless, and there is usually a strong\r\nsmell of alcohol. If the patient is intoxicated at the time give an\r\nemetic. If there is evident prostration from a long bout, keep him\r\nquiet and warm. Hot tea not too strong may be given.\r\n\r\nAlkalis (_e.g._, ammonia, soda or potash).--Give dilute vinegar,\r\nfollowed by white of egg.\r\n\r\nArsenic.--Emetic, followed by white of egg. Keep very warm.\r\n\r\nCarbolic.--Readily identified by smell of tar or carbolic. Wash mouth\r\nwell with oil. Give an emetic.\r\n\r\nChloral.--Emetic; warm coffee, and even an enema of coffee. Artificial\r\nrespiration (_see_ Drowning) may be necessary if breathing gets very\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nChloroform or Ether (inhaled).--Fresh air. Pull tongue forward, and\r\nbegin artificial respiration. If heart has stopped, strike chest two or\r\nthree times over region of heart.\r\n\r\nChloroform or Ether (swallowed).--Emetic; enema of hot coffee; keep\r\nawake. If necessary, artificial respiration.\r\n\r\nCopper.--Emetic, white of egg to follow.\r\n\r\nLaudanum.--There is intense drowsiness and contraction of pupils of\r\neye. Give an emetic and plenty of strong coffee. Walk patient up and\r\ndown. On no account allow him to give way to the desire for sleep.\r\n\r\nMineral Acids and Glacial Acetic.--If any neutralising agent, such,\r\n_e.g._, as lime, chalk, soda, or calcined magnesia, is at hand, give it\r\nat once. Or give an emetic, followed by oil or milk and water.\r\n\r\nMushrooms.--Emetic; castor oil and enema.\r\n\r\nNicotine (tobacco).--Emetic; stimulate and keep warm; keep patient\r\nlying down.\r\n\r\nOxalic Acid.--Neutralise by chalk or lime water, but not by soda or any\r\nalkali. Give plenty of water; apply hot fomentations to loins.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus.--Often caused by children sucking matches. There is a\r\nburning in the throat, and often vomiting. Give an emetic. After this\r\nsome barley water or milk may be given.\r\n\r\nPrussic Acid.--Almost hopeless. Emetic; artificial respiration.\r\n\r\nSnake Bite.--Suck the wound, and apply a drop or two of strong ammonia\r\nto the bite. Ammonia may be also inhaled. Artificial respiration often\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nStrychnine.--Emetic; keep quiet and darken the room. Chloral or bromide\r\nof potassium may be given. If spasms threaten respiration, artificial\r\nrespiration is necessary.\r\n\r\nTartar Emetic or other Antimonial Poisons.--If vomiting is not present,\r\ninduce it by an emetic. Give doses of strong tea. Keep very warm by hot\r\nblankets.\r\n\r\nGood domestic emetics are a teaspoonful of mustard in a tumblerful of\r\nwater, or a tablespoonful of salt in the same quantity of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisoning, Blood.--Where this arises from a more or less putrid wound,\r\nwhat is aimed at in the treatment is to stop the manufacture of the\r\npoison in the wound by cleansing and healing it. This done, the other\r\nsymptoms will subside. The wound should be carefully brushed with a\r\ncamel's-hair brush and vinegar or dilute ACETIC ACID (_see_). This\r\nshould be followed up with a poultice of boiled potatoes or turnips,\r\nbeaten up with the same weak acid. Leave this on all night. Brush again\r\nwell with the acid in the morning. In the matter of diet eat what will\r\nproduce healthy blood, and by open-air exercise seek the same end. But\r\nthe daily brushing and poulticing, or even twice daily if necessary,\r\nwill work wonders on the poisoned wound. Care should be taken where any\r\ncut or wound has been made in the flesh, that it is carefully washed,\r\nand any dirt or foreign matter removed. Especially is this to be\r\nattended to if a rusty nail or penknife has inflicted the injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolypus.--_See_ Nostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato Poultice.--Potatoes boiled and beaten up with buttermilk, spread\r\nout in the usual way, make this useful poultice. Weak acid or vinegar\r\nmay also be used instead of buttermilk. The potatoes should be boiled\r\nas recommended below.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotato, The.--The proper cooking of this root is so important for\r\nhealth, owing to its universal use, that we here give directions which,\r\nif followed out, make potatoes a dish acceptable to even a very\r\ndelicate stomach. Difficulty of digestion often arises from the\r\npotatoes not ripening properly, especially in cold soil, and since\r\ndisease has become so widespread. Their unripe juice is positively\r\npoisonous, and when they are merely boiled is not completely expelled.\r\nThe potatoes should be _steeped_ in warm water for an hour before they\r\nare boiled. The water in which they have been steeped will be greenish\r\nwith bad juice, and must be thrown away, and the roots boiled in fresh\r\nwater as usual, giving a thorough _drying_ after the boiling water is\r\npoured or strained off. So prepared, the potatoes make a very\r\ndigestible dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoultice, Bran.--_See_ Bran Poultice.\r\n\r\n\r\nProstration, Nervous.--The various articles under Nerves and\r\nNervousness should be read. Here we give simply the treatment for\r\nfailure in the digestion and bowel action. This arises from failure in\r\nthe great nerve centres near the middle of the body. External treatment\r\nmay be given as follows:--Dip a cotton cloth, four-ply thick, and large\r\nenough to cover the stomach and bowels, into cayenne Lotion (_see_),\r\nand lightly wring it. Lay this gently over the stomach and bowels. Over\r\nthis an india-rubber bag of hot water is laid. Take care that the heat\r\nis not _too great_ or the mixture _too strong_. All must be just hot\r\nenough to be comfortable. This application may remain on for two hours,\r\nand then be repeated. The cayenne is greatly to be preferred to mustard\r\nfor many reasons. Give the most easily assimilated food possible. A\r\nteaspoonful of gruel each half-hour, increased to a dessertspoonful, if\r\nthe digestion will bear it, and preceded in all cases by a\r\ntablespoonful of hot water. This should be continued for twenty-four\r\nhours. Proceed very cautiously then to increase the nourishment, on the\r\nlines of Assimilation, Diet, Digestion, etc., giving oatmeal jelly,\r\nwheaten porridge, Saltcoats biscuits, and such diet, _gradually_\r\nbringing the patient back to ordinary food.\r\n\r\n\r\nPulse, Counting the.--Most valuable information as to the nature and\r\nprogress of disease is derivable from the pulse. Every one should learn\r\nto count it, and to distinguish the broad differences in the rapidity\r\nand nature of the beat. Such a distinction as that between BRONCHITIS\r\nand ASTHMA (_see these articles_), which require almost directly\r\nopposite treatment, is at once discerned from the pulse. In bronchitis\r\nit beats much too quickly, in asthma it is natural or too slow. In many\r\ncases we have seen asthma, which in cough and spit is very like\r\nbronchitis, treated as bronchitis, with bad results. These would all\r\nhave been avoided if the pulse had been intelligently counted. Count\r\nthe pulse, if at all possible, for _half-a-minute_. This multiplied by\r\ntwo will give the rate per minute, by which it is judged. If this rate\r\nper minute be above 100, there is a good deal of feverish or\r\ninflammatory action somewhere. If below 60, there is considerable lack\r\nof vital power, requiring rest and food to restore it.\r\n\r\nIn adults the rate for males is from 70 to 75 beats per minute, and for\r\nfemales 75 to 80. In infants the healthy pulse may be at birth 130 to\r\n140 per minute, diminishing with increase of age. In the case of any\r\nchild under five and over one year, if the pulse beats, say, 108 in the\r\nminute, it is too fast. The pulse of an adult may go down as low as 60\r\nor even 50 per minute, but there is then something wrong.\r\n\r\nCooling the head is always safe with high pulse and feverishness, and\r\noften this alone will ward off disease and restore the healthy\r\ncondition. If the pulse be low, fomentations to the feet should be\r\napplied, along with cooling action elsewhere, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurple Spots on Skin.--These arise first as small swellings. The\r\nswellings fall, and leave purple patches behind, which, if the trouble\r\ncontinues, become so numerous as to spoil the appearance of the skin.\r\nThis especially occurs in children or young people, whose skin is\r\nexceptionally delicate. What has occurred is really much the same as\r\nthe result of a blow or pinch, leaving the skin \"black and blue.\" Some\r\nof the delicate vessels in the skin have given way, and dark blood\r\ncollects on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is to sponge all over the body and limbs with warm\r\nCAYENNE \"TEA\" (_see_), only strong enough to cause a slight smarting.\r\nIt should never cause pain. If it does so, the tea is too strong, and\r\nshould be diluted with warm water. The soapy LATHER (_see_) may also be\r\nused, and olive oil may with advantage be rubbed on as well. Milk and\r\nboiling water should be given to the patient every two hours during the\r\nday, with a few drops of the cayenne \"tea\" in it. This is a true\r\nstimulant, and worth all the whiskey in the world. The object of the\r\ntreatment is to nurse the patient's strength, and stimulate the skin.\r\nAn intelligent study of many articles in this book will guide the\r\nthoughtful how to act.\r\n\r\n\r\nRacks from Lifting.--_See_ Muscular Pains; Sprains.\r\n\r\n\r\nRash, or Hives.--Infants are often troubled with large red,\r\nangry-looking spots, breaking out over the body, and causing trouble by\r\ntheir heat and itching. These are commonly known as hives. If the water\r\nin which a child is washed be hard, it will sometimes cause the skin to\r\ninflame and become \"hivey.\" If the soap has much soda in it, it will\r\nalso cause this. What is called glycerine soap, and much of what is\r\nsold as peculiarly desirable, is utterly unsuitable for an infant's\r\nskin. Soda soap will cause serious outbreaks even worse than \"hives,\"\r\nand will often not be suspected at all, as a cause.\r\n\r\nOnly M'Clinton's soap, which is made from the ash of plants, should be\r\nused on tender skins.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"hives\" are not very troublesome, they are apt to be\r\nneglected; but this should not be, as in most cases this is the time\r\nthey may be easily cured. The true element in cure is found in\r\nattention to the _skin_, as distinct from the stomach or blood.\r\nM'Clinton's soap (_see_ Soap) applied as fine creamy lather will _cure_\r\nhives, and will never, we think, fail to do so. We know of a nurse\r\nplastering an infant's body with this soap, so that it was blistered.\r\nThis is a totally wrong way of working. The right way is to work the\r\nsoap and hot water as described in article Lather, and to apply it\r\ngently with the brush to the parts affected. After applying it with\r\ngentle rubbing for some time, and leaving some on the sore places, the\r\ninfant will usually be soothed to sleep. Where over-cooling is feared,\r\nwith a weak child, a little olive oil is gently rubbed on with the\r\nsecond coat of lather. In any case of itchiness the above treatment is\r\nalmost certain to cure. Often the infant is suffering from too rich\r\ndiet. (_See_ Children's Food.) In such cases, thinner milk, and a\r\nlittle fluid magnesia administered internally will effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemedy, Finding a.--It will sometimes occur, in the case of those\r\nendeavouring to cure on our system of treatment, that on applying what\r\nis thought to be the correct remedy, the trouble becomes worse. For\r\nexample, where there are violent pains in the legs, a bran poultice is\r\nput on the lower back, and it is rubbed with oil. The pains become\r\nworse instead of better, and perhaps our whole system is abandoned and\r\ncondemned. Now, all that is required here is to think and try until we\r\nfind the _true_ remedy. If the pain in the legs is rheumatic, the hot\r\npoultice is all right. If it has been cramp, what is needed is a cold\r\ncloth on the lower back, instead of heat. In the example above given,\r\nwhat is needed is not to abandon the treatment, but to rectify the\r\nmistake, and apply cold instead of heat. In a great many forms of\r\nillness the same principle holds good. It is safer, where there is any\r\ndoubt, to try heat first, but not in a very strong manner. If this\r\ngentle heating makes matters worse, gentle cooling may be tried. If the\r\nheat does good, it may be continued and increased, but never beyond the\r\npoint of comfort. If the cold does good, it also may be continued on\r\nthe same principle. What the patient feels relieving and comforting, is\r\nalmost sure to be the cure for his trouble, if persisted in. _See_\r\nChanging Treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRest.--In every person there is a certain amount only of force which is\r\navailable for living. Also this force, or _vitality_, is _produced_ at\r\nonly a certain definite rate. Where the rate is very low, only perfect\r\nquiet in bed for a time can bring down the expenditure far enough to\r\nenable the vital force gradually to accumulate, and a cure to be\r\neffected. Sitting, in such cases, may be serious overwork.\r\n\r\nWhen rest is ordered, we are often met by the reply that it is\r\nimpossible, as work cannot be given up. It is, however, often possible\r\nto get a great deal more than is taken. Every spare moment should be\r\nspent lying down in the most restful position. It is an important\r\nelement in nursing to give such a comfortable recumbent position to a\r\npatient as constitutes perfect rest, and the nurse who does so, does a\r\ngreat deal to cure.\r\n\r\nThere is with many a prejudice against rest. It is somehow believed\r\nthat it is a weakening thing to lie still in bed. \"You must get up and\r\ntake exercise, and enjoy the fresh air.\" This is a very good order for\r\na person who has the strength for bracing exercise and fresh air. But\r\nthis is absent in a person truly ill. That person's vital force is low,\r\nand the organs that supply it are feeble in their action. The fresh air\r\nmay enter the chest, but the lungs are not in a state to make good use\r\nof it. \"Exercise and fresh air\" only consume the sufferer. On the\r\ncontrary, rest and fresh air allow the weak vital force to recruit. The\r\nsort of exercise which is wanted in such cases is given by others in\r\nmassaging or such squeezing the muscles as stimulates the organic\r\nnerves without using vital force in the sufferer. We have repeatedly\r\nsucceeded in giving new strength by some weeks in bed, when it could\r\nnot have been given otherwise. It is all very well for a young, strong\r\nperson, only a very little out of sorts, to take a cold sitz-bath for\r\nten minutes, and then a walk of a mile or two in mountain or seashore\r\nair. But this treatment would be death to one really ill. Perfect rest\r\nin bed, with an abundant supply of air through windows open night and\r\nday, would save the life which such \"exercise and air\" would send out\r\nof the world. It requires only a little common sense to see this. \"He\r\nmust be weakened by lying in bed so long.\" There is no such \"must\" in\r\nthe nature of things. On the contrary, it may be absolutely necessary\r\nto his getting strength that he should lie still for weeks on end. You\r\nmay, no doubt, give us instances in which a person was compelled to get\r\nup, and was thereby made to lose the delusion that he was not able to\r\ndo so; but such instances in any number will not make one strong who is\r\nactually weak. Make sure first that vital energy is supplied, and when\r\nthat supply rises to a certain degree it will not be easy to keep your\r\npatient in bed.\r\n\r\nWe would also note that true rest can never be had in a forced\r\nposition. A limb bound down is not resting. The agonising desire to\r\nchange its position shows this. True rest is found always in _freedom_\r\nand _ease_. It may be necessary to put splints on a limb, but it must\r\nnever be done where rest is aimed at. Usually there is a position of\r\ncomfort to be found. Let the patient find and keep that. He will then\r\nhave rest.\r\n\r\nFor instance, an exhausted patient is lying at full length in bed, but\r\nunder the waist there is a hollow which is bridged over by the back.\r\nThis part of the back calls for a considerable amount of force to hold\r\nit over this hollow, but we get a pillow inserted under the back, the\r\nmuscles relax, and the patient rests. In packing and fomenting an\r\ninflamed knee, for example, it is usually better done in a slightly\r\n_bent_ position, which is more restful than a straight one. Employ two\r\nor three small pillows to prop it comfortably. And so on, in multitudes\r\nof cases, the earnest healer will be guided by the patient's own\r\nrestful feelings. _See also_ Noise; Veins.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestlessness.--In slight cases, where the patient simply cannot sleep\r\nfor tossing about in bed, a cold towel placed along the spine, with a\r\ndry one above, will usually relieve, especially if changed and cooled\r\nseveral times as it grows warm. If heat be specially in the head, then\r\nthat may be cooled in the same manner till peace settles down in the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nBut we must go on to consider those cases of restlessness in which\r\nthere is no extra heat in either spine or brain. Tea may have been\r\ntaken in a rather strong infusion, or so late that its peculiar\r\ninfluence may be the cause of the restlessness. It is necessary to\r\navoid this beverage if such restlessness is to be escaped; still it\r\nwill generally be found that in cases in which tea has caused serious\r\nwakefulness and restless tossing, that there is more than the mere\r\neffect of the herb, and that superabundant heat is present also; then\r\nthe application already pointed out will give relief.\r\n\r\nNow take an instance in which it seems to be the mind that causes the\r\ntossing rather than the body. Preachers after earnest preaching are in\r\nmany cases sleepless and restless too; so are almost all persons when\r\ncurrents of exciting thoughts have been set agoing in their minds.\r\nThen, no doubt, it is necessary to get at relief from the spiritual\r\nside, by means of thought fitted to calm down the excitement that has\r\nbeen raised. But it is never well to forget that in all such cases\r\nthere is a material as well as a spiritual aspect of the experience.\r\nMany preachers take a sitz-bath before going to bed after a day of\r\nservice, and find that somehow when sitting in the cool water the\r\nover-driven brain begins to slacken pace. If from any cause you are\r\nrestless and cannot lie still, even after the head and spine have been\r\ncooled as we have described, it is well to take a sitz-bath in cold\r\nwater for a few minutes. Dry and wrap up well, and you will be quiet\r\nafter. Certain forms of coughing apparently cause the most serious\r\nrestlessness. A warm poultice should be placed between the shoulders,\r\nand cold cloths pressed gently on the breast.\r\n\r\nIf there is extreme shrinking from everything in the least degree cold,\r\nthen you need to go a step back in your treatment. A sponging of the\r\nmost gentle kind, with CAYENNE LOTION (_see_) and water, all over the\r\nbody, given very carefully for three or four days, once a day, will put\r\naway the shrinking to which we refer. This should be done with tepid\r\nwater at first, but as the skin freshens it will be found comfortable\r\nto do it with cool water. In tender cases the poultice or hot bag will\r\nneed to be comfortably warm, and not hot. The cool cloth must not be\r\nwintry cold, nor even at first summer cold. It is, however, necessary\r\nto get at the hot and irritating surfaces that are causing the cough,\r\nwith more or less that is cooling. We may do this ever so gradually,\r\nbut we must do it, if we would succeed in giving rest from the cough.\r\nIn a strong person's case there is really no difficulty. It is an easy\r\nmatter to put on cloth after cloth till the irritated part is reached\r\nand cooled. But when the patient is spent to all but a skeleton, and\r\nhas restlessness from frequent coughing, it is a very different matter.\r\nStill to the very last the irritating heat may be kept down, and long\r\nsleeps given, when otherwise it would be hard work indeed to get\r\nthrough the last stages of illness. We write thus because we know it is\r\npossible to give precious relief even when it is out of the question to\r\nsave life. It is possible to make even the last night on earth\r\ncomparatively a peaceful one, instead of its being so very restless as\r\nit often is. This is to be done just by cooling the parts that\r\nirritate, and these only. Generally, heat may be required rather than\r\ncold, but at the part which is irritating and keeping up the coughing,\r\nthere must be cooling. The kind and capable nurse who can carry out\r\nthis cooling is beyond all price. Those only can understand this who\r\nhave been delivered from an all but incessant cough by means that\r\nproduce no reaction. It is also well to remember that we now and again\r\ngive life by means of rest when we had no idea of giving more than\r\ntemporary comfort. We have repeatedly had cases in which there seemed\r\nno hope of doing anything further than giving relief, but that relief\r\nhas turned out to be the commencement of cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nRheumatic Fever.--_See_ Fever, Rheumatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nRheumatism.--We feel urged, in first considering this sore and very\r\ncommon trouble, to quote the old adage that \"prevention is better than\r\ncure.\" Many people laugh at wettings, and some foolish young ones even\r\nseek exposure. We would impress upon all such that the effects of\r\nexposure may be, and often are, cumulative: that is, you may escape any\r\ndirect effect for years, and then find your recklessness end in\r\nrheumatism for the rest of your life. Let care, then, be taken to avoid\r\nwettings, unless these lie in the way of duty. Change clothes as\r\nspeedily as possible when they are wet, and encourage the skin to all\r\nhealthy action by proper care and exercise. Even with the skin all\r\nright, a wise man will not act in a foolhardy way, but if he must get\r\nwet and chilled, he will probably not suffer very much.\r\n\r\nWe would strongly recommend the use of Kneipp linen underclothing\r\n(_see_ Underwear). It powerfully stimulates the skin, and, by\r\nconducting away the perspiration, prevents chills. We have known many\r\nwho suffered severely from rheumatism being quite cured by the use of\r\nthis material. It is as comfortable as it is hygienic.\r\n\r\nBut supposing the rheumatism does come on, it may be treated, in mild\r\ncases, by gradual and steady moist heating. For the method of applying\r\nthis, _see_ Fomentation and Armchair Fomentation. If the case is\r\ncomparatively a fresh one, there will be need for no more than this\r\nfomenting, repeated several times at intervals of two to four hours.\r\n\r\nWhere the nervous system has been seriously affected, the fomentation\r\nmust be gradual, and the moist heat gently insinuated into the parts\r\naffected. Where narcotics have been used, these _must_ be given up if a\r\ncure is to be hoped for.\r\n\r\nIn certain chronic cases, which are very largely nervous in their\r\norigin, a powerful soothing influence is required. This is secured by\r\nthe use of soap lather (_see_ Lather; Soap). Cover the back and head,\r\npiece by piece, with this, rubbing it on and off four or five times.\r\nCover the fifth application with a soft cloth, and leave it on for the\r\nday in the morning, and for the night in the evening, the patient being\r\nin bed. Hot olive oil or occasionally cold drawn oil of mustard is\r\ngently rubbed on the stiff parts; when this cloth is removed, gently\r\nknead or squeeze the oil into the muscles. If during the lathering the\r\npatient feels too cold, a little olive oil should be mixed with the\r\nlather. A change to a dry climate from a damp one sometimes does a\r\npatient good, but when that is not possible, great relief, and in many\r\ncases cure, is to be had by this treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRingworm.--This distressing and most infectious trouble is due to a\r\nsmall parasite. Where that settles in the skin, a reddish _ring_ soon\r\nappears, and gradually widens, leaving a leprous white patch of skin\r\nwithin it. Care should be taken at once to cure this, as, if it spreads\r\nwidely, serious results follow. Fortunately it is slow in growth, and\r\ncan easily be checked and cured. The method of cure is to soak the\r\nrings well with vinegar or weak acetic acid. Of strong acid use three\r\ntablespoonfuls to a quart of water. By even the first good soaking with\r\nthis, the developed parasites are killed, but the eggs are not. These\r\nhatch out by degrees, so that renewed soaking and \"dabbing\" with the\r\nacid and a soft cloth are required. Each application may be continued\r\nfor fifteen minutes. If the hair, as on the head, interferes, it may be\r\ncut closely, but need not be shaved. In a bad case the daily soaking\r\nwith acid may not be sufficient. Then a poultice of potatoes and\r\nbuttermilk (_see_ Buttermilk Poultice) may be applied first, and\r\nafterwards the weak acid. Secure that there be felt, before the close\r\nof each application, a _slight smarting_, to show that the acid has\r\nreally soaked in. It is not difficult to guard against its spreading in\r\na family or school. All that need be done is, once a week or so, to see\r\nthat the whole skin of those exposed to infection, head included, is\r\nfreshened by a wash all over with vinegar, and then protected with a\r\ngentle rub of olive oil. If this is done we should have little fear of\r\ncontagion. Such a weekly freshening would ward off other evils as well\r\nas this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nRose.--_See_ Erysipelas.\r\n\r\n\r\nRupture.--The abdomen is formed of a series of _rings_ containing the\r\nbowels, and holding them in proper position. If the muscles and tissues\r\nholding these rings _yield_ so as to permit them to separate a little,\r\nwhat is called \"rupture\" takes place. It may be caused by violent\r\nmuscular efforts, heavy weight lifting, jumping from a height, etc.,\r\netc. The rings are not broken, but only displaced, and especially with\r\nyoung persons, the \"rupture\" can soon be brought all right, but even\r\nwith the aged, in all cases it may be mitigated, if not cured, by\r\nproper treatment.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is to replace any part of the bowels which may have\r\nescaped through the opening of the rings. Lay the patient flat on his\r\nback. He must not be treated in any other attitude. Then rub the\r\nswelling gently _downwards_. It _must not_ be rubbed upwards, or it\r\nwill be made worse. This rubbing will soon bring the bowel into its\r\nproper place. Give some time and kindly care to this treatment, which\r\nis very important. Then get a surgical instrument maker to fit a proper\r\ntruss. See that this really fits. If it hurts in any way when first put\r\non, it does not fit well enough. Avoid for a considerable time any\r\neffort likely to strain the part. Take light and easily digested food;\r\ngive up all alcoholic drinks and the use of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaliva.--_See_ Digestion; Nourishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaltrome.--The disease known by this name in Canada breaks out in the\r\nhands, especially on the palms. The skin cracks open and refuses to\r\nheal up. Sometimes, if the hands do heal, the trouble comes out on\r\nother parts. It is probably due to the long-continued use of bad and\r\nstrongly irritating soap in washing the hands and face, conjoined, in\r\nCanada, with the great dryness of the air.\r\n\r\nThe treatment for prevention is the regular use of M'Clinton's soap\r\n(_see_ Soap). Where the trouble has developed, the hands and face, if\r\ninvolved, should be packed in cloths soaked in buttermilk. Then over\r\nthe packing we should foment with large hot flannel cloths (_see_\r\nFomentation). Renew, if necessary, the buttermilk packing, and after a\r\nthorough fomenting, leave the buttermilk cloths on all night, with dry\r\nones on top. Then gently anoint with OLIVE OIL (_see_). This treatment,\r\nwith some rest and the use of the above-mentioned soap, should soon\r\neffect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSantolina.--This plant is the _Chama Cyparissos_, or ground cypress. It\r\nis of the greatest value as a remedy for worms in the bowels (not\r\ntapeworm), and also acts as a stomach tonic of no small value. It is\r\ncut at the end of the season, made up in small bunches of six stalks or\r\nso, and hung up to dry. When required for worms, boil one of these\r\nbunches in three teacupfuls of water until it is reduced to two\r\nteacupfuls. Half-a-teacupful of this is given to a _child_ with worms,\r\neach morning before any food, for four days. In the evening of the\r\nfourth day an ordinary dose of liquorice powder is given to move the\r\nbowels. For a _grown-up person_ the quantity is a full teacupful each\r\nmorning. If a child picks at his nostrils, or grinds his teeth while\r\nsleeping, the santolina will cure him, even if no other symptom of\r\nworms is noticed. It may with advantage be used in all cases where\r\nthere is indication of the failure of the mucous membrane of the\r\nstomach and bowels.\r\n\r\nWhere required as a stomach tonic, santolina should be infused with\r\nboiling water, as tea is. About half-an-ounce of the dried herb is\r\ninfused, and a small teacupful taken as hot as can easily be drunk\r\nabout an hour after each meal. Half the quantity will do for young\r\npeople under fourteen. Do this six days in succession. Then take none\r\nfor six days. Then again take it for three days. This treatment may be\r\nrepeated after a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nSciatica.--This is a severe pain in the lower back, shooting sharply\r\ndown the back and calf of the leg. It arises from inflammation of the\r\nlarge nerve which supplies these parts of the leg with power. Most\r\ncommonly it is caused by exposure of the hips or lower back to cold and\r\ndamp, as by sitting on the grass or a stone seat.\r\n\r\nThe cure for it, in the earlier stages, is the application of the\r\nARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_). This may be applied for an hour, and\r\nrenewed immediately for another hour if the patient can stand it, and\r\nthen rest given for two hours, and the fomentation applied for two\r\nhours again, or at least for one, taking care to rub with oil and wrap\r\nup in comfortable flannels between and after the treatment. This may be\r\ndone again on the second day. The fomentation may then be given once a\r\nday until the pain is removed.\r\n\r\nBe quite sure that no trifling application will succeed with such a\r\ndisease as this. It will not do to use less heat than will go through\r\nand through the haunches of the patient; and that amount of heat is not\r\nvery small. You must have a good soft blanket if possible, your water\r\nmust be boiling hot, and you must have plenty of it.\r\n\r\nIf the hot treatment causes increase of pain, this indicates that a\r\nstage has arrived in which _cold_ is to be applied instead of heat to\r\nthe lower back, to subdue nerve irritation. Before or after this stage,\r\ncold application will do harm, so it is well always to try heat first,\r\nas in the great majority of cases that is what is required. When cold\r\nis applied, the patient _must be warm_, and if necessary the feet and\r\nlegs should be fomented.\r\n\r\nTo keep what is got either by the soothing influence of cold or by the\r\nstimulating power of heat, it is good to rub with hot olive oil, and to\r\ndry this off well in finishing, and also to wear a good broad band of\r\nnew flannel round the lower part of the body. This band ought not to be\r\nso tight as to confine the perspiration. _See_ Changing Treatment;\r\nRemedy, Finding a.\r\n\r\n\r\nScrofula.--The treatment under Glands, Swollen, should be followed. But\r\nbesides, the whole membranous system of the glands must be stimulated.\r\nDaily rubbing briskly over the whole body with the cold-drawn oil of\r\nmustard for a quarter-of-an-hour will have this effect, and even by\r\nitself may cure.\r\n\r\nGood, easily digested food must be taken (_see_ Abscess; Assimilation;\r\nDiet; Nourishment), and overwork avoided. Continued work, as with a\r\nchild at school, may quite prevent a cure, while if the work ceases,\r\nthe cure will be rapid. It is better to have health and holidays than\r\nsickness and school. Where there is a family tendency to scrofula, care\r\nshould be taken to treat promptly any case of glandular swelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nScurvy.--Is a disease springing from disordered digestion, and caused\r\nsometimes by partial starvation, but more frequently by a deficiency of\r\nvegetable acid in the food. It often manifests itself in skin\r\neruptions, the skin peeling off in scales. To ward off or cure this\r\ndisease, fresh food should always be used, and salted or tinned foods\r\navoided. Especially should abundance of green vegetables and fruit be\r\nused, and where such cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity, lemon\r\njuice is valuable. Too much exposure, fatigue, and impure air, aided by\r\na wrong diet, are the causes that formerly made scurvy so prevalent in\r\nthe navy. It has almost disappeared since a regular allowance of\r\nvegetable acid has been served out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeamill Sanatorium and Hydropathic.--Very soon after the appearance of\r\nthese \"Papers on Health,\" the need was felt for some establishment\r\nwhere the treatment expounded here could be given by trained attendants\r\nunder Dr. Kirk's personal supervision. The site was fixed on the\r\nAyrshire coast, in the parish of West Kilbride. This region was chosen\r\nbecause special advantages of soil, climate, and scenery recommended\r\nit. The soil along the shore is almost pure sand, and dries rapidly\r\nafter rain. The climate is extremely mild, high hills sheltering the\r\nwhole region from north and east winds, and the Arran mountains,\r\nintervening some sixteen miles over the sea to the west, collect much\r\nof the rain. Hence, although near some very rainy districts, the\r\nSeamill neighbourhood is peculiarly sunny and dry. In winter the sun\r\nreflected from the water, and beating on the face of the hills, makes\r\nthe shore climate most genial, and when other places only a few miles\r\naway are encased in ice, flowers will be blooming in the gardens at\r\nSeamill. In the very best part of this district a villa was secured in\r\n1880 by some gentlemen interested in the treatment, with grounds\r\nabutting on the sand of the seashore.\r\n\r\nHere treatment was carried on with great success, until it became\r\nevident that larger premises were needed. In 1882 Mr. James Newbigging\r\nwas secured by Dr. Kirk as manager and head-bathman, and worked under\r\nDr. Kirk until the latter's death in 1886.\r\n\r\nMr. Newbigging then bought the establishment. Since that time, it has\r\nconstantly increased in size and efficiency until it now accommodates\r\nclose on a hundred patients.\r\n\r\nVery many have come to Seamill almost or quite hopeless, and have left\r\nit with health restored and vigour renewed.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be mentioned here that in all his dealings with this\r\nestablishment Dr. Kirk never had any pecuniary interest in it, always\r\ngiving his services free. Nor has the writer, or any of Dr. Kirk's\r\nfamily, any pecuniary connection with the place. All information as to\r\nthe establishment may be had by writing to the Proprietor or Manager,\r\nSeamill Sanatorium, West Kilbride, Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nSea-Sickness.--The cause of this is a nervous derangement of the\r\ninternal organs, by which the bile passes into the stomach instead of,\r\nas it normally does, passing down into the intestines. A tight bandage\r\nround the middle of the body, so as to oppose resistance to this, will\r\nhelp _so far_. When the sickness has come on, a teacupful of hot water,\r\nat intervals, will very largely mitigate, and will often cure it. Even\r\nhalf a teacupful or a tablespoonful will prove sufficient in many cases\r\nwhere the teacupful cannot be taken. If this small quantity of hot\r\nwater be taken every ten minutes, the worst effects of sea-sickness\r\nwill not be felt, and far more relief obtained than most people will\r\nbelieve until they have tried it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSensitiveness.--When the nervous system is in a certain state, all\r\nimpressions on it are exaggerated, and the patient suffers from light\r\nsounds, and various irritations, far more than is usual or healthy.\r\nThis state makes treatment difficult, because either cold towel or hot\r\nflannel distresses the sufferer, and by this does more harm than good.\r\nNarcotics only do harm, without any good, and leave the patient worse.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system may in such cases be soothed by soaping the back\r\nwith soap lather (_see_ Lather; Soap). The lather is to be blood heat,\r\nand very soft and creamy. Spread it all over a soft cloth as large as\r\nthe back (having first warmed the cloth), and then place it gently on\r\nthe back, lather side next the skin. Let this be done at bedtime.\r\nFasten the cloth on the back with a bodice that will fasten closely,\r\nand let the patient sleep on it. Wash off in the morning with warm\r\nvinegar and water half-and-half. Rub with oil and dry off. Let the\r\npatient take twice a-day, for eight days, a teaspoonful of well-boiled\r\nliquorice and a tablespoonful of hot water. This treatment will usually\r\nabate the sensitiveness in a week or so, and bring the patient within\r\nreach of other remedies. For example, it will, after a week or so, even\r\nin very trying cases, be possible to foment the feet and legs once a\r\nday, and rub them with warm olive oil. It will even be possible and\r\nwell to foment with a hot blanket across the haunches, and in this way\r\nto bring on comparatively strong health. Change of air and scene will\r\nthen be desirable: it is highly refreshing to one who is in the way of\r\nrecovering, though only harassing to one who is feeling despondent and\r\nincreasingly ill. We generally, when asked if a \"change\" would not be\r\ngood in such cases, reply, \"Yes, if once you have got health enough to\r\nenjoy it.\" When that has been fairly secured, stronger measures may be\r\nused with advantage. We feel much sympathy with those who suffer from\r\nsensitiveness, as so many do, and earnestly pray that these remarks may\r\nbe blessed to such sufferers.\r\n\r\n\r\nShampooing.--_See_ Head, Soaping.\r\n\r\n\r\nShingles.--Though not often fatal, this illness gives serious trouble.\r\nIts outstanding feature is a rash which comes out as a more or less\r\nregular belt round the body, or over one shoulder. The rash forms, if\r\nallowed to go on, into blackish scabs, and is accompanied in some\r\ninstances by severe pains shooting through the body. It arises from a\r\nfailure of the digestive system, therefore the stomach must be as\r\nlittle taxed as possible. Let hot water be sipped in teaspoonfuls for\r\nhalf-an-hour at a time, several times a day. For external treatment,\r\nwring a small sheet out of cold water and vinegar, and pack the whole\r\ntrunk of the patient in this for half-an-hour. Do not use olive oil.\r\nThe vinegar packing may be renewed in an hour, and as often as the\r\npatient feels it agreeable. The mixture of vinegar and water must be\r\nweak enough not to be painful on the skin. If the pains in the body\r\npersist, then cold cloths may be applied, not very large at first, to\r\nthe spine, while the patient is warm in bed. Should the feet be cold,\r\nthis cooling of the spine must not be done until they are wrapped in a\r\nhot fomentation up to the knees. If the scabby eruption is very\r\nobstinate, the SOAPY BLANKET (_see_) applied daily for two or three\r\ndays should clear it away. Wheaten porridge, gruel, and milk diet is\r\nbest. A drink may be made of hot water and lemon juice, with five or\r\nsix drops of tincture of cayenne added to a tumblerful, and sweetened\r\nto taste. _See_ Drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nShivering.--This is often a trivial matter, but sometimes it is a\r\nsymptom of a serious chill. It may be only the effect of a thought, or\r\nof some mental shock, but in any case it is a nervous disturbance, and\r\nfailure of energy, causing us to lose control of the nerves which\r\nproduce the shivering movements.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary shivering, the result of cold, treat as in Cold, Taking.\r\nFor cases where the vital action has evidently become very low, foment\r\nthe patient as directed in Angina Pectoris.\r\n\r\nIf pain in some part, as in a nursing breast or tender lung, indicates\r\ninflammatory action there, cold towels may be applied to that part\r\nwhile this fomentation is on. Renew the cold cloth as often as the\r\npatient feels it agreeable, keeping up the heat of the fomentation all\r\nthe time. Increase the size of the cold cloth if the patient finds this\r\npleasant; stop if it becomes unpleasant. Many serious troubles are\r\nchecked in the first stage by treatment on these simple lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSick Headache.--_See_ Headache.\r\n\r\n\r\nSitting (or Sitz) Bath.--This bath, in whatever form administered, is\r\nessentially a sitting in cold water with the feet out. The feet, in\r\nfact, are better to be warmly covered up while the patient sits in the\r\nbath. The most important thing to be considered in all such baths is\r\nthe degree of vitality possessed by the patient. If he has much\r\nvitality, then the bath may be deep and longer continued--as long as\r\neven forty minutes. If the vitality be low, the bath must be brief and\r\nvery shallow--it may be even necessary to make it as short as _one\r\nminute_, or even less. In some cases, as a beginning, a mere dip is all\r\nthat is required. This leaves a large discretion to the nurse, and is a\r\nmatter which common sense should be able to decide. To try a short bath\r\nfirst, and repeat it several times, rather than to give one long one,\r\nis the safest plan. It will soon be found out how much the patient can\r\nbear. If the vitality be so low as to make the simple sitz-bath a\r\ndanger, the feet may be immersed, for the one or two minutes of the\r\nbath, in a small bath of hot water, and the patient well wrapped up all\r\nover in warm blankets.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it is necessary to _pour_ cold water on relaxed organs,\r\nwhich, especially with females, will sometimes not be braced up by mere\r\nimmersion. But such pouring must be done with caution. Half-a-minute of\r\nit is _a long time_; one quarter-of-a-minute or less will usually be\r\nenough, even in important cases. If longer applications have only done\r\nharm, then let our friends try the one-minute bath, or the\r\nquarter-minute stream of water. In many cases we have known this make\r\nall right. Such short baths may be taken twice or thrice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkin, Care of.--Among the vast majority of people air and water far too\r\nseldom touch the skin. Want of water makes it unclean, and want of\r\nwater and air make it slow in reaction. Now, a healthy skin is of the\r\nutmost value when one is attacked by disease. It can regulate the\r\ntemperature of the various organs, and the application of heat or cold\r\nto it will cause a reaction at once. Much of our treatment as given in\r\nthis book is directed towards stimulating the action of the skin. It is\r\nobvious that in health as in disease the skin can and does so act on\r\nthe internal organs.\r\n\r\nIt should be the aim of everyone that this most important part of the\r\nbody should receive careful attention by a strict watch on the diet, by\r\ncleanliness, tonic water baths (cold, tepid, shower, as may be found to\r\nsuit), and by tonic air baths. Light clothing and porous underwear will\r\nalso be found of use. We have already drawn attention to the value of\r\nKneipp linen as the most suitable form of underwear (_see_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the Skin, showing glandular structure.\r\n               Hairs\r\n               Fat Cells\r\n               Sebaceous Gland\r\n               Sweat Gland\r\n               Nutrient Artery\r\n               Hair Bulb]\r\n\r\n\r\nSkin, A Wintry.--Something like an epidemic of skin trouble is often\r\nexperienced in cold, wintry weather. First, the skin becomes dry and\r\nhard. A moist and sticky exudation replaces the ordinary sweat, and\r\ngreat irritation is felt when the skin is exposed to the air. If the\r\nsticky exudation be completely rubbed off, this irritation ceases. In\r\nthis, and in the absence of inflammation, \"wintry skin\" differs\r\nentirely from eczema. The remedy is to rub all over every night for\r\nthree or four nights with the CAYENNE LOTION (_see_). If this does not\r\neffectually cure, lather all over with soap and olive oil (_see_\r\nLather; Soap), before rubbing with the cayenne lotion. If the treatment\r\nof the whole skin at once is felt to be too severe, it may be cured by\r\ntaking it in parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkin, Creeping.--A sensation sometimes very much annoys patients, which\r\nthey describe as like thousands of small creatures creeping over the\r\nskin. It most commonly arises from defective working of the pores. A\r\nkindred trouble may be noticed along with this creeping. It is as if a\r\nstream of cold water were passing down the back. That causes great\r\ndiscomfort in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe cure is sponging frequently with weak ACETIC ACID (_see_) or even\r\ngood buttermilk. The skin being in such cases very sensitive, it is\r\nwell to treat it bit by bit, a small part at a time. Take one limb,\r\nthen another, then part of the back, and then another part. Besides\r\nthis sponging with acid, and before it is done, the skin should be\r\ngently covered with lather (_see_ Lather; Soap). If this treatment is\r\nnot successful, a little olive oil, with cayenne lotion, may be mixed\r\nwith the soapy lather, and will make its effect more powerful. This\r\ncreepy feeling is sometimes the result of cold, and some extra clothing\r\nmay remove it. _See_ Underwear.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep.--No greater mistake could be made than to curtail the hours of\r\nsleep. Eight hours should be taken as a minimum, and any weak person\r\nshould take ten hours. More and better work can be done by a person who\r\ntakes fully eight hours' sleep than by one who tries to do with less.\r\n\r\nSometimes strong tea or coffee is taken to drive away sleep, and so the\r\nnervous system is injured and sleep will not come when it is desired.\r\nTea or coffee should never be taken except _very_ weak, and the person\r\nwho accustoms himself to this will very soon come greatly to prefer it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleeplessness.--In search of sleep men do many things both dangerous\r\nand foolish--sometimes even fatal. Sleeplessness arises in so many ways\r\nand from so many causes, that it is often hard for the patient to find\r\na cure, and he will try anything in desperation. A little thought\r\nshould prevent this state of mind. For instance, we have a man who\r\ntries to get sleep by fatiguing himself by long walks in the open air\r\nor hard physical work of some kind, but he only grows worse. Now, a\r\nlittle thought will show that sleep requires a certain amount of brain\r\nenergy. If the supply be below this amount, the brain is _too tired_ to\r\nsleep. Violent exercise of any kind will only make matters worse. So\r\n\"keeping people awake\" all day is tried, to make them sleep at night.\r\nIt fails from the same reason--that it _reduces_ brain power. All\r\nnarcotics in the end fail similarly. There comes a time when they have\r\nso reduced brain power, that even an enormous dose fails to give sleep,\r\nand the patient comes dangerously near poisoning himself--sometimes,\r\nindeed, does so outright. In all these cases, that which has worn down\r\nthe brain _must be given up_ as a first condition of cure. Whether\r\nbrain work, over-excitement and dissipation, alcohol or tobacco, the\r\ncause must be removed, and rest taken in the open air, or in well\r\nventilated rooms.\r\n\r\nThis done, we come to treatment. Soaping the head (_see_ Head,\r\nSoaping), or even the application of towels wrung out of cold water,\r\nwill often, when the cause has been removed, do all that is needed to\r\ngive sleep. These remedies, especially the first, should be at once\r\napplied, if the sleeplessness is accompanied, as is usual, with _heat\r\nin the head_. Even where the fevered head is connected with\r\nindigestion, the stomach will be powerfully helped by a good soaping of\r\nthe head at bedtime. If, on the contrary, the head is cold, then warm\r\nfomentations to it will be the proper treatment. Perhaps the very best\r\nguide will be to aim at what will make both head and feet perfectly\r\ncomfortable, and _both_ of natural heat. If cold, the feet must be\r\nbathed or fomented, and the legs also up to the knees. Sometimes the\r\npouring of warm water in a _douche_ over the head will act perfectly,\r\ninstead of the fomentation; but pouring _cold_ water must be avoided,\r\nor only very cautiously resorted to (_see_ Sitz-Bath and Restlessness).\r\n\r\nSometimes sleeplessness proceeds from the use of bad drinking water,\r\nthrough its effect on the stomach and bowels. In this case, of course,\r\nthe first thing is to see that no bad water is drunk. People cannot be\r\ntoo careful about a water supply. Usually boiling for half-an-hour\r\nrenders water safe enough, but this is not always the case. Care must\r\nthen be taken to see that water from any corrupted source is not used.\r\nWhen it is given up, treatment as above may be applied.\r\n\r\nIf the sleeplessness be caused by a nasty tickling cough, put a BRAN\r\nPOULTICE (_see_), or similar FOMENTATION (_see_) on the back _behind_\r\nwhere the cough catches. Then change cold towels _in front_ over the\r\nsame place. Soap the head, and sleep will probably soon come.\r\n\r\nWhere palpitation of the heart causes sleeplessness, change cold towels\r\nover the heart, fomenting the feet if necessary, and the palpitation\r\nwill usually soon yield. _See_ Brain; Children's Sleep; Exercise; Head;\r\nRest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmallpox.--If an epidemic prevails in the neighbourhood, or a case\r\noccurs in the house, after _due and carefully performed_ vaccination of\r\nthe family, the important matter to regard is _cleanliness_. Frequent\r\nand thorough washing and changing of all the clothes worn next the skin\r\nwill do much to prevent possible infection. If the clothes are often\r\nchanged, then, and well washed, and the skin gets a daily washing with\r\nsoap and is sponged with hot vinegar, there is little danger of\r\ninfection during an epidemic of smallpox, or even when nursing the\r\ndisease. Acetic acid, or white wine vinegar, is even a more powerful\r\ncleansing agent than carbolic acid, and has the advantage of being\r\nnon-poisonous.\r\n\r\nIt is important in treatment to attack the disease early. We have known\r\nan attack completely defeated, and the patient cured, by a wet-sheet\r\npack administered at the right time. The early symptoms are a great\r\nweariness and chilliness. In this _cold_ stage, half-a-teaspoonful of\r\ncream of tartar, in two tablespoonfuls of hot water, should be given\r\nevery half-hour. Also (and this is important) wrap the feet and legs up\r\nover the knees in a large hot FOMENTATION (_see_). The head also may be\r\npacked in hot cloths. If the fever does not rise, the applications may\r\ncontinue. If the fever does come on, _cold_ cloths must be persistently\r\nchanged on the head. This we have known _reduces_ the bodily\r\ntemperature two degrees in half-an-hour, when if left alone it would\r\nprobably have _risen_ two degrees. The whole body may be packed in a\r\ndamp sheet, covered with dry blanket, and this continued cooling of the\r\nhead still proceeded with.\r\n\r\nWhen the eruption has appeared, and the violent itching set in, the\r\neruption must be persistently _soaked_ with weak ACETIC ACID (_see_),\r\nor good white wine vinegar and water. In this soaking, avoid giving the\r\npatient pain by too strong acid. The necessary healing power will be\r\nfound in such a mixture as will only cause the eruption slightly to\r\nsmart.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to treat a patient all over at once. You will do\r\nbetter if you take one or two pimples at a time. You can then pass from\r\npart to part slowly, getting over the whole. You can use a little olive\r\noil after this soaking with vinegar, and so keep off all danger of\r\nchill such as might occur if too much of the surface were treated at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIf these simple means are well applied from the first, it must be a\r\nvery bad case indeed which will not be cured, and most likely without\r\nany marks being left on the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSnake Bites.--A snake bite is only one of a large class of injuries\r\nwhich may be considered under one title. From an insect sting upwards\r\nto the most fatal snake bite, we need to note, first, the _blow_ or\r\n_shock_ of the bite, and then the fever symptoms which show poison\r\nspreading in the system. The blow or shock paralyses or kills a larger\r\nor smaller part of the nervous system. The nerve of the heart may be\r\nalmost instantly so paralysed, with fatal effect. The snake poison\r\nespecially affects the organic nervous system, and thus attacks the\r\nvery source of vitality. In smaller stings, rubbing vinegar or weak\r\nACETIC ACID (_see_) into the wound is sufficient almost instantly to\r\ncure. The same substance will cure greater evils. In the case of snake\r\nbite, first suck the wound thoroughly, watching that the lips and gums\r\nof the person who sucks are free from wound or scratch, or use what is\r\ncalled \"dry cupping.\" Much may be done thus in a _few seconds_. But it\r\nmust not be continued longer, and hinder the next step. This is to\r\ninject weak acetic acid _into the bite_. Where snakes are abundant, a\r\nsmall syringe, such as is used to inject morphia, with a rather blunt\r\npoint, should be always carried, and acetic acid of the right strength.\r\nThe injection must be _thorough_, and of course pain must be borne to\r\navoid greater evil. Foment cautiously but persistently over the stomach\r\nand along the spine. Pay special attention to the lower back if bitten\r\nin the foot or leg, and to the upper part if in the hand or arm. During\r\nrecovery, give careful diet, and rest. Of course this treatment will\r\nfail in some cases, as any treatment may. But if immediately applied,\r\nit will save a very large number of lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoaping the Head.--_See_ Head, Soaping.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoap, M'Clinton's.--Those of our readers who have followed out in\r\npractice the suggestions which we have given in these papers, will have\r\nseen some reason to believe in the importance of soap. Probably some of\r\nthem have laughed at patients whose chief need evidently was a good\r\nwashing of the skin! But there is more in soap applications than mere\r\ncleansing. These are found to be of immense value in cases in which\r\nthere has been no want of perfect cleanliness--in cases even in which\r\nthe skin has been habitually clean. For instance, in patients with\r\nnerves so sensitive that almost no application of any kind can be used,\r\na covering of the back with a fine lather, and over this a soft cloth,\r\nhas soothed the system so effectively that a great step has been\r\nsecured by this alone in the direction of cure.\r\n\r\nWhen in search of really good soap we soon find that certain soaps are\r\nvery harmful. Soaps made from \"soda ash,\" as nearly all hard soaps are,\r\ntend to dry and harden the skin, and if used often produce bad effects.\r\n\r\nSoda soap does well enough for many purposes, and if it is not used\r\noften, and the skin is strong, no great harm may be done; but when it\r\nhas to be used frequently, or is applied to a tender sensitive skin or\r\nto parts from which the outer skin has been removed, it will not do at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFor years we had been seeking for somebody who could make us hard soap\r\nwithout any mixture of soda. Once, when in Belfast, we spoke of this to\r\na friend. He took us to a soapmaker, to whom we mentioned our desire.\r\nThis gentleman at once saw what we wanted, and told us frankly that he\r\ncould not make the soap that would suit us, and that he knew only one\r\nfirm in the trade who could do so. But he assured us that that firm\r\nmade a pure hard soap which we should find exactly suitable to our\r\npurpose. Thus we were introduced to the manufacturers of M'Clinton's\r\nsoap. This firm, we found, made the very soap we had been so long in\r\nsearch of.\r\n\r\nIt is made (by a process which is, we believe, a secret in possession\r\nof this firm alone) from the ash of plants, and so it may truly be said\r\nthat it is Nature's soap.\r\n\r\nThere is something in the composition of this soap which makes it\r\nastonishingly curative and most agreeable on the skin. Lather made from\r\nit, instead of drying and so far burning the skin of those using it,\r\nhas the most soothing and delightful effect.\r\n\r\nAs yet we do not feel able to explain this, not being sufficiently\r\nchemical for the work, but we have tried the matter, and feel assured\r\nthat this soap is by a long way the best for cleansing and curative\r\npurposes. Even soap which possesses the same chemical composition lacks\r\nthe properties of that made from plants, a fact not without parallel,\r\nas chemists know. The substances of the plant ash differ in some\r\nunknown way from even those chemically the same, which have been\r\nartificially produced.\r\n\r\nWe trust that our noticing the thing in this way will have the effect\r\nof calling attention to the whole question of soap-making and using. It\r\nis one of those questions on which great ignorance prevails. Many\r\npeople judge toilet soaps by the perfume and price. If the former is\r\npleasant, and the latter high, they consider they must be getting\r\nsomething specially suitable, and yet the soap itself may be very\r\ninjurious. Before we had some cases of bad diseases of the skin arising\r\nfrom the use of certain soaps, it did not occur to us to think much of\r\nthe difference between one sort and another. Hence we just said, \"use\r\nlather from good soap.\" Now we see need for care as to the kind of soap\r\nused, and especially to warn against all soaps, however fine-looking,\r\nthat burn the tender skin when lather made from them is much applied.\r\n\r\nVery especially is it important to distinguish between the qualities of\r\nsoaps used on the sensitive skins of infants and invalids. If you ever\r\nwash an infant in strongly caustic soap, you may look for a state of\r\ndiscomfort in the child which will make it restless and miserable\r\nwithout your being able to tell how it is so. You may ascribe to\r\nunhappy \"temper\" what is due to the bad soap which you have put on the\r\nskin. So with sensitive invalids, when they have to be washed or\r\nsoaped, so as to keep off or heal the bedsores which are apt to appear\r\non them, it is easy to see how much difference there must be between\r\nthe effect of a caustic soap and one really and delightfully soothing.\r\n\r\nM'Clinton's soap is the very best and most lasting of the soaps we know\r\nfor washing purposes, so that in recommending it we are not promoting\r\nthe use of a merely medical thing, but of one for ordinary purposes of\r\na genuine and excellent character. Every grocer ought to have it in\r\nstock, and if it is sought after with some vigour it will be soon\r\nbrought in general trade within reach of all. It is not one of those\r\nthings that flame on railway stations and on the covers of magazines.\r\nThe makers are most quiet, unpretending men, and one would think almost\r\nafraid to take their light from under a bushel. But they are in\r\npossession of a most valuable secret in knowing how to make this soap.\r\n\r\nSeveral soap-makers claim to be makers of this soap, insisting that\r\ntheirs is as good as M'Clinton's. It is far cheaper. Well, we put it to\r\nthe test of use. It is not the same thing at all. It won't do, nor will\r\nit nearly do: the soda is there beyond all doubt. We are compelled to\r\nrecommend our readers to make sure that they get M'Clinton's soap, with\r\nthis name stamped upon it.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong temptation to deception, because M'Clinton's soap\r\nrequires eight days at least to make, while the fiery stuff is made in\r\none day, or two at most. It is of great importance that the true soap\r\nshould be secured. The matter is so important that precious life and\r\nhealth depend on so humble a thing as this.\r\n\r\nTake care you are not cheated by a wrong substance. Do not say you have\r\ntried our remedy and found it fail. If you have applied irritating soap\r\ninstead of soothing, the so-called remedy could not but fail. Make sure\r\nyou have the right substance, and you will have the right effect.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: To prevent an inferior article being substituted if it is\r\nasked for as barilla soap simply, it is in this edition called\r\nM'Clinton's soap. It is now made solely by D. Brown & Son, Ltd.,\r\nDonaghmore, Tyrone, Ireland, who have purchased the business and trade\r\nsecrets of the old firm, and manufacture the soap in the same way. If\r\nnot stocked by the local chemist or grocer, small samples can be had\r\nfrom the manufacturers free on receipt of 2d. to cover postage, or a\r\nlarge assorted box will be sent on receipt of 2s. 6d.]\r\n\r\nFortunately the makers of M'Clinton's soap are sternly honest men, and\r\ntheir soap can be relied on: that we have found out, we think, beyond\r\nmistake. We are happy to be able to say that they have not sent us even\r\na bar of soap for our \"Papers\" on their behalf, but only assured us\r\nthat they will \"reward\" our kindness by \"making a genuine article.\" If\r\nthere is \"puffing,\" there is at least to be no payment for it, and that\r\nis a safe way of keeping the \"puffer\" to the truth!\r\n\r\nThe curative effects of M'Clinton's soap will be found dealt with in\r\nthe directions for treatment of various troubles throughout this\r\nvolume. See the articles on Abscess; Asthma; Blood, Purifying; Boils;\r\nCancer; Child-Bearing; Dwining; Fever; Hands; Hives; Pimples on Face;\r\nRheumatism; Skin; Sleeplessness; Soapy Blanket; Stomach Trouble;\r\nVaccination Trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoapy Blanket, The.--It seems necessary, in getting people to use the\r\nbest means for the recovery of health, carefully to consider, not the\r\ndiseases to which they are subject only, but especially the processes\r\nof cure. We require to go into the very nature of things, so to speak,\r\nand to make it all palpable to the inquirer. For example, you prescribe\r\na little olive oil on the skin, and the nurse is horrified at its being\r\nsuggested that she should \"block up the pores.\" Her idea is that these\r\npores are only little holes in the skin, so that, if you fill them up\r\nwith oil, the insensible perspiration will not get through. Now let us\r\nobserve that a pore is a complete organ in itself, and has at least\r\nthree things that characterise it. (_See_ page 285). First of all, it\r\nis a living thing. It is so as really as a finger is a living organ, or\r\nan eye, or an ear. When it dies, it is as much an opening as ever, but\r\nit ceases to secrete the perspiration which is constantly separated\r\nfrom the current of the blood when it was healthily alive. When it is\r\nsickly, though still living in a weak degree, it secretes, but so\r\nsluggishly that the substance which it separates from the blood does\r\nnot pass off easily--it gets, so to speak, thick and sticky, and\r\nremains in the pores.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the substance which a pore secretes will not\r\ncombine with certain things, and it will chemically combine readily\r\nwith other things. When the pore is sickly, it may be aided, first, by\r\nthe introduction of heat, which becomes vital action, and secondly, by\r\nthe use of such substances as will readily combine with its secretion.\r\nThe heat makes it secrete more perfectly, and the chemical combination\r\nmakes the removal of the secretion easy. It is possible to block the\r\npores up, but it is not very easy to do so. A healthy pore will send\r\nits secretions out through very close stuff. It is only by something\r\nlike very strong varnish that it can be prevented.\r\n\r\nThere is wonderfully little danger in ordinary life of any such \"block\"\r\nas this. But there is very great danger of the pore being deprived of\r\nits secretive power, and of its power to open its mouth when that is so\r\nmuch wanted. Warm olive oil sets millions of pores to full work\r\nsometimes in a few seconds.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at the application of the soapy blanket in the light of\r\nthese remarks. Here is a poor patient, sitting in an armchair by the\r\nfireside, labouring to get breath. It makes one feel burdened to see\r\nhim. What is wrong? Are the pores blocked up? No; but they are more\r\nthan half dead, and what they do secrete is not such an ethereal thing\r\nas it should be. Nearly all the work of getting rid of the waste of the\r\nbody has been thrown for months upon the poor lungs. The kidneys, too,\r\nhave got far more than their share, just because the pores are sickly.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is the soapy blanket. This most valuable means of\r\nstimulating the healthy action of the skin (as prescribed in many\r\narticles in this volume) is prepared and applied as follows:--Have a\r\ngood blanket, and plenty of M'Clinton's soap (_see_ Lather and Soap).\r\nShear down a tablet or two into boiling water--as much water as the\r\nblanket will absorb. The blanket may be prepared as directed in article\r\nFomentation, using these boiling _suds_ instead of water. Have the\r\npatient's bed ready, and spread on it a double dry sheet. Soak in the\r\nsuds a piece of thick flannel large enough to go round the body under\r\nthe armpits. Wring this out and put it on the patient. Wrap the blanket\r\ntightly round the patient from the neck downwards. Tie something round\r\nthe waist to confine it close to the body. Put the patient into bed,\r\nand wrap the feet well up in the blanket. If it is not sufficient to\r\ncover them, an extra piece of soapy flannel must be used. Then wrap the\r\nsheets over the patient above the moist blanket, and cover all nicely\r\nup. In removing the blanket, which may remain on half-an-hour, it is\r\nwell to proceed gradually, uncovering the body bit by bit, sponging\r\neach part with hot water and vinegar or weak acetic acid (_see_ Acetic\r\nAcid), and rubbing hot oil on after drying. Dry this oil off, and cover\r\neach dried part of the body either with clothing or blankets before\r\nuncovering a fresh part.\r\n\r\nThere is a modification of this treatment which suits more weakly\r\npersons, and suits also those who must do all, or almost all, for\r\nthemselves. A long flannel or flannelette nightdress is used in this,\r\ninstead of the blanket. This is covered on the whole of the inner side\r\nwith well-made soap lather. When so covered it is put on at bedtime,\r\nand a dry nightdress put on over it. Both are then fastened as closely\r\nas possible to the skin, and the patient goes to sleep thus clothed. If\r\nthe night is cold, the greatest care must be taken to be well covered,\r\nand brought to as good a heat as possible. In the morning a very great\r\nchange will have come from this treatment. When the whole body is\r\nwashed down with warm water, dried, and nicely rubbed with fresh oil,\r\nthe skin is found very considerably changed, and in case of asthma the\r\nbreathing relieved.\r\n\r\nIf cold is taken when this process is fairly gone through, it would be\r\nvery astonishing indeed; but if it is badly done, a person might get\r\nchilled instead of comforted. Therefore every care must be taken to\r\nkeep the patient thoroughly warm. The result of one effectual pack is\r\nusually sufficient to convince the poor sufferer that he is being\r\ntreated in the right way. The effect of the second is greater, and so\r\non to the fourth or fifth, beyond which he need not go as a rule. He\r\nwill do well once a day to wash with hot vinegar and rub after with the\r\noil. These should not be required more than a fortnight at most. If\r\nchilliness continues, it is well to put on cotton stockings on going to\r\nbed, and even to bathe the feet and oil them before doing so. This\r\nbathing may be continued every night for a fortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSores.--These will be found dealt with under many headings throughout\r\nthis book (_see_ Abscess; Bone, Diseased; Blood; Boils; Breast; Cancer;\r\nCarbuncle; Cauliflower Growth; Eruptions; Erysipelas, etc.), therefore\r\nwe here only treat generally of two kinds of common sores. The first is\r\nthe surface sore, which eats inwards; the second, the deep-seated sore,\r\nwhich eats outwards. The first usually begins as a small pimple like a\r\npin's head, and, if neglected, breaks, and gradually increases in size.\r\nIts origin is something which has caused the minute vessels of the skin\r\nat the spot to give way, so that they remain congested with bad blood,\r\nwhich soon becomes practically poisonous, and so the sore enlarges and\r\neats into the surrounding tissue. If such a sore appears on the leg, it\r\nis often due to over-pressure through too much standing. Rest, with the\r\nleg kept horizontal or inclined slightly upwards to the foot, will\r\noften be enough to cure. When complete rest cannot be had, a thigh\r\nbandage (_see_ Veins, Swollen) should be worn.\r\n\r\nTo treat the sore, it should be washed twice a day with BUTTERMILK\r\n(_see_), and afterwards thoroughly soaked with weak ACETIC ACID\r\n(_see_), and dressed with antiseptic lint, or, if that cannot be had,\r\nwith buttermilk cloths. A buttermilk poultice (_see_ Potato Poultice)\r\nmay be used. But if no rest can be had, the sore will be extremely\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to heal.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of sore, arising from an abscess under the part, or\r\ndiseased bone or membrane far down beneath the skin, is to be treated\r\non the same principles, using weak acetic acid for the syringing, and\r\nbuttermilk only for the surface. The method of treatment is such as\r\nwill secure the contact of the weak acid with _every part_, even the\r\ndeepest, of the wound. Procure a small pointed glass syringe, which\r\nmust be kept _thoroughly clean_. The point of this may be inserted into\r\nthe sore, and care taken that the weak acid penetrates into the very\r\nbottom, and thoroughly soaks all the diseased parts. This syringing\r\nshould be repeated until the wound is thoroughly clean in every part.\r\nIf pain is set up, the acid is too strong. Syringing with lukewarm\r\nwater will at once relieve this, and then weaker acid may be used. This\r\ntreatment may be given twice a day, and the wound properly dressed\r\nafter it. Attention must be paid in all treatment of sores or wounds to\r\nthe proper cleansing and boiling of all materials and instruments used.\r\nWash the hands in hot water and M'Clinton's soap, using a nail-brush,\r\nbefore touching or dressing a sore.\r\n\r\nBoil some soft clean rags for five minutes, and wash the sore with\r\nthese, using water that has been boiled and allowed to cool to\r\nblood-heat, to which a few drops of acetic acid have been added, but\r\nnot so much as to be painful on the sore.\r\n\r\nIf a syringe is used, boil it before using, and only use boiled or\r\ndistilled water in all operations. This secures the destruction of the\r\ngerms (or Bacteria), which are now known as the cause of the\r\ninflammation and suppuration of wounds and sores of all kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpinal Congestion.--In some cases of this trouble the symptoms are very\r\nalarming, consisting in violent convulsive movements, which seem\r\naltogether beyond the possibility of relief. It is something to know\r\nthat these terrible kickings and strugglings arise from simply an\r\naccumulation of blood in the vessels of the spinal cord, irritating it\r\nviolently, as an electric current might do. Sedatives and narcotics\r\nwill be useless. Leeches applied to the spine will sometimes cure by\r\nwithdrawing the blood from it, though such treatment leaves no bracing\r\nand strengthening effect, but the very opposite. Use the cold towel,\r\nwrung out and placed along the spine, together with a hot blanket\r\nFOMENTATION (_see_) to the feet and legs, up over the knees. The\r\npatient must be gently held still, as far as possible, so that the\r\ntreatment may be applied. The applications will not be at once\r\nsuccessful, but after an hour's work something like permanent relief\r\nshould come. Above all, the nurse must keep cool and calm in mind and\r\nmanner. There is no need for hysterics, and any excitable person should\r\nbe kept out of the sick-room. If the skin of the back has been broken\r\nby blistering or any such treatment, a fine lather (_see_ Lather; Soap)\r\nshould be spread over all the back, and on this a soft cloth. Above\r\nthis the cold towels may be safely and comfortably applied. It will do\r\nno harm if the treatment be continued for even two or three hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpine, Misshapen.--Often in the case of delicate infants or children,\r\nthe bones of the spine fail to have the necessary hardness to bear the\r\nstrain which comes upon them, and the spine gets more or less out of\r\nits proper shape. If this softness of bone continues, no amount of\r\nmechanical support, or lying down, will cure the misshapen spine.\r\nTherefore means should be taken by proper diet and nourishment to help\r\nthe production of good bone substance in the child's body. The best\r\nbone-making food we know is good oatmeal, as well-boiled porridge\r\n(boiled for two or three hours), or as oatmeal jelly and gruel. Good\r\nair and water are also essential, and such treatment as is described in\r\narticle on Children's Healthy Growth. Especially should attention be\r\npaid to constant supply of fresh air to the child's lungs. Windows\r\nshould be wide open in all weathers, and if the child cannot walk far,\r\nit should be wheeled out for as long as possible every day the weather\r\npermits. Such supply of fresh air is of _vital importance_, and the\r\nwant of it is frequently the sole cause of disease.\r\n\r\nIn other cases it is not the bones which are soft, but the muscles and\r\nligaments which hold the spine in a proper position are defective.\r\nWhere the bone is felt to be good-sized and hard, and the surrounding\r\nsubstance too soft, it is a case of this kind. To proper nourishment,\r\nin this case, must be added proper _exercise_ of the muscles concerned.\r\nImmovable plaster jackets are bad, because they forbid this. This\r\nexercise may best be given by rubbing (_see_ Exercise and Massage).\r\nGentle rubbing and pressure over the back, with hot OLIVE OIL (_see_),\r\nwill work wonders in such a case. During the rubbing the patient should\r\nlie down _at full length_. It must also be done so as to be _pleasant_,\r\nor it is of no use.\r\n\r\nSee that the patient has plenty of rest, and only as much walking\r\nexercise as is evidently enjoyed. There may be complications with other\r\ntroubles--for example, a quick pulse and some fever heat, if the\r\ntemperature is tested. That will require to be itself treated with\r\nrepeated rubbings of finely wrought lather over the stomach and bowels.\r\nUntil you have in some measure subdued this fever, you will not do much\r\nin the way of improving the muscles of the back. In many cases you will\r\nbe able to bring the fever down completely, and then you will be free\r\nto exercise the muscles, and so to strengthen them that they will bring\r\nthe spine to something like its proper shape. (_See_ Assimilation;\r\nDiet; Digestion; Nerves; Nourishment; Paralysis; Massage.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpine, Weakness of the.--_See_ Children's Healthy Growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSprains or Racks.--A sprain is usually the result of some involuntary\r\nstress coming upon the part. If the injury be to the muscular substance\r\nonly, it is easily healed; hot fomentations should be given to the\r\nsprained parts, with perfect rest and every possible ease and comfort\r\nby position, etc., and nature will soon effect a cure. If the injury be\r\nreally to the _nerves_ which control the muscles, as is generally the\r\ncase, the matter is more difficult. The muscle swells, but this is\r\nprimarily due to the overstrain of the nerves in the sudden effort they\r\nmake to bear a crushing load on the muscle. The pain is from pressure\r\nin the swelling, and also from inflammatory action.\r\n\r\nThe cure, then, must be applied to the motor nerves controlling the\r\nmuscles, and is best applied at their roots in the spinal cord. If the\r\narm, hand, or wrist be sprained, rub gently the upper spinal region\r\nwith warm olive oil, continuing the rubbing _gently_ down the arm to\r\nthe injured part (_see_ Rubbing) until the whole shoulder and arm glow\r\nwith comfortable warmth. But all rubbing such as causes pain must be\r\navoided. If such rubbing cannot be managed, then a hot BRAN POULTICE\r\n(_see_) must be placed between the shoulders, and a warm fomentation\r\ngiven to the shoulder and arm. The treatment should be given once a\r\nday, and ere many days the sprain should be cured. For ankle and knee\r\nsprains, the lower back and leg must be treated on similar principles.\r\n\r\nWhere the chest muscles that cover the ribs are sprained, rubbing and\r\nmoist heat should be applied over the back and round the side where the\r\nsprain is, paying especial attention to the spine opposite the sprain,\r\nand using hot olive oil before fomentation and after, as well as to rub\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nIf the belly be sprained, similar treatment should be given lower down\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\nIf the back muscles are sprained, then the same treatment should be\r\napplied, taking special care to stimulate with moist heat and rubbing\r\nthe part of the spine on a level with the injury, where the roots of\r\nthe nerves lie which supply the sprained muscles. Care must ever be\r\ntaken to avoid giving pain--to give pain is to increase the injury. To\r\nproduce a glow of heat all through the parts is to cure it. (_See_\r\nMuscular Pains.)\r\n\r\nFor a sprained heel, when there is some degree of inflammation about\r\nit, we should pack the whole foot in fine soap lather. Let it be in\r\nthis all night, and also during the day when resting. Wash the foot\r\nwith a little weak acetic acid, after being packed in the lather, to\r\nkeep it quite clean. Now rub the whole limb from the ankle upwards in\r\nsuch a way as to press the blood onwards in the veins. Use a little\r\noil, so that the skin may not suffer till a fine heat is raised in the\r\nwhole limb. This may be done for a quarter-of-an-hour twice or thrice a\r\nday. It relieves the heel of all congestion, and lets good arterial\r\nblood flow to it, as it would not otherwise. An elastic bandage, not\r\nvery tight, put on above the knee will help the cure. Sprained joints\r\nand muscles should have _perfect rest_ for a fortnight, and be used\r\nvery cautiously for some time longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring Trouble.--Many persons are distressed by some form of eruption\r\nor inflammation in the skin in spring. The change of atmosphere and\r\ntemperature at this time greatly increases the demands made upon the\r\nskin as an organ of perspiration, and this strain it is in many cases\r\nunable to stand--hence the trouble referred to. To prevent this, the\r\nskin must be brought into a better state of health and fitness for any\r\nextra work, so that it can bear without injury even very great changes\r\nof air and temperature. This may be done by regular application of soap\r\nlather (_see_ Lather and Soap) to the _entire_ skin each evening for\r\nthree or four days, and then twice a week through all the season. Good\r\nolive oil may be rubbed on before and after the lather, or even mixed\r\nwith it in rubbing on; if the cooling effect is found too great, two or\r\nthree thick coats of lather should be put on, and then gently wiped\r\noff, and the oil applied. This, continued during the later winter and\r\nspring, should entirely prevent eruptions. But if these do appear, or\r\nhave already come on, the irritation is apt to be so great that only\r\nvery fine and carefully made lather can be used. It is better then to\r\nuse _buttermilk_ instead of lather. But the BUTTERMILK (_see_) must be\r\n_new_, and if necessary weakened by addition of sweet milk; if old and\r\nstrongly acid buttermilk be used, harm may be done. Do not _rub_ the\r\nmilk on: _soak_ it into the parts by gentle _dabbing_ with a pad of\r\nsoft cloth. This done frequently, even twice or three times a day, will\r\nalmost always effect a cure.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that no amount of washing or bathing will do in\r\nthis state of the skin. Water somehow, especially hard water, fails to\r\nproduce this fine state of the surface. When spring trouble has set in,\r\nwe would keep water entirely from the skin. Nothing does so well as\r\ngood buttermilk. In some forms of spring eruption, a strong mixture of\r\nsalt and water may be freely applied with great advantage. If this\r\nirritates, it should at once be discontinued, but in many cases the\r\neruption will disappear under a few applications. The salt solution\r\nshould be gently rubbed on, and left to dry on the skin (_see_ Skin,\r\nCare of; Underwear).\r\n\r\nWith the increasing warm weather the body ceases to require as much\r\nfood as in the cold days. Heavy stimulating food in warm weather will\r\ncertainly cause an unhealthy skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSqueezing.--_See_ Rubbing.\r\n\r\n\r\nStammering.--This trouble is simply a loss of command of the vocal\r\norgans, and is distinctly _nervous_ in its cause. Especially must we\r\nlook to the _roots_ of the nerves controlling the vocal organs, if we\r\nare to see the real difficulty. There is evidently a state of\r\nirritability and undue sensitiveness in these nerves which must be\r\nsoothed down, if a cure is to be obtained. The roots of such nerves lie\r\nin the back of the head and neck, and they are best soothed by\r\napplication of soap lather (_see_ Lather; Soap). This must be well\r\nwrought, and applied warm to the back of the head and neck in three or\r\nfour coats. Then mix some _hot_ OLIVE OIL (_see_) with the lather, and\r\napply with the brush gently to the parts. Altogether, in applying the\r\nvarious latherings, and the final oil-and-lathering, an hour should be\r\nspent, so as to continue the soothing effect during that time. The head\r\nmay be soaped one night (_see_ Head, Soaping the), and this treatment\r\ngiven the alternate night. Where the case is of long standing, it may\r\ntake long to cure it, or a cure may be impossible, but some mitigation\r\nwill result from this treatment. The Sabbath should in all cases be a\r\nday of rest from treatment, and generally common sense will indicate\r\nthat it be not continued too long. The patient may do a great deal for\r\nhimself by the strictest watch on his enunciation, speaking slowly and\r\ndeliberately, and breathing deeply. This will be difficult to maintain\r\nat first, but practice will make the habit unconscious. An instrument\r\ncalled a metronome may be had from a music shop (used for keeping time\r\nin practising), if a book be read aloud by the stammerer, pronouncing\r\none syllable only to each beat, he will soon gain complete control of\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nStiffness, General.--This is often an adjunct of old age, and sometimes\r\noccurs in the young and middle-aged as the result of chills. In\r\n_neither_ case is it incurable, but for a cure _rest_ is a first\r\nnecessity. If there be standing and working for twelve or fourteen\r\nhours a day, we should not expect a cure at all. Rest must be had, at\r\nleast twelve hours out of the twenty-four, and it is well if sixteen or\r\neven eighteen hours' rest can be taken (_see_ Rest). Then there must be\r\nheating the spine with moist heat (_see_ Fomentation). This is done to\r\nrevive the organs which supply oil to the joints, by giving fresh\r\nvitality to the roots of the nerves which control these organs. But the\r\nheating requisite to do this must be gently and persistently applied.\r\nAn hour's gradual heating is worth far more than half-an-hour's\r\n_half-burning_. Then, after the spine fomentation, which must be\r\napplied in bed, rub (_see_ Massage) the back with hot olive oil for a\r\nconsiderable time--say half-an-hour, if the patient can bear it (_see_\r\nExercise). Then the joints may be similarly fomented and rubbed at\r\nanother time, back and joints being treated, say, every other day. If\r\nthere be costiveness, treat as in Constipation, and give easily\r\ndigested food (_see_ Assimilation; Digestion; Nourishment). Such\r\ntreatment daily should remove stiffness, even in very bad cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nStimulants.--_See_ Alcohol; Narcotics.\r\n\r\n\r\nStomach Trouble.--If you would cure thoroughly, you must first make\r\nsure that the skin is doing its part well. Very often indigestion\r\narises from irritation of the stomach, caused by the impurities in the\r\nblood which arise from defective skin action.\r\n\r\nWith strong people, exercise causing perspiration will often suffice to\r\ncure, in other cases where exercise cannot be had the Soapy Blanket\r\n(_see_) is effective. After the blanket, give a warm, gentle rubbing\r\nwith hot vinegar or diluted acetic acid; and, finally, a similar\r\nrubbing with warm olive oil. This rubbing may be given by itself, where\r\nthe patient is too weak to endure the blanket, or where the lather\r\ncannot be well applied. Even the rubbing with oil alone will do much to\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nThe problem in this case is to remove from the blood the irritating\r\nwaste which is inflaming the stomach, and this is better done by\r\ncleansing and stimulating the skin than by means of drastic drugs. A\r\nlazy man will swallow a peck of pills rather than go through an ordeal\r\nof cleansing like this, but in that case he need not be surprised if\r\nhis poor stomach become only poorer still, while his purse will not get\r\nany heavier. Besides this cleansing, take sips of hot water as\r\nrecommended under Indigestion. A very plain and sparing diet should be\r\ntaken, and great attention given to chewing all food till reduced to a\r\nliquid. For it must be remembered that the majority of stomach troubles\r\nhave their origin in abuse of this organ, through overloading with\r\nfood, or other dietetic errors. _See_ Diet; Assimilation; Biscuits and\r\nWater; Constipation; Cramp in Stomach; Diarrhoea; Digestion;\r\nFlatulence; Indigestion; Weariness.\r\n\r\n\r\nStomach Ulcers.--Generally the _tongue_ will tell whether the stomach\r\nis ulcerated or not. If the tongue is fiery-looking, and small ulcers\r\nshow themselves on it, while food produces pain in the stomach, there\r\nis little doubt of the presence of ulcers there. The tongue may at\r\nonce, in such a case, be brushed with weak acid (_see_ Acetic Acid) or\r\nvinegar, so as to cleanse the surface and produce a _gentle_ smarting.\r\nThis brushing will quickly produce a healing change in the tongue,\r\nwhich guides us to the cure of the stomach. This will be attained by\r\nswallowing teaspoonfuls of the same weak acid. Two or three of these\r\nshould be taken at intervals half-an-hour before food. If the case is\r\nsevere, the skin over the stomach must be carefully soaped, as directed\r\nin article on HEAD SOAPING (_see also_ Lather; Soap). The four-ply\r\nflannel BANDAGE (_see_) should also be worn. Do not use drugs, such as\r\niron, arsenic, or soda, and avoid all narcotics. Persevere with the\r\nweak acid, and a cure will come unless in very obstinate cases indeed.\r\nCare must be taken to avoid irritating food. Milk, or milk and boiling\r\nwater is the best diet. A general symptom is severe pain after eating,\r\nrelieved by vomiting.\r\n\r\nNo fluid should be taken hotter than the finger can be held in it. This\r\nis indeed a good rule always in matters of food and drink, which are\r\noften taken too hot, to the injury of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nStone.--_See_ Gravel.\r\n\r\n\r\nStoutness.--_See_ Breath, and the Heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrangulation or Hanging.--Often accidentally caused in children or\r\nintoxicated persons. Waste no time in going for or shouting for\r\nassistance. At once cut the rope, necktie, or whatever else causes the\r\ntightening. Pull out the tongue and secure it, commence artificial\r\nrespiration at once (_see_ Drowning), open the windows, make any crowd\r\nstand back.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Vitus' Dance.--This proceeds from a simple irritation of the spinal\r\nnerves, and is to be cured by soothing the spine with persistent\r\ncooling. In mild cases this cooling is easily applied with towels wrung\r\nout of cold water, and folded so as to lie at least four-ply thick\r\nalong the whole spine. If narcotic drugs have been largely used, and\r\nthe nervous system spoiled thereby, a severer form of the trouble comes\r\non, and requires a good deal of care and persistence in cooling. In all\r\ncases the cooling of the spine must only be done when the patient is\r\n_warm in bed_.\r\n\r\nIt will be of great importance, in carrying out this process, to use\r\nolive oil in such a way, all over the body, as to help in maintaining\r\nthe general normal heat. In addition to these suggestions, it may be\r\nwell to remark that the appearances in such cases are, as a rule, worse\r\nthan the reality. For instance, the motion of the eyes and of the\r\ntongue makes one imagine that the sufferer has lost all reason, and\r\neven consciousness of normal character. But this is not so; the brain\r\nmay not be affected at all, and the worst feeling is that of weariness.\r\nWe have seen a patient smiling through the most distressing\r\ncontortions--that is, most distressing to the ordinary observer. It is\r\nof great importance that any one who treats such cases should be _cool_\r\nand _kind_.\r\n\r\nIt will sometimes be impossible for one person to keep the patient in\r\nbed and covered with the clothes so as to keep warm. If so, two must do\r\nit. It is, however, to be remembered constantly, that the patient feels\r\nit much more agreeable to be held within even close limits than to be\r\nallowed to throw arms and legs, and head and body about in all\r\ndirections. This is a most invaluable truth in such cases. It will not\r\ndo to hold as with an iron grasp, so that no degree of movement is\r\nallowed; but you may hold softly, so that no motion, such as will even\r\ndisturb the bedclothes, shall take place. This must be done so that all\r\nthe body shall be comfortably warm when the cold towel is laid along\r\nthe spine and pressed gently to the centre of the back. In\r\ncomparatively mild cases, we give an hour of this cooling process every\r\nmorning only, and the warm washing and anointing with olive oil at\r\nbedtime; but in such cases as we sometimes meet with, where drugs have\r\ndone their mischievous work, it is necessary to cool much more\r\nfrequently. For instance, when the morning cooling has laid the\r\nirritation, and the patient is quiet for an hour, or, perhaps, only\r\nhalf-an-hour, the movement returns. The persons applying the cure are\r\nafraid to repeat it till another morning has come. But they need not be\r\nso. Or, they apply it for five minutes, and are afraid to continue it\r\nlonger. They may quite safely apply it as long as they can keep the\r\nrest of the body comfortably warm. If they can keep nice, soft blankets\r\nwell round the patient, as a rule it will not be difficult to keep up\r\nall general heat. Let us suppose that, when warm in bed and asleep, the\r\npatient wakes up, and the diseased movement begins; it will be well\r\nthen to ply the back with the cold towel. If the movement is perfectly\r\nstill in half-an-hour, a rest may be given. If the movement soon\r\nreturns, the cold can be applied till perfect quiet is had again. This\r\nwill, perhaps, be secured in twenty minutes or so. A rest and\r\ncomfortable warming may be given again. If the movement still returns,\r\nit may be met by the same cooling process again. If only the heat is\r\nkept up all right, the cold towel may be used till the spinal\r\nirritation is finally gone.\r\n\r\nThis simple mode of treatment we have found to be perfectly successful,\r\nnot only in removing every symptom of nervous irritation, but in giving\r\nmost vigorous health to patients who, to begin with, were truly\r\nmiserable-looking subjects. This may be looked for, as well as the mere\r\nremoval of the malady.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that one outstanding feature of St. Vitus' Dance is\r\nthat the movement ceases _during sleep_. If this is not the case, other\r\ntreatment is called for. _See_ Paralysis, and articles under Nerves;\r\nSpine, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunshine.--Is a most valuable aid to health, acting as a physical and\r\nmental tonic. The sunbath, for either portions of the body at a time,\r\nor for the whole body, will be found very beneficial to nervous\r\nsufferers, and also to those having a tendency to certain skin\r\ndiseases. Its tonic effect is very noticeable on the hair, giving it\r\nbetter growth and richer colour. Sunlight should be admitted freely\r\ninto bedrooms and sitting-rooms, for it is hostile to the growth of\r\nmany of those microbes which cause disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTapeworm.--The only sure sign of the presence of this parasite in the\r\nintestine is the passing from the bowels of some of its joints or ova.\r\nIts presence in the body is a serious matter, always giving rise to\r\nmore or less inconvenience and disturbance to health. We mention it\r\nhere because we know of a very good and harmless remedy which will\r\ncompletely expel the worm. This may be obtained from D. Napier & Sons,\r\nherbalists, 17, Bristo Place, Edinburgh, postage paid, for 2s. One dose\r\nwill be sufficient.\r\n\r\nWe dislike _secret_ preparations, yet when we come across a remedy\r\nwhich never fails, we confess to putting aside our dislikes and getting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe best thing is, however, to prevent the worm obtaining access to the\r\nbody. All food, especially beef and pork, should be thoroughly cooked,\r\nand all cooking processes, and all places where meat is kept should be\r\nthoroughly clean. Where this is the case, tapeworm will never occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nTea.--Tea should not be infused longer than three or four minutes, and\r\ncream should be used with it. The albuminous matter in milk tends to\r\nthrow down some of the tannic acid in an insoluble form. It should not\r\nbe taken too hot, and if taken at a meat meal (which is undesirable),\r\nnot till quite the conclusion of the meal. Much tea-drinking produces\r\nnervousness and indigestion. If taken _very_ weak it forms a pleasing\r\naddition to the morning and evening meal, but taken as it usually is,\r\nand especially between meals, such as at afternoon tea, it is a serious\r\ncause of ill-health.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeeth.--In order to prevent decay, the teeth should be carefully\r\nbrushed at least once a day, preferably at night, but better still\r\nafter each meal. There is no better dentifrice than pure soap, and\r\nM'Clinton's tooth soap, being specially prepared from the ash of plants\r\nand a pure vegetable oil, does not leave the objectionable soapy taste\r\nin the mouth which all soda soaps do.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of bad teeth is believed by many to be due to processes\r\nof milling, which remove the bone and enamel making properties of the\r\ngrain. So much of the natural salts of the grain are removed to make\r\nbread white that it ceases to be the staff of life. A contributory\r\ncause is the consumption of large quantities of sweets or candies,\r\nespecially between meals. White bread lodging in the teeth and thereby\r\nproducing acid fermentation, is believed to have a bad effect on them,\r\nalso too hot or ice-cold liquids. Remember also that the teeth cannot\r\nbe healthy if they are not exercised. The Scotch peasant when he ate\r\nhard oat-cake had splendid teeth, as the Swedish peasants who eat hard\r\nrye-bread still have. Sloppy foods hastily bolted will ruin the\r\ndigestion and thereby the teeth, besides depriving them of the work\r\nessential to their good condition. If teeth do decay they should be\r\nseen to by a dentist at once, as their presence in the mouth is\r\ninjurious to the general health.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeething.--At the outset, it must ever be remembered that this is _not_\r\na disease. It is a natural growth, and often is accomplished without\r\nany trouble at all. It is, however, a comparatively _quick_ growth,\r\naccomplishing much in a little time, as a plant in flowering. This\r\n_rush_ of growth in one place draws upon the vitality available for\r\ngeneral purposes in the child's body, and if this vitality is not very\r\nlarge, trouble ensues. Diarrhoea, cold feet, and lack of spirit and\r\nappetite thus arise. If at this stage the lower limbs and body be\r\ncarefully fomented (_see_ Fomentation), all trouble may cease at once;\r\nat least a very great deal will be done to relieve it. Give three\r\nteaspoonfuls of warm water, slightly sweetened with pure CANE SYRUP\r\n(_see_), three times a day. A little of the confection of senna will do\r\ninstead of this if desired. The fomentation must never be so hot or so\r\nlong at a time as to cause discomfort. Irritation is bad for a teething\r\ninfant, and all must be done soothingly if success is to be gained.\r\nAlso it will not do to foment and rub with oil a _feverish_ child. Such\r\ncases must be treated differently, as we shall see, and it is easy to\r\ndistinguish them from cases without fever. Meantime we would say that\r\nin many cases where vital force is low without fever, the treatment by\r\nfomentation as described is of great value.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the artificial \"cutting\" of the gum by surgical\r\ninstruments, we would say that such should only be resorted to when the\r\ntooth is very near the surface indeed, and by a careful surgeon who\r\nknows what he is about. The irritation in the gums which makes it\r\nthought of at all can be usually allayed by simple means. Let the\r\nmother dip her finger in good vinegar and water, just strong enough to\r\nslightly smart the lips, and rub it on the irritated gum. This can of\r\ncourse be done often, and is most powerfully soothing. It may indeed do\r\nall that is required. But if more general symptoms appear, such as\r\nsleeplessness and heat in the head, cooling of the head is required.\r\nHave two little caps made of _thick_ cotton cloth, one slightly larger,\r\nso as to fit on above the other on the child's head. Wring the smaller\r\nout of cold (but not ice-cold) water, and put it on. Press it gently on\r\nthe head, and if the heat and restlessness continue, cool it again,\r\nperhaps twice or three times. When the restlessness is relieved, leave\r\nthe damp cap on the head, and place the dry one on over it. If the heat\r\nreturns, repeat the process. This treatment, though a mere cooling of\r\nthe brain, has saved ere now both reason and life, and should never be\r\nlightly thought of or despised.\r\n\r\nOften the stomach is seriously disordered during teething, both\r\nvomiting and purging resulting. In small degree these are not\r\ndangerous, but they are better avoided. If severe, they are the\r\nbeginning of often fatal trouble.\r\n\r\nTo quiet the excited bowels, nothing is better than enemas of cool\r\nwater. It need not be too cold, but just a little under blood heat,\r\nwith a little vinegar added. One tablespoonful of vinegar to a pint of\r\nwater. Also a \"baby's bottle,\" prepared with water at blood heat (98\r\ndeg.), _without any milk or sugar_, will greatly assist the stomach if\r\ngiven to be sucked. In such cases infants usually suck this water\r\ngreedily. It is most soothing to the stomach. Half a teacupful at a\r\ntime is enough. In the evening wash the child with warm water and SOAP\r\n(_see_) rub all over with warm olive or almond oil, especially the back\r\nup and down. Then place a BRAN POULTICE (_see_) over all the back,\r\ntaking care to have it just comfortably warm. When this is fastened on,\r\nan ordinary pocket-handkerchief wrung out of cold water is folded and\r\nlaid over the bowels. This is changed for a fresh one as soon as\r\nheated, and _gently_ pressed all over. The milk, if the child is\r\nbrought up on the bottle, may be given now, reduced in strength for a\r\ntime. This treatment will often cure without enemas, which may then be\r\ndispensed with. Great improvement in health may be expected after a few\r\ndays of such treatment. A cool handkerchief, similar to that on the\r\nbowels, may also be applied to the head, if that is heated.\r\n\r\nSome form of head eruption often comes on after a long time of heated\r\nhead. A little sour buttermilk, vinegar, or weak acetic acid, not\r\nstronger than to cause a slight smarting _tried in the nurse's\r\nnostrils_, will relieve almost instantly the itching which accompanies\r\nthis. If strong acid be used, matters are made worse, and great pain\r\ncaused. The acid, weak as we have described, at once neutralises the\r\nirritating substance exuded from the eruption. It also prepares the way\r\nfor a cure. If astringent lotions are employed, drying the sore, and\r\ndriving it in on the brain, serious injury may be caused. But if\r\nhealing takes place under soaking with weak acid, no such result need\r\nbe feared, for this simply removes the unhealthy state of the part.\r\nWater, especially _hard_ water, must be absolutely kept away from such\r\na head. No more must be used than is necessary to dilute the acid; and,\r\nif it can be got, the acid of buttermilk is decidedly preferable. The\r\nwhole body, when feverish, may be cooled in a tepid bath, several times\r\na day if necessary, having the water just at blood heat.\r\n\r\nBesides these outside effects, teething often causes brain disorders.\r\n(_See_ various articles on Children.) The infant should be watched\r\ncarefully, and if the eye be dull, and the head heavy with feverish\r\nsymptoms, the head should be cooled at once as above directed, and if\r\nthe feverish symptoms are not marked, and the feet cold, the feet,\r\nlegs, and lower body should be wrapped in a good warm fomentation.\r\nWhere the trouble has gone so far that insensibility comes on, the\r\ntreatment is the same, only the cloths had better be wrung out of\r\n_iced_ water if available. It is important to not only lay the cloths\r\non the head, but to _press_ them. Take the little head in your two\r\nhands, and so bring the cool cloth close to every part of it, while you\r\nlift up a prayer for help from the Great Healer. Keep at this till your\r\nfeeling tells you it is time to change the cloth. Take off the hot one\r\nand put on the cool one. Go on with the gentle pressure again. It does\r\nrequire work, but it is well worth work to save a precious life. You\r\nmust so work that you will cause the least disturbance possible to the\r\nlittle sufferer. It may be you may require to keep this up for many\r\nhours, but you will probably find that some signs of sense appear ere\r\nyou have gone on very long, and you may see that natural sleep has\r\nsucceeded the drowse that lay in the worn-out brain. If so, you will\r\nallow the head to lie still in the cold cloth, and change only when it\r\ngets very warm. If natural heat has been fully restored to the legs and\r\nfeet, you will let these rest also.\r\n\r\nWe know of a case where the brain seemed gone, and the medical man\r\nabandoned hope; but the head was cooled with ice cloths, while the feet\r\nand legs were kept in a hot fomentation, for a whole night, and all\r\ndanger was passed by the morning. So that, even in very bad cases, this\r\nshould be perseveringly tried.\r\n\r\nFor diet, in teething, the child must get easily digested food, and all\r\n\"rich\" foods--brandy, beef-tea, etc.--must be avoided.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary starting, and the manifestation of great fear on waking out\r\nof sleep, frequently arise from irritation of the spine during\r\nteething. The cold compress applied along the spine when the child is\r\nwarm in bed will relieve this. It may be applied (_see_ Towels, Cold)\r\ntwice or thrice a day. If the feet are cold, these may be fomented at\r\nthe same time. If the head is cold, it may be fomented also. If it is\r\nhot, cool it. This treatment relieves the irritation of the mouth, as\r\nwell as removes the starting. If _both_ head and feet are hot, then you\r\nneed only cool the spine.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, common sense must be used, but we think we have given\r\nsufficient indication of principles to enable a thoughtful nurse or\r\nmother to treat successfully almost any case. Where very cold cloths on\r\napplication cause shivering and crying, either use tepid cloths,\r\nslightly cooler than the skin, or warm the _surface_ of the cold folded\r\ncloth by holding for a short time to a fire, and then apply to the\r\npatient. The warm surface thus first touches the skin, and afterwards\r\nthe cold in the body of the cloth penetrates gradually.\r\n\r\n\r\nTemperature (_see_ Heat, Internal).\r\n\r\n\r\nTempering Treatment.--Much, if not all, of the success in any case of\r\ntreatment depends on its being properly tempered to the strength of the\r\npatient. In putting on LATHER (_see_), for instance, a delicate and\r\nnervous child will be greatly annoyed if soaped all over at once. But\r\nif one arm be done and finished, then the other, then the breast, and\r\nso on to the abdomen, the back, and the legs, _bit by bit_, the effect\r\nwill be soothing in the extreme. So with MASSAGE (_see_); so also with\r\napplying a cold towel. If it chills and terrifies the patient when\r\nsuddenly \"clapped on,\" common sense would suggest holding it to the\r\nfire till the _surface_ is warm. This warm surface will give no shock\r\nwhen applied to the skin, and the cold in the body of the towel will\r\ngradually penetrate and do its work. Also, as we have frequently\r\nrepeated, the _strength_ of ACETIC ACID (_see_) must be carefully\r\nlooked to, when it is used. It must ever be remembered that some of the\r\nfinest and noblest spirits are inhabitants of frail bodies, which, with\r\nright treatment, are strong enough, but suffer terribly in rough hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirst.--This forms a severe feature in many cases of illness, and has\r\nto be treated variously according to its kind. It may be due first to\r\n_dryness_ in the membranes of the throat and stomach; secondly it may\r\nbe due to a _concentrated_ or _deranged_ state of the juices of the\r\nbody; thirdly, it may be the result of a _burning heat_ in the body. It\r\nwill not be difficult for a careful person to say in any case which of\r\nthem is the cause. The nature of the disease will indicate it. A little\r\ncold water may be given first. If this fails, a cold cloth over the\r\nstomach (_see_ Changing Treatment) may be tried. If these are not\r\nsuccessful, a few tablespoonfuls of hot water may be given. The first\r\nof these meets the simple dryness, the second cures the burning heat,\r\nthe third meets the case of concentrated and deranged juices in the\r\nbody. A few drops of vinegar, lemon juice, or other fruit acid (_see_\r\nDrinks), will often greatly assist the hot water in its duty. All\r\nalcoholic drinks are worse than useless in real thirst. Any power they\r\npossess is either due to the effect they have on the artificial thirst\r\nthey create or to the water they contain. And the danger of rousing or\r\ncreating the dreadful desire of the drunkard is so great, that they\r\nought never to be given to relieve a patient's thirst.\r\n\r\nIf the cold water is known, from any cause, to be dangerous to the\r\npatient, then hot water will do equally well. If the thirst arises from\r\nsome drug which has been taken, then hot water should always be given.\r\n\r\nAgain, the _locality_ of the dryness causing thirst indicates the best\r\nmethod of quenching it. If only the mouth and tongue be dry, then it\r\nwill be sufficient to wash out the mouth with the water, or acid drink,\r\nnot swallowing, so as to avoid unnecessary loading of the stomach. If\r\nthroat and mouth are cool, and only the stomach burns, then the cold\r\ntowel above that is the best treatment.\r\n\r\nThere is no need, except in very special cases, for iced water. Tap\r\nwater is generally cool enough, unless stored in heated cisterns. In\r\nthis case a little ice may be used to bring it down to a temperature of\r\n45 deg. or so, but not below 40 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroat Hoarseness.--This is best treated by a good large BRAN POULTICE\r\n(_see_) on the back of the head and neck. While the patient lies on\r\nthis, cold towels must be changed on the front above the \"apple\" of the\r\nthroat. Do this for an hour twice a day. Or, if the feet be cold, give\r\ntreatment as in Teething. There must also be _rest from talking_.\r\nProcure a good camel's-hair throat-brush from the druggist, and brush\r\nthe back of the throat well with weak ACETIC ACID (_see_) several times\r\na day, or simply gargle if there is difficulty with the brushing. The\r\nbrush must be carefully cleansed, and dipped in the _strong_ acid after\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nEspecially is it necessary to give up, in such cases, the use of\r\ntobacco. Where the trouble has lasted for years, it may be slow to\r\nheal, and the poulticing may be done only once a week. In ordinary\r\ncases, a day or two's treatment should cure.\r\n\r\nMany times we have seen a good fomentation of feet and legs alone give\r\nvery sensible relief. Never be satisfied with putting a hot bottle or\r\nbrick to the feet. This is a lazy way of dealing with a serious case.\r\nHave the feet and legs up to the knees rubbed with vinegar and olive\r\noil, and wrapped in a large blanket fomentation. It is not the mere dry\r\nskin of the soles of the feet that needs warming: the whole legs,\r\nespecially the muscles, require the moist heat of a thorough\r\nfomentation. Circulation is at once accelerated just where it is\r\nwanted, so as to lessen the pressure where the vital stream is pressing\r\ntoo heavily and lodging in a dangerous congestion. It is good even if\r\nthe feet are not very cold, but only cool, to ply this part of the\r\nremedy well. Where the patient is strong enough to sit out of bed, a\r\ngood hot foot-bath will do instead of this fomentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroat, Sore.--The first question in any case of sore throat, is, What\r\nis the temperature of the patient? (_see_ Heat, Internal). If this\r\ncannot be ascertained, at least we can say whether the patient is\r\nfeverish or not.\r\n\r\nLet us first take the case where there is no fever. Get the patient\r\nwarmly to bed. Foment (_see_ Fomentation) carefully all round the neck,\r\nfirst rubbing on a little olive oil. Renew the fomentation every five\r\nminutes for three-quarters-of-an-hour at least. Allow rest for an hour.\r\nThen foment thoroughly the feet and legs up over the knees. When this\r\nis done, and the heat kept up, cool the throat with constant fresh cold\r\ntowels. Let this go on for an hour. Finally sponge the whole body with\r\nwarm vinegar. Rub lightly over with olive oil, dry, and allow to rest.\r\nProbably the throat will be cured. If not, repeat the treatment the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nWhere there is fever with the sore throat, first make sure whether the\r\nfeet are hot or cold. If cold, put on fomentations as above. Even if\r\nthe feet are only cool this should be done. While the feet and legs are\r\nthus fomented thoroughly, change cold towels on the throat every three\r\nminutes for an hour. Sponge all over as above directed, and allow to\r\nrest. If the feet are hot, cold towels alone are applied to the throat;\r\nbut if the feet get at all chilled while such cooling is going on, they\r\nmust be fomented.\r\n\r\nIf there is vomiting and sickness along with the sore throat, the other\r\nsymptoms of scarlet fever should be looked for, and medical aid\r\nobtained if possible.\r\n\r\nBut here is a case where the most experienced eye, aided by the best\r\npossible instrument, sees nothing wrong in the throat itself, but the\r\ncough and difficulty of breathing point to the throat. The trouble is\r\nnot there, but in the roots of the nerves by which vital energy is\r\nsupplied to the windpipe and other vocal organs. You must go to the\r\nback of the neck, and to the back between the upper parts of the\r\nshoulders, and there affect the roots that are really in a state of\r\ndistressing over-action. If you are skilful enough in applying cold,\r\nand your patient has plenty of general warmth, you need nothing more\r\nthan a cold towel, changed pretty often, and nicely pressed over the\r\nproper parts. If this fails, have recourse to a cloth with mustard\r\nspread like thin butter on it, say about six inches broad and a foot\r\nlong. Lay this gently on the spine at the back of the neck, and down as\r\nfar as it goes. Apply your cold compresses now over this as well as you\r\ncan, and the violent spasmodic symptoms will be mitigated. If one trial\r\nis not sufficient, sprinkle the cold cloth with cayenne. If the result\r\ncan be reached by the cold cloth alone, it will be best. If mustard or\r\ncayenne must be applied, observe very carefully that they should never\r\ndistress the patient. As much as can be borne quite easily, and no\r\nmore, should be employed. Whenever a remedy becomes seriously\r\ndistressing, we may be pretty sure it has ceased to be remedial, for\r\nthe time at least.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroat, Sore (Clergyman's).--Those who are in the habit of using their\r\nvoice much should be very careful to produce it in the proper way. It\r\nis noticeable that actors (who learn to produce their voice properly)\r\ndo not suffer from what is known as clergyman's sore throat.\r\n\r\nThe voice in speaking should be pitched, as a rule, considerably lower\r\nthan is usually done, especially if speaking in public. Any tightening\r\nof the throat muscles should be avoided, and the voice sent out from a\r\nfull chest well expanded.\r\n\r\nThose who are musical should take a note on the piano enunciating the\r\nvowels in their natural order ([=a], ay, ee, o, oo) on this note. Then\r\nproceed to the next note; the whole of the octave may thus be gone\r\nover. Choose an octave most consonant with the range of the voice.\r\n\r\nThen add the consonants: b[=a], bay, bee, c[=a], cay, etc., etc. Thus a\r\nperfect command over all the possible combinations of vowels and\r\nconsonants may be attained.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no reason why any musical person should have an\r\nunmusical voice, especially since this bad production of the voice\r\noften strains the muscles and inflames the mucous membrane of the\r\nthroat. In connection with this question of music, it should be\r\nremembered that almost irretrievable injury to the voice may be done by\r\nallowing a boy to continue singing after his voice has begun to\r\n\"break.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not a good plan to be constantly \"clearing\" the throat whilst\r\nspeaking. One gets to imagine after a while that it needs clearing when\r\nit really does not.\r\n\r\nAlcohol and tobacco are both undoubtedly injurious to the voice. A\r\nlittle honey and lemon juice will be found the best gargle if a gargle\r\nis required.\r\n\r\nDeep breathing is of great assistance in endeavouring to produce the\r\nlower note, in fact it is not possible to produce a full note except\r\nfrom a full chest. In this connection it may be said that it has been\r\nobserved that deep-chested, deep-breathing, slow-speaking people are\r\nfrequently possessed of certain estimable points of character, such as\r\nprudence, firmness, self-reliance, calmness. If one is going to be\r\nangry, ten deep breaths might save a world of trouble. (_See_\r\nBreathing, Correct method of).\r\n\r\n\r\nThumb, Bruised and Broken.--Frequently a tradesman will strike the\r\nthumb or finger a serious blow with a hammer, in missing a stroke. If\r\nnot treated properly, the whole hand may be destroyed, but if promptly\r\nplunged into warm clean water and kept there, even the broken bones can\r\nbe handled quite comfortably, and all pain and uneasiness pass away ere\r\nvery long. Plenty of bathing in clean warm water, and proper setting\r\nand dressing, are all such an injury requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nToothache.--This trouble appears in two opposite characters. In the one\r\nit is cured by rightly applied heat, and in the other by cold. If it is\r\nmerely the soft substance in the tooth which is affected, local cooling\r\napplications will cure, if persisted in. If it be the nerve terminating\r\nin the tooth which is irritated, then even the extraction of the tooth\r\nmay fail to give relief. Both cold and hot applications to the tooth or\r\ncheek will then probably prove useless.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, apply COLD TOWELS (_see_) gently pressed over the head\r\nand back of the neck. If the case be a bad one, the feet may be put in\r\na hot bath, or fomented. Persevered in for an hour, this treatment is\r\nalmost certain to cure. It may take away all pain in a few minutes.\r\nAfter the pain is cured, dry well, and keep the head moderately warm.\r\n\r\nBut if the toothache is caused by a severe chill to the head, and that\r\nbe still cold, it should be packed in a hot fomentation. This gives\r\nalmost instant relief. Rub on a little oil when the fomentation comes\r\noff, and keep the head warm.\r\n\r\nIt should not be difficult to distinguish the cases requiring heat from\r\nthose requiring cold. In any case, if the first application of either\r\nincreases the pain, try the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowels, Cold Wet.--A towel of the ordinary kind, and full size, is\r\nsoaked in a basin of cold water and carefully wrung out until it is\r\nmerely damp. Prejudice against this treatment is often aroused by\r\nputting on the cloths wet, and in a slack, blundering way, so as to\r\nmake the patient most uncomfortable. It is then folded and applied to\r\nthe skin, as directed. While applying the first, a second towel may be\r\nin the water. It is then wrung out and applied, while the first is\r\nplaced to soak afresh. In prolonged cooling, care must be taken that\r\nthe water in the basin does not get too warm. It should be frequently\r\nchanged. The nurse should gently press the towels on the part,\r\nfrequently changing the position of her hands. They should not merely\r\nbe laid on, but gently pressed, unless this causes pain. The towels\r\nwill need to be changed when hot, and will take from two to five\r\nminutes to lose their cooling effect, according to circumstances. Where\r\ncold increases the patient's distress, it is almost always safe to\r\nsubstitute heat. _See_ Cooling in Heating; Fomentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTumours.--A large, soft, fleshy tumour is usually simply an\r\naccumulation of waste material, which should have been excreted from\r\nthe body if all the organs were in healthy working order. Where such a\r\nswelling exists, the first consideration is diet. For this, Barley\r\n(_see_) as chief food will do very well. Lemon and orange juice (_see_\r\nDrinks) should be the drinks. The barley must _not_ be cooked with\r\nmilk, and the drinks must be made with _pure water_. This plain diet\r\nwill help very much towards the removal of the tumour.\r\n\r\nThen the back should be rubbed (_see_ Massage) with hot olive oil twice\r\na day. This treatment alone has often removed the disagreeable\r\nswellings on the neck so often afflicting women.\r\n\r\nAlso, fine soap lather (_see_ Lather; Soap) should be gently rubbed\r\nrepeatedly over the tumour itself. This _alone_ we have known remove\r\ntumours, so it is important.\r\n\r\nThe three forms of treatment, all applied carefully, will cure all but\r\nvery obstinate cases. _See also_ Armpit Swelling; Hydrocele.\r\n\r\nWhere fibrous tumours exist, the treatment is to _douche_ cold water on\r\nthe part affected, while the rest of the body is kept warm. In case of\r\nsuch a growth in the abdomen, the patient sits in cold water, while the\r\nfeet are placed in hot water, and the whole body warmly wrapped in\r\nblankets. Cold water is then thrown against the spot where the tumour\r\nlies. If the tumour is discovered early, its growth may be entirely\r\nstopped by this means. Such treatment for several minutes twice a day\r\nhas in our own experience cured cases pronounced incurable. _See_ Sitz\r\nBath.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurnip Poultice.--Part of a raw turnip is grated down to a pulp. As\r\nmuch of this is prepared as will cover the inflamed part. It is put on\r\nnext the skin, and covered with a soft cloth. All is then tied nicely\r\nup in another cloth. In violent inflammation of the knee joint, this is\r\na most valuable soothing application. Placed on discoloured and\r\nshrivelled skin, it is marvellously curative. When applied, the patient\r\nmust be _thoroughly warm_. This warmth must be maintained while the\r\npoultice is on, as it has a powerful cooling effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphoid Fever.--_See_ Fever, Typhoid.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlcers.--An ulcer is an \"eating sore\": that is, a sore containing\r\nmatter which eats away the skin and flesh, thereby extending itself,\r\nand increasing in depth as well. To stop this diseased process, the\r\nvirulent matter in the ulcer must be killed or neutralised, and this\r\ncan usually best be done by means of vinegar or weak ACETIC ACID\r\n(_see_), which is most powerfully antiseptic. The only difficulty is to\r\navoid irritating the sore by the application of too strong acid. The\r\ntreatment by weak acid is very effective, but it must be a fairly\r\nprolonged and thorough soaking. Apply a little at a time to the sore.\r\nUse warm water if pain be caused. Continue the soaking for even an hour\r\nat a time, twice or even three times a day. The wound may be dressed\r\nwith good fresh olive oil after each soaking. Usually, nothing else\r\nwill be required, but it must be thoroughly done.\r\n\r\nIn a very severe case, mix in a teacupful of hot water as much\r\nsaltpetre as the water will dissolve. Add to this a teaspoonful of\r\nacetic acid, and use this to soak the sore instead of simple weak acid.\r\nThen, if healing does not come, it is probably because rest is not\r\ntaken, and most likely also because there is deficient vitality in the\r\nwhole system. Let the treatment with the lotion be given in the\r\nmorning. Secure rest during the day, and in the evening, for an hour,\r\nthoroughly foment the feet and legs up over the knees. Once a week for\r\ntwo weeks give the SOAPY BLANKET (_see_) instead of this treatment, and\r\nin the morning rub all over the body with hot vinegar. This powerfully\r\nstimulates the vitality of the whole system. Even a very bad ulcer\r\nshould give way under a careful course of united acid soaking, rest,\r\nand this stimulating treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnconsciousness.--There are two opposite causes of unconsciousness. One\r\nis congestion of the brain, the other sheer nerve exhaustion. Either\r\nwill produce a prolonged suspension of consciousness very different\r\nfrom a mere passing faint. In the case of congestion, the head will be\r\nhot and the feet cold. The cure is therefore at once seen to be to cool\r\nthe head and foment the feet in a hot blanket up to the knees. This is\r\nthe treatment usually to be given to young children. When aged people,\r\nor those much exhausted from any cause, become unconscious from lack of\r\nvitality, there will be rather a _general_ coldness, and no special\r\nheat in the head. We have seen such a case of \"coma,\" which had lasted\r\nfor forty-eight hours, come all right in ten minutes, by simply\r\nfomenting the back of the head and neck, and all down the spinal\r\ncolumn. Press a thickly-folded piece of flannel wrung out of hot water\r\ncarefully and gently over these parts, and often in a few minutes the\r\nmental power comes back. Care must be taken not to scald the patient.\r\n_See_ Fomentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderwear.--There is a common and very popular error, namely, that of\r\nputting too much clothing on our bodies, under the mistaken idea that\r\nadditional weight means additional warmth. The fact that the main\r\nobject of clothing is to preserve the natural heat of the body is lost\r\nsight of, and little attention is paid to the selection of proper\r\ngarments for wearing next the skin. Every day the skin of an average\r\nhealthy individual gives off so many pints of moisture, which must not\r\nbe allowed to settle on the body if health is to be maintained. After\r\nlong and exhaustive trials, we have come to the conclusion that the\r\nbest material for wearing next the skin is knitted linen, and the best\r\nknitted linen of the kind, and in fact, the only pure linen mesh\r\nmaterial which we have seen, is known as _Kneipp linen_, and can be\r\nobtained from all leading retailers and outfitters in this and other\r\ncountries. The name of the nearest agent may be had by sending a card\r\nto the Kneipp Linen Warehouse, 2 Milk St., London, E.C. In winter light\r\nwoollen underwear can be worn over the linen if desired, thus retaining\r\nthe hygienic advantages of the linen, as well as the warmth of the\r\nwool. As the wool does not touch the skin, it will not require frequent\r\nwashing, and so will not become felted up.\r\n\r\nLinen is the symbol of cleanliness, the priests of old, as we read in\r\nEzekiel, being commanded to wear it, and not wool or any garment\r\ncausing sweat.\r\n\r\nOur reason for specially naming Kneipp linen is that we know it is\r\n_pure linen_, whereas we know that what is sold as linen mesh is\r\nfrequently half linen and half cotton.\r\n\r\nLinen is the most absorbent material for underwear. It soaks up\r\nmoisture very rapidly, and dries with equal rapidity. Hence linen is\r\nalways preferred for towels and bandages. Those who use it for\r\nunderwear will not require to change the clothes after exercise, as\r\nthey would if wool were worn next the skin. The ordinary woven linen is\r\nclean but cold: Kneipp linen is so constructed as to be clean and warm.\r\nThis material retains air in its meshes, and a layer of dry air next\r\nthe body is the best method of preserving an even temperature, and thus\r\navoiding colds and chills, which are so prevalent in a climate such as\r\nours. Wool is entirely unsuited for wearing next the skin. It does not\r\nabsorb the perspiration rapidly nor radiate it freely, and after\r\nseveral washings it becomes felted, and in that condition is absolutely\r\ninjurious to health. It is the material par excellence for outer\r\nclothing, but all inner garments coming in contact with the body should\r\nbe composed of pure linen. (_See_ Skin, Care of).\r\n\r\n\r\nUric Acid.--This acid is found in persons of a gouty tendency, such\r\ntendencies being a great deal more common than is imagined.\r\n\r\nIt is really a waste product formed by the activity of the body cells,\r\nand should properly be mainly transformed into urea and so excreted. If\r\nit is not so transformed it accumulates in the blood and deposits in\r\nstony formations in different parts of the body, as in the joints,\r\nkidneys and bladder, causing very serious disease. Pure air and plenty\r\nof exercise will assist its transformation.\r\n\r\nIt is also taken into the body in various foods, particularly meat and\r\ntea, which are very rich in it or kindred chemical substances,\r\ntherefore, anyone having such a tendency should avoid these. The\r\nconsumption of sugar should also be limited. Avoid alcohol and use\r\nplenty of green vegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to a \"uric acid\" constitution is hereditary, and is\r\nprevalent among families who live high. Such should be continually on\r\nthe watch lest their diet should precipitate an attack. Water should be\r\nfreely drunk, and plenty of bathing with subsequent rubbing of the\r\nmuscles or massage is advisable.\r\n\r\nDrugs are to be avoided as they often result in painful heart\r\naffection, and besides do not strike at the real root of the disease.\r\n\r\nSoda or lithia water may be taken either with or without milk. Brine\r\nbaths may be taken when practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\nUrinary Troubles.--A healthy man usually evacuates about 30-40 ozs. of\r\nurine daily, the excretion being greater in the winter than in the\r\nsummer, owing to the checked perspiration. The urine should be of a\r\npale straw colour and transparent. Where any irregularity in the urine,\r\neither in quantity or quality, is suspected, it is wise to use soft\r\nboiled or distilled water only, for drinking, and to take frequent sips\r\nof it throughout the day, and especially early in the morning. Either\r\npure hot water, hot water and lemon juice, or whey, will help the\r\naction of the kidneys when this is sluggish.\r\n\r\nWhere the bladder is irritated and painfully sensitive, a large hot\r\nBRAN POULTICE (_see_) should be applied to the lower back. While the\r\npatient lies on this, cold towels (_see_ Towels, Cold Wet) should be\r\nchanged over the bladder in front. While giving such treatment once or\r\ntwice a day, _rest_ must be taken, if a cure is to be obtained. For a\r\npatient to say that rest cannot be had, is to say that cure is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a tendency to stoppage of the urine, a warm sitz-bath\r\nshould be taken. The patient first sits in three inches deep of\r\ncomfortably hot water. More water at the same temperature is poured\r\ngradually in at intervals, until it rises well up over the abdomen.\r\nThis will usually relieve even a bad case.\r\n\r\nTreat with bran poultice and cold towels, as above recommended, after\r\nthe warm bath has given relief. It should be remembered that the _cold_\r\nis the healing power, bracing the bladder and all its muscles and\r\nvessels. Hence more than a slight cooling is needed. But the cooling is\r\nonly possible when good heat is kept up on the base of the back. This\r\ntreatment also cures the swelling of the bladder which often\r\naccompanies restriction of urine.\r\n\r\nWhere a positive growth interferes with the urinary discharge, this may\r\noften be actually _melted away_ by soaking with weak ACETIC ACID\r\n(_see_), when it is at all possible to reach it. The power of cure\r\npossessed by acetic acid is incredible, except to those who have seen\r\nit exercised, and its persistent use would, we are use, save many\r\nlives, if people would only try it.\r\n\r\nWe would also advise the four-ply flannel bandage, with two plies damp\r\nand two dry. This round the body has a wonderfully soothing effect. So\r\nhas a nicely applied lathering with SOAP (_see_). As in most other\r\ntroubles, special care must be taken to keep the feet warm.\r\n\r\n\r\nVaccination Trouble.--When a child is suffering after vaccination, we\r\nshould have him gently rubbed all over--thrice at least with\r\nM'Clinton's soap (_see_ Lather). No one who has not seen this well done\r\ncan believe how blessed are its effects on an irritated skin. It\r\nsoothes incredibly. When thoroughly covered and covered again with\r\nwell-made lather of this soap, the child will sleep beautifully. We\r\nshould soap head and all, and let the little man sleep all night in the\r\nsoap. He may be sponged in the morning with weak vinegar and water to\r\nclean off the remains of the soap, if there are any. Now, there will\r\noccur a most important question: Is the child cold or feverish? If\r\ncold, then mix some good olive oil in your rubbing with the lather. If\r\nhot, use no oil. If cold, rub all over with warm oil before applying\r\nthe lather. It will make no difference, or next to none, if the disease\r\nhas broken out as a visible skin disease, only it will be necessary to\r\nuse the vinegar on the unbroken parts of the skin and not to distress\r\nthe child by painful smarting. The soap will not need to be so\r\nrestricted. That cures the most tender sores, and soothes in a\r\ndelightful way.\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetables, Green, and Fruit.--We would strongly recommend our readers\r\nto continually have these valuable foods on their tables. It is\r\npossible to obtain them in some form or other during the entire year.\r\nThey contain very valuable salts, which are of the greatest use in\r\npreventing disease. These salts are absolutely necessary for life, and\r\nthough found in other foods such as meat, are particularly abundant in\r\nthese vegetables. If cooked they must be carefully prepared, as the\r\nsalts are very soluble in water (_see_ Cooking). Vegetable salads and\r\nfruit salads are to be recommended. Those of gouty or corpulent\r\ntendencies will find these of especial use. By keeping the blood\r\nalkaline they are a preventive of many diseases. Spinach, cabbage,\r\nlettuce, and all the fruits offer a variety from which at each season\r\none may choose.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that common salt and salt such as bi-carbonate of\r\nsoda, do not adequately replace those food salts. Indeed,\r\nover-consumption of common salt is harmful, besides leading to\r\nunnatural thirst.\r\n\r\nFresh fruits and vegetables are always to be preferred to tinned ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nVeins, Swollen.--The swelling of veins in the leg is a very common\r\ntrouble, especially in middle and later life. At first this may cause\r\nno pain, one vein appearing as a little blue lump. Then as the trouble\r\nincreases, knots of veins seem to rise, especially below and behind the\r\nknee. Great pain follows, and sometimes the veins burst, causing bad\r\nsores, not easy to heal.\r\n\r\nAll this generally springs from _overstrain_ upon the limbs. Long\r\ncontinued standing, in circumstances otherwise unfavourable to health,\r\nis the usual cause.\r\n\r\nThis shows the primary necessity of _rest_. Let the patient lie down as\r\nmuch as possible, or at least sit with the sore limb or limbs supported\r\non a chair so as to be nearly level. If this can be done thoroughly,\r\nall work being given up for a month or so, a cure is not very\r\ndifficult. But where this rest cannot be had, an elastic band, such as\r\nis used by bootmakers to make strong boot gussets, about six inches\r\nbroad and one foot long, should be procured. Fasten this round _above_\r\nthe knee, well up the thigh. This will greatly help to relieve the\r\nblood pressure on the lower leg, and is better than elastic stockings.\r\nBefore these bands are slipped on, the leg should be well rubbed or\r\nstroked _upwards_, as described at the end of Circulation. This rubbing\r\nempties the swollen veins, and gives great relief.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a man with both legs full of swollen veins ready for\r\nbursting, and most painful, get on two such bandages, and go on digging\r\nand working with perfect ease, while the veins sensibly contracted with\r\nno other application. But it is not necessary nor wise to confine\r\nmedical measures to the use of such bandages. Rest is in some cases\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nEven where partial rest can be had, it is important to wear these bands\r\nand rub as described. But if possible, the patient should rest in bed\r\nfor one week. To restore power to the relaxed vessels, a large bran\r\npoultice should be applied across the haunches behind, rubbing olive\r\noil before and after. Apply this for fifty minutes each night during\r\nthe week in bed. Wear a broad band of new flannel over the parts after\r\nthe poultice. In the morning give the same treatment. If in a week the\r\nveins are not better, continue the treatment for another week. The\r\nelastic band is, of course, not worn in bed, but may be put on on\r\nrising as a security against relapse.\r\n\r\nWe have seen persons over sixty years of age completely cured in this\r\nway, when the necessary rest could be had.\r\n\r\nIf the _skin_ give signs, by dryness and hardness, that it is out of\r\norder, instead of treatment with the bran poultice, the SOAPY BLANKET\r\n(_see_) may be applied on the first night. The patient may on other\r\nnights be lathered with soap (_see_ Lather; Soap), and the soapy cloth\r\nworn on the back for a night or two, sponging all over with hot vinegar\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nWhere the veins by bursting have caused sores, treat with weak vinegar\r\nas directed for Ulcers, and after each acid soaking, bandage the whole\r\nlimb (putting lint on the sores and dressing them properly) with an\r\nordinary surgical bandage, just so tightly as to give relief, and not\r\ntight enough to cause any pain. Over-pressure injures. This treatment,\r\nwith the necessary _rest_, will in most cases effect a cure in a few\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nVomiting.--In many cases of severe illness, the stomach rejects all\r\nfood, and the patient comes near to dying of simple starvation. On the\r\nslightest nourishment being taken, retching and vomiting ensue, the\r\nstomach being irritated beyond all possibility of its doing its work.\r\nThis occurs in cancer and ulcers in the stomach, as well as in various\r\ndisorders and stomach inflammations.\r\n\r\n\"Rum and milk,\" \"claret,\" and all alcoholic drinks are most injurious\r\nin such cases, and should _never_ be given. To soothe the irritation,\r\nthe stomach should be soaped in the same manner as recommended in Head,\r\nSoaping the (_see also_ Lather). We have seen, even in very bad cases\r\nof cancer, such an application cause all retching to cease almost at\r\nonce. When this has been carefully and gently done, give exceedingly\r\nsmall quantities at first, of infants' food, or milk and boiling water.\r\nTo give any \"rich\" things is a fatal mistake. Oatmeal jelly may be\r\ngiven also, but beginning with a teaspoonful at a time (_see_\r\nAssimilation; Digestion; Nourishment). By gradually working up the\r\namount, a patient's life may be saved on this simple oatmeal jelly\r\nwhich would be lost if richer things were given. Often the stomach\r\nrejects food simply because it is surfeited. It may be that the liver\r\nis out of order, having had too much to do. Abstinence from food for a\r\nday or two, and then reducing the meals to two, taken, say, between 10\r\nand 11, and 5 and 6 o'clock, will greatly help. Masticate the food till\r\nit is reduced to a liquid, in this state the quantity required will be\r\nwonderfully reduced and the work of the stomach lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater, Hot.--The frequent prescription in these papers of hot water, to\r\nbe taken often in small quantities, makes it of importance that some\r\nexplanation of its action should be given.\r\n\r\nWe see, frequently, such a thing as this: a person is confined to bed,\r\nsick and ill; there is no desire for food, but rather a loathing at the\r\nvery idea of eating; distressing symptoms of various sorts are showing\r\nthat the work of digestion and assimilation is going on badly, if\r\nreally going on at all. The patient is started on a course of hot water\r\nin half-teacupfuls every ten minutes. When this has gone on for perhaps\r\nsix or seven hours, he begins to be very hungry, and takes food with\r\nrelish, probably for the first time for months past. In the meantime a\r\ngreatly increased quantity of water has passed from the body one way\r\nand another, but has all passed loaded with waste material. The breath\r\nis loaded with carbonic acid and other impurities; the perspiration is\r\nloaded with all that makes it differ from pure water; the urine,\r\nespecially, is loaded with waste separated from the blood and tissues\r\nof the body. The space, so to speak, left vacant by all this washing\r\naway of waste matter makes its emptiness felt by a call upon the\r\nstomach to furnish fresh material. Some will say that the hot water\r\nmerely passes off by the kidneys without entering the circulation at\r\nall. This is impossible, and facts, patent to everyone, demonstrate\r\nthat they are in error. The substances with which the water becomes\r\nimpregnated show that it has been mingled with the circulation, and the\r\nwholesome effects produced prove that it has made itself useful.\r\n\r\n\"Hard\" water, as it is called, will not do so well as \"soft\" water.\r\nDistilled water is best of all. So much superior is it, indeed, that\r\nits use cannot be too strongly insisted on. It can be had from the\r\ndruggist at twopence per quart.\r\n\r\nWhere nourishment is given with too little water, the food will often\r\nfail almost entirely to enter the circulation. But a little warm water,\r\nsomewhat above blood heat, but not too hot, will make all right. This\r\nis especially seen in nourishing infants (_see_ Infants' Food). Food,\r\nthen, will not act as water does, nor will water act as food. Even a\r\nlittle sugar mixed with the hot water completely alters its effect on\r\nthe body. As it has already dissolved the sugar, it cannot dissolve\r\nwhat is needed to be removed from the body. Sugar and water is not a\r\n_bad_ mixture, but it will by no means do instead of pure water in the\r\ncases we contemplate. On the other hand, a mixture of alcohol with the\r\nwater is ruinous, and that just in proportion to the quantity of\r\nalcohol, small or great. Beer, for example, can never do what is\r\nrequired of water, nor can wine, or any other alcoholic drink. Tea\r\nadded to the water also alters its quality. The water _alone_, and as\r\nnearly perfect in purity as it can be got, is the only thing which will\r\ndo the necessary work.\r\n\r\nSometimes one finds a great prejudice against hot water. You see one\r\nwho is miserable through derangement of the stomach and digestive\r\norgans, and you mention \"hot water.\" The very phrase is sufficient to\r\nput an expression of strong prejudice on the face. Yet that very hot\r\nwater is perhaps the only thing that will cure the patient. If you wait\r\na little, there will be an opening to explain that hot water is very\r\ndifferent to tepid water. Under blood heat, and yet heated, water tends\r\nto produce vomiting; above blood heat, nothing will so well set the\r\nstomach right. This is true, however, only when the water is taken in\r\nvery small quantities. You must see that the water is not smoked in the\r\nheating or otherwise spoiled. And also that it be not too hot. If it\r\nscalds the lips it is too hot. When it is comfortably warm, but not\r\ntepid, it does its work most effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater for Drinking.--Every care should be taken to have drinking water\r\nabsolutely pure. Diarrhoea and many infectious diseases may be conveyed\r\nby impure water. In gouty cases as much water should be taken as\r\npossible (provided the heart is sufficiently strong) in order to wash\r\naway the waste matter. The same applies to fevers. If there is a\r\nsuspicion of water being contaminated mere filtration should never be\r\nrelied on, the water should be boiled.\r\n\r\nAfter many of the treatments given by us in this book, considerable\r\nthirst will be experienced. Cold water in such cases may always be\r\ngiven. In fact, in any internal congested condition cold water will\r\nstimulate the nerves of these organs, and make them act on the blood\r\nvessels. In all cases where drugs, especially mineral drugs have been\r\nrecklessly indulged in, cold water should be taken in abundance. Care\r\nmust be taken, however, not to unduly stimulate the circulation or\r\nnervous system, and any signs of this, such as headache or want of\r\nsleep indicate the curtailment of the amount drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater in the Head.--In cases where this trouble is suspected, very\r\noften there is nothing wrong but a more or less congested state of the\r\nbrain, owing to some severe chill or some disease elsewhere in the\r\nbody. There may be violent heat in the head, and even the \"drowsiness\"\r\nwhich is so serious a symptom, without any real \"water in the head\" at\r\nall. Leeching and blistering in such a case are grave mistakes. Cold\r\ntowels (_see_ Towels, Cold Wet), or a gentle pouring of cool water on\r\nthe head, will often be sufficient to remove all trouble. We have seen\r\na bad case of brain congestion cured and consciousness return almost\r\nimmediately after the pouring had begun. The feet also may be fomented\r\n(_see_ Fomentation). The cold towels and pouring may be used\r\nalternately on the head, which will give a more powerful effect. Let\r\nthe water poured be almost lukewarm, a little under blood heat. There\r\nis no need to cut the hair, or use any acid or drug in the water. The\r\n_cooling_ is all that is needed. Incipient water in the head may in a\r\nvery large number of cases be checked and cured by the same treatment.\r\nIt can do no harm in any case, and has saved many lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater on the Chest.--Sometimes a large watery swelling appears in one\r\npart or another of the chest. It is practically a bag of liquid waste,\r\ndue to deficient action on the part of the kidneys or skin. Treatment\r\nshould be given as recommended in Dropsy, and, besides, the four-ply\r\nmoist flannel bandage should be worn over the skin. This will in many\r\ncases speedily effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness.--Often there follows, after the cure of an inflammatory\r\ndisease, very great weakness. This in itself is sometimes a great\r\ndanger, but can usually be removed by proper care and nursing. The\r\ncommon method of administering wine, brandy, or other alcoholic liquor,\r\nis the very worst that could be adopted. Hot water will prove a\r\nvaluable stimulant, when a stimulant is required. Any NOURISHMENT\r\n(_see_) to be given should also be just a little warmer than blood\r\nheat. For drink, the unfermented wine made by Frank Wright, Chemist,\r\nKensington, London, is of great value. It is simply the pure juice of\r\nthe grape. If milk be given, it should always be diluted with an equal\r\nbulk of boiling water. The fomentation of the feet and legs will\r\ngreatly help in restoring vigour. This should be done gently at first,\r\nwhere the weakness is great. Afterwards, when the patient can bear it,\r\nthe ARMCHAIR FOMENTATION (_see_) will be found serviceable. All this,\r\nof course, is on the assumption that only _weakness_ and no fever is\r\nthe trouble. Where fever is present, other treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\nSponging all over with warm vinegar is also a most invigorating thing.\r\nDo this once, and afterwards the treatment may be varied by the real\r\nstimulant of cayenne being used in the form of an infusion strong\r\nenough to rouse the nerves, as is done by the acid. This has the\r\nadvantage of saving the skin, if that is tender, and keeping off\r\neruption, which is apt to come if the acid is often used. We think it\r\nwell to use the acid once or so, and the cayenne infusion as frequently\r\nas anything of the kind is required. Rubbing with olive oil is also\r\nmost beneficial. But both must be done very cautiously where there is\r\ngreat weakness. To rub the whole body at once will then be too much.\r\nBut it may be done bit by bit, stopping whenever fatigue or chilliness\r\nis felt by the patient. _See also_ Heat and Weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaning.--Many of the troubles which come in this process arise simply\r\nfrom ignorance or want of thought on the part of the nurse or mother.\r\nSometimes the child, having been burned with a hot teaspoon, will\r\nafterwards refuse all that is offered in such a spoon. In such a case\r\nuse an egg-spoon of bone, or a small cup. Sometimes spoons of various\r\nmetals, having peculiar tastes, are used, and the child refuses them.\r\nWhen food is refused, it is well therefore always to see that it is not\r\nthe spoon or dish which is the real reason.\r\n\r\nAgain, food ill-fitted for the child's digestion is offered. In this\r\ncase the child is doing the right thing in refusing it. Milk and hot\r\nwater, in equal quantities, with a very little sugar, is a mixture\r\nwhich can always be given with safety. In weaning, the nurse should\r\nbegin by using this alone. Gradually a very little thin oatmeal jelly\r\nmay be added, and the strength of the mixture increased. If there\r\nshould be indigestion, a few teaspoonfuls of hot water will usually\r\ncure it. If the bowels are inactive, mix a little pure CANE SYRUP\r\n(_see_) with the food. Avoid all drugs as far as possible. If the whole\r\nprocess be _gradual_, there will usually be little or no trouble with\r\nthe child. If, where teething and weaning are both coming together, the\r\nchild should be seized with chill and shivering, a good blanket\r\nFOMENTATION (_see_) may be wrapped round the body and legs. Dry after\r\nthis, and rub with warm OLIVE OIL (_see_). Generally this will induce\r\nsleep, in which case leave the child _warm_ in the fomentation until it\r\nawakes (_see_ Teething).\r\n\r\nIn weaning, the mother often suffers as well as the child. The supply\r\nof milk in the breast being over-abundant, the breasts become hard and\r\npainful, and feverishness comes on. In this case the breasts must be\r\nemptied, either by some other person, or by the various ingenious\r\ninstruments sold by all druggists. Then a large, cold damp cloth should\r\nbe placed over the emptied breast, and changed once or twice, rubbing\r\nafterwards with a little olive oil. This, in ordinary cases, will cause\r\nthe flow of milk to cease. Where the swelling is very hard and almost\r\ninflammatory, the breast should be fomented for five or ten minutes,\r\nthen emptied, and a cold cloth applied as above directed. If all this\r\nfails, a BRAN POULTICE (_see_), or hot bag with moist flannel covering,\r\nshould be applied between the shoulders. While the patient lies on\r\nthis, cold towels (_see_ Towels, Cold Wet) should be changed on the\r\nbreasts. This will usually effectually stay the secretion of milk. This\r\nlast treatment is rarely required, but is harmless and most efficient.\r\n\r\nWhere mother and child are both sickly, weaning must be carefully\r\nconducted. But it must ever be remembered that a child is far more\r\nhealthily nourished on a bottle of good cow's milk or condensed milk\r\n(of _first-rate quality_) than on a sickly mother's milk. This is the\r\ncase even if the child be ill. Only let the bottle not be too strong.\r\n_See_ Children, numerous articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeariness.--Where persistent weariness is felt, and the least exertion\r\nbrings on a feeling of lassitude, there is evidently an undue\r\nexhaustion of nerve force in the body. Too rapid action of the heart is\r\na frequent cause. In such a case all exciting ideas and influences\r\nshould be kept from the patient's mind, and rest taken. The heart's\r\naction should also be reduced by careful lathering with soap (_see_\r\nLather; Soap). Where the weariness is really serious, great care must\r\nbe exercised, and treatment very gradually administered. Rest must be\r\ngiven whenever exhaustion shows itself (_see_ Heat and Weakness;\r\nWeakness; and articles on Nerves and Nervousness). Where the heart's\r\naction is very slow, and requires to be stimulated, REST (_see_) must\r\nbe taken, and treatment given as recommended in the case elsewhere.\r\n_See_ Depression.\r\n\r\nIn other cases we find weariness arising from an irritated state of the\r\nstomach. Where there is no particular nerve exhaustion, the fiery and\r\ninflamed state of the stomach membranes forbids sleep, and causes a\r\ngreat feeling of tiredness. Headache (_see_), and even fainting fits,\r\nsometimes come on in such a case. All the nerves are excited, so that\r\neven touching the head or skin is most painful. Yet all can be traced\r\nto an inflamed stomach as the cause. Such a case, to be successfully\r\ntreated, requires considerable resolution. In one case the treatment\r\nwas as follows: First, the feet and legs up to the knees were wrapped\r\nin a large FOMENTATION (_see_). A cold wet towel was then folded\r\nlengthwise so as to be four-ply thick. The end was laid on the stomach,\r\nand _gently pressed_. In about half-a-minute it was hot. The towel was\r\nthen shifted so that a fresh cool part lay over the stomach, and so on\r\nthroughout the length of the towel. Handfuls of finely-wrought soap\r\nLATHER (_see_) were then prepared and laid on the stomach. Then the\r\ncold cloth was again renewed on top of the lather. For _two hours_ this\r\nwas continued, and by that time the worst symptoms had abated. A little\r\nfresh oil gently rubbed over the stomach completed the treatment for\r\nthat time. When the heat again arose, the same treatment was repeated,\r\nand so on till a cure was effected. Five or ten minutes' cooling would\r\nhave been utterly useless. The heat evolved in the stomach required two\r\nhours steady cooling, and might have required more. The feelings of the\r\npatient are ever the best guide in such a case. As long as the cooling\r\nfeels \"delightful\" it may safely be continued, if the heat to the feet\r\nis kept up.\r\n\r\nIf the weakness is very great, it may be necessary to keep to milk and\r\nhot water, such as an infant would thrive on, for a short time. If the\r\nweakness is not so great, it will be possible for the patient to take a\r\nlittle gruel or porridge made from wheaten meal, and also good fresh\r\nbuttermilk. The stomach may be far from ready to take eggs and such\r\nthings, but quite able to digest the \"poorer\" food, as it is often\r\ncalled. To give the really weak as perfect rest of mind and as easily\r\ndigested food as possible, are conditions that must not be overlooked\r\nif we would be successful in their cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Leg.--When a limb becomes swelled and white, pouring hot water\r\nvery gently over it with a sponge or cloth will have a blessed effect.\r\nIt may be continued for an hour at a time for several times. If this\r\nceases to be comforting, it should be discontinued and the limb dressed\r\nwith warm olive oil, a soft cotton rag being put next the skin, and\r\nsoft flannel above that. Of course absolute rest should be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhooping Cough.--The cough is a spasmodic action of nerves which are\r\notherwise healthy enough, so that when the violent action ceases, the\r\nchild's health is much as usual. Any irritation of nerves or temper\r\nwill, however, bring on an attack, and should therefore be avoided, and\r\nall soothing mental influences should be encouraged. Three or four\r\nteaspoonfuls of hot water taken frequently, and given whenever an\r\nattack comes on, will give great relief. We have ourselves seen a child\r\nthought to be dying relieved at once by nothing more than this.\r\nTherefore it should never be neglected as too simple.\r\n\r\nAlso the feet should be bathed once in two nights (_see_ Bathing Feet)\r\nin warm water (not too hot), dried and rubbed gently with olive oil. On\r\nthe night when the feet are not bathed, let the back be lathered with\r\n_warm_ lather (_see_ Lather; Soap), quickly dried off, and then a\r\nlittle olive oil _gently_ rubbed on.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases, this will be sufficient to ward off all danger in\r\nthe disease, but in severer attacks the feet and legs may be fomented\r\n(_see_ Fomentation) while the child is in bed, and cold towels changed\r\nalong the spine while the fomentation remains on, so as to lower the\r\nnerve action over the main centres. This is best done in the morning\r\nbefore the patient arises. If anything like inflammation sets in in any\r\npart of the chest, treat as recommended in Bronchitis or Lungs,\r\nInflammation of.\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, all causes of irritation to the patient must be\r\nremoved or avoided. In the time of whooping cough, the sunniest way of\r\nmanaging the child is the best.\r\n\r\nThe other children, if any, in the house, should have the footbath and\r\noil, and the back wash, as recommended above. This will lessen danger\r\nof infection, and make the attack lighter if they should take it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorms.--Where the juices and organs of the body are thoroughly healthy,\r\nworms will not appear. Before they can breed, there must be more or\r\nless of failure in the patient's health. This shows us that the cure\r\nfor worms is not so much some poisonous substance which will destroy\r\nthem, as such an increase of healthy action in the system as will\r\nprevent their development. The bowels must be kept open by suitable\r\ndiet as it is most important to avoid Constipation (_see_). In case of\r\nworms in children, stimulus and help are specially needed by the\r\n_mucous membrane_ or inner lining of the stomach and bowels. To give\r\nthis, and at the same time to neutralise and remove waste material from\r\nthe membrane, a little vinegar and warm water may be frequently given,\r\nin teaspoonfuls. This is best taken from an hour to half-an-hour before\r\nmeals. It is often needful to use some soothing, nourishing substance,\r\nsuch as liquorice, boiled with a little camomile, taken, say after\r\nmeals, while the acid is taken before them: this has an excellent\r\neffect. At the same time, an enema of warm water and vinegar should be\r\ngiven twice a day. Where Santolina (_see_) can be procured, its use\r\nwill speedily effect a complete cure. Change of air, holiday from\r\nlessons, and any other means of increasing the general health, should\r\nalso be utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorry.--One of the most fruitful causes of ill-health is the habit of\r\nworrying. Many believe this to be unavoidable, and think it even an\r\nevidence of interest in their work or of consideration for their\r\nfriends. But this is not real interest or real consideration. The\r\nperson who faces the work of the moment without anxiety for the future\r\nor useless regret for the past will accomplish his task before the\r\nharassed careworn man has thought out how to begin it. It is not work\r\nthat kills but worry. Illness is frequently brought on by worry. Worry\r\nwrinkles the face, makes us look old before our time, often makes us\r\nsour and disagreeable, always makes us more or less wanting in true\r\npoliteness, and is socially a great handicap to a man, a much greater\r\nto a woman. Further, worry not only prevents cure but kills, and\r\nnothing will help us more in recovering from illness than a calm,\r\ncontented spirit.\r\n\r\nNow the first thing to do to overcome this habit is to realise that\r\n_worry is a bad habit which it is quite possible to get rid of_. The\r\nproof of this is that thousands of people for years slaves to it have\r\ngot rid of it. Through some means or other they have been brought to\r\nexercise their will power and have found, sometimes to their\r\nconsiderable astonishment, always to their inexpressible relief, that\r\nthey have regained a lost mental power and that their efficiency as\r\nworkers has been enormously increased.\r\n\r\nIf any matter needs much thought, devote thought to it, reflect and\r\nweigh carefully. If it requires time, take it up at separate times.\r\nOnly make up your mind to this one thing, that you are the master and\r\nthe arbitrator as to when it shall be taken up. If it intrudes, dismiss\r\nit as you would a servant from the room when you no longer require his\r\npresence. It is bound to go when you do so dismiss it. When you summon\r\nit to your consciousness concentrate your mind upon it. Want of\r\nconcentration, being a dissipation of the mental powers, is a cause of\r\nworry.\r\n\r\nWorry becomes doubly baneful when it is directed towards the \"might\r\nhave been.\" Legitimate regret should be an emotion always accompanied\r\nby the determination to learn by experience. Every aid to enable the\r\ndispossessed will to regain its rightful throne should be employed.\r\nProperly chosen books, companions, and surroundings, are of great use,\r\nbut perhaps quiet persistent self culture of the will, will be found to\r\nbe the best. It matters little whether you call this \"self suggestion\"\r\nor not. As a matter of fact it is simply the common-sense of the\r\nquestion. It is the making up of the mind to do a thing with certain\r\naspirations, emotions, and desires towards this thing. Thousands of\r\npeople do it every day, especially in religious matters. It needs an\r\nadequate motive or a great ideal to carry it out. Such a motive here,\r\nmight be the realisation of the uselessness and the positive harm of\r\nworry. Actually realise this, then affirm your determination to avoid\r\nworry and you have well begun the battle. Go through this mental\r\nexercise each time you feel you are worrying again. After a while you\r\nmay omit it all but the mental determination.\r\n\r\nThe mind cannot act rightly in an unsound body, and there is no doubt\r\nthat good health wards off worry. Deep breathing of fresh air by\r\nproducing well oxygenated pure blood, will do much to restore mental\r\nbalance, especially if this want of mental balance is, as is often the\r\ncase, partly due to inattention to the laws of health.\r\n\r\nWorry is by no means a necessary concomitant of high civilisation, it\r\nis rather an accompanying mental disease due partly to low nerve power,\r\nwhich itself is due to erroneous methods of life--errors of diet, want\r\nof pure air, cleanliness, exercise, etc. Partly, too, is this low nerve\r\npower due to mental causes peculiarly Western. The _Asiatic_ with his\r\npower of concentration, reflection, contemplation, with his patience,\r\nendurance, calmness, knows nothing of this scourge of European and\r\nAmerican life. Even the Japanese, progressive and efficient as they\r\nare, possess this native contented, sweet, calm disposition, a habit of\r\nmind which, if they can retain, will be of enormous value to them in\r\ncoming years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds, Bleeding of.--After sending for a surgeon the first thing to be\r\nlooked at in case of any wound is the bleeding. Sometimes this is\r\ntrifling and needs no particular effort to staunch it. When, however, a\r\nvein or artery has been lacerated the flow must immediately be attended\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIf the blood be welling up from the wound and of a dark red colour it\r\nis venous blood, if it spurt up from the wound and be of a bright red\r\ncolour it is arterial blood. What has to be done is to place a pressure\r\non the vein or artery to prevent the blood escaping.\r\n\r\nVenous bleeding may generally be stopped by putting a pad of lint\r\ndipped in cold water on the wound and tying it on with a bandage. If\r\nthe blood continues to flow, tie a bandage round the limb on the side\r\nof the wound _away_ from the heart and keep the limb raised.\r\n\r\nArterial bleeding must be treated by tying on the pad and bandage, and\r\nif the bleeding continues, stopping the flow in the artery on the side\r\nof the wound _nearest_ the heart, and at some point where it passes\r\nover a bone so that pressure may be efficiently applied. The bandage\r\nfor thus tying an artery may be simply made by knotting a handkerchief\r\n(Diagram IV.), putting something solid inside the knot, then placing\r\nthe knot on the artery at the desired point and tying tightly. If\r\nrequired this may be tightened by putting a stick under and twisting\r\nround, then tying the stick in position (Diagram II.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. I.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. II.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. III.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. IV.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. V.]\r\n\r\nIf the palm of the hand is cut, put a pad inside the hand, close the\r\nfingers, and tie the bandage round the clenched fist.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is in the forearm, put a pad in the bend of the elbow, and\r\ntie the forearm firmly up on the arm. If the wound is above the elbow\r\nstop the main artery in the way above indicated. This artery runs\r\npretty well under the inner seam of the sleeve of a man's coat. Diagram\r\nI. shows how this artery may be stopped by direct pressure of the hand;\r\nDiagram II. how a tourniquet may be applied.\r\n\r\nFor bleeding in the arm-pit, press in a pad and tie the arm down to the\r\nside. It may be necessary here to compress the artery with the thumb.\r\nThe artery here lies behind the inner bend of the collar bone lying on\r\nthe first rib.\r\n\r\nIn case of arterial bleeding about the head apply the bandage as in\r\nDiagram III. The pressure is here applied right over the wound, as the\r\nskull is always behind on which to press the artery.\r\n\r\nA wound in the leg should be treated in a similar way to a wound in the\r\narm. Diagram V. shows the stopping of bleeding above the knee.\r\n\r\nDo not remove the pressure until the arrival of a medical man.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds, Ill-Smelling.--For all such wounds, the best method is frequent\r\ncleansing with vinegar or dilute ACETIC ACID (_see_) by means of a\r\nsmall glass syringe, such as may be got at any druggist's (_see_\r\nAbscess; Wounds, Syringing). We know one case where the patient was\r\nexpelled from a curative home because of the evil smell of his wounds,\r\nthree careful cleanings out with dilute acid so removed all odour that\r\nthe patient was at once readmitted. Where the wound is very tender,\r\nsoak soft cloths or lint in the dilute acid, and lay them on the wound\r\nthree or four ply thick. Remove and renew them every quarter-of-an-hour\r\ntill the smell is gone. Of course the cloths should be immediately\r\nwashed or, better, burned. In using the syringe, care should be taken\r\n_to suck out_ the ill matter, as well as to send the dilute acid well\r\ndown into the sore. Careful cleaning of the syringe with _boiling_\r\nwater before use is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds, Soothing.--During the process of _healing_, wounds often give a\r\ngreat deal of pain, even when all is going well. It is this pain we\r\nhere show how to relieve. After an operation under chloroform, itself\r\npainless, the process of healing is often very painful. We are sure\r\nthis pain need not be endured, but to prevent or cure it we need to see\r\nwhat is its cause. Two causes are specially notable--_pressure_ and\r\n_cold_. By skilful handling and bandaging, undue pressure may be\r\navoided by the surgeon. But a great deal can be done by any one to keep\r\ncold from the seat of injury. Have a bag of soft flannel, as fine as\r\npossible, made so as to surround the wounded part. This bag is filled\r\nwith _dry_ bran, heated in an oven or otherwise, without being wet. Of\r\ncourse the heat must not be great enough to cause any discomfort, but\r\nsufficient to give a fine sense of relief. This application is for a\r\nwound which has _not_ become inflamed, but is doing well.\r\n\r\nWhen inflammation has set in, and the patient is fevered, the opposite\r\ntreatment is applied. Over the dressing apply three or four folds of\r\ndry cotton cloth, and over this again apply cold towels (_see_ Towels,\r\nCold Wet) until the pain is relieved. Good sense must regulate this\r\ntreatment, of course, and excess of cold be avoided. But with ordinary\r\ncare this need never cause anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds, Syringing.--Very great good can often be done by a little\r\ncareful syringing of internal wounds. Take, as an illustration, a case\r\nof a kind we have often seen. It is that of a young patient with a\r\nwound on the lower part of the leg, a good long way below the knee.\r\nThis wound will run in spite of all that has been done to dry it up.\r\nThe opening in it is very small, and one would think it ought to be\r\neasily cured, but it is not so. The truth is that this wound is from\r\ntwo to three inches distant from where the real sore is situated in the\r\nlimb. The wound is well down towards the ankle; the real sore is well\r\nup towards the knee. There is a corroding matter generated in the\r\ninternal sore, and that runs down under the skin, and keeps cutting its\r\nway out at the wound. Until this is rectified, there will be no\r\nsuccessful healing. Ointments that might do well enough on a small\r\nexternal sore have no effect in this case. The real sore, however, is\r\neasily reached and cured by the right use of a small pointed syringe.\r\nThe kind most easily procured is made of glass, and costs about\r\nsixpence. Choose one that has a small smooth point, which can be easily\r\ninserted into the hole in the wound. This should be done without\r\ncausing any pain. The point of the syringe should be dipped in hot\r\nwater till it is as near as possible to blood heat: that is, it should\r\nneither be hotter nor colder than the skin it has to touch. If you are\r\nsufficiently careful on this point, all else will be comparatively\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nBefore you actually try to insert the syringe, observe in what\r\ndirection the wound is likely to be extended under the skin. It will\r\nprobably be upwards--almost certainly it will be so, as the waste\r\nmatter, by its weight, tends to fall down. The sore at the top\r\ninsertion of a muscle near the knee will send its matter down the leg,\r\nperhaps near to the ankle. Fill the syringe with warm water only, as\r\nnear blood heat as you can have it. When you have got the point of the\r\nsyringe even a very little way into the wound, you can inject a little\r\nwater, and in doing this you will probably learn more nearly where the\r\nactual sore is to be found. The water will probably come out as fast as\r\nyou send it in, but it may not come till a good quantity has gone in.\r\nNow, as you fill your syringe a second time with water at the same\r\ndegree of heat, you will add a single drop of strong acetic acid, or\r\ntwelve drops of white vinegar to a teacupful. You must be careful that\r\nthis is not exceeded at this stage, or you will cause great pain.\r\nMoreover, you do no good to the sore by making the acid so strong as to\r\ncause suffering. If it is only just so strong as to cause a comfortable\r\nfeeling of warmth, it will be all right for its curative purpose. Even\r\nvery weak acid combines with the irritating waste matter that is\r\nkeeping the sore diseased, and produces the desired healing effect. You\r\nhave only to add one drop after another of the acid to your full\r\nteacupful of warm water, till the feeling produced by the syringing is\r\nall that could be desired. In the case of the limb that we refer to, a\r\nsensible mother used the syringe and the acid so skilfully as to heal\r\nthe internal sore in a very short time, and thus the external wound\r\nquickly disappeared. Of course, if the wound is so very deep that the\r\nacid cannot be got up to cleanse it thoroughly, surgical aid should be\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, however, to take another case or two for further\r\nillustration. Here, then, is a decayed tooth extracted, but the part\r\nfrom which it is taken does not heal, as is usual. The hole in the gum\r\ndoes not close, and a discharge of offensive humour flows from it\r\nconstantly. The bone of the upper jaw is evidently wasting, and the\r\ndecay has extended somehow considerably up the side of the nose. The\r\nhole, however, is so small, that the usual glass syringe cannot enter\r\nit. We got an exceedingly small instrument, used for the injection of\r\nmorphia under the skin. The point of this syringe is a needle with a\r\npoint that is hollow nearly to the very end. When this point was broken\r\noff, the hollow part was so small that it entered the hole in the gum,\r\nand so it was easy to inject the weak acid up to the bottom of the\r\nsore, which had come to be only a little under the eye. About an inch\r\nand a half of hollow had to be washed out with the acid. But in a very\r\nshort time all discharge ceased, and the cure was perfect. Both of\r\nthese cases are comparatively simple, but they show clearly the great\r\nvalue of this use of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid is much more commonly used for such a purpose. It has the\r\ndrawback of being liable itself to melt away the healthy tissue, and to\r\nmake a wound larger. Acetic acid never does this, and so heals more\r\nquickly and certainly.\r\n\r\nWe might take a much more difficult case. It was that of an abscess and\r\nbad sore in the lower bowels. It was supposed to be necessary to\r\nperform a very dangerous operation in order to try to cure this--not\r\nmuch hope was held out of its being possible really to cure. It was,\r\nhowever, quite possible to reach the sore by the injection of acetic\r\nacid. The sufferer was directed to have this done regularly. In a very\r\nshort time there was a complete cure. In such a case all that is wanted\r\nis an ordinary india-rubber enema. A much larger quantity of water is\r\nrequired, but about the same strength of acid. First of all, as much\r\nacidulated water as can be taken up with comfort is injected: after a\r\nminute or so this is passed off. Then another is used in the same way,\r\nand passed off also. A third syringing may be employed, when about\r\nhalf-a-teacupful is taken and retained. If the acid gives no\r\ncomfortable feeling of warmth it needs to be strengthened till it does\r\nso, but not so that it produces any pain. The operation really well\r\ndone is not in the least painful, but, on the contrary, rather\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThere is still one syringing which we may notice--that of suppurating\r\nears. If an ear is discharging from some internal sore, nothing is more\r\nimportant than syringing with acetic acid, but it must be done with\r\nvery peculiar care. The water used should be as nearly as possible of\r\nexact blood heat, and the acetic acid of the exact strength at which it\r\nwill give a fine comfortable feeling in the ear. It must neither feel\r\nas if it were a mere wetting of the ear, nor that it gives the least\r\npain. The syringe, too, must be used gently, so as not to force the\r\nwater strongly against the internal parts that are so tender. It is a\r\nsoaking operation rather than a forcible urging of the water into the\r\near which is wanted. If this is nicely done, say twice a day, the acid\r\nwill reach the sore, and we may confidently look for a cure. Even when\r\nthe bones are wasting, as we have seen in the case of the upper jaw, if\r\nthis acid can be really brought to bear upon the sore, it will be\r\ncleansed and healed. In this simple way we have seen many, both old and\r\nyoung, delivered from sore trial, and made to enjoy life and health\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch weakness might be prevented and often cured by light gymnastic\r\nexercises practised twice a day, say on rising and at bedtime, giving\r\ntone to the muscles and bringing into regular use many which in\r\nordinary daily life are seldom or never used. The various vital organs\r\nof the body owe much of their health to the proper exercise of the\r\nsurrounding muscles; it will be seen then how necessary a system of\r\nregular exercise must be. The best way to learn this is to take a\r\ncourse of Swedish Drill or other good system at one of the gymnasiums\r\nwhich are now so common in Britain and America. But as many of our\r\nreaders live in places where such cannot be had, we shall try to\r\nindicate by diagrams some simple movements which can be practised by\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nA few general rules should be borne in mind:--\r\n\r\nBegin with a short time, say five minutes; omit at first the more\r\nfatiguing movements and gradually increase as the strength improves.\r\n\r\nThe time spent need never be long; fifteen or twenty minutes is long\r\nenough at any one time.\r\n\r\nDo the movements slowly and deliberately, stretching the muscles to\r\ntheir full extent.\r\n\r\nFix your mind on the particular limb that is being exercised.\r\n\r\nPractice in a room with open window, with little clothes on, or with\r\nnone; a daily air-bath is very conducive to health.\r\n\r\nEach exercise need not be performed more than three times, until\r\nstrength is fairly great.\r\n\r\nNever go on with the exercises so long as to be more than just a little\r\ntired.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to write out the exercises clearly on a good-sized\r\ncard or sheet of stiff paper, which can be set where it will be easily\r\nseen while one is exercising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nPOSITION 1.--Stand before a glass with head well up, chin in, neck\r\nelongated, shoulders down and back, arms hanging straight down, abdomen\r\nin, back slightly curved, heels together, toes slightly apart.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nARMS BEND.--While in position, bring the arms up at the sides so that\r\nthe tips of the fingers touch the shoulders. Return to position 1.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nHIPS FIRM.--Place hands on hips, well back, fingers together, and\r\nthumbs to the back. Now, slowly bend the head back as far as it will\r\ngo, and slowly raise it again, taking care all the time to keep the\r\nchin in. Position 1 again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nNECK REST.--Bring the arms up on a level with the shoulders, hands\r\nstraight with forearm and finger tips nearly but not quite touching\r\nbehind the neck. Head always quite erect. While in this position, bend\r\nthe body from the waist sideways, first to one side, then to the other,\r\nas far as it will go without moving the feet. When bending to the left,\r\n_feel_ the muscles of the right stretching and _vice versa_. Return to\r\nposition 1.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nBring arms to position 2, then extend them straight upwards, rising on\r\nthe toes at same time and drawing the body to its greatest height.\r\nBring arms again to position 2 and then down to position 1.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nBring arms to position 2 and extend them sideways, turning palms and\r\nhands downwards. Come back to position 2 and then position 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nBring arms to position 2 and extend them forwards, return to position 2\r\nand position 1.\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nHips firm (hands placed as in 3). Raise the heels a little, bend the\r\nknees slightly outwards and keep the upper part of the body perfectly\r\nerect. Lower the body about half-way down, then raise it again.\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nSame as 8, only go down as low as possible. It is not easy at first to\r\nkeep one's balance, the upper part of the body erect all the time,\r\nespecially when trying to rise. Return to position 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nArms bend (_see_ 2). Place the feet sideways, about a foot apart. Now\r\nbend the upper part of the body back, curving only the chest back,\r\nkeeping the waist still. Position 1.\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\nBring arms to position 2 and extend upwards as in fig. 5. Now bend the\r\nbody forwards till the hands nearly touch the floor, keeping the head\r\nbetween the arms, knees straight and arms straight and parallel to one\r\nanother. Return to position 5, then position 2 and then position 1.\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\nHips firm (_see_ 3). Raise one knee till the leg is bent as in the\r\nillustration, keep toe pointed down. Do the same with the other leg.\r\nReturn to position 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\nSame as 12, only stretch leg backward as in illustration, keeping knees\r\nstraight. Return to position 1.\r\n\r\n14.\r\n\r\nARMS FORWARD BEND.--Bend the arms in front of the body, as in the\r\nillustration. Extend one foot back and rest toe on ground. Position 1.\r\n\r\n15.\r\n\r\nArms as in 14. Fling right arm out sideways and turn head to the right\r\nas far as it will go without moving the rest of the body. Same to left.\r\nPosition 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n16.\r\n\r\nHips firm (_see_ 3). Kneel with toes extended backwards. Now bend the\r\nbody backwards from the knees, as far as possible, keeping straight and\r\nfirm as in illustration. Rise and return to position 1.\r\n\r\n17.\r\n\r\nOne arm, HIP FIRM, the other NECK REST (_see_ 3 and 4). Bend the body\r\nas in exercise 4. Return to position 1.\r\n\r\n18.\r\n\r\nArms bend (_see_ 2). Feet stride (_see_ 10). Now turn the body at the\r\nwaist as far as possible to right, then to left, taking care not to\r\nmove the hips. Return to position 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\nLEAP ON THE SPOT.--Hips firm (_see_ 3). Raise the heels, slightly bend\r\nat the knees as in illustration, jump and alight on toes again with\r\nknees slightly bent. Straighten knees and let heels sink to the ground.\r\nPosition 1.\r\n\r\n20.\r\n\r\nHips firm (_see_ 3). Stand near a chair or bed and slip one foot\r\nsideways under a rail. Now bend sideways as far as possible. Position\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\nAs 20, only stand facing the support and bend back. Position 1.\r\n\r\n22.\r\n\r\nKneel as in 16. Extend arms as in 6. Now turn the body from the waist\r\nas far to the right and as far to the left as possible. Position 1.\r\n\r\n23.\r\n\r\nDeep breathing (_see_ Breathing, Correct method of) should be practised\r\nseveral times during these exercises. Stand in position 1. Now raise\r\nthe hands slowly to the level of the shoulders, keeping the arms\r\nstraight and moving them sideways. While raising the arms, slowly fill\r\nthe lungs with air, and when lowering them let it slowly out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUMBELL EXERCISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an efficient and inexpensive way of developing all the muscles of\r\nthe body dumbells have no rival. Especially are they valuable for those\r\nwhose sedentary life forbids much active exercise, and as they only\r\nrequire a very short time each day for their practice, do not interfere\r\nmaterially with the work of the busiest. The accompanying exercises\r\nhave been given with a view to the complete and symmetrical development\r\nof the body. They should be practised in their entirety every morning\r\nand evening, after rising and bathing and before retiring, in as nearly\r\na nude a condition as practicable. And they should be practised with a\r\nserious and complete concentration of the mind upon each muscle as it\r\nis in turn exercised. This concentration is immensely fatiguing at\r\nfirst, but is necessary in order to derive full benefit from them. Just\r\nas in practising musical exercises for execution, a short time well\r\nspent is more valuable than a longer time with a wandering and\r\nuninterested mind, so in dumbell exercise it is above all the quality\r\nand not the quantity of the exercise which is of importance.\r\n\r\nIncrease the number of times each exercise is done weekly or daily,\r\nbeginning say at 10 or 20, according to strength, and endeavouring to\r\nbe able to be double this number in a short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1a.]\r\n\r\n1a.--Arms by side forced well back, finger nails to front.

Such articles\r\nwould occupy far too much space, as from the nature of the subject much\r\ndetail must be given, and explanations must be as complete as possible.\r\nThe Editor of these Papers has therefore written a book for children,\r\nand one each for boys and girls. These will be found advertised at the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nNumbers of persons consult us on these matters, and much has come to\r\nour knowledge which is astonishing and saddening as well, in regard to\r\nthe widely prevailing ignorance of both young and old regarding the sex\r\nfunctions. This is largely due to culpable neglect on the part of\r\nparents and others who have charge of the young.\r\n\r\nParents are often unwilling to speak of such matters, and would desire\r\nrather to place a good book on the subject in their children's hands.\r\nMany such books have been published, but none that we have seen have\r\nseemed to us quite satisfactory. Due attention must be paid to both the\r\nphysical and moral sides of the matter. Hence our resolve to write as\r\nwe have indicated. The books will be found duly advertised at the end\r\nof this volume.\r\n\r\nIt will no doubt be said that it is a pity to suggest ideas of sex to\r\nan innocent child, but surely those who look back on their own youth\r\nwill remember that there came a time when the problem of their own\r\norigin suggested itself.\r\n\r\nThe pretty fable that the storks or angels fetch the babies cannot long\r\nsatisfy the growing mind. Children wish to understand, yet it is easy\r\nfor them to see that parents do not wish to explain the mystery.\r\nCuriosity is aroused, for the desire to know is natural and quite\r\nlegitimate, and the sad thing is that the explanation is generally left\r\nto companions and servants who are devoid of delicacy or modesty.\r\n\r\nNow there is no reason for this reticence and false shame. The whole\r\nprocess of reproduction is a wonderful example of the wisdom and\r\ngoodness of the Creator, and if properly explained the child will see\r\nthat it is so.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are physical epochs through which all young people must\r\npass. These are quite natural, but unless explained and the children\r\nare prepared to expect them, may cause great alarm. In their distress\r\nthey are very likely to enquire from impure companions, or get some of\r\nthe pernicious literature which is issued in quantity by the quacks who\r\nprey upon the fears of the young, and upon their dislike to speak to\r\ntheir parents on a subject which the latter have taught them by silence\r\nis one which is unmentionable.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked when this information should be given. No rule will fit\r\nall cases, as children vary so much in their development. We would urge\r\nthat it should be given _early_, as Miss Willard well says:--\"See that\r\nthe pure thought gets in first.\" Besides, children grow up much faster\r\nthan their parents are apt to realize.\r\n\r\nThe evils of self-pollution are so great, and the cure so difficult,\r\nthat no risk should be run of such ever being commenced through\r\nignorance. In fact this is the main reason for our undertaking the\r\nseparate works on this subject. It is so saddening to reflect that a\r\ncareer of vice is often entered upon through the child's ignorance of\r\nthe laws of its own body, that the natural reticence in speaking of the\r\nsubject should not be allowed to prevent the information being given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_KIRK SEX SERIES._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Instruct thy son and labor for him lest his lewd behaviour be an\r\noffence unto thee.\"--_Ecclesiasticus 30, 13._\r\n\r\n\r\nA Talk with Boys about Themselves\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nEDWARD BRUCE KIRK, Editor of \"Papers on Health.\"\r\n\r\nIntroduction by Canon Hon.
