The old maxim, that \"Knowledge is power,\" is a true one, but there is\r\nstill a greater truth: \"KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY.\" Safety amid physical ills\r\nthat beset mankind, and safety amid the moral pitfalls that surround so\r\nmany young people, is the great crying demand of the age. {4}\r\n\r\n2. CRITICISM.--While the aim of this work, though novel and to some extent\r\nis daring, it is chaste, practical and to the point, and will be a boon and\r\na blessing to thousands who consult its pages. The world is full of\r\nignorance, and the ignorant will always criticise, because they live to\r\nsuffer ills, for they know no better. New light is fast falling upon the\r\ndark corners, and the eyes of many are being opened.\r\n\r\n3. RESEARCHES OF SCIENCE.--The researches of science in the past few years\r\nhave thrown light on many facts relating to the physiology of man and\r\nwoman, and the diseases to which they are subject, and consequently many\r\nreformations have taken place in the treatment and prevention of diseases\r\npeculiar to the sexes.\r\n\r\n4. LOCK AND KEY.--Any information bearing upon the diseases of mankind\r\nshould not be kept under lock and key. The physician is frequently called\r\nupon to speak in plain language to his patients upon some private and\r\nstartling disease contracted on account of ignorance. The better plan,\r\nhowever, is to so educate and enlighten old and young upon the important\r\nsubjects of health, so that the necessity to call a physician may occur\r\nless frequently.\r\n\r\n5. PROGRESSION.--A large, respectable, though diminishing class in every\r\ncommunity, maintain that nothing that relates exclusively to either sex\r\nshould become the subject of popular medical instruction. But such an\r\nopinion is radically wrong; ignorance is no more the mother of purity than\r\nit is of religion. Enlightenment can never work injustice to him who\r\ninvestigates.\r\n\r\n6. AN EXAMPLE.--The men and women who study and practice medicine are not\r\nthe worse, but the better for such knowledge; so it would be to the\r\ncommunity in general if all would be properly instructed on the laws of\r\nhealth which relate to the sexes.\r\n\r\n7. CRIME AND DEGRADATION.--Had every person a sound understanding on the\r\nrelation of the sexes, one of the most fertile sources of crime and\r\ndegradation would be removed. Physicians know too well what sad\r\nconsequences are constantly occurring from a lack of proper knowledge on\r\nthese important subjects.\r\n\r\n8. A CONSISTENT CONSIDERATION.--Let the reader of this work study its pages\r\ncarefully and be able to give safe counsel and advice to others, and\r\nremember that purity of purpose and purity of character are the brightest\r\njewels in the crown of immortality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{5}\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of Life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beginning Right.]\r\n\r\n1. THE BEGINNING.--There is a charm in opening manhood which has commended\r\nitself to the imagination in every age. The undefined hopes and promises of\r\nthe future--the dawning strength of intellect--the vigorous flow of\r\npassion--the very exchange of home ties and protected joys for free and\r\nmanly pleasures, give to this period an interest and excitement unfelt,\r\nperhaps, at any other.\r\n\r\n{6}\r\n\r\n2. THE GROWTH OF INDEPENDENCE.--Hitherto life has been to boys, as to\r\ngirls, a dependent existence--a sucker from the parent growth--a home\r\ndiscipline of authority and guidance and communicated impulse. But\r\nhenceforth it is a transplanted growth of its own--a new and free power of\r\nactivity in which the mainspring is no longer authority or law from\r\nwithout, but principle or opinion within. The shoot which has been\r\nnourished under the shelter of the parent stem, and bent according to its\r\ninclination, is transferred to the open world, where of its own impulse and\r\ncharacter it must take root, and grow into strength, or sink into weakness\r\nand vice.\r\n\r\n3. HOME TIES.--The thought of home must excite a pang even in the first\r\nmoments of freedom. Its glad shelter--its kindly guidance--its very\r\nrestraints, how dear and tender must they seem in parting! How brightly\r\nmust they shine in the retrospect as the youth turns from them to the\r\nhardened and unfamiliar face of the world! With what a sweet,\r\nsadly-cheering pathos they must linger in the memory! And then what chance\r\nand hazard is there in his newly-gotten freedom! What instincts of warning\r\nin its very novelty and dim inexperience! What possibilities of failure as\r\nwell as of success in the unknown future as it stretches before him!\r\n\r\n4. VICE OR VIRTUE.--Certainly there is a grave importance as well as a\r\npleasant charm in the beginning of life. There is awe as well as excitement\r\nin it when rightly viewed. The possibilities that lie in it of noble or\r\nignoble work--of happy self-sacrifice or ruinous self-indulgence--the\r\ncapacities in the right use of which it may rise to heights of beautiful\r\nvirtue, in the abuse of which it may sink to the depths of debasing\r\nvice--make the crisis one of fear as well as of hope, of sadness as well as\r\nof joy.\r\n\r\n5. SUCCESS OR FAILURE.--It is wistful as well as pleasing to think of the\r\nyoung passing year by year into the world, and engaging with its duties,\r\nits interests, and temptations. Of the throng that struggle at the gates of\r\nentrance, how many may reach their anticipated goal? Carry the mind forward\r\na few years, and some have climbed the hills of difficulty and gained the\r\neminence on which they wished to stand--some, although they may not have\r\ndone this, have kept their truth unhurt, their integrity unspoiled; but\r\nothers have turned back, or have perished by the way, or fallen in weakness\r\nof will, no more to rise again; victims of their own sin.\r\n\r\n6. WARNING.--As we place ourselves with the young at the opening gates of\r\nlife, and think of the end from the {7} beginning, it is a deep concern\r\nmore than anything else that fills us. Words of earnest argument and\r\nwarning counsel rather than of congratulation rise to our lips.\r\n\r\n7. MISTAKES ARE OFTEN FATAL.--Begin well, and the habit of doing well will\r\nbecome quite as easy as the habit of doing badly. \"Well begun is half\r\nended,\" says the proverb; \"and a good beginning is half the battle.\" Many\r\npromising young men have irretrievably injured themselves by a first false\r\nstep at the commencement of life; while others, of much less promising\r\ntalents, have succeeded simply by beginning well, and going onward. The\r\ngood, practical beginning is, to a certain extent, a pledge, a promise, and\r\nan assurance of the ultimate prosperous issue. There is many a poor\r\ncreature, now crawling through life, miserable himself and the cause of\r\nsorrow to others, who might have lifted up his head and prospered, if,\r\ninstead of merely satisfying himself with resolutions of well-doing, he had\r\nactually gone to work and made a good, practical beginning.\r\n\r\n8. BEGIN AT THE RIGHT PLACE.--Too many are, however, impatient of results.\r\nThey are not satisfied to begin where their fathers did, but where they\r\nleft off. They think to enjoy the fruits of industry without working for\r\nthem. They cannot wait for the results of labor and application, but\r\nforestall them by too early indulgence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLID COMFORT AND GOOD HEALTH.]\r\n\r\nHealth a Duty.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will both\r\nbe adequately cared for, as a diffusion of the belief that the preservation\r\nof health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as\r\nphysical morality.\r\n\r\nMen's habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat their\r\nbodies as they please. Disorder entailed by disobedience to nature's\r\ndictates they regard as grievances, not as the effects of a conduct more or\r\nless flagitious. Though the evil consequences inflicted on their\r\ndescendents and on future generations are often as great as those caused by\r\ncrime, they do not think themselves in any degree criminal.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the case of drunkenness the viciousness of a bodily\r\ntransgression is recognized; but none appear to infer that if this bodily\r\ntransgression is vicious, so, too, is {8} every bodily transgression. The\r\nfact is, all breaches of the law of health are physical sins.\r\n\r\nWhen this is generally seen, then, and perhaps not till then, will the\r\nphysical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves.\r\n\r\nPurity of life and thought should be taught in the home. It is the only\r\nsafeguard of the young. Let parents wake up on this important subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{9}\r\n\r\nValue of Reputation.\r\n\r\n1. WHO SHALL ESTIMATE THE COST.--Who shall estimate the cost of a priceless\r\nreputation--that impress which gives this human dross its currency--without\r\nwhich we stand despised, debased, depreciated? Who shall repair it injured?\r\nWho can redeem it lost? Oh, well and truly does the great philosopher of\r\npoetry esteem the world's wealth as \"trash\" in the comparison. Without it\r\ngold has no value; birth, no distinction; station, no dignity; beauty, no\r\ncharm; age, no reverence; without it every treasure impoverishes, every\r\ngrace deforms, every dignity degrades, and all the arts, the decorations\r\nand accomplishments of life stand, like the beacon-blaze upon a rock,\r\nwarning the world that its approach is dangerous; that its contact is\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n2. THE WRETCH WITHOUT IT.--The wretch without it is under eternal\r\nquarantine; no friend to greet; no home to harbor him, the voyage of his\r\nlife becomes a joyless peril; and in the midst of all ambition can achieve,\r\nor avarice amass, or rapacity plunder, he tosses on the surge, a buoyant\r\npestilence. But let me not degrade into selfishness of individual safety or\r\nindividual exposure this individual principle; it testifies a higher, a\r\nmore ennobling origin.\r\n\r\n3. ITS DIVINITY.--Oh, Divine, oh, delightful legacy of a spotless\r\nreputation: Rich is the inheritance it leaves; pious the example it\r\ntestifies; pure, precious and imperishable, the hope which it inspires; can\r\nthere be conceived a more atrocious injury than to filch from its possessor\r\nthis inestimable benefit to rob society of its charm, and solitude of its\r\nsolace; not only to out-law life, but attain death, converting the very\r\ngrave, the refuge of the sufferer, into the gate of infamy and of shame.\r\n\r\n4. LOST CHARACTER.--We can conceive few crimes beyond it. He who plunders\r\nmy property takes from me that which can be repaired by time; but what\r\nperiod can repair a ruined reputation? He who maims my person effects that\r\nwhich medicine may remedy; but what herb has sovereignty over the wounds of\r\nslander? He who ridicules my poverty or reproaches my profession, upbraids\r\nme with that which industry may retrieve, and integrity may purify; but\r\nwhat riches shall redeem the bankrupt fame? What power shall blanch the\r\nsullied show of character? There can be no injury more deadly. There can be\r\nno crime more cruel. It is without remedy. It is without antidote. It is\r\nwithout evasion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{11}\r\n\r\nInfluence of Associates.\r\n\r\n    If you always live with those who are lame, you will yourself learn to\r\n    limp.--FROM THE LATIN.\r\n\r\n    If men wish to be held in esteem, they must associate with those who\r\n    are estimable.--LA BRUYERE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING WILD FLOWERS.]\r\n\r\n1. BY WHAT MEN ARE KNOWN.--An author is known by his writings, a mother by\r\nher daughter, a fool by his words, and all men by their companions.\r\n\r\n2. FORMATION OF A GOOD CHARACTER.--Intercourse with persons of decided\r\nvirtue and excellence is of great importance in the formation of a good\r\ncharacter. The force of example is powerful; we are creatures of imitation,\r\nand, by a necessary influence, our tempers and habits are very much formed\r\non the model of those with whom we familiarly associate. Better be alone\r\nthan in bad company. Evil communications corrupt good manners. Ill\r\nqualities are catching as well as diseases; and the mind is at least as\r\nmuch, if not a great deal more, liable to infection, than the body. Go with\r\nmean people, and you think life is mean.\r\n\r\n3. GOOD EXAMPLE.--How natural is it for a child to look up to those around\r\nhim for an example of imitation, and how readily does he copy all that he\r\nsees done, good or bad. The importance of a good example on which the young\r\nmay exercise this powerful and active element of their nature, is a matter\r\nof the utmost moment.\r\n\r\n4. A TRUE MAXIM.--It is a trite, but true maxim, that \"a man is known by\r\nthe company he keeps.\" He naturally assimilates by the force of imitation,\r\nto the habits and manners of those by whom he is surrounded. We know\r\npersons who walk much with the lame, who have learned to walk with a hitch\r\nor limp like their lame friends. Vice stalks in the streets unabashed, and\r\nchildren copy it.\r\n\r\n5. LIVE WITH THE CULPABLE.--Live with the culpable, and you will be very\r\nlikely to die with the criminal. Bad company is like a nail driven into a\r\npost, which after the first or second blow, may be drawn out with little\r\ndifficulty; but being once driven in up to the head, the pinchers cannot\r\ntake hold to draw it out, which can only be done by the destruction of the\r\nwood. You may be ever so pure, you cannot associate with bad companions\r\nwithout falling into bad odor.\r\n\r\n6. SOCIETY OF THE VULGAR.--Do you love the society of the vulgar? Then you\r\nare already debased in your sentiments. Do you seek to be with the profane?\r\nIn your heart you are like them. Are jesters and buffoons your choice\r\nfriends? {12} He who loves to laugh at folly, is himself a fool. Do you\r\nlove and seek the society of the wise and good? Is this your habit? Had you\r\nrather take the lowest seat among these than the highest seat among others?\r\nThen you have already learned to be good. You may not make very much\r\nprogress, but even a good beginning is not to be despised.\r\n\r\n7. SINKS OF POLLUTION.--Strive for mental excellence, and strict integrity,\r\nand you never will be found in the sinks of pollution, and on the benches\r\nof retailers and gamblers. Once habituate yourself to a virtuous course,\r\nonce secure a love of good society, and no punishment would be greater than\r\nby accident to be obliged for half a day to associate with the low and\r\nvulgar. Try to frequent the company of your betters.\r\n\r\n8. PROCURE NO FRIEND IN HASTE.--Nor, if once secured, in haste abandon\r\nthem. Be slow in choosing an associate, and slower to change him; slight no\r\nman for poverty, nor esteem any one for his wealth. Good friends should not\r\nbe easily forgotten, nor used as suits of apparel, which, when we have worn\r\nthem threadbare, we cast them off, and call for new. When once you profess\r\nyourself a friend, endeavor to be always such. He can never have any true\r\nfriends that will be often changing them.\r\n\r\n9. HAVE THE COURAGE TO CUT THE MOST AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE.--Do this when\r\nyou are convinced that he lacks principle; a friend should bear with a\r\nfriend's infirmities, but not with his vices. He that does a base thing in\r\nzeal for his friend, burns the golden thread that ties their hearts\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-Control.\r\n\r\n    \"Honor and profit do not always lie in the same sack.\"--GEORGE HERBERT.\r\n\r\n    \"The government of one's self is the only true freedom for the\r\n    individual.\"--FREDERICK PERTHES.\r\n\r\n    \"It is length of patience, and endurance, and forebearance, that so\r\n    much of what is called good in mankind and womankind is shown.\"--ARTHUR\r\n    HELPS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1. ESSENCE OF CHARACTER.--Self-control is only courage under another form.\r\nIt may also be regarded as the primary essence of character. It is in\r\nvirtue of this quality that Shakespeare defines man as a being \"looking\r\nbefore and after.\" It forms the chief distinction between man and the mere\r\nanimal; and, indeed, there can be no true manhood without it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RESULT OF BAD COMPANY.]\r\n\r\n2. ROOT OF ALL THE VIRTUES.--Self-control is at the root {14} of all the\r\nvirtues. Let a man give the reins to his impulses and passions, and from\r\nthat moment he yields up his moral freedom. He is carried along the current\r\nof life, and becomes the slave of his strongest desire for the time being.\r\n\r\n3. RESIST INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE.--To be morally free--to be more than an\r\nanimal--man must be able to resist instinctive impulse, and this can only\r\nbe done by exercise of self-control. Thus it is this power which\r\nconstitutes the real distinction between a physical and a moral life, and\r\nthat forms the primary basis of individual character.\r\n\r\n4. A STRONG MAN RULETH HIS OWN SPIRIT.--In the Bible praise is given, not\r\nto a strong man who \"taketh a city,\" but to the stronger man who \"ruleth\r\nhis own spirit.\" This stronger man is he who, by discipline, exercises a\r\nconstant control over his thoughts, his speech, and his acts. Nine-tenths\r\nof the vicious desires that degrade society, and which, when indulged,\r\nswell into the crimes that disgrace it, would shrink into insignificance\r\nbefore the advance of valiant self-discipline, self-respect, and\r\nself-control. By the watchful exercise of these virtues, purity of heart\r\nand mind become habitual, and the character is built up in chastity,\r\nvirtue, and temperance.\r\n\r\n5. THE BEST SUPPORT.--The best support of character will always be found in\r\nhabit, which, according as the will is directed rightly or wrongly, as the\r\ncase may be, will prove either a benignant ruler, or a cruel despot. We may\r\nbe its willing subject on the one hand, or its servile slave on the other.\r\nIt may help us on the road to good, or it may hurry us on the road to ruin.\r\n\r\n6. THE IDEAL MAN.--\"In the supremacy of self-control,\" says Herbert\r\nSpencer, \"consists one of the perfections of the ideal man. Not to be\r\nimpulsive, not to be spurred hither and thither by each desire that in turn\r\ncomes uppermost, but to be self-restrained, self-balanced, governed by the\r\njoint decision of the feelings in council assembled, before whom every\r\naction shall have been fully debated, and calmly determined--that it is\r\nwhich education, moral education at least, strives to produce.\"\r\n\r\n7. THE BEST REGULATED HOME.--The best regulated home is always that in\r\nwhich the discipline is the most perfect, and yet where it is the least\r\nfelt. Moral discipline acts with the force of a law of nature. Those\r\nsubject to it yield themselves to it unconsciously; and though it shapes\r\nand forms the whole character, until the life becomes crystallized in\r\nhabit, the influence thus exercised is for the most part unseen, and almost\r\nunfelt. {15}\r\n\r\n8. PRACTICE SELF-DENIAL.--If a man would get through life honorably and\r\npeaceably, he must necessarily learn to practice self-denial in small\r\nthings as well as in great. Men have to bear as well as to forbear. The\r\ntemper has to be held in subjection to the judgment; and the little demons\r\nof ill-humor, petulance, and sarcasm, kept resolutely at a distance. If\r\nonce they find an entrance to the mind, they are apt to return, and to\r\nestablish for themselves a permanent occupation there.\r\n\r\n9. POWER OF WORDS.--It is necessary to one's personal happiness, to\r\nexercise control over one's words as well as acts: for there are words that\r\nstrike even harder than blows; and men may \"speak daggers,\" though they use\r\nnone. The stinging repartee that rises to the lips, and which, if uttered,\r\nmight cover an adversary with confusion, how difficult it is to resist\r\nsaying it! \"Heaven, keep us,\" says Miss Bremer, in her 'Home', \"from the\r\ndestroying power of words! There are words that sever hearts more than\r\nsharp swords do; there are words the point of which sting the heart through\r\nthe course of a whole life.\"\r\n\r\n10. CHARACTER EXHIBITS ITSELF.--Character exhibits itself in self-control\r\nof speech as much as in anything else. The wise and forbearant man will\r\nrestrain his desire to say a smart or severe thing at the expense of\r\nanother's feeling; while the fool blurts out what he thinks, and will\r\nsacrifice his friend rather than his joke. \"The mouth of a wise man,\" said\r\nSolomon, \"is in his heart: the heart of a fool is in his mouth.\"\r\n\r\n11. BURNS.--No one knew the value of self-control better than the poet\r\nBurns, and no one could teach it more eloquently to others, but when it\r\ncame to practice, Burns was as weak as the weakest. He could not deny\r\nhimself the pleasure of uttering a harsh and clever sarcasm at another's\r\nexpense. One of his biographers observed of him, that it was no extravagant\r\narithmetic to say that for every ten jokes he made himself a hundred\r\nenemies. But this was not all. Poor Burns exercised no control over his\r\nappetites, but freely gave them the rein:\r\n\r\n \"Thus thoughtless follies laid him low,\r\n  And stained his name.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOST SELF-CONTROL.]\r\n\r\n12. SOW POLLUTION.--Nor had he the self-denial to resist giving publicity\r\nto compositions originally intended for the delight of the tap-room, but\r\nwhich continued secretly to sow pollution broadcast in the minds of youth.\r\nIndeed, notwithstanding the many exquisite poems of this writer, it is not\r\nsaying too much that his immoral writings have done far more harm than his\r\npurer writings have done good; and {16} it would be better that all his\r\nwritings should be destroyed and forgotten, provided his indecent songs\r\ncould be destroyed with them.\r\n\r\n13. MORAL PRINCIPLE.--Many of our young men lack moral principle. They\r\ncannot look upon a beautiful girl with a pure heart and pure thoughts. They\r\nhave not manifested or practiced that self-control which develops true\r\nmanhood, and brings into subordination evil thoughts, evil passions, and\r\nevil practices. Men who have no self-control will find life a failure, both\r\nin a social and in a business sense. The world despises an insignificant\r\nperson who lacks backbone and character. Stand upon your manhood and\r\nwomanhood; honor your convictions, and dare to do right.\r\n\r\n14. STRONG DRINK.--There is the habit of strong drink. It is only the lack\r\nof self-control that brings men into the depths of degradation; on account\r\nof the cup, the habit of taking drink occasionally in its milder forms--of\r\nplaying with a small appetite that only needs sufficient playing with to\r\nmake you a demon or a dolt. You think you are safe; I know you are not\r\nsafe, if you drink at all; and when you get offended with the good friends\r\nthat warn you of your danger, you are a fool. I know that the grave\r\nswallows daily, by scores, drunkards, every one of whom thought he was safe\r\nwhile he was forming his appetite. But this is old talk. A young man in\r\nthis age who forms the habit of drinking, or puts himself in danger of\r\nforming the habit, is usually so weak that it doesn't pay to save him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{17}\r\n\r\nHabit.\r\n\r\n    It is almost as difficult to make a man unlearn his Errors as his\r\n    Knowledge.--COLTON.\r\n\r\n    There are habits contracted by bad example, or bad management, before\r\n    we have judgment to discern their approaches, or because the eye of\r\n    Reason is laid asleep, or has not compass of view sufficient to look\r\n    around on every quarter.--TUCKER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1. HABIT.--Our real strength in life depends upon habits formed in early\r\nlife. The young man who sows his wild oats and indulges in the social cup,\r\nis fastening chains upon himself that never can be broken. The innocent\r\nyouth by solitary practice of self-abuse will fasten upon himself a habit\r\nwhich will wreck his physical constitution and bring suffering and misery\r\nand ruin. Young man and young woman, beware of bad habits formed in early\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n2. A BUNDLE OF HABITS.--Man, it has been said, is a bundle of habits; and\r\nhabit is second nature. Metastasio entertained so strong an opinion as to\r\nthe power of repetition in act and thought, that he said, \"All is habit in\r\nmankind, even virtue itself.\" Evil habits must be conquered, or they will\r\nconquer us and destroy our peace and happiness.\r\n\r\n3. VICIOUS HABITS.--Vicious habits, when opposed, offer the most vigorous\r\nresistence on the first attack. At each successive encounter this\r\nresistence grows fainter and fainter, until finally it ceases altogether\r\nand the victory is achieved. Habit is man's best friend and worst enemy; it\r\ncan exalt him to the highest pinnacle of virtue, honor and happiness, or\r\nsink him to the lowest depths of vice, shame and misery.\r\n\r\n4. HONESTY, OR KNAVERY.--We may form habits of honesty, or knavery; truth,\r\nor falsehood; of industry, or idleness; frugality, or extravagance; of\r\npatience, or impatience; self-denial, or self-indulgence; of kindness,\r\ncruelty, politeness, rudeness, prudence, perseverance, circumspection. In\r\nshort, there is not a virtue, nor a vice; not an act of body, nor of mind,\r\nto which we may not be chained down by this despotic power.\r\n\r\n5. BEGIN WELL.--It is a great point for young men to begin well; for it is\r\nthe beginning of life that that system of conduct is adopted which soon\r\nassumes the force of habit. Begin well, and the habit of doing well will\r\nbecome quite easy, as easy as the habit of doing badly. Pitch upon that\r\ncourse of life which is the most excellent, and habit will render it the\r\nmost delightful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{18}\r\n\r\nA Good Name.\r\n\r\n1. THE LONGING FOR A GOOD NAME.--The longing for a good name is one of\r\nthose laws of nature that were passed for the soul and written down within\r\nto urge toward a life of action, and away from small or wicked action. So\r\nlarge is this passion that it is set forth in poetic thought, as having a\r\ntemple grand as that of Jupiter or Minerva, and up whose marble steps all\r\nnoble minds struggle--the temple of Fame.\r\n\r\n2. CIVILIZATION.--Civilization is the ocean of which the millions of\r\nindividuals are the rivers and torrents. These rivers and torrents swell\r\nwith those rains of money and home and fame and happiness, and then fall\r\nand run almost dry, but the ocean of civilization has gathered up all these\r\nwaters, and holds them in sparkling beauty for all subsequent use.\r\nCivilization is a fertile delta made by the drifting souls of men.\r\n\r\n3. FAME.--The word \"fame\" never signifies simply notoriety. The meaning of\r\nthe direct term may be seen from its negation or opposite, for only the\r\nmeanest of men are called infamous. They are utterly without fame, utterly\r\nnameless; but if fame implied only notoriety then infamous would possess no\r\nmarked significance. Fame is an undertaker that pays but little attention\r\nto the living, but who bedizens the dead, furnishes out their funerals and\r\nfollows them to the grave.\r\n\r\n4. LIFE-MOTIVE.--So in studying that life-motive which is called a \"good\r\nname,\" we must ask the large human race to tell us the high merit of this\r\nspiritual longing. We must read the words of the sage, who said long\r\ncenturies ago that \"a good name was rather chosen than great riches.\" Other\r\nsages have said as much. Solon said that \"He that will sell his good name\r\nwill sell the State.\" Socrates said, \"Fame is the perfume of heroic deeds.\"\r\nOur Shakspeare said, \"He lives in fame who died in virtue's cause.\"\r\n\r\n5. INFLUENCES OF OUR AGE.--Our age is deeply influenced by the motives\r\ncalled property and home and pleasure, but it is a question whether the\r\ngeneration in action to-day and the generation on the threshold of this\r\nintense life are conscious fully of the worth of an honorable name.\r\n\r\n6. BEAUTY OF CHARACTER.--We do not know whether with us all a good name is\r\nless sweet than it was with our fathers, but this is painfully evident,\r\nthat our times do not sufficiently behold the beauty of character--their\r\nsense does not {19} detect quickly enough or love deeply enough this aroma\r\nof heroic deeds.\r\n\r\n7. SELLING OUT THEIR REPUTATION.--It is amazing what multitudes there are\r\nwho are willing to sell out their reputation, and amazing at what a low\r\nprice they will make the painful exchange. Some king remarked that he would\r\nnot tell a lie for any reward less than an empire. It is not uncommon in\r\nour world for a man to sell out all his honor and hopes for a score or a\r\nhalf score of dollars.\r\n\r\n8. PRISONS OVERFLOWING.--Our prisons are all full to overflowing of those\r\nwho took no thought of honor. They have not waited for an empire to be\r\noffered them before they would violate the sacred rights of man, but many\r\nof them have even murdered for a cause that would not have justified even\r\nan exchange of words.\r\n\r\n9. INTEGRITY THE PRIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT.--If integrity were made the pride\r\nof the government, the love of it would soon spring up among the people. If\r\nall fraudulent men should go straight to jail, pitilessly, and if all the\r\nmost rigid characters were sought out for all political and commercial\r\noffices, there would soon come a popular honesty just as there has come a\r\nlove of reading or of art. It is with character as with any new\r\narticle--the difficulty lies in its first introduction.\r\n\r\n10. A NEW VIRTUE.--May a new virtue come into favor, all our high rewards,\r\nthose from the ballot-box, those from employers, the rewards of society,\r\nthe rewards of the press, should be offered only to the worthy. A few years\r\nof rewarding the worthy would result in a wonderful zeal in the young to\r\nbuild up, not physical property, but mental and spiritual worth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ARAB PRINCESS.]\r\n\r\n11. BLESSING THE FAMILY GROUP.--No young man or young woman can by industry\r\nand care reach an eminence in study or art or character, without blessing\r\nthe entire family group. We have all seen that the father and mother feel\r\nthat all life's care and labor were at last perfectly rewarded in the\r\nsuccess of their child. But had the child been reckless or indolent, all\r\nthis domestic joy--the joy of a large group--would have been blighted\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n12. AN HONORED CHILD.--There have been triumphs at old Rome, where victors\r\nmarched along with many a chariot, many an elephant, and many spoils of the\r\nEast; and in all times money has been lavished in the efforts of States to\r\ntell their pleasure in the name of some general; but more numerous and\r\nwide-spread and beyond expression, by chariot or cannon or drum, have been\r\nthose triumphal {20} hours, when some son or daughter has returned to the\r\nparental hearth beautiful in the wreaths of some confessed excellence,\r\nbearing a good name.\r\n\r\n13. RICH CRIMINALS.--We looked at the utter wretchedness of the men who\r\nthrew away reputation, and would rather be rich criminals in exile than be\r\nloved friends and persons at home.\r\n\r\n14. AN EMPTY, OR AN EVIL NAME.--Young and old cannot afford to bear the\r\nburden of an empty or an evil name. A good name is a motive of life. It is\r\na reason for that great encampment we call an existence. While you are\r\nbuilding the home of to-morrow, build up also that kind of soul that can\r\nsleep sweetly on home's pillow, and can feel that God is not near as an\r\navenger of wrong, but as the Father not only of the verdure and the\r\nseasons, but of you. Live a pure life and bear a good name, and your reward\r\nwill be sure and great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{21}\r\n\r\nThe Mother's Influence.\r\n\r\n  Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you,\r\n  Many a Summer the grass has grown green,\r\n  Blossomed and faded, our faces between;\r\n  Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,\r\n  Long I to-night for your presence again.--_Elizabeth Akers Allen._\r\n\r\n  A mother is a mother still,\r\n  The holiest thing alive.--_Coleridge._\r\n\r\n                          There is none,\r\n  In all this cold and hollow world, no fount\r\n  Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within\r\n  A mother's heart.--_Mrs. Hemans._\r\n\r\n  And all my mother came into mine eyes,\r\n  And gave me up to tears.--_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRAYERFUL AND DEVOTED MOTHER.]\r\n\r\n1. HER INFLUENCE.--It is true to nature, although it be expressed in a\r\nfigurative form, that a mother is both the morning and the evening star of\r\nlife. The light of her eye is always the first to rise, and often the last\r\nto set upon man's day of trial. She wields a power more decisive far than\r\nsyllogisms in argument or courts of last appeal in authority.\r\n\r\n2. HER LOVE.--Mother! ecstatic sound so twined round our hearts that they\r\nmust cease to throb ere we forget it; 'tis our first love; 'tis part of\r\nreligion. Nature has set the mother upon such a pinnacle that our infant\r\neyes and arms are first uplifted to it; we cling to it in manhood; we\r\nalmost worship it in old age.\r\n\r\n3. HER TENDERNESS.--Alas! how little do we appreciate a mother's tenderness\r\nwhile living. How heedless are we in youth of all her anxieties and\r\nkindness! But when she is dead and gone, when the cares and coldness of the\r\nworld come withering to our hearts, when we experience for ourselves how\r\nhard it is to find true sympathy, how few to love us, how few will befriend\r\nus in misfortune, then it is that we think of the mother we have lost.\r\n\r\n4. HER CONTROLLING POWER.--The mother can take man's whole nature under her\r\ncontrol. She becomes what she has been called, \"The Divinity of Infancy.\"\r\nHer smile is its sunshine, her word its mildest law, until sin and the\r\nworld have steeled the heart.\r\n\r\n{22} 5. THE LAST TIE.--The young man who has forsaken the advice and\r\ninfluence of his mother has broken the last cable and severed the last tie\r\nthat binds him to an honorable and upright life. He has forsaken his best\r\nfriend, and every hope for his future welfare may be abandoned, for he is\r\nlost forever. If he is faithless to mother, he will have but little respect\r\nfor wife and children.\r\n\r\n6. HOME TIES.--The young man or young woman who love their home and love\r\ntheir mother can be safely trusted under almost any and all circumstances,\r\nand their life will not be a blank, for they seek what is good. Their\r\nhearts will be ennobled, and God will bless them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{23}\r\n\r\nHome Power.\r\n\r\n    \"The mill-streams that turn the clappers of the world arise in solitary\r\n    places.\"--HELPS.\r\n\r\n \"Lord! with what care hast Thou begirt us round!\r\n  Parents first season us. Then schoolmasters\r\n  Deliver us to laws. They send us bound\r\n  To rules of reason.\"--GEORGE HERBERT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME AMUSEMENT.]\r\n\r\n1. SCHOOL OF CHARACTER.--Home is the first and most important school of\r\ncharacter. It is there that every human being receives his best moral\r\ntraining, or his worst, for it is there that he imbibes those principles of\r\nconduct which endure through manhood, and cease only with life.\r\n\r\n2. HOME MAKES THE MAN.--It is a common saying, \"Manners make the man;\" and\r\nthere is a second, that \"Mind makes the man;\" but truer than either is a\r\nthird, that \"Home makes the man.\" For the home-training includes not only\r\nmanners and mind, but character. It is mainly in the home that the heart is\r\nopened, the habits are formed, the intellect is awakened, and character\r\nmoulded for good or for evil.\r\n\r\n{24}\r\n\r\n3. GOVERN SOCIETY.--From that source, be it pure or impure, issue the\r\nprinciples and maxims that govern society. Law itself is but the reflex of\r\nhomes. The tiniest bits of opinion sown in the minds of children in private\r\nlife afterwards issue forth to the world, and become its public opinion;\r\nfor nations are gathered out of nurseries, and they who hold the\r\nleading-strings of children may even exercise a greater power than those\r\nwho wield the reins of government.\r\n\r\n4. THE CHILD IS FATHER OF THE MAN.--The child's character is the nucleus of\r\nthe man's; all after-education is but superposition; the form of the\r\ncrystal remains the same. Thus the saying of the poet holds true in a large\r\ndegree, \"The child is father of the man;\" or as Milton puts it, \"The\r\nchildhood shows the man, as morning shows the day.\" Those impulses to\r\nconduct which last the longest and are rooted the deepest, always have\r\ntheir origin near our birth. It is then that the germs of virtues or vices,\r\nof feelings or sentiments, are first implanted which determine the\r\ncharacter of life.\r\n\r\n5. NURSERIES.--Thus homes, which are nurseries of children who grow up into\r\nmen and women, will be good or bad according to the power that governs\r\nthem. Where the spirit of love and duty pervades the home, where head and\r\nheart bear rule wisely there, where the daily life is honest and virtuous,\r\nwhere the government is sensible, kind, and loving, then may we expect from\r\nsuch a home an issue of healthy, useful, and happy beings, capable as they\r\ngain the requisite strength, of following the footsteps of their parents,\r\nof walking uprightly, governing themselves wisely, and contributing to the\r\nwelfare of those about them.\r\n\r\n6. IGNORANCE, COARSENESS, AND SELFISHNESS.--On the other hand, if\r\nsurrounded by ignorance, coarseness, and selfishness, they will\r\nunconsciously assume the same character, and grow up to adult years rude,\r\nuncultivated, and all the more dangerous to society if placed amidst the\r\nmanifold temptations of what is called civilized life. \"Give your child to\r\nbe educated by a slave,\" said an ancient Greek, \"and, instead of one slave,\r\nyou will then have two.\"\r\n\r\n7. MATERNAL LOVE.--Maternal love is the visible providence of our race. Its\r\ninfluence is constant and universal. It begins with the education of the\r\nhuman being at the outstart of life, and is prolonged by virtue of the\r\npowerful influence which every good mother exercises over her children\r\nthrough life. When launched into the world, each to take part in its\r\nlabors, anxieties, and trials, they still turn {25} to their mother for\r\nconsolation, if not for counsel, in their time of trouble and difficulty.\r\nThe pure and good thoughts she has implanted in their minds when children\r\ncontinue to grow up into good acts long after she is dead; and when there\r\nis nothing but a memory of her left, her children rise up and call her\r\nblessed.\r\n\r\n8. WOMAN, ABOVE ALL OTHER EDUCATORS, educates humanly. Man is the brain,\r\nbut woman is the heart of humanity; he its judgment, she its feeling; he\r\nits strength, she its grace, ornament, and solace. Even the understanding\r\nof the best woman seems to work mainly through her affections. And thus,\r\nthough man may direct the intellect, woman cultivates the feelings, which\r\nmainly determine the character. While he fills the memory, she occupies the\r\nheart. She makes us love what he can make us only believe, and it is\r\nchiefly through her that we are enabled to arrive at virtue.\r\n\r\n9. THE POOREST DWELLING, presided over by a virtuous, thrifty, cheerful,\r\nand cleanly woman, may thus be the abode of comfort, virtue, and happiness;\r\nit may be the scene of every ennobling relation in family life; it may be\r\nendeared to man by many delightful associations; furnishing a sanctuary for\r\nthe heart, a refuge from the storms of life, a sweet resting-place after\r\nlabor, a consolation in misfortune, a pride in prosperity, and a joy at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n10. THE GOOD HOME IS THUS THE BEST OF SCHOOLS, not only in youth but in\r\nage. There young and old best learn cheerfulness, patience, self-control,\r\nand the spirit of service and of duty. The home is the true school of\r\ncourtesy, of which woman is always the best practical instructor. \"Without\r\nwoman,\" says the Provencal proverb, \"men were but ill-licked cubs.\"\r\nPhilanthropy radiates from the home as from a centre. \"To love the little\r\nplatoon we belong to in society,\" said Burke, \"is the germ of all public\r\naffections.\" The wisest and best have not been ashamed to own it to be\r\ntheir greatest joy and happiness to sit \"behind the heads of children\" in\r\nthe inviolable circle of home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{26}\r\n\r\nTo Young Women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDITATION.]\r\n\r\n1. TO BE A WOMAN, in the truest and highest sense of the word, is to be the\r\nbest thing beneath the skies. To be a woman is something more than to live\r\neighteen or twenty years; something more than to grow to the physical\r\nstature of women; something more than to wear flounces, exhibit dry goods,\r\nsport jewelry, catch the gaze of lewd-eyed men; {27} something more than to\r\nbe a belle, a wife, or a mother. Put all these qualifications together and\r\nthey do but little toward making a true woman.\r\n\r\n2. BEAUTY AND STYLE are not the surest passports to womanhood--some of the\r\nnoblest specimens of womanhood that the world has ever seen have presented\r\nthe plainest and most unprepossessing appearance. A woman's worth is to be\r\nestimated by the real goodness of her heart, the greatness of her soul, and\r\nthe purity and sweetness of her character; and a woman with a kindly\r\ndisposition and well-balanced temper is both lovely and attractive, be her\r\nface ever so plain, and her figure ever so homely; she makes the best of\r\nwives and the truest of mothers.\r\n\r\n3. BEAUTY IS A DANGEROUS GIFT.--It is even so. Like wealth, it has ruined\r\nits thousands. Thousands of the most beautiful women are destitute of\r\ncommon sense and common humanity. No gift from heaven is so general and so\r\nwidely abused by woman as the gift of beauty. In about nine cases in ten it\r\nmakes her silly, senseless, thoughtless, giddy, vain, proud, frivolous,\r\nselfish, low and mean. I think I have seen more girls spoiled by beauty\r\nthan by any other one thing. \"She is beautiful, and she knows it,\" is as\r\nmuch as to say that she is spoiled. A beautiful girl is very likely to\r\nbelieve she was made to be looked at; and so she sets herself up for a show\r\nat every window, in every door, on every corner of the street, in every\r\ncompany at which opportunity offers for an exhibition of herself.\r\n\r\n4. BEWARE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.--These facts have long since taught sensible\r\nmen to beware of beautiful women--to sound them carefully before they give\r\nthem their confidence. Beauty is shallow--only skin deep; fleeting--only\r\nfor a few years' reign; dangerous--tempting to vanity and lightness of\r\nmind; deceitful--dazzling often to bewilder; weak--reigning only to ruin;\r\ngross--leading often to sensual pleasure. And yet we say it need not be so.\r\nBeauty is lovely and ought to be innocently possessed. It has charms which\r\nought to be used for good purposes. It is a delightful gift, which ought to\r\nbe received with gratitude and worn with grace and meekness. It should\r\nalways minister to inward beauty. Every woman of beautiful form and\r\nfeatures should cultivate a beautiful mind and heart.\r\n\r\n5. RIVAL THE BOYS.--We want the girls to rival the boys in all that is\r\ngood, and refined, and ennobling. We want them to rival the boys, as they\r\nwell can, in learning, in understanding, in virtues; in all noble qualities\r\nof mind and heart, but not in any of those things that have caused them,\r\njustly or unjustly, to be described as savages. We want {28} the girls to\r\nbe gentle--not weak, but gentle, and kind and affectionate. We want to be\r\nsure, that wherever a girl is, there should be a sweet, subduing and\r\nharmonizing influence of purity, and truth, and love, pervading and\r\nhallowing, from center to circumference, the entire circle in which she\r\nmoves. If the boys are savages, we want her to be their civilizer. We want\r\nher to tame them, to subdue their ferocity, to soften their manners, and to\r\nteach them all needful lessons of order, sobriety, and meekness, and\r\npatience, and goodness.\r\n\r\n6. KINDNESS.--Kindness is the ornament of man--it is the chief glory of\r\nwoman--it is, indeed, woman's true prerogative--her sceptre and her crown.\r\nIt is the sword with which she conquers, and the charm with which she\r\ncaptivates.\r\n\r\n7. ADMIRED AND BELOVED.--Young lady, would you be admired and beloved?\r\nWould you be an ornament to your sex, and a blessing to your race?\r\nCultivate this heavenly virtue. Wealth may surround you with its\r\nblandishments, and beauty, and learning, or talents, may give you admirers,\r\nbut love and kindness alone can captivate the heart. Whether you live in a\r\ncottage or a palace, these graces can surround you with perpetual sunshine,\r\nmaking you, and all around you, happy.\r\n\r\n8. INWARD GRACE.--Seek ye then, fair daughters, the possession of that\r\ninward grace, whose essence shall permeate and vitalize the affections,\r\nadorn the countenance, make mellifluous the voice, and impart a hallowed\r\nbeauty even to your motions. Not merely that you may be loved, would I urge\r\nthis, but that you may, in truth, be lovely--that loveliness which fades\r\nnot with time, nor is marred or alienated by disease, but which neither\r\nchance nor change can in any way despoil.\r\n\r\n9. SILKEN ENTICEMENTS OF THE STRANGER.--We urge you, gentle maiden, to\r\nbeware of the silken enticements of the stranger, until your love is\r\nconfirmed by protracted acquaintance. Shun the idler, though his coffers\r\noverflow with pelf. Avoid the irreverent--the scoffer of hallowed things;\r\nand him who \"looks upon the wine while it is red;\" him too, \"who hath a\r\nhigh look and a proud heart,\" and who \"privily slandereth his neighbor.\" Do\r\nnot heed the specious prattle about \"first love,\" and so place,\r\nirrevocably, the seal upon your future destiny, before you have sounded, in\r\nsilence and secrecy, the deep fountains of your own heart. Wait, rather,\r\nuntil your own character and that of him who would woo you, is more fully\r\ndeveloped. Surely, if this \"first love\" cannot endure a short probation,\r\nfortified by \"the {29} pleasures of hope,\" how can it be expected to\r\nsurvive years of intimacy, scenes of trial, distracting cares, wasting\r\nsickness, and all the homely routine of practical life? Yet it is these\r\nthat constitute life, and the love that cannot abide them is false and must\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{30}\r\n\r\nInfluence of Female Character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN LADIES.]\r\n\r\n1. MORAL EFFECT.--It is in its moral effect on the mind and the heart of\r\nman, that the influence of woman is most powerful and important. In the\r\ndiversity of tastes, habits, inclinations, and pursuits of the two sexes,\r\nis found a most beneficent provision for controlling the force and\r\nextravagance of human passion. The objects which most strongly seize and\r\nstimulate the mind of man, rarely act at the same time and with equal power\r\non the mind of woman. She is naturally better, purer, and more chaste in\r\nthought and language.\r\n\r\n2. FEMALE CHARACTER.--But the influence of female character on the virtue\r\nof men, is not seen merely in restraining and softening the violence of\r\nhuman passion. To her is mainly committed the task of pouring into the\r\nopening mind of infancy its first impressions of duty, and of stamping on\r\nits susceptible heart the first image of its God. Who will not confess the\r\ninfluence of a mother in forming the heart of a child? What man is there\r\nwho can not trace the origin of many of the best maxims of his life to the\r\nlips of her who gave him birth? How wide, how lasting, how sacred is that\r\npart of a woman's influence.\r\n\r\n3. VIRTUE OF A COMMUNITY.--There is yet another mode, by which woman may\r\nexert a powerful influence on the virtue of a community. It rests with her\r\nin a pre-eminent degree, to give tone and elevation to the moral character\r\nof the age, by deciding the degree of virtue that shall be necessary to\r\nafford a passport to her society. If all the favor of woman were given only\r\nto the good, if it were known that the charms and attractions of beauty,\r\nand wisdom, and wit, were reserved only for the pure; if, in one word,\r\nsomething of a similar rigor were exerted to exclude the profligate and\r\nabandoned of society, as is shown to those who have fallen from\r\nvirtue,--how much would be done to re-enforce the motives to moral purity\r\namong us, and impress on the minds of all a reverence for the sanctity and\r\nobligations of virtue.\r\n\r\n4. THE INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON THE MORAL SENTIMENTS.--The influence of woman\r\non the moral sentiments of society is intimately connected with her\r\ninfluence on its religious character; for religion and a pure and elevated\r\nmorality must ever stand in the relation to each other of effect and cause.\r\nThe heart of a woman is formed for the abode of sacred truth; and for the\r\nreasons alike honorable to her character and to that of society. From the\r\nnature of humanity this must be so, or the race would soon degenerate, and\r\nmoral contagion eat out the heart of society. The purity of home is the\r\nsafeguard to American manhood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{31}\r\n\r\nPersonal Purity.\r\n\r\n \"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,\r\n  These three alone lead life to sovereign power.\"--TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. WORDS OF THE GREAT TEACHER.--Mark the words of the Great Teacher: \"If\r\nthy right hand or foot cause thee to fall, cut it off and cast it from\r\nthee. If thy right eye cause thee to fall, pluck it out. It is better for\r\nthee to enter into life maimed and halt, than having two eyes to be cast\r\ninto hell-fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.\"\r\n\r\n2. A MELANCHOLY FACT.--It is a melancholy fact, in human experience, that\r\nthe noblest gifts which men possess are constantly prostituted to other\r\npurposes than those for which they are designed. The most valuable and\r\nuseful organs of the body are those which are capable of the greatest\r\ndishonor, abuse, and corruption. What a snare the wonderful organism of the\r\neye may become, when used to read corrupt books, or to look upon licentious\r\npictures, or vulgar theater scenes, or when used to meet the fascinating\r\ngaze of the harlot! What an instrument for depraving the whole man may be\r\nfound in the matchless powers of the brain, the hand, the mouth, or the\r\ntongue! What potent instruments may these become in accomplishing the ruin\r\nof the whole being, for time and eternity! {32}\r\n\r\n3. ABSTINENCE.--Some can testify with thankfulness that they never knew the\r\nsins of gambling, drunkenness, fornication, or adultery. In all these cases\r\nabstinence has been, and continues to be, liberty. Restraint is the noblest\r\nfreedom. No man can affirm that self-denial ever injured him; on the\r\ncontrary, self-restraint has been liberty, strength and blessing. Solemnly\r\nask young men to remember this when temptation and passion strive as a\r\nfloodtide to move them from the anchorage and peace of self-restraint.\r\nBeware of the deceitful stream of temporary gratification, whose eddying\r\ncurrent drifts towards license, shame, disease and death. Remember how\r\nquickly moral power declines, how rapidly the edge of the fatal maelstrom\r\nis reached, how near the vortex, how terrible the penalty, how fearful the\r\nsentence of everlasting punishment!\r\n\r\n4. FRANK DISCUSSION.--The time has arrived for a full and frank discussion\r\nof those things which affect the personal purity. Thousands are suffering\r\nto-day from various weaknesses, the causes of which they have never\r\nlearned. Manly vigor is not increasing with that rapidity which a Christian\r\nage demands. Means of dissipation are on the increase. It is high time,\r\ntherefore, that every lover of the race should call a halt, and inquire\r\ninto the condition of things. Excessive modesty on this subject is not\r\nvirtue. Timidity in presenting unpleasant but important truths has\r\npermitted untold damage in every age.\r\n\r\n5. MAN IS A CARELESS BEING.--He is very much inclined to sinful things. He\r\nmore often does that which is wrong than that which is right, because it is\r\neasier, and, for the moment, perhaps, more satisfying to the flesh. The\r\nCreator is often blamed for man's weaknesses and inconsistencies. This is\r\nwrong. God did not intend that we should be mere machines, but free moral\r\nagents. We are privileged to choose between good and evil. Hence, if we\r\nperseveringly choose the latter, and make a miserable failure of life, we\r\nshould blame only ourselves.\r\n\r\n6. THE PULPIT.--Would that every pulpit in the land might join hands with\r\nthe medical profession and cry out with no uncertain sound against the\r\nmighty evils herein stigmatized! It would work a revolution for which\r\ncoming society could never cease to be grateful.\r\n\r\n7. STRIVE TO ATTAIN A HIGHER LIFE.--Strive to attain unto a higher and\r\nbetter life. Beware of all excesses, of whatever nature, and guard your\r\npersonal purity with sacred determination. Let every aspiration be upward,\r\nand be strong in every good resolution. Seek the light, for in light there\r\nis life, while in darkness there is decay and death. {33}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFIDENCE THAT SOMETIMES MAKES TROUBLE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{34}\r\n\r\nHow to Write All Kinds of Letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. From the President in his cabinet to the laborer in the street; from the\r\nlady in her parlor to the servant in her kitchen; from the millionaire to\r\nthe beggar; from the emigrant to the settler; from every country and under\r\nevery combination of circumstances, letter writing in all its forms and\r\nvarieties is most important to the advancement, welfare and happiness of\r\nthe human family.\r\n\r\n2. EDUCATION.---The art of conveying thought through the medium of written\r\nlanguage is so valuable and so necessary, a thorough knowledge of the\r\npractice must be desirable to every one. For merely to write a good letter\r\nrequires the exercise of much of the education and talent of any writer.\r\n\r\n3. A GOOD LETTER.--A good letter must be correct in every mechanical\r\ndetail, finished in style, interesting in substance, and intelligible in\r\nconstruction. Few there are who do not need write them; yet a letter\r\nperfect in detail is rarer than any other specimen of composition.\r\n\r\n4. PENMANSHIP.--It is folly to suppose that the faculty for writing a good\r\nhand is confined to any particular persons. There is no one who can write\r\nat all, but what can write well, if only the necessary pains are practiced.\r\nPractice makes perfect. Secure a few copy books and write an hour each day.\r\nYou will soon write a good hand. {35}\r\n\r\n5. WRITE PLAINLY.--Every word of even the most trifling document should be\r\nwritten in such clear characters that it would be impossible to mistake it\r\nfor another word, or the writer may find himself in the position of the\r\nEastern merchant who, writing to the Indies for five thousand mangoes,\r\nreceived by the next vessel five hundred monkies, with a promise of more in\r\nthe next cargo.\r\n\r\n6. HASTE.--Hurry is no excuse for bad writing, because any one of sense\r\nknows that everything hurried is liable to be ruined. Dispatch may be\r\nacquired, but hurry will ruin everything. If, however, you must write\r\nslowly to write well, then be careful not to hurry at all, for the few\r\nmoments you will gain by rapid writing will never compensate you for the\r\ndisgrace of sending an ill-written letter.\r\n\r\n7. NEATNESS.--Neatness is also of great importance. A fair white sheet with\r\nhandsomely written words will be more welcome to any reader than a blotted,\r\nbedaubed page covered with erasures and dirt, even if the matter in each be\r\nof equal value and interest. Erasures, blots, interlineations always spoil\r\nthe beauty of any letter.\r\n\r\n8. BAD SPELLING.--When those who from faulty education, or forgetfulness\r\nare doubtful about the correct spelling of any word, it is best to keep a\r\ndictionary at hand, and refer to it upon such occasions. It is far better\r\nto spend a few moments in seeking for a doubtful word, than to dispatch an\r\nill-spelled letter, and the search will probably impress the spelling upon\r\nthe mind for a future occasion.\r\n\r\n9. CARELESSNESS.--Incorrect spelling will expose the most important or\r\ninteresting letter to the severest sarcasm and ridicule. However perfect in\r\nall other respects, no epistle that is badly spelled will be regarded as\r\nthe work of an educated gentleman or lady. Carelessness will never be\r\nconsidered, and to be ignorant of spelling is to expose an imperfect\r\neducation at once.\r\n\r\n10. AN EXCELLENT PRACTICE.--After writing a letter, read it over carefully,\r\ncorrect all the errors and re-write it. If you desire to become a good\r\nletter writer, improve your penmanship, improve your language and grammar,\r\nre-writing once or twice every letter that you have occasion to write,\r\nwhether on social or business subjects.\r\n\r\n11. PUNCTUATION.--A good rule for punctuation is to punctuate where the\r\nsense requires it, after writing a letter and reading it over carefully you\r\nwill see where the punctuation marks are required, you can readily\r\ndetermine where the sense requires it, so that your letter will convey the\r\ndesired meaning. {36}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n12. CORRESPONDENCE.--There is no better school or better source for\r\nself-improvement than a pleasant correspondence between friends. It is not\r\nat all difficult to secure a good list of correspondents if desired. The\r\nyoung people who take advantage of such opportunities for self-improvement\r\nwill be much more popular in the community and in society. Letter writing\r\ncultivates the habit of study; it cultivates the mind, the heart, and\r\nstimulates self-improvement in general.\r\n\r\n13. FOLDING.--Another bad practice with those unaccustomed to corresponding\r\nis to fold the sheet of writing in such a fantastic manner as to cause the\r\nreceiver much annoyance in opening it. To the sender it may appear a very\r\ningenious performance, but to the receiver it is only a source of vexation\r\nand annoyance, and may prevent the communication receiving the attention it\r\nwould otherwise merit.\r\n\r\n14. SIMPLE STYLE.--The style of letter writing should be simple and\r\nunaffected, not raised on stilts and indulging in pedantic displays which\r\nare mostly regarded as cloaks of ignorance. Repeated literary quotations,\r\ninvolved sentences, long-sounding words and scraps of Latin, French and\r\nother languages are, generally speaking, out of place, and should not be\r\nindulged in.\r\n\r\n15. THE RESULT.--A well written letter has opened the way to prosperity for\r\nmany a one, has led to many a happy marriage and constant friendship, and\r\nhas secured many a good service in time of need; for it is in some measure\r\na photograph of the writer, and may inspire love or hatred, regard or\r\naversion in the reader, just as the glimpse of a portrait often determine\r\nus, in our estimate, of the worth of the person represented. Therefore, one\r\nof the roads to fortune runs through the ink bottle, and if we want to\r\nattain a certain end in love, friendship or business, we must trace out the\r\nroute correctly with the pen in our hand.\r\n\r\n{37}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHOW TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER.\r\n\r\n1. LOVE.--There is no greater or more profound reality than love. Why that\r\nreality should be obscured by mere sentimentalism, with all its train of\r\nabsurdities is incomprehensible. There is no nobler possession than the\r\nlove of another. There is no higher gift from one human being to another\r\nthan love. The gift and the possession are true sanctifiers of life, and\r\nshould be worn as precious jewels without affectation and without\r\nbashfulness. For this reason there is nothing to be ashamed of in a love\r\nletter, provided it be sincere.\r\n\r\n2. FORFEITS.--No man need consider that he forfeits dignity if he speaks\r\nwith his whole heart: no woman need fear she forfeits her womanly\r\nattributes if she responds as her heart bids her respond. \"Perfect love\r\ncasteth out fear\" is as true now as when the maxim was first given to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n3. TELLING THEIR LOVE.--The generality of the sex is love to be loved: how\r\nare they to know the fact that they {38} are loved unless they are told? To\r\nwrite a sensible love letter requires more talent than to solve, with your\r\npen, a profound problem in philosophy. Lovers must not then expect much\r\nfrom each other's epistles.\r\n\r\n4. CONFIDENTIAL.--Ladies and gentlemen who correspond with each other\r\nshould never be guilty of exposing any of the contents of any letters\r\nwritten expressing confidence, attachment or love. The man who confides in\r\na lady and honors her with his confidence should be treated with perfect\r\nsecurity and respect, and those who delight in showing their confidential\r\nletters to others are unworthy, heartless and unsafe companions.\r\n\r\n5. RETURN OF LETTERS.--If letters were written under circumstances which no\r\nlonger exist and all confidential relations are at an end, then all letters\r\nshould be promptly returned.\r\n\r\n6. HOW TO BEGIN A LOVE LETTER.--How to begin a love letter has been no\r\ndoubt the problem of lovers and suitors of all ages and nations. Fancy the\r\nyouth of Young America with lifted pen, thinking how he shall address his\r\nbeloved. Much depends upon this letter. What shall he say, and how shall he\r\nsay it, is the great question. Perseverance, however, will solve the\r\nproblem and determine results.\r\n\r\n7. FORMS OF BEGINNING A LOVE LETTER.--Never say, \"My Dearest Nellie,\" \"My\r\nAdored Nellie,\" or \"My Darling Nellie,\" until Nellie has first called you\r\n\"My Dear,\" or has given you to understand that such familiar terms are\r\npermissible. As a rule a gentleman will never err if he says \"Dear Miss\r\nNellie,\" and if the letters are cordially reciprocated the \"Miss\" may in\r\ntime be omitted, or other familiar terms used instead. In addressing a\r\nwidow \"Dear Madam,\" or, \"My Dear Madam,\" will be a proper form until\r\nsufficient intimacy will justify the use of other terms.\r\n\r\n8. RESPECT.--A lady must always be treated with respectful delicacy, and a\r\ngentleman should never use the term \"Dear\" or \"My Dear\" under any\r\ncircumstances unless he knows it is perfectly acceptable or a long and\r\nfriendly acquaintance justifies it.\r\n\r\n9. HOW TO FINISH A LETTER.--A letter will be suggested by the remarks on\r\nhow to begin one. \"Yours respectfully,\" \"Yours truly,\" \"Yours sincerely,\"\r\n\"Yours affectionately,\" \"Yours ever affectionately,\" \"Yours most\r\naffectionately,\" \"Ever yours,\" \"Ever your own,\" or \"Yours,\" are all\r\nappropriate, each depending upon the beginning of the letter. It is\r\ndifficult to see any phrase which could be added to them which would carry\r\nmore meaning than they {39} contain. People can sign themselves \"adorers\"\r\nand such like, but they do so at the peril of good taste. It is not good\r\nthat men or women \"worship\" each other--if they succeed in preserving\r\nreciprocal love and esteem they will have cause for great contentment.\r\n\r\n10. PERMISSION.--No young man should ever write to a young lady any letter,\r\nformal or informal, unless he has first sought her permission to do so.\r\n\r\n11. SPECIAL FORMS.--We give various forms or models of love letters to be\r\n_studied, not copied_. We have given no replies to the forms given, as\r\nevery letter written will naturally suggest an answer. A careful study will\r\nbe a great help to many who have not enjoyed the advantages of a literary\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_FORMS OF SOCIAL LETTERS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_1.--From a Young Lady to a Clergyman Asking a Recommendation._\r\n\r\nNantwich, May 18th, 1894.\r\n\r\nReverend and Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nHaving seen an advertisment for a school mistress in the Daily Times, I\r\nhave been recommended to offer myself as a candidate.

The simile is eminently correct, for you,\r\nmy dear girl, are a magnet, and my heart is as true to you as steel. I\r\nshall make my absence as brief as possible. Not a day, not an hour, not a\r\nminute, shall I waste either in going or returning. Oh, this business; but\r\nI won't complain, for we must have something for our hive besides\r\nhoney--something that rhymes with it--and that we must have it, I must\r\nbestir myself. You will find me a faithful correspondent. Like the spider,\r\nI shall drop a line by (almost) every post; and mind, you must give me\r\nletter for letter. I can't give you credit.

Time does\r\nnot run on with me now at the same pace as with other people; the hours\r\nseem days, the days weeks, while I am absent from you, and I have no faith\r\nin the accuracy of clocks and almanacs. Ah! if there were truth in\r\nclairvoyance, wouldn't I be with you at this moment! I wonder if you are as\r\nimpatient to see me as I am to fly to you? Sometimes it seems as if I must\r\nleave business and everything else to the Fates, and take the first train\r\nto Dawson. However, the hours do move, though they don't appear to, and in\r\na few more weeks we shall meet again. Let me hear from you as frequently as\r\npossible in the meantime. Tell me of your health, your amusements and your\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nRemember that every word you write will be a comfort to me.\r\n\r\n          Unchangeably yours,\r\n                  WILLIAM MILLER.\r\n\r\nTo Miss Kate Martin,\r\nDawson, N. D.\r\n\r\n_15.--A Declaration of Love at First Sight_.\r\n\r\nWaterford, Maine, May 8th, 1894.\r\n\r\nDear Miss Searles:\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been in your society but once, the impression you have made\r\nupon me is so deep and powerful that I cannot forbear writing to you, in\r\ndefiance of all rules of etiquette. Affection is sometimes of slow growth:\r\n{46} but sometimes it springs up in a moment. In half an hour after I was\r\nintroduced to you my heart was no longer my own. I have not the assurance\r\nto suppose that I have been fortunate enough to create any interest in\r\nyours; but will you allow me to cultivate your acquaintance in the hope of\r\nbeing able to win your regard in the course of time? Petitioning for a few\r\nlines in reply,\r\n\r\n          I remain, dear Miss Searles,\r\n              Yours devotedly,\r\n                  E. C. NICKS.\r\n\r\nMiss E. Searles,\r\nWaterford, Maine.\r\n\r\n_16.--Proposing Marriage._\r\n\r\nWednesday, October 20th, 1894.\r\n\r\nDearest Etta:\r\n\r\nThe delightful hours I have passed in your society have left an impression\r\non my mind that is altogether indelible, and cannot be effaced even by time\r\nitself. The frequent opportunities I have possessed, of observing the\r\nthousand acts of amiability and kindness which mark the daily tenor of your\r\nlife, have ripened my feelings of affectionate regard into a passion at\r\nonce ardent and sincere, until I have at length associated my hopes of\r\nfuture happiness with the idea of you as a life partner, in them. Believe\r\nme, dearest Etta, this is no puerile fancy, but the matured results of a\r\nlong and warmly cherished admiration of your many charms of person and\r\nmind. It is love--pure, devoted love, and I feel confident that your\r\nknowledge of my character will lead you to ascribe my motives to their true\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nMay I then implore you to consult your own heart, and should this avowal of\r\nmy fervent and honorable passion for you be crowned with your acceptance\r\nand approval, to grant me permission to refer the matter to your parents.\r\nAnxiously awaiting your answer,\r\n\r\n          I am, dearest Etta,\r\n              Your sincere and faithful lover,\r\n                  GEO. COURTRIGHT.\r\n\r\nTo Miss Etta Jay,\r\nMalden, Ill.\r\n\r\n{47}\r\n\r\n_17.--From a Gentleman to a Widow._\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, May 10th, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Mrs. Freeman:\r\n\r\nI am sure you are too clear-sighted not to have observed the profound\r\nimpression which your amiable qualities, intelligence and personal\r\nattractions have made upon my heart, and as you have not repelled my\r\nattentions nor manifested displeasure when I ventured to hint at the deep\r\ninterest I felt in your welfare and happiness, I cannot help hoping that\r\nyou will receive an explicit expression of my attachments, kindly and\r\nfavorably. I wish it were in my power to clothe the feelings I entertain\r\nfor you in such words as should make my pleadings irresistible; but, after\r\nall, what could I say, more than you are very dear to me, and that the most\r\nearnest desire of my soul is to have the privilege of calling you my wife?\r\nDo you, can you love me? You will not, I am certain, keep me in suspense,\r\nfor you are too good and kind to trifle for a moment with sincerity like\r\nmine. Awaiting your answer,\r\n\r\n          I remain with respectful affection,\r\n              Ever yours,\r\n                  HENRY MURRAY.\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia Freeman,\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n_18.--From a Lady to an Inconstant Lover._\r\n\r\nDear Harry:\r\n\r\nIt is with great reluctance that I enter upon a subject which has given me\r\ngreat pain, and upon which silence has become impossible if I would\r\npreserve my self-respect. You cannot but be aware that I have just reason\r\nfor saying that you have much displeased me. You have apparently forgotten\r\nwhat is due to me, circumstanced as we are, thus far at least. You cannot\r\nsuppose that I can tamely see you disregard my feelings, by conduct toward\r\nother ladies from which I should naturally have the right to expect you to\r\nabstain. I am not so vulgar a person as to be jealous. When there is cause\r\nto infer changed feelings, or unfaithfulness to promises of constancy,\r\njealousy is not the remedy. What the remedy is I need not say--we both of\r\nus have it in our hands. I am sure you will agree with me that we must come\r\nto some understanding by which the future shall be governed. Neither you\r\nnor I can bear a divided allegiance. Believe me that I write more in sorrow\r\nthan in anger. You have made me very unhappy, and perhaps thoughtlessly.\r\nBut it will take much to reassure me of your unaltered regard.\r\n\r\n          Yours truly,\r\n              EMMA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{48}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODESTY.\r\nACT NATURAL AND SPEAK WELL OF ALL PEOPLE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{49}\r\n\r\nHints and Helps on Good Behavior at all Times and at all Places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUMAN FACE, LIKE A FLOWER, SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.]\r\n\r\n1. It takes acquaintance to found a noble esteem, but politeness prepares\r\nthe way. Indeed, as Montaigne says, Courtesy begets esteem at sight.\r\nUrbanity is half of affability, and affability is a charm worth possessing.\r\n\r\n2. A pleasing demeanor is often the scales by which the pagan weighs the\r\nChristian. It is not virtue, but virtue inspires it. There are\r\ncircumstances in which it takes a great and strong soul to pass under the\r\nlittle yoke of courtesy, but it is a passport to a greater soul standard.\r\n\r\n3. Matthew Arnold says, \"Conduct is three-fourths of character,\" and\r\nChristian benignity draws the line for conduct. A high sense of rectitude,\r\na lowly soul, with a pure and kind {50} heart are elements of nobility\r\nwhich will work out in the life of a human being at home--everywhere.\r\n\"Private refinement makes public gentility.\"\r\n\r\n4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your resentment. Remember\r\nthat if you permit revenge or malice to occupy your soul, you are ruined.\r\n\r\n5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish the blues; a cheerful saguine spirit\r\nbegets cheer and hope.\r\n\r\n6. Be trustworthy and be trustful.\r\n\r\n7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good reading and good\r\nexpression; they will yield perpetual interest.\r\n\r\n8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in local occurrences,\r\nbut abhor gossip, and above all scandal.\r\n\r\n9. Banish a self-conscience spirit--the source of much awkwardness--with a\r\nconstant aim to make others happy. Remember that it is incumbent upon\r\ngentlemen and ladies alike to be neat in habits.\r\n\r\n10. The following is said to be a correct posture for walking. Head\r\nerect--not too rigid--chin in, shoulders back. Permit no unnecessary motion\r\nabout the thighs. Do not lean over to one side in walking, standing or\r\nsitting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is deforming and\r\ntherefore unhealthful.\r\n\r\n11. Beware of affectation and of Beau Brummel airs.\r\n\r\n12. If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the arc should be\r\nlimited, and the lady will manage them much more gracefully, if they almost\r\ntouch the clothing.\r\n\r\n13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. We could almost say,\r\nforget the hands except to keep them clean, including the nails, cordial\r\nand helpful. One hand may rest easily in the other. Study repose of\r\nattitude here as well as in the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not point elsewhere,\r\nas a rule.\r\n\r\n15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a slight bow and smile,\r\nas you speak.\r\n\r\n16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. Never under any\r\ncircumstances wink at another or communicate by furtive looks.\r\n\r\n17. Should you chance to be the rejected suitor of a lady, bear in mind\r\nyour own self-respect, as well as the inexorable laws {51} of society, and\r\nbow politely when you meet her. Reflect that you do not stand before all\r\nwoman-kind as you do at her bar. Do not resent the bitterness of\r\nflirtation. No lady or gentleman will flirt. Remember ever that painful\r\nprediscovery is better than later disappointment. Let such experience spur\r\nyou to higher exertion.\r\n\r\n18. Discretion should be exercised in introducing persons. Of two gentlemen\r\nwho are introduced, if one is superior in rank or age, he is the one to\r\nwhom the introduction should be made. Of two social equals, if one be a\r\nstranger in the place, his name should be mentioned first.\r\n\r\n19. In general the simpler the introduction the better.\r\n\r\n20. Before introducing a gentleman to a lady, remember that she is entitled\r\nto hold you responsible for the acquaintance. The lady is the one to whom\r\nthe gentleman is presented, which may be done thus: \"Miss A, permit me to\r\nintroduce to you my friend, Mr. B.\"; or, \"Miss A., allow me to introduce\r\nMr. B.\" If mutual and near friends of yours, say simply, \"Miss A., Mr. B.\"\r\n\r\n21. Receive the introduction with a slight bow and the acknowledgment,\r\n\"Miss A., I am happy to make your acquaintance\"; or, \"Mr. B., I am pleased\r\nto meet you.\" There is no reason why such stereotyped expressions should\r\nalways be used, but something similar is expected. Do not extend the hand\r\nusually.\r\n\r\n22. A true lady will avoid familiarity in her deportment towards gentlemen.\r\nA young lady should not permit her gentlemen friends to address her by her\r\nhome name, and the reverse is true. Use the title Miss and Mr.\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n23. Ladies should be frank and cordial towards their lady friends, but\r\nnever gushing.\r\n\r\n24. Should you meet a friend twice or oftener, at short intervals, it is\r\npolite to bow slightly each time after the first.\r\n\r\n25. A lady on meeting a gentleman with whom she has slight acquaintance\r\nwill make a medium bow--neither too decided nor too slight or stiff.\r\n\r\n26. For a gentleman to take a young lady's arm, is to intimate that she is\r\nfeeble, and young ladies resent the mode.\r\n\r\n27. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she expects to\r\nmeet a gentleman acquaintance, she should have a chaperon to accompany her,\r\na person of mature years when possible, and never a giddy girl.\r\n\r\n28. A lady should not ask a gentleman to walk with her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{52}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE ETIQUETTE IN A FEW PRACTICAL RULES.\r\n\r\n_1. If you desire to be respected, keep clean. The finest attire and\r\ndecorations will add nothing to the appearance or beauty of an untidy\r\nperson._\r\n\r\n_2. Clean clothing, clean skin, clean hands, including the nails, and\r\nclean, white teeth, are a requisite passport for good society._\r\n\r\n_3. A bad breath should be carefully remedied, whether it proceeds from the\r\nstomach or from decayed teeth._\r\n\r\n_4. To pick the nose, finger about the ears, or scratch the head or any\r\nother part of the person, in company, is decidedly vulgar._\r\n\r\n_5. When you call at any private residence, do not neglect to clean your\r\nshoes thoroughly._\r\n\r\n_6. A gentleman should always remove his hat in the presence of ladies,\r\nexcept out of doors, and then he should lift or touch his hat in\r\nsalutation. On meeting a lady a well-bred gentleman will always lift his\r\nhat._\r\n\r\n_7. An invitation to a lecture, concert, or other entertainment, may be\r\neither verbal or written, but should always be made at least twenty-four\r\nhours before the time._ {53}\r\n\r\n_8. On entering a hall or church the gentleman should precede the lady in\r\nwalking up the aisle, or walk by her side, if the aisle is broad enough._\r\n\r\n_9. A gentleman should always precede a lady upstairs, and follow her\r\ndownstairs._\r\n\r\n_10. Visitors should always observe the customs of the church with\r\nreference to standing, sitting, or kneeling during the services._\r\n\r\n_11. On leaving a hall or church at the close of entertainment or services,\r\nthe gentleman should precede the lady._\r\n\r\n_12. A gentleman walking with a lady should carry the parcels, and never\r\nallow the lady to be burdened with anything of the kind._\r\n\r\n_13. A gentleman meeting a lady on the street and wishing to speak to her,\r\nshould never detain her, but may turn around and walk in the same direction\r\nshe is going, until the conversation is completed._\r\n\r\n_14. If a lady is traveling with a gentleman, simply as a friend, she\r\nshould place the amount of her expenses in his hands, or insist on paying\r\nthe bills herself._\r\n\r\n_15. Never offer a lady costly gifts unless you are engaged to her, for it\r\nlooks as if you were trying to purchase her goodwill; and when you make a\r\npresent to a lady use no ceremony whatever._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Children should early be taught the lesson of Propriety and\r\nGood Manners.]\r\n\r\n_16. Never carry on a private conversation in company. If secrecy is\r\nnecessary, withdraw from the company._\r\n\r\n_17. Never sit with your back to another without asking to be excused._\r\n\r\n_18. It is as unbecoming for a gentleman to sit with legs crossed as it is\r\nfor a lady._\r\n\r\n_19. Never thrum with your fingers, rub your hands, yawn, or sigh aloud in\r\ncompany._\r\n\r\n_20. Loud laughter, loud talking, or other boisterous manifestations should\r\nbe checked in the society of others, especially on the street and in public\r\nplaces._ {54}\r\n\r\n_21. When you are asked to sing or play in company, do so without being\r\nurged, or refuse in a way that shall be final; and when music is being\r\nrendered in company, show politeness to the musician by giving attention.\r\nIt is very impolite to keep up a conversation. If you do not enjoy the\r\nmusic, keep silent._\r\n\r\n_22. Contentions, contradictions, etc., in society should be carefully\r\navoided._\r\n\r\n_23. Pulling out your watch in company, unless asked the time of day, is a\r\nmark of the demi-bred. It looks as if you were tired of the company and the\r\ntime dragged heavily._\r\n\r\n_24. You should never decline to be introduced to any one or all of the\r\nguests present at a party to which you have been invited._\r\n\r\n_25. A gentleman who escorts a lady to a party, or who has a lady placed\r\nunder his care, is under particular obligations to attend to her wants and\r\nsee that she has proper attention. He should introduce her to others, and\r\nendeavor to make the evening pleasant. He should escort her to the supper\r\ntable and provide for her wants._\r\n\r\n_26. To take small children or dogs with you on a visit of ceremony is\r\naltogether vulgar, though in visiting familiar friends, children are not\r\nobjectionable._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{55} [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN BRIDE'S WEDDING OUTFIT.]\r\n\r\n{56}\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE OF CALLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of making calls it is the correct thing:\r\n\r\nFor the caller who arrived first to leave first.\r\n\r\nTo return a first call within a week and in person.\r\n\r\nTo call promptly and in person after a first invitation.\r\n\r\nFor the mother or chaperon to invite a gentleman to call.\r\n\r\nTo call within a week after any entertainment to which one has been\r\ninvited.\r\n\r\nYou should call upon an acquaintance who has recently returned from a\r\nprolonged absence.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to make the first call upon people in a higher social\r\nposition, if one is asked to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to call, after an engagement has been announced, or a marriage\r\nhas taken place, in the family.\r\n\r\nFor the older residents in the city or street to call upon the newcomers to\r\ntheir neighborhood is a long recognized custom.\r\n\r\nIt is proper, after a removal from one part of the city to another, to send\r\nout cards with one's new address upon them.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain what are the prescribed hours for calling in the place where\r\none is living, or making a visit, and to adhere to those hours is a duty\r\nthat must not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nA gentleman should ask for the lady of the house as well as the young\r\nladies, and leave cards for her as well as for the head of the family. {57}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Improve Your Speech by Reading._]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE IN YOUR SPEECH.\r\n\r\nDon't say Miss or Mister without the person's name.\r\n\r\nDon't say pants for trousers.\r\n\r\nDon't say gents for gentlemen.\r\n\r\nDon't say female for woman.\r\n\r\nDon't say elegant to mean everything that pleases you.\r\n\r\nDon't say genteel for well-bred.\r\n\r\nDon't say ain't for isn't.\r\n\r\nDon't say I done it for I did it.\r\n\r\nDon't say he is older than me; say older than I.\r\n\r\nDon't say she does not see any; say she does not see at all.\r\n\r\nDon't say not as I know; say not that I know.\r\n\r\nDon't say he calculates to get off; say he expects to get off.\r\n\r\nDon't say he don't; say he doesn't.\r\n\r\nDon't say she is some better; say she is somewhat better.\r\n\r\nDon't say where are you stopping?

Your conduct on the street should always be modest and dignified. Ladies\r\nshould carefully avoid all loud and boisterous conversation or laughter and\r\nall undue liveliness in public.\r\n\r\n2. When walking on the street do not permit yourself to be absent-minded,\r\nas to fail to recognize a friend; do not go along reading a book or\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\n3. In walking with a lady on the street give her the inner side of the\r\nwalk, unless the outside is the safer part; in which case she is entitled\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n4. Your arm should not be given to any lady except your wife or a near\r\nrelative, or a very old lady, during the day, unless her comfort or safety\r\nrequires it. At night the arm should always be offered; also in ascending\r\nthe steps of a public building.\r\n\r\n5. In crossing the street a lady should gracefully raise her dress a little\r\nabove her ankle with one hand. To raise the dress with both hands is\r\nvulgar, except in places where the mud is very deep.\r\n\r\n6. A gentleman meeting a lady acquaintance on the street should not presume\r\nto join her in her walk without first asking her permission.\r\n\r\n7. If you have anything to say to a lady whom you may happen to meet in the\r\nstreet, however intimate you may be, do not stop her, but turn round and\r\nwalk in company with her; you can take leave at the end of the street.\r\n\r\n8. A lady should not venture out upon the street alone after dark. By so\r\ndoing she compromises her dignity, and exposes herself to indignity at the\r\nhands of the rougher class.\r\n\r\n9. Never offer to shake hands with a lady in the street if you have on dark\r\nor soiled gloves, as you may soil hers.\r\n\r\n10. A lady does not form acquaintances upon the street, or seek to attract\r\nthe attention of the other sex or of persons of her own sex. Her conduct is\r\nalways modest and unassuming. Neither does a lady demand services or favors\r\nfrom a gentleman. She accepts them graciously, always {60} expressing her\r\nthanks. A gentleman will not stand on the street corners, or in hotel\r\ndoorways, or store windows and gaze impertinently at ladies as they pass\r\nby. This is the exclusive business of loafers.\r\n\r\n11. In walking with a lady who has your arm, should you have to cross the\r\nstreet, do not disengage your arm and go around upon the outside, unless\r\nthe lady's comfort renders it necessary. In walking with a lady, where it\r\nis necessary for you to proceed singly, always go before her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE BETWEEN SEXES.\r\n\r\n1. A lady should be a lady, and a gentleman a gentleman under any and all\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n2. FEMALE INDIFFERENCE TO MAN.--There is nothing that affects the nature\r\nand pleasure of man so much as a proper and friendly recognition from a\r\nlady, and as women are more or less dependent upon man's good-will, either\r\nfor gain or pleasure, it surely stands to their interest to be reasonably\r\npleasant and courteous in his presence or society. Indifference is always a\r\npoor investment, whether in society or business.\r\n\r\n3. GALLANTRY AND LADYISM should be a prominent feature in the education of\r\nyoung people. Politeness to ladies cultivates the intellect and refines the\r\nsoul, and he who can be easy and entertaining in the society of ladies has\r\nmastered one of the greatest accomplishments. There is nothing taught in\r\nschool, academy or college, that contributes so much to the happiness of\r\nman as a full development of his social and moral qualities.\r\n\r\n4. LADYLIKE ETIQUETTE.--No woman can afford to treat men rudely. A lady\r\nmust have a high intellectual and moral ideal and hold herself above\r\nreproach. She must remember that the art of pleasing and entertaining\r\ngentlemen is infinitely more ornamental than laces, ribbons or diamonds.\r\nDress and glitter may please man, but it will never benefit him.\r\n\r\n5. CULTIVATE DEFICIENCIES.--Men and women poorly sexed treat each other\r\nwith more or less indifference, whereas a hearty sexuality inspires both to\r\na right estimation of the faculties and qualities of each other. Those who\r\nare deficient should seek society and overcome their deficiencies. While\r\nsome naturally inherit faculties as entertainers, others are compelled to\r\nacquire them by cultivation. {61}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASKING AN HONEST QUESTION.]\r\n\r\n6. LADIES' SOCIETY.--He who seeks ladies' society should seek an education\r\nand should have a pure heart and a pure mind. Read good, pure and wholesome\r\nliterature and study human nature, and you will always be a favorite in the\r\nsociety circle.\r\n\r\n7. WOMAN HATERS.--Some men with little refinement and strong sensual\r\nfeelings virtually insult and thereby disgust and repel every female they\r\nmeet. They look upon woman with an inherent vulgarity, and doubt the virtue\r\nand integrity of all alike. But it is because they are generally {62}\r\ninsincere and impure themselves, and with such a nature culture and\r\nrefinement are out of the question, there must be a revolution.\r\n\r\n8. MEN HATERS.--Women who look upon all men as odious, corrupt or hateful,\r\nare no doubt so themselves, though they may be clad in silk and sparkle\r\nwith diamonds and be as pretty as a lily; but their hypocrisy will out, and\r\nthey can never win the heart of a faithful, conscientious and well balanced\r\nman. A good woman has broad ideas and great sympathy. She respects all men\r\nuntil they are proven unworthy.\r\n\r\n9. FOND OF CHILDREN.--The man who is naturally fond of children will make a\r\ngood husband and a good father. So it behooves the young man, to notice\r\nchildren and cultivate the art of pleasing them. It will be a source of\r\ninterest, education and permanent benefit to all.\r\n\r\n10. EXCESSIVE LUXURY.--Although the association with ladies is an expensive\r\nluxury, yet it is not an expensive education. It elevates, refines,\r\nsanctifies and purifies, and improves the whole man. A young man who has a\r\npure and genuine respect for ladies, will not only make a good husband, but\r\na good citizen as well.\r\n\r\n11. MASCULINE ATTENTION.--No woman is entitled to any more attention than\r\nher loveliness and ladylike conduct will command. Those who are most\r\npleasing will receive the most attention, and those who desire more should\r\naspire to acquire more by cultivating those graces and virtues which\r\nennoble woman, but no lady should lower or distort her own true ideal, or\r\nsmother and crucify her conscience, in order to please any living man. A\r\ngood man will admire a good woman, and deceptions cannot long be concealed.\r\nHer show of dry goods or glitter of jewels cannot long cover up her\r\nimperfections or deceptions.\r\n\r\n12. PURITY.--Purity of purpose will solve all social problems. Let all\r\nstand on this exalted sexual platform, and teach every man just how to\r\ntreat the female sex, and every woman how to behave towards the masculine;\r\nand it will incomparably adorn the manners of both, make both happy in each\r\nother, and mutually develop each other's sexuality and humanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nPractical Rules on Table Manners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. Help ladies with a due appreciation; do not overload the plate of any\r\nperson you serve. Never pour gravy on a plate without permission. It spoils\r\nthe meat for some persons.\r\n\r\n2. Never put anything by force upon any one's plate. It is extremely\r\nill-bred, though extremely common, to press one to eat of anything.\r\n\r\n3. If at dinner you are requested to help any one to sauce or gravy, do not\r\npour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one side of them. Never load\r\ndown a person's plate with anything.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as you are helped, begin to eat, or at least begin to occupy\r\nyourself with what you have before you. Do not wait till your neighbors are\r\nserved--a custom that was long ago abandoned.\r\n\r\n5. Should you, however, find yourself at a table where they have the\r\nold-fashioned steel forks, eat with your knife, as the others do, and do\r\nnot let it be seen that you have any objection to doing so.\r\n\r\n6. Bread should be broken. To butter a large piece of bread and then bite\r\nit, as children do, is something the knowing never do. {64}\r\n\r\n7. In eating game or poultry do not touch the bones with your fingers. To\r\ntake a bone in the fingers for the purpose of picking it, is looked upon as\r\nbeing very inelegant.\r\n\r\n8. Never use your own knife or fork to help another. Use rather the knife\r\nor fork of the person you help.\r\n\r\n9. Never send your knife or fork, or either of them, on your plate when you\r\nsend for second supply.\r\n\r\n10. Never turn your elbows out when you use your knife and fork. Keep them\r\nclose to your sides.\r\n\r\n11. Whenever you use your fingers to convey anything to your mouth or to\r\nremove anything from the mouth, let it be the fingers of the left hand.\r\n\r\n12. Tea, coffee, chocolate and the like are drank from the cup and never\r\nfrom the saucer.\r\n\r\n13. In masticating your food, keep your mouth shut; otherwise you will make\r\na noise that will be very offensive to those around you.\r\n\r\n14. Don't attempt to talk with a full mouth. One thing at a time is as much\r\nas any man can do well.\r\n\r\n15. Should you find a worm or insect in your food, say nothing about it.\r\n\r\n16. If a dish is distasteful to you, decline it, and without comment.\r\n\r\n17. Never put bones or bits of fruit on the table cloth. Put them on the\r\nside of your plate.\r\n\r\n18. Do not hesitate to take the last piece on the dish, simply because it\r\nis the last. To do so is to directly express the fear that you would\r\nexhaust the supply.\r\n\r\n19. If you would be what you would like to be--abroad, take care that you\r\n_are_ what you would like to be--at home.\r\n\r\n20. Avoid picking your teeth at the table if possible; but if you must, do\r\nit, if you can, where you are not observed.\r\n\r\n21. If an accident of any kind soever should occur during dinner, the cause\r\nbeing who or what it may, you should not seem to note it.\r\n\r\n22. Should you be so unfortunate as to overturn or to break anything, you\r\nshould make no apology. You might let your regret appear in your face, but\r\nit would not be proper to put it in words.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nSocial Duties.\r\n\r\n  Man in Society is like a flower,\r\n  Blown in its native bed. 'Tis there alone\r\n  His faculties expanded in full bloom\r\n  Shine out, there only reach their proper use.--COWPER.\r\n\r\n  The primal duties shine aloft like stars;\r\n  The charities that soothe, and heal, and bless,\r\n  Are scatter'd at the feet of man like flowers.--WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n{66}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIVING A PARLOR RECITATION.]\r\n\r\n1. MEMBERSHIP IN SOCIETY.--Many fail to get hold of the idea that they are\r\nmembers of society. They seem to suppose that the social machinery of the\r\nworld is self-operating. They cast their first ballot with an emotion of\r\npride, perhaps, but are sure to pay their first tax with a groan. They see\r\npolitical organizations in active existence; the parish, and the church,\r\nand other important bodies that embrace in some form of society all men,\r\nare successfully operated; and yet these young men have no part or lot in\r\nthe matter. They do not think of giving a day's time to society.\r\n\r\n2. BEGIN EARLY.--One of the first things a young man should do is to see\r\nthat he is acting his part in society. The earlier this is begun the\r\nbetter. I think that the opponents of secret societies in colleges have\r\nfailed to estimate the benefit which it must be to every member to be\r\nobliged to contribute to the support of his particular organization, and to\r\nassume personal care and responsibility as a member. If these societies\r\nhave a tendency to teach the lessons of which I speak, they are a blessed\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n3. DO YOUR PART.--Do your part, and be a man among men. Assume your portion\r\nof social responsibility, and see that you discharge it well. If you do not\r\ndo this, then you are mean, and society has the right to despise you just\r\nas much as it chooses to do so. You are, to use a word more emphatic than\r\nagreeable, a sneak, and have not a claim upon your neighbors for a single\r\npolite word.\r\n\r\n4. A WHINING COMPLAINER.--Society, as it is called, is far more apt to pay\r\nits dues to the individual than the individual to society. Have you, young\r\nman, who are at home whining over the fact that you cannot get into\r\nsociety, done anything to give you a claim to social recognition? Are you\r\nable to make any return for social recognition and social privileges? Do\r\nyou know anything? What kind of coin do you propose to pay in the discharge\r\nof the obligation which comes upon you with social recognition? In other\r\nwords, as a return for what you wish to have society do for you, what can\r\nyou do for society? This is a very important question--more important to\r\nyou than to society. The question is, whether you will be a member of\r\nsociety by right, or by courtesy. If you have so mean a spirit as to be\r\ncontent to be a beneficiary of society--to receive favors and to confer\r\nnone--you have no business in the society to which you aspire. You are an\r\nexacting, conceited fellow.\r\n\r\n5. WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR?--Are you a good beau, and are you willing to make\r\nyourself useful in waiting on the {67} ladies on all occasions? Have you a\r\ngood set of teeth, which you are willing to show whenever the wit of the\r\ncompany gets off a good thing? Are you a true, straightforward, manly\r\nfellow, with whose healthful and uncorrupted nature it is good for society\r\nto come in contact? In short, do you possess anything of any social value?\r\nIf you do, and are willing to impart it, society will yield itself to your\r\ntouch. If you have nothing, then society, as such, owes you nothing.\r\nChristian philanthropy may put its arm around you, as a lonely young man,\r\nabout to spoil for want of something, but it is very sad and humiliating\r\nfor a young man to be brought to that. There are people who devote\r\nthemselves to nursing young men, and doing them good. If they invite you to\r\ntea, go by all means, and try your hand. If, in the course of the evening,\r\nyou can prove to them that your society is desirable, you have won a point.\r\nDon't be patronized.\r\n\r\n6. THE MORBID CONDITION.--Young men, you are apt to get into a morbid state\r\nof mind, which declines them to social intercourse. They become devoted to\r\nbusiness with such exclusiveness, that all social intercourse is irksome.\r\nThey go out to tea as if they were going to jail, and drag themselves to a\r\nparty as to an execution. This disposition is thoroughly morbid, and to be\r\novercome by going where you are invited, always, and with a sacrifice of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n7. THE COMMON BLUNDER.--Don't shrink from contact with anything but bad\r\nmorals. Men who affect your unhealthy minds with antipathy, will prove\r\nthemselves very frequently to be your best friends and most delightful\r\ncompanions. Because a man seems uncongenial to you, who are squeamish and\r\nfoolish, you have no right to shun him. We become charitable by knowing\r\nmen. We learn to love those whom we have despised by rubbing against them.\r\nDo you not remember some instance of meeting a man or woman whom you had\r\nnever previously known or cared to know--an individual, perhaps, against\r\nwhom you have entertained the strongest prejudices--but to whom you became\r\nbound by a lifelong friendship through the influence of a three days'\r\nintercourse? Yet, if you had not thus met, you would have carried through\r\nlife the idea that it would be impossible for you to give your fellowship\r\nto such an individual.\r\n\r\n8. THE FOOLISHNESS OF MAN.--God has introduced into human character\r\ninfinite variety, and for you to say that you do not love and will not\r\nassociate with a man because he is unlike you, is not only foolish but\r\nwrong. You are to remember that in the precise manner and decree in which\r\n{68} a man differs from you, do you differ from him; and that from his\r\nstandpoint you are naturally as repulsive to him, as he, from your\r\nstandpoint, is to you. So, leave all this talk of congeniality to silly\r\ngirls and transcendental dreamers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING ORANGES IN THE SUNNY SOUTH.]\r\n\r\n9. DO BUSINESS IN YOUR WAY AND BE HONEST.--Do your business in your own\r\nway, and concede to every man the privilege which you claim for yourself.\r\nThe more you mix with men, the less you will be disposed to quarrel, and\r\nthe more charitable and liberal will you become. The fact that you do not\r\nunderstand a man, is quite as likely to be your fault as his. There are a\r\ngood many chances in favor of the conclusion that, if you fail to like an\r\nindividual whose acquaintance you make it is through your own ignorance and\r\nilliberality. So I say, meet every man honestly; seek to know him; and you\r\nwill find that in those points in which he differs from you rests his power\r\nto instruct you, enlarge you, and do you good. Keep your heart open for\r\neverybody, and be sure that you shall have your reward. You shall find a\r\njewel under the most uncouth exterior; and associated with homeliest\r\nmanners and oddest ways and ugliest faces, you will find rare virtues,\r\nfragrant little humanities, and inspiring heroisms.\r\n\r\n10. WITHOUT SOCIETY, WITHOUT INFLUENCE.--Again: you can have no influence\r\nunless you are social. An unsocial man is as devoid of influence as an\r\nice-peak is of verdure. It is through social contact and absolute social\r\nvalue alone that you can accomplish any great social good. It is through\r\nthe invisible lines which you are able to attach to the minds with which\r\nyou are brought into association alone that you can tow society, with its\r\ndeeply freighted interests, to the great haven of your hope.\r\n\r\n11. THE REVENGE OF SOCIETY.--The revenge which society takes upon the man\r\nwho isolates himself, is as terrible as it is inevitable. The pride which\r\nsits alone will have the privilege of sitting alone in its sublime disgust\r\ntill it drops into the grave. The world sweeps by the man, carelessly,\r\nremorselessly, contemptuously. He has no hold upon society, because he is\r\nno part of it.\r\n\r\n12. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--You cannot move men until you are\r\none of them. They will not follow you until they have heard your voice,\r\nshaken your hand, and fully learned your principles and your sympathies. It\r\nmakes no difference how much you know, or how much you are capable of\r\ndoing. You may pile accomplishment upon acquisition mountain high; but if\r\nyou fail to be a social man, demonstrating to society that your lot is with\r\nthe rest, a {69} little child with a song in its mouth, and a kiss for all\r\nand a pair of innocent hands to lay upon the knees, shall lead more hearts\r\nand change the direction of more lives than you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{70}\r\n\r\nPoliteness.\r\n\r\n1. BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR.--Politeness has been described as the art of\r\nshowing, by external signs, the internal regard we have for others. But one\r\nmay be perfectly polite to another without necessarily paying a special\r\nregard for him. Good manners are neither more nor less than beautiful\r\nbehavior. It has been well said that \"a beautiful form is better than a\r\nbeautiful face, and a beautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form;\r\nit gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures--it is the finest of\r\nthe fine arts.\"\r\n\r\n2. TRUE POLITENESS.--The truest politeness comes of sincerity. It must be\r\nthe outcome of the heart, or it will make no lasting impression; for no\r\namount of polish can dispense with truthfulness. The natural character must\r\nbe allowed to appear, freed of its angularities and asperities. Though\r\npoliteness, in its best form, should resemble water--\"best when clearest,\r\nmost simple, and without taste\"--yet genius in a man will always cover many\r\ndefects of manner, and much will be excused to the strong and the original.\r\nWithout genuineness and individuality, human life would lose much of its\r\ninterest and variety, as well as its manliness and robustness of character.\r\n\r\n3. PERSONALITY OF OTHERS.--True politeness especially exhibits itself in\r\nregard for the personality of others. A man will respect the individuality\r\nof another if he wishes to be respected himself. He will have due regard\r\nfor his views and opinions, even though they differ from his own. The\r\nwell-mannered man pays a compliment to another, and sometimes even secures\r\nhis respect by patiently listening to him. He is simply tolerant and\r\nforbearant, and refrains from judging harshly; and harsh judgments of\r\nothers will almost invariably provoke harsh judgments of ourselves.\r\n\r\n4. THE IMPOLITE.--The impolite, impulsive man will, however, sometimes\r\nrather lose his friend than his joke. He may surely be pronounced a very\r\nfoolish person who secures another's hatred at the price of a moment's\r\ngratification. It was a saying of Burnel, the engineer--himself one of the\r\nkindest-natured of men--that \"spite and ill-nature are among the most\r\nexpensive luxuries in life.\" Dr. Johnson once said: \"Sir, a man has no more\r\nright to say a rude thing to another than to knock him down.\"\r\n\r\n5. FEELINGS OF OTHERS.--Want of respect for the feelings of others usually\r\noriginates in selfishness, and issues in {71} hardness and repulsiveness of\r\nmanner. It may not proceed from malignity so much, as from want of\r\nsympathy, and want of delicacy--a want of that perception of, and attention\r\nto, those little and apparently trifling things, by which pleasure is given\r\nor pain occasioned to others. Indeed, it may be said that in self-sacrifice\r\nin the ordinary intercourse of life, mainly consists the difference between\r\nbeing well and ill bred. Without some degree of self-restraint in society a\r\nman may be found almost insufferable. No one has pleasure in holding\r\nintercourse with such a person, and he is a constant source of annoyance to\r\nthose about him.\r\n\r\n6. DISREGARD OF OTHERS.--Men may show their disregard to others in various\r\nimpolite ways, as, for instance, by neglect of propriety in dress, by the\r\nabsence of cleanliness, or by indulging in repulsive habits. The slovenly,\r\ndirty person, by rendering himself physically disagreeable, sets the tastes\r\nand feelings of others at defiance, and is rude and uncivil, only under\r\nanother form.\r\n\r\n7. THE BEST SCHOOL OF POLITENESS.--The first and best school of politeness,\r\nas of character, is always the home, where woman is the teacher. The\r\nmanners of society at large are but the reflex of the manners of our\r\ncollective homes, neither better nor worse. Yet, with all the disadvantages\r\nof ungenial homes, men may practice self-culture of manner as of intellect,\r\nand learn by good examples to cultivate a graceful and agreeable behavior\r\ntowards others. Most men are like so many gems in the rough, which need\r\npolishing by contact with other and better natures, to bring out their full\r\nbeauty and lustre. Some have but one side polished, sufficient only to show\r\nthe delicate graining of the interior; but to bring out the full qualities\r\nof the gem, needs the discipline of experience, and contact with the best\r\nexamples of character in the intercourse of daily life.\r\n\r\n8. CAPTIOUSNESS OF MANNER.--While captiousness of manner, and the habit of\r\ndisputing and contradicting every thing said, is chilling and repulsive,\r\nthe opposite habit of assenting to, and sympathizing with, every statement\r\nmade, or emotion expressed, is almost equally disagreeable. It is unmanly,\r\nand is felt to be dishonest. \"It may seem difficult,\" says Richard Sharp,\r\n\"to steer always between bluntness and plain dealing, between merited\r\npraises and lavishing indiscriminate flattery; but it is very easy--good\r\nhumor, kindheartedness, and perfect simplicity, being all that are\r\nrequisite to do what is right in the right way.\" At the same time many are\r\nimpolite, not because they mean to be so, but because they are awkward, and\r\nperhaps know no better. {72}\r\n\r\n9. SHY PEOPLE.--Again many persons are thought to be stiff, reserved, and\r\nproud, when they are only shy. Shyness is characteristic of most people of\r\nthe Teutonic race. From all that can be learned of Shakespeare, it is to be\r\ninferred that he was an exceedingly shy man. The manner in which his plays\r\nwere sent into the world--for it is not known that he edited or authorized\r\nthe publication of a single one of them,--and the dates at which they\r\nrespectively appeared, are mere matters of conjecture.\r\n\r\n10. SELF-FORGETFULNESS.--True politeness is best evinced by\r\nself-forgetfulness, or self-denial in the interest of others. Mr. Garfield,\r\nour martyred president, was a gentleman of royal type. His friend, Col.\r\nRockwell, says of him: \"In the midst of his suffering he never forgets\r\nothers. For instance, to-day he said to me, 'Rockwell, there is a poor\r\nsoldier's widow who came to me before this thing occurred, and I promised\r\nher, she should be provided for. I want you to see that the matter is\r\nattended to at once.' He is the most docile patient I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n11. ITS BRIGHT SIDE.--We have thus far spoken of shyness as a defect. But\r\nthere is another way of looking at it; for even shyness has its bright\r\nside, and contains an element of good. Shy men and shy races are ungraceful\r\nand undemonstrative, because, as regards society at large, they are\r\ncomparatively unsociable. They do not possess those elegancies of manner\r\nacquired by free intercourse, which distinguish the social races, because\r\ntheir tendency is to shun society rather than to seek it. They are shy in\r\nthe presence of strangers, and shy even in their own families. They hide\r\ntheir affections under a robe of reserve, and when they do give way to\r\ntheir feelings, it is only in some very hidden inner chamber. And yet, the\r\nfeelings are there, and not the less healthy and genuine, though they are\r\nnot made the subject of exhibition to others.\r\n\r\n12. WORTHY OF CULTIVATION.--While, therefore, grace of manner, politeness\r\nof behavior, elegance of demeanor, and all the arts that contribute to make\r\nlife pleasant and beautiful, are worthy of cultivation, it must not be at\r\nthe expense of the more solid and enduring qualities of honesty, sincerity,\r\nand truthfulness. The fountain of beauty must be in the heart more than in\r\nthe eye, and if it does not tend to produce beautiful life and noble\r\npractice, it will prove of comparatively little avail. Politeness of manner\r\nis not worth much, unless it is accompanied by polite actions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{73}\r\n\r\nInfluence of Good Character.\r\n\r\n \"Unless above himself he can\r\n  Erect himself, how poor a thing is man!\"--DANIEL.\r\n\r\n    \"Character is moral order seen through the medium of an individual\r\n    nature--Men of character are the conscience of the society to which\r\n    they belong.\"--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n  The purest treasure mortal times afford,\r\n  Is--spotless reputation; that away,\r\n  Men are but gilded loam, or painted clay.\r\n  A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest\r\n  Is--a bold Spirit in a loyal breast.--SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n1. REPUTATION.--The two most precious things this side the grave are our\r\nreputation and our life. But it is to be lamented that the most\r\ncontemptible whisper may deprive us of the one, and the weakest weapon of\r\nthe other. A wise man, therefore, will be more anxious to deserve a fair\r\nname than to possess it, and this will teach him so to live, as not to be\r\nafraid to die.\r\n\r\n2. CHARACTER.--Character is one of the greatest motive powers in the world.\r\nIn its noblest embodiments, it exemplifies human nature in its highest\r\nforms, for it exhibits man at his best.\r\n\r\n3. THE HEART THAT RULES IN LIFE.--Although genius always commands\r\nadmiration, character most secures respect. The former is more the product\r\nof brain power, the latter of heart power; and in the long run it is the\r\nheart that rules in life. Men of genius stand to society in the relation of\r\nits intellect as men of character of its conscience: and while the former\r\nare admired, the latter are followed.\r\n\r\n4. THE HIGHEST IDEAL OF LIFE AND CHARACTER.--Commonplace though it may\r\nappear, this doing of one's duty embodies the highest ideal of life and\r\ncharacter. There may be nothing heroic about it; but the common lot of men\r\nis not heroic. And though the abiding sense of duty upholds man in his\r\nhighest attitudes, it also equally sustains him in the transaction of the\r\nordinary affairs of every-day existence. Man's life is \"centered in the\r\nsphere of common duties.\" The most influential of all the virtues are those\r\nwhich are the most in request for daily use. They wear the best, and last\r\nthe longest.\r\n\r\n5. WEALTH.--Wealth in the hands of men of weak purpose, or deficient\r\nself-control, or of ill regulated passions, is {74} only a temptation and a\r\nsnare--the source, it may be, of infinite mischief to themselves, and often\r\nto others.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, a condition of comparative poverty is compatible with\r\ncharacter in its highest form. A man may possess only his industry, his\r\nfrugality, his integrity, and yet stand high in the rank of true manhood.\r\nThe advice which Burns' father gave him was the best:\r\n\r\n \"He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing,\r\n  For without an honest, manly heart no man was worth regarding.\"\r\n\r\n6. CHARACTER IS PROPERTY.--It is the noblest of possessions. It is an\r\nestate in the general good-will and respect of men; they who invest in\r\nit--though they may not become rich in this world's goods--will find their\r\nreward in esteem and reputation fairly and honorably won. And it is right\r\nthat in life good qualities should tell--that industry, virtue, and\r\ngoodness should rank the highest--and that the really best men should be\r\nforemost.\r\n\r\n7. SIMPLE HONESTY OF PURPOSE.--This in a man goes a long way in life, if\r\nfounded on a just estimate of himself and a steady obedience to the rule he\r\nknows and feels to be right. It holds a man straight, gives him strength\r\nand sustenance, and forms a mainspring of vigorous action. No man is bound\r\nto be rich or great--no, nor to be wise--but every man is bound to be\r\nhonest and virtuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\nFamily Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAVENLY MUSIC.]\r\n\r\n1. GENTLENESS MUST CHARACTERIZE EVERY ACT OF AUTHORITY.--The storm of\r\nexcitement that may make the child start, bears no relation to actual\r\nobedience. The inner firmness, that sees and feels a moral conviction and\r\nexpects obedience, is only disguised and defeated by bluster. The more calm\r\nand direct it is, the greater certainty it has of dominion.\r\n\r\n2. FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF SMALL CHILDREN.--For the government of small\r\nchildren speak only in the authority of love, yet authority, loving and to\r\nbe obeyed. The most important lesson to impart is obedience to authority as\r\nauthority. The question of salvation with most children will be settled as\r\nsoon as they learn to obey parental authority. It establishes a habit and\r\norder of mind that is ready to accept divine authority. This precludes\r\nskepticism and disobedience, and induces that childlike trust and spirit\r\nset forth as a necessary state of salvation. Children that are never made\r\nto obey are left to drift into the sea of passion where the pressure for\r\nsurrender only tends to drive them at greater speed from the haven of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n3. HABITS OF SELF-DENIAL.--Form in the child habits of self-denial.\r\nPampering never matures good character.\r\n\r\n4. EMPHASIZE INTEGRITY.--Keep the moral tissues tough in integrity; then it\r\nwill hold a hook of obligations when once set in a sure place. There is\r\nnothing more vital. Shape all your experiments to preserve the integrity.\r\nDo not so reward it that it becomes mercenary. Turning State's evidence is\r\na dangerous experiment in morals. Prevent deceit from succeeding.\r\n\r\n5. GUARD MODESTY.--To be brazen is to imperil some of the best elements of\r\ncharacter. Modesty may be strengthened into a becoming confidence, but\r\nbrazen facedness can seldom be toned down into decency. It requires the\r\nmiracle of grace.\r\n\r\n6. PROTECT PURITY.--Teach your children to loathe impurity. Study the\r\ncharacter of their playmates. Watch their books. Keep them from corruption\r\nat all cost. The groups of youth in the school and in society, and in\r\nbusiness places, seed with improprieties of word and thought. Never relax\r\nyour vigilance along this exposed border.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTH PUZZLED.]\r\n\r\n7. THREATEN THE LEAST POSSIBLE.--In family government threaten the least\r\npossible. Some parents rattle off their commands with penalties so\r\nprofusely that there is a steady {78} roar of hostilities about the child's\r\nhead. These threats are forgotten by the parent and unheeded by the child.\r\nAll government is at an end.\r\n\r\n8. DO NOT ENFORCE TOO MANY COMMANDS.--Leave a few things within the range\r\nof the child's knowledge that are not forbidden. Keep your word good, but\r\ndo not have too much of it out to be redeemed.\r\n\r\n9. PUNISH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.--Sometimes punishment is necessary, but\r\nthe less it is resorted to the better.\r\n\r\n10. NEVER PUNISH IN A PASSION.--Wrath only becomes cruelty. There is no\r\nmoral power in it. When you seem to be angry you can do no good.\r\n\r\n11. BRUTISH VIOLENCE ONLY MULTIPLIES OFFENDERS.--Striking and beating the\r\nbody seldom reaches the soul. Fear and hatred beget rebellion.\r\n\r\n12. PUNISH PRIVATELY.--Avoid punishments that break down self-respect.\r\nStriking the body produces shame and indignation. It is enough for the\r\nother children to know that discipline is being administered.\r\n\r\n13. NEVER STOP SHORT OF SUCCESS.--When the child is not conquered the\r\npunishment has been worse than wasted. Reach the point where neither wrath\r\nnor sullenness remain. By firm persistency and persuasion require an open\r\nlook of recognition and peace. It is only evil to stir up the devil unless\r\nhe is cast out. Ordinarily one complete victory will last a child for a\r\nlifetime. But if the child relapses, repeat the dose with proper\r\naccompaniments.\r\n\r\n14. DO NOT REQUIRE CHILDREN TO COMPLAIN OF THEMSELVES FOR PARDON.--It\r\nbegets either sycophants or liars. It is the part of the government to\r\ndetect offences. It reverses the order of matters to shirk this duty.\r\n\r\n15. GRADE AUTHORITY UP TO LIBERTY.--The growing child must have experiments\r\nof freedom. Lead him gently into the family. Counsel with him. Let him plan\r\nas he can. By and by he has the confidence of courage without the danger of\r\nexposures.\r\n\r\n16. RESPECT.--Parents must respect each other. Undermining either\r\nundermines both. Always govern in the spirit of love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{79}\r\n\r\nCONVERSATION.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    Some men are very entertaining for a first interview, but after that\r\n    they are exhausted, and run out; on a second meeting we shall find them\r\n    very flat and monotonous; like hand-organs, we have heard all their\r\n    tunes.--COULTON.\r\n\r\n    He who sedulously attends, pointedly asks, calmly speaks, coolly\r\n    answers, and ceases when he has no more to say, is in possession of\r\n    some of the best requisites of man.--LAVATER.\r\n\r\n    Beauty is never so lovely as when adorned with the smile, and\r\n    conversation never sits easier upon us than when we know and then\r\n    discharge ourselves in a symphony of Laughter, which may not improperly\r\n    be called the Chorus of Conversation.--STEELE.\r\n\r\n    The first ingredient in Conversation is Truth, the next Good Sense, the\r\n    third Good Humor, and the fourth Wit.--SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n{80}\r\n\r\nHome Lessons in Conversation.\r\n\r\nSay nothing unpleasant when it can be avoided.\r\n\r\nAvoid satire and sarcasm.\r\n\r\nNever repeat a word that was not intended for repetition.\r\n\r\nCultivate the supreme wisdom, which consists less in saying what ought to\r\nbe said than in not saying what ought not to be said.\r\n\r\nOften cultivate \"flashes of silence.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the larger half of the conversation to listen well.\r\n\r\nListen to others patiently, especially the poor.\r\n\r\nSharp sayings are an evidence of low breeding.\r\n\r\nShun faultfindings and faultfinders.\r\n\r\nNever utter an uncomplimentary word against anyone.\r\n\r\nCompliments delicately hinted and sincerely intended are a grace in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nCommendation of gifts and cleverness properly put are in good taste, but\r\npraise of beauty is offensive.\r\n\r\nRepeating kind expressions is proper.\r\n\r\nCompliments given in a joke may be gratefully received in earnest.\r\n\r\nThe manner and tone are important parts of a compliment.\r\n\r\nAvoid egotism.\r\n\r\nDon't talk of yourself, or of your friends or your deeds.\r\n\r\nGive no sign that you appreciate your own merits.\r\n\r\nDo not become a distributer of the small talk of a community.

The commonest matter gently stated is better than an\r\nembarrassing silence. Sometimes changing your position, or looking into a\r\nbook for a moment may relieve your embarrassment, and dispel any settling\r\nstiffness.\r\n\r\nAvoid telling many stories, or repeating a story more than once in the same\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nNever treat any one as if you simply wanted him to tell stories. People\r\nlaugh and despise such a one.\r\n\r\nNever tell a coarse story. No wit or preface can make it excusable.\r\n\r\nTell a story, if at all, only as an illustration, and not for itself. Tell\r\nit accurately.\r\n\r\nBe careful in asking questions for the purpose of starting conversation or\r\ndrawing out a person, not to be rude or intrusive.\r\n\r\nNever take liberties by staring, or by any rudeness.\r\n\r\nNever infringe upon any established regulations among strangers.\r\n\r\nDo not always prove yourself to be the one in the right. The right will\r\nappear. You need only give it a chance.\r\n\r\nAvoid argument in conversation. It is discourteous to your host.\r\n\r\nCultivate paradoxes in conversation with your peers. They add interest to\r\ncommon-place matters. To strike the harmless faith of ordinary people in\r\nany public idol is waste, but such a movement with those able to reply is\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nNever discourse upon your ailments.\r\n\r\nNever use words of the meaning or pronunciation of which you are uncertain.\r\n\r\nAvoid discussing your own or other people's domestic concerns.\r\n\r\nNever prompt a slow speaker, as if you had all the ability.

Find something to truthfully praise and commend; thus make\r\nyourself agreeable.\r\n\r\nDo not make a pretense of gentility, nor parade the fact that you are a\r\ndescendant of any notable family. You must pass for just what you are, and\r\nmust stand on your own merit.\r\n\r\nDo not contradict. In making a correction say, \"I beg your pardon, but I\r\nhad the impression that it was so and so.\" Be careful in contradicting, as\r\nyou may be wrong yourself.\r\n\r\nDo not be unduly familiar; you will merit contempt if you are. Neither\r\nshould you be dogmatic in your assertions, arrogating to yourself such\r\nconsequences in your opinions.\r\n\r\nDo not be too lavish in your praise of various members of your own family\r\nwhen speaking to strangers; the person to whom you are speaking may know\r\nsome faults that you do not.\r\n\r\nDo not feel it incumbent upon yourself to carry your point in conversation.\r\nShould the person with whom you are conversing feel the same, your talk may\r\nlead into violent argument.\r\n\r\nDo not try to pry into the private affairs of others by asking what their\r\nprofits are, what things cost, whether Melissa ever had a beau, and why\r\nAmarette never got married? All such questions are extremely impertinent\r\nand are likely to meet with rebuke.\r\n\r\nDo not whisper in company; do not engage in private conversation; do not\r\nspeak a foreign language which the general company present may not\r\nunderstand, unless it is understood that the foreigner is unable to speak\r\nyour own language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{84}\r\n\r\nTHE TOILET\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nThe Care of the Person.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT RULES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Widower Jones and Widow Smith.]\r\n\r\n1. GOOD APPEARANCE.--The first care of all persons should be for their\r\npersonal appearance. Those who are slovenly or careless in their habits are\r\nunfit for refined society, and cannot possibly make a good appearance in\r\nit. A well-bred person will always cultivate habits of the most scrupulous\r\nneatness. A gentleman or lady is always well dressed. The garment may be\r\nplain or of coarse material, or even worn \"thin and shiny,\" but if it is\r\ncarefully brushed and neat it can be worn with dignity. {85}\r\n\r\n2. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS.--Personal appearance depends greatly on the\r\ncareful toilet and scrupulous attention to dress. The first point which\r\nmarks the gentleman or lady in appearance is rigid cleanliness. This remark\r\nsupplies to the body and everything which covers it. A clean skin--only to\r\nbe secured by frequent baths--is indispensable.\r\n\r\n3. THE TEETH.--The teeth should receive the utmost attention. Many a young\r\nman has been disgusted with a lady by seeing her unclean and discolored\r\nteeth. It takes but a few moments, and if necessary secure some simple\r\ntooth powder or rub the teeth thoroughly every day with a linen\r\nhandkerchief, and it will give the teeth and mouth a beautiful and clean\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n4. THE HAIR AND BEARD.--The hair should be thoroughly brushed and well\r\nkept, and the beard of men properly trimmed. Men should not let their hair\r\ngrow long and shaggy.\r\n\r\n5. UNDERCLOTHING.--The matter of cleanliness extends to all articles of\r\nclothing, underwear as well as the outer clothing. Cleanliness is a mark of\r\ntrue utility. The clothes need not necessarily be of a rich and expensive\r\nquality, but they can all be kept clean. Some persons have an odor about\r\nthem that is very offensive, simply on account of their underclothing being\r\nworn too long without washing. This odor of course cannot be detected by\r\nthe person who wears the soiled garments, but other persons easily detect\r\nit and are offended by it.\r\n\r\n6. THE BATH.--No person should think for a moment that they can be popular\r\nin society without regular bathing. A bath should be taken at least once a\r\nweek, and if the feet perspire they should be washed several times a week,\r\nas the case may require. It is not unfrequent that young men are seen with\r\ndirty ears and neck. This is unpardonable and boorish, and shows gross\r\nneglect. Occasionally a young lady will be called upon unexpectedly when\r\nher neck and smiling face are not emblems of cleanliness. Every lady owes\r\nit to herself to be fascinating; every gentleman is bound, for his own\r\nsake, to be presentable; but beyond this there is the obligation to\r\nsociety, to one's friends, and to those with whom we may be brought in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n7. SOILED GARMENTS.--A young man's garments may not be expensive, yet there\r\nis no excuse for wearing a soiled collar and a soiled shirt, or carrying a\r\nsoiled handkerchief. No one should appear as though he had slept in a\r\nstable, shaggy hair, soiled clothing or garments indifferently put on and\r\ncarelessly buttoned. A young man's vest should always be kept buttoned in\r\nthe presence of ladies. {86}\r\n\r\n8. THE BREATH.--Care should be taken to remedy an offensive breath without\r\ndelay. Nothing renders one so unpleasant to one's acquaintance, or is such\r\na source of misery to one's self. The evil may be from some derangement of\r\nthe stomach or some defective condition of the teeth, or catarrhal\r\naffection of the throat and nose. See remedies in other portions of the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA YOUNG MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\n    Dress changes the manners.--VOLTAIRE.\r\n\r\n    Whose garments wither, shall receive faded smiles.--SHERIDAN KNOWLES.\r\n\r\n    Men of sense follow fashion so far that they are neither conspicuous\r\n    for their excess nor peculiar by their opposition to it.--ANONYMOUS.\r\n\r\n1. A well-dressed man does not require so much an extensive as a varied\r\nwardrobe. He does not need a different suit for every season and every\r\noccasion, but if he is careful to select clothes that are simple and not\r\nstriking or conspicuous, he may use the garment over and over again without\r\ntheir being noticed, provided they are suitable to the season and the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n2. A clean shirt, collar and cuffs always make a young man look neat and\r\ntidy, even if his clothes are not of the latest pattern and are somewhat\r\nthreadbare.\r\n\r\n3. Propriety is outraged when a man of sixty dresses like a youth of\r\nsixteen. It is bad manners for a gentleman to use perfumes to a noticeable\r\nextent. Avoid affecting singularity in dress. Expensive clothes are no sign\r\nof a gentleman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dude of the 17th Century.]\r\n\r\n4. When dressed for company, strive to appear easy and natural. Nothing is\r\nmore distressing to a sensitive person, or more ridiculous to one gifted\r\nwith refinement, than to see a lady laboring under the consciousness of a\r\nfine gown; or a gentleman who is stiff, awkward and ungainly in a brand-new\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid what is called the \"ruffianly style of dress\" or the slouchy\r\nappearance of a half-unbottoned vest, and suspenderless pantaloons. That\r\nsort of affectation is, if possible, even more disgusting than the\r\npainfully elaborate frippery of the dandy or dude. Keep your clothes well\r\nbrushed and keep them cleaned. Slight spots can be removed with a little\r\nsponge and soap and water.\r\n\r\n6. A gentleman should never wear a high hat unless he has on a frock coat\r\nor a dress suit.\r\n\r\n7. A man's jewelry should be good and simple. Brass or false jewelry, like\r\nother forms of falsehood, is vulgar. Wearing many cheap decorations is a\r\nserious fault. {87}\r\n\r\n8. If a man wears a ring it should be on the third finger of the left hand.\r\nThis is the only piece of jewelry a man is allowed to wear that does not\r\nserve a purpose.\r\n\r\n9. Wearing imitations of diamonds is always in very bad taste.\r\n\r\n10. Every man looks better in a full beard it he keeps it well trimmed. If\r\na man shaves he should shave at least every other day, unless he is in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n11. The finger-nails should be kept cut, and the teeth should be cleaned\r\nevery morning, and kept clear from tartar. A man who does not keep his\r\nteeth clean does not look like a gentleman when he shows them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{88}\r\n\r\nDress.\r\n\r\n  We sacrifice to dress, till household joys\r\n  And comforts cease. Dress drains our cellar dry,\r\n  And keeps our larder lean. Puts out our fires,\r\n  And introduces hunger, frost and woe,\r\n  Where peace and hospitality might reign.--COWPER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. GOD IS A LOVER OF DRESS.--We cannot but feel that God is a lover of\r\ndress. He has put on robes of beauty and glory upon all his works. Every\r\nflower is dressed in richness; every field blushes beneath a mantle of\r\nbeauty; every star is veiled in brightness; every bird is clothed in the\r\n{89} habiliments of the most exquisite taste. The cattle upon the thousand\r\nhills are dressed by the hand divine. Who, studying God in his works, can\r\ndoubt, that he will smile upon the evidence of correct taste manifested by\r\nhis children in clothing the forms he has made them?\r\n\r\n2. LOVE OF DRESS.--To love dress is not to be a slave of fashion; to love\r\ndress only is the test of such homage. To transact the business of charity\r\nin a silken dress, and to go in a carriage to the work, injures neither the\r\nwork nor the worker. The slave of fashion is one who assumes the livery of\r\na princess, and then omits the errand of the good human soul; dresses in\r\nelegance, and goes upon no good errand, and thinks and does nothing of\r\nvalue to mankind.\r\n\r\n3. BEAUTY IN DRESS.--Beauty in dress is a good thing, rail at it who may.\r\nBut it is a lower beauty, for which a higher beauty should not be\r\nsacrificed. They love dresses too much who give it their first thought,\r\ntheir best time, or all their money; who for it neglect the culture of\r\ntheir mind or heart, or the claims of others on their service; who care\r\nmore for their dress than their disposition; who are troubled more by an\r\nunfashionable bonnet than a neglected duty.\r\n\r\n4. SIMPLICITY OF DRESS.--Female lovliness never appears to so good\r\nadvantage as when set off by simplicity of dress. No artist ever decks his\r\nangels with towering feathers and gaudy jewelry; and our dear human\r\nangels--if they would make good their title to that name--should carefully\r\navoid ornaments, which properly belong to Indian squaws and African\r\nprincesses. These tinselries may serve to give effect on the stage, or upon\r\nthe ball room floor, but in daily life there is no substitute for the charm\r\nof simplicity. A vulgar taste is not to be disguised by gold or diamonds.\r\nThe absence of a true taste and refinement of delicacy cannot be\r\ncompensated for by the possession of the most princely fortune. Mind\r\nmeasures gold, but gold cannot measure mind. Through dress the mind may be\r\nread, as through the delicate tissue the lettered page. A modest woman will\r\ndress modestly; a really refined and intelligent woman will bear the marks\r\nof careful selection and faultless taste.\r\n\r\n5. PEOPLE OF SENSE.--A coat that has the mark of use upon it, is a\r\nrecommendation to the people of sense, and a hat with too much nap, and too\r\nhigh lustre, a derogatory circumstance. The best coats in our streets are\r\nworn on the backs of penniless fops, broken down merchants, clerks with\r\npitiful salaries, and men that do not pay up. The heaviest gold chains\r\ndangle from the fobs of gamblers and gentlemen of very limited means;\r\ncostly ornaments on {90} ladies, indicate to the eyes that are well opened,\r\nthe fact of a silly lover or husband cramped for funds.\r\n\r\n6. PLAIN AND NEAT.--When a pretty woman goes by in plain and neat apparel,\r\nit is the presumption that she has fair expectations, and a husband that\r\ncan show a balance in his favor. For women are like books,--too much\r\ngilding makes men suspicious, that the binding is the most important part.\r\nThe body is the shell of the soul, and the dress is the husk of the body;\r\nbut the husk generally tells what the kernel is. As a fashionably dressed\r\nyoung lady passed some gentlemen, one of them raised his hat, whereupon\r\nanother, struck by the fine appearance of the lady, made some inquiries\r\nconcerning her, and was answered thus: \"She makes a pretty ornament in her\r\nfather's house, but otherwise is of no use.\"\r\n\r\n7. THE RICHEST DRESS.--The richest dress is always worn on the soul. The\r\nadornments that will not perish, and that all men most admire, shine from\r\nthe heart through this life. God has made it our highest, holiest duty, to\r\ndress the soul he has given us. It is wicked to waste it in frivolity. It\r\nis a beautiful, undying, precious thing. If every young woman would think\r\nof her soul when she looks in the glass, would hear the cry of her naked\r\nmind when she dallies away her precious hours at her toilet, would listen\r\nto the sad moaning of her hollow heart, as it wails through her idle,\r\nuseless life, something would be done for the elevation of womanhood.\r\n\r\n8. DRESSING UP.--Compare a well-dressed body with a well-dressed mind.\r\nCompare a taste for dress with a taste for knowledge, culture, virtue, and\r\npiety. Dress up an ignorant young woman in the \"height of fashion\"; put on\r\nplumes and flowers, diamonds and gewgaws; paint her face, girt up her\r\nwaist, and I ask you, if this side of a painted and feathered savage you\r\ncan find anything more unpleasant to behold. And yet such young women we\r\nmeet by the hundred every day on the street and in all our public places.\r\nIt is awful to think of.\r\n\r\n9. DRESS AFFECTS OUR MANNERS.--A man who is badly dressed, feels chilly,\r\nsweaty, and prickly. He stammers, and does not always tell the truth. He\r\nmeans to, perhaps, but he can't. He is half distracted about his\r\npantaloons, which are much to short, and are constantly hitching up; or his\r\nfrayed jacket and crumpled linen harrow his soul, and quite unman him. He\r\ntreads on the train of a lady's dress, and says, \"Thank you\", sits down on\r\nhis hat, and wishes the \"desert were his dwelling place.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\nBeauty.\r\n\r\n \"She walks in beauty, like the night\r\n    Of cloudless climes and starry skies:\r\n  And all that's best of dark and bright\r\n    Meet her in aspect and in her eyes;\r\n  Thus mellowed to that tender light\r\n    Which heaven to gaudy day denies.\"--BYRON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. THE HIGHEST STYLE OF BEAUTY.--The highest style of beauty to be found in\r\nnature pertains to the human form, as animated and lighted up by the\r\nintelligence within. It is the expression of the soul that constitutes this\r\nsuperior beauty. It is that which looks out of the eye, which sits in calm\r\nmajesty on the brow, lurks on the lip, smiles on the cheek, is set forth in\r\nthe chiselled lines and features of the countenance, in the general contour\r\nof figure and form, in the movement, and gesture, and tone; it is this\r\nlooking out of the invisible spirit that dwells within, this manifestation\r\nof the higher nature, that we admire and love; this constitutes to us the\r\nbeauty of our species. {92}\r\n\r\n2. BEAUTY WHICH PERISHES NOT.--There is a beauty which perishes not. It is\r\nsuch as the angels wear. It forms the washed white robes of the saints. It\r\nwreathes the countenance of every doer of good. It adorns every honest\r\nface. It shines in the virtuous life. It molds the hands of charity. It\r\nsweetens the voice of sympathy. It sparkles on the brow of wisdom. It\r\nflashes in the eye of love. It breathes in the spirit of piety. It is the\r\nbeauty of the heaven of heavens. It is that which may grow by the hand of\r\nculture in every human soul. It is the flower of the spirit which blossoms\r\non the tree of life. Every soul may plant and nurture it in its own garden,\r\nin its own Eden.\r\n\r\n3. WE MAY ALL BE BEAUTIFUL.--This is the capacity of beauty that God has\r\ngiven to the human soul, and this the beauty placed within the reach of\r\nall. We may all be beautiful. Though our forms may be uncomely and our\r\nfeatures not the prettiest, our spirits may be beautiful. And this inward\r\nbeauty always shines through. A beautiful heart will flash out in the eye.\r\nA lovely soul will glow in the face. A sweet spirit will tune the voice,\r\nwreathe the countenance in charms. Oh, there is a power in interior beauty\r\nthat melts the hardest heart!\r\n\r\n4. WOMAN THE MOST PERFECT TYPE OF BEAUTY.--Woman, by common consent, we\r\nregard as the most perfect type of beauty on earth. To her we ascribe the\r\nhighest charms belonging to this wonderful element so profusely mingled in\r\nall God's works. Her form is molded and finished in exquisite delicacy of\r\nperfection. The earth gives us no form more perfect, no features more\r\nsymmetrical, no style more chaste, no movements more graceful, no finish\r\nmore complete; so that our artists ever have and ever will regard the\r\nwoman-form of humanity as the most perfect earthly type of beauty. This\r\nform is most perfect and symmetrical in the youth of womanhood; so that the\r\nyouthful woman is earth's queen of beauty. This is true, not only by the\r\ncommon consent of mankind, but also by the strictest rules of scientific\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A REJECTED LOVER.]\r\n\r\n5. FADELESS BEAUTY.--There cannot be a picture without its bright spots;\r\nand the steady contemplation of what is bright in others, has a reflex\r\ninfluence upon the beholder. It reproduces what it reflects. Nay, it seems\r\nto leave an impress even upon the countenance. The feature, from having a\r\ndark, sinister aspect, becomes open, serene, and sunny. A countenance so\r\nimpressed, has neither the vacant stare of the idiot, nor the crafty,\r\npenetrating look of the basilisk, but the clear, placid aspect of truth and\r\ngoodness. The woman {94} who has such a face is beautiful. She has a beauty\r\nwhich changes not with the features, which fades not with years. It is\r\nbeauty of expression. It is the only kind of beauty which can be relied\r\nupon for a permanent influence with the other sex. The violet will soon\r\ncease to smile. Flowers must fade. The love that has nothing but beauty to\r\nsustain it, soon withers away.\r\n\r\n6. A PRETTY WOMAN PLEASES THE EYE, a good woman, the heart. The one is a\r\njewel, the other a treasure. Invincible fidelity, good humor, and\r\ncomplacency of temper, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the\r\ndecay of it invisible. That is true beauty which has not only a substance,\r\nbut a spirit; a beauty that we must intimately know to justly appreciate.\r\n\r\n7. THE WOMAN YOU LOVE BEST.--Beauty, dear reader, is probably the woman you\r\nlove best, but we trust it is the beauty of soul and character, which sits\r\nin calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip, and will outlive what is\r\ncalled a fine face.\r\n\r\n8. THE WEARING OF ORNAMENTS.--Beauty needs not the foreign aid of ornament,\r\nbut is when unadorned adorned the most, is a trite observation; but with a\r\nlittle qualification it is worthy of general acceptance. Aside from the\r\ndress itself, ornaments should be very sparingly used--at any rate, the\r\ndanger lies in over-loading oneself, and not in using too few. A young\r\ngirl, and especially one of a light and airy style of beauty, should never\r\nwear gems. A simple flower in her hair or on her bosom is all that good\r\ntaste will permit. When jewels or other ornaments are worn, they should be\r\nplaced where you desire the eye of the spectator to rest, leaving the parts\r\nto which you do not want attention called as plain and negative as\r\npossible. There is no surer sign of vulgarity than a profusion of heavy\r\njewelry carried about upon the person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{95}\r\n\r\nSensible Helps to Beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. FOR SCRAWNY NECK.--Take off your tight collars, feather boas and such\r\nheating things. Wash neck and chest with hot water, then rub in sweet oil\r\nall that you can work in. Apply this every night before you retire and\r\nleave the skin damp with it while you sleep.\r\n\r\n2. FOR RED HANDS.--Keep your feet warm by soaking them often in hot water,\r\nand keep your hands out of the water as much as possible. Rub your hands\r\nwith the skin of a lemon and it will whiten them. If your skin will bear\r\nglycerine after you have washed, pour into the palm a little glycerine and\r\nlemon juice mixed, and rub over the hands and wipe off.\r\n\r\n3. NECK AND FACE.--Do not bathe the neck and face just before or after\r\nbeing out of doors. It tends to wrinkle the skin.\r\n\r\n4. SCOWLS.--Never allow yourself to scowl, even if the sun be in your eyes.\r\nThat scowl will soon leave its trace and no beauty will outlive it. {96}\r\n\r\n5. WRINKLED FOREHEAD.--If you wrinkle your forehead when you talk or read,\r\nvisit an oculist and have your eyes tested, and then wear glasses to fit\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n6. OLD LOOKS.--Sometimes your face looks old because it is tired. Then\r\napply the following wash and it will make you look younger: Put three drops\r\nof ammonia, a little borax, a tablespoonful of bay rum, and a few drops of\r\ncamphor into warm water and apply to your face. Avoid getting it into your\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n7. THE BEST COSMETIC.--Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a pint of sweet\r\nmilk. Wash the face with it every night and in the morning wash off with\r\nwarm rain water. This will produce a very beautiful effect upon the skin.\r\n\r\n8. SPOTS ON THE FACE.--Moles and many other discolorations may be removed\r\nfrom the face by a preparation composed of one part chemically pure\r\ncarbolic acid and two parts pure glycerine. Touch the spots with a\r\ncamel's-hair pencil, being careful that the preparation does not come in\r\ncontact with the adjacent skin. Five minutes after touching, bathe with\r\nsoft water and apply a little vaseline. It may be necessary to repeat the\r\noperation, but if persisted in, the blemishes will be entirely removed.\r\n\r\n9. WRINKLES.--This prescription is said to cure wrinkles: Take one ounce of\r\nwhite wax and melt it to a gentle heat. Add two ounces of the juice of lily\r\nbulbs, two ounces of honey, two drams of rose water, and a drop or two of\r\nottar of roses. Apply twice a day, rubbing the wrinkles the wrong way.\r\nAlways use tepid water for washing the face.\r\n\r\n10. THE HAIR.--The hair must be kept free from dust or it will fall out.\r\nOne of the best things for cleaning it, is a raw egg rubbed into the roots\r\nand then washed out in several waters. The egg furnishes material for the\r\nhair to grow on, while keeping the scalp perfectly clean. Apply once a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n11. LOSS OF HAIR.--When through sickness or headache the hair falls out,\r\nthe following tonic may be applied with good effect: Use one ounce of\r\nglycerine, one ounce of bay rum, one pint of strong sage tea, and apply\r\nevery other night, rubbing well into the scalp.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{97}\r\n\r\nHow to Keep the Bloom and Grace of Youth.\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF ITS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. WM. MCKINLEY.]\r\n\r\n1. The question most often asked by women is regarding the art of\r\nretaining, with advancing years, the bloom and grace of youth. This secret\r\nis not learned through the analysis of chemical compounds, but by a\r\nthorough study of nature's laws peculiar to their sex. It is useless for\r\nwomen with wrinkled faces, dimmed eyes and blemished skins to seek for\r\nexternal applications of beautifying balms and lotions to bring the glow of\r\nlife and health into the face, and yet there are truths, simple yet\r\nwonderful, whereby the bloom of early life can be restored and retained, as\r\nshould be the heritage of all God's children, sending the light of beauty\r\ninto every woman's face. The secret:\r\n\r\n2. Do not bathe in hard water; soften it with a few drops of ammonia, or a\r\nlittle borax.\r\n\r\n3. Do not bathe the face while it is very warm, and never use very cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n4. Do not attempt to remove dust with cold water; give your face a hot\r\nbath, using plenty of good soap, then give it a thorough rinsing with warm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n5. Do not rub your face with a coarse towel.\r\n\r\n6. Do not believe you can remove wrinkles by filling in the crevices with\r\npowder. Give your face a Russian bath every night; that is, bathe it with\r\nwater so hot that you wonder how you can bear it, and then, a minute after,\r\nwith moderately cold water, that will make your face glow with warmth; dry\r\nit with a soft towel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       * {98}\r\n\r\n\r\nForm and Deformity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALE. FEMALE.\r\nShowing the Difference in Form and Proportion.]\r\n\r\n1. PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES.--Masquerading is a modern accomplishment. Girls\r\nwear tight shoes, burdensome skirts, corsets, etc., all of which prove so\r\nfatal to their health. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, our \"young\r\nladies\" are sorry specimens of feminality; and palpitators, cosmetics and\r\nall the modern paraphernalia are required to make them appear fresh and\r\nblooming. Man is equally at fault. A devotee to all the absurd devices of\r\nfashion, he practically asserts that \"dress makes the man.\" But physical\r\ndeformities are of far less importance than moral imperfections.\r\n\r\n2. DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL.--It is not possible for human beings to\r\nattain their full stature of humanity, except by loving long and perfectly.\r\nBehold that venerable man! he is mature in judgment, perfect in every\r\naction and expression, and saintly in goodness. You almost worship as you\r\nbehold. What rendered him thus perfect? What {99} rounded off his natural\r\nasperities, and moulded up his virtues? Love, mainly. It permeated every\r\npore, and seasoned every fibre of his being, as could nothing else. Mark\r\nthat matronly woman. In the bosom of her family she is more than a queen\r\nand goddess combined. All her looks and actions express the outflowing of\r\nsome or all of the human virtues. To know her is to love her. She became\r\nthus perfect, not in a day or year, but by a long series of appropriate\r\nmeans. Then by what? Chiefly in and by love, which is specially adapted\r\nthus to develop this maturity.\r\n\r\n3. PHYSICAL STATURE.--Men and women generally increase in stature until the\r\ntwenty-fifth year, and it is safe to assume, that perfection of function is\r\nnot established until maturity of bodily development is completed. The\r\nphysical contour of these representations plainly exhibits the difference\r\nin structure, and also implies difference of function. Solidity and\r\nstrength are represented by the organization of the male, grace and beauty\r\nby that of the female. His broad shoulders represent physical power and the\r\nright of dominion, while her bosom is the symbol of love and nutrition.\r\n\r\nHOW TO DETERMINE A PERFECT HUMAN FIGURE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady's Dress in the days of Greece.]\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the perfect human figure are strictly mathematical. The\r\nwhole figure is six times the length of the foot. Whether the form be\r\nslender or plump, this rule holds good. Any deviation from it is a\r\ndeparture from the highest beauty of proportion. The Greeks made all their\r\nstatues according to this rule. The face, from the highest point of the\r\nforehead, where the hair begins, to the end of the chin, is one-tenth of\r\nthe whole stature. The hand, from the wrist to the end of the middle\r\nfinger, is the same. The chest is a fourth, and from the nipples to the top\r\nof the head is the same. From the top of the chest to the highest point of\r\nthe forehead is a seventh. If the length of the face, from the roots of the\r\nhair to the chin, be divided into three equal parts, the first division\r\ndetermines the point where the eyebrows meet, and the second the place of\r\nthe nostrils. The navel is the central point of the human body, and if a\r\nman should lie on his back with his arms and legs extended, the periphery\r\nof the circle which might be described around him, with the navel for its\r\ncenter, would touch the extremities of his hands and feet. The height from\r\nthe feet to the top of the head is the same as the {100} distance from the\r\nextremity of one hand to the extremity of the other when the arms are\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nThe Venus de Medici is considered the most perfect model of the female\r\nforms, and has been the admiration of the world for ages. Alexander Walker,\r\nafter minutely describing this celebrated statue, says: \"All these\r\nadmirable characteristics of the female form, the mere existence of which\r\nin woman must, one is temped to imagine, be, even to herself, a source of\r\nineffable pleasure, these constitute a being worthy, as the personification\r\nof beauty, of occupying the temples of Greece; present an object finer,\r\nalas, than Nature even seems capable of producing; and offer to all nations\r\nand ages a theme of admiration and delight.\" Well might Thomson say:\r\n\r\n  So stands the statue that enchants the world,\r\n  So, bending, tries to vail the matchless boast--\r\n  The mingled beauties of exulting Greece.\r\n\r\nWe beg our readers to observe the form of the waist (evidently innocent of\r\ncorsets and tight dresses) of this model woman, and also that of the Greek\r\nSlave in the accompanying outlines. These forms are such as unperverted\r\nnature and the highest art alike require. To compress the waist, and\r\nthereby change its form, pushing the ribs inward, displacing the vital\r\norgans, and preventing the due expansion of the lungs, is as destructive to\r\nbeauty as it is to health. {101}\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY, MYSTERY, BENEFITS AND INJURIES OF THE CORSET.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Corset in the 18th Century.]\r\n\r\n1. The origin of the corset is lost in remote antiquity. The figures of the\r\nearly Egyptian women show clearly an artificial shape of the waist produced\r\nby some style of corset. A similar style of dress must also have prevailed\r\namong the ancient Jewish maidens; for Isaiah, in calling upon the women to\r\nput away their personal adornments, says: \"Instead of a girdle there shall\r\nbe a rent, and instead of a stomacher (corset) a girdle of sackcloth.\"\r\n\r\n2. Homer also tells us of the cestus or girdle of Venus, which was borrowed\r\nby the haughty Juno with a view to increasing her personal attractions,\r\nthat Jupiter might be a more tractable and orderly husband.\r\n\r\n3. Coming down to the later times, we find the corset was used in France\r\nand England as early as the 12th century.\r\n\r\n4. The most extensive and extreme use of the corset occurred in the 16th\r\ncentury, during the reign of Catherine de Medici of France and Queen\r\nElizabeth of England. With Catherine de Medici a thirteen-inch waist\r\nmeasurement was considered the standard of fashion, while a thick waist was\r\nan abomination. No lady could consider her figure of proper shape unless\r\nshe could span her waist with her two hands. To produce this result a\r\nstrong rigid corset was worn night and day until the waist was laced down\r\nto the required size. Then over this corset was placed the steel apparatus\r\nshown in the illustration on next page. This corset-cover reached from the\r\nhip to the throat, and {102} produced a rigid figure over which the dress\r\nwould fit with perfect smoothness.\r\n\r\n5. During the 18th century corsets were largely made from a species of\r\nleather known as \"Bend,\" which was not unlike that used for shoe soles, and\r\nmeasured nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. One of the most popular\r\ncorsets of the time was the corset and stomacher shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steel Corset worn in Catherine's time.]\r\n\r\n6. About the time of the French Revolution a reaction set in against tight\r\nlacing, and for a time there was a return to the early classical Greek\r\ncostume. This style of dress prevailed, with various modifications, until\r\nabout 1810, when corsets and tight lacing again returned with threefold\r\nfury. Buchan, a prominent writer of this period, says that it was by no\r\nmeans uncommon to see \"a mother lay her daughter down upon the carpet, and,\r\nplacing her foot upon her back, break half a dozen laces in tightening her\r\nstays.\"\r\n\r\n7. It is reserved to our own time to demonstrate that corsets and tight\r\nlacing do not necessarily go hand in hand. Distortion and feebleness are\r\nnot beauty. A proper proportion should exist between the size of the waist\r\nand the breadth of the shoulders and hips, and if the waist is diminished\r\nbelow this proportion, it suggests disproportion and invalidism rather than\r\ngrace and beauty.\r\n\r\n8. The perfect corset is one which possesses just that degree of rigidity\r\nwhich will prevent it from wrinkling, but will at the same time allow\r\nfreedom in the bending and twisting of the body. Corsets boned with\r\nwhalebone, horn or steel are necessarily stiff, rigid and uncomfortable.\r\nAfter a few days' wear the bones or steels become bent and set in position,\r\nor, as more frequently happens, they break and cause injury or discomfort\r\nto the wearer.\r\n\r\n9. About seven years ago an article was discovered for the stiffening of\r\ncorsets, which has revolutionized the corset industry of the world. This\r\narticle is manufactured from {103} the natural fibers of the Mexican Ixtle\r\nplant, and is known as Coraline. It consists of straight, stiff fibers like\r\nbristles bound together into a cord by being wound with two strands of\r\nthread passing in opposite directions. This produces an elastic fiber\r\nintermediate in stiffness between twine and whalebone. It cannot break, but\r\nit possesses all the stiffness and flexibility necessary to hold the corset\r\nin shape and prevent its wrinkling.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the ladies of to-day upon the advantages they enjoy over\r\ntheir sisters of two centuries ago, in the forms and the graceful and easy\r\ncurves of the corsets now made as compared with those of former times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forms of Corsets in the time of Elizabeth of England.]\r\n\r\n{104}\r\n\r\nTIGHT-LACING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIAN CORSET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NATURAL WAIST.\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF LACING.]\r\n\r\nIt destroys natural beauty and creates an unpleasant and irritable temper.\r\nA tight-laced chest and a good disposition cannot go together. The human\r\nform has been molded by nature, the best shape is undoubtedly that which\r\nshe has given it. To endeavor to render it more elegant by artificial means\r\nis to change it; to make it much smaller below and much larger above is to\r\ndestroy its beauty; to keep it cased up in a kind of domestic cuirass is\r\nnot only to deform it, but to expose the internal parts to serious injury.\r\nUnder such compression as is commonly practiced by ladies, the {105}\r\ndevelopment of the bones, which are still tender, does not take place\r\nconformably to the intention of nature, because nutrition is necessarily\r\nstopped, and they consequently become twisted and deformed.\r\n\r\nThose who wear these appliances of tight-lacing often complain that they\r\ncannot sit upright without them--are sometimes, indeed, compelled to wear\r\nthem during all the twenty-four hours; a fact which proves to what extent\r\nsuch articles weaken the muscles of the trunk. The injury does not fall\r\nmerely on the internal structure of the body, but also on its beauty, and\r\non the temper and feelings with which that beauty is associated. Beauty is\r\nin reality but another name for expression of countenance, which is the\r\nindex of sound health, intelligence, good feelings and peace of mind. All\r\nare aware that uneasy feelings, existing habitually in the breast speedily\r\nexhibit their signature on the countenance, and that bitter thoughts or a\r\nbad temper spoil the human expression of its comeliness and grace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{107}\r\n\r\nThe Care of the Hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATURAL HAIR.]\r\n\r\n1. THE COLOR OF THE HAIR.--The color of the hair corresponds with that of\r\nthe skin--being dark or black, with a dark complexion, and red or yellow\r\nwith a fair skin. When a white skin is seen in conjunction with black hair,\r\nas among the women of Syria and Barbary, the apparent exception arises from\r\nprotection from the sun's rays, and opposite colors are often found among\r\npeople of one prevailing feature. Thus red-haired Jews are not uncommon,\r\nthough the nation in general have dark complexion and hair.\r\n\r\n2. THE IMPERISHABLE NATURE OF HAIR.--The imperishable nature of hair arises\r\nfrom the combination of salt and metals in its composition. In old tombs\r\nand on mummies it has been found in a perfect state, after a lapse of over\r\ntwo thousand years. There are many curious accounts proving the\r\nindestructibility of the human hair.\r\n\r\n3. TUBULAR.--In the human family the hairs are tubular, the tubes being\r\nintersected by partitions, resembling in some degree the cellular tissue of\r\nplants. Their hollowness prevents incumbrance from weight, while their\r\npower of resistance is increased by having their traverse sections rounded\r\nin form.\r\n\r\n4. CAUTIONS.--It is ascertained that a full head of hair, beard and\r\nwhiskers, are a prevention against colds and consumptions. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, it is found necessary to remove the hair from the head, in cases\r\nof fever or disease, to stay the inflammatory symptoms, and to relieve the\r\nbrain. The head should invariably be kept cool. Close night-caps are\r\nunhealthy, and smoking-caps and coverings for the head within doors are\r\nalike detrimental to the free growth of the hair, weakening it, and causing\r\nit to fall out.\r\n\r\nHOW TO BEAUTIFY AND PRESERVE THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n1. TO BEAUTIFY THE HAIR.--Keep the head clean, the pores of the skin open,\r\nand the whole circulatory system in a healthy condition, and you will have\r\nno need of bear's grease (alias hog's lard). Where there is a tendency in\r\nthe hair to fall off on account of the weakness or sluggishness of the\r\ncirculation, or an unhealthy state of the skin, cold water and friction\r\nwith a tolerably stiff brush are probably the best remedial agents.\r\n\r\n2. BARBER'S SHAMPOOS.--Are very beneficial if properly prepared. They\r\nshould not be made too strong. Avoid strong shampoos of any kind. Great\r\ncaution should be exercised in this matter. {108}\r\n\r\n3. CARE OF THE HAIR.--To keep the hair healthy, keep the head clean. Brush\r\nthe scalp well with a stiff brush, while dry. Then wash with castile soap,\r\nand rub into the roots, bay rum, brandy or camphor water. This done twice a\r\nmonth will prove beneficial. Brush the scalp thoroughly twice a week.\r\nDampen the hair with soft water at the toilet, and do not use oil.\r\n\r\n4. HAIR WASH.--Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce of camphor\r\npowder--these ingredients fine--and dissolve them in one quart of boiling\r\nwater. When cool, the solution will be ready for use. Dampen the hair\r\nfrequently. This wash is said not only to cleanse and beautify, but to\r\nstrengthen the hair, preserve the color and prevent baldness.\r\n\r\nANOTHER EXCELLENT WASH.--The best wash we know for cleansing and softening\r\nthe hair is an egg beaten up and rubbed well into the hair, and afterwards\r\nwashed out with several washes of warm water.\r\n\r\n5. THE ONLY SENSIBLE AND SAFE HAIR OIL.--The following is considered a most\r\nvaluable preparation: Take of extract of yellow Peruvian bark, fifteen\r\ngrains; extract of rhatany root, eight grains; extract of burdoch root and\r\noil of nutmegs (fixed), of each two drachms; camphor (dissolve with spirits\r\nof wine), fifteen grains; beef marrow, two ounces; best olive oil, one\r\nounce; citron juice, half a drachm; aromatic essential oil, as much as\r\nsufficient to render it fragrant; mix and make into an ointment. Two\r\ndrachms of bergamot, and a few drops of attar of roses would suffice.\r\n\r\n6. HAIR WASH.--A good hair wash is soap and water, and the oftener it is\r\napplied the freer the surface of the head will be from scurf. The\r\nhair-brush should also be kept in requisition morning and evening.\r\n\r\n7. TO REMOVE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.--With those who dislike the use of arsenic,\r\nthe following is used for removing superfluous hair from the skin: Lime,\r\none ounce; carbonate of potash, two ounces; charcoal powder, one drachm.\r\nFor use, make it into a paste with a little warm water, and apply it to the\r\npart, previously shaved close. As soon as it has become thoroughly dry, it\r\nmay be washed off with a little warm water.\r\n\r\n8. COLORING FOR EYELASHES AND EYEBROWS.--In eyelashes the chief element of\r\nbeauty consists in their being long and glossy; the eyebrows should be\r\nfinely arched and clearly divided from each other. The most innocent\r\ndarkener of the brow is the expressed juice of the elderberry, or a burnt\r\nclove. {109}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISCUSSING THE FASHIONS.]\r\n\r\n9. CRIMPING HAIR.--To make the hair stay in crimps, take five cents worth\r\nof gum arabic and add to it just enough boiling water to dissolve it. When\r\ndissolved, add enough alcohol to make it rather thin. Let this stand all\r\nnight and then bottle it to prevent the alcohol from evaporating. This put\r\non the hair at night, after it is done up in papers or pins, will make it\r\nstay in crimp the hottest day, and is perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n10. TO CURL THE HAIR.--There is no preparation that will make naturally\r\nstraight hair assume a permanent curl. The following will keep the hair in\r\ncurl for a short time: Take borax, two ounces; gum arabic, one drachm; and\r\nhot {110} water, not boiling, one quart; stir, and, as soon as the\r\ningredients are dissolved, add three tablespoonfuls of strong spirits of\r\ncamphor. On retiring to rest, wet the hair with the above liquid, and roll\r\nin twists of paper as usual. Do not disturb the hair until morning, when\r\nuntwist and form into ringlets.\r\n\r\n11. FOR FALLING OR LOOSENING OF THE HAIR.--Take:\r\n\r\n  Alcohol, a half pint.\r\n  Salt, as much as will dissolve.\r\n  Glycerine, a tablespoonful.\r\n  Flour of sulphur, teaspoonful. Mix.\r\n\r\nRub on the scalp every morning.\r\n\r\n12. TO DARKEN THE HAIR WITHOUT BAD EFFECTS.--Take:\r\n\r\n  Blue vitriol (powdered), one drachm.\r\n  Alcohol, one ounce.\r\n  Essence of roses, ten drops.\r\n  Rain-water, a half-pint.\r\n\r\nShake together until they are thoroughly dissolved.\r\n\r\n13. GRAY HAIR.--There are no known means by which the hair can be prevented\r\nfrom turning gray, and none which can restore it to its original hue,\r\nexcept through the process of dyeing. The numerous \"hair color restorers\"\r\nwhich are advertised are chemical preparations which act in the manner of a\r\ndye or as a paint, and are nearly always dependent for their power on the\r\npresence of lead. This mineral, applied to the skin, for a long time, will\r\nlead to the most disastrous maladies--lead-palsy, lead colic, and other\r\nsymptoms of poisoning. It should, therefore, never be used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{111}\r\n\r\nHow to Cure Pimples or Other Facial Eruptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. It requires self-denial to get rid of pimples, for persons troubled with\r\nthem will persist in eating fat meats and other articles of food calculated\r\nto produce them. Avoid the use of rich gravies, or pastry, or anything of\r\nthe kind in excess. Take all the out-door exercise yon can and never\r\nindulge in a late supper. Retire at a reasonable hour, and rise early in\r\nthe morning. Sulphur to purify the blood may be taken three times a week--a\r\nthimbleful in a glass of milk before breakfast. It takes some time for the\r\nsulphur to do its work, therefore persevere in its use till the humors, or\r\npimples, or blotches, disappear. Avoid getting wet while taking the\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\n2. TRY THIS RECIPE: Wash the face twice a day in warm water, and rub dry\r\nwith a coarse towel. Then with a soft towel rub in a lotion made of two\r\nounces of white brandy, one ounce of cologne, and one-half ounce of liquor\r\npotassa. {112} Persons subject to skin eruptions should avoid very salty or\r\nfat food. A dose of Epsom salts occasionally might prove beneficial.\r\n\r\n3. Wash the face in a dilution of carbolic acid, allowing one teaspoonful\r\nto a pint of water. This is an excellent and purifying lotion, and may be\r\nused on the most delicate skins. Be careful about letting this wash get\r\ninto the eyes.\r\n\r\n4. Oil of sweet almonds, one ounce; fluid potash, one drachm. Shake well\r\ntogether, and then add rose water, one ounce; pure water, six ounces. Mix.\r\nRub the pimples or blotches for some minutes with a rough towel, and then\r\ndab them with the lotion.\r\n\r\n5.

No specialized head is visible, although of course there\r\nis a mouth orifice. These creatures live on the sweat glands or pores of\r\nthe human face, and owing to the appearance that they give to the infested\r\npores, they are usually known as \"black-heads.\" It is not at all uncommon\r\nto see an otherwise pretty face disfigured by these ugly creatures,\r\nalthough the insects themselves are nearly transparent white. The black\r\nappearance is really due the accumulation of dirt which gets under the\r\nedges of the skin of the enlarged sweat glands and cannot be removed in the\r\nordinary way by washing, because the abnormal, hardened secretion of the\r\ngland itself becomes stained. These insects are so lowly organized that it\r\nis almost impossible to satisfactorily deal with them. {113} and they\r\nsometimes cause the continual festering of the skin which they inhabit.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--Press them out with a hollow key or with the thumb and fingers,\r\nand apply a mixture of sulphur and cream every evening.

LOVE BLENDS YOUNG HEARTS.--Love blends young hearts in blissful unity,\r\nand, for the time, so ignores past ties and affections, as to make willing\r\nseparation of the son from his father's house, and the daughter from all\r\nthe sweet endearments of her childhood's home, to go out together, and rear\r\nfor themselves an altar, around which shall cluster all the cares and\r\ndelights, the anxieties and sympathies, of the family relationship; this\r\nlove, if pure, unselfish, and discreet, constitutes the chief usefulness\r\nand happiness of human life.\r\n\r\n2. WITHOUT LOVE.--Without love there would be no organized households, and,\r\nconsequently, none of that earnest endeavor for competence and\r\nrespectability, which is the mainspring to human effort; none of those\r\nsweet, softening, restraining and elevating influences of domestic life,\r\nwhich can alone fill the earth with the glory of the Lord and make glad the\r\ncity of Zion. This love is indeed heaven upon earth; but above would not be\r\nheaven without it; where there is not love, there is fear; but, \"love\r\ncasteth out fear.\" And yet we naturally do offend what we most love.\r\n\r\n3. LOVE IS THE SUN OF LIFE.--Most beautiful in morning and evening, but\r\nwarmest and steadiest at noon. It is the sun of the soul. Life without love\r\nis worse than death; a world without a sun. The love which does not lead to\r\nlabor will soon die out, and the thankfulness which does not embody itself\r\nin sacrifices is already changing to gratitude. Love is not ripened in one\r\nday, nor in many, nor even in a human lifetime. It is the oneness of soul\r\nwith soul in appreciation and perfect trust. To be blessed it must rest in\r\nthat faith in the Divine which underlies every other motion. To be true, it\r\nmust be eternal as God himself.\r\n\r\n4. LOVE IS DEPENDENT.--Remember that love is dependent upon forms; courtesy\r\nof etiquette guards and protects courtesy of heart. How many hearts have\r\nbeen lost irrevocably, and how many averted eyes and cold looks have been\r\ngained from what seemed, perhaps, but a trifling negligence of forms?\r\n\r\n{116}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOVE MAKING IN THE EARLY COLONIAL DAYS.]\r\n\r\n5. RADICAL DIFFERENCES.--Men and women should not be judged by the same\r\nrules. There are many radical differences in their affectional natures. Man\r\nis the creature of interest and ambition. His nature leads him forth into\r\nthe struggle and bustle of the world. Love is but the embellishment of his\r\nearly life, or a song piped in the intervals of the acts. He seeks for\r\nfame, for fortune, for space in the world's thoughts, and dominion over his\r\nfellow-men. But a woman's whole life is a history of the affections. The\r\nheart is her world; it is there her ambition strives for empire; it is\r\nthere her ambition seeks for hidden treasures. She sends forth her\r\nsympathies on adventure; she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of\r\naffection; and if shipwrecked her case is hopeless, for it is bankruptcy of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n6. WOMAN'S LOVE.--Woman's love is stronger than death; it rises superior to\r\nadversity, and towers in sublime beauty above the niggardly selfishness of\r\nthe world. Misfortune cannot suppress it; enmity cannot alienate it;\r\ntemptation cannot enslave it. It is the guardian angel of the nursery and\r\nthe sick bed; it gives an affectionate concord to the partnership of life\r\nand interest, circumstances cannot modify it; it ever remains the same to\r\nsweeten existence, to purify the cup of life, on the rugged pathway to the\r\ngrave, and melt to moral pliability the brittle nature of man. It is the\r\nministering spirit of home, hovering in soothing caresses over the cradle,\r\nand the death-bed of the household, and filling up the urn of all its\r\nsacred memories.\r\n\r\n7. A LADY'S COMPLEXION.--He who loves a lady's complexion, form and\r\nfeatures, loves not her true self, but her soul's old clothes. The love\r\nthat has nothing but beauty to sustain it, soon withers and dies. The love\r\nthat is fed with presents always requires feeding. Love, and love only, is\r\nthe loan for love. Love is of the nature of a burning glass, which, kept\r\nstill in one place, fireth; changed often, it doth nothing. The purest joy\r\nwe can experience in one we love, is to see that person a source of\r\nhappiness to others. When you are with the person loved, you have no sense\r\nof being bored. This humble and trivial circumstance is the great test--the\r\nonly sure and abiding test of love.\r\n\r\n8. TWO SOULS COME TOGETHER.--When two souls come together, each seeking to\r\nmagnify the other, each in subordinate sense worshiping the other, each\r\nhelp the other; the two flying together so that each wing-beat of the one\r\nhelps each wing-beat of the other--when two souls come together thus, they\r\nare lovers. They who unitedly move themselves away from grossness and from\r\nearth, toward the throne of crystaline and the pavement golden, are,\r\nindeed, true lovers.\r\n\r\n{118}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUPID'S CAPTURED VICTIM.]\r\n\r\nThe Power and Peculiarities of Love.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOVE IS A TONIC AND A REMEDY FOR DISEASE, MAKES PEOPLE LOOK YOUNGER,\r\nCREATES INDUSTRY, ETC.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n \"All thoughts, all passions, all desires,\r\n    Whatever stirs this mortal frame,\r\n  Are ministers of Love,\r\n    And feed his sacred flame.\"\r\n\r\n1. It is a physological fact long demonstrated that persons possessing a\r\nloving disposition borrow less of the cares of life, and also live much\r\nlonger than persons with a strong, narrow and selfish nature. Persons who\r\nlove scenery, love domestic animals, show great attachment for all friends;\r\nlove their home dearly and find interest and enchantment in almost\r\neverything have qualities of mind and heart which indicate good health and\r\na happy disposition.\r\n\r\n2. Persons who love music and are constantly humming or whistling a tune,\r\nare persons that need not be feared, they are kind-hearted and with few\r\nexceptions possess a loving disposition. Very few good musicians become\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n3. Parents that cultivate a love among then children will find that the\r\nsame feeling will soon be manifested in their children's disposition.\r\nSunshine in the hearts of the parents will blossom in the lives of the\r\nchildren. The parent who continually cherishes a feeling of dislike and\r\nrebellion in his soul, cultivating moral hatred against his fellow-man,\r\nwill soon find the same things manifested by his son. As the son resembles\r\nhis father in looks so he will to a certain extent resemble him in\r\ncharacter. Love in the heart of the parent will beget kindness and\r\naffection in the heart of a child. Continuous scolding and fretting in the\r\nhome will soon make love a stranger. {119}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURKISH WAY OF MAKING LOVE]\r\n\r\n4. If you desire to cultivate love, create harmony in all your feelings and\r\nfaculties. Remember that all that is pure, holy and virtuous in love flows\r\nfrom the deepest fountain of the human soul. Poison the fountain and you\r\nchange virtue to vice, and happiness to misery.\r\n\r\n5. Love strengthens health, and disappointment cultivates disease. A person\r\nin love will invariably enjoy the best of health. Ninety-nine per cent. of\r\nour strong constitutioned men, now in physical ruin, have wrecked\r\nthemselves on the breakers of an unnatural love. Nothing but right love and\r\na right marriage will restore them to health.\r\n\r\n6. All men feel much better for going a courting, providing they court\r\npurely. Nothing tears the life out of man more than lust, vulgar thoughts\r\nand immoral conduct. The libertine or harlot has changed love, God's purest\r\ngift to man, into lust. They cannot acquire love in its purity again, the\r\nsacred flame has vanished forever. Love is pure, and cannot be found in the\r\nheart of a seducer.\r\n\r\n7. A woman is never so bright and full of health as when deeply in love.\r\nMany sickly and frail women are snatched from the clutches of some deadly\r\ndisease and restored to health by falling in love.\r\n\r\n8. It is a long established fact that married persons are healthier than\r\nunmarried persons; thus it proves that health and happiness belong to the\r\nhome. Health depends upon mind. Love places the mind into a delightful\r\nstate and quickens every human function, makes the blood circulate and\r\nweaves threads of joy into cables of domestic love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING TO ENTERTAIN HER LOVER.]\r\n\r\n9. An old but true proverb: \"A true man loving one woman will speak well of\r\nall women. A true woman loving one man will speak well of all men. A good\r\nwife praises all men, but praises her husband most. A good man praises all\r\nwomen, but praises his wife most.\"\r\n\r\n10. Persons deeply in love become peculiarly pleasant, winning and tender.\r\nIt is said that a musician can never excel or an artist do his best until\r\nhe has been deeply in love. A good orator, a great statesman or great men\r\nin general are greater and better for having once been thoroughly in love.\r\nA man who truly loves his wife and home is always a safe man to trust.\r\n\r\n11. Love makes people look younger in years. People in unhappy homes look\r\nolder and more worn and fatigued. A woman at thirty, well courted and well\r\nmarried, looks five or ten years younger than a woman of the same age\r\nunhappily married. Old maids and bachelors always look older {120} than\r\nthey are. A flirting widow always looks younger than an old maid of like\r\nage.\r\n\r\n12. Love renders women industrious and frugal, and a loving husband spends\r\nlavishly on a loved wife and children, though miserly towards others.\r\n\r\n13. Love cultivates self-respect and produces beauty. Beauty in walk and\r\nbeauty in looks; a girl in love is at her best; it brings out the finest\r\ntraits of her character, she walks more erect and is more generous and\r\nforgiving; her voice is sweeter and she makes happy all about her. She\r\nworks better, sings better and is better.\r\n\r\n14. Now in conclusion, a love marriage is the best life insurance policy;\r\nit pays dividends every day, while every other insurance policy merely\r\npromises to pay after death. Remember that statistics demonstrate that\r\nmarried people outlive old maids and old bachelors by a goodly number of\r\nyears and enjoy healthier and happier lives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{122}\r\n\r\nAmativeness or Connubial Love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFIDENCE.]\r\n\r\n1. MULTIPLYING THE RACE.--Some means for multiplying our race is necessary\r\nto prevent its extinction by death. Propagation and death appertain to\r\nman's earthly existence. If the Deity had seen fit to bring every member of\r\nthe human family into being by a direct act of creative power, without the\r\nagency of parents, the present wise and benevolent arrangements of husbands\r\nand wives, parents and children, friends and neighbors, would have been\r\nsuperseded, and all opportunities for exercising parental and connubial\r\nlove, in which so much enjoyment is taken, cut off. But the domestic\r\nfeelings and relations, as now arranged, must strike every philosophical\r\nobserver as inimitably beautiful and perfect--as the offspring of infinite\r\nWisdom and Goodness combined.\r\n\r\n2. AMATIVENESS AND ITS COMBINATIONS constitute their origin, counterpart,\r\nand main medium of manifestation. Its primary function is connubial love.\r\nFrom it, mainly, spring those feelings which exist between the sexes as\r\nsuch and {123} result in marriage and offspring. Combined with the higher\r\nsentiments, it gives rise to all those reciprocal kind feelings and\r\nnameless courtesies which each sex manifests towards the other; refining\r\nand elevating both, promoting gentility and politeness, and greatly\r\nincreasing social and general happiness.\r\n\r\n3. RENDERS MEN MORE POLITE TO WOMEN.--So far from being in the least gross\r\nor indelicate, its proper exercise is pure, chaste, virtuous, and even an\r\ningredient in good manners. It is this which renders men always more polite\r\ntowards women than to one another, and more refined in their society, and\r\nwhich makes women more kind, grateful, genteel and tender towards men than\r\nwomen. It makes mothers love their sons more than their daughters, and\r\nfathers more attached to their daughters. Man's endearing recollections of\r\nhis mother or wife form his most powerful incentives to virtue, study, and\r\ngood deeds, as well as restraints upon his vicious inclinations; and, in\r\nproportion as a young man is dutiful and affectionate to his mother, will\r\nhe be fond of his wife; for, this faculty is the parent of both.\r\n\r\n4. ALL SHOULD CULTIVATE THE FACULTY OF AMATIVENESS OR CONNUBIAL\r\nLORE.--Study the personal charms and mental accomplishments of the other\r\nsex by ardent admirers of beautiful forms, and study graceful movements and\r\nelegant manners, and remember, much depends upon the tones and accents of\r\nthe voice. Never be gruff if you desire to be winning. Seek and enjoy and\r\nreciprocate fond looks and feelings. Before you can create favorable\r\nimpressions you must first be honest and sincere and natural, and your\r\nconquest will be sure and certain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLove and Common-Sense.\r\n\r\n1. Do you love her because she goes to the altar with her head full of book\r\nlearning, her hands of no earthly use, save for the piano and brush;\r\nbecause she has no conception of the duties and responsibilities of a wife;\r\nbecause she hates housework, hates its everlasting routine and ever\r\nrecurring duties; because she hates children and will adopt every means to\r\nevade motherhood; because she loves her ease, loves to have her will\r\nsupreme, loves, oh how well, to be free to go and come, to let the days\r\nslip idly by, to be absolved from all responsibility, to live without\r\nlabor, without care? Will you love her selfish, shirking, calculating\r\nnature after twenty years of close companionship?\r\n\r\n2. Do you love him because he is a man, and therefore, no matter how weak\r\nmentally, morally or physically he may {124} be, he has vested in him the\r\npower to save you from the ignominy of an old maid's existence? Because you\r\nwould rather be Mrs. Nobody, than make the effort to be Miss Somebody?\r\nbecause you have a great empty place in your head and heart that nothing\r\nbut a man can fill? because you feel you cannot live without him? God grant\r\nthe time may never come when you cannot live with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARNEST CALLER.]\r\n\r\n3. Do you love her because she is a thoroughly womanly woman; for her\r\ntender sympathetic nature; for the jewels of her life, which are absolute\r\npurity of mind and heart; for the sweet sincerity of her disposition; for\r\nher loving, charitable thought; for her strength of character? because she\r\nis pitiful to the sinful, tender to the sorrowful, capable, self-reliant,\r\nmodest, true-hearted? in brief, because she is the embodiment of all\r\nwomanly virtues?\r\n\r\n4. Do you love him because he is a manly man; because the living and\r\noperating principle of his life is a tender reverence for all women;\r\nbecause his love is the overflow of the best part of his nature; because he\r\nhas never soiled his soul with an unholy act or his lips with an oath;\r\nbecause mentally he is a man among men; because physically he stands head\r\nand shoulders above the masses; because morally he is far beyond suspicion,\r\nin his thought, word or deed; because his earnest manly consecrated life is\r\na mighty power on God's side?\r\n\r\n5. But there always has been and always will be unhappy marriages until men\r\nlearn what husbandhood means; how to care for that tenderly matured,\r\ndelicately constituted being, that he takes into his care and keeping. That\r\nif her wonderful adjusted organism is overtaxed and overburdened, her\r\nhappiness, which is largely dependent upon her health, is destroyed.\r\n\r\n6. Until men give the women they marry the undivided love of their heart;\r\nuntil constancy is the key-note of a life which speaks eloquently of clean\r\nthoughts and clean hearts.\r\n\r\n7. Until men and women recognize that self-control in a man, and modesty in\r\na woman, will bring a mutual respect that years of wedded life will only\r\nstrengthen. Until they recognize that love is the purest and holiest of all\r\nthings known to humanity, will marriage continue to bring unhappiness and\r\ndiscontent, instead of that comfort and restful peace which all loyal souls\r\nhave a right to expect and enjoy.\r\n\r\n8. Be sensible and marry a sensible, honest and industrious companion, and\r\nhappiness through life will be your reward.\r\n\r\n{126}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat Women Love in Men.\r\n\r\n1. Women naturally love courage, force and firmness in men. The ideal man\r\nin a woman's eye must be heroic and brave. Woman naturally despises a\r\ncoward, and she has little or no respect for a bashful man.\r\n\r\n2. Woman naturally loves her lord and master. Women who desperately object\r\nto be overruled, nevertheless admire men who overrule them, and few women\r\nwould have any respect for a man whom they could completely rule and\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n3. Man is naturally the protector of woman; as the male wild animal of the\r\nforest protects the female, so it is natural for man to protect his wife\r\nand children, and therefore woman admires those qualities in a man which\r\nmake him a protector.\r\n\r\n4. LARGE MEN.--Women naturally love men of strength, size and fine\r\nphysique, a tall, large and strong man rather than a short, small and weak\r\nman. A woman always pities a weakly man, but rarely ever has any love for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n5. SMALL AND WEAKLY MEN.--All men would be of good size in frame and flesh,\r\nwere it not for the infirmities visited upon them by the indiscretion of\r\nparents and ancestors of generations before.\r\n\r\n6. YOUTHFUL SEXUAL EXCITEMENT.--There are many children born healthy and\r\nvigorous who destroy the full vigor of their generative organs in youth by\r\nself-abuse, and if they survive and marry, their children will have small\r\nbones, small frames and sickly constitutions. It is therefore not strange\r\nthat instinct should lead women to admire men not touched with these\r\nsymptoms of physical debility.\r\n\r\n7. GENEROSITY.--Woman generally loves a generous man. Religion absorbs a\r\ngreat amount of money in temples, churches, ministerial salaries, etc., and\r\nambition and appetite absorb countless millions, yet woman receives more\r\ngifts from man than all these combined: she {127} loves a generous giver.\r\n_Generosity and Gallantry_ are the jewels which she most admires. A woman\r\nreceiving presents from a man implies that she will pay him back in love,\r\nand the woman who accepts a man's presents, and does not respect him,\r\ncommits a wrong which is rarely ever forgiven.\r\n\r\n8. INTELLIGENCE.--Above all other qualities in man, woman admires his\r\nintelligence. Intelligence is man's woman-captivating card. This character\r\nin woman is illustrated by an English army officer, as told by O. S.\r\nFowler, betrothed in marriage to a beautiful, loving heiress, summoned to\r\nIndia, who wrote back to her:\r\n\r\n\"I have lost an eye, a leg, an arm, and been so badly marred and begrimmed\r\nbesides, that you never could love this poor, maimed soldier. Yet, I love\r\nyou too well to make your life wretched by requiring you to keep your\r\nmarriage-vow with me, from which I hereby release you. Find among English\r\npeers one physically more perfect, whom you can love better.\"\r\n\r\nShe answered, as all genuine women must answer:\r\n\r\n\"Your noble mind, your splendid talents, your martial prowess which maimed\r\nyou, are what I love. As long as you retain sufficient body to contain the\r\ncasket of your soul, which alone is what I admire, I love you all the same,\r\nand long to make you mine forever.\"\r\n\r\n9. SOFT MEN.--All women despise soft and silly men more than all other\r\ndefects in their character. Woman never can love a man whose conversation\r\nis flat and insipid. Every man seeking woman's appreciation or love should\r\nalways endeavor to show his intelligence and manifest an interest in books\r\nand daily papers. He should read books and inform himself so that he can\r\ntalk intelligently upon the various topics of the day. Even an ignorant\r\nwoman always loves superior intelligence.\r\n\r\n10. SEXUAL VIGOR.--Women love sexual vigor in men. This is human nature.\r\nWeakly and delicate fathers have weak and puny children, though the mother\r\nmay be strong and robust. A weak mother often bears strong children, if the\r\nfather is physically and sexually vigorous. Consumption is often inherited\r\nfrom fathers, because they furnish the body, yet more women die with it\r\nbecause of female obstructions. Hence women love passion in men, because it\r\nendows their offspring with strong functional vigor.\r\n\r\n11. PASSIONATE MEN.--The less passion any woman possesses, the more she\r\nprizes a strong passionate man. This is a natural consequence, for if she\r\nmarried one equally {128} passionless, their children would be poorly\r\nendowed or they would have none; she therefore admires him who makes up the\r\ndeficiency. Hence very amorous men prefer quiet, modest and reserved women.\r\n\r\n12. HOMELY MEN are admired by women if they are large, strong and vigorous\r\nand possess a good degree of intelligence. Looks are trifles compared with\r\nthe other qualities which man may possess.\r\n\r\n13. YOUNG MAN, If you desire to win the love and admiration of young\r\nladies, first, be intelligent; read books and papers; remember what you\r\nread, so you can talk about it. Second, be generous and do not show a\r\nstingy and penurious disposition when in the company of ladies. Third, be\r\nsensible, original, and have opinions of your own and do not agree with\r\neverything that someone else says, or agree with everything that a lady may\r\nsay. Ladies naturally admire genteel and intelligent discussions and\r\nconversations when there is someone to talk with who has an opinion of his\r\nown. Woman despises a man who has no opinion of his own; she hates a\r\ntrifling disposition and admires leadership, original ideas, and looks up\r\nto man as a leader. Women despise all men whom they can manage, overrule,\r\ncow-down and subdue.\r\n\r\n14. BE SELF-SUPPORTING.--The young man who gives evidence of thrift is\r\nalways in demand. Be enthusiastic and drive with success all that you\r\nundertake. A young man, sober, honest and industrious, holding a\r\nresponsible position or having a business of his own, is a prize that some\r\nbright and beautiful young lady would like to draw. Woman admires a\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\n15. UNIFORMED MEN.--It is a well known fact that women love uniformed men.\r\nThe soldier figures as a hero in about every tale of fiction and it is said\r\nby good authority that a man in uniform has three more chances to marry\r\nthan the man without uniform. The correct reason is, the soldier's\r\nprofession is bravery, and he is dressed and trained for that purpose, and\r\nit is that which makes him admired by ladies rather than the uniform which\r\nhe wears. His profession is also that of a protector.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nKATE SHELLEY\r\nThe Heroine of Honey Creek, who July 6, 1881, crept across the\r\ntrembling bridge in the darkness of a terrific storm, and\r\nstopped the approaching Passenger Train.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat Men Love in Women.\r\n\r\n1. FEMALE BEAUTY.--Men love beautiful women, for woman's beauty is the\r\nhighest type of all beauty. A handsome woman needs no diamonds, no silks or\r\nsatins; her brilliant face outshines diamonds and her form is beautiful in\r\ncalico.\r\n\r\n2. FALSE BEAUTIFIERS.--Man's love of female beauty surpasses all other\r\nlove, and whatever artificial means are used to beautify, to a certain\r\nextent are falsehoods which lead to distrust or dislike. Artificial beauty\r\nis always an imitation, and never can come into competition with the\r\ngenuine. No art can successfully imitate nature.\r\n\r\n3. TRUE KIND OF BEAUTY.--Facial beauty is only skin-deep. A beautiful form,\r\na graceful figure, graceful movements and a kind heart are the strongest\r\ncharms in the perfection of female beauty. A brilliant face always\r\noutshines what may be called a pretty face, for intelligence is that\r\nqueenly grace which crowns woman's influence over men. Good looks and good\r\nand pure conduct awaken a man's love for women. A girl must therefore be\r\ncharming as well {130} as beautiful, for a charming girl will never become\r\na charmless wife.\r\n\r\n4. A GOOD FEMALE BODY.--No weakly, poor-bodied woman can draw a man's love\r\nlike a strong, well developed body. A round, plump figure with an overflow\r\nof animal life is the woman most commonly sought, for nature in man craves\r\nfor the strong qualities in women, as the health and life of offspring\r\ndepend upon the physical qualities of wife and mother. A good body and\r\nvigorous health, therefore, become indispensable to female beauty.\r\n\r\n5. BROAD HIPS.--A woman with a large pelvis gives her a superior and\r\nsignificant appearance, while a narrow pelvis always indicate weak\r\nsexuality. The other portions of the body however must be in harmony with\r\nthe size and breadth of the hips.\r\n\r\n6. FULL BUSTS.--In the female beauty of physical development there is\r\nnothing that can equal full breasts. It is an indication of good health and\r\ngood maternal qualities. As a face looks bad without a nose, so the female\r\nbreast, when narrow and flat, produces a bad effect. The female breasts are\r\nthe means on which a new-born child depends for its life and growth, hence\r\nit is an essential human instinct for men to admire those physical\r\nproportions in women which indicate perfect motherhood. Cotton and all\r\nother false forms simply show the value of natural ones. All false forms\r\nare easily detected, because large natural ones will generally quiver and\r\nmove at every step, while the artificial ones will manifest no expression\r\nof life. As woman looks so much better with artificial paddings and\r\npuffings than she does without, therefore modern society should waive all\r\nobjections to their use. A full breast has been man's admiration through\r\nall climes and ages, and whether this breast-loving instinct is right or\r\nwrong, sensible or sensual, it is a fact well known to all, that it is a\r\ngreat disappointment to a husband and father to see his child brought up on\r\na bottle. Men love full breasts, because it promotes maternity. If,\r\nhowever, the breasts are abnormally large, it indicates maternal deficiency\r\nthe same as any disproportion or extreme.\r\n\r\n7. SMALL FEET.--Small feet and small ankles are very attractive, because\r\nthey are in harmony with a perfect female form, and men admire perfection.\r\nSmall feet and ankles indicate modesty and reserve, while large feet and\r\nankles indicate coarseness, physical power, authority, predominance. Feet\r\nand ankles however must be in harmony with the body, as small feet and\r\nsmall ankles on a large woman would be out of proportion and consequently\r\nnot beautiful. {131}\r\n\r\n8. BEAUTIFUL ARMS.--As the arm is always in proportion with the other\r\nportions of the body, consequently a well-shaped arm, small hands and small\r\nwrists, with full muscular development, is a charm and beauty not inferior\r\nto the face itself, and those who have well-shaped arms may be proud of\r\nthem, because they generally keep company with a fine bust and a fine\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n9. INTELLIGENCE.--A mother must naturally possess intelligence, in order to\r\nrear her children intelligently, consequently it is natural for man to\r\nchiefly admire mental qualities in women, for utility and practicability\r\ndepend upon intelligence. Therefore a man generally loves those charms in\r\nwomen which prepare her for the duties of companionship. If a woman desires\r\nto be loved, she must cultivate her intellectual gifts, be interesting and\r\nentertaining in society, and practical and helpful in the home, for these\r\nare some of the qualifications which make up the highest type of beauty.\r\n\r\n10. PIETY AND RELIGION IN WOMEN.--Men who love home and the companionship\r\nof their wives, love truth, honor and honesty. It is this higher moral\r\ndevelopment that naturally leads them to admire women of moral and\r\nreligious natures. It is therefore not strange that immoral men love moral\r\nand church-loving wives. Man naturally admires the qualities which tend to\r\nthe correct government of the home. Men want good and pure children, and it\r\nis natural to select women who insure domestic contentment and happiness. A\r\nbad man, of course, does not deserve a good wife, yet he will do his utmost\r\nto get one.\r\n\r\n11. FALSE APPEARANCE.--Men love reserved, coy and discreet women much more\r\nthan blunt, shrewd and boisterous. Falsehood, false hair, false curls,\r\nfalse forms, false bosoms, false colors, false cheeks, and all that is\r\nfalse, men naturally dislike, for in themselves they are a poor foundation\r\non which to form family ties, consequently duplicity and hypocrisy in women\r\nis very much disliked by men, but a frank, honest, conscientious soul is\r\nalways lovable and lovely and will not become an old maid, except as a\r\nmatter of choice and not of necessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{132}\r\n\r\nHistory of Marriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. \"It is not good for man to be alone,\" was the Divine judgment, and so\r\nGod created for him an helpmate; therefore sex is as Divine as the soul.\r\n{133}\r\n\r\n2. POLYGAMY.--Polygamy has existed in all ages. It is and always has been\r\nthe result of moral degradation and wantonness.\r\n\r\n3. THE GARDEN OF EDEN.--The Garden of Eden was no harem. Primeval nature\r\nknew no community of love; there was only the union of two souls, and the\r\ntwain were made one flesh. If God had intended man to be a polygamist he\r\nwould have created for him two or more wives; but he only created one wife\r\nfor the first man. He also directed Noah to take into the ark two of each\r\nsort--a male and female--another evidence that God believed in pairs only.\r\n\r\n4. ABRAHAM no doubt was a polygamist, and the general history of\r\npatriarchal life shows that the plurality of wives and concubinage were\r\nnational customs, and not the institutions authorized by God.\r\n\r\n5. EGYPTIAN HISTORY.--Egyptian history, in the first ostensible form we\r\nhave, shows that concubinage and polygamy were in common practice.\r\n\r\n6. SOLOMON.--It is not strange that Solomon, with his thousand wives,\r\nexclaimed: \"All is vanity and vexation of spirit.\" Polygamy is not the\r\nnatural state of man.\r\n\r\n7. CONCUBINAGE AND POLYGAMY continued till the fifth century, when the\r\ndegraded condition of woman became to some extent matters of some concern\r\nand recognition. Before this woman was regarded simply as an instrument of\r\nprocreation, or a mistress of the household, to gratify the passions of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n8. THE CHINESE marriage system was, and is, practically polygamous, for\r\nfrom their earliest traditions we learn, although a man could have but one\r\nwife, he was permitted to have as many concubines as he desired.\r\n\r\n9. MOHAMMEDANISM.--Of the 150,000,000 Mohammedans all are polygamists.\r\nTheir religion appeals to the luxury of animal propensities, and the\r\nvoluptuous character of the Orientals has penetrated western Europe and\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n10. MORMONISM.--The Mormon Church, founded by Joseph Smith, practiced\r\npolygamy until the beginning of 1893, when the church formally declared and\r\nresigned polygamy as a part or present doctrine of their religious\r\ninstitution. Yet all Mormons are polygamists at heart. It is a part of\r\ntheir religion; national law alone restrains them.\r\n\r\n11. FREE LOVERS.--There is located at Lenox, Madison County, New York, an\r\norganization popularly known as Free Lovers. The members advocate a system\r\nof complex marriage, a sort of promiscuity, with a freedom of love for\r\n{134} any and all. Man offers woman support and love, woman enjoying\r\nfreedom, self-respect, health, personal and mental competency, gives\r\nherself to man in the boundless sincerity of an unselfish union. In their\r\nsystem, love is made synonymous with sexuality, and there is no doubt but\r\nwhat woman is only a plaything to gratify animal caprice.\r\n\r\n12. MONOGAMY (SINGLE WIFE), is a law of nature evident from the fact that\r\nit fulfills the three essential conditions of man, viz.: the development of\r\nthe individual, the welfare of society and reproduction. In no nation with\r\na system of polygamy do we find a code of political and moral rights, and\r\nthe condition of woman is that of a slave. In polygamous countries nothing\r\nis added to the education and civilization. The natural tendency is\r\nsensualism, and sensualism tends to mental starvation.\r\n\r\n13. CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION has lifted woman from slavery to liberty.\r\nWherever Christian civilization prevails there are legal marriages, pure\r\nhomes and education. May God bless the purity of the home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarriage.\r\n\r\n \"Thus grief still treads upon the heel of pleasure,\r\n  Married in haste we may repent at leisure.\"--SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\nThe parties are wedded. The priest or clergyman has pronounced as one those\r\nhearts that before beat in unison with each other. The assembled guests\r\ncongratulate the happy pair. The fair bride has left her dear mother\r\nbedewed with tears and sobbing just as if her heart would break, and as if\r\nthe happy bridegroom was leading her away captive against her will. They\r\nenter the carriage. It drives off on the wedding tour, and his arms\r\nencircles the yielding waist of her now all his own, while her head\r\nreclines on the breast of the man of her choice. If she be young and has\r\nmarried an old man, she will be sad. If she has married for a home, or\r\nposition, or wealth, a pang will shoot across her fair bosom. If she has\r\nmarried without due consideration or on too light an acquaintance, it will\r\nbe her sorrow before long. But, if loving and beloved, she has united her\r\ndestiny with a worthy man, she will rejoice, and on her journey feel a glow\r\nof satisfaction and delight unfelt before and which will be often renewed,\r\nand daily prove as the living waters from some perennial spring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       * {135}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Advantages of Wedlock.\r\n\r\n   'Tis sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark,\r\n  Bay deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near home;\r\n   'Tis sweet to know there is an eye will mark\r\n  Our coming, and look brighter when we come.--BYRON, DON JUAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. Marriage is the natural state of man and woman. Matrimony greatly\r\ncontributes to the wealth and health of man.\r\n\r\n2. Circumstances may compel a man not to select a companion until late in\r\nlife. Many may have parents or relatives, dependent brothers and sisters to\r\ncare for, yet family {136} ties are cultivated, notwithstanding the home is\r\nwithout a wife.\r\n\r\n3. In Christian countries the laws of marriage have greatly added to the\r\nhealth of man. Marriage in barbarous countries, where little or no marriage\r\nceremonies are required, benefits man but little. There can be no true\r\ndomestic blessedness without loyalty and love for the select and married\r\ncompanion. All the licentiousness and lust of a libertine, whether\r\ncivilized or uncivilized, bring him only unrest and premature decay.\r\n\r\n4. A man, however, may be married and not mated, and consequently reap\r\ntrouble and unhappiness. A young couple should first carefully learn each\r\nother by making the courtship a matter of business, and sufficiently long\r\nthat the disposition and temper of each may be thoroughly exposed and\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n5. First see that there is love; secondly, that there is adaptation;\r\nthirdly, see that there are no physical defects; and if these conditions\r\nare properly considered, cupid will go with you.\r\n\r\n6. The happiest place on all earth is home. A loving wife and lovely\r\nchildren are jewels without price, as Payne says:\r\n\r\n \"'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,\r\n  Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.\"\r\n\r\n7. Reciprocated love produces a general exhilaration of the system. The\r\nelasticity of the muscles is increased, the circulation is quickened, and\r\nevery bodily function is stimulated to renewed activity by a happy\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n8. The consummation desired by all who experience this affection, is the\r\nunion of souls in a true marriage. Whatever of beauty or romance there may\r\nhave been in the lover's dream, is enhanced and spiritualized in the\r\nintimate communion of married life. The crown of wifehood and maternity is\r\npurer, more divine than that of the maiden. Passion is lost--emotions\r\npredominate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ALGERIAN BRIDE.]\r\n\r\n9. TOO EARLY MARRIAGES.--Too early marriage is always bad for the female.\r\nIf a young girl marries, her system is weakened and a full development of\r\nher body is prevented, and the dangers of confinement are considerably\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n10. Boys who marry young derive but little enjoyment from the connubial\r\nstate. They are liable to excesses and thereby lose much of the vitality\r\nand power of strength and physical endurance.\r\n\r\n11. LONG LIFE.--Statistics show that married men live longer than\r\nbachelors. Child-bearing for women is conducive to longevity.\r\n\r\n{137} 12. COMPLEXION.--Marriage purifies the complexion, removes blotches\r\nfrom the skin, invigorates the body, fills up the tones of the voice, gives\r\nelasticity and firmness to the step, and brings health and contentment to\r\nold age.\r\n\r\n13. TEMPTATIONS REMOVED.--Marriage sanctifies a home, while adultery and\r\nlibertinism produce unrest, distrust and misery. It must be remembered that\r\na married man can practice the most absolute continence and enjoy a far\r\nbetter state of health than the licentious man. The comforts of\r\ncompanionship develop purity and give rest to the soul.\r\n\r\n14. TOTAL ABSTENTION.--It is no doubt difficult for some men to fully\r\nabstain from sexual intercourse and be entirely chaste in mind. The great\r\nmajority of men experience frequent strong sexual desire. Abstention is\r\nvery apt to produce in their minds voluptuous images and untamable desires\r\nwhich require an iron will to banish or control. The hermit in his\r\nseclusion, or the monk in his retreat, are often flushed with these\r\npassions and trials. It is, however, natural; for remove these passions and\r\nman would be no longer a man. It is evident that the natural state of man\r\nis that of marriage; and he who avoids that state is not in harmony with\r\nthe laws of his being.\r\n\r\n15. PROSTITUTION.--Men who inherit strong passions easily argue themselves\r\ninto the belief, either to practice {138} masturbation or visit places of\r\nprostitution, on the ground that their health demands it. Though medical\r\ninvestigation has proven it repeatedly to be false, yet many believe it.\r\nThe consummation of marriage involves the mightiest issues of life and is\r\nthe most holy and sacred right recognized by man, and it is the Balm of\r\nGilead for many ills. Masturbation or prostitution soon blight the\r\nbrightest prospects a young man may have. Manhood is morality and purity of\r\npurpose, not sensuality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDisadvantages of Celibacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Disadvantages of Celibacy.\r\nKeeping Bachelor's Hall.\r\nThe Old Bachelor Sewing on His Buttons.]\r\n\r\n1. To live the life of a bachelor has many advantages and many\r\ndisadvantages. The man who commits neither fornication, adultery nor secret\r\nvice, and is pure in mind, surely has all the moral virtues that make a\r\ngood man and a good citizen, whether married or unmarried.\r\n\r\n2. If a good pure-minded man does not marry, he will suffer no serious loss\r\nof vital power; there will be no tendency to spermatorrhoea or congestion,\r\nnor will he be afflicted with any one of those ills which certain vicious\r\nwriters and quacks would lead many people to believe. Celibacy is perfectly\r\nconsistent with mental vigor and physical strength. Regularity in the\r\nhabits of life will always have its good effects on the human body.\r\n\r\n3. The average life of a married man is much longer than that of a\r\nbachelor. There is quite an alarming odds in the United States in favor of\r\na man with a family. It is claimed that the married man lives on an average\r\nfrom five to twenty years longer than a bachelor. The married man lives a\r\nmore regular life. He has his meals more regularly and is better nursed in\r\nsickness, and in every way a happier and more contented man. The happiness\r\nof wife and children will always add comfort and length of days to the man\r\nwho is happily married.\r\n\r\n4. It is a fact well answered by statistics that there is more crime\r\ncommitted, more vices practiced, and more immorality among single men than\r\namong married men. Let the young man be pure in heart like Bunyan's\r\nPilgrim, and he can pass the deadly dens, the roaring lions, and overcome\r\nthe ravenous fires of passion, unscathed. The vices of single men support\r\nthe most flagrant of evils of modern society, hence let every young man\r\nbeware and keep his body clean and pure. His future happiness largely\r\ndepends upon his chastity while a single man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{140}\r\n\r\nOld Maids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WE SHALL NEVER MARRY.\"]\r\n\r\n1. MODERN ORIGIN.--The prejudice which certainly still exists in the\r\naverage mind against unmarried women must be of comparatively modern\r\norigin. From the earliest ages, in ancient Greece, and Rome particularly,\r\nthe highest {141} honors were paid them. They were the ministers of the old\r\nreligions, and regarded with superstitious awe.\r\n\r\n2. MATRIMONY.--Since the reformation, especially during the last century,\r\nand in our own land, matrimony has been so much esteemed, notably by women,\r\nthat it has come to be regarded as in some sort discreditable for them to\r\nremain single. Old maids are mentioned on every hand with mingled pity and\r\ndisdain, arising no doubt from the belief, conscious or unconscious, that\r\nthey would not be what they are if they could help it. Few persons have a\r\ngood word for them as a class. We are constantly hearing of lovely maidens,\r\ncharming wives, buxom widows, but almost never of attractive old maids.\r\n\r\n3. DISCARDING PREJUDICE.--The real old maid is like any other woman. She\r\nhas faults necessarily, though not those commonly conceived of. She is\r\noften plump, pretty, amiable, interesting, intellectual, cultured,\r\nwarm-hearted, benevolent, and has ardent friends of both sexes. These\r\nconstantly wonder why she has not married, for they feel that she must have\r\nhad many opportunities. Some of them may know why; she may have made them\r\nher confidantes. She usually has a sentimental, romantic, frequently a sad\r\nand pathetic past, of which she does not speak unless in the sacredness of\r\nintimacy.\r\n\r\n4. NOT QUARRELSOME.--She is not dissatisfied, querulous nor envious. On the\r\ncontrary, she is, for the most part, singularly content, patient and\r\nserene,--more so than many wives who have household duties and domestic\r\ncares to tire and trouble them.\r\n\r\n5. REMAIN SINGLE FROM NECESSITY.--It is a stupid, as well as a heinous\r\nmistake, that women who remain single do so from necessity. Almost any\r\nwoman can get a husband if she is so minded, as daily observation attests.\r\nWhen we see the multitudes of wives who have no visible signs of\r\nmatrimonial recommendation, why should we think that old maids have been\r\ntotally neglected? We may meet those who do not look inviting. But we meet\r\nany number of wives who are even less inviting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WE HAVE CHANGED OUR MINDS.\"]\r\n\r\n6. FIRST OFFER.--The appearance and outgiving of many wives denote that\r\nthey have accepted the first offer; the appearance and outgiving of many\r\nold maids that they have declined repeated offers. It is undeniable, that\r\nwives, in the mass, have no more charm than old maids have, in the mass.\r\nBut, as the majority of women are married, they are no more criticised nor\r\ncommented on, in the bulk, than the whole sex are. They are spoken of\r\nindividually as pretty or {143} plain, bright or dull, pleasant or\r\nunpleasant; while old maids are judged as a species, and almost always\r\nunfavorable.\r\n\r\n7. BECOMES A WIFE.--Many an old maid, so-called, unexpectedly to her\r\nassociates becomes a wife, some man of taste, discernment and sympathy\r\nhaving induced her to change her state. Probably no other man of his kind\r\nhas proposed before, which accounts for her singleness. After her marriage\r\nhundreds of persons who had sneered at her condition find her charming,\r\nthus showing the extent of their prejudice against feminine celibacy. Old\r\nmaids in general, it is fair to presume, do not wait for opportunities, but\r\nfor proposers of an acceptable sort. They may have, indeed they are likely\r\nto have, those, but not to meet these.\r\n\r\n8. NO LONGER MARRY FOR SUPPORT.--The time has changed and women have\r\nchanged with it. They have grown more sensible, more independent in\r\ndisposition as well as circumstances. They no longer marry for support;\r\nthey have proved their capacity to support themselves, and self-support has\r\ndeveloped them in every way. Assured that they can get on comfortably and\r\ncontentedly alone they are better adapted by the assurance for consortship.\r\nThey have rapidly increased from this and cognate causes, and have so\r\nimproved in person, mind and character that an old maid of to-day is wholly\r\ndifferent from an old maid of forty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVINCING HIS WIFE.]\r\n\r\n{144}\r\n\r\nWhen and Whom to Marry.\r\n\r\n1. EARLY MARRIAGES.--Women too early married always remain small in\r\nstature, weak, pale, emaciated, and more or less miserable. We have no\r\nnatural nor moral right to perpetuate unhealthy constitutions, therefore\r\nwomen should not marry too young and take upon themselves the\r\nresponsibility, by producing a weak and feeble generation of children. It\r\nis better not to consummate a marriage until a full development of body and\r\nmind has taken place. A young woman of twenty-one to twenty-five, and a\r\nyoung man of twenty-three to twenty-eight, are considered the right age in\r\norder to produce an intelligent and healthy offspring. \"First make the tree\r\ngood, then shall the fruit be good also.\"\r\n\r\n2. If marriage is delayed too long in either sex, say from thirty to\r\nforty-five, the offspring will often be puny and more liable to insanity,\r\nidiocy, and other maladies.\r\n\r\n3. PUBERTY.--This is the period when childhood passes from immaturity of\r\nthe sexual functions to maturity. Woman attains this state a year or two\r\nsooner than man. In the hotter climates the period of puberty is from\r\ntwelve to fifteen years of age, while in cold climates, such as Russia, the\r\nUnited States, and Canada, puberty is frequently delayed until the\r\nseventeenth year.\r\n\r\n4. DISEASED PARENTS.--We do the race a serious wrong in multiplying the\r\nnumber of hereditary invalids. Whole families of children have fallen heir\r\nto lives of misery and suffering by the indiscretion and poor judgment of\r\nparents. No young man in the vigor of health should think for a moment of\r\nmarrying a girl who has the impress of consumption or other disease already\r\nstamped upon her feeble constitution. It only multiplies his own suffering,\r\nand brings no material happiness to his invalid wife. On the other hand, no\r\nhealthy, vigorous young woman ought to unite her destiny with a man, no\r\nmatter how much she adored him, who is not healthy and able to brave the\r\nhardships of life. If a young man or young woman with feeble body cannot\r\nfind permanent relief either by medicine or change of climate, no thoughts\r\nof marriage should be entertained. Courting a patient may be pleasant, but\r\na hard thing in married life to enjoy. The young lady who supposes that any\r\nyoung man wishes to marry her for the sake of nursing her through life\r\nmakes a very grave mistake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BASHFUL YOUNG COUPLE.\r\n\"A faint heart never won a fair lady.\"]\r\n\r\n5. WHOM TO CHOOSE FOR A HUSBAND.--The choice of a husband requires the\r\ncoolest judgment and the most {146} vigilant sagacity. A true union based\r\non organic law is happiness, but let all remember that oil and water will\r\nnot mix; the lion will not lie down with the lamb, nor can ill-assorted\r\nmarriages be productive of aught but discord.\r\n\r\n             \"Let the woman take\r\n  An elder than herself, so wears she to him--\r\n  So sways she, rules in her husband's heart.\"\r\n\r\nLook carefully at the disposition.--See that your intended spouse is\r\nkind-hearted, generous, and willing to respect the opinions of others,\r\nthough not in sympathy with them. Don't marry a selfish tyrant who thinks\r\nonly of himself.\r\n\r\n6. BE CAREFUL.--Don't marry an intemperate man with a view of reforming\r\nhim. Thousands have tried it and failed. Misery, sorrow and a very hell on\r\nearth have been the consequences of too many such generous undertakings.\r\n\r\n7. THE TRUE AND ONLY TEST which any man should look for in woman is modesty\r\nin demeanor before marriage, absence both of assumed ignorance and\r\ndisagreeable familiarity, and a pure and religious frame of mind. Where\r\nthese are present, he need not doubt that he has a faithful and a chaste\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n8. MARRYING FIRST COUSINS is dangerous to offspring. The observation is\r\nuniversal, the children of married first cousins are too often idiots,\r\ninsane, clump-footed, crippled, blind, or variously diseased. First cousins\r\nare always sure to impart all the hereditary disease in both families to\r\ntheir children. If both are healthy there is less danger.\r\n\r\n9. DO NOT CHOOSE ONE TOO GOOD, or too far above you, lest the inferior\r\ndissatisfying the superior, breed those discords which are worse than the\r\ntrials of a single life. Don't be too particular; for you might go farther\r\nand fare worse. As far as you yourself are faulty, you should put up with\r\nfaults. Don't cheat a consort by getting one much better than you can give.\r\nWe are not in heaven yet, and must put up with their imperfections, and\r\ninstead of grumbling at them, be glad they are no worse; remembering that a\r\nfaulty one is a great deal better than none, if he loves you.\r\n\r\n10. MARRYING FOR MONEY.--Those who seek only the society of those who can\r\nboast of wealth will nine times out of ten suffer disappointment. Wealth\r\ncannot manufacture true love nor money buy domestic happiness. Marry\r\nbecause you love each other, and God will bless your home. A cottage with a\r\nloving wife is worth more than a royal palace with a discontented and\r\nunloving queen. {147}\r\n\r\n11. DIFFERENCE IN AGE.--It is generally admitted that the husband should be\r\na few years older than the wife. The question seems to be how much\r\ndifference. Up to twenty-two those who propose marriage should be about the\r\nsame age; however, other things being equal, a difference of fifteen years\r\nafter the younger is twenty-five, need not prevent a marriage. A man of\r\nforty-five may marry a woman of twenty-five much more safely than one of\r\nthirty a girl below nineteen, because her mental sexuality is not as mature\r\nas his, and again her natural coyness requires more delicate and\r\naffectionate treatment than he is likely to bestow. A girl of twenty or\r\nunder should seldom if ever marry a man of thirty or over, because the love\r\nof an elderly man for a girl is more parental than conjugal; while hers for\r\nhim is like that of a daughter to a father. He may pet, flatter and indulge\r\nher as he would a grown-up daughter, yet all this is not genuine masculine\r\nand feminine love, nor can she exert over him the influence every man\r\nrequires from his wife.\r\n\r\n12. THE BEST TIME.--All things considered, we advise the male reader to\r\nkeep his desires in check till he is at least twenty-five, and the female\r\nnot to enter the pale of wedlock until she has attained the age of twenty.\r\nAfter those periods, marriage is the proper sphere of action, and one in\r\nwhich nearly every individual is called by nature to play his proper part.\r\n\r\n13. SELECT CAREFULLY.--While character, health, accomplishments and social\r\nposition should be considered, yet one must not overlook mental\r\nconstruction and physical conformation. The rule always to be followed in\r\nchoosing a life partner is _identity of taste and diversity of\r\ntemperament_. Another essential is that they be physically adapted to each\r\nother. For example: The pelvis--that part of the anatomy containing all the\r\ninternal organs of gestation--is not only essential to beauty and symmetry,\r\nbut is a matter of vital importance to her who contemplates matrimony, and\r\nits usual consequences. Therefore, the woman with a very narrow and\r\ncontracted pelvis should never choose a man of giant physical development\r\nlest they cannot duly realize the most important of the enjoyments of the\r\nmarriage state, while the birth of large infants will impose upon her\r\nintense labor pains, or even cost her her life. {148}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHOOSE INTELLECTUALLY--LOVE AFTERWARD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Explaining the Necessity for a New Bonnet.]\r\n\r\n1. LOVE.--Let it ever be remembered that love is one of the most sacred\r\nelements of our nature, and the most dangerous with which to tamper. It is\r\na very beautiful and delicately contrived faculty, producing the most\r\ndelightful results, but easily thrown out of repair--like a tender plant,\r\nthe delicate fibers of which incline gradually to entwine themselves around\r\nits beloved one, uniting two willing hearts by a thousand endearing ties,\r\nand making of \"twain one flesh\"; but they are easily torn asunder, and then\r\nadieu to the joys of connubial bliss! {149}\r\n\r\n2. COURTING BY THE QUARTER.--This courting by the quarter, \"here a little\r\nand there a little,\" is one of the greatest evils of the day. This getting\r\na little in love with Julia, and then a little with Eliza, and a little\r\nmore with Mary,--this fashionable flirtation and coquetry of both sexes--is\r\nruinous to the domestic affections; besides, effectually preventing the\r\nformation of true connubial love. I consider this dissipation of the\r\naffections one of the greatest sins against Heaven, ourselves, and the one\r\ntrifled with, that can be committed.\r\n\r\n3. FRITTERING AWAY AFFECTIONS.--Young men commence courting long before\r\nthey think of marrying, and where they entertain no thoughts of marriage.\r\nThey fritter away their own affections, and pride themselves on their\r\nconquests over the female heart; triumphing in having so nicely fooled\r\nthem. They pursue this sinful course so far as to drive their pitiable\r\nvictims, one after another, from respectable society, who, becoming\r\ndisgraced, retaliate by heaping upon them all the indignities and\r\nimpositions which the fertile imagination of woman can invent or execute.\r\n\r\n4. COURTING WITHOUT INTENDING TO MARRY.--Nearly all this wide-spread crime\r\nand suffering connected with public and private licentiousness and\r\nprostitution, has its origin in these unmeaning courtships--this premature\r\nlove--this blighting of the affections, and every young man who courts\r\nwithout intending to marry, is throwing himself or his sweetheart into\r\n_this hell upon earth_. And most of the blame rests on young men, because\r\nthey take the liberty of paying their addresses to the ladies and\r\ndiscontinuing them, at pleasure, and thereby mainly cause this vice.\r\n\r\n5. SETTING THEIR CAPS.--True, young ladies sometimes \"set their caps,\"\r\nsometimes court very hard by their bewitching smiles and affectionate\r\nmanners; by the natural language of love, or that backward reclining and\r\naffectionate roll of the head which expresses it; by their soft and\r\npersuasive accents; by their low dresses, artificial forms, and many other\r\nunnatural and affected ways and means of attracting attention and exciting\r\nlove; but women never court till they have been in love and experienced its\r\ninterruption, till their first and most tender fibres of love have been\r\nfrostbitten by disappointment. It is surely a sad condition of society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HASTY FAMILIARITY IS FRAUGHT WITH MANY DANGERS.\"]\r\n\r\n6. TRAMPLING THE AFFECTIONS OF WOMEN.--But man is a self-privileged\r\ncharacter. He may not only violate the laws of his own social nature with\r\nimpunity, but he may even trample upon the affections of woman. He may even\r\ncarry {151} this sinful indulgence to almost any length, and yet be\r\ncaressed and smiled tenderly upon by woman; aye, even by virtuous woman. He\r\nmay call out, only to blast the glowing affections of one young lady after\r\nanother, and yet his addresses be cordially welcomed by others. Surely a\r\ngentleman is at perfect liberty to pay his addresses, not only to a lady,\r\nbut even to the ladies, although he does not once entertain the thought of\r\nmarrying his sweet-heart, or, rather his victim. O, man, how depraved! O,\r\nwoman, how strangely blind to your own rights and interests!\r\n\r\n7. AN INFALLIBLE SIGN.--An infallible sign that a young man's intentions\r\nare improper, is his trying to excite your passions. If he loves you, he\r\nwill never appeal to that feeling, because he respects you too much for\r\nthat. And the woman who allows a man to take advantage of her just to\r\ncompel him to marry her, is lost and heartless in the last degree, and\r\nutterly destitute of moral principle as well as virtue. A woman's riches is\r\nher virtue, that gone she has lost all.\r\n\r\n8. THE BEGINNING OF LICENTIOUSNESS.--Man it seldom drives from society. Do\r\nwhat he may, woman, aye, virtuous and even pious woman rarely excludes him\r\nfrom her list of visitors. But where is the point of propriety?--immoral\r\ntransgression should exclude either sex from respectable society. Is it\r\nthat one false step which now constitutes the boundary between virtue and\r\nvice? Or rather, the discovery of that false step? Certainly not! but it is\r\nall that leads to, and precedes and induces it. It is this courting without\r\nmarrying. This is the beginning of licentiousness, as well as its main,\r\nprocuring cause, and therefore infinitely worse than its consummation\r\nmerely.\r\n\r\n9. SEARING THE SOCIAL AFFECTIONS.--He has seared his social affections so\r\ndeeply, so thoroughly, so effectually, that when, at last, he wishes to\r\nmarry, he is incapable of loving. He marries, but is necessarily\r\ncold-hearted towards his wife, which of course renders her wretched, if not\r\njealous, and reverses the faculties of both towards each other; making both\r\nmost miserable for life. This induces contention and mutual recrimination,\r\nif not unfaithfulness, and imbitters the marriage relations through life;\r\nand well it may.\r\n\r\n10. UNHAPPY MARRIAGES.--This very cause, besides inducing most of that\r\nunblushing public and private prostitution already alluded to, renders a\r\nlarge proportion of the marriages of the present day unhappy. Good people\r\nmourn over the result, but do not once dream of its cause. They even pray\r\nfor moral reform, yet do the very things that increase the evil. {152}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.]\r\n\r\n11. WEEPING OVER HER FALLEN SON.--Do you see yonder godly mother, weeping\r\nover her fallen son, and remonstrating with him in tones of a mother's\r\ntenderness and importunity? That very mother prevented that very son\r\nmarrying the girl he dearly loved, because she was poor, and this\r\ninterruption of his love was the direct and procuring cause of his ruin;\r\nfor, if she had allowed him to marry this beloved one, he never would have\r\nthought of giving his \"strength unto strange women.\" True, the mother\r\nruined her son ignorantly, but none the less effectually.\r\n\r\n12. SEDUCTION AND RUIN.--That son next courts another virtuous fair one,\r\nengages her affections, and ruins her, or else leaves her broken-hearted,\r\nso that she is the more easily ruined by others, and thus prepares the way\r\nfor her becoming an inmate of a house \"whose steps take hold on hell.\" His\r\nheart is now indifferent, he is ready for anything.\r\n\r\n13. THE RIGHT PRINCIPLE.--I say then, with emphasis, that no man should\r\never pay his addresses to any woman, until he has made his selection, not\r\neven to aid him in making that choice. He should first make his selection\r\nintellectually, and love afterward. He should go about the matter coolly\r\nand with judgment, just as he would undertake any other important matter.\r\nNo man or woman, when blinded by love, is in a fit state to judge\r\nadvantageously as to what he or she requires, or who is adapted to his or\r\nher wants.\r\n\r\n14. CHOOSING FIRST AND LOVING AFTERWARDS.--I know, indeed, that this\r\ndoctrine of choosing first and loving afterward, of excluding love from the\r\ncouncils, and of choosing by and with the consent of the intellect and\r\nmoral sentiments, is entirely at variance with the feelings of the young\r\nand the customs of society; but, for its correctness, I appeal to the\r\ncommon-sense--not to the experience, for so few try this plan. Is not this\r\nthe only proper method, and the one most likely to result happily? Try it.\r\n\r\n15. THE YOUNG WOMAN'S CAUTION.--And, especially, let no young lady ever\r\nonce think of bestowing her affections till she is certain they will not be\r\nbroken off--that is, until the match is fully agreed upon; but rather let\r\nher keep her heart whole till she bestows it for life. This requisition is\r\nas much more important, and its violation as much more disastrous to woman\r\nthan to man, as her social faculties are stronger than his.\r\n\r\n16. A BURNT CHILD DREADS THE FIRE.--As a \"burnt child dreads the fire,\" and\r\nthe more it is burnt, the greater the dread: so your affections, once\r\ninterrupted, will recoil from a second love, and distrust all mankind. No!\r\nyou cannot be too choice of your love--that pivot on which turn your\r\ndestinies for life and future happiness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{154}\r\n\r\nLove-Spats.\r\n\r\n  For aught that ever I could read,\r\n  Could ever hear by tale or history,\r\n  The course of true love never did ran smooth.\"--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n \"Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned,\r\n  Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.\"--CONGREVE.\r\n\r\n    \"Thunderstorms clear the atmosphere and promote vegetation; then why\r\n    not Love-spats promote love, as they certainly often do?\r\n\r\n    They are almost universal, and in the nature of our differences cannot\r\n    be helped. The more two love, the more they are aggrieved by each\r\n    other's faults; of which these spats are but the correction.\r\n\r\n    Love-spats instead of being universal, they are consequent on imperfect\r\n    love, and only aggravate, never correct errors. Sexual storms never\r\n    improve, whereas love obviates faults by praising the opposite virtues.\r\n    Every view of them, practical and philosophical, condemns them as being\r\n    to love what poison is to health, both before and after marriage. They\r\n    are nothing but married discords. Every law of mind and love condemns\r\n    them. Shun them as you would deadly vipers, and prevent them by\r\n    forestallment.\"--O. S. Fowler.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1. THE TRUE FACTS.--Notwithstanding some of the above quotations, to the\r\ncontrary, trouble and disagreement between lovers embitters both love and\r\nlife. Contention is always dangerous, and will beget alienation if not\r\nfinal separation.\r\n\r\n2. CONFIRMED AFFECTIONS.--Where affections are once thoroughly confirmed,\r\neach one should be very careful in taking offense, and avoid all\r\ndisagreements as far as possible, but if disagreements continually develop\r\nwith more or less friction and irritation, it is better for the crisis to\r\ncome and a final separation take place. For peace is better than disunited\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUPID'S REBELLION]\r\n\r\n3. HATE-SPATS.--Hate-spats, though experienced by most lovers, yet, few\r\nrealize how fatal they are to subsequent affections. Love-spats develop\r\ninto hate-spats, and their effects upon the affections are blighting and\r\nshould not under any circumstances be tolerated. Either agree, or agree to\r\ndisagree. If there cannot be harmony before the ties of marriage are\r\nassumed, then there cannot be harmony {156} after. Married life will be\r\ncontinually marred by a series of \"hate-spats\" that sooner or later will\r\ndestroy all happiness, unless the couple are reasonably well mated.\r\n\r\n4. MORE FATAL THE OFTENER THEY OCCUR.--As O. S. Fowler says: \"'The poison\r\nof asps is under their lips.' The first spat is like a deep gash cut into a\r\nbeautiful face, rendering it ghastly, and leaving a fearful scar, which\r\nneither time nor cosmetics can ever efface; including that pain so fatal to\r\nlove, and blotting that sacred love-page with memory's most hideous and\r\nimperishable visages. Cannot many now unhappy remember them as the\r\nbeginning of that alienation which embittered your subsequent affectional\r\ncup, and spoiled your lives? With what inherent repulsion do you look back\r\nupon them? Their memory is horrid, and effect on love most destructive.\"\r\n\r\n5. FATAL CONDITIONS.--What are all lovers' \"spats\" but disappointment in\r\nits very worst form? They necessarily and always produce all its terrible\r\nconsequences. The finer feelings and sensibilities will soon become\r\ndestroyed and nothing but hatred will remain.\r\n\r\n6. EXTREME SORROW.--After a serious \"spat\" there generally follows a period\r\nof tender sorrow, and a feeling of humiliation and submission. Mutual\r\npromises are consequently made that such a condition of things shall never\r\nhappen again, etc. But be sure and remember, that every subsequent\r\ndifficulty will require stronger efforts to repair the breach. Let it be\r\nunderstood that these compromises are dangerous, and every new difficulty\r\nincreases their fatality. Even the strongest will endure but few, nor\r\nsurvive many.\r\n\r\n7. DISTRUST AND WANT OF CONFIDENCE.--Most difficulties arise from distrust\r\nor lack of confidence or common-sense. When two lovers eye each other like\r\ntwo curs, each watching, lest the other should gain some new advantage,\r\nthen this shows a lack of common-sense, and the young couple should get\r\nsensible or separate.\r\n\r\n8. JEALOUSY.--When one of the lovers, once so tender, now all at once so\r\ncold and hardened; once so coy and familiar, now suddenly so reserved,\r\ndistant, hard and austere, is always a sure case of jealousy. A jealous\r\nperson is first talkative, very affectionate, and then all at once changes\r\nand becomes cold, reserved and repulsive, apparently without cause. If a\r\nperson is jealous before marriage, this characteristic will be increased\r\nrather than diminished by marriage. {157}\r\n\r\n9. CONFESSION.--If you make up by confession, the confessor feels mean and\r\ndisgraced; or if both confess and forgive, both feel humbled; since\r\nforgiveness implies inferiority and pity; from which whatever is manly and\r\nwomanly shrinks. Still even this is better than continued \"spats.\"\r\n\r\n10. PREVENTION.--If you can get along well in your courtship you will\r\ninvariably make a happy couple if you should unite your destinies in\r\nmarriage. Learn not to give nor take offence. You must remember that all\r\nhumanity is imperfect at best. We all have our faults, and must keep them\r\nin subordination. Those who truly love each other will have but few\r\ndifficulties in their courtship or in married life.\r\n\r\n11. REMEDIES.--Establishing a perfect love in the beginning constitutes a\r\npreventive. Fear that they are not truly loved usually paves the way for\r\n\"spats.\" Let all who make any pretension guard against all beginnings of\r\nthis reversal, and strangle these \"hate-spats\" the moment they arise. \"Let\r\nnot the sun go down upon thy wrath,\" not even an hour, but let the next\r\nsentence after they begin quench them forever. And let those who cannot\r\ncourt without \"spats,\" stop; for those who spat before marriage, must\r\nquarrel after.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{159}\r\n\r\nA Broken Heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BROKEN HEART]\r\n\r\n1. WOUNDED LOVE.--Tis true that love wields a magic, sovereign, absolute,\r\nand tyrannical power over both the body and the mind when it is given\r\ncontrol. It often, in case of disappointment, works havoc and deals death\r\nblows to its victims, and leaves many in that morbid mental condition which\r\nno life-tonics simply can restore. Wounded love may be the result of hasty\r\nand indiscreet conduct of young people; or the outgrowth of lust, or the\r\nresult of domestic infidelity and discord.\r\n\r\n2. FATAL EFFECTS.--Our cemeteries receive within the cold shadows of the\r\ngrave thousands and thousands of victims that annually die from the results\r\nof \"broken hearts.\" It is no doubt a fact that love troubles cause more\r\ndisorders of the heart than everything else combined.\r\n\r\n3. DISRUPTED LOVE.--It has long been known that dogs, birds, and even\r\nhorses, when separated from their companions or friends, have pined away\r\nand died; so it is not strange that man with his higher intuitive ideas of\r\naffection should suffer from love when suddenly disrupted.\r\n\r\n4. CRUCIFYING LOVE.--Painful love feelings strike right to the heart, and\r\nthe breaking up of love that cannot be consummated in marriage is sometimes\r\nallowed to crucify the affections. There is no doubt that the suffering\r\nfrom disappointed love is often deeper and more intense than meeting death\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n5. HEALING.--The paralyzing and agonizing consequences of ruptured love can\r\nonly be remedied by diversion and society. Bring the mind into a state of\r\npatriotic independence with a full determination to blot out the past.\r\nThose who cannot bring into subordination the pangs of disappointment in\r\nlove are not strong characters, and invariably will suffer disappointments\r\nin almost every department of life. Disappointment in love means rising\r\nabove it, and conquering it, or demoralization, mental, physical and\r\nsexual.\r\n\r\n6. LOVE RUNS MAD.--Love comes unbidden. A blind ungovernable impulse seems\r\nto hold sway in the passions of the affections. Love is blind and seems to\r\ncompletely subdue and conquer. It often comes like a clap of thunder from a\r\nclear sky, and when it falls it falls flat, leaving only the ruins of a\r\ntornado behind.\r\n\r\n7. BAD, DISMAL, AND BLUE FEELINGS.--Despondency breathes disease, and those\r\nwho yield to it can neither work, eat nor sleep; they only suffer. The\r\nspell-bound, fascinated, magnetized affections seem to deaden self-control\r\nand no {160} doubt many suffering from love-sickness are totally helpless;\r\nthey are beside themselves, irritational and wild. Men and women of genius,\r\ninfluence and education, all seem to suffer alike, but they do not yield\r\nalike to the subduing influence; some pine away and die; others rise above\r\nit, and are the stronger and better for having been afflicted.\r\n\r\n8. RISE ABOVE IT.--Cheer up! If you cannot think pleasurably over your\r\nmisfortune, forget it. You must do this or perish. Your power and influence\r\nis too much to blight by foolish and melancholicy pining. Your own sense,\r\nyour self-respect, your self-love, your love for others, command you not to\r\nspoil yourself by crying over \"spilt milk.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARRIAGE ON A DEATHBED.]\r\n\r\n9. RETRIEVE YOUR PAST LOSS.--Do sun, moon, and stars indeed rise and set in\r\nyour loved one? Are there not \"as good fish in the sea as ever were\r\ncaught?\" and can you not catch them? Are there not other hearts on earth\r\njust as loving and lovely, and in every way as congenial? If circumstances\r\nhad first turned you upon another, you would have felt about that one as\r\nnow about this. Love depends far less on the party loved than on the loving\r\none. Or is this the way either to retrieve your past loss, or provide for\r\nthe future? Is it not both unwise and self-destructive; and in every way\r\ncalculated to render your case, present and prospective, still more\r\nhopeless?\r\n\r\n10. FIND SOMETHING TO DO.--Idle hands are Satan's workshop. Employ your\r\nmind; find something to do; something in which you can find\r\nself-improvement; something that will fit you better to be admired by\r\nsomeone else, read, and improve your mind; get into society, throw your\r\nwhole soul into some new enterprise, and you will conquer with glory and\r\ncome out of the fire purified and made more worthy.\r\n\r\n11. LOVE AGAIN.--As love was the cause of your suffering, so love again\r\nwill restore you, and you will love better and more consistently. Do not\r\nallow yourself to become soured and detest and shun association. Rebuild\r\nyour dilapidated sexuality by cultivating a general appreciation of the\r\nexcellence, especially of the mental and moral qualities of the opposite\r\nsex. Conquer your prejudices, and vow not to allow anyone to annoy or\r\ndisturb your calmness.\r\n\r\n12. LOVE FOR THE DEAD.--A most affectionate woman, who continues to love\r\nher affianced though long dead, instead of becoming soured or deadened,\r\nmanifests all the richness and sweetness of the fully-developed woman\r\nthoroughly in love, along with a softened, mellow, twilight sadness which\r\ntouches every heart, yet throws a peculiar lustre and beauty over her\r\nmanners and entire character. She must mourn, {161} but not forever. It is\r\nnot her duty to herself or to her Creator.\r\n\r\n13. A SURE REMEDY.--Come in contact with the other sex. You are infused\r\nwith your lover's magnetism, which must remain till displaced by another's.\r\nGo to parties and picnics; be free, familiar, offhand, even forward; try\r\nyour knack at fascinating another, and yield to fascinations yourself. But\r\nbe honest, command respect, and make yourself attractive and worthy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{162}\r\n\r\nFormer Customs and Peculiarities Among Men.\r\n\r\n1. POLYGAMY.--There is a wide difference as regards the relations of the\r\nsexes in different parts of the world. In some parts polygamy has prevailed\r\nfrom time immemorial.\r\n\r\nMost savage people are polygamists, and the Turks, though slowly departing\r\nfrom the practice, still allow themselves a plurality of wives.\r\n\r\n2. RULE REVERSED.--In Thibet the rule is reversed, and the females are\r\nprovided with two or more husbands. It is said that in many instances a\r\nwhole family of brothers have but one wife. The custom has at least one\r\nadvantageous feature, viz.: the possibility of leaving an unprotected widow\r\nand a number of fatherless children is entirely obviated.\r\n\r\n3. THE MORGANATIC MARRIAGE is a modification of polygamy. It sometimes\r\noccurs among the royalty of Europe, and is regarded as perfectly\r\nlegitimate, but the morganatic wife is of lower rank than her royal\r\nhusband, and her children do not inherit his rank or fortune. The Queen\r\nonly is the consort of the sovereign, and entitled to share his rank.\r\n\r\n4. DIFFERENT MANNERS OF OBTAINING WIVES.--Among the uncivilized almost any\r\nenvied possession is taken by brute force or superior strength. The same is\r\ntrue in obtaining a wife. The strong take precedence of the weak. It is\r\nsaid that among the North American Indians it was the custom for men to\r\nwrestle for the choice of women. A weak man could seldom retain a wife that\r\na strong man coveted.\r\n\r\nThe law of contest was not confined to individuals alone. Women were\r\nfrequently the cause of whole tribes arraying themselves against each other\r\nin battle. The effort to excel in physical power was a great incentive to\r\nbodily development, and since the best of the men were preferred by the\r\nmost superior women, the custom was a good one in this, that the race was\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n5. THE ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIAN employed low cunning and heartless cruelty in\r\nobtaining his wife. Laying in ambush, with club in hand, he would watch for\r\nthe coveted woman, {163} and, unawares, spring upon her. If simply disabled\r\nhe carried her off as his possession, but if the blow had been hard enough\r\nto kill, he abandoned her to watch for another victim. There is here no\r\neffort to attract or please, no contest of strength; his courtship, if\r\ncourtship it can be called, would compare very unfavorably with any among\r\nthe brute creation.\r\n\r\n6. THE KALMUCK TARTAR races for his bride on horseback, she having a\r\ncertain start previously agreed upon. The _nuptial knot_ consists in\r\ncatching her, but we are told that the result of the race all depends upon\r\nwhether the girl wants to be caught or not.\r\n\r\n7. SANDWICH ISLANDERS.--Marriage among the early natives of these islands\r\nwas merely a matter of mutual inclination. There was no ceremony at all,\r\nthe men and women united and separated as they felt disposed.\r\n\r\n8. THE FEUDAL LORD, in various parts of Europe, when any of his dependents\r\nor followers married, exercised the right of assuming the bridegroom's\r\nproper place in the marriage couch for the first night. Seldom was there\r\nany escape from this abominable practice. Sometimes the husband, if\r\nwealthy, succeeded in buying off the petty sovereign from exercising his\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\n9. THE SPARTANS had the custom of encouraging intercourse between their\r\nbest men and women for the sake of a superior progeny, without any\r\nreference to a marriage ceremony. Records show that the ancient Roman\r\nhusband has been known to invite a friend, in whom he may have admired some\r\nphysical or mental trait, to share the favors of his wife, that the\r\npeculiar qualities that he admired might be repeated in the offspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{164}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Peasant Father Blessing His Daughter at Her Engagement.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{165}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    Hasty marriage seldom proveth well.--_Shakespere, Henry VI._\r\n\r\n    The reason why so few marriages are happy is, because young ladies\r\n    spend their time in making nets, not in making cages.--_Swift, Thoughts\r\n    on Various Subjects._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSensible Hints in Choosing a Partner.\r\n\r\n1. There are many fatal errors and many love-making failures in courtship.\r\nNatural laws govern all nature and reduce all they govern to eternal right;\r\ntherefore love naturally, not artificially. Don't love a somebody or a\r\nnobody simply because they have money.\r\n\r\n2. COURT SCIENTIFICALLY.--If you court at all, court scientifically. Bungle\r\nwhatever else you will, but do not bungle courtship. A failure in this may\r\nmean more than a loss of wealth or public honors; it may mean ruin, or a\r\nlife often worse than death. The world is full of wretched and mismated\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBEGIN RIGHT and all will be right; begin wrong and all will end wrong. When\r\nyou court, make a business of it and study your interest the same as you\r\nwould study any other business proposition.\r\n\r\n3. DIVORCES.--There is not a divorce on our court records that is not the\r\nresult of some fundamental error in courtship. The purity or the power of\r\nlove may be corrupted the same as any other faculty, and when a man makes\r\nup his mind to marry and shuts his eyes and grabs in the dark for a\r\ncompanion, he dishonors the woman he captures and commits a crime against\r\nGod and society. In this enlightened age there should be comparatively few\r\nmistakes made in the selection of a suitable partner. Sufficient time\r\nshould be taken to study each other's character and disposition.\r\nAssociation will soon reveal adaptability.\r\n\r\n4. FALSE LOVE.--Many a poor, blind and infatuated novice thinks he is\r\ndesperately in love, when there is not the least genuine affection in his\r\nnature. It is all a momentary {166} passion, a sort of puppy love; his vows\r\nand pledges are soon violated, and in wedlock he will become indifferent\r\nand cold to his wife and children, and he will go through life without\r\nambition, encouragement or success. He will be a failure. True love speaks\r\nfor itself, and the casual observer can read its proclamations. True love\r\ndoes not speak in a whisper. It always makes itself heard. The follies of\r\nflirting develop into many unhappy marriages, and blight many a life. A man\r\nhappily married has superior advantages both socially and financially.\r\n\r\n5. FLIRTING JUST FOR FUN.--Who is the flirt, what is his reputation,\r\nmotive, or character? Every young man and woman must have a reputation; if\r\nit is not good it is bad, there is no middle ground. Young people who are\r\nrunning in the streets after dark, boisterous and noisy in their\r\nconversation, gossiping and giggling, flirting with first one and then\r\nanother, will soon settle their matrimonial prospects among good society.\r\nModesty is a priceless jewel. No sensible young man with a future will\r\nmarry a flirt.\r\n\r\n6. THE ARCH-DECEIVER.--They who win the affection simply for their own\r\namusement are committing a great sin for which there is no adequate\r\npunishment. How can you shipwreck the innocent life of that confiding\r\nmaiden, how can you forget her happy looks as she drank in your expressions\r\nof love, how can you forget her melting eyes and glowing cheeks, her tender\r\ntone reciprocating your pretended love? Remember that God is infinitely\r\njust, and \"the soul that sinneth shall surely die.\" You may dash into\r\nbusiness, seek pleasure in the club room, and visit gambling hells, but\r\n\"Thou art the man\" will ever stare you in the face. Her pale, sad cheeks,\r\nher hollow eyes will never cease to haunt you. Men should promote\r\nhappiness, and not cause misery. Let the savage Indians torture captives to\r\ndeath by the slow flaming fagot, but let civilized man respect the\r\ntenderness and love of confiding women. Torturing the opposite sex is\r\ndouble-distilled barbarity. Young men agonizing young ladies, is the\r\ncold-blooded cruelty of devils, not men.\r\n\r\n7. THE RULE TO FOLLOW.--Do not continually pay your attentions to the same\r\nlady if you have no desire to win her affections. Occasionally escorting\r\nher to church, concert, picnic, party, etc., is perfectly proper; but to\r\ngive her your special attention, and extend invitations to her for all\r\nplaces of amusements where you care to attend, is an implied promise that\r\nyou prefer her company above all others, and she has a right to believe\r\nthat your attentions are serious. {167}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WEDDING RING.]\r\n\r\n8. EVERY GIRL SHOULD SEAL HER HEART against all manifested affections,\r\nunless they are accompanied by a proposal. Woman's love is her all, and her\r\nheart should be as flint until she finds one who is worthy of her\r\nconfidence. Young woman, never bestow your affections until by some word or\r\ndeed at least you are fully justified in recognizing sincerity and faith in\r\nhim who is paying you special attention. Better not be engaged until\r\ntwenty-two. You are {168} then more competent to judge the honesty and\r\nfalsity of man. Nature has thrown a wall of maidenly modesty around you.\r\nPreserve that and not let your affections be trifled with while too young\r\nby any youthful flirt who is in search of hearts to conquer.\r\n\r\n9. FEMALE FLIRTATION.--The young man who loves a young woman has paid her\r\nthe highest compliment in the possession of man. Perpetrate almost any sin,\r\ninflict any other torture, but spare him the agony of disappointment. It is\r\na crime that can never be forgiven, and a debt that never can be paid.\r\n\r\n10. LOYALTY.--Young persons with serious intentions, or those who are\r\nengaged should be thoroughly loyal to each other. If they seek freedom with\r\nothers the flame of jealousy is likely to be kindled and love is often\r\nturned to hatred, and the severest anger of the soul is aroused. Loyalty,\r\nfaithfulness, confidence, are the three jewels to be cherished in\r\ncourtship. Don't be a flirt.\r\n\r\n11. KISSING, FONDLING, AND CARESSING BETWEEN LOVERS.--This should never be\r\ntolerated under any circumstances, unless there is an engagement to justify\r\nit, and then only in a sensible and limited way. The girl who allows a\r\nyoung man the privilege of kissing her or putting his arms around her waist\r\nbefore engagement will at once fall in the estimation of the man she has\r\nthus gratified and desired to please. Privileges always injure, but never\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAYING \"NO\" WHEN MEANING \"YES.\"]\r\n\r\n12. IMPROPER LIBERTIES DURING COURTSHIP KILL LOVE.--Any improper liberties\r\nwhich are permitted by young ladies, whether engaged or not, will change\r\nlove into sensuality, and her affections will become obnoxious, if not\r\nrepellent. Men by nature love virtue, and for a life companion naturally\r\nshun an amorous woman. Young folks, as you love moral purity and virtue,\r\nnever reciprocate love until you have required the right of betrothal.\r\nRemember that those who are thoroughly in love will respect the honor and\r\nvirtue of each other. The purity of woman is doubly attractive, and\r\nsensuality in her becomes doubly offensive and repellent. It is contrary to\r\nthe laws of nature for a man to love a harlot.\r\n\r\n13. A SEDUCER.--The punishment of the seducer is best given by O. S.\r\nFowler, in his \"Creative Science.\" The sin and punishment rest on all you\r\nwho call out only to blight a trusting, innocent, loving virgin's\r\naffections, and then discard her. You deserve to be horsewhipped by her\r\nfather, cowhided by her brothers, branded villain by her mother, cursed by\r\nherself, and sent to the whipping-post and dungeon. {169}\r\n\r\n14. CAUTION.--A young lady should never encourage the attentions of a young\r\nman, who shows no interest in his sisters. If a young man is indifferent to\r\nhis sisters he will become indifferent to his wife as soon as the honey\r\nmoon is over. There are few if any exceptions to this rule. The brother who\r\nwill not be kind and loving in his mother's home will make a very poor\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n15. THE OLD RULE: \"Never marry a man that does not make his mother a\r\nChristmas present every Christmas,\" is a good one. The young lady makes no\r\nmistake in uniting her destinies with the man that loves his mother and\r\nrespects his sisters and brothers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{170}\r\n\r\nSAFE HINTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHINESE BRIDE AND GROOM.]\r\n\r\n1. Marry in your own position in life. If there is any difference in social\r\nposition, it is better that the husband should be the superior. A woman\r\ndoes not like to look down upon her husband, and to be obliged to do so is\r\na poor guarantee for their happiness.\r\n\r\n2. It is best to marry persons of your own faith and religious convictions,\r\nunless one is willing to adopt those of the other. Difference of faith is\r\napt to divide families, and to produce great trouble in after life. A pious\r\nwoman should beware of marrying an irreligious man. {171}\r\n\r\n3. Don't be afraid of marrying a poor man or woman. Good health, cheerful\r\ndisposition, stout hearts and industrious hands will bring happiness and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n4. Bright red hair should marry jet black, and jet black auburn or bright\r\nred, etc. And the more red-faced and bearded or impulsive a man, the more\r\ndark, calm, cool and quiet should his wife be; and vice versa. The florid\r\nshould not marry the florid, but those who are dark, in proportion as they\r\nthemselves are light.\r\n\r\n5. Red-whiskered men should marry brunettes, but no blondes; the color of\r\nthe whiskers being more determinate of the temperament than that of the\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n6. The color of the eyes is still more important. Gray eyes must marry some\r\nother color, almost any other except gray; and so of blue, dark, hazel,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n7. Those very fleshy should not marry those equally so, but those too spare\r\nand slim; and this is doubly true of females. A spare man is much better\r\nadapted to a fleshy woman than a round-favored man. Two who are short,\r\nthick-set and stocky, should not unite in marriage, but should choose those\r\ndifferently constituted; but on no account one of their own make. And, in\r\ngeneral, those predisposed to corpulence are therefore less inclined to\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n8. Those with little hair or beard should marry those whose hair is\r\nnaturally abundant; still those who once had plenty, but who have lost it,\r\nmay marry those who are either bald or have but little; for in this, as in\r\nall other cases, all depends on what one is by nature, little on present\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n9. Those whose motive-temperament decidedly predominates, who are bony,\r\nonly moderately fleshy, quite prominent-featured, Roman-nosed and muscular,\r\nshould not marry those similarly formed.\r\n\r\n10. Small, nervous men must not marry little, nervous or sanguine women,\r\nlest both they and their children have quite too much of the hot-headed and\r\nimpulsive, and die suddenly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Light, Life, Health and Beauty.]\r\n\r\n11. Two very beautiful persons rarely do or should marry; nor two extra\r\nhomely. The fact is a little singular that very handsome women, who of\r\ncourse can have their pick, rarely marry good-looking men, but generally\r\ngive preference to those who are homely; because that {173} exquisiteness\r\nin which beauty originates naturally blends with that power which\r\naccompanies huge noses and disproportionate features.\r\n\r\n12. Rapid movers, speakers, laughers, etc., should marry those who are calm\r\nand deliberate, and impulsives those who are stoical; while those who are\r\nmedium may marry those who are either or neither, as they prefer.\r\n\r\n13. Noses indicate characters by indicating the organisms and temperaments.\r\nAccordingly, those noses especially marked either way should marry those\r\nhaving opposite nasal characteristics. Roman noses are adapted to those\r\nwhich turn up, and pug noses to those turning down; while straight noses\r\nmay marry either.\r\n\r\n14. Men who love to command must be especially careful not to marry\r\nimperious, women's-rights woman; while those who willingly \"obey order;\"\r\nneed just such. Some men require a wife who shall take their part; yet all\r\nwho do not need strong-willed women, should be careful how they marry them.\r\n\r\n15. A sensible woman should not marry an obstinate but injudicious,\r\nunintelligent man; because she cannot long endure to see and help him\r\nblindly follow his poor, but spurn her good, plans.\r\n\r\n16. The reserved or secretive should marry the frank. A cunning man cannot\r\nendure the least artifice in a wife. Those who are non-committal must marry\r\nthose who are demonstrative; else, however much they may love, neither will\r\nfeel sure as to the other's affections, and each will distrust the other,\r\nwhile their children will be deceitful.\r\n\r\n17. A timid woman should never marry a hesitating man, lest, like\r\nfrightened children, each keep perpetually re-alarming the other by\r\nimaginary fears.\r\n\r\n18. An industrious, thrifty, hard-working man should marry a woman\r\ntolerably saving and industrious. As the \"almighty dollar\" is now the great\r\nmotor-wheel of humanity, and that to which most husbands devote their\r\nentire lives, to delve alone is uphill work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{174}\r\n\r\nMarriage Securities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WE MUST PART.]\r\n\r\n1. SEEK EACH OTHER'S HAPPINESS.--A selfish marriage that seeks only its own\r\nhappiness defeats itself. Happiness is a fire that will not burn long on\r\none stick. {175}\r\n\r\n2. DO NOT MARRY SUDDENLY.--It can always be done till it is done, if it is\r\na proper thing to do.\r\n\r\n3. MARRY IN YOUR OWN GRADE IN SOCIETY.--It is painful to be always\r\napologizing for any one. It is more painful to be apologized for.\r\n\r\n4. DO NOT MARRY DOWNWARD.--It is hard enough to advance in the quality of\r\nlife without being loaded with clay heavier than your own. It will be\r\nsufficiently difficult to keep your children up to your best level without\r\nhaving to correct a bias in their blood.\r\n\r\n5. DO NOT SELL YOURSELF.--It matters not whether the price be money or\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n6. DO NOT THROW YOURSELF AWAY.--You will not receive too much, even if you\r\nare paid full price.\r\n\r\n7. SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR PARENTS.--Your parents are your best friends.\r\nThey will make more sacrifice for you than any other mortals. They are\r\nelevated above selfishness concerning you. If they differ from you\r\nconcerning your choice, it is because they must.\r\n\r\n8. DO NOT MARRY TO PLEASE ANY THIRD PARTY.--You must do the living and\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\n9. DO NOT MARRY TO SPITE ANYBODY.--It would add wretchedness to folly.\r\n\r\n10. DO NOT MARRY BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE MAY SEEK THE SAME HAND.--One glove\r\nmay not fit all hands equally well.\r\n\r\n11. DO NOT MARRY TO GET RID OF ANYBODY.--The coward who shot himself to\r\nescape from being drafted was insane.\r\n\r\n12. DO NOT MARRY MERELY FOR THE IMPULSE OF LOVE.--Love is a principle as\r\nwell as an emotion. So far as it is a sentiment it is a blind guide. It\r\ndoes not wait to test the presence of exalted character in its object\r\nbefore breaking out into a flame. Shavings make a hot fire, but hard coal\r\nis better for the Winter.\r\n\r\n13. DO NOT MARRY WITHOUT LOVE.--A body without a soul soon becomes\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n14. TEST CAREFULLY THE EFFECT OF PROTRACTED ASSOCIATION.--If familiarity\r\nbreeds contempt before marriage it will afterward.\r\n\r\n15. TEST CAREFULLY THE EFFECT OF PROTRACTED SEPARATION.--True love will\r\ndefy both time and space.\r\n\r\n16. CONSIDER CAREFULLY the right of your children under the laws of\r\nheredity. It is doubtful whether you have a right to increase the number of\r\ninvalids and cripples.\r\n\r\n17. DO NOT MARRY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE PROMISED TO DO SO.--If a seam\r\nopens between you now it will widen into {176} a gulf. It is less offensive\r\nto retract a mistaken promise than to perjure your soul before the altar.\r\nYour intended spouse has a right to absolute integrity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOING TO BE MARRIED.]\r\n\r\n18. MARRY CHARACTER.--It is not so much what one has as what one is.\r\n\r\n19. DO NOT MARRY THE WRONG OBJECT.--Themistocles said he would rather marry\r\nhis daughter to a man without {177} money than to money without a man. It\r\nis well to have both. It is fatal to have neither.\r\n\r\n20. DEMAND A JUST RETURN.--You give virtue and purity, and gentleness and\r\nintegrity. You have a right to demand the same in return. Duty requires it.\r\n\r\n21. REQUIRE BRAINS.--Culture is good, but will not be transmitted. Brain\r\npower may be.\r\n\r\n22. STUDY PAST RELATIONSHIP.--The good daughter and sister makes a good\r\nwife. The good son and brother makes a good husband.\r\n\r\n23. NEVER MARRY AS A MISSIONARY DEED.--If one needs saving from bad habits\r\nhe is not suitable for you.\r\n\r\n24. MARRIAGE IS A SURE AND SPECIFIC REMEDY for all the ills known as\r\nseminal losses. As right eating cures a sick stomach and right breathing\r\ndiseased lungs, so the right use of the sexual organs will bring relief and\r\nrestoration. Many men who have been sufferers from indiscretions of youth,\r\nhave married, and were soon cured of spermatorrhoea and other complications\r\nwhich accompanied it.\r\n\r\n25. A GOOD, LONG COURTSHIP will often cure many difficulties or ills of the\r\nsexual organs. O. S. Fowler says: \"See each other often spend many pleasant\r\nhours together,\" have many walks and talks, think of each other while\r\nabsent, write many love letters, be inspired to many love feelings and acts\r\ntowards each other, and exercise your sexuality in a thousand forms ten\r\nthousand times, every one of which tones up and thereby recuperates this\r\nvery element now dilapidated. When you have courted long enough to marry,\r\nyou will be sufficiently restored to be reimproved by it. Come,\r\n\r\nUP AND AT IT.--Dress up, spruce up, and be on the alert. Don't wait too\r\nlong to get one much more perfect than you are; but settle on some one\r\nsoon. Remember that your unsexed state renders you over-dainty, and easily\r\ndisgusted. So contemplate only their lovable qualities.\r\n\r\n26. PURITY OF PURPOSE.--Court with a pure and loyal purpose, and when\r\nthoroughly convinced that the disposition of other difficulties are in the\r\nway of a happy marriage life, then _honorably_ discuss it and honorably\r\ntreat each other in the settlement.\r\n\r\n27. DO NOT TRIFLE with the feelings or affections of each other. It is a\r\nsin that will curse you all the days of your life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{178}\r\n\r\nWomen Who Make the Best Wives.\r\n\r\n1. CONSCIOUS OF THE DUTIES OF HER SEX.--A woman conscious of the duties of\r\nher sex, one who unflinchingly discharges the duties allotted to her by\r\nnature, would no doubt make a good wife.\r\n\r\n2. GOOD WIVES AND MOTHERS.--The good wives and mothers are the women who\r\nbelieve in the sisterhood of women as well as in the brotherhood of men.\r\nThe highest exponent of this type seeks to make her home something more\r\nthan an abode where children are fed, clothed and taught the catechism. The\r\nState has taken her children into politics by making their education a\r\nfunction of politicians. The good wife and homemaker says to her children,\r\n\"Where thou goest, I will go.\" She puts off her own inclinations to ease\r\nand selfishness. She studies the men who propose to educate her children;\r\nshe exhorts mothers to sit beside fathers on the school-board; she will\r\neven herself accept such thankless office in the interests of the helpless\r\nyouth of the schools who need a mother's as well as a father's and a\r\nteacher's care in this field of politics.\r\n\r\n3. A BUSY WOMAN.--As to whether a busy woman, that is, a woman who labors\r\nfor mankind in the world outside her home,--whether such an one can also be\r\na good housekeeper, and care for her children, and make a real \"Home, Sweet\r\nHome!\" with all the comforts by way of variation, why! I am ready, as the\r\nresult of years practical experience as a busy woman, to assert that women\r\nof affairs can also be women of true domestic tastes and habits.\r\n\r\n4. BRAINY ENOUGH.--What kind of women make the best wives? The woman who is\r\nbrainy enough to be a companion, wise enough to be a counsellor, skilled\r\nenough in the domestic virtues to be a good housekeeper, and loving enough\r\nto guide in true paths the children with whom the home may be blessed.\r\n\r\n5. FOUND THE RIGHT HUSBAND.--The best wife is the woman who has found the\r\nright husband, a husband who understands her. A man will have the best wife\r\nwhen he rates that wife as queen among women. Of all women she should\r\nalways be to him the dearest. This sort of man will not only praise the\r\ndishes made by his wife, but will actually eat them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUNISHMENT OF WIFE BEATERS IN NEW ENGLAND IN THE EARLY\r\nDAYS.]\r\n\r\n6. BANK ACCOUNT.--He will allow his life-companion a bank account, and will\r\nexact no itemized bill at the end of the month. Above all, he will pay the\r\nEaster bonnet bill without a word, never bring a friend to dinner without\r\nfirst telephoning home,--short, he will comprehend that the {180} woman who\r\nmakes the best wife is the woman whom, by his indulgence of her ways and\r\nwhims, he makes the best wife. So after all, good husbands have the most to\r\ndo with making good wives.\r\n\r\n7. BEST HOME MAKER.--A woman to be the best home maker needs to be devoid\r\nof intensive \"nerves.\" She must be neat and systematic, but not too neat,\r\nlest she destroy the comfort she endeavors to create. She must be\r\ndistinctly amiable, while firm. She should have no \"career,\" or desire for\r\na career, if she would fill to perfection the home sphere. She must be\r\naffectionate, sympathetic and patient, and fully appreciative of the worth\r\nand dignity of her sphere.\r\n\r\n8. KNOW NOTHING WHATSOEVER ABOUT COOKING OR SEWING OR HOUSEKEEPING.--I am\r\ninclined to make my answer to this question somewhat concise, after the\r\nmanner of a text without the sermon. Like this: To be the \"best wife\"\r\ndepends upon three things: first, an abiding faith with God; second, duty\r\nlovingly discharged as daughter, wife and mother; third, self-improvement,\r\nmentally, physically, spiritually. With this as a text and as a glittering\r\ngenerality, let me touch upon one or two practical essentials. In the\r\ncourse of every week it is my privilege to meet hundreds of young\r\nwomen,--prospective wives. I am astonished to find that many of these know\r\nnothing whatsoever about cooking or sewing or housekeeping. Now, if a woman\r\ncannot broil a beefsteak, nor boil the coffee when it is necessary, if she\r\ncannot mend the linen, nor patch a coat, if she cannot make a bed, order\r\nthe dinner, create a lamp-shade, ventilate the house, nor do anything\r\npractical in the way of making home actually a home, how can she expect to\r\nmake even a good wife, not to speak of a better or best wife? I need not\r\ncontinue this sermon. Wise girls will understand.\r\n\r\n9. THE BEST KEEPER OF HOME.--As to who is the best keeper of this\r\ntransition home, memory pictures to me a woman grown white under the old\r\nslavery, still bound by it, in that little-out-of-the-way Kansas town, but\r\nnever so bound that she could not put aside household tasks, at any time,\r\nfor social intercourse, for religious conversation, for correspondence, for\r\nreading, and, above all, for making everyone who came near her feel that\r\nher home was the expression of herself, a place for rest, study, and the\r\ncultivation of affection. She did not exist for her walls, her carpets, her\r\nfurniture; they existed for her and all who came to her. She considered\r\nherself the equal of all; and everyone else thought her the superior of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{181}\r\n\r\nAdaptation, Conjugal Affection, and Fatal Errors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADVICE TO THE MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.\r\n\r\n1. MARRYING FOR WEALTH.--Those who marry for wealth often get what they\r\nmarry and nothing else; for rich girls, besides being generally destitute\r\nof both industry and economy, are generally extravagant in their\r\nexpenditures, and require servants enough to dissipate a fortune. They\r\ngenerally have insatiable wants, yet feel that they deserve to be indulged\r\nin everything, because they placed their husbands under obligation to them\r\nby bringing them a dowry. And then the mere idea of living on the money of\r\na wife, and of being supported by her, is enough to tantalize any man of an\r\nindependent spirit.\r\n\r\n2. SELF-SUPPORT.--What spirited husband would not prefer to support both\r\nhimself and wife, rather than submit to this perpetual bondage of\r\nobligation. To live upon a father, or take a patrimony from him, is quite\r\nbad enough; but to run in debt to a wife, and owe her a living, is a little\r\ntoo aggravating for endurance, especially if there be not perfect\r\ncordiality between the two, which cannot be the case in money matches.\r\nBetter live wifeless, or anything else, rather than marry for money.\r\n\r\n3. MONEY-SEEKERS.--Shame on sordid wife-seekers, or, rather, money-seekers;\r\nfor it is not a wife that they seek, but only filthy lucre! They violate\r\nall their other faculties simply to gratify miserly desire. Verily such\r\n\"have their reward\"!\r\n\r\n4. THE PENITENT HOUR.--And to you, young ladies, let me say with great\r\nemphasis, that those who court and marry you because you are rich, will\r\nmake you rue the day of your pecuniary espousals. They care not for you,\r\nbut only your money, and when they get that, will be liable to neglect or\r\nabuse you, and probably squander it, leaving you destitute and abandoning\r\nyou to your fate.\r\n\r\n5. INDUSTRY THE SIGN OF NOBILITY.--Marry a working, industrious young lady,\r\nwhose constitution is strong, flesh solid, and health unimpaired by\r\nconfinement, bad habits, or late hours. Give me a plain, home-spun farmer's\r\ndaughter, and you may have all the rich and fashionable belles of our\r\ncities and villages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ILL-MATED COUPLE.]\r\n\r\n6. WASP WAISTS.--Marrying small waists is attended with consequences\r\nscarcely less disastrous than marrying {183} rich and fashionable girls. An\r\namply developed chest is a sure indication of a naturally vigorous\r\nconstitution and a strong hold on life; while small waists indicate small\r\nand feeble vital organs, a delicate constitution, sickly offspring, and a\r\nshort life. Beware of them, therefore, unless you wish your heart broken by\r\nthe early death of your wife and children.\r\n\r\n7. MARRYING TALKERS.--In marrying a wit or a talker merely, though the\r\nbrilliant scintillations of the former, or the garrulity of the latter, may\r\namuse or delight you for the time being, yet you will derive no permanent\r\nsatisfaction from these qualities, for there will be no common bond of\r\nkindred feeling to assimilate your souls and hold each spell-bound at the\r\nshrine of the other's intellectual or moral excellence.\r\n\r\n8. THE SECOND WIFE.--Many men, especially in choosing a second wife, are\r\ngoverned by her own qualifications as a housekeeper mainly, and marry\r\nindustry and economy. Though these traits of character are excellent, yet a\r\ngood housekeeper may be far from being a good wife. A good housekeeper, but\r\na poor wife, may indeed prepare you a good dinner, and keep her house and\r\nchildren neat and tidy, yet this is but a part of the office of a wife;\r\nwho, besides all her household duties, has those of a far higher order to\r\nperform. She should soothe you with her sympathies, divert your troubled\r\nmind, and make the whole family happy by the gentleness of her manners, and\r\nthe native goodness of her heart. A husband should also likewise do his\r\npart.\r\n\r\n9. DO NOT MARRY A MAN WITH A LOW, FLAT HEAD; for, however fascinating,\r\ngenteel, polite, tender, plausible or winning he may be, you will repent\r\nthe day of your espousal.\r\n\r\n10. HEALTHY WIVES AND MOTHERS.--Let girls romp, and let them range hill and\r\ndale in search of flowers, berries, or any other object of amusement or\r\nattraction; let them bathe often, skip the rope, and take a smart ride on\r\nhorseback; often interspersing these amusements with a turn of sweeping or\r\nwashing, in order thereby to develop their vital organs, and thus lay a\r\nsubstantial physical foundation for becoming good wives and mothers. The\r\nwildest romps usually make the best wives, while quiet, still, demure,\r\nsedate and sedentary girls are not worth having.\r\n\r\n11. SMALL STATURE.--In passing, I will just remark, that good size is\r\nimportant in wives and mothers. A small stature is objectionable in a\r\nwoman, because little women {184} usually have too much activity for their\r\nstrength, and, consequently, feeble constitutions; hence they die young,\r\nand besides, being nervous, suffer extremely as mothers.\r\n\r\n12. HARD TIMES AND MATRIMONY.--Many persons, particularly young men, refuse\r\nto marry, especially \"these hard times,\" because they cannot support a wife\r\nin the style they wish. To this I reply, that a good wife will care less\r\nfor the style in which she is supported, than for you. She will cheerfully\r\nconform to your necessities, and be happy with you in a log-cabin. She will\r\neven help you support yourself. To support a good wife, even if she have\r\nchildren, is really less expensive than to board alone, besides being one\r\nof the surest means of acquiring property.\r\n\r\n13. MARRYING FOR A HOME.--Do not, however, marry for a home merely, unless\r\nyou wish to become even more destitute with one than without one; for, it\r\nis on the same footing with \"marrying for money.\" Marry a man for his\r\nmerit, and you take no chances.\r\n\r\n14. MARRY TO PLEASE NO ONE BUT YOURSELF.--Marriage is a matter exclusively\r\nyour own; because you alone must abide its consequences. No person, not\r\neven a parent, has the least right to interfere or dictate in this matter.\r\nI never knew a marriage, made to please another, to turn out any otherwise\r\nthan most unhappily.\r\n\r\n15. DO NOT MARRY TO PLEASE YOUR PARENTS. Parents cannot love for their\r\nchildren any more than they can eat or sleep, or breathe, or die and go to\r\nheaven for them. They may give wholesome advice merely, but should leave\r\nthe entire decision to the unbiased judgment of the parties themselves, who\r\nmainly are to experience the consequences of their choice. Besides, such is\r\nhuman nature, that to oppose lovers, or to speak against the person\r\nbeloved, only increases their desire and determination to marry.\r\n\r\n16. RUN-AWAY MATCHES.--Many a run-away match would never have taken place\r\nbut for opposition or interference. Parents are mostly to be blamed for\r\nthese elopements. Their children marry partly out of spite and to be\r\ncontrary. Their very natures tell them that this interference is unjust--as\r\nit really is--and this excites combativeness, firmness, and self-esteem, in\r\ncombination with the social faculties, to powerful and even blind\r\nresistance--which turmoil of the faculties hastens the match. Let the\r\naffections of a daughter be once slightly enlisted in your favor, and then\r\nlet the \"old folks\" start an opposition, and you may feel sure of your\r\nprize. If she did not love you before, she will now, that you are\r\npersecuted. {185}\r\n\r\n17. DISINHERITANCE.--Never disinherit, or threaten to disinherit, a child\r\nfor marrying against your will. If you wish a daughter not to marry a\r\ncertain man, oppose her, and she will be sure to marry him; so also in\r\nreference to a son.\r\n\r\n18. PROPER TRAINING.--The secret is, however, all in a nutshell. Let the\r\nfather properly train his daughter, and she will bring her first\r\nlove-letter to him, and give him an opportunity to cherish a suitable\r\naffection, and to nip an improper one in the germ, before it has time to do\r\nany harm.\r\n\r\n19. THE FATAL MISTAKES OF PARENTS.--_There is, however, one way of\r\neffectually preventing an improper match, and that is, not to allow your\r\nchildren to associate with any whom you are unwilling they should marry.\r\nHow cruel as well as unjust, to allow a daughter to associate with a young\r\nman till the affections of both are riveted, and then forbid her marrying\r\nhim. Forbid all association or consent cheerfully to the marriage._\r\n\r\n20. AN INTEMPERATE LOVER.--Do not flatter yourselves, young women, that you\r\ncan wean even an occasional wine drinker from his cups by love and\r\npersuasion. Ardent spirit at first, kindles up the fires of love into the\r\nfierce flames at burning licentiousness, which burn out every element of\r\nlove and destroy every vestige of pure affection. It over-excites the\r\npassions, and thereby finally destroys it,--producing at first, unbridled\r\nlibertinism, and then an utter barrenness of love; besides reversing the\r\nother faculties of the drinker against his own consort, and those of the\r\nwife against her drinking husband.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LOVE, DESERTION AND DIVORCE.\r\n\r\n1. FIRST LOVE.--This is the most important direction of all. The first love\r\nexperiences a tenderness, a purity and unreservedness, an exquisiteness, a\r\ndevotedness, and a poetry belonging to no subsequent attachment. \"Love,\r\nlike life, has no second spring.\" Though a second attachment may be\r\naccompanied by high moral feeling, and to a devotedness to the object\r\nloved; yet, let love be checked or blighted in its first pure emotion, and\r\nthe beauty of its spring is irrecoverably withered and lost. This does not\r\nmean the simple love of children in the first attachment they call love,\r\nbut rather the mature intelligent love of those of suitable age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSIDERING THE QUESTION.]\r\n\r\n{187}\r\n\r\n2. FREE FROM TEMPTATIONS.--As long as his heart is bound up in its first\r\nbundle of love and devotedness--as long as his affections remain\r\nreciprocated and uninterrupted--so long temptations cannot take effect. His\r\nheart is callous to the charms of others, and the very idea of bestowing\r\nhis affections upon another is abhorrent. Much more so is animal\r\nindulgence, which is morally impossible.\r\n\r\n3. SECOND LOVE NOT CONSTANT.--But let this first love be broken off, and\r\nthe flood-gates of passion are raised. Temptations now flow in upon him. He\r\ncasts a lustful eye upon every passing female, and indulges unchaste\r\nimaginations and feelings. Although his conscientiousness or intellect may\r\nprevent actual indulgence, yet temptations now take effect, and render him\r\nliable to err; whereas before they had no power to awaken improper thoughts\r\nor feelings. Thus many young men find their ruin.\r\n\r\n4. LEGAL MARRIAGE.--What would any woman give for merely a nominal or legal\r\nhusband, just to live with and provide for her, but who entertained not one\r\nspark of love for her, or whose affections were bestowed upon another? How\r\nabsurd, how preposterous the doctrine that the obligations of marriage\r\nderive their sacredness from legal enactments and injunctions! How it\r\nliterally profanes this holy of holies, and drags down this heaven-born\r\ninstitution from its original, divine elevation, to the level of a merely\r\nhuman device. Who will dare to advocate the human institution of marriage\r\nwithout the warm heart of a devoted and loving companion!\r\n\r\n5. LEGISLATION.--But no human legislation can so guard this institution but\r\nthat it may be broken in spirit, though, perhaps, acceded to in form; for,\r\nit is the heart which this institution requires. There must be true and\r\ndevoted affection, or marriage is a farce and a failure.\r\n\r\n6. THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY AND THE LAW GOVERNING MARRIAGE are for the\r\nprotection of the individual, yet a man and woman may be married by law and\r\nyet unmarried in spirit. The law may tie together, and no marriage be\r\nconsummated. Marriage therefore is Divine, and \"whom God hath joined\r\ntogether let no man put asunder.\" A right marriage means a right state of\r\nthe heart. A careful study of this work will be a great help to both the\r\nunmarried and the married.\r\n\r\n7. DESERTION AND DIVORCE.--For a young man to court a young woman, and\r\nexcite her love till her affections are riveted, and then (from sinister\r\nmotives, such as, to marry one richer, or more handsome), to leave her, and\r\ntry {188} elsewhere, is the very same crime as to divorce her from all that\r\nshe holds dear on earth--to root up and pull out her imbedded affections,\r\nand to tear her from her rightful husband. First love is always constant.\r\nThe second love brings uncertainty--too often desertions before marriage\r\nand divorces after marriage.\r\n\r\n8. THE COQUET.--The young woman to play the coquet, and sport with the\r\nsincere affections of an honest and devoted young man, is one of the\r\nhighest crimes that human nature can commit. Better murder him in body too,\r\nas she does in soul and morals, and it is the result of previous\r\ndisappointment, never the outcome of a sincere first love.\r\n\r\n9. ONE MARRIAGE. One evidence that second marriages are contrary to the\r\nlaws of our social nature, is the fact that almost all step-parents and\r\nstep-children disagree. Now, what law has been broken, to induce this\r\npenalty? The law of marriage; and this is one of the ways in which the\r\nbreach punishes itself. It is much more in accordance with our natural\r\nfeelings, especially those of mothers, that children should be brought up\r\nby their own parent.\r\n\r\n10. SECOND MARRIAGE.--Another proof of this point is, that second marriage\r\nis more a matter of business. \"I'll give you a home, if you'll take care of\r\nmy children.\" \"It's a bargain,\" is the way most second matches are made.\r\nThere is little of the poetry of first-love, and little of the coyness and\r\nshrinking diffidence which characterize the first attachment. Still these\r\nremarks apply almost equally to a second attachment, as to second marriage.\r\n\r\n11. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--Let this portion be read and\r\npondered, and also the one entitled, \"Marry your First Love if possible,\"\r\nwhich assigns the cause, and points out the only remedy, of licentiousness.\r\nAs long as the main cause of this vice exists, and is aggravated by\r\npurse-proud, high-born, aristocratic parents and friends, and even by the\r\nvirtuous and religious, just so long, and exactly in the same ratio will\r\nthis blighting Sirocco blast the fairest flowers of female innocence and\r\nlovliness, and blight our noblest specimens of manliness. No sin of our\r\nland is greater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{189} [Illustration: CUPID'S CHARM.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{190}\r\n\r\nFlirting and Its Dangers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW MANY YOUNG GIRLS ARE RUINED.]\r\n\r\n1. NO EXCUSE.--In this country there is no excuse for the young man who\r\nseeks the society of the loose and the dissolute. There is at all times and\r\neverywhere open to him a society of persons of the opposite sex of his own\r\nage and of pure thoughts and lives, whose conversation will refine him and\r\ndrive from his bosom ignoble and impure thoughts.\r\n\r\n2. THE DANGERS.--The young man who may take pleasure in the fact that he is\r\nthe hero of half a dozen or more {191} engagements and love episodes,\r\nlittle realizes that such constant excitement often causes not only\r\ndangerously frequent and long-continued nocturnal emissions, but most\r\npainful affections of the testicles. Those who show too great familiarity\r\nwith the other sex, who entertain lascivious thoughts, continually exciting\r\nthe sexual desires, always suffer a weakening of power and sometimes the\r\nactual diseases of degeneration, chronic inflammation of the gland,\r\nspermatorrhoea, impotence, and the like.--Young man, beware; your\r\npunishment for trifling with the affections of others may cost you a life\r\nof affliction.\r\n\r\n3. REMEDY.--Do not violate the social laws. Do not trifle with the\r\naffections of your nature. Do not give others countless anguish, and also\r\ndo not run the chances of injuring yourself and others for life. The\r\nsociety of refined and pure women is one of the strongest safeguards a\r\nyoung man can have, and he who seeks it will not only find satisfaction,\r\nbut happiness. Simple friendship and kind affections for each other will\r\nennoble and benefit.\r\n\r\n4. THE TIME FOR MARRIAGE.--When a young man's means permit him to marry, he\r\nshould then look intelligently for her with whom he expects to pass the\r\nremainder of his life in perfect loyalty, and in sincerity and singleness\r\nof heart. Seek her to whom he is ready to swear to be ever true.\r\n\r\n5. BREACH OF CONFIDENCE.--Nothing is more certain, says Dr. Naphey, to\r\nundermine domestic felicity, and sap the foundation of marital happiness,\r\nthan marital infidelity. The risks of disease which a married man runs in\r\nimpure intercourse are far more serious, because they not only involve\r\nhimself, but his wife and his children. He should know that there is\r\nnothing which a woman will not forgive sooner than such a breach of\r\nconfidence. He is exposed to the plots and is pretty certain sooner or\r\nlater to fall into the snares of those atrocious parties who subsist on\r\nblackmail. And should he escape these complications, he still must lose\r\nself-respect, and carry about with him the burden of a guilty conscience\r\nand a broken vow.\r\n\r\n6. SOCIETY RULES AND CUSTOMS.--A young man can enjoy the society of ladies\r\nwithout being a \"flirt.\" He can escort ladies to parties, public places of\r\ninterest, social gatherings, etc., without showing special devotion to any\r\none special young lady. When he finds the choice of his heart, then he will\r\nbe justified to manifest it, and publicly proclaim it by paying her the\r\ncompliment, exclusive attention. To keep a lady's company six months is a\r\npublic announcement of an engagement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{192}\r\n\r\nA Word to Maidens.\r\n\r\n1. NO YOUNG LADY who is not willing to assume the responsibility of a true\r\nwife, and be crowned with the sacred diadem of motherhood, should ever\r\nthink of getting married. We have too many young ladies to-day who despise\r\nmaternity, who openly vow that they will never be burdened with children,\r\nand yet enter matrimony at the first opportunity. What is the result? Let\r\necho answer, What? Unless a young lady believes that motherhood is noble,\r\nis honorable, is divine, and she is willing to carry out that sacred\r\nfunction of her nature, she had a thousand times better refuse every\r\nproposal, and enter some honorable occupation and wisely die an old maid by\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n2. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOUNG LADY, never enter into the physical relations\r\nof marriage with a man until you have conversed with him freely and fully\r\non these relations. Learn distinctly his views and feelings and\r\nexpectations in regard to that purest and most ennobling of all the\r\nfunctions of your nature, and the most sacred of all intimacies of conjugal\r\nlove. Your self-respect, your beauty, your glory, your heaven, as a wife,\r\nwill be more directly involved in his feelings and views and practices, in\r\nregard to that relation, than in all other things. As you would not become\r\na weak, miserable, imbecile, unlovable and degraded wife and mother, in the\r\nvery prime of your life, come to a perfect understanding with your chosen\r\none, ere you commit your person to his keeping in the sacred intimacies of\r\nhome. Beware of that man who, under pretence of delicacy, modesty, and\r\npropriety, shuns conversation with you on this relation, and on the\r\nhallowed function of maternity.\r\n\r\n3. TALK WITH YOUR INTENDED frankly and openly. Remember, concealment and\r\nmystery in him, towards you, on all other subjects pertaining to conjugal\r\nunion might be overlooked, but if he conceals his views here, rest assured\r\nit bodes no good to your purity and happiness as a wife and mother. You can\r\nhave no more certain assurance that you are to be victimized, your soul and\r\nbody offered up, _slain_, on the altar of his sensualism, than his\r\nunwillingness to converse with you on subjects so vital to your happiness.\r\nUnless he is willing to hold his manhood in abeyance to the calls of your\r\nnature and to your conditions, and consecrate its passions and its powers\r\nto the elevation and happiness of his wife and children, your maiden soul\r\nhad better return to God unadorned with the diadem of conjugal and maternal\r\nlove than that you should become the wife of such a man and the mother of\r\nhis children. {193}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN LOVE MAKING.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{194}\r\n\r\nPOPPING THE QUESTION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Uniformed Men are always Popular with the Ladies.]\r\n\r\n1. MAKING THE DECLARATION.--There are few emergencies in business and few\r\nevents in life that bring to man the trying ordeal of \"proposing to a\r\nlady.\" We should be glad to help the bashful lover in his hours of\r\nperplexity, embarrassment and hesitation, but unfortunately we cannot pop\r\nthe question for him, nor give him a formula by which {195} he may do it.\r\nDifferent circumstances and different surroundings compel every lover to be\r\noriginal in his form or mode of proposing.\r\n\r\n2. BASHFULNESS.--If a young man is very bashful, he should write his\r\nsentiments in a clear, frank manner on a neat white sheet of note paper,\r\nenclose it in a plain white envelope and find some way to convey it to the\r\nlady's hand.\r\n\r\n3. THE ANSWER.--If the beloved one's heart is touched, and she is in\r\nsympathy with the lover, the answer should be frankly and unequivocally\r\ngiven. If the negative answer is necessary, it should be done in the\r\nkindest and most sympathetic language, yet definite, positive and to the\r\npoint, and the gentleman should at once withdraw his suit and continue\r\nfriendly but not familiar.\r\n\r\n4. SAYING \"NO\" FOR \"YES.\"--If girls are foolish enough to say \"No\" when\r\nthey mean \"Yes,\" they must suffer the consequences which often follow. A\r\nman of intelligence and self-respect will not ask a lady twice. It is\r\nbegging for recognition and lowers his dignity, should he do so. A lady is\r\nsupposed to know her heart sufficiently to consider the question to her\r\nsatisfaction before giving an answer.\r\n\r\n5. CONFUSION OF WORDS AND MISUNDERSTANDING.--Sometimes a man's happiness,\r\nhas depended on his manner of popping the question. Many a time the girl\r\nhas said \"No\" because the question was so worded that the affirmative did\r\nnot come from the mouth naturally; and two lives that gravitated toward\r\neach other with all their inward force have been thrown suddenly apart,\r\nbecause the electric keys were not carefully touched.\r\n\r\n6. SCRIPTURAL DECLARATION.--The church is not the proper place to conduct a\r\ncourtship, yet the following is suggestive and ingenious.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman, familiar with the Scriptures, happening to sit in a pew\r\nadjoining a young lady for whom he conceived a violent attachment, made his\r\nproposal in this way: He politely handed his neighbor a Bible open, with a\r\npin stuck in the following text: Second Epistle of John, verse 5:\r\n\r\n\"And I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto\r\nthee, but that we had from the beginning, that we love one another.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEALING THE ENGAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nFrom the Most Celebrated Painting in the German Department at the World's\r\nFair.]\r\n\r\nShe returned it, pointing to the second chapter of Ruth, verse 10: \"Then\r\nshe fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him.\r\nWhy have I found grace in {197} thine eyes that thou shouldest take\r\nknowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?\"\r\n\r\nHe returned the book, pointing to the 13th verse of the Third Epistle of\r\nJohn: \"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write to you with\r\npaper and ink, but trust to come unto you and speak face to face, that your\r\njoy may be full.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the above interview a marriage took place the ensuing month in the\r\nsame church.\r\n\r\n7. HOW JENNY WAS WON.\r\n\r\n  On a sunny Summer morning,\r\n  Early as the dew was dry,\r\n  Up the hill I went a berrying;\r\n  Need I tell you--tell you why?\r\n\r\n  Farmer Davis had a daughter,\r\n  And it happened that I knew,\r\n  On each sunny morning, Jenny\r\n  Up the hill went berrying too.\r\n\r\n  Lonely work is picking berries,\r\n  So I joined her on the hill:\r\n \"Jenny, dear,\" said I, \"your basket's\r\n  Quite too large for one to fill.\"\r\n\r\n  So we stayed--we two--to fill it,\r\n  Jenny talking--I was still.--\r\n  Leading where the hill was steepest,\r\n  Picking berries up the hill.\r\n\r\n \"This is up-hill work,\" said Jenny;\r\n \"So is life,\" said I; \"shall we\r\n  Climb it each alone, or, Jenny,\r\n  Will you come and climb with me?\"\r\n\r\n  Redder than the blushing berries\r\n  Jenny's cheek a moment grew,\r\n  While without delay she answered,\r\n \"I will come and climb with you.\"\r\n\r\n{198}\r\n\r\n8. A ROMANTIC WAY FOR PROPOSING.--In Peru they have a romantic way of\r\npopping the question. The suitor appears on the appointed evening, with a\r\ngaily dressed troubadour, under the balcony of his beloved. The singer\r\nsteps before her flower-bedecked window, and sings her beauties in the name\r\nof her lover. He compares her size to that of a pear-tree, her lips to two\r\nblushing rose-buds, and her womanly form to that of a dove. With assumed\r\nharshness the lady asks her lover: \"Who are you, and what do you want?\" He\r\nanswers with ardent confidence: \"Thy love I do adore, The stars live in the\r\nharmony of love, and why should not we, too, love each other?\" Then the\r\nproud beauty gives herself away: she takes her flower-wreath from her hair\r\nand throws it down to her lover, promising to be his forever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PERUVIAN BEAUTY.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{199}\r\n\r\nThe Wedding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRIDE.]\r\n\r\n1. THE PROPER TIME.--Much has been printed in various volumes regarding the\r\ntime of the year, the influence of the seasons, etc., as determining the\r\nproper time to set for the wedding day. Circumstances must govern these\r\nthings. To be sure, it is best to avoid extremes of heat and cold. Very hot\r\nweather is debilitating, and below zero is uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n2. THE LADY SHOULD SELECT THE DAY.--There is one element in the time that\r\nis of great importance, physically, especially to the lady. It is the day\r\nof the month, and it is hoped that every lady who contemplates marriage is\r\ninformed upon the great facts of ovulation. By reading page {200} 245 she\r\nwill understand that it is to her advantage to select a wedding day about\r\nfifteen or eighteen days after the close of menstruation in the month\r\nchosen, since it is not best that the first child should be conceived\r\nduring the excitement or irritation of first attempts at congress; besides\r\nmodest brides naturally do not wish to become large with child before the\r\nseason of congratulation and visiting on their return from the \"wedding\r\ntour\" is over.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is asserted by many of the best writers on this subject, that the\r\nmental condition of either parent at the time of intercourse will be\r\nstamped upon the embryo; hence it is not only best, but wise, that the\r\nfirst-born should not be conceived until several months after marriage,\r\nwhen the husband and wife have nicely settled in their new home, and become\r\ncalm in their experience of each other's society.\r\n\r\n3. THE \"BRIDAL TOUR\" is considered by many newly-married couples as a\r\nnecessary introduction to a life of connubial joy. There is, in our\r\nopinion, nothing in the custom to recommend it. After the excitement and\r\noverwork before and accompanying a wedding, the period immediately\r\nfollowing should be one of _rest_.\r\n\r\nAgain, the money expended on the ceremony and a tour of the principal\r\ncities, etc., might, in most cases, be applied to a multitude of after-life\r\ncomforts of far more lasting value and importance. To be sure, it is not\r\npleasant for the bride, should she remain at home, to pass through the\r\nordeal of criticism and vulgar comments of acquaintances and friends, and\r\nhence, to escape this, the young couple feel like getting away for a time.\r\nUndoubtedly the best plan for the great majority, after this most eventful\r\nceremony, is to enter their future home at once, and there to remain in\r\ncomparative privacy until the novelty of the situation is worn off.\r\n\r\n4. IF THE CONVENTIONAL TOUR is taken, the husband should remember that his\r\nbride cannot stand the same amount of tramping around and sight-seeing that\r\nhe can. The female organs of generation are so easily affected by excessive\r\nexercise of the limbs which support them, that at this critical period it\r\nwould be a foolish and costly experience to drag a lady hurriedly around\r\nthe country on an extensive and protracted round of sight-seeing or\r\nvisiting. Unless good common-sense is displayed in the manner of spending\r\nthe \"honey-moon,\" it will prove very untrue to its name. In many cases it\r\nlays the foundation for the wife's first and life-long \"backache.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{201}\r\n\r\nAdvice to Newly Married Couples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HONEY-MOON.]\r\n\r\n1. \"BE YE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY\" is a Bible commandment which the children\r\nof men habitually obey. However they may disagree on other subjects, all\r\nare in accord on this; the barbarous, the civilized, the high, the low, the\r\nfierce, the gentle--all unite in the desire which finds its accomplishment\r\nin the reproduction of their kind. Who {202} shall quarrel with the\r\nDivinely implanted instinct, or declare it to be vulgar or unmentionable?\r\nIt is during the period of the honeymoon that the intensity of this desire,\r\ncoupled with the greatest curiosity, is at its height, and the unbridled\r\nlicense often given the passions at this time is attended with the most\r\ndangerous consequences.\r\n\r\n2. CONSUMMATION OF MARRIAGE.--The first time that the husband and wife\r\ncohabit together after the ceremony has been performed is called the\r\nconsummation of marriage. Many grave errors have been committed by people\r\nin this, when one or both of the contracting parties were not physically or\r\nsexually in a condition to carry out the marriage relation. A marriage,\r\nhowever, is complete without this in the eyes of the law, as it is a maxim\r\ntaken from the Roman civil statutes that consent, not cohabitation, is the\r\nbinding element in the ceremony. Yet, in most States of the U.S., and in\r\nsome other countries; marriage is legally declared void and of no effect\r\nwhere it is not possible to consummate the marriage relation. A divorce may\r\nbe obtained provided the injured party begins the suit.\r\n\r\n3. TEST OF VIRGINITY.--The consummation of marriage with a virgin is not\r\nnecessarily attended with a flow of blood, and the absence of this sign is\r\nnot the slightest presumption against her former chastity. The true test of\r\nvirginity is modesty void of any disagreeable familiarity. A sincere\r\nChristian faith is one of the best recommendations.\r\n\r\n4. LET EVERY MAN REMEMBER that the legal right of marriage does not carry\r\nwith it the moral right to injure for life the loving companion he has\r\nchosen. Ignorance may be the cause, but every man before he marries should\r\nknow something of the physiology and the laws of health, and we here give\r\nsome information which is of very great importance to every newly-married\r\nman.\r\n\r\n5. SENSUALITY.--Lust crucifies love. The young sensual husband is generally\r\nat fault. Passion sways and the duty to bride and wife is nor thought of,\r\nand so a modest young wife is often actually forced and assaulted by the\r\nunsympathetic haste of her husband. An amorous man in that way soon\r\ndestroys his own love, and thus is laid the foundation for many\r\ndifficulties that soon develop trouble and disturb the happiness of both.\r\n\r\n6. ABUSE AFTER MARRIAGE.--Usually marriage is consummated within a day or\r\ntwo after the ceremony, but this is {203} gross injustice to the bride. In\r\nmost cases she is nervous, timid, and exhausted by the duties of\r\npreparation for the wedding, and in no way in a condition, either in body\r\nor mind, for the vital change which the married relation bring upon her.\r\nMany a young husband often lays the foundation of many diseases of the womb\r\nand of the nervous system in gratifying his unchecked passions without a\r\nproper regard for his wife's exhausted condition.\r\n\r\n7. THE FIRST CONJUGAL APPROACHES are usually painful to the new wife, and\r\nno enjoyment to her follows. Great caution and kindness should be\r\nexercised. A young couple rushing together in their animal passion soon\r\nproduce a nervous and irritating condition which ere long brings apathy,\r\nindifference, if not dislike. True love and a high regard for each other\r\nwill temper passion into moderation.\r\n\r\n8. WERE THE ABOVE INJUNCTIONS HEEDED fully and literally it would be folly\r\nto say more, but this would be omitting all account of the bridegroom's new\r\nposition, the power of his passion, and the timidity of the fair creature\r\nwho is wondering what fate has in store for her trembling modesty. To be\r\nsure, there are some women who are possessed of more forward natures and\r\nstronger desires than others. In such cases there may be less trouble.\r\n\r\n9. A COMMON ERROR.--The young husband may have read in some treatise on\r\nphysiology that the hymen in a virgin is the great obstacle to be overcome.\r\nHe is apt to conclude that this is all, that some force will be needed to\r\nbreak it down, and that therefore an amount of urgency even to the degree\r\nof inflicting considerable pain is justifiable. This is usually wrong. It\r\nrarely constitutes any obstruction, and, even when its rupturing may be\r\nnecessary, it alone seldom causes suffering.\r\n\r\nThere are sometimes certain deformities of the vagina, but no woman should\r\nknowingly seek matrimonial relations when thus afflicted.\r\n\r\nWe quote from Dr. C. A. Huff the following:\r\n\r\n10. \"WHAT IS IT, THEN, THAT USUALLY CAUSES distress to many women, whether\r\na bride or a long-time wife?\" The answer is, Simply those conditions of the\r\norgans in which they are not properly prepared, by anticipation and desire,\r\nto receive a foreign body. The modest one craves only refined and platonic\r\nlove at first, and if husbands, new and old, would only realize this plain\r\ntruth, wife-torturing would cease and the happiness of each one of all\r\nhuman pairs vastly increase. {204}\r\n\r\n11. THE CONDITIONS OF THE FEMALE organs depend upon the state of the mind\r\njust as much as in the case of the husband. The male, however, being more\r\nsensual, is more quickly roused. She is far less often or early ready. In\r\nits unexcited state the vagina is lax, its walls are closed together, and\r\ntheir surfaces covered by but little lubricating secretion. The chaster one\r\nof the pair has no desire that this sacred vestibule to the great arcana of\r\nprocreation shall be immediately and roughly invaded. This, then, is the\r\ntime for all approaches by the husband to be of the most delicate,\r\nconsiderate, and refined description possible. The quietest and softest\r\ndemeanor, with gentle and re-assuring words, are all that should be\r\nattempted at first. The wedding day has probably been one of fatigue, and\r\nit is foolish to go farther.\r\n\r\n12. FOR MORE THAN ONE NIGHT it will be wise, indeed, if the wife's\r\nconfidence shall be as much wooed and won by patient, delicate, and\r\nprolonged courting, as before the marriage engagement. How long should this\r\nperiod of waiting be can only be decided by the circumstances of any case.\r\nThe bride will ultimately deny no favor which is sought with full deference\r\nto her modesty, and in connection with which bestiality is not exhibited.\r\nHer nature is that of delicacy; her affection is of a refined character; if\r\nthe love and conduct offered to her are a careful effort to adapt roughness\r\nand strength to her refinement and weakness, her admiration and responsive\r\nlove will be excited to the utmost.\r\n\r\n13. WHEN THAT MOMENT ARRIVES when the bride finds she can repose perfect\r\nconfidence in the kindness of her husband, that his love is not purely\r\nanimal, and that no violence will be attempted, the power of her affection\r\nfor him will surely assert itself; the mind will act on those organs which\r\nnature has endowed to fulfil the law of her being, the walls of the vagina\r\nwill expand, and the glands at the entrance will be fully lubricated by a\r\nsecretion of mucous which renders congress a matter of comparative ease.\r\n\r\n14. WHEN THIS RESPONSIVE ENLARGEMENT and lubrication are fully realized, it\r\nis made plain why the haste and force so common to first and subsequent\r\ncoition is, as it has been justly called, nothing but \"legalized rape.\"\r\nYoung husband! Prove your manhood, not by yielding to unbridled lust and\r\ncruelty, but by the exhibition of true power in _self-control_ and patience\r\nwith the helpless being confided to your care! Prolong the delightful\r\nseason of courting into and _through_ wedded life, and rich shall be your\r\nreward. {205}\r\n\r\n15. A WANT OF DESIRE may often prevail, and may be caused by loss of sleep,\r\nstudy, constant thought, mental disturbance, anxiety, self-abuse, excessive\r\nuse of tobacco or alcoholic drink, etc. Overwork may cause debility; a man\r\nmay not have an erection for months, yet it may not be a sign of debility,\r\nsexual lethargy or impotence. Get the mind and the physical constitution in\r\nproper condition, and most all these difficulties will disappear. Good\r\nathletic exercise by walking, riding, or playing croquet, or any other\r\namusement, will greatly improve the condition. A good rest, however, will\r\nbe necessary to fully restore the mind and the body, then the natural\r\ncondition of the sexual organs will be resumed.\r\n\r\n16. HAVING TWINS.--Having twins is undoubtedly hereditary and descends from\r\ngeneration to generation, and persons who have twins are generally those\r\nwho have great sexual vigor. It is generally the result of a second\r\ncohabitation immediately following the first, but some parents have twins\r\nwho cohabit but once during several days.\r\n\r\n17. PROPER INTERCOURSE.--The right relation of a newly-married couple will\r\nrather increase than diminish love. To thus offer up the maiden on the\r\naltar of love and affection only swells her flood of joy and bliss;\r\nwhereas, on the other hand, sensuality humbles, debases, pollutes, and\r\nnever elevates. Young husbands should wait for an _invitation to the\r\nbanquet_, and they will be amply paid by the very pleasure sought.\r\nInvitation or permission delights, and possession by force degrades. The\r\nright-minded bridegroom will postpone the exercise of his nuptial rights\r\nfor a few days, and allow his young wife to become rested from the\r\npreparation and fatigue of the wedding, and become accustomed to the\r\nchanges in her new relations of life.\r\n\r\n18. RIGHTLY BEGINNING SEXUAL LIFE.--Intercourse promotes all the functions\r\nof the body and mind, but rampant lust and sexual abuses soon destroy the\r\nnatural pleasures of intercourse, and unhappiness will be the result.\r\nRemember that _intercourse_ should not become the polluted purpose of\r\nmarriage. To be sure, rational enjoyment benefits and stimulates love, but\r\nthe pleasure of each other's society, standing together on all questions of\r\nmutual benefit, working hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder in the battle\r\nof life, raising a family of beautiful children, sharing each other's joys\r\nand sorrows, are the things that bring to every couple the best, purest,\r\nand noblest enjoyment that God has bestowed upon man. {206}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TURKISH HAREM.]\r\n\r\nSexual Proprieties and Improprieties.\r\n\r\n1. To have offspring is not to be regarded as a luxury, but as a great\r\nprimary necessity of health and happiness, of which every fully-developed\r\nman and woman should have a fair share, while it cannot be denied that the\r\nignorance of the necessity of sexual intercourse to the health and virtue\r\nof both man and woman is the most fundamental error in medical and moral\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n2. In a state of pure nature, where man would have his sexual instincts\r\nunder full and natural restraint, there would be little, if any,\r\nlicentiousness, and children would be the result of natural desire, and not\r\nthe accidents of lust.\r\n\r\n3. This is an age of sensuality; unnatural passions are cultivated and\r\nindulged. Young people in the course of their engagement often sow the seed\r\nof serious excesses. This habit of embracing, sitting on the lover's lap,\r\nleaning on his breast, long and uninterrupted periods of secluded\r\ncompanionship, have become so common that it is amazing how a young lady\r\ncan safely arrive at the wedding day. While this conduct may safely\r\nterminate with the wedding day, yet it cultivates the tendency which often\r\nresults in excessive indulgencies after the honey-moon is over.\r\n\r\n4. SEPARATE BEDS.--Many writers have vigorously championed as a reform the\r\npractice of separate beds for husband and wife. While we would not\r\nrecommend such separation, it is no doubt very much better for both husband\r\nand wife, in case the wife is pregnant. Where people are reasonably\r\ntemperate, no such ordinary precautions as {207} separate sleeping places\r\nmay be necessary. But in case of pregnancy it will add rest to the mother\r\nand add vigor to the unborn child. Sleeping together, however, is natural\r\nand cultivates true affection, and it is physiologically true that in very\r\ncold weather life is prolonged by husband and wife sleeping together.\r\n\r\n5. THE AUTHORITY OF THE WIFE.--Let the wife judge whether she desires a\r\nseparate couch or not. She has the superior right to control her own\r\nperson. In such diseases as consumption, or other severe or lingering\r\ndiseases, separate beds should always be insisted upon.\r\n\r\n6. THE TIME FOR INDULGENCE.--The health of the generative functions depends\r\nupon exercise, just the same as any other vital organ. Intercourse should\r\nbe absolutely avoided just before or after meals, or just after mental\r\nexcitement or physical exercise. No wife should indulge her husband when he\r\nis under the influence of alcoholic stimulants, for idiocy and other\r\nserious maladies are liable to be visited upon the offspring.\r\n\r\n7. RESTRAINT DURING PREGNANCY.--There is no question but what moderate\r\nindulgence during the first few months of pregnancy does not result in\r\nserious harm; but people who excessively satisfy their ill-governed\r\npassions are liable to pay a serious penalty.\r\n\r\n8. MISCARRIAGE.--If a woman is liable to abortion or miscarriage, absolute\r\nabstinence is the only remedy. No sexual indulgence during pregnancy can be\r\nsafely tolerated.\r\n\r\n9. It is better for people not to marry until they are of proper age. It is\r\na physiological fact that men seldom reach the full maturity of their\r\nvirile power before the age of twenty-five, and the female rarely attains\r\nthe full vigor of her sexual powers before the age of twenty.\r\n\r\n10. ILLICIT PLEASURES.--The indulgence of illicit pleasures, says Dr. S.\r\nPancoast, sooner or later is sure to entail the most loathsome diseases on\r\ntheir votaries. Among these diseases are Gonorrhoea, Syphilis,\r\nSpermatorrhoea (waste of semen by daily and nightly involuntary emissions),\r\nSatyriasis (a species of sexual madness, or a sexual diabolism, causing men\r\nto commit rape and other beastly acts and outrages, not only on women and\r\nchildren, but men and animals, as sodomy, pederasty, etc.), Nymphomania\r\n(causing women to assail every man they meet, and supplicate and excite him\r\nto gratify their lustful passions, or who resort to means of sexual\r\npollutions, which is impossible to describe without shuddering), together\r\nwith spinal diseases and many disorders of the most distressing and\r\ndisgusting character, {208} filling the bones with rottenness, and eating\r\naway the flesh by gangrenous ulcers, until the patient dies, a horrible\r\nmass of putridity and corruption.\r\n\r\n11. SENSUALITY.--Sensuality is not love, but an unbridled desire which\r\nkills the soul. Sensuality will drive away the roses in the cheeks of\r\nwomanhood, undermine health and produce a brazen countenance that can be\r\nread by all men. The harlot may commit her sins in the dark, but her\r\ncountenance reveals her character and her immorality is an open secret.\r\n\r\n12. SEXUAL TEMPERANCE.--All excesses and absurdities of every kind should\r\nbe carefully avoided. Many of the female disorders which often revenge\r\nthemselves in the cessation of all sexual pleasure are largely due to the\r\nexcessive practice of sexual indulgence.\r\n\r\n13. FREQUENCY.--Some writers claim that intercourse should never occur\r\nexcept for the purpose of childbearing; but such restraint is not natural\r\nand consequently not conducive to health. There are many conditions in\r\nwhich the health of the mother and offspring must be respected. It is now\r\nheld that it is nearer a crime than a virtue to prostitute woman to the\r\ndegradation of breeding animals by compelling her to bring into life more\r\noffspring than can be born healthy, or be properly cared for and educated.\r\n\r\n14. In this work we shall attempt to specify no rule, but simply give\r\nadvice as to the health and happiness of both man and wife. A man should\r\nnot gratify his own desires at the expense of his wife's health, comfort or\r\ninclination. Many men no doubt harass their wives and force many burdens\r\nupon their slender constitutions. But it is a great sin and no true husband\r\nwill demand unreasonable recognition. The wife when physically able,\r\nhowever, should bear with her husband. Man is naturally sensitive on this\r\nsubject, and it takes but little to alienate his affections and bring\r\ndiscord into the family.\r\n\r\n15. The best writers lay down the rule for the government of the\r\nmarriage-bed, that sexual indulgence should only occur about once in a week\r\nor ten days, and this of course applies only to those who enjoy a fair\r\ndegree of health. But it is a hygienic and physiological fact that those\r\nwho indulge only once a month receive a far greater degree of the intensity\r\nof enjoyment than those who indulge their passions more frequently. Much\r\npleasure is lost by excesses where much might be gained by temperance,\r\ngiving rest to the organs for the accumulation of nervous force. {209}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHow to Perpetuate the Honey-Moon.\r\n\r\n1. CONTINUE YOUR COURTSHIP.--Like causes produce like effects.\r\n\r\n2. NEGLECT OF YOUR COMPANION.--Do not assume a right to neglect your\r\ncompanion more after marriage than you did before.\r\n\r\n3. SECRETS.--Have no secrets that you keep from your companion. A third\r\nparty is always disturbing.\r\n\r\n4. AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF EVIL.--In matrimonial matters it is often that\r\nthe mere appearance contains all the evil. Love, as soon as it rises above\r\ncalculation and becomes love, is exacting. It gives all, and demands all.\r\n\r\n5. ONCE MARRIED, NEVER OPEN YOUR MIND TO ANY CHANGE.--If you keep the door\r\nof your purpose closed, evil or even desirable changes cannot make headway\r\nwithout help.\r\n\r\n6. KEEP STEP IN MENTAL DEVELOPMENT.--A tree that grows for forty years may\r\ntake all the sunlight from a tree that stops growing at twenty.\r\n\r\n7. KEEP A LIVELY INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS OF THE HOME.--Two that do not\r\npull together are weaker than either alone.\r\n\r\n8. GAUGE YOUR EXPENSES BY YOUR REVENUES.--Love must eat. The sheriff often\r\nlevies on Cupid long before he takes away the old furniture.\r\n\r\n9. START FROM WHERE YOUR PARENTS STARTED RATHER THAN FROM WHERE THEY NOW\r\nARE.--Hollow and showy boarding often furnishes the too strong temptation,\r\nwhile the quietness of a humble home would cement the hearts beyond risk.\r\n{210}\r\n\r\n10. AVOID DEBT.--Spend your own money, but earn it first, then it will not\r\nbe necessary to blame any one for spending other people's.\r\n\r\n11. DO NOT BOTH GET ANGRY AT THE SAME TIME.--Remember, it takes two to\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\n12. DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF EVER TO COME TO AN OPEN RUPTURE.--Things unsaid\r\nneed less repentance.\r\n\r\n13. STUDY TO CONFORM YOUR TASTES AND HABITS TO THE TASTES AND HABITS OF\r\nYOUR COMPANION.--If two walk together, they must agree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Be a Good Wife.\r\n\r\n1. REVERENCE YOUR HUSBAND.--He sustains by God's order a position of\r\ndignity as head of a family, head of the woman. Any breaking down of this\r\norder indicates a mistake in the union, or a digression from duty.\r\n\r\n2. LOVE HIM.--A wife loves as naturally as the sun shines. Love is your\r\nbest weapon. You conquered him with that in the first place. You can\r\nreconquer by the same means.\r\n\r\n3. DO NOT CONCEAL YOUR LOVE FROM HIM.--If he is crowded with care, and too\r\nbusy to seem to heed your love, you need to give all the greater attention\r\nto securing his knowledge of your love. If you intermit he will settle down\r\ninto a hard, cold life with increased rapidity. Your example will keep the\r\nlight on his conviction. The more he neglects the fire on the hearth, the\r\nmore carefully must you feed and guard it. It must not be allowed to go\r\nout. Once out you must sit ever in darkness and in the cold.\r\n\r\n4. CULTIVATE THE MODESTY AND DELICACY OF YOUR YOUTH.--The relations and\r\nfamiliarity of wedded life may seem to tone down the sensitive and retiring\r\ninstincts of girlhood, but nothing can compensate for the loss of these.\r\nHowever, much men may admire the public performance of gifted women, they\r\ndo not desire that boldness and dash in a wife. The holy blush of a\r\nmaiden's modesty is more powerful in hallowing and governing a home than\r\nthe heaviest armament that ever a warrior bore.\r\n\r\n5. CULTIVATE PERSONAL ATTRACTIVENESS.--This means the storing of your mind\r\nwith a knowledge of passing events, and with a good idea of the world's\r\ngeneral advance. If you read nothing, and make no effort to make yourself\r\nattractive, you will soon sink down into a dull hack of stupidity. If {211}\r\nyour husband never hears from you any words of wisdom, or of common\r\ninformation, he will soon hear nothing from you. Dress and gossips soon\r\nwear out. If your memory is weak, so that it hardly seems worth while to\r\nread, that is additional reason for reading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TALKING BEFORE MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\n6. CULTIVATE PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS.--When you were encouraging the\r\nattentions of him whom you now call husband, you did not neglect any item\r\nof dress or appearance {212} that could help you. Your hair was always in\r\nperfect training. You never greeted him with a ragged or untidy dress or\r\nsoiled hands. It is true that your \"market is made,\" but you cannot afford\r\nto have it \"broken.\" Cleanliness and good taste will attract now as they\r\ndid formerly. Keep yourself at your best. Make the most of physical\r\nendowments. Neatness and order break the power of poverty.\r\n\r\n7. STUDY YOUR HUSBAND'S CHARACTER.--He has his peculiarities. He has no\r\nright to many of them, and you need to know them; thus you can avoid many\r\nhours of friction. The good pilot steers around the sunken rocks that lie\r\nin the channel. The engineer may remove them, not the pilot. You are more\r\npilot than engineer. Consult his tastes. It is more important to your home,\r\nthat you should please him than anybody else.\r\n\r\n8. PRACTICE ECONOMY.--Many families are cast out of peace into grumbling\r\nand discord by being compelled to fight against poverty. When there are no\r\ngreat distresses to be endured or accounted for, complaint and\r\nfault-finding are not so often evoked. Keep your husband free from the\r\nannoyance of disappointed creditors, and he will be more apt to keep free\r\nfrom annoying you. To toil hard for bread, to fight the wolf from the door,\r\nto resist impatient creditors, to struggle against complaining pride at\r\nhome, is too much to ask of one man. A crust that is your own is a feast,\r\nwhile a feast that is purloined from unwilling creditors is a famine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Be a Good Husband.\r\n\r\n1. SHOW YOUR LOVE.--All life manifests itself. As certainly as a live tree\r\nwill put forth leaves in the spring, so certainly will a living love show\r\nitself. Many a noble man toils early and late to earn bread and position\r\nfor his wife. He hesitates at no weariness for her sake. He justly thinks\r\nthat such industry and providence give a better expression of his love than\r\nhe could by caressing her and letting the grocery bills go unpaid. He fills\r\nthe cellar and pantry. He drives and pushes his business. He never dreams\r\nthat he is actually starving his wife to death. He may soon have a woman\r\nleft to superintend his home, but his wife is dying. She must be kept alive\r\nby the same process that called her into being. Recall and repeat the\r\nlittle attentions and delicate compliments that once made you so agreeable,\r\nand that fanned her love into a consuming flame. It is not beneath the\r\ndignity of the skillful physician to study all the {214} little symptoms,\r\nand order all the little round of attentions that check the waste of\r\nstrength and brace the staggering constitution. It is good work for a\r\nhusband to cherish his wife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TALKING AFTER MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\n2. CONSULT WITH YOUR WIFE.--She is apt to be as right as you are, and\r\nfrequently able to add much to your stock of wisdom. In any event she\r\nappreciates your attentions.\r\n\r\n3. STUDY TO KEEP HER YOUNG.--It can be done. It is not work, but worry,\r\nthat wears. Keep a brave, true heart between her and all harm.\r\n\r\n4. HELP TO BEAR HER BURDENS.--Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill\r\nthe law of love. Love seeks opportunities to do for the loved object. She\r\nhas the constant care of your children. She is ordained by the Lord to\r\nstand guard over them. Not a disease can appear in the community without\r\nher taking the alarm. Not a disease can come over the threshold without her\r\ninstantly springing into the mortal combat. If there is a deficiency\r\nanywhere, it comes out of her pleasure. Her burdens are everywhere. Look\r\nfor them, that you may lighten them.\r\n\r\n5. MAKE YOURSELF HELPFUL BY THOUGHTFULNESS.--Remember to bring into the\r\nhouse your best smile and sunshine. It is good for you, and it cheers up\r\nthe home. There is hardly a nook in the house that has not been carefully\r\nhunted through to drive out everything that might annoy you. The dinner\r\nwhich suits, or ought to suit you, has not come on the table of itself. It\r\nrepresents much thoughtfulness and work. You can do no more manly thing\r\nthan find some way of expressing, in word or look, your appreciation of it.\r\n\r\n6. EXPRESS YOUR WILL, NOT BY COMMANDS, BUT BY SUGGESTIONS.--It is God's\r\norder that you should be the head of the family. You are clothed with\r\nauthority. But this does not authorize you to be stern and harsh, as an\r\nofficer in the army. Your authority is the dignity of love. When it is not\r\nclothed in love it ceases to have the substance of authority. A simple\r\nsuggestion that may embody a wish, an opinion or an argument, becomes one\r\nwho reigns over such a kingdom as yours.\r\n\r\n7. SEEK TO REFINE YOUR NATURE.--It is no slander to say that many men have\r\nwives much more refined than themselves. This is natural in the\r\ninequalities of life. Other qualities may compensate for any defect here.\r\nBut you need have no defect in refinement. Preserve the gentleness and\r\nrefinement of your wife as a rich legacy for your children, and in so doing\r\nyou will lift yourself to higher levels. {215}\r\n\r\n8. BE A GENTLEMAN AS WELL AS A HUSBAND.--The signs and bronze and callouses\r\nof toil are no indications that you are not a gentleman. The soul of\r\ngentlemanliness is a kindly feeling toward others, that prompts one to\r\nsecure their comfort. That is why the thoughtful peasant lover is always so\r\ngentlemanly, and in his love much above himself.\r\n\r\n9. STAY AT HOME.--Habitual absence during the evenings is sure to bring\r\nsorrow. If your duty or business calls you, you have the promise that you\r\nwill be kept in all your ways. But if you go out to mingle with other\r\nsociety, and leave your wife at home alone, or with the children and\r\nservants, know that there is no good in store for you. She has claims upon\r\nyou that you can not afford to allow to go to protest. Reverse the case.\r\nYou sit down alone after having waited all day for your wife's return, and\r\nthink of her as reveling in gay society, and see if you can keep out all\r\nthe doubts as to what takes her away. If your home is not as attractive as\r\nyou want it, you are a principal partner. Set yourself about the work of\r\nmaking it attractive.\r\n\r\n10. TAKE YOUR WIFE WITH YOU INTO SOCIETY.--Seclusion begets morbidness. She\r\nneeds some of the life that comes from contact with society. She must see\r\nhow other people appear and act. It often requires an exertion for her to\r\ngo out of her home, but it is good for her and for you. She will bring back\r\nmore sunshine. It is wise to rest sometimes. When the Arab stops for his\r\ndinner he unpacks his camel. Treat your wife with as much consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{217}\r\n\r\nCause of Family Troubles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIRED OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\n1. MUCH BETTER TO BE ALONE.--He who made man said it is not good for him to\r\nbe alone; but it is much better to be alone, than it is to be in some kinds\r\nof company. Many couples who felt unhappy when they were apart, have been\r\nutterly miserable when together; and scores who have been ready to go\r\nthrough fire and water to get married, have been willing to run the risk of\r\nfire and brimstone to get divorced. It is by no means certain that because\r\npersons are wretched before marriage they will be happy after it. The\r\nwretchedness of many homes, and the prevalence of immorality and divorce is\r\na sad commentary on the evils which result from unwise marriages.\r\n\r\n2. UNAVOIDABLE EVILS.--There are plenty of unavoidable evils in this world,\r\nand it is mournful to think of the multitudes who are preparing themselves\r\nfor needless disappointments, and who yet have no fear, and are unwilling\r\nto be instructed, cautioned or warned. To them the experience of mature\r\nlife is of little account compared with the wisdom of ardent and\r\nenthusiastic youth.\r\n\r\n3. MATRIMONIAL INFELICITY.--One great cause of matrimonial infelicity is\r\nthe hasty marriages of persons who have no adequate knowledge of each\r\nother's characters. Two strangers become acquainted, and are attracted to\r\neach other, and without taking half the trouble to investigate or inquire\r\nthat a prudent man would take before buying a saddle horse, they are\r\nmarried. In a few weeks or months it is perhaps found that one of the\r\nparties was married already, or possibly that the man is drunken or\r\nvicious, or the woman anything but what she should be. Then begins the\r\nbitter part of the experience: shame, disgrace, scandal, separation, sin\r\nand divorce, all come as the natural results of a rash and foolish\r\nmarriage. A little time spent in honest, candid, and careful preliminary\r\ninquiry and investigation, would have saved the trouble.\r\n\r\n4. THE CLIMAX.--It has been said that a man is never utterly ruined until\r\nhe has married a bad woman. So the climax of woman's miseries and sorrows\r\nmay be said to come only when she is bound with that bond which should be\r\nher chiefest blessing and her highest joy, but which may prove her deepest\r\nsorrow and her bitterest curse.\r\n\r\n5. THE FOLLY OF FOLLIES.--There are some lessons which people are very slow\r\nto learn, and yet which are based upon {218} the simple principles of\r\ncommon-sense. A young lady casts her eye upon a young man. She says, \"I\r\nmean to have that man.\" She plies her arts, engages his affections, marries\r\nhim, and secures for herself a life of sorrow and disappointment, ending\r\nperhaps in a broken up home or an early grave. Any prudent, intelligent\r\nperson of mature age, might have warned or cautioned her; but she sought no\r\nadvice, and accepted no admonition. A young man may pursue a similar course\r\nwith equally disastrous results.\r\n\r\n6. HAP-HAZARD.--Many marriages are undoubtedly arranged by what may be\r\ntermed the accident of locality. Persons live near each other, become\r\nacquainted, and engage themselves to those whom they never would have\r\nselected as their companions in life if they had wider opportunities of\r\nacquaintance. Within the borders of their limited circle they make a\r\nselection which may be wise or may be unwise. They have no means of\r\njudging, they allow no one else to judge for them. The results are\r\nsometimes happy and sometimes unhappy in the extreme. It is well to act\r\ncautiously in doing what can be done but once. It is not a pleasant\r\nexperience for a person to find out a mistake when it is too late to\r\nrectify it.\r\n\r\n7. WE ALL CHANGE.--When two persons of opposite sex are often thrown\r\ntogether they are very naturally attracted to each other, and are liable to\r\nimbibe the opinion that they are better fitted for life-long companionship\r\nthan any other two persons in the world. This may be the case, or it may\r\nnot be. There are a thousand chances against such a conclusion to one in\r\nfavor of it. But even if at the present moment these two persons were\r\nfitted to be associated, no one can tell whether the case will be the same\r\nfive or ten years hence. Men change; women change; they are not the same\r\nthey were ten years ago; they are not the same they will be ten years\r\nhence.\r\n\r\n8. THE SAFE RULE.--Do not be in a hurry; take your time, and consider well\r\nbefore you allow your devotion to rule you. Study first your character,\r\nthen study the character of her whom you desire to marry. Love works\r\nmysteriously, and if it will bear careful and cool investigation, it will\r\nno doubt thrive under adversity. When people marry they unite their\r\ndestinies for the better or the worse. Marriage is a contract for life and\r\nwill never bear a hasty conclusion. _Never be in a hurry!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{219}\r\n\r\nJealousy--Its Cause and Cure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          Trifles, light as air\r\n  Are to the jealous confirmations strong,\r\n  As proofs of holy writ.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n          Nor Jealousy\r\n  Was understood, the injur'd lover's hell.--MILTON.\r\n\r\n          O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;\r\n  It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\r\n  The meat it feeds on.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITION.--Jealousy is an accidental passion, for which the faculty\r\nindeed is unborn. In its nobler form and in its nobler motives it arises\r\nfrom love, and in its lower form it arises from the deepest and darkest Pit\r\nof Satan.\r\n\r\n2. HOW DEVELOPED.--Jealousy arises either from weakness, which from a sense\r\nof its own want of lovable qualities is not convinced of being sure of its\r\ncause, or from distrust, which thinks the beloved person capable of\r\ninfidelity. Sometimes all these motives may act together.\r\n\r\n3. NOBLEST JEALOUSY.--The noblest jealousy, if the term noble is\r\nappropriate, is a sort of ambition or pride of the loving person who feels\r\nit is an insult that another one should assume it as possible to supplant\r\nhis love, or it is the highest degree of devotion which sees a declaration\r\nof its object in the foreign invasion, as it were, of his own altar.\r\nJealousy is always a sign that a little more wisdom might adorn the\r\nindividual without harm.\r\n\r\n4. THE LOWEST JEALOUSY.--The lowest species of jealousy is a sort of\r\navarice of envy which, without being capable of love, at least wishes to\r\npossess the object of its jealousy alone by the one party assuming a sort\r\nof property right over the other. This jealousy, which might be called the\r\nSatanic, is generally to be found with old withered \"husbands,\" whom the\r\ndevil has prompted to marry young women and who forthwith dream night and\r\nday of cuck-old's horns. These Argus-eyed keepers are no longer capable of\r\nany feeling that could be called love, they are rather as a rule heartless\r\nhouse-tyrants, and are in constant dread that some one may admire or\r\nappreciate his unfortunate slave.\r\n\r\n5. WANT OF LOVE.--The general conclusion will be that jealousy is more the\r\nresult of wrong conditions which cause uncongenial unions, and which\r\nthrough moral corruption, artificially create distrust, than a necessary\r\naccompaniment of love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEEKING THE LIFE OF A RIVAL.]\r\n\r\n{221}\r\n\r\n6. RESULT OF POOR OPINION.--Jealousy is a passion with which those are most\r\nafflicted who are the least worthy of love. An innocent maiden who enters\r\nmarriage will not dream of getting jealous; but all her innocence cannot\r\nsecure her against the jealousy of her husband if he has been a libertine.\r\nThose are wont to be the most jealous who have the consciousness that they\r\nthemselves are most deserving of jealousy. Most men in consequence of their\r\npresent education and corruption have so poor an opinion not only of the\r\nmale, but even of the female sex, that they believe every woman at every\r\nmoment capable of what they themselves have looked for among all and have\r\nfound among the most unfortunate, the prostitutes. No libertine can believe\r\nin the purity of woman; it is contrary to nature. A libertine therefore\r\ncannot believe in the loyalty of a faithful wife.\r\n\r\n7. WHEN JUSTIFIABLE.--There may be occasions where jealousy is justifiable.\r\nIf a woman's confidence has been shaken in her husband, or a husband's\r\nconfidence has been shaken in his wife by certain signs or conduct, which\r\nhave no other meaning but that of infidelity, then there is just cause for\r\njealousy. There must, however, be certain proof as evidence of the wife's\r\nor husband's immoral conduct. Imaginations or any foolish absurdities\r\nshould have no consideration whatever, and let everyone have confidence\r\nuntil his or her faith has been shaken by the revelation of absolute facts.\r\n\r\n8. CAUTION AND ADVICE.--No couple should allow their associations to\r\ndevelop into an engagement and marriage if either one has any inclination\r\nto jealousy. It shows invariably a want of sufficient confidence, and that\r\nwant of confidence, instead of being diminished after marriage, is liable\r\nto increase, until by the aid of the imagination and wrong interpretation\r\nthe home is made a hell and divorce a necessity. Let it be remembered,\r\nthere can be no true love without perfect and absolute confidence. Jealousy\r\nis always the sign of weakness or madness. Avoid a jealous disposition, for\r\nit is an open acknowledgment of a lack of faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{222}\r\n\r\nThe Improvement of Offspring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy Bring Into the World Idiots, Fools, Criminals and Lunatics?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Mother's Good Night Prayer.]\r\n\r\n1. THE RIGHT WAY.--When mankind will properly love and marry and then\r\nrightly generate, carry, nurse and educate their children, will they in\r\ndeed and in truth carry out {223} the holy and happy purpose of their\r\nCreator. See those miserable and depraved scape-goats of humanity, the\r\ndemented simpletons, the half-crazy, unbalanced multitudes which infest our\r\nearth, and fill our prisons with criminals and our poor-houses with\r\npaupers. Oh! the boundless capabilities and perfections of our God-like\r\nnature and, alas! its deformities! All is the result of the ignorance or\r\nindifference of parents. As long as children are the accidents of lust\r\ninstead of the premeditated objects of love, so long will the offspring\r\ndeteriorate and the world be cursed with deformities, monstrosities,\r\nunhumanities and cranks.\r\n\r\n2. EACH AFTER ITS KIND.--\"Like parents like children.\" \"In their own image\r\nbeget\" they them. In what other can they? \"How can a corrupt tree bring\r\nforth good fruit?\" How can animal propensities in parents generate other\r\nthan depraved children, or moral purity beget beings other than as holy by\r\nnature as those at whose hands they received existence and constitution?\r\n\r\n3. AS ARE THE PARENTS, physically, mentally and morally when they stamp\r\ntheir own image and likeness upon progeny, so will be the constitution of\r\nthat progeny.\r\n\r\n4. \"JUST AS THE TWIG IS BENT THE TREE'S INCLINED.\"--Yet the bramble cannot\r\nbe bent to bear delicious peaches, nor the sycamore to bear grain.\r\nEducation is something, but _parentage_ is _everything_; because it \"_dyes\r\nin the wool_,\" and thereby exerts an influence on character almost\r\ninfinitely more powerful than all other conditions put together.\r\n\r\n5. HEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.--Thoughtless mortal! Before you allow\r\nthe first goings forth of love, learn what the parental conditions in you\r\nmean, and you will confer a great boon upon the prospective bone of your\r\nbone, and flesh of your flesh! If it is in your power to be the parent of\r\nbeautiful, healthy, moral and talented children instead of diseased and\r\ndepraved, is it not your imperious duty then, to impart to them that\r\nphysical power, moral perfection, and intellectual capability, which shall\r\nennoble their lives and make them good people and good citizens?\r\n\r\n6. PAUSE AND TREMBLE.--Prospective parents! Will you trifle with the\r\ndearest interests of your children? Will you in matters thus momentous,\r\nhead-long rush\r\n\r\n \"Where angels dare not tread?\"\r\n\r\nSeeking only mere animal indulgence?--Well might cherubim shrink from\r\nassuming responsibilities thus momentous! Yet, how many parents tread this\r\nholy ground completely unprepared, and almost as thoughtlessly and\r\nignorantly as brutes--entailing even loathsome diseases and {224} sensual\r\npropensities upon the fruit of their own bodies. Whereas they are bound, by\r\nobligations the most imperious, to bestow on them a good physical\r\norganization, along with a pure, moral, and strong intellectual\r\nconstitution, or else not to become parents! Especially since it is easier\r\nto generate human angels than devils incarnate.\r\n\r\n7. HEREDITARY DESCENT.--This great law of things, \"Hereditary Descent,\"\r\nfully proves and illustrates in any required number and variety of cases,\r\nshowing that progeny inherits the constitutional natures and characters,\r\nmental and physical, of parents, including pre-dispositions to consumption,\r\ninsanity, all sorts of disease, etc., as well as longevity, strength,\r\nstature, looks, disposition, talents,--all that is constitutional. From\r\nwhat other source do or can they come? Indeed, who can doubt a truth as\r\npalpable as that children inherit some, and if some, therefore all, the\r\nphysical and mental nature and constitution of parents, thus becoming\r\nalmost their fac-similes?\r\n\r\n8. ILLUSTRATIONS.--A whaleman was severely hurt by a harpooned and\r\ndesperate whale turning upon the small boat, and, by his monstrous jaws,\r\nsmashing it to pieces, one of which, striking him in his right side,\r\ncrippled him for life. When sufficiently recovered, he married, according\r\nto previous engagement, and his daughter, born in due time, and closely\r\nresembling him in looks, constitution and character, has a weak and sore\r\nplace corresponding in location with that of the injury of her father.\r\nTubercles have been found in the lungs of infants at birth, born of\r\nconsumptive parents,--a proof, clear and demonstrative, that children\r\ninherit the several states of parental physiology existing at the time they\r\nreceived their physiological constitution. The same is true of the\r\ntransmission of those diseases consequent on the violation of the law of\r\nchastity, and the same conclusion established thereby.\r\n\r\n9. PARENT'S PARTICIPATION.--Each parent furnishing an indispensable portion\r\nof the materials of life, and somehow or other, contributes parentally to\r\nthe formation of the constitutional character of their joint product,\r\nappears far more reasonable, than to ascribe, as many do, the whole to\r\neither, some to paternity, others to maternity. Still this decision go\r\nwhich way it may, does not affect the great fact that children inherit both\r\nthe physiology and the mentality existing in parents at the time they\r\nreceived being and constitution.\r\n\r\n10. ILLEGITIMATES OR BASTARDS also furnish strong proof of the correctness\r\nof this our leading doctrine. They are generally lively, sprightly, witty,\r\nfrolicsome, knowing, {225} quick of perception, apt to learn, full of\r\npassion, quick-tempered, impulsive throughout, hasty, indiscreet, given to\r\nexcesses, yet abound in good feeling, and are well calculated to enjoy\r\nlife, though in general sadly deficient in some essential moral elements.\r\n\r\n11. CHARACTER OF ILLEGITIMATES.--Wherein, then, consists this difference?\r\nFirst, in \"novelty lending an enchantment\" rarely experienced in sated\r\nwedlock, as well as in power of passion sufficient to break through all\r\nrestraint, external and internal; and hence their high wrought\r\norganization. They are usually wary and on the alert, and their parents\r\ndrank \"stolen waters.\" They are commonly wanting in moral balance, or else\r\ndelinquent in some important moral aspect; nor would they have ever been\r\nborn unless this had been the case, for the time being at least, with their\r\nparents. Behold in these, and many other respects easily cited, how\r\nstriking the coincidence between their characters on the one hand, and, on\r\nthe other, those parental conditions necessarily attendant on their origin.\r\n\r\n12. CHILDREN'S CONDITION depends upon parents' condition at the time of the\r\nsexual embrace. Let parents recall, as nearly as may be their circumstances\r\nand states of body and mind at this period, and place them by the side of\r\nthe physical and mental constitutions of their children, and then say\r\nwhether this law is not a great practical truth, and if so, its importance\r\nis as the happiness and misery it is capable of affecting! The application\r\nof this mighty engine of good or evil to mankind, to the promotion of human\r\nadvancement, is the great question which should profoundly interest all\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n13. THE VITAL PERIOD.--The physical condition of parents at the vital\r\nperiod of transmission of life should be a perfect condition of health in\r\nboth body and mind, and a rigorous condition of all the animal organs and\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n14. MUSCULAR PREPARATION.--Especially should parents cultivate their\r\nmuscular system preparatory to the perfection of this function, and of\r\ntheir children; because, to impart strength and stamina to offspring they\r\nmust of necessity both possess a good muscular organization, and also bring\r\nit into vigorous requisition at this period. For this reason, if for no\r\nother, let those of sedentary habits cultivate muscular energy preparatory\r\nto this time of need.\r\n\r\n15. THE SEED.--So exceedingly delicate are the seeds of life, that, unless\r\nplanted in a place of perfect security, they must all be destroyed, and our\r\nrace itself extinguished. And what place is as secure as that chosen, where\r\nthey can {226} be reached only with the utmost difficulty, and than only at\r\nthe peril of even life itself? Imperfect seed sown in poor ground means a\r\nsickly harvest.\r\n\r\n16. HEALTHY PEOPLE--MOST CHILDREN.--The most healthy classes have the most\r\nnumerous families; but that, as luxury enervates society, it diminishes the\r\npopulation, by enfeebling parents, nature preferring none rather than those\r\ntoo weakly to live and be happy, and thereby rendering that union\r\nunfruitful which is too feeble to produce offspring sufficiently strong to\r\nenjoy life. Debility and disease often cause barrenness. Nature seems to\r\nrebel against sickly offspring.\r\n\r\n17. WHY CHILDREN DIE.--Inquire whether one or both the parents of those\r\nnumerous children that die around us, have not weak lungs, or a debilitated\r\nstomach, or a diseased liver, or feeble muscles, or else use them but\r\nlittle, or disordered nerves, or some other debility or form of disease.\r\nThe prevalence of summer complaints, colic, cholera infantum, and other\r\naffections of these vital organs of children is truly alarming, sweeping\r\nthem into their graves by the million. Shall other animals rear nearly all\r\ntheir young, and shall man, constitutionally by far the strongest of them\r\nall, lose half or more of his? Is this the order of nature? No, but their\r\ndeath-worm is born in and with them, and by parental agency.\r\n\r\n18. GRAVE-YARD STATISTICS.--Take grave-yard statistics in August, and then\r\nsay, whether most of the deaths of children are not caused by indigestion,\r\nor feebleness of the bowels, liver, etc., or complaints growing out of\r\nthem? Rather, take family statistics from broken-hearted parents! And yet,\r\nin general, those very parents who thus suffer more than words can tell,\r\nwere the first and main transgressors, because they entailed those\r\ndyspeptic, heart, and other kindred affections so common among American\r\nparents upon their own children, and thereby almost as bad as killed them\r\nby inches; thus depriving them of the joys of life, and themselves of their\r\ngreatest earthly treasure!\r\n\r\n19. ALL CHILDREN MAY DIE.--Children may indeed die whose parents are\r\nhealthy, but they almost must whose parents are essentially ailing in one\r\nor more of their vital organs; because, since they inherit this organ\r\ndebilitated or diseased, any additional cause of sickness attacks this part\r\nfirst, and when it gives out, all go by the board together.\r\n\r\n20. PARENTS MUST LEARN AND OBEY.--How infinitely more virtuous and happy\r\nwould your children be if you should be healthy in body, and happy in mind,\r\nso as to beget in {227} them a constitutionally healthy and vigorous\r\nphysiology, along with a serene and happy frame of mind! Words are utterly\r\npowerless in answer, and so is everything but a lifetime of consequent\r\nhappiness or misery! Learn and obey, then, the laws of life and health,\r\nthat you may both reap the rich reward yourself, and also shower down upon\r\nyour children after you, blessings many and most exalted. Avoid excesses of\r\nall kinds, be temperate, take good care of the body and avoid exposures and\r\ndisease, and your children will be models of health and beauty.\r\n\r\n21. THE RIGHT CONDITION.--The great practical inference is, that those\r\nparents who desire intellectual and moral children, must love each other;\r\nbecause, this love, besides perpetually calling forth and cultivating their\r\nhigher faculties, awakens them to the highest pitch of exalted action in\r\nthat climax, concentration, and consummation of love which propagates their\r\nexisting qualities, the mental endowment of offspring being proportionate\r\nto the purity and intensity of parental love.\r\n\r\n22. THE EFFECTS.--The children of affectionate parents receive existence\r\nand constitution when love has rendered the mentality of their parents both\r\nmore elevated and more active than it is by nature, of course the children\r\nof loving parents are both more intellectual and moral by nature than their\r\nparents. Now, if these children and their companions also love one another,\r\nthis same law which renders the second generation better than the first,\r\nwill of course render the third still better than the second, and thus of\r\nall succeeding generations.\r\n\r\n23. ANIMAL IMPULSE.--You may preach and pray till doomsday--may send out\r\nmissionaries, may circulate tracts and Bibles, and multiply revivals and\r\nall the means of grace, with little avail; because, as long as mankind go\r\non, as now, to propagate by animal impulse, so long must their offspring be\r\nanimal, sensual, devilish! But only induce parents cordially to love each\r\nother, and you thereby render their children constitutionally talented and\r\nvirtuous. Oh! parents, by as much as you prefer the luxuries of concord to\r\nthe torments of discord, and children that are sweet dispositioned and\r\nhighly intellectual to those that are rough, wrathful, and depraved, be\r\nentreated to \"_love one another_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{229}\r\n\r\nToo Many Children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUST HOME FROM SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n1. LESSENING PAUPERISM.--Many of the agencies for lessening pauperism are\r\nafraid of tracing back its growth to the frequency of births under wretched\r\nconditions. One begins to question whether after all sweet charity or\r\ndignified philanthropy has not acted with an unwise reticence. Among the\r\nproblems which defy practical handling this is the most complicated. The\r\npauperism which arises from marriage is the result of the worst elements of\r\ncharacter legalized. In America, where the boundaries of wedlock are\r\npractically boundless, it is not desirable, even were it possible, that the\r\nstate should regulate marriage much further than it now does; therefore\r\nmust the sociologist turn for aid to society in his struggle with\r\npauperism.\r\n\r\n2. RIGHT PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL CONDITIONS OF BIRTH.--Society should insist\r\nupon the right spiritual and physical conditions for birth. It should be\r\nconsidered more than \"a pity\" when another child is born into a home too\r\npoor to receive it. The underlying selfishness of such an event should be\r\nrecognized, for it brings motherhood under wrong conditions of health and\r\nmoney. Instead of each birth being the result of mature consideration and\r\nhallowed love, children are too often born as animals are born. To be sure\r\nthe child has a father whom he can call by name. Better that there had\r\nnever been a child.\r\n\r\n3. WRONG RESULTS.--No one hesitates to declare that it is want of\r\nself-respect and morality which brings wrong results outside of marriage,\r\nbut it is also the want of them which begets evil inside the marriage\r\nrelation. Though there is nothing more difficult than to find the\r\nequilibrium between self-respect and self-sacrifice, yet on success in\r\nfinding it depends individual and national preservation. The fact of being\r\nwife and mother or husband and father should imply dignity and joyousness,\r\nno matter how humble the home.\r\n\r\n4. DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AMONGST PHYSICIANS.--In regard to teaching, the\r\ndifficulties are great. As soon as one advances beyond the simplest\r\nsubjects of hygiene, one is met with the difference of opinions among\r\nphysicians. When each one has a different way of making a mustard plaster,\r\nno wonder that each has his own notions about everything else. One doctor\r\nrecommends frequent births, another advises against them.\r\n\r\n5. DIFFERENT NATURES.--If physiological facts are taught to a large class,\r\nthere are sure to be some in it whose impressionable natures are excited by\r\ntoo much plain {230} speaking, while there are others who need the most\r\nopen teaching in order to gain any benefit. Talks to a few persons\r\ngenerally are wiser than popular lectures. Especially are talks needed by\r\nmothers and unmothered girls who come from everywhere to the city.\r\n\r\n6. BOYS AND YOUNG MEN.--It is not women alone who require the shelter of\r\norganizations and instruction, but boys and young men. There is no double\r\nstandard of morality, though the methods of advocating it depend upon the\r\nsex which is to be instructed. Men are more concerned with the practical\r\nbasis of morality than with its sentiment, and with the pecuniary aspects\r\nof domestic life than with its physical and mental suffering. We all may\r\nneed medicine for moral ills, yet the very intangibleness of purity makes\r\nus slow to formulate rules for its growth. Under the guidance of the wise\r\nin spirit and knowledge, much can be done to create a higher standard of\r\nmarriage and to proportion the number of births according to the health and\r\nincome of parents.\r\n\r\n7. FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE.--If the home exists primarily for the sake of\r\nthe individual, it exists secondarily for the sake of the state. Therefore,\r\nany home into which are continually born the inefficient children of\r\ninefficient parents, not only is a discomfort in itself, but it also\r\nfurnishes members for the armies of the unemployed, which are tinkering and\r\nhindering legislation and demanding by the brute force of numbers that the\r\nstate shall support them.\r\n\r\n8. OPINIONS FROM HIGH AUTHORITIES.--In the statements and arguments made in\r\nthe above we have not relied upon our own opinions and convictions, but\r\nhave consulted the best authorities, and we hereby quote some of the\r\nhighest authorities upon this subject.\r\n\r\n9. REV. LEONARD DAWSON.--\"How rapidly conjugal prudence might lift a nation\r\nout of pauperism was seen in France.--Let them therefore hold the maxim\r\nthat the production of offspring with forethought and providence is\r\nrational nature. It was immoral to bring children into the world whom they\r\ncould not reasonably hope to feed, clothe and educate.\"\r\n\r\n10. MRS. FAWCETT.--\"Nothing will permanently offset pauperism while the\r\npresent reckless increase of population continues.\"\r\n\r\n11. DR. GEORGE NAPHEYS.--\"Having too many children unquestionably has its\r\ndisastrous effects on both mother and {231} children as known to every\r\nintelligent physician. Two-thirds of all cases of womb disease, says Dr.\r\nTilt, are traceable to child-bearing in feeble women. There are also women\r\nto whom pregnancy is a nine months' torture, and others to whom it is\r\nnearly certain to prove fatal. Such a condition cannot be discovered before\r\nmarriage--The detestable crime of abortion is appallingly rife in our day.\r\nIt is abroad in our land to an extent which would have shocked the\r\ndissolute women of pagan Rome--This wholesale, fashionable murder, how are\r\nwe to stop it? Hundreds of vile men and women in our large cities subsist\r\nby this slaughter of the innocent.\"\r\n\r\n12. REV. H. R. HAWEIS.--\"Until it is thought a disgrace in every rank of\r\nsociety, from top to bottom of social scale, to bring into the world more\r\nchildren than you are able to provide for, the poor man's home, at least,\r\nmust often be a purgatory--his children dinnerless, his wife a\r\nbeggar--himself too often drunk--here, then, are the real remedies: first,\r\ncontrol the family growth according to the family means of support.\"\r\n\r\n13. MONTAGUE COOKSON.--\"The limitation of the number of the family--is as\r\nmuch the duty of married persons as the observance of chastity is the duty\r\nof those that are unmarried.\"\r\n\r\n14. JOHN STUART MILL.--\"Every one has aright to live. We will suppose this\r\ngranted. But no one has a right to bring children into life to be supported\r\nby other people. Whoever means to stand upon the first of these rights must\r\nrenounce all pretension to the last. Little improvement can be expected in\r\nmorality until the production of a large family is regarded in the same\r\nlight as drunkenness or any other physical excess.\"\r\n\r\n15. DR. T. D. NICHOLLS.--\"In the present social state, men and women should\r\nrefrain from having children unless they see a reasonable prospect of\r\ngiving them suitable nurture and education.\"\r\n\r\n16. REV. M. J. SAVAGE.--\"Some means ought to be provided for checking the\r\nbirth of sickly children.\"\r\n\r\n17. DR. STOCKHAM.--\"Thoughtful minds must acknowledge the great wrong done\r\nwhen children are begotten under adverse conditions. Women must learn the\r\nlaws of life so as to protect themselves, and not be the means of bringing\r\nsin-cursed, diseased children into the world. The remedy is in the\r\nprevention of pregnancy, not in producing abortion.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\nSmall Families and the Improvement of the Race.\r\n\r\n1. MARRIED PEOPLE MUST DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES.--It is the fashion of those\r\nwho marry nowadays to have few children, often none. Of course this is a\r\nmatter which married people must decide for themselves. As is stated in an\r\nearlier chapter, sometimes this policy is the wisest that can be pursued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n2. DISEASED PEOPLE.--Diseased people who are likely to beget only a sickly\r\noffspring, may follow this course, and so may thieves, rascals, vagabonds,\r\ninsane and drunken persons, and all those who are likely to bring into the\r\nworld beings that ought not to be here. But why so many well-to-do folks\r\nshould pursue a policy adapted only to paupers and criminals, is not easy\r\nto explain. Why marry at all if not to found a family that shall live to\r\nbless and make glad the earth after father and mother are gone? It is not\r\nwise to rear too many children, nor is it wise to have too few. Properly\r\nbrought up, they will make home a delight and parents happy.\r\n\r\n3. POPULATION LIMITED.--Galton, in his great work on hereditary genius,\r\nobserves that \"the time may hereafter arrive in far distant years, when the\r\npopulation of this earth shall be kept as strictly within bounds of number\r\nand suitability of race, as the sheep of a well-ordered moor, or the plants\r\nin an orchard-house; in the meantime, let us do what we can to encourage\r\nthe multiplication of the races best {233} fitted to invent and conform to\r\na high and generous civilization.\"\r\n\r\n4. SHALL SICKLY PEOPLE RAISE CHILDREN?--The question whether sickly people\r\nshould marry and propagate their kind, is briefly alluded to in an early\r\nchapter of this work. Where father and mother are both consumptive the\r\nchances are that the children will inherit physical weakness, which will\r\nresult in the same disease, unless great pains are taken to give them a\r\ngood physical education, and even then the probabilities are that they will\r\nfind life a burden hardly worth living.\r\n\r\n5. NO REAL BLESSING.--Where one parent is consumptive and the other\r\nvigorous, the chances are just half as great. If there is a scrofulous or\r\nconsumptive taint in the blood, beware! Sickly children are no comfort to\r\ntheir parents, no real blessing. If such people marry, they had better, in\r\nmost cases, avoid parentage.\r\n\r\n6. WELFARE OF MANKIND.--The advancement of the welfare of mankind is a most\r\nintricate problem: all ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid\r\nabject poverty for their children; for poverty is not only a great evil,\r\nbut tends to its own increase by leading to recklessness in marriage. On\r\nthe other hand, as Mr. Galton has remarked, if the prudent avoid marriage,\r\nwhile the reckless marry, the inferior members will tend to supplant the\r\nbetter members of society.\r\n\r\n7. PREVENTIVES.--Remember that the thousands of preventives which are\r\nadvertised in papers, private circulars, etc., are not only inefficient,\r\nunreliable and worthless, but positively dangerous, and the annual\r\nmortality of females in this country from this cause alone is truly\r\nhorrifying. Study nature, and nature's laws alone will guide you safely in\r\nthe path of health and happiness.\r\n\r\n8. NATURE'S REMEDY.--Nature in her wise economy has prepared for\r\noverproduction, for during the period of pregnancy and nursing, and also\r\nmost of the last half of each menstrual month, woman is naturally sterile;\r\nbut this condition may become irregular and uncertain on account of\r\nstimulating drinks or immoral excesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{234}\r\n\r\nThe Generative Organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS AND THEIR STRUCTURE AND ADAPTATION.\r\n\r\n1. The reproductive organs in man are the penis and testicles and their\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\n2. The penis deposits the seminal life germ of the male. It is designed to\r\nfulfill the seed planting mission of human life.\r\n\r\n3. In the accompanying illustration all the parts are named.\r\n\r\n4. URETHRA.--The urethra performs the important mission of emptying the\r\nbladder, and is rendered very much larger by the passion, and the semen is\r\npropelled along through it by little layers of muscles on each side meeting\r\n{235} above and below. It is this canal that is inflamed by the disease\r\nknown as gonorrhoea.\r\n\r\n5. PROSTRATE GLAND.--The prostrate gland is located just before the\r\nbladder. It swells in men who have previously overtaxed it, thus preventing\r\nall sexual intercourse, and becomes very troublesome to void urine. This is\r\na very common trouble in old age.\r\n\r\n6. THE PENAL GLAND.--The penal gland, located at the end of the penis,\r\nbecomes unduly enlarged by excessive action and has the consistency of\r\nIndia rubber. It is always enlarged by erection. It is this gland at the\r\nend that draws the semen forward. It is one of the most essential and\r\nwonderful constructed glands of the human body.\r\n\r\n7. FEMALE MAGNETISM.--When the male organ comes in contact with female\r\nmagnetism, the natural and proper excitement takes place. When excited\r\nwithout this female magnetism it becomes one of the most serious injuries\r\nto the human body. The male organ was made for a high and holy purpose, and\r\nwoe be to him who pollutes his manhood by practicing the secret vice. He\r\npays the penalty in after years either by the entire loss of sexual power,\r\nor by the afflictions of various urinary diseases.\r\n\r\n8. NATURE PAYS all her debts, and when there is an abuse of organ,\r\npenalties must follow. If the hand is thrust into the fire it will be\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE SEXUAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANATOMY OR STRUCTURE OF THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION.]\r\n\r\n1. The generative or reproductive organs of the human female are usually\r\ndivided into the internal and external. Those regarded as internal are\r\nconcealed from view and protected within the body. Those that can be\r\nreadily perceived are termed external. The entrance of the vagina may be\r\nstated as the line of demarcation of the two divisions. {236}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Impregnated Egg. In the first formation of Embryo.]\r\n\r\n2. HYMEN OR VAGINAL VALVE.--This is a thin membrane of half moon shape\r\nstretched across the opening of the vagina. It usually contains before\r\nmarriage one or more small openings for the passage of the menses. This\r\nmembrane has been known to cause much distress in many females at the first\r\nmenstrual flow. The trouble resulting from the openings in the hymen not\r\nbeing large enough to let the flow through and consequently blocking up the\r\nvaginal canal, and filling the entire {237} internal sexual organs with\r\nblood; causing paroxysms and hysterics and other alarming symptoms. In such\r\ncases the hymen must be ruptured that a proper discharge may take place at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n3. UNYIELDING HYMEN.--The hymen is usually ruptured by the first sexual\r\nintercourse, but sometimes it is so unyielding as to require the aid of a\r\nknife before coition can take place.\r\n\r\n4. THE PRESENCE OF THE HYMEN was formerly considered a test of virginity,\r\nbut this theory is no longer held by competent authorities, as disease or\r\naccidents or other circumstances may cause its rupture.\r\n\r\n5. THE OVARIES.--The ovaries are little glands for the purpose of forming\r\nthe female ova or egg. They are not fully developed until the period of\r\npuberty, and usually are about the size of a large chestnut. The are\r\nlocated in the broad ligaments between the uterus and the Fallopian tubes.\r\nDuring pregnancy the ovaries change position; they are brought farther into\r\nthe abdominal cavity as the uterus expands.\r\n\r\n6. OFFICE OF THE OVARY.--The ovary is to the female what the testicle is to\r\nthe male. It is the germ vitalizing organ and the most essential part of\r\nthe generative apparatus. The ovary is not only an organ for the formation\r\nof the ova, but is also designed for their separation when they reach\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n7. FALLOPIAN TUBES.--These are the ducts that lead from the ovaries to the\r\nuterus. They are entirely detached from the glands or ovaries, and are\r\ndeveloped on both sides of the body.\r\n\r\n8. OFFICE OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES.--The Fallopian tubes have a double\r\noffice: receiving the ova from the ovaries and conducting it into the\r\nuterus, as well as receiving the spermatic fluid of the male and conveying\r\nit from the uterus in the direction of the ovaries, the tubes being the\r\nseat of impregnation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVUM.]\r\n\r\n9. STERILITY IN FEMALES.--Sterility in the female is sometimes caused by a\r\nmorbid adhesion of the tube to a portion of the ovary. By what power the\r\nmouth of the tube is directed toward a particular portion of an ovary from\r\nwhich the ovum is about to be discharged, remains entirely unknown, as does\r\nalso the precise nature of the cause which effects this movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{238}\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIES OF THE FORMATION OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ripe Ovum from the Ovary.]\r\n\r\n1. SCIENTIFIC THEORIES.--Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel, Tyndall, Meyer, and other\r\nrenowned scientists, have tried to find the _missing link_ between man and\r\nanimal; they have also exhausted their genius in trying to fathom the\r\nmysteries of the beginning of life, or find where the animal and mineral\r\nkingdoms unite to form life; but they have added to the vast accumulation\r\nof theories only, and the world is but little wiser on this mysterious\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n2. PHYSIOLOGY.--Physiology has demonstrated what physiological changes take\r\nplace in the germination and formation of life, and how nature expresses\r\nthe intentions of reproduction by giving animals distinctive organs with\r\ncertain secretions for this purpose, etc. All the different stages of\r\ndevelopment can be easily determined, but how and why life takes place\r\nunder such special condition and under no other, is an unsolved mystery.\r\n\r\n3. OVARIES.--The ovaries are the essential parts of the generative system\r\nof the human female in which ova are matured. There are two ovaries, one on\r\neach side of the uterus, and connected with it by the Fallopian tubes. They\r\nare egg-shaped, about an inch in diameter, and furnish the {239} germs or\r\novules. These germs or ovules are very small, measuring about 1/120 of an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\n4. DEVELOPMENT.--The ovaries develop with the growth of the female, so that\r\nfinally at the period of puberty they ripen and liberate an ovum or germ\r\nvesicle, which is carried into the uterine cavity of the Fallopian tubes.\r\nBy the aid of the microscope we find that these ova are composed of\r\ngranular substance, in which is found a miniature yolk surrounded by a\r\ntransparent membrane called the zona pellucida. This yolk contains a\r\ngerminal vesicle in which can be discovered a nucleus, called the germinal\r\nspot. The process of the growth of the ovaries is very gradual, and their\r\nfunction of ripening and discharging one ovum monthly into the Fallopian\r\ntubes and uterus, is not completed until between the twelfth and fifteenth\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n5. WHAT SCIENCE KNOWS.--After the sexual embrace we know that the sperm is\r\nlifted within the genital passages or portion of the vagina and mouth of\r\nthe uterus. The time between the deposit of the semen and fecundation\r\nvaries according to circumstances. If the sperm-cell travels to the ovarium\r\nit generally takes from three to five days to make the journey. As Dr.\r\nPierce says: \"The transportation is aided by the ciliary processes (little\r\nhairs) of the mucous surface of the vaginal and uterine walls, as well as\r\nby its own vibratile movements. The action of the cilia, under the stimulus\r\nof the sperm, seems to be from without, inward. Even if a minute particle\r\nof sperm, less than a drop, be left upon the margin of the external\r\ngenitals of the female, it is sufficient in amount to impregnate, and can\r\nbe carried, by help of these cilia, to the ovaries.\"\r\n\r\n6. CONCEPTION.--After intercourse at the proper time the liability to\r\nconception is very great. If the organs are in a healthy condition,\r\nconception must necessarily follow, and no amount of prudence and the most\r\nrigid precautions often fail to prevent pregnancy.\r\n\r\n7. ONLY ONE ABSOLUTELY SAFE METHOD.--There is only one absolutely safe\r\nmethod to prevent conception, entirely free from danger and injury to\r\nhealth, and one that is in the reach of all; that is to refrain from union\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{240}\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF CONCEPTION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PATIENT MOTHER.]\r\n\r\n1. The question is always asked, \"Can Conception be prevented at all\r\ntimes?\" Certainly, this is possible; but such an interference with nature's\r\nlaws is inadmissible, and perhaps never to be justified in any case\r\nwhatever, except in cases of deformity or disease.\r\n\r\n2. If the parties of a marriage are both feeble and so adapted to each\r\nother that their children are deformed, insane or idiots, then to beget\r\noffspring would be a flagrant wrong; if the mother's health is in such a\r\ncondition as to forbid the right of laying the burden of motherhood upon\r\nher, then medical aid may safely come to her relief. If the man, however,\r\nrespects his wife, he ought to come to her relief without the counsel of a\r\nphysician. {241}\r\n\r\n3. FORBEARANCE.--Often before the mother has recovered from the effects of\r\nbearing, nursing and rearing one child, ere she has regained proper tone\r\nand vigor of body and mind, she is unexpectedly overtaken, surprised by the\r\nmanifestation of symptoms which again indicate pregnancy. Children thus\r\nbegotten cannot become hardy and long-lived. By the love that parents may\r\nfeel for their posterity, by the wishes for their success, by the hopes for\r\ntheir usefulness, by every consideration for their future well-being, let\r\nthem exercise precaution and forbearance until the wife becomes\r\nsufficiently healthy and enduring to bequeath her own rugged, vital stamina\r\nto the child she bears in love.\r\n\r\n4. IMPOSTORS.--During the past few years hundreds of books and pamphlets\r\nhave been written on the subject, claiming that new remedies had been\r\ndiscovered for the prevention of conception, etc., but these are all money\r\nmaking devices to deceive the public, and enrich the pockets of miserable\r\nand unprincipled impostors.\r\n\r\n5. THE FOLLIES OF PREVENTION.--Dr. Pancoast, an eminent authority, says:\r\n\"The truth is, there is no medicine taken internally capable of preventing\r\nconception, and the person who asserts to the contrary, not only speaks\r\nfalsely, but is both a knave and a fool. It is true enough that remedies\r\nmay be taken to produce abortion after conception occurs; but those who\r\nprescribe and those who resort to such desperate expedients, can only be\r\nplaced in the category of lunatics and assassins!\"\r\n\r\n6. PATENT MEDICINES.--If nature does not promptly respond, there are many\r\npatent medicines which when taken at the time the monthly flow is to begin,\r\nwill produce the desired result. Let women beware; for it is only a\r\nquestion of a few years when their constitution, complexion, and health\r\nwill be a sorry evidence of their folly. The woman who continually takes a\r\ndrug to prevent conception, cannot retain her natural complexion; her eyes\r\nwill become dull, her cheeks flabby, and she will show various evidences of\r\npoor health, and her sexual organs will soon become permanently impaired\r\nand hopelessly diseased.\r\n\r\n7. FOOLISH DREAD OF CHILDREN.--What is more deplorable and pitiable than an\r\nold couple childless. Young people dislike the care and confinement of\r\nchildren and prefer society and social entertainments and thereby do great\r\ninjustice and injury to their health and fit themselves in later years to\r\nvisit infirmities and diseases upon their children. The vigilant and rigid\r\nmeasures which have to be resorted to in order to prevent conception for a\r\nperiod of years unfits many a wife for the production of healthy children.\r\n{242}\r\n\r\n8. HAVING CHILDREN under proper circumstances never ruins the health and\r\nhappiness of any woman. In fact, womanhood is incomplete without them. She\r\nmay have a dozen or more, and still have better health than before\r\nmarriage. It is having them too close together, and when she is not in a\r\nfit state, that her health gives way. Sometimes the mother is diseased; the\r\noutlet from the womb, as a result of laceration by a previous child-birth,\r\nis frequently enlarged, thus allowing conception to take place very\r\nreadily, and hence she has children in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nBesides the wrong to the mother in having children in such rapid\r\nsuccession, it is a great injustice to the babe in the womb and the one at\r\nthe breast that they should follow each other so quickly that one is\r\nconceived while the other is nursing. One takes the vitality of the other;\r\nneither has sufficient nourishment, and both are started in life stunted\r\nand incomplete.\r\n\r\n9. \"THE DESIRABILITY AND PRACTICABILITY of limiting offspring,\" says Dr.\r\nStockham, \"are the subject of frequent inquiry. Fewer and better children\r\nare desired by right-minded parents. Many men and women, wise in other\r\nthings of the world, permit generation as a chance result of copulation,\r\nwithout thought of physical or mental conditions to be transmitted to the\r\nchild. Coition, the one important act of all others, carrying with it the\r\nmost vital results, is usually committed for selfish gratification. Many a\r\ndrunkard owes his life-long appetite for alcohol to the fact that the\r\ninception of his life could be traced to a night of dissipation on the part\r\nof his father. Physical degeneracy and mental derangements are too often\r\ncaused by the parents producing offspring while laboring under great mental\r\nstrain or bodily fatigue. Drunkenness and licentiousness are frequently the\r\nheritage of posterity. Future generations demand that such results be\r\naverted by better pre-natal influences. The world is groaning under the\r\ncurse of chance parenthood. It is due to posterity that procreation be\r\nbrought under the control of reason and conscience.\r\n\r\n10. \"IT HAS BEEN FEARED THAT A KNOWLEDGE of means to prevent conception\r\nwould, if generally diffused, be abused by women; that they would to so\r\ngreat an extent escape motherhood as to bring about social disaster. This\r\nfear is not well founded. The maternal instinct is inherent and sovereign\r\nin woman. Even the pre-natal influences of a murderous intent on the part\r\nof parents scarcely ever {243} eradicate it. With this natural desire for\r\nchildren, we believe few women would abuse the knowledge or privilege of\r\ncontrolling conception. Although women shrink from forced maternity, and\r\nfrom the bearing of children under the great burden of suffering, as well\r\nas other adverse conditions, it is rare to find a woman who is not greatly\r\ndisappointed if she does not, some time in her life, wear the crown of\r\nmotherhood.\r\n\r\n\"An eminent lady teacher, in talking to her pupils, once said: 'The\r\ngreatest calamity that can befall a woman is never to have a child. The\r\nnext greatest calamity is to have one only.' From my professional\r\nexperience I am happy to testify that more women seek to overcome causes of\r\nsterility than to obtain knowledge of limiting the size of the family or\r\nmeans to destroy the embryo. Also, if consultation for the latter is\r\nsought, it is usually at the instigation of the husband. Believing in the\r\nrights of unborn children, and in the maternal instinct, I am consequently\r\nconvinced that no knowledge should be withheld that will secure proper\r\nconditions for the best parenthood.\r\n\r\n11. \"MANY OF THE MEANS USED TO PREVENT conception are injurious, and often\r\nlay the foundation for a train of physical ailments. Probably no one means\r\nis more serious in its results than the practice of withdrawal, or the\r\ndischarge of the semen externally to the vagina. The act is incomplete and\r\nunnatural, and is followed by results similar to and as disastrous as those\r\nconsequent upon _masturbation_. In the male it may result in impotence, in\r\nthe female in sterility. In both sexes many nervous symptoms are produced,\r\nsuch as headache, defective vision, dyspepsia, insomnia, loss of memory,\r\netc. Very many cases of uterine diseases can be attributed solely to this\r\npractice. The objection to the use of the syringe is that if the sperm has\r\npassed into the uterus the fluid cannot reach it. A cold fluid may, in some\r\ninstances, produce contractions to throw it off, but cannot be relied\r\nupon.\"\r\n\r\n12. IS IT EVER RIGHT TO PREVENT CONCEPTION? We submit the following case of\r\nthe _Juke_ family, mostly of New York State, as related by R. L. Dugdale,\r\nwhen a member of the Prison Association, and let the reader judge for\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"It was traced out by painstaking research that from one woman called\r\nMargaret, who, like Topsy, merely 'growed' without pedigree as a pauper in\r\na village on the upper Hudson, about eighty-five years ago, there descended\r\n673 {244} children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, of whom 200\r\nwere criminals of the dangerous class, 280 adult paupers, and fifty\r\nprostitutes, while 300 children of her lineage died prematurely. The last\r\nfact proves to what extent in this family nature was kind to the rest of\r\nhumanity in saving it from a still larger aggregation of undesirable and\r\ncostly members, for it is estimated that the expense to the State of the\r\ndescendants of Maggie was over a million dollars, and the State itself did\r\nsomething also towards preventing a greater expense by the restrain\r\nexercised upon the criminals, paupers, and idiots of the family during a\r\nconsiderable portion of their lives.\"\r\n\r\n13. THE LEGAL ASPECT.--By the Revised Statutes of the United States it is\r\nprovided \"that no obscene, * * * or lascivious book, picture, or any\r\narticle or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or\r\nproducing of abortion shall be carried in the mail, and any person who\r\nshall knowingly deposit or cause to be deposited for mailing or delivery\r\nany of the hereinbefore mentioned things shall be guilty of misdemeanor,\"\r\netc. In New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and District of Columbia\r\nwe find no local law against abortion. Nine states, viz.: New Hampshire,\r\nConnecticut, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin, Dakotas, Wyoming and California\r\npunish the woman upon whom the abortion is attempted; while Massachusetts,\r\nNew York, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Kansas and California punish\r\nthe advertising or furnishing of means for the prevention of conception;\r\nand Ohio makes it a crime to even have such means in one's possession.\r\nThere is exception made in favor of every case where the early birth of the\r\ninfant is necessary to save the life of the mother. It will be noticed that\r\nthe common law punishes the furnishing or advertising of means for the\r\nprevention of conception, and hence regards it as a crime. There is,\r\nhowever, no ban of the civil law on Nature's law as laid down by Nature's\r\nGod and discovered by medical science, which we here make known.\r\n\r\n14. IS NATURE'S METHOD RELIABLE?--Dr. Cowan says: \"Sexual excitement\r\nhastens the premature ripening and meeting of the germ cell with the sperm\r\ncell, and impregnation may result, although intercourse occurs only in the\r\nspecified two weeks' absence of the egg from the uterus.\"\r\n\r\nThis is just possible under certain peculiar circumstances of diseased\r\nconditions, or after long separation of husband and wife. However, it\r\nseldom happens, and married people in normal health, temperate in the\r\nsexual relation, desirous of controlling the size of their family, can\r\nusually depend upon this law.\r\n\r\n{245}\r\n\r\n15. MODERATION.--Continence, self-control, a willingness to deny\r\nhimself--that is what is required from the husband. But a thousand voices\r\nreach us from suffering women in all parts of the land that this will not\r\nsuffice; that men refuse thus to restrain themselves; that it leads to a\r\nloss of domestic happiness and to illegal amour, or it is injurious\r\nphysically and morally; that, in short, such advice is useless because\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\n16. NATURE'S METHOD.--To such we reply that Nature herself has provided, to\r\nsome extent, against over-production, and that it is well to avail\r\nourselves of her provision. It is well known that women, when nursing,\r\nrarely become pregnant, and for this reason, if for no other, women should\r\nnurse their own children, and continue the period until the child is at\r\nleast nine months or a year old. However, the nursing, if continued too\r\nlong, weakens both the mother and the child, and, moreover, ceases to\r\naccomplish the end for which we now recommend it.\r\n\r\n17. ANOTHER PROVISION OF NATURE.--For a certain period between her monthly\r\nillness, every woman is sterile. Conception may be avoided by refraining\r\nfrom coition except for this particular number of days, and there will be\r\nno evasion of natural intercourse, no resort to disgusting practices, and\r\nnothing degrading. The following facts have been established, without a\r\ndoubt: The Graafian Vesicle, containing the egg in the ovary, enlarges\r\nduring menstruation and bursts open to let the egg escape usually on the\r\nfirst day after the flow ceases, and seldom, if ever, later than the fourth\r\nday. It then takes from two to six days for the egg to pass down through\r\nthe Fallopian tube into the womb, where it remains from two to six days,\r\nwhen, if not impregnated, it passes down through the vagina from the body.\r\nAfter the egg has passed from the body, conception is not possible until\r\nafter the next menstrual flow.\r\n\r\nThe period, therefore, from after the sixteenth to within three days of the\r\nfollowing menstrual discharge is one of almost absolute safety. We say\r\nwithin three days of the next menstruation, because the male seminal fluid\r\nmay be retained there till the egg leaves the ovary, and in that way\r\nimpregnation might follow. Impregnation would, however, rarely occur if the\r\nperiod was extended to from the twelfth day after menstruation close up to\r\none day before it began again.\r\n\r\nThe above is the only physiological method (and it is no secret to a great\r\nmany people) by which conception can be limited, without the employment of\r\nsuch means as involve danger and serious evils.\r\n\r\n18. WARNING.--Let women be warned in the most emphatic manner against the\r\nemployment of the secret methods constantly advertised by quacks. Such\r\nmeans are the almost certain cause of painful uterine diseases and of\r\nshortened life. They are productive of more misery by far than\r\nover-production itself.\r\n\r\n{246}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [1]New Revelation for Women.]\r\n\r\nVAGINAL CLEANLINESS.\r\n\r\n1. The above Syringe has a patent tube known as the vaginal cleanser. This\r\nkeeps the sides of the vagina apart and permits the water to thoroughly\r\nclean and cleanse the organ. It will be found a great relief in both health\r\nand sickness, and in many cases cure barrenness and other diseases of the\r\nwomb. It can be used the same as any other syringe. The tube can be\r\nprocured at almost any drug store and applied to either bulb or fountain\r\nsyringe. Many women are barren on account of an acid secretion in the\r\nvagina. The cleanser is almost a certain remedy and cure.\r\n\r\n2. CLEANLINESS.--Cleanliness is next to godliness. Without cleanliness the\r\nhuman body is more or less defiled and repulsive. A hint to the wise is\r\nsufficient. The vagina should be cleansed with the same faithfulness as any\r\nother portion of the body.\r\n\r\n3. TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER.--Those not accustomed to use vaginal\r\ninjections would do well to use water milk-warm at the commencement; after\r\nthis the temperature may be varied according to circumstances. In case of\r\nlocal inflammation use hot water. The indiscriminate use of cold water\r\ninjections will be found rather injurious than beneficial, and a woman in\r\nfeeble health will always find warm water invigorating and preferable.\r\n\r\n{247}\r\n\r\n4. LEUCORRHOEA.--In case of persistent leucorrhoea use the temperature of\r\nwater from seventy-two to eighty-five degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n5. THE CLEANSER will greatly stimulate the health and spirits of any woman\r\nwho uses it. Pure water injections have a stimulating effect, and it seems\r\nto invigorate the entire body.\r\n\r\n6. SALT AND WATER INJECTIONS.--This will cure mild cases of leucorrhoea.\r\nAdd a teaspoonful of salt to a pint and a half of water at the proper\r\ntemperature. Injections may be repeated daily if deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n7. SOAP AND WATER.--Soap and water is a very simple domestic remedy, and\r\nwill many times afford relief in many diseases of the womb. It seems it\r\nthoroughly cleanses the parts. A little borax or vinegar may be used the\r\nsame as salt water injections. (See No. 6.)\r\n\r\n8. STERILE WOMEN desiring offspring should seek sexual union soon after the\r\nappearance of the menses, and not use the vaginal cleanser till several\r\ndays later. Those not desiring offspring should avoid copulation until the\r\novum has passed the generative tract.\r\n\r\n9. HOLES IN THE TUBES.--Most of the holes in the tubes of syringes are too\r\nsmall. See that they are sufficiently large to produce thorough cleansing.\r\n\r\n10. INJECTIONS DURING THE MONTHLY FLOW.--Of course it is not proper to\r\narrest the flow, and the injections will stimulate a healthy action of the\r\norgans. The injections may be used daily throughout the monthly flow with\r\nmuch comfort and benefit. If the flow is scanty and painful the injections\r\nmay be as warm as they can be comfortably borne. If the flowing is\r\nimmoderate, then cool water may be used. A woman will soon learn her own\r\ncondition and can act accordingly.\r\n\r\n11. BLOOM AND GRACE OF YOUTH.--The regular bathing of the body will greatly\r\nimprove woman's beauty. Remember that a perfect complexion depends upon the\r\nhealthy action of all the organs. Vaginal injections are just as important\r\nas the bath. A beautiful woman must not only be cleanly, but robust and\r\nhealthy. There can be no perfect beauty without good health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{248}\r\n\r\nIMPOTENCE AND STERILITY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trying On a New Dress.]\r\n\r\n1. Actual impotence during the period of manhood is a very rare complaint,\r\nand nature very unwillingly, and only after the absolute neglect of\r\nsanitary laws, gives up the power of reproduction.\r\n\r\n2. Not only sensual women, but all without exception, feel deeply hurt, and\r\nare repelled by the husband whom they may previously have loved dearly,\r\nwhen, after entering the married state, they find that he is impotent. The\r\nmore inexperienced and innocent they were at the time of marriage, the\r\nlonger it often is before they find that something is lacking in the\r\nhusband; but, once knowing this, the wife infallibly has a feeling of\r\ncontempt and aversion for him; though there are many happy families where\r\nthis defect exists. It is often very uncertain who is the weak one, and no\r\ncause for separation should be sought.\r\n\r\n3. Unhappy marriages, barrenness, divorces, and perchance an occasional\r\nsuicide, may be prevented by the experienced physician, who can generally\r\ngive correct information, comfort, and consolation, when consulted on these\r\ndelicate matters.\r\n\r\n4. When a single man fears that he is unable to fulfill the duties of\r\nmarriage, he should not marry until his fear is dispelled. The suspicion of\r\nsuch a fear strongly tends to bring about the very weakness which he\r\ndreads. Go to a good physician (not to one of those quacks whose {249}\r\nadvertisements you see in the papers; they are invariably unreliable), and\r\nstate the case fully and freely.\r\n\r\n5. Diseases, malformation, etc., may cause impotence. In case of\r\nmalformation there is usually no remedy, but in case of disease it is\r\nusually within the reach of a skillful physician.\r\n\r\n6. Self-abuse and spermatorrhoea produce usually only temporary impotence\r\nand can generally be relieved by carrying out the instructions given\r\nelsewhere in this book.\r\n\r\n7. Excessive indulgences often enfeeble the powers and often result in\r\nimpotence. Dissipated single men, professional libertines, and married men\r\nwho are immoderate, often pay the penalty of their violations of the laws\r\nof nature, by losing their vital power. In such cases of excess there may\r\nbe some temporary relief, but as age advances the effects of such\r\nindiscretion will become more and more manifest.\r\n\r\n8. The condition of sterility in man may arise either from a condition of\r\nthe secretion which deprives it of its fecundating powers or it may spring\r\nfrom a malformation which prevents it reaching the point where fecundation\r\ntakes place. The former condition is most common in old age, and is a\r\nsequence of venereal disease, or from a change in the structure or\r\nfunctions of the glands. The latter has its origin in a stricture, or in an\r\ninjury, or in that condition technically known as hypospadias, or in\r\ndebility.\r\n\r\n9. It can be safely said that neither self-indulgence nor spermatorrhoea\r\noften leads to permanent sterility.\r\n\r\n10. It is sometimes, however, possible, even where there is sterility in\r\nthe male, providing the secretion is not entirely devoid of life properties\r\non part of the husband, to have children, but these are exceptions.\r\n\r\n11. No man need hesitate about matrimony on account of sterility, unless\r\nthat condition arises from a permanent and absolute degeneration of his\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n12. Impotence from mental and moral causes often takes place. Persons of\r\nhighly nervous organization may suffer incapacity in their sexual organs.\r\nThe remedy for these difficulties is rest and change of occupation.\r\n\r\n13. REMEDIES IN CASE OF IMPOTENCE ON ACCOUNT OF FORMER PRIVATE DISEASES, OR\r\nMASTURBATION, OR OTHER CAUSES.--First build up the body by taking some good\r\nstimulating tonics. The general health is the most essential feature to be\r\nconsidered, in order to secure restoration of the sexual powers.\r\nConstipation must be carefully avoided. If the {250} kidneys do not work in\r\ngood order, some remedy for their restoration must be taken. Take plenty of\r\nout-door exercise, avoid horseback riding or heavy exhaustive work.\r\n\r\n14. FOOD AND DRINKS WHICH WEAKEN DESIRE.--All kinds of food which cause\r\ndyspepsia or bring on constipation, diarrhoea, or irritate the bowels,\r\nalcoholic beverages, or any indigestible compound, has the tendency to\r\nweaken the sexual power. Drunkards and tipplers suffer early loss of\r\nvitality. Beer drinking has a tendency to irritate the stomach and to that\r\nextent affects the private organs.\r\n\r\n15. COFFEE.--Coffee drank excessively causes a debilitating effect upon the\r\nsexual organs. The moderate use of coffee can be recommended, yet an\r\nexcessive habit of drinking very strong coffee will sometimes wholly\r\ndestroy vitality.\r\n\r\n16. TOBACCO.--It is a hygienic and physiological fact that tobacco produces\r\nsexual debility and those who suffer any weakness from that source should\r\ncarefully avoid the weed in all its forms.\r\n\r\n17. DRUGS WHICH STIMULATE DESIRE.--There are certain medicines which act\r\nlocally on the membranes and organs of the male, and the papers are full of\r\nadvertisements of \"Lost Manhood Restored\", etc., but in every case they are\r\nworthless or dangerous drugs and certain to lead to some painful malady or\r\ndeath. All these patent medicines should be carefully avoided. People who\r\nare troubled with any of these ailments should not attempt to doctor\r\nthemselves by taking drugs, but a competent physician should be consulted.\r\nEating rye, corn, or graham bread, oatmeal, cracked wheat, plenty of fruit,\r\netc. is a splendid medicine. If that is not sufficient, then a physician\r\nshould be consulted.\r\n\r\n18. DRUGS WHICH MODERATE DESIRE.--Among one of the most common domestic\r\nremedies is camphor. This has stood the test for ages. Small doses of half\r\na grain in most instances diminishes the sensibility of the organs of sex.\r\nIn some cases it produces irritation of the bladder. In that case it should\r\nbe at once discontinued. On the whole a physician had better be consulted.\r\nThe safest drug among domestic remedies is a strong tea made out of hops.\r\nSaltpeter, or nitrate of potash, taken in moderate quantities, are very\r\ngood remedies.\r\n\r\n{251}\r\n\r\n19. STRICTLY SPEAKING there is a distinction made between _impotence_ and\r\n_sterility_. _Impotence_ is a loss of power to engage in the sexual act and\r\nis common to men. It may be imperfection in the male organ or a lack of\r\nsufficient sexual vigor to produce and maintain erection. _Sterility_ is a\r\ntotal loss of capacity in the reproduction of the species, and is common to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, very few causes of barrenness that cannot be removed\r\nwhen the patient is perfectly developed. Sterility, in a female, most\r\nfrequently depends upon a weakness or irritability either in the ovaries or\r\nthe womb, and anything having a strengthening effect upon either organ will\r\nremove the disability. (See page 249.)\r\n\r\n20. \"OVER-INDULGENCE in intercourse,\" says Dr. Hoff, \"is sometimes the\r\ncause of barrenness; this is usually puzzling to the interested parties,\r\ninasmuch as the practices which, in their opinion, should be the source of\r\na numerous progeny, have the very opposite effect. By greatly moderating\r\ntheir ardor, this defect may be remedied.\"\r\n\r\n21. \"NAPOLEON AND JOSEPHINE.--A certain adaptation between the male and\r\nfemale has been regarded as necessary to conception, consisting of some\r\nmysterious influence which one sex exerts over the other, neither one,\r\nhowever, being essentially impotent or sterile. The man may impregnate one\r\nwoman and not another, and the woman will conceive by one man and not by\r\nanother. In the marriage of Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine no children\r\nwere born, but after he had separated from the Empress and wedded Maria\r\nLouisa of Austria, an heir soon came. Yet Josephine had children by\r\nBeauharnais, her previous husband. But as all is not known as to the\r\nphysical condition of Josephine during her second marriage, it cannot be\r\nassumed that mere lack of adaptability was the cause of unfruitfulness\r\nbetween them. There may have been some cause that history has not recorded,\r\nor unknown to the state of medical science of those days. There are\r\ndoubtless many cases of apparently causeless unfruitfulness in marriage\r\nthat even physicians, with a knowledge of all apparent conditions in the\r\nparties, cannot explain; but when, as elsewhere related in this volume,\r\nimpregnation by artificial means is successfully practised, it is useless\r\nto attribute barrenness to purely psychological and adaptative influences.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{252}\r\n\r\nProducing Boys or Girls at Will.\r\n\r\n1. CAN THE SEXES BE PRODUCED AT WILL?--This question has been asked in all\r\nages of the world. Many theories have been advanced, but science has at\r\nlast replied with some authority. The following are the best known\r\nauthorities which this age of science has produced.\r\n\r\n2. THE AGRICULTURAL THEORY.--The agricultural theory, as it may be called,\r\nbecause adopted by farmers, is that impregnation occurring within four days\r\nof the close of the female monthlies produces a girl, because the ovum is\r\nyet immature; but that when it occurs after the fourth day from its close,\r\ngives a boy, because this egg is now mature; whereas after about the eighth\r\nday this egg dissolves and passes off, so that impregnation is thereby\r\nrendered impossible, till just before the mother's next monthly.--_Sexual\r\nScience._\r\n\r\n3. QUEEN BEES LAY FEMALE EGGS FIRST, and male afterwards. So with hens; the\r\nfirst eggs laid after the tread give females, the last males. Mares shown\r\nthe stallion late in their periods drop horse colts rather than\r\nfillies.--_Napheys._\r\n\r\n4. IF YOU WISH FEMALES, give the male at the first sign of heat; if males,\r\nat its end.--_Prof. Thury._\r\n\r\n5. ON TWENTY-TWO SUCCESSIVE OCCASIONS I desired to have heifers, and\r\nsucceeded in every case. I have made in all twenty-nine experiments, after\r\nthis method, and succeeded in every one, in producing the sex I\r\ndesired.--_A Swiss Breeder._\r\n\r\n6. THIS THURY PLAN has been tried on the farms of the Emperor of the French\r\nwith unvarying success.\r\n\r\n7. CONCEPTION IN THE FIRST HALF of the time between the menstrual periods\r\nproduces females, and males is the latter.--_London Lancet._\r\n\r\n8. INTERCOURSE in from two to six days after cessation of the menses\r\nproduces girls, in from nine to twelve, boys.--_Medical Reporter._\r\n\r\n9. THE MOST MALE POWER and passion creates boys; female girls. This law\r\nprobably causes those agricultural facts just cited thus: Conception right\r\nafter menstruation give girls, because the female is then the most\r\nimpassioned; later, boys, because her wanting sexual warmth leaves him the\r\nmost vigorous. Mere sexual excitement, a wild, fierce, furious rush of\r\npassion, is not only not sexual vigor, but in its inverse ratio; and a\r\ngenuine insane fervor caused by weakness; just as a like nervous\r\nexcitability indicates weak nerves instead of strong. Sexual power is\r\ndeliberate, not wild; cool, not impetuous; while all false excitement\r\ndiminishes effectiveness.--_Fowler._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{253}\r\n\r\nABORTION OR MISCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEALTHY CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\n1. ABORTION OR MISCARRIAGE is the expulsion of the child from the womb\r\nprevious to six months; after that it is called premature birth.\r\n\r\n2. CAUSES.--It may be due to a criminal act of taking medicine for the\r\nexpress purpose of producing miscarriage or it may be caused by certain\r\nmedicines, severe sickness or nervousness, syphilis, imperfect semen, lack\r\nof room in the pelvis and abdomen, lifting, straining, violent cold, sudden\r\nmental excitement, excessive sexual intercourse, dancing, tight lacing, the\r\nuse of strong purgative medicines, bodily fatigue, late suppers, and\r\nfashionable amusements.\r\n\r\n3. SYMPTOMS.--A falling or weakness and uneasiness in the region of the\r\nloins, thighs and womb, pain in the small {254} of the back, vomiting and\r\nsickness of the stomach, chilliness with a discharge of blood accompanied\r\nwith pain in the lower portions of the abdomen. These may take place in a\r\nsingle hour, or it may continue for several days. If before the fourth\r\nmonth, there is not so much danger, but the flow of blood is generally\r\ngreater. If miscarriage is the result of an accident, it generally takes\r\nplace without much warning, and the service of a physician should at once\r\nbe secured.\r\n\r\n4. HOME TREATMENT.--A simple application of cold water externally applied\r\nwill produce relief, or cold cloths of ice, if convenient, applied to the\r\nlower portions of the abdomen. Perfect quiet, however, is the most\r\nessential thing for the patient. She should lie on her back and take\r\ninternally a teaspoonful of paregoric every two hours; drink freely of\r\nlemonade or other cooling drinks, and for nourishment subsist chiefly on\r\nchicken broth, toast, water gruel, fresh fruits, etc. The principal\r\nhomeopathic remedies for this disease are ergot and cimicifuga, given in\r\ndrop-doses of the tinctures.\r\n\r\n5. INJURIOUS EFFECTS.--Miscarriage is a very serious difficulty, and the\r\nhealth and the constitution may be permanently impaired. Any one prone to\r\nmiscarriage should adopt every measure possible to strengthen and build up\r\nthe system; avoid going up stairs or doing much heavy lifting or hard work.\r\n\r\n6. PREVENTION.--Practice the laws of sexual abstinence, take frequent\r\nsitz-baths, live on oatmeal, graham bread, and other nourishing diet. Avoid\r\nhighly seasoned food, rich gravies, late suppers and the like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{255}\r\n\r\nThe Murder of the Innocents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN FAMILY. The Savage Indian Teaches Us Lessons of\r\nCivilization.]\r\n\r\n1. MANY CAUSES.--Many causes have operated to produce a corruption of the\r\npublic morals so deplorable; prominent among which may be mentioned the\r\nfacility with which divorces may be obtained in some of the States, the\r\nconstant promulgation of false ideas of marriage and its duties by means of\r\nbooks, lectures, etc., and the distribution through the mails of impure\r\npublications. But an influence not less powerful than any of these is the\r\ngrowing devotion of fashion and luxury of this age, and the idea which\r\npractically obtains to so great an extent that pleasure, instead of the\r\nhealth or morals, is the great object of life.\r\n\r\n2. A MONSTROUS CRIME.--The abiding interest we feel in the preservation of\r\nthe morals of our country, constrains us to raise our voice against the\r\ndaily increasing practice of {256} infanticide, especially before birth.\r\nThe notoriety this monstrous crime has obtained of late, and the hecatombs\r\nof infants that are annually sacrificed to Moloch, to gratify an unlawful\r\npassion, are a sufficient justification for our alluding to a painful and\r\ndelicate subject, which should \"not even be named,\" only to correct and\r\nadmonish the wrong-doers.\r\n\r\n3. LOCALITIES IN WHICH IT IS MOST PREVALENT.--We may observe that the\r\ncrying sin of infanticide is most prevalent in those localities where the\r\nsystem of moral education has been longest neglected. This inhuman crime\r\nmight be compared to the murder of the innocents, except that the\r\ncriminals, in this case, exceed in enormity the cruelty of Herod.\r\n\r\n4. SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD.--If it is a sin to take away the life even of\r\nan enemy; if the crime of shedding innocent blood cries to heaven for\r\nvengeance; in what language can we characterize the double guilt of those\r\nwhose souls are stained with the innocent blood of their own unborn,\r\nunregenerated offspring?\r\n\r\n5. THE GREATNESS OF THE CRIME.--The murder of an infant before its birth,\r\nis, in the sight of God and the law, as great a crime as the killing of a\r\nchild after birth.\r\n\r\n6. LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY.--Every State of the Union has made this offense\r\none of the most serious crimes. The law has no mercy for the offenders that\r\nviolate the sacred law of human life. It is murder of the most cowardly\r\ncharacter and woe to him who brings this curse upon his head, to haunt him\r\nall the days of his or her life, and to curse him at the day of his death.\r\n\r\n7. THE PRODUCT OF LUST.--Lust pure and simple. The only difference between\r\na marriage of this character and prostitution is, that society, rotten to\r\nits heart, pulpits afraid to cry aloud against crime and vice, and the\r\nchurch conformed to the world, have made such a profanation of marriage\r\nrespectable. To put it in other words, when two people determine to live\r\ntogether as husband and wife, and evade the consequences and\r\nresponsibilities of marriage, they are simply engaged in prostitution\r\nwithout the infamy which attaches to that vice and crime.\r\n\r\n8. OUTRAGEOUS VIOLATION OF ALL LAW.--The violation of all law, both natural\r\nand revealed, is the cool and villainous contract by which people entering\r\ninto the marital relation engage in defiance of the laws of God and the\r\nlaws of the commonwealth, that they shall be unincumbered with a family of\r\nchildren. \"Disguise the matter as you will,\" says Dr. Pomeroy, \"yet the\r\nfact remains that the first and {257} specific object of marriage is the\r\nrearing of a family.\" \"Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth,\"\r\nis God's first word to Adam after his creation.\r\n\r\n9. THE NATIONAL SIN.--The prevention of offspring is preeminently the sin\r\nof America. It is fast becoming the national sin of America, and if it is\r\nnot checked, it will sooner or later be an irremediable calamity. The sin\r\nhas its roots in a low and perverted idea of marriage, and is fostered by\r\nfalse standards of modesty.\r\n\r\n10. THE SIN OF HEROD.--Do these same white-walled sepulchres of hell know\r\nthat they are committing the damning sin of Herod in the slaughter of the\r\ninnocents, and are accessories before the fact to the crime of murder? Do\r\nwomen in all circles of society, when practicing these terrible crimes\r\nrealize the real danger? Do they understand that it is undermining their\r\nhealth, and their constitution, and that their destiny, if persisted in, is\r\na premature grave just as sure as the sun rises in the heavens? Let all\r\nbeware, and let the first and only purpose be, to live a life guiltless\r\nbefore God and man.\r\n\r\n11. THE CRIME OF ABORTION.--From the moment of conception a new life\r\ncommences; a new individual exists; another child is added to the family.\r\nThe mother who deliberately sets about to destroy this life, either by want\r\nof care, or by taking drugs, or using instruments, commits as great a\r\ncrime, and is just as guilty as if she strangled her new-born infant or as\r\nif she snatched from her own breast her six months' darling and dashed out\r\nits brains against the wall. Its blood is upon her head, and as sure as\r\nthere is a God and a judgment, that blood will be required of her. The\r\ncrime she commits is murder, child murder--the slaughter of a speechless,\r\nhelpless being, whom it is her duty, beyond all things else, to cherish and\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\n12. DANGEROUS DISEASES.--We appeal to all such with earnest and with\r\nthreatening words. If they have no feeling for the fruit of their womb, if\r\nmaternal sentiment is so callous in their breasts, let them know that such\r\nproduced abortions are the constant cause of violent and dangerous womb\r\ndiseases, and frequently of early death; that they bring on mental\r\nweakness, and often insanity; that they are the most certain means to\r\ndestroy domestic happiness which can be adopted. Better, far better, to\r\nbear a child every year for twenty years than to resort to such a wicked\r\nand injurious step; better to die, if need be, in the pangs of child-birth,\r\nthan to live with such a weight of sin on the conscience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{258}\r\n\r\nThe Unwelcome Child.[2]\r\n\r\n1. TOO OFTEN THE HUSBAND thinks only of his personal gratification; he\r\ninsists upon what he calls his rights (?); forces on his wife an _unwelcome\r\nchild_, and thereby often alienates her affections, if he does not drive\r\nher to abortion.\r\n\r\nDr Stockham reports the following case: \"A woman once consulted me who was\r\nthe mother of five children, all born within ten years. These were puny,\r\nscrofulous, nervous and irritable. She herself was a fit subject for\r\ndoctors and drugs. Every organ in her body seemed diseased, and every\r\nfunction perverted. She was dragging out a miserable existence. Like other\r\nphysicians, I had prescribed in vain for her many maladies. One day she\r\nchanced to inquire how she could safely prevent conception. This led me to\r\nask how great was the danger. She said: 'Unless my husband is absent from\r\nhome, few nights have been exempt since we were married, except it may be\r\nthree or four immediately after confinement.'\r\n\r\n\"'And yet your husband loves you?'\r\n\r\n\"'O, yes, he is kind and provides for his family. Perhaps I might love him\r\nbut for this. While now--(will God forgive me?)--_I detest, I loathe him_,\r\nand if I knew how to support myself and children, I would leave him.'\r\n\r\n\"'Can you talk with him upon this subject?'\r\n\r\n\"'I think I can.'\r\n\r\n\"' Then there is hope, for many women cannot do that. Tell him I will give\r\nyou treatment to improve your health, and if he will wait until you can\r\nrespond, _take time for the act, have it entirely mutual from first to\r\nlast_, the demand will not come so frequent.'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you think so?'\r\n\r\n\"'The experience of many proves the truth of this statement.'\r\n\r\n\"Hopefully she went home, and in six months I had the satisfaction of\r\nknowing my patient was restored to health, and a single coition in a month\r\ngave the husband more satisfaction than the many had done previously, that\r\nthe creative power was under control, and that my lady could proudly say 'I\r\nlove,' where previously she said 'I hate.'\r\n\r\n\"If husbands will listen, a few simple instructions will {259} appeal to\r\ntheir _common sense_, and none can imagine the gain to themselves, to their\r\nwives and children, and their children's children. Then it may not be said\r\nof the babes that the 'Death borders on their birth, and their cradle\r\nstands in the grave.'\"\r\n\r\n2. WIVES! BE FRANK AND TRUE to your husbands on the subject of maternity,\r\nand the relation that leads to it. Interchange thoughts and feelings with\r\nthem as to what nature allows or demands in regard to these. Can maternity\r\nbe natural when it is undesigned by the father or undesired by the mother?\r\nCan a maternity be natural, healthful, ennobling to the mother, to the\r\nchild, to the father, and to the home, when no loving, tender, anxious\r\nforethought presides over the relation in which it originated?--when the\r\nmother's nature loathed and repelled it, and the father's only thought was\r\nhis own selfish gratification; the feelings and conditions of the mother,\r\nand the health, character and destiny of the child that may result being\r\nignored by him. Wives! let there be a perfect and loving understanding\r\nbetween you and your husbands on these matters, and great will be your\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n3. A WOMAN WRITES:--\"There are few, very few, wives and mothers who could\r\nnot reveal a sad, dark picture in their own experience in their relations\r\nto their husbands and their children. Maternity, and the relation in which\r\nit originates, are thrust upon them by their husbands, often without regard\r\nto their spiritual or physical conditions, and often in contempt of their\r\nearnest and urgent entreaties. No joy comes to their heart at the\r\nconception and birth of their children, except that which arises from the\r\nconsciousness that they have survived the sufferings wantonly and selfishly\r\ninflicted upon them.\"\r\n\r\n4. HUSBAND, WHEN MATERNITY is imposed on your wife without her consent, and\r\ncontrary to her appeal, how will her mind necessarily be affected towards\r\nher child? It was conceived in dread and in bitterness of spirit. Every\r\nstage of its foetal development is watched with feeling of settled\r\nrepugnance. In every step of its ante-natal progress the child meets only\r\nwith grief and indignation in the mother. She would crush out its life, if\r\nshe could. She loathed its conception; she loathed it in every stage of its\r\nante-natal development. Instead of fixing her mind on devising ways and\r\nmeans for the healthful and happy organization and {260} development of her\r\nchild before it is born, and for its postnatal comfort and support, her\r\nsoul may be intent on its destruction, and her thoughts devise plans to\r\nkill it. In this, how often is she aided by others! There are those, and\r\nthey are called men and women, whose profession is to devise ways to kill\r\nchildren before they are born. Those who do this would not hesitate (but\r\nfor the consequences) to kill them after they are born, for the state of\r\nmind that would justify and instigate _ante-natal_ child-murder would\r\njustify and instigate _post-natal_ child-murder. Yet, public sentiment\r\nconsigns the murderer of post-natal children to the dungeon or the gallows,\r\nwhile the murderers of ante-natal children are often allowed to pass in\r\nsociety as honest and honorable men and women.\r\n\r\n5. THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT from a letter written by one who has proudly\r\nand nobly filled the station of a wife and mother, and whose children and\r\ngrandchildren surround her and crown her life with tenderest love and\r\nrespect:\r\n\r\n\"It has often been a matter of wonder to me that men should, so heedlessly,\r\nand so injuriously to themselves, their wives and children, and their\r\nhomes, demand at once, as soon as they get legal possession of their wives,\r\nthe gratification of a passion, which, when indulged merely for the sake of\r\nthe gratification of the moment, must end in the destruction of all that is\r\nbeautiful, noble and divine in man or woman. I have often felt that I would\r\ngive the world for a friendship with man that should show no impurity in\r\nits bearing, and for a conjugal relation that would, at all times, heartily\r\nand practically recognize the right of the wife to decide for herself when\r\nshe should enter into the relation that leads to maternity.\"\r\n\r\n6. TIMELY ADVICE.--Here let me say that on no subject should a man and\r\nwoman, as they are being attracted into conjugal relations, be more open\r\nand truthful with each other than on this. No woman, who would save herself\r\nand the man she loves from a desecrated and wretched home, should enter\r\ninto the physical relations of marriage with a man until she understands\r\nwhat he expects of her as to the function of maternity, and the relation\r\nthat leads to it. If a woman is made aware that the man who would win her\r\nas a wife regards her and the marriage relation only as the means of a\r\nlegalized gratification of his passions, and she sees fit to live with him\r\nas a wife, with such a prospect before her, she must take the consequences\r\nof a course so {261} degrading and so shameless. If she sees fit to make an\r\noffering of her body and soul on the altar of her husband's sensuality, she\r\nmust do it; but she has a right to know to what base uses her womanhood is\r\nto be put, and it is due to her, as well as to himself, that he should tell\r\nbeforehand precisely what he wants and expects of her.\r\n\r\nToo frequently, man shrinks from all allusion, during courtship, to his\r\nexpectations in regard to future passional relations. He fears to speak of\r\nthem, lest he should shock and repel the woman he would win as a wife.\r\nBeing conscious, it may be, of an intention to use power he may acquire\r\nover her person for his own gratification, he shuns all interchange of\r\nviews with her, lest she should divine the hidden sensualism of his soul,\r\nand his intention to victimize her person to it the moment he shall get the\r\nlicense. A woman had better die at once than enter into or continue in\r\nmarriage with a man whose highest conception of the relation is, that it is\r\na means of licensed animal indulgence. In such a relation, body and soul\r\nare sacrificed.\r\n\r\n7. ONE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC of a true and noble husband is a feeling\r\nof manly pride in the physical elements of his manhood. His physical\r\nmanhood, as well as his soul, is dear to the heart of his wife, because\r\nthrough this he can give the fullest expression of his manly power. How can\r\nyou, my friend, secure for your person the loving care and respect of your\r\nwife? There is but one way: so manifest yourself to her, in the hours of\r\nyour most endearing intimacies, that all your manly power shall be\r\nassociated only with all that is generous, just and noble in you, and with\r\npurity, freedom and happiness in her. Make her feel that all which\r\nconstitutes you a man, and qualifies you to be her husband and the father\r\nof her children, belongs to her, and is sacredly consecrated to the\r\nperfection and happiness of her nature. Do this, and the happiness of your\r\nhome is made complete. Your _body_ will be lovingly and reverently cared\r\nfor, because the wife of your bosom feels that it is the sacred symbol\r\nthrough which a noble, manly love is ever speaking to her, to cheer and\r\nsustain her.\r\n\r\n8. WOMAN IS EVER PROUD, and justly so, of the manly passion of her husband,\r\nwhen she knows it is controlled by a love for her, whose manifestations\r\nhave regard only to her elevation and happiness. The power which, when bent\r\nonly on selfish indulgence, becomes a source of more shame, degradation,\r\ndisease and wretchedness, to {262} women and to children than all other\r\nthings put together, does but ennoble her, add grace and glory to her\r\nbeing, and concentrate and vitalize the love that encircles her as a wife\r\nwhen it is controlled by wisdom and consecrated to her highest growth and\r\nhappiness, and that of her children. It lends enchantment to her person,\r\nand gives a fascination to her smiles, her words and her caresses, which\r\never breathe of purity and of heaven, and make her all lovely as a wife and\r\nmother to her husband and the father of her child. _Manly passion is to the\r\nconjugal love of the wife like the sun to the rose-bud, that opens its\r\npetals, and causes them to give out their sweetest fragrance and to display\r\ntheir most delicate tints; or like the frost, which chills and kills it ere\r\nit blossoms in its richness and beauty._\r\n\r\n9. A DIADEM OF BEAUTY.--Maternity, when it exists at the call of the wife,\r\nand is gratefully received, but binds her heart more tenderly and devotedly\r\nto her husband. As the father of her child, he stands before her invested\r\nwith new beauty and dignity. In receiving from him the germ of a new life,\r\nshe receives that which she feels is to add new beauty and glory to her as\r\na woman--a new grace and attraction to her as a wife. She loves and honors\r\nhim, because he has crowned her with the glory of a mother. Maternity, to\r\nher, instead of being repulsive, is a diadem of beauty, a crown of\r\nrejoicing; and deep, tender, and self-forgetting are her love and reverence\r\nfor him who has placed it on her brow. How noble, how august, how beautiful\r\nis maternity when thus bestowed and received!\r\n\r\n10. CONCLUSION.--Would you, then, secure the love and trust of your wife,\r\nand become an object of her ever-growing tenderness and reverence? Assure\r\nher, by all your manifestations, and your perfect respect for the functions\r\nof her nature, that your passion shall be in subjection of her wishes. It\r\nis not enough that you have secured in her heart respect for your spiritual\r\nand intellectual manhood. To maintain your self-respect in your relations\r\nwith her, to perfect your growth and happiness as a husband, you must cause\r\nyour _physical_ nature to be tenderly cherished and reverenced by her in\r\nall the sacred intimacies of home. No matter how much she reverences your\r\nintellectual or your social power, if by reason of your uncalled-for\r\npassional manifestations you have made your physical manhood disagreeable,\r\nhow can you, in her presence, preserve a sense of manly pride and dignity\r\nas a husband?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{263}\r\n\r\nHeredity and the Transmission of Diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEALTH AND DISEASE.]\r\n\r\n1. BAD HABITS.--It is known that the girl who marries the man with bad\r\nhabits, is, in a measure, responsible for the evil tendencies which these\r\nhabits have created in the children; and young people are constantly warned\r\nof the danger in marrying when they know they come from families troubled\r\nwith chronic diseases or insanity. To be sure the warnings have had little\r\neffect thus far in preventing such marriages, and it is doubtful whether\r\nthey will, unless the prophecy of an extremist writing for one of our\r\nperiodicals comes to pass--that the time is not far distant when such\r\nmarriages will be a crime punishable by law. {264}\r\n\r\n2. TENDENCY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.--That there is a tendency in the right\r\ndirection must be admitted, and is perhaps most clearly shown in some of\r\nthe articles on prison reform. Many of them strongly urge the necessity of\r\npreventive work as the truest economy, and some go so far as to say that if\r\nthe present human knowledge of the laws of heredity were acted upon for a\r\ngeneration, reformatory measures would be rendered unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.--The mother who has ruined her health by late\r\nhours, highly-spiced food, and general carelessness in regard to hygienic\r\nlaws, and the father who is the slave of questionable habits, will be very\r\nsure to have children either mentally or morally inferior to what they\r\nmight otherwise have had a right to expect. But the prenatal influences may\r\nbe such that evils arising from such may be modified to a great degree.\r\n\r\n4. FORMATION OF CHARACTER.--I believe that pre-natal influences may do as\r\nmuch in the formation of character as all the education that can come\r\nafter, and that the mother may, in a measure, \"will\" what that influence\r\nshall be, and that, as knowledge on the subject increases, it will be more\r\nand more under their control. In that, as in everything else, things that\r\nwould be possible with one mother would not be with another, and measures\r\nthat would be successful with one would produce opposite results from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n5. INHERITING DISEASE. Consumption--that dread foe of modern life--is the\r\nmost frequently encountered of all affections as the result of inherited\r\npredispositions. Indeed, some of the most eminent physicians have believed\r\nit is never produced in any other way. Heart disease, disease of the\r\nthroat, excessive obesity, affections of the skin, asthma, disorders of the\r\nbrain and nervous system, gout, rheumatism and cancer, are all hereditary.\r\nA tendency to bleed frequently, profusely and uncontrollably, from trifling\r\nwounds, is often met with as a family affection.\r\n\r\n6. MENTAL DERANGEMENTS.--Almost all forms of mental derangements are\r\nhereditary--one of the parents or near relation being afflicted. Physical\r\nor bodily weakness is often hereditary, such as scrofula, gout, rheumatism,\r\nrickets, consumption, apoplexy, hernia, urinary calculi, hemorrhoids or\r\npiles, cataract, etc. In fact, all physical weakness, if ingrafted in\r\neither parent, is transmitted from parents to offspring, and is often more\r\nstrongly marked in the latter than in the former.\r\n\r\n7. MARKS AND DEFORMITIES.--Marks and deformities are all transmissible from\r\nparents to offspring, equally with {265} diseases and peculiar\r\nproclivities. Among such blemishes may be mentioned moles, hair-lips,\r\ndeficient or supernumerary fingers, toes, and other characteristics. It is\r\nalso asserted that dogs and cats that have accidentally lost their tails,\r\nbring forth young similarly deformed. Blumenbach tells of a man who had\r\nlost his little finger, having children with the same deformity.\r\n\r\n8. CAUTION.--Taking facts like these into consideration, how very important\r\nis it for persons, before selecting partners for life, to deliberately\r\nweigh every element and circumstances of this nature, if they would insure\r\na felicitous union, and not entail upon their posterity disease, misery and\r\ndespair. Alas! in too many instances matrimony is made a matter of money,\r\nwhile all earthly joys are sacrificed upon the accursed altars of lust and\r\nmammon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{266}\r\n\r\nPreparation for Maternity.\r\n\r\n1. WOMAN BEFORE MARRIAGE.--It is not too much to say that the life of women\r\nbefore marriage ought to be adjusted with more reference to their duties as\r\nmothers than to any other one earthly object. It is the continuance of the\r\nrace which is the chief purpose of marriage. The passion of amativeness is\r\nprobably, on the whole, the most powerful of all human impulses. Its\r\npurpose, however, is rather to subserve the object of continuing the\r\nspecies, than merely its own gratification.\r\n\r\n2. EXERCISE.--Girls should be brought up to live much in the open air,\r\nalways with abundant clothing against wet and cold. They should be\r\nencouraged to take much active exercise; as much, if they want to, as boys.\r\nIt is as good for little girls to run and jump, to ramble in the woods, to\r\ngo boating, to ride and drive, to play and \"have fun\" generally, as for\r\nlittle boys.\r\n\r\n3. PRESERVE THE SIGHT.--Children should be carefully prevented from using\r\ntheir eyes to read or write, or in any equivalent exertion, either before\r\nbreakfast, by dim daylight, or by artificial light. Even school studies\r\nshould be such that they can be dealt with by daylight. Lessons that cannot\r\nbe learned without lamp-light study are almost certainly excessive. This\r\nprecaution should ordinarily be maintained until the age of puberty is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n4. BATHING.--Bathing should be enforced according to constitutions, not by\r\nan invariable rule, except the invariable rule of keeping clean. Not\r\nnecessarily every day, nor necessarily in cold water; though those\r\nconditions are doubtless often right in case of abundant physical health\r\nand strength.\r\n\r\n5. WRONG HABITS.--The habit of daily natural evacuations should be\r\nsolicitously formed and maintained. Words or figures could never express\r\nthe discomforts and wretchedness which wrong habits in this particular have\r\nlocked down upon innumerable women for years and even for life.\r\n\r\n6. DRESS.--Dress should be warm, loose, comely, and modest rather than\r\nshowy; but it should be good enough to satisfy a child's desires after a\r\ngood appearance, if they are reasonable. Children, indeed, should have all\r\ntheir reasonable desires granted as far as possible; for nothing makes them\r\nreasonable so rapidly and so surely as to treat them reasonably.\r\n\r\n{267}\r\n\r\n7. TIGHT LACING.--Great harm is often done to maidens for want of knowledge\r\nin them, or wisdom and care in their parents. The extremes of fashions are\r\nvery prone to violate not only taste, but physiology. Such cases are tight\r\nlacing, low necked dresses, thin shoes, heavy skirts. And yet, if the\r\nladies only knew, the most attractive costumes are not the extremes of\r\nfashion, but those which conform to fashion enough to avoid oddity, which\r\npreserve decorum and healthfulness, whether or no; and here is the great\r\nsecret of successful dress--vary fashion so as to suit the style of the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n8. COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.--Last of all, parental care in the use of\r\nwhatever influence can be exerted in the matter of courtship and marriage.\r\nMaidens, as well as youths, must, after all, choose for themselves. It is\r\ntheir own lives which they take in their hands as they enter the marriage\r\nstate, and not their parents'; and as the consequences affect them\r\nprimarily it is the plainest justice that with the responsibility should be\r\njoined the right of choice. The parental influence, then, must be indirect\r\nand advisory. Indirect, through the whole bringing up of their daughter;\r\nfor if they have trained her aright, she will be incapable of enduring a\r\nfool, still more a knave.\r\n\r\n9. A YOUNG WOMAN AND A YOUNG MAN HAD BETTER NOT BE ALONE TOGETHER VERY MUCH\r\nUNTIL THEY ARE MARRIED.--This will be found to prevent a good many\r\ntroubles. It is not meant to imply that either sex, or any member of it, is\r\nworse than another, or bad at all, or anything but human. It is simply the\r\nprescription of a safe general rule. It is no more an imputation than the\r\nrule that people had better not be left without oversight in presence of\r\nlarge sums of other folks' money. The close personal proximity of the sexes\r\nis greatly undesirable before marriage. Kisses and caresses are most\r\nproperly the monopoly of wives. Such indulgences have a direct and powerful\r\nphysiological effect. Nay, they often lead to the most fatal results.\r\n\r\n10. IGNORANCE BEFORE MARRIAGE.--At some time before marriage those who are\r\nto enter into it ought to be made acquainted with some of the plainest\r\ncommon-sense limitations which should govern their new relations to each\r\nother. Ignorance in such matters has caused an infinite amount of disgust,\r\npain, and unhappiness. It is not necessary to specify particulars here: see\r\nother portions of this work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{269}\r\n\r\nImpregnation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HEALTHY MOTHER.]\r\n\r\n1. CONCEPTION OR IMPREGNATION.--Conception or impregnation takes place by\r\nthe union of the male sperm and female sperm. Whether this is accomplished\r\nin the ovaries, the oviducts or the uterus, is still a question of\r\ndiscussion and investigation by physiologists.\r\n\r\n2. PASSING OFF THE OVUM.--\"With many woman,\" says Dr. Stockham in her\r\nTokology, \"the ovum passes off within twenty-four or forty-eight hours\r\nafter menstruation begins. Some, by careful observation, are able to know\r\nwith certainty when this takes place. It is often accompanied with malaise,\r\nnervousness, headache or actual uterine pain. A minute substance like the\r\nwhite of an egg; with a fleck of blood in it, can frequently be seen upon\r\nthe clothing. Ladies who have noticed this phenomenon testify to its\r\nrecurring very regularly upon the same day after menstruation. Some\r\ndelicate women have observed it as late as the fourteenth day.\"\r\n\r\n3. CALCULATIONS.--Conception is more liable to take place either\r\nimmediately before or immediately after the period, and, on that account it\r\nis usual when calculating the date at which to expect labor, to count from\r\nthe day of disappearance of the last period. The easiest way to make a\r\ncalculation is to count back three months from the date of the last period\r\nand add seven days; thus we might say that the date was the 18th of July;\r\ncounting back brings us to the 18th of April, and adding the seven days\r\nwill bring us to the 25th day of April, the expected time.\r\n\r\n4. EVIDENCE OF CONCEPTION.--Very many medical authorities, distinguished in\r\nthis line, have stated their belief that women never pass more than two or\r\nthree days at the most beyond the forty weeks conceded to pregnancy--that\r\nis two hundred and eighty days or ten lunar months, or nine calendar months\r\nand a week. About two hundred and eighty days will represent the average\r\nduration of pregnancy, counting from the last day of the last period. Now\r\nit must be borne in mind, that there are many disturbing elements which\r\nmight cause the young married woman to miss a time. During the first month\r\nof pregnancy there is no sign by which the condition may be positively\r\nknown. The missing of a period, especially in a person who has been regular\r\nfor some time, may lead one to suspect it; but there are many attendant\r\ncauses in married life, the little annoyances of household duties,\r\nembarrassments, and the enforced gayety which naturally surrounds the\r\nbride, and {270} these should all be taken into consideration in the\r\ndiscussion as to whether or not she is pregnant. But then, again, there are\r\nsome rare cases who have menstruated throughout their pregnancy; and also\r\ncases where menstruation was never established and pregnancy occurred.\r\nNevertheless, the non-appearance of the period, with other signs, may be\r\ntaken as presumptive evidence.\r\n\r\n5. \"ARTIFICIAL IMPREGNATION.--It may not be generally known that union is\r\nnot essential to impregnation; it is possible for conception to occur\r\nwithout congress. All that is necessary is that seminal animalcules enter\r\nthe womb and unite there with the egg or ovum. It is not essential that the\r\nsemen be introduced through the medium of the male organ, as it has been\r\ndemonstrated repeatedly that by means of a syringe and freshly obtained and\r\nhealthy semen, impregnation can be made to follow by its careful\r\nintroduction. There are physicians in France who make a specialty of\r\n\"Artificial Impregnation,\" as it is called, and produce children to\r\notherwise childless couples, being successful in many instances in\r\nsupplying them as they are desired.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSigns and Symptoms of Pregnancy.\r\n\r\n1. THE FIRST SIGN.--The first sign that leads a lady to suspect that she is\r\npregnant is her ceasing-to-be-unwell. This, provided she has just before\r\nbeen in good health, is a strong symptom of pregnancy; but still there must\r\nbe others to corroborate it.\r\n\r\n2. ABNORMAL CONDITION.--Occasionally, women menstruate during the entire\r\ntime of gestation. This, without doubt, is an abnormal condition, and\r\nshould be remedied, as disastrous consequences may result. Also, women have\r\nbeen known to bear children who have never menstruated. The cases are rare\r\nof pregnancy taking place where menstruation has never occurred, yet it\r\nfrequently happens that women never menstruate from one pregnancy to\r\nanother. In these cases this symptom is ruled out for diagnotic purposes.\r\n\r\n3. MAY PROCEED FROM OTHER CAUSES.--But a ceasing-to-be-unwell may proceed\r\nfrom other causes than that of pregnancy, such as disease or disorder of\r\nthe womb or of other {271} organs of the body--especially of the lungs--it\r\nis not by itself alone entirely to be depended upon; although, as a single\r\nsign, it is, especially if the patient be healthy, one of the most reliable\r\nof all the other signs of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n4. MORNING SICKNESS.--If this does not arise from a disordered stomach, it\r\nis a trustworthy sign of pregnancy. A lady who has once had\r\nmorning-sickness can always for the future distinguish it from each and\r\nfrom every other sickness; it is a peculiar sickness, which no other\r\nsickness can simulate. Moreover, it is emphatically a morning-sickness--the\r\npatient being, as a rule, for the rest of the day entirely free from\r\nsickness or from the feeling of sickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Embryo of Twenty Days, Laid Open.\r\n\r\n_b_, the Back: _a_ _a_ _a_, Covering, and pinned to Back.]\r\n\r\n5. A THIRD SYMPTOM.--A third symptom is shooting, throbbing and lancinating\r\npains in, and enlargement of the breasts, with soreness of the nipples,\r\noccurring about the second month. In some instances, after the first few\r\nmonths, a small quantity of watery fluid or a little milk, may be squeezed\r\nout of them. This latter symptom, in a first pregnancy, is valuable, and\r\ncan generally be relied on as fairly conclusive of pregnancy. Milk in the\r\nbreast, however small it may be in quantity, especially in a first\r\npregnancy, is a reliable sign, indeed, we might say, a certain sign, of\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\n6. A DARK BROWN AREOLA OR MARK around the nipple is one of the\r\ndistinguishing signs of pregnancy--more especially of a first pregnancy.\r\nWomen who have had large families, seldom, even when they are not pregnant,\r\nlose this mark entirely; but when they are pregnant it is more intensely\r\ndark--the darkest brown--especially if they be brunettes.\r\n\r\n7. QUICKENING.--Quickening is one of the most important signs of pregnancy,\r\nand one of the most valuable, as at the moment it occurs, as a rule, the\r\nmotion of the child is first felt, whilst, at the same time, there is a\r\nsudden increase in the size of the abdomen. Quickening is a proof that\r\nnearly half the time of pregnancy has passed. If there be a {272} liability\r\nto miscarry, quickening makes matters more safe, as there is less\r\nlikelihood of a miscarriage after than before it. A lady at this time\r\nfrequently feels faint or actually faints away; she is often giddy, or\r\nsick, or nervous, and in some instances even hysterically; although, in\r\nrare cases, some women do not even know the precise time when they quicken.\r\n\r\n8. INCREASED SIZE AND HARDNESS OF THE ABDOMEN.--This is very characteristic\r\nof pregnancy. When a lady is not pregnant the abdomen is soft and flaccid;\r\nwhen she is pregnant, and after she has quickened, the abdomen; over the\r\nregion of the womb, is hard and resisting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Embryo at Thirty Days. _a_, the Head; _b_, the Eyes; _d_,\r\nthe Neck; _e_, the Chest; _f_, the Abdomen.]\r\n\r\n9. EXCITABILITY OF MIND.--Excitability of mind is very common in pregnancy,\r\nmore especially if the patient be delicate; indeed, excitability is a sign\r\nof debility, and requires plenty of good nourishment, but few stimulants.\r\n\r\n10. ERUPTIONS ON THE SKIN.--Principally on the face, neck, or throat, are\r\ntell-tales of pregnancy, and to an experienced matron, publish the fact\r\nthat an acquaintance thus marked is pregnant.\r\n\r\n{273}\r\n\r\n11. THE FOETAL HEART.--In the fifth month there is a sign which, if\r\ndetected, furnishes indubitable evidence of conception, and that is the\r\nsound of the child's heart. If the ear be placed on the abdomen, over the\r\nwomb, the beating of the foetal heart can sometimes be heard quite plainly,\r\nand by the use of an instrument called the stethoscope, the sounds can be\r\nstill more plainly heard. This is a very valuable sign, inasmuch as the\r\npresence of the child is not only ascertained, but also its position, and\r\nwhether there are twins or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR KING.]\r\n\r\n{274}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDiseases of Pregnancy.\r\n\r\n1. COSTIVE STATE OF THE BOWELS.--A costive state of the bowels is common in\r\npregnancy; a mild laxative is therefore occasionally necessary. The mildest\r\nmust be selected, as a strong purgative is highly improper, and even\r\ndangerous. Calomel and all other preparations of mercury are to be\r\nespecially avoided, as a mercurial medicine is apt to weaken the system,\r\nand sometimes even to produce a miscarriage. Let me again urge the\r\nimportance of a lady, during the whole period of pregnancy, being\r\nparticular as to the state of her bowels, as costiveness is a fruitful\r\ncause of painful, tedious and hard labors.\r\n\r\n2. LAXATIVES.--The best laxatives are castor oil, salad oil, compound\r\nrhubarb pills, honey, stewed prunes, stewed rhubarb, Muscatel raisins,\r\nfigs, grapes, roasted apples, baked pears, stewed Normandy pippins, coffee,\r\nbrown-bread and treacle. Scotch oatmeal made with new milk or water, or\r\nwith equal parts of milk and water.\r\n\r\n3. PILLS.--When the motions are hard, and when the bowels are easily acted\r\nupon, two, or three, or four pills made of Castile soap will frequently\r\nanswer the purpose; and if they will, are far better than any other\r\nordinary laxative. The following is a good form. Take of:\r\n\r\n  Castile Soap, five scruples;\r\n  Oil of Caraway, six drops;\r\n\r\nTo make twenty-four pills. Two, or three, or four to be taken at bedtime,\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\n4. HONEY.--A teaspoonful of honey, either eaten at breakfast or dissolved\r\nin a cup of tea, will frequently, comfortably and effectually, open the\r\nbowels, and will supersede the necessity of taking laxative medicine.\r\n\r\n5. NATURE'S MEDICINES.--Now, Nature's medicines--exercise in the open air,\r\noccupation, and household duties--on the contrary, not only at the time\r\nopen the bowels, but keep up a proper action for the future; hence their\r\ninestimable superiority. {275}\r\n\r\n6. WARM WATER INJECTIONS.--An excellent remedy for costiveness of pregnancy\r\nis an enema, either of warm water, or of Castile soap and water, which the\r\npatient, by means of a self-injecting enema-apparatus, may administer to\r\nherself. The quantity of warm water to be used, is from half a pint to a\r\npint; the proper heat is the temperature of new milk; the time for\r\nadministering it is early in the morning, twice or three times a week.\r\n\r\n7. MUSCULAR PAINS OF THE ABDOMEN.--The best remedy is an abdominal belt\r\nconstructed for pregnancy, and adjusted with proper straps and buckles to\r\naccomodate the gradually increasing size of the womb. This plan often\r\naffords great comfort and relief; indeed, such a belt is indispensably\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n8. DIARRHOEA.--Although the bowels in pregnancy are generally costive, they\r\nare sometimes in an opposite state, and are relaxed. Now, this relaxation\r\nis frequently owing to there having been prolonged constipation, and Nature\r\nis trying to relieve herself by purging. Do not check it, but allow it to\r\nhave its course, and take a little rhubarb or magnesia. The diet should be\r\nsimple, plain, and nourishing, and should consist of beef tea, chicken\r\nbroth, arrowroot, and of well-made and well-boiled oatmeal gruel. Butcher's\r\nmeat, for a few days, should not be eaten; and stimulants of all kinds must\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n9. FIDGETS.--A pregnant lady sometimes suffers severely from \"fidgets\"; it\r\ngenerally affects her feet and legs, especially at night, so as to entirely\r\ndestroy her sleep; she cannot lie still; she every few minutes moves,\r\ntosses and tumbles about--first on one side, then on the other. The causes\r\nof \"fidgets\" are a heated state of the blood; an irritable condition of the\r\nnervous system, prevailing at that particular time; and want of occupation.\r\nThe treatment of \"fidgets\" consists of: sleeping in a well-ventilated\r\napartment, with either window or door open; a thorough ablution of the\r\nwhole body every morning, and a good washing with tepid water of the face,\r\nneck, chest, arms and hands every night; shunning hot and close rooms;\r\ntaking plenty of out-door exercise; living on a bland, nourishing, but not\r\nrich diet; avoiding meat at night, and substituting in lieu thereof, either\r\na cupful of arrow-root made with milk, or of well-boiled oatmeal gruel.\r\n\r\n10. EXERCISE.--If a lady, during the night, have the \"fidgets,\" she should\r\nget out of bed; take a short walk up and down the room, being well\r\nprotected by a dressing-gown; empty her bladder; turn her pillow, so as to\r\nhave {276} the cold side next the head; and then lie down again; and the\r\nchances are that she will now fall asleep. If during the day she have the\r\n\"fidgets,\" a ride in an open carriage; or a stroll in the garden, or in the\r\nfields; or a little housewifery, will do her good, and there is nothing\r\nlike fresh air, exercise, and occupation to drive away \"the fidgets.\"\r\n\r\n11. HEARTBURN.--Heartburn is a common and often a distressing symptom of\r\npregnancy. The acid producing the heartburn is frequently much increased by\r\nan overloaded stomach. An abstemious diet ought to be strictly observed.\r\nGreat attention should be paid to the quality of the food. Greens, pastry,\r\nhot buttered toast, melted butter, and everything that is rich and gross,\r\nought to be carefully avoided. Either a teaspoonful of heavy calcined\r\nmagnesia, or half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda--the former to be\r\npreferred if there be constipation--should occasionally be taken in a\r\nwine-glassful of warm water. If these do not relieve--the above directions\r\nas to diet having been strictly attended to--the following mixture ought to\r\nbe tried. Take of:\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of Ammonia, half a drachm;\r\n  Bicarbonate of Soda, a drachm and a half;\r\n  Water, eight ounces;\r\n\r\nTo make a mixture: Two tablespoonfuls to be taken twice or three times a\r\nday, until relief be obtained.\r\n\r\n12. WIND IN THE STOMACH AND BOWELS.--This is a frequent reason why a\r\npregnant lady cannot sleep at night. The two most frequent causes of\r\nflatulence are, first, the want of walking exercise during the day, and\r\nsecond, the eating of a hearty meal just before going to bed at night. The\r\nremedies are, of course, in each instance, self-evident.\r\n\r\n13. SWOLLEN LEGS FROM ENLARGED VEINS (VARICOSE VEINS.)--The veins are\r\nfrequently much enlarged and distended, causing the legs to be greatly\r\nswollen and very painful, preventing the patient from taking proper walking\r\nexercise. Swollen legs are owing to the pressure of the womb upon the\r\nblood-vessels above. Women who have had large families are more liable than\r\nothers to varicose veins. If a lady marry late in life, or if she be very\r\nheavy in pregnancy--carrying the child low down--she is more likely to have\r\ndistention of the veins. The best plan will be for her to wear during the\r\nday an elastic stocking, which ought to be made on purpose for her, in\r\norder that it may properly fit the leg and foot.\r\n\r\n14. STRETCHING OF THE SKIN OF THE ABDOMEN.--This is frequently, in a first\r\npregnancy, distressing, from the {277} soreness it causes. The best remedy\r\nis to rub the abdomen, every night and morning, with warm camphorated oil,\r\nand to wear a belt during the day and a broad flannel bandage at night,\r\nboth of which should be put on moderately but comfortably tight. The belt\r\nmust be secured in its situation by means of properly adjusted straps.\r\n\r\n15. BEFORE THE APPROACH OF LABOR.--The patient, before the approach of\r\nlabor, ought to take particular care to have the bowels gently opened, as\r\nduring that state a costive state greatly increases her sufferings, and\r\nlengthens the period of her labor. A gentle action is all that is\r\nnecessary; a violent one would do more harm than good.\r\n\r\n16. SWOLLEN AND PAINFUL BREASTS.--The breasts are, at times, during\r\npregnancy, much swollen and very painful and, now and then, they cause the\r\npatient great uneasiness as she fancies that she is going to have either\r\nsome dreadful tumor or a gathering of the bosom. There need, in such a\r\ncase, be no apprehension. The swelling and the pain are the consequences of\r\nthe pregnancy, and will in due time subside without any unpleasant result.\r\nFor treatment she cannot do better than rub them well, every night and\r\nmorning, with equal parts of Eau de Cologne and olive oil, and wear a piece\r\nof new flannel over them; taking care to cover the nipples with soft linen,\r\nas the friction of the flannel might irritate them.\r\n\r\n17. BOWEL COMPLAINTS.--Bowel complaints, during pregnancy, are not\r\nunfrequent. A dose either of rhubarb and magnesia, or of castor oil, are\r\nthe best remedies, and are generally, in the way of medicine, all that is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n17. CRAMPS.--Cramps of the legs and of the thighs during the latter period,\r\nand especially at night, are apt to attend pregnancy, and are caused by the\r\nwomb pressing upon the nerves which extend to the lower extremities.\r\nTreatment.--Tightly tie a handkerchief, folded like a neckerchief, round\r\nthe limb a little above the part affected, and let it remain on for a few\r\nminutes. Friction by means of the hand either with opodeldoc or with\r\nlaudanum, taking care not to drink the lotion by mistake, will also give\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRECIOUS FLOWER.]\r\n\r\n19. THE WHITES.--The whites during pregnancy, especially during the latter\r\nmonths, and particularly if the lady have had many children, are frequently\r\ntroublesome, and are, in a measure, occasioned by the pressure of the womb\r\non the parts below, causing irritation. The best way, therefore, to obviate\r\nsuch pressure is for the patient to lie down a great part of each day\r\neither on a bed or a sofa. She ought to retire early to rest; she should\r\nsleep on a hard {279} mattress and in a well-ventilated apartment, and\r\nshould not overload her bed with clothes. A thick, heavy quilt at these\r\ntimes, and indeed at all times, is particularly objectionable; the\r\nperspiration cannot pass readily through it as through blankets, and thus\r\nshe is weakened. She ought to live on plain, wholesome, nourishing food;\r\nand she must abstain from beer and wine and spirits. The bowels ought to be\r\ngently opened by means of a Seidlitz powder, which should occasionally be\r\ntaken early in the morning.\r\n\r\n20. IRRITATION AND ITCHING OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS.--This a most troublesome\r\naffection, and may occur at any time, but more especially during the latter\r\nperiod of the pregnancy. Let her diet be simple and nourishing; let her\r\navoid stimulants of all kinds. Let her take a sitz-bath of warm water,\r\nconsiderably salted. Let her sit in the bath with the body thoroughly\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n21. HOT AND INFLAMED.--The external parts, and the passage to the womb\r\n(vagina), in these cases, are not only irritable and itching, but are\r\nsometimes hot and inflamed, and are covered either with small pimples, or\r\nwith a whitish exudation of the nature of aphtha (thrush), somewhat similar\r\nto the thrush on the mouth of an infant; then, the addition of glycerine to\r\nthe lotion is a great improvement and usually gives much relief.\r\n\r\n22. [3]BILIOUSNESS is defined by some one as piggishness. Generally it may\r\nbe regarded as _overfed_. The elements of the bile are in the blood in\r\nexcess of the power of the liver to eliminate them. This may be caused\r\neither from the superabundance of the materials from which the bile is made\r\nor by inaction of the organ itself. Being thus retained the system is\r\n_clogged_. It is the result of either too much food in quantity or too rich\r\nin quality. Especially is it caused by the excessive use of _fats and\r\nsweets_. The simplest remedy is the best. A plain, light diet with plenty\r\nof acid fruits, avoiding fats and sweets, will ameliorate or remove it.\r\nDon't force the appetite. Let hunger demand food. In the morning the\r\nsensitiveness of the stomach may be relieved by taking before rising a cup\r\nof hot water, hot milk, hot lemonade, rice or barley water, selecting\r\naccording to preference. For this purpose many find coffee made from\r\nbrowned wheat or corn the best drink. Depend for a time upon liquid food\r\nthat can be taken up by absorbents. The juice of lemons and other acid\r\nfruits is usually grateful, and {280} assists in assimilating any excess in\r\nnutriment. These may be diluted according to taste. With many, an egg\r\nlemonade proves relishing and acceptable.\r\n\r\n23. DERANGED APPETITE.--Where the appetite fails, let the patient go\r\nwithout eating for a little while, say for two or three meals. If, however,\r\nthe strength begins to go, try the offering of some unexpected delicacy; or\r\ngive small quantities of nourishing food, as directed in case of morning\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\n24. PILES.--For cases of significance consult a physician. As with\r\nconstipation, so with piles, its frequent result, fruit diet, exercise, and\r\nsitz-bath regimen will do much to prevent the trouble. Frequent local\r\napplications of a cold compress, and even of ice, and tepid water\r\ninjections, are of great service. Walking or standing aggravate this\r\ncomplaint. Lying down alleviates it. Dr. Shaw says, \"There is nothing in\r\nthe world that will produce so great relief in piles as fasting. If the fit\r\nis severe, live a whole day, or even two, if necessary, upon pure soft cold\r\nwater alone. Give then very lightly of vegetable food.\"\r\n\r\n25. TOOTHACHE.--There is a sort of proverb that a woman loses one tooth\r\nevery time she has a child. Neuralgic toothache during pregnancy is, at any\r\nrate, extremely common, and often has to be endured. It is generally\r\nthought not best to have teeth extracted during pregnancy, as the shock to\r\nthe nervous system has sometimes caused miscarriage. To wash out the mouth\r\nmorning and night with cold or lukewarm water and salt is often of use. If\r\nthe teeth are decayed, consult a good dentist in the early stages of\r\npregnancy, and have the offending teeth properly dressed. Good dentists, in\r\nthe present state of the science, extract very few teeth, but save them.\r\n\r\n26. SALIVATION.--Excessive secretion of the saliva has usually been\r\nreckoned substantially incurable. Fasting, cold water treatment, exercise\r\nand fruit diet may be relied on to prevent, cure or alleviate it, where\r\nthis is possible, as it frequently is.\r\n\r\n27. HEADACHE.--This is, perhaps, almost as common in cases of pregnancy as\r\n\"morning sickness.\" It may be from determination of blood to the head, from\r\nconstipation or indigestion, constitutional \"sick headache,\" from\r\nneuralgia, from a cold, from rheumatism. Correct living will prevent much\r\nheadache trouble; and where this does not answer the purpose, rubbing and\r\nmaking magnetic passes over the {281} head by the hand of some healthy\r\nmagnetic person will often prove of great service.\r\n\r\n28. LIVER-SPOTS.--These, on the face, must probably be endured, as no\r\ntrustworthy way of driving them off is known.\r\n\r\n29. JAUNDICE.--See the doctor.\r\n\r\n30. PAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE.--This is liable to occur from about the fifth\r\nto the eighth month, and is attributed to the pressure of the enlarging\r\nwomb upon the liver. Proper living is most likely to alleviate it. Wearing\r\na wet girdle in daytime or a wet compress at night, sitz-baths, and\r\nfriction with the wet hand may also be tried. If the pain is severe a\r\nmustard poultice may be used. Exercise should be carefully moderated if\r\nfound to increase the pain. If there is fever and inflammation with it,\r\nconsult a physician. It is usually not dangerous, but uncomfortable only.\r\n\r\n31. PALPITATION OF THE HEART.--To be prevented by healthy living and calm,\r\ngood humor. Lying down will often gradually relieve it, so will a compress\r\nwet with water, as hot as can be borne, placed over the heart and renewed\r\nas often as it gets cool.\r\n\r\n32. FAINTING.--Most likely to be caused by \"quickening,\" or else by tight\r\ndress, bad air, over-exertion, or other unhealthy living. It is not often\r\ndangerous. Lay the patient in an easy posture, the head rather low than\r\nhigh, and where cool air may blow across the face; loosen the dress if\r\ntight; sprinkle cold water on the face and hands.\r\n\r\n33. SLEEPLESSNESS.--Most likely to be caused by incorrect living, and to be\r\nprevented and cured by the opposite. A glass or two of cold water drank\r\ndeliberately on going to bed often helps one to go to sleep; so does\r\nbathing the face and hands and the feet in cold water. A short nap in the\r\nlatter part of the forenoon can sometimes be had, and is of use. Such a nap\r\nought not to be too long, or it leaves a heavy feeling; it should be sought\r\nwith the mind in a calm state, in a well-ventilated though darkened room,\r\nand with the clothing removed, as at night. A similar nap in the afternoon\r\nis not so good, but is better than nothing. The tepid sitz-bath on going to\r\nbed will often produce sleep, and so will gentle percussion given by an\r\nattendant with palms of the hand over the back for a few minutes on\r\nretiring. To secure sound sleep do not read, write or severely tax the mind\r\nin the evening. {282}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMORNING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n1. A pregnant woman is especially liable to suffer many forms of dyspepsia,\r\nnervous troubles, sleeplessness, etc.\r\n\r\n2. MORNING SICKNESS is the most common and is the result of an irritation\r\nin the womb, caused by some derangement, and it is greatly irritated by the\r\nhabit of indulging in sexual gratification during pregnancy. If people\r\nwould imitate the lower animals and reserve the vital forces of the mother\r\nfor the benefit of her unborn child, it would be a great boon to humanity.\r\nMorning sickness may begin the next day after conception, but it usually\r\nappears from two to three weeks after the beginning of pregnancy and\r\ncontinues with more or less severity from two to four months.\r\n\r\n3. HOME TREATMENT FOR MORNING SICKNESS.--Avoid all highly seasoned and rich\r\nfood. Also avoid strong tea and coffee. Eat especially light and simple\r\nsuppers at five o'clock and no later than six. Some simple broths, such as\r\nwill be found in the cooking department of this book will be very\r\nnourishing and soothing. Coffee made from brown wheat or corn is an\r\nexcellent remedy to use. The juice of lemons reduced with water will\r\nsometimes prove very effectual. A good lemonade with an egg well stirred is\r\nvery nourishing and toning to the stomach.\r\n\r\n4. HOT FOMENTATION on the stomach and liver is excellent, and warm and hot\r\nwater injections are highly beneficial.\r\n\r\n5. A little powdered magnesia at bed time, taken in a little milk, will\r\noften give almost permanent relief.\r\n\r\n6. Avoid corsets or any other pressure upon the stomach. All garments must\r\nbe worn loosely. In many cases this will entirely prevent all stomach\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{283}\r\n\r\nRelation of Husband and Wife During Pregnancy.\r\n\r\n1. MISCARRIAGE.--If the wife is subject to miscarriage every precaution\r\nshould be employed to prevent its happening again. Under such exceptional\r\ncircumstances the husband should sleep apart the first five months of\r\npregnancy; after that length of time, the ordinary relation may be assumed.\r\nIf miscarriage has taken place, intercourse should be avoided for a month\r\nor six weeks at least after the accident.\r\n\r\n2. IMPREGNATION--Impregnation is the only mission of intercourse, and after\r\nthat has taken place, intercourse can subserve no other purpose than\r\nsensual gratification.\r\n\r\n3. WOMAN MUST JUDGE.--Every man should recognize the fact that woman is the\r\nsole umpire as to when, how frequent, and under what circumstances,\r\nconnection should take place. Her desires should not be ignored, for her\r\nlikes and dislikes are--as seen in another part of this book--easily\r\nimpressed upon the unborn child. If she is strong and healthy there is no\r\nreason why passion should not be gratified with moderation and caution\r\nduring the whole period of pregnancy, but she must be the sole judge and\r\nher desires supreme.\r\n\r\n4. VOLUNTARY INSTANCES.--No voluntary instances occur through the entire\r\nanimal kingdom. All females repel with force and fierceness the approaches\r\nof the male. The human family is the only exception. A man that loves his\r\nwife, however, will respect her under all circumstances and recognize her\r\ncondition and yield to her wishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{284}\r\n\r\nA Private Word to the Expectant Mother\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, in a lecture to ladies, thus strongly states her\r\nviews regarding maternity and painless childbirth:\r\n\r\n\"We must educate our daughters to think that motherhood is grand, and that\r\nGod never cursed it. And this curse, if it be a curse, may be rolled off,\r\nas man has rolled away the curse of labor; as the curse has been rolled\r\nfrom the descendants of Ham. My mission is to preach this new gospel. If\r\nyou suffer, it is not because you are cursed of God, but because you\r\nviolate His laws. What an incubus it would take from woman could she be\r\neducated to know that the pains of maternity are no curse upon her kind. We\r\nknow that among the Indians the squaws do not suffer in childbirth. They\r\nwill step aside from the ranks, even on the march, and return in a short\r\ntime to them with the newborn child. What an absurdity then, to suppose\r\nthat only enlightened Christian women are cursed. But one word of fact is\r\nworth a volume of philosophy; let me give you some of my own experience. I\r\nam the mother of seven children. My girlhood was spent mostly in the open\r\nair. I early imbibed the idea that a girl was just as good as a boy, and I\r\ncarried it out. I would walk five miles before breakfast or {285} ride ten\r\non horseback. After I was married I wore my clothing sensibly. Their weight\r\nhung entirely on my shoulders. I never compressed my body out of its\r\nnatural shape. When my first four children were born, I suffered very\r\nlittle. I then made up my mind that it was totally unnecessary for me to\r\nsuffer at all; so I dressed lightly, walked every day, lived as much as\r\npossible in the open air, ate no condiments or spices, kept quiet, listened\r\nto music, looked at pictures, and took proper care of myself. The night\r\nbefore the birth of the child I walked three miles. The child was born\r\nwithout a particle of pain. I bathed it and dressed it, and it weighed ten\r\nand one-half pounds. That same day I dined with the family. Everybody said\r\nI would surely die, but I never had a relapse or a moment's inconvenience\r\nfrom it. I know this is not being delicate and refined, but if you would be\r\nvigorous and healthy, in spite of the diseases of your ancestors, and your\r\nown disregard of nature's laws, try it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nShall Pregnant Women Work?\r\n\r\n1. OVER-WORKED MOTHERS.--Children born of over-worked mothers, are liable\r\nto be a dwarfed and puny race. However, their chances are better than those\r\nof the children of inactive, dependent, indolent mothers who have neither\r\nbrain nor muscle to transmit to son or daughter. The truth seems to be that\r\nexcessive labor, with either body or mind, is alike injurious to both men\r\nand women, and herein lies the sting of that old curse. This paragraph\r\nsuggests all that need be said on the question whether pregnant women\r\nshould or should not labor.\r\n\r\n2. FOOLISHLY IDLE.--At least it is certain that they should not be\r\nfoolishly idle; and on the other hand, it is equally certain that they\r\nshould be relieved from painful laborious occupations that exhaust and\r\nunfit them for happiness. Pleasant and useful physical and intellectual\r\noccupation, however, will not only do no harm, but positive good.\r\n\r\n3. THE BEST MAN AND THE BEST WOMAN.--The best man is he who can rear the\r\nbest child, and the best woman is she who can rear the best child. We very\r\nproperly extol to the skies Harriet Hosmer, the artist, for cutting in\r\nmarble the statue of a Zenobia, how much more should we sing praises to the\r\nman and the woman who bring into the world a noble boy or girl. The one is\r\na piece of lifeless beauty, the other a piece of life including all beauty,\r\nall possibilities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{286}\r\n\r\nWords for Young Mothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe act of nursing is sometimes painful to the mother, especially before\r\nthe habit is fully established. The discomfort is greatly increased if the\r\nskin that covers the nipples is tender and delicate. The suction pulls it\r\noff, leaving them in a state in which the necessary pressure of the child's\r\nlips cause intense agony. This can be prevented in a great measure, says\r\nElizabeth Robinson Scovil, in _Ladies' Home Journal_, if not entirely, by\r\nbathing the nipples twice a day for six weeks before the confinement with\r\npowdered alum dissolved in alcohol; or salt dissolved in brandy. If there\r\nis any symptom of the skin cracking when the child begins to nurse, they\r\nshould be painted with a mixture of tannin and glycerine. This must be\r\nwashed off before the baby touches them and renewed when it leaves them. If\r\nthey are {287} very painful, the doctor will probably order morphia added\r\nto the mixture. A rubber nipple shield to be put on at the time of nursing,\r\nis a great relief. If the nipples are retracted or drawn inward, they can\r\nbe drawn out painlessly by filling a pint bottle with boiling water,\r\nemptying it and quickly applying the mouth over the nipple. As the air in\r\nthe bottle cools, it condenses, leaving a vacuum and the nipple is pushed\r\nout by the air behind it.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk accumulates or \"cakes\" in the breast in hard patches, they\r\nshould be rubbed very gently, from the base upwards, with warm camphorated\r\noil. The rubbing should be the lightest, most delicate stroking, avoiding\r\npressure. If lumps appear at the base of the breast and it is red, swollen\r\nand painful, cloths wrung out of cold water should be applied and the\r\ndoctor sent for. While the breast is full and hard all over, not much\r\napprehension need be felt. It is when lumps appear that the physician\r\nshould be notified, that he may, if possible, prevent the formation of\r\nabscesses.\r\n\r\nWhile a woman is nursing she should eat plenty of nourishing food--milk,\r\noatmeal, cracked wheat, and good juicy, fresh meat, boiled, roasted, or\r\nbroiled, but not fried. Between each meal, before going to bed, and once\r\nduring the night, she should take a cup of cocoa, gruel made with milk,\r\ngood beef tea, mutton broth, or any warm, nutritive drink. Tea and coffee\r\nare to be avoided. It is important to keep the digestion in order and the\r\nbowels should be carefully regulated as a means to this end. If necessary,\r\nany of the laxative mineral waters can be used for this purpose, or a\r\nteaspoonful of compound licorice powder taken at night. Powerful cathartic\r\nmedicines should be avoided because of their effect upon the baby. The\r\nchild should be weaned at nine months old, unless this time comes in very\r\nhot weather, or the infant is so delicate that a change of food would be\r\ninjurious. If the mother is not strong her nurseling will sometimes thrive\r\nbetter upon artificial food than on its natural nourishment. By gradually\r\nlengthening the interval between the nursing and feeding the child, when it\r\nis hungry, the weaning can be accomplished without much trouble.\r\n\r\nA young mother should wear warm underclothing, thick stockings and a\r\nflannel jacket over her night dress, unless she is in the habit of wearing\r\nan under vest. If the body is not protected by warm clothing there is an\r\nundue demand upon the nervous energy to keep up the vital heat, and nerve\r\nforce is wasted by the attempt to compel the system to do what ought to be\r\ndone for it by outside means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{288}\r\n\r\nHow to Have Beautiful Children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. PARENTAL INFLUENCE.--The art of having handsome children has been a\r\nquestion that has interested the people of all ages and of all\r\nnationalities. There is no longer a question as to the influence that\r\nparents may and do exert upon their offspring, and it is shown in other\r\nparts of this book that beauty depends largely on the condition of health\r\nat the time of conception. It is therefore of no little moment that parents\r\nshould guard carefully their own health as well as that of their children,\r\nthat they may develop a vigorous constitution. There cannot be beauty\r\nwithout good health.\r\n\r\n2. MARRYING TOO EARLY.--We know that marriage at too early an age, or too\r\nlate in life, is apt to produce imperfectly {289} developed children, both\r\nmentally and physically. The causes are self-evident: A couple marrying too\r\nyoung, they lack maturity and consequently will impart weakness to their\r\noffspring; while on the other hand persons marrying late in life fail to\r\nfind that normal condition which is conducive to the health and vigor of\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\n3. CROSSING OF TEMPERAMENTS AND NATIONALITIES.--The crossing of\r\ntemperaments and nationalities beautifies offspring. If young persons of\r\ndifferent nationalities marry, their children under proper hygienic laws\r\nare generally handsome and healthy. For instance, an American and German or\r\nan Irish and German uniting in marriage, produces better looking children\r\nthan those marrying in the same nationality. Persons of different\r\ntemperaments uniting in marriage, always produces a good effect upon\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\n4. THE PROPER TIME.--To obtain the best results, conception should take\r\nplace only when both parties are in the best physical condition. If either\r\nparent is in any way indisposed at the time of conception the results will\r\nbe seen in the health of the child. Many children brought in the world with\r\ndiseases or other infirmities stamped upon their feeble frames show the\r\nindiscretion and ignorance of parents.\r\n\r\n5. DURING PREGNANCY.--During pregnancy the mother should take time for self\r\nimprovement and cultivate an interest for admiring beautiful pictures or\r\nengravings which represent cheerful and beautiful figures. Secure a few\r\ngood books illustrating art, with some fine representations of statues and\r\nother attractive pictures. The purchase of several illustrated art journals\r\nmight answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n6. WHAT TO AVOID.--Pregnant mothers should avoid thinking of ugly people,\r\nor those marked by any deformity or disease; avoid injury, fright and\r\ndisease of any kind. Also avoid ungraceful position and awkward attitude,\r\nbut cultivate grace and beauty in herself. Avoid difficulty with neighbors\r\nor other trouble.\r\n\r\n7. GOOD CARE.--She should keep herself in good physical condition, and the\r\nsystem well nourished, as a want of food always injures the child.\r\n\r\n8. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MIND.--The mother should read suitable articles\r\nin newspapers or good books, keep her mind occupied. If she cultivates a\r\ndesire for intellectual improvement, the same desire will be more or less\r\nmanifested in the growth and development of the child. {290}\r\n\r\n9. LIKE PRODUCES LIKE, everywhere and always--in general forms and in\r\nparticular features--in mental qualities and in bodily conditions--in\r\ntendencies of thought and in habits of action. Let this grand truth be\r\ndeeply impressed upon the hearts of all who desire or expect to become\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n10. HEREDITY.--Male children generally inherit the peculiar traits and\r\ndiseases of the mother and female children those of the father.\r\n\r\n11. ADVICE.--\"Therefore it is urged that during the period of\r\nutero-gestation, especial pains should be taken to render the life of the\r\nfemale as harmonious as possible, that her surroundings should all be of a\r\nnature calculated to inspire the mind with thoughts of physical and mental\r\nbeauties and perfections, and that she should be guarded against all\r\ninfluences, of whatever character, having a deteriorating tendency.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{292}\r\n\r\nEducation of the Child in the Womb.\r\n\r\n    \"A lady once interviewed a prominent college president and asked him\r\n    when the education of a child should begin. 'Twenty-five years before\r\n    it is born,' was the prompt reply.\"\r\n\r\nNo better answer was ever given to that question. Every mother may well\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\n1. THE UNBORN CHILD AFFECTED BY THE THOUGHTS AND THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE\r\nMOTHER.--That the child is affected in the womb of the mother, through the\r\ninfluences apparently connected with objects by which she is surrounded,\r\nappears to have been well known in ancient days, as well as at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n2. EVIDENCES.--Many evidences are found in ancient history, especially\r\namong the refined nations, showing that certain expedients were resorted to\r\nby which their females, during the period of utero-gestation, were\r\nsurrounded by the superior refinements of the age, with the hope of thus\r\nmaking upon them impressions which should have the effect of communicating\r\ncertain desired qualities to the offspring. For this reason apartments were\r\nadorned with statuary and paintings, and special pains were taken not only\r\nto convey favorable impressions, but also to guard against unfavorable ones\r\nbeing made, upon the mind of the pregnant woman.\r\n\r\n3. HANKERING AFTER GIN.--A certain mother while pregnant, longed for gin,\r\nwhich could not be gotten; and her child cried incessantly for six weeks\r\ntill gin was given it, which it eagerly clutched and drank with ravenous\r\ngreediness, stopped crying, and became healthy.\r\n\r\n4. BEGIN TO EDUCATE CHILDREN AT CONCEPTION, and continue during their\r\nentire carriage. Yet maternal study, of little account before the sixth,\r\nafter it, is most promotive of talents; which, next to goodness are the\r\nfather's joy and the mother's pride. What pains are taken after they are\r\nborn, to render them prodigies of learning, by the best of schools and\r\nteachers from their third year; whereas their mother's study, three months\r\nbefore their birth, would improve their intellects infinitely more.\r\n\r\n5. MOTHERS, DOES GOD THUS PUT the endowment of your darlings into your\r\nmoulding power? Then tremble in view of its necessary responsibilities, and\r\nlearn how to wield them for their and your temporal and eternal happiness.\r\n{293}\r\n\r\n6. QUALITIES OF THE MIND.--The qualities of the mind are perhaps as much\r\nliable to hereditary transmission as bodily configuration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMemory, intelligence, judgment, imagination, passions, diseases, and what\r\nis usually called genius, are often very markedly traced in the\r\noffspring.--I have known mental impressions forcibly impressed upon the\r\noffspring at the time of conception, as concomitant of some peculiar\r\neccentricity, idiosyncracy, morbidness, waywardness, irritability, or\r\nproclivity of either one or both parents.\r\n\r\n7. THE PLASTIC BRAIN.--The plastic brain of the foetus is prompt to receive\r\nall impressions. It retains them, and they become the characteristics of\r\nthe child and the man. Low spirits, violent passions, irritability,\r\nfrivolity, in the pregnant woman, leave indelible marks on the unborn\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n8. FORMATION OF CHARACTER.--I believe that pre-natal influences may do as\r\nmuch in the formation of character as all the education that can come\r\nafter, and that mothers may, in a measure, \"will,\" what that influence\r\nshall be, and that, as knowledge on the subject increases, it will be more\r\nand more under their control. In that, as in everything else, things that\r\nwould be possible with one mother would not be with another, and measures\r\nthat would be successful with one would produce opposite results from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n9. A HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATION.--A woman rode side by side with her soldier\r\nhusband, and witnessed the drilling of troops for battle. The scene\r\ninspired her with a deep longing to see a battle and share in the\r\nexcitements of the {294} conquerors. This was but a few months before her\r\nboy was born, and his name was Napoleon.\r\n\r\n10. A MUSICIAN.--The following was reported by Dr. F. W. Moffatt, in the\r\nmother's own language: \"When I was first pregnant, I wished my offspring to\r\nbe a musician, so, during the period of that pregnancy, settled my whole\r\nmind on music, and attended every musical entertainment I possibly could. I\r\nhad my husband, who has a violin, to play for me by the hour. When the\r\nchild was born, it was a girl, which grew and prospered, and finally became\r\nan expert musician.\"\r\n\r\n11. MURDEROUS INTENT.--The mother of a young man, who was hung not long\r\nago, was heard to say: \"I tried to get rid of him before he was born; and,\r\noh, how I wish now that I had succeeded!\" She added that it was the only\r\ntime she had attempted anything of the sort; but, because of home troubles,\r\nshe became desperate, and resolved that her burdens should not be made any\r\ngreater. Does it not seem probable that the murderous intent, even though\r\nof short duration, was communicated to the mind of the child, and resulted\r\nin the crime for which he was hung?\r\n\r\n12. THE ASSASSIN OF GARFIELD.--Guiteau's father was a man of integrity and\r\nconsiderable intellectual ability. His children were born in quick\r\nsuccession, and the mother was obliged to work very hard. Before this child\r\nwas born, she resorted to every means, though unsuccessful, to produce\r\nabortion. The world knows the result. Guiteau's whole life was full of\r\ncontradictions. There was little self-controlling power in him; no common\r\nsense, and not a vestige of remorse or shame. In his wild imagination, he\r\nbelieved himself capable of doing the greatest work, and of filling the\r\nloftiest station in life. Who will dare question that this mother's effort\r\nto destroy him while in embryo was the main cause in bringing him to the\r\nlevel of the brutes?\r\n\r\n13. CAUTION.--Any attempt, on the part of the mother, to destroy her child\r\nbefore birth, is liable, if unsuccessful, to produce murderous tendencies.\r\nEven harboring murderous thoughts, whether toward her own child or not,\r\nmight be followed by similar results.\r\n\r\n \"The great King of kings\r\n  Hath in the table of His law commanded\r\n  That thou shalt do no murder. Wilt thou, then,\r\n  Spurn at His edict, and fulfill a man's?\r\n  Take heed, for He holds vengeance in His hand\r\n  To hurl upon their heads that break his law.\"--RICHARD III., _Act 1._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{295}\r\n\r\nHow to Calculate the Time of Expected Labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Embryo In Sixty Days.]\r\n\r\n1. The table on the opposite page has been very accurately compiled, and\r\nwill be very helpful to those who desire the exact time.\r\n\r\n2. The duration of pregnancy is from 278 to 280 days, or nearly forty\r\nweeks. The count should be made from the beginning of the last\r\nmenstruation, and add eight days on account of the possibility of it\r\noccurring within that period The heavier the child the longer is the\r\nduration; the younger the woman the longer time it often requires. The\r\nduration is longer in married than in unmarried women; the duration is\r\nliable to be longer if the child is a female.\r\n\r\n3. MOVEMENT.--The first movement is generally felt on the 135th day after\r\nimpregnation.\r\n\r\n4. GROWTH OF THE EMBRYO.--About the twentieth day the embryo resembles the\r\nappearance of an ant or lettuce seed; the 30th day the embryo is as large\r\nas a common horse fly; the 40th day the form resembles that of a person; in\r\nsixty days the limbs begin to form, and in four months the embryo takes the\r\nname of foetus.\r\n\r\n5. Children born after seven or eight months can survive and develop to\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{296}\r\n\r\nDURATION OF

There are not words in the\r\nEnglish language to express my convictions upon this subject. The corset\r\nmore than any other one thing is responsible for woman's being the victim\r\nof disease and doctors....\r\n\r\n\"What is the effect upon the child? One-half of the children born in this\r\ncountry die before they are five years of age. Who can tell how much this\r\nstate of things is due to the enervation of maternal life forces by the one\r\ninstrument of torture?\r\n\r\n\"I am a temperance woman. No one can realize more than I the devastation\r\nand ruin alcohol in its many tempting forms has brought to the human\r\nfamily. Still I solemnly believe that in weakness and deterioration of\r\nhealth, the corset has more to answer for than intoxicating drinks.\" When\r\nasked how far advanced a woman should be in pregnancy before she laid aside\r\nher corset, Dr. Stockham said with emphasis: \"_The corset should not be\r\nworn for two hundred years before pregnancy takes place._ Ladies, it will\r\ntake that time at least to overcome the ill-effect of tight garments which\r\nyou think so essential.\"\r\n\r\n20. PAINLESS PREGNANCY AND CHILD-BIRTH.--\"Some excellent popular volumes,\"\r\nsays Dr. Haff, \"have been largely devoted to directions how to secure a\r\ncomfortable period of pregnancy and painless delivery. After much conning\r\nof these worthy efforts to impress a little common sense upon the\r\nsisterhood, we are convinced that all may be summed up under the simple\r\nheads of: (1) An unconfined and lightly burdened waist; (2) Moderate but\r\npersistent outdoor exercise, of which walking is the best form; (3) A\r\nplain, unstimulating, chiefly fruit and vegetable diet; (4) Little or no\r\nintercourse during the time.\r\n\r\n\"These are hygienic rules of benefit under any ordinary conditions; yet\r\nthey are violated by almost every pregnant lady. If they are followed,\r\nbiliousness, indigestion, constipation, swollen limbs, morning sickness and\r\nnausea--all will absent themselves or be much lessened. In pregnancy, more\r\nthan at any other time, corsets are injurious. The waist and abdomen must\r\nbe allowed to expand freely with the growth of the child. The great process\r\nof _evolution_ must have room.\"\r\n\r\n21. IN ADDITION, we can do no better than quote the following\r\nrecapitulation by Dr. Stockham in her famous {298} Tokology: \"To give a\r\nwoman the greatest immunity from suffering during pregnancy, prepare her\r\nfor a safe and comparatively easy delivery, and insure a speedy recovery,\r\nall hygienic conditions must be observed.\r\n\r\n\"The dress must give:\r\n\r\n\"1. Freedom of movement;\r\n\r\n\"2. No pressure upon any part of the body;\r\n\r\n\"3. No more weight than is essential for warmth, and both weight and warmth\r\nevenly distributed.\r\n\r\n\"These requirements necessitate looseness, lightness and warmth, which can\r\nbe obtained from the union underclothes, a princess skirt and dress, with a\r\nshoe that allows full development and use of the foot. While decoration and\r\nelegance are desirable, they should not sacrifice comfort and convenience.\r\n\r\n22. \"LET THE DIET BE LIGHT, plain and nutritious. Avoid fats and sweets,\r\nrelying mainly upon fruits and grain that contain little of the mineral\r\nsalts. By this diet bilious and inflammatory conditions are overcome, the\r\ndevelopment of bone in the foetus lessened, and muscles necessary in labor\r\nnourished and strengthened.\r\n\r\n23. \"EXERCISE should be sufficient and of such a character as will bring\r\ninto action gently every muscle of the body; but must particularly develop\r\nthe muscles of the trunk, abdomen and groin, that are specially called into\r\naction in labor. Exercise, taken faithfully and systematically, more than\r\nany other means assists assimilative processes and stimulates the organs of\r\nexcretion to healthy action.\r\n\r\n24. \"BATHING MUST BE FREQUENT and regular. Unless in special conditions the\r\nbest results are obtained from tepid or cold bathing, which invigorates the\r\nsystem and overcomes nervousness. The sitz-bath is the best therapeutic and\r\nhygienic measure within the reach of the pregnant woman.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, to establish conditions which will overcome many previous\r\ninfractions of law, _dress_ naturally and physiologically; _live_ much of\r\nthe time _out of doors_; have _abundance_ of _fresh air_ in the house; let\r\n_exercise_ be _sufficient_ and _systematic_; pursue a _diet of fruit_, rice\r\nand vegetables; _regular rest_ must be faithfully taken; _abstain_ from the\r\nsexual relation. To those who will commit themselves to this course of\r\nlife, patiently and persistently carrying it out through the period of\r\ngestation, the possibilities of attaining a healthy, natural, painless\r\nparturition will be remarkably increased. {299}\r\n\r\n25. \"IF THE FIRST EXPERIMENT should not result in a painless labor, it\r\nwithout doubt will prove the beginning of sound health. Persisted in\r\nthrough years of married life, the ultimate result will be more and more\r\nclosely approximated, while there will be less danger of diseases after\r\nchildbirth and better and more vigorous children will be produced.\r\n\r\n\"Then pregnancy by every true woman will be desired, and instead of being a\r\nperiod of disease, suffering and direful forebodings, will become a period\r\nof health, exalted pleasure and holiest anticipations. Motherhood will be\r\ndeemed the choicest of earth's blessings; women will rejoice in a glad\r\nmaternity and for any self-denial will be compensated by healthy, happy,\r\nbuoyant, grateful children.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{300} [Illustration: A HAPPY MOTHER.]\r\n\r\n{301}\r\n\r\nSolemn Lessons for Parents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOAN OF ARC.]\r\n\r\n1. EXCESSIVE PLEASURES AND PAINS.--A woman during her time of pregnancy\r\nshould of all women be most carefully tended, and kept from violent and\r\nexcessive pleasures and pains; and at that time she should cultivate\r\ngentleness, benevolence and kindness. {302}\r\n\r\n2. HEREDITARY EFFECTS.--Those who are born to become insane do not\r\nnecessarily spring from insane parents, or from any ancestry having any\r\napparent taint of lunacy in their blood, but they do receive from their\r\nprogenitors certain impressions upon their mental and moral, as well as\r\ntheir physical beings, which impressions, like an iron mould, fix and shape\r\ntheir subsequent destinies. Hysteria in the mother may develop insanity in\r\nthe child, while drunkenness in the father may impel epilepsy, or mania, in\r\nthe son. Ungoverned passions in the parents may unloose the furies of\r\nunrestrained madness in the minds of their children, and the bad treatment\r\nof the wife may produce sickly or weak-minded children.\r\n\r\n3. THE INFLUENCE OF PREDOMINANT PASSION may be transmitted from the parent\r\nto the child, just as surely as similarity of looks. It has been truly said\r\nthat \"the faculties which predominate in power and activity in the parents,\r\nwhen the organic existence of the child commences, determine its future\r\nmental disposition.\" A bad mental condition of the mother may produce\r\nserious defects upon her unborn child.\r\n\r\n4. THE SINGULAR EFFECTS produced on the unborn child by the sudden mental\r\nemotions of the mother are remarkable examples of a kind of electrotyping\r\non the sensitive surfaces of living forms. It is doubtless true that the\r\nmind's action in such cases may increase or diminish the molecular deposits\r\nin the several portions of the system. The precise place which each\r\nseparate particle assumes in the new organic structure may be determined by\r\nthe influence of thought or feeling. Perfect love and perfect harmony\r\nshould exist between wife and husband during this vital period.\r\n\r\n5. AN ILLUSTRATION.--If a sudden and powerful emotion of a woman's mind\r\nexerts such an influence upon her stomach as to excite vomiting, and upon\r\nher heart as almost to arrest its motion and induce fainting, can we\r\nbelieve that it will have no effect upon her womb and the fragile being\r\ncontained within it? Facts and reason then, alike demonstrate the reality\r\nof the influence, and much practical advantage would result to both parent\r\nand child, were the conditions and extent of its operations better\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n6. PREGNANT WOMEN should not be exposed to causes likely to distress or\r\notherwise strongly impress their minds. A consistent life with worthy\r\nobjects constantly kept in mind should be the aim and purpose of every\r\nexpectant mother. {303}\r\n\r\nCASES CITED.\r\n\r\nWe selected only a few cases to illustrate the above statement. Thousands\r\nof cases occur every year that might be cited to illustrate these\r\nprinciples. A mother cannot be too careful, and she should have the hearty\r\nco-operation and assistance of her husband. We quote the following cases\r\nfrom Dr. Pancoast's Medical Guide, who is no doubt one of the best\r\nauthorities on the subject.\r\n\r\n1. A woman bitten on the vulva by a dog, bore a child having a similar\r\nwound on the glans penis. The boy suffered from epilepsy, and when the fit\r\ncame on, or during sleep, was frequently heard to cry out, \"The dog bites\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n2. A pregnant woman who was suddenly alarmed from seeing her husband come\r\nhome with one side of his face swollen and distorted by a blow, bore a girl\r\nwith a purple swelling upon the same side of the face.\r\n\r\n3. A woman, who was forced to be present at the opening of a calf by a\r\nbutcher, bore a child with all its bowels protruding from the abdomen. She\r\nwas aware at the time of something going on within the womb.\r\n\r\n4. A pregnant woman fell into a violent passion at not being able to\r\nprocure a particular piece of meat of a butcher; she bled at the nose, and\r\nwiping the blood from her lips, bore a child wanting a lip.\r\n\r\n5. A woman absent from home became alarmed by seeing a great fire in the\r\ndirection of her own house, bore a child with a distinct mark of the flame\r\nupon its forehead.\r\n\r\n6. A woman who had borne healthy children, became frightened by a beggar\r\nwith a wooden leg and a stumped arm, who threatened to embrace her. Her\r\nnext child had one stump leg and two stump arms.\r\n\r\n7. A woman frightened in her first pregnancy by the sight of a child with a\r\nhare lip, had a child with a deformity of the same kind. Her second child\r\nhad a deep slit, and the third a mark of a similar character or modified\r\nhare lips. In this instance the morbid mind of the mother affected several\r\nsuccessive issues of her body.\r\n\r\n8. A pregnant woman became frightened at a lizard jumping into her bosom.\r\nShe bore a child with a fleshy excrescence exactly resembling a lizard,\r\ngrowing from the breast, adhering by the head and neck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{304}\r\n\r\nThe Care of New-Born Infants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. The first thing to be done ordinarily is to give the little stranger a\r\nbath by using soap and warm water. To remove the white material that\r\nusually covers the child use olive oil, goose oil or lard, and apply it\r\nwith a soft piece of worn flannel, and when the child is entirely clean rub\r\nall off with a fresh piece of flannel.\r\n\r\n2. Many physicians in the United States recommend a thorough oiling of the\r\nchild with pure lard or olive oil, and then rub dry as above stated. By\r\nthese means water is avoided, and with it much risk of taking cold.\r\n\r\n3. The application of brandy or liquor is entirely unnecessary, and\r\ngenerally does more injury than good. {305}\r\n\r\n4. If an infant should breathe feebly, or exhibit other signs of great\r\nfeebleness, it should not be washed at once, but allowed to remain quiet\r\nand undisturbed, warmly wrapped up until the vital actions have acquired a\r\nfair degree of activity.\r\n\r\n5. DRESSING THE NAVEL.--There is nothing better for dressing the navel than\r\nabsorbent antiseptic cotton. There needs be no grease or oil upon the\r\ncotton. After the separation of the cord the navel should be dressed with a\r\nlittle cosmoline, still using the absorbent cotton. The navel string\r\nusually separates in a week's time; it may be delayed for twice this length\r\nof time, this will make no material difference, and the rule is to allow it\r\nto drop off of its own accord.\r\n\r\n6. THE CLOTHING OF THE INFANT.--The clothing of the infant should be light,\r\nsoft and _perfectly_ loose. A soft flannel band is necessary _only_ until\r\nthe navel is healed. Afterwards discard bands entirely if you wish your\r\nbabe to be happy and well. Make the dresses \"Mother Hubbard\"--Put on first\r\na soft woolen shirt, then prepare the flannel skirts to hang from the neck\r\nlike a slip. Make one kind with sleeves and one just like it without\r\nsleeves, then white muslin skirts (if they are desired), all the same way.\r\nThen baby is ready for any weather. In intense heat simply put on the one\r\nflannel slip with sleeves, leaving off the shirt. In Spring and Fall the\r\nshirt and skirt with no sleeves. In cold weather shirt and both skirts.\r\nThese garments can be all put on at once, thus making the process of\r\ndressing very quick and easy. These are the most approved modern styles for\r\ndressing infants, and with long cashmere stockings pinned to the diapers\r\nthe little feet are free to kick with no old-fashioned pinning blanket to\r\ntorture the naturally active, healthy child, and retard its development. If\r\ntight bands are an injury to grown people, then in the name of pity\r\nemancipate the poor little infant from their torture!\r\n\r\n7. THE DIAPER.--Diapers should be of soft linen, and great care should be\r\nexercised not to pin them too tightly. Never dry them, but always wash them\r\nthoroughly before being used again.\r\n\r\n8. The band need not be worn after the navel has healed so that it requires\r\nno dressing, as it serves no purpose save to keep in place the dressing of\r\nthe navel. The child's body should be kept thoroughly warm around the\r\nchest, bowels and feet. Give the heart and lungs plenty of room to heave.\r\n\r\n9. The proper time for shortening the clothes is about three months in\r\nSummer and six months in Winter. {306}\r\n\r\n10. INFANT BATHING.--The first week of a child's life it should not be\r\nentirely stripped and washed. It is too exhausting. After a child is over a\r\nweek old it should be bathed every day; after a child is three weeks old it\r\nmay be put in the water and supported with one hand while it is being\r\nwashed with the other. Never, however, allow it to remain too long in the\r\nwater. From ten to twenty minutes is the limit. Use Pears' soap or castile\r\nsoap, and with a sponge wipe quickly, or use a soft towel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. The new-born infant requires only the mother's milk. The true mother\r\nwill nurse her child if it is a possibility. The infant will thrive better\r\nand have many more chances for life.\r\n\r\n2. The mother's milk is the natural food, and nothing can fully take its\r\nplace. It needs no feeding for the first few days as it was commonly deemed\r\nnecessary a few years ago. The secretions in the mother's breast are\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n3. ARTIFICIAL FOOD.--Tokology says: \"The best artificial food is cream\r\nreduced and sweetened with sugar of milk. Analysis shows that human milk\r\ncontains more cream and sugar and less casein than the milk of animals.\r\n{307}\r\n\r\n4. Milk should form the basis of all preparations of food. If the milk is\r\ntoo strong, indigestion will follow, and the child will lose instead of\r\ngaining strength.\r\n\r\nWEANING.--The weaning of the child depends much upon the strength and\r\ncondition of the mother. If it does not occur in hot weather, from nine to\r\ntwelve months is as long as any child should be nursed.\r\n\r\nFOOD IN WEANING.--Infants cry a great deal during weaning, but a few days\r\nof patient perseverance will overcome all difficulties. Give the child\r\npurely a milk diet, Graham bread, milk crackers and milk, or a little milk\r\nthickened with boiled rice, a little jelly, apple sauce, etc., may be\r\nsafely used. Cracked wheat, oatmeal, wheat germ, or anything of that kind\r\nthoroughly cooked and served with a little cream and sugar, is an excellent\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nMILK DRAWN FROM THE BREASTS.--If the mother suffers considerably from the\r\nmilk gathering in the breast after weaning the child, withdraw it by taking\r\na bottle that holds about a pint or a quart, putting a piece of cloth wrung\r\nout in warm water around the bottle, then fill it with boiling water, pour\r\nthe water out and apply the bottle to the breast, and the bottle cooling\r\nwill form a vacuum and will withdraw the milk into the bottle. This is one\r\nof the best methods now in use.\r\n\r\nRETURN OF THE MENSES.--If the menses return while the mother is nursing,\r\nthe child should at once be weaned, for the mother's milk no longer\r\ncontains sufficient nourishment. In case the mother should become pregnant\r\nwhile the child is nursing it should at once be weaned, or serious results\r\nwill follow to the health of the child. A mother's milk is no longer\r\nsufficiently rich to nourish the child or keep it in good health.\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE BOTTLE.--If the child is fed on the bottle, great care should\r\nbe taken in keeping it absolutely clean. Never use white rubber nipples. A\r\nplain form of bottle with a black rubber nipple is preferable.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN should not be permitted to come to the table until two years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nCHAFING.--One of the best remedies is powdered lycopodium; apply it every\r\ntime the babe is cleaned; but first wash with pure castile soap; Pears'\r\nsoap is also good. A preparation of oxide of zinc is also highly\r\nrecommended. Chafing sometimes results from an acid condition of the\r\nstomach; in that case give a few doses of castoria.\r\n\r\nCOLIC.--If an infant is seriously troubled with colic, there is nothing\r\nbetter than camomile or catnip tea. Procure the leaves and make tea and\r\ngive it as warm as the babe can bear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{308}\r\n\r\nFEEDING INFANTS.\r\n\r\n1. The best food for infants is mother's milk; next best is cow's milk.\r\nCow's milk contains about three times as much curd and one-half as much\r\nsugar, and it should be reduced with two parts of water.\r\n\r\n2. In feeding cow's milk there is too little cream and too little sugar,\r\nand there is no doubt no better preparation than Mellin's food to mix it\r\nwith (according to directions).\r\n\r\n3. Children being fed on food lacking fat generally have their teeth come\r\nlate; their muscles will be flabby and bones soft. Children will be too fat\r\nwhen their food contains too much sugar. Sugar always makes their flesh\r\nsoft and flabby.\r\n\r\n4. During the first two months the baby should be fed every two hours\r\nduring the day, and two or three times during the night, but no more. Ten\r\nor eleven feedings for twenty-four hours are all a child will bear and\r\nremain healthy. At three months the child may be fed every three hours\r\ninstead of every two.\r\n\r\n5. Children can be taught regular habits by being fed and put to sleep at\r\nthe same time every day and evening. Nervous diseases are caused by\r\nirregular hours of sleep and diet, and the use of soothing medicines.\r\n\r\n6. A child five or six months old should not be fed during the night--from\r\nnine in the evening until six or seven in the morning, as overfeeding\r\ncauses most of the wakefulness and nervousness of children during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n7. If a child vomits soon after taking the bottle, and there is an\r\nappearance of undigested food in the stool, it is a sign of overfeeding. If\r\na large part of the bottle has been vomited, avoid the next bottle at\r\nregular time and pass over one bottle. If the child is nursing the same\r\nprinciples apply.\r\n\r\n8. If a child empties its bottle and sucks vigorously its fingers after the\r\nbottle is emptied, it is very evident that the child is not fed enough, and\r\nshould have its food gradually increased.\r\n\r\n9. Give the baby a little cold water several times a day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANTILE CONVULSIONS.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An infantile convulsion corresponds to a chill in an adult,\r\nand is the most common brain affection among children.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--Anything that irritates the nervous system may cause convulsions\r\nin the child, as teething, indigestible food, worms, dropsy of the brain,\r\nhereditary constitution, or they may be the accompanying symptom in nearly\r\nall the {309} acute diseases of children, or when the eruption is\r\nsuppressed in eruptive diseases.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--In case of convulsions of a child parents usually become\r\nfrightened, and very rarely do the things that should be done in order to\r\nafford relief. The child, previous to the fit, is usually irritable, and\r\nthe twitching of the muscles of the face may be noticed, or it may come on\r\nsuddenly without warning. The child becomes insensible, clenches its hands\r\ntightly, lips turn blue, and the eyes become fixed, usually frothing from\r\nthe mouth with head turned back. The convulsion generally lasts two or\r\nthree minutes; sometimes, however, as long as ten or fifteen minutes, but\r\nrarely.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--Give the child a warm bath and rub gently. Clothes wrung out of\r\ncold water and applied to the lower and back part of the head and plenty of\r\nfresh air will usually relieve the convulsion. Be sure and loosen the\r\nclothing around the child's neck. After the convulsion is over, give the\r\nchild a few doses of potassic bromide, and an injection of castor oil if\r\nthe abdomen is swollen. Potassic bromide should be kept in the house, to\r\nuse in case of necessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{310}\r\n\r\nPains and Ills in Nursing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The City Hospital.--A Homeless and Friendless Mother.]\r\n\r\n1. SORE NIPPLES.--If a lady, during the latter few months of her pregnancy,\r\nwere to adopt \"means to harden the nipples,\" sore nipples during the period\r\nof suckling would not be so prevalent as they are.\r\n\r\n2. CAUSE.--A sore nipple is frequently produced by the injudicious custom\r\nof allowing the child to have the nipple {311} almost constantly in his\r\nmouth. Another frequent cause of a sore nipple is from the babe having the\r\ncanker. Another cause of a sore nipple is from the mother, after the babe\r\nhas been sucking, putting up the nipple wet. She, therefore, ought always\r\nto dry the nipple, not by rubbing, but by dabbing it with a soft cambric or\r\nlawn handkerchief, or with a piece of soft linen rag--one or the other of\r\nwhich ought always to be at hand--every time directly after the child has\r\ndone sucking, and just before applying any of the following powders or\r\nlotions to the nipple.\r\n\r\n3. REMEDIES.--One of the best remedies for a sore nipple is the following\r\npowder:\r\n\r\nTake of--Borax, one drachm; Powdered Starch, seven drachms.\r\n\r\nMix.--A pinch of the powder to be frequently applied to the nipple.\r\n\r\nIf the above does not cure, try Glycerine by applying it each time after\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n4. GATHERED BREAST.--A healthy-woman with a well-developed breast and a\r\ngood nipple, scarcely, if ever, has a gathered bosom; it is the delicate,\r\nthe ill-developed breasted and worse-developed nippled lady who usually\r\nsuffers from this painful complaint. And why? The evil can generally be\r\ntraced to girlhood. If she be brought up luxuriously, her health and her\r\nbreasts are sure to be weakened, and thus to suffer, more especially if the\r\ndevelopment of the bosoms and nipples has been arrested and interfered with\r\nby tight stays and corsets. Why, the nipple is by them drawn in, and\r\nretained on the level with the breast--countersunk--as though it were of no\r\nconsequence to her future well-being, as though it were a thing of nought.\r\n\r\n5. TIGHT LACERS.--Tight lacers will have to pay the penalties of which they\r\nlittle dream. Oh, the monstrous folly of such proceedings! When will\r\nmothers awake from their lethargy? It is high time that they did so! From\r\nthe mother having \"no nipple,\" the effects of tight lacing, many a home has\r\nbeen made childless, the babe not being able to procure its proper\r\nnourishment, and dying in consequence! It is a frightful state of things!\r\nBut fashion, unfortunately, blinds the eyes and deafens the ears of its\r\nvotaries!\r\n\r\n6. BAD BREAST.--A gathered bosom, or \"bad breast,\" as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, is more likely to occur after a first confinement and during the\r\nfirst month. Great care, therefore, ought to be taken to avoid such a\r\nmisfortune. A gathered breast is frequently owing to the carelessness of a\r\n{312} mother in not covering her bosoms during the time she is suckling.\r\nToo much attention cannot be paid to keeping the breasts comfortably warm.\r\nThis, during the act of nursing, should be done by throwing either a shawl\r\nor a square of flannel over the neck, shoulders, and bosoms.\r\n\r\n7. ANOTHER CAUSE.--Another cause of gathered breasts arises from a mother\r\nsitting up in bed to suckle her babe. He ought to be accustomed to take the\r\nbosom while she is lying down; if this habit is not at first instituted, it\r\nwill be difficult to adopt it afterwards. Good habits may be taught a child\r\nfrom earliest babyhood.\r\n\r\n8. FAINTNESS.--When a nursing mother feels faint, she ought immediately to\r\nlie down and take a little nourishment; a cup of tea with the yolk of an\r\negg beaten up in it, or a cup of warm milk, or some beef-tea, any of which\r\nwill answer the purpose extremely well. Brandy, or any other spirit we\r\nwould not recommend, as it would only cause, as soon as the immediate\r\neffects of the stimulant had gone off, a greater depression to ensue; not\r\nonly so, but the frequent taking of brandy might become a habit--a\r\nnecessity--which would be a calamity deeply to be deplored!\r\n\r\n9. STRONG PURGATIVES.--Strong purgatives during this period are highly\r\nimproper, as they are apt to give pain to the infant, as well as to injure\r\nthe mother. If it be absolutely necessary to give physic, the mildest, such\r\nas a dose of castor oil, should be chosen.\r\n\r\n10. HABITUALLY COSTIVE.--When a lady who is nursing is habitually costive,\r\nshe ought to eat brown instead of white bread. This will, in the majority\r\nof cases, enable her to do without an aperient. The brown bread may be made\r\nwith flour finely ground all one way; or by mixing one part of bran and\r\nthree parts of fine wheaten flour together, and then making it in the usual\r\nway into bread. Treacle instead of butter, on the brown bread increases its\r\nefficacy as an aperient; and raw should be substituted for lump sugar in\r\nher tea.\r\n\r\n11. TO PREVENT CONSTIPATION.--Stewed prunes, or stewed French plums, or\r\nstewed Normandy pippins, are excellent remedies to prevent constipation.\r\nThe patient ought to eat, every morning, a dozen or fifteen of them. The\r\nbest way to stew either prunes or French plums, is the following:--Put a\r\npound of either prunes or French plums, and two tablespoonfuls of raw\r\nsugar, into a brown jar; cover them with water; put them into a slow oven,\r\nand stew them for three or four hours. Both stewed rhubarb and stewed {313}\r\npears often act as mild and gentle aperients. Muscatel raisins, eaten at\r\ndessert, will oftentimes without medicine relieve the bowels.\r\n\r\n12. COLD WATER.--A tumblerful of cold water, taken early every morning,\r\nsometimes effectually relieves the bowels; indeed, few people know the\r\nvalue of cold water as an aperient--it is one of the best we possess, and,\r\nunlike drug aperients, can never by any possibility do any harm. An\r\ninjection of warm water is one of the best ways to relieve the bowels.\r\n\r\n13. WELL-COOKED VEGETABLES.--Although a nursing mother ought, more\r\nespecially if she be costive, to take a variety of well-cooked vegetables,\r\nsuch as potatoes, asparagus, cauliflower, French beans, spinach, stewed\r\ncelery and turnips; she should avoid eating greens, cabbages, and pickles,\r\nas they would be likely to affect the babe, and might cause him to suffer\r\nfrom gripings, from pain, and \"looseness\" of the bowels.\r\n\r\n14. SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF TAKING PHYSIC.--Let me again--for it cannot\r\nbe too urgently insisted upon--strongly advise a nursing mother to use\r\nevery means in the way of diet, etc., to supersede the necessity of taking\r\nphysic (opening medicine), as the repetition of aperients injures, and that\r\nseverely, both herself and child. Moreover, the more opening medicine she\r\nswallows, the more she requires; so that if she once gets into the habit of\r\nregularly taking physic, the bowels will not act without them. What a\r\nmiserable existence to be always swallowing physic!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{314}\r\n\r\nHome Lessons in Nursing Sick Children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEALTHY YOUTH AND RIPE OLD AGE.]\r\n\r\n1. MISMANAGEMENT.--Every doctor knows that a large share of the ills to\r\nwhich infancy is subject are directly traceable to mismanagement. Troubles\r\nof the digestive system are, for the most part due to errors, either in the\r\nselection of the food or in the preparation of it.\r\n\r\n2. RESPIRATORY DISEASES.--Respiratory diseases or the diseases of the\r\nthroat and lungs have their origin, as a rule, in want of care and judgment\r\nin matters of clothing, bathing and exposure to cold and drafts. A child\r\nshould always be dressed to suit the existing temperature of the weather.\r\n{315}\r\n\r\n3. NERVOUS DISEASES.--Nervous diseases are often aggravated if not caused\r\nby over-stimulation of the brain, by irregular hours of sleep, or by the\r\nuse of \"soothing\" medicines, or eating indigestible food.\r\n\r\n4. SKIN AFFECTIONS.--Skin affections are generally due to want of proper\r\ncare of the skin, to improper clothing or feeding, or to indiscriminate\r\nassociation with nurses and children, who are the carriers of contagious\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n5. PERMANENT INJURY.--Permanent injury is often caused by lifting the child\r\nby one hand, allowing it to fall, permitting it to play with sharp\r\ninstruments, etc.\r\n\r\n6. RULES AND PRINCIPLES.--Every mother should understand the rules and\r\nprinciples of home nursing. Children are very tender plants and the want of\r\nproper knowledge is often very disastrous if not fatal. Study carefully and\r\nfollow the principles and rules which are laid down in the different parts\r\nof this work on nursing and cooking for the sick.\r\n\r\n7. WHAT A MOTHER SHOULD KNOW:\r\n\r\n    I. INFANT FEEDING.--The care of milk, milk sterilization, care of\r\n    bottles, preparation of commonly employed infant foods, the general\r\n    principles of infant feeding, with rules as to quality and frequency.\r\n\r\n    II. BATHING.--The daily bath; the use of hot, cold and mustard baths.\r\n\r\n    III. HYGIENE OF THE SKIN. Care of the mouth, eyes and ears.\r\n    Ventilation, temperature, cleanliness, care of napkins, etc.\r\n\r\n    IV. TRAINING OF CHILDREN in proper bodily habits. Simple means of\r\n    treatment in sickness, etc.\r\n\r\n8. THE CRY OF THE SICK CHILD.--The cry of the child is a language by which\r\nthe character of its suffering to some extent may be ascertained. The\r\nmanner in which the cry is uttered, or the pitch and tone is generally a\r\nsymptom of a certain kind of disease.\r\n\r\n9. STOMACHACHE.--The cry of the child in suffering with pain of the stomach\r\nis loud, excitable and spasmodic. The legs are drawn up and as the pain\r\nceases, they are relaxed and the child sobs itself to sleep, and rests\r\nuntil awakened again by pain.\r\n\r\n10. LUNG TROUBLE.--When a child is suffering with an affection of the lungs\r\nor throat, it never cries loudly or continuously. A distress in breathing\r\ncauses a sort of subdued cry and low moaning. If there is a slight cough it\r\nis generally a sign that there is some complication with the lungs. {316}\r\n\r\n11. DISEASE OF THE BRAIN.--In disease of the brain the cry is always sharp,\r\nshort and piercing. Drowsiness generally follows each spasm of pain.\r\n\r\n12. FEVERS.--Children rarely cry when suffering with fever unless they are\r\ndisturbed. They should be handled very gently and spoken to in a very quiet\r\nand tender tone of voice.\r\n\r\n13. THE CHAMBER OF THE SICK ROOM.--The room of the sick child should be\r\nkept scrupulously clean. No noise should disturb the quiet and rest of the\r\nchild. If the weather is mild, plenty of fresh air should be admitted; the\r\ntemperature should be kept at about 70 degrees. A thermometer should be\r\nkept in the room, and the air should be changed several times during the\r\nday. This may be done with safety to the child by covering it up with\r\nwoolen blankets to protect it from draft, while the windows and doors are\r\nopened. Fresh air often does more to restore the sick child than the\r\ndoctor's medicine. Take the best room in the house. If necessary take the\r\nparlor, always make the room pleasant for the sick.\r\n\r\n14. VISITORS.--Carefully avoid the conversation of visitors or the loud and\r\nboisterous playing of children in the house. If there is much noise about\r\nthe house that cannot be avoided, it is a good plan to put cotton in the\r\nears of the patient.\r\n\r\n15. LIGHT IN THE ROOM.--Light has a tendency to produce nervous\r\nirritability, consequently it is best to exclude as much daylight as\r\npossible and keep the room in a sort of twilight until the child begins to\r\nimprove. Be careful to avoid any odor coming from a burning lamp in the\r\nnight. When the child begins to recover, give it plenty of sunlight. After\r\nthe child begins to get better let in all the sunlight the windows will\r\nadmit. Take a south room for the sick bed.\r\n\r\n16. SICKNESS IN SUMMER.--If the weather is very hot it is a good plan to\r\ndampen the floors with cold water, or set several dishes of water in the\r\nroom, but be careful to keep the patient out of the draft, and avoid any\r\nsudden change of temperature.\r\n\r\n17. BATHING.--Bathe every sick child in warm water once a day unless\r\nprohibited by the doctor. If the child has a spasm or any attack of a\r\nserious nervous character in absence of the doctor, place him in a hot bath\r\nat once. Hot water is one of the finest agencies for the cure of nervous\r\ndiseases. {317}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n18. SCARLET FEVER AND MEASLES.--Bathe the child in warm water to bring out\r\nthe rash, and put in about a dessertspoonful of mustard into each bath.\r\n\r\n19. DRINKS.--If a child is suffering with fevers, let it have all the water\r\nit wants. Toast-water will be found nourishing. When the stomach of the\r\nchild is in an irritable condition, nourishments containing milk or any\r\nother fluid should be given very sparingly. Barley-water and rice-water are\r\nvery soothing to an irritable stomach.\r\n\r\n20. FOOD.--Mellin's Food and milk is very nourishing if the child will take\r\nit. Oatmeal gruel, white of eggs, etc. are excellent and nourishing\r\narticles. See \"How to cook for the Sick.\"\r\n\r\n21. EATING FRUIT.--Let children who are recovering from sickness eat\r\nmoderately of good fresh fruit. Never let a child, whether well or sick,\r\neat the skins of any kind of fruit. The outer covering of fruit was not\r\nmade to eat, and often has poisonous matter very injurious to health upon\r\nits surface. Contagious and infectious diseases are often communicated in\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n22. SUDDEN STARTINGS with the thumbs drawn into the palms, portend trouble\r\nwith the brain, and often end in convulsions, which are far more serious in\r\ninfants than in children. Convulsions in children often result from a\r\nsuppression of urine. If you have occasion to believe that such is the\r\ncase, get the patient to sweating as soon as possible. Give it a hot bath,\r\nafter which cover it up in bed and put bags of hot salt over the lower part\r\nof the abdomen.\r\n\r\n23. SYMPTOMS OF INDIGESTION.--If the baby shows symptoms of indigestion, do\r\nnot begin giving it medicine. It is wiser to decrease the quantity and\r\nquality of the food and let the little one omit one meal entirely, that his\r\nstomach may rest. Avoid all starchy foods, as the organs of digestion are\r\nnot sufficiently developed to receive them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{318}\r\n\r\nA Practical Rule for Feeding a Baby on Cow's Milk.\r\n\r\nCow's milk is steadily growing in favor as an artificial food. Country milk\r\nshould be used instead of milk purchased in town or city.\r\n\r\nRULE--Take the upper half of milk that has stood an hour of two, dilute,\r\nnot hardly as much as a third, with sweetened water, and if there is a\r\ntendency to sour stomach, put in a teaspoonful of lime water to every\r\nquart. The milk and water should both be boiled separately. If the baby is\r\nconstipated, it is best to heat the milk over boiling water and not allow\r\nit to boil.\r\n\r\nINFANT FOOD FOR 24 HOURS.\r\n\r\n       Age of Child.           Milk.

The mother's milk is the natural food, and nothing can fully take its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n2. The infant's stomach does not readily accommodate itself to changes in\r\ndiet; therefore, regularity in quality, quantity and temperature is\r\nextremely necessary.\r\n\r\n3. Not until a child is a year old should it be allowed any food except\r\nthat of milk, and possibly a little cracker or bread, thoroughly soaked and\r\nsoftened.\r\n\r\n4. Meat should never be given to very young children. The best artificial\r\nfood is cream, reduced and sweetened with sugar and milk. No rule can be\r\ngiven for its reduction. Observation and experience must teach that,\r\nbecause every child's stomach is governed by a rule of its own.\r\n\r\n5. A child can be safely weaned at one year of age, and sometimes less. It\r\ndepends entirely upon the season, and upon the health of the child.\r\n\r\n6. A child should never be weaned during the warm weather, in June, July or\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n7. When a child is weaned it may be given, in connection {320} with the\r\nmilk diet, some such nourishment as broth, gruel, egg, or some prepared\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n8. A child should never be allowed to come to the table until two years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\n9. A child should never eat much starchy food until four years old.\r\n\r\n10. A child should have all the water it desires to drink, but it is\r\ndecidedly the best to boil the water first, and allow it to cool. All the\r\nimpurities and disease germs are thereby destroyed. This one thing alone\r\nwill add greatly to the health and vigor of the child.\r\n\r\n11. Where there is a tendency to bowel disorder, a little gum arabic, rice,\r\nor barley may be boiled with the drinking water.\r\n\r\n12. If the child uses a bottle it should be kept absolutely clean. It is\r\nbest to have two or three bottles, so that one will always be perfectly\r\nclean and fresh.\r\n\r\n13. The nipple should be of black or pure rubber, and not of the white or\r\nvulcanized rubber; it should fit over the top of the bottle. No tubes\r\nshould ever be used; it is impossible to keep them clean.\r\n\r\n14. When the rubber becomes coated, a little coarse salt will clean it.\r\n\r\n15. Babies should be fed at regular times. They should also be put to sleep\r\nat regular hours. Regularity is one of the best safeguards to health.\r\n\r\n16. Milk for babies and children should be from healthy cows. Milk from\r\ndifferent cows varies, and it is always better for a child to have milk\r\nfrom the same cow. A farrow cow's milk is preferable, especially if the\r\nchild is not very strong.\r\n\r\n17. Many of the prepared foods advertised for children are of little\r\nbenefit. A few may be good, but what is good for one child may not be for\r\nanother. So it must be simply a matter of experiment if any of the\r\nadvertised foods are used.\r\n\r\n18. It is a physiological fact that an infant is always healthier and\r\nbetter to sleep alone. It gets better air and is not liable to suffocation.\r\n\r\n19. A healthy child should never be fed in less than two hours from the\r\nlast time they finished before, gradually lengthening the time as it grows\r\nolder. At 4 months 3½ or 4 hours; at 5 months a healthy child will be\r\nbetter if given nothing in the night except, perhaps, a little water.\r\n\r\n20. Give an infant a little water several times a day.\r\n\r\n21. A delicate child the first year should be oiled after each bath. The\r\noiling may often take the place of the bath, in case of a cold.\r\n\r\n22. In oiling a babe, use pure olive oil, and wipe off thoroughly after\r\neach application. For nourishing a weak child use also olive oil.\r\n\r\n23. For colds, coughs, croup, etc., use goose oil externally and give a\r\nteaspoonful at bed-time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{321}\r\n\r\nHOW TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH AND LIFE OF YOUR INFANT DURING HOT WEATHER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUND UPON THE DOOR STEP.]\r\n\r\n_BATHING._\r\n\r\n1. Bathe infants daily in tepid water and even twice a day in hot weather.\r\n\r\nIf delicate they should be sponged instead of immersing them in water, but\r\ncleanliness is absolutely necessary for the health of infants.\r\n\r\n_CLOTHING._\r\n\r\n2. Put no bands in their clothing, but make all garments to hang loosely\r\nfrom the shoulders, and have all their clothing _scrupulously clean_; even\r\nthe diaper should not be re-used without rinsing. {322}\r\n\r\n_SLEEP ALONE._\r\n\r\n3. The child should in all cases sleep by itself on a cot or in a crib and\r\nretire at a regular hour. A child _always_ early taught to go to sleep\r\nwithout rocking or nursing is the healthier and happier for it. Begin _at\r\nbirth_ and this will be easily accomplished.\r\n\r\n_CORDIALS AND SOOTHING SYRUPS._\r\n\r\n4. Never give cordials, soothing syrups, sleeping drops, etc., without the\r\nadvice of a physician. A child that frets and does not sleep is either\r\nhungry or ill. _If ill it needs a physician._ Never give candy or cake to\r\nquiet a small child, they are sure to produce disorders of the stomach,\r\ndiarrhoea or some other trouble.\r\n\r\n_FRESH AIR._\r\n\r\n5. Children should have plenty of fresh air summer as well as winter. Avoid\r\nthe severe hot sun and the heated kitchen for infants in summer. Heat is\r\nthe great destroyer of infants. In excessive hot weather feed them with\r\nchips of ice occasionally, if you have it.\r\n\r\n_CLEAN HOUSES._\r\n\r\n6. Keep your house clean and cool and well aired night and day. Your\r\ncellars cleared of all rubbish and whitewashed every spring, your drains\r\ncleaned with strong solution of copperas or chloride of lime, poured down\r\nthem once a week. Keep your gutters and yards clean and insist upon your\r\nneighbors doing the same.\r\n\r\n_EVACUATIONS OF A CHILD._\r\n\r\nThe healthy motion varies from light orange yellow to greenish yellow, in\r\nnumber, two to four times daily. Smell should never be offensive. Slimy\r\nmucous-like jelly passages indicate worms. Pale green, offensive, acrid\r\nmotions indicate disordered stomach. Dark green indicate acid secretions\r\nand a more serious trouble.\r\n\r\nFetid dark brown stools are present in chronic diarrhoea. Putty-like pasty\r\npassages are due to acidity curdling the milk or to torpid liver. {323}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_BREAST MILK._\r\n\r\n7. Breast milk is the only proper food for infants, until after the second\r\nsummer. If the supply is small keep what you have and feed the child in\r\nconnection with it, for if the babe is ill this breast milk may be all that\r\nwill save its life.\r\n\r\n_STERILIZED MILK._\r\n\r\n8. Milk is the best food. Goat's milk best, cows milk next. If the child\r\nthrives on this _nothing else_ should be given during the hot weather,\r\nuntil the front teeth are cut. Get fresh cow's milk twice a day if the\r\nchild requires food in the night, pour it into a glass fruit jar with\r\none-third pure water for a child under three months old, afterwards the\r\nproportion of water may be less and less, also a trifle of sugar may be\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThen place the jar in a kettle or pan of cold water, like the bottom of an\r\noatmeal kettle. Leave the cover of the jar loose. Place it on the stove and\r\nlet the water come to a boil and boil ten minutes, screw down the cover\r\ntight and boil ten minutes more, then remove from the fire, and allow it to\r\ncool in the water slowly so as not to break the jar. When partly cool put\r\non the ice or in a cool place, and keep tightly covered except when the\r\nmilk is poured out for use. The glass jar must be kept perfectly clean and\r\nwashed {324} and scalded carefully before use. A tablespoonful of lime\r\nwater to a bottle of milk will aid indigestion. Discard the bottle as soon\r\nas possible and use a cup which you know is clean, whereas a bottle must be\r\nkept in water constantly when not in use, or the sour milk will make the\r\nchild sick. Use no tube for it is exceedingly hard to keep it clean, and if\r\npure milk cannot be had, condensed milk is admirable and does not need to\r\nbe sterilized as the above.\r\n\r\n_DIET._\r\n\r\n9. Never give babies under two years old such food as grown persons eat.\r\nTheir chief diet should be milk, wheat bread and milk, oatmeal, possibly a\r\nlittle rare boiled egg, but always and chiefly milk. Germ wheat is also\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\n_EXERCISE._\r\n\r\n10. Children should have exercise in the house as well as outdoors, but\r\nshould not be jolted and jumped and jarred in rough play, not rudely rocked\r\nin the cradle, nor carelessly trundled over bumps in their carriages. They\r\nshould not be held too much in the arms, but allowed to crawl and kick upon\r\nthe floor and develop their limbs and muscles. A child should not be lifted\r\nby its arms, nor dragged along by one hand after it learns to take a few\r\nfeeble steps, but when they do learn to walk steadily it is the best of all\r\nexercise, especially in the open air.\r\n\r\nLet the children as they grow older romp and play in the open air all they\r\nwish, girls as well as boys. Give the girls an even chance for health,\r\nwhile they are young at least, and don't mind about their complexion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{325}\r\n\r\nInfant Teething.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. REMARKABLE INSTANCES.--There are instances where babies have been born\r\nwith teeth, and, on the other hand, there are cases of persons who have\r\nnever had any teeth at all; and others that had double teeth all around in\r\nboth upper and lower jaws, but these are rare instances, and may be termed\r\nas a sort of freaks of nature.\r\n\r\n2. INFANT TEETHING.--The first teeth generally make their appearance after\r\nthe third month, and during the period of teething the child is fretful and\r\nrestless, causing sometimes constitutional disturbances, such as diarrhoea,\r\nindigestion, etc. Usually, however, no serious results follow, and no\r\nunnecessary anxiety need be felt, unless the weather is extremely warm,\r\nthen there is some danger of summer complaint setting in and seriously\r\ncomplicating matters.\r\n\r\n3. THE NUMBER OF TEETH.--Teeth are generally cut in pairs and make their\r\nappearance first in the front and going backwards until all are complete.\r\nIt generally takes about {326} two years for a temporary set of children's\r\nteeth. A child two or three years old should have twenty teeth. After the\r\nage of seven they generally begin to loosen and fall out and permanent\r\nteeth take their place.\r\n\r\n4. LANCING THE GUMS.--This is very rarely necessary. There are extreme\r\ncases when the condition of the mouth and health of the child demand a\r\nphysician's lance but this should not be resorted to, unless it is\r\nabsolutely necessary. When the gums are very much swollen and the tooth is\r\nnearly through, the pains may be relieved by the mother taking a thimble\r\nand pressing it down upon the tooth, the sharp edges of the tooth will cut\r\nthrough the swollen flesh, and instant relief will follow. A child in a few\r\nhours or a day will be perfectly happy after a very severe and trying time\r\nof sickness.\r\n\r\n5. PERMANENT TEETH.--The teeth are firmly inserted in sockets of the upper\r\nand lower jaw. The permanent teeth which follow the temporary teeth, when\r\ncomplete, are sixteen in each jaw, or thirty-two in all.\r\n\r\n6. NAMES OF TEETH.--There are four incisors (front teeth), four cuspids\r\n(eye teeth), four bicuspids (grinders), and four molars (large grinders),\r\nin each jaw. Each tooth is divided into the crown, body, and root. The\r\ncrown is the grinding surface; the body--the part projecting from the\r\njaw--is the seat of sensation and nutrition; the root is that portion of\r\nthe tooth which is inserted in the alveolus. The teeth are composed of\r\ndentine (ivory) and enamel. The ivory forms the greater portion of the body\r\nand root, while the enamel covers the exposed surface. The small white\r\ncords communicating with the teeth are the nerves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{327}\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. Out of the 984,000 persons that died during the year of 1890, 227,264\r\ndid not reach one year of age, and 400,647 died under five years of age.\r\n\r\nWhat a fearful responsibility therefore rests upon the parents who permit\r\nthese hundreds of thousands of children to die annually. This terrible\r\nmortality among children is undoubtedly largely the result of ignorance as\r\nregarding to the proper care and treatment of sick children.\r\n\r\n2. For very small children it is always best to use homoeopathic remedies.\r\n\r\n_COLIC._\r\n\r\n1. Babies often suffer severely with colic. It is not considered dangerous,\r\nbut causes considerable suffering.\r\n\r\n2. Severe colic is usually the result of derangement of the liver in the\r\nmother, or of her insufficient or improper nourishment, and it occurs more\r\nfrequently when the child is from two to five months old. {328}\r\n\r\n3. Let the mother eat chiefly barley, wheat and bread, rolled wheat, graham\r\nbread, fish, milk, eggs and fruit. The latter may be freely eaten, avoiding\r\nthat which is very sour.\r\n\r\n4. A rubber bag or bottle filled with hot water put into a crib, will keep\r\nthe child, once quieted, asleep for hours. If a child is suffering from\r\ncolic, it should be thoroughly warmed and kept warm.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid giving opiates of any kind, such as cordials, Mrs. Winslow's\r\nSoothing Syrup, \"Mother's Friend,\" and various other patent medicines. They\r\ninjure the stomach and health of the child, instead of benefiting it.\r\n\r\n6. REMEDIES.--A few tablespoonfuls of hot water will often allay a severe\r\nattack of the colic. Catnip tea is also a good remedy.\r\n\r\nA drop of essence of peppermint in 6 or 7 teaspoonfuls of hot water will\r\ngive relief.\r\n\r\nIf the stools are green and the child is very restless, give chamomilla.\r\n\r\nIf the child is suffering from constipation, and undigested curds of milk\r\nappear in its fæces, and the child starts suddenly in its sleep, give nux\r\nvomica.\r\n\r\nAn injection of a few spoonfuls of hot water into the rectum with a little\r\nasafoetida is an effective remedy, and will be good for an adult.\r\n\r\n_CONSTIPATION._\r\n\r\n1. This is a very frequent ailment of infants. The first thing necessary is\r\nfor the mother to regulate her diet.\r\n\r\n2. If the child is nursed regularly and held out at the same time of each\r\nday, it will seldom be troubled with this complaint. Give plenty of\r\n_water_. Regularity of habit is the remedy. If this method fails, use a\r\nsoap suppository. Make it by paring a piece of white castile soap round. It\r\nshould be made about the size of a lead pencil, pointed at the end.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid giving a baby drugs. Let the physician administer them if\r\nnecessary. {329}\r\n\r\n_DIARRHOEA._\r\n\r\nGreat care should be exercised by parents in checking the diarrhoea of\r\nchildren. Many times serious diseases are brought on by parents being too\r\nhasty in checking this disorder of the bowels. It is an infant's first\r\nmethod of removing obstructions and overcoming derangements of the system.\r\n\r\n_SUMMER COMPLAINT._\r\n\r\n1. Summer complaint is an irritation and inflammation of the lining\r\nmembranes of the intestines. This may often be caused by teething, eating\r\nindigestible food, etc.\r\n\r\n2. If the discharges are only frequent and yellow and not accompanied with\r\npain, there is no cause for anxiety; but if the discharges are green, soon\r\nbecoming gray, brown and sometimes frothy, having a mixture of phlegm, and\r\nsometimes containing food undigested, a physician had better be summoned.\r\n\r\n3. For mild attacks the following treatment may be given:\r\n\r\n1) Keep the child perfectly quiet and keep the room well aired.\r\n\r\n2) Put a drop of tincture of camphor on a teaspoonful of sugar, mix\r\nthoroughly; then add 6 teaspoonfuls of hot water and give a teaspoonful of\r\nthe mixture every ten minutes. This is indicated where the discharges are\r\nwatery, and where there is vomiting and coldness of the feet and hands.\r\nChamomilla is also an excellent remedy. Ipecac and nux vomica may also be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIn giving homoeopathic remedies, give 5 or 6 pellets every 2 or 3 hours.\r\n\r\n3) The diet should be wholesome and nourishing.\r\n\r\n_FOR TEETHING._\r\n\r\nIf a child is suffering with swollen gums, is feverish, restless, and\r\nstarts in its sleep, give nux vomica. {330}\r\n\r\nWORMS.\r\n\r\n_PIN WORMS._\r\n\r\nPin worms and round worms are the most common in children. They are\r\ngenerally found in the lower bowels.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Restlessness, itching about the anus in the fore part of the\r\nevening, and worms in the fæces.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Give with a syringe an injection of a tablespoonful of linseed\r\noil. Cleanliness is also very necessary.\r\n\r\n_ROUND WORMS._\r\n\r\nA round worm is from six to sixteen inches in length, resembling the common\r\nearth worm. It inhabits generally the small intestines, but it sometimes\r\nenters the stomach and is thrown up by vomiting.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Distress, indigestion, swelling of the abdomen, grinding of the\r\nteeth, restlessness, and sometimes convulsions.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--One teaspoonful of powdered wormseed mixed with a sufficient\r\nquantity of molasses, or spread on bread and butter.\r\n\r\nOr, one grain of santonine every four hours for two or three days, followed\r\nby a brisk cathartic. Wormwood tea is also highly recommended.\r\n\r\n  SWAIM'S VERMIFUGE.\r\n  2 ounces wormseed,\r\n  1½ ounces valerian,\r\n  1½ ounces rhubarb,\r\n  1½ ounces pink-root,\r\n  1½ ounces white agaric.\r\n\r\nBoil in sufficient water to yield 3 quarts of decoction, and add to it 30\r\ndrops of oil of tansy and 45 drops of oil of cloves, dissolved in a quart\r\nof rectified spirits.

Comes on suddenly and usually at night, without much warning.\r\nIt is a purely nervous disease and may be caused by reflex nervous\r\nirritation from undigested food in the stomach or bowels, irritation of the\r\ngums in dentition, or from brain disorders.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Child awakens suddenly at night with suspended respiration or\r\nvery difficult breathing. After a few respirations it cries out and then\r\nfalls asleep quietly, or the attack may last an hour or so, when the face\r\nwill become pale, veins in the neck become turgid and feet and hands\r\ncontract spasmodically. In mild cases the attacks will only occur once\r\nduring the night, but may recur on the following night.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--During the paroxysm dashing cold water in the face is a\r\ncommon remedy. To terminate the spasm and prevent its return give\r\nteaspoonful doses of {332} powdered alum. The syrup of squills is an old\r\nand tried remedy; give in 15 to 30 drop doses and repeat every 10 minutes\r\ntill vomiting occurs. Seek out the cause if possible and remove it. It\r\ncommonly lies in some derangement of the digestive organs.\r\n\r\n_TRUE CROUP._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This disease consists of an inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the upper air passages, particularly of the larynx with the\r\nformation of a false membrane that obstructs the breathing. The disease is\r\nmost common in children between the ages of two and seven years, but it may\r\noccur at any age.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Usually there are symptoms of a cold for three or four days\r\nprevious to the attack. Marked hoarseness is observed in the evening with a\r\nringing metallic cough and some difficulty in breathing, which increases\r\nand becomes somewhat paroxysmal till the face which was at first flushed\r\nbecomes pallid and ashy in hue. The efforts at breathing become very great,\r\nand unless the child gets speedy relief it will die of suffocation.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Patient should be kept in a moist warm atmosphere, and\r\ncold water applied to the neck early in the attack. As soon as the\r\nbreathing seems difficult give a half to one teaspoonful of powdered alum\r\nin honey to produce vomiting and apply the remedies suggested in the\r\ntreatment of diphtheria, as the two diseases are thought by many to be\r\nidentical. When the breathing becomes labored and face becomes pallid, the\r\ncondition is very serious and a physician should be called without delay.\r\n\r\n_SCARLET FEVER._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An eruptive contagious disease, brought about by direct\r\nexposure to those having the disease, or by contact with clothing, dishes,\r\nor other articles, used about the sick room.\r\n\r\nThe clothing may be disinfected by heating to a temperature of 230°\r\nFahrenheit or by dipping in boiling water before washing. {333}\r\n\r\nDogs and cats will also carry the disease and should be kept from the\r\nhouse, and particularly from the sick room.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Chilly sensations or a decided chill, fever, headache, furred\r\ntongue, vomiting, sore throat, rapid pulse, hot dry skin and more or less\r\nstupor. In from 6 to 18 hours a fine red rash appears about the ears, neck\r\nand shoulders, which rapidly spreads to the entire surface of the body.\r\nAfter a few days, a scurf or branny scales will begin to form on the skin.\r\nThese scales are the principal source of contagion.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n1. Isolate the patient from other members of the family to prevent the\r\nspread of the disease.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the patient in bed and give a fluid diet of milk gruel, beef tea,\r\netc., with plenty of cold water to drink.\r\n\r\n3. Control the fever by sponging the body with tepid water, and relieve the\r\npain in the throat by cold compresses, applied externally.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as the skin shows a tendency to become scaly, apply goose grease\r\nor clean lard with a little boracic acid powder dusted in it, or better,\r\nperhaps, carbolized vaseline to relieve the itching and prevent the scales\r\nfrom being scattered about, and subjecting others to the contagion.\r\n\r\nREGULAR TREATMENT.--A few drops of aconite every three hours to regulate\r\nthe pulse, and if the skin be pale and circulation feeble, with tardy\r\neruption, administer one to ten drops of tincture of belladonna, according\r\nto the age of the patient. At the end of third week, if eyes look puffy and\r\nfeet swell, there is danger of Acute Bright's disease, and a physician\r\nshould be consulted. If the case does not progress well under the home\r\nremedies suggested, a physician should be called at once.\r\n\r\n_WHOOPING COUGH._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This is a contagious disease which is known by a peculiar\r\nwhooping sound in the cough. Considerable mucus is thrown off after each\r\nattack of spasmodic coughing.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--It usually commences with the symptoms of a common cold in the\r\nhead, some chilliness, feverishness, {334} restlessness, headache, a\r\nfeeling of tightness across the chest, violent paroxysms of coughing,\r\nsometimes almost threatening suffocation, and accompanied with vomiting.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Patient should eat plain food and avoid cold drafts and\r\ndamp air, but keep in the open air as much as possible. A strong tea made\r\nof the tops of red clover is highly recommended. A strong tea made of\r\nchestnut leaves, sweetened with sugar, is also very good.\r\n\r\n  1 teaspoonful of powdered alum.\r\n  1 teaspoonful of syrup.\r\n\r\nMix in a tumbler of water, and give the child one teaspoonful every two or\r\nthree hours. A kerosene lamp kept burning in the bed chamber at night is\r\nsaid to lessen the cough and shorten the course of the disease.\r\n\r\n_MUMPS._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This is a contagious disease causing the inflammation of the\r\nsalivary glands, and is generally a disease of childhood and youth.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--A slight fever, stiffness of the neck and lower jaw, swelling\r\nand soreness of the gland. It usually develops in four or five days and\r\nthen begins to disappear.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Apply to the swelling a hot poultice of cornmeal and bread\r\nand milk. A hop poultice is also excellent. Take a good dose of physic and\r\nrest carefully. A warm general bath, or mustard foot bath, is very good.\r\nAvoid exposure or cold drafts. If a bad cold is taken, serious results may\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n_MEASLES._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--It is an eruptive, contagious disease, preceded by cough and\r\nother catarrhal symptoms for about four or five days. The eruption comes\r\nrapidly in small red spots, which are slightly raised.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--A feeling of weakness, loss of appetite, some fever, cold in the\r\nhead, frequent sneezing, watery eyes, dry cough and a hot skin. The disease\r\ntakes effect nine or ten days after exposure. {335}\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Measles is not a dangerous disease in the child, but in an\r\nadult it is often very serious. In childhood very little medicine is\r\nnecessary, but exposure must be carefully avoided, and the patient kept in\r\nbed, in a moderately warm room. The diet should be light and nourishing.\r\nKeep the room dark. If the eruption does not come out promptly, apply hot\r\nbaths.\r\n\r\nCOMMON TREATMENT.--Two teaspoonfuls of spirits of nitre, one teaspoonful\r\nparegoric, one wineglassful of camphor water. Mix thoroughly, and give a\r\nteaspoonful in half a tea-cupful of water every two hours. To relieve the\r\ncough, if troublesome, flax seed tea, or infusion of slippery-elm bark,\r\nwith a little lemon juice to render more palatable, will be of benefit.\r\n\r\n_CHICKEN POX._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This is a contagious, eruptive disease, which resembles to\r\nsome extent small-pox. The pointed vesicles or pimples have a depression in\r\nthe center in chicken-pox, and in small pox they do not.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Nine to seventeen days elapse after the exposure, before\r\nsymptoms appear. Slight fever, a sense of sickness, the appearance of\r\nscattered pimples, some itching and heat. The pimples rapidly change into\r\nlittle blisters, filled with a watery fluid. After five or six days they\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Milk diet, and avoid all kinds of meat. Keep the bowels\r\nopen, and avoid all exposure to cold. Large vesicles on the face should be\r\npunctured early, and irritation by rubbing should be avoided.\r\n\r\n_HOME TREATMENT OF DIPHTHERIA._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Acute, specific, constitutional disease, with local\r\nmanifestations in the throat, mouth, nose, larynx, windpipe, and glands of\r\nthe neck. The disease is infectious, but not very contagious under the\r\nproper precautions. It is a disease of childhood, though adults sometimes\r\ncontract it. Many of the best physicians of the day consider true or\r\nmembranous croup to be due to this diphtheritic membranous disease thus\r\nlocated in the larynx or trachea. {336}\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Symptoms vary according to the severity of the attack. Chills,\r\nfever, headache, languor, loss of appetite, stiffness of neck, with\r\ntenderness about the angles of the jaw, soreness of the throat, pain in the\r\near, aching of the limbs, loss of strength, coated tongue, swelling of the\r\nneck, and offensive breath; lymphatic glands on side of neck enlarged and\r\ntender. The throat is first to be seen red and swollen, then covered with\r\ngrayish white patches, which spread, and a false membrane is found on the\r\nmucous membrane. If the nose is attacked, there will be an offensive\r\ndischarge, and the child will breathe through the mouth. If the larynx or\r\nthroat are involved, the voice will become hoarse, and a croupy cough, with\r\ndifficult breathing, shows that the air passage to the lungs is being\r\nobstructed by the false membrane.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Isolate the patient, to prevent the spread of the disease.\r\nDiet should be of the most nutritious character, as milk, eggs, broths, and\r\noysters. Give at intervals of every two or three hours. If patient refuses\r\nto swallow, from the pain caused by the effort, a nutrition injection must\r\nbe resorted to. Inhalations of steam and hot water, and allowing the\r\npatient to suck pellets of ice, will give relief. Sponges dipped in hot\r\nwater, and applied to the angles of the jaw, are beneficial. Inhalations of\r\nlime, made by slaking freshly burnt lime in a vessel, and directing the\r\nvapor to the child's mouth, by means of a newspaper, or similar\r\ncontrivance. Flour of sulphur, blown into the back of the mouth and throat\r\nby means of a goose quill, has been highly recommended. Frequent gargling\r\nof the throat and mouth, with a solution of lactic acid, strong enough to\r\ntaste sour, will help to keep the parts clean, and correct the foul breath.\r\nIf there is great prostration, with the nasal passage affected, or\r\nhoarseness and difficult breathing, a physician should be called at once.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{337}\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n_DISORDERS OF THE MENSES._\r\n\r\n1. SUPPRESSION OF, OR SCANTY MENSES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Attention to the diet, and exercise in the open air to\r\npromote the general health. Some bitter tonic, taken with fifteen grains of\r\ndialyzed iron, well diluted, after meals, if patient is pale and\r\ndebilitated. A hot foot bath is often all that is necessary.\r\n\r\n2. PROFUSE MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Avoid highly seasoned food, and the use of spirituous\r\nliquors; also excessive fatigue, either physical or mental. To check the\r\nflow, patient should be kept quiet, and allowed to sip cinnamon tea during\r\nthe period.\r\n\r\n3. PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Often brought on by colds. Treat by warm hip baths, hot\r\ndrinks (avoiding spirituous liquors), and heat applied to the back and\r\nextremities. A teaspoonful of the fluid extract of viburnum will sometimes\r\nact like a charm.\r\n\r\n_HOW TO CURE SWELLED AND SORE BREASTS._\r\n\r\nTake and boil a quantity of chamomile, and apply the hot fomentations. This\r\ndissolves the knot, and reduce the swelling and soreness. {338}\r\n\r\n_LEUCORRHEA OR WHITES._\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--This disorder, if not arising from some abnormal condition\r\nof the pelvic organs, can easily be cured by patient taking the proper\r\namount of exercise and good nutritious food, avoiding tea and coffee. An\r\ninjection every evening of one teaspoonful of Pond's Extract in a cup of\r\nhot water, after first cleansing the vagina well with a quart of warm\r\nwater, is a simple but effective remedy.\r\n\r\n_INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB._\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--When in the acute form this disease is ushered in by a\r\nchill, followed by fever, and pain in the region of the womb. Patient\r\nshould be placed in bed, and a brisk purgative given, hot poultices applied\r\nto the abdomen, and the feet and hands kept warm. If the symptoms do not\r\nsubside, a physician should be consulted.\r\n\r\n_HYSTERIA._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--A functional disorder of the nervous system of which it is\r\nimpossible to speak definitely; characterized by disturbance of the reason,\r\nwill, imagination, and emotions, with sometimes convulsive attacks that\r\nresemble epilepsy.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Fits of laughter, and tears without apparent cause; emotions\r\neasily excited; mind often melancholy and depressed; tenderness along the\r\nspine; disturbances of digestion, with hysterical convulsions, and other\r\nnervous phenomena.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Some healthy and pleasant employment should be urged upon\r\nwomen afflicted with this disease. Men are also subject to it, though not\r\nso frequently. Avoid excessive fatigue and mental worry; also stimulants\r\nand opiates. Plenty of good food and fresh air will do more good than\r\ndrugs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{339}\r\n\r\nFalling of the Womb.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--The displacement of the womb usually is the result of too much\r\nchildbearing, miscarriages, abortions, or the taking of strong medicines to\r\nbring about menstruation. It may also be the result in getting up too\r\nquickly from the childbed. There are, however, other causes, such as a\r\ngeneral breaking down of the health.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--If the womb has fallen forward it presses against the bladder,\r\ncausing the patient to urinate frequently. If the womb has fallen back, it\r\npresses against the rectum, and constipation is the result with often\r\nsevere pain at stool. If the womb descends into the vagina there is a\r\nfeeling of heaviness. All forms of displacement produce pain in the back,\r\nwith an irregular and scanty menstrual flow and a dull and exhausted\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Improve the general health. Take some preparation of\r\ncod-liver oil, hot injections (of a teaspoonful of powdered alum with a\r\npint of water), a daily sitz-bath, and a regular morning bath three times a\r\nweek will be found very beneficial. There, however, can be no remedy unless\r\nthe womb is first replaced to the proper position. This must be done by a\r\ncompetent physician who should frequently be consulted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{340}\r\n\r\nMenstruation.\r\n\r\n1. ITS IMPORTANCE.--Menstruation plays a momentous part in the female\r\neconomy; indeed, unless it be in every way properly and duly performed, it\r\nis neither possible that a lady can be well, nor is it at all probable that\r\nshe will conceive. The large number of barren, of delicate, and of\r\nhysterical women there are in America arises mainly from menstruation not\r\nbeing duly and properly performed.\r\n\r\n2. THE BOUNDARY-LINE.--Menstruation--\"the periods\"--the appearance of the\r\ncatamenia or the menses--is then one of the most important epochs in a\r\ngirl's life. It is the boundary-line, the landmark between childhood and\r\nwomanhood; it is the threshold, so to speak, of a woman's life. Her body\r\nnow develops and expands, and her mental capacity enlarges and improves.\r\n\r\n3. THE COMMENCEMENT OF MENSTRUATION.--A good beginning at this time is\r\npeculiarly necessary, or a girl's health is sure to suffer, and different\r\norgans of the body--her lungs, for instance, may become imperiled. A\r\nhealthy continuation, at regular periods, is also much needed, or\r\nconception, when she is married, may not occur. Great attention and\r\nskillful management is required to ward off many formidable diseases, which\r\nat the close of menstruation--at \"the change of life\"--are more likely than\r\nat any time to be developed. If she marry when very young, marriage weakens\r\nher system, and prevents a full development of her body. Moreover, such an\r\none is, during the progress of her labor, prone to convulsions--which is a\r\nvery serious childbed complication.\r\n\r\n4. EARLY MARRIAGES.--Statistics prove that twenty per cent--20 in every\r\n100--of females who marry are under age, and that such early marriages are\r\noften followed by serious, and sometimes even by fatal consequences to\r\nmother, to progeny, or to both. Parents ought, therefore, to persuade their\r\ndaughters not to marry until they are of age--twenty-one; they should point\r\nout to them the risk and danger likely to ensue if their advice be not\r\nfollowed; they should impress upon their minds the old adage:\r\n\r\n \"Early wed,\r\n  Early dead.\"\r\n\r\n5. TIME TO MARRY.--Parents who have the real interest and happiness of\r\ntheir daughters at heart, ought, in consonance with the laws of physiology,\r\nto discountenance marriage before twenty; and the nearer the girls arrive\r\nat {341} the age of twenty-five before the consummation of this important\r\nrite, the greater the probability that, physically and morally, they will\r\nbe protected against those risks which precocious marriages bring in their\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n6. FEEBLE PARENTS.--Feeble parents have generally feeble children; diseased\r\nparents, diseased children; nervous parents, nervous children;--\"like\r\nbegets like.\" It is sad to reflect, that the innocent have to suffer, not\r\nonly for the guilty, but for the thoughtless and inconsiderate. Disease and\r\ndebility are thus propagated from one generation to another and the\r\nAmerican race becomes woefully deteriorated.\r\n\r\n7. TIME.--Menstruation in this country usually commences at the ages of\r\nfrom thirteen to sixteen, sometimes earlier; occasionally as early as\r\neleven or twelve; at other times later, and not until a girl be seventeen\r\nor eighteen years of age. Menstruation in large towns is supposed to\r\ncommence at an earlier period than in the country, and earlier in luxurious\r\nthan in simple life.\r\n\r\n8. CHARACTER.--The menstrual fluid is not exactly blood, although, both in\r\nappearance and properties, it much resembles it; yet it never in the\r\nhealthy state clots as blood does. It is a secretion of the womb, and, when\r\nhealthy, ought to be of a bright red color, in appearance very much like\r\nthe blood from a recently cut finger. The menstrual fluid ought not, as\r\nbefore observed, clot. If it does, a lady, during \"her periods,\" suffers\r\nintense pain; moreover, she seldom conceives until the clotting has ceased.\r\n\r\n9. MENSTRUATION DURING NURSING.--Some ladies, though comparatively few,\r\nmenstruate during nursing; when they do, it may be considered not as the\r\nrule, but as the exception. It is said in such instances, that they are\r\nmore likely to conceive; and no doubt they are, as menstruation is an\r\nindication of a proneness to conception. Many persons have an idea that\r\nwhen a woman, during lactation, menstruates, her milk is both sweeter and\r\npurer. Such is an error. Menstruation during nursing is more likely to\r\nweaken the mother, and consequently to deteriorate her milk, and thus make\r\nit less sweet and less pure.\r\n\r\n10. VIOLENT EXERCISE.--During \"the monthly periods\" violent exercise is\r\ninjurious; iced drinks and acid beverages are improper; and bathing in the\r\nsea, and bathing the feet in cold water, and cold baths are dangerous;\r\nindeed, at such times as these, no risks should be run, and no experiments\r\nshould, for the moment, be permitted, otherwise serious consequences will,\r\nin all probability, ensue. {342}\r\n\r\n11. THE PALE, COLORLESS-COMPLEXIONED.--The pale, colorless-complexioned,\r\nhelpless, listless, and almost lifeless young ladies who are so constantly\r\nseen in society, usually owe their miserable state of health to absent, to\r\ndeficient, or to profuse menstruation. Their breathing is short--they are\r\nsoon \"out of breath,\" if they attempt to take exercise--to walk, for\r\ninstance, either up stairs or up a hill, or even for half a mile on level\r\nground, their breath is nearly exhausted--they pant as though they had been\r\nrunning quickly. They are ready, after the slightest exertion or fatigue,\r\nand after the least worry or excitement, to feel faint, and sometimes even\r\nto actually swoon away. Now such cases may, if judiciously treated, be\r\ngenerally soon cured. It therefore behooves mothers to seek medical aid\r\nearly for their girls, and that before irreparable mischief has been done\r\nto the constitution.\r\n\r\n12. POVERTY OF BLOOD.--In a pale, delicate girl or wife, who is laboring\r\nunder what is popularly called poverty of blood, the menstrual fluid is\r\nsometimes very scant, at others very copious, but is, in either case,\r\nusually very pale--almost as colorless as water, the patient being very\r\nnervous and even hysterical. Now, these are signs of great debility; but,\r\nfortunately for such an one, a medical man is, in the majority of cases, in\r\npossession of remedies that will soon make her all right again.\r\n\r\n13. NO RIGHT TO MARRY.--A delicate girl has no right until she be made\r\nstrong, to marry. If she should marry, she will frequently, when in labor,\r\nnot have strength, unless she has help, to bring a child into the world;\r\nwhich, provided she be healthy and well-formed, ought not to be. How\r\ngraphically the Bible tells of delicate women not having strength to bring\r\nchildren into the world: \"For the children are come to the birth, and there\r\nis not strength to bring forth.\"--2 Kings XIX, 3.\r\n\r\n14. TOO SPARING.--Menstruation at another time is too sparing; this is a\r\nfrequent cause of sterility. Medical aid, in the majority of cases, will be\r\nable to remedy the defect, and, by doing so, will probably be the means of\r\nbringing the womb into a healthy state, and thus predispose to conception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{343}\r\n\r\nCelebrated Prescriptions for All Diseases and How to Use Them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVINEGAR FOR HIVES.\r\n\r\nAfter trying many remedies in a severe case of hives, Mr. Swain found\r\nvinegar lotion gave instant relief, and subsequent trials in other cases\r\nhave been equally successful. One part of water to two parts of vinegar is\r\nthe strength most suitable.\r\n\r\nTHROAT TROUBLE.\r\n\r\nA teaspoonful of salt, in a cup of hot water, makes a safe and excellent\r\ngargle in most throat troubles.\r\n\r\nFOR SWEATING FEET, WITH BAD ODOR.\r\n\r\nWash the feet in warm water with borax, and if this don't cure, use a\r\nsolution of permanganate to destroy the fetor; about five grains to each\r\nounce of water. {344}\r\n\r\nAMENORRHOEA.\r\n\r\nThe following is recommended as a reliable emmenagogue in many cases of\r\nfunctional amenorrhoea:\r\n\r\n  Bichloride of mercury,\r\n  Arsenite of sodium, aa gr. iij.\r\n  Sulphate of strychnine, gr. iss.\r\n  Carbonate of potassium,\r\n  Sulphate of iron, aa gr. xlv.\r\n\r\nMix and divide into sixty pills.

At night use cold cream, and wear gloves.\r\n\r\nBLEEDING.\r\n\r\nVery hot water is a prompt checker of bleeding, besides, if it is clean, as\r\nit should be, it aids in sterilizing our wound.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR CRAMP.\r\n\r\nWherever friction can be conveniently applied, heat will be generated by\r\nit, and the muscle again reduced to a natural condition; but if the pains\r\nproceed from the contraction of some muscle located internally, burnt\r\nbrandy is an excellent remedy.\r\n\r\nA severe attack which will not yield to this simple treatment may be\r\nconquered by administering a small dose of laudanum or ether, best given\r\nunder medical supervision.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR COLIC.\r\n\r\nCastor oil, given as soon as the symptoms of colic manifest themselves, has\r\nfrequently afforded relief. At any rate, the irritating substances may be\r\nexpelled from the alimentary canal before the pains will subside. All local\r\nremedies will be ineffectual, and consequently the purgative should be\r\ngiven in large doses until a copious vacuation is produced. {346}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOCTOR'S VISIT.]\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR HEARTBURN.\r\n\r\nIf soda, taken in small quantities after meals, does not relieve the\r\ndistress, one may rest assured that the fluid is an alkali and requires an\r\nacid treatment. Proceed, after eating, to squeeze ten drops of lemon-juice\r\ninto a small quantity of water, and swallow it. The habit of daily life\r\nshould be made to conform to the laws of health, or local treatment will\r\nprove futile.\r\n\r\nBILIOUSNESS.\r\n\r\nFor biliousness, squeeze the juice of a lime or small lemon into half a\r\nglass of cold water, then stir in a little baking soda and drink while it\r\nfoams. This receipt will also relieve sick headache if taken at the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nTURPENTINE APPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nMix turpentine and lard in equal parts. Warmed and rubbed on the chest, it\r\nis a safe, reliable and mild counter irritant and revulsent in minor lung\r\ncomplications. {347}\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR MUMPS.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the face and neck be kept warm. Avoid catching\r\ncold, and regulate the stomach and bowels, because, when aggravated, this\r\ndisease is communicated to other glands, and assumes there a serious form.\r\nRest and quiet, with a good condition of the general health, will throw off\r\nthis disease without further inconvenience.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR FELON.\r\n\r\nAll medication, such as poulticing, anointing, and the applications of\r\nlotions, is but useless waste of time. The surgeon's knife should be used\r\nas early as possible, for it will be required sooner or later, and the more\r\npromptly it can be applied, the less danger is there from the disease, and\r\nthe more agony is spared to the unfortunate victim.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR STABS.\r\n\r\nA wound made by thrusting a dagger or other oblong instrument into the\r\nflesh, is best treated, if no artery has been severed, by applying lint\r\nscraped from a linen cloth, which serves as an obstruction, allowing and\r\nassisting coagulation. Meanwhile cold water should be applied to the parts\r\nadjoining the wound.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR MASHED NAILS.\r\n\r\nIf the injured member be plunged into very hot water, the nail will become\r\npliable and adapt itself to the new condition of things, thus alleviating\r\nagony to some extent. A small hole may be bored on the nail with a pointed\r\ninstrument, so adroitly so as not to cause pain, yet so successfully as to\r\nrelieve pressure on the sensitive tissues. Free applications of arnica or\r\niodine will have an excellent effect.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR FOREIGN BODY IN THE EYE.\r\n\r\nWhen any foreign body enters the eye, close it instantly, and keep it still\r\nuntil you have an opportunity to ask the assistance of some one; then have\r\nthe upper lid folded over a pencil and the exposed surfaces closely\r\nsearched; if the body be invisible, catch the everted lid by the lashes,\r\nand drawing it down over the lower lid, suddenly release it, and it will\r\nresume its natural position. Unsuccessful in this attempt, you may be\r\npretty well assured that the object has become lodged in the tissues, and\r\nwill require the assistance of a skilled operator to remove it.\r\n\r\nCUTS.\r\n\r\nA drop or two of creosote on a cut will stop its bleeding. {348}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR POISON OAK--POISON IVY--POISON SUMACH.--Mr. Charles Morris,\r\nof Philadelphia, who has studied the subject closely, uses, as a sovereign\r\nremedy, frequent bathing of the affected parts in water as hot as can be\r\nborne. If used immediately after exposure, it may prevent the eruption\r\nappearing. If later, it allays the itching, and gradually dries up the\r\nswellings, though, they are very stubborn after they have once appeared.\r\nBut an application every few hours keeps down the intolerable itching,\r\nwhich is the most annoying feature of sumach poisoning. In addition to\r\nthis, the ordinary astringent ointments are useful, as is also that\r\nsovereign lotion, \"lead-water and laudanum.\" Mr. Morris adds to these a\r\npreventive prescription of \"wide-open eyes.\"\r\n\r\nBITES AND STINGS OF INSECTS.--Wash with a solution of ammonia water.\r\n\r\nBITES OF MAD DOGS.--Apply caustic potash at once to the wound, and give\r\nenough whiskey to cause sleep.\r\n\r\nBURNS.--Make a paste of common baking soda and water, and apply it promptly\r\nto the burn. It will quickly check the pain and inflammation.\r\n\r\nCOLD ON CHEST.--A flannel rag wrung out in boiling water and sprinkled with\r\nturpentine, laid on the chest, gives the greatest relief.\r\n\r\nCOUGH.--Boil one ounce of flaxseed in a pint of water, strain, and add a\r\nlittle honey, one ounce of rock candy, and the juice of three lemons. Mix\r\nand boil well. Drink as hot as possible.\r\n\r\nSPRAINED ANKLE OR WRIST.--Wash the ankle very frequently with cold salt and\r\nwater, which is far better than warm vinegar or decoction of herbs. Keep\r\nthe foot as cool as possible to prevent inflammation, and sit with it\r\nelevated on a high cushion. Live on low diet, and take every morning some\r\ncooling medicine, such as Epsom salts. It cures in a few days.\r\n\r\nCHILBLAINS, SPRAINS, ETC.--One raw egg well beaten, half a pint of vinegar,\r\none ounce spirits of turpentine, a quarter of an ounce of spirits of wine,\r\na quarter of an ounce of camphor. These ingredients to be beaten together,\r\nthen put in a bottle and shaken for ten minutes, after which, to be corked\r\ndown tightly to exclude the air. In half an hour it is fit for use. To be\r\nwell rubbed in, two, three, or four times a day. For rheumatism in the\r\nhead, to be rubbed at the back of the neck and behind the ears. In\r\nchilblains this remedy is to be used before they are broken. {349}\r\n\r\nHOW TO REMOVE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.--Sulphuret of Arsenic, one ounce;\r\nQuicklime, one ounce; Prepared Lard, one ounce; White Wax, one ounce. Melt\r\nthe Wax, add the Lard. When nearly cold, stir in the other ingredients.\r\nApply to the superfluous hair, allowing it to remain on from five to ten\r\nminutes; use a table-knife to shave off the hair; then wash with soap and\r\nwarm water.\r\n\r\nDYSPEPSIA CURE.--Powdered Rhubarb, two drachms; Bicarbonate of Sodium, six\r\ndrachms; Fluid Extract of Gentian, three drachms; Peppermint Water, seven\r\nand a half ounces. Mix them. Dose, a teaspoonful half an hour before meals.\r\n\r\nFOR NEURALGIA.--Tincture of Belladonna, one ounce; Tincture of Camphor, one\r\nounce; Tincture of Arnica, one ounce; Tincture of Opium, one ounce. Mix\r\nthem. Apply over the seat of the pain, and give ten to twenty drops in\r\nsweetened water every two hours.\r\n\r\nFOR COUGHS, COLDS, ETC.--Syrup of Morphia, three ounces; Syrup of Tar,\r\nthree and a half ounces; Chloroform, one troy ounce; Glycerine, one troy\r\nounce. Mix them. Dose, a teaspoonful three or four times a day.\r\n\r\nTO CURE HIVES.--Compound syrup of Squill, U. S., three ounces; Syrup of\r\nIpecac, U. S., one ounce. Mix them. Dose, a teaspoonful.\r\n\r\nTO CURE SICK HEADACHE.--Gather sumach leaves in the summer, and spread them\r\nin the sun a few days to dry. Then powder them fine, and smoke, morning and\r\nevening for two weeks, also whenever there are symptoms of approaching\r\nheadache. Use a new clay pipe. If these directions are adhered to, this\r\nmedicine will surely effect a permanent cure.\r\n\r\nWHOOPING COUGH.--Dissolve a scruple of salt of tartar in a gill of water;\r\nadd to it ten grains of cochineal; sweeten it with sugar. Give to an infant\r\na quarter teaspoonful four times a day; two years old, one-half\r\nteaspoonful; from four years, a tablespoonful. Great care is required in\r\nthe administration of medicines to infants. We can assure paternal\r\ninquirers that the foregoing may be depended upon.\r\n\r\nCUT OR BRUISE.--Apply the moist surface of the inside coating or skin of\r\nthe shell of a raw egg. It will adhere of itself, leave no scar, and heal\r\nwithout pain.\r\n\r\nDISINFECTANT.--Chloride of lime should be scattered at least once a week\r\nunder sinks and wherever sewer gas is likely to penetrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YOUNG DOCTOR.]\r\n\r\n{362}\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS.--Common charcoal is highly recommended for costiveness. It may\r\nbe taken in tea- or tablespoonful, or even larger doses, according to the\r\nexigencies of the case, mixed with molasses, repeating it as often as\r\nnecessary. Bathe the bowels with pepper and vinegar. Or take two ounces of\r\nrhubarb, add one ounce of rust of iron, infuse in one quart of wine. Half a\r\nwineglassful every morning. Or take pulverized blood root, one drachm,\r\npulverized rhubarb, one drachm, castile soap, two scruples. Mix. and roll\r\ninto thirty-two pills. Take one, morning and night. By following these\r\ndirections it may perhaps save you from a severe attack of the piles, or\r\nsome other kindred disease.\r\n\r\nTO CURE DEAFNESS.--Obtain pure pickerel oil, and apply four drops morning\r\nand evening to the ear. Great care should be taken to obtain oil that is\r\nperfectly pure.\r\n\r\nDEAFNESS.--Take three drops of sheep's gall, warm, and drop it into the ear\r\non going to bed. The ear must be syringed with warm soap and water in the\r\nmorning. The gall must be applied for three successive nights. It is only\r\nefficacious when the deafness is produced by cold. The most convenient way\r\nof warming the gall is by holding it in a silver spoon over the flame of a\r\nlight. The above remedy has been frequently tried with perfect success.\r\n\r\nGOUT.--This is Col. Birch's recipe for rheumatic gout or acute rheumatism,\r\ncommonly called in England the \"Chelsea Pensioner.\" Half an ounce of nitre\r\n(saltpetre), half an ounce of sulphur, half an ounce of flour of mustard,\r\nhalf an ounce of Turkey rhubarb, quarter of an ounce of powdered guaicum.\r\nMix, and take a teaspoonful every other night for three nights, and omit\r\nthree nights, in a wine-glassful of cold water which has been previously\r\nwell boiled.\r\n\r\nRINGWORM.--The head is to be washed twice a day with soft soap and warm\r\nsoft water; when dried the places to be rubbed with a piece of linen rag\r\ndipped in ammonia from gas tar; the patient should take a little sulphur\r\nand molasses, or some other genuine aperient, every morning; brushes and\r\ncombs should be washed every day, and the ammonia kept tightly corked.\r\n\r\nPILES.--Hamamelis, both internally or as an injection in rectum. Bathe the\r\nparts with cold water or with astringent lotions, as alum water, especially\r\nin bleeding piles. Ointment of gallic acid and calomel is of repute. The\r\nbest treatment of all is, suppositories of iodoform, ergotine, or tannic\r\nacid, which can be made at any drug store. {363}\r\n\r\nCHICKEN POX.--No medicine is usually needed, except a tea made from\r\npleurisy root, to make the child sweat. Milk diet is the best; avoidance of\r\nanimal food; careful attention to the bowels; keep cool and avoid exposure\r\nto cold.\r\n\r\nSCARLET FEVER.--Cold water compress on the throat. Fats and oils rubbed on\r\nhands and feet. The temperature of the room should be about 68 degrees\r\nFahr., and all draughts avoided. Mustard baths for retrocession of the rash\r\nand to bring it out. Diet: ripe fruit, toast, gruel, beef tea and milk.\r\nStimulants are useful to counteract depression of the vital forces.\r\n\r\nFALSE MEASLES OR ROSE RASH.--It requires no treatment except hygienic. Keep\r\nthe bowels open. Nourishing diet, and if there is itching, moisten the skin\r\nwith five per cent. solution of aconite or solution of starch and water.\r\n\r\nBILIOUS ATTACKS.--Drop doses of muriatic acid in a wine glass of water\r\nevery four hours, or the following prescription. Bicarbonate of soda, one\r\ndrachm; Aromatic spirits of ammonia, two drachms; Peppermint water, four\r\nounces. Dose: Take a teaspoonful every four hours.\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA.--The following prescription is generally all that will be\r\nnecessary: acetate of lead, eight grains; gum arabic, two drachms; acetate\r\nof morphia, one grain; and cinnamon water, eight ounces. Take a teaspoonful\r\nevery three hours.\r\n\r\nBe careful not to eat too much food. Some consider, the best treatment is\r\nto fast, and it is a good suggestion. Patients should keep quiet and have\r\nthe room of a warm and even temperature.\r\n\r\nVOMITING.--Ice dissolved in the mouth, often cures vomiting when all\r\nremedies fail. Much depends on the diet of persons liable to such attacks;\r\nthis should be easily digestible food, taken often and in small quantities.\r\nVomiting can often be arrested by applying a mustard paste over the region\r\nof the stomach. It is not necessary to allow it to remain until the parts\r\nare blistered, but it may be removed when the part becomes thoroughly red,\r\nand reapplied if required after the redness has disappeared. One of the\r\nsecrets to relieve vomiting is to give the stomach perfect rest, not\r\nallowing the patient even a glass of water, as long as the tendency remains\r\nto throw it up again.\r\n\r\nNERVOUS HEADACHE.--Extract hyoscymus five grains, pulverized camphor five\r\ngrains. Mix. Make four pills, one to be taken when the pain is most severe\r\nin nervous headache. Or three drops tincture nux vomica in a spoonful of\r\nwater, two or three times a day. {364}\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE NOSE,--from whatever cause--may generally be stopped by\r\nputting a plug of lint into the nostril; if this does not do, apply a cold\r\nlotion to the forehead; raise the head and place both arms over the head,\r\nso that it will rest on both hands; dip the lint plug, slightly moistened,\r\nin some powdered gum arabic, and plug the nostrils again; or dip the plug\r\ninto equal parts of gum arabic and alum. An easier and simpler method is to\r\nplace a piece of writing paper on the gums of the upper jaw, under the\r\nupper lip, and let it remain there for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nBOILS.--These should be brought to a head by warm poultices of camomile\r\nflowers, or boiled white lily root, or onion root, by fermentation with hot\r\nwater, or by stimulating plasters. When ripe they should be destroyed by a\r\nneedle or lancet. But this should not be attempted until they are\r\nthoroughly proved.\r\n\r\nBUNIONS may be checked in their early development by binding the joint with\r\nadhesive plaster, and keeping it on as long as any uneasiness is felt. The\r\nbandaging should be perfect, and it might be well to extend it round the\r\nfoot. An inflamed bunion should be poulticed, and larger shoes be worn.\r\nIodine 12 grains, lard or spermaceti ointment half an ounce, makes a\r\ncapital ointment for bunions. It should be rubbed on gently twice or three\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\nFELONS.--One table-spoonful of red lead, and one table-spoonful of castile\r\nsoap, and mix them with as much weak lye as will make it soft enough to\r\nspread like a salve, and apply it on the first appearance of the felon, and\r\nit will cure in ten or twelve days.\r\n\r\nCURE FOR WARTS.--The easiest way to get rid of warts, is to pare off the\r\nthickened skin which covers the prominent wart; cut it off by successive\r\nlayers and shave it until you come to the surface of the skin, and till you\r\ndraw blood in two or three places. Then rub the part thoroughly over with\r\nlunar caustic, and one effective operation of this kind will generally\r\ndestroy the wart; if not, you cut off the black spot which has been\r\noccasioned by the caustic, and apply it again; or you may apply acetic\r\nacid, and thus you will get rid of it. Care must be taken in applying these\r\nacids, not to rub them on the skin around the wart.\r\n\r\nWENS.--Take the yoke of some eggs, beat up, and add as much fine salt as\r\nwill dissolve, and apply a plaster to the wen every ten hours. It cures\r\nwithout pain or any other inconvenience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{365}\r\n\r\nHOW TO CURE\r\n\r\nApoplexy, Bad Breath and Quinsy.\r\n\r\n1. APOPLEXY.--Apoplexy occurs only in the corpulent or obese, and those of\r\ngross or high living.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Raise the head to a nearly upright position; loosen all tight\r\nclothes, strings, etc., and apply cold water to the head and warm water and\r\nwarm cloths to the feet. Have the apartment cool and well ventilated. Give\r\nnothing by the mouth until the breathing is relieved, and then only\r\ndraughts of cold water.\r\n\r\n2. BAD BREATH.--Bad or foul breath will be removed by taking a teaspoonful\r\nof the following mixture after each meal: One ounce chloride of soda, one\r\nounce liquor of potassa, one and one-half ounces phosphate of soda, and\r\nthree ounces of water.\r\n\r\n3. QUINSY.--This is an inflammation of the tonsils, or common inflammatory\r\nsore throat; commences with a slight feverish attack, with considerable\r\npain and swelling of the tonsils, causing some difficulty in swallowing; as\r\nthe attack advances, these symptoms become more intense, there is headache,\r\nthirst, a painful sense of tension, and acute darting pains in the ears.\r\nThe attack is generally brought on by exposure to cold, and lasts from five\r\nto seven days, when it subsides naturally, or an abscess may form in\r\ntonsils and burst, or the tonsils may remain enlarged, the inflammation\r\nsubsiding.\r\n\r\n_Home Treatment._--The patient should remain in a warm room, the diet\r\nchiefly milk and good broths, some cooling laxative and diaphoretic\r\nmedicine may be given; but the greatest relief will be found in the\r\nfrequent inhalation of the steam of hot water through an inhaler, or in the\r\nold-fashioned way through the spout of a teapot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{366}\r\n\r\nSensible Rules for the Nurse.\r\n\r\n\"Remember to be extremely neat in dress; a few drops of hartshorn in the\r\nwater used for _daily_ bathing will remove the disagreeable odors of warmth\r\nand perspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Never speak of the symptoms of your patient in his presence, unless\r\nquestioned by the doctor, whose orders you are always to obey _implicitly_.\r\n\r\n\"Remember never to be a gossip or tattler, and always to hold sacred the\r\nknowledge which, to a certain extent, you must obtain of the private\r\naffairs of your patient and the household in which you nurse.\r\n\r\n\"Never contradict your patient, nor argue with him, nor let him see that\r\nyou are annoyed about anything.\r\n\r\n\"Never _whisper_ in the sick room. If your patient be well enough, and\r\nwishes you to talk to him, speak in a low, distinct voice, on cheerful\r\nsubjects. Don't relate painful hospital experiences, nor give details of\r\nthe maladies of former patients, and remember never to startle him with\r\naccounts of dreadful crimes or accidents that you have read in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n\"_Write_ down the orders that the physician gives you as to time for giving\r\nthe medicines, food, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the room bright (unless the doctor orders it darkened).\r\n\r\n\"Let the air of the room be as pure as possible, and keep everything in\r\norder, but without being fussy and bustling.\r\n\r\n\"The only way to remove dust in a sick room is to wipe everything with a\r\ndamp cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Remember to carry out all vessels covered. Empty and wash them\r\nimmediately, and keep some disinfectant in them.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that to leave the patient's untasted food by his side, from meal\r\nto meal, in hopes that he will eat it in the interval, is simply to prevent\r\nhim from taking any food at all.\r\n\r\n\"Medicines, beef tea or stimulants, should never be kept where the patient\r\ncan see them or smell them.\r\n\r\n\"Light-colored clothing should be worn by those who have the care of the\r\nsick, in preference to dark-colored apparel; particularly if the disease is\r\nof a contagious nature. Experiments have shown that black and other dark\r\ncolors will absorb more readily the subtle effluvia that emanates from sick\r\npersons than white or light colors.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{367}\r\n\r\nLongevity.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits very recent mortality statistics, showing the\r\naverage duration of life among persons of various classes:\r\n\r\n                  _Employment_       _Years_.\r\n\r\n  Judges                                65\r\n  Farmers                               64\r\n  Bank Officers                         64\r\n  Coopers                               58\r\n  Public Officers                       57\r\n  Clergymen                             56\r\n  Shipwrights                           55\r\n  Hatters                               54\r\n  Lawyers                               54\r\n  Rope Makers                           54\r\n  Blacksmiths                           51\r\n  Merchants                             51\r\n  Calico Printers                       51\r\n  Physicians                            51\r\n  Butchers                              50\r\n  Carpenters                            49\r\n  Masons                                48\r\n  Traders                               46\r\n  Tailors                               44\r\n  Jewelers                              44\r\n  Manufacturers                         43\r\n  Bakers                                43\r\n  Painters                              43\r\n  Shoemakers                            43\r\n  Mechanics                             43\r\n  Editors                               40\r\n  Musicians                             39\r\n  Printers                              38\r\n  Machinists                            36\r\n  Teachers                              34\r\n  Clerks                                34\r\n  Operatives                            32\r\n\r\n\"It will be easily seen, by these figures, how a quiet or tranquil life\r\naffects longevity.

HOT WATER BAG.]\r\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY AND USE HOT WATER IN ALL DISEASES.\r\n\r\n1. THE HOT WATER THROAT BAG. The hot water throat bag is made from fine\r\nwhite rubber fastened to the head by a rubber band (see illustration), and\r\nis an unfailing remedy for catarrh, hay fever, cold, toothache, headache,\r\nearache, neuralgia, etc.\r\n\r\n2. THE HOT WATER BOTTLE. No well regulated house should be without a hot\r\nwater bottle. It is excellent in the application of hot water for\r\ninflammations, colic, headache, congestion, cold feet, rheumatism, sprains,\r\netc., etc. It is an excellent warming pan and an excellent feet and hand\r\nwarmer when riding. These hot water bags in any variety can be purchased at\r\nany drug store.\r\n\r\n3. Boiling water may be used in the bags and the heat will be retained many\r\nhours. They are soft and pliable and pleasant to the touch, and can be\r\nadjusted to any part of the body.\r\n\r\n4. Hot water is good for constipation, torpid liver, and relieves colic and\r\nflatulence, and is of special value.\r\n\r\n5. _Caution_. When hot water bags or any hot fomentation {369} is removed,\r\nreplace dry flannel and bathe parts in tepid water and rub till dry.\r\n\r\n6. By inflammations it is best to use hot water and then cold water. It\r\nseems to give more immediate relief. Hot water is a much better remedy than\r\ndrugs, paragoric, Dover's powder or morphine. Always avoid the use of\r\nstrong poisonous drugs when possible.\r\n\r\n7. Those who suffer from cold feet there is no better remedy than to bathe\r\nthe feet in cold water before retiring and then place a hot water bottle in\r\nthe bed at the feet. A few weeks of such treatment results in relief if not\r\ncure of the most obstinate case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE COLD WATER.\r\n\r\nUse a compress of cold water for acute or chronic inflammation, such as\r\nsore throat, bronchitis, croup, inflammation of the lungs, etc. If there is\r\na hot and aching pain in the back apply a compress of cold water on the\r\nsame, or it may simply be placed across the back or around the body. The\r\nmost depends upon the condition of the patient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{370}\r\n\r\nPractical Rules for Bathing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. Bathe at least once a week all over, thoroughly. No one can preserve his\r\nhealth by neglecting personal cleanliness. Remember, \"Cleanliness is akin\r\nto Godliness.\"\r\n\r\n2. Only mild soap should be used in bathing the body.\r\n\r\n3. Wipe quickly and dry the body thoroughly with a moderately coarse towel.\r\nRub the skin vigorously. {371}\r\n\r\n4. Many people have contracted severe and fatal diseases by neglecting to\r\ntake proper care of the body after bathing.\r\n\r\n5. If you get up a good reaction by thorough rubbing in a mild temperature,\r\nthe effect is always good.\r\n\r\n6. Never go into a cold room, or allow cold air to enter the room until you\r\nare dressed.\r\n\r\n7. Bathing in cold rooms and in cold water is positively injurious, unless\r\nthe person possesses a very strong and vigorous constitution, and then\r\nthere is great danger of laying the foundation of some serious disease.\r\n\r\n8. Never bathe within two hours after eating. It injures digestion.\r\n\r\n9. Never bathe when the body or mind is much exhausted. It is liable to\r\ncheck the healthful circulation.\r\n\r\n10. A good time for bathing is just before retiring. The morning hour is a\r\ngood time also, if a warm room and warm water can be secured.\r\n\r\n11. Never bathe a fresh wound or broken skin with cold water; the wound\r\nabsorbs water, and causes swelling and irritation.\r\n\r\n12. A person not robust should be very careful in bathing; great care\r\nshould be exercised to avoid any chilling effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{372}\r\n\r\nAll the Different Kinds of Baths, and How to Prepare Them.\r\n\r\nTHE SULPHUR BATH.\r\n\r\nFor the itch, ringworm, itching, and for other slight skin irritations,\r\nbathe in water containing a little sulphur.\r\n\r\nTHE SALT BATH.\r\n\r\nTo open the pores of the skin, put a little common salt into the water.\r\nBorax, baking soda or lime used in the same way are excellent for cooling\r\nand cleansing the skin. A very small quantity in a bowl of water is\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nTHE VAPOR BATH.\r\n\r\n1. For catarrh, bronchitis, pleurisy, inflammation of the lungs,\r\nrheumatism, fever, affections of the bowels and kidneys, and skin diseases,\r\nthe vapor-bath is an excellent remedy.\r\n\r\n2. APPARATUS.--Use a small alcohol lamp, and place over it a small dish\r\ncontaining water. Light the lamp and allow the water to boil. Place a\r\ncane-bottom chair over the lamp, and seat the patient on it. Wrap blankets\r\nor quilts around the chair and around the patient, closing it tightly about\r\nthe neck. After free perspiration is produced the patient should be wrapped\r\nin warm blankets, and placed in bed, so as to continue the perspiration for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\n3. A convenient alcohol lamp may be made by taking a tin box, placing a\r\ntube in it, and putting in a common lamp wick. Any tinner can make one in a\r\nfew minutes, at a trifling cost.\r\n\r\nTHE HOT-AIR BATH.\r\n\r\n1. Place the alcohol lamp under the chair, without the dish of water. Then\r\nplace the patient on the chair, as in the vapor bath, and let him remain\r\nuntil a gentle and free perspiration is produced. This bath may be taken\r\nfrom time to time, as may be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n2. While remaining in the hot-air bath the patient may drink freely of cold\r\nor tepid water.\r\n\r\n3. As soon as the bath is over the patient should be washed with hot water\r\nand soap.\r\n\r\n4. The hot-air bath is excellent for colds, skin diseases, and the gout.\r\n{373}\r\n\r\nTHE SPONGE BATH.\r\n\r\n1. Have a large basin of water of the temperature of 88 or 95 degrees. As\r\nsoon as the patient rises rub the body over with a soft, dry towel until it\r\nbecomes warm.\r\n\r\n2. Now sponge the body with water and a little soap, at the same time\r\nkeeping the body well covered, except such portions as are necessarily\r\nexposed. Then dry the skin carefully with a soft, warm towel. Rub the skin\r\nwell for two or three minutes, until every part becomes red and perfectly\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n3. Sulphur, lime or salt, and sometimes mustard, may be used in any of the\r\nsponge baths, according to the disease.\r\n\r\nTHE FOOT BATH.\r\n\r\n1. The foot bath, in coughs, colds, asthma, headaches and fevers, is\r\nexcellent. One or two tablespoonfuls of ground mustard added to a gallon of\r\nhot water, is very beneficial.\r\n\r\n2. Heat the water as hot as the patient can endure it, and gradually\r\nincrease the temperature by pouring in additional quantities of hot water\r\nduring the bath.\r\n\r\nTHE SITZ BATH.\r\n\r\nA tub is arranged so that the patient can sit down in it while bathing.\r\nFill the tub about one-half full of water. This is an excellent remedy for\r\npiles, constipation, headache, gravel, and for acute and inflammatory\r\naffections generally.\r\n\r\nTHE ACID BATH.\r\n\r\nPlace a little vinegar in water, and heat to the usual temperature. This is\r\nan excellent remedy for the disorders of the liver.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Sure Cure for Prickly Heat.\r\n\r\n1. Prickly heat is caused by hot weather, by excess of flesh, by rough\r\nflannels, by sudden changes of temperature, or by over-fatigue.\r\n\r\n2. TREATMENT--Bathe two or three times a day with warm water, in which a\r\nmoderate quantity of bran and common soda has been stirred. After wiping\r\nthe skin dry, dust the affected parts with common cornstarch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{374}\r\n\r\nDigestibility of Food.\r\n\r\n  Article of Food.

PUBLIC BALLS.--The church should turn its face like flint against the\r\npublic ball. Its influence is evil, and nothing but evil. It is a well\r\nknown fact that in all cities and large towns the ball room is the\r\nrecruiting office for prostitution.\r\n\r\n2. THOUGHTLESS YOUNG WOMEN.--In cities public balls are given every night,\r\nand many thoughtless young women, {381} mostly the daughters of small\r\ntradesmen and mechanics, or clerks or laborers, are induced to attend \"just\r\nfor fun.\" Scarcely one in a hundred of the girls attending these balls\r\npreserve their purity. They meet the most desperate characters,\r\nprofessional gamblers, criminals and the lowest debauchees. Such an\r\nassembly and such influence cannot mean anything but ruin for an innocent\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n3. VILE WOMEN.--The public ball is always a resort of vile women who\r\npicture to innocent girls the ease and luxury of a harlot's life, and offer\r\nthem all manner of temptations to abandon the paths of virtue. The public\r\nball is the resort of the libertine and the adulterer, and whose object is\r\nto work the ruin of every innocent girl that may fall into their clutches.\r\n\r\n4. THE QUESTION.--Why does society wonder at the increase of prostitution,\r\nwhen the public balls and promiscuous dancing is so largely endorsed and\r\nencouraged?\r\n\r\n5. WORKING GIRLS.--Thousands of innocent working girls enter innocently and\r\nunsuspectingly into the paths which lead them to the house of evil, or who\r\nwander the streets as miserable outcasts all through the influence of the\r\ndance. The low theatre and dance halls and other places of unselected\r\ngatherings are the milestones which mark the working girl's downward path\r\nfrom virtue to vice, from modesty to shame.\r\n\r\n6. THE SALESWOMAN, the seamstress, the factory girl or any other virtuous\r\ngirl had better, far better, die than take the first step in the path of\r\nimpropriety and danger. Better, a thousand times better, better for this\r\nlife, better for the life to come, an existence of humble, virtuous\r\nindustry than a single departure from virtue, even though it were paid with\r\na fortune.\r\n\r\n7. TEMPTATIONS.--There is not a young girl but what is more or less tempted\r\nby some unprincipled wretch who may have the reputation of a genteel\r\nsociety man. It behooves parents to guard carefully the morals of their\r\ndaughters, and be vigilant and cautious in permitting them to accept the\r\nsociety of young men. Parents who desire to save their daughters from a\r\nfate which is worse than death, should endeavor by every means in their\r\npower to keep them from falling into traps cunningly devised by some\r\ncunning lover. There are many good young men, but not all are safe friends\r\nto an innocent, confiding young girl.\r\n\r\n8. PROSTITUTION.--Some girls inherit their vicious tendency; others fall\r\nbecause of misplaced affections; many sin through a love of dress, which is\r\nfostered by society and {382} by the surroundings amidst which they may be\r\nplaced; many, very many, embrace a life of shame to escape poverty. While\r\neach of these different phases of prostitution require a different remedy,\r\nwe need better men, better women, better laws and better protection for the\r\nyoung girls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RUSSIAN SPINNING GIRL.]\r\n\r\n9. A STARTLING FACT.--Startling as it may seem to some, it is a fact in our\r\nlarge cities that there are many girls raised {383} by parents with no\r\nother aim than to make them harlots. At a tender age they are sold by\r\nfathers and mothers into an existence which is worse than slavery itself.\r\nIt is not uncommon to see girls at the tender age of thirteen or\r\nfourteen--mere children--hardened courtesans, lost to all sense of shame\r\nand decency. They are reared in ignorance, surrounded by demoralizing\r\ninfluences, cut off from the blessings of church and Sabbath school, see\r\nnothing but licentiousness, intemperance and crime. These young girls are\r\nlost forever. They are beyond the reach of the moralist or preacher and\r\nhave no comprehension of modesty and purity. Virtue to them is a stranger,\r\nand has been from the cradle.\r\n\r\n10. A GREAT WRONG.--Parents too poor to clothe themselves bring children\r\ninto the world, children for whom they have no bread, consequently the girl\r\neasily falls a victim in early womanhood to the heartless libertine. The\r\nboy with no other schooling but that of the streets soon masters all the\r\nqualifications for a professional criminal. If there could be a law\r\nforbidding people to marry who have no visible means of supporting a\r\nfamily, or if they should marry, if their children could be taken from them\r\nand properly educated by the State, it would cost the country less and be a\r\ngreat step in advancing our civilization.\r\n\r\n11. THE FIRST STEP.--Thousands of fallen women could have been saved from\r\nlives of degradation and deaths of shame had they received more toleration\r\nand loving forgiveness in their first steps of error. Many women naturally\r\npure and virtuous have fallen to the lowest depths because discarded by\r\nfriends, frowned upon by society, and sneered at by the world, after they\r\nhad taken a single mis-step. Society forgives man, but woman never.\r\n\r\n12. IN THE BEGINNING of every girl's downward career there is necessarily a\r\nhesitation. She naturally ponders over what course to take, dreading to\r\nmeet friends and looking into the future with horror. That moment is the\r\nvital turning point in her career; a kind word of forgiveness, a mother's\r\nembrace a father's welcome may save her. The bloodhounds, known as the\r\nseducer, the libertine, the procurer, are upon her track; she is trembling\r\non the frightful brink of the abyss. Extend a helping hand and save her!\r\n\r\n13. FATHER, if your daughter goes astray, do not drive her from your home.\r\nMother, if your child errs, do not close your heart against her. Sisters\r\nand brothers and friends, do not force her into the pathway of shame, but\r\nrather strive to win her back into the Eden of virtue, and in nine cases\r\nout of ten you will succeed. {384}\r\n\r\n14. SOCIETY EVILS.--The dance, the theater, the wine-cup, the race-course,\r\nthe idle frivolity and luxury of summer watering places, all have a\r\ntendency to demoralize the young.\r\n\r\n15. BAD SOCIETY.--Much of our modern society admits libertines and seducers\r\nto the drawing-room, while it excludes their helpless and degraded victims,\r\nconsequently it is not strange that there are skeletons in many closets,\r\nmatrimonial infelicity and wayward girls.\r\n\r\n16. \"'KNOW THYSELF,' says Dr. Saur, \"is an important maxim for us all, and\r\nespecially is it true for girls.\r\n\r\n\"All are born with the desire to become attractive--girls especially want\r\nto grow up, not only attractive, but beautiful. Some girls think that\r\nbright eyes, pretty hair and fine clothes alone make them beautiful. This\r\nis not so. Real beauty depends upon good health, good manners and a pure\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"As the happiness of our girls depends upon their health, it behoves us all\r\nto guide the girls in such a way as to bring forward the best of results.\r\n\r\n17. \"THERE IS NO ONE who stands so near the girl as the mother. From early\r\nchildhood she occupies the first place in the little one's confidence--she\r\nlaughs, plays, and corrects, when necessary, the faults of her darling. She\r\nshould be equally ready to guide in the important laws of life and health\r\nupon which rest her future. Teach your daughters that in all things the\r\n'creative principle' has its source in life itself. It originates from\r\nDivine life, and when they know that it may be consecrated to wise and\r\nuseful purposes, they are never apt to grow up with base thoughts or form\r\nbad habits. Their lives become a happiness to themselves and a blessing to\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n18. TEACH WISELY.--\"Teach your daughters that _all life_ originates from a\r\nseed--a germ. Knowing this law, you need have no fears that base or\r\nunworthy thoughts of the reproductive function can ever enter their minds.\r\nThe growth, development and ripening of human seed becomes a beautiful and\r\nsacred mystery. The tree, the rose and all plant life are equally as\r\nmysterious and beautiful in their reproductive life. Does not this alone\r\nprove to us, conclusively, that there is a Divinity in the background\r\ngoverning, controlling and influencing our lives? Nature has no secrets,\r\nand why should we? None at all. The only care we should experience is in\r\nteaching wisely. {385}\r\n\r\n\"Yes--lead them wisely--teach them that the seed, the germ of a new life,\r\nis maturing within them. Teach them that between the ages of eleven and\r\nfourteen this maturing process has certain physical signs. The breasts grow\r\nround and full, the whole body, even the voice, undergoes a change. It is\r\nright that they should be taught the natural law of life in reproduction\r\nand the physiological structure of their being. Again we repeat that these\r\nlessons should be taught by the mother, and in a tender, delicate and\r\nconfidential way. Become, oh, mother, your daughter's companion, and she\r\nwill not go elsewhere for this knowledge--which must come to all in time,\r\nbut possibly too late and through sources that would prove more harm than\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n19. THE ORGANS OF CREATIVE LIFE in women are: Ovaries, Fallopian tubes,\r\nuterus, vagina and mammary glands. The _ovaries_ and _Fallopian tubes_ have\r\nalready been described under \"The Female Generative Organs.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _uterus_ is a pear-shaped muscular organ, situated in the lower\r\nportion of the pelvis, between the bladder and the rectum. It is less than\r\nthree inches in length and two inches in width and one in thickness.\r\n\r\n\"The _vagina_ is a membranous canal which joins the internal outlet with\r\nthe womb, which projects slightly into it. The opening into the vagina is\r\nnearly oval, and in those who have never indulged in sexual intercourse or\r\nin handling the sexual organs is more or less closed by a membrane termed\r\nthe _hymen_. The presence of this membrane was formerly considered as\r\nundoubted evidence of virginity; its absence, a lack of chastity.\r\n\r\n\"The _mammary glands_ are accessory to the generative organs. They secrete\r\nmilk, which the All-wise Father provided for the nourishment of the child\r\nafter birth.\r\n\r\n20. \"MENSTRUATION, which appears about the age of thirteen years, is the\r\nflow from the uterus that occurs every month as the seed-germ ripens in the\r\novaries. God made the sexual organs so that the race should not die out. He\r\ngave them to us so that we may reproduce life, and thus fill the highest\r\nposition in the created universe. The purpose for which they are made is\r\nhigh and holy and honorable, and if they are used only for this\r\npurpose--and they must not be used at all until they are fully\r\nmatured--they will be a source of greatest blessing to us all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOPEFUL YOUTH.]\r\n\r\n21. \"A CAREFUL STUDY of this organ, of its location, of its arteries and\r\nnerves, will convince the growing girl that {387} her body should never\r\nsubmit to corsets and tight lacing in response to the demands of fashion,\r\neven though nature has so bountifully provided for the safety of this\r\nimportant organ. By constant pressure the vagina and womb may be compressed\r\ninto one-third their natural length or crowded into an unnatural position.\r\nWe can readily see, then, the effect of lacing or tight clothing. Under\r\nthese circumstances the ligaments lose their elasticity, and as a result we\r\nhave prolapsus or falling of the womb.\r\n\r\n22. \"I AM MORE ANXIOUS for growing girls than for any other earthly object.\r\nThese girls are to be the mothers of future generations; upon them hangs\r\nthe destiny of the world in coming time, and if they can be made to\r\nunderstand what is right and what is wrong with regard to their own bodies\r\nnow, while they are young, the children they will give birth to and the men\r\nand women who shall call them mother will be of a higher type and belong to\r\na nobler class than those of the present day.\r\n\r\n23. \"ALL WOMEN CANNOT have good features, but they can look well, and it is\r\npossible to a great extent to correct deformity and develop much of the\r\nfigure. The first step to good looks is good health, and the first element\r\nof health is cleanliness. Keep clean--wash freely, bathe regularly. All the\r\nskin wants is leave to act, and it takes care of itself.\r\n\r\n24. \"GIRLS SOMETIMES GET THE IDEA that it is nice to be 'weak' and\r\n'delicate,' but they cannot get a more false idea! God meant women to be\r\nstrong and able-bodied, and only by being so can they be happy and capable\r\nof imparting happiness to others. It is only by being strong and healthy\r\nthat they can be perfect in their sexual nature; and it is only by being\r\nperfect in this part of their being that you can become a noble, grand and\r\nbeautiful woman.\r\n\r\n25. \"UP TO THE AGE of puberty, if the girl has grown naturally, waist, hips\r\nand shoulders are about the same in width, the shoulders being, perhaps, a\r\ntrifle the broadest. Up to this time the sexual organs have grown but\r\nlittle. Now they take a sudden start and need more room. Nature aids the\r\ngirls; the tissues and muscles increase in size and the pelvis bones\r\nenlarge. The limbs grow plump, the girl stops growing tall and becomes\r\nround and full. Unsuspected strength comes to her; tasks that were once\r\nhard to perform are now easy; her voice becomes sweeter and stronger. The\r\nmind develops more rapidly even than the body; her brain is more active and\r\nquicker; subjects that once were {388} dull and dry have unwonted interest;\r\nlessons are more easily learned; the eyes sparkle with intelligence,\r\nindicating increased mental power; her manner denotes the consciousness of\r\nnew power; toys of childhood are laid away; womanly thoughts and pursuits\r\nfill her mind; budding childhood has become blooming womanhood. Now, if\r\never, must be laid the foundation of physical vigor and of a healthy body.\r\nGirls should realize the significance of this fact. Do not get the idea\r\nthat men admire a weakly, puny, delicate, small-waisted, languid, doll-like\r\ncreature, a libel on true womanhood. Girls admire men with broad chests,\r\nsquare shoulders, erect form, keen bright eyes, hard muscles and undoubted\r\nvigor. Men also turn naturally to healthy, robust, well-developed girls,\r\nand to win their admiration girls must meet their ideals. A good form, a\r\nsound mind and a healthy body are within the reach of nine out of ten of\r\nour girls by proper care and training. Physical bankruptcy may claim the\r\nsame proportion if care and training are neglected.\r\n\r\n26. \"A WOMAN FIVE FEET TALL should measure two feet around the waist and\r\nthirty-three inches around the hips. A waist less than this proportion\r\nindicates compression either by lacing or tight clothing. Exercise in the\r\nopen air, take long walks and vigorous exercise, using care not to overdo\r\nit. Housework will prove a panacea for many of the ills which flesh is heir\r\nto. One hour's exercise at the wash-*tub is of far more value, from a\r\nphysical standpoint, than hours at the piano. Boating is most excellent\r\nexercise and within the reach of many. Care in dressing is also important,\r\nand, fortunately, fashion is coming to the rescue here. It is essential\r\nthat no garments be suspended from the waist. Let the shoulders bear the\r\nweight of all the clothing, so that the organs of the body may be left free\r\nand unimpeded.\r\n\r\n27. \"SLEEP SHOULD BE HAD regularly and abundantly. Avoid late hours, undue\r\nexcitement, evil associations; partake of plain, nutritious food, and\r\nhealth will be your reward. There is one way of destroying health, which,\r\nfortunately, is not as common among girls as boys, and which must be\r\nmentioned ere this chapter closes. Self-abuse is practised among growing\r\ngirls to such an extent as to arouse serious alarm. Many a girl has been\r\nled to handle and play with her sexual organs through the advice of some\r\ngirl who has obtained temporary pleasure in that {389} way; or, perchance,\r\nchafing has been followed by rubbing until the organs have become congested\r\nwith blood, and in this accidental manner the girl discovered what seems to\r\nher a source of pleasure, but which, alas, is a source of misery, and even\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n28. \"AS IN THE BOY, SO IN THE GIRL, self-abuse causes an undue amount of\r\nblood to flow to those organs, thus depriving other parts of the body of\r\nits nourishment, the weakest part first showing the effect of want of\r\nsustenance. All that has been said upon this loathsome subject in the\r\npreceding chapter for boys might well be repeated here, but space forbids.\r\nRead that chapter again, and know that the same signs that betray the boy\r\nwill make known the girl addicted to the vice. The bloodless lips, the\r\ndull, heavy eye surrounded with dark rings, the nerveless hand, the\r\nblanched cheek, the short breath, the old, faded look, the weakened memory\r\nand silly irritability tell the story all too plainly. The same evil result\r\nfollows, ending perhaps in death, or worse, in insanity. Aside from the\r\ninjury the girl does herself by yielding to this habit, there is one other\r\nreason which appeals to the conscience, and that is, self-abuse is an\r\noffence against moral law--it is putting to a vile, selfish use the organs\r\nwhich were given for a high, sacred purpose.\r\n\r\n29. \"LET THEM ALONE, except to care for them when care is needed, and they\r\nmay prove the greatest blessing you have ever known. They were given you\r\nthat you might become a mother, the highest office to which God has ever\r\ncalled one of His creatures. Do not debase yourself and become lower than\r\nthe beasts of the field. If this habit has fastened itself upon any one of\r\nour readers, stop it now. Do not allow yourself to think about it, give up\r\nall evil associations, seek pure companions, and go to your mother, older\r\nsister, or physician for advice.\r\n\r\n30. \"AND YOU, MOTHER, knowing the danger that besets your daughters at this\r\ncritical period, are you justified in keeping silent? Can you be held\r\nguiltless if your daughter ruins body and mind because you were _too\r\nmodest_ to tell her the laws of her being? There is no love that is dearer\r\nto your daughter than _yours_, no advice that is more respected than\r\n_yours_, no one whose warning would be more potent. Fail not in your duty.\r\nAs motherhood has been your sweetest joy, so help your daughter to make it\r\nhers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{390}\r\n\r\nSave the Boys.\r\n\r\nPLAIN WORDS TO PARENTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG GARFIELD DRIVING TEAM ON THE CANAL.]\r\n\r\n1. With a shy look, approaching his mother when she was alone, the boy of\r\nfifteen said, \"There are some things I want to ask you. I hear the boys\r\nspeak of them at school, and I don't understand, and a fellow doesn't like\r\nto ask any one but his mother.\"\r\n\r\n2. Drawing him down to her, in the darkness that was closing about them,\r\nthe mother spoke to her son and the son to his mother freely of things\r\nwhich everybody must know sooner or later, and which no boy should learn\r\nfrom \"anyone but his mother\" or father.\r\n\r\n3. If you do not answer such a natural question, your boy will turn for\r\nanswer to others, and learn things, perhaps, which your cheeks may well\r\nblush to have him know.\r\n\r\n4. Our boys and girls are growing faster than we think. The world moves; we\r\ncan no longer put off our children {391} with the old nurses' tales; even\r\nMacDonald's beautiful statement,\r\n\r\n \"Out of the everywhere into the there\",\r\n\r\ndoes not satisfy them when they reverse his question and ask, \"Where did I\r\ncome from?\"\r\n\r\n5. They must be answered. If we put them off, they may be tempted to go\r\nelsewhere for information, and hear half-truths, or whole truths so\r\ndistorted, so mingled with what is low and impure that, struggle against it\r\nas they may in later years, their minds will always retain these early\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\n6. It is not so hard if you begin early. The very flowers are object\r\nlessons. The wonderful mystery of life is wrapped in one flower, with its\r\nstamens, pistils and ovaries. Every child knows how an egg came in the\r\nnest, and takes it as a matter of course; why not go one step farther with\r\nthem and teach the wonder, the beauty, the holiness that surrounds\r\nmaternity anywhere? Why, centuries ago the Romans honored, and taught their\r\nboys to honor, the women in whose safety was bound up the future of their\r\nexistence as a nation! Why should we do less?\r\n\r\n7. Your sons and mine, your daughters and mine, need to be wisely taught\r\nand guarded just along these lines, if your sons and mine, your daughters\r\nand mine, are to grow up into a pure, healthy, Christian manhood and\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{392} 8. [4]\"How grand is the boy who has kept himself undefiled! His\r\ncomplexion clear, his muscles firm, his movements vigorous, his manner\r\nfrank, his courage undaunted, his brain active, his will firm, his\r\nself-control perfect, his body and mind unfolding day by day. His life\r\nshould be one song of praise and thanksgiving. If you want your boy to be\r\nsuch a one, train him, my dear woman, _to-day_, and his _to-morrow_ will\r\ntake care of itself.\r\n\r\n9. \"Think you that good seed sown will bring forth bitter fruit? A thousand\r\ntimes, No! As we sow, so shall we reap. Train your boys in morality,\r\ntemperance and virtue. Teach them to embrace good and shun evil. Teach them\r\nthe true from the false; the light from the dark. Teach them that when they\r\ntake a thing that is not their own, they commit a sin. Teach them that _sin\r\nmeans disobedience of God's laws of every kind_.\r\n\r\n10. \"God made every organ of our body with the intention that it should\r\nperform a certain work. If we wish to see, we use our eyes; if we want to\r\nhear, our ears are called into use. In fact, nature teaches us the proper\r\nuse of _all our organs_. I say to you, mother, and oh, so earnestly: 'Go\r\nteach your boy that which you may never be ashamed to do, about these\r\norgans that make him _specially a boy_.'\r\n\r\n11. \"Teach him they are called _sexual organs_; that they are not impure,\r\nbut of special importance, and made by God for a definite purpose. Teach\r\nhim that there are impurities taken from the system in fluid form called\r\nurine, and that it passes through the sexual organs, but that nature takes\r\ncare of that. Teach him that these organs are given as a sacred trust, that\r\nin maturer years he may be the means of giving life to those who shall live\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n12. \"Impress upon him that if these organs are abused, or if they are put\r\nto any use besides that for which God made them--and He did not intend they\r\nshould be used at all until man is fully grown--they will bring disease and\r\nruin upon those who abuse and disobey the laws which God has made to govern\r\nthem. If he has ever learned to handle his _sexual organs_, or to touch\r\nthem in any way except to keep them clean, not to do it again. If he does\r\nhe will not grow up happy, healthy and strong.\r\n\r\n13. \"Teach him that when he handles or excites the {393} sexual organs all\r\nparts of the body suffer, because they are connected by nerves that run\r\nthroughout the system; this is why it is called 'self-abuse.' The whole\r\nbody is abused when this part of the body is handled or excited in any\r\nmanner whatever. Teach them to shun all children who indulge in this\r\nloathsome habit, or all children who talk about these things. The sin is\r\nterrible, and is, in fact, worse than lying or stealing. For, although\r\nthese are wicked and will ruin their souls, yet this habit of self-abuse\r\nwill ruin both soul and body.\r\n\r\n14. \"If the sexual organs are handled, it brings too much blood to these\r\nparts, and this produces a diseased condition; it also causes disease in\r\nother organs of the body, because they are left with a less amount of blood\r\nthan they ought to have. The sexual organs, too, are very closely connected\r\nwith the spine and the brain by means of the nerves, and if they are\r\nhandled, or if you keep thinking about them, these nerves get excited and\r\nbecome exhausted, and this makes the back ache, the brain heavy and the\r\nwhole body weak.\r\n\r\n15. \"It lays the foundation for consumption, paralysis and heart disease.\r\nIt weakens the memory, makes a boy careless, negligent and listless. It\r\neven makes many lose their minds; others, when grown, commit suicide. How\r\noften mothers see their little boys handling themselves, and let it pass,\r\nbecause they think the boy will outgrow the habit, and do not realize the\r\nstrong hold it has upon them. I say to you who love your boys--'Watch!'\r\n\r\n16. \"Don't think it does no harm to your boy because he does not suffer\r\nnow, for the effects of this vice come on so slowly that the victim is\r\noften very near death before you realize that he has done himself harm. The\r\nboy with no knowledge of the consequences, and with no one to warn him,\r\nfinds momentary pleasure in its practice, and so contracts a habit which\r\ngrows upon him, undermining his health, poisoning his mind, arresting his\r\ndevelopment, and laying the foundation for future misery.\r\n\r\n17. \"Do not read this book and forget it, for it contains earnest and\r\nliving truths. Do not let false modesty stand in your way, but from this\r\ntime on keep this thought in mind--'the saving of your boy.' Follow its\r\nteachings and you will bless God as long as you live. Read it to your\r\nneighbors, who, like yourself, have growing boys, and urge them for the\r\nsake of humanity to heed its advice. {394}\r\n\r\n18. \"Right here we want to emphasize the importance of _cleanliness_. We\r\nverily believe that oftentimes these habits originate in a burning and\r\nirritating sensation about the organs, caused by a want of thorough\r\nwashing.\r\n\r\n19. \"It is worthy of note that many eminent physicians now advocate the\r\ncustom of circumcision, claiming that the removal of a little of the\r\nforeskin induces cleanliness, thus preventing the irritation and excitement\r\nwhich come from the gathering of the whiteish matter under the foreskin at\r\nthe beginning of the glands. This irritation being removed, the boy is less\r\napt to tamper with his sexual organs. The argument seems a good one,\r\nespecially when we call to mind the high physical state of those people who\r\nhave practiced the custom.\r\n\r\n20. \"Happy is the mother who can feel she has done her duty, in this\r\ndirection, while her boy is still a child. For those mothers, though, whose\r\nlittle boys have now grown to boyhood with the evil still upon them, and\r\n_you_, through ignorance, permitted it, we would say, 'Begin at once; it is\r\nnever too late.' If he has not lost all will power, he can be saved. Let\r\nhim go in confidence to a reputable physician and follow his advice. Simple\r\ndiet, plentiful exercise in open air and congenial employment will do much.\r\nDo not let the mind dwell upon evil thoughts, shun evil companions, avoid\r\nvulgar stories, sensational novels, and keep the thoughts pure.\r\n\r\n21. \"Let him interest himself in social and benevolent affairs, participate\r\nin Sunday-school work, farmers' clubs, or any organizations which tend to\r\nelevate and inspire noble sentiment. Let us remember that 'a perfect man is\r\nthe noblest work of God.' God has given us a life which is to last forever,\r\nand the little time we spend on earth is as nothing to the ages which we\r\nare to spend in the world beyond; so our earthly life is a very important\r\npart of our existence, for it is here that the foundation is laid for\r\neither happiness or misery in the future. It is here that we decide our\r\ndestiny, and our efforts to know and obey God's laws in our bodies as well\r\nas in our souls will not only bring blessings to us in this life, but\r\nnever-ending happiness throughout eternity.\"\r\n\r\n22. A QUESTION.--How can a father chew and smoke tobacco, drink and swear,\r\nuse vulgar language, tell obscene stories, and raise a family of pure,\r\nclean-minded children? LET THE ECHO ANSWER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{396}\r\n\r\nThe Inhumanities of Parents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD ADAGE: \"HE WHO LOVES CHILDREN WILL DO YOU NO HARM.\"]\r\n\r\n1. Not long ago a Presbyterian minister in Western New York whipped his\r\nthree-year-old boy to death for refusing to say his prayers. The little\r\nfingers were broken; the tender flesh was bruised and actually mangled;\r\nstrong men wept when they looked on the lifeless body. Think of a strong\r\nman from one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds in weight, pouncing\r\nupon a little child, like a Tiger upon a Lamb, and with his strong arm\r\ninflicting physical blows on the delicate tissues of a child's body. See\r\nits frail and trembling flesh quiver and its tender nervous organization\r\nshaking with terror and fear.\r\n\r\n2. How often is this the case in the punishment of children all over this\r\nbroad land! Death is not often the immediate consequence of this brutality\r\nas in the above stated case, but the punishment is often as unjust, and the\r\nphysical constitution of children is often ruined and the mind by fright\r\nseriously injured.\r\n\r\n3. Everyone knows the sudden sense of pain, and sometimes dizziness and\r\nnausea follow, as the results of an accidental hitting of the ankle, knee\r\nor elbow against a hard substance, and involuntary tears are brought to the\r\neyes; but what is such a pain as this compared with the pains of a dozen or\r\nmore quick blows on the body of a little helpless child from the strong arm\r\nof a parent in a passion? Add to this overwhelming terror of fright, the\r\nstrangulating effects of sighing and shrieking, and you have a complete\r\npicture of child-torture.\r\n\r\n4. Who has not often seen a child receive, within an hour or two of the\r\nfirst whipping, a second one, for some small ebullition of nervous\r\nirritability, which was simply inevitable from its spent and worn\r\ncondition?\r\n\r\n5. Would not all mankind cry out at the inhumanity of one who, as things\r\nare to-day, should propose the substitution of pricking or cutting or\r\nburning for whipping? It would, however, be easy to show that small jabs or\r\npricks or cuts are more human than the blows many children receive. Why may\r\nnot lying be as legitimately cured by blisters made with hot coals as by\r\nblack and blue spots made with a ruler or whip? The principle is the same;\r\nand if the principle is right, why not multiply methods?\r\n\r\n6. How many loving mothers will, without any thought of cruelty, inflict\r\nhalf a dozen quick blows on the little hand of her child, and when she\r\ncould no more take a pin and make {397} the same number of thrusts into the\r\ntender flesh, than she could bind the baby on a rack. Yet the pin-thrust\r\nwould hurt far less, and would probably make a deeper impression on the\r\nchild's mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n7. We do not intend to be understood that a child must have everything that\r\nit desires and every whim and wish to receive special recognition by the\r\nparents. Children can soon be made to understand the necessity of\r\nobedience, and punishment can easily be brought about by teaching them\r\nself-denial. Deny them the use of a certain plaything, deny {398} them the\r\nprivilege of visiting certain of their little friends, deny them the\r\nprivilege of the table, etc., and these self-denials can be applied\r\naccording to the age and condition of the child, with firmness and without\r\nany yielding. Children will soon learn obedience if they see the parents\r\nare sincere. Lessons of home government can be learned by the children at\r\nhome as well as they can learn lessons at school.\r\n\r\n8. The trouble is, many parents need more government, more training and\r\nmore discipline than the little ones under their control.\r\n\r\n9. Scores of times during the day a child is told in a short, authoritative\r\nway to do or not to do certain little things, which we ask at the hands of\r\nelder persons as favors. When we speak to an elder person, we say, would\r\nyou be so kind as to close the door, when the same person making the\r\nrequest of a child will say, \"_Shut the door._\" \"_Bring me the chair._\"\r\n\"_Stop that noise._\" \"_Sit down there._\" Whereas, if the same kindness was\r\nused towards the child it would soon learn to imitate the example.\r\n\r\n10. On the other hand, let a child ask for anything without saying\r\n\"please,\" receive anything without saying \"thank you,\" it suffers a rebuke\r\nand a look of scorn at once. Often a child insists on having a book, chair\r\nor apple to the inconveniencing of an elder, and what an outcry is raised:\r\n\"Such rudeness;\" \"Such an ill-mannered child;\" \"His parents must have\r\nneglected him strangely.\" Not at all: The parents may have been steadily\r\ntelling him a great many times every day not to do these precise things\r\nwhich you dislike. But they themselves have been all the time doing those\r\nvery things before him, and there is no proverb that strikes a truer\r\nbalance between two things than the old one which weighs example over\r\nagainst precept.\r\n\r\n11. It is a bad policy to be rude to children. A child will win and be won,\r\nand in a long run the chances are that the child will have better manners\r\nthan its parents. Give them a good example and take pains in teaching them\r\nlessons of obedience and propriety, and there will be little difficulty in\r\nraising a family of beautiful and well-behaved children.\r\n\r\n12. Never correct a child in the presence of others; it is a rudeness to\r\nthe child that will soon destroy its self-respect. It is the way criminals\r\nare made and should always and everywhere be condemned.\r\n\r\n13. But there are no words to say what we are or what we deserve, if we do\r\nthis to the little children whom we {399} have dared for our own pleasure\r\nto bring into the perils of this life, and whose whole future may be\r\nblighted by the mistakes of our careless hands. There are thousands of\r\nyoung men and women to-day groaning under the penalties and burdens of\r\nlife, who owe their misfortunes, their shipwreck and ruin to the ignorance\r\nor indifference of parents.\r\n\r\n14. Parents of course love their children, but with that love there is a\r\nresponsibility that cannot be shirked. The government and training of\r\nchildren is a study that demands a parent's time and attention often much\r\nmore than the claims of business.\r\n\r\n15. Parents, study the problems that come up every day in your home.\r\nRemember, your future happiness, and the future welfare of your children,\r\ndepend upon it.\r\n\r\n16. CRIMINALS AND HEREDITY.--Wm. M. F. Round was for many years in charge\r\nof the House of Refuge on Randall's Island, New York, and his opportunities\r\nfor observation in the work among criminals surely make him a competent\r\njudge, and he says in his letter to the New York Observer: \"Among this\r\nlarge number of young offenders I can state with entire confidence that not\r\none per cent. were children born of criminal parents; and with equal\r\nconfidence I am able to say that the common cause of their delinquency was\r\nfound in bad parental training, in bad companionship, and in lack of\r\nwholesome restraint from evil associations and influences. It was this\r\nknowledge that led to the establishing of the House of Refuge nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a century ago.\"\r\n\r\n17. BAD TRAINING.--Thus it is seen from one of the best authorities in the\r\nUnited States that criminals are made either by the indifference or the\r\nneglect of parents, or both, or by too much training without proper\r\njudgment and knowledge. Give your children a good example, and never tell a\r\nchild to do something and then become indifferent as to whether they do it\r\nor not. A child should never be told twice to do the same thing. Teach the\r\nchild in childhood obedience and never vary from that rule. Do it kindly\r\nbut firmly.\r\n\r\n18. IF YOUR CHILDREN DO NOT OBEY OR RESPECT YOU in their childhood and\r\nyouth, how can you expect to govern them when older and shape their\r\ncharacter for future usefulness and good citizenship?\r\n\r\n19. THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE.--Never tell a child twice to do the same thing.\r\nCommand the respect of your children, and there will be no question as to\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{400}\r\n\r\nChastity and Purity of Character.\r\n\r\n1. CHASTITY is the purest and brightest jewel in human character. Dr.\r\nPierce in his widely known _Medical Adviser_ says: For the full and perfect\r\ndevelopment of mankind, both mental and physical, chastity is necessary.\r\nThe health demands abstinence from unlawful intercourse. Therefore children\r\nshould be instructed to avoid all impure works of fiction, which tend to\r\ninflame the mind and excite the passions. Only in total abstinence from\r\nillicit pleasures is there safety, morals, and health, while integrity,\r\npeace and happiness are the conscious rewards of virtue. Impurity travels\r\ndownward with intemperance, obscenity and corrupting diseases, to\r\ndegradation and death. A dissolute, licentious, free-and-easy life is\r\nfilled with the dregs of human suffering, iniquity and despair. The\r\npenalties which follow a violation of the law of chastity are found to be\r\nsevere and swiftly retributive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n2. THE UNION of the sexes in holy Matrimony is a law of nature, finding\r\nsanction in both morals and legislation. Even some of the lower animals\r\nunite in this union for life and instinctively observe the law of conjugal\r\nfidelity with a consistency which might put to blush other animals more\r\nhighly endowed. It seems important to discuss this subject and understand\r\nour social evils, as well as the intense passional desires of the sexes,\r\nwhich must be controlled, or they lead to ruin.\r\n\r\n3. SEXUAL PROPENSITIES are possessed by all, and these must be held in\r\nabeyance, until they are needed for legitimate purposes. Hence parents\r\nought to understand the value to their children of mental and physical\r\nlabor, to elevate and strengthen the intellectual and moral faculties, to\r\ndevelop the muscular system and direct the energies of the blood into\r\nhealthful channels. Vigorous employment of mind and body engrosses the\r\nvital energies and diverts them from undue excitement of the sexual\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\n_Give your young people plenty of outdoor amusement; less of dancing and\r\nmore of croquet and lawn tennis. Stimulate the methods of pure thoughts in\r\ninnocent amusement, and your sons and daughters will mature to manhood and\r\nwomanhood pure and chaste in character._ {401}\r\n\r\n4. IGNORANCE DOES NOT MEAN INNOCENCE.--It is a current idea, especially\r\namong our good common people, that the child should be kept in ignorance\r\nregarding the mystery of his own body and how he was created or came into\r\nthe world. This is a great mistake. Parents must know that the sources of\r\nsocial impurity are great, and the child is a hundred times more liable to\r\nhave his young mind poisoned if entirely ignorant of the functions of his\r\nnature than if judiciously enlightened on these important truths by the\r\nparent. The parent must give him weapons of defense against the putrid\r\ncorruption he is sure to meet outside the parental roof. The child cannot\r\nget through the A, B, C period of school without it.\r\n\r\n5. CONFLICTING VIEWS.--There is a great difference of opinion regarding the\r\nage at which the child should be taught the mysteries of nature: some\r\nmaintain that he cannot comprehend the subject before the age of puberty;\r\nothers say \"they will find it out soon enough, it is not best to have them\r\nover-wise while they are so young. Wait a while.\" That is just the point\r\n(_they will find it out_), and we ask in all candor, is it not better that\r\nthey learn it from the pure loving mother, untarnished from any insinuating\r\nremark, than that they should learn it from some foul-mouthed libertine on\r\nthe street, or some giddy girl at school? Mothers! fathers! which think you\r\nis the most sensible and fraught with the least danger to your darling boy\r\nor girl?\r\n\r\n6. DELAY IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER.--Knowledge on a subject so vitally\r\nconnected with moral health must not be deferred. It is safe to say that no\r\nchild, no boy at least in these days of excitement and unrest, reaches the\r\nage of ten years without getting some idea of nature's laws regarding\r\nparenthood. And ninety-nine chances to one, those ideas will be vile and\r\npernicious unless they come from a wise, loving and pure parent. Now, we\r\nentreat you, parents, mothers! do not wait; begin before a false notion has\r\nhad chance to find lodgment in the childish mind. But remember this is a\r\nlesson of life, it cannot be told in one chapter; it is as important as the\r\nlessons of love and duty.\r\n\r\n7. THE FIRST LESSONS.--Should you be asked by your four or five-year old,\r\n\"Mamma, where did you get me?\" Instead of saying, \"The doctor brought you,\"\r\nor \"God made you and a stork brought you from Babyland on his back,\" tell\r\nhim the truth as you would about any ordinary question. One mother's\r\nexplanation was something like this: \"My dear, you were not made any more\r\nthan apples are made, or the little chickens are made. Your dolly was {402}\r\nmade, but it has no life like you have. God has provided that all living\r\nthings such as plants, trees, little chickens, little kittens, little\r\nbabies, etc., should grow from seeds or little tiny eggs. Apples grow,\r\nlittle chickens grow, little babies grow. Apple and peach trees grow from\r\nseeds that are planted in the ground, and the apples and peaches grow on\r\nthe trees. Baby chickens grow inside the eggs that are kept warm by the\r\nmother hen for a certain time. Baby boys and girls do not grow inside an\r\negg, but they start to grow inside of a snug warm nest, from an egg that is\r\nso small you cannot see it with just your eye.\" This was not given at once,\r\nbut from time to time as the child asked questions and in the simplest\r\nlanguage, with many illustrations from plant and animal life. It may have\r\noccupied months, but in time the lesson was fully understood.\r\n\r\n8. THE SECOND LESSON.--The second lesson came with the question, \"But\r\n_where_ is the nest?\" The ice is now broken, as it were; it was an easy\r\nmatter for the mother to say, \"The nest in which you grew, dear, was close\r\nto your mother's heart inside her body. All things that do not grow inside\r\nthe egg itself, and which are kept warm by the mother's body, begin to grow\r\nfrom the egg in a nest inside the mother's body.\" It may be that this\r\nmother had access to illustrations of the babe in the womb which were shown\r\nand explained to the child, a boy. He was pleased and satisfied with the\r\nexplanations. It meant nothing out of the ordinary any more than a primary\r\nlesson on the circulatory system did, it was knowledge on nature in its\r\npurity and simplicity taught by mother, and hence caused no surprise. The\r\nsubject of the male and female generative organs came later; the greatest\r\npains and care was taken to make it clear, the little boy was taught that\r\nthe _sexual organs_ were made for a high and holy purpose, that their\r\noffice at present is only to carry off impurities from the system in the\r\nfluid form called urine, and that he must never handle his _sexual organs_\r\nnor touch them in any way except to keep them clean, and if he does this,\r\nhe will grow up a bright, happy and healthy boy. But if he excites or\r\n_abuses_ them, he will become puny, sickly and unhappy. All this was\r\nexplained in language pure and simple. There is now in the boy a sturdy\r\nbase of character building along the line of virtue and purity through\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n9. SILLY DIRTY TRASH.--But I hear some mother say \"Such silly dirty trash\r\nto tell a child!\" It is not dirty nor silly; it is nature's untarnished\r\ntruth. God has ordained that children should thus be brought into the\r\nworld, do you call the works of God silly? Remember, kind mother, and {403}\r\ndon't forget it, if you fail to teach your children, boys or girls, these\r\nimportant lessons early in life, they will learn them from other sources,\r\nperhaps long ere you dream of it, and ninety-nine times out of one hundred\r\nthey will get improper, perverted, impure and vile ideas of these important\r\ntruths; besides you have lost their confidence and you will never regain it\r\nin these matters. They will never come to mamma for information on these\r\nsubjects. And, think you, that your son and daughter, later in life will\r\nmake you their confidant as they ought? Will your beautiful daughter hand\r\nthe first letters she receives from her lover to mamma to read, and seek\r\nher counsel and advice when she replies to them? Will she ask mamma whether\r\nit is ever proper to sit in her lover's lap? I think not; you have blighted\r\nher confidence and alienated her affections. You have kept knowledge from\r\nher that she had a right to know; you even failed to teach her the\r\nimportant truths of menstruation. Troubled and excited at the first\r\nmenstrual flow, she dashed her feet in cold water hoping to stop the flow.\r\nYou know the results--she is now twenty-five but is suffering from it to\r\nthis day. You, her mother, over fastidious, _so very nice_ you would never\r\nmention \"_such silly trash_,\" but by your consummate foolishness and mock\r\nmodesty you have ruined your daughter's health, and though in later years\r\nshe may forgive you, yet she can never love and respect you as she ought.\r\n\r\n10. \"KNOWLEDGE THE PRESERVER OF PURITY.\"--Laura E. Scammon, writing on this\r\nsubject, in the _Arena_ of November, 1893, says: \"When questions arise that\r\ncan not be answered by observation, reply to each as simply and directly as\r\nyou answer questions upon other subjects, giving scientific names and\r\nfacts, and such explanations as are suited to the comprehension of the\r\nchild. Treat nature and her laws always with serious, respectful attention.\r\nTreat the holy mysteries of parenthood reverently, never losing sight of\r\nthe great law upon which are founded all others--the law of love. Say it\r\nand sing it, play it and pray it into the soul of your child, that _love is\r\nlord of all_.\"\r\n\r\n11. CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--Observation and common sense should\r\nteach every parent that lack of knowledge on these subjects and proper\r\ncounsel and advice in later years is the main cause of so many charming\r\ngirls being seduced and led astray, and so many bright promising boys\r\nwrecked by _self-abuse_ or _social impurity_. Make your children your\r\nconfidants early in life, especially in these things, have frequent talks\r\nwith them on nature, and you will never, other things being equal, mourn\r\nover a ruined daughter or a wreckless, debased son.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{404}\r\n\r\nExciting the Passions in Children.\r\n\r\n1. CONVERSATION BEFORE CHILDREN.--The conduct and conversation of adults\r\nbefore children and youth, how often have I blushed with shame, and kindled\r\nwith indignation at the conversation of parents, and especially of mothers,\r\nto their children: \"John, go and kiss Harriet, for she is your\r\nsweet-heart.\" Well may shame make him hesitate and hang his head. \"Why,\r\nJohn, I did not think you so great a coward. Afraid of the girls, are you?\r\nThat will never do. Come, go along, and hug and kiss her. There, that's a\r\nman. I guess you will love the girls yet.\" Continually is he teased about\r\nthe girls and being in love, till he really selects a sweet-heart.\r\n\r\n2. THE LOSS OF MAIDEN PURITY AND NATURAL DELICACY.--I will not lift the\r\nveil, nor expose the conduct of children among themselves. And all this\r\nbecause adults have filled their heads with those impurities which surfeit\r\ntheir own. What could more effectually wear off that natural delicacy, that\r\nmaiden purity and bashfulness, which form the main barriers against the\r\ninflux of vitiated Amativeness? How often do those whose modesty has been\r\nworn smooth, even take pleasure in thus saying and doing things to raise\r\nthe blush on the cheek of youth and innocence, merely to witness the effect\r\nof this improper illusion upon them; little realizing that they are thereby\r\nbreaking down the barriers of their virtue, and prematurely kindling the\r\nfires of animal passion!\r\n\r\n3. BALLS, PARTIES AND AMUSEMENTS.--The entire machinery of balls and\r\nparties, of dances and other amusements of young people, tend to excite and\r\ninflame this passion. Thinking it a fine thing to get in love, they court\r\nand form attachments long before either their mental or physical powers are\r\nmatured. Of course, these young loves, these green-house exotics, must be\r\nbroken off, and their miserable subjects left burning up with the fierce\r\nfires of a flaming passion, which, if left alone, would have slumbered on\r\nfor years, till they were prepared for its proper management and exercise.\r\n\r\n4. SOWING THE SEEDS FOR FUTURE RUIN.--Nor is it merely the conversation of\r\nadults that does all this mischief; their manners also increase it. Young\r\nmen take the hands of girls from six to thirteen years old, kiss them,\r\npress them, and play with them so as, in a great variety of ways, to excite\r\ntheir innocent passions, combined, I grant, with friendship and\r\nrefinement--for all this is genteely done. They {405} intend no harm, and\r\nparents dream of none: and yet their embryo love is awakened, to be again\r\nstill more easily excited. Maiden ladies, and even married women, often\r\nexpress similar feelings towards lads, not perhaps positively improper in\r\nthemselves, yet injurious in their ultimate effects.\r\n\r\n5. READING NOVELS.--How often have I seen girls not twelve years old, as\r\nhungry for a story or novel as they should be for their dinners! A sickly\r\nsentimentalism is thus formed, and their minds are sullied with impure\r\ndesires. Every fashionable young lady must of course read every new novel,\r\nthough nearly all of them contain exceptionable allusions, perhaps\r\ndelicately covered over with a thin gauze of fashionable refinement; yet,\r\non that very account, the more objectionable. If this work contained one\r\nimproper allusion to their ten, many of those fastidious ladies who now\r\neagerly devour the vulgarities of Dumas, and the double-entendres of\r\nBulwer, and even converse with gentlemen about their contents, would\r\ndiscountenance or condemn it as improper. _Shame on novel-reading women_;\r\nfor they cannot have pure minds or unsullied feelings but Cupid and the\r\nbeaux, and waking of dreams of love, are fast consuming their health and\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\n6. THEATER-GOING.--Theaters and theatrical dancing, also inflame the\r\npassions, and are \"the wide gate\" of \"the broad road\" of moral impurity.\r\nFashionable music is another, especially the verses set to it, being mostly\r\nlove-sick ditties, or sentimental odes, breathing this tender passion in\r\nits most melting and bewitching strains. Improper prints often do immense\r\ninjury in this respect, as do also balls, parties, annuals, newspaper\r\narticles, exceptional works, etc.\r\n\r\n7. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--Stop for one moment and think for\r\nyourself and you will be convinced that the sentiment herein announced is\r\nfor your good and the benefit of all mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{406}\r\n\r\nPuberty, Virility and Hygienic Laws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. WHAT IS PUBERTY?--The definition is explained in another portion of this\r\nbook, but it should be understood that it is not a prompt or immediate\r\nchange; it is a slow extending growth and may extend for many years. The\r\nripening of physical powers do not take place when the first signs of\r\npuberty appear.\r\n\r\n2. PROPER AGE.--The proper age for puberty should vary from twelve to\r\neighteen years. As a general rule, in the more vigorous and the more\r\naddicted to athletic exercise or out-door life, this change is slower in\r\nmaking its approach.\r\n\r\n3. HYGIENIC ATTENTION.--Youths at this period should receive special\r\nprivate attention. They should be taught the purpose of the sexual organs\r\nand the proper hygienic laws that govern them, and they should also be\r\ntaught to rise in the morning and not to lie in bed after waking up,\r\nbecause it is largely owing to this habit that the secret vice is\r\ncontracted. One of the common causes of premature excitement in many boys\r\nis a tight foreskin. It may cause much evil and ought always to be\r\nremedied. Ill-fitting garments often cause much irritation in children and\r\nproduce unnatural passions. It is best to have boys sleep in separate beds\r\nand not have them sleep together if it can be avoided. {407}\r\n\r\n4. PROPER INFLUENCE.--Every boy and girl should be carefully trained to\r\nlook with disgust on everything that is indecent in word or action. Let\r\nthem be taught a sense of shame in doing shameful things, and teach them\r\nthat modesty is honorable, and that immodesty is indecent and dishonorable.\r\nCareful training at the proper age may save many a boy or girl from ruin.\r\n\r\n5. SEXUAL PASSIONS.--The sexual passions may be a fire from heaven, or a\r\nsubtle flame from hell. It depends upon the government and proper control.\r\nThe noblest and most unselfish emotions take their arise in the passion of\r\nsex. Its sweet influence, its elevating ties, its vibrations and harmony,\r\nall combine to make up the noble and courageous traits of man.\r\n\r\n6. WHEN PASSIONS BEGIN.--It is thought by some that passions begin at the\r\nage of puberty, but the passions may be produced as early as five or ten\r\nyears. All depends upon the training or the want of it. Self-abuse is not\r\nan uncommon evil at the age of eight or ten. A company of bad boys often\r\nteach an innocent child that which will develop his ruin. A boy may feel a\r\nsense of pleasure at eight and produce a slight discharge, but not of\r\nsemen. Thus it is seen that parents may by neglect do their child the\r\ngreatest injury.\r\n\r\n7. FALSE MODESTY.--Let there be no false modesty on part of the parents.\r\nGive the child the necessary advice and instructions as soon as necessary.\r\n\r\n8. THE MAN UNSEXED, by Mutilation or Masturbation. Eunuchs are proverbial\r\nfor their cruelty and crafty and unsympathizing dispositions. Their mental\r\npowers are feeble and their physical strength is inferior. They lack\r\ncourage and physical endurance. When a child is operated upon before the\r\nage of puberty, the voice retains its childish treble, the limbs their soft\r\nand rounded outlines, and the neck acquires a feminine fulness; no beard\r\nmakes its appearance. In ancient times and up to this time in Oriental\r\nnations eunuchs are found. They are generally slaves who have suffered\r\nmutilation at a tender age. It is a scientific fact that where boys have\r\nbeen taught the practice of masturbation in their early years, say from\r\neight to fourteen years of age, if they survive at all they often have\r\ntheir powers reduced to a similar condition of a eunuch. They generally\r\nhowever suffer a greater disadvantage. Their health will be more or less\r\ninjured. In the eunuch the power of sexual intercourse is not entirely lost\r\nbut of course there is sterility and little if any satisfaction, and the\r\nsame thing may be true of the victim of self-abuse. {408}\r\n\r\n9. SIGNS OF VIRILITY.--As the young man develops in strength and years the\r\nsexual appetite will manifest itself. The secretion of the male known as\r\nthe seed or semen depends for the life-transmitting power upon little\r\nminute bodies called spermatozoa. These are very active and numerous in a\r\nhealthy secretion, being many hundreds in a single drop and a single one of\r\nthem is capable to bring about conception in a female. Dr. Napheys in his\r\n\"Transmission of Life,\" says: \"The secreted fluid has been frozen and kept\r\nat a temperature of zero for four days, yet when it was thawed these\r\nanimalcules, as they are supposed to be, were as active as ever. They are\r\nnot, however, always present, and when present may be of variable activity.\r\nIn young men, just past puberty, and in aged men, they are often scarce and\r\nlanguid in motion.\" At the proper age the secretion is supposed to be the\r\nmost active, generally at the age of twenty-five, and decreases as age\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n10. HYGIENIC RULE.--The man at mid-life should guard carefully his passions\r\nand the husband his virile powers, and as the years progress, steadily wean\r\nhimself more from his desire, for his passions will become weaker with age\r\nand any excitement in middle life may soon debilitate and destroy his\r\nvirile powers.\r\n\r\n11. FOLLIES OF YOUTH.--Dr. Napheys says: \"Not many men can fritter away a\r\ndecade or two of years in dissipation and excess, and ever hope to make up\r\ntheir losses by rigid surveillance in later years.\" \"The sins of youth are\r\nexpiated in age,\" is a proverb which daily examples illustrate. In\r\nproportion as puberty is precocious, will decadence be premature; the\r\nexcesses of middle life draw heavily on the fortune of later years. \"The\r\nmill of the gods grinds slow, but it grinds exceedingly fine,\" and though\r\nnature may be a tardy creditor, she is found at last to be an inexorable\r\none.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{409}\r\n\r\nOur Secret Sins.\r\n\r\n1. PASSIONS.--Every healthful man has sexual desires, and he might as well\r\nrefuse to satisfy his hunger as to deny their existence. The Creator has\r\ngiven us various appetites, intended they should be indulged, and has\r\nprovided the means.\r\n\r\n2. REASON.--While it is true that a healthy man has strongly developed\r\nsexual passions, yet, God has crowned man with reason, and with a proper\r\nexercise of this wonderful faculty of the human mind no lascivious thoughts\r\nneed to control the passions. A pure heart will develop pure thoughts and\r\nbring out a good life.\r\n\r\n3. RIOTING IN VISIONS.--Dr. Lewis says: \"Rioting in visions of nude women\r\nmay exhaust one as much as an excess in actual intercourse. There are\r\nmultitudes who would never spend the night with an abandoned female, but\r\nwho rarely meet a young girl that their imaginations are not busy with her\r\nperson. This species of indulgence is well-nigh universal; and it is the\r\nsource of all other forms--the fountain from which the external vices\r\nspring, and the nursery of masturbation.\"\r\n\r\n4. COMMITTING ADULTERY IN THE HEART.--A young man who allows his mind to\r\ndwell upon the vision of nude women will soon become a victim of ruinous\r\npassion, and either fall under the influence of lewd women or resort to\r\nself-abuse. The man who has no control over his mind and allows impure\r\nthoughts to be associated with the name of every female that may be\r\nsuggested to his mind, is but committing adultery in his heart, just as\r\nguilty at heart as though he had committed the deed.\r\n\r\n5. UNCHASTITY.--So far as the record is preserved, unchastity has\r\ncontributed above all other causes, more to the ruin and exhaustion and\r\ndemoralization of the race than all other wickedness. And we shall not be\r\nlikely to vanquish the monster, even in ourselves, unless we make the\r\nthoughts our point of attack. So long as they are sensual we are indulging\r\nin sexual abuse, and are almost sure, when temptation is presented, to\r\ncommit the overt acts of sin. If we cannot succeed within, we may pray in\r\nvain for help to resist the tempter outwardly. A young man who will indulge\r\nin obscene language will be guilty of a worse deed if opportunity is\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n6. BAD DRESSING.--If women knew how much mischief they do men they would\r\nchange some of their habits of {410} dress. The dress of their busts, the\r\npadding in different parts, are so contrived as to call away attention from\r\nthe soul and fix it on the bosom and hips. And then, many, even educated\r\nwomen, are careful to avoid serious subjects in our presence--one minute\r\nbefore a gentleman enters the room they may be engaged in thoughtful\r\ndiscussion, but the moment he appears their whole style changes; they\r\nassume light fascinating ways, laugh sweet little bits of laughs, and turn\r\ntheir heads this way and that, all which forbids serious thinking and gives\r\nmen over to imagination.\r\n\r\n7. THE LUSTFUL EYE.--How many men there are who lecherously stare at every\r\nwoman in whose presence they happen to be. These monsters stare at women as\r\nthough they were naked in a cage on exhibition. A man whose whole manner is\r\nfull of animal passion is not worthy of the respect of refined women. They\r\nhave no thoughts, no ideas, no sentiments, nothing to interest them but the\r\nbodies of women whom they behold. The moral character of young women has no\r\nsignificance or weight in their eyes. This kind of men are a curse to\r\nsociety and a danger to the community. No young lady is safe in their\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n8. REBUKING SENSUALISM.--If the young women would exercise an honorable\r\nindependence and heap contempt upon the young men that allow their\r\nimagination to take such liberties, a different state of things would soon\r\nfollow. Men of that type of character should have no recognition in the\r\npresence of ladies.\r\n\r\n9. EARLY MARRIAGES.--There can be no doubt that early marriages are bad for\r\nboth parties. For children of such a marriage always lack vitality. The\r\nancient Germans did not marry until the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth year,\r\nprevious to which they observed the most rigid chastity, and in consequence\r\nthey acquired a size and strength that excited the astonishment of Europe.\r\nThe present incomparable vigor of that race, both physically and mentally,\r\nis due in a great measure to their long established aversion to marrying\r\nyoung. The results of too early marriages are in brief, stunted growth and\r\nimpaired strength on the part of the male; delicate if not utterly bad\r\nhealth in the female; the premature old age or death of one or both, and a\r\npuny, sickly offspring.\r\n\r\n10. SIGNS OF EXCESSES.--Dr. Dio Lewis says: \"Some of the most common\r\neffects of sexual excess are backache, lassitude, giddiness, dimness of\r\nsight, noises in the ears, numbness of the fingers, and paralysis. The\r\ndrain is universal, but the more sensitive organs and tissues suffer {411}\r\nmost. So the nervous system gives way and continues the principal sufferer\r\nthroughout. A large part of the premature loss of sight and hearing,\r\ndizziness, numbness and pricking in the hands and feet, and other kindred\r\ndevelopments, are justly chargeable to unbridled venery. Not unfrequently\r\nyou see men whose head or back or nerve testifies of such reckless\r\nexpenditure.\"\r\n\r\n11. NON-COMPLETED INTERCOURSE.--Withdrawal before the emission occurs is\r\ninjurious to both parties. The soiling of the conjugal bed by the shameful\r\nmanoeuvres is to be deplored.\r\n\r\n12. THE EXTENT OF THE PRACTICE.--One cannot tell to what extent this vice\r\nis practiced, except by observing its consequences, even among people who\r\nfear to commit the slightest sin, to such a degree is the public conscience\r\nperverted upon this point. Still, many husbands know that nature often\r\nrenders nugatory the most subtle calculations, and reconquers the rights\r\nwhich they have striven to frustrate. No matter; they persevere none the\r\nless, and by the force of habit they poison the most blissful moments of\r\nlife, with no surety of averting the result that they fear. So who knows if\r\nthe too often feeble and weakened infants are not the fruit of these in\r\nthemselves incomplete procreations, and disturbed by preoccupations foreign\r\nto the natural act.\r\n\r\n13. HEALTH OF WOMEN.--Furthermore, the moral relations existing between the\r\nmarried couple undergo unfortunate changes; this affection, founded upon\r\nreciprocal esteem, is little by little effaced by the repetition of an act\r\nwhich pollutes the marriage bed. If the good harmony of families and the\r\nreciprocal relations are seriously menaced by the invasion of these\r\ndetestable practices, the health of women, as we have already intimated, is\r\nfearfully injured.\r\n\r\n14. THE PRACTICE OF ABORTION.--Then we have the practice of abortion\r\nreduced in modern times to a science, and almost to a distinct profession.\r\nA large part of the business is carried on by the means of medicines\r\nadvertised in obscure but intelligible terms as embryo-destroyers or\r\npreventives of conception. Every large city has its professional\r\nabortionist. Many ordinary physicians destroy embryos to order, and the\r\nskill to do this terrible deed has even descended among the common people.\r\n\r\n15. SEXUAL EXHAUSTION.--Every sexual excitement is exhaustive in proportion\r\nto its intensity and continuance. If a man sits by the side of a woman,\r\nfondles and kisses her three or four hours, and allows his imagination to\r\nrun riot with sexual visions, he will be five times as much exhausted {412}\r\nas he would by the act culminating in emission. It is the sexual excitement\r\nmore than the emission which exhausts. As shown in another part of this\r\nwork, thoughts of sexual intimacies, long continued, lead to the worst\r\neffects. To a man, whose imagination is filled with erotic fancies the\r\nemission comes as a merciful interruption to the burning, harassing and\r\nwearing excitement which so constantly goads him.\r\n\r\n16. THE DESIRE OF GOOD.--The desire of good for its own sake--this is Love.\r\nThe desire of good for bodily pleasure--this is Lust. Man is a moral being,\r\nand as such should always act in the animal sphere according to the\r\nspiritual law. Hence, to break the law of the highest creative action for\r\nthe mere gratification of animal instinct is to perform the act of sin and\r\nto produce the corruption of nature.\r\n\r\n17. CAUSE OF PROSTITUTION.--Dr. Dio Lewis says: \"Occasionally we meet a\r\ndiseased female with excessive animal passion, but such a case is very\r\nrare. The average woman has so little sexual desire that if licentiousness\r\ndepended upon her, uninfluenced by her desire to please man or secure his\r\nsupport, there would be very little sexual excess. Man is strong--he has\r\nall the money and all the facilities for business and pleasure; and woman\r\nis not long in learning the road to his favor. Many prostitutes who take no\r\npleasure in their unclean intimacies not only endure a disgusting life for\r\nthe favor and means thus gained, but affect intense passion in their sexual\r\ncontacts because they have learned that such exhibitions gratify men.\"\r\n\r\n18. HUSBAND'S BRUTALITY.--Husbands! It is your licentiousness that drives\r\nyour wives to a deed so abhorrent to their every wifely, womanly and\r\nmaternal instinct--a deed which ruins the health of their bodies,\r\nprostitutes their souls, and makes marriage, maternity and womanhood itself\r\ndegrading and loathsome. No terms can sufficiently characterize the\r\ncruelty, meanness and disgusting selfishness of your conduct when you\r\nimpose on them a maternity so detested as to drive them to the desperation\r\nof killing their unborn children and often themselves.\r\n\r\n19. WHAT DRUNKARDS BEQUEATH TO THEIR OFFSPRING.--Organic imperfections\r\nunfit the brain for sane action, and habit confirms the insane condition;\r\nthe man's brain has become unsound. Then comes in the law of hereditary\r\ndescent, by which the brain of a man's children is fashioned after his\r\nown--not as it was originally, but as it has become, in consequence of\r\nfrequent functional disturbance. Hence, of all appetites, the inherited\r\nappetite for drunkenness is {413} the most direful. Natural laws\r\ncontemplate no exceptions, and sins against them are never pardoned.\r\n\r\n20. THE REPORTS OF HOSPITALS.--The reports of hospitals for lunatics almost\r\nuniversally assign intemperance as one of the causes which predispose a\r\nman's offspring to insanity. This is even more strikingly manifested in the\r\ncase of congenital idiocy. They come generally from a class of families\r\nwhich seem to have degenerated physically to a low degree. They are puny\r\nand sickly.\r\n\r\n21. SECRET DISEASES.--See the weakly, sickly and diseased children who are\r\nborn only to suffer and die, all because of the private disease of the\r\nfather before his marriage. Oh, let the truth be told that the young men of\r\nour land may learn the lessons of purity of life. Let them learn that in\r\nmorality there is perfect protection and happiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GETTING A DIVORCE]\r\n\r\n{414}\r\n\r\nPhysical and Moral Degeneracy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEGENERATE TURK.]\r\n\r\n1. MORAL PRINCIPLE.--\"Edgar Allen Poe, Lord Byron, and Robert Burns,\" says\r\nDr. Geo. F. Hall, \"were men of marvelous strength intellectually. But\r\nmeasured by the true rule of high moral principle, they were very weak.\r\nSuperior endowment in a single direction--physical, mental, or\r\nspiritual--is not of itself sufficient to make one strong in all that that\r\nheroic word means.\r\n\r\n2. INSANE ASYLUM.--Many a good man spiritually has gone to an untimely\r\ngrave because of impaired physical powers. Many a good man spiritually has\r\ngone to the insane asylum because of bodily and mental weaknesses. Many a\r\ngood man spiritually has fallen from virtue in an evil moment because of a\r\nweakened will, or, a too demanding fleshly passion, or, worse than either,\r\ntoo lax views on the subject of personal chastity.\"\r\n\r\n3. BOYS LEARNING VICES.--Some ignorant and timid people argue that boys and\r\nyoung men in reading a work of this character will learn vices concerning\r\nwhich they had {415} never so much as dreamed of before. This is, however,\r\ncertain, that vices cannot be condemned unless they are mentioned; and if\r\nthe condemnation is strong enough it surely will be a source of strength\r\nand of security. If light and education, on these important subjects, does\r\ninjury, then all knowledge likewise must do more wrong than good. Knowledge\r\nis power, and the only hope of the race is enlightenment on all subjects\r\npertaining to their being.\r\n\r\n4. MORAL MANHOOD.--It is clearly visible that the American manhood is\r\nrotting down--decaying at the center. The present generation shows many men\r\nof a small body and weak principles, and men and women of this kind are\r\nbecoming more and more prevalent. Dissipation and indiscretions of all kind\r\nare working ruin. Purity of life and temperate habits are being too\r\ngenerally disregarded.\r\n\r\n5. YOUNG WOMEN.--The vast majority of graduates from the schools and\r\ncolleges of our land to-day, and two-thirds of the membership of our\r\nchurches, and three-fourths of the charitable workers, are females.\r\nEverywhere girls are carrying off most of the prizes in competitive\r\nexaminations, because women, as a sex, naturally maintain a better\r\ncharacter, take better care of their bodies, and are less addicted to bad\r\nand injurious habits. While all this is true in reference to females, you\r\nwill find that the male sex furnishes almost the entire number of\r\ncriminals. The saloons, gambling dens, the brothels, and bad literature are\r\ndrawing down all that the public schools can build up. Seventy per cent. of\r\nthe young men of this land do not darken the church door. They are not\r\ninterested in moral improvement or moral education. Eighty-five per cent.\r\nleave school under 15 years of age; prefer the loafer's honors to the\r\nbenefit of school.\r\n\r\n6. PROMOTION.--The world is full of good places for good young men, and all\r\nthe positions of trust now occupied by the present generation will soon be\r\nfilled by the competent young men of the coming generation; and he that\r\nkeeps his record clean, lives a pure life, and avoids excesses or\r\ndissipations of all kinds, and fortifies his life with good habits, is the\r\nyoung man who will be heard from, and a thousand places will be open for\r\nhis services.\r\n\r\n7. PERSONAL PURITY.--Dr. George F. Hall says: \"Why not pay careful\r\nattention to man in all his elements of strength, physical, mental, and\r\nmoral? Why not make personal purity a fixed principle in the manhood of the\r\npresent and coming generations, and thus insure the best men the world has\r\never seen? It can be done. Let every reader of these lines resolve that he\r\nwill be one to help do it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{416}\r\n\r\nImmorality, Disease and Death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles Dickens' Chair and Desk.]\r\n\r\n1. THE POLICY OF SILENCE.--There is no greater delusion than to suppose\r\nthat vast number of boys know nothing about practices of sin. Some parents\r\nare afraid that unclean thoughts may be suggested by these very defences.\r\nThe danger is slight. Such cases are barely possible, but when the untold\r\nthousands are thought of on the other side, who have been demoralized from\r\nchildhood through ignorance, and who are to-day suffering the result of\r\nthese vicious practices, the policy of silence stands condemned, and\r\nintelligent knowledge abundantly justified. The emphatic words of Scripture\r\nare true in this respect also, \"The people are destroyed for lack of\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\n2. LIVING ILLUSTRATIONS.--Without fear of truthful contradiction we affirm\r\nthat the homes, public assemblies, and streets of all our large cities\r\nabound to-day with living illustrations and proofs of the widespread\r\nexistence of this physical and moral scourge. An enervated and stunted\r\nmanhood, a badly developed physique, a marked absence of manly and womanly\r\nstrength and beauty, are painfully common everywhere. Boys and girls, young\r\nmen and women, exist by thousands, of whom it may be said, they were badly\r\nborn and ill-developed. Many of these are, to some extent, bearing the\r\npenalty of the sins and excesses of their parents, especially their\r\nfathers, whilst the great majority are reaping the fruits of their own\r\nimmorality in a dwarfed and ill-formed body, and effeminate appearance,\r\nweak and enervated mind. {417}\r\n\r\n3. EFFEMINATE AND SICKLY YOUNG MEN.--The purposeless and aimless life of\r\nany number of effeminate and sickly young men, is to be distinctly\r\nattributed to these sins. The large class of mentally impotent\r\n\"ne'er-do-wells\" are being constantly recruited and added to by those who\r\npractice what the celebrated Erichson calls \"that hideous sin engendered by\r\nvice, and practiced in solitude\"--the sin, be it observed, which is the\r\ncommon cause of physical and mental weakness, and of the fearfully\r\nimpoverishing night-emissions, or as they are commonly called,\r\n\"wet-dreams.\"\r\n\r\n4. WEAKNESS, DISEASE, DEFORMITY, AND DEATH.--Through self-pollution and\r\nfornication the land is being corrupted with weakness, disease, deformity,\r\nand death. We regret to say that we cannot speak with confidence concerning\r\nthe moral character of the Jew; but we have people amongst us who have\r\ndeservedly a high character for the tone of their moral life--we refer to\r\nthe members of the Society of Friends. The average of life amongst these\r\nreaches no less than fifty-six years; and, whilst some allowance must be\r\nmade for the fact that amongst the Friends the poor have not a large\r\nrepresentation, these figures show conclusively the soundness of this\r\nposition,\r\n\r\n5. SOWING THEIR WILD OATS.--It is monstrous to suppose that healthy\r\nchildren should die just as they are coming to manhood. The fact that\r\nthousands of young people do reach the age of sixteen or eighteen, and then\r\ndecline and die, should arouse parents to ask the question: Why? Certainly\r\nit would not be difficult to tell the reason in thousands of instances, and\r\nyet the habit and practice of the deadly sin of self-pollution is actually\r\nignored; it is even spoken of as a boyish folly not to be mentioned, and\r\nyoung men literally burning up with lust are mildly spoken of as \"sowing\r\ntheir wild oats.\" Thus the cemetery is being filled with masses of the\r\nyouth of America who, as in Egypt of old, fill up the graves of uncleanness\r\nand lust. Some time since a prominent Christian man was taking exception to\r\nmy addressing men on this subject; observe this! one of his own sons was at\r\nthat very time near the lunatic asylum through these disgusting sins. What\r\nfolly and madness this is!\r\n\r\n6. DEATH TO TRUE MANHOOD.--The question for each one is, \"In what way are\r\nyou going to divert the courses of the streams of energy which pertain to\r\nyouthful vigor and manhood?\" To be destitute of that which may be described\r\nas raw material in the human frame, means that no really vigorous manhood\r\ncan have place; to burn up the juices of the system in the fires of lust is\r\nmadness and wanton folly, {418} but it can be done. To divert the currents\r\nof life and energy from blood and brain, from memory and muscle, in order\r\nto secrete it for the shambles of prostitution, is death to true manhood;\r\nbut remember, it can be done! The generous liquid life may inspire the\r\nbrain and blood with noble impulse and vital force, or it may be sinned\r\naway and drained out of the system until the jaded brain, the faded cheek,\r\nthe enervated young manhood, the gray hair, narrow chest, weak voice, and\r\nthe enfeebled mind show another victim in the long catalogue of the\r\ndegraded through lust.\r\n\r\n7. THE SISTERHOOD OF SHAME AND DEATH.--Whenever we pass the sisterhood of\r\ndeath, and hear the undertone of song, which is one of the harlot's methods\r\nof advertising, let us recall the words, that these represent the\r\n\"pestilence which walketh in darkness, the destruction that wasteth at\r\nnoonday.\" The allusion, of course, is to the fact that the great majority\r\nof these harlots are full of loathsome physical and moral disease; with the\r\nface and form of an angel, these women \"bite like a serpent and sting like\r\nan adder;\" their traffic is not for life, but inevitably for shame,\r\ndisease, and death. Betrayed and seduced themselves, they in their turn\r\nbetray and curse others.\r\n\r\n8. WARNING OTHERS.--Have you never been struck with the argument of the\r\nApostle, who, warning others from the corrupt example of the fleshy Esau,\r\nsaid, \"Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who for one\r\nmess of meat sold his own birthright. For ye know that even afterward, when\r\nhe desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, he found no place for\r\nrepentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.\" Terrible and\r\nstriking words are these. His birthright sold for a mess of meat. The\r\nfearful costs of sin--yes, that is the thought, particularly the sin of\r\nfornication! Engrave that word upon your memories and hearts--\"One mess of\r\nmeat.\"\r\n\r\n9. THE HARLOT'S MESS OF MEAT.--Remember it, young men, when you are tempted\r\nto this sin. For a few minutes' sensual pleasure, for a mess of harlot's\r\nmeat, young men are paying out the love of the son and brother; they are\r\ndeceiving, lying, and cheating for a mess of meat; for a mess, not seldom\r\nof putrid flesh, men have paid down purity and prayer, manliness and\r\ngodliness; for a mess of meat some perhaps have donned their best attire,\r\nand assumed the manners of the gentleman, and then, like an infernal\r\nhypocrite, dogged the steps of maiden or harlot to satisfy their degrading\r\nlust; for a mess of meat young men have deceived father and mother, and\r\nshrunk from the embrace of {419} love of the pure-minded sister. For the\r\nharlot's mess of meat some listening to me have spent scores of hours of\r\ninvaluable time. They have wearied the body, diseased and demoralized the\r\nmind. The pocket has been emptied, theft committed, lies unnumbered told,\r\nto play the part of the harlot's mate--perchance a six-foot fool, dragged\r\ninto the filth and mire of the harlot's house. You called her your friend,\r\nwhen, but for her mess of meat, you would have passed her like dirt in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n10. SEEING LIFE.--You consorted with her for your mutual shame and death,\r\nand then called it \"seeing life.\" Had your mother met you, you would have\r\nshrunk away like a craven cur. Had your sister interviewed you, she had\r\nblushed to bear your name; or had she been seen by you in company with some\r\nother whoremaster, for similar commerce, you would have wished that she had\r\nbeen dead. Now what think you of this \"seeing life?\" And it is for this\r\nthat tens of thousands of strong men in our large cities are selling their\r\nbirthright.\r\n\r\n11. THE DEVIL'S DECOYS.--Some may be ready to affirm that physical and\r\nmoral penalties do not appear to overtake all men; that many men known to\r\nbe given to intemperance and sensuality are strong, well, and live to a\r\ngood age. Let us not make any mistake concerning these; they are exceptions\r\nto the rule; the appearance of health in them is but the grossness of\r\nsensuality. You have only carefully to look into the faces of these men to\r\nsee that their countenances, eyes, and speech betray them. They are simply\r\nthe devil's decoys.\r\n\r\n12. GROSSNESS OF SENSUALITY.--The poor degraded harlot draws in the victims\r\nlike a heavily charged lodestone; these men are found in large numbers\r\nthroughout the entire community; they would make fine men were they not\r\nweighted with the grossness of sensuality; as it is, they frequent the\r\nrace-course, the card-table, the drinking-saloon, the music-hall, and the\r\nlow theaters, which abound in our cities and towns; the great majority of\r\nthese are men of means and leisure. Idleness is their curse, their\r\nopportunity for sin; you may know them as the loungers over\r\nrefreshment-bars, as the retailers of the latest filthy joke, or as the\r\nvendors of some disgusting scandal; indeed, it is appalling the number of\r\nthese lepers found both in our business and social circles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{421}\r\n\r\nPoisonous Literature and Bad Pictures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALESTINE WATER CARRIERS.]\r\n\r\n1. OBSCENE LITERATURE.--No other source contributes so much to sexual\r\nimmorality as obscene literature. The mass of stories published in the\r\ngreat weeklies and the cheap novels are mischievous. When the devil\r\ndetermines to take charge of a young soul, he often employs a very\r\ningenious method. He slyly hands a little novel filled with \"voluptuous\r\nforms,\" \"reclining on bosoms,\" \"languishing eyes,\" etc.\r\n\r\n2. MORAL FORCES.--The world is full of such literature. It is easily\r\naccessible, for it is cheap, and the young will procure it, and therefore\r\nbecome easy prey to its baneful influence and effects. It weakens the moral\r\nforces of the young, and they thereby fall an easy prey before the subtle\r\nschemes of the libertine.\r\n\r\n3. BAD BOOKS.--Bad books play not a small part in the corruption of the\r\nyouth. A bad book is as bad as an evil companion. In some respects it is\r\neven worse than a living teacher of vice, since it may cling to an\r\nindividual at all times. It will follow him and poison his mind with the\r\nvenom of evil. The influence of bad books in making bad boys and men is\r\nlittle appreciated. Few are aware how much evil seed is being sown among\r\nthe young everywhere through the medium of vile books.\r\n\r\n4. SENSATIONAL STORY BOOKS.--Much of the evil literature which is sold in\r\nnickel and dime novels, and which constitutes the principal part of the\r\ncontents of such papers as the \"Police Gazette,\" the \"Police News,\" and a\r\nlarge proportion of the sensational story books which flood the land. You\r\nmight better place a coal of fire or a live viper in your bosom, than allow\r\nyourself to read such a book. The thoughts that are implanted in the mind\r\nin youth will often stick there through life, in spite of all efforts to\r\ndislodge them.\r\n\r\n5. PAPERS AND MAGAZINES.--Many of the papers and magazines sold at our news\r\nstands, and eagerly sought after by young men and boys, are better suited\r\nfor the parlors of a house of ill-fame than for the eyes of pure-minded\r\nyouth. A newsdealer who will distribute such vile sheets ought to be dealt\r\nwith as an educator in vice and crime, an agent of evil, and a recruiting\r\nofficer of hell and perdition.\r\n\r\n6. SENTIMENTAL LITERATURE OF LOW FICTION.--Sentimental literature, whether\r\nimpure in its subject matter or not, has {422} a direct tendency in the\r\ndirection of impurity. The stimulation of the emotional nature, the\r\ninstilling of sentimental ideas into the minds of the young, has a tendency\r\nto turn the thoughts into a channel which leads in the direction of the\r\nformation of vicious habits.\r\n\r\n7. IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY READING QUESTIONABLE LITERATURE.--It is painful to\r\nsee strong intelligent men and youths reading bad books, or feasting their\r\neyes on filthy pictures, for the practice is sure to affect their personal\r\npurity. Impressions will be left which cannot fail to breed a legion of\r\nimpure thoughts, and in many instances criminal deeds. Thousands of\r\nelevator boys, clerks, students, traveling men, and others, patronize the\r\nquestionable literature counter to an alarming extent.\r\n\r\n8. THE NUDE IN ART.--For years there has been a great craze after the nude\r\nin art, and the realistic in literature. Many art galleries abound in\r\npictures and statuary which cannot fail to fan the fires of sensualism,\r\nunless the thoughts of the visitor are trained to the strictest purity. Why\r\nshould artists and sculptors persist in shocking the finer sensibilities of\r\nold and young of both sexes by crowding upon their view representations of\r\nnaked human forms in attitudes of luxurious abandon? Public taste may\r\ndemand it. But let those who have the power endeavor to reform public\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n9. WIDELY DIFFUSED.--Good men have ever lamented the pernicious influence\r\nof a depraved and perverted literature. But such literature has never been\r\nso systematically and widely diffused as at the present time. This is owing\r\nto two causes, its cheapness and the facility of conveyance.\r\n\r\n10. INFLAME THE PASSIONS.--A very large proportion of the works thus put in\r\ncirculation are of the worst character, tending to corrupt the principles,\r\nto inflame the passions, to excite impure desire, and spread a blight over\r\nall the powers of the soul. Brothels are recruited from this more than any\r\nother source. Those who search the trunks of convicted criminals are almost\r\nsure to find in them one or more of these works; and few prisoners who can\r\nread at all fail to enumerate among the causes which led them into crime\r\nthe unhealthy stimulus of this depraved and poisonous literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{423}\r\n\r\nStartling Sins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. NAMELESS CRIMES.--The nameless crimes identified with the hushed-up\r\nSodomite cases; the revolting condition of the school of Sodomy; the\r\nrevelations of the Divorce Court concerning the condition of what is called\r\nnational nobility, and upper classes, as well as the unclean spirit which\r\nattaches to \"society papers,\" has revealed a condition which is perfectly\r\ndisgusting.\r\n\r\n2. UNFAITHFULNESS.--Unfaithfulness amongst husbands and wives in the upper\r\nclasses is common and adultery rife everywhere; mistresses are kept in all\r\ndirections; thousands of these rich men have at least two, and not seldom\r\nthree establishments.\r\n\r\n3. A FRIGHTFUL INCREASE.--Facts which have come to light during the past\r\nten years show a frightful increase in every form of licentiousness; the\r\nwidely extended area over which whoredom and degrading lust have thrown the\r\nglamor of their fascinating toils is simply appalling. {424}\r\n\r\n4. MORAL CARNAGE.--We speak against the fearful moral carnage; would to God\r\nthat some unmistakable manifestation of the wrath of God should come in and\r\nput a stop to this huge seed-plot of national demoralization! We are\r\nreaping in this disgusting centre the harvest of corruption which has come\r\nfrom the toleration and encouragements given by the legislature, the\r\npolice, and the magistrates to immorality, vice, and sin; the awful fact\r\nis, that we are in the midst of the foul and foetid harvest of lust. Aided\r\nby some of the most exalted personages in the land, assisted by thousands\r\nof educated and wealthy whoremongers and adulterers, we are reaping also,\r\nin individual physical ugliness and deformity, that which has been sown;\r\nthe puny, ill-formed and mentally weak youths and maidens, men and women,\r\nto be seen in large numbers in our principal towns and cities, represent\r\nthe widespread nature of the curse which has, in a marked manner, impaired\r\nthe physique, the morality, and the intelligence of the nation.\r\n\r\n5. DAILY PRESS.--The daily press has not had the moral courage to say one\r\nword; the quality of demoralizing novels such as have been produced from\r\nthe impure brain and unclean imaginations; the subtle, clever, and\r\nfascinating undermining of the white-winged angel of purity by modern\r\nsophists, whose prurient and vicious volumes were written to throw a halo\r\nof charm and beauty about the brilliant courtesan and the splendid\r\nadulteress; the mixing up of lust and love; the making of corrupt passion\r\nto stand in the garb of a deep, lasting, and holy affection--these are some\r\nof the hideous seedlings which, hidden amid the glamor and fascination of\r\nthe seeming \"angel of light,\" have to so large an extent corrupted the\r\nmorality of the country.\r\n\r\n6. NIGHTLY EXHIBITIONS.--Some of you know what the nightly exhibitions in\r\nthese garlanded temples of whorish incentive are. There is the variety\r\ntheatre, with its disgusting ballet dancing, and its shamelessly indecent\r\nphotographs exhibited in every direction. What a clear gain to morality it\r\nwould be if the accursed houses were burnt down, and forbidden by law ever\r\nto be re-built or re-opened; the whole scene is designed to act upon and\r\nstimulate the lusts and evil passions of corrupt men and women.\r\n\r\n7. CONFIDENCE AND EXPOSURE.--I hear some of you say, cannot some influence\r\nbe brought to bear upon this plague-spot? Will the legislature or congress\r\ndo nothing? Is the law and moral right to continue to be trodden under\r\nfoot? Are the magistrates and the police powerless? The truth is the\r\nharlots and whoremongers are master of the situation; the moral sense of\r\nthe legislators, the magistrates, and the {425} police is so low that\r\nanything like confidence is at present out of the question.\r\n\r\n8. THE SISTERHOOD OF SHAME AND DEATH.--It is enough to make angels weep to\r\nsee a great mass of America's wealthy and better-class sons full of zeal\r\nand on fire with interest in the surging hundreds of the sisterhood of\r\nshame and death. Many of these men act as if they were--if they do not\r\nbelieve they are--dogs. No poor hunted dog in the streets was ever tracked\r\nby a yelping crowd of curs more than is the fresh girl or chance of a maid\r\nin the accursed streets of our large cities. Price is no object, nor\r\nparentage, nor home; it is the truth to affirm that hundreds and thousands\r\nof well-dressed and educated men come in order to the gratification of\r\ntheir lusts, and to this end they frequent this whole district; they have\r\nreached this stage, they are being burned up in this fire of lust; men of\r\nwhom God says, \"Having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease sin.\"\r\n\r\n9. LAW MAKERS.--Now should any member of the legislature rise up and\r\ntestify against this \"earthly hell,\" and speak in defence of the moral\r\nmanhood and womanhood of the nation, he would be greeted as a fanatic, and\r\nlaughed down amid derisive cheers; such has been the experience again and\r\nagain. Therefore attack this great stronghold which for the past thirty\r\nyears has warred and is warring against our social manhood and womanhood,\r\nand constantly undermining the moral life of the nation; against this\r\ncitadel of licentiousness, this metropolitan centre of crime, and vice, and\r\nsin, direct your full blast of righteous and manly indignation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n10. TEMPLES OF LUST.--Here stand the foul and splendid temples of lust,\r\nintemperance, and passion, into whose vortex tens of thousands of our sons\r\nand daughters are constantly being drawn. Let it be remembered that this\r\nwhole area represents the most costly conditions, and proves beyond\r\nquestion that an enormous proportion of the wealthy manhood of the nation,\r\nand we as citizens sustain, partake, and share in this carnival of death.\r\nIs it any wonder that the robust type of godly manhood which used to be\r\nfound in the legislature, is sadly wanting now, or that the wretched\r\ncaricatures of manhood which find form and place in such papers as \"Truth\"\r\nand the \"World\" are accepted as representing \"modern society?\"\r\n\r\n11. PURITANIC MANHOOD.--It is a melancholy fact that by reason of\r\nuncleanness, we have almost lost regard for the type of puritanic manhood\r\nwhich in the past held aloft the standard of a chaste and holy life; such\r\nmen in this day are spoken of as \"too slow\" as \"weak-kneed,\" and {426}\r\n\"goody-goody\" men. Let me recall that word, the fast and indecently-dressed\r\n\"things,\" the animals of easy virtue, the \"respectable\" courtesans that\r\nflirt, chaff, gamble, and waltz with well-known high-class licentious\r\nlepers--such is the ideal of womanhood which a large proportion of our\r\nlarge city society accepts, fawns upon, and favors.\r\n\r\n12. SHAMEFUL CONDITIONS.--Perhaps one of the most inhuman and shameful\r\nconditions of modern fashionable society, both in England and America, is\r\nthat which wealthy men and women who are married destroy their own children\r\nin the embryo stage of being, and become murderers thereby. This is done to\r\nprevent what should be one of our chief glories, viz., large and\r\nwell-developed home and family life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{427}\r\n\r\nThe Prostitution of Men.\r\n\r\nCAUSE AND REMEDY.\r\n\r\n1. EXPOSED YOUTH.--Generally even in the beginning of the period when\r\nsexual uneasiness begins to show itself in the boy, he is exposed in\r\nschools, institutes, and elsewhere to the temptations of secret vice, which\r\nis transmitted from youth to youth, like a contagious corruption, and which\r\nin thousands destroys the first germs of virility. Countless numbers of\r\nboys are addicted to these vices for years. That they do not in the\r\nbeginning of nascent puberty proceed to sexual intercourse with women, is\r\ngenerally due to youthful timidity, which dares not reveal its desire, or\r\nfrom want of experience for finding opportunities. The desire is there, for\r\nthe heart is already corrupted.\r\n\r\n2. BOYHOOD TIMIDITY OVERCOME.--Too often a common boy's timidity is\r\novercome by chance or by seduction, which is rarely lacking in great cities\r\nwhere prostitution is flourishing, and thus numbers of boys immediately\r\nafter the transition period of youth, in accordance with the previous\r\nsecret practice, accustom themselves to the association with prostitute\r\nwomen, and there young manhood and morals are soon lost forever.\r\n\r\n3. MARRIAGE-BED RESOLUTIONS.--Most men of the educated classes enter the\r\nmarriage-bed with the consciousness of leaving behind them a whole army of\r\nprostitutes or seduced women, in whose arms they cooled their passions and\r\nspent the vigor of their youth. But with such a past the married man does\r\nnot at the same time leave behind him its influence on his inclinations.\r\nThe habit of having a feminine being at his disposal for every rising\r\nappetite, and the desire for change inordinately indulged for years,\r\ngenerally make themselves felt again as soon as the honeymoon is over.\r\nMarriage will not make a morally corrupt man all at once a good man and a\r\nmodel husband.\r\n\r\n4. THE INJUSTICE OF MAN.--Now, although many men are in a certain sense\r\n\"not worthy to unloose the latchet of the shoes\" of the commonest woman,\r\nmuch less to \"unfasten her girdle,\" yet they make the most extravagant\r\ndemands on the feminine sex. Even the greatest debauchee, who has spent his\r\nvigor in the arms of a hundred courtesans, will cry out fraud and treachery\r\nif he does not receive his newly married bride as an untouched virgin. Even\r\nthe most dissolute husband will look on his wife as deserving of death if\r\nhis daily infidelity is only once reciprocated. {428}\r\n\r\n5. UNJUST DEMANDS.--The greater the injustice a husband does to his wife,\r\nthe less he is willing to submit to from her; the oftener he becomes\r\nunfaithful to her, the stricter he is in demanding faithfulness from her.\r\nWe see that despotism nowhere denies its own nature: the more a despot\r\ndeceives and abuses his people, the more submissiveness and faithfulness he\r\ndemands of them.\r\n\r\n6. SUFFERING WOMEN.--Who can be astonished at the many unhappy marriages,\r\nif he knows how unworthy most men are of their wives? Their virtues they\r\nrarely can appreciate, and their vices they generally call out by their\r\nown. Thousands of women suffer from the results of a mode of life of which\r\nthey, having remained pure in their thought, have no conception whatever;\r\nand many an unsuspecting wife nurses her husband with tenderest care in\r\nsicknesses which are nothing more than the consequences of his amours with\r\nother women.\r\n\r\n7. AN INHUMAN CRIMINAL.--When at last, after long years of delusion and\r\nendurance, the scales drop from the eyes of the wife, and revenge or\r\ndespair drives her into a hostile position towards her lord and master, she\r\nis an inhuman criminal, and the hue and cry against the fickleness of women\r\nand the falsity of their nature is endless. Oh, the injustice of society\r\nand the injustice of cruel man. Is there no relief for helpless women that\r\nare bound by the ties of marriage to men who are nothing but rotten\r\ncorruption?\r\n\r\n8. VULGAR DESIRE.--The habit of regarding the end and aim of woman only\r\nfrom the most vulgar side--not to respect in her the noble human being, but\r\nto see in her only the instrument of sensual desire--is carried so far\r\namong men that they will allow it to force into the background\r\nconsiderations among themselves, which they otherwise pretend to rank very\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n9. THE ONLY REMEDY.--But when the feeling of women has once been driven to\r\nindignation with respect to the position which they occupy, it is to be\r\nhoped that they will compel men to be pure before marriage, and they will\r\nremain loyal after marriage.\r\n\r\n10. WORSE THAN SAVAGES.--With all our civilization we are put to shame even\r\nby the savages. The savages know of no fastidiousness of the sexual\r\ninstinct and of no brothels. We are, indeed, likewise savages, but in quite\r\na different sense. Proof of this is especially furnished by our youth. But\r\nthat our students, and young men in general, usually pass through the\r\nschool of corruption and drag the filth of the road which they have\r\ntraversed before marriage along {429} with them throughout life, is not\r\ntheir fault so much as the fault of prejudices and of our political and\r\nsocial conditions that prohibits a proper education, and the placing of the\r\nright kind of literature on these subjects into the hands of young people.\r\n\r\n11. REASON AND REMEDY.--Keep the youth pure by a thorough system of plain\r\nunrestricted training. The seeds of immorality are sown in youth, and the\r\nsecret vice eats out their young manhood often before the age of puberty.\r\nThey develop a bad character as they grow older. Young girls are ruined,\r\nand licentiousness and prostitution flourish. Keep the boys pure and the\r\nharlot would soon lose her vocation. Elevate the morals of the boys, and\r\nyou will have pure men and moral husbands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{430}\r\n\r\nThe Road to Shame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUICIDE LAKE.]\r\n\r\n1. INSULT TO MOTHER OR SISTER.--Young men, it can never under any\r\ncircumstances be right for you to do to a woman that, which, if another man\r\ndid to your mother or sister, you could never forgive! The very thought is\r\nrevolting. Let us suppose a man guilty of this shameful sin, and I\r\napprehend that each of us would feel ready to shoot the villain. We are not\r\njustifying the shooting, but appealing to your instinctive sense of right,\r\nin order to show the enormity of this fearful crime, and to fasten strong\r\nconviction in your mind against this sin. {431}\r\n\r\n2. A RUINED SISTER.--What would you think of a man, no matter what his\r\nwealth, culture, or gentlemanly bearing, who should lay himself out for the\r\nseduction and shame of your beloved sister? Her very name now reminds you\r\nof the purest affection: think of her, if you can bear it, ruined in\r\ncharacter, and soon to become an unhappy mother. To whom can you introduce\r\nher? What can you say concerning her? How can her own brothers and sisters\r\nassociate with her? and, mark! all this personal and relative misery caused\r\nby this genteel villain's degrading passion.\r\n\r\n3. YOUNG MAN LOST.--Another terrible result of this sin is the practical\r\noverthrow of natural affection which it effects. A young man comes from his\r\nfather's house to Chicago. Either through his own lust or through the\r\ncorrupt companions that he finds in the house of business where he resides,\r\nhe becomes the companion of lewd women. The immediate result is a bad\r\nconscience, a sense of shame, and a breach in the affections of home.\r\nLetters are less frequent, careless, and brief. He cannot manifest true\r\nlove now. He begins to shrink from his sister and mother, and well he may.\r\n\r\n4. THE HARLOT'S INFLUENCE.--He has spent the strength of his affection and\r\nlove for home. In their stead the wretched harlot has filled him with\r\nunholy lust. His brain and heart refuse to yield him the love of the son\r\nand brother. His hand can not write as aforetime, or at best, his\r\nexpressions become a hypocritical pretence. Fallen into the degradation of\r\nthe fornicator, he has changed a mother's love and sister's affection for\r\nthe cursed fellowship of the woman \"whose house is the way to hell.\" (Prov.\r\nVII. 27.)\r\n\r\n5. THE WAY OF DEATH.--Observe, that directly the law of God is broken, and\r\nwherever promiscuous intercourse between the sexes takes place, gonorrhoea,\r\nsyphilis, and every other form of venereal disease is seen in hideous\r\nvariety. It is only true to say that thousands of both sexes are slain\r\nannually by these horrible diseases. What must be the moral enormity of a\r\nsin, which, when committed, produces in vast numbers of cases such\r\nfrightful physical and moral destruction as that which is here portrayed?\r\n\r\n6. A HARLOT'S WOES.--Would to God that something might be done to rescue\r\nfallen women from their low estate. We speak of them as \"fallen women\".\r\nFallen, indeed, they are, but surely not more deserving of the application\r\nof that term than the \"fallen men\" who are their partners and paramours. It\r\nis easy to use the words, \"a fallen woman\", but who can apprehend all that\r\nis involved in the {432} expression, seeing that every purpose for which\r\nGod created woman is prostituted and destroyed? She is now neither maiden,\r\nwife, nor mother; the sweet names of sister and betrothed can have no\r\nlegitimate application in her case.\r\n\r\n7. THE PENALTIES FOR LOST VIRTUE.--Can the harlot be welcomed where either\r\nchildren, brothers, sisters, wife, or husband are found? Surely, no. Home\r\nis a sphere alien to the harlot's estate. See such an one wherever you\r\nmay--she is a fallen outcast from woman's high estate. Her existence--for\r\nshe does not live--now culminates in one dread issue, viz., prostitution.\r\nShe sleeps, but awakes a harlot. She rises in the late morning hours, but\r\nher object is prostitution; she washes, dresses, and braids her hair, but\r\nit is with one foul purpose before her. To this end she eats, drinks, and\r\nis clothed. To this end her house is hidden and the blinds are drawn.\r\n\r\n8. LOST FOREVER.--To this end she applies the unnatural cosmetique, and\r\ncovers herself with sweet perfumes, which vainly try to hide her disease\r\nand shame. To this end she decks herself with dashing finery and tawdry\r\ntrappings, and with bold, unwomanly mien essays the streets of the great\r\ncity. To this end she is loud and coarse and impudent. To this end she is\r\nthe prostituted \"lady,\" with simpering words, and smiles, and glamour of\r\nrefined deceit. To this end an angel face, a devil in disguise. There is\r\none foul and ghastly purpose towards which all her energies now tend. So\r\nlow has she fallen, so lost is she to all the design of woman, that she\r\nexists for one foul purpose only, viz., to excite, stimulate, and gratify\r\nthe lusts of degraded, ungodly men. Verily, the word \"prostitute\" has an\r\nawful meaning. What plummet can sound the depths of a woman's fall who has\r\nbecome a harlot?\r\n\r\n9. SOUND THE ALARM.--Remember, young man, you can never rise above the\r\ndegradation of the companionship of lewd women. Your virtue once lost is\r\nlost forever. Remember, young woman, your wealth or riches is your good\r\nname and good character--you have nothing else. Give a man your virtue and\r\nhe will forsake you, and you will be forsaken by all the world. Remember\r\nthat purity of purpose brings nobility of character, and an honorable life\r\nis the joy and security of mankind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{433}\r\n\r\nThe Curse of Manhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT PHILANTHROPIST.]\r\n\r\n1. MORAL LEPERS.--We cannot but denounce in the strongest terms, the\r\nprofligacy of many married men. Not content with the moderation permitted\r\nin the divine appointed relationship of marriage, they become adulterers,\r\nin order to gratify their accursed lust. The man in them is trodden down by\r\nthe sensual beast which reigns supreme. These are the moral outlaws that\r\nmake light of this scandalous social iniquity, and by their damnable\r\nexample encourage young men to sin.\r\n\r\n2. A SAD CONDITION.--It is constantly affirmed by prostitutes, that amongst\r\nmarried men are found their chief supporters. Evidence from such a quarter\r\nmust be received with considerable caution. Nevertheless, we believe that\r\nthere is much truth in this statement. Here, again, we lay {434} the ax to\r\nthe root of the tree; the married man who dares affirm that there is a\r\nparticle of physical necessity for this sin, is a liar, and the truth is\r\nnot in him. Whether these men be princes, peers, legislators, professional\r\nmen, mechanics, or workmen, they are moral pests, a scandal to the social\r\nstate, and a curse to the nation.\r\n\r\n3. EXCESSES.--Many married men exhaust themselves by these excesses; they\r\nbecome irritable, liable to cold, to rheumatic affections, and nervous\r\ndepression. They find themselves weary when they rise in the morning.\r\nUnfitted for close application to business, they become dilatory and\r\ncareless, often lapsing into entire lack of energy, and not seldom into the\r\nlove of intoxicating stimulants. Numbers of husbands and wives entering\r\nupon these experiences lose the charm of health, the cheerfulness of life\r\nand converse. Home duties become irksome to the wife; the brightness,\r\nvivacity, and bloom natural to her earlier years, decline; she is spoken of\r\nas highly nervous, poorly, and weak, when the whole truth is that she is\r\nsuffering from physical exhaustion which she cannot bear. Her features\r\nbecome angular, her hair prematurely gray, she rapidly settles down into\r\nthe nervous invalid, constantly needing medical aid, and, if possible,\r\nchange of air.\r\n\r\n4. IGNORANCE.--These conditions are brought about in many cases through\r\nignorance on the part of those who are married. Multitudes of men have\r\nneither read, heard, nor known the truth of this question. We sympathize\r\nwith our fellow-men in this, that we have been left in practical ignorance\r\nconcerning the exceeding value and legitimate uses of these functions of\r\nour being. Some know, that, had they known these things in the early days\r\nof their married life, it would have proved to them knowledge of exceeding\r\nvalue. If this counsel is followed, thousands of homes will scarcely know\r\nthe need of the physician's presence.\r\n\r\n5. ANIMAL PASSION.--Common-sense teaches that children who are begotten in\r\nthe heat of animal passion, are likely to be licentious when they grow up.\r\nMany parents through excesses of eating and drinking, become inflamed with\r\nwine and strong drink., They are sensualists, and consequently, morally\r\ndiseased. Now, if in such conditions men beget their children, who can\r\naffect surprise if they develop licentious tendencies? Are not such parents\r\nlargely to blame? Are they not criminals in a high degree? Have they not\r\nfouled their own nest, and transmitted to their children predisposition to\r\nmoral evil?\r\n\r\n6. FAST YOUNG MEN.--Many of our \"fast young men\" have been thus corrupted,\r\neven as the children of the {435} intemperate are proved to have been.\r\nCertainly no one can deny that many of our \"well-bred\" young men are little\r\nbetter than \"high-class dogs\" so lawless are they, and ready for the arena\r\nof licentiousness.\r\n\r\n7. THE PURE-MINDED WIFE.--Happily, as tens of thousands of husbands can\r\ntestify, the pure-minded wife and mother is not carried away, as men are\r\nliable to be, with the force of animal passion. Were it not so, the\r\ntendencies to licentiousness in many sons would be stronger than they are.\r\nIn the vast majority of cases suggestion is never made except by the\r\nhusband, and it is a matter of deepest gratitude and consideration, that\r\nthe true wife may become a real helpmeet in restraining this desire in the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n8. YOUNG WIFE AND CHILDREN.--We often hear it stated that a young wife has\r\nher children quickly. This cannot happen to the majority of women without\r\ninjury to health and jeopardy to life. The law which rendered it imperative\r\nfor the land to lie fallow in order to rest and gain renewed strength, is\r\nonly another illustration of the unity which pervades physical conditions\r\neverywhere. It should be known that if a mother nurses her own babe, and\r\nthe child is not weaned until it is nine or ten months old, the mother,\r\nexcept in rare cases, will not become enceinte again, though cohabitation\r\nwith the husband takes place.\r\n\r\n9. SELFISH AND UNNATURAL CONDUCT.--It is natural and rational that a mother\r\nshould feed her own children; in the selfish and unnatural conduct of many\r\nmothers, who, to avoid the self-denial and patience which are required,\r\nhand the little one over to the wet-nurse, or to be brought up by hand, is\r\nfound in many cases the cause and reason of the unnatural haste of\r\nchild-bearing. Mothers need to be taught that the laws of nature cannot be\r\nbroken without penalty. For every woman whose health has been weakened\r\nthrough nursing her child, a hundred have lost strength and health through\r\nmarital excesses. The haste of having children is the costly penalty which\r\nwomen pay for shirking the mother's duty to the child.\r\n\r\n10. LAW OF GOD.--So graciously has the law of God been arranged in regard\r\nto the mother's strength, that, if it be obeyed, there will be, as a rule,\r\nan interval of at least from eighteen months to two years between the birth\r\nof one child and that of another. Every married man should abstain during\r\ncertain natural seasons. In this periodical recurrence God has instituted\r\nto every husband the law of restraint, and insisted upon self-control.\r\n\r\n11. TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE MARRIED.--Be exceedingly careful of license and\r\nexcess in your intercourse with {436} one another. Do not needlessly\r\nexpose, by undress, the body. Let not the purity of love degenerate into\r\nunholy lust. See to it that you walk according to the divine Word,\r\n\"Dwelling together as being heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers\r\nbe not hindered.\"\r\n\r\n12. LOST POWERS.--Many young men after their union showed a marked\r\ndifference. They lost much of their natural vivacity, energy, and strength\r\nof voice. Their powers of application, as business men, students, and\r\nministers, had declined, as also their enterprise, fervor, and kindliness.\r\nThey had become irritable, dull, pale, and complaining. Many cases of\r\nrheumatic fever have been induced through impoverishment, caused by\r\nexcesses on the part of young married men.\r\n\r\n13. MIDDLE AGE.--After middle age the sap of a man's life declines in\r\nquantity. A man who intends close application to the ministry, to\r\nscientific or literary pursuits, where great demands are made upon the\r\nbrain, must restrain this passion. The supplies for the brain and nervous\r\nsystem are absorbed, and the seed diverted through sexual excesses in the\r\nmarriage relationship, by fornication, or by any other form of immorality,\r\nthe man's power must decline: that to this very cause may be attributed the\r\nfailure and breakdown of so many men of middle age.\r\n\r\n14. INTOXICATING DRINKS.--By all means avoid intoxicating drinks.\r\nImmorality and alcoholic stimulants, as we have shown, are intimately\r\nrelated to one another. Wine and strong drink inflame the blood, and heat\r\nthe passions. Attacking the brain, they warp the judgment, and weaken the\r\npower of restraint. Avoid what is called good living; it is madness to\r\nallow the pleasures of the table to corrupt and corrode the human body. We\r\nare not designed for gourmands, much less for educated pigs. Cold water\r\nbathing, water as a beverage, simple and wholesome food, regularity of\r\nsleep, plenty of exercise; games such as cricket, football, tennis,\r\nboating, or bicycling, are among the best possible preventives against lust\r\nand animal passion.\r\n\r\n15. BEWARE OF IDLENESS.--Indolent leisure means an unoccupied mind. When\r\nyoung men lounge along the streets, in this condition they become an easy\r\nprey to the sisterhood of shame and death. Bear in mind that evil thoughts\r\nprecede evil actions. The hand of the worst thief will not steal until the\r\nthief within operates upon the hand without. The members of the body which\r\nare capable of becoming instruments of sin, are not involuntary actors.\r\nLustful desires must proceed from brain and heart, ere the fire that\r\nconsumes burns in the member.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{437}\r\n\r\nA Private Talk to Young Men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Young Lincoln Starting to School.]\r\n\r\n1. The most valuable and useful organs of the body are those which are\r\ncapable of the greatest dishonor, abuse and corruption. What a snare the\r\nwonderful organism of the eye may become when used to read corrupt books or\r\nlook upon licentious scenes at the theatre, or when used to meet the\r\nfascinating gaze of the harlot! What an instrument for depraving the whole\r\nman may be found in the matchless powers of the brain, the hand, the ear,\r\nthe mouth, or the tongue! What potent instruments may these become in\r\naccomplishing the ruin of the whole being for time and eternity!\r\n\r\n2. In like manner the organ concerning the uses of which I am to speak, has\r\nbeen, and continues to be, made one of the chief instruments of man's\r\nimmorality, shame, disease, and death. How important to know what the\r\nlegitimate uses of this member of the body are, and how great the {438}\r\ndignity conferred upon us in the possession of this gift. On the human side\r\nthis gift may be truly said to bring men nearer to the high and solemn\r\nrelationship of the Creator than any other which they possess.\r\n\r\n3. I first deal with the destructive sin of self-abuse. There can be little\r\ndoubt that vast numbers of boys are guilty of this practice. In many cases\r\nthe degrading habit has been taught by others, e.g., by elder boys at\r\nschool, where association largely results in mutual corruption. With\r\nothers, the means of sensual gratification is found out by personal action;\r\nwhilst in other cases fallen and depraved men have not hesitated to debauch\r\nthe minds of mere children by teaching them this debasing practice.\r\n\r\n4. Thousands of youths and young men have only to use the looking-glass to\r\nsee the portrait of one guilty of this loathsome sin. The effects are\r\nplainly discernible in the boy's appearance. The face and hands become pale\r\nand bloodless. The eye is destitute of its natural fire and lustre. The\r\nflesh is soft and flabby, the muscles limp and lacking healthy firmness. In\r\ncases where the habit has become confirmed, and where the system has been\r\ndrained of this vital force, it is seen in positive ugliness, in a pale and\r\ncadaverous appearance, slovenly gait, slouching walk, and an impaired\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n5. It is obvious that if the most vital physical force of a boy's life is\r\nbeing spent through this degrading habit--a habit, be it observed, of rapid\r\ngrowth, great strength, and difficult to break--he must develop badly. In\r\nthousands of cases the result is seen in a low stature, contracted chest,\r\nweak lungs, and liability to sore throat. Tendency to cold, indigestion,\r\ndepression, drowsiness, and idleness, are results distinctly traceable to\r\nthis deadly practice. Pallor of countenance, nervous and rheumatic\r\naffections, loss of memory, epilepsy, paralysis, and insanity find their\r\nprincipal predisposing cause in the same shameful waste of life. The want\r\nof moral force and strength of mind often observable is youths and young\r\nmen is largely induced by this destructive and deadly sin.\r\n\r\n6. Large numbers of youths pass from an exhausted boyhood into the\r\nweakness, intermittent fevers, and consumption, which are said to carry off\r\nso many. If the deaths were attributed primarily to loss of strength\r\noccasioned by self-pollution, it would be much nearer the truth. It is\r\nmonstrous to suppose that a boy who comes from healthy parents should\r\ndecline and die. Without a shade of doubt the chief cause of decay and\r\ndeath amongst youths and young men, is to be traced to this baneful habit.\r\n{439}\r\n\r\n7. It is a well-known fact that any man who desires to excel and retain his\r\nexcellence as an accurate shot, an oarsman, a pedestrian, a pugilist, a\r\nfirst-class cricketer, bicyclist, student, artist, or literary man, must\r\nabstain from self-pollution and fornication. Thousands of school boys and\r\nstudents lose their positions in the class, and are plucked at the time of\r\ntheir examination by reason of failure of memory, through lack of nerve and\r\nvital force, caused mainly by draining the physical frame of the seed which\r\nis the vigor of the life.\r\n\r\n8. It is only true to say that thousands of young men in the early stages\r\nof a licentious career would rather lose a right hand than have their\r\nmothers or sisters know what manner of men they are. From the side of the\r\nmothers and sisters it may also be affirmed that, were they aware of the\r\nreal character of those brothers and sons, they would wish that they had\r\nnever been born.\r\n\r\n9. Let it be remembered that sexual desire is not in itself dishonorable or\r\nsinful, any more than hunger, thirst, or any other lawful and natural\r\ndesire is. It is the gratification by unlawful means of this appetite which\r\nrenders it so corrupting and iniquitous.\r\n\r\n10. Leisure means the opportunity to commit sin. Unclean pictures are\r\nsought after and feasted upon, paragraphs relating to cases of divorce and\r\nseduction are eagerly read, papers and books of an immoral character and\r\ntendency greedily devoured, low and disgusting conversation indulged in and\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n11. The practical and manly counsel to every youth and young man is, entire\r\nabstinence from indulgence of the sexual faculty until such time as the\r\nmarriage relationship is entered upon. Neither is there, nor can there be,\r\nany exception to this rule.\r\n\r\n12. No man can affirm that self-denial ever injured him. On the contrary,\r\nself-restraint has been liberty, strength and blessing. Beware of the\r\ndeceitful streams of temporary gratification, whose eddying current drifts\r\ntowards license, shame, disease and death. Remember, how quickly moral\r\npower declines, how rapidly the edge of the fatal maelstrom is reached, how\r\nnear the vortex, how terrible the penalty, how fearful the sentence of\r\neverlasting punishment.\r\n\r\n13. Be a young man of principle, honor, and preserve your powers. How can\r\nyou look an innocent girl in the face when you are degrading your manhood\r\nwith the vilest practice? Keep your mind and life pure, and nobility will\r\nbe your crown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{440}\r\n\r\nRemedies for the Social Evil.\r\n\r\n1. MAN RESPONSIBLE.--Every great social reform must begin with the male\r\nsex. They must either lead, or give it its support. Prostitution is a sin\r\nwholly of their own making. All the misery, all the lust, as well as all\r\nthe blighting consequences, are chargeable wholly to the uncontrolled\r\nsexual passion of the male. To reform sinful women, _reform the men_. Teach\r\nthem that the physiological truth means permanent moral, physical and\r\nmental benefit, while seductive indulgence blights and ruins.\r\n\r\n2. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.--A man or woman cannot long live an impure life\r\nwithout sooner or later contracting disease which brings to every sufferer\r\nnot only moral degradation, but often serious and vital injuries and many\r\ntimes death itself becomes the only relief.\r\n\r\n3. SHOULD IT BE REGULATED BY LAW?--Dr. G. J. Ziegler, of Philadelphia, in\r\nseveral medical articles says that the act of sexual connection should be\r\nmade in itself the solemnization of marriage, and that when any such single\r\nact can be proven against an unmarried man, by an unmarried woman, the\r\nlatter be at once invested with all the legal privileges of a wife. By\r\nbestowing this power on women very few men would risk the dangers of the\r\nsociety of a dissolute and scheming woman who might exercise the right to\r\nforce him to a marriage and ruin his reputation and life. The strongest\r\nobjection of this would be that it would increase the temptation to destroy\r\nthe purity of married women, for they could be approached without danger of\r\nbeing forced into another marriage. But this objection could easily be\r\nharmonized with a good system of well regulated laws. Many means have been\r\ntried to mitigate the social evils, but with little encouragement. In the\r\ncity of Paris a system of registration has been inaugurated and houses of\r\nprostitution are under the supervision of the police, yet prostitution has\r\nnot been in any degree diminished. Similar methods have been tried in other\r\nEuropean towns, but without satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n4. MORAL INFLUENCE.--Let it be an imperative to every clergyman, to every\r\neducator, to every statesman and to every philanthropist, to every father\r\nand to every mother, to impart that moral influence which may guide and\r\ndirect the youth of the land into the natural channels of morality,\r\nchastity and health. Then, and not till then, shall we see righteous laws\r\nand rightly enforced for the mitigation and extermination of the modern\r\nhouse of prostitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{441}\r\n\r\nThe Selfish Slaves of Doses of Disease and Death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TURKISH CIGARETTE GIRL.]\r\n\r\n1. MOST DEVILISH INTOXICATION.--What is the most devilish, subtle alluring,\r\nunconquerable, hopeless and deadly form of intoxication, with which science\r\nstruggles and to which it often succumbs; which eludes the restrictive\r\ngrasp of legislation; lurks behind lace curtains, hides in luxurious\r\nboudoirs, haunts the solitude of the study, and with waxen {442} face,\r\nfurtive eyes and palsied step totters to the secret recesses of its\r\nself-indulgence? It is the drunkenness of drugs, and woe be unto him that\r\ncrosseth the threshold of its dream-curtained portal, for though gifted\r\nwith the strength of Samson, the courage of Richard and the genius of\r\nArchimedes, he shall never return, and of him it is written that forever he\r\nleaves hope behind.\r\n\r\n2. THE MATERIAL SATAN.--The material Satan in this sensuous syndicate of\r\nsoul and body-destroying drugs is opium, and next in order of hellish\r\npotency come cocaine and chloral.\r\n\r\n3. GUM OPIUM.--Gum opium, from which the sulphate of morphine is made, is\r\nthe dried juice of the poppy, and is obtained principally in the orient.\r\nTaken in moderate doses it acts specially upon the nervous system, deadens\r\nsensibility, and the mind becomes inactive. When used habitually and\r\nexcessively it becomes a tonic, which stimulates the whole nervous system,\r\nproducing intense mental exaltation and delusive visions. When the effects\r\nwear off, proportionate lassitude follows, which begets an insatiate and\r\ninsane craving for the drug. Under the repeated strain of the continually\r\nincreasing doses, which have to be taken to renew the desired effect, the\r\nnervous system finally becomes exhausted, and mind and body are utterly and\r\nhopelessly wrecked.\r\n\r\n4. COCAINE.--Cocaine is extracted from the leaves of the Peruvian cocoa\r\ntree, and exerts a decided influence upon the nervous system, somewhat akin\r\nto that of coffee. It increases the heart action and is said to be such an\r\nexhilarant that the natives of the Andes are enabled to make extraordinary\r\nforced marches by chewing the leaves containing it. Its after effects are\r\nmore depressing even than those of opium, and insanity more frequently\r\nresults from its use.\r\n\r\n5. CHLORAL.--The name which is derived from the first two syllables of\r\nchlorine and alcohol, is made by passing dry chlorine gas in a continuous\r\nstream through absolute alcohol for six or eight weeks. It is a hypnotic or\r\nsleep-producing drug, and in moderate doses acts on the caliber of the\r\nblood vessels of the brain, producing a soothing effect, especially in\r\ncases of passive congestion. Some patent medicines contain chloral, bromide\r\nand hyoscymus, and they have a large sale, being bought by persons of\r\nwealth, who do not know what they are composed of and recklessly take them\r\nfor the effect they produce.\r\n\r\n6. VICTIMS RAPIDLY INCREASING.--\"From my experience,\" said a leading and\r\nconservative druggist, \"I infer that the {443} number of what are termed\r\nopium, cocaine, and chloral \"fiends\" is rapidly increasing, and is greater\r\nby two or three hundred per cent than a year ago, with twice as many women\r\nas men represented. I should say that one person out of every fifty is a\r\nvictim of this frightful habit, which claims its doomed votaries from the\r\nextremes of social life, those who have the most and the least to live for,\r\nthe upper classes and the cyprian, professional men of the finest\r\nintelligence, fifty per cent of whom are doctors and walk into the pit with\r\neyes wide open. And lawyers and other professional men must be added to\r\nthis fated vice.\"\r\n\r\n7. DESTROYS THE MORAL FIBER.--\"It is a habit which utterly destroys the\r\nmoral fiber of its slaves, and makes unmitigated liars and thieves and\r\nforgers of them, and even murder might be added to the list of crimes, were\r\nno other road left open to the gratification of its insatiate and insane\r\nappetite. I do not know of a single case in which it has been mastered, but\r\nI do know of many where the end has been unspeakable misery, disgrace,\r\nsuffering, insanity and death.\"\r\n\r\n8. SHAMEFUL DEATH.--To particularize further would be profitless so far as\r\nthe beginners are concerned, but would to heaven that those not within the\r\nshadow of this shameful death would take warning from those who are. There\r\nare no social or periodical drunkards in this sort of intoxication. The\r\nvice is not only solitary, unsocial and utterly selfish, but incessant and\r\nincreasing in its demands.\r\n\r\n9. APPETITE STRONGER THAN FOR LIQUOR.--This appetite is far stronger and\r\nmore uncontrollable than that for liquor, and we can spot its victim as\r\nreadily as though he were an ordinary bummer. He has a pallid complexion, a\r\nshifting, shuffling manner and can't look you in the face. If you manage to\r\ncatch his eye for an instant you will observe that its pupil is contracted\r\nto an almost invisible point. It is no exaggeration to say that he would\r\nbarter his very soul for that which indulgence has made him too poor to\r\npurchase, and where artifice fails he will grovel in abject agony of\r\nsupplication for a few grains. At the same time he resorts to all kinds of\r\nmiserable and transparent shifts, to conceal his degradation. He never buys\r\nfor himself, but always for some fictitious person, and often resorts to\r\npurchasing from distant points.\r\n\r\n10. OPIUM SMOKING.--\"Opium smoking,\" said another representative druggist,\r\n\"is almost entirely confined to the Chinese and they seem to thrive on it.\r\nVery few others hit the pipe that we know of.\"\r\n\r\n{444}\r\n\r\n11. MALT AND ALCOHOLIC DRUNKENNESS.--Alcoholic stimulants have a record of\r\nwoe second to nothing. Its victims are annually marching to drunkards'\r\ngraves by the thousands. Drunkards may be divided into three classes:\r\nFirst, the accidental or social drunkard; second, the periodical or\r\nspasmodic drunkard; and third, the sot.\r\n\r\n12. THE ACCIDENTAL OR SOCIAL DRUNKARD is yet on safe ground. He has not\r\nacquired the dangerous craving for liquor. It is only on special occasions\r\nthat he yields to excessive indulgence; sometimes in meeting a friend, or\r\nat some political blow-out. On extreme occasions he will indulge until he\r\nbecomes a helpless victim, and usually as he grows older occasions will\r\nincrease, and step by step he will be lead nearer to the precipice of ruin.\r\n\r\n13. THE PERIODICAL OR SPASMODIC DRUNKARD, with whom it is always the\r\nunexpected which occurs, and who at intervals exacts from his accumulated\r\ncapital the usury of as prolonged a spree as his nerves and stomach will\r\nstand. Science is inclined to charitably label this specimen of man a sort\r\nof a physiologic puzzle, to be as much pitied as blamed. Given the benefit\r\nof every doubt, when he starts off on one of his hilarious tangents, he\r\nbecomes a howling nuisance; if he has a family, keeps them continually on\r\nthe ragged edge of apprehension, and is unanimously pronounced a \"holy\r\nterror\" by his friends. His life and future is an uncertainty. He is\r\nunreliable and cannot be long trusted. Total reformation is the only hope,\r\nbut it rarely is accomplished.\r\n\r\n14. THE SOT.--A blunt term that needs no defining, for even the children\r\ncomprehend the hopeless degradation it implies. Laws to restrain and punish\r\nhim are framed; societies to protect and reform him are organized, and\r\nmostly in vain. He is prone in life's very gutter; bloated, reeking and\r\npolluted with the doggery's slops and filth. He can fall but a few feet\r\nlower, and not until he stumbles into an unmarked, unhonored grave, where\r\nkind mother earth and the merciful mantle of oblivion will cover and\r\nconceal the awful wreck he made of God's own image. To the casual observer,\r\nthe large majority of the community, these three phases, at whose vagaries\r\nmany laugh, and over whose consequences millions mourn, comprehend\r\nintoxication and its results, from the filling of the cup to its shattering\r\nfall from the nerveless hand, and this is the end of the matter. Would to\r\nGod that it were! for at that it would be bad enough. But it is not, for\r\nwife, children and friends must suffer and drink the cup of trouble and\r\nsorrow to its dregs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{445}\r\n\r\nOBJECT LESSONS OF THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND CIGARETTE SMOKING.\r\n\r\nBy PROF. GEORGE HENKLE, who personally made the postmortem examinations and\r\ndrew the following illustrations from the diseased organs just as they\r\nappeared when first taken from the bodies of the unfortunate victims.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STOMACH of an habitual drinker of alcoholic stimulants,\r\nshowing the ulcerated condition of the mucous membrane, incapacitating this\r\nimportant organ for digestive functions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STOMACH (interior view) of a healthy person with the\r\nfirst section of the small intestines.]\r\n\r\n{446}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIVER of a drunkard who died of Cirrhosis of the liver,\r\nalso called granular liver, or \"gin drinker's liver.\" The organ is much\r\nshrunken and presents rough, uneven edges, with carbuncular non-suppurative\r\nsores.

A tobacconist himself\r\nsays that \"the extent to which drugs are used in cigarettes is appalling.\"\r\n\"Havana flavoring\" for this same purpose is sold everywhere by the thousand\r\nbarrels. This flavoring is made from the tonka-bean, which contains a\r\ndeadly poison. The wrappers, warranted to be rice paper, are sometimes made\r\nof common paper, and sometimes of the filthy scrapings of ragpickers\r\nbleached white with arsenic. What a thing for human lungs.\r\n\r\nThe habit burns up good health, good resolutions, good manners, good\r\nmemories, good faculties, and often honesty and truthfulness as well.\r\n\r\nCases of epilepsy, insanity and death are frequently reported as the result\r\nof smoking cigarettes, while such physicians as Dr. Lewis Sayre, Dr.\r\nHammond, and Sir Morell Mackenzie of England, name heart trouble,\r\nblindness, cancer and other diseases as occasioned by it.\r\n\r\nLeading physicians of America unanimously condemn {450} cigarette smoking\r\nas \"one of the vilest and most destructive evils that ever befell the youth\r\nof any country,\" declaring that \"its direct tendency is a deterioration of\r\nthe race.\"\r\n\r\nLook at the pale, wilted complexion of a boy who indulges in excessive\r\ncigarette smoking. It takes no physician to diagnose his case, and death\r\nwill surely mark for his own every boy and young man who will follow up the\r\nhabit. It is no longer a matter of guess. It is a scientific fact which the\r\nmicroscope in every case verifies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{451}\r\n\r\nThe Dangerous Vices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INNOCENT YOUTH.]\r\n\r\nFew persons are aware of the extent to which masturbation or self-pollution\r\nis practiced by the young of both sexes in civilized society.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nThe hollow, sunken eye, the blanched cheek, the withered hands, and\r\nemaciated frame, and the listless life, have other sources than the\r\nordinary illnesses of all large communities.\r\n\r\nWhen a child, after having given proofs of memory and intelligence,\r\nexperiences daily more and more difficulty in retaining and understanding\r\nwhat is taught him, it is not only from unwillingness and idleness, as is\r\ncommonly supposed, but from a disease eating out life itself, brought on by\r\na self-abuse of the private organs. Besides the slow and progressive\r\nderangement of his or her health, the diminished energy of application, the\r\nlanguid movement, the stooping gait, the desertion of social games, the\r\nsolitary walk, late rising, livid and sunken eye, and many other symptoms,\r\nwill fix the attention of every intelligent and competent guardian of youth\r\nthat something is wrong.\r\n\r\n{453}\r\n\r\nMARRIED PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nNor are many persons sufficiently aware of the ruinous extent to which the\r\namative propensity is indulged by married persons. The matrimonial ceremony\r\ndoes, indeed, sanctify the act of sexual intercourse, but it can by no\r\nmeans atone for nor obviate the consequences of its abuse. Excessive\r\nindulgence in the married relation is, perhaps, as much owing to the force\r\nof habit, as to the force of the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUARD WELL THE CRADLE.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION CANNOT BEGIN TOO YOUNG.]\r\n\r\nEXTREME YOUTH.\r\n\r\nMore lamentable still is the effect of inordinate sexual excitement of the\r\nyoung and unmarried. It is not very uncommon to find a confirmed onanist,\r\nor, rather, masturbator, who has not yet arrived at the period of puberty.\r\nMany cases are related in which young boys and girls, from eight to ten\r\nyears of age, were taught the method of self-pollution by their older\r\nplaymates, and had made serious encroachments on the fund of constitutional\r\nvitality even before any considerable degree of sexual appetite was\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nFORCE OF HABIT.\r\n\r\nHere, again, the fault was not in the power of passion, but in the force of\r\nhabit. Parents and guardians of youth can not be too mindful of the\r\ncharacter and habits of those with whom they allow young persons and\r\nchildren under their charge to associate intimately, and especially careful\r\nshould they be with whom they allow them to sleep.\r\n\r\nSIN OF IGNORANCE.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to designate self-pollution as among the \"vices.\" I think\r\nmisfortune is the more appropriate term. It is true, that in the\r\nphysiological sense, it is one of the very worst \"transgressions of the\r\nlaw.\" But in the moral sense it is generally the sin of ignorance in the\r\ncommencement, and in the end the passive submission to a morbid and almost\r\nresistless impulse.\r\n\r\nQUACKS.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when the rising generation must be thoroughly instructed\r\nin this matter. That quack specific \"ignorance\" has been experimented with\r\nquite too long already. The true method of insuring all persons, young or\r\nold, against the abuses of any part, organ, function, or faculty of the\r\nwondrous machinery of life, is to teach them its use. \"Train a child in the\r\nway it should go\" or be sure it {454} will, amid the ten thousand\r\nsurrounding temptations, find out a way in which it should not go. Keeping\r\na child in ignorant innocence is, I aver, no part of the \"training\" which\r\nhas been taught by a wiser than Solomon. Boys and girls do know, will know,\r\nand must know, that between them are important anatomical differences and\r\ninteresting physiological relations. Teach them, I repeat, their use, or\r\nexpect their abuse. Hardly a young person in the world would ever become\r\naddicted to self-pollution if he or she understood clearly the\r\nconsequences; if he or she knew at the outset that the practice was\r\ndirectly destroying the bodily stamina, vitiating the moral tone, and\r\nenfeebling the intellect. No one would pursue the disgusting habit if he or\r\nshe was fully aware that it was blasting all prospects of health and\r\nhappiness in the approaching period of manhood and womanhood.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SYMPTOMS OF THE SECRET HABIT.\r\n\r\nThe effects of either self-pollution or excessive sexual indulgence, appear\r\nin many forms. It would seem as if God had written an instinctive law of\r\nremonstrance, in the innate moral sense, against this filthy vice.\r\n\r\nAll who give themselves up to the excesses of this debasing indulgence,\r\ncarry about with them, continually, a consciousness of their defilement,\r\nand cherish a secret suspicion that others look upon them as debased\r\nbeings. They feel none of that manly confidence and gallant spirit, and\r\nchaste delight in the presence of virtuous females, which stimulate young\r\nmen to pursue the course of ennobling refinement, and mature them for the\r\nsocial relations and enjoyments of life.\r\n\r\nThis shamefacedness, or unhappy quailing of the countenance, on meeting the\r\nlook of others, often follows them through life, in some instances even\r\nafter they have entirely abandoned the habit, and became married men and\r\nrespectable members of society.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the only complaint the patient will make on consulting you,\r\nis that he is suffering under a kind of continued fever. He will probably\r\npresent a hot, dry skin, with something of a hectic appearance. Though all\r\nthe ordinary means of arresting such symptoms have been tried, he is none\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nThe sleep seems to be irregular and unrefreshing--restlessness during the\r\nearly part of the night, and in the advanced stages of the disease, profuse\r\nsweats before morning. There is also frequent starting in the sleep, from\r\n{455} disturbing dreams. The characteristic feature is, that your patient\r\nalmost always dreams of sexual intercourse. This is one of the earliest, as\r\nwell as most constant symptoms. When it occurs most frequently, it is apt\r\nto be accompanied with pain. A gleety discharge from the urethra may also\r\nbe frequently discovered, especially if the patient examine when at stool\r\nor after urinating. Other common symptoms are nervous headache, giddiness,\r\nringing in the ears, and a dull pain in the back part of the head. It is\r\nfrequently the case that the patient suffers a stiffness in the neck,\r\ndarting pains in the forehead, and also weak eyes are among the common\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nOne very frequent, and perhaps early symptom (especially in young females)\r\nis solitariness--a disposition to seclude themselves from society. Although\r\nthey may be tolerably cheerful when in company, they prefer rather to be\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe countenance has often a gloomy and worn-down expression. The patient's\r\nfriends frequently notice a great change. Large livid spots under the eyes\r\nis a common feature. Sudden flashes of heat may be noticed passing over the\r\npatient's face. He is liable also to palpitations. The pulse is very\r\nvariable, generally too slow. Extreme emaciation, without any other\r\nassignable cause for it, may be set down as another very common symptom.\r\n\r\nIf the evil has gone on for several years, there will be a general\r\nunhealthy appearance, of a character so marked as to enable an experienced\r\nobserver at once to detect the cause. In the case of onanists especially\r\nthere is a peculiar rank odor emitted from the body, by which they may be\r\nreadily distinguished. One striking peculiarity of all these patients is,\r\nthat they cannot look a man in the face! Cowardice is constitutional with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT OF THE SECRET HABIT.\r\n\r\n1. The first condition of recovery is a prompt and permanent abandonment of\r\nthe ruinous habit. Without a faithful adherence to this prohibitory law on\r\nthe part of the patient all medication on the part of the physician will\r\nassuredly fail. The patient must plainly understand that future prospects,\r\ncharacter, health, and life itself, depend on an unfaltering resistance to\r\nthe morbid solicitation; with the assurance, however, that a due\r\nperseverance will eventually render what now seems like a resistless and\r\noverwhelming {456} propensity, not only controllable but perfectly\r\nloathsome and undesirable.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the mind employed by interesting the patient in the various topics\r\nof the day, and social features of the community.\r\n\r\n3. Plenty of bodily out of door exercise, hoeing in the garden, walking, or\r\nworking on the farm; of course not too heavy work must be indulged in.\r\n\r\n4. If the patient is weak and very much emaciated, cod liver oil is an\r\nexcellent remedy.\r\n\r\n5. DIET. The patient should live principally on brown bread, oat meal,\r\ngraham crackers, wheat meal, cracked or boiled wheat, or hominy, and food\r\nof that character. No meats should be indulged in whatever; milk diet if\r\nused by the patient is an excellent remedy. Plenty of fruit should be\r\nindulged in; dried toast and baked apples make an excellent supper. The\r\npatient should eat early in the evening, never late at night.\r\n\r\n6. Avoid all tea, coffee, or alcoholic stimulants of any kind.\r\n\r\n7. \"Early to bed and early to rise,\" should be the motto of every victim of\r\nthis vice. A patient should take a cold bath every morning after rising. A\r\ncold water injection in moderate quantities before retiring has cured many\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n8. If the above remedies are not sufficient, a family physician should be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n9. Never let children sleep together, if possible, to avoid it. Discourage\r\nthe children of neighbors and friends from sleeping with your children.\r\n\r\n10. Have your children rise early. It is the lying in bed in the morning\r\nthat plays the mischief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (l) Healthy Semen, Greatly Magnified. (r) The Semen of a\r\nVictim of Masturbation.]\r\n\r\n{457}\r\n\r\nNOCTURNAL EMISSIONS\r\n\r\nInvoluntary emissions of semen during amorous dreams at night is not at all\r\nuncommon among healthy men. When this occurs from one to three or four\r\ntimes a month, no anxiety or concern need be felt.\r\n\r\nWhen the emissions take place without dreams, manifested only by stained\r\nspots in the morning on the linen, or take place at stool and are entirely\r\nbeyond control, then the patient should at once seek for remedies or\r\nconsult a competent physician. When blood stains are produced, then medical\r\naid must be sought at once.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT FOR NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS.\r\n\r\nSleep in a hard bed, and rise early and take a sponge bath in cold water\r\nevery morning. Eat light suppers and refrain from eating late in the\r\nevening. Empty the bladder thoroughly before retiring, bathe the spine and\r\nhips with a sponge dipped in cold water.\r\n\r\n_Never sleep lying on the back._\r\n\r\nAvoid all highly seasoned food and read good books, and keep the mind well\r\nemployed. Take regular and vigorous outdoor exercise every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Healthy Testicle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Testicle wasted by Masturbation.]\r\n\r\nAvoid all coffee, tea, wine, beer and all alcoholic liquors. Don't use\r\ntobacco, and keep the bowels free.\r\n\r\nPRESCRIPTION.--Ask your druggist to put you up a good Iron Tonic and take\r\nit regularly according to his directions.\r\n\r\nBEWARE OF ADVERTISING QUACKS.\r\n\r\nBeware of these advertising schemes that advertise a speedy cure for \"Loss\r\nof Youth,\" \"Lost Vitality,\" \"A Cure for Impotency,\" \"Renewing of Old Age,\"\r\netc. Do not allow these circulating pamphlets and circulars to concern you\r\nthe least. If you have a few _Nocturnal Emissions_, remember it is only a\r\nmark of vitality and health, and not a sign of a deathly disease, as many\r\nof these advertising quacks would lead you to believe.\r\n\r\nUse your private organs only for what your Creator intended they should be\r\nused, and there will be no occasion for you to be frightened by the\r\ndeception of quacks.\r\n\r\n{458}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TWO PATHS: WHAT WILL THE BOY BECOME?]\r\n\r\n{459}\r\n\r\nLost Manhood Restored.\r\n\r\n1. RESOLUTE DESISTENCE.--The first step towards the restoration of lost\r\nmanhood is a resolute desistence from these terrible sins. Each time the\r\ntemptation is overcome, the power to resist becomes stronger, and the\r\nfierce fire declines. Each time the sin is committed, its hateful power\r\nstrengthens, and the fire of lust is increased. Remember, that you cannot\r\ncommit these sins, and maintain health and strength.\r\n\r\n2. AVOID BEING ALONE.--Avoid being alone when the temptation comes upon you\r\nto commit self-abuse. Change your thoughts at once; \"keep the heart\r\ndiligently, for out of it are the issues of life.\"\r\n\r\n3. AVOID EVIL COMPANIONS.--Avoid evil companions, lewd conversation, bad\r\npictures, corrupt and vicious novels, books, and papers. Abstain from all\r\nintoxicating drinks. These inflame the blood, excite the passions, and\r\nstimulate sensuality; weakening the power of the brain, they always impair\r\nthe power of self-restraint. Smoking is very undesirable. Keep away from\r\nthe moral pesthouses. Remember that these houses are the great resort of\r\nfallen and depraved men and women. The music, singing, and dancing are\r\nsimply a blind to cover the intemperance and lust, which hold high carnival\r\nin these guilded hells. This, be it remembered, is equally true of the\r\ngreat majority of the theatres.\r\n\r\n4. AVOID STRONG TEA, OR COFFEE.--Take freely of cocoa, milk, and bread and\r\nmilk, or oatmeal porridge. Meats, such as beef and mutton, use moderately.\r\nWe would strongly recommend to young men of full habit, vegetarian diet.\r\nFruits in their season, partake liberally; also fresh vegetables. Brown\r\nbread and toast, as also rice, and similar puddings, are always suitable.\r\nAvoid rich pastry and new bread.\r\n\r\n5. THREE MEALS A DAY ARE ABUNDANT.--Avoid suppers, and be careful, if\r\ntroubled with nightly emissions, not to take any liquid, not even water,\r\nafter seven o'clock in the evening, at latest. This will diminish the\r\nsecretions of the body, when asleep, and the consequent emissions, which in\r\nthe early hours or the morning usually follow the taking of any kind of\r\ndrink. Do not be anxious or troubled by an occasional emission, say, for\r\nexample, once a fortnight.\r\n\r\n6. REST ON A HARD MATTRESS.--Keep the body cool when asleep; heat arising\r\nfrom a load of bed-clothes is most {460} undesirable. Turn down the\r\ncounterpane, and let the air have free course through the blankets.\r\n\r\n7. RELIEVE THE SYSTEM.--As much as possible relieve the system of urine\r\nbefore going to sleep. On rising, bathe if practicable. If you cannot bear\r\ncold water, take the least possible chill off the water (cold water,\r\nhowever, is best). If bathing is not practicable, wash the body with cold\r\nwater, and keep scrupulously clean. The reaction caused by cold water, is\r\nmost desirable. Rub the body dry with a rough towel. Drink a good draught\r\nof cold water.\r\n\r\n8. EXERCISE.--Get fifteen minutes' brisk walk, if possible before\r\nbreakfast. If any sense of faintness exists, eat a crust of bread, or\r\nbiscuit. Be regular in your meals, and do not fear to make a hearty\r\nbreakfast. This lays a good foundation for the day. Take daily good, but\r\nnot violent exercise. Walk until you can distinctly feel the tendency to\r\nperspiration. This will keep the pores of the skin open and in healthy\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n9. MEDICINES.--Take the medicines, if used, regularly and carefully.\r\nBromide of Potassium is a most valuable remedy in allaying lustful and\r\nheated passions and appetites. Unless there is actual venereal disease,\r\nmedicine should be very little resorted to.\r\n\r\n10. AVOID THE STREETS AT NIGHT.--Beware of corrupt companions. Fast young\r\nmen and women should be shunned everywhere. Cultivate a taste for good\r\nreading and evening studies. Home life with its gentle restraints, pure\r\nfriendships, and healthful discipline, should be highly valued. There is no\r\nliberty like that of a well-regulated home. To large numbers of young men\r\nin business houses, home life is impracticable.\r\n\r\n11. BE OF GOOD CHEER AND COURAGE.--Recovery will be gradual, and not\r\nsudden; vital force is developed slowly from within. The object aimed at by\r\nmedicine and counsel is to aid and increase nervous and physical vigor, and\r\ngive tone to the demoralized system. Do not pay the slightest heed to the\r\nexaggerated statements of the wretched quack doctors, who advertise\r\neverywhere. Avoid them as you would a pestilence. Their great object is,\r\nthrough exciting your fears, to get you into their clutches, in order to\r\noppress you with heavy and unjust payments. Be careful, not to indulge in\r\nfancies, or morbid thoughts and feelings. Be hopeful, and play the part of\r\na man determined to overcome.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{461}\r\n\r\nManhood Wrecked and Rescued.\r\n\r\n1. THE NOBLEST FUNCTIONS OF MANHOOD.--The noblest functions of manhood are\r\nbrought into action in the office of the parent. It is here that man\r\nassumes the prerogative of a God and becomes a creator. How essential that\r\nevery function of his physical system should be perfect, and every faculty\r\nof his mind free from that which would degrade; yet how many drag their\r\npurity through the filth of masturbation, revel in the orgies of the\r\ndebauchee, and worship at the shrine of the prostitute, until, like a tree\r\nblighted by the livid lightning, they stand with all their outward form of\r\nmen, but without life.\r\n\r\n2. THRESHOLD OF HONOR.--Think of a man like that; in whom the passions and\r\nvices have burned themselves out, putting on the airs of a saint and\r\nclaiming to have reformed! Aye, reformed, when there is no longer sweetness\r\nin the indulgence of lust. Think of such loathsome bestiality, dragging its\r\nslimy body across the threshold of honor and nobility and asking a pure\r\nwoman, with the love-light of heaven in her eyes, to pass her days with\r\nhim; to accept him as her lord; to be satisfied with the burnt-out,\r\nshriveled forces of manhood left; to sacrifice her purity that he may be\r\nredeemed, and to respect in a husband what she would despise in the brute.\r\n\r\n3. STOP.--If you are, then, on the highway to this state of degradation,\r\nstop. If already you have sounded the depths of lost manhood, then turn,\r\nand from the fountain of life regain your power, before you perpetrate the\r\nterrible crime of marriage, thus wrecking a woman's life and perhaps\r\nbringing into the world children who will live only to suffer and curse the\r\nday on which they were born and the father who begat them.\r\n\r\n4. SEXUAL IMPOTENCY.--Sexual impotency means sexual starvation, and drives\r\nmany wives to ruin, while a similar lack among wives drives husbands to\r\nlibertinism. Nothing so enhances the happiness of married couples as this\r\nfull, life-abounding, sexual vigor in the husband, thoroughly reciprocated\r\nby the wife, yet completely controlled by both.\r\n\r\n5. TWO CLASSES OF SUFFERERS.--There are two classes of sufferers. First,\r\nthose who have only practiced self-abuse and are suffering from emissions.\r\nSecond, those who by overindulgence in marital relations, or by dissipation\r\nwith women, have ruined their forces.\r\n\r\n6. THE REMEDY.--For self-abuse: When the young man has practiced self-abuse\r\nfor some time, he finds, upon {462} quitting the habit, that he has nightly\r\nemissions. He becomes alarmed, reads every sensational advertisement in the\r\npapers, and at once comes to the conclusion that he must take something.\r\n_Drugs are not necessary._\r\n\r\n7. STOP THE CAUSE.--The one thing needful, above all others, is to stop the\r\ncause. I have found that young men are invariably mistaken as to what is\r\nthe cause. When asked as to the first cause of their trouble, they\r\ninvariably say it was self-abuse, etc., but it is not. _It is the thought._\r\nThis precedes the handling, and, like every other cause, must be removed in\r\norder to have right results.\r\n\r\n8. STOP THE THOUGHT.--But remember, _stop the thought_! You must not look\r\nafter every woman with lustful thoughts, nor go courting girls who will\r\nallow you to hug, caress and kiss them, thus rousing your passions almost\r\nto a climax. Do not keep the company of those whose only conversation is of\r\na lewd and depraved character, but keep the company of those ladies who\r\nawaken your higher sentiments and nobler impulses, who appeal to the\r\nintellect and rouse your aspiration, in whose presence you would no more\r\nfeel your passions aroused than in the presence of your own mother.\r\n\r\n9. YOU WILL GET WELL.--Remember you will get well. Don't fear. Fear\r\ndestroys strength and therefore increases the trouble. Many get\r\ndownhearted, discouraged, despairing--the very worst thing that can happen,\r\ndoing as much harm, and in many cases more, than their former dissipation.\r\nBrooding kills; hope enlivens. Then sing with joy that the savior of\r\nknowledge has vanquished the death-dealing ignorance of the past; that the\r\nglorious strength of manhood has awakened and cast from you forever the\r\ngrinning skeleton of vice. Be your better self, proud that your thoughts in\r\nthe day-time are as pure as you could wish your dreams to be at night.\r\n\r\n10. HELPS.--Do not use tobacco or liquor. They inflame the passions and\r\nirritate the nervous system; they only gratify base appetites and never\r\nrouse the higher feelings. Highly spiced food should be eschewed, not\r\nchewed. Meat should be eaten sparingly, and never at the last meal.\r\n\r\n11. DON'T EAT TOO MUCH.--If not engaged in hard physical labor, try eating\r\ntwo meals a day. Never neglect the calls of nature, and if possible have a\r\npassage from the bowels every night before retiring. When this is not done\r\nthe feces often drop into the rectum during sleep, producing heat which\r\nextends to the sexual organs, causing the lascivious dreams and emission.\r\nThis will be noticed especially in the morning, when the feces usually\r\ndistend {463} the rectum and the person nearly always awakes with sexual\r\npassions aroused. If necessary, use injections into the rectum of from one\r\nto two quarts of water, blood heat, two or three times a week. Be sure to\r\nkeep clean and see to it that no matter collects under the foreskin. Wash\r\noff the organ every night and take a quick, cold hand-bath every morning.\r\nHave something to do. Never be idle. Idleness always worships at the shrine\r\nof passion.\r\n\r\n12. THE WORST TIME OF ALL.--Many are ruined by allowing their thoughts to\r\nrun riot in the morning. Owing to the passions being roused as stated\r\nabove, the young man lies half awake and half dozing, rousing his passions\r\nand reveling in lascivious thought for hours perhaps, thus completely\r\nsapping the fountains of purity, establishing habits of vice that will bind\r\nhim with iron bands, and doing his physical system more injury than if he\r\nhad practiced self-abuse, and had the emission in a few minutes. Jump out\r\nof bed at once on waking, and never allow the thought to master you.\r\n\r\n13. A HAND BATH.--A hand bath in cold water every morning will diminish\r\nthose rampant sexual cravings, that crazy, burning, lustful desire so\r\nsensualizing to men by millions; lessen prostitution by toning down that\r\npassion which alone patronizes it, and relieve wives by the millions of\r\nthose excessive conjugal demands which ruin their sexual health; besides\r\nsouring their tempers, and then demanding millions of money for resultant\r\ndoctor bills.\r\n\r\n14. WILL GET WELL.--Feel no more concern about your self. Say to yourself,\r\n\"I shall and will get well under this treatment,\" as you certainly will.\r\nPluck is half the battle. Mind acts and reads directly on the sexual\r\norgans. Determining to get well gets you well; whilst all fear that you\r\nwill become worse makes you worse. All worrying over your case as if it\r\nwere hopeless, all moody and despondent feelings, tear the life right out\r\nof these organs whilst hopefulness puts new life into them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{464}\r\n\r\nThe Curse and Consequence of Secret Diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INNOCENT CHILDHOOD.]\r\n\r\n1. THE SINS OF THE FATHERS ARE VISITED ON THE CHILDREN.--If persons who\r\ncontract secret diseases were the only sufferers, there would be less pity\r\nand less concern manifested by the public and medical profession.\r\n\r\n2. There are many secret diseases which leave an hereditary taint, and\r\ninnocent children and grandchildren are compelled to suffer as well as\r\nthose who committed the immoral act.\r\n\r\n3. GONORRHOEA (Clap) is liable to leave the parts sensitive and irritable,\r\nand the miseries of spermatorrhoea, impotence, chronic rheumatism,\r\nstricture and other serious ailments may follow.\r\n\r\n4. SYPHILIS (Pox).--Statistics prove that over 30 per cent. of the children\r\nborn alive perish within the first year. Outside of this frightful\r\nmortality, how many children are born, inheriting eruptions of the skin,\r\nfoul ulcerations, {465} swelling of the bones, weak eyes or blindness,\r\nscrofula, idiocy, stunted growth, and finally insanity, all on account of\r\nthe father's early vices. The weaknesses and afflictions of parents are by\r\nnatural laws visited upon their children.\r\n\r\n5. The mother often takes the disease from her husband, and she becomes an\r\ninnocent sufferer to the dreaded disease. However, some other name\r\ngenerally is applied to the disease, and with perfect confidence in her\r\nhusband she suffers pain all her life, ignorant of the true cause. Her\r\nchildren have diseases of the eyes, skin, glands and bones, and the doctor\r\nwill apply the term scrofula, when the result is nothing more or less than\r\ninherited syphilis. Let every man remember, the vengeance to a vital law\r\nknows only justice, not mercy, and a single moment of illicit pleasure will\r\nbring many curses upon him, and drain out the life of his innocent\r\nchildren, and bring a double burden of disease and sorrow to his wife.\r\n\r\n6. If any man who has been once diseased is determined to marry, he should\r\nhave his constitution tested thoroughly and see that every seed of the\r\nmalady in the system has been destroyed. He should bathe daily in natural\r\nsulphur waters, as, for instance, the hot springs in Arkansas, or the\r\nsulphur springs in Florida, or those springs known as specific remedies for\r\nsyphilic diseases. As long as the eruptions on the skin appear by bathing\r\nin sulphur water there is danger, and if the eruptions cease and do not\r\nappear, it is very fair evidence that the disease has left the system, yet\r\nit is not an infallible test.\r\n\r\n7. How many bright and intelligent young men have met their doom and\r\nblighted the innocent lives of others, all on account of the secret follies\r\nand vices of men.\r\n\r\n8. PROTECTION.--Girls, you, who are too poor and too honest to disguise\r\naught in your character, with your sweet soul shining through every act of\r\nyour lives, beware of the men who smile upon you. Study human nature, and\r\ntry and select a virtuous companion.\r\n\r\n_Transcriber's note: there is no 9. in the original._\r\n\r\n10. SYPHILITIC POISON INERADICABLE.--Many of our best and ablest physicians\r\nassert that syphilitic poison, once infected, there can be no total\r\ndisinfection during life; some of the virus remains in the system, though\r\nit may seem latent. Boards of State Charities in discussing the causes of\r\nthe existence of whole classes of defectives hold to the opinion given\r\nabove. The Massachusetts board in its report has these strong words on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\"The worst is that, though years may have passed since its active stage, it\r\npermeates the very seed of life and {466} causes strange affections or\r\nabnormalities in the offspring, or it tends to lessen their vital force, to\r\ndisturb or to repress their growth, to lower their standard of mental and\r\nbodily vigor, and to render life puny and short.\r\n\r\n11. A SERPENT'S TOOTH.--\"_The direct blood-poisoning, caused by the\r\nabsorption into the system of the virus (syphilis) is more hideous and\r\nterrible in its effect than that of a serpent's tooth._ This may kill\r\noutright, and there's an end; but that, stingless and painless, slowly and\r\nsurely permeates and vitiates the whole system of which it becomes part and\r\nparcel, like myriads of trichinæ, and can never be utterly cast out, even\r\nby salivation.\r\n\r\n\"Woe to the family and to the people in whose veins the poison courses!\r\n\r\n\"It would seem that nothing could end the curse except utter extermination.\r\nThat, however, would imply a purpose of eternal vengeance, involving the\r\ninnocent with the guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThis disease compared with small-pox is as an ulcer upon a finger to an\r\nulcer in the vitals. Small-pox does not vitiate the blood of a people; this\r\ndisease does. Its existence in a primary form implies moral turpitude.\r\n\r\n12. CASES CITED.--Many cases might be cited. We give but one. A man who had\r\ncontracted the disease reformed his ways and was apparently cured. He\r\nmarried, and although living a moral life was compelled to witness in his\r\nlittle girl's eye-balls, her gums, and her breath the result of his past\r\nsins. No suffering, no expense, no effort would have been too great could\r\nhe but be assured that his offspring might be freed from these results.\r\n\r\n13. PREVENTION BETTER THAN CURE.--Here is a case where the old adage, \"An\r\nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" may be aptly applied. Our\r\ndesire would be to herald to all young men in stentorian tones the advice,\r\n\"Avoid as a deadly enemy any approaches or probable pitfalls of the\r\ndisease. Let prevention be your motto and then you need not look for a\r\ncure.\"\r\n\r\n14. HELP PROFFERED.--Realizing the sad fact that many are afflicted with\r\nthis disease we would put forth our utmost powers to help even these, and\r\nhence give on the following pages some of the best methods of cure.\r\n\r\nHOW TO CURE GONORRHOEA (Clap).\r\n\r\nCAUSES, IMPURE CONNECTIONS, ETC.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--As the disease first commences to manifest itself, the patient\r\nnotices a slight itching at the point of the the {467} male organ, which is\r\nshortly followed by a tingling or smarting sensation, especially on making\r\nwater. This is on account of the inflammation, which now gradually extends\r\nbackward, until the whole canal is involved. The orifice of the urethra is\r\nnow noticed to be swollen and reddened, and on inspection a slight\r\ndischarge will be found to be present. And if the penis is pressed between\r\nthe finger and thumb, matter or pus exudes. As the inflammatory stage\r\ncommences, the formation of pus is increased, which changes from a thin to\r\na thick yellow color, accompanied by a severe scalding on making water. The\r\ninflammation increases up to the fifth day, often causing such pain, on\r\nurinating, that the patient is tortured severely. When the disease reaches\r\nits height, the erections become somewhat painful, when the discharge may\r\nbe streaked with blood.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nFirst, see that the bowels are loose--if not, a cathartic should be given.\r\nIf the digestive powers are impaired, they should be corrected and the\r\ngeneral health looked after. If the system is in a good condition, give\r\ninternally five drops of gelseminum every two hours. The first thing to be\r\nthought of is to pluck the disease in its bud, which is best done by\r\ninjections. The best of these are: tinct. hydrastis, one drachm; pure\r\nwater, four ounces; to be used three times a day after urinating. Zinc,\r\nsulphate, ten grains; pure water, eight ounces; to be used after urinating\r\nevery morning and night. Equal parts of red wine and pure water are often\r\nused, and are of high repute, as also one grain of permanganate of potash\r\nto four ounces of water.\r\n\r\nIf the above remedies are ineffectual, a competent physician should be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nGeneral Treatment.--One of the best injections for a speedy cure is:\r\n\r\n  Hydrastis, 1 oz.\r\n  Water, 5 oz.\r\n\r\nMix and with a small syringe inject into the penis four or five times a day\r\nafter urinating, until relieved, and diminish the number of injections as\r\nthe disease disappears. No medicine per mouth need be given, unless the\r\npatient is in poor health.\r\n\r\nSYPHILIS (Pox).\r\n\r\n1. This is the worst of all diseases except cancer--no tissue of the body\r\nescapes the ravages of this dreadful {468} disease--bone, muscle, teeth,\r\nskin and every part of the body are destroyed by its deforming and\r\ncorroding influence.\r\n\r\n2. SYMPTOMS.--About eight days after the exposure a little redness and then\r\na pimple, which soon becomes an open sore, makes its appearance, on or\r\nabout the end of the penis in males or on the external or inner parts of\r\nthe uterus of females. Pimples and sores soon multiply, and after a time\r\nlittle hard lumps appear in the groin, which soon develop into a blue tumor\r\ncalled _bubo_. Copper colored spots may appear in the face, hair fall out,\r\netc. Canker and ulcerations in the mouth and various parts of the body soon\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n3. TREATMENT.--Secure the very best physician your means will allow without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n4. LOCAL TREATMENT OF BUBOES.--To prevent suppuration, treatment must be\r\ninstituted as soon as they appear. Compresses, wet in a solution composed\r\nof half an ounce of muriate of ammonia, three drachms of the fluid extract\r\nof belladonna, and a pint of water, are beneficial, and should be\r\ncontinuously applied. The tumor may be scattered by painting it once a day\r\nwith tincture of iodine.\r\n\r\n5. FOR ERUPTIONS.--The treatment of these should be mainly constitutional.\r\nPerfect cleanliness should be observed, and the sulphur, spirit vapor, or\r\nalkaline bath freely used. Good diet and the persistent use of alteratives\r\nwill generally prove successful in removing this complication.\r\n\r\nRECIPE FOR SYPHILIS.--\r\n\r\n  Bin-iodide of mercury, 1 gr.\r\n  Extract of licorice, 32 gr.\r\n\r\nMake into 16 pills. Take one morning and night.\r\n\r\n_LOTION._--\r\n\r\n  Bichloride of mercury, 15 gr.\r\n  Lime water, 1 pt.\r\n\r\nShake well, and wash affected parts night and morning.\r\n\r\nFOR ERUPTIONS ON TONGUE.--\r\n\r\n  Cyanide of silver, ½ gr.\r\n  Powdered iridis, 2 gr.\r\n\r\nDivide into 10 parts. To be rubbed on tongue once a day.\r\n\r\nFOR ERUPTIONS IN SYPHILIS.--A 5 per cent. ointment of carbolic acid in a\r\ngood preparation.\r\n\r\nBUBO.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--\r\n\r\n  Warm poultice of linseed meal,\r\n  Mercurial plaster,\r\n  Lead ointment.\r\n\r\nGLEET (Chronic Clap).\r\n\r\n1. SYMPTOMS.--When gonorrhoea is not cured at the end of twenty-one or\r\ntwenty-eight days, at which time all {469} discharge should have ceased, we\r\nhave a condition known as chronic clap, which is nothing more or less than\r\ngleet. At this time most of the symptoms have abated, and the principal one\r\nneeding medical attention is the discharge, which is generally thin, and\r\noften only noticed in the morning on arising, when a scab will be noticed,\r\nglutinating the lips of the external orifice. Or, on pressing with the\r\nthumb and finger from behind, forward, a thin, white discharge can be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n2. HOME TREATMENT.--The diet of patients affected with this disease is\r\nall-important, and should have careful attention. The things that should be\r\navoided are highly spiced and stimulating foods and drinks, as all forms of\r\nalcohol, or those containing acids. Indulgence in impure thoughts is often\r\nsufficient to keep a discharge, on account of the excitement it produces to\r\nthe sensitive organs, thus inducing erections, which always do harm.\r\n\r\n3. GENERAL TREATMENT.--The best injection is:\r\n\r\n  Nitrate of silver, ¼ grain.\r\n  Pure water, 1 oz.\r\n\r\nInject three or four times a day after urinating.\r\n\r\nSTRICTURE OF THE URETHRA.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--The patient experiences difficulty in voiding the urine, several\r\nineffectual efforts being made before it will flow. The stream is\r\ndiminished in size, of a flattened or spiral form, or divided in two or\r\nmore parts, and does not flow with the usual force.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--It is purely a surgical case and a competent surgeon must be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nPHIMOSIS.\r\n\r\n1. CAUSE.--Is a morbid condition of the penis, in which the glans penis\r\ncannot be uncovered, either on account of a congenital smallness of the\r\norifice of the foreskin, or it may be due to the acute stage of gonorrhoea,\r\nor caused by the presence of soft chancre.\r\n\r\n2. SYMPTOMS.--It is hardly necessary to give a description of the symptoms\r\noccurring in this condition, for it will be easily diagnosed, and its\r\nappearances are so indicative that all that is necessary is to study into\r\nits cause and treat the disease with reference to that.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--If caused from acute gonorrhoea, it should be treated first by\r\nhot fomentations, to subdue the swelling, when the glans penis can be\r\nuncovered. If the result of the formation of chancre under the skin, they\r\nshould be treated by a surgeon, for it may result in the sloughing off of\r\nthe end of the penis, unless properly treated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{470}\r\n\r\nAnimal Magnetism.\r\n\r\nWHAT IT IS AND HOW TO USE IT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATING MAGNETIC INFLUENCES.\r\n\r\nANIMAL MAGNETISM IS SUPPOSED TO RADIATE FROM AND ENCIRCLE EVERY HUMAN\r\nBEING.]\r\n\r\n1. MAGNETISM EXISTING BETWEEN THE BODIES OF MANKIND.--It is rational to\r\nbelieve that there is a magnetism existing between the bodies of mankind,\r\nwhich may have either a beneficial or a damaging effect upon our health,\r\naccording to the conditions which are produced, or the nature of the\r\nindividuals who are brought in contact with each other. As an illustration\r\nof this point we might consider that, all nature is governed by the laws of\r\nattraction and repulsion, or in other words, by positive and negative\r\nforces. These subtle forces or laws in nature which we call attraction or\r\n{471} repulsion, are governed by the affinity--or sameness--or the lack of\r\naffinity--or sameness--which exists between what may be termed the\r\ncombination of atoms or molecules which goes to make up organic structure.\r\n\r\n2. LAW OF ATTRACTION.--Where this affinity--or sameness--exists between the\r\ndifferent things, there is what we term the law of attraction, or what may\r\nbe termed the disposition to unite together. Where there is no affinity\r\nexisting between the nature of the different particles of matter, there is\r\nwhat may be termed the law of repulsion, which has a tendency to destroy\r\nthe harmony which would otherwise take place.\r\n\r\n3. MAGNETISM OF THE MIND.--Now, what is true of the magnet and steel, is\r\nalso true--from the sameness of their nature--of two bodies. And what is\r\ntrue of the body in this sense, is also true of the sameness or magnetism\r\nof the mind. Hence, _by the laying on of hands_, or by the association of\r\nthe minds of individuals, we reach the same result as when a combination is\r\nproduced in any department of nature. Where this sameness of affinity\r\nexists, there will be a blending of forces, which has a tendency to build\r\nup vitality.\r\n\r\n4. A PROOF.--As a proof of this position, how often have you found the\r\nsociety of strangers to be so repulsive to your feelings, that you have no\r\ndisposition to associate. Others seem to bring with them a soothing\r\ninfluence that draws you closer to them. All these involuntary likes and\r\ndislikes are but the results of the _animal magnetism_ that we are\r\nconstantly throwing off from our bodies,--although seemingly imperceptible\r\nto our internal senses.--The dog can scent his master, and determine the\r\ncourse which he pursues, no doubt from similar influences.\r\n\r\n5. HOME HARMONY.--Many of the infirmities that afflict humanity are largely\r\ndue to a want of an understanding of its principles, and the right\r\napplications of the same. I believe that if this law of magnetism was more\r\nfully understood and acted upon, there would be a far greater harmony in\r\nthe domestic circle; the health of parents and children might often be\r\npreserved where now sickness and discord so frequently prevail.\r\n\r\n6. THE LAW OF MAGNETISM.--When two bodies are brought into contact with\r\neach other, the weak must naturally draw from the strong until both have\r\nbecome equal. And as long as this equality exists there will be perfect\r\nharmony between individuals, because of the reciprocation which exists in\r\ntheir nature. {472}\r\n\r\n7. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.--But if one should gain the advantage of the\r\nother in magnetic attraction, the chances are that through the law of\r\ndevelopment, or what has been termed the \"Survival of the Fittest\"--the\r\nstronger will rob the weaker until one becomes robust and healthy, while\r\nthe other grows weaker and weaker day by day. This frequently occurs with\r\nchildren sleeping together, also between husband and wife.\r\n\r\n8. SLEEPING WITH INVALIDS.--Healthy, hearty, vigorous persons sleeping with\r\na diseased person is always at a disadvantage. The consumptive patient will\r\ndraw from the strong, until the consumptive person becomes the strong\r\npatient and the strong person will become the consumptive. There are many\r\ncases on record to prove this statement. A well person should never sleep\r\nwith an invalid if he desires to keep his health unimpaired, for the weak\r\nwill take from the strong, until the strong becomes the weak and the weak\r\nthe strong. Many a husband has died from a lingering disease which saved\r\nhis wife from an early grave. He took the disease from his wife because he\r\nwas the stronger, and she became better and he perished.\r\n\r\n9. HUSBAND AND WIFE.--It is not always wise that husband and wife should\r\nsleep together, nor that children--whose temperament does not\r\nharmonize--should be compelled to sleep in the same bed. By the same law it\r\nis wrong for the young to sleep with old persons. Some have slept in the\r\nsame bed with persons, when in the morning they have gotten up seemingly\r\nmore tired than when they went to bed. At other times with different\r\npersons, they have lain awake two-thirds of the night in pleasant\r\nconversation and have gotten up in the morning without scarcely realizing\r\nthat they had been to sleep at all, yet have felt perfectly rested and\r\nrefreshed.\r\n\r\n10. MAGNETIC HEALING, OR WHAT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS THE LAYING ON OF HANDS.--A\r\nnervous prostration is a negative condition beneath the natural, by the\r\nlaying on of hands a person in a good, healthy condition is capable of\r\ncommunicating to the necessity of the weak. For the negative condition of\r\nthe patient will as naturally draw from the strong, as the loadstone draws\r\nfrom the magnet, until both become equally charged. And as fevers are a\r\npositive condition of the system \"beyond the natural,\" the normal condition\r\nof the healer will, by the laying on of the hands, absorb these positive\r\natoms, until the fever of the patient becomes reduced or cured. As a proof\r\nof this the magnetic healer often finds himself or herself prostrated after\r\ntreating the weak; and excited or feverish after treating a feverish\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{473}\r\n\r\nHow to Read Character.\r\n\r\nHOW TO TELL DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE NOSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL MATED.]\r\n\r\n1. LARGE NOSES.--Bonaparte chose large-nosed men for his generals, and the\r\nopinion prevails that large noses indicate long heads and strong minds. Not\r\nthat great noses cause great minds, but that the motive or powerful\r\ntemperament cause both.\r\n\r\n2. FLAT NOSES.--Flat noses indicate flatness of mind and character, by\r\nindicating a poor, low organic structure.\r\n\r\n3. BROAD NOSES.--Broad noses indicate large passageways to the lungs, and\r\nthis, large lungs and vital organs, and this, great strength of\r\nconstitution, and hearty animal {474} passions along with selfishness; for\r\nbroad noses, broad shoulders, broad heads, and large animal organs go\r\ntogether. But when the nose is narrow at the base, the nostrils are small,\r\nbecause the lungs are small and need but small avenues for air; and this\r\nindicates a predisposition to consumptive complaints, along with an active\r\nbrain and nervous system, and a passionate fondness for literary pursuits.\r\n\r\n4. SHARP NOSES.--Sharp noses indicate a quick, clear, penetrating,\r\nsearching, knowing, sagacious mind, and also a scold; indicate warmth of\r\nlove, hate, generosity, moral sentiment--indeed, positiveness in\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n5. BLUNT NOSES.--Blunt noses indicate and accompany obtuse intellects and\r\nperceptions, sluggish feelings, and a soulless character.\r\n\r\n6. ROMAN NOSES.--The Roman nose indicates a martial spirit, love of debate,\r\nresistance, and strong passions, while hollow, pug noses indicate a tame,\r\neasy, inert, sly character, and straight, finely-formed Grecian noses\r\nharmonious characters. Seek their acquaintance.\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY STATURE.\r\n\r\n1. TALL PERSONS.--Tall persons have high heads, and are aspiring, aim high,\r\nand seek conspicuousness, while short ones have flat heads, and seek the\r\nlower forms of worldly pleasures. Tall persons are rarely mean, though\r\noften grasping; but very penurious persons are often broad-built.\r\n\r\n2. SMALL PERSONS.--Small persons generally have exquisite mentalities, yet\r\nless power--the more precious the article, the smaller the package in which\r\nit is done up,--while great men are rarely dwarfs, though great size often\r\nco-exists with sluggishness.\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE WALK.\r\n\r\n1. AWKWARD.--Those whose motions are awkward yet easy, possess much\r\nefficiency and positiveness of character, yet lack polish; and just in\r\nproportion as they become refined in mind will their movements be\r\ncorrespondingly improved. A short and quick step indicates a brisk and\r\nactive but rather contracted mind, whereas those who take long steps\r\ngenerally have long heads; yet if the step is slow, they will make\r\ncomparatively little progress, while those whose step is long and quick\r\nwill accomplish proportionately much, and pass most of their competitors on\r\nthe highway of life. {475}\r\n\r\n2. A DRAGGING STEP.--Those who sluff or drag their heels, drag and drawl in\r\neverything; while those who walk with a springing, bouncing step, abound in\r\nmental snap and spring. Those whose walk is mincing, affected, and\r\nartificial, rarely, if ever, accomplish much; whereas those who walk\r\ncarelessly, that is, naturally, are just what they appear to be, and put on\r\nnothing for outside show.\r\n\r\n3. THE DIFFERENT MODES OF WALKING.--In short, every individual has his own\r\npeculiar mode of moving, which exactly accords with his mental character;\r\nso that, as far as you can see such modes, you can decipher such outlines\r\nof character.\r\n\r\nTHE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY LAUGHING.\r\n\r\n1. LAUGHTER EXPRESSIVE OF CHARACTER.--Laughter is very expressive of\r\ncharacter. Those who laugh very heartily have much cordiality and\r\nwhole-souledness of character, except that those who laugh heartily at\r\ntrifles have much feeling, yet little sense. Those whose giggles are rapid\r\nbut light, have much intensity of feeling, yet lack power; whereas those\r\nwho combine rapidity with force in laughing, combine them in character.\r\n\r\n2. VULGAR LAUGH.--Vulgar persons always laugh vulgarly, and refined persons\r\nshow refinement in their laugh. Those who ha, ha right out, unreservedly,\r\nhave no cunning, and are open-hearted in everything; while those who\r\nsuppress laughter, and try to control their countenances in it, are more or\r\nless secretive. Those who laugh with their mouths closed are non-committal;\r\nwhile those who throw it wide open are unguarded and unequivocal in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n3. SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER.--Those who, suppressing laughter for a while, burst\r\nforth volcano-like, have strong characteristics, but are well-governed, yet\r\nviolent when they give way to their feelings. Then there is the\r\nintellectual laugh, the love laugh, the horse laugh, the philoprogenitive\r\nlaugh, the friendly laugh, and many other kinds of laugh, each indicative\r\nof corresponding mental developments.\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE MODE OF SHAKING HANDS.\r\n\r\nTHEIR EXPRESSION OF CHARACTER.--Thus, those who give a tame and loose hand,\r\nand shake lightly, have a cold, if not heartless and selfish disposition,\r\nrarely sacrificing much for others, are probably conservatives, and lack\r\nwarmth and {476} soul. But those who grasp firmly, and shake heartily, have\r\na corresponding whole-souledness of character, are hospitable, and will\r\nsacrifice business to friends; while those who bow low when they shake\r\nhands, add deference to friendship, and are easily led, for good or bad, by\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EASY-GOING DISPOSITION.]\r\n\r\nTHE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE MOUTH AND EYES.\r\n\r\n1. DIFFERENT FORMS OF MOUTHS.--Every mouth differs from every other, and\r\nindicates a coincident character. Large mouths express a corresponding\r\nquantity of mentality, while small ones indicate a lesser amount. A\r\ncoarsely-formed mouth indicates power, while one finely-formed indicates\r\nexquisite susceptibilities. Hence small, delicately formed mouths indicate\r\nonly common minds, with very fine feelings and much perfection of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n2. CHARACTERISTICS.--Whenever the muscles about the mouth are distinct, the\r\ncharacter is correspondingly positive, and the reverse. Those who open\r\ntheir mouths wide and frequently, thereby evince an open soul, while closed\r\n{477} mouths, unless to hide deformed teeth, are proportionately secretive.\r\n\r\n3. EYES.--Those who keep their eyes half shut are peek-a-boos and\r\neaves-droppers.\r\n\r\n4. EXPRESSIONS OF THE EYE.--The mere expression of the eye conveys precise\r\nideas of the existing and predominant states of the mentality and\r\nphysiology. As long as the constitution remains unimpaired, the eye is\r\nclear and bright, but becomes languid and soulless in proportion as the\r\nbrain has been enfeebled. Wild, erratic persons have a half-crazed\r\nexpression of eye, while calmness, benignancy, intelligence, purity,\r\nsweetness, love, lasciviousness, anger, and all the other mental\r\naffections, express themselves quite as distinctly by the eye as voice, or\r\nany other mode.\r\n\r\n5. COLOR OF THE EYES.--Some inherit fineness from one parent, and\r\ncoarseness from the other, while the color of the eye generally corresponds\r\nwith that of the skin, and expresses character. Light eyes indicate warmth\r\nof feeling, and dark eyes power.\r\n\r\n6. GARMENTS.--Those, who keep their coats buttoned up, fancy high-necked\r\nand closed dresses, etc., are equally non-communicative, but those who like\r\nopen, free, flowing garments, are equally open-hearted and communicative.\r\n\r\nTHE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE COLOR OF THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n1. DIFFERENT COLORS.--Coarseness and fineness of texture in nature indicate\r\ncoarse and fine-grained feelings and characters, and since black signifies\r\npower, and red ardor, therefore coarse black hair and skin signify great\r\npower of character of some kind, along with considerable tendency to the\r\nsensual; yet fine black hair and skin indicate strength of character, along\r\nwith purity and goodness.\r\n\r\n2. COARSE HAIR.--Coarse black hair and skin, and coarse red hair and\r\nwhiskers, indicate powerful animal passions, together with corresponding\r\nstrength of character; while fine or light, or auburn hair indicates quick\r\nsusceptibilities, together with refinement and good taste.\r\n\r\n3. FINE HAIR.--Fine dark or brown hair indicates the combination of\r\nexquisite susceptibilities with great strength of character, while auburn\r\nhair, with a florid countenance, indicates the highest order of sentiment\r\nand intensity of feeling, along with corresponding purity of character,\r\ncombined with the highest capacities for enjoyment and suffering. {478}\r\n\r\n4. CURLY HAIR.--Curly hair or beard indicates a crisp, excitable, and\r\nvariable disposition, and much diversity of character--now blowing hot, now\r\ncold--along with intense love and hate, gushing, glowing emotions,\r\nbrilliancy, and variety of talent. So look out for ringlets; they betoken\r\nApril weather--treat them gently, lovingly, and you will have the\r\nbrightest, clearest sunshine, and the sweetest, balmiest breezes.\r\n\r\n5. STRAIGHT HAIR.--Straight, even, smooth, and glossy hair indicate\r\nstrength, harmony, and evenness of character, and hearty, whole-souled\r\naffections, as well as a clear head and superior talents; while straight,\r\nstiff, black hair and beard indicate a coarse, strong, rigid,\r\nstraight-forward character.\r\n\r\n6. ABUNDANCE OF HAIR.--Abundance of hair and beard signifies virility and a\r\ngreat amount of character; while a thin beard signifies sterility and a\r\nthinly settled upper story, with rooms to let, so that the beard is very\r\nsignificant of character.\r\n\r\n7. FIERY RED HAIR indicates a quick and fiery disposition. Persons with\r\nsuch hair generally have intense feelings--love and hate intensely--yet\r\ntreat them kindly, and you have the warmest friends, but ruffle them, and\r\nyou raise a hurricane on short notice. This is doubly true of auburn curls.\r\nIt takes but little kindness, however, to produce a calm and render them as\r\nfair as a Summer morning. Red-headed people in general are not given to\r\nhold a grudge. They are generally of a very forgiving disposition.\r\n\r\nSECRETIVE DISPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\n1. A man that naturally wears his hat upon the top or back of the head is\r\nfrank and outspoken; will easily confide and have many confidential\r\nfriends, and is less liable to keep a secret. He will never do you any\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n2. If a man wears his hat well down on the forehead, shading the eyes more\r\nor less, will always keep his own counsel. He will not confide a secret,\r\nand if criminally inclined will be a very dangerous character.\r\n\r\n3. If a lady naturally inclines to high-necked dresses and collars, she\r\nwill keep her secrets to herself if she has any. In courtship or love she\r\nis an uncertainty, as she will not reveal sentiments of her heart. The\r\nsecretive girl, however, usually makes a good housekeeper and rarely gets\r\nmixed into neighborhood difficulties. As a wife she will not be the most\r\naffectionate, nor will she trouble her husband with many of her trials or\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{479}\r\n\r\nDictionary of Medical Terms.\r\n\r\n_Found in this and other works._\r\n\r\n  ABDOMEN--The largest cavity of the body, containing the  liver, stomach,\r\n      intestines, etc.\r\n  ABNORMAL--Unhealthy, unnatural.\r\n  ABORTION--A premature birth, or miscarriage.\r\n  ABSCESS--A cavity containing pus.\r\n  ACETIC--Sour, acid.\r\n  ACIDITY--Sourness.\r\n  ACRID--Irritating, biting.\r\n  ACUTE--Of short duration.\r\n  ADIPOSE--Fatty.\r\n  ALBUMEN--An animal substance resembling white of egg.\r\n  ALIMENTARY CANAL--The entire passage through which food  passes;
