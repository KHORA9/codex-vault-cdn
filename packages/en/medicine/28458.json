in\r\nlife and in all parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese girls have talked freely with me concerning their plans,\r\naspirations, fears and personal problems. It has been a great\r\nrevelation to me to note with what unanimity they ask certain\r\nquestions concerning conduct--queries which perhaps might astonish the\r\nmothers of those same girls, as they, doubtless, take it for granted\r\nthat their daughters intuitively understand these fundamental laws of\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that many girls who have been taught in the \"ologies\" of\r\nthe schools, who have been trained in the conventionalities of\r\nsociety, have been left to pick up as they may their ideas upon\r\npersonal conduct, and, coming face to face with puzzling problems, are\r\nat a loss, and perhaps are led into wrong ways of thinking and\r\nquestionable ways of doing because no one has foreseen their dilemma\r\nand warned them how to meet it.\r\n\r\nThe subjects treated in this little book are discussed because every\r\none of them has been the substance of a query propounded by some girl\r\notherwise intelligent and well informed. They have been treated\r\nplainly and simply because they purport to be the frank conferences of\r\na mother and daughter, between whom there can be no need of hesitation\r\nin dealing frankly with any question bearing on the life, health or\r\nhappiness of the girl. There is therefore no need of apology; the book\r\nis its own excuse for being, the queries of the young women demand\r\nhonest answers.\r\n\r\nLife will be safer for the girl who understands her own nature and\r\nreverences her womanhood, who realizes her responsibility towards the\r\nhuman race and conducts herself in accordance with that realization.\r\n\r\nLife will be nobler and purer in its possession and its transmission,\r\nif, from childhood onward to old age, the thought has been held that\r\n\"Life is a gift of God and is divine,\" and its physical is no less\r\nsacred than its mental or moral manifestation; if it has been\r\nunderstood that the foundations of character are laid in the habits\r\nformed in youth, and that a noble girlhood assures a grand maturity.\r\n\r\nDear girls who read this book, the mother-heart has gone out to you\r\nwith great tenderness with every line herein written, with many an\r\nunspoken prayer that you will be helped, uplifted, inspired by its\r\nreading, and made more and more to feel\r\n\r\n    \"A sacred burden is this life ye bear.\r\n    Look on it, lift it, bear it solemnly;\r\n    Stand up and walk beneath it steadfastly;\r\n    Fail not for sorrow, falter not for sin,\r\n    But onward, upward, till the goal ye win.\"\r\n\r\n                      MARY WOOD-ALLEN.\r\n    ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF HEALTH, AND RESPONSIBILITY IN MAINTAINING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT A YOUNG WOMAN OUGHT TO KNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE YOU WORTH?\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DAUGHTER DEAR:\r\n\r\nWhen I see you with your young girl friends, when I look into your\r\nbright faces and listen to your merry laughter and your girlish\r\nchatter, I wonder if any one of you understands how much you are\r\nworth. Now you may say, \"I haven't any money in the bank, I have no\r\nhouses or land, I am worth nothing,\" but that would only be detailing\r\nwhat you possess. It is not what you possess but what you are that\r\ndetermines what you are worth. One may possess much wealth and be\r\nworth very little.\r\n\r\nI was reading the other day that the first great lesson for a _young\r\nman_ to learn, the first fact to realize, is that he is of some\r\nimportance; that upon his wisdom, energy and faithfulness all else\r\ndepends, and that the world cannot get along without him. Now if this\r\nis true of young men, I do not see why it is not equally true of young\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIt is not after you have grown old that you will be of value to the\r\nworld; it is now, in your young days, while you are laying the\r\nfoundation of your character, that you are of great importance. We\r\ncannot say that the foundation is of no importance until the building\r\nis erected, for upon the right placing of the foundation depends the\r\nfirmness and stability of the superstructure. Dr. Conwell, in his\r\nlittle book, \"Manhood's Morning,\" estimates that there are twelve\r\nmillion young men in the United States between fourteen and\r\ntwenty-eight years of age; that these twelve million young men\r\nrepresent latent physical force enough to dig the iron ore from the\r\nmines, manufacture it into wire, lay the foundation and construct\r\ncompletely the great Brooklyn Bridge in three hours; that they\r\nrepresent force enough, if rightly utilized, to dig the clay from the\r\nearth, manufacture the bricks and construct the great Chinese Wall in\r\nfive days. If each one were to build himself a house twenty-five feet\r\nwide, these houses would line both sides of eight streets reaching\r\nacross the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. For each one to\r\nbe sick one day is equal to thirty thousand being sick an entire year.\r\n\r\nNow, if there are twelve million young men in the United States, we\r\nmay estimate that there are an equal number of young women. Although\r\nwe cannot calculate accurately the amount of physical force\r\nrepresented by these young women, there are some things we can tell.\r\nWe know that for each one of these young women to be sick one day\r\nmeans thirty thousand sick one year. Just imagine the loss to the\r\ncountry, and the gain to posterity if it can be prevented!\r\n\r\nRome endeavored to create good soldiery, but was not able to produce\r\nstrength and courage through physical culture of the men alone. Not\r\nuntil she began the physical education of the women, the young women,\r\nwas she able to insure to the nation a race of strong, hardy, vigorous\r\nsoldiery. So the health of the young women of to-day is of great\r\nimportance to the nation, for upon their vigor and soundness of body\r\ndepend to a very great extent the health and capacity of future\r\ngenerations. We are told that in the State of Massachusetts, in one\r\nyear, there were lost twenty-eight thousand five hundred (28,500)\r\nyears of time through the illness of working-people by preventable\r\ndiseases. Dr. Buck, in his \"Hygiene,\" tells us that one hundred\r\nthousand persons die every year through preventable diseases, that one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand are constantly sick through preventable\r\ndiseases, and that the loss to the nation, through the illness of\r\nworking-people by diseases that might have been prevented, is more\r\nthan a hundred million dollars a year. So we can see that each\r\nindividual has a pecuniary value to the nation. You are worth just as\r\nmuch to the nation as you can earn. If you earn a dollar a day, you\r\nare not only worth a dollar a day to yourself and to your personal\r\nemployer, but you are worth a dollar a day to the nation; and if,\r\nthrough illness, you are laid aside for one day, the nation, as well\r\nas yourself, is pecuniarily the loser.\r\n\r\nYoung women could not build the houses that would line eight streets\r\nfrom New York to San Francisco, but, rightly educated, they could\r\nconvert each one of these houses into a home, and to found a home and\r\nconduct it properly is to help the world. It is so easy to measure\r\nwhat is done with physical strength. We can see what men are doing\r\nwhen they build railroads, construct immense bridges and towering\r\nbuildings, but it is more difficult to measure what is done through\r\nintellectual and spiritual forces; and woman's work in the world is\r\nnot so much the using of strength as it is the using of those finer\r\nforces which go to build up men and women. With this thought in your\r\nmind, can you answer the question, How much are you worth? How much\r\nare you worth to yourself? How much are you worth in your home? How\r\nmuch money would your parents be willing to accept in place of\r\nyourself? How much are you worth to the community in which you live?\r\nHow much are you worth to the state, the nation, the human race?\r\n\r\nYou can recognize your value in the home when you remember how much\r\nyou are the center of all that goes on there, how much your interest\r\nis consulted in everything that is done by father and mother. You can\r\nrealize your value to the state when you realize how much money is\r\nspent for the education of young people, how cultured men and women\r\ngive the best of their lives to your instruction. You cannot measure\r\nyour value to the human race until you begin to think that the young\r\npeople of to-day are creating the condition of the world in fifty or\r\none hundred years to come; that you, through your physical health, or\r\nlack of it, are to become a source of strength or weakness in future\r\nyears, if you are a mother. It is all right that young women should\r\nthink of marriage and motherhood, provided they think of it in the\r\nright way.\r\n\r\nI want you to reverence yourself, to realize your own importance, to\r\nfeel that you are a necessity to God's perfect plan. When we are young\r\nand feel that we are of no account in the world, it is difficult to\r\nrealize that God's complete plan cannot be carried out without us. The\r\nsmallest, tiniest rivet or bolt may be of such great importance in the\r\nconstruction of an engine that its loss means the incapacity of that\r\npiece of machinery to do its work. As God has placed you in the world,\r\nHe has placed you here to do a specific work for Him and for\r\nhumanity, and your failure to do that work means the failure of His\r\ncomplete and perfect plan. Now can you begin to see how much you are\r\nworth? And can you begin to realize that in the conduct of your life\r\nas a young woman you are a factor of immense importance to the great\r\nproblem of the evolution of the human race? In the light of these\r\nthoughts I would like to have you ask yourself this question every\r\nday, How much am I worth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCARE OF BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question \"How much are you worth?\" is not answered by discussing\r\nyour bodily conditions, for your body is not yourself. It is your\r\ndwelling, but not you. It, however, expresses you.\r\n\r\nA man builds a house, and through it expresses himself. The external\r\nappearance causes the observer to form an opinion of him, and each\r\napartment bears the impress of his individuality. To look at the house\r\nand then to walk through it will tell you much of the man. The outside\r\nwill tell you whether he is neat, orderly and artistic, or whether he\r\ncares nothing for the elements of beauty and neatness. If you go into\r\nhis parlor, you can judge whether he cares most for show or for\r\ncomfort. His library will reveal to you the character of his mind, and\r\nthe dining-room will indicate by its furnishings and its viands\r\nwhether he loves the pleasures of sense more than health of body. You\r\ndo not need to see the man to have a pretty clear idea of him.\r\n\r\nSo the body is our house, and our individuality permeates every part\r\nof it. Those who look at our bodily dwelling can gain a very good\r\nidea of what we are. The external appearance will indicate to a great\r\nextent our character. We glance at one man and say, \"He is gross,\r\nsensual, cruel, domineering;\" at another and say, \"He is intellectual,\r\nspiritual, fine-grained, benevolent.\" So we judge of entire strangers,\r\nand usually find the character largely corresponds to our judgment,\r\nif, later, we come to know the person.\r\n\r\nThe anatomist and microscopist who penetrates into the secrets of his\r\nbodily house after the inhabitant has moved out can tell much of his\r\nhabits, his thoughts, his capacities and powers by the traces of\r\nhimself which he has left on the insensate walls of his dwelling. The\r\ncare of the body, then, adds to our value, because it gives us a\r\nbetter instrument, a better medium of expression.\r\n\r\nThe old saying, \"A workman is known by his tools,\" is equally true of\r\nthe body. The carpenter who cares for his saws, chisels and planes,\r\nwho keeps them sharp and free from rust, will be able to do better\r\nwork than the one who carelessly allows them to become nicked, broken,\r\nhandleless or rusted. The finer the work which one does, the greater\r\nthe care he must take of the instruments with which he works. A\r\njack-knife will do to whittle a pine stick, but the carver of\r\nintricate designs must have his various sharp tools with which to make\r\nthe delicate lines and tracings.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of health and physical conditions in discussing the\r\nquestion of your value, we are discussing the instrument upon whose\r\nintegrity depends your ability to demonstrate your value.\r\n\r\nMany young people think it nonsense to pay attention to the\r\npreservation of health. I have heard them say, \"O, I don't want to be\r\nso fussy! It will do for old folks to be coddling themselves, but I\r\nwant a good time. I'd rather die ten years sooner and have some fun\r\nwhile I do live.\"\r\n\r\nI wonder what these same young people would think if they should hear\r\na workman say, \"Well, I have here a fine kit of tools; I am assured\r\nthat if they are destroyed they will never be replaced; but now, while\r\nI am learning my trade, I don't want to be 'so fussy' about keeping\r\nthem in order. It will do for 'boss workmen' to take care of\r\neverything so constantly, but now I want to break stones with these\r\ndelicate hammers, to cut nails with these razor-bladed knives, to\r\ncrack nuts with these slender pincers. By and by, when I am older,\r\nI'll use them as they should be used, but I think it's all nonsense to\r\nbe so careful now.\" If in later years you should hear him complain\r\nthat he had nothing to work with, would you feel like pitying him?\r\n\r\nNo \"kit of tools\" was ever so complete as is the bodily instrument\r\ngiven to each one of us. Its mechanism has been the inspiration of\r\ninventors; it combines all forms of mechanical devices; its delicacy,\r\nintricacy, completeness and adaptability challenge the admiration of\r\nthe philosopher, the engineer, the master mechanic.\r\n\r\nI cannot here tell you of all its wonders,[1] but I would like to give\r\nyou such an exalted idea of its importance that you would look upon it\r\nwith reverence and take a justifiable pride in keeping it in perfect\r\nworking order. I would like to make you feel your personal\r\nresponsibility in regard to its condition.\r\n\r\nYou know that in the ages past men believed the body to be the\r\nindividual, and they endeavored through care of the body to build up\r\nmental as well as physical power. In those days the acrobat and the\r\nsage were found working side by side in the gymnasium, the one to gain\r\nphysical strength, the other to increase his mental ability, and each\r\nprofited as he desired.\r\n\r\nWhen men made the discovery that the body is not the individual, but\r\nmerely his dwelling and instrument of expression, they came to feel\r\nless regard for it, and lost their interest in its care and culture.\r\nEven the early Christians, forgetting what Paul said about the body as\r\na temple, began to call it vile, and thought it an evidence of great\r\npiety to treat it with contempt. I have read of one religious sect who\r\nbelieved that the Creator of the body could not have been the Creator\r\nof the soul, and held that the chief object of God's government was to\r\ndeliver the captive souls of men from their bodily prisons.\r\n\r\nWhen men began to understand that the thinking principle was the real\r\nself and the body merely a material encasement, it was no wonder that\r\nthey valued the body less and held mind as of great value. They failed\r\nto see that mind without a material organ of expression is, in this\r\nworld, of no account. A great pianist with no piano could not make\r\nmusic, and he would be considered a strange being if he did not care\r\nfor his instrument most scrupulously. Think of a Rubinstein\r\nvoluntarily breaking the piano strings or smashing the keys, while he\r\nmade discordant poundings, and excusing himself by saying that it was\r\n\"fussy\" to take care of a piano until it was old. You cannot imagine\r\nsuch a thing. We can all appreciate the value of a man-made instrument\r\nor machine; but the God-created body, a combination of machines and\r\ninstruments of marvelous power and delicacy, we neglect or treat with\r\nabsolute, positive injury, and excuse ourselves on the ground that\r\nwhen it is old we will treat it more kindly.\r\n\r\nMelville says it is a sin to die, ignoring what is to be done with the\r\nbody. \"That body,\" he says, \"has been redeemed, that body has been\r\nappointed to a glorious condition.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me we prize the body far more after its use for us is at\r\nan end than while it is ours to use. We do not neglect the dead; we\r\ndress them in beautiful garments, we adorn them with flowers, we\r\nfollow them to the grave with religious ceremonies, we build costly\r\nmonuments to place over their graves, and then we go to weep over\r\ntheir last resting-place.\r\n\r\nAfter all, is it not life that we should value? Life here and\r\nhereafter, not death, is the real thing for which we should prepare,\r\nand earthly life without a sound body is not life full and complete.\r\nLife is joy, vigor, elasticity, freedom from pain or illness,\r\nenjoyment of all innocent pleasures in maturity as well as in youth.\r\nWe have no right to look forward to decrepitude, to failure in zest of\r\nliving, to lessening of real enjoyment because of coming years. Life\r\nshould increase in beauty and usefulness, in ability and joyousness,\r\nas the years bring us a wider experience, and this will be the case if\r\nwe in youth have been wise enough to lay the foundation of health by a\r\nwise, thoughtful, prudent care of our bodies and our minds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This Dr. Mary Wood-Allen has done in a volume entitled \"Marvels of\r\nOur Bodily Dwelling.\" This book teaches physiology and hygiene, by\r\nmetaphor, parable, and allegory in a most charming way.

If I\r\ncould excite in you an intense longing to visit Paris, I should know\r\nthat you would begin to seek for the way of getting there. If I could\r\ncreate in you an earnest aspiration to be well and physically strong,\r\nI should know that you would seek for the books that would give you\r\nthe necessary instruction. It will not be needful to talk of rules and\r\nrestrictions if I can make you feel the glory of having a sound body.\r\n\r\nIf you were starting on a journey, I should not need to warn you of\r\nby-paths, of traps, or of dangers if I could be assured that your eye\r\nwas fixed upon your ultimate destination. So it is in the matter of\r\nhealth; and yet there are some general rules or principles which I\r\nmight lay down for your consideration.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the matter of diet. I do not want you to be hampered by\r\n\"don'ts\" and restrictions as to what you shall eat, but I do want you\r\nto eat with the thought in view that eating is to be governed by\r\njudgment and not by the pleasures of sense. Why do we eat? Not merely\r\nbecause the food tastes good. There is a better reason. We eat to\r\nlive. We know that the food which we take into our bodies is digested,\r\nelaborated and assimilated--that is, made over into ourselves--and\r\nunless this digestion, elaboration and assimilation is properly\r\nconducted, we shall not be fully and completely nourished. Our body is\r\nmade up of cells; the food which we eat is transformed into cell\r\nstructure, and this new cell-material takes the place of the worn-out\r\ncells. Our reason would tell us that if too little material is\r\nfurnished, cells will not be properly repaired and ill-health will\r\nfollow. Our reason would tell us in the same way that if too much\r\nmaterial is furnished, the machine will be clogged and the work will\r\nnot be properly done. We will also understand at once that an\r\nirregular supply of new material would interfere with the elaboration\r\nof that which is undergoing the process of digestion and assimilation.\r\nWe can see, too, that unless the various tissues receive the material\r\nwhich they can transform into themselves, they will not be fully\r\nrepaired. If material is taken into the system which supplies no\r\ntissue with what it needs, this material becomes a source of\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nThese general rules borne in mind are sufficient to guide us into a\r\nwiser life than if we do not understand them; and, understanding\r\nthese general principles, we will be anxious to study the particular\r\nrules which govern digestion and assimilation.\r\n\r\nI have known young women in college to be so absolutely ignorant or\r\nindifferent to physiological law as to be injuring themselves\r\nconstantly by disobedience of such laws. I knew one girl, supposed to\r\nbe a very fine student, and to have brought on \"fits\" by overstudy,\r\nwhile away at school. I had an opportunity to investigate the case,\r\nand I discovered that she had been eating from morning till night. She\r\ncarried nuts, and candy, and apples in her pocket, had pickles and\r\ncake in her room, and studied and munched until it was no doubt a\r\ndisturbed digestion, rather than an overused brain, that caused the\r\n\"fits.\"\r\n\r\nIf you will eat regularly of plain meat, vegetables, fruits, cereals,\r\nmilk and eggs, plainly prepared, and avoid rich pastries, cakes,\r\npuddings, pickles and sweetmeats, you will have compassed the round of\r\nhealthful diet, and need give yourself very little anxiety in regard\r\nto anything more. I should like to emphasize the fact, however, that\r\ntea and coffee are not foods. They are irritants, stimulants,\r\nnerve-poisons. They bring nothing to the system to build it up. They\r\nsatisfy the sense of hunger without having contributed to the\r\nnourishment of the body. If you are wise you will avoid them. You\r\nwill not create for yourself any false necessities. You will avoid\r\nthe use of alcohol in all forms, whether wine, ales, beer or cider, as\r\nwell as in the stronger forms, because you will know that these\r\nproducts interfere with digestion. Dr. Kellogg, of Battle Creek, has\r\nmade an experiment which proved that sherry to the amount of 1 per\r\ncent. of the contents of the stomach retarded digestion nearly 4 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nHe calculates that 1 per cent. of sherry would be equal to two tenths\r\nof 1 per cent. of alcohol, and it would be necessary to take less than\r\nan ordinary tablespoonful of the wine to obtain this percentage.\r\n\r\nWhen 3 per cent. of claret was used (equivalent to three-tenths of 1\r\nper cent. of alcohol), there was marked diminution in digestive\r\nactivity. This certainly proves that even the so-called light wines\r\nare injurious, and certainly the drinks that contain a large per cent.\r\nof alcohol must be that much more hurtful.\r\n\r\nIf you use good judgment both as to the quality and quantity of foods,\r\nyou need then give the matter very little thought. People sometimes\r\nmake themselves dyspeptics by worrying about what they eat. Eat what\r\nis set before you, making a judicious choice both as to variety and\r\nquantity, and then determine that your food shall digest.\r\n\r\nWhen you live upon the higher plane of thought, you will not be so\r\nmuch interested in the question of food as regards gustatory\r\npleasure. You will understand that eating is a necessity, but you will\r\nnot be thinking about it; you will not be desiring to please the sense\r\nof taste; you will see that there are higher forms of sociability than\r\nmere eating with friends, and you will not be so interested in late\r\nsuppers, and in various forms of sense gratification because you enjoy\r\nmore thoroughly the higher pleasures. You will serve your friends with\r\ndelicate food, simply and daintily prepared, and seasoned with that\r\nwit and wisdom which remain as a permanent mental pabulum. You will\r\nmake them feel that when you come to visit them you come not to get\r\nsomething to eat, but to enjoy them, to receive from them the\r\ninspiration which they can give. We often treat our friends as if we\r\nthought they came as beggars for physical food. It is a much higher\r\ncompliment to treat them as though we thought they came to exchange\r\nthoughts with us, to walk with us in the higher paths of living, and\r\nthat the physical food we give them is only incidental. I was once\r\nentertained where a company of intelligent, cultured people were\r\nassembled, and we did not see the hostess from the time we entered the\r\nhouse until supper was served. She sat at the table, worried and\r\nanxious, and after the supper was over she did not make her appearance\r\nuntil just as we were about to leave. She did not pay us the high\r\ncompliment of giving us herself, but she bestowed upon us that which a\r\nhired cook might have given.\r\n\r\nYou remember what Emerson says: \"I pray you, O excellent wife, cumber\r\nnot yourself and me to get a curiously rich dinner for this man and\r\nwoman who have just alighted at our gate. These things, if they desire\r\nthem, they can get for a few shillings at any village inn; but rather\r\nlet that stranger see, if he will, in your looks, accents and\r\nbehavior, your heart and earnestness, your thought and will, that\r\nwhich he cannot buy at any price in any city, and which he may travel\r\nmiles and dine sparely and sleep hardly to behold.\"\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be worth your while to study food scientifically, to\r\nknow how to prepare dainty and tempting dishes wholesomely, and then\r\nto serve your guests with such beauty of manner, such graciousness of\r\ncourtesy, that they will remember the meal they have taken with you as\r\nidyllic in its simplicity, beauty and helpfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSLEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\nShakespeare writes of \"Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve of\r\ncare.\" The metaphor is striking, but not accurate. To knit up that\r\nwhich is ravelled implies using the old material in repairing the\r\ndamage, but that is not the way in which the body is rebuilt. The old\r\nmaterial is thrown out and new material put in its place, and that\r\nlargely takes place during sleep. We have read of brownies who came at\r\nnight and swept and churned and baked while the housewife slept. So,\r\nin our bodily dwelling, the vital forces are our brownies, and they\r\ncan work more uninterruptedly while we are asleep than when we are\r\ncalling on them to move us from place to place, or to aid us in\r\nvarious activities.\r\n\r\nMuch of life's processes must remain a mystery to us, but certain\r\nthings we have learned, and one is that perfect health cannot be\r\nmaintained, strong nerves cannot be constructed, nor a clear brain be\r\nbuilt without plenty of sleep. The baby sleeps almost continually\r\nbecause he is building so much new structure. The growing child needs\r\nmore sleep than the adult; but even after reaching maturity sleep\r\ncannot be materially lessened without injury to the whole\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the need of food. We are often very needlessly alarmed\r\nfor fear that we shall starve from one meal to the next, but few of us\r\nrealize that food cannot be assimilated, built into tissue, without\r\nsome hours in which the vital forces can devote themselves wholly to\r\nthe work of assimilation. During the working hours of the day we are\r\nexpending force. The brain is using it in thought, the muscles are\r\ncalling for force in various activities, the emotions are expending\r\nenergy, and each of these activities is creating changes in the cells\r\nof the body. We know that life in the body is only possible through\r\nconstant death of the atoms of which it is composed. We can only live\r\nbecause we are constantly dying. Huxley says, \"For every vital act,\r\nlife is used up. All work implies waste, and the work of life results\r\ndirectly or indirectly in the waste of protoplasm (which is the cell\r\nsubstance). Every word uttered by a speaker costs him some physical\r\nloss, and in the strictest sense he burns that others may have light.\"\r\n\r\nEach word, thought, activity, emotion causes expenditure, and unless\r\nexpenditure is in some way made good, there will be bankruptcy. How\r\nshall we get back the energy we have expended and so restore our vital\r\nforces to their equilibrium? The protoplasm of which our cells are\r\nmade we can obtain from the protoplasm of animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances which we eat, but we cannot use the material unless we are\r\nsometimes at rest, and by quiescence of brain and muscle give a chance\r\nfor worn-out cells to be removed and new material put in their place.\r\nIt is when we lay our bodies down in the beautiful repose of slumber\r\nthat this process can go on with most perfect results. Then, when all\r\nthe forces can be concentrated on the process of nutrition, will\r\nnutrition be most perfect. When we awake refreshed after a night of\r\nsound sleep we are really fed. It is quite doubtful if, in a normal\r\ncondition, we would want food until we had been at work some time and\r\nby destroying tissue have created a demand for more new material.\r\n\r\nIf we were only half as anxious that food should be assimilated--that\r\nis, made over into ourselves--as we are that it should be put into the\r\nstomach, we would be very careful to secure for ourselves a due amount\r\nof good sleep. And what is a due amount? That depends. I once heard of\r\na servant girl whose mistress complained of her because she did not\r\nget up early in the morning, and the girl's excuse was, \"But, ma'am, I\r\ncan't get up early because I sleep so slow.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems a ridiculous statement, and yet there is a germ of truth in\r\nit. In some people the vital processes go on with such rapidity that\r\nthe old, worn-out material will be eliminated and the new material\r\nbuilt into the body in a comparatively short time. Seven hours of good\r\nsleep, perhaps, make them feel strong and rested and able to start on\r\na new day's work with courage and ease. In others the vital processes\r\nare hindered or work feebly and slowly, and eight or nine hours of\r\nsleep scarcely suffice to complete the work of restoration. What is\r\nthe obvious inference? Simply that each one shall judge for himself;\r\nbut each should be wise enough not to confuse sleeplessness with\r\nhaving had sufficient sleep.\r\n\r\nVery frequently the loss of sleep makes it difficult or impossible to\r\nsleep, and not until the excited condition of nerves can be calmed,\r\ncan refreshing slumber be obtained. Young women who attempt to be in\r\nschool and in society at the same time often bring themselves into the\r\ncondition of insomnia or sleeplessness, and foolishly fancy that\r\nbecause they do not sleep they do not need it.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all difficult to understand that if you are constantly\r\ntaking money out of the bank, you must also be constantly putting\r\nmoney in, or some day you will be told that your account is already\r\noverdrawn and your draft will not be honored. One can overdraw for a\r\ntime, and right here is the danger with young people. They fancy,\r\nbecause they are not at once told that they are overdrawing, that\r\ntheir bank account is unlimited, and then, when it is too late, they\r\nfind themselves on the verge, if not clear over the verge, of\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nHow shall you know whether you sleep enough? If you will make it a\r\nrule to go to bed by ten o'clock every night, and go to sleep at once,\r\nand sleep soundly and waken with a clear head and a rested feeling,\r\nyou may infer that you have slept enough. If you are still tired or\r\ndull, something is wrong. You may have been in bed long enough, but\r\nyour room may not have been ventilated, and so you may be poisoned by\r\nbreathing over and over again the emanations from your own body. Or\r\nfor some reason the process of digestion and assimilation may not have\r\nbeen carried on, and poisons have been created instead of being\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\nIf you waken unrefreshed, I should want to inquire into your habits of\r\nlife. Was there opportunity for fresh air to enter your room? Was\r\nthere in it no uncovered vessel, no old shoes in the closet, no soiled\r\nunderclothing, nothing that could contaminate the atmosphere? Did you\r\neat a hearty supper late in the evening? Is your system oppressed with\r\na superabundance of sweets? Are you living on simple, wholesome food,\r\nor eating irregularly of all sorts of trash? There may be many causes,\r\nyou see, for your \"tired feeling\" in the morning, and instead of\r\ntaking some \"Sarsaparilla,\" or other drug, I should try to find out\r\nthe cause and remove it.\r\n\r\nMany people are afraid of night air, and scrupulously shut it out of\r\ntheir sleeping-rooms, and yet, what kind of air can you get at night\r\nbut night air? And is it not better to have pure night air from out of\r\ndoors than the impure night air of a close room? I once went with two\r\nladies to ascend the Rigi in Switzerland, in order to see the sun\r\nrise. One of these was a Polish countess, who took with her a little\r\nblack-and-tan terrier. The hotel at the Rigi Staeffel was crowded, and\r\nwe thought ourselves very fortunate to secure a room with three beds.\r\nThe Countess disposed herself in one bed with her little dog, and I\r\ntook one bed, saying to my friend, \"You'll please open the window\r\nbefore you go to bed?\" \"O certainly,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nThe little Countess sprang up in evident alarm. \"Open the window!\" she\r\ncried; \"why, we'd all take our death of cold! I beg of you don't do\r\nit. I could not sleep a wink if the window were open.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend spoke reassuringly to her, and she at length grew quiet,\r\nwhen my friend surreptitiously raised a window and we went to sleep.\r\nThe next morning the Countess asked, with a strange air of\r\nincredulity, \"Were you in earnest when you spoke about opening the\r\nwindow? Why, I never heard of such a thing in my life. I know I\r\nshould have been ill if you had persisted in having the window open.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend and I exchanged glances silently. We knew she was not ill\r\nand she had slept with the window open, but doubtless she would have\r\nbeen ill had she known it was open, for she had a wonderful\r\nimagination. When we were called at three o'clock to get up and go to\r\nthe top of the mountain to see the sun rise, she turned herself\r\nluxuriously in her bed and said she could imagine it. She had taken\r\nthis journey and \"climbed the mountain\" (that is, was carried up in a\r\nchair, with her dog in her lap), to see the famous sunrise on the\r\nRigi, and then remained in bed and imagined it! Her imagination seemed\r\nentirely satisfactory, and so we did not quarrel with her.\r\n\r\nSleep is the most positive beautifier, the best cosmetic. The term\r\n\"beauty sleep\" is no misnomer. Sleep freshens the complexion, smoothes\r\nout wrinkles, clears out the brain, strengthens the muscles, puts\r\nlight into the eyes and color into the cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nBREATHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing you did when you came into this world was to inspire,\r\nthat is, to breathe in. The last thing you will do will be to expire,\r\nthat is, to breathe out. And between your first inspiration and your\r\nlast expiration there will have been the process of respiration, that\r\nis, breathing in and out at an average rate of twenty times a minute.\r\nTwenty times a minute means twelve hundred times an hour, or nearly\r\nthirty thousand times a day, or over ten million times a year. If you\r\nshould live to be fifty years old, you will have breathed in and out\r\nover five hundred million times. We eat three times a day, twenty-one\r\ntimes a week, over a thousand times a year, fifty thousand times in\r\nfifty years, but we breathe over five hundred million times in fifty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWe realize the importance of eating, but we can live days without\r\nfood. On the other hand, we cannot live many seconds entirely without\r\nair. We must infer from all this that breathing is more important than\r\neating. How can it be? From our food our body is rebuilt. What\r\nlife-process is accomplished by breathing?\r\n\r\nTo understand this, we must learn what processes are going on in the\r\nbody, by means of which food is converted into tissue, into heat and\r\nenergy. These processes we find are chemical, and may be likened to\r\nthe combustion of wood or coal in the furnace. We know that fire must\r\nhave air in order to burn. Burning is the process of oxidation or\r\ncombustion of oxygen with the atoms of fuel and the formation of a new\r\nsubstance thereby. Coal, we are told, consists of carbon and nitrogen,\r\nboth of which readily combine with oxygen, and in the process of\r\nuniting heat is liberated, and waste compounds thus formed pass off\r\nthrough the smokestack or chimney. We may not understand this\r\nscientifically, but we know that if we want the fire to burn well we\r\nmust give it draft or air.\r\n\r\nOur bodies are living engines, and use food and air instead of coal\r\nand air. Food in the body without air is like the coal in an engine\r\nwithout air; and air is useful only because it brings oxygen to unite\r\nchemically with the food. This process is going on all over the body.\r\nEach little microscopical cell is a furnace in which oxidation is\r\ntaking place; and not only is energy liberated, but reconstructive\r\nprocesses are going on, new tissues are being formed, and old tissues\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nBut how can the oxygen get to the cells in all parts of the body? We\r\ncan readily see how it gets to the air-cells of the lungs, but it\r\nwould do little good if it stopped there. It must be carried in some\r\nway to all the minutest cells of all the tissues. This is done through\r\nthe breathing. The blood goes to the lungs, and there it gives out the\r\nwaste material it has collected in its journey through the body and\r\ntakes up oxygen. The blood goes to the lungs dark in color from its\r\nload of waste. It is changed to a bright red by taking up oxygen. Each\r\nred blood-corpuscle takes a load of oxygen, carries it to its\r\ndestination, and gives it to some tissue to be used up in the chemical\r\nprocess of oxidation, upon which depends our life and energy. During\r\nthe hours of rest the tissues are busy in this process, and during\r\nexercise the energy stored up in the tissue-cells is liberated and\r\nwaste created. So we see that the process is a continual round of\r\ntaking food and air, using them in rebuilding tissue, then using up\r\nthe tissue by exercise and casting out the waste products. And now we\r\ncan begin to understand that we live in proportion as we breathe. Dr.\r\nHolbrook says: \"The activity of the child is in close relation to the\r\nstrength of its lungs; so, too, is the calmness, dignity and power of\r\na man in proportion to the depth and tranquility of his respiration.\r\nIf the lungs are strong and active, there is courage and boldness; if\r\nfeeble, there is cowardice and debility. To be out of spirits is to be\r\nout of breath. To be animated and joyous is to be full of breath.\"\r\n\"Breathing,\" writes Dr. von der Deeken, \"is an actual vivifying act,\r\nand the need of breath as felt is a real life-hunger and a proof that\r\nwithout the continual charging of the blood-column with the proper\r\nforce, all the other vital organs would soon stagnate and cease action\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\nNow I wonder how many young women really know how to breathe. \"Why,\"\r\nyou say, \"we have always breathed!\" And I reply, \"So you have, to some\r\nextent; but do you really breathe, or do you just let a little current\r\nof air flow gently through a part of your lungs, not reaching the\r\nminute air-cells at all, or have you crippled a large part of your\r\nlung-power by the restrictions of tight clothing?\" Now you shrug your\r\nshoulders and say, with a little irritation, perhaps, \"O, now she is\r\ngoing to scold about corsets and tight-lacing, and I do not wear my\r\nclothes tight.\" But I am not now going to talk of lacing; I am going\r\nto talk about singing, and speaking, and real living. The highest\r\nclass of living creatures are those that have most power to breathe.\r\nThe cold-blooded animals breathe little, and are slow-moving creatures\r\nwith deficient sensation and small powers of action. Man has large\r\nlung-capacity and should be full of life and power, and will be, if he\r\nunderstands himself. One benefit of exercise is the added impulse\r\ngiven to the heart and lungs, calling for more breath, and bringing\r\nmore blood to the lungs to receive the added supply of oxygen.\r\n\r\nIf we were wise we would practise the art of deep, voluntary\r\nbreathing, as a daily form of gymnastics. What would it do for us?\r\nWonderful things, if we may believe the doctors. Even in the old Greek\r\nand Roman times the doctors recommended deep breathing, the voluntary\r\nholding of air in the lungs, believing that this exercise cleansed the\r\nsystem of impurities and gave strength. And all our scientific\r\ndiscoverers have proven that they were right, and modern doctors have\r\nonly learned more of the process and added to the wisdom of the\r\nancients. Professor Lehwess says that he uses deep breathing not only\r\nas a health remedy but as a cure for muscular convulsions, especially\r\nchronic spasms; and he says that he bases his method for the cure of\r\nstuttering mainly upon respiratory and vocal exercises, \"whereby,\" he\r\nsays, \"we work on enervated muscles, and make their function bring\r\nthem into permanent activity and make them obedient to our will.\" Thus\r\nnot only will the respiratory system be enlarged and quickened, and\r\nthe lungs strengthened, but the blood circulation is promoted and\r\nthose injurious influences overcome which often take away the\r\nstutterer's courage for speaking.\r\n\r\nDr. Niemeyer, of Leipzig, urges breathing in these words: \"Prize air;\r\nuse good, pure air; breathe fresh air in your room by night and day.\"\r\nDr. Bicking says that respiratory gymnastics are the only effectual\r\nremedy for pulmonary affection, especially for consumption. The\r\nMarquise Ciccolina claims that by the teaching of breathing gymnastics\r\nshe has cured people of a tendency to take cold easily; she has\r\nbenefited cases of lung and heart trouble, and she has cured nervous\r\nasthma even in cases that have lasted from childhood to maturity. Dr.\r\nKitchen asserts that if the various structures of the body, including\r\nthe lungs, are in a sufficiently healthy state, consumption cannot\r\nfind a soil in which to commence its ravages, or, if already\r\ncommenced, can be cured by attention to the general health, by pure\r\nair and deep breathing.\r\n\r\nAll this proves that the breathing is of great importance--of just as\r\nmuch importance to women as to men. It used to be thought that women\r\nbreathe naturally with the upper part of the chest and men with the\r\nabdominal muscles, but we have now learned that in the breathing of\r\nboth men and women the diaphragm should be used and the lower part of\r\nthe chest expanded. The breathing should neither be thoracic--that is,\r\nwith the upper part of the chest--nor abdominal. It should be\r\ndiaphragmatic; that is, with the expansion of the sides of the lower\r\npart of the chest, thus filling every air-cell and bringing the\r\nlife-giving oxygen to the blood. The importance of the diaphragm as\r\nthe breathing muscle cannot be overestimated. A diaphragm, you know,\r\nis a partition across a cylinder; the diaphragm is a muscular\r\npartition across the cylinder of the body, dividing the lungs from the\r\nabdomen. In breathing, the diaphragm becomes tense, and in becoming\r\ntense becomes also flattened, just as an umbrella does by being\r\nopened. In fact the opening and shutting of an umbrella gives a very\r\ngood idea of the motion of the diaphragm in breathing. We can realize,\r\nthen, how much larger around the body will be when the lungs are fully\r\ninflated than it is when we breathe the air out and the lungs are\r\nempty. A few minutes spent each day in exercising in diaphragmatic\r\nbreathing would be of great advantage in increasing beauty of form, in\r\ngiving strength and power to the voice, in improving the complexion\r\nand adding to the health, and therefore to the happiness. In taking\r\nthese exercises, one should either stand erect or lie flat upon the\r\nback and draw the air in through the nose, keeping the mouth closed.\r\nDraw in gently, allowing the chest to expand at the sides, hold the\r\nair for a little time, and then breathe out slowly.\r\n\r\nThese exercises performed in a room that is well ventilated, or,\r\nbetter still, in the pure air of outdoors, will do much toward driving\r\naway headaches, clearing the brain, giving better judgment, stronger\r\nwill, and a clearer, happier, brighter disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHINDRANCES TO BREATHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little conversation will be on the hindrances to deep breathing,\r\nfor if we make up our minds that it is so important to breathe deeply\r\nwe shall be very anxious to know how to avoid the hindrances to deep\r\nbreathing. First, let me speak of attitude. If you study physiology\r\nand note the arrangement of the internal organs, you will very easily\r\nsee that when the body is compressed in a sitting attitude there must\r\nbe a hindrance to full and deep breathing. The girl who is running the\r\ntypewriter or the sewing-machine, or the girl who is working as\r\nbookkeeper or stenographer, or the girl at her studies, is sitting so\r\nthat it will not be possible to breathe deeply, for the lungs are\r\nencroached upon by the crowding together of the other _viscera_ (which\r\nmeans the vital organs) and the action of the breathing muscles is\r\nimpeded by compression. As you will readily observe, there can be no\r\nlifting of the chest in this compressed attitude, no complete\r\nflattening of the diaphragm, no full inflation of the minute\r\nair-cells; therefore, as we have learned, the blood is not thoroughly\r\npurified, and actual poisons created by the vital processes\r\naccumulate in the brain and tissues until you feel overpoweringly\r\nweary and stupid. You cannot think, because you cannot fully breathe.\r\n\r\nYou have often found, when sewing, that the machine would get, as you\r\nsay, bewitched. It wouldn't feed, the thread would break or the needle\r\nwould snap, and the whole work go wrong. Put the machine away, take a\r\nrest, and the next day, without doing anything at all to the machine,\r\nyou find that it runs perfectly. The trouble was with yourself. It is\r\nso with the girl who is running the typewriter. She finds that it\r\nmakes mistakes in spelling, things go wrong altogether. It \"acts up,\"\r\nas she would say. So with the girl who is bookkeeper. The figures will\r\nnot add themselves up right. Now if, under these circumstances, the\r\ngirl would get up, go to the door, take a few deep breaths and expand\r\nthe lungs fully, she would relieve the internal congestion consequent\r\nupon the cramped position, the brain would be freed from the\r\naccumulated poison, and as a consequence the troublesome problems\r\nwould soon be solved, the typewriter would spell correctly, the\r\nfigures would add themselves up accurately, and life would become\r\nbrighter at once. Five minutes spent each hour in deep breathing of\r\npure air would add both to the quality and quantity of work done, and\r\nso be a saving of time. This certainly is of great value to you in\r\nyour work in the world.\r\n\r\nAfter working-hours are over, the girl should make a special effort to\r\nsit erect for other reasons than that of breathing, though that is\r\nreason enough.\r\n\r\nBut wrong sitting-postures are not the only attitudes that interfere\r\nwith deep breathing. Very often the position in standing is also\r\nobjectionable. When one stands with the weight resting on the heels\r\nthe body is thrown out of balance, and as a consequence the shoulders\r\nare not on a vertical line with the hips. In this attitude it is\r\nimpossible to manifest fullness of life, because the lungs are not\r\nfully inflated with air at each breath. We live, enjoy, accomplish\r\nonly in proportion to our breathing ability. As one writer says, \"The\r\ndeep thinker, the orator, the fine singer, must of necessity be a good\r\nbreather.\"\r\n\r\nThe most serious hindrance to deep breathing is found in the\r\nrestrictions of the clothing. I do not say of the corsets, because\r\ntight bands or waists can also compress the body and make full\r\nbreathing impossible. Of course you say your dresses are loose, and\r\nyou run your hand up under your waist to prove it to me. I will not\r\nargue the question with you, but I will ask you to argue it with\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nIf breathing is the measure of your living and doing, then if, in the\r\nleast degree, you limit by your dress your breathing, the dress is too\r\ntight. \"Well,\" you ask \"how shall I know if I am hindering my\r\nbreathing? My dress feels comfortable. It seems to me that I breathe.\r\nIs there any way that I can prove whether my dress is tight or not?\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that one becomes accustomed to uncomfortable things and\r\nscarcely realizes that they ever were uncomfortable. The dress may\r\nseem a little tight when you first put it on, then it begins to grow\r\ncomfortable, and after a while it feels loose, and you say it\r\ncertainly is loose. I will give a simple rule by which you may know\r\nwhether your clothing is loose enough or not. Unfasten every article\r\nof clothing; dress, corset, skirt-bands, everything. Now breathe in\r\nslowly until every air-cell is full. It may take some practice to do\r\nthis, but persevere until you find the chest elevated and filled to\r\nits utmost extent. It should swell out at the sides along the line of\r\nthe insertion of the diaphragm. There should be no heaving of the\r\nchest. Now, with the lungs so completely filled with air, bring your\r\ndress waist together without pulling a particle. Will it fasten\r\nwithout pressing out a bit of air from the lungs? If so, it is loose\r\nenough. If, however, you have to pull it together, even to the tiniest\r\nextent, you have pressed out some of the air. The minute air-cells\r\nthat have thus been emptied cannot be again filled while the dress is\r\nfastened. Therefore you are defrauded of your rightful amount of air,\r\nand because part of the air is pressed out, the lungs take less space\r\nand the dress seems looser. You can understand how that would be.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that our dresses are usually fitted over empty lungs.\r\nThe dressmaker pulls the dress together, squeezes the air out of the\r\nlungs, and fastens the dress. Now you can readily understand that it\r\nwill be impossible to fill those air-cells so long as the dress is\r\nworn, and yet it may not seem uncomfortable, because we become\r\naccustomed to it. Nature has made us so that we can accustom ourselves\r\nto many things that are not absolutely healthful, but this should not\r\nmake us willing to live unhealthfully when it is possible to avoid\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nADDED INJURIES FROM TIGHT CLOTHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have talked of the effect of tight clothing upon the breathing\r\npower. Let us see what other injuries arise from wearing the dress too\r\ntight. In the first place, the action of the heart is impeded. The\r\nheart is a hollow muscle which must be continually filled with blood\r\nand emptied again many times a minute from the moment of birth till\r\nthe moment of death. You have been lying down for an hour; let me\r\ncount your pulse. Now sit up for a few moments. I find, now, that it\r\nbeats faster. Now stand up, and it beats still faster. You see, it\r\nincreases continually as you get into the erect position. Now walk\r\nquickly across the floor and you will see how much it has increased\r\nagain in rapidity.\r\n\r\nYou will realize how much the dress interferes with the action of the\r\nheart better from an illustration. Professor Sargent made an\r\nexperiment with a number of girls. One day they were dressed in\r\nperfectly loose clothing. He counted the pulse of each. It beat on the\r\naverage of eighty-four times in a minute. He had them run five hundred\r\nand forty yards in the space of two and a half minutes. The pulse was\r\nagain counted. It had increased to one hundred and fifty-six beats in\r\na minute. This illustrates the effect of exercise even in loose\r\nclothing. The next day at the same time, dressed with a corset which\r\nreduced the waist to twenty-four inches, they ran the same distance in\r\nthe same length of time, and then he found that the pulse had run up\r\nto one hundred and sixty-eight beats in a minute, showing how much\r\nharder it was for the heart to do its work when restricted by tight\r\nclothing. No acrobat would attempt to perform feats of strength or of\r\nagility if restricted even so much as by a belt.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Government has issued an edict that the soldiers must wear\r\ntheir pantaloons held up by suspenders, for it has been demonstrated\r\nthat when they wear them supported by a belt around the waist they are\r\nnot able to do a fair amount of work. The Austrian Government has also\r\ndecreed that the pantaloons of soldiers are not to be suspended by\r\nbelts because of the increase of kidney difficulty caused thereby.\r\n\r\nWe will understand why kidney difficulty is caused by tight clothing\r\nwhen we study the location of the kidneys and how they are affected by\r\ncompression of the ribs. Most people think the kidneys lie low down in\r\nthe back, but in reality they lie up under the short ribs, and the\r\npressure of tight clothing brings the ribs to bear directly upon the\r\nkidneys, injuring them in such a way as often to cause disease.\r\n\r\nThe heart and lungs are protected by a bony framework called the\r\nthorax, but below the thorax there is no protection for the internal\r\norgans except that of the muscles, therefore the corset or tight\r\nclothing can do most damage to the vital organs below the diaphragm.\r\nThe largest of these is the liver. It should lie close up under the\r\ndiaphragm, from which it is suspended. Under the influence of tight\r\nclothing it is often pressed over on the right side, sometimes\r\nextending over the whole front of the body, or even as low down as the\r\nnavel. It is rutted by the pressure of the ribs. The corset liver is\r\nwell known in the dissecting-room. Sometimes, where corsets are not\r\nworn and tight skirts are worn, supported by the hips, the liver has\r\nalmost been cut in two, the pieces being only held together by a\r\nsufficient band of tissue to keep them from dying.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiram Powers, the great sculptor, was in this country, he once\r\nattended an elegant party, and was observed watching very intently a\r\nbeautifully dressed, fashionable woman. A friend, noticing his\r\ninterest, said to him, \"What an elegant figure she has, hasn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Powers, \"I was wondering where she put her liver.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, Powers had studied the human body, and when he saw such an\r\noutline as the figure of a fashionable woman, he knew that some\r\ninternal organ must be displaced in order to create that tapering\r\nwaist, and his anxiety was for the internal organs. As an artist he\r\ndid not admire the tapering waist, as is shown by the beautiful marble\r\nstatue which he made. No artist would perpetuate in marble the figure\r\nof the fashionable woman.\r\n\r\nNot only is the liver thus displaced, but the stomach is often pressed\r\nout of its original position, which should be also close up under the\r\ndiaphragm, towards the left side. By the pressure of clothing it is\r\nsometimes pushed down until it lies in the abdominal cavity, even as\r\nlow down as the navel. This is the statement of Dr. J.H. Kellogg, who,\r\nin his sanitarium at Battle Creek, examines hundreds, or even\r\nthousands of women in a year, and asserts that it is almost impossible\r\nto find a woman whose stomach is where it belongs. This is a serious\r\nmatter, because no organ can do its work properly when it is out of\r\nits rightful position. We understand this in any machinery except that\r\nof the human body. We would not meddle with a man-made machine because\r\nthat would hinder its perfect working, but we do not hesitate to\r\ninterfere with the body, forgetful that it, too, is a machine,\r\ndivinely created, and with powers most fateful to us for weal or woe.\r\n\r\nBut the harm is not all done by the displacement of the organs\r\nmentioned. The bowels suffer, and we can best understand what is done\r\nto them when we understand how they are placed in the abdominal\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nLet me take the ruffle you are making. The mesentery is a delicate,\r\nnarrow membrane about twenty feet long. We will compare it to the\r\nruffle. Folded in it at one edge are the small intestines, just as I\r\ncan run this bodkin into the hem of this ruffle. The other edge of the\r\nmesentery is gathered up as you have gathered the ruffle. It is\r\ngathered into a space of about six inches in length, and is fastened\r\nup and down the spine in the region of the small of the back. You can\r\nsee, if I gather up twenty feet of this ruffle into a space of six\r\ninches, how the mesentery, with the intestines folded in the free\r\nedge, are held in the abdominal cavity. They are held loosely, and at\r\nthe same time so that the intestines cannot be tied in knots or loops\r\nupon each other. In this way the ruffle flares out into the abdominal\r\ncavity. The intestines should stay in their place close up under the\r\nliver and stomach, but if pressure is brought to bear around the body\r\nat this point, the bowels begin to sag into the abdominal cavity. The\r\nabdominal walls lose their tonicity because they are so compressed\r\nthat they cannot have a perfect circulation, the bowels sink down\r\nstill further into the pelvis, and pull upon their attachment in the\r\nsmall of the back, creating backache. The stomach sags down into the\r\ncavity; the liver sinks, and all the organs pull upon their\r\nattachments; so it is no wonder that women have backaches and\r\nheadaches, and their eyes feel bad, and they are unable to stand or\r\nwalk. We don't want small rooms in our dwelling-houses, we don't like\r\nit if we haven't sufficient space for our furniture; but in this\r\nbodily house in which we dwell we are quite willing to constrict the\r\nrooms in which the vital organs or furniture are placed, until\r\neverything is huddled together in the closest pressure, so that the\r\norgans are unable to do their work. It wouldn't matter in our parlors\r\nif the chairs and tables were huddled close together, for they are not\r\nconstantly changing in size, but it does matter in a room where\r\nmachines must have space to work and such space is not permitted them;\r\nand we cannot expect good work where we crowd machinery so that it\r\ndoes not have adequate room.\r\n\r\nThe influence of tight clothing upon the pelvic organs is to displace\r\nthem and create a great many difficulties which we know as \"Female\r\nDiseases.\" But these, in my opinion, are not the most important\r\nthings. The important things are the displacement of the vital organs\r\nof the body--those organs without which we cannot live, and those\r\norgans the perfect working of which is necessary both to our health\r\nand our happiness. If we are wise we will be exceedingly anxious that\r\nevery vital organ shall be allowed to hold its own position, to do\r\nits own work, with plenty of room.\r\n\r\nThe impeding of the heart-action by tight clothing is not in itself\r\nthe most serious effect of this restriction. The serious trouble is in\r\nthe disturbance of the circulation. Upon a perfect circulation depends\r\nperfect nutrition. The blood must go in sufficient quantity to every\r\norgan in order that it may be fully nourished. When the waist is\r\ncompressed the organs do not receive their full amount of blood. It is\r\nretained, and therefore the organs are congested. The feet are cold\r\nbecause the blood does not reach them in sufficient quantity, and the\r\nbrain, it may be, is hot, because the blood is not taken from the head\r\nwith enough rapidity and furnished to the other organs. So we find\r\nthat tight clothing interferes with the integrity and health of every\r\norgan in the body, and consequently with our happiness and with our\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nThe reason we admire the tapering waist is because we have been\r\nwrongly educated. We have acquired wrong ideas of beauty. We have\r\naccepted the ideals of the fashion-plate rather than those of the\r\nCreator. We find that some form of physical deformity maintains in\r\nalmost every country. The Chinese deform the feet, and we think this\r\nis barbarous, but it is really not as serious as the deforming of the\r\nvital parts of the body. The Flathead Indian is deformed in babyhood\r\nby being compressed between boards until the head changes its shape.\r\nAmong some savage nations the leg is bandaged for a few inches above\r\nthe ankle and for a few inches below the knee and the central part is\r\nallowed to expand as it will, and this deformity to them constitutes\r\nbeauty. Among other nations, holes are made in the ears and pieces of\r\nwood are inserted. The size of these pieces is gradually increased\r\nuntil the lobe of the ear will hang down upon the shoulder and a piece\r\nof wood as large as a man's arm be worn in the ears. All of these\r\nthings seem to us most horrible; yet, after all, they are not as much\r\nan insult to the Divine Architect of the body as the deformity\r\npractised by civilized and so-called Christian people, who by\r\nrestriction of the waist interfere with the vital organs and prevent\r\nthe body from being perfect in its development, or perfect in its\r\naction. The activity of the body is an evidence of its life, and if it\r\nis so tied up that it cannot be active, it certainly is not in the\r\nfullest condition of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou said to me, my daughter, that you wanted to join the class in\r\nPhysical Culture. I asked you why, and you said because you thought\r\nyou needed to build up in certain parts of the body. You were\r\ndefective in muscular development; you needed also to acquire grace,\r\nyou thought. And I said, \"Is muscular development the primary object\r\nof physical education?\" You seemed to think that it is. Now I want to\r\ntalk to you a little along that line, and to demonstrate to you, if I\r\ncan, that physical education is not primarily for the building up of\r\nbig muscle, or for the gaining of power to do great feats of bodily\r\nstrength or skill. The object of physical education is to develop a\r\nquickly responsive, flexible instrument for the soul to use, for that\r\nis what the body is. Physical culture, rightly conducted, aims to\r\nsecure the highest condition of the body through the exercises that\r\nare required by the laws of the body. Law, physical law, governs the\r\nbody, and exercise should be according to this law. The first object\r\nof exercise is to make a vital supply for the whole body. This is\r\nfirst secured by proper attitude. If we stand or sit properly we gain\r\na proper position of the vital organs, and then they will do their\r\nwork well, and the result will be more perfect nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe use of certain organs increases supply, and the use of others\r\nquickens waste; a balance should be maintained between the two. We\r\nmust nourish the life-sustaining organs before using the organs which\r\nuse up brain-supply, therefore we want to be sure that we are working\r\naccording to these laws. A great many people have an idea that\r\nphysical culture means building up big muscle. They measure the\r\nmuscles of the arm and of the leg, and judge by their increase in size\r\nof the value of the exercise. This is not a correct measurement.\r\nIndividuals may weigh themselves down by development of muscles until\r\nthey have not sufficient internal vital force to carry so much weight.\r\nIf we could only balance between the organs which supply nutriment and\r\nthe organs which use it up, we would keep in perfect health.\r\n\r\nWe want to learn how to secure a maximum of results with a minimum of\r\nforce. That is, we want the body to be quickly responsive, to be\r\nflexible, to be so that we can use it for the things we want to do\r\nwithout wasting strength, and yet without being weighed down by a\r\nsuperabundance of muscular tissue.\r\n\r\nThe first desideratum in taking exercise is to have every organ of the\r\nbody free, therefore a gymnastic dress is a necessity. Then we should\r\nhave the exercise conducted by some one who understands the\r\npeculiarities of each individual and knows just what exercises are\r\nsuited for her in her special physical condition. They should also be\r\ndirected by one who understands perfectly that the girl with an anæmic\r\nbrain, that is, with a brain having too little blood, cannot be\r\nconducted on the same plan as the exercise of the girl who has a\r\nsuperabundance of blood in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe best exercise is that which employs the mind pleasantly. A good\r\ndeal of exercise may be obtained in housework, and, if conducted with\r\npleasure in the work, may be of great physical advantage. Not long ago\r\nI listened to a very charming talk by a lady whose dress betokened her\r\na woman of society. She wore white kid gloves, a dainty flower bonnet,\r\nand in herself appeared an exponent of leisure and happiness. Her\r\naddress was entitled \"The Home Gymnasium,\" and I supposed that it\r\nwould consist of descriptions of machinery that could be put up in\r\none's own dwelling for gymnastic purposes, but I soon found that her\r\nhome gymnasium meant household duties. She said one could scrub the\r\ntable and obtain the best exercise for arms and chest, and at the same\r\ntime produce an article or piece of furniture which would be a delight\r\nto the eye in its whiteness and brightness. She said that in\r\nscrubbing the floor one obtained very much the same movement that\r\nwould be given in the gymnasium, while at the same time the exercise\r\nwould conduce not only to the personal advantage but to the happiness\r\nof the family. She spoke of sweeping, and dusting, and bed-making, and\r\nexpressed herself as competent to do all these kinds of work, in fact,\r\nas doing them. And she said she never felt more of a lady than when\r\nscrubbing her kitchen floor, and she was not ashamed to be seen by her\r\nfriends at this work. If any one rang the door-bell, she said she\r\nwould simply put on a clean apron and go to the door, and remark\r\nwithout hesitation that she was just scrubbing her kitchen floor, but\r\nshe was glad to see her friends.\r\n\r\nThis sort of a home gymnasium is at the command of nearly every girl,\r\nand if she can bring herself to feel an interest in this home\r\ngymnastic exercise, she may find it conducive not only to her own\r\nphysical well-being, but to the comfort and happiness of all about\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked whether bicycle-riding is injurious for\r\ngirls, and I would say that in my opinion it depends largely upon the\r\ngirl. Has she good common sense? Of course I am speaking of the girl\r\nwho is in a normal condition of health. A girl of extreme delicacy, or\r\nwho is subject to some functional difficulty, or the victim of some\r\norganic disease, might not find it advantageous to ride. A physician\r\nshould, in these cases, be consulted. But for the ordinary girl, the\r\ngirl of fairly good health, if she will learn how to sit properly upon\r\nher saddle, will have the good sense to ride with judgment, it seems\r\nto me that the exercise must be productive of great good.\r\n\r\nMy own experience is somewhat limited. I made some discoveries in my\r\nattempts to ride. In the first place, I learned that it was important\r\nto know how to sit. In reading a book on \"Physical Culture and Hygiene\r\nfor Women,\" by Dr. Anna Galbraith, I found this sentence: \"Sit upon\r\nthe gluteal muscles, and not upon the perineum.\" This was a revelation\r\nto me. I found that I had been doing the thing which was not proper,\r\nand bearing the weight almost entirely upon the perineum had caused\r\nconstant rectal irritation. The gluteal muscles, closely held\r\ntogether, form a firm support for the body without injuring any of the\r\nvital organs. I found that by distributing the weight--a little upon\r\nthe handle-bars, and some upon the feet--I was able to sit with less\r\nweight and heaviness upon the saddle. I found, too, that it was quite\r\nimportant to have the saddle high enough, so that the legs might be\r\nfully extended at each stroke, and with these precautions I found the\r\nwheel a source both of enjoyment and of strength.\r\n\r\nThe harm done by the wheel I believe in most instances to be due to\r\nan ill-adapted saddle or a lack of good judgment in the amount of\r\nexercise taken. It is such a fascinating exercise, one seems to be\r\nflying and scarcely realizes how much of nerve-force is being\r\nexpended. If the girl learning to ride will be prudent, gauging the\r\namount of exercise by her amount of strength; if she will gradually\r\nacquire the needed strength before attempting long wheeling trips; if\r\nshe will be judicious and not ride, perhaps, during the first two or\r\nthree days of menstruation, there seems to be no reason why the\r\nordinary girl should not be entirely benefited by this most delightful\r\nform of exercise. It is not as objectionable, to any degree, as the\r\nexercise of dancing. Dancing is a most fascinating amusement, and if\r\nit only could be conducted under proper circumstances it would be very\r\ndelightful. In itself it is not so objectionable as in its\r\nconcomitants; the late hours, the improper dressing, the hearty\r\nsuppers in the middle of the night, the promiscuous association and\r\nthe undue familiarity of the attitude of the round dance are what make\r\ndancing objectionable. If dancing could be conducted out of doors, in\r\nthe daylight, with intimate friends, without the round dances, only\r\nthose forms of dancing which may be likened to gymnastics, as the\r\ncontra-dance, the cotillion, the objections to dancing would be\r\nlargely removed, but I am of the opinion that a large share of the\r\nfascination of dancing would go at the same time.\r\n\r\nSkating is a delightful, invigorating form of exercise, if conducted\r\nwith judgment. One objection to it is that the girl will skate until\r\nwearied, and then, in that exhausted condition, perhaps ride home, or\r\ntake a long, tiresome walk from the pond to her residence, all of\r\nwhich is sapping her unduly and annulling the value of the skating as\r\nan exercise.\r\n\r\nLawn-tennis is delightful and beneficial, provided it is undertaken\r\nwith due judgment and the girl is properly dressed. In fact, the\r\nsubject of dress is so closely associated with that of exercise that\r\nthey can never be considered separately. Even the moderate exercise of\r\nwalking, conducted in the dress of the fashionable woman, is in itself\r\nan element of danger, whereas more violent exercise in a loose dress\r\nbecomes a means of increased strength and vigor.\r\n\r\nI am often asked if girls should be allowed to run up and down stairs.\r\nI see no reason why girls should not go up and down stairs just as\r\nfreely as boys, if they are properly dressed; but going up and down\r\nstairs in tight clothing is certainly very injurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nBATHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou and your girl friends take much pains with your personal\r\nadornment. You spend time in curling your hair and in putting on\r\nribbons and laces, but I sometimes think you do not pay as much\r\nattention to personal cleanliness as you ought. It would seem as if\r\nsome of you thought that powder would cover a defect in cleanliness\r\nand perfumery would conceal the odors of the person; but indeed it\r\nseems to me that the stylish make-up of your dress or the curl of your\r\nhair is of very little importance compared with the care of your\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nYou each desire to have a beautiful complexion. I used to be told in\r\nmy childhood that beauty was only skin-deep, but I have learned\r\nbetter. I know that even the beauty of the complexion depends upon the\r\nintegrity of the nutritive organs as well as upon the care and\r\nattention given to matters of personal cleanliness.\r\n\r\nI read the other day of a discussion between two young men concerning\r\nthe cleanliness of girls of their acquaintance. One young man noticed\r\nthat although one of the girls wore a very pretty dress-gown, she had\r\nforgotten to clean her finger-nails. The other remarked that many\r\nthings in regard to a girl's personal cleanliness could be learned by\r\nriding behind her on a tandem. The two then commented favorably upon\r\nthe girl whose nails were pink, whose ears and neck were clean, her\r\nteeth white and dazzling, and her hair well brushed. I might say, in\r\npassing, that this hair-brushing time at night may be well employed in\r\nreviewing the experiences of the day in order to learn the lessons\r\nthey teach, and thereby to avoid to-morrow the mistakes of to-day.\r\n\r\nThese same young men also said that the complexions of some girls\r\nsuggested the idea of too little fresh air and too much candy. This,\r\nthey agreed, it was impossible to hide with powder. So we see that the\r\ncare of the skin is quite important if one would have the respect and\r\nthe admiration of her associates.\r\n\r\nThe skin is a very beautiful, complex and delicate covering of the\r\nbody. It consists of six layers, and contains arteries, capillaries,\r\nlymphatics, nerves, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, pigment, etc. So\r\nyou see that the care of the skin involves much. One writer has said,\r\n\"At the skin man ends and the outlying universe begins.\"\r\n\r\nThe skin, filled with nerves, is continually reporting to the brain\r\nconcerning what is the condition of all parts of the body. The\r\ncondition of the skin reflects the condition of the digestive organs.\r\nMany girls are trying to cure pimples on the face by the use of salves\r\nand lotions, when in all probability all that they would need to do to\r\ngain a good complexion is to pay attention to diet, to quit eating\r\nbetween meals, and not to eat so much pastry, pickles or sweetmeats.\r\nOur athletes and pugilists are learning that they must take care of\r\nthe skin if they would keep in good condition, and they are what in\r\nhorses would be called well groomed. The skin is rubbed, cared for,\r\nkept active, because it is understood that it is an organ of\r\nsensation, of secretion, of excretion, of absorption, and of\r\nrespiration. More solid matter is thrown out from the skin than from\r\nthe lungs, in the proportion of eleven to seven. It is even more than\r\nthe excretion from the bowels.\r\n\r\nThe skin is an organ of breathing. This seems strange to us, but it\r\nreally does take up oxygen and give out carbonic acid, so upon the\r\ncondition of the skin will depend very largely the condition of the\r\ngeneral health. We can detect a constipated condition of the bowels\r\nthrough the color and odor of the skin.\r\n\r\nMany girls feel that it is more delicate to neglect the care of the\r\nbowels than to attend to a daily evacuation, but if they would\r\nremember that it is just as indelicate to carry effete or dead matter\r\nabout in the bowels as it would be to carry it upon the person in any\r\nother way, they would realize that it is only politeness and\r\nrefinement to see that this part of their bodily housekeeping is duly\r\nattended to. If the bowels do not do their work the skin will be\r\nobliged to take extra labor upon itself; so, as we have said, by the\r\nodor of the skin we can detect the fact that the skin is doing the\r\nwork that should be done by the bowels. When a person is sick the\r\ncondition of the internal organs is shown in the complexion, and\r\nnothing more clearly indicates health than the condition of the skin.\r\n\r\nIf this is so important, how shall we care for the skin? First, by\r\nbathing. The tin bath-tub of the Englishman accompanies him in all his\r\ntravels, and has penetrated even to the jungles of Africa. Bathing\r\nappliances are marks of civilization, and the bath-room is becoming a\r\nnecessity. Where the bath-room does not exist it is easy to bathe\r\nthoroughly and completely. A wash-basin of water, with a sponge and\r\ntowel, furnish all that is absolutely necessary. A most convenient\r\nbath is the portable thermal bath, an arrangement of rubber cloth that\r\ncan be opened out to form a square enclosure in which the person sits,\r\nwith the head in the free outside air, the body enveloped in steam\r\ngenerated by an alcohol lamp. This, followed by a quick sponge-bath of\r\ncool water, is a most efficient way of cleansing the skin; and this\r\nbath may be used in any room, no matter how beautifully furnished,\r\nwithout soiling the carpet or furniture in the least.\r\n\r\nOne great secret of healthful bathing is, when warm or hot water is\r\nused, to follow it by an immediate application of cold water, which\r\nleaves the skin in a tonic condition. In preparation for going out in\r\ncold weather, nothing is so efficient a protection from the cold as a\r\nfoot-bath. Soak the feet for a few minutes in water as warm as is\r\ncomfortable, then plunge them into cold water and remove immediately,\r\nor throw cold water over them, wipe them thoroughly dry, rub them with\r\na little olive oil, draw on a pair of clean, warm hose, and the feet\r\nare not only warmed, but are protected against cold and will stay\r\nwarm. These precautions will prevent one taking cold from the\r\nfoot-bath. Care of the feet is a great necessity not only for health,\r\nfor equalizing the circulation, but for the prevention of unpleasant\r\nodors.\r\n\r\nAs to time of bathing, I suppose that the body is at its highest point\r\nof vital power at about ten o'clock in the morning, but this is, for\r\nmost people, the most inconvenient time for a bath. The circumstances\r\nof the individual are to be consulted, and also the effect of bathing.\r\nThere are those who are made nervous by taking a bath, consequently\r\nthey will not be benefited by taking one just before going to bed. In\r\nother cases the bath conduces to slumber. This depends very largely\r\nupon the amount of blood in the brain. A person with an anæmic brain\r\nwill not be benefited by the bath at bedtime, but the person whose\r\nbrain is overcharged with blood will find the evening bath quieting.\r\n\r\nI would not advise everybody to take a daily bath. There are those who\r\nare benefited by it; there are others who might be injured by it. It\r\nis best to study personal peculiarities and to watch the effect of the\r\nbath. If, within a few hours, or the next day, there is great\r\nexhaustion, one might naturally conclude that the bath was not\r\naltogether beneficial. There are those in such delicate health that a\r\ncold bath at any time does not seem desirable; but constant attention\r\nwill secure perfect cleanliness, as the arms and chest can be bathed\r\none day, the abdomen and back another, the lower extremities still\r\nanother day, and so the whole body be compassed twice or more in the\r\nspace of a week.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of soap for bathing purposes, the finest, purest\r\nsoaps should be used, and these alone. It is generally supposed that\r\npure, white castile soap is the best. Various soaps are widely\r\nadvertised, while some that claim to be of the very best are not\r\nalways up to the requisite standard. Yet one can tell by a little\r\nexperience what soap is of pure quality, and such soap can be applied\r\neven to the face without injury.\r\n\r\nIn washing the face the hand is probably the best instrument, with the\r\nthumb under the chin, the fingers turned toward the upper part of the\r\nface. The manipulation should be against the direction of forming\r\nwrinkles, wherever there is a tendency for wrinkles to appear. They\r\ncan be held in check by the judicious manipulation of the fingers in\r\nthe opposite direction. Wrinkles are created by obliterating the\r\ncapillary circulation of the skin. The manipulation increases the\r\ncirculation, and so tends to overcome wrinkles. The expression of the\r\nface may form wrinkles. I saw a girl the other day on a street-car who\r\ncontinually held her eyebrows elevated, forming longitudinal lines\r\nacross her forehead, which had become as fixed in her youthful face as\r\nif she had been seventy years of age. This was a lack of care in the\r\ngoverning of the expression of the face, and also a lack in keeping up\r\nthe capillary circulation.\r\n\r\nThe care of the hands may be considered also while discussing the\r\nquestion of bathing. The hands should be kept clean, the finger-nails\r\nparticularly cared for, as much of the beauty of the hands depends\r\nupon the delicate appearance of the finger-nails. The manicure sets,\r\nwhich are at the disposal of almost every young woman of the present\r\nday, are a very great addition to toilet appurtenances. The curved\r\nscissors, the polisher, the blunt ivory instrument for pushing back\r\nthe fold of skin from the root of the nail, all of these used but a\r\nfew moments in the day will conduce to great beauty in the hands, even\r\nfor those who are doing housework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nNEED OF SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE; SOME FORMS OF AVOIDABLE DISEASE, THEIR\r\nREMEDY AND PREVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCREATIVE POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful thought that God shares His divine endowments with\r\nman; that He, being our Father, hath bestowed upon us the power to\r\nmanifest His characteristics. We are proud of these Godlike powers. We\r\ntalk of our Godlike reason, and it is divine. We know that God\r\nreasons. We have evidence of it in the material world about us, and\r\nwhen we use our reason we are \"thinking God's thoughts after Him.\"\r\n\r\nGod has the marvelous power of imagination, using that word in its\r\nnoblest sense. He has the power to conceive something in thought\r\nbefore it actually exists. He must have seen all the glories of the\r\nmaterial universe, worlds upon worlds circling through space, moon and\r\nstars, the beauty of forest and stream, of tinted flower and\r\niridescent insect wing before they were brought into being, and He had\r\nthe power to create them. Man has this wonderful gift of imagination.\r\nThe inventor sees the machine in his thought before he attempts to\r\nbuild it. The poet has the germ of his poem in mind, even the rhythm\r\nand rhyme, before he puts it on paper. To the imagination of the\r\nartist the canvas glows with color before his brush has touched it.\r\nThe sculptor, looking at the rough block of marble, sees within it the\r\nimprisoned shape of beauty which his genius shall liberate to delight\r\nthe world. The musician hears, singing through his brain, the\r\nmarvelous harmonies which, put upon paper, shall entrance all hearers.\r\nCertainly this glorious gift of imagination is Godlike. But it would\r\nbe useless if it were not accompanied by creative power. The inventor\r\nmust be able to create as well as to imagine the engine. The poet, the\r\nmusician, the artist fails of deserving the name if he cannot embody\r\nhis thought in a form that others may recognize. He must not only\r\nimagine, but create. In some degree every intelligent human being has\r\nthese powers. The housewife imagines her dinner before she prepares\r\nit, and a well-cooked dinner, placed upon a well-appointed table with\r\ncare and taste, manifests something of the ability of the inventor and\r\nthe artist. The same may be said of her who designs and creates an\r\nelegant costume, or arranges a room with taste and skill.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the housewife's culinary creation; we admire the\r\ntasteful creation of the dressmaker; we wonder at the glorious\r\ncreation of artist or musician; perhaps we even envy them. But food\r\nand clothing pass away and are forgotten. Even the grand symphony, the\r\nbeautiful picture, the graceful statue, may pass into oblivion, and\r\nman forget that they ever existed.\r\n\r\nBut humanity is endowed with creative powers that are not transient.\r\nThe brains builded by the individual are transmitted to his posterity\r\nfrom generation to generation.\r\n\r\nGod's greatest power is that of conferring life, sentient life. We\r\nmight have imagined that that marvelous power he would have kept for\r\nHimself alone, but He has not done so. We have also the power to\r\nconfer life. We can call into existence other human beings, and endow\r\nthem with the record of our own lives, giving to them our form, our\r\nfeatures, our measure of vitality, our tendencies, our habits; and\r\nthese human beings whom we have thus called into life will never die.\r\nWhat diviner, more responsible gift could God have conferred upon us\r\nthan this? What more worthy of our devout study? In this reverent\r\nattitude of mind let us study this gift of creative power, learning\r\nwhat we may of its scope and purpose and the material organs through\r\nwhich it works.\r\n\r\nIn your study of physiology in school you took up the organs of\r\nindividual life. You studied the framework of the body, its machinery,\r\nits internal vital mechanism. You studied about digestion, nutrition,\r\nrespiration, elimination, and in this you learned nothing of physical\r\ndifferences between individuals. All were considered as having the\r\nsame organs, used in the same way. Girls have the same number of\r\nbones as boys, the same number of muscles, of vital organs. They\r\nsleep, breathe, eat, digest, grow, according to the same plan. So far\r\nthere seems no reason why there should be any distinction of male and\r\nfemale. But as we come to study what is called special physiology we\r\ndiscover physical differences and reasons for their existence.\r\n\r\nThere are certain differences of form that are discernible at a\r\nglance. Men are usually larger than women. They have heavier bones and\r\nbigger muscles. They have broad shoulders and narrow hips, and have\r\nhair upon the face. Women have smooth faces, more rounded outlines,\r\nnarrower shoulders and broader hips. In man the broadest part of the\r\nbody is at the shoulders, in woman at the hips. This is significant of\r\na great fact which will be manifest to you when you understand the\r\nfunctions of each sex. Although each has the same general plan of\r\nindividual life, there are special functions which determine the trend\r\nof their lives. The man's broad shoulders are indicative that he is to\r\nbear the heavy burdens of life--struggles for material support--and\r\nwoman's broad hips indicate that she is to bear the heavier burden of\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nWhen we come fully to understand the deep significance of sex, we\r\nshall find in it a wonderful revelation of possibilities of\r\ndevelopment into a God-likeness that will stir our hearts to their\r\nvery depths.\r\n\r\nHumanity so weak, so lacking in appreciation of his possibilities, so\r\ngroveling when he should soar, has been endowed with powers that give\r\nhim control over the destiny of the race. We may well exclaim, with\r\nYoung:\r\n\r\n    \"How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,\r\n    How complicate, how wonderful is man!\r\n    How passing wonder He who made him such!\r\n    Who centred in his make such strange extremes!\r\n    From diff'rent natures, marvelously mix'd!\r\n    Connection exquisite of distant worlds!\r\n    Distinguish'd link in being's endless chain!\r\n    Midway from nothing to the Deity!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBUILDING BRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you were born you were, as all babies are, deaf, dumb, blind, and\r\nhelpless, but immediately the external world began to act upon you.\r\nThen began the process of mind-building. You began to experience\r\nsensations of heat and cold, of hunger, of pain. The eyes began at\r\nonce to recognize the light, the ears to become aware of sounds. After\r\na time, objects were made clear to your sight and certain sounds were\r\nrecognized. You learned your mother's face and voice, and, little by\r\nlittle, became acquainted with all the objects in the world of home.\r\nYou began to use your limbs, and in this also you were at work\r\nbuilding your mind. We do not sufficiently realize that every aimless\r\nmovement of the baby has in reality a great purpose--that of creating\r\nbrainpower sufficient to enable the baby to control itself in all its\r\nvoluntary movements. We do not think that the fluttering hands and\r\nlittle kicking feet are really building brains, but this is so. And\r\nall of life's experiences have been building brain for you ever since.\r\n\r\nProfessor Elmer Gates tells us that only about ten per cent. of our\r\nbrains are cultivated, that there is a vast field of brain\r\npossibilities lying undeveloped in each one of us, and that these\r\npossibilities are to be developed through cultivation of the senses.\r\nSo while I have been talking to you of the care of your body, I have\r\nbeen advocating that which will in reality develop mind.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that certain areas of brain govern certain movements\r\nof body. For example, anatomists know not only where the general motor\r\narea is located, but they can indicate the very spot where any special\r\nmotor-force is generated.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a mill girl who was subject to epilepsy and had pain in\r\nher right thumb at each attack, it was decided to remove the part of\r\nthe brain which governed the motions of that thumb. This they could do\r\nbecause they knew just where that motor-center lies, and yet they were\r\nable to take out no more than that, for when the wound was healed she\r\nhad full use of all of her hand except the thumb.\r\n\r\nWe may know that by exercising a certain organ we are building up a\r\ncertain part of the brain. For example, the man who has cultivated his\r\nhearing until he can hear sounds inaudible to ordinary men, has made\r\nfor himself more brain-cells in the hearing area. If he has cultivated\r\nhis sight assiduously, he has created more visual cells. If his touch\r\nhas been cultivated, his brain has received new touch\r\nsensation-cells. And Professor Gates asserts that his mental ability\r\nhas been thereby increased. You will be interested in hearing of his\r\nexperiments with animals and what he has learned therefrom.\r\n\r\nHe says he has demonstrated that it is possible to give to an animal\r\nor a human being more brains, and consequently a better use of the\r\nmental faculties. During twelve months, for five or six hours a day,\r\nhe trained dogs to discriminate colors. He placed several hundred tin\r\npans, painted different tints, in the yard with the dogs. At one time\r\nhe put their food under pans of a certain tint. When they had learned\r\nto go at once to these pans for their food, he changed the color.\r\nAgain he arranged it so that they would receive an electric shock if\r\nthey touched pans of any color save the particular one. They soon\r\nlearned to avoid all the pans except those of this tint. So, by many\r\ndifferent methods, he trained them to recognize shades and tints until\r\nthey could discriminate between seven shades of red and as many shades\r\nof green, and in many ways they manifested more mental ability than\r\nany untrained dog. While these dogs were being trained, another group\r\nof dogs were being deprived of the use of sight by being kept in a\r\ndarkened room.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year both groups of dogs were killed and their\r\nbrains dissected. He found that the dogs kept in the darkness had\r\nless than the usual number of cells in the seeing areas, and the cells\r\nwere smaller, while the dogs which had been trained to discriminate\r\nbetween tints and shades of color many times a day had a far greater\r\nnumber of larger and more complex brain-cells in the seeing areas than\r\nany dog of that age and species ever had before. \"Therefore,\" says\r\nProfessor Gates, \"mind activity creates organic structure.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Gates discovered other things of equal importance. He carried\r\nhis observations to successive generations, and found that the fifth\r\ngeneration was born with a far greater number of brain-cells than\r\ncould be found in animals not descended from trained ancestors.\r\n\r\nThis is not only interesting, but of value. You will remember, in our\r\ntalk concerning your value, we spoke of your value to the race, and\r\nlearned that in cultivating yourself in any direction you were adding\r\nto the welfare of future generations. That was only a general\r\nstatement, and now you can see how it can be. You see that if you can\r\nmake more brains for yourself you are also making more brains for your\r\nposterity. Or if you fail to make brains for yourself, posterity will\r\nin like degree be defrauded.\r\n\r\nMany people have the idea that we are obliged to be satisfied with our\r\ndower of mental ability, and so are excusable for failing to reach as\r\nhigh a level as some others. If we really believed that we could\r\ncreate brains we would not sit down and sigh over small mental\r\ncapacity, but go to work at once in building minds for ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd first, we must learn to control our thoughts and make them go\r\nwhere we send them. In too many cases thoughts wander here and there,\r\nwith no power governing and guiding them.\r\n\r\nWhen we are sauntering in the wood we sometimes come upon pathways,\r\nand we know at once that many, many footsteps of men or animals have\r\nbeen needed to make the paths. If those who walked here had wandered\r\neach in his own way, no path would have been made. One pair of feet\r\ngoing often over the same ground will make a path. So the thoughts,\r\ntraversing the same areas of brain, will make records on the\r\nbrain-cells which we may call paths. Every time a thought follows the\r\nsame line it creates a deeper impression, and makes it easier to go\r\nover the same territory again. In this way habits are formed. If the\r\nthoughts are good, the habits will be good; if evil, the habits will\r\nbe bad.\r\n\r\nIt is not hard to understand how much easier it is to form a habit\r\nthan to overcome it. The emotions, like the thoughts, create habits;\r\nbut, more than this, they create actual physical conditions.\r\n\r\nIt was my pleasure and profit once to have a conversation with\r\nProfessor Gates in his laboratory, and he showed me an instrument\r\nwherein he condenses the breath. He then subjects it to a chemical\r\nreagent, and by the precipitate formed he knows what was the mental\r\ncondition of the individual, whether he were angry, sorrowful or\r\nremorseful. In five minutes after a fit of anger he finds the\r\nexcretory organs beginning to throw out the poison which anger has\r\ncreated. Only five minutes suffice to create the poison, but half an\r\nhour is none too much to eliminate it.\r\n\r\nThink what must be the bodily state of one who is constantly irritated\r\nor angry, who feels jealousy, hatred, or revenge. With body poisoned\r\nby these malevolent passions he cannot feel well, for his physical\r\norgans cannot do good work unless fed by pure blood. Professor Gates\r\nfinds that the benevolent emotions create life-giving germs in the\r\nbody; so, to love others is not only helpful to them, but it also\r\ngives us new life.\r\n\r\nAnger, worry, hatred, jealousy, are suicidal emotions. We cannot for\r\nour own sakes afford to indulge in them, while from selfish reasons\r\nalone we should be incited to kindness, generosity, sympathy, and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nYOU ARE MORE THAN BODY OR MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have talked of your body and your mind, but as yet not of yourself.\r\nYou are not body; you are not mind; but you possess both. You are\r\nspirit, created by God, who is spirit; therefore you are His child.\r\nYou may not have thought much of this fact, but that has not changed\r\nthe fact. No failure to recognize God as your father changes His\r\nrelationship to you. No conduct of yours can make you any less His\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" you may say, \"if that is so, what does it matter, then, what I\r\ndo? If disobedience or sin cannot make me less God's child, why should\r\nI be good and obedient?\" Because, dear heart, your conduct changes\r\nyour attitude towards Him. You might not know that I am your mother;\r\nyou might know it and choose to disobey my wishes; yet in both cases I\r\nshould still be your mother, and no more or less in one case than in\r\nthe other. But you will have no difficulty in understanding that in\r\none case you would be a loving, helpful, obedient daughter, a comfort\r\nand delight to me; in the other, a disobedient, willful, unloving\r\ndaughter, a care and trouble.\r\n\r\nWe are God's children, each of us, dependent on His love and bounty\r\nfor protection, food, friends, intellect, even life. Is it dignified\r\nand noble in us to ignore and disobey Him? Indeed the most worthy and\r\ndignified thing we can do is to recognize ourselves as God's children\r\nand be obedient. It is a wonderful glory to be a child of God. It\r\nmeans that we have Godlike powers. The children of human parents are\r\nlike them in their capacities. Children of God must have capacities\r\nthat are Godlike.\r\n\r\nThis is true even of the most ignorant or degraded. They have in\r\nthemselves divine possibilities.\r\n\r\nIf you can get this thought fully engrafted into your consciousness,\r\nit seems to me you can never willfully do wrong, can never condescend\r\nto a mean or ignoble deed, because you recognize your divine\r\ninheritance, and feel compelled by it to live truly, nobly.\r\n\r\nBeing children of God puts on us certain obligations towards Him, but\r\nit also puts on God certain obligations towards us. \"What!\" you say;\r\n\"God the Infinite under obligations to man, the finite? The Creator\r\nunder obligations to the created?\" Oh, yes.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the fact that human parents are under obligations to care\r\nfor their children, to protect them, to educate them, to give them\r\nopportunities. Even such are the obligations of God towards His human\r\nchildren, and He fulfills them. All our earthly blessings are from His\r\nhand. Home, friends, shelter, food, are gifts of His love. He takes\r\nsuch minute care of us that if for one second of time He would forget\r\nus, we should be annihilated. He educates us. He does not send us away\r\nto a boarding-school where we hear from Him but seldom, but He has a\r\nhome-school where He is both Father and Teacher, and His methods of\r\ninstruction are divinely wise.\r\n\r\nThe injudicious love of earthly parents often induces them to do for\r\ntheir children things it would be far better to let the children do\r\nfor themselves. I once knew a boy of seven years, as intelligent as\r\nthe ordinary child, who had never been allowed to go down stairs alone\r\nin his life for fear he would fall. This unwise care of the parents\r\nhad resulted in the child's being timid, fearful, and unable to care\r\nfor himself. He would cry if he fell, and would lie still sobbing\r\nuntil some one came to pick him up and quiet him with caresses. At the\r\nsame time I saw a boy of four who could run up and down stairs, go to\r\nthe store alone to make purchases, and who, if he fell, would jump up\r\nquickly, saying, \"O, that didn't hurt.\" Which child had been better\r\nprotected--the one who had been cared for by an overindulgent parent,\r\nor the one who, by judicious stimulation to self-help, had learned to\r\ncare for himself?\r\n\r\nGod teaches us how to help ourselves, and circumstances of life which\r\nwe so often think hard and cruel are only the means by which we are\r\nbeing trained to be strong. The things we call failure, worriment, and\r\nhardship, are only the little tumbles by which we are learning to\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nThe heathen philosopher, Seneca, says: \"God gives His best scholars\r\nthe hardest lessons.\" We know how proud we would feel if our\r\nschool-teacher would say, \"This is a hard problem, but I believe you\r\ncan solve it.\" We would be stimulated to work night and day to justify\r\nhis confidence in our ability. But when a little trial comes in life\r\nwe are quite apt to say, \"God is so hard in His dealings with me. Why\r\nshould He be so unkind?\" instead of saying: \"These hard things of life\r\nare a test of my scholarship, and are an evidence of my Teacher's\r\nconfidence in my ability.\"\r\n\r\nI would like you to get this thought fixed in your mind so firmly that\r\nyou will feel sure that all circumstances of life are but lessons in\r\nGod's great school, and, rightly used, will be the means of promoting\r\nyou to higher grades.\r\n\r\nNo scholar wants to stay always in the primary department because it\r\nis easy there. He welcomes each promotion, although he knows it means\r\nharder lessons and new difficulties. He looks forward to college or\r\nuniversity with pride, even though lessons grow harder and harder.\r\n\r\nGod's school of earthly life has in it all grades of advancement. Will\r\nyou be a studious, courageous scholar and try to learn life's lessons\r\nwell? It is such a wonderful thing to be a child of God, for that\r\nmeans to be an heir of God, an heir of His wisdom, His strength, His\r\nglory, His powers. \"All things are yours,\" says Paul; \"life, death,\r\nthings present and things to come, all are yours, and ye are Christ's,\r\nand Christ is God's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL PHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of reverence for ourselves we now take up the subject\r\nof special physiology to learn what makes us women. In the study of\r\ngeneral physiology we find very few physical differences in the sexes,\r\nbut when we come to investigate what is called the reproductive system\r\nwe find entire difference of structure and of function.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls in early childhood are much alike in their\r\ninclinations. They both love activity--to run, to climb, to shout, to\r\nlaugh, to play. If left to themselves one sees not much more\r\ndifference between boys and girls than between different individuals\r\nof the same sex. But as they grow and develop they begin to take on\r\ncharacteristics that indicate the evolution of sex.\r\n\r\nThe boy grows rapidly in height, his voice breaks, the signs of a\r\nmoustache appear, he seems constrained and embarrassed in society, and\r\nyet he begins to show more politeness towards women and more of an\r\ninclination to be gallant to girls. He is becoming a man, and assumes\r\nmanlike airs. Often, too, he becomes restless and willful, hard to\r\ngovern, self-assertive, with an assumption of wisdom that provokes\r\nlaughter from his elders. The boy is passing through a serious crisis\r\nand needs much wise and loving care. There are inner forces awakening\r\nthat move him strangely; he does not understand himself, neither do\r\nhis friends seem to understand him. Sometimes they snub and nag him,\r\nsometimes they tease and make fun of him. In either case he does not\r\nfind home a happy place, and frequently leaves it to seek more\r\nsympathetic companionship elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI once spoke to an audience of women and girls along this line, and\r\nappealed to the mothers and sisters to be kind to the boys in their\r\nhomes who were between twelve and eighteen years of age, to remember\r\nthat they were passing through the critical period of transition from\r\nboyhood to manhood, and to try and help them by sympathy and kindness.\r\nSome time later, as I was on the train, a young lady came and sat down\r\nby me and said: \"I want to thank you for what you said to us the other\r\nday about boys. I have a brother about sixteen, and we have done just\r\nas you said; we have teased him about his moustache, and his voice,\r\nand his awkwardness, and laughed the more because it seemed to touch\r\nhim. He had gotten so that he never would do anything for us girls,\r\nand we called him an old bear. Since I heard you I concluded that we\r\nhad done wrong and I would make a change, so that evening I said\r\nkindly, 'Charlie, don't you want me to tie your cravat? I'd like to,\r\never so much.' I shall never forget the surprised look he gave me. It\r\nseemed as if he could not believe that I, his sister, wanted to do\r\nsomething to please him, but as soon as he saw I really meant it he\r\naccepted my offer with thanks, and since then it seems as if he could\r\nnot do enough for me. Really I have almost cried to think that so\r\nlittle a thing would make him so grateful. I have invited him to go\r\nout with me several times, and he seems so glad to go. Then I've begun\r\nto make things for his room--little fancy things that I never thought\r\na boy would care for--and he has appreciated them so much. Why, he\r\neven stays in his room sometimes, now, instead of going off with the\r\nboys. And the other day, when one of the boys came to see him, I heard\r\nhim say, 'Come up and see my room,' and the other boy said, 'Well, I\r\nwish some one would fix up _my_ room in such a jolly fashion.'\r\nReally,\" said the girl, \"if you have done nothing on your trip but\r\nwhat you have done for me, in showing me how to be good to my brother,\r\nit has paid for you to come.\"\r\n\r\nI often think of this little incident when I see boys at this critical\r\nage who are snubbed and teased just because they are leaving the land\r\nof boyhood to begin the difficult climb up the slopes of early manhood\r\ntowards the grander height of maturity; and I wish all parents,\r\nsisters and older brothers would manifest a sympathy with the boy who,\r\nswayed by inner forces and influenced by outward temptation, is in a\r\nplace of great danger.\r\n\r\nThe girl at this period is also passing through a crisis, but this\r\nfact is better understood by her friends than is the crisis of the\r\nboy's life. Her parents are anxious that she shall pass the crisis\r\nsafely, and they have more patience with her eccentricities. She, too,\r\noften shows nervousness, irritability, petulance, or willfulness. She\r\nhas headaches and backaches, she manifests lassitude and weariness,\r\nand is, perhaps, quite changed from her former self. She weeps easily\r\nor over nothing at all. She is dissatisfied with herself and the whole\r\nworld. She feels certain vague, romantic longings that she could not\r\nexplain if she tried. She inclines toward the reading of sensational\r\nlove stories, and if not well instructed and self-respecting may be\r\neasily led into flirtations or conduct that later in life may make her\r\nblush to remember. Certain physical changes begin to be manifest. She\r\nincreases rapidly in height, her figure grows fuller and more rounded,\r\nher breasts are often sore and tender. Hair makes its appearance on\r\nthe body, and altogether she seems to be blossoming out into a fuller\r\nand riper beauty. She is changing from the girl to the woman, and this\r\nis a matter of sex. At this time the organs of sex, which have been\r\ndormant, awaken and take on their activity, and it is this awakening\r\nwhich is making itself felt throughout her whole organization.\r\n\r\nWe are sometimes apt to think that sex is located in certain organs\r\nonly, but in truth sex, while centralized in the reproductive organs,\r\nmakes itself manifest throughout the whole organization. I used to\r\nfeel somewhat indignant when I heard people talk of sex in mind, and I\r\nboldly asserted that it did not exist, that intellect was neuter and\r\nhad no reference to sex; but I do not feel so now. When I see what an\r\ninfluence the awakening of sex has upon the entire body and upon the\r\ncharacter, I am led to believe that sex inheres in mind as well. That\r\ndoes not mean that the brain of one sex is either inferior or superior\r\nto the other; it means only that they differ; that men and women see\r\nthings from different standpoints; that they are the two eyes of the\r\nrace, and the use of both is needed to a clear understanding of any\r\nproblem of human interest.\r\n\r\nYou know that the true perspective of objects cannot be had with one\r\neye only, for each eye has its own range of vision, and one eye can\r\nsee much farther on one side of an object than the other can. You can\r\ntry this for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf, then, in viewing the vital problems of life we have the man's view\r\nonly or the woman's view only, we have not the true perspective. We\r\ncannot say that either has superior powers of vision, but we can say\r\nthat they differ, as this difference is inherent in them as men and\r\nwomen, and not merely as individuals.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of looking at sex as circumscribed, and perhaps as\r\nsomething low and vulgar, to be thought of and spoken of only with\r\nwhispers or questionable mirth, we should see that sex is God's\r\ndivinest gift to humanity, the power through which we come into the\r\nnearest likeness to Himself--the function by which we become creators\r\nand transmitters of our powers of body, mind, and soul.\r\n\r\nIt is important that a young woman should understand her own structure\r\nand the functions of all her organs, and so, with this feeling of\r\nreverence for sex, we will begin this study.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the body is divided into three cavities; the upper or\r\nthoracic cavity contains the heart and lungs; the central or abdominal\r\ncavity contains the organs of nutrition, the stomach, liver, bowels,\r\netc.; the lower or pelvic cavity contains two organs of elimination,\r\nthe bladder and the rectum, and also the organs of reproduction, or of\r\nsex. Between the outlet of bladder and bowels is the inlet to the\r\nreproductive organs. This inlet is a narrow channel called the vagina,\r\nand is about six inches in length. At the upper end is the mouth of\r\nthe womb or uterus. The words mean the same, but womb is Anglo-Saxon\r\nand _uterus_ is Latin, and as Latin is the language of science, we\r\nwill use that word. The uterus is the little nest or room in which the\r\nunborn baby has to live for three-fourths of a year. It is a small\r\norgan, about the size and shape of a small flattened pear. It is\r\nsuspended with the small end downwards, and it is hollow. It is held\r\nin place by broad ligaments that extend outward to the sides, and by\r\nshort, round ligaments from front to back. These ligaments do not hold\r\nit firmly in place, for it is necessary that it should be able to rise\r\nout of the pelvic into the abdominal cavity during pregnancy, as the\r\nbaby grows too large to be contained in the small pelvic space.\r\n\r\nOn the posterior sides of the two broad ligaments are two small oval\r\norgans which are called ovaries, meaning the place of the eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nBECOMING A WOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will remember that I once told you that all life is from\r\nan egg, the life of the plant, the fish, the bird, the human being. In\r\nthe book \"What a Young Girl Ought to Know\" we discussed how all life\r\noriginates in an egg, and why there must needs be fathers as well as\r\nmothers. We found that some eggs were small, were laid by the mothers\r\nin various places, and then left to develop or to die. Others were\r\nlarger, covered with a large shell, and kept warm by the mothers\r\nsitting over them until the little ones were hatched. Others were so\r\nsmall that they developed in the mother's body until, as living\r\ncreatures, they were born into the world. This is the case with the\r\nhuman being. He is first an egg in the mother's ovary. When this egg\r\nhas reached a certain stage of development it passes from the ovary\r\nthrough a tube into the uterus. If it meets there, or on its way\r\nthere, the fertilizing principle of the male, it remains there and\r\ndevelops into the child. If it does not meet this principle, it passes\r\nout through the vagina and is lost.\r\n\r\nBut the eggs, or ova--which is the Latin word meaning eggs--do not\r\nbegin to ripen until the girl reaches the age of thirteen or fourteen,\r\nor, in other words, until she begins to become a woman. This passing\r\naway of the ovum (singular of ova) is called ovulation, and it occurs\r\nin the woman about every twenty-eight days. The uterus is lined by a\r\nmucous membrane similar to that which lines the mouth, and at this\r\ntime of ovulation this membrane becomes swollen and soft, and little\r\nhemorrhages, or bleedings, occur for three or four days, the blood\r\npassing away through the vagina. This is called menstruation.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when girls have not been told beforehand of the facts of\r\nmenstruation, they become greatly frightened at seeing this blood and\r\nimagine that they have some dreadful disease. If they have no friend\r\nto whom they can speak freely they sometimes do very injudicious\r\nthings in their efforts to remove that which to them seems so strange\r\nand inexplicable. I have known of girls who washed their clothes in\r\ncold water and put them on wet, and so took cold and perhaps checked\r\nthe menstrual flow, and as a consequence were injured for life, or may\r\neven have died years after as a result of this unwise conduct.\r\n\r\nThe girl who is wisely taught will recognize in this the outward sign\r\nof the fact that she has reached womanhood, that she has entered upon\r\nwhat is called the maternal period of a woman's life, the period when\r\nit is possible for her to become a mother.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that she should become a mother while so young. It\r\nonly means that the sex organs are so far developed that they are\r\nbeginning to take up their peculiar functions. But they are like the\r\nimmature buds of the flower, and need time for a perfect development.\r\nIf she understands this, and recognizes her added value to the world\r\nthrough the perfecting of her entire organism, she will desire to take\r\ngood care of herself, and during these years of early young womanhood\r\nto develop into all that is possible of sweetness, grace, purity, and\r\nall true womanliness.\r\n\r\nGirls who are not wisely taught sometimes feel that this new physical\r\nfunction is a vexatious hindrance to their happiness. It is often\r\naccompanied with pain, and its periodical recurrence interferes with\r\ntheir plans for pleasure, and they in ignorance sometimes say,\r\nrebelliously, \"O, I hate being a woman!\"\r\n\r\nA young woman once came to consult me professionally. She was a\r\nwell-formed, good-looking girl, to all outward appearance lacking\r\nnothing in her physical make-up; but she was now twenty-two and had\r\nnever menstruated, so she was aware that for some reason she was not\r\nlike other girls. She came to ask me to make an examination and find\r\nout, if possible, what was wrong. She was engaged to be married, and\r\nknew that motherhood was in some way connected with menstruation, and\r\nshe thought it might be possible that her physical condition would\r\npreclude the possibility of her becoming a mother, and, if so, it\r\nwould be dishonorable to marry. Upon examination I discovered that all\r\nthe organs of reproduction were lacking. When I disclosed this fact to\r\nher she exclaimed, with sadness, \"Oh, why was I not made like other\r\ngirls? I have heard them complain because they were girls, but I think\r\nif they were in my place, and knew that they could never have a home\r\nand children of their own, they would feel they had greater reason\r\nthen to complain.\"\r\n\r\nI think so, too. We seldom think of the fact that upon sex depend all\r\nthe sweet ties of home and family. It is because of sex that we are\r\nfathers, mothers and children; that we have the dear family life, with\r\nits anniversaries of weddings and birthdays. It is through sex that\r\nthe \"desolate of the earth are set in families,\" and love and\r\ngenerosity have sway instead of selfishness. For this reason we ought\r\nto regard sex with reverent thought, to hold it sacred to the highest\r\npurposes, to speak of it ever with purest delicacy, and never with\r\njesting or prurient smiles. I do not want you to center your thought\r\non the physical facts of sex, but I would like to have you feel that\r\nwomanhood, which is the mental, moral and physical expression of sex,\r\nis a glorious, divine gift, to be received with solemn thankfulness.\r\n\r\nI want you, for the sake of a perfect womanhood, to take care of your\r\nbodily health, and yet I do not want you to feel that a woman must of\r\nnecessity be a periodical semi-invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIALITIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMenstruation is a perfectly physiological process and should be\r\nwithout pain. Indeed, Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi maintains that a woman\r\nought to feel more life, vigor and ambition at that period than at any\r\nother time. As a fact, however, the majority of civilized women feel\r\nmore or less lassitude and discomfort, and many suffer intensely.\r\nWhenever there is actual pain at any stage of the monthly period, it\r\nis because something is wrong, either in the dress, or the diet, or\r\nthe personal and social habits of the individual. We certainly cannot\r\nbelieve that a kind and just God has made it necessary for women to\r\nsuffer merely because they are women, and the observation of travelers\r\namong uncivilized peoples seems to indicate that where life is\r\nconducted according to nature's laws, the limitations of sex are less\r\nobservable.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us to understand how very far our lives are from\r\nbeing natural. Professor Emmett, a world-renowned specialist in\r\ndiseases peculiar to women, says: \"At the very dawn of womanhood the\r\nyoung girl begins to live an artificial life utterly inconsistent with\r\nnormal development. The girl of the period is made a woman before her\r\ntime by associating too much with her elders, and in diet, dress,\r\nhabits and tastes becomes at an early age but a reflection of her\r\nelder sisters. She may have acquired every accomplishment, and yet\r\nwill have been kept in ignorance of the simplest features of her\r\norganization, and of the requirements for the preservation of her\r\nhealth. Her bloom is often as transient as that of the hothouse plant,\r\nwhere the flower has been forced by cultivation to an excess of\r\ndevelopment by stunting the growth of its branches and limiting the\r\nspread of its roots. A girl is scarcely in her teens before custom\r\nrequires a change in her dress. Her shoulder-straps and buttons are\r\ngiven up for a number of strings about her waist and the additional\r\nweight of an increased length in skirt is added. She is unable to take\r\nthe proper kind or necessary amount of exercise, even if she were not\r\ntaught that it would be unladylike to make the attempt. Her waist is\r\ndrawn into a shape little adapted to accommodate the organs placed\r\nthere, and as the abdominal and spinal muscles are seldom brought into\r\nplay they become atrophied. The viscera are thus compressed and\r\ndisplaced, and as the full play of the abdominal wall and the descent\r\nof the diaphragm are interfered with, the venous blood is hindered in\r\nits return to the heart.\"\r\n\r\nSince Professor Emmett wrote this, public sentiment has changed, and\r\nit is no longer unladylike for girls to exercise; but with this\r\nincreased freedom in custom should also come increased physical\r\nfreedom through healthful clothing that allows perfect use of every\r\nmuscle, more especially of the breathing muscles. I am sure you would\r\nrather pay out your money for that which shall add to your health and\r\nreal happiness than to pay physicians to help you from suffering the\r\njust penalty of your own wrongdoing, and that is why I am anxious to\r\ngive you this needed instruction. I do not care to have you study much\r\nabout diseases, but I want you to understand very fully how, through\r\ncare of yourself, to prevent disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSOME CAUSES OF PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere should be no pain at menstruation, but that pain is quite common\r\ncannot be denied. Let us look for other causes than are found in the\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nOne frequent cause is found in the ignorance of girls, and their\r\nconsequent injudicious conduct at the time of the beginning of sexual\r\nactivity. At this time of life the girl is often called lazy because\r\nshe manifests lassitude, and this is nature's indication that she\r\nshould rest. The vital forces are busy establishing a new function,\r\nand the energy that has been expressed in bodily activity is now being\r\notherwise employed. The girl who has been properly brought up, whose\r\nmuscles are strong, and whose nervous supply is abundant, may have no\r\nneed of especial care at this time, but the average girl needs much\r\njudicious care, in order that her physical womanhood shall be\r\nhealthfully established. She should be guarded from taking cold, from\r\noverexertion, from social dissipation, and especially from mental\r\nexcitement, and other causes of nervousness. I would like to call your\r\nattention to the great evil of romance-reading, both in the\r\nproduction of premature development and in the creation of morbid\r\nmental states which will tend to the production of physical evils,\r\nsuch as nervousness, hysteria, and a host of maladies which largely\r\ndepend upon disturbed nerves.\r\n\r\nGirls are not apt to understand the evils of novel-reading, and may\r\nthink it is only because mothers have outlived their days of romance\r\nthat they object to their daughters enjoying such sentimental reading;\r\nbut the wise mother understands the effects of sensational reading\r\nupon the physical organization, and wishes to protect her daughter\r\nfrom the evils thus produced.\r\n\r\nIt is not only that novel-reading engenders false and unreal ideas of\r\nlife, but the descriptions of love-scenes, of thrilling, romantic\r\nepisodes, find an echo in the girl's physical system and tend to\r\ncreate an abnormal excitement of her organs of sex, which she\r\nrecognizes only as a pleasurable mental emotion, with no comprehension\r\nof the physical origin or the evil effects.\r\n\r\nRomance-reading by young girls will, by this excitement of the bodily\r\norgans, tend to create their premature development, and the child\r\nbecomes physically a woman months, or even years, before she should.\r\n\r\nIn one case it became my duty to warn a girl of eleven, who was an\r\nomnivorous reader of romances, that such reading was in all\r\nprobability hastening her development, and she would become a woman in\r\nbodily functions while she ought yet to be a child. Her indications of\r\napproaching womanhood were very apparent. By becoming impressed by my\r\nwords she gave up romance-reading, devoted herself to outdoor sports,\r\nto nature studies, and the vital forces diverted from the reproductive\r\nsystem were employed in building up her physical energy, her health\r\nimproved, her nervousness disappeared, and three years later her\r\nfunction of menstruation was painlessly established.\r\n\r\nA frequent cause of painful menstruation is found in habitual neglect\r\nof the bowels. The evils of constipation are common to the majority of\r\nwomen and girls, and the foundation is laid in childhood. Mothers are\r\nnot careful enough in instructing children in the need of care in this\r\nrespect, and so the habit is formed early in life, and the results are\r\nfelt later.\r\n\r\nIf the bowels are not evacuated regularly the matter to be cast out of\r\nthe body accumulates in the rectum and large bowel, and by pressure\r\nthe circulation of the blood is impeded and congestion ensues. This\r\nextends to all the pelvic organs; the uterus and ovaries thus\r\ncongested will soon manifest disease, and painful menstruation be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent causes of pain is congestion produced by\r\ndisplacements. People are very apt to think that the displacement of\r\nthe uterus is the main factor, but in my opinion it is a secondary\r\ncondition, and not the one to be first considered. The uterus is a\r\nsmall organ, not vital to the individual, is very movable, and not\r\nsensitive, so that its displacement alone could hardly be considered\r\nsufficient to cause so great a train of evils as is frequently\r\nmanifest. But the liver, stomach and bowels are large, vital organs,\r\nand their displacement leads to greater consequences. You learned at\r\nschool that the bowels are over twenty feet in length, weigh as much\r\nas twelve or fifteen pounds, are supported in a way that makes it\r\npossible for them to sag into the abdominal cavity and press upon the\r\npelvic organs. Dr. Emerson, of the Boston School of Oratory, asserts\r\nthat in most adults the stomach and bowels are from two to six inches\r\nbelow their normal location; and, as I have said before, Dr. Kellogg\r\noften finds the stomach lying in the abdominal cavity as low down as\r\nthe umbilicus. What has caused this sagging of the abdominal viscera?\r\nThey certainly must have been intended to keep their place unless\r\nthere has been some interference. We find just such interference in\r\nthe ordinary arrangement of the clothing. Tight waists and bands, and\r\nskirts supported by the hips, are cause sufficient for these\r\ndisplacements.\r\n\r\nJust above the hips there is no bony structure to protect and support\r\nthe soft, muscular parts. They yield to pressure, and the internal\r\nviscera, deprived of muscular support, sink until they rest on the\r\npelvic organs. If, when you look at your abdomen, you see depressions\r\nor hollows on each side below the floating ribs, you may know that the\r\nbowels have sagged down out of place. If you feel great weariness,\r\nbackache, or a dragged down feeling in standing or walking, you may\r\nknow that the contents of the abdomen are pulling on their attachments\r\nor pressing on the pelvic organs. Thus displaced, circulation is\r\nhindered and the organs all become congested, or filled with blood\r\nthat moves very slowly. This congested condition is increased at\r\nmenstruation, and great pain may result.\r\n\r\nIt is well to have the counsel of some good, honest physician under\r\nsuch circumstances, but should you be where it is not possible to have\r\nsuch counsel, you may still be able to do something to help yourself.\r\nIn the first place, you can rearrange your clothing so as to relieve\r\nall the organs from external weight or pressure, and, in the second\r\nplace, you can support the abdominal walls by applying pressure from\r\nbelow. I have known cases of painful menstruation entirely relieved by\r\nsimply supporting the bowels by a bandage, thus relieving the uterus\r\nof pressure and allowing a free circulation through all the internal\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nA very simple and practical bandage can be made at home at almost no\r\ncost, either in time or money. Buy some thin, cheap cotton flannel.\r\nTake lengthwise of the goods a strip long enough to go around the body\r\nat the hips, which will be a yard or a little over, and wide enough to\r\nfit from the thighs up to the waist, perhaps eight inches. Put darts\r\non the sides and in the center of the back, to make it fit the figure.\r\nMake a couple of straps four inches wide and half a yard long; cut off\r\none end of each diagonally. Sew these slanting ends to the lower side\r\nof the band about four inches from the center, that is eight inches\r\napart, and so that the short side of the strap will be towards the\r\ncenter. Do not hem either band or straps, but overcast them; then they\r\nwill not feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nIn order to adjust the band properly it will be well to lie down on\r\nthe back upon the bandage with the knees raised. Press the hands low\r\ndown upon the abdomen and raise the contents. Repeat this several\r\ntimes; then draw the bandage around, pin with safety pins, draw the\r\nstraps up between the limbs and fasten with safety pins to the\r\nbandage. The support thus given is found to be very comfortable, and\r\ngirls who have much trouble in walking or standing during their\r\nmenstrual periods would find this simple bandage a great help at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen the bandage is removed at night you should rub and manipulate the\r\nabdominal walls so as to increase the circulation and stimulate in\r\nthem a better circulation and thus make you stronger.\r\n\r\nBy deep breathing in a proper standing attitude the abdominal viscera\r\nare lifted upward, and if the firmness of the abdominal walls is at\r\nthe same time increased by exercise, the difficulties may be largely\r\novercome. Some exercises will be found in Chapter XXIII. which are\r\ncalculated to strengthen the walls and to lift the internal organs.\r\n\r\nI wish to call your attention to a cause of displacement that is quite\r\ngenerally overlooked, and that is, a wrong attitude.\r\n\r\nDr. Eliza Mosher has made a very thorough study of this matter, and\r\nshe says that the common habit of standing on one foot is productive\r\nof marked deformities of both face and body and of serious\r\ndisplacements of internal organs. It is seldom a girl or woman can be\r\nfound whose body is perfectly symmetrical. By standing on one foot,\r\nthe hip and shoulder of one side approach each other, and so lessen\r\nthe space within the abdomen on that side. On the other side a support\r\nhas been removed for the contents of the abdomen, and they sag down\r\nuntil they pry the uterus out of place and press it over towards the\r\nside where there is less pressure. The broad ligament on one side is\r\nstretched from use and on the other side shortened from disuse, and so\r\nthe uterus remains permanently dislocated.\r\n\r\nDr. Mosher thinks that standing continually with the weight on the\r\nleft foot is more injurious than bearing it on the right foot, for it\r\ncauses the uterus and ovaries to press upon the rectum and so produces\r\na mechanical constipation, especially during menstruation.\r\n\r\nWrong habits of sitting will produce the same results. If the girl\r\nsits at school with one elbow on the desk, the head will be turned to\r\nthe opposite side and the spine will be inclined from the\r\nperpendicular, and a lateral curvature be likely to result. If she\r\ncarries her books always on the same side, it will tend to increase\r\nthe curvature. If she sits with both elbows supported, her shoulders\r\nwill be pushed up. If her body is twisted as she sits, a strain comes\r\nupon the muscles, and some ligaments will be lengthened and others\r\nshortened, thus producing a lateral curvature.\r\n\r\nTo sit \"on the small of the back,\" that is, slipping down in the\r\nchair, bracing the shoulders against the chair-back, tends to injure\r\nthe nerves by pressure, and also to create a posterior curvature of\r\nthe spine.\r\n\r\nDoes it not seem unfortunate that we should allow ourselves even to\r\nform such wrong habits of sitting and standing? And now we ask, How\r\nshall we know when we are in a correct attitude?\r\n\r\nWe have comparatively few correct examples to imitate. I notice people\r\neverywhere, and I see that old and young stand incorrectly. The head\r\nis poked forward, the shoulders are rounded, the chest is flattened,\r\nand the curve in the lower part of the back is straightened. The whole\r\nfigure is out of balance, and therefore not harmonious. Not only is\r\nthe beauty of the figure destroyed, but the internal organs are\r\ndisplaced. Many a mother who sees her daughter thus growing\r\nround-shouldered keeps telling her to throw her shoulders back; but to\r\nfollow this command only increases the difficulty. The shoulders are\r\nnot primarily at fault, but the trouble originates in non-use of the\r\nfront waist muscles. These muscles, weakened by disease because of\r\ntight clothing and corset steels, and also by cramped positions in\r\nschool or at work, refuse to hold the body erect, and it \"lops\" just\r\nat this point. This \"lopping\" disturbs the harmonious relation of the\r\nweights of shoulders, abdomen, head, and the large lower gluteal\r\nmuscles with which nature has cushioned the lower part of the body,\r\nand so they are obliged to readjust themselves to balance each other,\r\nand the awkward, ungainly, unhealthful posture results.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is to restore the right relation of these weights and\r\nall will again be harmonious. Do not interfere with the shoulders, but\r\nstraighten the front of the body by elevating the chest and raising\r\nthe head until it is supported directly on the spine, letting the\r\nshoulders take care of themselves. If the abdomen is now held back and\r\nthe gluteal muscles raised, the beautiful curves of the spine will be\r\nrestored, the shoulders will be straightened, and the internal organs\r\nwill have a chance to resume their natural position.\r\n\r\nA very easy way of finding out if you have the correct attitude is to\r\nplace your toes against the bottom of the door. Now bring your chest\r\nup to touch the door, and throw the lower part of the spine backward\r\nso that there will be a space between the abdomen and the door. Place\r\nthe head erect, with the chin drawn in towards the neck, and you will\r\nhave very nearly the correct attitude. It may seem a little tiresome\r\nat first, because you will be apt to hold yourself in position with\r\nneedless tension of muscles, but you will soon learn to relax the\r\nunnecessary tension, and then you will find the position the most\r\ncomfortable possible. You can walk farther without fatigue, and stand\r\nlonger without backache, because the body is placed in the attitude in\r\nwhich all parts occupy their designed relation to each other.\r\n\r\nOne very important fact is that in the wrong attitude the abdominal\r\norgans crowd down into the pelvis, while in the correct position they\r\nare supported and kept from sagging, so that the matter of a correct\r\nattitude is not only a matter of beauty, but also of health.\r\n\r\nIn sitting, also, the most comfortable posture is the most healthful;\r\nthat is, with the body squarely placed on the seat, and equally\r\nsupported upon the pelvis--not leaning back against the chair, unless\r\nthe chair should chance to be so constructed that it supports the\r\nlower part of the back and keeps the body erect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\"FEMALE DISEASES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear a great deal in these days of \"female diseases,\" by which is\r\nmeant the displacements of the organs of the reproductive system; that\r\nis, of the uterus, ovaries, etc. These displacements are many, for the\r\nuterus may not only drop down out of place, but it may be tipped\r\ntowards one side or the other, to the front or the back; or it may be\r\nbent upon itself in various directions. These different displacements\r\ncause much pain, and often result in ulcerations and profuse\r\ndischarges which are known as the \"whites,\" or scientifically as\r\nleucorrhea.\r\n\r\nI only mention these things incidentally, so that I may call your\r\nattention to the things you may do to prevent them.\r\n\r\nA great many girls and women are spending large sums of money in being\r\ndoctored for these difficulties who need not suffer with them at all\r\nif they had known how to dress healthfully; and many are bearing much\r\nanxiety over the possibility of becoming sufferers with these\r\ndistressing diseases who could have their burden of fear removed by\r\nthe knowledge that \"female diseases,\" in the great majority of cases,\r\nare the results of wrong habits of dress and life. Leucorrhea is not\r\na disease. It is a symptom of abnormal conditions, and to be cured it\r\nis needful that the conditions shall be understood.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg says, \"Leucorrhea may result from simple congestion of the\r\nbloodvessels of the vaginal mucous membrane, due to improper dress. It\r\nmay also be occasioned by taking cold, and by a debilitated condition\r\nof the stomach.\"\r\n\r\nLeucorrhea is merely an abnormal increase of a normal secretion. All\r\nmucous membrane secretes mucus in small quantities--enough to keep the\r\nmembrane moist. When from any cause this secretion is increased, we\r\nhave what is called a catarrhal condition. As all cavities that\r\ncommunicate with the air are lined with mucous membrane, this\r\ncatarrhal condition may exist in the nose, the throat, the eyes, the\r\nears, the bowels, or the reproductive organs, and will be named\r\naccording to the location.\r\n\r\nA natural increase of this secretion takes place just before and after\r\nmenstruation, and should occasion no anxiety, but if continued during\r\nthe remainder of the month, especially if very profuse, of offensive\r\nodor, or bloody in character, it needs the attention of the skilled\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to make you think constantly of yourself as diseased,\r\nand so I do not give you directions as to local self-treatment. Many\r\nsymptoms can be overcome by general care of the health-habits of the\r\ngirl, and if they do not yield to this general care it is better to\r\nconsult a responsible physician than to tamper with yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me give you a word of warning. If you need medical care,\r\nnever consult the traveling doctors who advertise to do such wonderful\r\nthings. They charge big fees and give a little medicine and then move\r\non, and you have no redress if they have not accomplished all that\r\nthey have promised. They live off the gullibility of people. Again,\r\nnever take patent medicines. Wonderful discoveries, favorite\r\nprescriptions and the like may be harmless, and they may not. And even\r\nif they are, how can you judge that they are suited to your special\r\ncase? That they cured some one else is not proof that they will\r\nbenefit you, and you run a risk by taking them as an experiment. One\r\nvery serious danger in the taking of patent medicines is the fact that\r\nthey are so largely alcoholic in composition, and girls and women have\r\nall too often been led into the alcohol habit and become habitual\r\ndrunkards through taking some advertised remedy.\r\n\r\nAnother has correctly said: \"If you need the consultation and advice\r\nof a physician go to your family physician, or, if you prefer, go to\r\nsome other physician; but always select one whose moral character and\r\nacknowledged ability render him a suitable and safe adviser in such a\r\ntime of need. Above all things avoid quacks. The policy they pursue is\r\nto frighten you, to work upon your imagination, and to make such\r\nalarming and unreliable statements as will induce you to purchase\r\ntheir nostrums and subject yourself to such a series of humiliations\r\nand impositions as will enable them to pilfer your purse and without\r\nrendering you in return any value received, but likely leave you in a\r\nmuch worse condition than they found you.\"\r\n\r\nYou will probably be advised by your personal friends, who may know of\r\nyour ailments, to take hot douches, and perhaps you may wonder why I\r\ndo not prescribe them for leucorrhea, and kindred difficulties.\r\n\r\nI do not commend them for the fact that I do not want you to be\r\nturning your constantly anxious thought towards yourself in these\r\nmatters. If you need such treatment, let it be prescribed by your\r\nphysician, who knows exactly your condition. As far as possible turn\r\nyour thoughts from the reproductive system. Take care of your general\r\nhealth, dress properly, obey all the rules of hygiene in regard to\r\ndiet, sleep, bathing, special cleanliness, and care, and then forget\r\nas far as possible the physical facts of womanhood.\r\n\r\nAn excellent addition to your general bathing can be taken once a week\r\nin the form of a sitz bath, which is effective for cleanliness, and\r\nalso for the reduction of congestion. If you have no sitz bath-tub,\r\nan ordinary wash-tub can be made to answer by raising one side an inch\r\nor two by means of some support. Have the water at a comfortable\r\ntemperature, say about 98 degrees, and if you have no thermometer you\r\ncan gauge the heat by putting in three gallons of cold water and add\r\none gallon of boiling water. Sit down in the tub and cover yourself\r\nwith a blanket. In about ten minutes add by degrees a gallon of cold\r\nwater. Remain sitting a minute or two longer, then rub dry.\r\n\r\nMany people are afraid to use cold water after hot, in bathing, for\r\nfear they will take cold, but that is just the way to prevent such a\r\nresult from the hot bath. The hot water has caused all the pores on\r\nthe surface of the body to open, and the bodily heat is rapidly lost\r\nthrough this cause. The cold water, quickly applied, causes the pores\r\nto close, leaves the skin in a tonic condition, and conserves the\r\nbodily heat. One should never take a hot bath without following it\r\nwith a _quick_ cold application to the surface. It should continue,\r\nhowever, but for a moment.\r\n\r\nThis kind of a bath is very useful for all chronic congestions of the\r\nabdominal and pelvic viscera, such as piles, constipation, painful\r\nmenstruation, leucorrhea, or other affections of the reproductive\r\norgans. It is also very helpful in headaches due to congestion of the\r\nbrain. If there is too little blood in the brain it might produce\r\nwakefulness, but when the brain is too full of blood this bath tends\r\nto produce sound and refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nA foot bath may be taken at the same time as the sitz bath, and in\r\nthis case the water should be warmer than that in the sitz bath, and\r\nas the person rises from the sitz bath she should step into it, so\r\nthat her feet will get the tonic effect of the cold water.\r\n\r\nThe average age at which menstruation first appears is fourteen, but\r\nsome girls menstruate as early as eleven, while others may not develop\r\ntill some years later. Frequently, when the girl does not manifest\r\nthis symptom of womanly development, the mother becomes anxious and\r\nbegins to give forcing medicines. She knows that girls often die with\r\nconsumption in their early young womanhood, and has heard that it was\r\nbecause they did not physically develop, and she fears that such\r\ndanger threatens her daughter, and imagines that if something can be\r\ndone to \"bring on her courses,\" as she expresses it, the danger will\r\nbe averted.\r\n\r\nIn this case she has reversed cause and effect. The consumptive girl\r\ndid not menstruate because she had not the vitality to do so. The\r\nconsumption was the cause, the non-menstruation the effect. To produce\r\nhemorrhage from the reproductive system by strong, forcing medicines\r\nis only to increase the danger. The only thing to do is to improve the\r\ngeneral health, and if the girl can increase in strength until she\r\nhas more vital force than suffices to keep her alive, the function\r\nthat is vital--not to her, but to the race--will establish itself.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the menses to appear at the average age may be due\r\nmerely to a slow development, and in this case there is nothing to do\r\nbut wait. If the girl seems well, if she has no backache, no headache,\r\nno general lassitude, no undue nervous symptoms, the mere\r\nnon-appearance of the menses need occasion no alarm. If, however, she\r\nhas these symptoms, it is an evidence that nature is attempting to\r\nestablish the function and is hindered either by general lack of\r\nvitality or by some local condition, and in either case the giving of\r\nforcing medicines would be a mistake. The weekly sitz bath would do no\r\nharm as a semi-local measure. All proper precautions should be\r\nobserved as to maintenance of general health and mental serenity, and\r\nif these do not prove sufficient the physician should be consulted.\r\n\r\nIn the case I mentioned, where the reproductive organs were lacking,\r\nthe girl had been subjected to a long course of home medication which\r\nhad proven disastrous to her digestion, and yet, as will be readily\r\nunderstood, had not resulted in the establishment of a function that\r\nis dependent upon organs which, in this case, did not exist.\r\n\r\nSometimes there are slight mechanical hindrances which can only be\r\ndetermined by the physician, though their presence will be indicated\r\nby the symptoms of menstruation without the accompanying sanguineous\r\ndischarge. In these cases the home medication is dangerous. If the\r\ngirl regularly has symptoms of approaching menstruation, with pain and\r\nbloating, and these subside without flow, it would be wise to consult\r\nthe physician instead of resorting to domestic remedies or letting the\r\nmatter go on without attention.\r\n\r\nQuite frequently the first appearance of menstruation is followed by\r\nweeks or even months of freedom from its reappearance. In these cases\r\nno alarm need be felt as long as the general health is not affected.\r\nAgain, there may be suspension of the function from change of\r\nsurroundings. Girls who go away to school often suffer from\r\nirregularity. I have known of a case where the girl never menstruated\r\nduring the school year, but was perfectly regular during vacations.\r\n\r\nThese cases may be accounted for by the nervous strain, the using up\r\nof vital forces in mental effort to such degree that there is nothing\r\nleft with which to carry on the menstrual function. In all such cases\r\nit is wise to watch carefully the general health, and if all functions\r\nare not properly conducted, to reduce the strain until the vitality is\r\nable to keep all functions in order.\r\n\r\nGirls are sometimes disturbed because the flow is scanty, and think\r\nthey should do something to increase the amount. It is no doubt true\r\nthat profuse menstrual flow is the result of our artificial lives. If\r\nwe lived more normally we should have naturally a scanty menstrual\r\nflow. Therefore if a girl has good health and no monthly pain and the\r\nflow is scanty, she may consider herself as more nearly in a normal\r\nstate, and be thankful.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the menses are suddenly less than normal it denotes a\r\nsuppression, which may be the result of cold, exhaustion of body,\r\nweariness of nerves, mental anxiety, or disturbance of the emotions.\r\n\r\nIf gradual suppression occurs, accompanied by loss of health, it\r\nindicates some constitutional difficulty or local trouble which\r\ndemands professional counsel.\r\n\r\nProfuse menstruation is also a relative term, as there is no definite\r\nstandard as to amount of menstrual flow, nor the length of time it\r\nshould continue. The profuseness must be measured by the condition of\r\nthe individual. Where health seems fully maintained there would appear\r\nno cause for anxiety. But if there is a marked increase over the\r\namount usual for the individual, if great weakness and prostration is\r\nproduced, either at the time or afterward, it may be called profuse,\r\nand the cause may be either debility, that is weakness, or plethora,\r\nwhich means fullness. If from the latter, there will be throbbing\r\nheadache, pain in the back, and general signs of fever. If from\r\ndebility, there will be pallor, weakness, and perhaps an almost\r\ncontinuous flow.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, the treatment in the two cases will differ. The\r\nfull-blooded girl should be put on a plain, unstimulating diet, with\r\nplenty of out-door exercise during the month, but about twenty-four\r\nhours before the flow is expected she should have complete mental and\r\nphysical rest. She should remain in bed, and apply cold wet cloths\r\nover the abdomen and between the thighs for an hour at a time, with\r\nintervals of at least one-half hour between the applications. The\r\nbowels should be freed from all fecal matter, and cool, small enemas\r\nbe given two or three times a day. If these simple measures do not\r\navail, the doctor should be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe pale and debilitated girl needs to rest. Sometimes, if hemorrhage\r\ncontinues almost from one period to the next, she should remain in bed\r\neven after the flow seems checked. The great desideratum is to build\r\nup the general health, not by tonics, which are usually only\r\nstimulants, but by the judicious observance of the laws of health.\r\nThis will, in many cases, call for the advice of the physician, who\r\ncan see and study the patient and her special conditions. It is not\r\nsafe to trust to book-doctoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCARE DURING MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that I do not want you to think yourself a semi-invalid\r\nand so be \"fussy\" about yourself, but I have also said that I want you\r\nto take care of yourself at all times, and especially during your\r\nmenstrual periods. How can you make these ideas agree with each other?\r\n\r\nI know that many writers say that a girl should spend one day each\r\nmonth in bed, or at least lying down; that there are some things that\r\nshould always be forbidden to girls, simply because they are girls,\r\nsuch as running up and down stairs. These wholesale restrictions make\r\ngirls rebellious at their womanhood. I simply want you to use good\r\nsense at all times in your care of yourself.\r\n\r\nKnowing the fact that just before and during menstruation the uterus\r\nis heavier than at other times, because engorged with blood, and\r\nremembering that it is loosely suspended, it is easy to understand\r\nthat long walks or severe exercise at the menstrual period will more\r\neasily cause it to sag, and this sagging becoming permanent may cause\r\npain, backache, and other discomforts. Therefore, having good sense,\r\nyou will not plan to take long rides or walks or do any severe\r\nexercise. At the same time moderate exercise in proper clothing will\r\ntend to relieve pelvic congestion by equalizing the circulation, and\r\nif the clothing is properly adjusted and the muscles are strong and\r\nwell-developed, an ordinary amount of physical activity may be\r\nbeneficial rather than harmful.\r\n\r\nGirls are so often told that they must not walk at their monthly\r\nperiods, must not study, must not ride, etc., etc., that it really is\r\nno wonder that they feel it a very undesirable thing to be a woman. My\r\nobservation leads me to believe that if girls from earliest childhood\r\nwere dressed loosely, with no clothing suspended on the hips, if their\r\nmuscles were well developed through judicious exercise, they would\r\nseldom find it necessary to be semi-invalids at any time. In fact, we\r\ndo sometimes find a young woman who has no consciousness of physical\r\ndisturbance during menstruation. She can pursue her usual avocations\r\nwithout hindrance, and finds her physical womanhood no bar to any\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nThis is as it should be; but as girls have not all been well developed\r\nand properly dressed, we cannot assert that all girls can be\r\nindifferent to physical conditions at this time. If a girl is well,\r\nhas no pain or discomfort, then I would say, let her use good common\r\nsense in the ordering of her daily life and give the matter no special\r\nor anxious thought. If she has pain or uneasiness, let her govern her\r\nlife accordingly, using care, taking some rest at the time of the\r\nmenses; but, above all things, let her arrange her clothing at all\r\ntimes so as to secure for herself absolute freedom of movement. Then\r\nlet her, during the intervals between the menstrual periods, endeavor\r\nby judicious exercise to build up strong muscular structure around the\r\nvital organs, such structure as will support the _viscera_ where they\r\nbelong, and in time she will probably find herself growing free from\r\nmenstrual pain.\r\n\r\nDuring the painful periods resulting from congestion it is often\r\nadvisable to keep the recumbent position, and to use heat both\r\nexternally and internally. However, I would advise never using\r\nalcoholic beverages. Their apparent usefulness lies principally in the\r\nhot water with which they are administered, and the danger of forming\r\nthe alcohol habit is too great to justify their use.\r\n\r\nThere are cases of nervous pain at menstruation that are aggravated by\r\nheat and diminished by cold. I knew such a case where a girl at\r\nschool, suffering with menstrual pain, alarmed teachers and friends by\r\nwringing towels out of cold water and laying them over her abdomen.\r\nBut the alarm subsided when they saw that the pain soon passed away\r\nunder the cold application. The girl was one in whom there were no\r\nlocal congestions, but great nervous exhaustion and heat always\r\nincreased her sufferings, while cold allayed.\r\n\r\nI have read that a woman should not bathe or change her underwear\r\nwhile menstruating. I cannot see how soiled clothing can be more\r\nhealthful than that which is clean; and if well-aired, I should no\r\nmore object to your putting on clean underwear than to your changing\r\nyour dress. Most especially would I advise a frequent change of\r\nnapkins, in order to remove those which are soiled from their\r\nirritating contact with the body. A full bath during menstruation\r\nwould, for most people, be unadvisable, but the cleansing of the\r\nprivate parts is imperative. For this, tepid water, with good soap,\r\nmay be used daily or oftener. Other parts of the body may be rubbed\r\nwith a wet cloth, followed by vigorous, dry rubbing. Cleanliness at\r\nall times is certainly a mark of refinement.\r\n\r\nYou should use good sense and not run out in thin slippers on wet or\r\ncold ground; but if your feet get wet through accident, keep in motion\r\nuntil you can make a change of shoes and stockings. There is little\r\ndanger from wet feet to those in good health, if they keep in vigorous\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nAs to other rules, they are those that pertain to the care of health\r\nat all times: loose clothing, deep breathing, wholesome food, plenty\r\nof sleep, sunlight, pure air, exercise according to your strength,\r\nand, above all, serenity of mind, accepting the fact of physical\r\nwomanhood, together with a recognition of its sacredness and dignity.\r\n\r\nAs a minor item, I would suggest that the napkins be fastened to\r\nstraps that go over the shoulder and are then joined together in front\r\nand back to an end piece, on each of which a button is sewn.\r\nButtonholes in the napkins at the corners, diagonal from each other,\r\nwill make them easily attached or removed. The napkins should be of a\r\nmaterial that is quickly absorbent of the flow. Cheesecloth is cheap,\r\nand can be burned or otherwise disposed of after using. It may be\r\nprotected by an outer strip of unbleached muslin which is almost\r\nwater-proof.\r\n\r\nA very comfortable way of arranging napkins that are to be used from\r\ntime to time is to take a piece of linen or cotton diaper sixteen\r\ninches square. About three inches from one end, make on each side an\r\nincision four inches long. Fold this strip in the middle lengthwise,\r\nand sew together up to the end of the incisions. This makes a band\r\nwith a sort of pocket in the middle. Hem the cut edges. Fold the\r\nnapkin over, four inches on each side, that is as deep as the\r\nincisions. Then fold crosswise until you can enclose the whole in the\r\npocket in the band. This makes a thick center and thin ends by which\r\nto attach the napkin to the suspender.\r\n\r\nI hold that mental serenity is one of the essentials of healthful\r\nmenstrual periods, and this cannot be had if the mind is continually\r\ntroubled and the thought centered on the physical condition. I would\r\nbe glad to have your mind freed from the ideas of sex matters as far\r\nas possible. It is a scientific fact that thinking continually of an\r\norgan tends to disturb that organ. I know a man who was so afraid of\r\nheart disease that he felt of his pulse every few minutes and kept a\r\nstethoscope on the head of his bed to listen to his heart in the\r\nnight. I would have been surprised had he not had heart trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSOLITARY VICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the reproductive system awakens to activity it naturally attracts\r\nthe attention of the girl, and an effort should be made to call her\r\nthoughts to other themes.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, the reading of sensational love stories is most\r\ndetrimental. The descriptions of passionate love scenes arouse in the\r\nreader a thrill through her own sexual organism that tends to increase\r\nits activity and derange its normal state. Girls often mature into\r\nwomen earlier than they should, because through romances, through\r\njests of associates in regard to beaus and lovers, and through\r\nindulgence in sentimental fancies their sexual systems are unduly\r\nstimulated and aroused. This stimulation sometimes leads to the\r\nformation of an evil habit, known as self-abuse. The stimulation of\r\nthe sex organs is accompanied with a pleasurable sensation, and this\r\nexcitement may be created by mechanical means, or even by thought.\r\nMany girls who are victims of this most injurious habit are unaware of\r\nits dangers, although they instinctively feel that they do not want it\r\nknown. Others who would not stoop to a mechanical exciting of\r\nthemselves do so through thoughts, and do not know that they are just\r\nas truly guilty of self-abuse as the girl who uses the hand or other\r\nmechanical means.\r\n\r\nThe results of self-abuse are most disastrous. It destroys mental\r\npower and memory, it blotches the complexion, dulls the eye, takes\r\naway the strength, and may even cause insanity. It is a habit most\r\ndifficult to overcome, and may not only last for years, but in its\r\ntendency be transmitted to one's children.\r\n\r\nIf you have from the first thought nobly of yourself, you will have\r\nfallen into no such debasing habit. But if, through ignorance, you\r\nhave acquired it, how shall you overcome it?\r\n\r\nI should hesitate to write more on this subject did I not know that\r\nmany girls fall victims to this evil through ignorance, and many who\r\nthus fall could and would have been saved had they been rightly\r\ninstructed. I therefore desire that you shall be wise.\r\n\r\nEvery normal function of the body is attended with a pleasurable\r\nsensation. We enjoy eating, seeing, walking. Odors bring sensations\r\nwhich are agreeable, the sense of touch may give pleasure, and as we\r\nenjoy these sensations in fact, so we may enjoy them in memory or in\r\nimagination. We can recall the beauty of the rose, the perfume of the\r\nmignonette, the flavor of the orange, or we can imagine new\r\ncombinations of these delights. We feel joy or grief through reading\r\nvivid descriptions, or we can ourselves create imaginary scenes in\r\nwhich we are actors, who suffer or enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe reproductive system is the seat of great nervous susceptibility,\r\nand the excitation of these nerves gives a pleasurable sensation. This\r\nexcitation may be thought a local mechanical irritation or it may be\r\nmental. In little children it may be caused by lack of cleanliness of\r\nthe external organs. An irritation is produced, and an attempt to\r\nallay this by rubbing produces an agreeable feeling, which may be\r\nrepeated until the evil habit of self-abuse is formed.\r\n\r\nSometimes constipation, by creating a pelvic congestion, will have the\r\nsame result. Sometimes clothing which is too small may, by undue\r\npressure on the parts, call the thought of the child to these organs,\r\nand in an attempt to remove the pressure by pulling the clothing away\r\nthe habit may be begun.\r\n\r\nSometimes the tiny pin-worms in the rectum may wander into the vagina,\r\nand the little girl feel a constant annoyance, which rubbing allays\r\ntemporarily, but which results in the evil habit of the use of the\r\nhands to produce an agreeable sensation. Thus through avoidable causes\r\nthe evil habit may be acquired. Then it may be taught by one thus\r\nlearning it to another who, without this instruction, would never have\r\nacquired it.\r\n\r\nBut new dangers arise as the girl approaches the age when the\r\nreproductive system begins to take on the activity that indicates\r\napproaching womanhood. The normal congestion of the parts causes a\r\nhitherto unknown consciousness of sex, and unless she is warned she\r\nmay at this period acquire the habit without knowing its evils.\r\n\r\nAll functions necessary to the preservation of the individual life are\r\nattended with pleasure, and so are those which are for the\r\ncontinuation of the species. While the emotion may be pleasurable, it\r\nis at the same time the most exhausting, that can be experienced. We\r\nsee that in some forms of animal existence parenthood is purchased at\r\nthe expense of the life of the parent; and while in the human being\r\nthe procreative act does not kill, it exhausts, and no doubt takes\r\nfrom the vital force of those exercising it. One can feel justified to\r\nlose a part of her own life if she is conferring life upon others, but\r\nto indulge in such a waste of vital force merely for pleasure is\r\ncertainly never excusable, and least excusable of all is the arousing\r\nof pleasurable emotions by a direct violation of natural law.\r\n\r\nThe only natural method of arousing a recognition of sexual feeling is\r\nas God has appointed in holy marriage, and the self-respecting girl\r\nfeels that no approach of personal familiarity is either right or\r\nproper. But it may be that she does not know that feelings may be\r\nawakened by the imagination which are as wrong morally as, and more\r\ninjurious physically than, actual deeds, and so may allow her mind to\r\nrevel in fancies that would shock her as actualities.\r\n\r\nI received a letter not long ago from a young woman who most\r\nemphatically asserted that she would never, never, never permit\r\nfamiliarities, and then most innocently says, \"but it wouldn't be\r\nwrong to imagine yourself enjoying the embrace of some certain one,\r\nwould it?\"\r\n\r\nIt is just this idea that there is no wrong in thought that weakens\r\nvirtue's fortress and renders it easily demolished. Girls who would\r\nshrink from use of mechanical means to arouse sexual desire will\r\npermit themselves to revel in imaginary scenes of love-making with\r\nreal or unreal individuals, or in mental pictures which arouse the\r\nspasmodic feelings of sexual pleasure, and yet be unaware that they\r\nare guilty of self-abuse.\r\n\r\nSexual feeling in itself is not base, but it can be debased either in\r\nthought or in deed. Rightly considered, it is the indication of the\r\npossession of the most sacred powers, that of the perpetuation of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"Passion is the instinct for preservation of one's kind, the voice of\r\nthe life principle, the sign of creative power.\" These last four words\r\nopen before us a wonderful field of thought. \"Creative power!\" What\r\ndoes that mean? Is creative power limited to reproduction of kind? Do\r\nyou not create when you work out with brain some idea and then embody\r\nit in some visible form? Worth is said to create an artistic dress,\r\nthe actor creates his part in the play, the musician creates the\r\narrangement of harmonies which are represented in musical signs, and\r\nin the same sense you may be in a myriad of ways a creator.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of activity of sexual life in yourself came\r\nincreased development and new energy, beauty, and power, and the\r\npreservation and right use of that life will continue to be a source\r\nof power. \"When the signs of this creative power come throbbing and\r\npulsing in every fiber, it only shows that one has more and greater\r\nability to create than ever before. One knows by this that she can now\r\ndo greater work than she has done or is doing;\" so says one writer.\r\n\r\nIs it not a beautiful thought that this feeling, which we have\r\nsupposed we must fight as something low, is in reality the stirring of\r\na divine impulse which we can control and govern and make to serve us\r\nin all high and noble deeds?\r\n\r\nIf you hold such noble thoughts in your heart concerning yourself, you\r\nwill need no threatenings to keep you from self-debasement and\r\nself-defilement. You will not need to be told of the loss of physical\r\nstrength or of beauty, of memory or of reason, through evil habits of\r\nsolitary vice, for they will have no temptation for you, even as you\r\ndo not need threats of police and prisons to keep you from stealing,\r\nbecause honesty is the active and guiding principle of your life.\r\n\r\nBut supposing you have already acquired the evil habit and are now\r\nawakened to the wrong you are doing yourself; you observe the lack of\r\nlustre in the eye, the sallow, blotched complexion; you realize your\r\nloss of nerve-power manifested in cold and clammy hands, backache,\r\nlassitude, irritability, lack of memory, and inability to concentrate\r\nthought. What shall you do to overcome and to gain control of\r\nyourself? The question is a serious one, for no habit is more\r\ntyrannical than the dominion of unrestrained sexual desire. Its\r\nvictims often fight for years, only to be conquered at last. If there\r\nwas no cure but in fighting, I should feel that the case was almost\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing to do is to change the mental attitude in regard\r\nto the whole matter of sex; to hold it in thought as sacred, holy,\r\nconsecrated to the highest of all functions, that of procreation.\r\nRecognize that, conserved and controlled, it becomes a source of\r\nenergy to the individual. Cleanse the mind of all polluting images by\r\nsubstituting this purer thought; then go to work to establish correct\r\nhabits of living in dress, diet, exercise, etc. See to it that there\r\nare no such causes of pelvic congestions as prolapsed bowels, caused\r\nby tight clothing or constipation; keep the skin active; and, above\r\nall, keep the mind healthfully occupied.\r\n\r\nThe victim of self-abuse has, through the frequent repetition of the\r\nhabit, built up an undue amount of brain that is sensitive to local\r\nirritation of the sex-organs or to mental pictures of sex-pleasure.\r\nShe must now allow this part of the brain to become quiescent, and she\r\nshould go to work to build up other brain centers. Let her train her\r\nsight by close observation of form, color, size, location. Let her\r\ncultivate her sense of hearing in the study of different qualities of\r\nsound, tone, pitch, intensity, duration, timbre; her sense of touch,\r\nby learning to judge with closed eyes of different materials, of\r\nquality of fiber, of the different degrees of temperature, of\r\nroughness or smoothness, of density; in fact, let her endeavor to\r\nbecome alert, observant, along all the lines of sense-perception. Let\r\nher study nature, leaf-forms, cloud-shapes, insects, flowers, birds,\r\nbird-songs, the causes of natural phenomena; and, above all, let her\r\nkeep out of the realm of the artificial, the sentimental, the\r\nemotional, and, holding firmly to the thought that creative energy is\r\nsymbolized by desire and can be dignified and consecrated to noblest\r\npurposes, she will find herself daily growing into a stronger, more\r\nbeautiful self-control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nBE GOOD TO YOURSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nI witnessed the other day a parting between two men. The elder, as he\r\ntook the younger by the hand, said, \"Good-by, my boy; be good to\r\nyourself;\" and the younger responded, heartily, \"Oh, there is no\r\ndanger but I'll be that.\" I wondered, as I saw the laughing face, so\r\nfull of the indications of the love of pleasure, if he really would be\r\ngood to himself, or if he would interpret it to mean to indulge\r\nhimself in all kinds of sensuous gratification. It is a great thing to\r\nbe truly good to one's self, and I would give the injunction with the\r\nhighest ideal. Be good to your real self with that true goodness that\r\nsees the end from the beginning, that realizes the tendency of certain\r\nforms of pleasure, and that claims the privilege of being master of\r\nthe senses, and not their slave.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" you say, rather deprecatingly, \"you can't expect young people\r\nto act as staid and wise as you old folks. We want some fun.\" So you\r\ndo, and that is perfectly right. You should want fun and have fun. All\r\nI ask is that you shall try to understand what real, true fun is.\r\n\r\nI have seen young folks pull the chair from under some one \"for fun,\"\r\nand the result was pain and perhaps permanent injury to the object of\r\nthe joke.\r\n\r\nI have known young men to imagine they were having \"fun\" when they\r\nwent on a spree, to get \"gloriously drunk,\" as they phrased it. You\r\ncan see no fun in this. You realize that it is a most serious tragedy,\r\nwith not an element of real fun in it, involving, as it does, the loss\r\nof health, the risking of life, the possibility of crime, the\r\nheart-break of friends, and perhaps even death. It is altogether a\r\nwrong idea of fun.\r\n\r\nI have known girls in the secrecy of their rooms to smoke cigarettes\r\n\"for fun,\" and in that I am sure that you see no amusement. It was a\r\nlowering of the standard of womanhood; it was tampering with a poison;\r\nit was something to be ashamed of, rather than something to call fun.\r\n\r\nI have known young men and women to enter into flirtations \"for fun.\"\r\nI knew a girl whose chief delight seemed to be in getting young men in\r\nlove with her, only to cast them aside when tired of their adoration.\r\nShe called this fun, but it was cruelty. In olden times men amused\r\nthemselves by throwing Christians to wild beasts and watching them\r\nwhile being torn to pieces. This was their idea of fun, and the\r\nflirt's idea of amusement seems to be of the same order. She plays\r\nwith the man as the cat with the mouse, and experiences no pangs of\r\nconscience when, torn and bleeding in heart, she tosses him aside for\r\na new victim.\r\n\r\nThere are other young people who would not enter into such serious\r\nflirtations, and yet are unduly familiar with each other. They mean\r\nnothing by their endearments and familiarities, and neither will\r\nsuffer any pangs when the pleasant intimacy is ended. Can we not call\r\nthis innocent fun? They have indulged in some unobserved\r\nhand-pressures, or a few stolen kisses; but neither believed the other\r\nto mean anything serious. It was only fun; what harm could there be in\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMany girls to-day are reasoning thus, and many of these may pass\r\nthrough the experience without loss of reputation; they may\r\nsubsequently marry honorably, and become respected and beloved\r\nmothers. But ask any of these girls, in her mature years, when her own\r\ndaughters are growing up around her, if she wants them to pass through\r\nthe same experiences. I once knew a beautiful young woman who thought\r\nit was fun to have these familiar intimacies with young men, because,\r\nas she said, she knew how far to go. I saw her in her maturity, with\r\ndaughters of her own, and heard her say that when she recalled her own\r\ngirlish escapades, even in the darkness of the night the blushes would\r\nrush over her from head to foot, and in heartfelt agony she would say\r\nto herself, \"Oh, I wonder if my girls will ever do so?\"\r\n\r\nIt was fun to her in her girlhood; it was shame to her in her mature\r\nremembrance; it was agony when she saw it possible to her own\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nTrue fun is fun in anticipation, fun in realization, fun in\r\nretrospection, and fun in seeing it repeated by succeeding\r\ngenerations. If it fails to be fun in any of these instances, it fails\r\nto be genuine.\r\n\r\nI like to see young people full of vivacity. I like to hear their\r\nmerry laughter, to witness their innocent pranks; but I do not like to\r\nsee them laughing at the sufferings of others, or amusing themselves\r\nwith dangers of any kind. Above all, I regret to see them playing with\r\nthe fire of physical passion.\r\n\r\nMany a girl who to-day is lost to virtue had no idea that she was\r\nstarting on this downward road. She was only having a good time. She\r\nwas pretty, attractive, and admired. Young men flattered her with\r\nwords, and when they held her hand, or put their arm around her, she\r\ntook it as another compliment to her charms. She did not see that it\r\nwas only selfishness, only a desire to feel the thrills of physical\r\npleasure which this contact with her person aroused. She would have\r\nfelt humiliated had she recognized this fact, and it seems to me that\r\ngirls should understand the feelings that prompt young men to take\r\npersonal familiarities.\r\n\r\nThe young man might deny the fact to the girl, but he understands it\r\nwell enough as a fact, and he loses a measure of respect for her\r\nbecause she is willing to permit his advances. The girl no doubt\r\nimagines that these are sweet little secrets between herself and the\r\nyoung man, when perhaps he is discussing her openly with his young men\r\nfriends. I have even heard such discussions on railway trains, carried\r\non in no very low tones, between young men, well dressed and with all\r\nthe outward appearances of gentlemen, and I have wondered how Jennie\r\nand Sadie and Clara and Nellie, whose names I heard openly mentioned,\r\nwould have felt to have heard themselves described as \"a nice, soft\r\nlittle thing to hug,\" or \"she knows how to kiss.\"\r\n\r\nDo you imagine these young men would have thus spoken had they truly\r\nrespected the girls? They might say \"They are nice girls,\" but would\r\nthey say, in their deeper consciousness, \"They are true,\r\nself-respecting, womanly girls, and I honor them?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is a girl to do?\" asks one. \"If she is prudish she won't get\r\nany attention. She has to allow a certain innocent freedom, or young\r\nmen won't go with her.\"\r\n\r\nDo you really believe that, dear girl? Let me tell you what young men\r\nhave said to me. Said one, \"O, we have to be familiar with the girls.\r\nThey all expect it, and would be offended if we were just friendly and\r\nmanifested no familiarities.\" Do you suppose girls ever thought of the\r\npossibility of the young men saying that? When they are pleading for\r\npermission to be familiar they do sometimes say, \"Why, all the girls\r\nallow it,\" but they also add, \"so there can be no harm;\" while among\r\nthemselves they are laughing at the credulity of the girls, or\r\naccusing them of making it necessary for the young men to take\r\n\"innocent\" liberties in order to have the good will of the girls.\r\n\r\nA young man may assure you most emphatically that he respects you none\r\nthe less, although you allow him to hold your hand or kiss you at\r\nparting, but he knows it is not true, and he will admit it to others\r\nrather than to the girl herself. Truthful young men say, \"Of course,\r\nwe have the most respect for the girls who keep us at a distance.\"\r\n\"But they won't pay us attention,\" say the girls. \"Is that so?\" I\r\nasked of a young man. \"Are you more earnest in pursuit of the girl who\r\ncourts approaches, or the girl who holds you at bay?\" \"Why!\" responded\r\nhe, with emphasis, \"the girls ought to know that a boy wants most that\r\nwhich is hardest to get; but we are actually obliged to treat the\r\ngirls with familiarity or they won't go with us.\" And this young man\r\nseemed really surprised when I assured him that girls supposed they\r\nwere obliged to accept caresses in order to have the attention of\r\nyoung men. Then this same young man spoke of something that I know to\r\nbe too often true. He said, \"It is strange, if the girls don't want\r\nthese things, that they act as they do, for they actually invite\r\nfamiliarity. In fact, many times I would have been glad to be\r\nrespectfully friendly, but the girls did not seem satisfied, and by\r\nmany little ways and manners they indicated that they were ready to be\r\ncaressed. I think they mean to be good girls, but they put an awful\r\nlot of temptation in a fellow's way.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt these girls did not realize what they were doing, but I\r\nbelieve every young woman should have so clear an understanding of\r\nhuman nature as to know that she is playing with a dangerous fire when\r\nshe allows caresses and unbecoming familiarity. She ought to know\r\nthat, while she may hold herself above criminal deeds, if she permits\r\nfondlings and caresses she may be directly responsible for arousing a\r\npassion in the young man that may lead him to go out from her presence\r\nand seek the company of dissolute women, and thus lose his honor and\r\npurity because a girl who called herself virtuous tempted him. Is she\r\nin truth more honorable than the outcast woman? She has allowed\r\nfamiliarities in the matter of embraces and kisses, and she may not\r\nknow what thoughts have been inspired in the mind of the young man by\r\nher unguarded conduct. She may feel indignant at the suggestion,\r\nbecause she has meant no harm, but in reality she should blush that\r\nher own familiar conduct has given him a tacit right to think of her\r\nwith even greater freedom.\r\n\r\nGirls have a wonderful responsibility in regard even to the moral\r\nconduct of young men, and the self-respecting girl will guard herself\r\nnot only from the contamination of touch, but from an undue freedom of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nDo you say she cannot govern the thoughts of men? I reply, she can to\r\na great extent. By a dress that exposes her person to public gaze, or\r\neven more seductively hides it under a film of suggestive lace, she\r\nhas given a direction to the thoughts of those who look at her. She\r\nhas declared that their eyes may touch her, that their thoughts may be\r\noccupied with an inventory of her physical charms. She has openly\r\nannounced that she is willing to be appraised by eyes of men as a\r\nbeautiful animal. What wonder if their thoughts go further than her\r\npublic declaration, and that they may freely surmise the charms that\r\nstill remain hidden?\r\n\r\nWhen a girl, by putting herself into graceful attitudes in tempting\r\nnearness to a young man, casts coquettish glances, she has done that\r\nwhich will give a turn to the thought which may prove provocative of\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of that girl,\" said a young man who desired to live\r\npurely. \"May be she does not mean it, but her poses and glances make\r\nit almost impossible for me to keep my hands off of her. I am obliged\r\nto leave her for fear that I shall kiss her when she looks so\r\nmischievously alluring.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl, perhaps, would have been flattered by the kiss and indignant\r\nat further liberties, yet would have felt no compunctions had her\r\nvictim been inflamed by a passion that he lacked the power to control,\r\nprompting him to seek some other girl to be his prey.\r\n\r\nYou think men should have self-control. So they should. We will not\r\nlessen the blame of the young man, but the girl who puts the\r\ntemptation in his way, even if she did not herself yield to it, is not\r\nguiltless.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of a pure woman should be the safeguard and not the\r\ndestruction of a man, and she can be his protector, even as he is\r\nhers. I heard an eminent woman say that woman was man's moral\r\nprotector, and man woman's physical protector, and I said that is only\r\nhalf true. Man is also woman's moral protector, and woman is also\r\nman's physical protector. She is acknowledged to be his physical\r\ntempter. If she knows her power she can, by her wise, modest, womanly\r\ndemeanor, make it impossible for him to feel an impure impulse in her\r\npresence. Ruskin says:\r\n\r\n\"You cannot think that the buckling on of the knight's armor by his\r\nlady's hand was a mere caprice of romantic fashion. It is the type of\r\nan eternal truth--that the soul's armor is never well set to the heart\r\nunless a woman's hand has braced it; and it is only when she braces it\r\nloosely that the honor of manhood fails. Know you not those lovely\r\nlines--I would they were learned by all youthful ladies of England--\r\n\r\n    \"'Ah wasteful woman! she who may\r\n      On her sweet self set her own price,\r\n    Knowing he cannot choose but pay--\r\n      How has she cheapen'd Paradise!\r\n    How given for nought her priceless gift,\r\n      How spoiled the bread and spill'd the wine,\r\n    Which, spent with due, respective thrift,\r\n      Had made brutes men, and men divine!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFRIENDSHIP BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might like to know, dear reader, if I do not believe in some\r\nintermediate relation between that of the comrade and the lover--a\r\nmore intimate relation than the one and less intimate than the other.\r\nYou ask, Cannot a young man and a young woman be real, true friends?\r\n\r\nLet us talk a little about friendship and what it implies. I should\r\ndefine a friend as one who believes in me, who expects much of me, who\r\nencourages me to do the best that is in me, who will tell me of my\r\nfaults, who recognizes my virtues, who trusts in my honor.\r\n\r\nYou are willing to accept that definition, and you think it possible\r\nto be all that to each other without being lovers. I believe it, too,\r\nbut I would like to make some further statements before we have the\r\ndiscussion of this question.\r\n\r\nI believe that a girl's first and best friends are her parents; her\r\nwisest _confidante_, her mother. To these she may speak unreservedly\r\nof herself. With these she may freely talk over family matters. In a\r\nfriendship with some outside the family it would be unwise to discuss\r\nfamily matters. It might be an unkindness to other members of the\r\nfamily, and in case of a break in the friendship the family secrets\r\nmight be betrayed, and to the detriment of the trusting friend. I once\r\nread of such an affair, where one girl had confided to another certain\r\nmatters that reflected on the honor of her family, and when the\r\nfriendship was broken the secret was betrayed, to the public shame of\r\nthe girl who had been unwise in her confidences.\r\n\r\nTrue honor would forbid the betrayal of a confidence even after the\r\nrupture of a friendship; but all persons have not the highest ideal of\r\nhonor. If the girl is not discreet in her revelation of herself, and\r\nher mother is her only _confidante_, it will not be so serious a\r\nmatter, for the mother will never be tempted to reveal to others\r\nanything that would bring scorn or criticism upon her child. Nowhere,\r\nin her girlish ignorance, can the girl find as sincere sympathy as in\r\nthe loving mother.\r\n\r\n\"But all mothers are not sympathetic,\" you say. \"They are often\r\nnagging, and use the confidences of the daughter to make her\r\nuncomfortable.\" Well, if this be so, you, at least, can learn the\r\nlesson, and by your habits of thought fit yourself to be the wise,\r\nloving, companionable, sympathetic _confidante_ of your daughter, for\r\nyou will be anxious that she should have no friend so close as\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that mothers should recognize the individuality of\r\ntheir daughters, and win, rather than command, confidence. It is\r\ndifficult for us, as mothers, to realize that our daughter is just as\r\nmuch a separate individual as is our neighbor's daughter, and that we\r\nhave no right to thrust ourselves upon her, no right to demand that\r\nshe shall love us. We have the right to sympathize, to counsel, to\r\ndirect her conduct so long as she remains in our personal care, but we\r\nshould remember that she must be responsible, that she is a soul and\r\nmust live her own life, learn her own lessons, suffer her own\r\nexperiences. Our deepest love can only enable us to help her to choose\r\nwisely, to think truly, to act judiciously. So I would have the\r\nfriendship of mother and daughter something very deep and\r\ntrue--something more than a petting and caressing, an indulging or\r\nhumoring.\r\n\r\nI would be inclined to have less outward demonstration and more inner\r\ntenderness. I believe that very often outward impression comes largely\r\nto take the place of true affection. I see girls who kiss and fondle\r\ntheir mothers, who never open to them their heart's deepest secrets.\r\nFewer kisses and more confidence would satisfy more thoroughly the\r\nmother's heart. I believe that, even in the family, a kiss should not\r\nbecome a conventionality. It should have a meaning. I would rather\r\nthat my daughter should kiss me once a week, with a spontaneous desire\r\nthus to express her love, than that, from custom, she should kiss me\r\nmorning, noon, and night.\r\n\r\nThere are sanitary reasons against kissing, such as transmission of\r\ngerms of disease; but aside from this, there are affectional reasons\r\nwhy kisses should be few, and these few spontaneous rather than\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nWe ought never to force our kisses upon children; but, recognizing\r\ntheir individuality, leave them free to proffer or to refuse.\r\n\r\nNext to the friendship of parents should come that of brother and\r\nsister. We almost think it a wonder when members of the same family\r\nseem really to love each other, and yet family ties should be the\r\nstrongest in the world. Why should there not be the sweetest intimacy\r\nbetween two sisters, whose lives and interests are so closely united?\r\nWhy should not the bond between mother and sister be indissoluble?\r\n\r\nA young man and woman, children of the same parents, brought up in the\r\nsame home, ought to be the best of friends. Their friendship is\r\nwithout the danger of misunderstanding. It can be free from the slight\r\nfeeling of envy or jealousy that might arise between sisters. It would\r\nseem that it could be the truest comradeship possible to two young\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nA sister should be to a brother not merely some one at hand to mend\r\nhis gloves or make his neckties, not simply some one to fondle and\r\nindulge, but she should be one whom he would never scold or browbeat.\r\nA brother should not be simply some one to run errands, to call on for\r\nhelp in emergencies, not some one to tease when the spirit of mischief\r\nprompts, or to scold when things have gone wrong.\r\n\r\nI would have the love of these two manifest itself in all true\r\nhelpfulness, but in a way that would draw out the noblest\r\nself-reliance in each. It should manifest itself in courteous words,\r\nin helpful deeds, in glances of the eye, in tones of the voice, in\r\nheartfelt sympathies that stimulate to nobler deeds, in every way that\r\nstrengthens and uplifts; and if caresses are few, they will not be\r\nmissed in the wealth of that truer manifestation which makes the\r\nrecipient feel his nobility and worth.\r\n\r\nA young lady once asked me if I believed in young people who were not\r\nrelated treating each other as brother and sister, and I replied that\r\nwould depend on how the brother and sister treated each other. I have\r\nseen girls treat brothers in ways that other young men would not\r\nenjoy--finding fault, nagging, and snubbing generally. I have seen\r\nyoung men browbeat their sisters, tease them, and be continually\r\nunkind. I presume, if such a young man should propose to be a brother\r\nto a girl, he would not purpose to treat her in this way. Young people\r\nsometimes like to try to deceive themselves, and they fancy that the\r\nsubterfuge of calling each other brother and sister will be a warrant\r\nfor the parting kiss or the tender endearment that they enjoy, but\r\nwhich they feel proprieties will not allow. The subterfuge is too\r\ntransparent. It deceives no one, and it does not make right that\r\nwhich, without it, would be improper.\r\n\r\nPlatonic friendships--that is, friendships between men and women\r\nwithout the element of physical love--are rare; rarer, indeed, than\r\nthey should be. They are difficult to maintain because of the\r\ntemptation to begin in the indulgences of personal familiarities,\r\nwhich tend to lead the friendship over into debatable ground. Men and\r\nwomen ought to be grand, true friends, inciting each other to the\r\nnoblest achievements, but it never can be through sentimentality.\r\n\r\nA girl may think she is sisterly when she listens to the young man's\r\ncry for sympathy in some trouble, and she holds his hand and smoothes\r\nhis hair and comforts him after this tender fashion, and he may go\r\naway feeling comforted, even as a baby might be quieted by petting;\r\nbut his moral fiber has not been strengthened; he has not been made to\r\nfeel stronger to do and dare.\r\n\r\nSupposing she had listened with interest to his story, and then,\r\nwithout laying her hands upon him, she had said, \"You are a man, a\r\nprince, the son of a King. You are strong to bear, brave to do.\r\nObstacles surmounted give broader outlooks. Burdens bravely borne\r\nbring strength. I believe in you;\" and then, with a strong, firm--I\r\nhad almost said manly--grasp of the hand, she had sent him away, he\r\nwould go feeling stronger, braver, more self-reliant, stimulated,\r\nencouraged, not merely soothed and quieted. In this fashion a girl may\r\ntreat a young man as a brother. She may tell him his faults in all\r\nkindness. She may listen to his dreams, ambitions, aspirations, and\r\nencourage with approval, incite by gentle sarcasm, or enliven by\r\nkindly sportiveness; but her person is her own, and he should be made\r\nto feel that beyond these bounds he may not pass. Such friendship may\r\nendure vicissitude, or separation, and be through life a source of\r\ntruest inspiration. To be such a friend to a noble man is a worthy\r\nambition. It would prove the possession of more qualities of\r\nwomanliness than merely to win his passionate love.\r\n\r\nWhen the world comes to accept the highest ideals of life and believes\r\nthat all relations of men and women are not of necessity founded on\r\nphysical attraction, then will such friendships be more possible, and\r\nthe earth can offer no more desirable future than that in which men\r\nand women, knowing each other as immortal intelligences, shall leave\r\nthe vale of unsafe sentimentality and sensuous poison to dwell on\r\nheights of noble companionship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nFRIENDSHIP BETWEEN GIRLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou think, perhaps, that I can find no fault with the friendship of\r\ngirls with each other, that that certainly is safe and pleasant. I\r\nhave said enough for you to understand that I believe in reserve even\r\nin girl friendships. Girls are apt at certain periods of their lives\r\nto be rather gushing creatures. They form most sentimental attachments\r\nfor each other. They go about with their arms around each other, they\r\nloll against each other, and sit with clasped hands by the hour. They\r\nfondle and kiss until beholders are fairly nauseated, and in a few\r\nweeks, perhaps, they do not speak as they pass each other, and their\r\ncaresses are lavished on others. Such friendships are not only silly,\r\nthey are even dangerous. They are a weakening of moral fiber, a waste\r\nof mawkish sentimentality. They may be even worse. Such friendship may\r\ndegenerate even into a species of self-abuse that is most deplorable.\r\n\r\nWhen girls are so sentimentally fond of each other that they are like\r\nsilly lovers when together, and weep over each other's absence in\r\nuncontrollable agony, the conditions are serious enough for the\r\nconsultation of a physician. It is an abnormal state of affairs, and\r\nif probed thoroughly might be found to be a sort of perversion, a sex\r\nmania, needing immediate and perhaps severe measures.\r\n\r\nI wish the friendships of girls were less sentimental, were more\r\nmanly. Two young men who are friends do not lop on each other, and\r\nkiss and gush. They trust each other, they talk freely together, they\r\nwould stand by each other in any trouble or emergency, but their\r\nexpressions of endearment are not more than the cordial handgrasp and\r\nthe unsentimental appellation, \"Dear old chap.\"\r\n\r\nI admire these friendships in young men. They seem to mean so much,\r\nand yet to exact so little. They believe in each other's love, but do\r\nnot demand to be told of it every minute.\r\n\r\nIt is the highest type of friendship that can believe in the friend\r\nunder all circumstances. I have a friend from whom I may not hear once\r\na year, yet I know just where she stands in her relation to me, and I\r\nwould have no fear of finding her cold or unresponsive should I at any\r\ntime call on her for a friendly service. I may never see her, or even\r\nhear from her again in life, and we may live long years yet on the\r\nearth, but I would as soon think of doubting the return of to-morrow's\r\nsun as to doubt her love. There is no need of words, of caresses, even\r\nof deeds. We are both busy women. Our daily cares absorb us, yet we\r\nknow that we are friends, and in the great hereafter we hope to find a\r\nplace where we may pause and look into each other's faces and enjoy an\r\ninterchange of thought. But now other interests than self-seeking\r\nclaim us. We work on, cheered by the thought that time cannot alienate\r\nus, for true love is eternal.\r\n\r\nThe charm of a true friendship is that it does not make demands. I had\r\na school friend who thought that because she was my friend I must tell\r\nher all my affairs. She was offended if I received a letter that I did\r\nnot read to her, or if I went out to spend the evening without first\r\ninforming her. Her friendship became a tax because it demanded so\r\nmuch. And, after all, was it true friendship? Was it not love of self,\r\nrather than of me? People sometimes imagine that, because they crave\r\nlove, they are affectionate and unselfish. Is it true? It is rather\r\nnatural to want to be loved, but it is selfish, and the feeling\r\nindulged in to any extent is weakening. To want to be loved means\r\nusually to want some one to be a protector, a giver of pleasure, a\r\nsupplier of wants. To desire to love is nobler, for to love is to\r\ngive. God so loved the world that he gave. Christ loved us and\r\ngave--gave Himself for us. To love truly, grandly, nobly, is to grow\r\nstrong through giving. Not giving that which we should not give, not\r\nunwisely giving of time that belongs to our own best good, not giving\r\nof strength that should be dedicated to some better purpose, not a\r\nyielding of principle, nor purity, nor honor, but the true giving of\r\nthat which enriches both giver and recipient, which ennobles, uplifts,\r\nencourages and strengthens, and leaves no sorrow in its wake. The\r\ntruest giving is sometimes a refusal to yield to demands that are\r\nunworthy. Love wisely, my daughter, and you will give wisely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs many girls are affected by spinal curvature, round shoulders, weak\r\nback or ankles, prolapsed stomach, bowels, or pelvic organs,\r\nconstipation and poor general circulation, it seems well to give a few\r\nexercises that shall be corrective of these defects, premising that\r\neach exercise should be begun gradually and easily, increasing\r\nfrequency and force, as strength is gained, say five times a day the\r\nfirst week, eight times a day the second week, and so on.\r\n\r\n_Never exercise in tight clothing or in a corset_, and do not\r\n_exercise to exhaustion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Overcome Slight Lateral Curvature._\r\n\r\n1. If it is the right shoulder that is depressed, place the hands on\r\nhips or behind neck, and bend slowly to the left.\r\n\r\nReverse this movement if the left is the lower shoulder.\r\n\r\n2. With arms raised above the head, bend the body slowly forward and\r\ntry to touch the floor without bending the knees, then rise slowly to\r\nan erect position.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Overcome Round Shoulders._\r\n\r\nDo not fold the arms in front.\r\n\r\nAny motion that brings hands together behind the back is good.\r\n\r\nDraw the elbows quickly backward.\r\n\r\nCarry a weight in each hand, holding the weight behind you and out\r\nfrom the body.\r\n\r\nHold the body in the correct attitude (see page 132), head balanced on\r\nspine, chest elevated, posterior part of body thrown out, weight on\r\nballs of feet, not on heels.\r\n\r\nExercises that strengthen the waist muscles will help to maintain the\r\nerect position, and so tend to overcome round shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Strengthen Weak Back._\r\n\r\n1. Hold a light weight in each hand. Place the weights on the floor in\r\nfront of you. Stand with feet eight inches apart, and take three slow,\r\ndeep breaths. Stoop over and take the weights in the hands and\r\ngradually straighten up till the hands hang easily at the sides. Bend\r\nslowly forward, and again place the weights on the floor. Repeat five\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n2. Clasp the hands back of the neck and bend slowly forward until the\r\nhead is on a level with the waist. Count ten, then straighten up to\r\nerect position. Repeat.\r\n\r\n3. Bend the body backward, forward and sidewise at the waist.\r\n\r\n4. Put your right arm over your head till it touches your left ear.\r\nHold the chin high. Breathe slowly and deeply while you walk around\r\nthe room. Repeat with other arm. Increase the length of your walk\r\ngradually.\r\n\r\n5. Playing tennis is good exercise for the sides of the waist.\r\n\r\n6. Carry a weight first on one shoulder, then on the other.\r\n\r\n7. Run on the toes.\r\n\r\n8. Hop on one foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Strengthen and Develop the Chest._\r\n\r\n1. Maintain an erect attitude.\r\n\r\n2. Raise and lower the arm, forward, upward, backward, without bending\r\nthe elbows.\r\n\r\n3. Lie on the floor, stretch the arms over the head till the hands\r\ntouch the floor. Take a deep breath and hold it; now bring the arms\r\nover the head as high as you can reach, and do not bend the elbows.\r\nRest and repeat three times.\r\n\r\n4. Hold chin as high as possible. Raise the arms at the side as high\r\nas you can. Breathe deeply and hold the air in the lungs. Now, without\r\nletting any air out and without bending the elbows, bring your hands\r\ndown steadily to your sides. Repeat. Keep chin well up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Strengthen Abdominal Muscles._\r\n\r\n1. Stand with chin high.\r\n\r\n2. Breathe slowly and deeply.\r\n\r\n3. Raise the right knee till the right foot is about twelve inches\r\nfrom the floor.\r\n\r\n4. Give a little spring with the left foot, raise it swiftly from the\r\nfloor, and at the same time put the right toe and sole (not heel) to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n5. Spring on right foot and put left down. Repeat five times.\r\n\r\n6. Fold arms behind. Hold chin up. Breathe slowly and very deeply. Do\r\nnot bend the knees. Hold your left foot far out in front of you while\r\nyou count five.\r\n\r\n7. Lower it and raise right foot in same way. Repeat four times. Keep\r\nthe shoulders well back and down while doing this exercise. Point the\r\ntoes down and out.\r\n\r\n8. Lie on your back. Keep feet down and rise to a sitting position.\r\nDrop slowly back, and repeat three times.\r\n\r\n9. Run, lifting your feet high, like a spirited horse.\r\n\r\n10. Stand with chin high, arms akimbo. Breathe slowly and deeply.\r\nAdvance left foot eight inches in front of right. Lean head slowly as\r\nfar back as possible. Hold it while you count five. Straighten, and\r\nrepeat five times.\r\n\r\n11. Place the hands on the wall in front of you as high as you can\r\nreach and about two feet apart, with the elbows straight. Have chin up\r\ntill you face the ceiling, and keep it so. Take a very deep breath and\r\nhold it. Now bend your elbows and let the body go slowly forward till\r\nthe chest touches the wall, keeping the body and legs stiff all the\r\ntime. Push back till straight again. Do not take heels off the floor,\r\nnor hands off the wall, nor eyes off the ceiling right overhead.\r\nRepeat five times.\r\n\r\n12. Lie on the floor, stretch the arms over the head till the hands\r\ntouch the floor. Clinch the fists. Take a deep breath and hold it. Now\r\nraise the arms slowly, keeping the fists clinched, and bring them down\r\nat the sides, raising the head from the floor at same time. Raise the\r\narms and stretch them on the floor over the head at same time, letting\r\nthe head sink back to the floor, and breathe out slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Facilitate the Return of Displaced Organs to Their Normal\r\nPosition._\r\n\r\n1. Lie on your back upon a smooth, hard surface. Draw the feet up as\r\nclose to the body as possible. Now lift the lower part of the body\r\nuntil it is wholly supported by the feet and shoulders. Hold it in\r\nthis position as long as possible without fatigue. Lower slowly to\r\noriginal position. Rest a few minutes. Repeat. Continue for twenty or\r\nthirty minutes, according to strength.\r\n\r\n2. Lie with face downward. Raise the hips as high as possible,\r\nsupporting the body on the toes and elbows.\r\n\r\n3. Slip from the bed head first and face downwards until the head\r\nrests on the floor and the legs and feet remain upon the bed. Let the\r\narms to the elbows rest on the floor. When weary of this attitude slip\r\nto the floor, turn on the back, and apply the bandage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nRECREATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walking._\r\n\r\nIt is well to bear constantly in mind that all exercise, even walking\r\non level ground, is objectionable in clothing that compresses the\r\nbody; and as exercise is the law of the development of muscle, the\r\nonly safe thing to do is so to dress that every muscle has free and\r\nunrestrained motion. Walking to be beneficial should be out of doors,\r\nwith some pleasant motive, and taken with some degree of energy. The\r\nlength of the walk should be proportional to the strength of the\r\ngirl--short at first, and increasing as strength increases. The erect\r\nattitude should be maintained, and the walking not prolonged to\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nWalking slowly home from school, laden with books and intent on\r\nconversation with others, will not fulfill the demands of walking for\r\nexercise. It makes no demand on breathing power, does not develop\r\ndepth of chest or strength of limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Running._\r\n\r\nThis is an admirable exercise if the dress be suitable. Long skirts\r\nare an impediment. Running on the toes develops the calf of the leg.\r\n\r\nThe swift motion causes deep breathing, which expands the chest. If\r\nviolent or long-continued, it may make too urgent a demand on the\r\nheart and lungs, and so be detrimental. The counsel of a physician is\r\nsafest for those whose heart and lungs are weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Riding._\r\n\r\nHorseback riding is a vigorous exercise, which would be especially\r\nbeneficial were it not for the cramped position women are forced by\r\ncustom to assume. It cannot be recommended to those who have a\r\ntendency to lateral curvature of the spine or weak back, or prolapsed\r\ninternal organs. Such girls should by proper care be put into a better\r\nphysical condition before attempting to ride. Harvey advises learning\r\nto ride on either side of the horse, so as to bring opposite sets of\r\nmuscles into play, and counteract the curvature which physicians who\r\nhave the opportunity to observe say is produced by riding. That being\r\ntrue, why not adopt the sensible fashion of riding on both sides of\r\nthe horse at once, as men do? I saw a young lady so mounted the other\r\nday, and the sight was far more agreeable than the twisted attitude\r\ncompelled by the side-saddle. Medical men also assert that riding\r\ntends to produce round shoulders, and as the greatest muscular strain\r\ncomes on the back, it is not helpful to weak backs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skating._\r\n\r\nSkating is a fine exercise. It quickens the circulation and the\r\nrespiration, aids digestion, exercises a great number of muscles, both\r\nof limbs and trunk of body, strengthens the ankles, and incidentally\r\nthe nerves. Evils are to be found in wrong habits of dressing, the\r\ntendency to overdo through the fascination of the sport, the danger of\r\ntaking cold by carelessly sitting down to rest when heated, or driving\r\nhome after being warmed up by the severe exertion. A girl of good\r\njudgment, properly clothed, ought to be benefited by this charming\r\nout-door sport.\r\n\r\nIt should be begun very gradually at the opening of the skating\r\nseason, and not undertaken if the internal organs are prolapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rowing._\r\n\r\nRowing is an exercise that develops the upper back and back of\r\nshoulders, and therefore needs to be counteracted by exercise that\r\ncalls into play the muscles of the front of the chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cycling._\r\n\r\nThe dangers of cycling arise principally from lack of judgment. The\r\ntemptation to overdo is very great, and injury is done in attempts to\r\nride longer, farther and faster than the strength will safely allow.\r\nThe whole dress should be so arranged as to give perfect freedom of\r\nmovement, the skirt short enough to clear the dangerous part of the\r\nmechanism, the saddle adjusted to the individual both in its make and\r\nheight, and the girl be taught to sit properly and to adjust her\r\nweight so that the pressure will not be undue upon the perineum.\r\nRectal and other local irritations are produced by the pressure of the\r\nwhole weight resting on the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe position should not be absolutely erect, but leaning _slightly_\r\nforward, so as to allow the weight to be distributed between the\r\nhandle-bars, the pedal, and the saddle. This slightly inclined\r\nattitude also maintains the proper and harmonious relation of the\r\ninternal organs, so that the bowels do not crowd down on the pelvic\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nIf the girl is taught to sit on the machine properly, to distribute\r\nher weight, to sit on the large gluteal muscles, and not on the\r\nperineum, to use judgment in the amount of exercise taken at a time,\r\nthere is no reason why a girl in a normal condition of health should\r\nnot be benefited.\r\n\r\nThere may be particular reasons why some girls should not undertake to\r\nride, and these can be determined by the physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tennis._\r\n\r\nThis is a game that demands great activity, consequently there is\r\nespecial need of entire freedom of movement. All constrictions of\r\nclothing are especially injurious.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by some that, being essentially a one-sided exercise,\r\nthere is a possibility, if unwisely indulged in, that it may produce\r\ninjurious results, especially to the spine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Swimming._\r\n\r\nSwimming is not only a valuable exercise, but it really conduces to\r\nthe safety of life in these days of constant boat travel, and there\r\nare no adequate reasons why girls should not learn. The younger they\r\nbegin, the more readily will they become expert. It is not wise to\r\nindulge in this exercise while menstruating, nor immediately after\r\neating.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skipping._\r\n\r\nThere is some prejudice against this form of exercise from the fact\r\nthat it can be overdone, and also from the popular idea that it is\r\ninjurious to girls to jump.\r\n\r\nIf they are properly dressed, and their muscles are gradually\r\ndeveloped, and they use good common sense as to amount, there are\r\npractically no dangers in skipping. It is admirably adapted to\r\nstrengthen a great variety of muscles, as those of the legs, back,\r\nabdomen, and neck. It strengthens the knees and the arches of the\r\nfeet, thereby tending to overcome flat foot. It strengthens weak\r\nbacks, increases circulation and respiration and promotes digestion,\r\nand, if practised out of doors, is one of the most perfect forms of\r\nexercise. Of course the judgment dictates that when the pelvic organs\r\nare heavy with the menstrual congestion it would not be advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dancing._\r\n\r\nDancing, in itself considered, is a pleasant and beneficial exercise.\r\nIt develops grace and muscular strength, increases circulation and\r\nrespiration, and is cheering because of rhythm. One wishes that it\r\ncould be unqualifiedly commended. But when we take into account the\r\nlate hours, the heated rooms, the promiscuous company, the late\r\nunwholesome suppers, the improper dress, the dangers of taking cold,\r\nthe immodest freedom of the round dance, and the not infrequent evils\r\nresulting therefrom, it would seem unwise to commend an exercise so\r\nsurrounded by objectionable concomitants. It is observed that young\r\nchurch members who become interested in the dance soon lose all their\r\ninterest in church work.\r\n\r\nIf dancing could be conducted in the daytime, out of doors, among\r\nwell-known home friends and companions, in proper dress, and with _no\r\nround dances_, there would be much to commend, and little to condemn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Card-playing._\r\n\r\nI can find little to say in favor of this form of amusement. It\r\ncontains no exercise for the body. It continues the cramped attitudes\r\nto which most people are condemned during the day.\r\n\r\nIt certainly contributes nothing to the higher forms of enjoyment. It\r\nstimulates emulations, which St. Paul enumerates among things to be\r\navoided; it is the accompaniment of gambling and low society; and,\r\nwhile we must admit that a pack of cards in itself is not evil, yet it\r\ncan be and often is made most detrimental to the best interests of\r\nmorality and righteousness.\r\n\r\nThe young woman who respects her own intellectual and moral powers\r\nwill see little charm in manipulating cards in a way to gain a\r\nmomentary success over another and perhaps arousing unkind feelings,\r\nit may be even passions, that may culminate in bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theatre-going._\r\n\r\nIt is natural that we should enjoy pictorial representation of human\r\nlife with living actors and audible words; and, understanding this,\r\nmany good people have had the hope that the stage might be purified\r\nand made a teacher of morals. Certainly valuable lessons of life might\r\nbe most strongly presented in this concrete form, and thus appeal with\r\nwonderful power to the young and inexperienced. But that it might be\r\nso used does not insure that it will be, and observation shows us that\r\nit is not.\r\n\r\nThe modern play concerns itself principally with a delineation of\r\nthose phases of life which we condemn when they become reality, and\r\nthe teaching power of the stage becomes a lesson in wrongdoing which\r\nto the young and inexperienced is potent in its suggestiveness.\r\n\r\nThe costumes of actresses are often immodest, and many of these women\r\nare immoral in character. It would not be just to condemn all actors\r\nwith the sweeping assertion of immorality, but all will admit that the\r\ntemptations are great, and that great moral force is needed to resist\r\nthe influences that lead towards wrong.\r\n\r\nThat many of our great actors will not permit their children to become\r\nactors, or, in some cases, even to enter the theatre as a witness of\r\nits performances, speaks strongly on the matter.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of this subject the girl may safely decide that\r\nshe will not be a permanent loser if she is not a frequenter of the\r\ntheatre. It is safer to keep the mind pure and untainted from all\r\npictures of sin, more especially if they are made attractive by the\r\nglamour of jewels and silken attire, of music, dancing, and lifelike\r\nportrayal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nLOVE; HEREDITY; ENGAGEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nLOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our study we have first learned of general and then of special\r\nphysiology, so, in continuing the same study in mental and moral\r\nfields, we first learn of the general and then of our special relation\r\nto others. We cultivate body, mind and spirit because it is our duty\r\nto develop ourselves for our own interests; but it is also our duty to\r\ncultivate all our powers because of our responsibility in regard to\r\nothers. This responsibility I will include in the one word, \"love.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is love? The idea of love occupies much of the thought of old and\r\nyoung, and in different persons it will have very different meanings.\r\nTo one it means merely pleasurable sensations aroused by either the\r\nthought of a person, or by the actual presence of that person. To\r\nanother it means an opportunity to sacrifice inclination and pleasure\r\nin order to promote the happiness or welfare of a certain person.\r\n\r\nMuch that passes in the world as love is principally love of self. The\r\nman loves the woman because she satisfies his sense of beauty; her\r\npresence causes thrills and ecstasies; she contributes to his\r\nhappiness and comfort. That is, he loves himself through her. The\r\nwoman loves the man because he protects her, he surrounds her with\r\nluxury, his presence brings thrills and ecstasies to her. She loves\r\nherself through him. Is not this but the essence of selfishness? In\r\nanother case the man loves the woman so tenderly that he cannot do\r\nenough to prove his devotion. If her welfare demands his absence, he\r\ngladly foregoes the pleasure of her society. If her comfort requires\r\nhis unremitting toil, he gives his days, and even his nights, to the\r\ntask of labor for her. His only anxiety is to know her wants and to\r\nsupply them. He effaces himself and his wishes to serve her. He would\r\ndie to secure her good. He gives, and asks nothing. Or, in the same\r\nway, the woman loves the man so that her whole thought is not what she\r\ncan obtain from him, but what she can give him. True love desires only\r\nto give. Self-love strives only to secure.\r\n\r\nEmerson says, \"All the world loves a lover,\" and conversely we may say\r\na true lover loves all the world. The affection kindled in the heart\r\nby one worthy individual goes out in a kindlier feeling for all the\r\nworld. A poet once said that the world was brighter and all humanity\r\ndearer because he loved truly one worthy woman. He was more gentle\r\nwith little children; the very beggar on the street corner seemed to\r\nbe a brother in distress. Because the woman he loved had given him her\r\nheart, he wanted to give something to every one he met. This is the\r\nspirit of true love, to go out in blessings towards the beloved\r\nobject, and so on towards every created thing.\r\n\r\nI was once asked if I believed in love at first sight. How can love\r\nspring up in a minute? There may be admiration of beauty, there may be\r\nappreciation of intellectual qualities, there may be a recognition of\r\nmagnetic personal attraction, but none of these is love. Love, to be\r\nworthy the name, must be a superstructure built upon a firm foundation\r\nof acquaintance with each other's true qualities. Love is not a\r\nballoon, in which two young people may go sailing among the clouds,\r\naway from all regions of every-day life. Those who try it with that\r\nidea find the cloud-world cold and uncomfortable, and not at all the\r\nrosy, gold-tinted region it looked at a distance.\r\n\r\nLove is rather like a building with foundations set into the\r\nearth--foundations solid, firmly laid and durable. How can people love\r\nwhen they do not know each other? Acquaintance first, then friendship,\r\ncomradeship; then, if the sentiment grows, love. But how are young\r\npeople to get really acquainted? They meet under unreal conditions.\r\nThey see each other in society, in Sunday dress and with Sunday\r\nmanners. They doubtless do not mean to deceive each other, but there\r\nis little to draw out the real self. There is nothing to disturb or\r\nirritate, nothing to prove the honesty, the neatness, the industry,\r\nthe persistence, the business ability; nothing to disclose the true\r\nideas in matters of serious import, of health, religion, duties of\r\nhusbands and wives, the government of the home; and too often the\r\nintimacy of marriage discloses many personal peculiarities of temper,\r\nhabits and manners that, if seen in time, would have prevented\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThe trouble does not originate with young people themselves, but with\r\nolder people; but as the young people of to-day will be the older\r\npeople of the future, it would be well for them to realize what the\r\ntrouble is. The fact is, that in the present conditions of society the\r\nassociation of young people is unnatural. From earliest childhood boys\r\nand girls are taught to think of each other only in sentimental ways.\r\nThe little boys and girls in school are playing at \"lovering,\" and\r\ntheir conversation is often more about beaus and sweethearts than\r\nabout the plays of childhood, which alone should occupy their\r\nthoughts. You remember that little miss of ten who asked you, when you\r\nwere sixteen, who was your beau. You recall her look of surprise when\r\nyou replied that you had none, and her exclamation, \"Have no beau!\r\nWhy, how do you get along without one?\" What made such a mere child\r\nimagine a beau to be an essential agent of a girl's life? Because she\r\nhad been taught by the jests and suggestions of her elders that every\r\nboy was a possible lover, and, young as she was, that thought was\r\nwoven into her very life. It is pitiable to see how early the mind of\r\nthe child is tainted by sentimentality, by the unwise suggestions of\r\nolder friends. I remember hearing of a child of six who was talking of\r\ngetting married. Some one said, \"You are too little to think of\r\ngetting married,\" and the child replied, \"Why, I have thought of it\r\nsince I was two years old.\" And doubtless she had, because it had been\r\ncontinually impressed on her mind by the conversation of parents and\r\nfriends, and the direction they had given her thought in regard to her\r\nrelation to everything masculine.\r\n\r\nParents are often very unwilling to teach their daughters the facts of\r\nsex, and yet quite willing to emphasize the consciousness of sex by\r\nintimating the possibility of flirtations, love affairs, etc. And this\r\nfalse, pernicious idea of the relation of men and women is too often\r\ncalled love. The central idea of romances is this passionate\r\nattraction of the sexes. The plot gathers in intensity around the\r\nlovers, and culminates in their marriage, after which life is presumed\r\nto move on without a jar, and silly girls and impulsive boys imagine\r\nthat the sweet pain that accompanies the touch of hands or the glance\r\nof the eyes is love, and is a sufficient guarantee for the forming of\r\na life partnership.\r\n\r\nLet us face this question fairly. What is love? Of what is it made?\r\nCan you judge with any certainty of its lasting qualities? How can you\r\nknow the true from the false?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we have but the one word, \"love,\" to designate many\r\nphases of kindly regard. The mother loves her child, the child loves\r\nthe mother, yet love differs much in these two instances. The one is\r\nprotecting, anxious, self-sacrificing, unstinted care, unqualified\r\ndevotion; the other is sweet dependence, unquestioning acceptance,\r\nasking all and giving little. The love of brother and sister differs\r\nfrom that of brother for brother, or sister for sister. The love of\r\nman for woman differs from all other emotions of love. It contains\r\nelements not found in other forms. It may have the same quality of\r\ngiving or accepting, of protecting or yielding, but with all this\r\nthere is an added quality that is not found in any other relation of\r\nlife, a quality that rises to the intensity of a passion, and which,\r\nif thwarted or distorted, may become murderous or lead to insanity.\r\n\r\nThis overwhelming, domineering sway of feeling inheres in the fact of\r\nsex. It is the expression of the whole nature, through the physical;\r\nit is the vital creative force endeavoring to reach a tangible result.\r\nHoly in its inception, it can be degraded to the vilest uses. Forming\r\nthe distinctive feature of love between the sexes, it is too often\r\nimagined to be the all, and a strong physical attraction without the\r\nbasic friendship, which can only come through acquaintance, is not\r\ninfrequently supposed to be worthy of the name of love, and found,\r\nalas! to be the most unsubstantial of chimeras.\r\n\r\nLove, to be worthy of the name, must rest, not on the fact of\r\nadmiration for beauty, not on the physical attraction manifested in\r\nsweet electric thrills. Love should include intellectual congeniality\r\nand spiritual sympathy, as well as physical attraction. Lacking any\r\none of these three ingredients, the interest of two people in each\r\nother should not be called love.\r\n\r\nIn order that it may be determined whether there is the true basis of\r\nlove, there should be opportunity for unsentimental acquaintance. If\r\nwe could free the minds of young people from the romantic idea, and\r\nallow them to associate as intelligent beings, and so form\r\nacquaintance on the basis of comradeship, we should make things safer\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nBut if the older people do not know how to secure this desirable state\r\nof affairs, the young people themselves might secure it if they\r\nunderstood its desirability. You, as a young woman, can have much\r\ninfluence in the right directions, supposing that you drop from your\r\nmind the idea of sentimental relations with young men and meet them\r\non the ground of a friendly comradeship.\r\n\r\nDon't indulge in _tête-à-têtes_, or in lackadaisical glances of the\r\neye. Don't permit personal familiarities, hand pressures, or caresses.\r\nDon't simper, and put on the airs which mean, though the girl may not\r\nunderstand it, an effort to arouse the admiration and the physical\r\nfeeling of love. Refuse to be flattered, to be played with, to be\r\ntreated as a female, but insist on being treated as a woman with\r\nintelligence, with a capacity to understand reasonable things.\r\nManifest an interest in the movements of the world, of politics,\r\nliterature, art, religion, athletics. Talk of the things that interest\r\nthe young man as a citizen of the world, and not merely of those\r\nthings which appeal to him as a male. Be frank, be lively, be witty,\r\nbe wise, but do not be sentimental.\r\n\r\nWhen a young man calls, don't let him get the idea that you have to be\r\nsecluded in a room apart from the rest of the family. You will be\r\nbetter able to judge of him if you see him with your brothers, if you\r\nnote his manner towards your mother, if you hear him converse with\r\nyour father, if you mark his conduct towards the younger children. He\r\nwill talk sense, if he can, when he meets your family, while in a\r\n_tête-à-tête_ conversation with yourself he may be able to hide his\r\nlack of wisdom under the glamour of sweet nothings and soft nonsense.\r\n\r\nThen be yourself when he comes. Let him see you in your home life, at\r\nyour domestic duties, sewing, helping mother, reading to father,\r\ncaring for the little ones. Be an honest, free-hearted, companionable\r\ngirl, and put sentimentality out of mind. You can have many such\r\nfriends, and by and by, out of these you will probably find one whom\r\nyou admire more and more as time goes on. You hear his sentiments\r\nalways expressed in favor of truth and probity. You come to know\r\nsomething of his business principles, you see his courtesy to old and\r\nyoung, you learn of his home, his family, his social position, and out\r\nof this intimate knowledge there springs the attachment, blended with\r\ndeep respect, which assures you that he is worthy of your heart and\r\nhand, and indeed of your whole life.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the comradeship has grown more intimate. You have not\r\nbeen sentimental. You have treated each other with respect, you have\r\nmaintained your self-respect, you have held a tight rein over your\r\nfancies and emotions, but now you are convinced that you may allow\r\nthem to have sway. You begin to acknowledge to yourself that you love.\r\n\r\nAnd he, too, begins to manifest a deeper interest in you. You see this\r\nwith a certain pride in the fact that he is not self-deceived He\r\nknows you, has seen you in your daily life, has sounded the depth of\r\nyour intellect, knows of your religious beliefs, and in all he has\r\nfound you coming up to his ideals. His eye meets yours with a new\r\ntenderness in its glance that touches you, because you know it is not\r\nan earthly fire of passion that glows therein. It is you, the real,\r\nimmortal you, that he seeks; not merely the pleasures of sense through\r\nyou; and feeling the response in your own heart, your glance kindles\r\nwith the same divine fire, and your true selves have spoken to each\r\nother. You have gradually grown into the knowledge of love. You have\r\nnot fallen in love. And yet there have been no words, and in maiden\r\nshyness you await his speech. Your womanly reserve has won his\r\nrespect, and he makes no attempts to win privileges of endearments\r\nbefore he confesses his love, but frankly and manfully pleads his suit\r\nand wins.\r\n\r\nOh, my dear child, this has been no matter for jesting; it has been\r\nserious, and we who have watched this dawning love have realized that\r\nthe great drama of life, so full of tragic possibilities, is being\r\nhere enacted. We do not laugh, nor jest, but with the tenderest\r\nprayers we welcome you into the possibilities of God's divinest gift\r\nof human love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY IN MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are beginning to feel a peculiar interest in one young man more\r\nthan in any other. You think of him in his absence; you welcome his\r\ncoming; his eyes seem to caress you; the clasp of his hand thrills\r\nyou; you begin to think that you have passed from the domain of\r\nfriendship into that of love.\r\n\r\nBefore you really make that admission, let us \"reason together.\" Let\r\nus take a fair look at matters, and see whether it is wiser to pass\r\nthe border line, or to remain only friends. Who is this young man? You\r\ntell me his name, but that means nothing. Who is he? What is he in\r\nhimself? What are his talents, capacities, habits, inherited\r\ntendencies? Who is his father, his mother? What is their worth? I do\r\nnot mean in money, but in themselves? What ancestral diseases or\r\ndefects may he transmit to his posterity, which will be your posterity\r\nif he becomes your husband? Are the family tendencies such that you\r\nwould be willing to see them repeated in your children?\r\n\r\nThere is no indelicacy in asking yourself these questions, nor in\r\nmaking the investigations which will enable you to answer them\r\nsatisfactorily. The woman who marries, marries not only _into_ her\r\nhusband's family, she also marries his family; she is to become one of\r\nit, to live with it in closer and closer companionship as her\r\nchildren, bearing the family temperament, disposition and tendencies,\r\ngather one by one around her hearth.\r\n\r\nIs the family one of the type that she will desire to associate with\r\nintimately all the days of her life? You may feel that it does not\r\nmatter if you do not love your husband's mother, or admire his\r\nsisters; no matter if you do not have respect for his father, you will\r\nlive so far away from them that it will not be oftener than once in\r\nseveral years that you will be obliged to meet them. It might even\r\nhappen that you would never see them, and yet it be a very serious\r\nmatter that they were not respectable or lovable people, for they\r\nconstitute one-half of the ancestry of your children. Their most\r\nundesirable characteristics may, perchance, be the endowment of your\r\nsons and daughters, and your heart ache, or even break, over the\r\nhabits, or, it may be, criminality, which may disgrace your home\r\nthrough the paternal inheritance that you chose for them. Viewed in\r\nthis light, marriage becomes a most serious matter. It is unfortunate\r\nthat girls generally have the idea that it is not modest to think of\r\nmarriage further than the ceremony. Of the responsibilities and duties\r\nthey are not only ignorant, but think it ladylike to remain\r\nuninformed until experience teaches them, and that teaching is often\r\naccompanied by heart-breaking sorrow. If you should make inquiry you\r\nwould discover that a large proportion of mothers have buried their\r\nfirstborn children, and should you ask them why, they would in all\r\nprobability say, almost without exception, that it was because they\r\ndid not know how to give them a dower of health, or how to care for\r\ntheir physical needs.\r\n\r\nAgain, investigation would show you that children go astray, become\r\nwild, dissipated, or even criminal, because parents have not known how\r\nto train them, how to keep their confidence, how wisely to guide them\r\nin ways of righteousness.\r\n\r\nWe all believe it very important that mothers should know how to\r\ndirect and govern their children, and yet we do not train the future\r\nmothers for this important office. We teach girls how to sew or cook,\r\nhow to embroider and play the piano. We do not expect them to know,\r\nwithout instruction, how to mingle the ingredients for a cake or\r\npudding, but we imagine that they will know by intuition how to secure\r\nthe best results in the mingling of heterogeneous compounds in the\r\nformation of the characteristics of a human being.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the mother's privilege, we think of the actual\r\nmother, whose privilege is to care for and guide her real children.\r\nBut the mother's privilege in fact begins in her own childhood, when\r\nby her habits of life and thought she is deciding her own character,\r\nand at the same time creating, in great degree, the talents and\r\ntendencies of her possible children. It is her privilege to secure a\r\nmeasure of physical vigor for her descendants by her care of her own\r\nhealth in her very girlhood. She can endow them with mental power by\r\nnot frittering away her own powers of mind in foolish reading or\r\ncareless methods of study. By her own self-respecting conduct she\r\nhelps to give them the reverence for self which will insure their\r\nacting wisely. All this is the mother's privilege; and still one more\r\ngreat privilege is hers, and that is to choose one-half the ancestry\r\nof her descendants. She cannot choose their ancestry that comes to\r\nthem through herself; that is a fixed fact. Her parents must of\r\nnecessity be her children's grandparents. Her family characteristics\r\nare also their inheritance. The only thing she can do in regard to\r\ntheir inheritance through her is to modify the objectionable traits,\r\nand to cultivate the good traits herself, so that family faults may in\r\nher be weakened and the probability of transmission lessened, and the\r\nfamily virtues be strengthened and their probable transmission\r\nintensified. But she has the power to decide what shall be the\r\npaternal ancestry of her household; and if she is duly impressed with\r\nthe responsibility of this power, she will not allow herself to fall\r\nin love and marry a man of whose family she knows nothing, or knows\r\nfacts that do not promise well for posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF HEREDITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI once heard of a man who on his death-bed made a singular will. He\r\nhad no houses or lands to bequeath his children, but he had observed\r\nthat they had inherited much from him, and so he made a formal bequest\r\nto them of that which they already possessed.\r\n\r\nHe wrote: \"I bequeath to my son John my big bony frame and the\r\nslouching gait I acquired by carelessness, also my inherited tendency\r\nto consumption. To my daughter Mary I bequeath my sallow complexion\r\nand torpid liver, which are the result of my gross living; also my\r\nmelancholy disposition and tendency to look on the dark side of life.\r\nTo my son Samuel I give my love for alcoholic liquors and my irritable\r\ndisposition; to my daughter Jane my coarseness of thought and my\r\nunwillingness to be restrained in my desires, and also my tendency to\r\ncommit suicide.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very strange will,\" said everybody, and yet it was a will that was\r\nprobated long before the testator's death. That it gave perfect\r\nsatisfaction I will not assert, but it was never contested and paid no\r\nfees to lawyers.\r\n\r\nJust such wills are being made daily by the lives and conduct of\r\nyoung people, though they are not put into writing. Some time in the\r\nfuture, however, they will be written into \"living epistles, known and\r\nread of all men.\"\r\n\r\nOther wills are being made daily that through sober, virtuous,\r\nyouthful lives will bequeath to posterity dowers of health, strength,\r\npurity and power.\r\n\r\nThis being true, it seems only a part of prudent foresight to study in\r\nyouth the law that governs the transmission of personal\r\ncharacteristics to the future \"denizens of life's great city.\" This\r\nlaw is known as Heredity, and its first written record is in the first\r\nchapter of Genesis, where it is written that \"Every plant and animal\r\nshall bring forth after its kind.\" We are so accustomed to seeing the\r\nresults of this law that we give it little or no thought. We see that\r\ngrass springs up each year on our lawns and meadows. We know that if\r\nwe put the seeds of a certain flower in the ground, that kind of\r\nflower will always spring up, never another kind. The farmer is not\r\nanxious, after he sows wheat, for fear that the crop will be rye or\r\nbarley. We expect that the young of cats will be kittens, of geese\r\nwill be goslings, of men will be human children, and we are never\r\ndisappointed. The law holds good under all circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe see, too, that there are certain race characteristics that\r\nmaintain. The Mongolian race has peculiar high cheek-bones, sallow\r\ncomplexions and eyes set in bias, and we recognize the Japanese or\r\nChinese at once, even though dressed in the garb of our country. So,\r\ntoo, we recognize the African or the Caucasian by certain marked\r\ncharacteristics. This transmission of racial traits we call race\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nThen each race has its own traits, physical or mental, which we\r\nrecognize as national, and so speak of them. We always mention thrift\r\nas an attribute of the Teutonic nations; the Irishman we characterize\r\nas witty and pugnacious; the Frenchman as polite; the American as\r\nprogressive.\r\n\r\nEach individual has not only his human inheritance, his race\r\ninheritance and his national characteristics, but he has also an\r\nendowment of family traits.\r\n\r\nBut we are not made up of odds and ends of ancestral belongings alone.\r\nWe have in ourselves something that is original, that makes us\r\ndifferent from each other, and from all others. I have sometimes\r\nthought that we are somewhat like patchwork quilts, the parti-colored\r\nblocks being set together by some solid-colored material; or, better\r\nstill, we are like \"hit and miss\" rag carpets, with a warp of our own\r\nindividuality, filled in with a woof made of qualities and capacities\r\nof all those who have preceded us. You know, in making \"hit and miss\"\r\nrag carpets we take little strips and bits of various materials and\r\nall colors, and sew them together without regard to order or\r\narrangement, and these long strips are woven back and forth in the\r\nwarp until the carpet is woven, showing no set pattern, but a mingling\r\nof tints and shades that is sometimes crude and unsightly, sometimes\r\nsoft and artistic.\r\n\r\nI used, in childhood, to find great delight in seeking among the\r\nblended colors in the carpet for scraps of clothing which I recognized\r\nas having belonged to father or mother, or perhaps even to\r\ngrandparents. Even now, in my maturer years, I am interested in\r\nfinding in myself the physical, mental or moral characteristics of\r\nthose same ancestors; and you, no doubt, can do the same, while some\r\nof your traits seem to be yours entirely, constituting individual\r\nvariations upon ancestral inheritances.\r\n\r\nNature has been doing for centuries, unheeded, what the photographer\r\nof to-day thinks is a modern discovery, that is, making composite\r\nphotographs of us all.\r\n\r\nThrough this law of inheritance have arisen the intellectual, the\r\nmoral or the criminal types of humanity, and the process is\r\ncontinuing; the types are becoming more and more marked, or modifying\r\ninfluences are being brought in to change the type.\r\n\r\nThese influences are also the result of law, even though we may not be\r\nable to trace them to their cause. Knowing this, however, we begin to\r\nsee that heredity is not fatality; that the power to modify the\r\nendowments of future generations is ours. To know how to employ it, we\r\nshould study the law as far as we have opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis subject is a large one, and no doubt you will some day want to\r\ngive it a thorough investigation. Just now, however, you will have to\r\naccept my statements. I will not make them technical, but strictly\r\npractical to you as a young woman desiring that knowledge which shall\r\nbest fit you for the responsibilities of future life.\r\n\r\nA superficial study is rather discouraging. We see with what certainty\r\nevil characteristics are transmitted, and we feel that the law is a\r\ncruel one; but if we have patience we shall find that, like all laws\r\nof God, its purpose is for the benefit of the race. Before we begin to\r\ntake comfort from the law let us first learn its warnings, one of\r\nwhich is that all weakening of the individual, either in bodily\r\nstrength, in intellectual power or moral fiber, tends to produce a\r\nlike weakness in posterity. This is why I say to you that the young\r\npeople of the present have in their hands the welfare of the future.\r\nTheir habits to-day are moulding the possibilities of the race. Young\r\nwomen may feel that their individual violation of the laws of health\r\nis of no importance, but when they realize that the girls of to-day\r\nare the mothers of the future, and that the physical strength or\r\nweakness of each individual girl affects the average health of the\r\nnation, not only now, but it may be through her posterity for\r\ncenturies, we can see that each girl's health is a matter of national\r\nand of racial importance.\r\n\r\nBut it is not alone in the physical organization that we can trace the\r\nlaw of heredity in the transmission of undesirable qualities. We find\r\nthat evil traits and tendencies of mind or morals are transmissible.\r\nGalton finds that a bad temper is quite sure to be passed on from one\r\ngeneration to the next, and any peculiarity of disposition in either\r\nparents is quite likely to become an inheritance of the child. This\r\nfact makes our little faults seem of vastly more importance than\r\notherwise. We can endure them in ourselves, but they strike us very\r\nunpleasantly when we are obliged to see them manifested in our\r\nchildren. As the poet says:\r\n\r\n    \"Little faults unheeded, which I now despise;\r\n    For my baby took them with her hair and eyes.\"\r\n\r\nIt may not strike us very unpleasantly when we speak disrespectfully\r\nto our parents, but when our own children show us lack of courtesy and\r\ncheerful obedience it cuts deeply, and all the more deeply if we see\r\nin their conduct but a repetition of our own.\r\n\r\nOf course, if these minor faults are transmissible, we will not be\r\nsurprised that graver moral defects are passed on. The grandson of a\r\nthief began to steal at three years of age, and at fourteen was an\r\nexpert pickpocket. The police records show the same family names\r\nrecurring year after year.\r\n\r\nThese cases are so grave as to attract attention, while we overlook\r\nthe fact that the smaller immoralities are as apt to be transmitted,\r\nand perhaps with increased power. I should be afraid that slight lack\r\nof strict integrity in the father might appear as actual crime in the\r\nson.\r\n\r\nI would not omit to mention also the law of Atavism, in this\r\ndiscussion of heredity. This is that expression of the law in the\r\nomission of one generation in the transmission of a quality. We\r\nsometimes see the peculiarities or defects of a man or woman not\r\nmanifested in their children, but reappearing in their grandchildren.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I was in a family where both parents and all the children\r\nhad dark hair but one, and she had long, bright auburn ringlets. I\r\nasked, \"Where did you get your hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"From my red-headed grandmother,\" she answered, with a laugh,\r\nindicating that the matter had been so often discussed in her hearing\r\nthat she understood it quite fully.\r\n\r\nTo cover the whole scope of the law of heredity would take more time\r\nthan we have to spare. You can follow out the line of thought, and\r\nmake practical application of the facts and principles here laid\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nHEREDITARY EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nCivilized life in its progress is accompanied by certain customs and\r\nhabits which are detrimental to the individual health, and therefore\r\nto national health. The dress of women is not merely an unimportant\r\nmatter, to be made the subject of sneers or jests. Fashions often\r\ncreate deformities, and are therefore worthy of most philosophic\r\nconsideration, especially when we know that the effects of these\r\ndeformities may be transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe tightly-compressed waist of the girl displaces her internal\r\norgans, weakens her digestion, and deprives her children of their\r\nrightful inheritance. They are born with lessened vitality, with\r\ndiminished nerve power, and are less likely to live, or, living, are\r\nmore liable not only to grow up physically weak, but also lacking in\r\nmental and moral stamina. This weakness may manifest itself in immoral\r\ntendencies, or in some form of inebriety. It is now recognized that\r\nalcoholism will produce nerve degeneration, but it is not so well\r\nunderstood that nerve degeneration may be a factor in producing\r\ninebriates from alcohol or other poisons.\r\n\r\nDr. Crothers says: \"Hysteria, convulsions, unreasonable anger,\r\nexcitement, depression, credulity, skepticism, most unusual\r\nemotionalism and faulty reasoning, are some of the signs of nerve\r\ndegeneration,\" and adds that this central failure of nerve and brain\r\npower is often accompanied by a resulting alcohol or drug inebriety.\r\nThat is, the weak and degenerate nerves crave a stimulant, and the\r\nweak will yield to the demand, and inebriety result. If this\r\ndegeneration of nerve comes from the low vitality given by the mother,\r\nbecause of her unhealthful habits of dress and life, is it not wise\r\nthat in her early womanhood she should know of this possibility, and\r\nguard against it through her care of herself?\r\n\r\nShe ought also to understand the effect of alcohol and other poisons\r\nin producing nerve degeneration in the individual, and its probability\r\nin his posterity.\r\n\r\nGeorge McMichaels says: \"The hereditary nature of the abnormal\r\ncondition of which inebriety is the outward sign is not understood,\r\neven by physicians, as it should be. It is still, I regret to say,\r\nlooked upon as a vice acquired by the individual, the outcome of\r\nvoluntary wrongdoing. In some few cases this may be true, but in the\r\nmajority of instances inquiry into the family history will reveal the\r\npresence of an inherited taint, such families usually showing a\r\nneurotic condition. No position in the social or intellectual world\r\nis, or ever has been, entirely free from the tendency towards\r\nalcoholism, and a study of the family history of the great men who\r\nhave fallen victims to alcohol will show that the cause has been\r\nidentical with the case among the most obscure of mankind, viz.: That\r\na degenerated nerve condition has been inherited which renders the\r\nsufferer specially susceptible to this and allied neuroses, such as\r\nepilepsy, idiocy and suicide. The inheritance of an unstable nervous\r\nsystem makes the individual easily affected by what I must call\r\n'alcoholic surroundings.' In other words, the provocation to drink\r\nwhich would have no influence upon an ordinary, stable nervous\r\norganization, is sufficient to turn the neurotic into a confirmed\r\ndrunkard.\"\r\n\r\nAs a young woman you hold great power over the race in yourself, and\r\nthrough your influence over others, especially over young men. Your\r\ninfluence, wisely used, may save more than one from a drunkard's fate,\r\nand to use it wisely you should be instructed as to the real character\r\nof alcohol and its effects on the system. I have not time to tell you\r\nin minutiæ of the effects of alcohol, but I must take time to speak of\r\nthe law of heredity in this respect.\r\n\r\nIdiocy and inebriety are on the increase among civilized peoples. This\r\nstartling fact should make us ask the reason.\r\n\r\nT.D. Crothers, M.D., who is making a life study of inebriety, states\r\nthat from 1870 to 1890 inebriety increased in proportion to the\r\npopulation over 100 per cent., and that a large proportion is the\r\nresult of inebriety in one or both parents. It is a sad fact that many\r\nwomen, even of good social standing, are fond of alcoholic beverages.\r\nI saw a very bright, pretty young woman not long since, at a\r\nreception, refuse to take ice-cream or cake, but drink four glasses of\r\npunch, with many jests as to her fondness for the same, apparently\r\nwithout any glimmering of the thought that she was drinking to excess,\r\nalthough her flushed face and loudness of manner were proof of this to\r\nthose who were witnesses. Many people have an idea that the finer\r\ndrinks, such as wine and its various disguises, do not intoxicate, but\r\nin this they are mistaken. All alcoholics are intoxicating in just the\r\ndegree that they contain alcohol. The exhilaration of wine is but the\r\nfirst step of intoxication, and that means always an accompanying lack\r\nof judgment, a lessening of the sense of propriety.\r\n\r\nOne young woman who, under ordinary circumstances, was most modest in\r\ndeportment, drank at her wedding in response to the toasts to her\r\nhealth, and grew very jovial, until at last she danced a jig on the\r\nplatform at the railway station amid the applause of her exhilarated\r\nfriends, who had accompanied the young husband and wife to the train,\r\nas they started on their wedding-journey. What a sorrowful and\r\nundignified beginning to the duties of marriage!\r\n\r\nThere is no absolute safety for either man or woman except in total\r\nabstinence. The _débauché_ knows the effect of wine, and uses that\r\nknowledge to lead astray the young girl who, if herself, would find no\r\ncharm in his blandishments, but who, after the wine supper, has no\r\nwill to resist his advances.\r\n\r\nA young husband exacted of his bride a promise that she would never\r\ntake a glass of wine except in his company, and when asked the reason,\r\nreplied that he knew that no woman's judgment was to be trusted after\r\ntaking one glass of wine.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of inebriety in women is found in the patent medicines\r\nadvertised as a panacea for all pain, which chemical analysis shows to\r\nbe largely alcoholic. Many temperance women would be horrified to know\r\nthat they are taking alcohol in varying quantity, from 6 to 47 per\r\ncent., in the bitters, tonics and restorative medicines they are\r\nusing, many of which are especially advertised as \"purely vegetable\r\nextracts, perfectly harmless, sustaining to the nervous system,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe result of inebriety of parents in inflicting injury upon offspring\r\nhas not been well understood in the past, but is becoming recognized.\r\nDr. McMichael says:\r\n\r\n\"In every form of insanity the disease is more dangerous in the mother\r\nthan in the father, as far as the next generation is concerned. This\r\nis a good and sufficient reason why the daughter of drunken parents,\r\nvery often attractive to some men by reason of their excitable,\r\nvivacious, neurotic manner, should be carefully avoided by young men\r\nin search of wives. The man who marries the daughter of an inebriate\r\nnot only endangers his own happiness, but runs the risk of entailing\r\nupon his children an inheritance of degradation and misery.\r\n\r\n\"No woman should marry a man who, even occasionally, drinks to excess.\r\nFurther, the disposition of the sons of drunken parents ought to be\r\ninvestigated before any girl becomes engaged to one of them. This is\r\none instance in which long engagements are not to be condemned, for,\r\nif the man has inherited the alcoholic craving, it may become known in\r\ntime, and his _fiancée_ may be saved from the most terrible fate that\r\nI can think of--becoming the wife of a drunkard.\r\n\r\n\"One word more before I leave this aspect of the subject. As the\r\nmajority of inebriates are sufferers from a disease which is partly\r\nthe result of hereditary predisposition, it is foolish for any woman\r\nto marry a drunkard in the belief that she can reform him. If women\r\nwould realize that alcoholism is a disease and not a vice, they would\r\nunderstand that, while the spirit which prompts their devotion and\r\nself-sacrifice is praiseworthy, yet the probability of its success is\r\nvery remote. No doubt there are women who have made this experiment\r\nand who have managed to 'reform,' as it is called, confirmed\r\ninebriates; but such cases are by no means numerous. While it might\r\nnot be right to attempt to interfere with any effort to benefit any\r\nrepresentative of suffering humanity, it must be remembered that the\r\nfate of the next generation is at stake, and that unborn children\r\ncertainly have rights, although we are very apt to disregard them.\r\nAdmitting, then, that anyone is at liberty to risk everything, even\r\nlife itself, to benefit another, nevertheless it cannot be said that\r\nanyone has a moral right to jeopardize the future of a family to\r\nsatisfy any instinct or feeling of affection, however noble it may be.\r\nIf what I have written is true, no woman is justified in marrying a\r\ndrunkard.\"\r\n\r\nThe unstable nervous organization bequeathed by intemperate parents is\r\nlike a sword of Damocles over the heads of their unfortunate children,\r\nand even moderate drinkers will not give vigorous bodies and strong\r\nwills to their descendants. One man boasted that he had used a bottle\r\nof wine daily for fifty years, and it had not injured him; but of his\r\ntwelve children, six died in infancy, one was imbecile, one was\r\ninsane, the rest were hysterical invalids.\r\n\r\nAnd alcohol is not the only substance that inebriates. Opium,\r\nmorphine, chloral, cocaine, and all drugs of a similar nature, are\r\ndangerous, and each not only inflicts its injury on the individual,\r\nbut transmits its results to posterity in that nerve degeneration\r\nwhich renders the sufferer an easy victim to all forms of\r\nintoxication, and intoxication is nothing more nor less than\r\npoisoning. Opium and morphine are often prescribed by physicians, and\r\nthe patient, experiencing the sudden relief from pain, and perhaps not\r\nknowing the danger of indulgence, resorts next time to the delightful\r\npain-quieter on his own responsibility, and almost before he knows it\r\nthe habit is formed, and the weak will that made the easy victim now\r\nmakes the unwilling slave, loathing his chains, yet unable to break\r\nthem; and these evil habits are, in their effects, transmitted.\r\n\r\nDr. Robertson says: \"The part that heredity plays in all functional\r\ndiseases or states of the nervous system is not to be misunderstood.\r\nIt is safe to assert that no idiopathic case of insanity, chorea,\r\nhysteria, megrim, dipsomania, or moral insanity, can occur except by\r\nreason of inherited predisposition.\"\r\n\r\nThe evils of morphinism are even greater than those of alcoholism, and\r\ntheir transmission no less sure. Especially is there loss of moral\r\npower. Dr. Robertson says: \"No matter how honorable, upright and\r\nconscientious a man's past life may have been, let him become\r\nthoroughly addicted to morphine, and I would not believe any statement\r\nhe might make, either with reference to the use of the drug or on any\r\nother subject that concerned his habit. This extends further, and\r\nclouds his moral perceptions in all relations of life.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Brush says: \"Cocaine is the only drug the effects of which are\r\nmore dangerous and more slavish than the inhalation of the fumes of\r\nopium.\"\r\n\r\nThe danger in the fast life of this age is that we try to find\r\nsomething that will enable us to do our excessive undertakings with\r\nless feeling of fatigue. We fail to see in this that we are exhausting\r\nour reserve force, instead of adding to our store of force.\r\n\r\nThe _Popular Science News_ says that kola, cocoa, chocolate, coffee,\r\ntea, and similar substances make nervous work seem lighter, because\r\nthey call out the reserve fund which should be most sacredly\r\npreserved, and the result is nervous bankruptcy. Understanding that\r\nnervous bankruptcy of the parent threatens the welfare of future\r\ngenerations through the law of heredity, we will surely hesitate to\r\nbring ourselves under the strain produced by the use of these\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous habit of the present would almost seem to be the\r\ntobacco habit, because it is considered quite respectable and is\r\ntherefore almost universal. Men who are prominent, not only as\r\nstatesmen and business men, but also as moral leaders, smoke with no\r\napparent recognition of the evils, and lads can often sanction their\r\nbeginning of the habit by the fact that a certain pastor or\r\nSunday-school superintendent is a smoker.\r\n\r\nBut science has not been idle in regard to the investigation of the\r\neffects of tobacco, and the discoveries made have been published, so\r\nthat we are not now ignorant of the tobacco heart, or tobacco throat,\r\nor tobacco nerves, nor of the transmission of nerve degeneracy to the\r\nchildren of smokers.\r\n\r\nGirls sometimes think it is a great joke to smoke cigarettes for fun,\r\nand some grow into the habit of smoking, but the injury is not\r\nlessened by the fact that the use of the cigarette was begun in jest,\r\nnor that the user is a woman.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the _Medical Times_ is quite inclined to assert that much of\r\nthe neurasthenia, including a general disturbance of the digestive\r\norgans, now so common in that portion of the female sex who have ample\r\nmeans and leisure to indulge in any luxury agreeable to their taste,\r\nor which, for the time being, may contribute to their enjoyment, is\r\ndue to narcotics.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War we are told that 13 per cent. of all men\r\nexamined were excluded as unfit for military service. We are now told\r\nthat 31 per cent. are found to be unfit. Nearly one-third of the young\r\nmen found physically incompetent to be soldiers! From what cause?\r\nCertainly tobacco must bear a large share of the blame.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Major Houston, of the Naval School at Annapolis, made\r\nthe statement that one-fifth of the boys who applied for admittance\r\nwere rejected on account of heart disease, and that 90 per cent. of\r\nthese had produced the heart difficulty by the use of tobacco.\r\n\r\nDr. Pidduch asserts that \"the hysteria, the hypochondriasis, the\r\nconsumption, the dwarfish deformities, the suffering lives and early\r\ndeaths of the children of inveterate smokers, bear ample testimony to\r\nthe feebleness of constitution which they have inherited.\"\r\n\r\nGirls sometimes have the idea that a little wildness in a young man is\r\nrather to be admired. On one occasion a young woman left a church\r\nwhere she had heard a lecture on the evils of using tobacco, saying,\r\nas she went out, \"I would not marry a young man if he did not smoke. I\r\nthink it looks manly, and I don't want a husband who is not a man\r\namong men.\"\r\n\r\nYears after, when her three babies died, one after the other, with\r\ninfantile paralysis, because their father was an inveterate smoker,\r\nthe habit did not seem to her altogether so admirable, and when she\r\nherself became a confirmed invalid, because compelled to breathe night\r\nand day a nicotine-poisoned atmosphere, she gave loud voice to her\r\ndenunciation of the very habit which in her ignorant girlhood she had\r\ncharacterized as manly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF IMMORALITY ON THE RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another influence at work in causing race degeneracy\r\nconcerning which the majority of girls are ignorant, and that is\r\nimmorality. The prevalent idea that young men must \"sow their wild\r\noats\" is accepted by many young women as true, and they think if the\r\nlover reforms before marriage and remains true to them thereafter,\r\nthat is all they can reasonably demand. They will not make such\r\nexcuses for themselves for lapses from virtue, but they imbibe the\r\nidea that men are not to be held to an absolute standard of purity,\r\nand so think it delicate to shut their eyes to the derelictions of\r\nyoung men. This chapter of human life is a sorrowful one to read, but\r\nto heed its warnings would save many a girl from sorrow, many a wife\r\nfrom heartache.\r\n\r\nThe law of God is not a double law, holding woman to the most rigid\r\ncode of a \"thou shalt not\" and allowing men the liberty of a \"thou\r\nmayest.\"\r\n\r\nThe penalty inflicted for the violation of moral law is one of the\r\nmost severe, both in its effects upon the individual transgressor and\r\nupon his descendants. The most dreadful scourge of physical disease,\r\nas well as moral degeneracy, follows an impure life. This disease,\r\nknown as syphilis, is practically incurable. It may temporarily\r\ndisappear, only to reappear in some other form later in life; and even\r\nafter all signs have become quiescent in the man, they may reappear in\r\nhis children in some form of transmission. Even one lapse from virtue\r\nis enough to taint the young man with this dreadful poison, which may\r\nbe in after years communicated to his innocent wife or transmitted to\r\nhis children.\r\n\r\nDr. Guernsey says: \"I do not overdraw the picture when I declare that\r\nmillions of human beings die annually from the effects of poison\r\ncontracted in this way, in some form of suffering or other; for, by\r\ninsinuating its effects into and poisoning the whole man, it\r\ncomplicates various disorders and renders them incurable. This\r\nhorrible infection sometimes becomes engrafted upon other acute\r\ndiseases, when lingering disorders follow, causing years of misery,\r\nand only terminating in death. Sometimes the poison attacks the\r\nthroat, causing most destructive alterations therein. Sometimes it\r\nseizes upon the nasal bones, resulting in their entire destruction and\r\nan awful disfigurement of the face. Sometimes it ultimates itself in\r\nthe ulceration and destruction of other osseous tissues in different\r\nportions of the body. Living examples of these facts are too\r\nfrequently witnessed in the streets of any large city. Young men\r\nmarrying with the slightest taint of this poison in the blood will\r\nsurely transmit the disease to their children. Thousands of abortions\r\ntranspire every year from this cause alone, the poison being so\r\ndestructive as to kill the child _in utero_, before it is matured for\r\nbirth; and even if the child be born alive, it is liable to break down\r\nwith most loathsome disorders of some kind and die during dentition;\r\nthe few that survive this period are short-lived, and are unhealthy so\r\nlong as they do live. The first unchaste connection of a man with a\r\nwoman may be attended with a contamination entailing upon him a life\r\nof suffering, and even death itself. Almost imperceptible in its\r\norigin, it corrupts the whole body, makes the very air offensive to\r\nsurrounding friends, and lays multitudes literally to rot in the\r\ngrave. It commences in one part of the body, and usually, in more or\r\nless degree, extends to the whole system, and is said by most eminent\r\nphysicians to be a morbid poison, having the power of extending itself\r\nto every part of the body into which it is infused, and to other\r\npersons with whom it in any way comes in contact, so that even its\r\nmoisture, communicated by linen or otherwise, may corrupt those who\r\nunfortunately touch it.\"\r\n\r\nIf girls were aware of all this they would not only be careful how\r\nthey marry immoral men, but they would shrink from personal contact\r\nwith them as from a viper. Not one, but many girls who have held\r\nsomewhat lax ideas concerning the propriety of allowing young men to\r\nbe familiar have reaped the result in a contamination merely through\r\nthe touch of the lips. To-day a young woman in good social standing is\r\na sufferer from this cause. She was acquainted with a young man of\r\nrespectable family, but immoral life. His gaiety had a fascination for\r\nher, and his reputed wildness only added to the charm. On one evening,\r\nas he escorted her home, and took leave of her on the doorstep, she\r\nallowed him to kiss her. It chanced that at the time she had a small\r\nsore on her lip. The poisonous touch of his lips conveyed the\r\ninfection through this slight abrasion, and she became tainted with\r\nthe syphilitic virus, and to-day bears the loathsome disfigurement in\r\nconsequence. I do not need to multiply such cases. You can be warned\r\nby one as well as by a hundred.[2]\r\n\r\nA young woman of pure life married a man whose reputation was bad, but\r\nwhose social position was high. To-day she is suffering from the\r\nhorrible disease which he communicated to her, and her children have\r\ndied or are betraying to the world in their very faces the story of\r\ntheir father's wrong deeds. Truly you cannot afford to be ignorant of\r\nfacts so grave as these.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] For an extended presentation of the character and diseases which\r\naccompany vice, the reader is referred to the chapters which treat of\r\nthis subject in \"What a Young Man Ought to Know.\" Every young woman\r\nshould be intelligent upon these important subjects. There is nothing\r\nin this book to young men which a young woman approaching maturity may\r\nnot know, both with propriety and benefit, so that she may most\r\nsuccessfully protect herself from possible companionship with\r\nwell-dressed and polite but impure young men by discreetly placing the\r\nbook in the hands of her father and brothers, that they may become\r\nintelligent concerning the dangers against which they can most\r\nsuccessfully protect her. It might not be improper for her, after due\r\nacquaintance, to see that the book is placed in the hands of the one\r\nwho seeks to become her husband and the father of her children, that\r\nshe may at the proper time, and before it is too late, learn whether he\r\nhas always lived by the standards of social purity which are there set\r\nup, and whether he is able to bring to the union the same unsullied\r\nlife and character which he expects and requires of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE GOSPEL OF HEREDITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have often heard people say that God was unjust in making this law\r\nof heredity and compelling innocent children to bear the sins of the\r\nguilty parents, and at first thought it might so seem; but God is a\r\nGod of justice and also of mercy, and our study of His laws in their\r\nultimate outcome leads us to know that they are invariably made for\r\nour welfare. Let us see, then, if we cannot find something encouraging\r\neven in this law of heredity. Are the majority of people born straight\r\nor deformed, sick or well, honest or dishonest? You may ask, Are all\r\nof these conditions a matter of heredity? Certainly. The fact that we\r\nare human beings instead of animals, that we have our due proportion\r\nof organs and faculties, that we are not monstrosities or imbeciles,\r\nare all hereditary conditions. We see, then, that the law of heredity\r\ninsures to us our full complement of organs and capabilities, as well\r\nas the more pronounced characteristics which we the more readily\r\nrecognize as inheritances. The fact is that inheritance of good is so\r\nuniversal that we fail to think of it.\r\n\r\nWhen the baby is \"well-favored\" and straight-limbed, no credit is\r\ngiven to heredity; but if he is in some way out of the ordinary, we\r\nblame the law that has fixed on him some result of parental conduct.\r\n\r\nIf he possesses a good mentality, it scarcely occurs to us that this\r\nis just as surely heredity as is the transmission of the mental\r\nweakness of some ancestor.\r\n\r\nBy the Gospel of Heredity I mean this brighter side, this\r\n\"Good-tidings\" of the law. In the first written Biblical record of the\r\nlaw, where the statement is made that the sins of the fathers are\r\nvisited upon the children to the third and fourth generation, we have\r\nalso the statement of the \"Good-tidings\" that the Lord sheweth mercy\r\nto thousands of them that love him and keep his commandments; and that\r\nmeans not thousands of individuals, but thousands of generations.\r\nJustice is meted to the third and fourth, but mercy to thousands of\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAll through the Scriptures we find this brighter phase of the law\r\nenunciated. Perhaps you would like to study both the law and the\r\nGospel from the Bible. I will give you some texts and you can find\r\nthem for yourself. It would be interesting also for you to read the\r\nlives of men and women of renown, and observe the transmission of\r\ntalents and capabilities.\r\n\r\nEncouraging as this view of the subject may be, it is by no means the\r\nbrightest side of the subject of heredity, for if we have inherited\r\nno special talents, and if we are handicapped by the transmitted\r\nresults of the sins of our ancestors, we may say \"There is no hope for\r\nus, nor for our children.\" To us then will come, as special\r\n\"Good-tidings of great joy,\" the news that heredity is not fatality.\r\nWe are not obliged to sit and quietly bear the fetters our ancestors\r\nhave forged for us. We can break the chains, we can free ourselves. It\r\nmay be difficult, but it can be done, and a great incentive to the\r\neffort is found in the fact that by success we not only improve\r\nourselves, but we can pass on a better inheritance to our posterity.\r\n\r\nWe may cultivate our health by obedience to its laws so as to overcome\r\ninherited weaknesses to a very great extent. We are not absolutely\r\nobliged to die with consumption because one of our parents did. By\r\nsimple living, and especially by deep breathing of pure air, we may so\r\nstrengthen ourselves that we will have the power to resist the\r\nencroachments of the germ of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nWe may be born with weak digestive power, but by plain, wholesome\r\nfare, by freedom from worry, by a careful attention to all healthful\r\nhabits, we may grow strong and free from dyspeptic symptoms.\r\n\r\nWe can by cultivation of our minds and morals not only increase our\r\nown powers, but add to the powers of our posterity.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the effects of mental education are transmissible; not the\r\neducation itself, but an increased capacity, a new tendency. Every\r\nmental activity is accompanied by an actual modifying influence on\r\nbrain structure, so that we are really building our brains by our\r\nthoughts, and this increase of our own brains is transmissible to\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nI know that some of our philosophers assert strongly that acquired\r\ncharacteristics are not transmitted, and their theories seem quite\r\nplausible; but I would rather accept facts than theories any time, and\r\nProfessor Elmer Gates has demonstrated that this theory does not\r\naccord with the facts. He has trained dogs until they could recognize\r\nseven or eight shades of green or red. The brains of these dogs, so\r\ntrained, show under the microscope a great increase of brain-cells in\r\nthe visual area, proving that the education has created actual brain\r\nmaterial. The progeny of these dogs, to several generations, shows at\r\nbirth a much larger number of brain-cells in the visual area than is\r\nthe case where the ancestry has not been so strained.\r\n\r\nWhere the dogs have been brought up in absolute darkness there is a\r\ngreat lack of cells in the visual area, both in these dogs and in\r\ntheir progeny.\r\n\r\nThis is the brief statement of a most hopeful and encouraging fact.\r\n\r\nWe look to the dark side of the law of heredity for our warning. It\r\nmakes us solemnly thoughtful in view of our power over the race in the\r\ntransmitted result from our own wrongdoing; and then, when we feel\r\noverwhelmed and discouraged, we turn towards the Gospel of Heredity\r\nand take hope from the fact that good is transmissible; and, more than\r\nthat, we have it in our power so to modify our own characters,\r\ntendencies and habits that we can, in all probability, give our\r\nchildren a better dower than we received, and the earlier in life we\r\nbegin this making over of ourselves the better.\r\n\r\nI have heard people excuse themselves for all manner of faults on the\r\nplea that they were inheritances, and therefore could not be overcome.\r\nThat is to declare that we are slaves, with no chance to acquire\r\nfreedom, and I am not willing to admit that.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas in Adam all die, in Christ may all be made alive.\" That is,\r\nthat while under the Law of Heredity we are fettered, under the Gospel\r\nof Heredity our chains may be broken and we become free.\r\n\r\nThere is much of encouragement in the poem of Ella Wheeler Wilcox on\r\nheredity:\r\n\r\n    \"There is no trait you cannot overcome.\r\n    Say not thy evil instinct is inherited,\r\n    Or that some trait inborn makes thy whole life forlorn,\r\n    And calls for punishment that is not merited.\r\n\r\n    \"Back of thy parents and grandparents lies\r\n    The great Eternal Will, that, too, is thine\r\n    Inheritance--strong, beautiful, divine;\r\n    Sure lever of success for one who tries.\r\n\r\n    \"Pry up thy fault with this great lever--will;\r\n    However deeply bedded in propensity;\r\n    However firmly set, I tell thee firmer yet\r\n    Is that great power that comes from truth's immensity.\r\n\r\n    \"There is no noble height thou canst not climb;\r\n    All triumphs may be thine in time's futurity,\r\n    If, whatsoe'er thy fault, thou dost not faint or halt,\r\n    But lean upon the staff of God's security.\r\n\r\n    \"Earth has no claim the soul cannot contest;\r\n    Know thyself part of the supernal source,\r\n    And naught can stand before thy spirit's force;\r\n    The soul's divine inheritance is best.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLE TEXTS BEARING ON THE SUBJECT OF HEREDITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Heredity._\r\n\r\n_Law._--Gen. 1:12-24; Ex. 20:6; Num. 14:18.\r\n\r\n_Sins visited._--Job 21:17-19; Ps. 37:28; Jer. 32:18.\r\n\r\n_Blessings._--Gen. 22:17, 18; Deut. 4:40; 5:29; 30:19; Ps. 21:13;\r\n37:18, 22, 26, 29; 103:17, 18; 112:1, 2; 128:3; Prov. 10:25; 11:19;\r\n13:22; 17:6; 20:7; Isa. 48:18, 19; Jer. 32:18.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Divine Heredity._\r\n\r\nIsa. 43:16; Jer. 3:19; Mal. 2:10; Matt. 5:9, 45, 48; 6:4, 6, 9, 14,\r\n15, 18, 26; John 20:17; Rom. 8:16, 17; Gal. 4:7; Eph. 4:6; 2 Peter\r\n1:4; 1 John 3:2; 5:1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nREQUISITES OF A HUSBAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving spent so much time in the study of principles and laws, we will\r\nnow return to the discussion of this concrete case. What can you\r\ndecide in regard to this individual young man to whom you think you\r\nhave given your heart? What is he in his inheritance? What is he in\r\nhimself? I do not ask that he shall have inherited wealth, for that\r\noften proves a young man's ruin, but does he come of an honest,\r\nindustrious family? Have you just reason to suppose that he will make\r\na fair success of life? Is his father shiftless, lazy, improvident? If\r\nso, it will be harder for him to be provident, business-like. Has he\r\ntrue ideas of the dignity of life and his own responsibility? Is he\r\nlooking for an \"easy job,\" or does he purpose to give a fair\r\nequivalent for all that he receives? Would he rather toil at honest\r\nmanual labor than be supported by a rich father-in-law?\r\n\r\nWhat are his ideas as to his responsibility in the founding of a home?\r\nHow will he look upon his wife? As an equal, a companion, or as a\r\nplaything, a petted child, or a sort of upper servant? What value does\r\nhe put upon the wife's labor in the conducting of the household? Will\r\nhe consider that the money he hands over to her is a gift from him, or\r\nonly a fair recognition of the value of her work, a rendering to her\r\nof her share in the family purse?\r\n\r\nWhat is his estimate of woman? Is she an individual with rights, with\r\nintellect and heart, with a judgment to be consulted, opinions worthy\r\nof recognition, or only an appendage to man, created for his comfort\r\nand to be held in her \"sphere\" by his will?\r\n\r\nWhat are his defects of temper, or his weaknesses of body? Of course,\r\nto you now he seems perfection, and yet he is a human being, fallible\r\nand imperfect. If his faults are similar to yours, you double the\r\npossibility of their inheritance by your children. If you both have a\r\ntendency to lung trouble, the probabilities are that your children\r\nwill have consumption. If you both are of rheumatic proclivities, you\r\nmay expect a manifestation of the same early in the life of your\r\nchildren. If you both are \"nervous\" or irritable in temper, both\r\njealously inclined, or are morbid and melancholy, you need not be\r\nsurprised at an intensifying of these qualities in your little ones.\r\n\r\nIf there are more serious family traits, such as insanity, epilepsy,\r\nalcoholism and the like, it might even be your duty never to run the\r\nrisk of their transmission.\r\n\r\nI once spoke on heredity when in the audience sat a young man by the\r\nside of his _fiancée_, who, I was afterwards told, had been in an\r\ninsane asylum three times, and yet he purposed marrying her.\r\n\r\nI know a clergyman who has wisely dedicated himself to a celibate life\r\nbecause there is marked insanity in his family.\r\n\r\nYou chafe a little under this reiteration of the duty you owe to\r\nchildren yet unborn, and who may possibly never exist, and perhaps you\r\nsay, as I have heard girls say, \"Oh, I don't mean to have any\r\nchildren;\" and perhaps you add, \"I don't see why people may not marry\r\nand be happy just by themselves without having children.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that you should not understand all that is involved\r\nin such a statement. It is true that some married people do not have\r\nchildren, and are comparatively happy, and yet perhaps if we could\r\nread their hearts we should find that the one great longing of their\r\nlives is for the blessing of a child.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to desire to know the joys of parenthood. In the home,\r\nthrough the cares and love, the anxiety, self-sacrifice, tenderness\r\nand patience which accompany parenthood, the education of the\r\nindividual is made most complete and perfect.\r\n\r\nThe girl who marries without a willingness to accept these\r\nresponsibilities is willing to sacrifice that which, rightly borne,\r\nwill bring her the highest development. If she purposes deliberately\r\nto avoid motherhood she puts herself in a position of moral peril, for\r\nsuch immunity is not often secured except at the risk of criminality.\r\nI say not often, although I believe that if husband and wife are\r\nactuated by the worthy motive of not inflicting on posterity some\r\ndower of woe, they are justified in a marriage that does not\r\ncontemplate parenthood, if they are of lofty purpose enough to live\r\nsolely in mental and spiritual companionship. But all attempts to\r\nsecure the pleasure of a physical relation and escape its legitimate\r\nresults are a menace to the health and a degradation to the moral\r\nnature. This subject, and the questions arising therefrom, will be\r\ndiscussed more fully in the next book of this series, \"What a Young\r\nWife Ought to Know.\"\r\n\r\nBut how is a girl to know all these things concerning her lover's\r\nideas, thoughts, principles, and purposes? Many of these you think\r\ncannot be known until after marriage, and then it is too late. That is\r\ntrue; therefore be wise and learn all you can of each other's habits,\r\npeculiarities, opinions, and predilections now, before it is too late.\r\nTalk over business matters. Find out what your lover's ideas are as to\r\nthe wife's right to a pecuniary recognition of the value of her labor\r\nin making the home. Does he think that she earns nothing, and that\r\nwhat he gives her of his money is a donation for which she gives no\r\nreturn? I know a young woman who had been self-supporting before her\r\nmarriage who felt timid about asking her husband for money. So she\r\nwore her wedding garments until they were shabby, went without money\r\nwhen her own funds were exhausted, and kept silent for five years, and\r\nher husband--a young clergyman--never thought to ask her if she needed\r\nanything, never observed her growing shabbiness. When at last she\r\nsummoned courage to tell him her needs, he was overwhelmed with regret\r\nfor his own lack of thought and observation, and yet he could not\r\nunderstand why she should hesitate to ask for money. \"Why, it is all\r\nyours, dear,\" he said. \"You were only asking for what already belongs\r\nto you.\" And many young husbands are just as obtuse, therefore they\r\nshould receive in advance the instruction that is needed to prevent a\r\npossibility of such neglect. Have it understood that if you are worthy\r\nto be trusted as a bearer of the name and a sharer of the fortunes of\r\na man, you are worthy to share also the burden of the knowledge of his\r\nbusiness experiences, and to bear the responsibility of economically\r\nguarding his interests in the expenditure of money which, by your love\r\nand care and labor, you have helped him to earn.\r\n\r\nI think a young woman should know something of the personal habits of\r\nher future husband. Does he like fresh air, or does he want the\r\nwindows hermetically sealed at night. Is he a believer in the\r\ngodliness of cleanliness? I have just read of two people who married\r\nafter a six week's acquaintance, knowing nothing of each other's\r\nantecedents, personal habits, caprices or principles. The man proved\r\nto be a regular hypochondriac, taking medicine constantly, at one time\r\nwith five doctors prescribing for him. He counted his pulse at every\r\nodd moment, and looked at his tongue instead of at the eyes of his\r\nwife, as he had done when a lover. He had a dread of pure air, and was\r\nas averse to bathing as a cat. The woman had lived in the open air,\r\ntaken a daily morning bath, and was disgusted with those who did not\r\ndo likewise. The writer says, \"She stormed, took her baths, and opened\r\nthe windows; he cried, took no baths, shut the windows, and called the\r\ndoctors.\" There is no need to depict the unhappiness of the home, and\r\nyet no doubt the girl would have been shocked had anyone suggested\r\nthat she inquire into these facts concerning her lover. But if she had\r\nbeen less romantic and more practical, if she had remembered that the\r\nmarriage contract would bind her for life to one who would be more\r\nclosely connected with her than anyone else could be, and this union\r\nfor life, by day and by night, constant, continuous, and not to be\r\nannulled by any such small matters as bad breath or unpleasant\r\npersonal habits, perhaps she would have considered it no small matter\r\nto discover the possible causes of disgust before they became fixtures\r\nin her life.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps, also, she would have given her own personal habits more\r\nconsideration. True love will endure much, but it sometimes dies in\r\nthe presence of untidiness, of carelessness as to dress or room, or\r\nlack of sweetness of person or of breath. If you demand much of a\r\nhusband, he has a right to demand just as much from you. If there are\r\nhabits concerning which you would rather he as a lover should be\r\nignorant, believe me that it is even more important that as a husband\r\nhe should not know them. Therefore employ your available time before\r\nmarriage to rid yourself of them. If a lover would be disenchanted to\r\nsee the room from which his blooming, beauteous adored one had\r\ndeparted, bearing the marks of carelessness and disorder, with soiled\r\nclothing, unmade bed, shoes, hose and dresses all in tumbled heaps on\r\nchairs and floor, remember that the marriage ceremony does not make\r\nsuch a room more attractive to the husband, who must not only see but\r\nshare its discomforts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the knowledge of each other's personal peculiarities\r\nthere should be an understanding of each other's ideas as to the\r\nduties and responsibilities of their proposed relation to each other.\r\nI lately received a letter from a young woman who asks, \"How freely do\r\nyou think two engaged young people may talk concerning their future\r\nlife? Would it not be indelicate for them to discuss their future\r\nrelations, the possibility and responsibilities of parenthood, etc.?\"\r\n\r\nI answer, that depends on the young people. If they have false ideas,\r\nif they have little or no scientific knowledge, if their thoughts are\r\nfilled with wrong mental pictures, they will not know how to talk\r\nwisely and beneficially. But these two young people are intelligent,\r\nare scientifically educated, are Christians. Their hearts are pure,\r\ntheir standards high, their motives praiseworthy. It would seem that\r\nthey might talk as freely as their inclination would prompt. In fact\r\nthere seems to me more indelicacy and more danger from long evenings\r\nspent in murmuring ardent protestations of love and indulging in\r\nembraces and endearments than in a frank, serious conversation on the\r\nrealities and responsibilities of marriage, an exchange of earnest\r\nthoughts, voiced in chaste, well-chosen language--a conversation which\r\nby its very solemnity is lifted out of the realm of sense-pleasure\r\ninto the dignified domain of science and morality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nENGAGEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere now sparkles on your finger a ring that symbolizes the promise\r\nyou have given to become a wife. You are engaged, and there now arises\r\nin your mind the query as to the conduct of yourselves during this\r\nperiod of engagement: How much of privilege shall you grant your\r\nlover? As you are promised to each other for life, are you not\r\nwarranted in assuming towards each other greater personal familiarity?\r\nMay you not with perfect modesty allow endearments and caresses that\r\nhitherto have not been permissible?\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that you are not one of those unwise young women\r\nwho permit themselves to become engaged for fun; who consider an\r\nengagement as of so little seriousness that it may be made and broken\r\nwithout regret. I have known girls who even enter into engagements\r\njust in order to feel justified in greater freedom of conduct without\r\ncompunction of conscience. If such engagements do not violate the code\r\nof conventionalities they certainly infringe upon the moral code.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that girls should fail to see all the dangers of\r\nsuch conduct--that they should not comprehend that thus they become\r\nsources of temptation to their lovers, and may even imperil their own\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nBut your engagement is an honest one, your love is true, based upon\r\nthorough acquaintance; you have mutual respect and entire confidence\r\nin each other. May you not now throw aside much of the restrictions\r\nthat have surrounded your association and manifest your affection in\r\nreciprocal demonstrations?\r\n\r\nWe often read the advice to young people not to enter upon long\r\nengagements, and the reason given is that it exacts too much in the\r\nway of self-control, is too great a nervous strain, is too full of\r\nperil. I would like to quote just here a few words by Dr. C.W. Eaton:\r\n\r\n\"Away with the sexual argument against engagements, and let us all set\r\nabout that cultivation of will and purpose which can make the weakest\r\na tower of strength and the arbiter of his own destiny; and let us say\r\nto our appetites, Thus far shalt thou come and no farther, neither\r\nshalt thou presume to deny to thy master the best earthly\r\ncompanionship which may come into his life. It may be a far harder\r\ntask than the ardent and poetical lover allows himself at first to\r\nthink, but the hardest battles are best worth the fighting; and what\r\nmanner of men should we become if we systematically evaded life's\r\nconflicts, instead of meeting them squarely and fighting them through\r\nmanfully? Dr. Bourgeois says: 'The ancient custom of betrothals is the\r\nsafeguard for the purity of morals and the happy association of man\r\nand wife. This institution was known to the Greeks, the Hebrews, the\r\nRomans, and during the Middle Ages. In Germany it has still preserved\r\nits poetical and moral character. The young people are sometimes\r\naffianced many years before their marriage. We see the young man, thus\r\nbetrothed, with heart full of his chaste love, absent himself for a\r\ntime in order to finish his education, to perform his studies of\r\nscience or art, his apprenticeship to a trade, and to prepare himself\r\nfor manly life. He returns to his betrothed with a soul which has\r\nremained pure, with a reason enlarged and fortified. Then both are\r\nripe for the austere duties of marriage.\r\n\r\n\"'Chaste love, consecrated by betrothals, can be cultivated in the\r\nmidst of work. It lightens toil, it banishes _ennui_, it illumines the\r\nhorizon of life with delightful prospects; it excites in the young man\r\nthe manly courage and the high intelligence to create for himself a\r\nposition in the world; in woman, the noble ambition to perfect herself\r\nto become a worthy companion and good adviser.\r\n\r\n\"'During the stormy period of youth it is the only means of preserving\r\nthe virgin purity of the heart and of the body. Does anyone believe\r\nthat young men who in good season have in their hearts a love strong\r\nand worthy of them would profane themselves, as they so often\r\notherwise do, in vile affections, in those relations of a day, giving\r\nthemselves a holocaust to beauty without soul, or even to\r\nlicentiousness without beauty?'\"\r\n\r\nEmerson says: \"If, however, from too much conversing with material\r\nobjects the soul was gross, and misplaced its satisfaction in the\r\nbody, it reaped nothing but sorrow, body being unable to fulfill the\r\npromise which beauty holds out; but if, accepting the hint of these\r\nvisions and suggestions which beauty makes to his mind, the soul\r\npasses through the body and fails to admire strokes of character, and\r\nthe lovers contemplate one another in their discourses and their\r\nactions, then they pass to the true palace of beauty, more and more\r\ninflame their love of it, and by this love extinguishing the base\r\naffection, as the sun puts out fire by shining on the hearth, they\r\nbecome pure and hallowed. By conversation with that which is in itself\r\nexcellent, magnanimous, lowly and just, the lover comes to a warmer\r\nlove of these nobilities, and a quicker apprehension of them. Then he\r\npasses from loving them in one to loving them in all, and so is the\r\none beautiful soul only the door through which he enters to the\r\nsociety of all true and pure souls. In the particular society of his\r\nmate he attains a clearer sight of any spot, any taint which her\r\nbeauty has contracted from this world, and is able to point it out,\r\nand this with mutual joy that they are now able, without offense, to\r\nindicate blemishes and hindrances in each other, and give to each all\r\nhelp and comfort in curing the same. And beholding in many souls the\r\ntraits of the divine beauty, and separating in each soul that which is\r\ndivine from the taint which it has contracted in the world, the lover\r\nascends to the highest beauty, to the love and knowledge of the\r\nDivinity, by steps on this ladder of created souls.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this all means that when the thought of the sex-relation\r\nconstitutes in the mind of either the idea of marriage, then the\r\nwedding ceremony will be supposed to remove all restrictions, and the\r\nonly limit of gratification will be the limit of desire. Under these\r\ncircumstances the close familiarity of a long engagement would be a\r\nmental and physical tax, because the self-control exercised is felt to\r\nbe only temporary, and will be no longer needed when the wedding\r\nceremony has been said.\r\n\r\nBut if the idea of marriage is nobler, if the sex-relation is\r\nconsecrated to its highest purpose of reproduction, if marriage is\r\nfelt to be only an added opportunity for self-control, which will be\r\nmore difficult then because there will be no restraint except that\r\nwhich is self-imposed, then the engagement will be felt to be a time\r\nof gradual preparation for that closer relationship which needs more\r\nwill-power because opportunity is greater.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the lovers will be aiming towards an ideal\r\nwhich recognizes that in wedded life all that is lasting in affection,\r\nin tender courtesy, in most intimate companionship, in sweetest\r\ndemonstration, is possible without the physical union, which in itself\r\nis the most transitory of pleasures, but which in unlimited indulgence\r\nbecomes the most domineering of passions, exhaustive of physical power\r\nand of mental vigor, and absolutely annihilating all true love.\r\n\r\nIf you ask why there should exist this marvelous drawing of the sexes\r\ntowards each other if their relation is not based upon the exercise of\r\nsex-functions, I reply that sex is more than its local expression; it\r\nis inherent in mind as well as body, and therefore sexual power may be\r\nexpressed in masculine courage, energy or daring, or in feminine\r\nconstancy, self-abnegation, or sweet courtesy. Sexual attraction is\r\nnot limited to the local expression, nor creative power to\r\nreproduction of kind, but may give a stimulus to the intellectual\r\ncompanionship of men and women, and result in the creation of nobler\r\nideals and grander aspirations.\r\n\r\nHaving settled in your mind your attitude towards your lover, let us\r\nconsider what it shall be towards your family during these days of\r\nthe engagement. Naturally you will not feel a separation from the home\r\ncircle as keenly as do the other members of your family. You two are\r\nso absorbed in each other, are so busy exchanging ideas, in becoming\r\nacquainted, that you are oblivious to the change brought about in your\r\nfamily. You think you two ought to be allowed the privilege of\r\n_tête-à-têtes_, for of course you cannot talk freely together in the\r\nhearing of others. This is true. You should have times of seclusion,\r\nwhen, without a sense of oppression through fear of criticism or\r\njesting, you can rhapsodize, or quote poetry and open your hearts'\r\ntreasures to each other. But you still owe a duty to your home.\r\nDoubtless your mother is not now as necessary to your happiness as you\r\nare to hers. She is thinking of you with most tender solicitude, she\r\nmisses your presence, she already begins to feel the loneliness of the\r\ninevitable separation. If you are thoughtful you will see to it that\r\nthe separation does not begin sooner than is necessary. Then, too,\r\nyour parents need to get acquainted with this new member whom you are\r\nto introduce into the family, and he needs to know them. He will think\r\nnone the less of you if he sees that you do not allow him to\r\nmonopolize you entirely, that you recognize your obligations to the\r\nfamily and that you expect him to recognize them also, and, in\r\naddition, his obligations to show them due courtesy and attention. He\r\nis not to absorb you entirely, to take you out of the home circle, but\r\nhe is to come in and be a part of it, even as you are to become one in\r\nthe home of which he is a member. You need to remember that he is son\r\nand brother to women who loved him long before you knew him, and that\r\nhe still owes them attention and thoughtful, affectionate courtesy.\r\n\r\nNever allow yourself to feel jealous of his mother or sisters. The\r\nfact that he is a loving, thoughtful son and brother is in a measure a\r\nguarantee that he will be a loving, thoughtful husband.\r\n\r\nLet me add to this advice a word more. Do not allow yourself to feel\r\njealous of him in any way. Jealousy is the quintessence of\r\nselfishness, and no other passion is so destructive of happiness, so\r\nfull of the contagion of evil. If your lover is not to be trusted, you\r\nwould be wise to end the engagement at once. If he is to be trusted,\r\nthat trust should be absolute. I said you should not allow him to\r\nmonopolize you, neither should you attempt to monopolize him. There\r\nare other people in the world besides yourself, and other occupations\r\nthan the business of waiting on you. If you make him feel that he dare\r\nnot speak to anyone but you, that he dare not think of anything but\r\nyou, he will begin to chafe under the restraint and feel a desire to\r\nbreak the bonds that are becoming fetters. If he were not your\r\nacknowledged lover, if you were anxious to win his love, but were a\r\nlittle uncertain as to your power to do so, you would not meet him\r\nwith tears and upbraidings because he had for one moment seemed to\r\nforget you, but you would at once use every possible effort to make\r\nyourself more attractive in his eyes than any other person could\r\npossibly be. You will be wise to use those same tactics now, even\r\nthough his allegiance is pledged to you. Be so charming that no one\r\nelse can be considered so entertaining; that no one else can be so\r\nwise, so witty, so sympathetic, so altogether lovely, that everything\r\nbut yourself is forgotten; and then believe in him so absolutely that\r\nhe could not possibly swerve in his fidelity to you. Have you ever\r\nthought that to accuse one of a certain wrong act may be just the way\r\nto suggest to him the possibility of committing it? If one trusts you\r\nimplicitly, that very trust is a constant suggestion to be true, and\r\ndoubt is a suggestion to act worthy of being doubted.\r\n\r\nYou must trust each other or you have no sure foundation for future\r\nlove and happiness. It needs a great deal of good common sense to\r\nlearn how to live happily in marriage. You may have chosen wisely. The\r\nman may be honest, pure, kindly, intelligent, and Christian, but he is\r\nhuman, therefore not perfect. He has faults, peculiarities, moods,\r\nperhaps tempers, and he will probably not wait until you are married\r\nto begin to show them. There will come differences of opinions,\r\ndivergences in desires, clashings in judgment. Now is the time to\r\ndisplay your tact, to learn how to express an opposing opinion without\r\narousing antagonism, to yield a desire for the sake of a greater love\r\nthan that of self, to adhere to principle without unpleasant\r\ndiscussion; in short, to be dignified and womanly without pettiness or\r\nlittleness of any kind. You remember the words of Ruskin, that the\r\nwoman must be \"incorruptibly good, instinctively, infallibly wise, not\r\nfor self-development, but for self-renunciation,\" and that will be the\r\nhighest development.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you will think that some of this advice should be given to\r\nyoung men as well as to young women, and I think so too, and were I\r\ntalking to your lover I could say many warning words; but just now I\r\nam telling you things that he does not need to hear, and I do not need\r\nto tell you what, if I had the chance, I would say to him. You are to\r\ntrain yourself and not him, and yet I would not have you ignorant of\r\nyour power over him in developing in him all that is noblest and best.\r\nYou should hold him ever to his highest ideals. He should never feel\r\nso absolutely sure of your adoration as to imagine that it will endure\r\na lowering of his standards. You have been posing a little before each\r\nother. Doubtless you were not aware of this, but, now that you have\r\neach gained the heart of the other, you may sometimes feel that you\r\ncan relax; but this is a dangerous error. You should continue to be as\r\nthoughtful, as courteous, as careful as ever; you should endeavor\r\nreally to be all that you have tried or appeared to be during these\r\ndays of courtship. You will be none too perfect even then.\r\n\r\nOnce, in talking to a group of women, I asserted that a wife should\r\nexact of her husband as high a tone of morality as of her lover, that\r\nshe should not allow him to become lax in his conversation with her\r\nany more than with any other woman. One woman thought me too strict.\r\nShe said men liked to feel that at home they could do as they pleased,\r\nand would resent a wife's interference with their right to be loose in\r\ntheir talk in their own home. I replied that the home is not the man's\r\nnor the woman's alone; it is theirs jointly; that each has a right to\r\ndemand that the other shall not pollute or poison the air, the food,\r\nthe water or the moral atmosphere; and the wife who allows\r\ncontamination of the thought-atmosphere of the home is as culpable as\r\nif she were to permit poison to be put into the food.\r\n\r\nAs a man admires the girl who respects herself too much to permit him\r\nto tell her questionable stories, so will he reverence the wife who\r\nrefuses to allow him to degrade himself in her presence either by\r\nspeech or conduct. Love would not so often fail if wives knew the\r\nsecret of retaining it, and that is not by sacrifice of principle, nor\r\nby tearful reproaches and upbraidings, but by being true to the\r\nhighest impulses, and while having the good common sense that can make\r\nall reasonable allowance for fallibility, still permits no lowering of\r\nmoral standards, no willful falling short of the very best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid my friend:\r\n\r\n    There's to be a grand wedding, you know,\r\n    With no end to the fuss and parade,\r\n    With sixteen fair bridesmaids to stand in a row,\r\n    With sixteen young groomsmen to help out the show,\r\n    One to stand by the side of each maid.\r\n\r\n    Then there's a reception to be very fine,\r\n    With all sorts of magnificent things,\r\n    With silver to glitter and mirrors to shine,\r\n    With tropical fruit and famous old wine,\r\n    With odorous flowers and music divine,\r\n    Drawn forth from melodious strings.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of many girls the wedding means only this public show,\r\nthe display of elegant toilets, the reception of costly gifts; and the\r\npreparation of marriage means too often merely the making of an\r\nelegant _trousseau_. People generally do not ask concerning the\r\nfitness of the young people to enter on the solemn duties of life--do\r\nnot ask how well they have been instructed concerning that which is\r\nbefore them; but the questions are all about clothes and gifts and\r\nceremonials. No wonder, then, that the thought of the young woman\r\ncenters on these things, to the exclusion of nearly all else; indeed,\r\nit may be to the detriment of health and the lessening of true\r\nhappiness. The prospective husband finds his _fiancée_ so absorbed in\r\nsewing, shopping and interviews with dressmakers that she has few\r\nmoments to give to him, and these few occupied more with the thought\r\nof gowns and personal adornments than with ideals of wedded happiness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she even excuses herself for lessening the number of his\r\nvisits on the plea that very soon now she will be all his, and so he\r\nis left to spend his last days of bachelorhood in loneliness, and made\r\nto feel that raiment is more than love. Worse still, it may be that on\r\nthe wedding-day he takes to his heart a bride so wearied, so nervously\r\nexhausted by the preparations of the _trousseau_ that she is at least\r\ntemporarily an invalid. I have known more than one bride so worn out\r\nby the preparation for her wedding that instead of bringing\r\nbrightness, joy and beauty into the new life, she brought illness,\r\nanxiety and care, and made demands at once upon the patience and\r\nservice of the husband, who had a right to expect health and vigor and\r\na power to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI knew a sensible girl who said months before her marriage, \"I am not\r\ngoing to bring to my new life a remnant of health, a shattered nervous\r\nsystem and a tattered temper,\" and she kept her word. Her sewing was\r\ndone by degrees, and was all out of the way weeks before the wedding.\r\nShopping and dressmaking were never allowed to interfere with the\r\nwalks and drives, the chats and moonlight strolls. \"We shall not be\r\nable to repeat this experience,\" she wisely said, and so her lover\r\nfound her ever ready to give him her society and her thought. Her\r\n_trousseau_ was not elaborate, her wedding-dress was simple, but in it\r\nshe shone like a flower of the morning, full of brightness and health\r\nand joy.\r\n\r\nShe was wise in other respects. Only her intimate friends were invited\r\nto the wedding ceremony, and to these she said, \"I want you to feel\r\nthat it is you I invite, not your gifts. If your love impels you to\r\ngive me some simple memento of yourself it will be cherished, but I'd\r\nrather have a pincushion made by your own hand, or a little flower\r\npainted by yourself, than the most costly purchased picture or most\r\nelegant piece of silver that you bought, because you thought it was\r\nexpected. And if, when you come, you bring no gift but your love and\r\nblessing, I shall feel that that is the richest treasure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no display of presents to a vulgar curiosity, no collection\r\nof duplicate butter-knives or berry-spoons to be secretly disposed of\r\nafter the wedding. The gifts were few and not costly, but each told\r\nits own story of personal affection, and therefore really had a\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nThis sensible young woman introduced another innovation into her\r\nwedding. She would not listen to the suggestion of a bridal tour. \"I\r\ndo not want to be stared at and commented on by strangers,\" she said.\r\n\"Let us go to some quiet spot in the mountains or by the sea, and let\r\nus live with each other and with nature.\" In after years she often\r\nsaid, \"I would not miss from my memory the picture of those happy days\r\nfor anything that any trip on railway trains and sojourns at hotels\r\ncould give me. We had time and opportunity to learn each other's souls\r\nas we could not have done amid 'the madding crowd;' and we have loved\r\neach other more truly, I know, because in those early wedded days we\r\nsat with Nature and Nature's God in the true companionship which such\r\nsolitude alone can bring.\"\r\n\r\nI never see the parade of a fashionable wedding that I am not reminded\r\nof her and of a sad contrast to her experience, when two young people\r\nwere married amid a blaze of light, a rain of flowers, and under the\r\ncurious eyes of hundreds of strangers took their wedding tour, while\r\nthe papers glowingly described the dress and beauty of the bride, the\r\nnecktie and the trousers of the groom, and pictures of the two were\r\nlabeled \"The Happy Couple.\" In two years the bride came home to her\r\nparents wrecked in health and broken in heart.\r\n\r\nThere is a beauty in a golden wedding that truly celebrates a happy\r\nunion of half a century. But when life is all untried, when perhaps\r\nthe two young people know nothing of what is before them, it may be\r\nare but little acquainted with each other, and have mistaken the\r\nthrill of passion for the steady exaltation of love, then it would\r\nseem wiser to make the occasion one of most solemn import, free from\r\nglitter and show, and full of that deep meaning which makes the heart\r\nstand still in reverence for life's deepest mysteries.\r\n\r\n    O, gallant young groom, it may seem a slight thing\r\n    To take this young girl as your bride;\r\n    To place on her finger the plain golden ring,\r\n    Around her these bright flower-festoons to fling,\r\n    But have you e'er thought what the future will bring\r\n    To you in this life so untried?\r\n\r\n    Have you thought how your temper may often be tried?\r\n    That you may grow gouty and old,\r\n    That the fair smiling face of your bonnie young bride\r\n    May grow pale and haggard, and wrinkled, beside,\r\n    Or she prove a sloven and scold?\r\n\r\n    And you, bonnie bride, on this glad wedding day,\r\n    In the midst of the curious crowd,\r\n    Do you fancy that life will be always so gay?\r\n    Can you work, can you wait, do you know how to pray,\r\n    Can you suffer, and not cry aloud?\r\n\r\n    Can you watch out the hours by sad beds of pain?\r\n    Can you bear and forbear and forgive?\r\n    Can you cheerfully hope e'en when hoping is vain,\r\n    And when hope is dead, and to die you would fain,\r\n    Can you still feel it right you should live?\r\n\r\n    O, touchingly solemn and tender the hour,\r\n    So full of deep meaning the vow\r\n    You have uttered. And sorely you need Divine power\r\n    To guide you and guard you in sunshine and shower,\r\n    For trouble will come and love's delicate flower\r\n    Be crushed, you can scarcely tell how.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, dear heart, there is nothing that has such unconquerable\r\nvitality as love; but it must be true love, not self-love, not\r\nsentimentality, not passion, not any of the spurious emotions that\r\nmasquerade under the name of love, and which wither with the slightest\r\nadverse wind.\r\n\r\nLove is not an exotic, growing only in the conservatories of wealth.\r\nIt is a hardy plant, covering desolate places with verdure, glowing\r\namid the snows of mountain peaks, blossoming by night as well as by\r\nday, hiding defects, clinging to ruins, enduring drouth and heat and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nI know a woman who says that there should never be marriage where\r\nthere are unpleasant peculiarities, idiosyncrasies, or even\r\nmannerisms; but should we act on that principle, few would marry. Love\r\nis sometimes said to be blind in the days of wooing, but wearing\r\nmagnifying glasses after wedlock. True love is never blind, but he is\r\ncapable of judging of true relative values, and will count as naught\r\nthe slight defect when measured by the overwhelming perfection. Who\r\nhas not seen men devoted to wives who were homely or peculiar, but who\r\nwere genuinely pure and true?\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" said one woman, \"if my husband is bald and cross-eyed,\r\nhe has a heart of gold.\"\r\n\r\nTrue love is not blind, but with a deep, keen insight looks through\r\nthe encasing garment of human imperfections, and sees within the\r\ndivine ego, and because it recognizes the true inner self that is\r\nworthy, hopeth all things, believeth all things, endureth all things,\r\nand never faileth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffices _of_ Publication\r\n\r\n¶ IN THE UNITED STATES.
