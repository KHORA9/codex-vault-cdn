BEECHER.\r\n\r\nRevised Edition,\r\nWith Numerous Additions and Illustrative Engravings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew-York:\r\nHarper & Brothers, 82 Cliff Street.\r\n1845.\r\n\r\nEntered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1842, by\r\nThomas H. Webb, & Co.,\r\nin the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nAMERICAN MOTHERS,\r\n\r\nwhose intelligence and virtues have inspired admiration and respect,\r\nwhose experience has furnished many valuable suggestions, in this work,\r\nwhose approbation will be highly valued, and whose influence, in\r\npromoting the object aimed at, is respectfully solicited, this work is\r\ndedicated, by their friend and countrywoman,\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of this work was led to attempt it, by discovering, in her\r\nextensive travels, the deplorable sufferings of multitudes of young\r\nwives and mothers, from the combined influence of _poor health_, _poor\r\ndomestics_, _and a defective domestic education_. The number of young\r\nwomen whose health is crushed, ere the first few years of married life\r\nare past, would seem incredible to one who has not investigated this\r\nsubject, and it would be vain to attempt to depict the sorrow,\r\ndiscouragement, and distress experienced in most families where the wife\r\nand mother is a perpetual invalid.\r\n\r\nThe writer became early convinced that this evil results mainly from the\r\nfact, that young girls, especially in the more wealthy classes, _are not\r\ntrained for their profession_. In early life, they go through a course\r\nof school training which results in great debility of constitution,\r\nwhile, at the same time, their physical and domestic education is almost\r\nwholly neglected. Thus they enter on their most arduous and sacred\r\nduties so inexperienced and uninformed, and with so little muscular and\r\nnervous strength, that probably there is not _one chance in ten_, that\r\nyoung women of the present day, will pass through the first years of\r\nmarried life without such prostration of health and spirits as makes\r\nlife a burden to themselves, and, it is to be feared, such as seriously\r\ninterrupts the confidence and happiness of married life.\r\n\r\nThe measure which, more than any other, would tend to remedy this evil,\r\nwould be to place _domestic economy_ on an equality with the other\r\nsciences in female schools. This should be done because it _can_ be\r\nproperly and systematically taught (not _practically_, but as a\r\n_science_), as much so as _political economy_ or _moral science_, or any\r\nother branch of study; because it embraces knowledge, which will be\r\nneeded by young women at all times and in all places; because this\r\nscience can never be _properly_ taught until it is made a branch of\r\n_study_; and because this method will secure a dignity and importance in\r\nthe estimation of young girls, which can never be accorded while they\r\nperceive their teachers and parents practically attaching more value to\r\nevery other department of science than this. When young ladies are\r\ntaught the construction of their own bodies, and all the causes in\r\ndomestic life which tend to weaken the constitution; when they are\r\ntaught rightly to appreciate and learn the most convenient and\r\neconomical modes of performing all family duties, and of employing time\r\nand money; and when they perceive the true estimate accorded to these\r\nthings by teachers and friends, the grand cause of this evil will be\r\nremoved. Women will be trained to secure, as of first importance, a\r\nstrong and healthy constitution, and all those rules of thrift and\r\neconomy that will make domestic duty easy and pleasant.\r\n\r\nTo promote this object, the writer prepared this volume as a _text-book_\r\nfor female schools. It has been examined by the Massachusetts Board of\r\nEducation, and been deemed worthy by them to be admitted as a part of\r\nthe Massachusetts School Library.\r\n\r\nIt has also been adopted as a text-book in some of our largest and most\r\npopular female schools, both at the East and West.\r\n\r\nThe following, from the pen of Mr. George B. Emmerson, one of the most\r\npopular and successful teachers in our country, who has introduced this\r\nwork as a text-book in his own school, will exhibit the opinion of one\r\nwho has formed his judgment from experience in the use of the work:\r\n\r\n\"It may be objected that such things cannot be taught by books. Why not?\r\nWhy may not the structure of the human body, and the laws of health\r\ndeduced therefrom, be as well taught as the laws of natural philosophy?\r\nWhy are not the application of these laws to the management of infants\r\nand young children as important to a woman as the application of the\r\nrules of arithmetic to the extraction of the cube root? Why may not the\r\nproperties of the atmosphere be explained, in reference to the proper\r\nventilation of rooms, or exercise in the open air, as properly as to the\r\nburning of steel or sodium? Why is not the human skeleton as curious and\r\ninteresting as the air-pump; and the action of the brain, as the action\r\nof a steam-engine? Why may not the healthiness of different kinds of\r\nfood and drink, the proper modes of cooking, and the rules in reference\r\nto the modes and times of taking them, be discussed as properly as rules\r\nof grammar, or facts in history? Are not the principles that should\r\nregulate clothing, the rules of cleanliness, the advantages of early\r\nrising and domestic exercise, as readily communicated as the principles\r\nof mineralogy, or rules of syntax? Are not the rules of Jesus Christ,\r\napplied to refine _domestic manners_ and preserve a _good temper_, as\r\nimportant as the abstract principles of ethics, as taught by Paley,\r\nWayland, or Jouffroy? May not the advantages of neatness, system, and\r\norder, be as well illustrated in showing how they contribute to the\r\nhappiness of a family, as by showing how they add beauty to a copy-book,\r\nor a portfolio of drawings? Would not a teacher be as well employed in\r\nteaching the rules of economy, in regard to time and expenses, or in\r\nregard to dispensing charity, as in teaching double, or single entry in\r\nbookkeeping? Are not the principles that should guide in constructing a\r\nhouse, and in warming and ventilating it properly, as important to young\r\ngirls as the principles of the Athenian Commonwealth, or the rules of\r\nRoman tactics? Is it not as important that children should be taught the\r\ndangers to the mental faculties, when over-excited on the one hand, or\r\nleft unoccupied on the other, as to teach them the conflicting theories\r\nof political economy, or the speculations of metaphysicians? For\r\nourselves, we have always found children, especially girls, peculiarly\r\nready to listen to what they saw would prepare them for future duties.\r\nThe truth, that education should be _a preparation for actual, real\r\nlife_, has the greatest force with children. The constantly-recurring\r\ninquiry, 'What will be _the use_ of this study?' is always satisfied by\r\nshowing, that it will prepare for any duty, relation, or office which,\r\nin the natural course of things, will be likely to come.\r\n\r\n\"We think this book extremely well suited to be used as a text-book in\r\nschools for young ladies, and many chapters are well adapted for a\r\nreading book for children of both sexes.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the writer would add the testimony of a lady who has used this\r\nwork with several classes of young girls and young ladies. She remarked\r\nthat she had never known a school-book that awakened more interest, and\r\nthat some young girls would learn a lesson in this when they would study\r\nnothing else. She remarked, also, that when reciting the chapter on the\r\nconstruction of houses, they became greatly interested in inventing\r\nplans of their own, which gave an opportunity to the teacher to point\r\nout difficulties and defects. Had this part of domestic economy been\r\ntaught in schools, our land would not be so defaced with awkward,\r\nmisshapen, inconvenient, and, at the same time, needlessly expensive\r\nhouses, as it now is.\r\n\r\nAlthough the writer was trained to the care of children, and to perform\r\nall branches of domestic duty, by some of the best of housekeepers, much\r\nin these pages is offered, not as the result of her own experience, but\r\nas what has obtained the approbation of some of the most judicious\r\nmothers and housekeepers in the nation. The articles on Physiology and\r\nHygiene, and those on horticulture, were derived from standard works on\r\nthese subjects, and are sanctioned by the highest authorities.\r\n\r\n_The American Housekeeper's Receipt Book_ is another work prepared by\r\nthe author of the Domestic Economy, in connexion with several\r\nexperienced housekeepers, and is designed for a supplement to this work.\r\nOn pages 354a and 354b will be found the Preface and Analysis of\r\nthat work, the two books being designed for a complete course of\r\ninstructions on every department of Domestic Economy.\r\n\r\nThe copyright interest in these two works is held by a board of\r\ngentlemen appointed for the purpose, who, after paying a moderate\r\ncompensation to the author for the time and labour spent in preparing\r\nthese works, will employ all the remainder paid over by the publishers,\r\nto aid in educating and locating such female teachers as wish to be\r\nemployed in those portions of our country, which are most destitute of\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThe contract with the publisher provides that the publisher shall\r\nguaranty the sales and thus secure against any losses for bad debts, for\r\nwhich he shall receive five _per cent_. He shall charge twenty per cent.\r\nfor commissions paid to retailers, and also the expenses of printing,\r\npaper, and binding, at the current market prices, and make no other\r\ncharges. The net profits thus determined are then to be divided equally,\r\nthe publishers taking one half, and paying the other half to the board\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE,                                                              7\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPECULIAR RESPONSIBILITIES OF AMERICAN WOMEN.\r\n\r\nAmerican Women should feel a peculiar Interest in Democratic\r\nInstitutions.

The great maxim, which is the basis\r\nof all our civil and political institutions, is, that \"all men are\r\ncreated equal,\" and that they are equally entitled to \"life, liberty,\r\nand the pursuit of happiness.\"\r\n\r\nBut it can readily be seen, that this is only another mode of expressing\r\nthe fundamental principle which the Great Ruler of the Universe has\r\nestablished, as the law of His eternal government. \"Thou shalt love thy\r\nneighbor as thyself;\" and \"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to\r\nyou, do ye even so to them,\" are the Scripture forms, by which the\r\nSupreme Lawgiver requires that each individual of our race shall regard\r\nthe happiness of others, as of the same value as his own; and which\r\nforbid any institution, in private or civil life, which secures\r\nadvantages to one class, by sacrificing the interests of another.\r\n\r\nThe principles of democracy, then, are identical with the principles of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nBut, in order that each individual may pursue and secure the highest\r\ndegree of happiness within his reach, unimpeded by the selfish interests\r\nof others, a system of laws must be established, which sustain certain\r\nrelations and dependencies in social and civil life. What these\r\nrelations and their attending obligations shall be, are to be\r\ndetermined, not with reference to the wishes and interests of a few, but\r\nsolely with reference to the general good of all; so that each\r\nindividual shall have his own interest, as well as the public benefit,\r\nsecured by them.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, it is needful that certain relations be sustained,\r\nwhich involve the duties of subordination. There must be the magistrate\r\nand the subject, one of whom is the superior, and the other the\r\ninferior. There must be the relations of husband and wife, parent and\r\nchild, teacher and pupil, employer and employed, each involving the\r\nrelative duties of subordination. The superior, in certain particulars,\r\nis to direct, and the inferior is to yield obedience. Society could\r\nnever go forward, harmoniously, nor could any craft or profession be\r\nsuccessfully pursued, unless these superior and subordinate relations be\r\ninstituted and sustained.\r\n\r\nBut who shall take the higher, and who the subordinate, stations in\r\nsocial and civil life? This matter, in the case of parents and children,\r\nis decided by the Creator. He has given children to the control of\r\nparents, as their superiors, and to them they remain subordinate, to a\r\ncertain age, or so long as they are members of their household. And\r\nparents can delegate such a portion of their authority to teachers and\r\nemployers, as the interests of their children require.\r\n\r\nIn most other cases, in a truly democratic state, each individual is\r\nallowed to choose for himself, who shall take the position of his\r\nsuperior. No woman is forced to obey any husband but the one she chooses\r\nfor herself; nor is she obliged to take a husband, if she prefers to\r\nremain single. So every domestic, and every artisan or laborer, after\r\npassing from parental control, can choose the employer to whom he is to\r\naccord obedience, or, if he prefers to relinquish certain advantages, he\r\ncan remain without taking a subordinate place to any employer.\r\n\r\nEach subject, also, has equal power with every other, to decide who\r\nshall be his superior as a ruler. The weakest, the poorest, the most\r\nilliterate, has the same opportunity to determine this question, as the\r\nrichest, the most learned, and the most exalted.\r\n\r\nAnd the various privileges that wealth secures, are equally open to all\r\nclasses. Every man may aim at riches, unimpeded by any law or\r\ninstitution which secures peculiar privileges to a favored class, at the\r\nexpense of another. Every law, and every institution, is tested by\r\nexamining whether it secures equal advantages to all; and, if the people\r\nbecome convinced that any regulation sacrifices the good of the majority\r\nto the interests of the smaller number, they have power to abolish it.\r\n\r\nThe institutions of monarchical and aristocratic nations are based on\r\nprecisely opposite principles. They secure, to certain small and favored\r\nclasses, advantages, which can be maintained, only by sacrificing the\r\ninterests of the great mass of the people. Thus, the throne and\r\naristocracy of England are supported by laws and customs, which burden\r\nthe lower classes with taxes, so enormous, as to deprive them of all the\r\nluxuries, and of most of the comforts, of life. Poor dwellings, scanty\r\nfood, unhealthy employments, excessive labor, and entire destitution of\r\nthe means and time for education, are appointed for the lower classes,\r\nthat a few may live in palaces, and riot in every indulgence.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of democratic institutions, in reference to the rights\r\nand interests of the female sex, have been fully developed in the United\r\nStates; and it is in this aspect, that the subject is one of peculiar\r\ninterest to American women. In this Country, it is established, both by\r\nopinion and by practice, that woman has an equal interest in all social\r\nand civil concerns; and that no domestic, civil, or political,\r\ninstitution, is right, which sacrifices her interest to promote that of\r\nthe other sex. But in order to secure her the more firmly in all these\r\nprivileges, it is decided, that, in the domestic relation, she take a\r\nsubordinate station, and that, in civil and political concerns, her\r\ninterests be intrusted to the other sex, without her taking any part in\r\nvoting, or in making and administering laws. The result of this order of\r\nthings has been fairly tested, and is thus portrayed by M. De\r\nTocqueville, a writer, who, for intelligence, fidelity, and ability,\r\nranks second to none.\r\n\r\n\"There are people in Europe, who, confounding together the different\r\ncharacteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman, beings not\r\nonly equal, but alike. They would give to both the same functions,\r\nimpose on both the same duties, and grant to both the same rights. They\r\nwould mix them in all things,--their business, their occupations, their\r\npleasures. It may readily be conceived, that, by _thus_ attempting to\r\nmake one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and, from so\r\npreposterous a medley of the works of Nature, nothing could ever result,\r\nbut weak men and disorderly women.\r\n\r\n\"It is not thus that the Americans understand the species of democratic\r\nequality, which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that,\r\nas Nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and\r\nmoral constitutions of man and woman, her manifest design was, to give a\r\ndistinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold, that\r\nimprovement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty\r\nnearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfil their\r\nrespective tasks, in the best possible manner. The Americans have\r\napplied to the sexes the great principle of political economy, which\r\ngoverns the manufactories of our age, by carefully dividing the duties\r\nof man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may\r\nbe the better carried on.\r\n\r\n\"In no country has such constant care been taken, as in America, to\r\ntrace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes, and to\r\nmake them keep pace one with the other, but in two pathways which are\r\nalways different. American women never manage the outward concerns of\r\nthe family, or conduct a business, or take a part in political life; nor\r\nare they, on the other hand, ever compelled to perform the rough labor\r\nof the fields, or to make any of those laborious exertions, which\r\ndemand the exertion of physical strength. No families are so poor, as to\r\nform an exception to this rule.\r\n\r\n\"If, on the one hand, an American woman cannot escape from the quiet\r\ncircle of domestic employments, on the other hand, she is never forced\r\nto go beyond it. Hence it is, that the women of America, who often\r\nexhibit a masculine strength of understanding, and a manly energy,\r\ngenerally preserve great delicacy of personal appearance, and always\r\nretain the manners of women, although they sometimes show that they have\r\nthe hearts and minds of men.\r\n\r\n\"Nor have the Americans ever supposed, that one consequence of\r\ndemocratic principles, is, the subversion of marital power, or the\r\nconfusion of the natural authorities in families. They hold, that every\r\nassociation must have a head, in order to accomplish its object; and\r\nthat the natural head of the conjugal association is man. They do not,\r\ntherefore, deny him the right of directing his partner; and they\r\nmaintain, that, in the smaller association of husband and wife, as well\r\nas in the great social community, the object of democracy is, to\r\nregulate and legalize the powers which are necessary, not to subvert all\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"This opinion is not peculiar to one sex, and contested by the other. I\r\nnever observed, that the women of America considered conjugal authority\r\nas a fortunate usurpation of their rights, nor that they thought\r\nthemselves degraded by submitting to it. It appears to me, on the\r\ncontrary, that they attach a sort of pride to the voluntary surrender of\r\ntheir own will, and make it their boast to bend themselves to the yoke,\r\nnot to shake it off. Such, at least, is the feeling expressed by the\r\nmost virtuous of their sex; the others are silent; and in the United\r\nStates it is not the practice for a guilty wife to clamor for the rights\r\nof woman, while she is trampling on her holiest duties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although the travellers, who have visited North America, differ on a\r\ngreat number of points, they agree in remarking, that morals are far\r\nmore strict, there, than elsewhere.[A] It is evident that, on this\r\npoint, the Americans are very superior to their progenitors, the\r\nEnglish.\" \"In England, as in all other Countries of Europe, public\r\nmalice is constantly attacking the frailties of women. Philosophers and\r\nstatesmen are heard to deplore, that morals are not sufficiently strict;\r\nand the literary productions of the Country constantly lead one to\r\nsuppose so. In America, all books, novels not excepted, suppose women to\r\nbe chaste; and no one thinks of relating affairs of gallantry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has often been remarked, that, in Europe, a certain degree of\r\ncontempt lurks, even in the flattery which men lavish upon women.\r\nAlthough a European frequently affects to be the slave of woman, it may\r\nbe seen, that he never sincerely thinks her his equal. In the United\r\nStates, men seldom compliment women, but they daily show how much they\r\nesteem them. They constantly display an entire confidence in the\r\nunderstanding of a wife, and a profound respect for her freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThey have decided that her mind is just as fitted as that of a man to\r\ndiscover the plain truth, and her heart as firm to embrace it, and they\r\nhave never sought to place her virtue, any more than his, under the\r\nshelter of prejudice, ignorance, and fear.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem, that in Europe, where man so easily submits to the\r\ndespotic sway of woman, they are nevertheless curtailed of some of the\r\ngreatest qualities of the human species, and considered as seductive,\r\nbut imperfect beings, and (what may well provoke astonishment) women\r\nultimately look upon themselves in the same light, and almost consider\r\nit as a privilege that they are entitled to show themselves futile,\r\nfeeble, and timid. The women of America claim no such privileges.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, that the Americans rarely lavish upon women those eager\r\nattentions which are commonly paid them in Europe. But their conduct to\r\nwomen always implies, that they suppose them to be virtuous and refined;\r\nand such is the respect entertained for the moral freedom of the sex,\r\nthat, in the presence of a woman, the most guarded language is used,\r\nlest her ear should be offended by an expression. In America, a young\r\nunmarried woman may, alone, and without fear, undertake a long journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus the Americans do not think that man and woman have either the\r\nduty, or the right, to perform the same offices, but they show an equal\r\nregard for both their respective parts; and, though their lot is\r\ndifferent, they consider both of them, as beings of equal value. They do\r\nnot give to the courage of woman the same form, or the same direction,\r\nas to that of man; but they never doubt her courage: and if they hold\r\nthat man and his partner ought not always to exercise their intellect\r\nand understanding in the same manner, they at least believe the\r\nunderstanding of the one to be as sound as that of the other, and her\r\nintellect to be as clear. Thus, then, while they have allowed the social\r\ninferiority of woman to subsist, they have done all they could to raise\r\nher, morally and intellectually, to the level of man; and, in this\r\nrespect, they appear to me to have excellently understood the true\r\nprinciple of democratic improvement.\r\n\r\n\"As for myself, I do not hesitate to avow, that, although the women of\r\nthe United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic\r\nlife, and their situation is, in some respects, one of extreme\r\ndependence, I have nowhere seen women occupying a loftier position; and\r\nif I were asked, now I am drawing to the close of this work, in which I\r\nhave spoken of so many important things done by the Americans, to what\r\nthe singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly\r\nto be attributed, I should reply,--_to the superiority of their women_.\"\r\n\r\nThis testimony of a foreigner, who has had abundant opportunities of\r\nmaking a comparison, is sanctioned by the assent of all candid and\r\nintelligent men, who have enjoyed similar opportunities.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that it is in America, alone, that women are raised to\r\nan equality with the other sex; and that, both in theory and practice,\r\ntheir interests are regarded as of equal value. They are made\r\nsubordinate in station, only where a regard to their best interests\r\ndemands it, while, as if in compensation for this, by custom and\r\ncourtesy, they are always treated as superiors. Universally, in this\r\nCountry, through every class of society, precedence is given to woman,\r\nin all the comforts, conveniences, and courtesies, of life.\r\n\r\nIn civil and political affairs, American women take no interest or\r\nconcern, except so far as they sympathize with their family and personal\r\nfriends; but in all cases, in which they do feel a concern, their\r\nopinions and feelings have a consideration, equal, or even superior, to\r\nthat of the other sex.\r\n\r\nIn matters pertaining to the education of their children, in the\r\nselection and support of a clergyman, in all benevolent enterprises, and\r\nin all questions relating to morals or manners, they have a superior\r\ninfluence. In such concerns, it would be impossible to carry a point,\r\ncontrary to their judgement and feelings; while an enterprise, sustained\r\nby them, will seldom fail of success.\r\n\r\nIf those who are bewailing themselves over the fancied wrongs and\r\ninjuries of women in this Nation, could only see things as they are,\r\nthey would know, that, whatever remnants of a barbarous or aristocratic\r\nage may remain in our civil institutions, in reference to the interests\r\nof women, it is only because they are ignorant of them, or do not use\r\ntheir influence to have them rectified; for it is very certain that\r\nthere is nothing reasonable, which American women would unite in asking,\r\nthat would not readily be bestowed.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks, then, illustrate the position, that the\r\ndemocratic institutions of this Country are in reality no other than\r\nthe principles of Christianity carried into operation, and that they\r\ntend to place woman in her true position in society, as having equal\r\nrights with the other sex; and that, in fact, they have secured to\r\nAmerican women a lofty and fortunate position, which, as yet, has been\r\nattained by the women of no other nation.\r\n\r\nThere is another topic, presented in the work of the above author, which\r\ndemands the profound attention of American women.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from that part of the Introduction to the work,\r\nillustrating the position, that, for ages, there has been a constant\r\nprogress, in all civilized nations, towards the democratic equality\r\nattained in this Country.\r\n\r\n\"The various occurrences of national existence have every where turned\r\nto the advantage of democracy; all men have aided it by their exertions;\r\nthose who have intentionally labored in its cause, and those who have\r\nserved it unwittingly; those who have fought for it, and those who have\r\ndeclared themselves its opponents, have all been driven along in the\r\nsame track, have all labored to one end;\" \"all have been blind\r\ninstruments in the hands of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gradual developement of the equality of conditions, is, therefore,\r\na Providential fact; and it possesses all the characteristics of a\r\nDivine decree: it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all\r\nhuman interference, and all events, as well as all men, contribute to\r\nits progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole book, which is here offered to the public, has been written\r\nunder the impression of a kind of religious dread, produced in the\r\nauthor's mind, by the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution,\r\nwhich has advanced for centuries, in spite of such amazing obstacles,\r\nand which is still proceeding in the midst of the ruins it has made.\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary that God Himself should speak, in order to\r\ndisclose to us the unquestionable signs of His will. We can discern them\r\nin the habitual course of Nature, and in the invariable tendency of\r\nevents.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the men of our time were led, by attentive observation, and by\r\nsincere reflection, to acknowledge that the gradual and progressive\r\ndevelopement of social equality is at once the past and future of their\r\nhistory, this solitary truth would confer the sacred character of a\r\nDivine decree upon the change. To attempt to check democracy, would be,\r\nin that case, to resist the will of God; and the nations would then be\r\nconstrained to make the best of the social lot awarded to them by\r\nProvidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity, that I have\r\nexamined America; my wish has been to find instruction by which we may\r\nourselves profit.\" \"I have not even affected to discuss whether the\r\nsocial revolution, which I believe to be irresistible, is advantageous\r\nor prejudicial to mankind. I have acknowledged this revolution, as a\r\nfact already accomplished, or on the eve of its accomplishment; and I\r\nhave selected the nation, from among those which have undergone it, in\r\nwhich its developement has been the most peaceful and the most complete,\r\nin order to discern its natural consequences, and, if it be possible, to\r\ndistinguish the means by which it may be rendered profitable. I confess,\r\nthat in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of democracy\r\nitself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its\r\npassions, in order to learn what we have to fear, or to hope, from its\r\nprogress.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that the sublime and elevating anticipations which have\r\nfilled the mind and heart of the religious world, have become so far\r\ndeveloped, that philosophers and statesmen are perceiving the signs, and\r\nare predicting the approach, of the same grand consummation. There is a\r\nday advancing, \"by seers predicted, and by poets sung,\" when the curse\r\nof selfishness shall be removed; when \"scenes surpassing fable, and yet\r\ntrue,\" shall be realized; when all nations shall rejoice and be made\r\nblessed, under those benevolent influences, which the Messiah came to\r\nestablish on earth.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the Country, which the Disposer of events designs shall go\r\nforth as the cynosure of nations, to guide them to the light and\r\nblessedness of that day. To us is committed the grand, the responsible\r\nprivilege, of exhibiting to the world, the beneficent influences of\r\nChristianity, when carried into every social, civil, and political\r\ninstitution; and, though we have, as yet, made such imperfect advances,\r\nalready the light is streaming into the dark prison-house of despotic\r\nlands, while startled kings and sages, philosophers and statesmen, are\r\nwatching us with that interest, which a career so illustrious, and so\r\ninvolving their own destiny, is calculated to excite. They are studying\r\nour institutions, scrutinizing our experience, and watching for our\r\nmistakes, that they may learn whether \"a social revolution, so\r\nirresistible, be advantageous or prejudicial to mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThere are persons, who regard these interesting truths merely as food\r\nfor national vanity; but every reflecting and Christian mind, must\r\nconsider it as an occasion for solemn and anxious reflection. Are we,\r\nthen, a spectacle to the world? Has the Eternal Lawgiver appointed us to\r\nwork out a problem, involving the destiny of the whole earth? Are such\r\nmomentous interests to be advanced or retarded, just in proportion as we\r\nare faithful to our high trust? \"What manner of persons, then, ought we\r\nto be,\" in attempting to sustain so solemn, so glorious a\r\nresponsibility?\r\n\r\nBut the part to be enacted by American women, in this great moral\r\nenterprise, is the point to which special attention should here be\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nThe success of democratic institutions, as is conceded by all, depends\r\nupon the intellectual and moral character of the mass of the people. If\r\nthey are intelligent and virtuous, democracy is a blessing; but if they\r\nare ignorant and wicked, it is only a curse, and as much more dreadful\r\nthan any other form of civil government, as a thousand tyrants are more\r\nto be dreaded than one. It is equally conceded, that the formation of\r\nthe moral and intellectual character of the young is committed mainly to\r\nthe female hand. The mother forms the character of the future man; the\r\nsister bends the fibres that are hereafter to be the forest tree; the\r\nwife sways the heart, whose energies may turn for good or for evil the\r\ndestinies of a nation. Let the women of a country be made virtuous and\r\nintelligent, and the men will certainly be the same. The proper\r\neducation of a man decides the welfare of an individual; but educate a\r\nwoman, and the interests of a whole family are secured.\r\n\r\nIf this be so, as none will deny, then to American women, more than to\r\nany others on earth, is committed the exalted privilege of extending\r\nover the world those blessed influences, which are to renovate degraded\r\nman, and \"clothe all climes with beauty.\"\r\n\r\nNo American woman, then, has any occasion for feeling that hers is an\r\nhumble or insignificant lot. The value of what an individual\r\naccomplishes, is to be estimated by the importance of the enterprise\r\nachieved, and not by the particular position of the laborer. The drops\r\nof heaven which freshen the earth, are each of equal value, whether they\r\nfall in the lowland meadow, or the princely parterre. The builders of a\r\ntemple are of equal importance, whether they labor on the foundations,\r\nor toil upon the dome.\r\n\r\nThus, also, with those labors which are to be made effectual in the\r\nregeneration of the Earth. And it is by forming a habit of regarding the\r\napparently insignificant efforts of each isolated laborer, in a\r\ncomprehensive manner, as indispensable portions of a grand result, that\r\nthe minds of all, however humble their sphere of service, can be\r\ninvigorated and cheered. The woman, who is rearing a family of\r\nchildren; the woman, who labors in the schoolroom; the woman, who, in\r\nher retired chamber, earns, with her needle, the mite, which contributes\r\nto the intellectual and moral elevation of her Country; even the humble\r\ndomestic, whose example and influence may be moulding and forming young\r\nminds, while her faithful services sustain a prosperous domestic\r\nstate;--each and all may be animated by the consciousness, that they are\r\nagents in accomplishing the greatest work that ever was committed to\r\nhuman responsibility. It is the building of a glorious temple, whose\r\nbase shall be coextensive with the bounds of the earth, whose summit\r\nshall pierce the skies, whose splendor shall beam on all lands; and\r\nthose who hew the lowliest stone, as much as those who carve the highest\r\ncapital, will be equally honored, when its top-stone shall be laid, with\r\nnew rejoicings of the morning stars, and shoutings of the sons of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[A] Miss Martineau is a singular exception to this remark. After\r\nreceiving unexampled hospitalities and kindnesses, she gives the\r\nfollowing picture of her entertainers. Having in other places spoken of\r\nthe American woman as having \"her intellect confined,\" and \"her morals\r\ncrushed,\" and as deficient in education, because she has \"none of the\r\nobjects in life for which an enlarged education is considered\r\nrequisite,\" she says,--\"It is assumed, in America, particularly in New\r\nEngland, that the morals of society there are peculiarly pure. I am\r\ngrieved to doubt the fact; but I do doubt it.\" \"The Auld-Robin-Gray\r\nstory is a frequently-enacted tragedy here; and one of the worst\r\nsymptoms that struck me, was, that there was usually a demand upon my\r\nsympathy in such cases.\"--\"The unavoidable consequence of such a mode of\r\nmarrying, is, that the sanctity of marriage is impaired, and that vice\r\nsucceeds. There are sad tales in country villages, here and there, that\r\nattest this; and yet more in towns, in a rank of society where such\r\nthings are seldom or never heard of in England.\"--\"I unavoidably knew of\r\nmore cases of lapse in highly respectable families in one State, than\r\never came to my knowledge at home; and they were got over with a\r\ndisgrace far more temporary and superficial than they could have been\r\nvisited with in England.\"--\"The vacuity of mind of many women, is, I\r\nconclude, the cause of a vice, which it is painful to allude to, but\r\nwhich cannot honestly be passed over.--It is no secret on the spot, that\r\nthe habit of intemperance is not infrequent among women of station and\r\neducation in the most enlightened parts of the Country. I witnessed some\r\ninstances, and heard of more. It does not seem to me to be regarded with\r\nall the dismay which such a symptom ought to excite. To the stranger, a\r\nnovelty so horrible, a spectacle so fearful, suggests wide and deep\r\nsubjects of investigation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for language to give representations more false in\r\nevery item. In evidence of this, the writer would mention, that, within\r\nthe last few years, she has travelled almost the entire route taken by\r\nMiss Martineau, except the lower tier of the Southern States; and,\r\nthough not meeting the same individuals, has mingled in the very same\r\ncircles. Moreover, she has _resided_ from several months to several\r\nyears in _eight_ of the different Northern and Western States, and spent\r\nseveral weeks at a time in five other States. She has also had pupils\r\nfrom every State in the Union, but two, and has visited extensively at\r\ntheir houses. But in her whole life, and in all these different\r\npositions, the writer has never, to her knowledge, seen even _one_\r\nwoman, of the classes with which she has associated, who had lapsed in\r\nthe manner indicated by Miss Martineau; nor does she believe that such a\r\nwoman could find admission in such circles any where in the Country. As\r\nto intemperate women, _five_ cases are all of whom the writer has ever\r\nheard, in such circles, and two of these many believed to be\r\nunwarrantably suspected. After following in Miss Martineau's track, and\r\ndiscovering all the falsehood, twaddle, gossip, old saws, and almanac\r\nstories, which have been strung together in her books, no charitable\r\nmode of accounting for the medley remains, but to suppose her the\r\npitiable dupe of that love of hoaxing so often found in our Country.\r\n\r\nAgain, Miss Martineau says, \"We passed an unshaded meadow, where the\r\ngrass had caught fire, _every day_, at _eleven o'clock_, the preceding\r\nSummer. This demonstrates the necessity of shade\"! A woman, with so\r\nlittle common sense, as to swallow such an absurdity for truth, and then\r\ntack to it such an astute deduction, must be a tempting subject for the\r\nabovementioned mischievous propensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES PECULIAR TO AMERICAN WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, were presented those views, which are\r\ncalculated to inspire American women with a sense of their high\r\nresponsibilities to their Country, and to the world; and of the\r\nexcellence and grandeur of the object to which their energies may be\r\nconsecrated.\r\n\r\nBut it will be found to be the law of moral action, that whatever\r\ninvolves great results and great benefits, is always attended with great\r\nhazards and difficulties. And as it has been shown, that American women\r\nhave a loftier position, and a more elevated object of enterprise, than\r\nthe females of any other nation, so it will appear, that they have\r\ngreater trials and difficulties to overcome, than any other women are\r\ncalled to encounter.\r\n\r\nProperly to appreciate the nature of these trials, it must be borne in\r\nmind, that the estimate of evils and privations depends, not so much on\r\ntheir positive nature, as on the character and habits of the person who\r\nmeets them. A woman, educated in the savage state, finds it no trial to\r\nbe destitute of many conveniences, which a woman, even of the lowest\r\ncondition, in this Country, would deem indispensable to existence. So a\r\nwoman, educated with the tastes and habits of the best New England or\r\nVirginia housekeepers, would encounter many deprivations and trials,\r\nwhich would never occur to one reared in the log cabin of a new\r\nsettlement. So, also, a woman, who has been accustomed to carry forward\r\nher arrangements with well-trained domestics, would meet a thousand\r\ntrials to her feelings and temper, by the substitution of ignorant\r\nforeigners, or shiftless slaves, which would be of little account to one\r\nwho had never enjoyed any better service.\r\n\r\nNow, the larger portion of American women are the descendants of English\r\nprogenitors, who, as a nation, are distinguished for systematic\r\nhousekeeping, and for a great love of order, cleanliness, and comfort.\r\nAnd American women, to a greater or less extent, have inherited similar\r\ntastes and habits. But the prosperity and democratic tendencies of this\r\nCountry produce results, materially affecting the comfort of\r\nhousekeepers, which the females of monarchical and aristocratic lands\r\nare not called to meet. In such countries, all ranks and classes are\r\nfixed in a given position, and each person is educated for a particular\r\nsphere and style of living. And the dwellings, conveniences, and customs\r\nof life, remain very nearly the same, from generation to generation.\r\nThis secures the preparation of all classes for their particular\r\nstation, and makes the lower orders more dependent, and more subservient\r\nto employers.\r\n\r\nBut how different is the state of things in this Country. Every thing\r\nis moving and changing. Persons in poverty, are rising to opulence, and\r\npersons of wealth, are sinking to poverty. The children of common\r\nlaborers, by their talents and enterprise, are becoming nobles in\r\nintellect, or wealth, or office; while the children of the wealthy,\r\nenervated by indulgence, are sinking to humbler stations. The sons of\r\nthe wealthy are leaving the rich mansions of their fathers, to dwell in\r\nthe log cabins of the forest, where very soon they bear away the\r\ndaughters of ease and refinement, to share the privations of a new\r\nsettlement. Meantime, even in the more stationary portions of the\r\ncommunity, there is a mingling of all grades of wealth, intellect, and\r\neducation. There are no distinct classes, as in aristocratic lands,\r\nwhose bounds are protected by distinct and impassable lines, but all are\r\nthrown into promiscuous masses. Thus, persons of humble means are\r\nbrought into contact with those of vast wealth, while all intervening\r\ngrades are placed side by side. Thus, too, there is a constant\r\ncomparison of conditions, among equals, and a constant temptation\r\npresented to imitate the customs, and to strive for the enjoyments, of\r\nthose who possess larger means.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the flow of wealth, among all classes, is\r\nconstantly increasing the number of those who live in a style demanding\r\nmuch hired service, while the number of those, who are compelled to go\r\nto service, is constantly diminishing. Our manufactories, also, are\r\nmaking increased demands for female labor, and offering larger\r\ncompensation. In consequence of these things, there is such a\r\ndisproportion between those who wish to hire, and those who are willing\r\nto go to domestic service, that, in the non-slaveholding States, were it\r\nnot for the supply of poverty-stricken foreigners, there would not be a\r\ndomestic for each family who demands one. And this resort to foreigners,\r\npoor as it is, scarcely meets the demand; while the disproportion must\r\nevery year increase, especially if our prosperity increases. For, just\r\nin proportion as wealth rolls in upon us, the number of those, who will\r\ngive up their own independent homes to serve strangers, will be\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and sufferings, which have accrued to American women,\r\nfrom this cause, are almost incalculable. There is nothing, which so\r\nmuch demands system and regularity, as the affairs of a housekeeper,\r\nmade up, as they are, of ten thousand desultory and minute items; and\r\nyet, this perpetually fluctuating state of society seems forever to bar\r\nany such system and regularity. The anxieties, vexations, perplexities,\r\nand even hard labor, which come upon American women, from this state of\r\ndomestic service, are endless; and many a woman has, in consequence,\r\nbeen disheartened, discouraged, and ruined in health. The only wonder\r\nis, that, amid so many real difficulties, American women are still able\r\nto maintain such a character for energy, fortitude, and amiableness, as\r\nis universally allowed to be their due.\r\n\r\nBut the second, and still greater difficulty, peculiar to American\r\nwomen, is, a delicacy of constitution, which renders them early victims\r\nto disease and decay.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the women of this Country are unusually subject to\r\ndisease, and that their beauty and youthfulness are of shorter\r\ncontinuance than those of the women of other nations, is one which\r\nalways attracts the attention of foreigners; while medical men and\r\nphilanthropists are constantly giving fearful monitions as to the extent\r\nand alarming increase of this evil. Investigations make it evident, that\r\na large proportion of young ladies, from the wealthier classes, have the\r\nincipient stages of curvature of the spine, one of the most sure and\r\nfruitful causes of future disease and decay. The writer has heard\r\nmedical men, who have made extensive inquiries, say, that a very large\r\nproportion of the young women at boarding schools, are affected in this\r\nway, while many other indications of disease and debility exist, in\r\ncases where this particular evil cannot be detected.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this enfeebled state of their constitutions, induced\r\nby a neglect of their physical education, as soon as they are called to\r\nthe responsibilities and trials of domestic life, their constitution\r\nfails, and their whole existence is rendered a burden. For no woman can\r\nenjoy existence, when disease throws a dark cloud over the mind, and\r\nincapacitates her for the proper discharge of every duty.\r\n\r\nThe writer, who for some ten years has had the charge of an institution,\r\nconsisting of young ladies from almost every State in the Union, since\r\nrelinquishing that charge, has travelled and visited extensively in most\r\nof the non-slaveholding States. In these circuits, she has learned the\r\ndomestic history, not merely of her pupils, but of many other young\r\nwives and mothers, whose sorrowful experience has come to her knowledge.\r\nAnd the impression, produced by the dreadful extent of this evil, has at\r\ntimes been almost overwhelming.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if the primeval curse, which has written the doom of\r\npain and sorrow on one period of a young mother's life, in this Country\r\nhad been extended over all; so that the hour seldom arrives, when \"she\r\nforgetteth her sorrow for joy that a man is born into the world.\" Many a\r\nmother will testify, with shuddering, that the most exquisite sufferings\r\nshe ever endured, were not those appointed by Nature, but those, which,\r\nfor week after week, have worn down health and spirits, when nourishing\r\nher child. And medical men teach us, that this, in most cases, results\r\nfrom a debility of constitution, consequent on the mismanagement of\r\nearly life. And so frequent and so mournful are these, and the other\r\ndistresses that result from the delicacy of the female constitution,\r\nthat the writer has repeatedly heard mothers say, that they had wept\r\ntears of bitterness over their infant daughters, at the thought of the\r\nsufferings which they were destined to undergo; while they cherished\r\nthe decided wish, that these daughters should never marry. At the same\r\ntime, many a reflecting young woman is looking to her future prospects,\r\nwith very different feelings and hopes from those which Providence\r\ndesigned.\r\n\r\nA perfectly healthy woman, especially a perfectly healthy mother, is so\r\nunfrequent, in some of the wealthier classes, that those, who are so,\r\nmay be regarded as the exceptions, and not as the general rule. The\r\nwriter has heard some of her friends declare, that they would ride fifty\r\nmiles, to see a perfectly healthy and vigorous woman, out of the\r\nlaboring classes. This, although somewhat jocose, was not an entirely\r\nunfair picture of the true state of female health in the wealthier\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThere are many causes operating, which serve to perpetuate and increase\r\nthis evil. It is a well-known fact, that mental excitement tends to\r\nweaken the physical system, unless it is counterbalanced by a\r\ncorresponding increase of exercise and fresh air. Now, the people of\r\nthis Country are under the influence of high commercial, political, and\r\nreligious stimulus, altogether greater than was ever known by any other\r\nnation; and in all this, women are made the sympathizing companions of\r\nthe other sex. At the same time, young girls, in pursuing an education,\r\nhave ten times greater an amount of intellectual taxation demanded, than\r\nwas ever before exacted. Let any daughter, educated in our best schools\r\nat this day, compare the course of her study with that pursued in her\r\nmother's early life, and it will be seen that this estimate of the\r\nincrease of mental taxation probably falls below the truth. Though, in\r\nsome countries, there are small classes of females, in the higher\r\ncircles, who pursue literature and science to a far greater extent than\r\nin any corresponding circles in this Country, yet, in no nation in the\r\nworld are the advantages of a good intellectual education enjoyed, by so\r\nlarge a proportion of the females. And this education has consisted far\r\nless of accomplishments, and far more of those solid studies which\r\ndemand the exercise of the various powers of mind, than the education\r\nof the women of other lands.\r\n\r\nAnd when American women are called to the responsibilities of domestic\r\nlife, the degree in which their minds and feelings are taxed, is\r\naltogether greater than it is in any other nation.\r\n\r\nNo women on earth have a higher sense of their moral and religious\r\nresponsibilities, or better understand, not only what is demanded of\r\nthem, as housekeepers, but all the claims that rest upon them as wives,\r\nmothers, and members of a social community. An American woman, who is\r\nthe mistress of a family, feels her obligations, in reference to her\r\ninfluence over her husband, and a still greater responsibility in\r\nrearing and educating her children. She feels, too, the claims which the\r\nmoral interests of her domestics have on her watchful care. In social\r\nlife, she recognises the claims of hospitality, and the demands of\r\nfriendly visiting. Her responsibility, in reference to the institutions\r\nof benevolence and religion, is deeply realized. The regular worship of\r\nthe Lord's day, and all the various religious meetings and benevolent\r\nsocieties which place so much dependence on female influence and\r\nexample, she feels obligated to sustain. Add to these multiplied\r\nresponsibilities, the perplexities and evils which have been pointed\r\nout, resulting from the fluctuating state of society, and the deficiency\r\nof domestic service, and no one can deny that American women are exposed\r\nto a far greater amount of intellectual and moral excitement, than those\r\nof any other land. Of course, in order to escape the danger resulting\r\nfrom this, a greater amount of exercise in the fresh air, and all those\r\nmethods which strengthen the constitution, are imperiously required.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of this, it will be found, that, owing to the climate and\r\ncustoms of this Nation, there are no women who secure so little of this\r\nhealthful and protecting regimen, as ours. Walking and riding and\r\ngardening, in the open air, are practised by the women of other lands,\r\nto a far greater extent, than by American females. Most English women,\r\nin the wealthier classes, are able to walk six and eight miles, without\r\noppressive fatigue; and when they visit this Country, always express\r\ntheir surprise at the inactive habits of American ladies. In England,\r\nregular exercise, in the open air, is very commonly required by the\r\nmother, as a part of daily duty, and is sought by young women, as an\r\nenjoyment. In consequence of a different physical training, English\r\nwomen, in those circles which enjoy competency, present an appearance\r\nwhich always strikes American gentlemen as a contrast to what they see\r\nat home. An English mother, at thirty, or thirty-five, is in the full\r\nbloom of perfected womanhood; as fresh and healthful as her daughters.\r\nBut where are the American mothers, who can reach this period unfaded\r\nand unworn? In America, young ladies of the wealthier classes are sent\r\nto school from early childhood; and neither parents nor teachers make it\r\na definite object to secure a proper amount of fresh air and exercise,\r\nto counterbalance this intellectual taxation. As soon as their school\r\ndays are over, dressing, visiting, evening parties, and stimulating\r\namusements, take the place of study, while the most unhealthful modes of\r\ndress add to the physical exposures. To make morning calls, or do a\r\nlittle shopping, is all that can be termed their exercise in the fresh\r\nair; and this, compared to what is needed, is absolutely nothing, and on\r\nsome accounts is worse than nothing.[B] In consequence of these, and\r\nother evils, which will be pointed out more at large in the following\r\npages, the young women of America grow up with such a delicacy of\r\nconstitution, that probably eight out of ten become subjects of disease,\r\neither before or as soon as they are called to the responsibilities of\r\ndomestic life.\r\n\r\nBut there is one peculiarity of situation, in regard to American women,\r\nwhich makes this delicacy of constitution still more disastrous. It is\r\nthe liability to the exposures and hardships of a newly-settled country.\r\n\r\nOne more extract from De Tocqueville will give a view of this part of\r\nthe subject, which any one, familiar with Western life, will admire for\r\nits verisimilitude.\r\n\r\n\"The same strength of purpose which the young wives of America display\r\nin bending themselves, at once, and without repining, to the austere\r\nduties of their new condition, is no less manifest in all the great\r\ntrials of their lives. In no country in the world, are private fortunes\r\nmore precarious, than in the United States. It is not uncommon for the\r\nsame man, in the course of his life, to rise and sink again through all\r\nthe grades which lead from opulence to poverty. American women support\r\nthese vicissitudes with a calm and unquenchable energy. It would seem\r\nthat their desires contract, as easily as they expand, with their\r\nfortunes. The greater part of the adventurers, who migrate, every year,\r\nto people the Western wilds, belong\" \"to the old Anglo-American race of\r\nthe Northern States. Many of these men, who rush so boldly onward in\r\npursuit of wealth, were already in the enjoyment of a competency in\r\ntheir own part of the Country. They take their wives along with them,\r\nand make them share the countless perils and privations, which always\r\nattend the commencement of these expeditions. I have often met, even on\r\nthe verge of the wilderness, with young women, who, after having been\r\nbrought up amid all the comforts of the large towns of New England, had\r\npassed, almost without any intermediate stage, from the wealthy abode of\r\ntheir parents, to a comfortless hovel in a forest. Fever, solitude, and\r\na tedious life, had not broken the springs of their courage. Their\r\nfeatures were impaired and faded, but their looks were firm: they\r\nappeared to be, at once, sad and resolute.\"\r\n\r\nIn another passage, he gives this picturesque sketch: \"By the side of\r\nthe hearth, sits a woman, with a baby on her lap. She nods to us,\r\nwithout disturbing herself. Like the pioneer, this woman is in the prime\r\nof life; her appearance would seem superior to her condition: and her\r\napparel even betrays a lingering taste for dress. But her delicate limbs\r\nappear shrunken; her features are drawn in; her eye is mild and\r\nmelancholy; her whole physiognomy bears marks of a degree of religious\r\nresignation, a deep quiet of all passion, and some sort of natural and\r\ntranquil firmness, ready to meet all the ills of life, without fearing\r\nand without braving them. Her children cluster about her, full of\r\nhealth, turbulence, and energy; they are true children of the\r\nwilderness: their mother watches them, from time to time, with mingled\r\nmelancholy and joy. To look at their strength, and her languor, one\r\nmight imagine that the life she had given them had exhausted her own;\r\nand still she regrets not what they have cost her. The house, inhabited\r\nby these emigrants, has no internal partition or loft. In the one\r\nchamber of which it consists, the whole family is gathered for the\r\nnight. The dwelling is itself a little world; an ark of civilization\r\namid an ocean of foliage. A hundred steps beyond it, the primeval forest\r\nspreads its shades, and solitude resumes its sway.\"\r\n\r\nSuch scenes, and such women, the writer has met, and few persons realize\r\nhow many refined and lovely women are scattered over the broad prairies\r\nand deep forests of the West; and none, but the Father above,\r\nappreciates the extent of those sacrifices and sufferings, and the value\r\nof that firm faith and religious hope, which live, in perennial bloom,\r\namid those vast solitudes. If the American women of the East merit the\r\npalm, for their skill and success as accomplished housekeepers, still\r\nmore is due to the heroines of the West, who, with such unyielding\r\nfortitude and cheerful endurance, attempt similar duties, amid so many\r\ndisadvantages and deprivations.\r\n\r\nBut, though American women have those elevated principles and feelings,\r\nwhich enable them to meet such trials in so exemplary a manner, their\r\nphysical energies are not equal to the exertions demanded. Though the\r\nmind may be bright and firm, the casket is shivered; though the spirit\r\nmay be willing, the flesh is weak. A woman of firm health, with the hope\r\nand elasticity of youth, may be envied rather than pitied, as she shares\r\nwith her young husband the hopes and enterprises of pioneer life. But,\r\nwhen the body fails, then the eye of hope grows dim, the heart sickens,\r\nthe courage dies; and, in solitude, weariness, and suffering, the\r\nwanderer pines for the dear voices and the tender sympathies of a far\r\ndistant home. Then it is, that the darkest shade is presented, which\r\nmarks the peculiar trials and liabilities of American women, and which\r\nexhibits still more forcibly the disastrous results of that delicacy of\r\nconstitution which has been pointed out. For, though all American women,\r\nor even the greater part of them, are not called to encounter such\r\ntrials, yet no mother, who rears a family of daughters, can say, that\r\nsuch a lot will not fall to one of her flock; nor can she know which\r\nwill escape. The reverses of fortune, and the chances of matrimony,\r\nexpose every woman in the Nation to such liabilities, for which she\r\nneeds to be prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[B] So little idea have most ladies, in the wealthier classes, of what\r\nis a proper amount of exercise, that, if they should succeed in walking\r\na mile or so, at a moderate pace, three or four times a week, they would\r\ncall it taking a great deal of exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR THE PRECEDING DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving pointed out the peculiar responsibilities of American women, and\r\nthe peculiar embarrassments which they are called to encounter, the\r\nfollowing suggestions are offered, as remedies for such difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the physical and domestic education of daughters\r\nshould occupy the principal attention of mothers, in childhood; and the\r\nstimulation of the intellect should be very much reduced. As a general\r\nrule, daughters should not be sent to school before they are six years\r\nold; and, when they are sent, far more attention should be paid to their\r\nphysical developement, than is usually done. They should never be\r\nconfined, at any employment, more than an hour at a time; and this\r\nconfinement should be followed by sports in the open air. Such\r\naccommodations should be secured, that, at all seasons, and in all\r\nweathers, the teacher can every half hour send out a portion of her\r\nschool, for sports. And still more care should be given to preserve pure\r\nair in the schoolroom. The close stoves, crowded condition, and\r\npoisonous air, of most schoolrooms, act as constant drains on the health\r\nand strength of young children.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, much less time should be given to school, and much\r\nmore to domestic employments, especially in the wealthier classes. A\r\nlittle girl may begin, at five or six years of age, to assist her\r\nmother; and, if properly trained, by the time she is ten, she can render\r\nessential aid. From this time, until she is fourteen or fifteen, it\r\nshould be the principal object of her education to secure a strong and\r\nhealthy constitution, and a thorough practical knowledge of all kinds of\r\ndomestic employments. During this period, though some attention ought to\r\nbe paid to intellectual culture, it ought to be made altogether\r\nsecondary in importance; and such a measure of study and intellectual\r\nexcitement, as is now demanded in our best female seminaries, ought\r\nnever to be allowed, until a young lady has passed the most critical\r\nperiod of her youth, and has a vigorous and healthful constitution fully\r\nestablished. The plan might be adopted, of having schools for young\r\ngirls kept only in the afternoon; that their mornings might be occupied\r\nin domestic exercise, without interfering with school employments. Where\r\na proper supply of domestic exercise cannot be afforded, the cultivation\r\nof flowers and fruits might be resorted to, as a delightful and\r\nunfailing promotive of pleasure and health.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to that class of mothers, who have the best means of securing\r\nhired service, and who are the most tempted to allow their daughters to\r\ngrow up with inactive habits, that their Country and the world must\r\nlook for a reformation, in this respect. Whatever ladies in the\r\nwealthier classes decide shall be fashionable, will be followed by all\r\nthe rest; but, while they persist in the aristocratic habits, now so\r\ncommon, and bring up their daughters to feel as if labor was degrading\r\nand unbecoming, the evils pointed out will never find a remedy. It is,\r\ntherefore, the peculiar duty of ladies, who have wealth, to set a proper\r\nexample, in this particular, and make it their first aim to secure a\r\nstrong and healthful constitution for their daughters, by active\r\ndomestic employments. All the sweeping, dusting, care of furniture and\r\nbeds, the clear starching, and the nice cooking, should be done by the\r\ndaughters of a family, and not by hired servants. It may cost the mother\r\nmore care, and she may find it needful to hire a person for the express\r\npurpose of instructing and superintending her daughters, in these\r\nemployments; but it should be regarded as indispensable to be secured,\r\neither by the mother's agency, or by a substitute.\r\n\r\nIt is in this point of view, that the dearth of good domestics in this\r\nCountry may, in its results, prove a substantial blessing. If all\r\nhousekeepers, who have the means, could secure good servants, there\r\nwould be little hope that so important a revolution, in the domestic\r\ncustoms of the wealthy classes, could be effected. And so great is the\r\nnatural indolence of mankind, that the amount of exercise, needful for\r\nhealth, will never be secured by those who are led to it through no\r\nnecessity, but merely from rational considerations. Yet the pressure of\r\ndomestic troubles, from the want of good domestics, has already\r\ndetermined many a mother, in the wealthy classes, to train her daughters\r\nto aid her in domestic service; and thus necessity is compelling mothers\r\nto do what abstract principles of expediency could never secure.\r\n\r\nA second method of promoting the same object, is, to raise the science\r\nand practice of Domestic Economy to its appropriate place, as a regular\r\nstudy in female seminaries. The succeeding chapter will present the\r\nreasons for this, more at large. But it is to the mothers of our\r\nCountry, that the community must look for this change. It cannot be\r\nexpected, that teachers, who have their attention chiefly absorbed by\r\nthe intellectual and moral interests of their pupils, should properly\r\nrealize the importance of this department of education. But if mothers\r\ngenerally become convinced of this, their judgement and wishes will meet\r\nthe respectful consideration they deserve, and the object will be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe third method of securing a remedy for the evils pointed out, is, the\r\nendowment of female institutions, under the care of suitable trustees,\r\nwho shall secure a proper course of education. The importance of this\r\nmeasure cannot be realized by those, who have not turned their attention\r\nto this subject; and for such, the following considerations are\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe endowment of colleges, and of law, medical, and divinity, schools,\r\nfor the other sex, is designed to secure a thorough and proper\r\neducation, for those who have the most important duties of society to\r\nperform. The men who are to expound the laws, the men who have the care\r\nof the public health, and the men who are to communicate religious\r\ninstruction, should have well-disciplined and well-informed minds; and\r\nit is mainly for this object that collegiate and professional\r\ninstitutions are established. Liberal and wealthy individuals contribute\r\nfunds, and the legislatures of the States also lend assistance, so that\r\nevery State in this Nation has from one to twenty such endowed\r\ninstitutions, supplied with buildings, apparatus, a library, and a\r\nfaculty of learned men to carry forward a superior course of\r\ninstruction. And the use of all these advantages is secured, in many\r\ncases, at an expense, no greater than is required to send a boy to a\r\ncommon school and pay his board there. No private school could offer\r\nthese advantages, without charging such a sum, as would forbid all but\r\nthe rich from securing its benefits. By furnishing such superior\r\nadvantages, on low terms, multitudes are properly educated, who would\r\notherwise remain in ignorance; and thus the professions are supplied,\r\nby men properly qualified for them.\r\n\r\nWere there no such institutions, and no regular and appropriate course\r\nof study demanded for admission to the bar, the pulpit, and to medical\r\npractice, the education of most professional men would be desultory,\r\nimperfect, and deficient. Parents and children would regulate the course\r\nof study according to their own crude notions; and, instead of having\r\ninstitutions which agree in carrying on a similar course of study, each\r\nschool would have its own peculiar system, and compete and conflict with\r\nevery other. Meantime, the public would have no means of deciding which\r\nwas best, nor any opportunity for learning when a professional man was\r\nproperly qualified for his duties. But as it is, the diploma of a\r\ncollege, and the license of an appointed body of judges, must both be\r\nsecured, before a young man feels that he has entered the most promising\r\npath to success in his profession.\r\n\r\nOur Country, then, is most abundantly supplied with endowed\r\ninstitutions, which secure a liberal education, on such low terms as\r\nmake them accessible to all classes, and in which the interests of\r\neducation are watched over, sustained, and made permanent, by an\r\nappropriate board of trustees.\r\n\r\nBut are not the most responsible of all duties committed to the charge\r\nof woman? Is it not her profession to take care of mind, body, and soul?\r\nand that, too, at the most critical of all periods of existence? And is\r\nit not as much a matter of public concern, that she should be properly\r\nqualified for her duties, as that ministers, lawyers, and physicians,\r\nshould be prepared for theirs? And is it not as important, to endow\r\ninstitutions which shall make a superior education accessible to all\r\nclasses,--for females, as for the other sex? And is it not equally\r\nimportant, that institutions for females be under the supervision of\r\nintelligent and responsible trustees, whose duty it shall be to secure a\r\nuniform and appropriate education for one sex as much as for the other?\r\nIt would seem as if every mind must accord an affirmative reply, as soon\r\nas the matter is fairly considered.\r\n\r\nAs the education of females is now conducted, any man or woman who\r\npleases, can establish a female seminary, and secure recommendations\r\nwhich will attract pupils. But whose business is it to see that these\r\nyoung females are not huddled into crowded rooms? or that they do not\r\nsleep in ill-ventilated chambers? or that they have healthful food? or\r\nthat they have the requisite amount of fresh air and exercise? or that\r\nthey pursue an appropriate and systematic course of study? or that their\r\nmanners, principles, and morals, are properly regulated? Parents either\r\nhave not the means, or else are not qualified to judge; or, if they are\r\nfurnished with means and capacity, they are often restricted to a choice\r\nof the best school within reach, even when it is known to be exceedingly\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nIf the writer were to disclose all that can truly be told of\r\nboarding-school life, and its influence on health, manners, disposition,\r\nintellect, and morals, the disclosure would both astonish and shock\r\nevery rational mind. And yet she believes that such institutions are far\r\nbetter managed in this Country, than in any other; and that the number\r\nof those, which are subject to imputations in these respects, is much\r\nless than could reasonably be expected. But it is most surely the case,\r\nthat much remains to be done, in order to supply such institutions as\r\nare needed for the proper education of American women.\r\n\r\nIn attempting a sketch of the kind of institutions which are demanded,\r\nit is very fortunate that there is no necessity for presenting a theory,\r\nwhich may, or may not, be approved by experience. It is the greatest\r\nhonor of one of our newest Western States, that it can boast of such an\r\nInstitution, endowed, too, wholly by the munificence of a single\r\nindividual. A slight sketch of this Institution, which the writer has\r\nexamined in all its details, will give an idea of what can be done, by\r\nshowing what has actually been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThis Institution[C] is under the supervision of a Board of Trustees, who\r\nhold the property in trust for the object to which it is devoted, and\r\nwho have the power to fill their own vacancies. It is furnished with a\r\nnoble and tasteful building, of stone, so liberal in dimensions and\r\narrangement, that it can accommodate ninety pupils and teachers, giving\r\none room to every two pupils, and all being so arranged, as to admit of\r\nthorough ventilation. This building is surrounded by extensive grounds,\r\nenclosed with handsome fences, where remains of the primeval forest\r\nstill offer refreshing shade for juvenile sports.\r\n\r\nTo secure adequate exercise for the pupils, two methods are adopted. By\r\nthe first, each young lady is required to spend a certain portion of\r\ntime in domestic employments, either in sweeping, dusting, setting and\r\nclearing tables, washing and ironing, or other household concerns.\r\n\r\nLet not the aristocratic mother and daughter express their dislike of\r\nsuch an arrangement, till they can learn how well it succeeds. Let them\r\nwalk, as the writer has done, through the large airy halls, kept clean\r\nand in order by their fair occupants, to the washing and ironing-rooms.\r\nThere they will see a long hall, conveniently fitted up with some thirty\r\nneatly-painted tubs, with a clean floor, and water conducted so as to\r\nsave both labor and slopping. Let them see some thirty or forty merry\r\ngirls, superintended by a motherly lady, chatting and singing, washing\r\nand starching, while every convenience is at hand, and every thing\r\naround is clean and comfortable. Two hours, thus employed, enable each\r\nyoung lady to wash the articles she used during the previous week, which\r\nis all that is demanded, while thus they are all practically initiated\r\ninto the arts and mysteries of the wash-tub. The Superintendent remarked\r\nto the writer, that, after a few weeks of probation, most of her young\r\nwashers succeeded quite as well as those whom she could hire, and who\r\nmade it their business. Adjacent to the washing-room, is the ironing\r\nestablishment; where another class are arranged, on the ironing-day,\r\naround long, extended tables, with heating-furnaces, clothes-frames, and\r\nall needful appliances.\r\n\r\nBy a systematic arrangement of school and domestic duties, a moderate\r\nportion of time, usually not exceeding two hours a day, from each of the\r\npupils, accomplished all the domestic labor of a family of ninety,\r\nexcept the cooking, which was done by two hired domestics. This part of\r\ndomestic labor it was deemed inexpedient to incorporate as a portion of\r\nthe business of the pupils, inasmuch as it could not be accommodated to\r\nthe arrangements of the school, and was in other respects objectionable.\r\n\r\nIs it asked, how can young ladies paint, play the piano, and study, when\r\ntheir hands and dresses must be unfitted by such drudgery? The woman who\r\nasks this question, has yet to learn that a pure and delicate skin is\r\nbetter secured by healthful exercise, than by any other method; and that\r\na young lady, who will spend two hours a day at the wash-tub, or with a\r\nbroom, is far more likely to have rosy cheeks, a finely-moulded form,\r\nand a delicate skin, than one who lolls all day in her parlor or\r\nchamber, or only leaves it, girt in tight dresses, to make fashionable\r\ncalls. It is true, that long-protracted daily labor hardens the hand,\r\nand unfits it for delicate employments; but the amount of labor needful\r\nfor health produces no such effect. As to dress, and appearance, if neat\r\nand convenient accommodations are furnished, there is no occasion for\r\nthe exposures which demand shabby dresses. A dark calico, genteelly\r\nmade, with an oiled-silk apron, and wide cuffs of the same material,\r\nsecures both good looks and good service. This plan of domestic\r\nemployments for the pupils in this Institution, not only secures regular\r\nhealthful exercise, but also aids to reduce the expenses of education,\r\nso that, with the help of the endowments, it is brought within the reach\r\nof many, who otherwise could never gain such advantages.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, a system of Calisthenic[D] exercises is introduced,\r\nwhich secures all the advantages which dancing is supposed to effect,\r\nand which is free from the dangerous tendencies of that fascinating and\r\nfashionable amusement. This system is so combined with music, and\r\nconstantly varying evolutions, as to serve as an amusement, and also as\r\na mode of curing distortions, particularly all tendencies to curvature\r\nof the spine; while, at the same time, it tends to promote grace of\r\nmovement, and easy manners.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of this Institution, is, an elevated and invigorating\r\ncourse of mental discipline. Many persons seem to suppose, that the\r\nchief object of an intellectual education is the acquisition of\r\nknowledge. But it will be found, that this is only a secondary object.\r\nThe formation of habits of investigation, of correct reasoning, of\r\npersevering attention, of regular system, of accurate analysis, and of\r\nvigorous mental action, is the primary object to be sought in preparing\r\nAmerican women for their arduous duties; duties which will demand not\r\nonly quickness of perception, but steadiness of purpose, regularity of\r\nsystem, and perseverance in action.\r\n\r\nIt is for such purposes, that the discipline of the Mathematics is so\r\nimportant an element in female education; and it is in this aspect,\r\nthat the mere acquisition of facts, and the attainment of\r\naccomplishments, should be made of altogether secondary account.\r\n\r\nIn the Institution here described, a systematic course of study is\r\nadopted, as in our colleges; designed to occupy three years. The\r\nfollowing slight outline of the course, will exhibit the liberal plan\r\nadopted in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn Mathematics, the whole of Arithmetic contained in the larger works\r\nused in schools, the whole of Euclid, and such portions from Day's\r\nMathematics as are requisite to enable the pupils to demonstrate the\r\nvarious problems in Olmsted's larger work on Natural Philosophy. In\r\nLanguage, besides English Grammar, a short course in Latin is required,\r\nsufficient to secure an understanding of the philosophy of the language,\r\nand that kind of mental discipline which the exercise of translating\r\naffords. In Philosophy, Chemistry, Astronomy, Botany, Geology and\r\nMineralogy, Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, Political Economy, and\r\nthe Evidences of Christianity, the same textbooks are used as are\r\nrequired at our best colleges. In Geography, the most thorough course is\r\nadopted; and in History, a more complete knowledge is secured, by means\r\nof charts and textbooks, than most of our colleges offer. To these\r\nbranches, are added Griscom's Physiology,[E] Bigelow's Technology, and\r\nJahn's Archaeology, together with a course of instruction in polite\r\nliterature, for which Chambers's English Literature is employed as the\r\ntext-book, each recitation being attended with selections and\r\ncriticisms, from teacher or pupils, on the various authors brought into\r\nnotice. Vocal Music, on the plan of the Boston Academy, is a part of the\r\ndaily instructions. Linear drawing, and pencilling, are designed also\r\nto be a part of the course. Instrumental Music is taught, but not as a\r\npart of the regular course of study.\r\n\r\nTo secure the proper instruction in all these branches, the division of\r\nlabor, adopted in colleges, is pursued. Each teacher has distinct\r\nbranches as her department, for which she is responsible, and in which\r\nshe is independent. One teacher performs the duties of a _governess_, in\r\nmaintaining rules, and attending to the habits and manners of the\r\npupils. By this method, the teachers have sufficient time, both to\r\nprepare themselves, and to impart instruction and illustration in the\r\nclass-room. In this Institution it is made a direct object of effort _to\r\ncure defects_ of _character and habits_. At the frequent meetings of the\r\nPrincipal and teachers, the peculiarities of each pupil are made the\r\nsubjects of inquiry; and methods are devised for remedying defects\r\nthrough the personal influence of the several teachers. This, when thus\r\nmade a direct object of combined effort, often secures results most\r\ngratifying and encouraging.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of this Institution demands consideration. By the method\r\nadopted here, the exclusive business of educating their own sex is, as\r\nit ever ought to be, confined to females. The Principal of the\r\nInstitution, indeed, is a gentleman; but, while he takes the position of\r\na father of the family, and responsible head of the whole concern, the\r\nentire charge of instruction, and most of the responsibilities in regard\r\nto health, morals, and manners, rest upon the female teachers, in their\r\nseveral departments. The Principal is the chaplain and religious\r\nteacher; and is a member of the board of instructors, so far as to have\r\na right to advise, and an equal vote, in every question pertaining to\r\nthe concerns of the School; and thus he acts as a sort of regulator and\r\nmainspring in all the various departments. But no one person in the\r\nInstitution is loaded with the excessive responsibilities, which rest\r\nupon one, where a large institution of this kind has a Principal, who\r\nemploys and directs all the subordinate assistants. The writer has\r\nnever before seen the principle of the division of labor and\r\nresponsibility so perfectly carried out in any female institution; and\r\nshe believes that experience will prove that this is the true model for\r\ncombining, in appropriate proportions, the agency of both sexes in\r\ncarrying forward such an institution. There are cases where females are\r\nwell qualified, and feel willing to take the place occupied by the\r\nPrincipal; but such cases are rare.\r\n\r\nOne thing more should be noticed, to the credit of the rising State\r\nwhere this Institution is located. A female association has been formed,\r\nembracing a large portion of the ladies of standing and wealth, the\r\ndesign of which, is, to educate, gratuitously, at this, and other\r\nsimilar, institutions, such females as are anxious to obtain a good\r\neducation, and are destitute of the means. If this enterprise is\r\ncontinued, with the same energy and perseverance as has been manifested\r\nduring the last few years, that State will take the lead of her sister\r\nStates in well-educated women; and if the views in the preceding pages\r\nare correct, this will give her precedence in every intellectual and\r\nmoral advantage.\r\n\r\nMany, who are not aware of the great economy secured by a proper\r\ndivision of labor, will not understand how so extensive a course can be\r\nproperly completed in three years. But in this Institution, none are\r\nreceived under fourteen; and a certain amount of previous acquisition is\r\nrequired, in order to admission, as is done in our colleges. This\r\nsecures a diminution of classes, so that but few studies are pursued at\r\none time; while the number of well-qualified teachers is so adequate,\r\nthat full time is afforded for all needful instruction and illustration.\r\nWhere teachers have so many classes, that they merely have time to find\r\nout what the pupils learn from books, without any aid from their\r\nteachers, the acquisitions of the pupils are vague and imperfect, and\r\nsoon pass away; so that an immense amount of expense, time, and labor,\r\nis spent in acquiring or recalling what is lost about as fast as it is\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nParents are little aware of the immense waste incurred by the present\r\nmode of conducting female education. In the wealthy classes, young girls\r\nare sent to school, as a matter of course, year after year, confined,\r\nfor six hours a day, to the schoolhouse, and required to add some time\r\nout of school to learning their lessons. Thus, during the most critical\r\nperiod of life, they are for a long time immured in a room, filled with\r\nan atmosphere vitiated by many breaths, and are constantly kept under\r\nsome sort of responsibility in regard to mental effort. Their studies\r\nare pursued at random, often changed with changing schools, while book\r\nafter book (heavily taxing the parent's purse) is conned awhile, and\r\nthen supplanted by others. Teachers have usually so many pupils, and\r\nsuch a variety of branches to teach, that little time can be afforded to\r\neach pupil; while scholars, at this thoughtless period of life, feeling\r\nsure of going to school as long as they please, manifest little interest\r\nin their pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that the actual amount of education, permanently\r\nsecured by most young ladies from the age of ten to fourteen, could all\r\nbe acquired in one year, at the Institution described, by a young lady\r\nat the age of fifteen or sixteen.\r\n\r\nInstead of such a course as the common one, if mothers would keep their\r\ndaughters as their domestic assistants, until they are fourteen,\r\nrequiring them to study one lesson, and go out, once a day, to recite it\r\nto a teacher, it would abundantly prepare them, after their\r\nconstitutions are firmly established, to enter such an institution,\r\nwhere, in three years, they could secure more, than almost any young\r\nlady in the Country now gains by giving the whole of her youth to school\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of female life, reading, writing, needlework,\r\ndrawing, and music, should alternate with domestic duties; and one hour\r\na day, devoted to some study, in addition to the above pursuits, would\r\nbe all that is needful to prepare them for a thorough education after\r\ngrowth is attained, and the constitution established. This is the time\r\nwhen young women would feel the value of an education, and pursue their\r\nstudies with that maturity of mind, and vividness of interest, which\r\nwould double the perpetuity and value of all their acquisitions.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty, which opposes such a plan, is, the want of\r\ninstitutions that would enable a young lady to complete, in three years,\r\nthe liberal course of study, here described. But if American mothers\r\nbecome convinced of the importance of such advantages for their\r\ndaughters, and will use their influence appropriately and efficiently,\r\nthey will certainly be furnished. There are other men of liberality and\r\nwealth, besides the individual referred to, who can be made to feel that\r\na fortune, expended in securing an appropriate education to American\r\nwomen, is as wisely bestowed, as in founding colleges for the other sex,\r\nwho are already so abundantly supplied. We ought to have institutions,\r\nsimilar to the one described, in every part of this Nation; and funds\r\nshould be provided, for educating young women destitute of means: and if\r\nAmerican women think and feel, that, by such a method, their own trials\r\nwill be lightened, and their daughters will secure a healthful\r\nconstitution and a thorough domestic and intellectual education, the\r\nappropriate expression of their wishes will secure the necessary funds.\r\nThe tide of charity, which has been so long flowing from the female hand\r\nto provide a liberal education for young men, will flow back with\r\nabundant remuneration.\r\n\r\nThe last method suggested for lessening the evils peculiar to American\r\nwomen, is, a decided effort to oppose the aristocratic feeling, that\r\nlabor is degrading; and to bring about the impression, that it is\r\nrefined and lady-like to engage in domestic pursuits. In past ages, and\r\nin aristocratic countries, leisure and indolence and frivolous pursuits\r\nhave been deemed lady-like and refined, because those classes, which\r\nwere most refined, countenanced such an opinion. But whenever ladies of\r\nrefinement, as a general custom, patronise domestic pursuits, then\r\nthese employments will be deemed lady-like. It may be urged, however,\r\nthat it is impossible for a woman who cooks, washes, and sweeps, to\r\nappear in the dress, or acquire the habits and manners, of a lady; that\r\nthe drudgery of the kitchen is dirty work, and that no one can appear\r\ndelicate and refined, while engaged in it. Now all this depends on\r\ncircumstances. If a woman has a house, destitute of neat and convenient\r\nfacilities; if she has no habits of order and system; if she is remiss\r\nand careless in person and dress;--then all this may be true. But, if a\r\nwoman will make some sacrifices of costly ornaments in her parlor, in\r\norder to make her kitchen neat and tasteful; if she will sacrifice\r\nexpensive dishes, in order to secure such conveniences for labor as\r\nprotect from exposures; if she will take pains to have the dresses, in\r\nwhich she works, made of suitable materials, and in good taste; if she\r\nwill rise early, and systematize and oversee the work of her family, so\r\nas to have it done thoroughly, neatly, and in the early part of the day;\r\nshe will find no necessity for any such apprehensions. It is because\r\nsuch work has generally been done by vulgar people, and in a vulgar way,\r\nthat we have such associations; and when ladies manage such things, as\r\nladies should, then such associations will be removed. There are\r\npursuits, deemed very refined and genteel, which involve quite as much\r\nexposure as kitchen employments. For example, to draw a large landscape,\r\nin colored crayons, would be deemed very lady-like; but the writer can\r\ntestify, from sad experience, that no cooking, washing, sweeping, or any\r\nother domestic duty, ever left such deplorable traces on hands, face,\r\nand dress, as this same lady-like pursuit. Such things depend entirely\r\non custom and associations; and every American woman, who values the\r\ninstitutions of her Country, and wishes to lend her influence in\r\nextending and perpetuating such blessings, may feel that she is doing\r\nthis, whenever, by her example and influence, she destroys the\r\naristocratic association, which would render domestic labor degrading.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] The writer omits the name of this Institution, lest an inference\r\nshould be drawn which would be unjust to other institutions. There are\r\nothers equally worthy of notice, and the writer selects this only\r\nbecause her attention was especially directed to it as being in a new\r\nState, and endowed wholly by an individual.\r\n\r\n[D] From two Greek words,--[Greek: kalos], _kalos_, beauty, and [Greek:\r\nsthenos], _sthenos_, strength, being the union of both. The writer is\r\nnow preparing for the press, an improved system, of her own invention,\r\nwhich, in _some_ of its parts, has been successfully introduced into\r\nseveral female seminaries, with advantage. This plan combines singing\r\nwith a great variety of amusing and graceful evolutions, designed to\r\npromote both health and easy manners.\r\n\r\n[E] This work, which has gone through numerous editions, and been\r\nreceived by the public with great favour, forms No. lxxxv. of the\r\n\"Family Library,\" and No. lvii. of the \"School District Library,\" issued\r\nby the publishers of this volume. It is abundantly illustrated by\r\nengravings, and has been extensively introduced as a school text-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON DOMESTIC ECONOMY AS A BRANCH OF STUDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest impediment to making Domestic Economy a branch of study,\r\nis, the fact, that neither parents nor teachers realize the importance,\r\nor the practicability of constituting it a regular part of school\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nIt is with reference to this, that the first aim of the writer will be,\r\nto point out some of the reasons for introducing Domestic Economy as a\r\nbranch of female education, to be studied at school.\r\n\r\nThe first reason, is, that there is no period, in a young lady's life,\r\nwhen she will not find such knowledge useful to herself and to others.\r\nThe state of domestic service, in this Country, is so precarious, that\r\nthere is scarcely a family, in the free States, of whom it can be\r\naffirmed, that neither sickness, discontent, nor love of change, will\r\ndeprive them of all their domestics, so that every female member of the\r\nfamily will be required to lend some aid, in providing food and the\r\nconveniences of living; and the better she is qualified to render it,\r\nthe happier she will be, and the more she will contribute to the\r\nenjoyment of others.\r\n\r\nA second reason, is, that every young lady, at the close of her\r\nschooldays, and even before they are closed, is liable to be placed in a\r\nsituation, in which she will need to do, herself, or to teach others to\r\ndo, all the various processes and duties detailed in this work. That\r\nthis may be more fully realized, the writer will detail some instances,\r\nwhich have come under her own observation.\r\n\r\nThe eldest daughter of a family returned from school, on a visit, at\r\nsixteen years of age. Before her vacation had closed, her mother was\r\nlaid in the grave; and such were her father's circumstances, that she\r\nwas obliged to assume the cares and duties of her lost parent. The care\r\nof an infant, the management of young children, the superintendence of\r\ndomestics, the charge of family expenses, the responsibility of\r\nentertaining company, and the many other cares of the family state, all\r\nat once came upon this young and inexperienced schoolgirl.\r\n\r\nAgain; a young lady went to reside with a married sister, in a distant\r\nState. While on this visit, the elder sister died, and there was no one\r\nbut this young lady to fill the vacant place, and assume all the cares\r\nof the nursery, parlor, and kitchen.\r\n\r\nAgain; a pupil of the writer, at the end of her schooldays, married, and\r\nremoved to the West. She was an entire novice in all domestic matters;\r\nan utter stranger in the place to which she removed. In a year, she\r\nbecame a mother, and _her health failed_; while, for most of the time,\r\nshe had no domestics, at all, or only Irish or Germans, who scarcely\r\nknew even the names, or the uses, of many cooking utensils. She was\r\ntreated with politeness by her neighbors, and wished to return their\r\ncivilities; but how could this young and delicate creature, who had\r\nspent all her life at school, or in visiting and amusement, take care of\r\nher infant, attend to her cooking, washing, ironing, and baking, the\r\nconcerns of her parlor, chambers, kitchen, and cellar, and yet visit and\r\nreceive company? If there is any thing that would make a kindly heart\r\nache, with sorrow and sympathy, it would be to see so young, so amiable,\r\nso helpless a martyr to the mistaken system of female education now\r\nprevalent. \"I have the kindest of husbands,\" said the young wife, after\r\nher narrative of sufferings, \"and I never regretted my marriage; but,\r\nsince this babe was born, I have never had a single waking hour of\r\nfreedom from anxiety and care. O! how little young girls know what is\r\nbefore them, when they enter married life!\" Let the mother or teacher,\r\nwhose eye may rest on these lines, ask herself, if there is no cause for\r\nfear that the young objects of her care may be thrown into similar\r\nemergencies, where they may need a kind of preparation, which as yet has\r\nbeen withheld.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for introducing such a subject, as a distinct branch of\r\nschool education, is, that, as a general fact, young ladies _will not_\r\nbe taught these things in any other way. In reply to the\r\nthousand-times-repeated remark, that girls must be taught their domestic\r\nduties by their mothers, at home, it may be inquired, in the first\r\nplace, What proportion of mothers are qualified to teach a _proper_ and\r\n_complete_ system of Domestic Economy? When this is answered, it may be\r\nasked, What proportion of those who are qualified, have that sense of\r\nthe importance of such instructions, and that energy and perseverance\r\nwhich would enable them actually to teach their daughters, in all the\r\nbranches of Domestic Economy presented in this work?\r\n\r\nIt may then be asked, How many mothers _actually do_ give their\r\ndaughters instruction in the various branches of Domestic Economy? Is it\r\nnot the case, that, owing to ill health, deficiency of domestics, and\r\nmultiplied cares and perplexities, a large portion of the most\r\nintelligent mothers, and those, too, who most realize the importance of\r\nthis instruction, actually cannot find the time, and have not the\r\nenergy, necessary to properly perform the duty? They are taxed to the\r\nfull amount of both their mental and physical energies, and cannot\r\nattempt any thing more. Almost every woman knows, that it is easier to\r\ndo the work, herself, than it is to teach an awkward and careless\r\nnovice; and the great majority of women, in this Country, are obliged to\r\ndo almost every thing in the shortest and easiest way. This is one\r\nreason why the daughters of very energetic and accomplished housekeepers\r\nare often the most deficient in these respects; while the daughters of\r\nignorant or inefficient mothers, driven to the exercise of their own\r\nenergies, often become the most systematic and expert.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that such things cannot be taught by books. This\r\nposition may fairly be questioned. Do not young ladies learn, from\r\nbooks, how to make hydrogen and oxygen? Do they not have pictures of\r\nfurnaces, alembics, and the various utensils employed in _cooking_ the\r\nchemical agents? Do they not study the various processes of mechanics,\r\nand learn to understand and to do many as difficult operations, as any\r\nthat belong to housekeeping? All these things are explained, studied,\r\nand recited in classes, when every one knows that little practical use\r\ncan ever be made of this knowledge. Why, then, should not that science\r\nand art, which a woman is to practise during her whole life, be studied\r\nand recited?\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, that, even if it is studied, it will soon be forgotten.\r\nAnd so will much of every thing studied at school. But why should that\r\nknowledge, most needful for daily comfort, most liable to be in demand,\r\nbe the only study omitted, because it may be forgotten?\r\n\r\nIt may also be objected, that young ladies can get such books, and\r\nattend to them out of school. And so they can get books on Chemistry and\r\nPhilosophy, and study them out of school; but _will_ they do it? And why\r\nought we not to make sure of the most necessary knowledge, and let the\r\nless needful be omitted? If young ladies study such a work as this, in\r\nschool, they will remember a great part of it; and, when they forget, in\r\nany emergency, they will know where to resort for instruction. But if\r\nsuch books are not put into schools, probably not one in twenty will see\r\nor hear of them, especially in those retired places where they are most\r\nneeded. And is it at all probable, that a branch, which is so lightly\r\nesteemed as to be deemed unworthy a place in the list of female studies,\r\nwill be sought for and learned by young girls, who so seldom look into\r\nworks of solid instruction after they leave school? So deeply is the\r\nwriter impressed with the importance of this, as a branch of female\r\neducation, at school, that she would deem it far safer and wiser to omit\r\nany other, rather than this.\r\n\r\nAnother reason, for introducing such a branch of study into female\r\nschools, is, the influence it would exert, in leading young ladies more\r\ncorrectly to estimate the importance and dignity of domestic knowledge.\r\nIt is now often the case, that young ladies rather pride themselves on\r\ntheir ignorance of such subjects; and seem to imagine that it is vulgar\r\nand ungenteel to know how to work. This is one of the relics of an\r\naristocratic state of society, which is fast passing away. Here, the\r\ntendency of every thing is to the equalisation of labor, so that all\r\nclasses are feeling, more and more, that indolence is disreputable. And\r\nthere are many mothers, among the best educated and most wealthy\r\nclasses, who are bringing up their daughters, not only to know how to\r\ndo, but actually to do, all kinds of domestic work. The writer knows\r\nyoung ladies, who are daughters of men of wealth and standing, and who\r\nare among the most accomplished in their sphere, who have for months\r\nbeen sent to work with a mantuamaker, to acquire a practical knowledge\r\nof her occupation, and who have at home learned to perform all kinds of\r\ndomestic labor.\r\n\r\nAnd let the young women of this Nation find, that Domestic Economy is\r\nplaced, in schools, on equal or superior ground to Chemistry,\r\nPhilosophy, and Mathematics, and they will blush to be found ignorant of\r\nits first principles, as much as they will to hesitate respecting the\r\nlaws of gravity, or the composition of the atmosphere. But, as matters\r\nare now conducted, many young ladies know how to make oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, and to discuss questions of Philosophy or Political Economy,\r\nfar better than they know how to make a bed and sweep a room properly;\r\nand they can \"construct a diagram\" in Geometry, with far more skill than\r\nthey can make the simplest article of female dress.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, that the plan suggested by the writer, in the previous\r\npages, would make such a book as this needless; for young ladies would\r\nlearn all these things at home, before they go to school. But it must be\r\nremembered, that the plan suggested cannot fully be carried into effect,\r\ntill such endowed institutions, as the one described, are universally\r\nfurnished. This probably will not be done, till at least one generation\r\nof young women are educated. It is only on the supposition that a young\r\nlady can, at fourteen or fifteen years of age, enter such an\r\ninstitution, and continue there three years, that it would be easy to\r\ninduce her to remain, during all the previous period, at home, in the\r\npractice of Domestic Economy, and the limited course of study pointed\r\nout. In the present imperfect, desultory, varying, mode of female\r\neducation, where studies are begun, changed, partially learned, and\r\nforgotten, it requires nearly all the years of a woman's youth, to\r\nacquire the intellectual education now demanded. While this state of\r\nthings continues, the only remedy is, to introduce Domestic Economy as a\r\nstudy at school.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that these considerations will have weight, not only with\r\nparents and teachers, but with young ladies themselves, and that all\r\nwill unite their influence to introduce this, as a popular and universal\r\nbranch of education, into every female school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no point, where a woman is more liable to suffer from a want of\r\nknowledge and experience, than in reference to the health of a family\r\ncommitted to her care. Many a young lady, who never had any charge of\r\nthe sick; who never took any care of an infant; who never obtained\r\ninformation on these subjects from books, or from the experience of\r\nothers; in short, with little or no preparation; has found herself the\r\nprincipal attendant in dangerous sickness, the chief nurse of a feeble\r\ninfant, and the responsible guardian of the health of a whole family.\r\n\r\nThe care, the fear, the perplexity, of a woman, suddenly called to\r\nthese unwonted duties, none can realize, till they themselves feel it,\r\nor till they see some young and anxious novice first attempting to meet\r\nsuch responsibilities. To a woman of age and experience, these duties\r\noften involve a measure of trial and difficulty, at times deemed almost\r\ninsupportable; how hard, then, must they press on the heart of the young\r\nand inexperienced!\r\n\r\nThere is no really efficacious mode of preparing a woman to take a\r\n_rational_ care of the health of a family, except by communicating that\r\nknowledge, in regard to the construction of the body, and the laws of\r\nhealth, which is the basis of the medical profession. Not that a woman\r\nshould undertake the minute and extensive investigation requisite for a\r\nphysician; but she should gain a general knowledge of first principles,\r\nas a guide to her judgement in emergencies when she can rely on no other\r\naid. Therefore, before attempting to give any specific directions on the\r\nsubject of this chapter, a short sketch of the construction of the human\r\nframe will be given, with a notice of some of the general principles, on\r\nwhich specific rules in regard to health are based. This description\r\nwill be arranged under the general heads of BONES, MUSCLES, NERVES,\r\nBLOOD-VESSELS, ORGANS OF DIGESTION AND RESPIRATION, and THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES.\r\n\r\nThe bones are the most solid parts of the body. They are designed to\r\nprotect and sustain it, and also to secure voluntary motion. They are\r\nabout two hundred and fifty in number, (there being sometimes a few more\r\nor less,) and are fastened together by cartilage, or gristle, a\r\nsubstance like the bones, but softer, and more elastic.\r\n\r\nIn order to convey a more clear and correct idea of the form, relative\r\nposition, and connection, of the bones constituting the human framework,\r\nthe engraving on page 70, (Fig. 1,) is given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nBy the preceding engraving, it will be seen, that the _cranium_, or\r\n_skull_, consists of several distinct pieces, which are united by\r\nsutures, (or seams,) as represented by the zigzag lines; _a_, being the\r\n_frontal bone_; _b_, the _parietal bone_; _c_, the _temporal bone_; and\r\n_d_, the place of the _occipital bone_, which forms the back part of the\r\nhead, and therefore is not seen in the engraving. The _nasal bones_, or\r\nbones of the nose, are shown at _e_; _f_, is the _cheek bone_; _g_, the\r\n_upper_, and _h_, the _lower, jaw bones_; _i_, _i_, the _spinal column_,\r\nor back bone, consisting of numerous small bones, called _vertebrae_;\r\n_j_, _j_, the seven _true ribs_, which are fastened to the spine,\r\nbehind, and by the _cartilages_, _k_, _k_, to the _sternum_, or _breast\r\nbone_, _l_, in front; _m_, _m_, are the first three _false ribs_, which\r\nare so called, because they are not united directly to the breast bone,\r\nbut by cartilages to the seventh true rib; _n_, _n_, are the lower two\r\n_false_, which are also called _floating, ribs_, because they are not\r\nconnected with the breast bone, nor the other ribs, in front; _o_, _o_,\r\n_p_, _q_, are the bones of the _pelvis_, which is the foundation on\r\nwhich the spine rests; _r_, _r_, are the _collar bones_; _s_, _s_, the\r\n_shoulder blades_; _t_, _t_, the bones of the _upper arm_; _u_, _u_, the\r\n_elbow joints_, where the bones of the upper arm and fore arm are united\r\nin such a way that they can move like a hinge; _v_ _w_, _v_ _w_, are the\r\nbones of the _fore arm_; _x_, _x_, those of the _wrists_; _y_, _y_,\r\nthose of the _fingers_; _z_, _z_, are the round heads of the thigh\r\nbones, where they are inserted into the sockets of the bones of the\r\npelvis, giving motion in every direction, and forming the _hip joint_; a\r\nb, a b, are the _thigh bones_; c, c, the _knee joints_; d e, d e, the\r\n_leg bones_; f, f, the _ankle joints_; g, g, the _bones of the foot_.\r\n\r\nThe bones are composed of two substances,--one animal, and the other\r\nmineral. The animal part is a very fine network, called the _cellular\r\nmembrane_. In this, are deposited the harder mineral substances, which\r\nare composed principally of carbonate and phosphate of lime. In very\r\nearly life, the bones consist chiefly of the animal part, and are then\r\nsoft and pliant. As the child advances in age, the bones grow harder, by\r\nthe gradual deposition of the phosphate of lime, which is supplied by\r\nthe food, and carried to the bones by the blood. In old age, the hardest\r\nmaterial preponderates; making the bones more brittle than in earlier\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAs we shall soon have occasion to refer, particularly, to the spinal, or\r\nvertebral column, and the derangement to which it is liable, we give, on\r\npage 72, representations of the different classes of vertebrae; viz. the\r\n_cervical_, (from the Latin, _cervix_, the neck,) the _dorsal_, (from\r\n_dorsum_, the back,) and _lumbar_, (from _lumbus_, the loins.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2, represents one of the _cervical vertebrae_. Seven of these,\r\nplaced one above another, constitute that part of the spine which is in\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3, is one of the _dorsal vertebrae_, twelve of which, form the\r\ncentral part of the spine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nFig. 4, represents one of the _lumbar vertebrae_, (five in number,)\r\nwhich are immediately above the sacrum. These vertebrae are so fastened,\r\nthat the spine can bend, in any direction; and the muscles of the trunk\r\nare used in holding it erect, or in varying its movements.\r\n\r\nBy the drawings here presented, it will be seen, that the vertebrae of\r\nthe neck, back, and loins, differ somewhat in size and shape, although\r\nthey all possess the same constituent parts; thus, A, in each,\r\nrepresents the body of the vertebrae; B, the articulating processes, by\r\nwhich each is joined to its fellow, above and below it; C, the spinous\r\nprocess, or that part of the vertebrae, which forms the ridge to be felt,\r\non pressure, the whole length of the centre of the back. The back bone\r\nreceives its name, _spine_, or _spinal column_, from these spinous\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIt is the universal law of the human frame, that _exercise_ is\r\nindispensable to the health of the several parts. Thus, if a\r\nblood-vessel be tied up, so as not to be used, it shrinks, and becomes a\r\nuseless string; if a muscle be condemned to inaction, it shrinks in\r\nsize, and diminishes in power; and thus it is also with the bones.\r\nInactivity produces softness, debility, and unfitness for the functions\r\nthey are designed to perform. This is one of the causes of the curvature\r\nof the spine, that common and pernicious defect in the females of\r\nAmerica. From inactivity, the bones of the spine become soft and\r\nyielding; and then, if the person is often placed, for a length of time,\r\nin positions that throw the weight of the body unequally on certain\r\nportions of the spine, they yield to this frequent compression, and a\r\ndistortion ensues. The positions taken by young persons, when learning\r\nto write or draw, or to play on the guitar, harp, or piano, and the\r\nposition of the body when sleeping on one side, on high pillows, all\r\ntend to produce this effect, by throwing the weight of the body\r\nunequally, and for a length of time, on particular parts of the spine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCLES.\r\n\r\nThe muscles are the chief organs of motion, and consist of collections\r\nof fine fibres or strings, united in casings of membrane or thin skin.\r\nThey possess an elastic power, like India rubber, which enables them to\r\nextend and contract. The red meat in animals consists of muscles. Every\r\nmuscle has connected with it nerves, veins, and arteries; and those\r\ndesigned to move the bones, are fastened to them by tendons at their\r\nextremities. The muscles are laid over each other, and are separated by\r\nmeans of membranes and layers of fat, which enable them to move easily,\r\nwithout interfering with each other.\r\n\r\nThe figure on page 74, represents the muscles of the arm, as they appear\r\nwhen the skin and fat are removed. The muscles _a_ and _b_ are attached,\r\nat their upper ends, to the bone of the arm, and by their lower ends to\r\nthe upper part of the fore arm, near the elbow joint. When the fibres of\r\nthese muscles contract, the middle part of them grows larger, and the\r\narm is bent at the elbow. The muscle _c_, is, in like manner, fastened,\r\nby its upper end, to the shoulder blade and the upper part of the arm,\r\nand by its lower end to one of the bones of the fore arm, near the\r\nelbow. When the arm is bent, and we wish to straighten it, it is done by\r\ncontracting this muscle. The muscles _d_, _d_, are fastened at one end\r\nnear the elbow joint, and at the other near the ends of the fingers; and\r\non the back of the hand are reduced in size, appearing like strong\r\ncords. These cords are called _tendons_. They are employed in\r\nstraightening the fingers, when the hand is shut. These tendons are\r\nconfined by the ligament or band, _e_, which binds them down, around the\r\nwrist, and thus enables them to act more efficiently, and secures beauty\r\nof form to the limb. The muscles at _f_, are those which enable us to\r\nturn the hand and arm outward. Every different motion of the arm has one\r\nmuscle to produce it, and another to restore the limb to its natural\r\nposition. Those muscles which bend the body are called _flexors_; those\r\nwhich straighten it, _extensors_. When the arm is thrown up, one set of\r\nmuscles is used; to pull it down, another set: when it is thrown\r\nforward, a still different set is used; when it is thrown back,\r\nanother, different from the former; when the arm turns in its socket,\r\nstill another set is used; and thus every different motion of the body\r\nis made by a different set of muscles. All these muscles are compactly\r\nand skilfully arranged, so as to work with perfect ease. Among them, run\r\nthe arteries, veins, and nerves, which supply each muscle with blood and\r\nnervous power, as will be hereafter described. The size and strength of\r\nthe muscles depend greatly on their frequent exercise. If left inactive,\r\nthey grow thin and weak, instead of giving the plumpness to the figure,\r\ndesigned by Nature. The delicate and feeble appearance of many American\r\nwomen, is chiefly owing to the little use they make of their muscles.\r\nMany a pale, puny, shad-shaped girl, would have become a plump, rosy,\r\nwell-formed person, if half the exercise, afforded to her brothers in\r\nthe open air, had been secured to her, during childhood and youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVES.\r\n\r\nThe nerves are the organs of sensation. They enable us to see, hear,\r\nfeel, taste, and smell; and also combine with the bones and muscles in\r\nproducing motion.\r\n\r\nThe first engraving, on p. 77, (Fig. 6,) is a vertical section of the\r\nskull, and of the spinal column, or back bone, which supports the head,\r\nand through which runs the spinal cord, whence most of the nerves\r\noriginate. It is a side view, and represents the head and spine, as they\r\nwould appear, if they were cut through the middle, from front to back.\r\nFig. 7, exhibits them as they would appear, if viewed from _behind_. In\r\nFig. 6, _a_, represents the _cerebrum_, or great brain; _b_, the\r\n_cerebellum_, or little brain, which is situated directly under the\r\ngreat brain, at the back and lower part of the head; _c_, _d_, _e_, is\r\nthe spinal marrow, which is connected with the brain at _c_, and runs\r\nthrough the whole length of the spinal column. This column consists, as\r\nhas already been stated, of a large number of small bones, _f_, _f_,\r\ncalled _vertebrae_, laid one above another, and fastened together by\r\n_cartilage_, or _gristle_, _g_, between them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nBetween each two vertebrae, or spinal bones, there issues from the\r\nspine, on each side, a pair of nerves. The lower broad part of the\r\nspine, (see _p_, Fig. 1, p. 70, and Fig. 7, p. 77,) is called the\r\n_sacrum_; in this, are eight holes, through which the lower pairs of\r\nnerves pass off.\r\n\r\nThe nerves of the head and lungs run directly from the brain; those of\r\nall other parts of the body proceed from the spine, passing out in the\r\nmanner already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe nerves which thus proceed from the spine, branch out, like the limbs\r\nand twigs of a tree, till they extend over the whole body; and, so\r\nminutely are they divided and arranged, that a point, destitute of a\r\nnerve, cannot be found on the skin.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the ramifications of the nerves, may be obtained by\r\nreference to the following engraving, (Fig. 8.) In this, A, A,\r\nrepresents the _cerebrum_, or great brain; B, B, the _cerebellum_, or\r\nlittle brain; (see also _a_, _b_, in Fig. 6;) C, C, represents the union\r\nof the fibres of the cerebrum; D, D, the union of the two sides of the\r\ncerebellum; E, E, E, the spinal marrow, which passes through the centre\r\nof the spine, (as seen at _c_, _d_, _e_, in Fig. 6;) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\r\nbranches of the nerves going to different parts of the body. As the\r\nnerves are the organs of sensation, all _pain_ is an affection of some\r\nportion of the nerves. The health of the nerves depends very greatly on\r\nthe exercise of the muscles, with which they are so intimately\r\nconnected. This shows the reason why the _headache_, _tic douloureux_,\r\ndiseases of the _spine_, and other nervous affections, are so common\r\namong American women. Their inactive habits, engender a debility of the\r\nnervous system, and these diseases follow, as the consequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nIt can be seen, by a reference to the side view, represented on page\r\n77, (Fig. 6,) that the spine is naturally curved back and forward.\r\nWhen, from want of exercise, its bones are softened, and the muscles\r\nweakened, the spine acquires an improper curve, and the person becomes\r\nwhat is called _crooked_, having the neck projected forward, and, in\r\nsome cases, having the back convex, where it should be concave. Probably\r\none half of the American women have the head thus projecting forward,\r\ninstead of carrying it in the natural, erect position, which is both\r\ngraceful and dignified.\r\n\r\nThe curvature of the spine, spoken of in this work as so common, and as\r\nthe cause of so many diseases among American women, is what is\r\ndenominated the _lateral curvature_, and is much more dangerous than the\r\nother distortion. The indications of this evil, are, the projection of\r\none shoulder blade more than the other, and, in bad cases, one shoulder\r\nbeing higher, and the hip on the opposite side more projecting, than the\r\nother. In this case, the spine, when viewed from behind, instead of\r\nrunning in a straight line, (as in Fig. 7 and 9,) is curved somewhat, as\r\nmay be seen in Figures 10 and 11.\r\n\r\nThis effect is occasioned by the softness of the bones, induced by want\r\nof exercise, together with tight dressing, which tends to weaken the\r\nmuscles that are thus thrown out of use. Improper and long continued\r\npositions in drawing, writing, and sleeping, which throw the weight of\r\nthe body on one part of the spine, induce the same evil. This distortion\r\nis usually accompanied with some consequent disease of the nervous\r\nsystem, or some disarrangement of the internal organs.\r\n\r\nBy comparing Figures 9 and 11, the difference between a natural and\r\ndistorted spine will be readily perceived. In Fig. 10, the curved line\r\nshows the course of the spine, occasioned by distortion; the\r\nperpendicular line, in this and Fig. 11, indicates the true direction of\r\nthe spine; the horizontal lines show that one shoulder and hip are\r\nforced from their proper level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD-VESSELS.\r\n\r\nThe blood is the fluid into which our food is changed, and which is\r\nemployed to minister nourishment to the whole body. For this purpose, it\r\nis carried to every part of the body, by the arteries; and, after it has\r\ngiven out its nourishment, returns to the heart, through the veins.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined engraving, (Fig. 12,) which presents a rude outline of the\r\nvascular system, will more clearly illustrate this operation, as we\r\nshall presently show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nBefore entering the heart, the blood receives a fresh supply of\r\nnourishment, by a duct which leads from the stomach. The arteries have\r\ntheir origin from the heart, in a great trunk, called the _aorta_, which\r\nis the parent of all the arteries, as the spinal marrow is the parent of\r\nthe nerves which it sends out. When the arteries have branched out into\r\nmyriads of minute vessels, the blood which is in them passes into as\r\nminute veins; and these run into each other, like the rills and branches\r\nof a river, until they are all united in two great veins, which run into\r\nthe heart. One of these large receivers, called the _vena cava\r\nsuperior_, or _upper vena cava_, brings back the blood from the arms and\r\nhead, the other, the _vena cava inferior_, or _lower vena cava_, brings\r\nback the blood from the body and lower limbs.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding figure, H, is the heart, which is divided into four\r\ncompartments; two, called _auricles_, used for receiving the blood, and\r\ntwo, called _ventricles_, used for sending out the blood. A, is the\r\n_aorta_, or great artery, which sends its branches to every part of the\r\nbody. In the upper part, at _a_, _a_, _a_, are the main branches of the\r\n_aorta_, which go to the head and arms. Below, at _a_, _a_, are the\r\nbranches which go to the lower limbs. The branches which set off at X,\r\nX, are those by which the intestines are supplied by vessels from the\r\n_aorta_. Every muscle in the whole body, all the organs of the body, and\r\nthe skin, are supplied by branches sent off from this great _artery_.\r\nWhen the blood is thus dispersed through any organ, in minute vessels,\r\nit is received, at their terminations, by numerous minute veins, which\r\ngradually unite, forming larger branches, till they all meet in either\r\nthe upper or lower _vena cava_, which returns the blood to the heart. V\r\nI, is the _vena cava inferior_, which receives the blood from the veins\r\nof the lower parts of the body, as seen at v, v. The blood, sent into\r\nthe lower limbs from the _aorta_, is received by minute veins, which\r\nfinally unite at v, v, and thus it is emptied through the lower _vena\r\ncava_ into the heart: _o_, _o_, represent the points of entrance of\r\nthose tributaries of the _vena cava_, which receive that blood from the\r\nintestines, which is sent out by the _aorta_ at X, X. In the upper part,\r\nV S, is the _vena cava superior_, which receives the blood from the head\r\nand arms; v, v, v, are the tributaries of the upper _vena cava_, which\r\nbring the blood back from the head and arms; _d_, _d_, represents the\r\ncourse of the _thoracic duct_, a delicate tube by which the chyle is\r\ncarried into the blood, as mentioned on page 89; _t_, shows the place\r\nwhere this duct empties into a branch of the _vena cava_.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that wherever a branch of the _aorta_ goes to carry\r\nblood, there will be found a tributary of the upper or lower _vena\r\ncava_, to bring it back.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding engravings, will enable the reader to form a more\r\ndefinite idea of this important function of the system,--the circulation\r\nof the blood. The heart, in man, and in all warm-blooded animals, is\r\ndouble, having two auricles and two ventricles. In animals with cold\r\nblood, (as fishes,) the heart is single, having but one auricle and one\r\nventricle. Fig. 13, represents the double heart as it appears when the\r\ntwo sides are separated, and also the great blood-vessels; those on the\r\nleft of the figure being on the right side of the body, and _vice\r\nversa_. The direction of the blood is represented by the arrows. A,\r\nrepresents the _lower vena cava_, returning the blood from the lower\r\nparts of the body, and L, the _upper vena cava_, returning the blood\r\nfrom the head and arms. B, is the _right sinus_, or _auricle_, into\r\nwhich the returned blood is poured. From this cavity of the heart, the\r\nblood is carried into the _right ventricle_, C; and from this ventricle,\r\nthe _pulmonary arteries_, D, convey into the lungs the blood which is\r\nreturned from the body. These five vessels, A, B, C, D, and L, belong to\r\nthe right side of the heart, and contain the venous or dark-colored\r\nblood, which has been through the circulation, and is now unfit for the\r\nuses of the system, till it has passed through the lungs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nWhen the blood reaches the lungs, and is exposed to the action of the\r\nair which we breathe, it throws off its impurities, becomes bright in\r\ncolor, and is then called arterial blood. It then returns to the left\r\nside of the heart, (on the right of the engraving,) by the pulmonary\r\nveins E, E, (also seen at _m_, _m_, Fig. 15,) into the left auricle F,\r\nwhence it is forced into the ventricle, G. From the left ventricle,\r\nproceeds the _aorta_, H, H, which is the great artery of the body, and\r\nconveys the blood to every part of the system. I, J, K, are branches of\r\nthe aorta, going to the head and arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nFig. 14, represents the heart, with its two sides united as in nature;\r\nand will be understood from the description of Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page, Fig. 15, represents the heart, with the great\r\nblood-vessels, on a still larger scale; _a_, being the _left ventricle_;\r\n_b_, the _right ventricle_; _c_, _e_, _f_, the _aorta_, or great artery,\r\nrising out of the left ventricle; _g_, _h_, _i_, the branches of the\r\naorta, going to the head and arms; _k_, _l_, _l_, the _pulmonary\r\nartery_, and its branches; _m_, _m_, _veins of the lungs_, which bring\r\nthe blood back from the lungs to the heart; _n_, _right auricle_; _o_,\r\n_vena cava inferior_; _p_, veins returning blood from the liver and\r\nbowels; _q_, the _vena cava superior_; _r_, the _left auricle_; _s_, the\r\nleft _coronary artery_, which distributes the blood exclusively to the\r\nsubstance of the heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANS OF DIGESTION AND RESPIRATION.\r\n\r\nDigestion and respiration are the processes, by which the food is\r\nconverted into blood for the nourishment of the body. The engraving on\r\nthe next page (Fig. 16) shows the organs by which these operations are\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the engraving, is the stomach, marked S, which\r\nreceives the food through the _gullet_, marked G. The latter, though in\r\nthe engraving it is cut off at G, in reality continues upwards to the\r\nthroat. The stomach is a bag composed of muscles, nerves, and\r\nblood-vessels, united by a material similar to that which forms the\r\nskin. As soon as food enters the stomach, its nerves are excited to\r\nperform their proper function of stimulating the muscles. A muscular\r\n(called the _peristaltic_) motion immediately commences, by which the\r\nstomach propels its contents around the whole of its circumference, once\r\nin every three minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nThis movement of the muscles attracts the blood from other parts of the\r\nsystem; for the blood always hastens to administer its supplies to any\r\norgan which is called to work. The blood-vessels of the stomach are soon\r\ndistended with blood, from which the _gastric juice_ is secreted by\r\nminute vessels in the coat of the stomach. This mixes with the food,\r\nand reduces it to a soft pulpy mass, called chyme. It then passes\r\nthrough the lower end of the stomach, into the intestines, which are\r\nfolded up in the abdomen, and the upper portion, only, of which, is\r\nshown in the engraving, at A, A. The organ marked L, L, is the liver,\r\nwhich, as the blood passes through its many vessels, secretes a\r\nsubstance called _bile_, which accumulates in the gall-bladder, marked\r\nB. After the food passes out of the stomach, it receives from the liver\r\na portion of bile, and from the _pancreas_ the _pancreatic juice_. The\r\npancreas does not appear in this drawing, being concealed behind the\r\nstomach. These two liquids separate the substance which has passed from\r\nthe stomach, into two different portions. One is a light liquid, very\r\nmuch like cream in appearance, and called _chyle_, of which the blood is\r\nformed; the other is a more solid substance, which contains the refuse\r\nand useless matter, with a smaller portion of nourishment; and this,\r\nafter being further separated from the nourishing matter which it\r\ncontains, is thrown out of the body. There are multitudes of small\r\nvessels, called _lacteals_, which, as these two mixed substances pass\r\nthrough the long and winding folds of the intestines in the abdomen,\r\nabsorb the chyle, and convey it to the _thoracic duct_, which runs up\r\nclose by the spine, and carries the chyle, thus received, into a branch\r\nof the _vena cava superior_, at _t_, whence it is mingled with the blood\r\ngoing into the heart. In this engraving, the _lacteals_ and _thoracic\r\nduct_ are not shown; but their position is indicated by the dotted\r\nlines, marked X, Y; X, being the lacteals, and Y, the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\nIn the upper half of the engraving, H represents the heart; _a_, the\r\ncommencement of the _aorta_; _v c s_, the termination of the _vena cava\r\nsuperior_. On each side of the heart, are the lungs; _l l_, being the\r\nleft lobe, and _r l_, the right lobe. They are composed of a network of\r\nair-vessels, blood-vessels, and nerves. W, represents the _trachea_, or\r\n_windpipe_, through which, the air we breathe is conducted to the lungs.\r\nIt branches out into myriads of minute vessels, which are thus filled\r\nwith air every time we breathe. From the heart, run the _pulmonary\r\narteries_, marked _p a_. These enter the lungs and spread out along-side\r\nof the branches of the air-vessels, so that every air-vessel has a small\r\nartery running side by side with it. When the two _vena cavas_ empty the\r\nblood into the heart, the latter contracts, and sends this blood,\r\nthrough these pulmonary arteries, into the lungs.\r\n\r\nAs the air and blood meander, side by side, through the lungs, the\r\nsuperabundant carbon and hydrogen of the blood combine with the oxygen\r\nof the air, forming carbonic acid gas, and water, which are thrown out\r\nof the lungs at every expiration. This is the process by which the chyle\r\nis converted into arterial blood, and the venous blood purified of its\r\nexcess of carbon and hydrogen. When the blood is thus prepared, in the\r\nlungs, for its duties, it is received by the small _pulmonary veins_,\r\nwhich gradually unite, and bring the blood back to the heart, through\r\nthe large _pulmonary veins_, marked _p v_, _p v_.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this purified blood from the lungs, the heart contracts,\r\nand sends it out again, through the _aorta_, to all parts of the body.\r\nIt then makes another circuit through every part, ministering to the\r\nwants of all, and is afterwards again brought back by the veins to\r\nreceive the fresh chyle from the stomach, and to be purified by the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nThe throbbing of the heart is caused by its alternate expansion and\r\ncontraction, as it receives and expels the blood. With one throb, the\r\nblood is sent from the right ventricle into the lungs, and from the left\r\nventricle into the aorta.\r\n\r\nEvery time we inspire air, the process of purifying the blood is going\r\non; and every time we expire the air, we throw out the redundant carbon\r\nand hydrogen, taken from a portion of the blood. If the waist is\r\ncompressed by tight clothing, a portion of the lungs be compressed, so\r\nthat the air-vessels cannot be filled. This prevents the perfect\r\npurification and preparation of the blood, so that a part returns back\r\nto the heart unfitted for its duties. This is a slow, but sure, method,\r\nby which the constitution of many a young lady is so undermined that she\r\nbecomes an early victim to disease and to the decay of beauty and\r\nstrength. The want of _pure air_ is another cause, of the debility of\r\nthe female constitution. When air has been rendered impure, by the\r\nbreath of several persons, or by close confinement, it does not purify\r\nthe blood properly. Sleeping in close chambers, and sitting in crowded\r\nand unventilated schoolrooms, are frequent causes of debility in the\r\nconstitution of young persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nThe skin is the covering of the body, and has very important functions\r\nto perform. It is more abundantly supplied with nerves and blood-vessels\r\nthan any other part; and there is no spot of the skin where the point of\r\nthe finest needle would not pierce a nerve and blood-vessel. Indeed, it\r\nmay be considered as composed chiefly of an interlacing of minute nerves\r\nand blood-vessels, so that it is supposed there is more nervous matter\r\nin the skin, than in all the rest of the body united, and that the\r\ngreater portion of the blood flows through the skin.\r\n\r\nThe whole animal system is in a state of continual change and\r\nrenovation. Food is constantly taken into the stomach, only a portion of\r\nwhich is fitted for the supply of the blood. All the rest has to be\r\nthrown out of the system, by various organs designed for this purpose.\r\nThese organs are,--the lungs, which throw off a portion of useless\r\nmatter when the blood is purified; the kidneys, which secrete liquids\r\nthat pass into the bladder, and are thrown out from the body by that\r\norgan; and the intestines, which carry off the useless and more solid\r\nparts of the food, after the lacteals have drawn off the chyle. In\r\naddition to these organs, the skin has a similar duty to perform; and as\r\nit has so much larger a supply of blood, it is the chief organ in\r\nrelieving the body of the useless and noxious parts of the materials\r\nwhich are taken for food.\r\n\r\nVarious experiments show, that not less than a pound and four ounces of\r\nwaste matter is thrown off by the skin every twenty-four hours. This is\r\naccording to the lowest calculation. Most of those, who have made\r\nexperiments to ascertain the quantity, represent it as much greater; and\r\nall agree, that the skin throws off more redundant matter from the body,\r\nthan the whole of the other organs together. In the ordinary state of\r\nthe skin, even when there is no apparent perspiration, it is constantly\r\nexhaling waste matter, in a form which is called _insensible\r\nperspiration_, because it cannot be perceived by the senses. A very cool\r\nmirror, brought suddenly near to the skin, will be covered, in that\r\npart, with a moisture, which is this effluvium thus made visible. When\r\nheat or exercise excites the skin, this perspiration is increased, so as\r\nto be apparent to the senses. This shows the reason why it is so\r\nimportant frequently to wash the entire surface of the body. If this be\r\nneglected, the pores of the skin are closed by the waste matter thrown\r\nfrom the body, and by small particles of the thin scarfskin, so that it\r\ncannot properly perform its duties. In this way, the other organs are\r\nmade to work harder, in order to perform the labor the skin would\r\notherwise accomplish, and thus the lungs and bowels are often\r\nessentially weakened.\r\n\r\nAnother office of the skin, is, to regulate the heat of the body. The\r\naction of the internal organs is constantly generating heat; and the\r\nfaster the blood circulates, the greater is the heat evolved. The\r\nperspiration of the skin serves to reduce and regulate this heat. For,\r\nwhenever any liquid changes to a vapor, it absorbs heat from whatever is\r\nnearest to it. The faster the blood flows, the more perspiration is\r\nevolved. This bedews the skin with a liquid, which the heat of the body\r\nturns to a vapor; and in this change, that heat is absorbed. When a\r\nfever takes place, this perspiration ceases, and the body is afflicted\r\nwith heat. Insensible perspiration is most abundant during sleep, after\r\neating, and when friction is applied to the skin. Perspiration is\r\nperformed by the terminations of minute arteries in every part of the\r\nskin, which exude the perspiration from the blood.\r\n\r\nThe skin also performs another function. It is provided with a set of\r\nsmall vessels, called _absorbents_, which are exceedingly abundant and\r\nminute. When particular substances are brought in contact with the skin,\r\nthese absorbents take up some portions and carry them into the blood. It\r\nis owing to this, that opium, applied on the skin, acts in a manner\r\nsimilar to its operation when taken into the stomach. The power of\r\nabsorption is increased by friction; and this is the reason that\r\nliniments are employed, with much rubbing, to bruises and sprains. The\r\nsubstance applied is thus introduced into the injured part, through the\r\nabsorbents. This shows another reason for frequent washing of the skin,\r\nand for the frequent changes of the garment next the skin. Otherwise\r\nportions of the noxious matter, thrown out by the skin, are reabsorbed\r\ninto the blood, and are slow but sure causes of a decay of the strength\r\nof the system.\r\n\r\nThe skin is also provided with small follicles, or bags, which are\r\nfilled with an oily substance. This, by gradually exuding over the skin,\r\nprevents water from penetrating and injuring its texture.\r\n\r\nThe skin is also the organ of touch. This office is performed through\r\nthe instrumentality of the nerves of feeling, which are spread over all\r\nparts of the skin.\r\n\r\nThis general outline of the construction of the human frame is given,\r\nwith reference to the practical application of this knowledge in the\r\nvarious cases where a woman will be called upon to exercise her own\r\nunaided judgement. The application will be further pointed out, in the\r\nchapters on Food, Dress, Cleanliness, Care of the Sick, and Care of\r\nInfants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nON HEALTHFUL FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person who decides what shall be the food and drink of a family, and\r\nthe modes of preparation, is the one who decides, to a greater or less\r\nextent, what shall be the health of that family. It is the opinion of\r\nmost medical men, that intemperance in eating is the most fruitful of\r\nall causes of disease and death. If this be so, the woman who wisely\r\nadapts the food and cooking of her family to the laws of health, removes\r\nthe greatest risk which threatens the lives of those under her care.\r\n\r\nTo exhibit this subject clearly, it will be needful to refer, more\r\nminutely, to the organization and operation of the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nIt is found, by experiment, that the supply of gastric juice, furnished\r\nfrom the blood, by the arteries of the stomach, is proportioned, not to\r\nthe amount of food put into the stomach, but to the wants of the body;\r\nso that it is possible to put much more into the stomach than can be\r\ndigested. To guide and regulate in this matter, the sensation called\r\n_hunger_ is provided. In a healthy state of the body, as soon as the\r\nblood has lost its nutritive supplies, the craving of hunger is felt,\r\nand then, if the food is suitable, and is taken in the proper manner,\r\nthis sensation ceases, as soon as the stomach has received enough to\r\nsupply the wants of the system. But our benevolent Creator, in this, as\r\nin our other duties, has connected enjoyment with the operation needful\r\nto sustain our bodies. In addition to the allaying of hunger, the\r\ngratification of the palate is secured, by the immense variety of food,\r\nsome articles of which are far more agreeable than others.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of Providence, designed for our happiness, has become,\r\neither through ignorance, or want of self-control, the chief cause of\r\nthe various diseases and sufferings, which afflict those classes who\r\nhave the means of seeking a variety to gratify the palate. If mankind\r\nhad only one article of food, and only water to drink, though they would\r\nhave less enjoyment in eating, they would never be tempted to put any\r\nmore into the stomach, than the calls of hunger required. But the\r\ncustoms of society, which present an incessant change, and a great\r\nvariety of food, with those various condiments which stimulate appetite,\r\nlead almost every person very frequently to eat merely to gratify the\r\npalate, after the stomach has been abundantly supplied, so that hunger\r\nhas ceased.\r\n\r\nWhen too great a supply of food is put into the stomach, the gastric\r\njuice dissolves only that portion which the wants of the system demand.\r\nThe remainder is ejected, in an unprepared state; the absorbents take\r\nportions of it into the system; and all the various functions of the\r\nbody, which depend on the ministries of the blood, are thus gradually\r\nand imperceptibly injured. Very often, intemperance in eating produces\r\nimmediate results, such as colic, headaches, pains of indigestion, and\r\nvertigo. But the more general result, is, a gradual undermining of all\r\nparts of the human frame; thus imperceptibly shortening life, by so\r\nweakening the constitution, that it is ready to yield, at every point,\r\nto any uncommon risk or exposure. Thousands and thousands are passing\r\nout of the world, from diseases occasioned by exposures, which a healthy\r\nconstitution could meet without any danger. It is owing to these\r\nconsiderations, that it becomes the duty of every woman, who has the\r\nresponsibility of providing food for a family, to avoid a variety of\r\ntempting dishes. It is a much safer rule, to have only one kind of\r\nhealthy food, for each meal, than the abundant variety which is usually\r\nmet at the tables of almost all classes in this Country. When there is\r\nto be any variety of dishes, they ought not to be successive, but so\r\narranged, as to give the opportunity of selection. How often is it the\r\ncase, that persons, by the appearance of a favorite article, are tempted\r\nto eat, merely to gratify the palate, when the stomach is already\r\nadequately supplied. All such intemperance wears on the constitution,\r\nand shortens life. It not unfrequently happens, that excess in eating\r\nproduces a morbid appetite, which must constantly be denied.\r\n\r\nBut the organization of the digestive organs demands, not only that food\r\nbe taken in proper quantities, but that it be taken at proper times.\r\n\r\nIt has before been shown, that, as soon as the food enters the stomach,\r\nthe muscles are excited by the nerves, and the _peristaltic motion_\r\ncommences. This is a powerful and constant exercise of the muscles of\r\nthe stomach, which continues until the process of digestion is complete.\r\nDuring this time, the blood is withdrawn from other parts of the system,\r\nto supply the demands of the stomach, which is laboring hard with all\r\nits muscles. When this motion ceases, and the digested food has\r\ngradually passed out of the stomach, Nature requires that it should have\r\na period of repose. And if another meal be eaten, immediately after one\r\nis digested, the stomach is set to work again, before it has had time to\r\nrest, and before a sufficient supply of gastric juice is provided.\r\n\r\nThe general rule, then, is, that three hours be given to the stomach for\r\nlabor, and two for rest; and in obedience to this, five hours, at least,\r\nought to elapse between every two regular meals. In cases where exercise\r\nproduces a flow of perspiration, more food is needed to supply the loss;\r\nand strong laboring men may safely eat as often as they feel the want of\r\nfood. So, young and healthy children, who gambol and exercise much, and\r\nwhose bodies grow fast, may have a more frequent supply of food. But, as\r\na general rule, meals should be five hours apart, and eating between\r\nmeals avoided. There is nothing more unsafe, and wearing to the\r\nconstitution, than a habit of eating at any time, merely to gratify the\r\npalate. When a tempting article is presented, every person should\r\nexercise sufficient self-denial, to wait till the proper time for eating\r\narrives. Children, as well as grown persons, are often injured, by\r\neating between their regular meals, thus weakening the stomach, by not\r\naffording it any time for rest.\r\n\r\nIn deciding as to _quantity_ of food, there is one great difficulty to\r\nbe met by a large portion of the community. It has been shown, that the\r\nexercise of every part of the body is indispensable to its health and\r\nperfection. The bones, the muscles, the nerves, the organs of digestion\r\nand respiration, and the skin, all demand exercise, in order properly to\r\nperform their functions. When the muscles of the body are called into\r\naction, all the blood-vessels entwined among them are frequently\r\ncompressed. As the arteries are so contrived, that the blood cannot run\r\nback, this compression hastens it forward, through the veins, towards\r\nthat organ. The heart is immediately put in quicker motion, to send it\r\ninto the lungs; and they, also, are thus stimulated to more rapid\r\naction, which is the cause of that panting which active exercise always\r\noccasions. The blood thus courses with greater celerity through the\r\nbody, and sooner loses its nourishing properties. Then the stomach\r\nissues its mandate of hunger, and a new supply of food must be\r\nfurnished. Thus it appears, as a general rule, that the quantity of\r\nfood, actually needed by the body, depends on the amount of muscular\r\nexercise taken. A laboring man, in the open fields, probably throws off\r\nfrom his skin ten times the amount of perspirable matter, which is\r\nevolved from the skin of a person of sedentary pursuits. In consequence\r\nof this, he demands a far greater amount of food and drink.\r\n\r\nThose persons, who keep their bodies in a state of health, by sufficient\r\nexercise, can always be guided by the calls of hunger. They can eat when\r\nthey feel hungry, and stop when hunger ceases; and then they will\r\ncalculate exactly right. But the difficulty is, that a large part of\r\nthe community, especially women, are so inactive in their habits, that\r\nthey seldom feel the calls of hunger. They habitually eat, merely to\r\ngratify the palate. This produces such a state of the system, that they\r\nhave lost the guide which Nature has provided. They are not called to\r\neat, by hunger, nor admonished, by its cessation, when to stop. In\r\nconsequence of this, such persons eat what pleases the palate, till they\r\nfeel no more inclination for the article. It is probable, that three\r\nfourths of the women, in the wealthier circles, sit down to each meal\r\nwithout any feeling of hunger, and eat merely on account of the\r\ngratification thus afforded them. Such persons find their appetite to\r\ndepend almost solely upon the kind of food on the table. This is not the\r\ncase with those, who take the exercise which Nature demands. They\r\napproach their meals in such a state that almost any kind of food is\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises, how are persons, who have lost the guide which\r\nNature has provided, to determine as to the proper amount of food they\r\nshall take?\r\n\r\nThe only rules they can adopt, are of a general nature; founded on the\r\nprinciples already developed. They should endeavor to proportion their\r\nfood to the amount of the exercise they ordinarily take. If they take\r\nbut little exercise, they should eat but little food in comparison with\r\nthose who are much in the open air and take much exercise; and their\r\nfood should be chiefly vegetable, and not animal. But how often is it\r\nseen, that a student, or a man who sits all day in an office, or a lady\r\nwho spends the day in her parlor and chamber, will sit down to a loaded\r\ntable, and, by continuing to partake of the tempting varieties, in the\r\nend load the stomach with a supply, which a stout farmer could scarcely\r\ndigest.\r\n\r\nBut the health of a family depends, not merely on the _quantity_ of food\r\ntaken; but very much, also, on the _quality_. Some kinds of food are\r\nvery pernicious in their nature, and some healthful articles are\r\nrendered very injurious by the mode of cooking. Persons who have a\r\nstrong constitution, and take much exercise, may eat almost any thing,\r\nwith apparent impunity; but young children, who are forming their\r\nconstitutions, and persons who are delicate, and who take but little\r\nexercise, are very dependent for health, on a proper selection of food.\r\n\r\nThere are some general principles, which may aid in regulating the\r\njudgement on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is found, that there are some kinds of food which afford nutriment to\r\nthe blood, and do not produce any other effect on the system. There are\r\nother kinds, which are not only nourishing, but _stimulating_, so that\r\nthey quicken the functions of the organs on which they operate. The\r\ncondiments used in cookery, such as pepper, mustard, and spices, are of\r\nthis nature. There are certain states of the system, when these\r\nstimulants are beneficial; but it is only in cases where there is some\r\ndebility. Such cases can only be pointed out by medical men. But persons\r\nin perfect health, and especially young children, never receive any\r\nbenefit from such kind of food; and just in proportion as condiments\r\noperate to quicken the labors of the internal organs, they tend to wear\r\ndown their powers. A person who thus keeps the body working under an\r\nunnatural excitement, _lives faster_ than Nature designed, and the\r\nsooner the constitution is worn out. A woman, therefore, should provide\r\ndishes for her family, which are free from these stimulating condiments,\r\nand as much as possible prevent their use. It is also found, by\r\nexperience, that animal food is more stimulating than vegetable. This is\r\nthe reason why, in cases of fevers, or inflammations, medical men forbid\r\nthe use of meat and butter. Animal food supplies chyle much more\r\nabundantly than vegetable food does; and this chyle is more stimulating\r\nin its nature. Of course, a person who lives chiefly on animal food, is\r\nunder a higher degree of stimulus than if his food was chiefly composed\r\nof vegetable substances. His blood will flow faster, and all the\r\nfunctions of his body will be quickened.\r\n\r\nThis makes it important to secure a proper proportion of animal and\r\nvegetable diet. Some medical men suppose, that an exclusively vegetable\r\ndiet is proved, by the experience of many individuals, to be fully\r\nsufficient to nourish the body; and bring, as evidence, the fact, that\r\nsome of the strongest and most robust men in the world, are those, who\r\nare trained, from infancy, exclusively on vegetable food. From this,\r\nthey infer, that life will be shortened, just in proportion as the diet\r\nis changed to more stimulating articles; and that, all other things\r\nbeing equal, children will have a better chance of health and long life,\r\nif they are brought up solely on vegetable food.\r\n\r\nBut, though this is not the common opinion of medical men, they all\r\nagree, that, in America, far too large a portion of the diet consists of\r\nanimal food. As a nation, the Americans are proverbial for the gross and\r\nluxurious diet with which they load their tables; and there can be no\r\ndoubt that the general health of the Nation would be increased, by a\r\nchange in our customs in this respect. To take meat but once a day, and\r\nthis in small quantities, compared with the common practice, is a rule,\r\nthe observance of which would probably greatly reduce the amount of\r\nfevers, eruptions, headaches, bilious attacks, and the many other\r\nailments which are produced or aggravated by too gross a diet.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Roman physician, Baglivi, (who, from practising\r\nextensively among Roman Catholics, had ample opportunities to observe,)\r\nmentions, that, in Italy, an unusual number of people recover their\r\nhealth in the forty days of Lent, in consequence of the lower diet which\r\nis required as a religious duty. An American physician remarks, \"For\r\nevery reeling drunkard that disgraces our Country, it contains one\r\nhundred gluttons;--persons, I mean, who eat to excess, and suffer in\r\nconsequence.\" Another distinguished physician says, \"I believe that\r\nevery stomach, not actually impaired by organic disease, will perform\r\nits functions, if it receives reasonable attention; and when we perceive\r\nthe manner in which diet is generally conducted, both in regard to\r\n_quantity_ and _variety_ of articles of food and drink, which are mixed\r\nup in one heterogeneous mass,--instead of being astonished at the\r\nprevalence of indigestion, our wonder must rather be, that, in such\r\ncircumstances, any stomach is capable of digesting at all.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to articles which are the most easily digested, only general\r\nrules can be given. Tender meats are digested more readily than those\r\nwhich are tough, or than many kinds of vegetable food. The farinaceous\r\narticles, such as rice, flour, corn, potatoes, and the like, are the\r\nmost nutritious, and most easily digested. The popular notion, that meat\r\nis more nourishing than bread, is a great mistake. Good bread contains\r\none third more nourishment than butcher's meat. The meat is more\r\n_stimulating_, and for this reason is more readily digested. A perfectly\r\nhealthy stomach can digest almost any healthful food; but when the\r\ndigestive powers are weak, every stomach has its peculiarities, and what\r\nis good for one, is hurtful to another. In such cases, experiment,\r\nalone, can decide, which are the most digestible articles of food. A\r\nperson, whose food troubles him, must deduct one article after another,\r\ntill he learns, by experience, which is the best for digestion. Much\r\nevil has been done, by assuming that the powers of one stomach are to be\r\nmade the rule in regulating every other.\r\n\r\nThe most unhealthful kinds of food, are those, which are made so by bad\r\ncooking; such as sour and heavy bread, cakes, pie-crust, and other\r\ndishes consisting of fat, mixed and cooked with flour; also rancid\r\nbutter, and high-seasoned food. The fewer mixtures there are in cooking,\r\nthe more healthful is the food likely to be.\r\n\r\nThere is one caution, as to the _mode_ of eating, which seems peculiarly\r\nneedful to Americans. It is indispensable to good digestion, that food\r\nbe well chewed and taken slowly. It needs to be thoroughly chewed, in\r\norder to prepare it for the action of the gastric juice, which, by the\r\n_peristaltic motion_, will be thus brought into universal contact with\r\nthe minute portions. It has been found, that a solid lump of food\r\nrequires much more time and labor of the stomach, than divided\r\nsubstances. It has also been found, that, as each bolus, or mouthful,\r\nenters the stomach, the latter closes, until the portion received has\r\nhad some time to move around and combine with the gastric juice; and\r\nthat the orifice of the stomach resists the entrance of any more, till\r\nthis is accomplished. But, if the eater persists in swallowing fast, the\r\nstomach yields; the food is then poured in more rapidly than the organ\r\ncan perform its duty of digestion; and evil results are sooner or later\r\ndeveloped. This exhibits the folly of those hasty meals, so common to\r\ntravellers, and to men of business, and shows why children should be\r\ntaught to eat slowly.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a full meal, it is very important to health, that no great\r\nbodily or mental exertion be made, till the labor of the stomach is\r\nover. Intense mental effort draws the blood to the head, and muscular\r\nexertions draw it to the muscles; and in consequence of this, the\r\nstomach loses the supply which it requires when performing its office.\r\nWhen the blood is thus withdrawn, the adequate supply of gastric juice\r\nis not afforded, and indigestion is the result. The heaviness which\r\nfollows a full meal, is the indication which Nature gives of the need of\r\nquiet. When the meal is moderate, a sufficient quantity of gastric juice\r\nis exuded in an hour, or an hour and a half; after which, labor of body\r\nand mind may safely be resumed.\r\n\r\nWhen undigested food remains in the stomach, and is at last thrown out\r\ninto the bowels, it proves an irritating substance, producing an\r\ninflamed state in the lining of the stomach and other organs. The same\r\neffect is produced by alcoholic drinks.\r\n\r\nIt is found, that the stomach has the power of gradually accommodating\r\nits digestive powers to the food it habitually receives. Thus, animals,\r\nwhich live on vegetables, can gradually become accustomed to animal\r\nfood; and the reverse is equally true. Thus, too, the human stomach can\r\neventually accomplish the digestion of some kinds of food, which, at\r\nfirst, were indigestible.\r\n\r\nBut any changes of this sort should be gradual; as those which are\r\n_sudden_, are trying to the powers of the stomach, by furnishing matter\r\nfor which its gastric juice is not prepared.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the nature of the meals prepared, the breakfast should\r\nfurnish a supply of liquids, because the body has been exhausted by the\r\nexhalations of the night, and demands them more than at any other\r\nperiod. It should not be the heartiest meal, because the organs of\r\ndigestion are weakened by long fasting, and the exhalations. Dinner\r\nshould be the heartiest meal, because then the powers of digestion are\r\nstrengthened, by the supplies of the morning meal. Light and amusing\r\nemployments should occupy mind and body for an hour or more after a full\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nBut little drink should be taken, while eating, as it dilutes the\r\ngastric juice which is apportioned to each quantity of food as it enters\r\nthe stomach. It is better to take drink after the meal is past.\r\n\r\nExtremes of heat or cold are injurious to the process of digestion.\r\nTaking hot food or drink, habitually, tends to debilitate all the organs\r\nthus needlessly excited. In using cold substances, it is found that a\r\ncertain degree of warmth in the stomach is indispensable to their\r\ndigestion; so that, when the gastric juice is cooled below this\r\ntemperature, it ceases to act. Indulging in large quantities of cold\r\ndrinks, or eating ice-creams, after a meal, tends to reduce the\r\ntemperature of the stomach, and thus to stop digestion. This shows the\r\nfolly of those refreshments, in convivial meetings, where the guests are\r\ntempted to load the stomach with a variety, such as would require the\r\nstomach of a stout farmer to digest, and then to wind up with\r\nice-creams, thus destroying whatever ability might otherwise have\r\nexisted, to digest the heavy load. The fittest temperature for drinks,\r\nif taken when the food is in the digesting process, is blood heat. Cool\r\ndrinks, and even ice, can be safely taken at other times, if not in\r\nexcessive quantity. When the thirst is excessive, or the body weakened\r\nby fatigue, or when in a state of perspiration, cold drinks are\r\ninjurious. When the body is perspiring freely, taking a large quantity\r\nof cold drink has often produced instant death.\r\n\r\nFluids taken into the stomach are not subject to the slow process of\r\ndigestion, but are immediately absorbed and carried into the blood. This\r\nis the reason why drink, more speedily than food, restores from\r\nexhaustion. The minute vessels of the stomach inhale or absorb its\r\nfluids, which are carried into the blood, just as the minute extremities\r\nof the arteries open upon the inner surface of the stomach, and there\r\nexude the gastric juice from the blood.\r\n\r\nWhen food is chiefly liquid, (soup, for example,) the fluid part is\r\nrapidly absorbed. The solid parts remain, to be acted on by the gastric\r\njuice. In the case of St. Martin,[F] in fifty minutes after taking soup,\r\nthe fluids were absorbed, and the remainder was even thicker than is\r\nusual after eating solid food. This is the reason why soups are deemed\r\nbad for weak stomachs; as this residuum is more difficult of digestion\r\nthan ordinary food. In recovering from sickness, beef-tea and broths are\r\ngood, because the system then demands fluids to supply its loss of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nHighly-concentrated food, having much nourishment in a small bulk, is\r\nnot favorable to digestion, because it cannot be properly acted on by\r\nthe muscular contractions of the stomach, and is not so minutely\r\ndivided, as to enable the gastric juice to act properly. This is the\r\nreason, why a certain _bulk_ of food is needful to good digestion; and\r\nwhy those people, who live on whale oil, and other highly-nourishing\r\nfood, in cold climates, mix vegetables and even sawdust with it, to make\r\nit more acceptable and digestible. So, in civilized lands, bread,\r\npotatoes, and vegetables, are mixed with more highly-concentrated\r\nnourishment. This explains why coarse bread, of unbolted wheat, so often\r\nproves beneficial. Where, from inactive habits, or other causes, the\r\nbowels become constipated and sluggish, this kind of food proves the\r\nappropriate remedy. One fact on this subject is worthy of notice. Under\r\nthe administration of William Pitt, for two years or more, there was\r\nsuch a scarcity of wheat, that, to make it hold out longer, Parliament\r\npassed a law, that the army should have all their bread made of unbolted\r\nflour. The result was, that the health of the soldiers improved so much,\r\nas to be a subject of surprise to themselves, the officers, and the\r\nphysicians. These last came out publicly, and declared, that the\r\nsoldiers never before were so robust and healthy; and that disease had\r\nnearly disappeared from the army. The civic physicians joined and\r\npronounced it the healthiest bread; and, for a time, schools, families,\r\nand public institutions, used it almost exclusively. Even the nobility,\r\nconvinced by these facts, adopted it for their common diet; and the\r\nfashion continued a long time after the scarcity ceased, until more\r\nluxurious habits resumed their sway. For this reason, also, soups,\r\ngellies, and arrow-root, should have bread or crackers mixed with them.\r\nWe thus see why children should not have cakes and candies allowed them\r\nbetween meals. These are highly-concentrated nourishments, and should be\r\neaten with more bulky and less nourishing substances. The most\r\nindigestible of all kinds of food, are fatty and oily substances;\r\nespecially if heated. It is on this account, that pie-crust, and\r\narticles boiled and fried in fat or butter, are deemed not so healthful\r\nas other food.\r\n\r\nThe following, then, may be put down as the causes of a debilitated\r\nconstitution, from the misuse of food. Eating _too much_, eating _too\r\noften_, eating _too fast_, eating food and condiments that are _too\r\nstimulating_, eating food that is _too warm_ or _too cold_, eating food\r\nthat is _highly-concentrated_, without a proper admixture of less\r\nnourishing matter, and eating food that is _difficult of digestion_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[F] The individual here referred to,--Alexis St. Martin,--was a young\r\nCanadian, of eighteen years of age, of a good constitution, and robust\r\nhealth, who, in 1822, was accidentally wounded by the discharge of a\r\nmusket, which carried away a part of the ribs, lacerated one of the\r\nlobes of the lungs, and perforated the stomach, making a large aperture,\r\nwhich never closed; and which enabled Dr. Beaumont, (a surgeon of the\r\nAmerican army, stationed at Michilimackinac, under whose care the\r\npatient was placed,) to witness all the processes of digestion and other\r\nfunctions of the body, for several years. The published account of the\r\nexperiments made by Dr. B., is highly interesting and instructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nON HEALTHFUL DRINKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough intemperance in eating is probably the most prolific cause of\r\nthe diseases of mankind, intemperance in drink has produced more guilt,\r\nmisery, and crime, than any other one cause. And the responsibilities of\r\na woman, in this particular, are very great; for the habits and\r\nliabilities of those under her care, will very much depend on her\r\nopinions and practice.\r\n\r\nIt is a point fully established by experience, that the full\r\ndevelopement of the human body, and the vigorous exercise of all its\r\nfunctions, can be secured without the use of stimulating drinks. It is,\r\ntherefore, perfectly safe, to bring up children never to use them; no\r\nhazard being incurred, by such a course.\r\n\r\nIt is also found, by experience, that there are two evils incurred, by\r\nthe use of stimulating drinks. The first, is, their positive effect on\r\nthe human system. Their peculiarity consists in so exciting the nervous\r\nsystem, that all the functions of the body are accelerated, and the\r\nfluids are caused to move quicker than at their natural speed. This\r\nincreased motion of the animal fluids, always produces an agreeable\r\neffect on the mind. The intellect is invigorated, the imagination is\r\nexcited, the spirits are enlivened; and these effects are so agreeable,\r\nthat all mankind, after having once experienced them, feel a great\r\ndesire for their repetition.\r\n\r\nBut this temporary invigoration of the system, is always followed by a\r\ndiminution of the powers of the stimulated organs; so that, though in\r\nall cases this reaction may not be perceptible, it is invariably the\r\nresult. It may be set down as the unchangeable rule of physiology, that\r\nstimulating drinks (except in cases of disease) deduct from the powers\r\nof the constitution, in exactly the proportion in which they operate to\r\nproduce temporary invigoration.\r\n\r\nThe second evil, is, the temptation which always attends the use of\r\nstimulants. Their effect on the system is so agreeable, and the evils\r\nresulting are so imperceptible and distant, that there is a constant\r\ntendency to increase such excitement, both in frequency and power. And\r\nthe more the system is thus reduced in strength, the more craving is the\r\ndesire for that which imparts a temporary invigoration. This process of\r\nincreasing debility and increasing craving for the stimulus that removes\r\nit, often goes to such an extreme, that the passion is perfectly\r\nuncontrollable, and mind and body perish under this baleful habit.\r\n\r\nIn this Country, there are five forms in which the use of such\r\nstimulants is common; namely, _alcoholic drinks_, _tea_, _coffee_,\r\n_opium mixtures_, and _tobacco_. These are all alike, in the main\r\npeculiarity of imparting that extra stimulus to the system, which tends\r\nto exhaust its powers.\r\n\r\nMultitudes in this Nation are in the habitual use of some one of these\r\nstimulants; and each person defends the indulgence by these arguments:\r\n\r\nFirst, that the desire for stimulants is a natural propensity, implanted\r\nin man's nature, as is manifest from the universal tendency to such\r\nindulgences, in every nation. From this, it is inferred, that it is an\r\ninnocent desire, which ought to be gratified, to some extent, and that\r\nthe aim should be, to keep it within the limits of temperance, instead\r\nof attempting to exterminate a natural propensity.\r\n\r\nThis is an argument, which, if true, makes it equally proper to use\r\nopium, brandy, tea, or tobacco, as stimulating principles, provided they\r\nare used temperately. But, if it be granted that perfect health and\r\nstrength can be gained and secured without these stimulants, and that\r\ntheir peculiar effect is to diminish the power of the system, in exactly\r\nthe same proportion as they stimulate it, then there is no such thing as\r\na temperate use, unless they are so diluted, as to destroy any\r\nstimulating power; and in this form, they are seldom desired.\r\n\r\nThe other argument for their use, is, that they are among the good\r\nthings provided by the Creator, for our gratification; that, like all\r\nother blessings, they are exposed to abuse and excess; and that we\r\nshould rather seek to regulate their use, than to banish them entirely.\r\n\r\nThis argument is based on the assumption, that they are, like healthful\r\nfoods and drinks, necessary to life and health, and injurious only by\r\nexcess. But this is not true; for, whenever they are used in any such\r\nstrength as to be a gratification, they operate, to a greater or less\r\nextent, as stimulants; and, to just such extent, they wear out the\r\npowers of the constitution; and it is abundantly proved, that they are\r\nnot, like food and drink, necessary to health. Such articles are\r\ndesigned for medicine, and not for common use. There can be no argument\r\nframed to defend the use of one of them, which will not equally defend\r\nall. That men have a love for being stimulated, after they have once\r\nfelt the pleasurable excitement, and that Providence has provided the\r\nmeans for securing it, are arguments as much in favor of alcohol, opium,\r\nand tobacco, as of coffee and tea. All that can be said in favor of the\r\nlast-mentioned favorite beverages, is, that the danger in their use is\r\nnot so great. Let any one, who defends one kind of stimulating drink,\r\nremember, then, that he uses an argument, which, if it be allowed that\r\nstimulants are not needed, and are injurious, will equally defend all\r\nkinds; and that all which can be said in defence of tea and coffee, is,\r\nthat they _may_ be used, so weak, as to do no harm, and that they\r\nactually have done less harm than some of the other stimulating\r\nnarcotics.\r\n\r\nThe writer is of opinion, that tea and coffee are a most extensive cause\r\nof much of the nervous debility and suffering endured by American women;\r\nand that relinquishing such drinks would save an immense amount of such\r\nsuffering. But there is little probability that the present generation\r\nwill make so decided a change in their habits, as to give up these\r\nbeverages; and the subject is presented rather in reference to forming\r\nthe habits of children.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, that tea and coffee are, at first, seldom or never\r\nagreeable to children. It is the mixture of milk, sugar, and water, that\r\nreconciles them to a taste, which in this manner gradually becomes\r\nagreeable. Now, suppose that those who provide for a family conclude\r\nthat it is not _their_ duty to give up entirely the use of stimulating\r\ndrinks, may not the case appear different, in regard to teaching their\r\nchildren to love such drinks? Let the matter be regarded thus:--The\r\nexperiments of physiologists all prove, that stimulants are not needful\r\nto health, and that, as the general rule, they tend to debilitate the\r\nconstitution. Is it right, then, for a parent to tempt a child to drink\r\nwhat is not needful, when there is a probability that it will prove, to\r\nsome extent, an undermining drain on the constitution? Some\r\nconstitutions can bear much less excitement than others; and, in every\r\nfamily of children, there is usually one, or more, of delicate\r\norganization, and consequently peculiarly exposed to dangers from this\r\nsource. It is this child who ordinarily becomes the victim to\r\nstimulating drinks. The tea and coffee which the parents and the\r\nhealthier children can use without immediate injury, gradually sap the\r\nenergies of the feebler child, who proves either an early victim, or a\r\nliving martyr to all the sufferings that debilitated nerves inflict. Can\r\nit be right, to lead children, where all allow that there is some\r\ndanger, and where, in many cases, disease and death are met, when\r\nanother path is known to be perfectly safe?\r\n\r\nOf the stimulating drinks in common use, _black tea_ is least injurious,\r\nbecause its flavor is so strong, in comparison with its narcotic\r\nprinciple, that one who uses it, is much less liable to excess. Children\r\ncan be trained to love milk and water sweetened with sugar, so that it\r\nwill always be a pleasant beverage; or, if there are exceptions to the\r\nrule, they will be few. Water is an unfailing resort. Every one loves\r\nit, and it is perfectly healthful.\r\n\r\nThe impression, common in this Country, that _warm drinks_, especially\r\nin Winter, are more healthful than cold, is not warranted by any\r\nexperience, nor by the laws of the physical system. At dinner, cold\r\ndrinks are universal, and no one deems them injurious. It is only at the\r\nother two meals that they are supposed to be hurtful.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that _warm_ drinks are healthful, and more agreeable\r\nthan cold, at certain times and seasons; but it is equally true, that\r\ndrinks above blood heat are not healthful. If any person should hold a\r\nfinger in hot water, for a considerable time, twice every day, it would\r\nbe found that the finger would gradually grow weaker. The frequent\r\napplication of the stimulus of heat, like all other stimulants,\r\neventually causes debility. If, therefore, a person is in the habit of\r\ndrinking hot drinks, twice a day, the teeth, throat, and stomach are\r\ngradually debilitated. This, most probably, is one of the causes of an\r\nearly decay of the teeth, which is observed to be much more common among\r\nAmerican ladies, than among those in European countries.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated to the writer, by an intelligent traveller, who had\r\nvisited Mexico, that it was rare to meet an individual with even a\r\ntolerable set of teeth; and that almost every grown person, he met in\r\nthe street, had merely remnants of teeth. On inquiry into the customs\r\nof the Country, it was found, that it was the universal practice to take\r\ntheir usual beverage at almost the boiling point; and this, doubtless,\r\nwas the chief cause of the almost entire want of teeth in that Country.\r\nIn the United States, it cannot be doubted that much evil is done, in\r\nthis way, by hot drinks. Most tea-drinkers consider tea as ruined, if it\r\nstands until it reaches the healthful temperature for drink.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Dr. Andrew Combe, presents the opinion of\r\nmost intelligent medical men on this subject.[G]\r\n\r\n\"_Water_ is a safe drink for all constitutions, provided it be resorted\r\nto in obedience to the dictates of natural thirst, only, and not of\r\nhabit. Unless the desire for it is felt, there is no occasion for its\r\nuse during a meal.\"\r\n\r\n\"The primary effect of all distilled and fermented liquors, is, to\r\n_stimulate the nervous system and quicken the circulation_. In infancy\r\nand childhood, the circulation is rapid, and easily excited; and the\r\nnervous system is strongly acted upon, even by the slightest external\r\nimpressions. Hence slight causes of irritation readily excite febrile\r\nand convulsive disorders. In youth, the natural tendency of the\r\nconstitution is still to excitement; and consequently, as a general\r\nrule, the stimulus of fermented liquors is injurious.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks show, that parents, who find that stimulating drinks are\r\nnot injurious to themselves, may mistake in inferring, from this, that\r\nthey will not be injurious to their children.\r\n\r\nDr. Combe continues thus: \"In mature age, when digestion is good and the\r\nsystem in full vigor, if the mode of life be not too exhausting, the\r\nnervous functions and general circulation are in their best condition,\r\nand require no stimulus for their support. The bodily energy is then\r\neasily sustained, by nutritious food and a regular regimen, and\r\nconsequently artificial excitement only increases the wasting of the\r\nnatural strength. In old age, when the powers of life begin to fail,\r\nmoderate stimulus may be used with evident advantage.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, in this connection, why the stimulus of animal food is\r\nnot to be regarded in the same light, as that of stimulating drinks. In\r\nreply, a very essential difference may be pointed out. Animal food\r\nfurnishes nutriment to the organs which it stimulates, but stimulating\r\ndrinks excite the organs to quickened action, without affording any\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed, by some, that tea and coffee have, at least, a\r\ndegree of nourishing power. But it is proved, that it is the milk and\r\nsugar, and not the main portion of the drink, which imparts the\r\nnourishment. Tea has not one particle of nourishing properties; and what\r\nlittle exists in the coffee-berry, is lost by roasting it in the usual\r\nmode. All that these articles do, is simply _to stimulate, without\r\nnourishing_.\r\n\r\nIt is very common, especially in schools, for children to form a habit\r\nof drinking freely of cold water. This is a debilitating habit, and\r\nshould be corrected. Very often, chewing a bit of cracker will stop a\r\ncraving for drink, better than taking water; and when teachers are\r\ntroubled with very thirsty scholars, they should direct them to this\r\nremedy. A person who exercises but little, requires no drink, between\r\nmeals, for health; and the craving for it is unhealthful. Spices, wines,\r\nfermented liquors, and all stimulating condiments, produce unhealthful\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[G] The writer would here remark, in reference to extracts made from\r\nvarious authors, that, for the sake of abridging, she has often left out\r\nparts of a paragraph, but never so as to modify the meaning of the\r\nauthor. Some ideas, not connected with the subject in hand, are omitted,\r\nbut none are altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nON CLOTHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears, by calculations made from bills of mortality, that one\r\nquarter of the human race perishes in infancy. This is a fact not in\r\naccordance with the analogy of Nature. No such mortality prevails among\r\nthe young of animals; it does not appear to be the design of the\r\nCreator; and it must be owing to causes which can be removed. Medical\r\nmen agree in the opinion, that a great portion of this mortality, is\r\nowing to mismanagement, in reference to fresh air, food, and clothing.\r\n\r\nAt birth, the circulation is chiefly in the vessels of the skin; for the\r\nliver and stomach, being feeble in action, demand less blood, and it\r\nresorts to the surface. If, therefore, an infant be exposed to cold, the\r\nblood is driven inward, by the contracting of the blood-vessels in the\r\nskin: and, the internal organs being thus over-stimulated, bowel\r\ncomplaints, croup, convulsions, or some other evil, ensues. This shows\r\nthe sad mistake of parents, who plunge infants in cold water to\r\nstrengthen their constitution; and teaches, that infants should be\r\nwashed in warm water, and in a warm room. Some have constitutions strong\r\nenough to bear mismanagement in these respects; but many fail in\r\nconsequence of it.\r\n\r\nHence we see the importance of dressing infants warmly, and protecting\r\nthem from exposure to a cold temperature. It is for this purpose, that\r\nmothers, now, very generally, cover the arms and necks of infants,\r\nespecially in Winter. Fathers and mothers, if they were obliged to go\r\nwith bare arms and necks, even in moderate weather, would often shiver\r\nwith cold; and yet they have a power of constitution which would subject\r\nthem to far less hazard and discomfort, than a delicate infant must\r\nexperience from a similar exposure. This mode of dressing infants, with\r\nbare necks and arms, has arisen from the common impression, that they\r\nhave a power of resisting cold superior to older persons. This is a\r\nmistake; for the experiments of medical men have established the fact,\r\nthat the power of producing heat is least in the period of infancy.\r\n\r\nExtensive investigations have been made in France, in reference to this\r\npoint. It is there required, in some districts, that every infant, at\r\nbirth, be carried to the office of the _maire_, [_mayor_,] to be\r\nregistered. It is found, in these districts, that the deaths of\r\nnewly-born infants, are much more numerous in the cold, than in the\r\nwarm, months; and that a much greater proportion of such deaths occurs\r\namong those who reside at a distance from the office of the _maire_,\r\nthan among those in its vicinity. This proves, that exposure to cold has\r\nmuch to do with the continuance of infant life.\r\n\r\nBut it is as dangerous to go to the other extreme, and keep the body too\r\nwarm. The skin, when kept at too high a temperature, is relaxed and\r\nweakened by too profuse perspiration, and becomes more sensitive, and\r\nmore readily affected by every change of temperature. This increases the\r\nliabilities to sudden colds; and it frequently happens, that the\r\nchildren, who are most carefully guarded from cold, are the ones most\r\nliable to take sudden and dangerous chills. The reason is, that, by the\r\ntoo great accumulation of clothing, the skin is too much excited, and\r\nthe blood is withdrawn from the internal organs, thus weakening them,\r\nwhile the skin itself is debilitated by the same process.\r\n\r\nThe rule of safety, is, so to cover the body, as to keep it entirely\r\nwarm, but not so as to induce perspiration in any part. The perspiration\r\ninduced by exercise is healthful, because it increases the appetite; but\r\nthe perspiration produced by excess of clothing is debilitating. This\r\nshows the importance of adjusting beds and their covering to the season.\r\nFeatherbeds are unhealthful in warm weather, because they induce\r\nperspiration; and in all cases, those, who have the care of children,\r\nshould proportion their covering by night to the season of the year.\r\nInfants and children should never be so clothed, as either to feel\r\nchilly, or to induce perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe greatest trouble, in this respect, to those who have the care of\r\nchildren, is owing to their throwing off their covering in the night.\r\nThe best guard, against such exposures, is a nightgown, of the warmest\r\nand thickest flannel, made like pantaloons at the lower part, and the\r\nlegs long, so that they can be tied over the feet. This makes less\r\ncovering needful, and saves the child from excessive cold when it is\r\nthrown off.\r\n\r\nThe clothing ought always to be proportioned to the constitution and\r\nhabits. A person of strong constitution, who takes much exercise, needs\r\nless clothing than one of delicate and sedentary habits. According to\r\nthis rule, women need much thicker and warmer clothing, when they go\r\nout, than men. But how different are our customs, from what sound wisdom\r\ndictates! Women go out with thin stockings, thin shoes, and open necks,\r\nwhen men are protected by thick woollen hose and boots, and their whole\r\nbody encased in many folds of flannel and broadcloth.\r\n\r\nFlannel, worn next the skin, is useful, for several reasons. It is a bad\r\nconductor of heat, so that it protects the body from _sudden_ chills\r\nwhen in a state of perspiration. It also produces a kind of friction on\r\nthe skin, which aids it in its functions, while its texture, being\r\nloose, enables it to receive and retain much matter, thrown off from the\r\nbody, which would otherwise accumulate on its surface. This is the\r\nreason, why medical men direct, that young children wear flannel next\r\nthe body, and woollen hose, the first two years of life. They are thus\r\nprotected from sudden exposures. For the same reason, laboring men\r\nshould thus wear flannels, which are also considered as preservatives\r\nfrom infection, in unhealthy atmospheres. They give a healthy action to\r\nthe skin, and thus enable it to resist the operation of unhealthy\r\nmiasms. On this account, persons residing in a new country should wear\r\nsuch clothing next the skin, to guard them from the noxious miasms\r\ncaused by extensive vegetable decompositions. It is stated, that the\r\nfatal influence of the malaria, or noxious exhalations around Rome, has\r\nbeen much diminished by this practice. But those who thus wear flannel,\r\nthrough the day, ought to take it off, at night, when it is not needed.\r\nIt should be hung so that it can be well aired, during the night.\r\n\r\nBut the practice, by which females probably suffer most, is, the use of\r\n_tight dresses_. Much has been said against the use of corsets by\r\nladies. But these may be worn with perfect safety, and be left off, and\r\nstill injury, such as they often produce, be equally felt. It is the\r\n_constriction_ of dress, that is to be feared, and not any particular\r\narticle that produces it. A frock, or a belt, may be so tight, as to be\r\neven worse than a corset, which would more equally divide the\r\ncompression.\r\n\r\nSo long as it is the fashion to admire, as models of elegance, the\r\nwasp-like figures which are presented at the rooms of mantuamakers and\r\nmilliners, there will be hundreds of foolish women, who will risk their\r\nlives and health to secure some resemblance to these deformities of the\r\nhuman frame. But it is believed, that all sensible women, when they\r\nfairly understand the evils which result from tight dressing, and learn\r\nthe _real_ model of taste and beauty for a perfect female form, will\r\nnever risk their own health, or the health of their daughters, in\r\nefforts to secure one which is as much at variance with good taste, as\r\nit is with good health.\r\n\r\nSuch female figures as our print-shops present, are made, not by the\r\nhand of the Author of all grace and beauty, but by the murderous\r\ncontrivances of the corset-shop; and the more a woman learns the true\r\nrules of grace and beauty for the female form, the more her taste will\r\nrevolt from such ridiculous distortions. The folly of the Chinese belle,\r\nwho totters on two useless deformities, is nothing, compared to that of\r\nthe American belle, who impedes all the internal organs in the discharge\r\nof their functions, that she may have a slender waist.\r\n\r\nIt was shown, in the article on the bones and muscles, that exercise was\r\nindispensable to their growth and strength. If any muscles are left\r\nunemployed, they diminish in size and strength. The girding of tight\r\ndresses operates thus on the muscles of the body. If an article, like\r\ncorsets, is made to hold up the body, then those muscles, which are\r\ndesigned for this purpose, are released from duty, and grow weak; so\r\nthat, after this has been continued for some time, leaving off the\r\nunnatural support produces a feeling of weakness. Thus a person will\r\ncomplain of feeling so weak and unsupported, without corsets, as to be\r\nuncomfortable. This is entirely owing to the disuse of those muscles,\r\nwhich corsets throw out of employ.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of tight dress, is, to stop or impede the office of the\r\nlungs. Unless the chest can expand, fully, and with perfect ease, a\r\nportion of the lungs is not filled with air, and thus the full\r\npurification of the blood is prevented. This movement of the lungs, when\r\nthey are fully inflated, increases the peristaltic movement of the\r\nstomach and bowels, and promotes digestion; any constriction of the\r\nwaist tends to impede this important operation, and indigestion, with\r\nall its attendant evils, is often the result.\r\n\r\nThe rule of safety, in regard to the tightness of dress, is this. Every\r\nperson should be dressed so loosely, that, _when sitting in the posture\r\nused in sewing, reading, or study_ THE LUNGS _can be as fully\r\nand as easily inflated, as they are without clothing_. Many a woman\r\nthinks she dresses loosely, because, when she stands up, her clothing\r\ndoes not confine her chest. This is not a fair test. It is in the\r\nposition most used when engaged in common employments, that we are to\r\njudge of the constriction of dress. Let every woman, then, bear in mind,\r\nthat, just so long as her dress and position oppose any resistance to\r\nthe motion of her chest, in just such proportion her blood is\r\nunpurified, and her vital organs are debilitated.\r\n\r\nThe English ladies set our countrywomen a good example, in accommodating\r\ntheir dress to times and seasons. The richest and noblest among them\r\nwear warm cotton hose and thick shoes, when they walk for exercise; and\r\nwould deem it vulgar to appear, as many of our ladies do, with thin hose\r\nand shoes, in damp or cold weather. Any mode of dress, not suited to the\r\nemployment, the age, the season, or the means of the wearer, is in bad\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nON CLEANLINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of cleanliness, in person and dress, can never be fully\r\nrealized, by persons who are ignorant of the construction of the skin,\r\nand of the influence which its treatment has on the health of the body.\r\nPersons deficient in such knowledge, frequently sneer at what they deem\r\nthe foolish and fidgety particularity of others, whose frequent\r\nablutions and changes of clothing, exceed their own measure of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe popular maxim, that \"dirt is healthy,\" has probably arisen from the\r\nfact, that playing in the open air is very beneficial to the health of\r\nchildren, who thus get dirt on their persons and clothes. But it is the\r\nfresh air and exercise, and not the dirt, which promotes the health.\r\n\r\nIn a previous article, it was shown, that the lungs, bowels, kidneys,\r\nand skin, were the organs employed in throwing off those waste and\r\nnoxious parts of the food not employed in nourishing the body. Of this,\r\nthe skin has the largest duty to perform; throwing off, at least, twenty\r\nounces every twenty-four hours, by means of insensible perspiration.\r\nWhen exercise sets the blood in quicker motion, it ministers its\r\nsupplies faster, and there is consequently a greater residuum to be\r\nthrown off by the skin; and then the perspiration becomes so abundant as\r\nto be perceptible. In this state, if a sudden chill take place, the\r\nblood-vessels of the skin contract, the blood is driven from the\r\nsurface, and the internal organs are taxed with a double duty. If the\r\nconstitution be a strong one, these organs march on and perform the\r\nlabor exacted. But if any of these organs be debilitated, the weakest\r\none generally gives way, and some disease ensues.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent illustrations of this reciprocated action, is\r\nafforded by a convivial meeting in cold weather. The heat of the room,\r\nthe food, and the excitement, quicken the circulation, and perspiration\r\nis evolved. When the company passes into the cold air, a sudden\r\nrevulsion takes place. The increased circulation continues, for some\r\ntime after; but the skin being cooled, the blood retreats, and the\r\ninternal organs are obliged to perform the duties of the skin as well as\r\ntheir own. Then, in case the lungs are the weakest organ, the mucous\r\nsecretion becomes excessive; so that it would fill up the cells, and\r\nstop the breathing, were it not for the spasmodic effort called\r\ncoughing, by which this substance is thrown out. In case the nerves are\r\nthe weakest part of the system, such an exposure would result in pains\r\nin the head or teeth, or in some other nervous ailment. If the muscles\r\nbe the weakest part, rheumatic affections will ensue; and if the bowels\r\nor kidneys be weakest, some disorder in their functions will result.\r\n\r\nBut it is found, that the closing of the pores of the skin with other\r\nsubstances, tends to a similar result on the internal organs. In this\r\nsituation, the skin is unable perfectly to perform its functions, and\r\neither the blood remains to a certain extent unpurified, or else the\r\ninternal organs have an unnatural duty to perform. Either of these\r\nresults tends to produce disease, and the gradual decay of the vital\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it has been shown, that the skin has the power of absorbing\r\ninto the blood particles retained on its surface. In consequence of\r\nthese peculiarities, the skin of the whole body needs to be washed,\r\nevery day. This process removes from the pores the matter exhaled from\r\nthe blood, and also that collected from the atmosphere and other bodies.\r\nIf this process be not often performed, the pores of the skin fill up\r\nwith the redundant matter expelled, and being pressed, by the clothing,\r\nto the surface of the body, the skin is both interrupted in its exhaling\r\nprocess, and its absorbents take back into the system portions of the\r\nnoxious matter. Thus the blood is not relieved to the extent designed,\r\nwhile it receives back noxious particles, which are thus carried to the\r\nlungs, liver, and every part of the system.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why the articles worn next to the skin should often\r\nbe changed; and why it is recommended that persons should not sleep in\r\nthe article they wear next the skin through the day. The alternate\r\nchange and airing of the articles worn next the body by day or night, is\r\na practice very favorable to the health of the skin. The fresh air has\r\nthe power of removing much of the noxious effluvia received from the\r\nbody by the clothing. It is with reference to this, that on leaving a\r\nbed, its covering should be thrown open and exposed to the fresh air.\r\n\r\nThe benefit arising from a proper care of the skin, is the reason why\r\nbathing has been so extensively practised by civilized nations. The\r\nGreeks and Romans considered bathing as indispensable to daily comfort,\r\nas much so, as their meals; and public baths were provided for all\r\nclasses. In European countries, this practice is very prevalent, but\r\nthere is no civilized nation which pays so little regard to the rules of\r\nhealth, on this subject, as our own. To wash the face, feet, hands, and\r\nneck, is the extent of the ablutions practised by perhaps the majority\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of the bath, there is need of some information, in\r\norder to prevent danger from its misuse. Persons in good health, and\r\nwith strong constitutions, can use the cold bath, and the shower-bath,\r\nwith entire safety and benefit. But if the constitution be feeble, cold\r\nbathing is injurious. If it is useful, it can be known by an invigorated\r\nfeeling, and a warm glow on the skin; but if, instead of this, there be\r\na feeling of debility, and the hands and feet become cold, it is a\r\ncertain sign, that this kind of bathing is injurious. A bath at\r\nninety-five degrees of Fahrenheit, is about the right temperature. A\r\nbath, blood warm, or a little cooler than the skin, is safe for all\r\nconstitutions, if not protracted over half an hour. After bathing, the\r\nbody should be rubbed with a brush or coarse towel, to remove the light\r\nscales of scarfskin, which adhere to it, and also to promote a healthful\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nA bath should never be taken, till three hours after eating, as it\r\ninterrupts the process of digestion, by withdrawing the blood from the\r\nstomach to the surface. Neither should it be taken, when the body is\r\nweary with exercise, nor be immediately followed by severe exercise.\r\nMany suppose that a warm bath exposes a person more readily to take\r\ncold; and that it tends to debilitate the system. This is not the case,\r\nunless it be protracted too long. If it be used so as to cleanse the\r\nskin, and give it a gentle stimulus, it is better able to resist cold\r\nthan before the process. This is the reason why the Swedes and Russians\r\ncan rush, reeking, out of their steam baths, and throw themselves into\r\nthe snow, and not only escape injury, but feel invigorated. It is for a\r\nsimilar reason, that we suffer less in going into the cold, from a warm\r\nroom, with our body entirely warm, than when we go out somewhat chilled.\r\nWhen the skin is warm, the circulation is active on the surface, and the\r\ncold does not so reduce its temperature, but that increased exercise\r\nwill keep up its warmth.\r\n\r\nWhen families have no bathing establishment, every member should wash\r\nthe whole person, on rising or going to bed, either in cold or warm\r\nwater, according to the constitution. It is especially important, that\r\nchildren have the perspiration and other impurities, which their\r\nexercise and sports have occasioned, removed from their skin before\r\ngoing to bed. The hours of sleep are those when the body most freely\r\nexhales the waste matter of the system, and all the pores should be\r\nproperly freed from impediments to this healthful operation. For this\r\npurpose, a large tin wash-pan should be kept for children, just large\r\nenough, at bottom, for them to stand in, and flaring outward, so as to\r\nbe very broad at top. A child can then be placed in it, standing, and\r\nwashed with a sponge, without wetting the floor. Being small at bottom,\r\nit is better than a tub; it is not only smaller, but lighter, and\r\nrequires less water.\r\n\r\nThese remarks indicate the wisdom of those parents, who habitually wash\r\ntheir children, all over, before they go to bed. The chance of life and\r\nhealth, to such children, is greatly increased by this practice; and no\r\ndoubt much of the suffering of childhood, from cutaneous eruptions, weak\r\neyes, earache, colds, and fevers, is owing to a neglect of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe care of the teeth should be made habitual to children, not merely as\r\npromoting an agreeable appearance, but as a needful preservative. The\r\nsaliva contains tartar, an earthy substance, which is deposited on the\r\nteeth, and destroys both their beauty and health. This can be prevented,\r\nby the use of the brush, night and morning. But, if this be neglected,\r\nthe deposite becomes hard, and can be removed only by the dentist. If\r\nsuffered to remain, it tends to destroy the health of the gums; they\r\ngradually decay, and thus the roots of the teeth become bare, and they\r\noften drop out.\r\n\r\nWhen children are shedding their first set of teeth, care should be\r\ntaken, to remove them as soon as they become loose; otherwise the new\r\nteeth will grow awry. When persons have defective teeth, they can often\r\nbe saved, by having them filled by a dentist. This also will frequently\r\nprevent the toothache.\r\n\r\nChildren should be taught to take proper care of their nails. Long and\r\ndirty nails have a disagreeable appearance. When children wash, in the\r\nmorning, they should be supplied with an instrument to clean the nails,\r\nand be required to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nON EARLY RISING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no practice, which has been more extensively eulogized, in all\r\nages, than early rising; and this universal impression, is an indication\r\nthat it is founded on true philosophy. For, it is rarely the case, that\r\nthe common sense of mankind fastens on a practice, as really beneficial,\r\nespecially one that demands self-denial, without some substantial\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThis practice, which may justly be called a domestic virtue, is one,\r\nwhich has a peculiar claim to be styled American and democratic. The\r\ndistinctive mark of aristocratic nations, is, a disregard of the great\r\nmass, and a disproportionate regard for the interests of certain\r\nprivileged orders. All the customs and habits of such a nation, are, to\r\na greater or less extent, regulated by this principle. Now the mass of\r\nany nation must always consist of persons who labor at occupations which\r\ndemand the light of day. But in aristocratic countries, especially in\r\nEngland, labor is regarded as the mark of the lower classes, and\r\nindolence is considered as one mark of a gentleman. This impression has\r\ngradually and imperceptibly, to a great extent, regulated their customs,\r\nso that, even in their hours of meals and repose, the higher orders aim\r\nat being different and distinct from those, who, by laborious pursuits,\r\nare placed below them. From this circumstance, while the lower orders\r\nlabor by day, and sleep at night, the rich, the noble, and the honored,\r\nsleep by day, and follow their pursuits and pleasures by night. It will\r\nbe found, that the aristocracy of London breakfast near mid-day, dine\r\nafter dark, visit and go to Parliament between ten and twelve at night,\r\nand retire to sleep towards morning. In consequence of this, the\r\nsubordinate classes, who aim at gentility, gradually fall into the same\r\npractice. The influence of this custom extends across the ocean, and\r\nhere, in this democratic land, we find many, who measure their grade of\r\ngentility by the late hour at which they arrive at a party. And this\r\naristocratic tendency is growing upon us, so that, throughout the\r\nNation, the hours for visiting and retiring are constantly becoming\r\nlater, while the hours for rising correspond in lateness.\r\n\r\nThe question, then, is one which appeals to American women, as a matter\r\nof patriotism; as having a bearing on those great principles of\r\ndemocracy, which we conceive to be equally the principles of\r\nChristianity. Shall we form our customs on the principle that labor is\r\ndegrading, and indolence genteel? Shall we assume, by our practice, that\r\nthe interests of the great mass are to be sacrificed for the pleasures\r\nand honors of a privileged few? Shall we ape the customs of aristocratic\r\nlands, in those very practices which result from principles and\r\ninstitutions that we condemn? Shall we not rather take the place to\r\nwhich we are entitled, as the leaders, rather than the followers, in the\r\ncustoms of society, turn back the tide of aristocratic inroads, and\r\ncarry through the whole, not only of civil and political, but of social\r\nand domestic, life, the true principles of democratic freedom and\r\nequality? The following considerations may serve to strengthen an\r\naffirmative decision.\r\n\r\nThe first, relates to the health of a family. It is a universal law of\r\nphysiology, that all living things flourish best in the light.\r\nVegetables, in a dark cellar, grow pale and spindling,[H] and children,\r\nbrought up in mines, are wan and stinted. This universal law, indicates\r\nthe folly of turning day into night, thus losing the genial influence,\r\nwhich the light of day produces on all animated creation.\r\n\r\nThere is another phenomenon in the physiology of Nature, which equally\r\ncondemns this practice. It has been shown, that the purification of the\r\nblood, in the lungs, is secured, by the oxygen of the atmosphere\r\nabsorbing its carbon and hydrogen. This combination forms carbonic acid\r\nand water, which are expired from our lungs into the atmosphere. Now all\r\nthe vegetable world undergoes a similar process. In the light of day,\r\nall the leaves of vegetables absorb carbon and expire oxygen, thus\r\nsupplying the air with its vital principle, and withdrawing the more\r\ndeleterious element. But, when the light is withdrawn, this process is\r\nreversed, and all vegetables exhale carbonic acid, and inspire the\r\noxygen of the air. Thus it appears, that the atmosphere of day is much\r\nmore healthful than that of the night, especially out of doors.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when the body is fatigued, it is much more liable to\r\ndeleterious influences, from noxious particles in the atmosphere, which\r\nmay be absorbed by the skin or the lungs. In consequence of this, the\r\nlast hours of daily labor are more likely to be those of risk,\r\nespecially to delicate constitutions. This is a proper reason for\r\nretiring to the house and to slumber, at an early hour, that the body\r\nmay not be exposed to the most risk, when, after the exertions of the\r\nday, it is least able to bear it.\r\n\r\nThe observations of medical men, whose inquiries have been directed to\r\nthis point, have decided, that from six to eight hours, is the amount of\r\nsleep demanded by persons in health. Some constitutions require as much\r\nas eight, and others no more than six, hours of repose. But eight hours\r\nis the maximum for all persons in ordinary health, with ordinary\r\noccupations. In cases of extra physical exertions, or the debility of\r\ndisease, or a decayed constitution, more than this is required. Let\r\neight hours, then, be regarded as the ordinary period required for\r\nsleep, by an industrious people, like the Americans. According to this,\r\nthe practice of rising between four and five, and retiring between nine\r\nand ten, in Summer, would secure most of the sunlight, and expose us the\r\nleast to that period of the atmosphere, when it is most noxious. In\r\nWinter, the night air is less deleterious, because the frost binds\r\nnoxious exhalations, and vegetation ceases its inspiring and expiring\r\nprocess; and, moreover, as the constitution is more tried, in cold, than\r\nin warm, weather, and as in cold weather the body exhales less during\r\nthe hours of sleep, it is not so injurious to protract our slumbers\r\nbeyond the proper period, as it is in the warm months. But in Winter, it\r\nis best for grown persons, in health, to rise as soon as they can see to\r\ndress, and retire so as not to allow more than eight hours for sleep.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that the laws of our political condition, the laws of\r\nthe natural world, and the constitution of our bodies, alike demand that\r\nwe rise with the light of day to prosecute our employments, and that we\r\nretire within doors, when this light is withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the effects of protracting the time spent in repose, many\r\nextensive and satisfactory investigations have been made. It has been\r\nshown, that, during sleep, the body perspires most freely, while yet\r\nneither food nor exercise are ministering to its wants. Of course, if we\r\ncontinue our slumbers, beyond the time required to restore the body to\r\nits usual vigor, there is an unperceived undermining of the\r\nconstitution, by this protracted and debilitating exhalation. This\r\nprocess, in a course of years, renders the body delicate, and less able\r\nto withstand disease; and in the result shortens life. Sir John\r\nSinclair, who has written a large work on the Causes of Longevity,\r\nstates, as one result of his extensive investigations, that he has never\r\nyet heard or read of a single case of great longevity, where the\r\nindividual was not an early riser. He says, that he has found cases, in\r\nwhich the individual has violated some one of all the other laws of\r\nhealth, and yet lived to great age; but never a single instance, in\r\nwhich any constitution has withstood that undermining, consequent on\r\nprotracting the hours of repose beyond the demands of the system.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for early rising, is, that it is indispensable to a\r\nsystematic and well-regulated family. At whatever hour the parents\r\nretire, children and domestics, wearied by play or labor, must retire\r\nearly. Children usually awake with the dawn of light, and commence their\r\nplay, while domestics usually prefer the freshness of morning for their\r\nlabors. If, then, the parents rise at a late hour, they either induce a\r\nhabit of protracting sleep in their children and domestics, or else the\r\nfamily is up, and at their pursuits, while their supervisors are in\r\nbed. Any woman, who asserts that her children and domestics, in the\r\nfirst hours of day, when their spirits are freshest, will be as well\r\nregulated without her presence, as with it, confesses that, which surely\r\nis little for her credit. It is believed, that any candid woman,\r\nwhatever may be her excuse for late rising, will concede, that, if she\r\ncould rise early, it would be for the advantage of her family. A late\r\nbreakfast puts back the work, through the whole day, for every member of\r\na family; and, if the parents thus occasion the loss of an hour or two,\r\nto each individual, who, but for their delay in the morning, would be\r\nusefully employed, they, alone, are responsible for all this waste of\r\ntime. Is it said, that those, who wish to rise early, can go to their\r\nemployments before breakfast? it may be replied, that, in most cases, it\r\nis not safe to use the eyes or the muscles in the morning, till the\r\nlosses of the night have been repaired by food. In addition to this, it\r\nmay be urged, that, where the parents set an example of the violation of\r\nthe rules of health and industry, their influence tends in the wrong\r\ndirection; so that whatever waste of time is induced, by a practice\r\nwhich they thus uphold, must be set down to their account.\r\n\r\nBut the practice of early rising has a relation to the general interests\r\nof the social community, as well as to that of each distinct family. All\r\nthat great portion of the community, who are employed in business and\r\nlabor, find it needful to rise early; and all their hours of meals, and\r\ntheir appointments for business or pleasure, must be accommodated to\r\nthese arrangements. Now, if a small portion of the community establish\r\nvery different hours, it makes a kind of jostling, in all the concerns\r\nand interests of society. The various appointments for the public, such\r\nas meetings, schools, and business hours, must be accommodated to the\r\nmass, and not to individuals. The few, then, who establish domestic\r\nhabits at variance with the majority, are either constantly interrupted\r\nin their own arrangements, or else are interfering with the rights and\r\ninterests of others. This is exemplified in the case of schools. In\r\nfamilies where late rising is practised, either hurry, irregularity, and\r\nneglect, are engendered in the family, or else the interests of the\r\nschool, and thus of the community, are sacrificed. In this, and many\r\nother concerns, it can be shown, that the wellbeing of the bulk of the\r\npeople, is, to a greater or less extent, impaired by this aristocratic\r\npractice. Let any teacher select the unpunctual scholars,--a class who\r\nmost seriously interfere with the interests of the school;--and let men\r\nof business select those who cause them most waste of time and vexation,\r\nby unpunctuality; and it will be found, that they are among the late\r\nrisers, and rarely among those who rise early. Thus, it is manifest,\r\nthat late rising not only injures the person and family which practise\r\nit, but interferes with the rights and convenience of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[H] Shooting into a long, small, stalk or root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nON DOMESTIC EXERCISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters, we have noticed the various causes, which,\r\none or all, operate to produce that melancholy delicacy and decay of the\r\nfemale constitution, which are the occasion of so much physical and\r\nmental suffering throughout this Country.\r\n\r\nThese, in a more condensed form, may be enumerated thus:\r\n\r\nA want of exercise, inducing softness in the bones, weakness in the\r\nmuscles, inactivity in the digestive organs, and general debility in the\r\nnervous system: A neglect of the care of the skin, whereby the blood has\r\nnot been properly purified, and the internal organs have been weakened:\r\nA violation of the laws of health, in regard to food, by eating too\r\nmuch, too fast, and too often; by using stimulating food and drinks; by\r\nusing them too warm or too cold; and by eating that which the power of\r\nthe stomach is not sufficient to digest: A neglect of the laws of\r\nhealth, in regard to clothing, by dressing too tight, and by wearing too\r\nlittle covering, in cold and damp weather, and especially by not\r\nsufficiently protecting the feet: A neglect to gain a proper supply of\r\npure air, in sleeping apartments and schoolrooms, and too great a\r\nconfinement to the house: The pursuit of exciting amusements at\r\nunseasonable hours, and the many exposures involved at such times: And\r\nlastly, sleeping by day, instead of by night, and protracting the hours\r\nof sleep, beyond the period of repose demanded for rest; thus\r\nexhausting, instead of recruiting, the energies of the system.\r\n\r\nBut all the other causes, combined, probably, do not produce one half\r\nthe evils, which result from a want of proper exercise. A person who\r\nkeeps all the functions of the system in full play, by the active and\r\nfrequent use of every muscle, especially if it be in the open air, gains\r\na power of constitution, which can resist many evils that would follow\r\nfrom the other neglects and risks detailed. This being the case, there\r\ncan be no subject, more important for mothers and young ladies to\r\nunderstand, than the influence on the health, both of body and mind, of\r\nthe neglect or abuse of the muscular system.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown, in the previous pages, that all the muscles have\r\nnerves and blood-vessels, running in larger trunks, or minute branches,\r\nto every portion of the body. The experiments of Sir Charles Bell and\r\nothers, have developed the curious fact, that each apparently single\r\nnerve, in reality consists of two distinct portions, running together in\r\nthe same covering. One portion, is the nerve of _sensation_ or\r\n_feeling_, the other, the nerve of _motion_. The nerves of sensation are\r\nthose which are affected by the emotions and volitions of the mind; and\r\nthe nerves of motion are those which impart moving power to the muscles.\r\nExperiments show, that, where the nerves issue from the spine, the\r\nnerve of sensation may be cut off without severing the nerve of motion,\r\nand then the parts, to which this nerve extends, lose the power of\r\nfeeling, while the power of motion continues; and so, on the other hand,\r\nthe nerve of motion may be divided, and, the nerve of sensation\r\nremaining uninjured, the power of feeling is retained, and the power of\r\nmotion is lost.\r\n\r\nIn certain nervous diseases, sometimes a limb loses its power of\r\nfeeling, and yet retains the power of motion; in other cases, the power\r\nof motion is lost, and the power of sensation is retained; and in other\r\ncases, still, when a limb is _paralysed_, both the power of motion and\r\nof sensation are lost.\r\n\r\nNow, the nerves, like all other parts of the body, gain and lose\r\nstrength, according as they are exercised. If they have too much, or too\r\nlittle, exercise, they lose strength; if they are exercised to a proper\r\ndegree, they gain strength. When the mind is continuously excited, by\r\nbusiness, study, or the imagination, the nerves of feeling are kept in\r\nconstant action, while the nerves of motion are unemployed. If this is\r\ncontinued, for a long time, the nerves of sensation lose their strength,\r\nfrom over action, and the nerves of motion lose their power, from\r\ninactivity. In consequence, there is a morbid excitability of the\r\nnervous, and a debility of the muscular, system, which make all exertion\r\nirksome and wearisome. The only mode of preserving the health of these\r\nsystems, is, to keep up in them an equilibrium of action. For this\r\npurpose, occupations must be sought, which exercise the muscles, and\r\ninterest the mind; and thus the equal action of both kinds of nerves is\r\nsecured. This shows why exercise is so much more healthful and\r\ninvigorating, when the mind is interested, than when it is not. As an\r\nillustration, let a person go a shopping, with a friend, and have\r\nnothing to do, but look on; how soon do the continuous walking and\r\nstanding weary! But suppose one, thus wearied, hears of the arrival of a\r\nvery dear friend: she can instantly walk off a mile or two, to meet\r\nher, without the least feeling of fatigue. By this is shown the\r\nimportance of furnishing, for young persons, exercise in which they will\r\ntake an interest. Long and formal walks, merely for exercise, though\r\nthey do some good, in securing fresh air and some exercise of the\r\nmuscles, would be of triple benefit, if changed to amusing sports, or to\r\nthe cultivation of fruits and flowers, in which it is impossible to\r\nengage, without acquiring a great interest. It shows, also, why it is\r\nfar better to trust to useful domestic exercise, at home, than to send a\r\nyoung person out to walk, for the mere purpose of exercise. Young girls\r\ncan seldom be made to realize the value of health, and the need of\r\nexercise to secure it, so as to feel much interest in walking abroad,\r\nwhen they have no other object. But, if they are brought up to minister\r\nto the comfort and enjoyment of themselves and others, by performing\r\ndomestic duties, they will constantly be interested and cheered in their\r\nexercise, by the feeling of usefulness, and the consciousness of having\r\nperformed their duty.\r\n\r\nThere are few young persons, it is hoped, who are brought up with such\r\nmiserable habits of selfishness and indolence, that they cannot be made\r\nto feel happier, by the consciousness of being usefully employed. And\r\nthose who have never been accustomed to think or care for any one but\r\nthemselves, and who seem to feel little pleasure in making themselves\r\nuseful, by wise and proper influences, can often be gradually awakened\r\nto the new pleasure of benevolent exertion to promote the comfort and\r\nenjoyment of others. And the more this sacred and elevating kind of\r\nenjoyment is tasted, the greater is the relish induced. Other\r\nenjoyments, often cloy; but the heavenly pleasure, secured by virtuous\r\nindustry and benevolence, while it satisfies, at the time, awakens fresh\r\ndesires for so ennobling a good.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the favorable influence on the nervous and muscular system,\r\nthus gained, it has been shown, that exercise imparts fresh strength and\r\nvitality to all parts of the body. The exertion of the muscles quickens\r\nthe flow of the blood, which thus ministers its supplies faster to\r\nevery part of the body, and, of course, loses a portion of its\r\nnourishing qualities. When this is the case, the stomach issues its\r\nmandate of _hunger_, calling for new supplies. When these are furnished,\r\nthe action of the muscles again hastens a full supply to every organ,\r\nand thus the nerves, the muscles, the bones, the skin, and all the\r\ninternal organs, are invigorated, and the whole body developes its\r\npowers, in fair proportions, fresh strength and full beauty. All the\r\ncosmetics of trade, all the labors of mantuamakers, milliners, makers of\r\ncorsets, shoemakers, and hairdressers, could never confer so clear and\r\npure a skin, so fresh a color, so finely moulded a form, and such\r\ncheerful health and spirits, as would be secured by training a child to\r\nobey the laws of the benevolent Creator, in the appropriate employment\r\nof body and mind in useful domestic exercise. And the present habits of\r\nthe wealthy, and even of those without wealth, which condemn young girls\r\nso exclusively to books or sedentary pursuits, are as destructive to\r\nbeauty and grace, as they are to health and happiness.\r\n\r\nEvery allowance should be made for the mistakes of mothers and teachers,\r\nto whom the knowledge which would have saved them from the evils of such\r\na course has never been furnished; but as information, on these matters,\r\nis every year becoming more abundant, it is to be hoped, that the next\r\ngeneration, at least, may be saved from the evils which afflict those\r\nnow on the stage. What a change would be made in the happiness of this\r\nCountry, if all the pale and delicate young girls should become\r\nblooming, healthful, and active, and all the enfeebled and care-worn\r\nmothers should be transformed into such fresh, active, healthful, and\r\nenergetic matrons, as are so frequently found in our mother land!\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, that the excessive use of the muscles, as much as\r\ntheir inactivity, tends to weaken them. Nothing is more painful, than\r\nthe keeping a muscle constantly on the stretch, without any relaxation\r\nor change. This can be realized, by holding out an arm, perpendicularly\r\nto the body, for ten or fifteen minutes, if any one can so long bear the\r\npain. Of course, confinement to one position, for a great length of\r\ntime, tends to weaken the muscles thus strained.\r\n\r\nThis shows the evil of confining young children to their seats, in the\r\nschoolroom, so much and so long as is often done. Having no backs to\r\ntheir seats, as is generally the case, the muscles, which are employed\r\nin holding up the body, are kept in a state of constant tension, till\r\nthey grow feeble from overworking. Then, the child begins to grow\r\ncrooked, and the parents, to remedy the evil, sometimes put on bracers\r\nor corsets. These, instead of doing any good, serve to prevent the use\r\nof those muscles, which, if properly exercised, would hold the body\r\nstraight; and thus they grow still weaker, from entire inactivity. If a\r\nparent perceives that a child is growing crooked, the proper remedy is,\r\nto withdraw it from all pursuits which tax one particular set of\r\nmuscles, and turn it out to exercise in sports, or in gardening, in the\r\nfresh air, when all the muscles will be used, and the whole system\r\nstrengthened. Or, if this cannot be done, sweeping, dusting, running of\r\nerrands, and many household employments, which involve lifting,\r\nstooping, bending, and walking, are quite as good, and, on some\r\naccounts, better, provided the house is properly supplied with fresh\r\nair.\r\n\r\nWhere persons have formed habits of inactivity, some caution is\r\nnecessary, in attempting a change; this must be made gradually; and the\r\nmuscles must never be excessively fatigued at any time. If this change\r\nbe not thus gradually made, the weakness, at first caused by inactivity,\r\nwill be increased by excessive exertion. A distinguished medical\r\ngentleman gives this rule, to direct us in regard to the amount of\r\nfatigue, which is safe and useful. A person is never too much fatigued,\r\nif one night of repose gives sufficient rest, and restores the usual\r\nstrength. But, if the sleep is disturbed, and the person wakes with a\r\nfeeling of weariness and languor, it is a sure indication that the\r\nexercise has been excessive. No more fatigue, then, should be allowed,\r\nthan one night's rest will remedy.\r\n\r\nSome persons object to sweeping, on account of the dust inhaled. But\r\nfree ventilation, frequent sweeping, and the use of damp sand, or damp\r\nIndian meal, or damp tea leaves, for carpets, will secure a more clear\r\natmosphere than is often found in the streets of cities. And the mother,\r\nwho will hire domestics, to take away this and other domestic\r\nemployments, which would secure to her daughters, health, grace, beauty,\r\nand domestic virtues, and the young ladies, who consent to be deprived\r\nof these advantages, will probably live to mourn over the languor,\r\ndiscouragement, pain, and sorrow, which will come with ill health, as\r\nthe almost inevitable result.\r\n\r\nThe following are extracts from 'The Young Ladies' Friend,' on this\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n\"Whether rich or poor, young or old, married or single, a woman is\r\nalways liable to be called to the performance of every kind of domestic\r\nduty, as well as to be placed at the head of a family; and nothing,\r\nshort of a _practical_ knowledge of the details of housekeeping, can\r\never make those duties easy, or render her competent to direct others in\r\nthe performance of them.\r\n\r\n\"All moral writers on female character, treat of Domestic Economy as an\r\nindispensable part of female education; and this, too, in the old\r\ncountries of Europe, where an abundant population, and the institutions\r\nof society, render it easy to secure the services of faithful\r\ndomestics.\"\r\n\r\n\"All female characters that are held up to admiration, whether in\r\nfiction or biography, will be found to possess these domestic\r\naccomplishments; and, if they are considered indispensable in the Old\r\nWorld, how much more are they needed, in this land of independence,\r\nwhere riches cannot exempt the mistress of a family from the difficulty\r\nof procuring efficient aid, and where perpetual change of domestics,\r\nrenders perpetual instruction and superintendence necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Since, then, the details of good housekeeping must be included in a\r\ngood female education, it is very desirable that they should be acquired\r\nwhen young, and so practised as to become easy, and to be performed\r\ndexterously and expeditiously.\"\r\n\r\n\"The elegant and accomplished Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who figured in\r\nthe fashionable, as well as the literary, circles of her time, has said,\r\nthat 'the most minute details of household economy become elegant and\r\nrefined, when they are ennobled by sentiment;' and they are truly\r\nennobled, when we do them either from a sense of duty, or consideration\r\nfor a parent, or love to a husband. 'To furnish a room,' continues this\r\nlady, 'is no longer a commonplace affair, shared with upholsterers and\r\ncabinet-makers; it is decorating the place where I am to meet a friend\r\nor lover. To order dinner is not merely arranging a meal with my cook;\r\nit is preparing refreshment for him whom I love. These necessary\r\noccupations, viewed in this light, by a person capable of strong\r\nattachment, are so many pleasures, and afford her far more delight, than\r\nthe games and shows which constitute the amusements of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"Such is the testimony of a titled lady of the last century, to the\r\nsentiment that may be made to mingle in the most homely occupations. I\r\nwill now quote that of a modern female writer and traveller, who, in her\r\npleasant book, called 'Six Weeks on the Loire,' has thus described the\r\nhousewifery of the daughter of a French nobleman, residing in a superb\r\nchateau on that river. The travellers had just arrived, and been\r\nintroduced, when the following scene took place.\r\n\r\n\"'The bill of fare for dinner was discussed in my presence, and settled,\r\n_sans facon_,[I] with that delightful frankness and gayety, which, in\r\nthe French character, gives a charm to the most trifling occurrence.\r\nMademoiselle Louise then begged me to excuse her for half an hour, as\r\nshe was going to make some creams, and some _pastilles_.[J] I requested\r\nthat I might accompany her, and also render myself useful; we\r\naccordingly went together to the dairy. I made tarts _a l'Anglaise_,[K]\r\nwhilst she made confections and _bonbons_,[L] and all manner of pretty\r\nthings, with as much ease as if she had never done any thing else, and\r\nas much grace as she displayed in the saloon. I could not help thinking,\r\nas I looked at her, with her servants about her, all cheerful,\r\nrespectful, and anxious to attend upon her, how much better it would be\r\nfor the young ladies in England, if they would occasionally return to\r\nthe habits of their grandmammas, and mingle the animated and endearing\r\noccupations of domestic life, and the modest manners and social\r\namusements of home, with the perpetual practising on harps and pianos,\r\nand the incessant efforts at display, and search after gayety, which, at\r\nthe present day, render them any thing but what an amiable man, of a\r\nreflecting mind and delicate sentiments, would desire in the woman he\r\nmight wish to select as the companion of his life.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] Without formality, or useless ceremony.\r\n\r\n[J] Rolls of paste, or pastry, or sugarplums.\r\n\r\n[K] According to the English fashion.\r\n\r\n[L] Nice things or dainties, such as sweetmeats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nON DOMESTIC MANNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood-manners are the expressions of benevolence in personal intercourse,\r\nby which we endeavor to promote the comfort and enjoyment of others, and\r\nto avoid all that gives needless uneasiness. It is the exterior\r\nexhibition of the Divine precept, which requires us to do to others, as\r\nwe would that they should do to us. It is saying, by our deportment, to\r\nall around, that we consider their feelings, tastes, and convenience, as\r\nequal in value to our own.\r\n\r\nGood-manners lead us to avoid all practices which offend the taste of\r\nothers; all violations of the conventional rules of propriety; all rude\r\nand disrespectful language and deportment; and all remarks, which would\r\ntend to wound the feelings of another.\r\n\r\nThere is a serious defect, in the manners of the American people,\r\nespecially in the free States, which can never be efficiently remedied,\r\nexcept in the domestic circle, and during early life. It is a deficiency\r\nin the free expression of kindly feelings and sympathetic emotions, and\r\na want of courtesy in deportment. The causes, which have led to this\r\nresult, may easily be traced.\r\n\r\nThe forefathers of this Nation, to a wide extent, were men who were\r\ndriven from their native land, by laws and customs which they believed\r\nto be opposed both to civil and religious freedom. The sufferings they\r\nwere called to endure, the subduing of those gentler feelings which bind\r\nus to country, kindred, and home, and the constant subordination of the\r\npassions to stern principle, induced characters of great firmness and\r\nself-control. They gave up the comforts and refinements of a civilized\r\ncountry, and came, as pilgrims, to a hard soil, a cold clime, and a\r\nheathen shore. They were continually forced to encounter danger,\r\nprivations, sickness, loneliness, and death; and all these, their\r\nreligion taught them to meet with calmness, fortitude, and submission.\r\nAnd thus it became the custom and habit of the whole mass, to repress,\r\nrather than to encourage, the expression of feeling.\r\n\r\nPersons who are called to constant and protracted suffering and\r\nprivation, are forced to subdue and conceal emotion; for the free\r\nexpression of it would double their own suffering, and increase the\r\nsufferings of others. Those, only, who are free from care and anxiety,\r\nand whose minds are mainly occupied by cheerful emotions, are at full\r\nliberty to unveil their feelings.\r\n\r\nIt was under such stern and rigorous discipline, that the first children\r\nin New England were reared; and the manners and habits of parents are\r\nusually, to a great extent, transmitted to children. Thus it comes to\r\npass, that the descendants of the Puritans, now scattered over every\r\npart of the Nation, are predisposed to conceal the gentler emotions,\r\nwhile their manners are calm, decided, and cold, rather than free and\r\nimpulsive. Of course, there are very many exceptions to these\r\npredominating results.\r\n\r\nThe causes, to which we may attribute a general want of courtesy in\r\nmanners, are certain incidental results of our democratic institutions.\r\nOur ancestors, and their descendants, have constantly been combating the\r\naristocratic principle, which would exalt one class of men at the\r\nexpense of another. They have had to contend with this principle, not\r\nonly in civil, but in social, life. Almost every American, in his own\r\nperson, as well as in behalf of his class, has had to assume and defend\r\nthe main principle of democracy,--that every man's feelings and\r\ninterests are equal in value to those of every other man. But, in doing\r\nthis, there has been some want of clear discrimination. Because claims,\r\nbased on distinctions of mere birth, fortune, or position, were found to\r\nbe injurious, many have gone to the extreme of inferring that all\r\ndistinctions, involving subordination, are useless. Such, would regard\r\nchildren as equals to parents, pupils to teachers, domestics to their\r\nemployers, and subjects to magistrates; and that, too, in all respects.\r\n\r\nThe fact, that certain grades of superiority and subordination are\r\nneedful, both for individual and public benefit, has not been clearly\r\ndiscerned; and there has been a gradual tendency to an extreme, which\r\nhas sensibly affected our manners. All the proprieties and courtesies,\r\nwhich depend on the recognition of the relative duties of superior and\r\nsubordinate, have been warred upon; and thus we see, to an increasing\r\nextent, disrespectful treatment of parents, from children; of teachers,\r\nfrom pupils; of employers, from domestics; and of the aged, from the\r\nyoung. In all classes and circles, there is a gradual decay in courtesy\r\nof address.\r\n\r\nIn cases, too, where kindness is rendered, it is often accompanied with\r\na cold, unsympathizing manner, which greatly lessens its value, while\r\nkindness or politeness is received in a similar style of coolness, as if\r\nit were but the payment of a just due.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to these causes, that the American people, especially the\r\ninhabitants of New England, do not do themselves justice. For, while\r\nthose, who are near enough to learn their real character and feelings,\r\ncan discern the most generous impulses, and the most kindly sympathies,\r\nthey are so veiled, in a composed and indifferent demeanor, as to be\r\nalmost entirely concealed from strangers.\r\n\r\nThese defects in our national manners, it especially falls to the care\r\nof mothers, and all who have charge of the young, to rectify; and if\r\nthey seriously undertake the matter, and wisely adapt means to ends,\r\nthese defects will be remedied. With reference to this object, the\r\nfollowing ideas are suggested.\r\n\r\nThe law of Christianity and of democracy, which teaches that all men are\r\nborn equal, and that their interests and feelings should be regarded as\r\nof equal value, seems to be adopted in aristocratic circles, with\r\nexclusive reference to the class in which the individual moves. The\r\ncourtly gentleman, addresses all of his own class with politeness and\r\nrespect; and, in all his actions, seems to allow that the feelings and\r\nconvenience of others are to be regarded, the same as his own. But his\r\ndemeanor to those of inferior station, is not based on the same rule.\r\n\r\nAmong those, who make up aristocratic circles, such as are above them,\r\nare deemed of superior, and such as are below, of inferior, value. Thus,\r\nif a young, ignorant, and vicious coxcomb, happens to be born a lord,\r\nthe aged, the virtuous, the learned, and the wellbred, of another class,\r\nmust give his convenience the precedence, and must address him in terms\r\nof respect. So, when a man of noble birth is thrown among the lower\r\nclasses, he demeans himself in a style, which, to persons of his own\r\nclass, would be deemed the height of assumption and rudeness.\r\n\r\nNow, the principles of democracy require, that the same courtesy, which\r\nwe accord to our own circle, shall be extended to every class and\r\ncondition; and that distinctions, of superiority and subordination,\r\nshall depend, not on accidents of birth, fortune, or occupation, but\r\nsolely on those relations, which the good of all classes equally\r\nrequire. The distinctions demanded, in a democratic state, are simply\r\nthose, which result from relations, that are common to every class, and\r\nare for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nIt is for the benefit of every class, that children be subordinate to\r\nparents, pupils to teachers, the employed to their employers, and\r\nsubjects to magistrates. In addition to this, it is for the general\r\nwellbeing, that the comfort or convenience of the delicate and feeble,\r\nshould be preferred to that of the strong and healthy, who would suffer\r\nless by any deprivation, and that precedence should be given to their\r\nelders, by the young, and that reverence should be given to the hoary\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe rules of good-breeding, in a democratic state, must be founded on\r\nthese principles. It is, indeed, assumed, that the value of the\r\nhappiness of each individual, is the same as that of every other; but,\r\nas there must be occasions, where there are advantages which all cannot\r\nenjoy, there must be general rules for regulating a selection.\r\nOtherwise, there would be constant scrambling, among those of equal\r\nclaims, and brute force must be the final resort; in which case the\r\nstrongest would have the best of every thing. The democratic rule, then,\r\nis, that superiors, in age, station, or office, have precedence of\r\nsubordinates; age and feebleness, of youth and strength; and the feebler\r\nsex, of more vigorous man.[M]\r\n\r\nThere is, also, a style of deportment and address, which is appropriate\r\nto these different relations. It is suitable for a superior to secure\r\ncompliance with his wishes, from those subordinate to him, by commands;\r\nbut a subordinate must secure compliance with his wishes, from a\r\nsuperior, by requests. It is suitable for a parent, teacher, or\r\nemployer, to admonish for neglect of duty; but not for an inferior to\r\nadopt such a course towards a superior. It is suitable for a superior to\r\ntake precedence of a subordinate, without any remark; but not for an\r\ninferior, without previously asking leave, or offering an apology. It is\r\nproper for a superior to use language and manners of freedom and\r\nfamiliarity, which would be improper from a subordinate to a superior.\r\n\r\nThe want of due regard to these proprieties, occasions the chief defect\r\nin American manners. It is very common to hear children talk to their\r\nparents, in a style proper only between companions and equals; so, also,\r\nthe young address their elders, those employed, their employers, and\r\ndomestics, the members of the family and their visiters, in a style,\r\nwhich is inappropriate to their relative positions. A respectful address\r\nis required not merely towards superiors; every person desires to be\r\ntreated with courtesy and respect, and therefore, the law of benevolence\r\ndemands such demeanor, towards all whom we meet in the social\r\nintercourse of life. \"Be ye courteous,\" is the direction of the Apostle\r\nin reference to our treatment of _all_.\r\n\r\nGood-manners can be successfully cultivated, only in early life, and in\r\nthe domestic circle. There is nothing which depends so much upon\r\n_habit_, as the constantly recurring proprieties of good-breeding; and,\r\nif a child grows up without forming such habits, it is very rarely the\r\ncase that they can be formed at a later period. The feeling, that it is\r\nof little consequence how we behave at home, if we conduct properly\r\nabroad, is a very fallacious one. Persons, who are careless and ill bred\r\nat home, may imagine that they can assume good-manners abroad; but they\r\nmistake. Fixed habits of tone, manner, language, and movements, cannot\r\nbe suddenly altered; and those who are illbred at home, even when they\r\ntry to hide their bad habits, are sure to violate many of the obvious\r\nrules of propriety, and yet be unconscious of it.\r\n\r\nAnd there is nothing, which would so effectually remove prejudice\r\nagainst our democratic institutions, as the general cultivation of\r\ngood-breeding in the domestic circle. Good-manners are the exterior of\r\nbenevolence, the minute and often recurring exhibitions of \"peace and\r\ngood-will;\" and the nation, as well as the individual, which most excels\r\nin the external, as well as the internal, principle, will be most\r\nrespected and beloved.\r\n\r\nThe following are the leading points, which claim attention from those\r\nwho have the care of the young.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, in the family, there should be required, a strict\r\nattention to the rules of precedence, and those modes of address\r\nappropriate to the various relations to be sustained. Children should\r\nalways be required to offer their superiors, in age or station, the\r\nprecedence in all comforts and conveniences, and always address them in\r\na respectful tone and manner. The custom of adding \"Sir,\" or \"Ma'am,\" to\r\n\"Yes,\" or \"No,\" is valuable, as a perpetual indication of a respectful\r\nrecognition of superiority. It is now going out of fashion, even among\r\nthe most wellbred people; probably from a want of consideration of its\r\nimportance. Every remnant of courtesy of address, in our customs, should\r\nbe carefully cherished, by all who feel a value for the proprieties of\r\ngood-breeding.\r\n\r\nIf parents allow their children to talk to them, and to the grown\r\npersons in the family, in the same style in which they address each\r\nother, it will be vain to hope for the courtesy of manner and tone,\r\nwhich good-breeding demands in the general intercourse of society. In a\r\nlarge family, where the elder children are grown up, and the younger are\r\nsmall, it is important to require the latter to treat the elder as\r\nsuperiors. There are none, so ready as young children to assume airs of\r\nequality; and, if they are allowed to treat one class of superiors in\r\nage and character disrespectfully, they will soon use the privilege\r\nuniversally. This is the reason, why the youngest children of a family\r\nare most apt to be pert, forward, and unmannerly.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be aimed at, is, to require children always to\r\nacknowledge every act of kindness and attention, either by words or\r\nmanner. If they are so trained as always to make grateful\r\nacknowledgements, when receiving favors, one of the objectionable\r\nfeatures in American manners will be avoided.\r\n\r\nAgain, children should be required to ask leave, whenever they wish to\r\ngratify curiosity, or use an article which belongs to another. And if\r\ncases occur, when they cannot comply with the rules of good-breeding,\r\nas, for instance, when they must step between a person and the fire, or\r\ntake the chair of an older person, they should be required either to ask\r\nleave, or to offer an apology.\r\n\r\nThere is another point of good-breeding, which cannot, in all cases, be\r\nunderstood and applied by children, in its widest extent. It is that,\r\nwhich requires us to avoid all remarks which tend to embarrass, vex,\r\nmortify, or in any way wound the feelings, of another. To notice\r\npersonal defects; to allude to others' faults, or the faults of their\r\nfriends; to speak disparagingly of the sect or party to which a person\r\nbelongs; to be inattentive, when addressed in conversation; to\r\ncontradict flatly; to speak in contemptuous tones of opinions expressed\r\nby another;--all these, are violations of the rules of good-breeding,\r\nwhich children should be taught to regard. Under this head, comes the\r\npractice of whispering, and staring about, when a teacher, or lecturer,\r\nor clergyman, is addressing a class or audience. Such inattention, is\r\npractically saying, that what the person is uttering is not worth\r\nattending to; and persons of real good-breeding always avoid it. Loud\r\ntalking and laughing, in a large assembly, even when no exercises are\r\ngoing on; yawning and gaping in company; and not looking in the face a\r\nperson who is addressing you, are deemed marks of ill-breeding.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of good-manners, relates to the duties of hospitality.\r\nPoliteness requires us to welcome visiters with cordiality; to offer\r\nthem the best accommodations; to address conversation to them; and to\r\nexpress, by tone and manner, kindness and respect. Offering the hand to\r\nall visiters, at one's own house, is a courteous and hospitable custom;\r\nand a cordial shake of the hand, when friends meet, would abate much of\r\nthe coldness of manner ascribed to Americans.\r\n\r\nThe last point of good-breeding, to be noticed, refers to the\r\nconventional rules of propriety and good taste. Of these, the first\r\nclass relates to the avoidance of all disgusting or offensive personal\r\nhabits, such as fingering the hair; cleaning the teeth or nails; picking\r\nthe nose; spitting on carpets; snuffing, instead of using a\r\nhandkerchief, or using the article in an offensive manner; lifting up\r\nthe boots or shoes, as some men do, to tend them on the knee, or to\r\nfinger them;--all these tricks, either at home or in society, children\r\nshould be taught to avoid.\r\n\r\nAnother branch, under this head, may be called _table manners_. To\r\npersons of good-breeding, nothing is more annoying, than violating the\r\nconventional proprieties of the table. Reaching over another person's\r\nplate; standing up, to reach distant articles, instead of asking to have\r\nthem passed; using one's own knife, and spoon, for butter, salt, or\r\nsugar, when it is the custom of the family to provide separate utensils\r\nfor the purpose; setting cups, with tea dripping from them, on the\r\ntablecloth, instead of the mats or small plates furnished; using the\r\ntablecloth, instead of the napkins; eating fast, and in a noisy manner;\r\nputting large pieces in the mouth; looking and eating as if very hungry,\r\nor as if anxious to get at certain dishes; sitting at too great a\r\ndistance from the table, and dropping food; laying the knife and fork on\r\nthe tablecloth, instead of on the bread, or the edge of the plate;--all\r\nthese particulars, children should be taught to avoid. It is always\r\ndesirable, too, to require children, when at table with grown persons,\r\nto be silent, except when addressed by others; or else their chattering\r\nwill interrupt the conversation and comfort of their elders. They should\r\nalways be required, too, to wait, _in silence_, till all the older\r\npersons are helped.\r\n\r\nAll these things should be taught to children, gradually, and with great\r\npatience and gentleness. Some parents, with whom good-manners is a great\r\nobject, are in danger of making their children perpetually\r\nuncomfortable, by suddenly surrounding them with so many rules, that\r\nthey must inevitably violate some one or other, a great part of the\r\ntime. It is much better to begin with a few rules, and be steady and\r\npersevering with these, till a habit is formed, and then take a few\r\nmore, thus making the process easy and gradual. Otherwise, the temper of\r\nchildren will be injured; or, hopeless of fulfilling so many\r\nrequisitions, they will become reckless and indifferent to all.\r\n\r\nBut, in reference to those who have enjoyed advantages for the\r\ncultivation of good-manners, and who duly estimate its importance, one\r\ncaution is necessary. Those, who never have had such habits formed in\r\nyouth, are under disadvantages, which no benevolence of temper can\r\nremedy. They may often violate the tastes and feelings of others, not\r\nfrom a want of proper regard for them, but from ignorance of custom, or\r\nwant of habit, or abstraction of mind, or from other causes, which\r\ndemand forbearance and sympathy, rather than displeasure. An ability to\r\nbear patiently with defects in manners, and to make candid and\r\nconsiderate allowance for a want of advantages, or for peculiarities in\r\nmental habits, is one mark of the benevolence of real good-breeding.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of monarchical and aristocratic institutions, have always\r\nhad great plausibility given to their views, by the seeming tendencies\r\nto insubordination and bad-manners, of our institutions. And it has been\r\ntoo indiscriminately conceded, by the defenders of the latter, that such\r\nare these tendencies, and that the offensive points, in American\r\nmanners, are the necessary result of democratic principles.\r\n\r\nBut it is believed, that both facts and reasoning are in opposition to\r\nthis opinion. The following extract from the work of De Tocqueville,\r\nexhibits the opinion of an impartial observer, when comparing American\r\nmanners with those of the English, who are confessedly the most\r\naristocratic of all people.\r\n\r\nHe previously remarks on the tendency of aristocracy to make men more\r\nsympathizing with persons of their own peculiar class, and less so\r\ntowards those of lower degree; and he then contrasts American manners\r\nwith the English, claiming that the Americans are much the most affable,\r\nmild, and social. \"In America, where the privileges of birth never\r\nexisted, and where riches confer no peculiar rights on their possessors,\r\nmen acquainted with each other are very ready to frequent the same\r\nplaces, and find neither peril nor advantage in the free interchange of\r\ntheir thoughts. If they meet, by accident, they neither seek nor avoid\r\nintercourse; their manner is therefore natural, frank, and open.\" \"If\r\ntheir demeanor is often cold and serious, it is never haughty or\r\nconstrained.\" But an \"aristocratic pride is still extremely great among\r\nthe English; and, as the limits of aristocracy are ill-defined, every\r\nbody lives in constant dread, lest advantage should be taken of his\r\nfamiliarity. Unable to judge, at once, of the social position of those\r\nhe meets, an Englishman prudently avoids all contact with them. Men are\r\nafraid, lest some slight service rendered should draw them into an\r\nunsuitable acquaintance; they dread civilities, and they avoid the\r\nobtrusive gratitude of a stranger, as much as his hatred.\"\r\n\r\nThus, _facts_ seem to show that when the most aristocratic nation in the\r\nworld is compared, as to manners, with the most democratic, the\r\njudgement of strangers is in favor of the latter.\r\n\r\nAnd if good-manners are the outward exhibition of the democratic\r\nprinciple of impartial benevolence and equal rights, surely the nation\r\nwhich adopts this rule, both in social and civil life, is the most\r\nlikely to secure the desirable exterior. The aristocrat, by his\r\nprinciples, extends the exterior of impartial benevolence to his own\r\nclass, only; the democratic principle, requires it to be extended _to\r\nall_.\r\n\r\nThere is reason, therefore, to hope and expect more refined and polished\r\nmanners in America, than in any other land; while all the developements\r\nof taste and refinement, such as poetry, music, painting, sculpture, and\r\narchitecture, it may be expected, will come to a higher state of\r\nperfection, here, than in any other nation.\r\n\r\nIf this Country increases in virtue and intelligence, as it may, there\r\nis no end to the wealth which will pour in as the result of our\r\nresources of climate, soil, and navigation, and the skill, industry,\r\nenergy, and enterprise, of our countrymen. This wealth, if used as\r\nintelligence and virtue dictate, will furnish the means for a superior\r\neducation to all classes, and every facility for the refinement of\r\ntaste, intellect, and feeling.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in this Country, labor is ceasing to be the badge of a lower\r\nclass; so that already it is disreputable for a man to be \"a lazy\r\ngentleman.\" And this feeling must increase, till there is such an\r\nequalisation of labor, as will afford all the time needful for every\r\nclass to improve the many advantages offered to them. Already, in\r\nBoston, through the munificence of some of her citizens, there are\r\nliterary and scientific advantages, offered to all classes, rarely\r\nenjoyed elsewhere. In Cincinnati, too, the advantages of education, now\r\noffered to the poorest classes, without charge, surpass what, some years\r\nago, most wealthy men could purchase, for any price. And it is believed,\r\nthat a time will come, when the poorest boy in America can secure\r\nadvantages, which will equal what the heir of the proudest peerage can\r\nnow command.\r\n\r\nThe records of the courts of France and Germany, (as detailed by the\r\nDuchess of Orleans,) in and succeeding the brilliant reign of Louis the\r\nFourteenth,--a period which was deemed the acme of elegance and\r\nrefinement,--exhibit a grossness, a vulgarity, and a coarseness, not to\r\nbe found among the lowest of our respectable poor. And the biography of\r\nBeau Nash, who attempted to reform the manners of the gentry, in the\r\ntimes of Queen Anne, exhibits violations of the rules of decency among\r\nthe aristocracy, which the commonest yeoman of this Land would feel\r\ndisgraced in perpetrating.\r\n\r\nThis shows, that our lowest classes, at this period, are more refined,\r\nthan were the highest in aristocratic lands, a hundred years ago; and\r\nanother century may show the lowest classes, in wealth, in this Country,\r\nattaining as high a polish, as adorns those who now are leaders of\r\ngood-manners in the courts of kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[M] The universal practice of this Nation, in thus giving precedence to\r\nwoman, has been severely commented on by Miss Martineau and some others,\r\nwho would transfer all the business of the other sex to women, and then\r\nhave them treated like men. May this evidence of our superior\r\ncivilisation and Christianity increase, rather than diminish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nON THE PRESERVATION OF A GOOD TEMPER IN A HOUSEKEEPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, which has a more abiding influence on the happiness of\r\na family, than the preservation of equable and cheerful temper and tones\r\nin the housekeeper. A woman, who is habitually gentle, sympathizing,\r\nforbearing, and cheerful, carries an atmosphere about her, which\r\nimparts a soothing and sustaining influence, and renders it easier for\r\nall to do right, under her administration, than in any other situation.\r\n\r\nThe writer has known families, where the mother's presence seemed the\r\nsunshine of the circle around her; imparting a cheering and vivifying\r\npower, scarcely realized, till it was withdrawn. Every one, without\r\nthinking of it, or knowing why it was so, experienced a peaceful and\r\ninvigorating influence, as soon as he entered the sphere illumined by\r\nher smile, and sustained by her cheering kindness and sympathy. On the\r\ncontrary, many a good housekeeper, (good in every respect but this,) by\r\nwearing a countenance of anxiety and dissatisfaction, and by indulging\r\nin the frequent use of sharp and reprehensive tones, more than destroys\r\nall the comfort which otherwise would result from her system, neatness,\r\nand economy.\r\n\r\nThere is a secret, social sympathy, which every mind, to a greater or\r\nless degree, experiences with the feelings of those around, as they are\r\nmanifested by the countenance and voice. A sorrowful, a discontented, or\r\nan angry, countenance, produces a silent, sympathetic influence,\r\nimparting a sombre shade to the mind, while tones of anger or complaint\r\nstill more effectually jar the spirits.\r\n\r\nNo person can maintain a quiet and cheerful frame of mind, while tones\r\nof discontent and displeasure are sounding on the ear. We may gradually\r\naccustom ourselves to the evil, till it is partially diminished; but it\r\nalways is an evil, which greatly interferes with the enjoyment of the\r\nfamily state. There are sometimes cases, where the entrance of the\r\nmistress of a family seems to awaken a slight apprehension, in every\r\nmind around, as if each felt in danger of a reproof, for something\r\neither perpetrated or neglected. A woman, who should go around her house\r\nwith a small stinging snapper, which she habitually applied to those\r\nwhom she met, would be encountered with feelings very much like to\r\nthose which are experienced by the inmates of a family, where the\r\nmistress often uses her countenance and voice, to inflict similar\r\npenalties for duties neglected.\r\n\r\nYet, there are many allowances to be made for housekeepers, who\r\nsometimes imperceptibly and unconsciously fall into such habits. A\r\nwoman, who attempts to carry out any plans of system, order, and\r\neconomy, and who has her feelings and habits conformed to certain rules,\r\nis constantly liable to have her plans crossed, and her taste violated,\r\nby the inexperience or inattention of those about her. And no\r\nhousekeeper, whatever may be her habits, can escape the frequent\r\nrecurrence of negligence or mistake, which interferes with her plans. It\r\nis probable, that there is no class of persons, in the world, who have\r\nsuch incessant trials of temper, and temptations to be fretful, as\r\nAmerican housekeepers. For a housekeeper's business is not, like that of\r\nthe other sex, limited to a particular department, for which previous\r\npreparation is made. It consists of ten thousand little disconnected\r\nitems, which can never be so systematically arranged, that there is no\r\ndaily jostling, somewhere. And in the best-regulated families, it is not\r\nunfrequently the case, that some act of forgetfulness or carelessness,\r\nfrom some member, will disarrange the business of the whole day, so that\r\nevery hour will bring renewed occasion for annoyance. And the more\r\nstrongly a woman realizes the value of time, and the importance of\r\nsystem and order, the more will she be tempted to irritability and\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nThe following considerations, may aid in preparing a woman to meet such\r\ndaily crosses, with even a cheerful temper and tones.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a woman, who has charge of a large household, should\r\nregard her duties as dignified, important, and difficult. The mind is so\r\nmade, as to be elevated and cheered by a sense of far-reaching influence\r\nand usefulness. A woman, who feels that she is a cipher, and that it\r\nmakes little difference how she performs her duties, has far less to\r\nsustain and invigorate her, than one, who truly estimates the\r\nimportance of her station. A man, who feels that the destinies of a\r\nnation are turning on the judgement and skill with which he plans and\r\nexecutes, has a pressure of motive, and an elevation of feeling, which\r\nare great safeguards from all that is low, trivial, and degrading.\r\n\r\nSo, an American mother and housekeeper, who looks at her position in the\r\naspect presented in the previous pages, and who rightly estimates the\r\nlong train of influences which will pass down to thousands, whose\r\ndestinies, from generation to generation, will be modified by those\r\ndecisions of her will, which regulated the temper, principles, and\r\nhabits, of her family, must be elevated above petty temptations, which\r\nwould otherwise assail her.\r\n\r\nAgain, a housekeeper should feel that she really has great difficulties\r\nto meet and overcome. A person, who wrongly thinks there is little\r\ndanger, can never maintain so faithful a guard, as one who rightly\r\nestimates the temptations which beset her. Nor can one, who thinks that\r\nthey are trifling difficulties which she has to encounter, and trivial\r\ntemptations, to which she must yield, so much enjoy the just reward of\r\nconscious virtue and self-control, as one who takes an opposite view of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nA third method, is, for a woman deliberately to calculate on having her\r\nbest-arranged plans interfered with, very often; and to be in such a\r\nstate of preparation, that the evil will not come unawares. So\r\ncomplicated are the pursuits, and so diverse the habits of the various\r\nmembers of a family, that it is almost impossible for every one to avoid\r\ninterfering with the plans and taste of a housekeeper, in some one point\r\nor another. It is, therefore, most wise, for a woman to keep the loins\r\nof her mind ever girt, to meet such collisions with a cheerful and quiet\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nAnother important rule, is, to form all plans and arrangements in\r\nconsistency with the means at command, and the character of those\r\naround. A woman, who has a heedless husband, and young children, and\r\nincompetent domestics, ought not to make such plans, as one may properly\r\nform, who will not, in so many directions, meet embarrassment. She must\r\naim at just so much as she can probably secure, and no more; and thus\r\nshe will usually escape much temptation, and much of the irritation of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe fifth, and a very important, consideration, is, that _system_,\r\n_economy_, and _neatness_, are valuable, only so far as they tend to\r\npromote the comfort and wellbeing of those affected. Some women seem to\r\nact under the impression, that these advantages _must_ be secured, at\r\nall events, even if the comfort of the family be the sacrifice. True, it\r\nis very important that children grow up in habits of system, neatness,\r\nand order; and it is very desirable that the mother give them every\r\nincentive, both by precept and example: but it is still more important,\r\nthat they grow up with amiable tempers, that they learn to meet the\r\ncrosses of life with patience and cheerfulness; and nothing has a\r\ngreater influence to secure this, than a mother's example. Whenever,\r\ntherefore, a woman cannot accomplish her plans of neatness and order,\r\nwithout injury to her own temper, or to the temper of others, she ought\r\nto modify and reduce them, until she can.\r\n\r\nThe sixth method, relates to the government of the tones of voice. In\r\nmany cases, when a woman's domestic arrangements are suddenly and\r\nseriously crossed, it is impossible not to feel some irritation. But it\r\n_is_ always possible to refrain from angry tones. A woman can resolve,\r\nthat, whatever happens, she will not speak, till she can do it in a calm\r\nand gentle manner. _Perfect silence_ is a safe resort, when such control\r\ncannot be attained, as enables a person to speak calmly; and this\r\ndetermination, persevered in, will eventually be crowned with success.\r\n\r\nMany persons seem to imagine, that tones of anger are needful, in order\r\nto secure prompt obedience. But observation has convinced the writer\r\nthat they are _never_ necessary; that _in all cases_, reproof,\r\nadministered in calm tones, would be better. A case will be given in\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nA young girl had been repeatedly charged to avoid a certain arrangement\r\nin cooking. On one day, when company was invited to dine, the direction\r\nwas forgotten, and the consequence was, an accident, which disarranged\r\nevery thing, seriously injured the principal dish, and delayed dinner\r\nfor an hour. The mistress of the family entered the kitchen, just as it\r\noccurred, and, at a glance, saw the extent of the mischief. For a\r\nmoment, her eyes flashed, and her cheeks glowed; but she held her peace.\r\nAfter a minute or so, she gave directions, in a calm voice, as to the\r\nbest mode of retrieving the evil, and then left, without a word said to\r\nthe offender.\r\n\r\nAfter the company left, she sent for the girl, alone, and in a calm and\r\nkind manner pointed out the aggravations of the case, and described the\r\ntrouble which had been caused to her husband, her visiters, and herself.\r\nShe then portrayed the future evils which would result from such habits\r\nof neglect and inattention, and the modes of attempting to overcome\r\nthem; and then offered a reward for the future, if, in a given time, she\r\nsucceeded in improving in this respect. Not a tone of anger was uttered;\r\nand yet the severest scolding of a practised Xantippe could not have\r\nsecured such contrition, and determination to reform, as was gained by\r\nthis method.\r\n\r\nBut similar negligence is often visited by a continuous stream of\r\ncomplaint and reproof, which, in most cases, is met, either by sullen\r\nsilence, or impertinent retort, while anger prevents any contrition, or\r\nany resolution of future amendment.\r\n\r\nIt is very certain, that some ladies do carry forward a most efficient\r\ngovernment, both of children and domestics, without employing tones of\r\nanger; and therefore they are not indispensable, nor on any account\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThough some ladies, of intelligence and refinement, do fall\r\nunconsciously into such a practice, it is certainly very unlady-like,\r\nand in very bad taste, to _scold_; and the further a woman departs from\r\nall approach to it, the more perfectly she sustains her character as a\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nAnother method of securing equanimity, amid the trials of domestic life,\r\nis, to cultivate a habit of making allowances for the difficulties,\r\nignorance, or temptations, of those who violate rule or neglect duty. It\r\nis vain, and most unreasonable, to expect the consideration and care of\r\na mature mind, in childhood and youth; or that persons, of such limited\r\nadvantages as most domestics have enjoyed, should practise proper\r\nself-control, and possess proper habits and principles.\r\n\r\nEvery parent, and every employer, needs daily to cultivate the spirit\r\nexpressed in the Divine prayer, \"forgive us our trespasses, as we\r\nforgive those who trespass against us.\" The same allowances and\r\nforbearance, which we supplicate from our Heavenly Father, and desire\r\nfrom our fellow-men, in reference to our own deficiencies, we should\r\nconstantly aim to extend to all, who cross our feelings and interfere\r\nwith our plans.\r\n\r\nThe last, and most important, mode of securing a placid and cheerful\r\ntemper and tones, is, by a right view of the doctrine of a\r\nsuperintending Providence. All persons are too much in the habit of\r\nregarding the more important events of life, as exclusively under the\r\ncontrol of Perfect Wisdom. But the fall of a sparrow, or the loss of a\r\nhair, they do not feel to be equally the result of His directing agency.\r\nIn consequence of this, Christian persons, who aim at perfect and\r\ncheerful submission to heavy afflictions, and who succeed, to the\r\nedification of all about them, are sometimes sadly deficient under petty\r\ncrosses. If a beloved child be laid in the grave, even if its death\r\nresulted from the carelessness of a domestic, or of a physician, the eye\r\nis turned from the subordinate agent, to the Supreme Guardian of all,\r\nand to Him they bow, without murmur or complaint. But if a pudding be\r\nburnt, or a room badly swept, or an errand forgotten, then vexation and\r\ncomplaint are allowed, just as if these events were not appointed by\r\nPerfect Wisdom, as much as the sorer chastisement.\r\n\r\nA woman, therefore, needs to cultivate the _habitual_ feeling, that all\r\nthe events of her nursery and kitchen, are brought about by the\r\npermission of our Heavenly Father, and that fretfulness or complaint, in\r\nregard to these, is, in fact, complaining and disputing at the\r\nappointments of God, and is really as sinful, as unsubmissive murmurs\r\namid the sorer chastisements of His hand. And a woman, who cultivates\r\nthis habit of referring all the minor trials of life to the wise and\r\nbenevolent agency of a Heavenly Parent, and daily seeks His sympathy and\r\naid, to enable her to meet them with a quiet and cheerful spirit, will\r\nsoon find it the perennial spring of abiding peace and content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nON HABITS OF SYSTEM AND ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the question of the equality of the sexes, in\r\nintellectual capacity, seems frivolous and useless, both because it can\r\nnever be decided, and because there would be no possible advantage in\r\nthe decision. But one topic, which is often drawn into this discussion,\r\nis of far more consequence; and that is, the relative importance and\r\ndifficulty of the duties a woman is called to perform.\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed, and almost as generally conceded, that woman's\r\nbusiness and cares are contracted and trivial; and that the proper\r\ndischarge of her duties, demands far less expansion of mind and vigor of\r\nintellect, than the pursuits of the other sex. This idea has prevailed,\r\nbecause women, as a mass, have never been educated with reference to\r\ntheir most important duties; while that portion of their employments,\r\nwhich is of least value, has been regarded as the chief, if not the\r\nsole, concern of a woman. The covering of the body, the conveniences of\r\nresidences, and the gratification of the appetite, have been too much\r\nregarded as the sole objects, on which her intellectual powers are to be\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\nBut, as society gradually shakes off the remnants of barbarism, and the\r\nintellectual and moral interests of man rise, in estimation, above the\r\nmerely sensual, a truer estimate is formed of woman's duties, and of the\r\nmeasure of intellect requisite for the proper discharge of them. Let any\r\nman, of sense and discernment, become the member of a large household,\r\nin which, a well-educated and pious woman is endeavoring systematically\r\nto discharge her multiform duties; let him fully comprehend all her\r\ncares, difficulties, and perplexities; and it is probable he would\r\ncoincide in the opinion, that no statesman, at the head of a nation's\r\naffairs, had more frequent calls for wisdom, firmness, tact,\r\ndiscrimination, prudence, and versatility of talent, than such a woman.\r\n\r\nShe has a husband, to whose peculiar tastes and habits she must\r\naccommodate herself; she has children, whose health she must guard,\r\nwhose physical constitutions she must study and develope, whose temper\r\nand habits she must regulate, whose principles she must form, whose\r\npursuits she must direct. She has constantly changing domestics, with\r\nall varieties of temper and habits, whom she must govern, instruct, and\r\ndirect; she is required to regulate the finances of the domestic state,\r\nand constantly to adapt expenditures to the means and to the relative\r\nclaims of each department. She has the direction of the kitchen, where\r\nignorance, forgetfulness, and awkwardness, are to be so regulated, that\r\nthe various operations shall each start at the right time, and all be in\r\ncompleteness at the same given hour. She has the claims of society to\r\nmeet, calls to receive and return, and the duties of hospitality to\r\nsustain. She has the poor to relieve; benevolent societies to aid; the\r\nschools of her children to inquire and decide about; the care of the\r\nsick; the nursing of infancy; and the endless miscellany of odd items,\r\nconstantly recurring in a large family.\r\n\r\nSurely, it is a pernicious and mistaken idea, that the duties, which tax\r\na woman's mind, are petty, trivial, or unworthy of the highest grade of\r\nintellect and moral worth. Instead of allowing this feeling, every woman\r\nshould imbibe, from early youth, the impression, that she is training\r\nfor the discharge of the most important, the most difficult, and the\r\nmost sacred and interesting duties that can possibly employ the highest\r\nintellect. She ought to feel, that her station and responsibilities, in\r\nthe great drama of life, are second to none, either as viewed by her\r\nMaker, or in the estimation of all minds whose judgement is most worthy\r\nof respect.\r\n\r\nShe, who is the mother and housekeeper in a large family, is the\r\nsovereign of an empire, demanding more varied cares, and involving more\r\ndifficult duties, than are really exacted of her, who, while she wears\r\nthe crown, and professedly regulates the interests of the greatest\r\nnation on earth, finds abundant leisure for theatres, balls, horseraces,\r\nand every gay pursuit.\r\n\r\nThere is no one thing, more necessary to a housekeeper, in performing\r\nher varied duties, than _a habit of system and order_; and yet, the\r\npeculiarly desultory nature of women's pursuits, and the embarrassments\r\nresulting from the state of domestic service in this Country, render it\r\nvery difficult to form such a habit. But it is sometimes the case, that\r\nwomen, who could and would carry forward a systematic plan of domestic\r\neconomy, do not attempt it, simply from a want of knowledge of the\r\nvarious modes of introducing it. It is with reference to such, that\r\nvarious modes of securing system and order, which the writer has seen\r\nadopted, will be pointed out.\r\n\r\nA wise economy is nowhere more conspicuous, than in the right\r\n_apportionment of time_ to different pursuits. There are duties of a\r\nreligious, intellectual, social, and domestic, nature, each having\r\ndifferent relative claims on attention. Unless a person has some general\r\nplan of apportioning these claims, some will intrench on others, and\r\nsome, it is probable, will be entirely excluded. Thus, some find\r\nreligious, social, and domestic, duties, so numerous, that no time is\r\ngiven to intellectual improvement. Others, find either social, or\r\nbenevolent, or religious, interests, excluded by the extent and variety\r\nof other engagements.\r\n\r\nIt is wise, therefore, for all persons to devise a general plan, which\r\nthey will at least keep in view, and aim to accomplish, and by which, a\r\nproper proportion of time shall be secured, for all the duties of life.\r\n\r\nIn forming such a plan, every woman must accommodate herself to the\r\npeculiarities of her situation. If she has a large family, and a small\r\nincome, she must devote far more time to the simple duty of providing\r\nfood and raiment, than would be right were she in affluence, and with a\r\nsmall family. It is impossible, therefore, to draw out any general plan,\r\nwhich all can adopt. But there are some _general principles_, which\r\nought to be the guiding rules, when a woman arranges her domestic\r\nemployments. These principles are to be based on Christianity, which\r\nteaches us to \"seek first the kingdom of God,\" and to deem food,\r\nraiment, and the conveniences of life, as of secondary account. Every\r\nwoman, then, ought to start with the assumption, that religion is of\r\nmore consequence than any worldly concern, and that, whatever else may\r\nbe sacrificed, this, shall be the leading object, in all her\r\narrangements, in respect to time, money, and attention. It is also one\r\nof the plainest requisitions of Christianity, that we devote some of our\r\ntime and efforts, to the comfort and improvement of others. There is no\r\nduty, so constantly enforced, both in the Old and New Testament, as the\r\nduty of charity, in dispensing to those, who are destitute of the\r\nblessings we enjoy. In selecting objects of charity, the same rule\r\napplies to others, as to ourselves; their moral and religious interests\r\nare of the highest moment, and for them, as well as for ourselves, we\r\nare to \"seek first the kingdom of God.\"\r\n\r\nAnother general principle, is, that our intellectual and social\r\ninterests are to be preferred, to the mere gratification of taste or\r\nappetite. A portion of time, therefore, must be devoted to the\r\ncultivation of the intellect and the social affections.\r\n\r\nAnother, is, that the mere gratification of appetite, is to be placed\r\n_last_ in our estimate; so that, when a question arises, as to which\r\nshall be sacrificed, some intellectual, moral, or social, advantage, or\r\nsome gratification of sense, we should invariably sacrifice the last.\r\n\r\nAnother, is, that, as health is indispensable to the discharge of every\r\nduty, nothing, which sacrifices that blessing, is to be allowed, in\r\norder to gain any other advantage or enjoyment. There are emergencies,\r\nwhen it is right to risk health and life, to save ourselves and others\r\nfrom greater evils; but these are exceptions, which do not militate\r\nagainst the general rule. Many persons imagine, that, if they violate\r\nthe laws of health, in performing religious or domestic duties, they are\r\nguiltless before God. But such greatly mistake. We as directly violate\r\nthe law, \"thou shalt not kill,\" when we do what tends to risk or shorten\r\nour own life, as if we should intentionally run a dagger into a\r\nneighbor. True, we may escape any fatal or permanently injurious\r\neffects, and so may a dagger or bullet miss the mark, or do only\r\ntransient injury. But this, in either case, makes the sin none the less.\r\nThe life and happiness of all His creatures are dear to our Creator; and\r\nHe is as much displeased, when we injure our own interests, as when we\r\ninjure those of others. The idea, therefore, that we are excusable, if\r\nwe harm no one but ourselves, is false and pernicious. These, then, are\r\nthe general principles, to guide a woman in systematizing her duties and\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nThe Creator of all things, is a Being of perfect system and order; and,\r\nto aid us in our duty, in this respect, He has divided our time, by a\r\nregularly returning day of rest from worldly business. In following\r\nthis example, the intervening six days may be subdivided to secure\r\nsimilar benefits. In doing this, a certain portion of time must be given\r\nto procure the means of livelihood, and for preparing food, raiment, and\r\ndwellings. To these objects, some must devote more, and others less,\r\nattention. The remainder of time not necessarily thus employed, might be\r\ndivided somewhat in this manner: The leisure of two afternoons and\r\nevenings, could be devoted to religious and benevolent objects, such as\r\nreligious meetings, charitable associations, school visiting, and\r\nattention to the sick and poor. The leisure of two other days, might be\r\ndevoted to intellectual improvement, and the pursuits of taste. The\r\nleisure of another day, might be devoted to social enjoyments, in making\r\nor receiving visits; and that of another, to miscellaneous domestic\r\npursuits, not included in the other particulars.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that few persons could carry out such an arrangement,\r\nvery strictly; but every one can make a systematic apportionment of\r\ntime, and at least _aim_ at accomplishing it; and they can also compare\r\nthe time which they actually devote to these different objects, with\r\nsuch a general outline, for the purpose of modifying any mistaken\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting any such systematic employment of time, and carrying\r\nit out, so far as they can control circumstances, most women are rather\r\ndriven along, by the daily occurrences of life, so that, instead of\r\nbeing the intelligent regulators of their own time, they are the mere\r\nsport of circumstances. There is nothing, which so distinctly marks the\r\ndifference between weak and strong minds, as the fact, whether they\r\ncontrol circumstances, or circumstances control them.\r\n\r\nIt is very much to be feared, that the apportionment of time, actually\r\nmade by most women, exactly inverts the order, required by reason and\r\nChristianity. Thus, the furnishing a needless variety of food, the\r\nconveniences of dwellings, and the adornments of dress, often take a\r\nlarger portion of time, than is given to any other object. Next after\r\nthis, comes intellectual improvement; and, last of all, benevolence and\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, that it is indispensable for most persons to give more\r\ntime to earn a livelihood, and to prepare food, raiment, and dwellings,\r\nthan to any other object. But it may be asked, how much of the time,\r\ndevoted to these objects, is employed in preparing varieties of food,\r\nnot necessary, but rather injurious, and how much is spent for those\r\nparts of dress and furniture not indispensable, and merely ornamental?\r\nLet a woman subtract from her domestic employments, all the time, given\r\nto pursuits which are of no use, except as they gratify a taste for\r\nornament, or minister increased varieties, to tempt the appetite, and\r\nshe will find, that much, which she calls \"domestic duties,\" and which\r\nprevent her attention to intellectual, benevolent, and religious,\r\nobjects, should be called by a very different name. No woman has a right\r\nto give up attention to the higher interests of herself and others, for\r\nthe ornaments of taste, or the gratification of the palate. To a certain\r\nextent, these lower objects are lawful and desirable; but, when they\r\nintrude on nobler interests, they become selfish and degrading. Every\r\nwoman, then, when employing her hands, in ornamenting her person, her\r\nchildren, or her house, ought to calculate, whether she has devoted _as\r\nmuch_ time, to the intellectual and moral wants of herself and others.\r\nIf she has not, she may know that she is doing wrong, and that her\r\nsystem, for apportioning her time and pursuits, should be altered.\r\n\r\nSome persons, endeavor to systematize their pursuits, by apportioning\r\nthem to particular hours of each day. For example, a certain period\r\nbefore breakfast, is given to devotional duties; after breakfast,\r\ncertain hours are devoted to exercise and domestic employments; other\r\nhours, to sewing, or reading, or visiting; and others, to benevolent\r\nduties. But, in most cases, it is more difficult to systematize the\r\nhours of each day, than it is to secure some regular division of the\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the minutiae of domestic arrangements, the writer has known\r\nthe following methods to be adopted. _Monday_, with some of the best\r\nhousekeepers, is devoted to preparing for the labors of the week. Any\r\nextra cooking, the purchasing of articles to be used during the week,\r\nthe assorting of clothes for the wash, and mending such as would be\r\ninjured without;--these, and similar items, belong to this day.\r\n_Tuesday_ is devoted to washing, and _Wednesday_ to ironing. On\r\n_Thursday_, the ironing is finished off, the clothes are folded and put\r\naway, and all articles, which need mending, are put in the mending\r\nbasket, and attended to. _Friday_ is devoted to sweeping and\r\nhousecleaning. On _Saturday_, and especially the last Saturday of every\r\nmonth, every department is put in order; the castors and table furniture\r\nare regulated, the pantry and cellar inspected, the trunks, drawers, and\r\nclosets arranged, and every thing about the house, put in order for\r\n_Sunday_. All the cooking, needed for Sunday, is also prepared. By this\r\nregular recurrence of a particular time, for inspecting every thing,\r\nnothing is forgotten till ruined by neglect.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of systematizing, relates to providing proper supplies of\r\nconveniences, and proper places in which to keep them. Thus, some ladies\r\nkeep a large closet, in which are placed the tubs, pails, dippers,\r\nsoap-dishes, starch, bluing, clothes-line, clothes-pins, and every other\r\narticle used in washing; and in the same, or another, place, are kept\r\nevery convenience for ironing. In the sewing department, a trunk, with\r\nsuitable partitions, is provided, in which are placed, each in its\r\nproper place, white thread of all sizes, colored thread, yarns for\r\nmending, colored and black sewing-silks and twist, tapes and bobbins of\r\nall sizes, white and colored welting-cords, silk braids and cords,\r\nneedles of all sizes, papers of pins, remnants of linen and colored\r\ncambric, a supply of all kinds of buttons used in the family, black and\r\nwhite hooks and eyes, a yard measure, and all the patterns used in\r\ncutting and fitting. These are done up in separate parcels, and\r\nlabelled. In another trunk, are kept all pieces used in mending,\r\narranged in order, so that any article can be found, without loss of\r\ntime. A trunk, like the first mentioned, will save many steps, and often\r\nmuch time and perplexity; while by purchasing articles thus by the\r\nquantity, they come much cheaper, than if bought in little portions as\r\nthey are wanted. Such a trunk should be kept locked, and a smaller\r\nsupply, for current use, retained in a workbasket.\r\n\r\nA full supply of all conveniences in the kitchen and cellar, and a place\r\nappointed for each article, very much facilitates domestic labor. For\r\nwant of this, much vexation and loss of time is occasioned, while\r\nseeking vessels in use, or in cleansing those employed by different\r\npersons, for various purposes. It would be far better, for a lady to\r\ngive up some expensive article, in the parlor, and apply the money, thus\r\nsaved, for kitchen conveniences, than to have a stinted supply, where\r\nthe most labor is to be performed. If our Countrywomen would devote more\r\nto comfort and convenience, and less to show, it would be a great\r\nimprovement. Expensive mirrors and pier-tables in the parlor, and an\r\nunpainted, gloomy, ill-furnished kitchen, not unfrequently are found\r\nunder the same roof.\r\n\r\nAnother important item, in systematic economy, is, the apportioning of\r\n_regular_ employment to the various members of a family. If a\r\nhousekeeper can secure the cooperation of _all_ her family, she will\r\nfind, that \"many hands make light work.\" There is no greater mistake,\r\nthan in bringing up children to feel that they must be taken care of,\r\nand waited on, by others, without any corresponding obligations on their\r\npart. The extent, to which young children can be made useful, in a\r\nfamily, would seem surprising, to those who have never seen a\r\n_systematic_ and _regular_ plan for securing their services. The writer\r\nhas been in a family, where a little girl, of eight or nine years of\r\nage, washed and dressed herself and young brother, and made their small\r\nbeds, before breakfast, set and cleared all the tables, at meals, with a\r\nlittle help from a grown person in moving tables and spreading cloths,\r\nwhile all the dusting of parlors and chambers was also neatly performed\r\nby her. A brother, of ten years old, brought in and piled all the wood,\r\nused in the kitchen and parlor, brushed the boots and shoes, neatly,\r\nwent on errands, and took all the care of the poultry. They were\r\nchildren, whose parents could afford to hire servants to do this, but\r\nwho chose to have their children grow up healthy and industrious, while\r\nproper instruction, system, and encouragement, made these services\r\nrather a pleasure, than otherwise, to the children.\r\n\r\nSome parents pay their children for such services; but this is\r\nhazardous, as tending to make them feel that they are not bound to be\r\nhelpful without pay, and also as tending to produce a hoarding,\r\nmoney-making spirit. But, where children have no hoarding propensities,\r\nand need to acquire a sense of the value of property, it may be well to\r\nlet them earn money, for some extra services, rather as a favor. When\r\nthis is done, they should be taught to spend it for others, as well as\r\nfor themselves; and in this way, a generous and liberal spirit will be\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nThere are some mothers, who take pains to teach their boys most of the\r\ndomestic arts, which their sisters learn. The writer has seen boys,\r\nmending their own garments, and aiding their mother or sisters in the\r\nkitchen, with great skill and adroitness; and at an early age, they\r\nusually very much relish joining in such occupations. The sons of such\r\nmothers, in their college life, or in roaming about the world, or in\r\nnursing a sick wife or infant, find occasion to bless the forethought\r\nand kindness, which prepared them for such emergencies. Few things are\r\nin worse taste, than for a man needlessly to busy himself in women's\r\nwork; and yet a man never appears in a more interesting attitude, than\r\nwhen, by skill in such matters, he can save a mother or wife from care\r\nand suffering. The more a boy is taught to use his hands, in every\r\nvariety of domestic employment, the more his faculties, both of mind and\r\nbody, are developed; for mechanical pursuits exercise the intellect, as\r\nwell as the hands. The early training of New-England boys, in which they\r\nturn their hand to almost every thing, is one great reason of the quick\r\nperceptions, versatility of mind, and mechanical skill, for which that\r\nportion of our Countrymen is distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe writer has known one mode of systematizing the aid of the older\r\nchildren in a family, which, in some cases of very large families, it\r\nmay be well to imitate. In the case referred to, when the oldest\r\ndaughter was eight or nine years old, an infant sister was given to her,\r\nas her special charge. She tended it, made and mended its clothes,\r\ntaught it to read, and was its nurse and guardian, through all its\r\nchildhood. Another infant was given to the next daughter, and thus the\r\nchildren were all paired in this interesting relation. In addition to\r\nthe relief thus afforded to the mother, the elder children were in this\r\nway qualified for their future domestic relations, and both older and\r\nyounger bound to each other by peculiar ties of tenderness and\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nIn offering these examples, of various modes of systematizing, one\r\nsuggestion may be worthy of attention. It is not unfrequently the case,\r\nthat ladies, who find themselves cumbered with oppressive cares, after\r\nreading remarks on the benefits of system, immediately commence the task\r\nof arranging their pursuits, with great vigor and hope. They divide the\r\nday into regular periods, and give each hour its duty; they systematize\r\ntheir work, and endeavor to bring every thing into a regular routine.\r\nBut, in a short time, they find themselves baffled, discouraged, and\r\ndisheartened, and finally relapse into their former desultory ways, in\r\na sort of resigned despair. The difficulty, in such cases, is, that they\r\nattempt too much at a time. There is nothing, which so much depends upon\r\n_habit_, as a systematic mode of performing duty; and, where no such\r\nhabit has been formed, it is impossible for a novice to start, at once,\r\ninto a universal mode of systematizing, which none but an adept could\r\ncarry through. The only way for such persons, is, to begin with a little\r\nat a time. Let them select some three or four things, and resolutely\r\nattempt to conquer at these points. In time, a habit will be formed, of\r\ndoing a few things at regular periods, and in a systematic way. Then it\r\nwill be easy to add a few more; and thus, by a gradual process, the\r\nobject can be secured, which it would be vain to attempt, by a more\r\nsummary course. Early rising is almost an indispensable condition to\r\nsuccess, in such an effort; but, where a woman lacks either the health\r\nor the energy to secure a period for devotional duties before breakfast,\r\nlet her select that hour of the day, in which she will be least liable\r\nto interruption, and let her then seek strength and wisdom from the only\r\ntrue Source. At this time, let her take a pen, and make a list of all\r\nthe things which she considers as duties. Then, let a calculation be\r\nmade, whether there be time enough, in the day or the week, for all\r\nthese duties. If there be not, let the least important be stricken from\r\nthe list, as not being duties, and which must be omitted. In doing this,\r\nlet a woman remember, that, though \"what we shall eat, and what we shall\r\ndrink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed,\" are matters requiring due\r\nattention, they are very apt to obtain a wrong relative importance,\r\nwhile social, intellectual, and moral, interests, receive too little\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nIn this Country, eating, dressing, and household furniture and\r\nornaments, take far too large a place in the estimate of relative\r\nimportance; and it is probable, that most women could modify their views\r\nand practice, so as to come nearer to the Saviour's requirements. No\r\nwoman has a right to put a stitch of ornament on any article of dress\r\nor furniture, or to provide one superfluity in food, until she is sure\r\nshe can secure time for all her social, intellectual, benevolent, and\r\nreligious, duties. If a woman will take the trouble to make such a\r\ncalculation as this, she will usually find that she has time enough, to\r\nperform all her duties easily and well.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, for a conscientious woman to secure that peaceful\r\nmind, and cheerful enjoyment of life, which all should seek, who is\r\nconstantly finding her duties jarring with each other, and much\r\nremaining undone, which she feels that she ought to do. In consequence\r\nof this, there will be a secret uneasiness, which will throw a shade\r\nover the whole current of life, never to be removed, till she so\r\nefficiently defines and regulates her duties, that she can fulfil them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAnd here the writer would urge upon young ladies, the importance of\r\nforming habits of system, while unembarrassed with those multiplied\r\ncares, which will make the task so much more difficult and hopeless.\r\nEvery young lady can systematize her pursuits, to a certain extent. She\r\ncan have a particular day for mending her wardrobe, and for arranging\r\nher trunks, closets, and drawers. She can keep her workbasket, her desk\r\nat school, and all her other conveniences, in their proper places, and\r\nin regular order. She can have regular periods for reading, walking,\r\nvisiting, study, and domestic pursuits. And, by following this method,\r\nin youth, she will form a taste for regularity, and a habit of system,\r\nwhich will prove a blessing to her, through life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nON GIVING IN CHARITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that there is no point of duty, where conscientious\r\npersons differ more in opinion, or where they find it more difficult to\r\nform discriminating and decided views, than on the matter of charity.\r\nThat we are bound to give _some_ of our time, money, and efforts, to\r\nrelieve the destitute, all allow. But, as to how much we are to give,\r\nand on whom our charities shall be bestowed, many a reflecting mind has\r\nbeen at a loss. Yet it seems very desirable, that, in reference to a\r\nduty so constantly and so strenuously urged by the Supreme Ruler, we\r\nshould be able so to fix metes and bounds, as to keep a conscience void\r\nof offence, and to free the mind from disquieting fears of deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe writer has found no other topic of investigation so beset with\r\ndifficulty, and so absolutely without the range of definite rules, which\r\ncan apply to all, in all circumstances. But on this, as on a previous\r\ntopic, there seem to be _general principles_, by the aid of which, any\r\ncandid mind, sincerely desirous of obeying the commands of Christ,\r\nhowever much self-denial may be involved, can arrive at definite\r\nconclusions, as to its own individual obligations, so that, when these\r\nare fulfilled, the mind may be at peace.\r\n\r\nBut, for a mind that is worldly, living mainly to seek its own\r\npleasures, instead of living to please God, no principles can be so\r\nfixed, as not to leave a ready escape from all obligation. Such minds,\r\neither by indolence (and consequent ignorance) or by sophistry, will\r\nconvince themselves, that a life of engrossing self-indulgence, with\r\nperhaps the gift of a few dollars, and a few hours of time, may suffice,\r\nto fulfil the requisitions of the Eternal Judge.\r\n\r\nFor such minds, no reasonings will avail, till the heart is so changed,\r\nthat, to learn the will and follow the example of Jesus Christ, become\r\nthe leading objects of interest and effort. It is to aid those, who\r\nprofess to possess this temper of mind, that the following suggestions\r\nare offered.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration, which gives definiteness to this subject, is, a\r\ncorrect view of the object for which we are placed in this world. A\r\ngreat many even of professed Christians, seem to be acting on the\r\nsupposition, that the object of life is to secure as much as possible\r\nof all the various enjoyments placed within reach. Not so, teaches\r\nreason or revelation. From these, we learn, that, though the happiness\r\nof His creatures, is the end for which God created and sustains them,\r\nyet, that this happiness depends, not on the various modes of\r\ngratification put within our reach, but mainly on _character_. A man may\r\npossess all the resources for enjoyment which this world can afford, and\r\nyet feel that \"all is vanity and vexation of spirit,\" and that he is\r\nsupremely wretched. Another, may be in want of all things, and yet\r\npossess that living spring of benevolence, faith, and hope, which will\r\nmake an Eden of the darkest prison.\r\n\r\nIn order to be perfectly happy, man must attain that character, which\r\nChrist exhibited; and the nearer he approaches it, the more will\r\nhappiness reign in his breast.\r\n\r\nBut what was the grand peculiarity of the character of Christ? It was\r\n_self-denying benevolence_. He came not to \"seek His own;\" He \"went\r\nabout doing good,\" and this was His \"meat and drink;\" that is, it was\r\nthis which sustained the health and life of His mind, as food and drink\r\nsustain the health and life of the body. Now, the mind of man is so\r\nmade, that it can gradually be transformed into the same likeness. A\r\nselfish being, who, for a whole life, has been nourishing habits of\r\nindolent self-indulgence, can, by taking Christ as his example, by\r\ncommunion with Him, and by daily striving to imitate His character and\r\nconduct, form such a temper of mind, that \"doing good\" will become the\r\nchief and highest source of enjoyment. And this heavenly principle will\r\ngrow stronger and stronger, until self-denial loses the more painful\r\npart of its character, and then, _living to make happiness_, will be so\r\ndelightful and absorbing a pursuit, that all exertions, regarded as the\r\nmeans to this end, will be like the joyous efforts of men, when they\r\nstrive for a prize or a crown, with the full hope of success.\r\n\r\nIn this view of the subject, efforts and self-denial, for the good of\r\nothers, are to be regarded, not merely as duties enjoined for the\r\nbenefit of others, but as the moral training indispensable to the\r\nformation of that character, on which depends our own happiness. This\r\nview, exhibits the full meaning of the Saviour's declaration, \"how\r\nhardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\" He\r\nhad before taught, that the kingdom of Heaven consisted, not in such\r\nenjoyments as the worldly seek, but, in the temper of self-denying\r\nbenevolence, like His own; and, as the rich have far greater temptations\r\nto indolent self-indulgence, they are far less likely to acquire this\r\ntemper, than those, who, by limited means, are inured to some degree of\r\nself-denial.\r\n\r\nBut, on this point, one important distinction needs to be made; and that\r\nis, between the self-denial, which has no other aim than mere\r\nself-mortification, and that, which is exercised to secure greater good\r\nto ourselves and others. The first is the foundation of monasticism,\r\npenances, and all other forms of asceticism; the latter, only, is that\r\nwhich Christianity requires.\r\n\r\nA second consideration, which may give definiteness to this subject, is,\r\nthat the formation of a perfect character, involves, not the\r\nextermination of any principles of our nature, but rather the regulating\r\nof them, according to the rules of reason and religion; so that the\r\nlower propensities shall always be kept subordinate to nobler\r\nprinciples. Thus, we are not to aim at destroying our appetites, or at\r\nneedlessly denying them, but rather so to regulate them, that they shall\r\nbest secure the objects for which they were implanted. We are not to\r\nannihilate the love of praise and admiration; but so to control it, that\r\nthe favor of God shall be regarded more than the estimation of men. We\r\nare not to extirpate the principle of curiosity, which leads us to\r\nacquire knowledge; but so to direct it, that all our acquisitions shall\r\nbe useful and not frivolous or injurious. And thus, with all the\r\nprinciples of the mind, God has implanted no desires in our\r\nconstitution, which are evil and pernicious. On the contrary, all our\r\nconstitutional propensities, either of mind or body, He designed we\r\nshould gratify, whenever no evils would thence result, either to\r\nourselves or others. Such passions as envy, ambition, pride, revenge,\r\nand hatred, are to be exterminated; for they are either excesses or\r\nexcrescences: not created by God, but rather the result of our own\r\nneglect to form habits of benevolence and self-control.\r\n\r\nIn deciding the rules of our conduct, therefore, we are ever to bear in\r\nmind, that the developement of the nobler principles, and the\r\nsubjugation of inferior propensities to them, is to be the main object\r\nof effort, both for ourselves and for others. And, in conformity with\r\nthis, in all our plans, we are to place religious and moral interests as\r\nfirst in estimation, our social and intellectual interests, next, and\r\nour physical gratifications, as subordinate to all.\r\n\r\nA third consideration, is, that, though the means for sustaining life\r\nand health are to be regarded as necessaries, without which no other\r\nduties can be performed, yet, that a very large portion of the time,\r\nspent by most persons, in easy circumstances, for food, raiment, and\r\ndwellings, are for mere _superfluities_, which _are right, when they do\r\nnot involve the sacrifice of higher interests_, and _wrong, when they\r\ndo_. Life and health can be sustained in the humblest dwellings, with\r\nthe plainest dress, and the simplest food; and, after taking from our\r\nmeans, what is necessary for life and health, the remainder is to be so\r\ndivided, that the larger portion shall be given to supply the moral and\r\nintellectual wants of ourselves and others, and the smaller share to\r\nprocure those additional gratifications, of taste and appetite, which\r\nare desirable, but not indispensable. Mankind, thus far, have never made\r\nthis apportionment of their means; yet, just as fast as they have risen\r\nfrom a savage state, mere physical wants have been made, to an\r\nincreasing extent, subordinate to higher objects.\r\n\r\nAnother very important consideration, is, that, in urging the duty of\r\ncharity, and the prior claims of moral and religious objects, no rule of\r\nduty should be maintained, which it would not be right and wise for\r\n_all_ to follow. And we are to test the wisdom of any general rule, by\r\ninquiring what would be the result, if all mankind should practise\r\naccording to it. In view of this, we are enabled to judge of the\r\ncorrectness of those, who maintain, that, to be consistent, men\r\nbelieving in the eternal destruction of all those of our race who are\r\nnot brought under the influence of the Christian system, should give up,\r\nnot merely the elegances, but all the superfluities, of life, and devote\r\nthe whole of their means, not indispensable to life and health, for the\r\npropagation of Christianity. But, if this is the duty of any, it is the\r\nduty of all; and we are to inquire what would be the result, if all\r\nconscientious persons gave up the use of all superfluities. Suppose,\r\nthat two millions of the people in the United States, were conscientious\r\npersons, and relinquished the use of every thing not absolutely\r\nnecessary to life and health. It would instantly throw out of employment\r\none half of the whole community. The manufacturers, mechanics,\r\nmerchants, agriculturists, and all the agencies they employ, would be\r\nbeggared, and one half of those not reduced to poverty, would be obliged\r\nto spend all their extra means, in simply supplying necessaries to the\r\nother half. The use of superfluities, therefore, to a certain extent, is\r\nas indispensable to promote industry, virtue, and religion, as any\r\ndirect giving of money or time; and it is owing entirely to a want of\r\nreflection, and of comprehensive views, that any men ever make so great\r\na mistake, as is here exhibited.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of urging a rule of duty which is at once irrational and\r\nimpracticable, there is another course, which commends itself to the\r\nunderstandings of all. For whatever may be the _practice_, of\r\nintelligent men, they universally concede the _principle_, that our\r\nphysical gratifications should always be made subordinate to social,\r\nintellectual, and moral, advantages. And all that is required, for the\r\nadvancement of our whole race to the most perfect state of society, is,\r\nsimply, that men should act in agreement with this principle. And, if\r\nonly a very small portion, of the most intelligent of our race, should\r\nact according to this rule, under the control of Christian benevolence,\r\nthe immense supplies, furnished, for the general good, would be far\r\nbeyond what any would imagine, who had never made any calculations on\r\nthe subject. In this Nation, alone, suppose the one million and more, of\r\nprofessed followers of Christ, should give a larger portion of their\r\nmeans, for the social, intellectual, and moral, wants of mankind, than\r\nfor the superfluities that minister to taste, convenience, and appetite;\r\nit would be enough to furnish all the schools, colleges, Bibles,\r\nministers, and missionaries, that the whole world could demand; or, at\r\nleast, it would be far more, than properly qualified agents to\r\nadminister it, could employ.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be objected, that, though this view is one, which, in the\r\nabstract, looks plausible and rational, not one in a thousand, can\r\npractically adopt it. How few keep any account, at all, of their current\r\nexpenses! How impossible it is, to determine, exactly, what are\r\nnecessaries, and what are superfluities! And in regard to women, how few\r\nhave the control of an income, so as not to be bound by the wishes of a\r\nparent or a husband!\r\n\r\nIn reference to these difficulties, the first remark is, that we are\r\nnever under obligations to do, what is entirely out of our power, so\r\nthat those persons, who have no power to regulate their expenses or\r\ntheir charities, are under no sort of obligation to attempt it. The\r\nsecond remark is, that, when a rule of duty is discovered, we are bound\r\nto _aim_ at it, and to fulfil it, just so far as we can. We have no\r\nright to throw it aside, because we shall find some difficult cases,\r\nwhen we come to apply it. The third remark is, that no person can tell\r\nhow much can be done, till a faithful trial has been made. If a woman\r\nhas never kept any accounts, nor attempted to regulate her expenditures\r\nby the right rule, nor used her influence with those that control her\r\nplans, to secure this object, she has no right to say how much she can,\r\nor cannot, do, till after a fair trial has been made.\r\n\r\nIn attempting such a trial, the following method can be taken. Let a\r\nwoman keep an account of all she spends, for herself and her family, for\r\na year, arranging the items under three general heads. Under the first,\r\nput all articles for food, raiment, rent, wages, and all conveniences.\r\nUnder the second, place all sums paid in securing an education, and\r\nbooks, and other intellectual advantages. Under the third head, place\r\nall that is spent for benevolence and religion. At the end of the year,\r\nthe first and largest account will show the mixed items of necessaries\r\nand superfluities, which can be arranged, so as to gain some sort of\r\nidea how much has been spent for superfluities, and how much for\r\nnecessaries. Then, by comparing what is spent for superfluities, with\r\nwhat is spent for intellectual and moral advantages, data will be\r\ngained, for judging of the past, and regulating the future.\r\n\r\nDoes a woman say she cannot do this? let her inquire, whether the offer\r\nof a thousand dollars, as a reward for attempting it one year, would not\r\nmake her undertake to do it; and, if so, let her decide, in her own\r\nmind, which is most valuable, a clear conscience, and the approbation of\r\nGod, in this effort to do His will, or one thousand dollars. And let her\r\ndo it, with this warning of the Saviour before her eyes,--\"No man can\r\nserve two masters.\" \"Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\"\r\n\r\nIs it objected, How can we decide between superfluities and necessaries,\r\nin this list? it is replied, that we are not required to judge exactly,\r\nin all cases. Our duty is, to use the means in our power to assist us in\r\nforming a correct judgement; to seek the Divine aid in freeing our minds\r\nfrom indolence and selfishness; and then to judge as well as we can, in\r\nour endeavors rightly to apportion and regulate our expenses. Many\r\npersons seem to feel that they are bound to do better than they know\r\nhow. But God is not so hard a Master; and, after we have used all proper\r\nmeans to learn the right way, if we then follow it, according to our\r\nability, we do wrong to feel misgivings, or to blame ourselves, if\r\nresults come out differently from what seems desirable. The results of\r\nour actions, alone, can never prove us deserving of blame. For men are\r\noften so placed, that, owing to lack of intellect or means, it is\r\nimpossible for them to decide correctly. To use all the means of\r\nknowledge within our reach, and then to judge, with a candid and\r\nconscientious spirit, is all that God requires; and, when we have done\r\nthis, and the event seems to come out wrong, we should never wish that\r\nwe had decided otherwise. For it is the same as wishing that we had not\r\nfollowed the dictates of judgement and conscience. As this is a world\r\ndesigned for discipline and trial, untoward events are never to be\r\nconstrued as indications of the obliquity of our past decisions.\r\n\r\nBut it is probable, that a great portion of the women of this Nation,\r\ncannot secure any such systematic mode of regulating their expenses. To\r\nsuch, the writer would propose one inquiry; cannot you calculate how\r\nmuch _time_ and _money_ you spend for what is merely ornamental, and not\r\nnecessary, for yourself, your children, and your house? Cannot you\r\ncompare this with the time and money you spend for intellectual and\r\nbenevolent purposes? and will not this show the need of some change? In\r\nmaking this examination, is not this brief rule, deducible from the\r\nprinciples before laid down, the one which should regulate you? Every\r\nperson does right, in spending _some_ portion of time and means in\r\nsecuring the conveniences and adornments of taste; but the amount should\r\nnever exceed what is spent in securing our own moral and intellectual\r\nimprovement, nor exceed what is spent in benevolent efforts to supply\r\nthe physical and moral wants of our fellow-men.\r\n\r\nIn making an examination on this subject, it is sometimes the case, that\r\na woman will count among the _necessaries_ of life, all the various\r\nmodes of adorning the person or house, practised in the circle in which\r\nshe moves; and, after enumerating the many _duties_ which demand\r\nattention, counting these as a part, she will come to the conclusion,\r\nthat she has no time, and but little money, to devote to personal\r\nimprovement, or to benevolent enterprises. This surely is not in\r\nagreement with the requirements of the Saviour, who calls on us to seek\r\nfor others, as well as ourselves, _first of all_, \"the kingdom of God,\r\nand His righteousness.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to act in accordance with the rule here presented, it is true,\r\nthat many would be obliged to give up the idea of conforming to the\r\nnotions and customs of those, with whom they associate, and compelled to\r\nadopt the maxim, \"be not conformed to this world.\" In many cases, it\r\nwould involve an entire change in the style of living. And the writer\r\nhas the happiness of knowing more cases than one, where persons, who\r\nhave come to similar views, on this subject, have given up large and\r\nexpensive establishments, disposed of their carriages, dismissed a\r\nportion of their domestics, and modified all their expenditures, that\r\nthey might keep a pure conscience, and regulate their charities more\r\naccording to the requirements of Christianity. And there are persons,\r\nwell known in the religious world, who save themselves all labor of\r\nminute calculation, by devoting so large a portion of their time and\r\nmeans to benevolent objects, that they find no difficulty in knowing\r\nthat they give more for religious, benevolent, and intellectual,\r\npurposes, than for superfluities.\r\n\r\nIn deciding what particular objects shall receive our benefactions,\r\nthere are also general principles to guide us. The first, is that\r\npresented by our Saviour, when, after urging the great law of\r\nbenevolence, He was asked, \"and who is my neighbor?\" His reply, in the\r\nparable of 'the Good Samaritan,' teaches us, that any human being, whose\r\nwants are brought to our knowledge, is our neighbor. The wounded man was\r\nnot only a stranger, but he belonged to a foreign nation, peculiarly\r\nhated; and he had no claim, except that his wants were brought to the\r\nknowledge of the wayfaring man. From this, we learn, that the destitute,\r\nof all nations, become our neighbors, as soon as their wants are brought\r\nto our knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnother general principle, is this, that those who are most in need,\r\nmust be relieved, in preference to those who are less destitute. On this\r\nprinciple, it is, that we think the followers of Christ should give more\r\nto supply those who are suffering for want of the bread of eternal life,\r\nthan for those who are deprived of physical enjoyments. And another\r\nreason for this preference, is, the fact, that many, who give in\r\ncharity, have made such imperfect advances in civilization and\r\nChristianity, that the intellectual and moral wants of our race make but\r\na feeble impression on the mind. Relate a pitiful tale of a family,\r\nreduced to live, for weeks, on potatoes, only, and many a mind would\r\nawake to deep sympathy, and stretch forth the hand of charity. But\r\ndescribe cases, where the immortal mind is pining in stupidity and\r\nignorance, or racked with the fever of baleful passions, and how small\r\nthe number, so elevated in sentiment, and so enlarged in their views, as\r\nto appreciate and sympathize in these far greater misfortunes! The\r\nintellectual and moral wants of our fellow-men, therefore, should claim\r\nthe first place in our attention, both because they are most important,\r\nand because they are most neglected.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration, to be borne in mind, is, that, in this Country,\r\nthere is much less real need of charity, in supplying physical\r\nnecessities, than is generally supposed, by those who have not learned\r\nthe more excellent way. This Land is so abundant in supplies, and labor\r\nis in such demand, that every healthy person can earn a comfortable\r\nsupport. And if all the poor were instantly made virtuous, it is\r\nprobable that there would be no physical wants, which could not readily\r\nbe supplied by the immediate friends of each sufferer. The sick, the\r\naged, and the orphan, would be the only objects of charity. In this\r\nview of the case, the primary effort, in relieving the poor, should be,\r\nto furnish them the means of earning their own support, and to supply\r\nthem with those moral influences, which are most effectual in securing\r\nvirtue and industry.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be attended to, is, the importance of maintaining a\r\nsystem of _associated_ charities. There is no point, in which the\r\neconomy of charity has more improved, than in the present mode of\r\ncombining many small contributions, for sustaining enlarged and\r\nsystematic plans of charity. If all the half-dollars, which are now\r\ncontributed to aid in organized systems of charity, were returned to the\r\ndonors, to be applied by the agency and discretion of each, thousands\r\nand thousands of the treasures, now employed to promote the moral and\r\nintellectual wants of mankind, would become entirely useless. In a\r\ndemocracy, like ours, where few are very rich, and the majority are in\r\ncomfortable circumstances, this collecting and dispensing of drops and\r\nrills, is the mode, by which, in imitation of Nature, the dews and\r\nshowers are to distil on parched and desert lands. And every person,\r\nwhile earning a pittance to unite with many more, may be cheered with\r\nthe consciousness of sustaining a grand system of operations, which must\r\nhave the most decided influence, in raising all mankind to that perfect\r\nstate of society, which Christianity is designed to secure.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration, relates to the indiscriminate bestowal of\r\ncharity. Persons, who have taken pains to inform themselves, and who\r\ndevote their whole time to dispensing charities, unite in declaring,\r\nthat this is one of the most fruitful sources of indolence, vice, and\r\npoverty. From several of these, the writer has learned, that, by their\r\nown personal investigations, they have ascertained, that there are large\r\nestablishments of idle and wicked persons, in most of our cities, who\r\nassociate together, to support themselves by every species of\r\nimposition. They hire large houses, and live in constant rioting, on the\r\nmeans thus obtained. Among them, are women who have, or who hire the\r\nuse of, infant children; others, who are blind, or maimed, or deformed,\r\nor who can adroitly feign such infirmities, and, by these means of\r\nexciting pity, and by artful tales of wo, they collect alms, both in\r\ncity and country, to spend in all manner of gross and guilty\r\nindulgences. Meantime, many persons, finding themselves often duped by\r\nimpostors, refuse to give at all; and thus many benefactions are\r\nwithdrawn, which a wise economy in charity would have secured. For this,\r\nand other reasons, it is wise and merciful, to adopt the general rule,\r\nnever to give alms, till we have had some opportunity of knowing how\r\nthey will be spent. There are exceptions to this, as to every general\r\nrule, which a person of discretion can determine. But the practice, so\r\ncommon among benevolent persons, of giving, at least a trifle, to all\r\nwho ask, lest, perchance, they may turn away some, who are really\r\nsufferers, is one, which causes more sin and misery than it cures.\r\n\r\nThe writer has never known any system for dispensing charity, so\r\nsuccessful, as the one which, in many places, has been adopted in\r\nconnection with the distribution of tracts. By this method, a town or\r\ncity is divided into districts; and each district is committed to the\r\ncare of two ladies, whose duty it is, to call on each family and leave a\r\ntract, and make that the occasion for entering into conversation, and\r\nlearning the situation of all residents in the district. By this method,\r\nthe ignorant, the vicious, and the poor, are discovered, and their\r\nphysical, intellectual, and moral, wants, are investigated. In some\r\nplaces, where the writer has resided or visited, each person retained\r\nthe same district, year after year, so that every poor family in the\r\nplace was under the watch and care of some intelligent and benevolent\r\nlady, who used all her influence to secure a proper education for the\r\nchildren, to furnish them with suitable reading, to encourage habits of\r\nindustry and economy, and to secure regular attendance on public\r\nreligious instruction. Thus, the rich and the poor were brought in\r\ncontact, in a way advantageous to both parties; and, if such a system\r\ncould be universally adopted, more would be done for the prevention of\r\npoverty and vice, than all the wealth of the Nation could avail for\r\ntheir relief. But this plan cannot be successfully carried out, in this\r\nmanner, unless there is a large proportion of intelligent, benevolent,\r\nand self-denying, persons; and the mere distribution of tracts, without\r\nthe other parts of the plan, is of very little avail.\r\n\r\nBut there is one species of charity, which needs especial consideration.\r\nIt is that, which induces us to refrain from judging of the means and\r\nthe relative charities of other persons. There have been such indistinct\r\nnotions, and so many different standards of duty, on this subject, that\r\nit is rare for two persons to think exactly alike, in regard to the rule\r\nof duty. Each person is bound to inquire and judge for himself, as to\r\nhis own duty or deficiencies; but as both the resources, and the amount\r\nof the actual charities, of other men are beyond our ken, it is as\r\nindecorous, as it is uncharitable, to sit in judgement on their\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nON ECONOMY OF TIME AND EXPENSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Economy of Time._\r\n\r\nThe value of time, and our obligation to spend every hour for some\r\nuseful end, are what few minds properly realize. And those, who have the\r\nhighest sense of their obligations in this respect, sometimes greatly\r\nmisjudge in their estimate of what are useful and proper modes of\r\nemploying time. This arises from limited views of the importance of some\r\npursuits, which they would deem frivolous and useless, but which are,\r\nin reality, necessary to preserve the health of body and mind, and those\r\nsocial affections, which it is very important to cherish. Christianity\r\nteaches, that, for all the time afforded us, we must give account to\r\nGod; and that we have no right to waste a single hour. But time, which\r\nis spent in rest or amusement, is often as usefully employed, as if it\r\nwere devoted to labor or devotion. In employing our time, we are to make\r\nsuitable allowance for sleep, for preparing and taking food, for\r\nsecuring the means of a livelihood, for intellectual improvement, for\r\nexercise and amusement, for social enjoyments, and for benevolent and\r\nreligious duties. And it is the _right apportionment_ of time, to these\r\nvarious duties, which constitutes its true economy.\r\n\r\nIn making this apportionment, we are bound by the same rules, as relate\r\nto the use of property. We are to employ whatever portion is necessary\r\nto sustain life and health, as the first duty; and the remainder we are\r\nso to apportion, that our highest interests, shall receive the greatest\r\nallotment, and our physical gratifications, the least.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Supreme Ruler, when He became the civil as well as the\r\nreligious Head of the Jewish theocracy, furnish an example, which it\r\nwould be well for all attentively to consider, when forming plans for\r\nthe apportionment of time and property. To properly estimate this\r\nexample, it must be borne in mind, that the main object of God, was, to\r\npreserve His religion among the Jewish nation; and that they were not\r\nrequired to take any means to propagate it among other nations, as\r\nChristians are now required to extend Christianity. So low were they, in\r\nthe scale of civilization and mental developement, that a system, which\r\nconfined them to one spot, as an agricultural people, and prevented\r\ntheir growing very rich, or having extensive commerce with other\r\nnations, was indispensable to prevent their relapsing into the low\r\nidolatries and vices of the nations around them.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of time and property, which every Jew was required to\r\ndevote to intellectual, benevolent, and religious purposes, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nIn regard to property, they were required to give one tenth of all their\r\nyearly income, to support the Levites, the priests, and the religious\r\nservice. Next, they were required to give the first fruits of all their\r\ncorn, wine, oil, and fruits, and the first-born of all their cattle, for\r\nthe Lord's treasury, to be employed for the priests, the widow, the\r\nfatherless, and the stranger. The first-born, also, of their children,\r\nwere the Lord's, and were to be redeemed by a specified sum, paid into\r\nthe sacred treasury. Besides this, they were required to bring a\r\nfreewill offering to God, every time they went up to the three great\r\nyearly festivals. In addition to this, regular yearly sacrifices, of\r\ncattle and fowls, were required of each family, and occasional\r\nsacrifices for certain sins or ceremonial impurities. In reaping their\r\nfields, they were required to leave unreaped, for the poor, the corners;\r\nnot to glean their fields, olive-yards, or vineyards; and, if a sheaf\r\nwas left, by mistake, they were not to return for it, but leave it for\r\nthe poor. When a man sent away a servant, he was thus charged: \"Furnish\r\nhim liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy\r\nwine-press.\" When a poor man came to borrow money, they were forbidden\r\nto deny him, or to take any interest; and if, at the sabbatical, or\r\nseventh, year, he could not pay, the debt was to be cancelled. And to\r\nthis command, is added the significant caution, \"Beware that there be\r\nnot a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, the seventh year, the year of\r\nrelease, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and\r\nthou givest him nought; and he cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be\r\nsin unto thee. Thou shalt surely give him,\" \"because that for this thing\r\nthe Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou\r\nputtest thine hand unto.\" Besides this, the Levites were distributed\r\nthrough the land, with the intention that they should be instructors and\r\npriests in every part of the nation. Thus, one twelfth of the people\r\nwere set apart, having no landed property, to be priests and teachers;\r\nand the other tribes were required to support them liberally.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the time taken from secular pursuits, for the support of\r\nreligion, an equally liberal amount was demanded. In the first place,\r\none seventh part of their time was taken for the weekly sabbath, when no\r\nkind of work was to be done. Then the whole nation were required to\r\nmeet, at the appointed place, three times a year, which, including their\r\njourneys, and stay there, occupied eight weeks, or another seventh part\r\nof their time. Then the sabbatical year, when no agricultural labor was\r\nto be done, took another seventh of their time from their regular\r\npursuits, as they were an agricultural people. This was the amount of\r\ntime and property demanded by God, simply to sustain religion and\r\nmorality within the bounds of that nation. Christianity demands the\r\nspread of its blessings to all mankind, and so the restrictions laid on\r\nthe Jews are withheld, and all our wealth and time, not needful for our\r\nown best interest, is to be employed in improving the condition of our\r\nfellow-men.\r\n\r\nIn deciding respecting the rectitude of our pursuits, we are bound to\r\naim at some practical good, as the ultimate object. With every duty of\r\nthis life, our benevolent Creator has connected some species of\r\nenjoyment, to draw us to perform it. Thus, the palate is gratified, by\r\nperforming the duty of nourishing our bodies; the principle of curiosity\r\nis gratified, in pursuing useful knowledge; the desire of approbation is\r\ngratified, when we perform benevolent and social duties; and every other\r\nduty has an alluring enjoyment connected with it. But the great mistake\r\nof mankind has consisted in seeking the pleasures, connected with these\r\nduties, as the sole aim, without reference to the main end that should\r\nbe held in view, and to which the enjoyment should be made subservient.\r\nThus, men seek to gratify the palate, without reference to the question\r\nwhether the body is properly nourished; and follow after knowledge,\r\nwithout inquiring whether it ministers to good or evil.\r\n\r\nBut, in gratifying the implanted desires of our nature, we are bound so\r\nto restrain ourselves, by reason and conscience, as always to seek the\r\nmain objects of existence--the highest good of ourselves and others; and\r\nnever to sacrifice this, for the mere gratification of our sensual\r\ndesires. We are to gratify appetite, just so far as is consistent with\r\nhealth and usefulness; and the desire for knowledge, just so far as will\r\nenable us to do most good by our influence and efforts; and no farther.\r\nWe are to seek social intercourse, to that extent, which will best\r\npromote domestic enjoyment and kindly feelings among neighbors and\r\nfriends; and we are to pursue exercise and amusement, only so far as\r\nwill best sustain the vigor of body and mind. For the right\r\napportionment of time, to these and various other duties, we are to give\r\nan account to our Creator and final Judge.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting to give any very specific rules on this subject,\r\nsome modes of economizing time will be suggested. The most powerful of\r\nall agencies, in this matter, is, that habit of system and order, in all\r\nour pursuits, which has been already pointed out. It is probable, that a\r\nregular and systematic employment of time, will enable a person to\r\naccomplish thrice the amount of labor, that could otherwise be\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of economizing time, is, by uniting several objects in one\r\nemployment. Thus, exercise, or charitable efforts, can be united with\r\nsocial enjoyments, as is done in associations for sewing, or visiting\r\nthe poor. Instruction and amusement can also be combined. Pursuits like\r\nmusic, gardening, drawing, botany, and the like, unite intellectual\r\nimprovement with amusement, social enjoyment, and exercise.\r\n\r\nWith housekeepers, and others whose employments are various and\r\ndesultory, much time can be saved by preparing employments for little\r\nintervals of leisure. Thus, some ladies make ready, and keep in the\r\nparlor, light work, to take up when detained there; some keep a book at\r\nhand, in the nursery, to read while holding or sitting by a sleeping\r\ninfant. One of the most popular female poets of our Country very often\r\nshows her friends, at their calls, that the thread of the knitting,\r\nnever need interfere with the thread of agreeable discourse.\r\n\r\nIt would be astonishing, to one who had never tried the experiment, how\r\nmuch can be accomplished, by a little planning and forethought, in thus\r\nfinding employment for odd intervals of time.\r\n\r\nBut, besides economizing our own time, we are bound to use our influence\r\nand example to promote the discharge of the same duty by others. A woman\r\nis under obligations so to arrange the hours and pursuits of her family,\r\nas to promote systematic and habitual industry; and if, by late\r\nbreakfasts, irregular hours for meals, and other hinderances of this\r\nkind, she interferes with, or refrains from promoting regular industry\r\nin, others, she is accountable to God for all the waste of time\r\nconsequent on her negligence. The mere example of system and industry,\r\nin a housekeeper, has a wonderful influence in promoting the same\r\nvirtuous habit in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Economy in Expenses._\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a woman to practise a wise economy in expenditures,\r\nunless she is taught how to do it, either by a course of experiments, or\r\nby the instruction of those who have had experience. It is amusing to\r\nnotice the various, and oftentimes contradictory, notions of economy,\r\namong judicious and experienced housekeepers; for there is probably no\r\neconomist, who would not be deemed lavish or wasteful, in some respects,\r\nby another and equally experienced and judicious person, who, in some\r\ndifferent points, would herself be as much condemned by the other. These\r\ndiversities are occasioned by dissimilar early habits, and by the\r\ndifferent relative value assigned, by each, to the various modes of\r\nenjoyment, for which money is expended.\r\n\r\nBut, though there may be much disagreement in minor matters, there are\r\ncertain general principles, which all unite in sanctioning. The first,\r\nis, that care be taken to know the amount of income and of current\r\nexpenses, so that the proper relative proportion be preserved, and the\r\nexpenditures never exceed the means. Few women can do this, thoroughly,\r\nwithout keeping regular accounts. The habits of this Nation, especially\r\namong business-men, are so desultory, and the current expenses of a\r\nfamily, in many points, are so much more under the control of the man\r\nthan of the woman, that many women, who are disposed to be systematic in\r\nthis matter, cannot follow their wishes. But there are often cases, when\r\nmuch is left undone in this particular, simply because no effort is\r\nmade. Yet every woman is bound to do as much as is in her power, to\r\naccomplish a systematic mode of expenditure, and the regulation of it by\r\nChristian principles.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of different methods which have been adopted,\r\nfor securing a proper adjustment of expenses to the means.\r\n\r\nThe first, is that of a lady, who kept a large boarding-house, in one of\r\nour cities. Every evening, before retiring, she took an account of the\r\nexpenses of the day; and this usually occupied her not more than fifteen\r\nminutes, at a time. On each Saturday, she made an inventory of the\r\nstores on hand, and of the daily expenses, and also of what was due to\r\nher; and then made an exact estimate of her expenditures and profits.\r\nThis, after the first two or three weeks, never took more than an hour,\r\nat the close of the week. Thus, by a very little time, regularly devoted\r\nto this object, she knew, accurately, her income, expenditures, and\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nAnother friend of the writer, lives on a regular salary. The method\r\nadopted, in this case, is to calculate to what the salary amounts, each\r\nweek. Then an account is kept, of what is paid out, each week, for\r\nrent, fuel, wages, and food. This amount of each week is deducted from\r\nthe weekly income. The remainders of each week are added, at the close\r\nof a month, as the stock from which is to be taken, the dress,\r\nfurniture, books, travelling expenses, charities, and all other\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nAnother lady, whose husband is a lawyer, divides the year into four\r\nquarters, and the income into four equal parts. She then makes her\r\nplans, so that the expenses of one quarter shall never infringe on the\r\nincome of another. So resolute is she, in carrying out this\r\ndetermination, that if, by any mischance, she is in want of articles\r\nbefore the close of a quarter, which she has not the means for\r\nproviding, she will subject herself to temporary inconvenience, by\r\nwaiting, rather than violate her rule.\r\n\r\nAnother lady, whose husband is engaged in a business, which he thinks\r\nmakes it impossible for him to know what his yearly income will be, took\r\nthis method:--She kept an account of all her disbursements, for one\r\nyear. This she submitted to her husband, and obtained his consent, that\r\nthe same sum should be under her control, the coming year, for similar\r\npurposes, with the understanding, that she might modify future\r\napportionments, in any way her judgement and conscience might approve.\r\n\r\nA great deal of uneasiness and discomfort is caused, to both husband and\r\nwife, in many cases, by an entire want of system and forethought, in\r\narranging expenses. Both keep buying what they think they need, without\r\nany calculation as to how matters are coming out, and with a sort of\r\ndread of running in debt, all the time harassing them. Such never know\r\nthe comfort of independence. But, if a man or woman will only calculate\r\nwhat their income is, and then plan so as to know that they are all the\r\ntime living within it, they secure one of the greatest comforts, which\r\nwealth ever bestows, and what many of the rich, who live in a loose and\r\ncareless way, never enjoy. It is not so much the amount of income, as\r\nthe regular and correct apportionment of expenses, that makes a family\r\ntruly comfortable. A man, with ten thousand a year, is often more\r\nharassed, for want of money, than the systematic economist, who supports\r\na family on only six hundred a year. And the inspired command, \"Owe no\r\nman any thing,\" can never be conscientiously observed, without a\r\nsystematic adaptation of expenses to means.\r\n\r\nAs it is very important that young ladies should learn systematic\r\neconomy, in expenses, it will be a great benefit, for every young girl\r\nto begin, at twelve or thirteen years of age, to make her own purchases,\r\nand keep her accounts, under the guidance of her mother, or some other\r\nfriend. And if parents would ascertain the actual expense of a\r\ndaughter's clothing, for a year, and give the sum to her, in quarterly\r\npayments, requiring a regular account, it would be of great benefit in\r\npreparing her for future duties. How else are young ladies to learn to\r\nmake purchases properly, and to be systematic and economical? The art of\r\nsystem and economy can no more come by intuition, than the art of\r\nwatchmaking or bookkeeping; and how strange it appears, that so many\r\nyoung ladies take charge of a husband's establishment, without having\r\nhad either instruction or experience in one of the most important duties\r\nof their station!\r\n\r\nThe second general principle of economy, is, that, in apportioning an\r\nincome, among various objects, the most important should receive the\r\nlargest supply, and that all retrenchments be made in matters of less\r\nimportance. In a previous chapter, some general principles have been\r\npresented, to guide in this duty. Some additional hints will here be\r\nadded, on the same topic.\r\n\r\nIn regard to dress and furniture, much want of judgement and good taste\r\nis often seen, in purchasing some expensive article, which is not at all\r\nin keeping with the other articles connected with it. Thus, a large\r\nsideboard, or elegant mirror, or sofa, which would be suitable only for\r\na large establishment, with other rich furniture, is crowded into too\r\nsmall a room, with coarse and cheap articles around it. So, also,\r\nsometimes a parlor, and company-chamber, will be furnished in a style\r\nsuitable only for the wealthy, while the table will be supplied with\r\nshabby linen, and imperfect crockery, and every other part of the house\r\nwill look, in comparison with these fine rooms, mean and niggardly. It\r\nis not at all uncommon, to find very showy and expensive articles in the\r\npart of the house visible to strangers, when the children's rooms,\r\nkitchen, and other back portions, are on an entirely different scale.\r\n\r\nSo in regard to dress, a lady will sometimes purchase an elegant and\r\nexpensive article, which, instead of attracting admiration from the eye\r\nof taste, will merely serve as a decoy to the painful contrast of all\r\nother parts of the dress. A woman of real good taste and discretion,\r\nwill strive to maintain a relative consistency between all departments,\r\nand not, in one quarter, live on a scale fitted only to the rich, and in\r\nanother, on one appropriate only to the poor.\r\n\r\nAnother mistake in economy, is often made, by some of the best-educated\r\nand most intelligent of mothers. Such will often be found spending day\r\nafter day at needlework, when, with a comparatively small sum, this\r\nlabor could be obtained of those who need the money, which such work\r\nwould procure for them. Meantime, the daughters of the family, whom the\r\nmother is qualified to educate, or so nearly qualified, that she could\r\nreadily keep ahead of her children, are sent to expensive\r\nboarding-schools, where their delicate frames, their pliant minds, and\r\ntheir moral and religious interests, are relinquished to the hands of\r\nstrangers. And the expense, thus incurred, would serve to pay the hire\r\nof every thing the mother can do in sewing, four or five times over. The\r\nsame want of economy is shown in communities, where, instead of\r\nestablishing a good female school in their vicinity, the men of wealth\r\nsend their daughters abroad, at double the expense, to be either\r\neducated or spoiled, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nAnother species of poor economy, is manifested in neglecting to acquire\r\nand apply mechanical skill, which, in consequence, has to be hired from\r\nothers. Thus, all the plain sewing will be done by the mother and\r\ndaughters, while all that requires skill will be hired. Instead of this,\r\nothers take pains to have their daughters instructed in mantuamaking,\r\nand the simpler parts of millinery, so that the plain work is given to\r\nthe poor, who need it, and the more expensive and tasteful operations\r\nare performed in the family. The writer knows ladies, who not only make\r\ntheir own dresses, but also their caps, bonnets, and artificial flowers.\r\n\r\nSome persons make miscalculations in economy, by habitually looking up\r\ncheap articles, while others go to the opposite extreme, and always buy\r\nthe best of every thing. Those ladies, who are considered the best\r\neconomists, do not adopt either method. In regard to cheap goods, the\r\nfading colors, the damages discovered in use, the poorness of material,\r\nand the extra sewing demanded to replace articles lost by such causes,\r\nusually render them very dear, in the end. On the other hand, though\r\nsome articles, of the most expensive kind, wear longest and best, yet,\r\nas a general rule, articles at medium prices do the best service. This\r\nis true of table and bed linens, broadcloths, shirtings, and the like;\r\nthough, even in these cases, it is often found, that the coarsest and\r\ncheapest last the longest.\r\n\r\nBuying by wholesale, and keeping a large supply on hand, are economical\r\nonly in large families, where the mistress is careful; but in other\r\ncases, the hazards of accident, and the temptation to a lavish use, will\r\nmake the loss outrun the profits.\r\n\r\nThere is one mode of economizing, which, it is hoped, will every year\r\ngrow more rare; and that is, making penurious savings, by getting the\r\npoor to work as cheap as possible. Many amiable and benevolent women\r\nhave done this, on principle, without reflecting on the want of\r\nChristian charity thus displayed. Let every woman, in making bargains\r\nwith the poor, conceive herself placed in the same circumstances,\r\ntoiling hour after hour, and day after day, for a small sum, and then\r\ndeal with others as she would be dealt by in such a situation. _Liberal\r\nprices_, and _prompt payment_, should be an invariable maxim, in dealing\r\nwith the poor.\r\n\r\nThe third general principle of economy, is, that all articles should be\r\nso used, and taken care of, as to secure the longest service, with the\r\nleast waste. Under this head, come many particulars in regard to the use\r\nand preservation of articles, which will be found more in detail in\r\nsucceeding chapters. It may be proper, however, here to refer to one\r\nvery common impression, as to the relative obligation of the poor and\r\nthe rich in regard to economy. Many seem to suppose, that those who are\r\nwealthy, have a right to be lavish and negligent in the care of\r\nexpenses. But this surely is a great mistake. Property is a talent,\r\ngiven by God, to spend for the welfare of mankind; and the needless\r\nwaste of it, is as wrong in the rich, as it is in the poor. The rich are\r\nunder obligations to apportion their income, to the various objects\r\ndemanding attention, by the same rule as all others; and if this will\r\nallow them to spend more for superfluities than those of smaller means,\r\nit never makes it right to misuse or waste any of the bounties of\r\nProvidence. Whatever is no longer wanted for their own enjoyment, should\r\nbe carefully saved, to add to the enjoyment of others.\r\n\r\nIt is not always that men understand the economy of Providence, in that\r\nunequal distribution of property, which, even under the most perfect\r\nform of government, will always exist. Many, looking at the present\r\nstate of things, imagine that the rich, if they acted in strict\r\nconformity to the law of benevolence, would share all their property\r\nwith their suffering fellow-men. But such do not take into account, the\r\ninspired declaration, that \"a man's life consisteth not in the\r\nabundance of the things which he possesseth,\" or, in other words, life\r\nis made valuable, not by great possessions, but by such a character as\r\nprepares a man to enjoy what he holds. God perceives that human\r\ncharacter can be most improved, by that kind of discipline, which\r\nexists, when there is something valuable to be gained by industrious\r\nefforts. This stimulus to industry could never exist, in a community\r\nwhere all are just alike, as it does in a state of society where every\r\nman sees, possessed by others, enjoyments, which he desires, and may\r\nsecure by effort and industry. So, in a community where all are alike as\r\nto property, there would be no chance to gain that noblest of all\r\nattainments, a habit of self-denying benevolence, which toils for the\r\ngood of others, and takes from one's own store, to increase the\r\nenjoyments of another.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of the stagnation, both of industry and of benevolence,\r\nwhich would follow the universal and equable distribution of property,\r\none class of men, by superior advantages of birth, or intellect, or\r\npatronage, come into possession of a great amount of capital. With these\r\nmeans, they are enabled, by study, reading, and travel, to secure\r\nexpansion of mind, and just views of the relative advantages of moral,\r\nintellectual, and physical enjoyments. At the same time, Christianity\r\nimposes obligations, corresponding with the increase of advantages and\r\nmeans. The rich are not at liberty to spend their treasures for\r\nthemselves, alone. Their wealth is given, by God, to be employed for the\r\nbest good of mankind; and their intellectual advantages are designed,\r\nprimarily, to enable them to judge correctly, in employing their means\r\nmost wisely for the general good.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose a man of wealth inherits ten thousand acres of real estate:\r\nit is not his duty to divide it among his poor neighbors and tenants. If\r\nhe took this course, it is probable, that most of them would spend all\r\nin thriftless waste and indolence, or in mere physical enjoyments.\r\nInstead, then, of thus putting his capital out of his hands, he is bound\r\nto retain, and so to employ, it, as to raise his neighbors and tenants\r\nto such a state of virtue and intelligence, that they can secure far\r\nmore, by their own efforts and industry, than he, by dividing his\r\ncapital, could bestow upon them.\r\n\r\nIn this view of the subject, it is manifest, that the unequal\r\ndistribution of property is no evil. The great difficulty is, that so\r\nlarge a portion of those who hold much capital, instead of using their\r\nvarious advantages for the greatest good of those around them, employ\r\nthe chief of them for mere selfish indulgences; thus inflicting as much\r\nmischief on themselves, as results to others from their culpable\r\nneglect. A great portion of the rich seem to be acting on the principle,\r\nthat the more God bestows on them, the less are they under obligation to\r\npractise any self-denial, in fulfilling his benevolent plan of raising\r\nour race to intelligence and holiness.\r\n\r\nThere are not a few, who seem to imagine that it is a mark of gentility\r\nto be careless of expenses. But this notion, is owing to a want of\r\nknowledge of the world. As a general fact, it will be found, that\r\npersons of rank and wealth, abroad, are much more likely to be\r\nsystematic and economical, than persons of inferior standing in these\r\nrespects. Even the most frivolous, among the rich and great, are often\r\nfound practising a rigid economy, in certain respects, in order to\r\nsecure gratifications in another direction. And it will be found so\r\ncommon, among persons of vulgar minds, and little education, and less\r\nsense, to make a display of profusion and indifference to expense, as a\r\nmark of their claims to gentility, that the really genteel look upon it\r\nrather as a mark of low breeding. So that the sort of feeling, which\r\nsome persons cherish, as if it were a degradation to be careful of small\r\nsums, and to be attentive to relative prices, in making purchases, is\r\nfounded on mistaken notions of gentility and propriety.\r\n\r\nBut one caution is needful, in regard to another extreme. When a lady\r\nof wealth, is seen roaming about in search of cheaper articles, or\r\ntrying to beat down a shopkeeper, or making a close bargain with those\r\nshe employs, the impropriety is glaring to all minds. A person of wealth\r\nhas no occasion to spend time in looking for extra cheap articles; her\r\ntime could be more profitably employed in distributing to the wants of\r\nothers. And the practice of beating down tradespeople, is vulgar and\r\ndegrading, in any one. A woman, after a little inquiry, can ascertain\r\nwhat is the fair and common price of things; and if she is charged an\r\nexorbitant sum, she can decline taking the article. If the price be a\r\nfair one, it is not becoming in her to search for another article which\r\nis below the regular charge. If a woman finds that she is in a store\r\nwhere they charge high prices, expecting to be beat down, she can\r\nmention, that she wishes to know the lowest price, as it is contrary to\r\nher principles to beat down charges.\r\n\r\nThere is one inconsistency, worthy of notice, which is found among that\r\nclass, who are ambitious of being ranked among the aristocracy of\r\nsociety. It has been remarked, that, in the real aristocracy of other\r\nlands, it is much more common, than with us, to practise systematic\r\neconomy. And such do not hesitate to say so, when they cannot afford\r\ncertain indulgences. This practice descends to subordinate grades; so\r\nthat foreign ladies, when they come to reside among us, seldom hesitate\r\nin assigning the true reason, when they cannot afford any gratification.\r\nBut in this Country, it will be found, that many, who are most fond of\r\ncopying aristocratic examples, are, on this point, rather with the\r\nvulgar. Not a few of those young persons, who begin life with parlors\r\nand dresses in a style fitting only to established wealth, go into\r\nexpenses, which they can ill afford; and are ashamed even to allow, that\r\nthey are restrained from any expense, by motives of economy. Such a\r\nconfession is never extorted, except by some call of benevolence; and\r\nthen, they are very ready to declare that they cannot afford to bestow\r\neven a pittance. In such cases, it would seem as if the direct opposite\r\nof Christianity had gained possession of their tastes and opinions. They\r\nare ashamed to appear to deny themselves; but are very far from having\r\nany shame in denying the calls of benevolence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nON HEALTH OF MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is such an intimate connection between the body and mind, that the\r\nhealth of one, cannot be preserved, without a proper care of the other.\r\nAnd it is from a neglect of this principle, that some of the most\r\nexemplary and conscientious persons in the world, suffer a thousand\r\nmental agonies, from a diseased state of body, while others ruin the\r\nhealth of the body, by neglecting the proper care of the mind. When the\r\nbrain is excited, by stimulating drinks taken into the stomach, it\r\nproduces a corresponding excitement of the mental faculties. The reason,\r\nthe imagination, and all the powers, are stimulated to preternatural\r\nvigor and activity. In like manner, when the mind is excited by earnest\r\nintellectual effort, or by strong passions, the brain is equally\r\nexcited, and the blood rushes to the head. Sir Astley Cooper records,\r\nthat, in examining the brain of a young man who had lost a portion of\r\nhis skull, whenever \"he was agitated, by some opposition to his wishes,\"\r\n\"the blood was sent, with increased force, to his brain,\" and the\r\npulsations \"became frequent and violent.\" The same effect was produced\r\nby any intellectual effort; and the flushed countenance, which attends\r\nearnest study or strong emotions of fear, shame, or anger, is an\r\nexternal indication of the suffused state of the brain from such causes.\r\n\r\nIn exhibiting the causes, which injure the health of the mind, they\r\nwill be found to be partly physical, partly intellectual, and partly\r\nmoral.\r\n\r\nThe first cause of mental disease and suffering, is not unfrequently\r\nfound in the want of a proper supply of duly oxygenized blood. It has\r\nbeen shown, that the blood, in passing through the lungs, is purified,\r\nby the oxygen of the air combining with the superabundant hydrogen and\r\ncarbon of the venous blood, thus forming carbonic acid and water, which\r\nare expired into the atmosphere. Every pair of lungs is constantly\r\nwithdrawing from the surrounding atmosphere its healthful principle, and\r\nreturning one, which is injurious to human life.\r\n\r\nWhen, by confinement, and this process, the atmosphere is deprived of\r\nits appropriate supply of oxygen, the purification of the blood is\r\ninterrupted, and it passes, without being properly prepared, into the\r\nbrain, producing languor, restlessness, and inability to exercise the\r\nintellect and feelings. Whenever, therefore, persons sleep in a close\r\napartment, or remain, for a length of time, in a crowded or\r\nill-ventilated room, a most pernicious influence is exerted on the\r\nbrain, and, through this, on the mind. A person, who is often exposed to\r\nsuch influences, can never enjoy that elasticity and vigor of mind,\r\nwhich is one of the chief indications of its health. This is the reason,\r\nwhy all rooms for religious meetings, and all schoolrooms, and sleeping\r\napartments, should be so contrived, as to secure a constant supply of\r\nfresh air from without. The minister, who preaches in a crowded and\r\nill-ventilated apartment, loses much of his power to feel and to speak,\r\nwhile the audience are equally reduced, in their capability of\r\nattending. The teacher, who confines children in a close apartment,\r\ndiminishes their ability to study, or to attend to his instructions. And\r\nthe person, who habitually sleeps in a close room, impairs his mental\r\nenergies, in a similar degree. It is not unfrequently the case, that\r\ndepression of spirits, and stupor of intellect, are occasioned solely by\r\ninattention to this subject.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of mental disease, is, the excessive exercise of the\r\nintellect or feelings. If the eye is taxed, beyond its strength, by\r\nprotracted use, its blood-vessels become gorged, and the bloodshot\r\nappearance warns of the excess and the need of rest. The brain is\r\naffected, in a similar manner, by excessive use, though the suffering\r\nand inflamed organ cannot make its appeal to the eye. But there are some\r\nindications, which ought never to be misunderstood or disregarded. In\r\ncases of pupils, at school or at college, a diseased state, from over\r\naction, is often manifested by increased clearness of mind, and ease and\r\nvigor of mental action. In one instance, known to the writer, a most\r\nexemplary and industrious pupil, anxious to improve every hour, and\r\nignorant or unmindful of the laws of health, first manifested the\r\ndiseased state of her brain and mind, by demands for more studies, and a\r\nsudden and earnest activity in planning modes of improvement for herself\r\nand others. When warned of her danger, she protested that she never was\r\nbetter, in her life; that she took regular exercise, in the open air,\r\nwent to bed in season, slept soundly, and felt perfectly well; that her\r\nmind was never before so bright and clear, and study never so easy and\r\ndelightful. And at this time, she was on the verge of derangement, from\r\nwhich she was saved only by an entire cessation of all her intellectual\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nA similar case occurred, under the eye of the writer, from over-excited\r\nfeelings. It was during a time of unusual religious interest in the\r\ncommunity, and the mental disease was first manifested, by the pupil\r\nbringing her Hymn-book or Bible to the class-room, and making it her\r\nconstant resort, in every interval of school duty. It finally became\r\nimpossible to convince her, that it was her duty to attend to any thing\r\nelse; her conscience became morbidly sensitive, her perceptions\r\nindistinct, her deductions unreasonable, and nothing, but entire change\r\nof scene, exercise, and amusement, saved her. When the health of the\r\nbrain was restored, she found that she could attend to the \"one thing\r\nneedful,\" not only without interruption of duty, or injury of health,\r\nbut rather so as to promote both. Clergymen and teachers need most\r\ncarefully to notice and guard against the danger here alluded to.\r\n\r\nAny such attention to religion, as prevents the performance of daily\r\nduties and needful relaxation, is dangerous, as tending to produce such\r\na state of the brain, as makes it impossible to feel or judge correctly.\r\nAnd when any morbid and unreasonable pertinacity appears, much exercise,\r\nand engagement in other interesting pursuits, should be urged, as the\r\nonly mode of securing the religious benefits aimed at. And whenever any\r\nmind is oppressed with care, anxiety, or sorrow, the amount of active\r\nexercise in the fresh air should be greatly increased, that the action\r\nof the muscles may withdraw the blood, which, in such seasons, is\r\nconstantly tending too much to the brain.\r\n\r\nThere has been a most appalling amount of suffering, derangement,\r\ndisease, and death, occasioned by a want of attention to this subject,\r\nin teachers and parents. Uncommon precocity in children is usually the\r\nresult of an unhealthy state of the brain; and, in such cases, medical\r\nmen would now direct, that the wonderful child should be deprived of all\r\nbooks and study, and turned to play or work in the fresh air. Instead of\r\nthis, parents frequently add fuel to the fever of the brain, by\r\nsupplying constant mental stimulus, until the victim finds refuge in\r\nidiocy or an early grave. Where such fatal results do not occur, the\r\nbrain, in many cases, is so weakened, that the prodigy of infancy sinks\r\nbelow the medium of intellectual powers in afterlife. In our colleges,\r\ntoo, many of the most promising minds sink to an early grave, or drag\r\nout a miserable existence, from this same cause. And it is an evil, as\r\nyet little alleviated by the increase of physiological knowledge. Every\r\ncollege and professional school, and every seminary for young ladies,\r\nneeds a medical man, not only to lecture on physiology and the laws of\r\nhealth, but empowered, in his official capacity, to investigate the\r\ncase of every pupil, and, by authority, to restrain him to such a course\r\nof study, exercise, and repose, as his physical system requires. The\r\nwriter has found, by experience, that, in a large institution, there is\r\none class of pupils who need to be restrained, by penalties, from late\r\nhours and excessive study, as much as another class need stimulus to\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of excessive mental action, must be placed the indulgence\r\nof the imagination in _novel reading_ and _castle building_. This kind\r\nof stimulus, unless counterbalanced by physical exercise, not only\r\nwastes time and energies, but undermines the vigor of the nervous\r\nsystem. The imagination was designed, by our kind Creator, as the charm\r\nand stimulus to animate to benevolent activity; and its perverted\r\nexercise seldom fails to bring the appropriate penalty.\r\n\r\nA third cause of mental disease, is, the want of the appropriate\r\nexercise of the various faculties of the mind. On this point, Dr. Combe\r\nremarks, \"We have seen, that, by disuse, muscle becomes emaciated, bone\r\nsoftens, blood-vessels are obliterated, and nerves lose their\r\ncharacteristic structure. The brain is no exception to this general\r\nrule. Of it, also, the tone is impaired by permanent inactivity, and it\r\nbecomes less fit to manifest the mental powers with readiness and\r\nenergy.\" It is \"the withdrawal of the stimulus necessary for its healthy\r\nexercise, which renders solitary confinement so severe a punishment,\r\neven to the most daring minds. It is a lower degree of the same cause,\r\nwhich renders continuous seclusion from society so injurious, to both\r\nmental and bodily health.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Inactivity of intellect and of feeling_ is a very frequent\r\npredisposing cause of every form of nervous disease. For demonstrative\r\nevidence of this position, we have only to look at the numerous victims\r\nto be found, among persons who have no call to exertion in gaining the\r\nmeans of subsistence, and no objects of interest on which to exercise\r\ntheir mental faculties and who consequently sink into a state of mental\r\nsloth and nervous weakness.\" \"If we look abroad upon society, we shall\r\nfind innumerable examples of mental and nervous debility from this\r\ncause. When a person of some mental capacity is confined, for a long\r\ntime, to an unvarying round of employment, which affords neither scope\r\nnor stimulus for one half of his faculties, and, from want of education\r\nor society, has no external resources; his mental powers, for want of\r\nexercise, become blunted, and his perceptions slow and dull.\" \"The\r\nintellect and feelings, not being provided with interests external to\r\nthemselves, must either become inactive and weak, or work upon\r\nthemselves and become diseased.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most frequent victims of this kind of predisposition, are females\r\nof the middle and higher ranks, especially those of a nervous\r\nconstitution and _good natural abilities_; but who, from an ill-directed\r\neducation, possess nothing more solid than mere accomplishments, and\r\nhave no materials of thought,\" and no \"occupation to excite interest or\r\n_demand_ attention.\" \"The liability of such persons to melancholy,\r\nhysteria, hypochondriasis, and other varieties of mental distress,\r\nreally depends on a state of irritability of brain, induced by imperfect\r\nexercise.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks, of a medical man, illustrate the principles before\r\nindicated;--namely, that the demand of Christianity, that we live to\r\npromote the general happiness, and not merely for selfish indulgence,\r\nhas for its aim, not only the general good, but the highest happiness,\r\nof the individual of whom it is required.\r\n\r\nA person possessed of wealth, who has nothing more noble to engage his\r\nattention, than seeking his own personal enjoyment, subjects his mental\r\npowers and moral feelings to a degree of inactivity, utterly at war with\r\nhealth of mind. And the greater the capacities, the greater are the\r\nsufferings which result from this cause. Any one, who has read the\r\nmisanthropic wailings of Lord Byron, has seen the necessary result of\r\ngreat and noble powers bereft of their appropriate exercise, and, in\r\nconsequence, becoming sources of the keenest suffering.\r\n\r\nIt is this view of the subject, which has often awakened feelings of\r\nsorrow and anxiety in the mind of the writer, while aiding in the\r\ndevelopement and education of superior female minds, in the wealthier\r\ncircles. Not because there are not noble objects for interest and\r\neffort, abundant, and within reach of such minds; but because\r\nlong-established custom has made it seem so Quixotic, to the majority,\r\neven of the professed followers of Christ, for a woman of wealth to\r\npractise any great self-denial, that few have independence of mind and\r\nChristian principle sufficient to overcome such an influence. The more a\r\nmind has its powers developed, the more does it aspire and pine after\r\nsome object worthy of its energies and affections; and they are\r\ncommonplace and phlegmatic characters, who are most free from such\r\ndeep-seated wants. Many a young woman, of fine genius and elevated\r\nsentiment, finds a charm in Lord Byron's writings, because they present\r\na glowing picture of what, to a certain extent, must be felt by every\r\nwell-developed mind, which has no nobler object in life, than the\r\npursuit of its own gratification.\r\n\r\nIf young ladies of wealth could pursue their education, under the full\r\nconviction that the increase of their powers and advantages increased\r\ntheir obligations to use all for the good of society, and with some plan\r\nof benevolent enterprise in view, what new motives of interest would be\r\nadded to their daily pursuits! And what blessed results would follow, to\r\nour beloved Country, if all well-educated females carried out the\r\nprinciples of Christianity, in the exercise of their developed powers!\r\n\r\nIt is cheering to know, that there are women, among the most intelligent\r\nand wealthy, who can be presented as examples of what may be done, when\r\nthere is a heart to do. A pupil of the writer is among this number,\r\nwho, though a rich heiress, immediately, on the close of her\r\nschool-life, commenced a course of self-denying benevolence, in the\r\ncause of education. She determined to secure a superior female\r\ninstitution, in her native place, which should extend the benefits of\r\nthe best education to all in that vicinity, at a moderate charge.\r\nFinding no teacher on the ground, prepared to take the lead, and though\r\nherself a timid and retiring character, she began, with the aid of the\r\ngoverness in her mother's family, a daily school, superintending all,\r\nand teaching six hours a day. The liberal-minded and intelligent mother\r\ncooperated, and the result is a flourishing female seminary, with a\r\nlarge and beautiful and well-furnished building; the greater part of the\r\nmeans being supplied by the mother, and almost all by the members of\r\nthat family connection. And both these ladies will testify, that no time\r\nor money, spent for any other object, has ever secured to them more real\r\nand abiding enjoyment, than witnessing the results of this successful\r\nand benevolent enterprise, which, for years to come, will pour forth\r\nblessings on society.\r\n\r\nAnother lady could be pointed out, who, possessing some property, went\r\ninto a new western village, built and furnished her schoolhouse, and\r\nestablished herself there, to aid in raising a community from ignorance\r\nand gross worldliness, to intelligence and virtue. And in repeated\r\ninstances, among the friends and pupils of the writer, young ladies have\r\nleft wealthy homes, and affectionate friends, to find nobler enjoyments,\r\nin benevolent and active exertions to extend intelligence and virtue,\r\nwhere such disinterested laborers were needed. In other cases, where it\r\nwas not practicable to leave home, well-educated young ladies have\r\ninterested themselves in common schools in the vicinity, aiding the\r\nteachers, by their sympathy, counsel, and personal assistance.\r\n\r\nOther ladies, of property and standing, having families to educate, and\r\nbeing well qualified for such duties, have relinquished a large portion\r\nof domestic labor and superintendence, which humbler minds could be\r\nhired to perform, devoted themselves to the education of their children,\r\nand received others, less fortunate, to share with their own these\r\nsuperior advantages. But, so long as the feeling widely exists, that the\r\nincrease of God's bounties diminishes the obligations of self-denying\r\nservice for the good of mankind, so long will well-educated women, in\r\neasy circumstances, shrink from such confinement and exertion.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, however, that there are many benevolent and intelligent\r\nwomen, in this Country, who would gladly engage in such enterprises,\r\nwere there any appropriate way within their reach. And it is a question,\r\nwell deserving consideration, among those who guide the public mind in\r\nbenevolent enterprises, whether some organization is not demanded, which\r\nshall bring the whole community to act systematically, in voluntary\r\nassociations, to extend a proper education to every child in this\r\nNation, and to bring into activity all the female enterprise and\r\nbenevolence now lying dormant, for want of proper facilities to exercise\r\nthem. There are hundreds of villages, which need teachers, and that\r\nwould support them, if they were on the spot, but which never will send\r\nfor them. And there are hundreds of females, now unemployed, who would\r\nteach, if a proper place, and home, and support, and escort, were\r\nprovided for them. And there needs to be some enlarged and systematic\r\nplan, conducted by wise and efficient men, to secure these objects.\r\n\r\nCould such a plan, as the one suggested, be carried out, it is believed\r\nthat many female minds, now suffering, from diseases occasioned by want\r\nof appropriate objects for their energies, would be relieved. The duties\r\nof a teacher exercise every intellectual faculty, to its full extent;\r\nwhile, in this benevolent service, all the social, moral, and\r\nbenevolent, emotions, are kept in full play. The happiest persons the\r\nwriter has ever known,--those who could say that they were as happy as\r\nthey wished to be, in this world, (and she has seen such,)--were persons\r\nengaged in this employment.\r\n\r\nThe indications of a diseased mind, owing to a want of the proper\r\nexercise of its powers, are, apathy, discontent, a restless longing for\r\nexcitement, a craving for unattainable good, a diseased and morbid\r\naction of the imagination, dissatisfaction with the world, and\r\nfactitious interest in trifles which the mind feels to be unworthy of\r\nits powers. Such minds sometimes seek alleviation in exciting\r\namusements; others resort to the grosser enjoyments of sense. Oppressed\r\nwith the extremes of languor, or over-excitement, or apathy, the body\r\nfails under the wearing process, and adds new causes of suffering to the\r\nmind. Such, the compassionate Saviour calls to his service, in these\r\nappropriate terms: \"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,\r\nand I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me,\" \"and\r\nye shall find rest unto your souls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF DOMESTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no point, where the women of this Country need more wisdom,\r\npatience, principle, and self-control, than in relation to those whom\r\nthey employ in domestic service. The subject is attended with many\r\ndifficulties, which powerfully influence the happiness of families; and\r\nthe following suggestions are offered, to aid in securing right opinions\r\nand practice.\r\n\r\nOne consideration, which it would be well to bear in mind, on this\r\nsubject, is, that a large portion of the peculiar trials, which American\r\nwomen suffer from this source, are the necessary evils connected with\r\nour most valuable civil blessings. Every blessing of this life involves\r\nsome attendant liability to evil, from the same source; and, in this\r\ncase, while we rejoice at a state of society, which so much raises the\r\ncondition and advantages of our sex, the evils involved should be\r\nregarded as more than repaid, by the compensating benefits. If we\r\ncannot secure the cringing, submissive, well-trained, servants of\r\naristocratic lands, let us be consoled that we thus escape from the\r\nuntold miseries and oppression, which always attend that state of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of complaining that we cannot have our own peculiar\r\nadvantages, and those of other nations, too, or imagining how much\r\nbetter off we should be, if things were different from what they are, it\r\nis much wiser and more Christianlike to strive cheerfully to conform to\r\nactual circumstances; and, after remedying all that we can control,\r\npatiently to submit to what is beyond our power. If domestics are found\r\nto be incompetent, unstable, and unconformed to their station, it is\r\nPerfect Wisdom which appoints these trials, to teach us patience,\r\nfortitude, and self-control; and, if the discipline is met, in a proper\r\nspirit, it will prove a blessing, rather than an evil.\r\n\r\nBut, to judge correctly in regard to some of the evils involved in the\r\nstate of domestic service, in this Country, we should endeavor to\r\nconceive ourselves placed in the situation of those, of whom complaint\r\nis made, that we may not expect, from them, any more than it would seem\r\nright should be exacted from us, in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes urged, against domestics, that they exact exorbitant\r\nwages. But what is the rule of rectitude, on this subject? Is it not the\r\nuniversal law of labor and of trade, that an article is to be valued,\r\naccording to its scarcity and the demand? When wheat is scarce, the\r\nfarmer raises his price; and when a mechanic offers services, difficult\r\nto be obtained, he makes a corresponding increase of price. And why is\r\nit not right, for domestics to act according to a rule, allowed to be\r\ncorrect in reference to all other trades and professions? It is a fact,\r\nthat really good domestic service must continue to increase in value,\r\njust in proportion as this Country waxes rich and prosperous; thus\r\nmaking the proportion of those, who wish to hire labor, relatively\r\ngreater, and the number of those, willing to go to service, less.\r\n\r\nMoney enables the rich to gain many advantages, which those of more\r\nlimited circumstances cannot secure. One of these, is, securing good\r\ndomestics, by offering high wages; and this, as the scarcity of this\r\nclass increases, will serve constantly to raise the price of service. It\r\nis right for domestics to charge the market value, and this value is\r\nalways decided by the scarcity of the article and the amount of demand.\r\nRight views of this subject, will sometimes serve to diminish hard\r\nfeelings towards those, who would otherwise be wrongfully regarded as\r\nunreasonable and exacting.\r\n\r\nAnother complaint against domestics, is, that of instability and\r\ndiscontent, leading to perpetual change. But in reference to this, let a\r\nmother or daughter conceive of their own circumstances as so changed,\r\nthat the daughter must go out to service. Suppose a place is engaged,\r\nand it is then found that she must sleep in a comfortless garret; and\r\nthat, when a new domestic comes, perhaps a coarse and dirty foreigner,\r\nshe must share her bed with her. Another place is offered, where she can\r\nhave a comfortable room, and an agreeable room-mate; in such a case,\r\nwould not both mother and daughter think it right to change?\r\n\r\nOr, suppose, on trial, it was found that the lady of the house was\r\nfretful, or exacting, and hard to please; or, that her children were so\r\nungoverned, as to be perpetual vexations; or, that the work was so\r\nheavy, that no time was allowed for relaxation and the care of a\r\nwardrobe;--and another place offers, where these evils can be escaped:\r\nwould not mother and daughter here think it right to change? And is it\r\nnot right for domestics, as well as their employers, to seek places,\r\nwhere they can be most comfortable?\r\n\r\nIn some cases, this instability and love of change would be remedied, if\r\nemployers would take more pains to make a residence with them agreeable;\r\nand to attach domestics to the family, by feelings of gratitude and\r\naffection. There are ladies, even where well-qualified domestics are\r\nmost rare, who seldom find any trouble in keeping good and steady ones.\r\nAnd the reason is, that their domestics know they cannot better their\r\ncondition, by any change within reach. It is not merely by giving them\r\ncomfortable rooms, and good food, and presents, and privileges, that the\r\nattachment of domestics is secured; it is by the manifestation of a\r\nfriendly and benevolent interest in their comfort and improvement. This\r\nis exhibited, in bearing patiently with their faults; in kindly teaching\r\nthem how to improve; in showing them how to make and take proper care of\r\ntheir clothes; in guarding their health; in teaching them to read, if\r\nnecessary, and supplying them with proper books; and, in short, by\r\nendeavoring, so far as may be, to supply the place of parents. It is\r\nseldom that such a course would fail to secure steady service, and such\r\naffection and gratitude, that even higher wages would be ineffectual to\r\ntempt them away. There would probably be some cases of ungrateful\r\nreturns; but there is no doubt that the course indicated, if generally\r\npursued, would very much lessen the evil in question.\r\n\r\nAnother subject of complaint, in regard to domestics, is, their pride,\r\ninsubordination, and spirit not conformed to their condition. They are\r\nnot willing to be called _servants_; in some places, they claim a seat,\r\nat meals, with the family; they imitate a style of dress unbecoming\r\ntheir condition; and their manners and address are rude and\r\ndisrespectful. That these evils are very common, among this class of\r\npersons, cannot be denied; the only question is, how can they best be\r\nmet and remedied.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the common feeling among domestics, which is pained and\r\noffended by being called \"servants,\" there is need of some consideration\r\nand allowance. It should be remembered, that, in this Country, children,\r\nfrom their earliest years, are trained to abhor slavery, in reference\r\nto themselves, as the greatest of all possible shame and degradation.\r\nThey are perpetually hearing orations, songs, and compositions of all\r\nsorts, which set forth the honor and dignity of freemen, and heap scorn\r\nand contempt on all who would be so mean as to be slaves. Now the term\r\nservant, and the duties it involves, are, in the minds of many persons,\r\nnearly the same as those of slave. And there are few minds, entirely\r\nfree from associations which make servitude a degradation. It is not\r\nalways pride, then, which makes this term so offensive. It is a\r\nconsequence of that noble and generous spirit of freedom, which every\r\nAmerican draws from his mother's breast, and which ought to be\r\nrespected, rather than despised. In order to be respected, by others, we\r\nmust respect ourselves; and sometimes the ruder classes of society make\r\nclaims, deemed forward and offensive, when, with their views, such a\r\nposition seems indispensable to preserve a proper self-respect.\r\n\r\nWhere an excessive sensibility on this subject exists, and forward and\r\ndisrespectful manners result from it, the best remedy is, a kind attempt\r\nto give correct views, such as better-educated minds are best able to\r\nattain. It should be shown to them, that, in this Country, labor has\r\nceased to be degrading, in any class; that, in all classes, different\r\ngrades of subordination must exist; and that it is no more degrading,\r\nfor a domestic to regard the heads of a family as superiors in station,\r\nand treat them with becoming respect, than it is for children to do the\r\nsame, or for men to treat their rulers with respect and deference. They\r\nshould be taught, that domestics use a different entrance to the house,\r\nand sit at a distinct table, not because they are inferior beings, but\r\nbecause this is the best method of securing neatness, order, and\r\nconvenience. They can be shown, if it is attempted in a proper spirit\r\nand manner, that these very regulations really tend to their own ease\r\nand comfort, as well as to that of the family.\r\n\r\nThe writer has known a case, where the lady of the family, for the sake\r\nof convincing her domestic of the truth of these views, allowed her to\r\nfollow her own notions, for a short time, and join the family at meals.\r\nIt was merely required, as a condition, that she should always dress her\r\nhair as the other ladies did, and appear in a clean dress, and abide by\r\nall the rules of propriety at table, which the rest were required to\r\npractise, and which were duly detailed. The experiment was tried, two or\r\nthree times; and, although the domestic was treated with studious\r\npoliteness and kindness, she soon felt that she should be much more\r\ncomfortable in the kitchen, where she could talk, eat, and dress, as she\r\npleased. A reasonable domestic can also be made to feel the propriety of\r\nallowing opportunity for the family to talk freely of their private\r\naffairs, when they meet at meals, as they never could do, if restrained\r\nby the constant presence of a stranger. Such views, presented in a kind\r\nand considerate manner, will often entirely change the views of a\r\ndomestic, who is sensitive on such subjects.\r\n\r\nWhen a domestic is forward and bold in manners, and disrespectful in\r\naddress, a similar course can be pursued. It can be shown, that those,\r\nwho are among the best-bred and genteel, have courteous and respectful\r\nmanners and language to all they meet, while many, who have wealth, are\r\nregarded as vulgar, because they exhibit rude and disrespectful manners.\r\nThe very term, _gentle_man, indicates the refinement and delicacy of\r\naddress, which distinguishes the high-bred from the coarse and vulgar.\r\n\r\nIn regard to appropriate dress, in most cases it is difficult for an\r\nemployer to interfere, _directly_, with comments or advice. The most\r\nsuccessful mode, is, to offer some service in mending or making a\r\nwardrobe, and when a confidence in the kindness of feeling is thus\r\ngained, remarks and suggestions will generally be properly received, and\r\nnew views of propriety and economy can be imparted. In some cases, it\r\nmay be well for an employer,--who, from appearances, anticipates\r\ndifficulty of this kind,--in making the agreement, to state that she\r\nwishes to have the room, person, and dress of her domestics kept neat,\r\nand in order, and that she expects to remind them of their duty, in this\r\nparticular, if it is neglected. Domestics are very apt to neglect the\r\ncare of their own chambers and clothing; and such habits have a most\r\npernicious influence on their wellbeing, and on that of their children\r\nin future domestic life. An employer, then, is bound to exercise a\r\nparental care over them, in these respects.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the great deficiencies of domestics, in qualifications for\r\ntheir duties, much patience and benevolence are required. Multitudes\r\nhave never been taught to do their work properly; and, in such cases,\r\nhow unreasonable it would be to expect it of them! Most persons, of this\r\nclass, depend, for their knowledge in domestic affairs, not on their\r\nparents, who are usually unqualified to instruct them, but on their\r\nemployers; and if they live in a family where nothing is done neatly and\r\nproperly, they have no chance to learn how to perform their duties well.\r\nWhen a lady finds that she must employ a domestic who is ignorant,\r\nawkward, and careless, her first effort should be, to make all proper\r\nallowance for past want of instruction, and the next, to remedy the\r\nevil, by kind and patient teaching. In doing this, it should ever be\r\nborne in mind, that nothing is more difficult, than to change old\r\nhabits, and to learn to be thoughtful and considerate. And a woman must\r\nmake up her mind to tell the same thing \"over and over again,\" and yet\r\nnot lose her patience. It will often save much vexation, if, on the\r\narrival of a new domestic, the mistress of the family, or a daughter,\r\nwill, for two or three days, go round with the novice, and show the\r\nexact manner in which it is expected the work will be done. And this,\r\nalso, it may be well to specify in the agreement, as some domestics\r\nwould otherwise resent such a supervision.\r\n\r\nBut it is often remarked, that, after a woman has taken all this pains\r\nto instruct a domestic, and make her a good one, some other person will\r\noffer higher wages, and she will leave. This, doubtless, is a sore\r\ntrial; but, if such efforts were made in the true spirit of benevolence,\r\nthe lady will still have her reward, in the consciousness that she has\r\ncontributed to the welfare of society, by making one more good domestic,\r\nand one more comfortable family where that domestic is employed; and if\r\nthe latter becomes the mother of a family, a whole circle of children\r\nwill share in the benefit.\r\n\r\nThere is one great mistake, not unfrequently made, in the management\r\nboth of domestics and of children; and that is, in supposing that the\r\nway to cure defects, is by finding fault as each failing occurs. But,\r\ninstead of this being true, in many cases the directly opposite course\r\nis the best; while, in all instances, much good judgement is required,\r\nin order to decide when to notice faults, and when to let them pass\r\nunnoticed. There are some minds, very sensitive, easily discouraged, and\r\ninfirm of purpose. Such persons, when they have formed habits of\r\nnegligence, haste, and awkwardness, often need expressions of sympathy\r\nand encouragement, rather than reproof. They have usually been found\r\nfault with, so much, that they have become either hardened or\r\ndesponding; and it is often the case, that a few words of commendation\r\nwill awaken fresh efforts and renewed hope. In almost every case, words\r\nof kindness, confidence, and encouragement, should be mingled with the\r\nneedful admonitions or reproof.\r\n\r\nIt is a good rule, in reference to this point, to _forewarn_, instead of\r\nfinding fault. Thus, when a thing has been done wrong, let it pass\r\nunnoticed, till it is to be done again; and then, a simple request, to\r\nhave it done in the right way, will secure quite as much, and probably\r\nmore, willing effort, than a reproof administered for neglect. Some\r\npersons seem to take it for granted, that young and inexperienced minds\r\nare bound to have all the forethought and discretion of mature persons;\r\nand freely express wonder and disgust, when mishaps occur for want of\r\nthese traits. But it would be far better to save from mistake or\r\nforgetfulness, by previous caution and care on the part of those who\r\nhave gained experience and forethought; and thus many occasions of\r\ncomplaint and ill-humor will be avoided.\r\n\r\nThose, who fill the places of heads of families, are not very apt to\r\nthink how painful it is, to be chided for neglect of duty, or for faults\r\nof character. If they would sometimes imagine themselves in the place of\r\nthose whom they control, with some person daily administering reproof to\r\nthem, in the same _tone and style_ as they employ to those who are under\r\nthem, it might serve as a useful check to their chidings. It is often\r\nthe case, that persons, who are most strict and exacting, and least able\r\nto make allowances and receive palliations, are themselves peculiarly\r\nsensitive to any thing which implies that they are in fault. By such,\r\nthe spirit implied in the Divine petition, \"forgive us our trespasses as\r\nwe forgive those who trespass against us,\" needs especially to be\r\ncherished.\r\n\r\nOne other consideration, is very important. There is no duty, more\r\nbinding on Christians, than that of patience and meekness under\r\nprovocations and disappointment. Now, the tendency of every sensitive\r\nmind, when thwarted in its wishes, is, to complain and find fault, and\r\nthat often in tones of fretfulness or anger. But there are few\r\ndomestics, who have not heard enough of the Bible, to know that angry or\r\nfretful fault-finding, from the mistress of a family, when her work is\r\nnot done to suit her, is not in agreement with the precepts of Christ.\r\nThey notice and feel the inconsistency; and every woman, when she gives\r\nway to feelings of anger and impatience, at the faults of those around\r\nher, lowers herself in their respect, while her own conscience, unless\r\nvery much blinded, cannot but suffer a wound.\r\n\r\nThere are some women, who, in the main, are amiable, who seem impressed\r\nwith the idea, that it is their office and duty to find fault with their\r\ndomestics, whenever any thing is not exactly right, and follow their\r\nfancied calling without the least appearance of tenderness or sympathy,\r\nas if the objects of their discipline were stocks or stones. The writer\r\nonce heard a domestic, describing her situation in a family which she\r\nhad left, make this remark of her past employer: \"She was a very good\r\nhousekeeper, allowed good wages, and gave us many privileges and\r\npresents; but if we ever did any thing wrong, she always _talked to us\r\njust as if she thought we had no feelings_, and I never was so unhappy\r\nin my life, as while living with her.\" And this was said of a\r\nkind-hearted and conscientious woman, by a very reasonable and amiable\r\ndomestic.\r\n\r\nEvery woman, who has the care of domestics, should cultivate a habit of\r\nregarding them with that sympathy and forbearance, which she would wish\r\nfor herself or her daughters, if deprived of parents, fortune, and home.\r\nThe fewer advantages they have enjoyed, and the greater difficulties of\r\ntemper or of habit they have to contend with, the more claims they have\r\non compassionate forbearance. They ought ever to be looked upon, not as\r\nthe mere ministers to our comfort and convenience, but as the humbler\r\nand more neglected children of our Heavenly Father, whom He has sent to\r\nclaim our sympathy and aid.[N]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[N] The excellent little work of Miss Sedgwick, entitled 'Live, and Let\r\nLive,' contains many valuable and useful hints, conveyed in a most\r\npleasing narrative form, which every housekeeper would do well to read.\r\nThe writer also begs leave to mention a work of her own, entitled,\r\n'Letters to Persons engaged in Domestic Service.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF INFANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery young lady ought to learn how to take proper care of an infant;\r\nfor, even if she is never to become the responsible guardian of a\r\nnursery, she will often be in situations where she can render\r\nbenevolent aid to others, in this most fatiguing and anxious duty.\r\n\r\nThe writer has known instances, in which young ladies, who, having been\r\ntrained, by their mothers, properly to perform this duty, were, in some\r\ncases, the means of saving the lives of infants, and in others, of\r\nrelieving, by their benevolent aid, sick mothers, from intolerable care\r\nand anguish.\r\n\r\nOn this point, Dr. Combe remarks, \"All women are not destined, in the\r\ncourse of Nature, to become mothers; but how very small is the number of\r\nthose, who are unconnected, by family ties, friendship, or sympathy,\r\nwith the children of others! How very few are there, who, at some time\r\nor other of their lives, would not find their usefulness and happiness\r\nincreased, by the possession of a kind of knowledge, intimately allied\r\nto their best feelings and affections! And how important is it, to the\r\nmother herself, that her efforts should be seconded by intelligent,\r\ninstead of ignorant, assistants!\"\r\n\r\nIn order to be prepared for such benevolent ministries, every young lady\r\nshould improve the opportunity, whenever it is afforded her, for\r\nlearning how to wash, dress, and tend, a young infant; and whenever she\r\nmeets with such a work as Dr. Combe's, on the management of infants, she\r\nought to read it, and _remember_ its contents.\r\n\r\nIt was the design of the author, to fill this chapter chiefly with\r\nextracts from various medical writers, giving some of the most important\r\ndirections on this subject; but finding these extracts too prolix for a\r\nwork of this kind, she has condensed them into a shorter compass. Some\r\nare quoted verbatim, and some are abridged, chiefly from the writings of\r\nDoctors Combe, Bell, and Eberle, who are among the most approved writers\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly one half of the deaths, occurring during the first two years of\r\nexistence, are ascribable to mismanagement, and to errors in diet. At\r\nbirth, the stomach is feeble, and as yet unaccustomed to food; its\r\ncravings are consequently easily satisfied, and frequently renewed.\"\r\n\"At that early age, there ought to be no fixed time for giving\r\nnourishment. The stomach cannot be thus satisfied.\" \"The active call of\r\nthe infant, is a sign, which needs never be mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nBut care must be taken to determine between the crying of pain or\r\nuneasiness, and the call for food; and the practice of giving an infant\r\nfood, to stop its cries, is often the means of increasing its\r\nsufferings. After a child has satisfied its hunger, from two to four\r\nhours should intervene, before another supply is given.\r\n\r\n\"At birth, the stomach and bowels, never having been used, contain a\r\nquantity of mucous secretion, which requires to be removed. To effect\r\nthis, Nature has rendered the first portions of the mother's milk\r\npurposely watery and laxative. Nurses, however, distrusting Nature,\r\noften hasten to administer some active purgative; and the consequence\r\noften is, irritation in the stomach and bowels, not easily subdued.\" It\r\nis only where the child is deprived of its mother's milk, as the first\r\nfood, that some gentle laxative should be given.\r\n\r\n\"It is a common mistake, to suppose, that, because a woman is nursing,\r\nshe ought to live very fully, and to add an allowance of wine, porter,\r\nor other fermented liquor, to her usual diet. The only result of this\r\nplan, is, to cause an unnatural fulness in the system, which places the\r\nnurse on the brink of disease, and retards, rather than increases, the\r\nfood of the infant. More will be gained by the observance of the\r\nordinary laws of health, than by any foolish deviation, founded on\r\nignorance.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no point, on which medical men so emphatically lift the voice\r\nof warning, as in reference to administering medicines to infants. It is\r\nso difficult to discover what is the matter with an infant, its frame is\r\nso delicate and so susceptible, and slight causes have such a powerful\r\ninfluence, that it requires the utmost skill and judgement to ascertain\r\nwhat would be proper medicines, and the proper quantity to be given.\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Combe, \"That there are cases, in which active means must be\r\npromptly used, to save the child, is perfectly true. But it is not less\r\ncertain, that these are cases, of which no mother or nurse ought to\r\nattempt the treatment. As a general rule, where the child is well\r\nmanaged, medicine, of any kind, is very rarely required; and if disease\r\nwere more generally regarded in its true light, not as something thrust\r\ninto the system, which requires to be expelled by force, but as an\r\naberration from a natural mode of action, produced by some external\r\ncause, we should be in less haste to attack it by medicine, and more\r\nwatchful in its prevention. Accordingly, where a constant demand for\r\nmedicine exists in a nursery, the mother may rest assured, that there is\r\nsomething essentially wrong in the treatment of her children.\r\n\r\n\"Much havoc is made among infants, by the abuse of calomel and other\r\nmedicines, which procure momentary relief, but end by producing\r\nincurable disease; and it has often excited my astonishment, to see how\r\nrecklessly remedies of this kind are had recourse to, on the most\r\ntrifling occasions, by mothers and nurses, who would be horrified, if\r\nthey knew the nature of the power they are wielding, and the extent of\r\ninjury they are inflicting.\"\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of depending on medicine, for the preservation of the\r\nhealth and life of an infant, the following precautions and preventives\r\nshould be adopted.\r\n\r\nTake particular care of the _food_ of an infant. If it is nourished by\r\nthe mother, her own diet should be simple, nourishing, and temperate. If\r\nthe child be brought up by hand, the milk of a new-milch cow, mixed with\r\none third water, and sweetened a little with _white_ sugar, should be\r\nthe only food given, until the teeth come. This is more suitable, than\r\nany preparations of flour or arrow-root, the nourishment of which is too\r\nhighly concentrated. Never give a child _bread_, _cake_, or _meat_,\r\nbefore the teeth appear. If the food appear to distress the child, after\r\neating, first ascertain if the milk be really from a new-milch cow, as\r\nit may otherwise be too old. Learn, also, whether the cow lives on\r\nproper food. Cows that are fed on _still-slops_, as is often the case in\r\ncities, furnish milk which is very unhealthful.\r\n\r\nBe sure and keep a good supply of pure and fresh air, in the nursery. On\r\nthis point, Dr. Bell remarks, respecting rooms constructed without\r\nfireplaces, and without doors or windows to let in pure air, from\r\nwithout, \"The sufferings of children of feeble constitutions, are\r\nincreased, beyond measure, by such lodgings as these. _An action,\r\nbrought by the Commonwealth_, ought to lie against those persons, who\r\nbuild houses for sale or rent, in which rooms are so constructed as not\r\nto allow of free ventilation; and _a writ of lunacy_ taken out against\r\nthose, who, with the common-sense experience which all have on this\r\nhead, should spend any portion of their time, still more, should sleep,\r\nin rooms thus nearly air-tight.\"\r\n\r\nAfter it is a month or two old, take an infant out to walk, or ride, in\r\na little wagon, every fair and warm day; but be very careful that its\r\nfeet, and every part of its body, are kept warm: and be sure that its\r\neyes are well protected from the light. Weak eyes, and sometimes\r\nblindness, are caused by neglecting this precaution. Keep the head of an\r\ninfant cool, never allowing too warm bonnets, nor permitting it to sink\r\ninto soft pillows, when asleep. Keeping an infant's head too warm, very\r\nmuch increases nervous irritability; and this is the reason why medical\r\nmen forbid the use of caps for infants. But the head of an infant\r\nshould, especially while sleeping, be protected from draughts of air,\r\nand from getting cold.\r\n\r\nBe very careful of the skin of an infant, as nothing tends so\r\neffectually to prevent disease. For this end, it should be washed all\r\nover, every morning, and then gentle friction should be applied, with\r\nthe hand, to the back, stomach, bowels, and limbs. The head should be\r\nthoroughly washed, every day, and then brushed with a soft hair-brush,\r\nor combed with a fine comb. If, by neglect, dirt accumulates under the\r\nhair, apply, with the finger, the yolk of an egg, and then the fine comb\r\nwill remove it all, without any trouble.\r\n\r\nDress the infant, so that it will be always warm, but not so as to cause\r\nperspiration. Be sure and keep its feet _always_ warm; and, for this\r\nend, often warm them at a fire, and use long dresses. Keep the neck and\r\narms covered. For this purpose, wrappers, open in front, made high in\r\nthe neck, with long sleeves, to put on over the frock, are now very\r\nfashionable.\r\n\r\nIt is better for both mother and child, that it should not sleep on the\r\nmother's arm, at night, unless the weather be extremely cold. This\r\npractice keeps the child too warm, and leads it to seek food too\r\nfrequently. A child should ordinarily take nourishment but twice in the\r\nnight. A crib beside the mother, with a plenty of warm and light\r\ncovering, is best for the child; but the mother must be sure that it is\r\nalways kept warm. Never cover a child's head, so that it will inhale the\r\nair of its own lungs. In very warm weather, especially in cities, great\r\npains should be taken, to find fresh and cool air, by rides and sailing.\r\nWalks in a public square, in the cool of the morning, and frequent\r\nexcursions in ferry or steam-boats, would often save a long bill for\r\nmedical attendance. In hot nights, the windows should be kept open, and\r\nthe infant laid on a mattress, or on folded blankets. A bit of straw\r\nmatting, laid over a featherbed, and covered with the under sheet, makes\r\na very cool bed for an infant.\r\n\r\nCool bathing, in hot weather, is very useful; but the water should be\r\nvery little cooler than the skin of the child. When the constitution is\r\ndelicate, the water should be slightly warmed. Simply sponging the body,\r\nfreely, in a tub, answers the same purpose as a regular bath. In very\r\nwarm weather, this should be done two or three times a day, always\r\nwaiting two or three hours after food has been given.\r\n\r\n\"When the stomach is peculiarly irritable, (from teething,) it is of\r\nparamount necessity to withhold all the nostrums which have been so\r\nfalsely lauded as 'sovereign cures for _cholera infantum_.' The true\r\nrestoratives, to a child threatened with disease, are, cool air, cool\r\nbathing, and cool drinks of simple water, in addition to _proper_ food,\r\nat stated intervals.\" Do not take the advice of mothers, who tell of\r\nthis, that, and the other thing, which have proved excellent remedies in\r\ntheir experience. Children have different constitutions, and there are\r\nmultitudes of different causes for their sickness; and what might cure\r\none child, might kill another, which _appeared_ to have the same\r\ncomplaint. A mother should go on the general rule, of giving an infant\r\nvery little medicine, and then only by the direction of a discreet and\r\nexperienced physician. And there are cases, when, according to the views\r\nof the most distinguished and competent practitioners, physicians\r\nthemselves are much too free in using medicines, instead of adopting\r\n_preventive_ measures.\r\n\r\nDo not allow a child to form such habits, that it will not be quiet,\r\nunless tended and amused. A healthy child should be accustomed to lie or\r\nsit in its cradle, much of the time; but it should occasionally be taken\r\nup, and tossed, or carried about, for exercise and amusement. An infant\r\nshould be encouraged to _creep_, as an exercise very strengthening and\r\nuseful. If the mother fears the soiling of its nice dresses, she can\r\nkeep a long slip or apron, which will entirely cover the dress, and can\r\nbe removed, when the child is taken in the arms. A child should not be\r\nallowed, when quite young, to bear its weight on its feet, very long at\r\na time, as this tends to weaken and distort the limbs.\r\n\r\nMany mothers, with a little painstaking, succeed in putting their\r\ninfants, while awake, into their cradle, at regular hours, for sleep,\r\nand induce regularity in other habits, which saves much trouble. In\r\ndoing this, a child may cry, at first, a great deal; but for a healthy\r\nchild, this use of the lungs does no harm, and tends rather to\r\nstrengthen, than to injure, them. A child who is trained to lie or sit,\r\nand amuse itself, is happier than one who is carried and tended a great\r\ndeal, and thus rendered restless and uneasy when not so indulged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nON THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the physical education of children, Dr. Clarke, Physician\r\nin Ordinary to the Queen of England, expresses views, on one point, in\r\nwhich most physicians would coincide. He says, \"There is no greater\r\nerror in the management of children, than that of giving them animal\r\ndiet very early. By persevering in the use of an overstimulating diet,\r\nthe digestive organs become irritated, and the various secretions,\r\nimmediately connected with, and necessary to, digestion, are diminished,\r\nespecially the _biliary secretion_. Children, so fed, become very liable\r\nto attacks of fever, and of inflammation, affecting, particularly, the\r\nmucous membranes; and measles, and the other diseases incident to\r\nchildhood, are generally severe in their attack.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some popular notions on the subject of the use of animal food,\r\nwhich need to be corrected.\r\n\r\nOne mistake, is, in supposing that the formation of the human teeth and\r\nstomach indicate that man was designed to feed on flesh. Linnaeus says,\r\nthat the organization of man, when compared with other animals, shows,\r\nthat \"fruits and esculent vegetables constitute his most suitable food.\"\r\nBaron Cuvier, the highest authority on comparative anatomy, says, \"the\r\nnatural food of man, _judging from his structure_, appears to consist of\r\nfruits, roots, and other succulent parts of vegetables.\"\r\n\r\nAnother common mistake, is, that the stimulus of animal food is\r\nnecessary for the full developement of the physical and intellectual\r\npowers. This notion is disproved by facts. The inhabitants of Lapland\r\nand Kamtschatka, who live altogether on animal food, are among the\r\nsmallest, weakest, and most timid, of races. But the Scotch Highlanders,\r\nwho, in a very cold climate, live almost exclusively on milk and\r\nvegetable diet, are among the bravest, largest, and most athletic, of\r\nmen. The South-Sea Islanders, who live almost exclusively on fruits and\r\nvegetables, are said to be altogether superior to English sailors, in\r\nstrength and agility. An intelligent gentleman, who spent many months in\r\nSiberia, testifies, that no exiles endure the climate better than those,\r\nwho have all their lives been accustomed to a vegetable diet. The\r\nstoutest and largest tribes in Africa, live solely on vegetable diet,\r\nand the bright, intelligent, and active Arabs, live entirely on milk and\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nThe popular notion is, that animal food is more nourishing than\r\nvegetable; but on this point, scientific men hold different opinions.\r\nExperiments, repeatedly made by some chemists, seem to prove the\r\ncontrary. Tables have been prepared, showing the amount of nutriment in\r\neach kind of food, by which it would appear, that, while beef contains\r\nthirty-five per cent. of nutritious matter, wheat-bread and rice contain\r\nfrom eighty to ninety-five per cent. The supposed mistake is attributed\r\nto the fact, that, on account of the stimulating nature of animal food,\r\nit digests easier and more quickly than vegetables. Many physicians,\r\nhowever, among them, Dr. Combe,[O] are of opinion, that animal food\r\n\"contains a greater quantity of nutriment in a given bulk, than either\r\nherbaceous or farinaceous food.\" In some diseases, too, meat is better\r\nfor the stomach than vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe largest proportion of those, who have been remarkable for having\r\nlived to the greatest age, were persons, whose diet was almost\r\nexclusively vegetables; and it is a well-known fact, that the pulse of a\r\nhardy and robust man, who lives on simple vegetable diet, is from ten\r\nto twenty beats less in a minute, than that of men who live on a mixed\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the intellect, Dr. Franklin asserted, from experience, that\r\nan exclusively vegetable diet \"promotes clearness of ideas and quickness\r\nof perception; and is to be preferred, by all who labor with the mind.\"\r\nThe mightiest efforts of Sir Isaac Newton, were performed, while\r\nnourished only by bread and water. Many other men, distinguished by\r\nintellectual vigor, give similar testimony. These facts show that animal\r\nfood is not needful, to secure the perfect developement of mind or\r\nbody.[P]\r\n\r\nThe result of the treatment of the inmates of the Orphan Asylum, at\r\nAlbany, is one, upon which all, who have the care of young children,\r\nshould deeply ponder. During the first six years of the existence of\r\nthis Institution, its average number of children was eighty. For the\r\nfirst three years, their diet was meat once a day, fine bread, rice,\r\nIndian puddings, vegetables, fruit, and milk. Considerable attention was\r\ngiven to clothing, fresh air, and exercise; and they were bathed once in\r\nthree weeks. During these three years, from four to six children, and\r\nsometimes more, were continually on the sick-list; one or two assistant\r\nnurses were necessary; a physician was called, two or three times a\r\nweek; and, in this time, there were between thirty and forty deaths. At\r\nthe end of this period, the management was changed, in these\r\nrespects:--daily ablutions of the whole body were practised; bread of\r\nunbolted flour was substituted for that of fine wheat; and all animal\r\nfood was banished. More attention also was paid to clothing, bedding,\r\nfresh air, and exercise. The result was, that the nursery was vacated;\r\nthe nurse and physician were no longer needed; and, for two years, not a\r\nsingle case of sickness or death occurred. The third year, also, there\r\nwere no deaths, except those of two idiots and one other child, all of\r\nwhom were new inmates, who had not been subjected to this treatment. The\r\nteachers of the children also testified, that there was a manifest\r\nincrease of intellectual vigor and activity, while there was much less\r\nirritability of temper.\r\n\r\nLet parents, nurses, and teachers, reflect on the above statement, and\r\nbear in mind, that stupidity of intellect, and irritability of temper,\r\nas well as ill health, are often caused by the mismanagement of the\r\nnursery, in regard to the physical training of children. There is\r\nprobably no practice, more deleterious, than that of allowing children\r\nto eat at short intervals, through the day. As the stomach is thus kept\r\nconstantly at work, with no time for repose, its functions are deranged,\r\nand a weak or disordered stomach is the frequent result. Children should\r\nbe required to keep cakes, nuts, and other good things which they may\r\nhave to eat, till just before a meal, and then they will form a part of\r\ntheir regular supply. This is better, than to wait till after their\r\nhunger is satisfied by food, when they will eat their niceties merely to\r\ngratify the palate, and thus overload the stomach.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the intellectual training of young children, some\r\nmodification in the common practice is necessary, with reference to\r\ntheir physical wellbeing. More care is needful, in providing\r\n_well-ventilated_ schoolrooms, and in securing more time for sports in\r\nthe open air, during school hours. It is very important, to most\r\nmothers, that their young children should be removed from their care,\r\nduring the six school hours; and it is very useful, to quite young\r\nchildren, to be subjected to the discipline of a school, and to\r\nintercourse with other children of their own age. And, with a suitable\r\nteacher, it is no matter how early children are sent to school, provided\r\ntheir health is not endangered, by impure air, too much confinement, and\r\ntoo great mental stimulus.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the formation of the moral character, it has been too much\r\nthe case, that the discipline of the nursery has consisted of\r\ndisconnected efforts to make children either do, or refrain from doing,\r\ncertain particular acts. Do this, and be rewarded; do that, and be\r\npunished; is the ordinary routine of family government.\r\n\r\nBut children can be very early taught, that their happiness, both now\r\nand hereafter, depends on the formation of _habits of submission,\r\nself-denial_, and _benevolence_. And all the discipline of the nursery\r\ncan be conducted by the parents, not only with this general aim in their\r\nown minds, but also with the same object daily set before the minds of\r\nthe children. Whenever their wishes are crossed, or their wills subdued,\r\nthey can be taught, that all this is done, not merely to please the\r\nparent, or to secure some good to themselves or to others; but as a part\r\nof that merciful training, which is designed to form such a character,\r\nand such habits, that they can hereafter find their chief happiness in\r\ngiving up their will to God, and in living to do good to others, instead\r\nof living merely to please themselves.\r\n\r\nIt can be pointed out to them, that they must always submit their will\r\nto the will of God, or else be continually miserable. It can be shown,\r\nhow in the nursery, and in the school, and through all future days, a\r\nchild must practise the giving up of his will and wishes, when they\r\ninterfere with the rights and comfort of others; and how important it\r\nis, early to learn to do this, so that it will, by habit, become easy\r\nand agreeable. It can be shown, how children, who are indulged in all\r\ntheir wishes, and who are never accustomed to any self-denial, always\r\nfind it hard to refrain from what injures themselves and others. It can\r\nbe shown, also, how important it is, for every person, to form such\r\nhabits of benevolence, towards others, that self-denial, in doing good,\r\nwill become easy.\r\n\r\nParents have learned, by experience, that children can be constrained,\r\nby authority and penalties, to exercise self-denial, for _their own_\r\ngood, till a habit is formed, which makes the duty comparatively easy.\r\nFor example, well-trained children can be accustomed to deny themselves\r\ntempting articles of food, which are injurious, until the practice\r\nceases to be painful and difficult. Whereas, an indulged child would be\r\nthrown into fits of anger or discontent, when its wishes were crossed,\r\nby restraints of this kind.\r\n\r\nBut it has not been so readily discerned, that the same method is\r\nneedful, in order to form a habit of self-denial, in doing good to\r\nothers. It has been supposed, that, while children must be forced, by\r\n_authority_, to be self-denying and prudent, in regard to their own\r\nhappiness, it may properly be left to their own discretion, whether they\r\nwill practise any self-denial in doing good to others. But the more\r\ndifficult a duty is, the greater is the need of parental authority, in\r\nforming a habit, which will make that duty easy.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure this, some parents turn their earliest efforts to\r\nthis object. They require the young child always to offer to others a\r\npart of every thing which it receives; always to comply with all\r\nreasonable requests of others for service; and often to practise little\r\nacts of self-denial, in order to secure some enjoyment for others. If\r\none child receives a present of some nicety, he is required to share it\r\nwith all his brothers and sisters. If one asks his brother to help him\r\nin some sport, and is met with a denial, the parent requires the\r\nunwilling child to act benevolently, and give up some of his time to\r\nincrease his brother's enjoyment. Of course, in such an effort as this,\r\ndiscretion must be used, as to the frequency and extent of the exercise\r\nof authority, to induce a habit of benevolence. But, where parents\r\ndeliberately aim at such an object, and wisely conduct their\r\ninstructions and discipline to secure it, very much will be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nReligious influence should be brought to bear directly upon this point.\r\nIn the very beginning of religious instruction, Jesus Christ should be\r\npresented to the child, as that great and good Being, who came into\r\nthis world to teach children how to be happy, both here and hereafter.\r\nHe, who made it His meat and drink to do the will of His Heavenly\r\nFather; who, in the humblest station, and most destitute condition,\r\ndenied Himself, daily, and went about doing good; should constantly be\r\npresented as the object of their imitation. And as nothing so strongly\r\ninfluences the minds of children, as the sympathy and example of a\r\n_present_ friend, all those, who believe Him to be an _ever-present\r\nSaviour_, should avail themselves of this powerful aid. Under such\r\ntraining, Jesus Christ should be constantly presented to them, as their\r\never-watchful, tender, and sympathizing friend. If the abstract idea of\r\nan unembodied Spirit with the majestic attributes of Deity, be difficult\r\nfor the mind of infancy to grasp, the simple, the gentle, the lovely,\r\ncharacter of Christ, is exactly adapted to the wants and comprehension\r\nof a child. In this view, how touching is the language of the Saviour,\r\nto His misjudging disciples, \"Suffer _the little children_ to come unto\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to forming habits of obedience, there have been two extremes,\r\nboth of which need to be shunned. One is, a stern and unsympathizing\r\nmaintenance of parental authority, demanding perfect and constant\r\nobedience, without any attempt to convince a child of the propriety and\r\nbenevolence of the requisitions, and without any manifestation of\r\nsympathy and tenderness for the pain and difficulties which are to be\r\nmet. Under such discipline, children grow up to fear their parents,\r\nrather than to love and trust them; while some of the most valuable\r\nprinciples of character, are chilled, or forever blasted.\r\n\r\nIn shunning this danger, other parents pass to the opposite extreme.\r\nThey put themselves too much on the footing of equals with their\r\nchildren, as if little were due to superiority of relation, age, and\r\nexperience. Nothing is exacted, without the implied concession that the\r\nchild is to be a judge of the propriety of the requisition; and reason\r\nand persuasion are employed, where simple command and obedience would be\r\nfar better. This system produces a most pernicious influence. Children\r\nsoon perceive the position, thus allowed them, and take every advantage\r\nof it. They soon learn to dispute parental requirements, acquire habits\r\nof forwardness and conceit, assume disrespectful manners and address,\r\nmaintain their views with pertinacity, and yield to authority with\r\nill-humor and resentment, as if their rights were infringed.\r\n\r\nThe medium course, is, for the parent to take the attitude of a\r\nsuperior, in age, knowledge, and relation, who has a perfect right to\r\ncontrol every action of the child, and that, too, without giving any\r\nreason for the requisitions. \"Obey, _because your parent commands_,\" is\r\nalways a proper and sufficient reason.\r\n\r\nBut care should be taken, to convince the child that the parent is\r\nconducting a course of discipline, designed to make him happy; and in\r\nforming habits of implicit obedience, self-denial, and benevolence, the\r\nchild should have the reasons for most requisitions kindly stated;\r\nnever, however, on the demand of it, from the child, as a right, but as\r\nan act of kindness from the parent.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to govern children properly, especially those of strong\r\nand sensitive feelings, without a constant effort to appreciate the\r\nvalue which they attach to their enjoyments and pursuits. A lady, of\r\ngreat strength of mind and sensibility, once told the writer, that one\r\nof the most acute periods of suffering, in her whole life, was\r\noccasioned by the burning up of some milkweed-silk, by her mother. The\r\nchild had found, for the first time, some of this shining and beautiful\r\nsubstance; was filled with delight at her discovery; was arranging it in\r\nparcels; planning its future uses, and her pleasure in showing it to her\r\ncompanions,--when her mother, finding it strewed over the carpet,\r\nhastily swept it into the fire, and that, too, with so indifferent an\r\nair, that the child fled away, almost distracted with grief and\r\ndisappointment. The mother little realized the pain she had inflicted,\r\nbut the child felt the unkindness, so severely, that for several days\r\nher mother was an object almost of aversion.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the parent needs to carry on a steady course, which\r\nwill oblige the child always to give up its will, whenever its own good,\r\nor the greater claims of others, require it, this should be constantly\r\nconnected with the expression of a tender sympathy, for the trials and\r\ndisappointments thus inflicted. Those, who will join with children, and\r\nhelp them along in their sports, will learn, by this mode, to understand\r\nthe feelings and interests of childhood; while, at the same time, they\r\nsecure a degree of confidence and affection, which cannot be gained so\r\neasily, in any other way. And it is to be regretted, that parents so\r\noften relinquish this most powerful mode of influence, to domestics and\r\nplaymates, who often use it in the most pernicious manner. In joining in\r\nsuch sports, older persons should never relinquish the attitude of\r\nsuperiors, or allow disrespectful manners or address. And respectful\r\ndeportment is never more cheerfully accorded, than in seasons, when\r\nyoung hearts are pleased, and made grateful, by having their tastes and\r\nenjoyments so efficiently promoted.\r\n\r\nNext to the want of all government, the two most fruitful sources of evil\r\nto children, are, _unsteadiness_ in government, and _over-government_.\r\nMost of the cases, in which the children of sensible and conscientious\r\nparents turn out badly, result from one or the other of these causes. In\r\ncases of unsteady government, either one parent is very strict, severe,\r\nand unbending, and the other excessively indulgent, or else the parents\r\nare sometimes very strict and decided, and at other times allow\r\ndisobedience to go unpunished. In such cases, children, never knowing\r\nexactly when they can escape with impunity, are constantly tempted to\r\nmake the trial.\r\n\r\nThe bad effects of this, can be better appreciated, by reference to one\r\nimportant principle of the mind. It is found to be universally true,\r\nthat, when any object of desire is put entirely beyond the reach of hope\r\nor expectation, the mind very soon ceases to long for it, and turns to\r\nother objects of pursuit. But, so long as the mind is hoping for some\r\ngood, and making efforts to obtain it, any opposition excites irritable\r\nfeelings. Let the object be put entirely beyond all hope, and this\r\nirritation soon ceases. In consequence of this principle, those\r\nchildren, who are under the care of persons of steady and decided\r\ngovernment, know, that whenever a thing is forbidden or denied, it is\r\nout of the reach of hope; the desire, therefore, soon ceases, and they\r\nturn to other objects. But the children of undecided, or of\r\nover-indulgent parents, never enjoy this preserving aid. When a thing is\r\ndenied, they never know but either coaxing may win it, or disobedience\r\nsecure it without any penalty, and so they are kept in that state of\r\nhope and anxiety, which produces irritation, and tempts to\r\ninsubordination. The children of very indulgent parents, and of those\r\nwho are undecided and unsteady in government, are very apt to become\r\nfretful, irritable, and fractious.\r\n\r\nAnother class of persons, in shunning this evil, go to the other\r\nextreme, and are very strict and pertinacious, in regard to every\r\nrequisition. With them, fault-finding and penalties abound, until the\r\nchildren are either hardened into indifference of feeling, and\r\nobtuseness of conscience, or else become excessively irritable, or\r\nmisanthropic.\r\n\r\nIt demands great wisdom, patience, and self-control, to escape these two\r\nextremes. In aiming at this, there are parents, who have found the\r\nfollowing maxims of very great value. First, Avoid, as much as possible,\r\nthe multiplication of rules and absolute commands. Instead of this, take\r\nthe attitude of advisers. \"My child, this is improper, I wish you would\r\nremember not to do it.\" This mode of address answers for all the little\r\nacts of heedlessness, awkwardness, or ill-manners, so frequently\r\noccurring, with children. There are cases, when direct and distinct\r\ncommands are needful; and, in such cases, a penalty for disobedience\r\nshould be as steady and sure as the laws of Nature. Where such\r\nsteadiness, and certainty of penalty, attend disobedience, children no\r\nmore think of disobeying, than they do of putting their fingers in a\r\nburning candle.\r\n\r\nThe next maxim, is, Govern by rewards, more than by penalties. Such\r\nfaults as wilful disobedience, lying, dishonesty, and indecent or\r\nprofane language, should be punished with severe penalties, after a\r\nchild has been fully instructed in the evil of such practices. But all\r\nthe constantly-recurring faults of the nursery, such as ill-humor,\r\nquarrelling, carelessness, and ill-manners, may, in a great many cases,\r\nbe regulated by gentle and kind remonstrances, and by the offer of some\r\nreward for persevering efforts to form a good habit. It is very\r\ninjurious and degrading to any mind, to be kept under the constant fear\r\nof penalties. _Love_ and _hope_ are the principles that should be mainly\r\nrelied on, in forming the habits of childhood.\r\n\r\nAnother maxim, and perhaps the most difficult, is, Do not govern by the\r\naid of severe and angry tones. A single example will be given to\r\nillustrate this maxim. A child is disposed to talk and amuse itself, at\r\ntable. The mother requests it to be silent, except when needing to ask\r\nfor food, or when spoken to by its older friends. It constantly forgets.\r\nThe mother, instead of rebuking, in an impatient tone, says, \"My child,\r\nyou must remember not to talk. I will remind you of it four times more,\r\nand after that, whenever you forget, you must leave the table, and wait\r\ntill we are done.\" If the mother is steady in her government, it is not\r\nprobable that she will have to apply this slight penalty more than once\r\nor twice. This method is far more effectual, than the use of sharp and\r\nsevere tones, to secure attention and recollection, and often answers\r\nthe purpose, as well as offering some reward.\r\n\r\nThe writer has been in some families, where the most efficient and\r\nsteady government has been sustained, without the use of a cross or\r\nangry tone; and in others, where a far less efficient discipline was\r\nkept up, by frequent severe rebukes and angry remonstrances. In the\r\nfirst case, the children followed the example set them, and seldom used\r\nsevere tones to each other; in the latter, the method employed by the\r\nparents, was imitated by the children; and cross words and angry tones\r\nresounded from morning till night, in every portion of the household.\r\n\r\nAnother important maxim, is, Try to keep children in a happy state of\r\nmind. Every one knows, by experience, that it is easier to do right, and\r\nsubmit to rule, when cheerful and happy, than when irritated. This is\r\npeculiarly true of children; and a wise mother, when she finds her child\r\nfretful and impatient, and thus constantly doing wrong, will often\r\nremedy the whole difficulty, by telling some amusing story, or by\r\ngetting the child engaged in some amusing sport. This strongly shows the\r\nimportance of learning to govern children without the employment of\r\nangry tones, which always produce irritation.\r\n\r\nChildren of active, heedless temperament, or those who are odd, awkward,\r\nor unsuitable, in their remarks and deportment, are often essentially\r\ninjured, by a want of patience and self-control in those who govern\r\nthem. Such children, often possess a morbid sensibility, which they\r\nstrive to conceal, or a desire of love and approbation, which preys like\r\na famine on the soul. And yet, they become objects of ridicule and\r\nrebuke, to almost every member of the family, until their sensibilities\r\nare tortured into obtuseness or misanthropy. Such children, above all\r\nothers, need tenderness and sympathy. A thousand instances of mistake or\r\nforgetfulness should be passed over, in silence, while opportunities for\r\ncommendation and encouragement should be diligently sought.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the formation of habits of self-denial, in childhood, it is\r\nastonishing to see how parents, who are very sensible, often seem to\r\nregard this matter. Instead of inuring their children to this duty, in\r\nearly life, so that by habit it may be made easy in after-days, they\r\nseem to be studiously seeking to cut them off, from every chance to\r\nsecure such a preparation. Every wish of the child is studiously\r\ngratified; and, where a necessity exists, of crossing its wishes, some\r\ncompensating pleasure is offered, in return. Such parents, often\r\nmaintain that nothing shall be put on their table, which their children\r\nmay not join them in eating. But where, so easily and surely as at the\r\ndaily meal, can that habit of self-denial be formed, which is so needful\r\nin governing the appetites, and which children must acquire, or be\r\nruined? The food which is proper for grown persons, is often unsuitable\r\nfor children; and this is a sufficient reason for accustoming them to\r\nsee others partake of delicacies, which they must not share. Requiring\r\nchildren to wait till others are helped, and to refrain from\r\nconversation at table, except when addressed by their elders, is another\r\nmode of forming habits of self-denial and self-control. Requiring them\r\nto help others, first, and to offer the best to others, has a similar\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIn forming the moral habits of children, it is wise to take into account\r\nthe peculiar temptations to which they are to be exposed. The people of\r\nthis Nation are eminently a trafficking people; and the present standard\r\nof honesty, as to trade and debts, is very low, and every year seems\r\nsinking still lower. It is, therefore, pre-eminently important, that\r\nchildren should be trained to strict _honesty_, both in word and deed.\r\nIt is not merely teaching children to avoid absolute lying, which is\r\nneeded. _All kinds of deceit_ should be guarded against; and all kinds\r\nof little dishonest practices be strenuously opposed. A child should be\r\nbrought up with the determined principle, never to _run in debt_, but to\r\nbe content to live in an humbler way, in order to secure that true\r\nindependence, which should be the noblest distinction of an American\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nThere is no more important duty, devolving upon a mother, than the\r\ncultivation of habits of modesty and propriety in young children. All\r\nindecorous words or deportment, should be carefully restrained; and\r\ndelicacy and reserve studiously cherished. It is a common notion, that\r\nit is important to secure these virtues to one sex, more than to the\r\nother; and, by a strange inconsistency, the sex most exposed to danger,\r\nis the one selected as least needing care. But a wise mother will be\r\nespecially careful, that her sons are trained to modesty and purity of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nBut few mothers are sufficiently aware of the dreadful penalties which\r\noften result from indulged impurity of thought. If children, in _future_\r\nlife, can be preserved from licentious associates, it is supposed that\r\ntheir safety is secured. But the records of our insane retreats, and the\r\npages of medical writers, teach, that even in solitude, and without\r\nbeing aware of the sin or the danger, children may inflict evils on\r\nthemselves, which not unfrequently terminate in disease, delirium, and\r\ndeath. Every mother and every teacher, therefore, carefully avoiding all\r\nexplanation of the mystery, should teach the young, that the indulgence\r\nof impure thoughts and actions, is visited by the most awful and\r\nterrific penalties. Disclosing the details of vice, in order to awaken\r\ndread of its penalties, is a most dangerous experiment, and often leads\r\nto the very evils feared. The attempts made, in late years, to guard\r\nchildren from future dangers, by circulating papers, and books of\r\nwarning and information, have led to such frightful results, that it is\r\nhoped the experiment will never again be pursued. The safest course, is,\r\nto cultivate habits of modesty and delicacy, and to teach, that all\r\nimpure thoughts, words, and actions, are forbidden by God, and are often\r\nvisited by the most dreadful punishment. At the same time, it is\r\nimportant for mothers to protect the young mind from false notions of\r\ndelicacy. It should be shown, that whatever is necessary, to save from\r\nsuffering or danger, must be met, without shame or aversion; and that\r\nall, which God has instituted, is wise, and right, and pure.\r\n\r\nIt is in reference to these dangers, that mothers and teachers should\r\ncarefully guard the young from those highly-wrought fictions, which lead\r\nthe imagination astray; and especially from that class of licentious\r\nworks, made interesting by genius and taste, which have flooded this\r\nCountry, and which are often found on the parlor table, even of moral\r\nand Christian people. Of this class, the writings of Bulwer stand\r\nconspicuous. The only difference, between some of his works and the\r\nobscene prints, for vending which men suffer the penalties of the law,\r\nis, that the last are so gross, as to revolt the taste and startle the\r\nmind to resistance, while Bulwer presents the same ideas, so clothed in\r\nthe fascinations of taste and genius, as most insidiously to seduce the\r\nunwary. It seems to be the chief aim of this licentious writer, to make\r\nthieves, murderers, and adulterers, appear beautiful, refined, and\r\ninteresting. It is time that all virtuous persons in the community\r\nshould rise in indignation, not only against the writers, but the\r\nvenders of such poison.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[O] See his 'Physiology of Digestion considered with relation to the\r\nPrinciples of Dietetics,' issued by the Publishers of this work.\r\n\r\n[P] The writer is not an advocate for _total_ abstinence from animal\r\nfood. She coincides with the best authorities, in thinking that adults\r\neat too much; that children, while growing, should eat very little, and\r\nquite young children, none at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF THE SICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery woman who has the care of young children, or of a large family, is\r\nfrequently called upon, to advise what shall be done, for some one who\r\nis indisposed; and often, in circumstances where she must trust solely\r\nto her own judgement. In such cases, some err, by neglecting to do any\r\nthing at all, till the patient is quite sick; but a still greater number\r\nerr, from excessive and injurious dosing.\r\n\r\nThe two great causes of the ordinary slight attacks of illness, in a\r\nfamily, are, sudden chills, which close the pores of the skin, and thus\r\naffect the throat, lungs, or bowels; and the excessive or improper use\r\nof food. In most cases, of illness from the first cause, bathing the\r\nfeet, and some aperient drink to induce perspiration, are suitable\r\nremedies. A slight cathartic, also, is often serviceable. In case of\r\nillness from improper food, or excess in eating, _fasting_, for one or\r\ntwo meals, to give the system time and chance to relieve itself, is the\r\nsafest remedy. Sometimes, a gentle cathartic may be needful; but it is\r\nbest first to try fasting.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a discourse of Dr. Burne, before the London\r\nMedical Society, contains important information. \"In civilized life, the\r\ncauses, which are most generally and continually operating in the\r\nproduction of diseases, are, affections of the mind, improper diet, and\r\nretention of the intestinal excretions. The undue retention of\r\nexcrementitious matter, allows of the absorption of its more liquid\r\nparts, which is a cause of great impurity to the blood, and the\r\nexcretions, thus rendered hard and knotty, act more or less as\r\nextraneous substances, and, by their irritation, produce a determination\r\nof blood to the intestines and to the neighboring viscera, which\r\nultimately ends in inflammation. It also has a great effect on the whole\r\nsystem; causes a determination of blood to the head, which oppresses the\r\nbrain and dejects the mind; deranges the functions of the stomach;\r\ncauses flatulency; and produces a general state of discomfort.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Combe remarks, on this subject, \"In the natural and healthy state,\r\nunder a proper system of diet, and with sufficient exercise, the bowels\r\nare relieved regularly, once every day.\" _Habit_ \"is powerful in\r\nmodifying the result, and in sustaining healthy action when once fairly\r\nestablished. Hence the obvious advantage of observing as much\r\nregularity, in relieving the system, as in taking our meals.\" It is\r\noften the case that soliciting Nature at a regular period, once a day,\r\nwill remedy constipation, without medicine, and induce a regular and\r\nhealthy state of the bowels. \"When, however, as most frequently\r\nhappens, the constipation arises from the absence of all assistance from\r\nthe abdominal and respiratory muscles, the first step to be taken, is,\r\nagain to solicit their aid; first, by removing all impediments to free\r\nrespiration, such as stays, waistbands and belts; secondly, by resorting\r\nto such active exercises, as shall call the muscles into full and\r\nregular action; and, lastly, by proportioning the quantity of food to\r\nthe wants of the system, and the condition of the digestive organs. If\r\nwe employ these means, systematically and perseveringly, we shall rarely\r\nfail in at last restoring the healthy action of the bowels, with little\r\naid from medicine. But if we neglect these modes, we may go on, for\r\nyears, adding pill to pill, and dose to dose, without ever attaining the\r\nend at which we aim.\" There is no point, in which a woman needs more\r\nknowledge and discretion, than in administering remedies for what seem\r\nslight attacks, which are not supposed to require the attention of a\r\nphysician. It is little realized, that purgative drugs are unnatural\r\nmodes of stimulating the internal organs, tending to exhaust them of\r\ntheir secretions, and to debilitate and disturb the animal economy. For\r\nthis reason, they should be used as little as possible; and fasting, and\r\nperspiration, and the other methods pointed out, should always be first\r\nresorted to. When medicine must be given, it should be borne in mind,\r\nthat there are various classes of purgatives, which produce very diverse\r\neffects. Some, like salts, operate to thin the blood, and reduce the\r\nsystem; others are stimulating; and others have a peculiar operation on\r\ncertain organs. Of course, great discrimination and knowledge is needed,\r\nin order to select the kind, which is suitable to the particular\r\ndisease, or to the particular constitution of the invalid. This shows\r\nthe folly of using the many kinds of pills, and other quack medicines,\r\nwhere no knowledge can be had of their composition. Pills which are good\r\nfor one kind of disease, might operate as poison in another state of the\r\nsystem. It is wise to keep always on hand some simple cathartic, for\r\nfamily use, in slight attacks; and always to resort to medical advice,\r\nwhenever powerful remedies seem to be demanded.[Q] It is very common, in\r\ncases of colds which affect the lungs or throat, to continue to try one\r\ndose after another, for relief. It will be well to bear in mind, at such\r\ntimes, that all which goes into the stomach, must be first absorbed into\r\nthe blood, before it can reach the diseased part; and that there is some\r\ndanger of injuring the stomach, or other parts of the system, by such a\r\nvariety of doses, many of which, it is probable, will be directly\r\ncontradictory in their nature, and thus neutralize any supposed benefit\r\nthey might separately impart.\r\n\r\nIt is very unwise, to tempt the appetite of a person who is indisposed.\r\nThe cessation of appetite is the warning of Nature, that the system is\r\nin such a state, that food cannot be digested.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions may be found useful, in regard to nursing the\r\nsick. As nothing contributes more to the restoration of health, than\r\npure air, it should be a primary object, to keep a sick-room well\r\nventilated. At least twice in the twenty-four hours, the patient should\r\nbe well covered, and fresh air freely admitted from out of doors. After\r\nthis, if need be, the room should be restored to a proper temperature,\r\nby the aid of a fire. Bedding and clothing should also be well aired,\r\nand frequently changed; as the exhalations from the body, in sickness,\r\nare peculiarly deleterious. Frequent ablutions, of the whole body, if\r\npossible, are very useful; and for these, warm water may be employed.\r\n\r\nThe following, are useful directions for dressing a blister. Spread\r\nthinly, on a linen cloth, an ointment, composed of one third of beeswax\r\nto two thirds of tallow; lay this upon a linen cloth, folded many times.\r\nWith a sharp pair of scissors, make an aperture in the lower part of the\r\nbag of water, with a little hole, above, to give it vent. Break the\r\nraised skin as little as possible. Lay on the cloth, spread as directed.\r\nThe blister, at first, should be dressed as often as three times in a\r\nday, and the dressing renewed each time.\r\n\r\nA sick-room should always be kept very neat, and in perfect order; and\r\nall haste, noise, and bustle, should be avoided. In order to secure\r\nneatness, order, and quiet, in case of long illness, the following\r\narrangements should be made. Keep a large box for fuel, which will need\r\nto be filled only twice in twenty-four hours. Provide, also, and keep in\r\nthe room, or an adjacent closet, a small teakettle, a saucepan, a pail\r\nof water, for drinks and ablutions, a pitcher, a covered porringer, two\r\npint bowls, two tumblers, two cups and saucers, two wine glasses, two\r\nlarge and two small spoons; also, a dish in which to wash these\r\narticles; a good supply of towels, and a broom. Keep a slop-bucket, near\r\nby, to receive the wash of the room. Procuring all these articles at\r\nonce, will save much noise and confusion.\r\n\r\nWhenever medicine or food is given, spread a clean towel over the person\r\nor bedclothing, and get a clean handkerchief, as nothing is more\r\nannoying to a weak stomach, than the stickiness and soiling produced by\r\nmedicine and food. Keep the fireplace neat, and always wash all\r\narticles, and put them in order, as soon as they are out of use.\r\n\r\nA sick person has nothing to do, but look about the room; and when every\r\nthing is neat and in order, a feeling of comfort is induced, while\r\ndisorder, filth, and neglect, are constant objects of annoyance, which,\r\nif not complained of, are yet felt.\r\n\r\nAlways prepare food for the sick, in the neatest and most careful\r\nmanner. It is in sickness, that the senses of smell and taste are most\r\nsusceptible of annoyance; and often, little mistakes or negligences, in\r\npreparing food, will take away all appetite.\r\n\r\nFood for the sick, should be cooked on coals, that no smoke may have\r\naccess to it; and great care must be taken, to prevent any adherence to\r\nthe bottom, as this always gives a disagreeable taste.\r\n\r\nKeeping clean handkerchiefs and towels at hand, cooling the pillows,\r\nsponging the hands with water, swabbing the mouth with a clean linen\r\nrag, on the end of a stick, are modes of increasing the comfort of the\r\nsick. Always throw a shawl over a sick person, when raised up.\r\n\r\nBe careful to understand a physician's directions, and _to obey them\r\nimplicitly_. If it be supposed that any other person knows better about\r\nthe case, than the physician, dismiss the physician, and employ that\r\nperson in his stead.\r\n\r\nIn nursing the sick, always speak gently and cheeringly; and, while you\r\nexpress sympathy for their pain and trials, stimulate them to bear all\r\nwith fortitude, and with resignation to Him who has appointed the trial.\r\nOffer to read the Bible, or other devotional books, whenever it is\r\nsuitable, and will not be deemed obtrusive.\r\n\r\nIt is always best to consult the physician, as to where medicines shall\r\nbe purchased, and to show the articles to him before using them, as\r\ngreat impositions are practised in selling old, useless, and adulterated\r\ndrugs. Always put labels on vials of medicine, and keep them out of the\r\nreach of children.\r\n\r\nBe careful to label all powders, and particularly all _white powders_;\r\nas many poisonous medicines, in this form, are easily mistaken for\r\nothers which are harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Q] The following electuary, by a distinguished physician, is used by\r\nmany friends of the writer, as a standing resort, in cases of\r\nconstipation, or where a gentle cathartic is needed. One recommendation\r\nof it, is, that children always love it, and eat the pills as \"good\r\nplums.\"\r\n\r\nTwo ounces of powdered Senna; one ounce of Cream of Tartar; one ounce of\r\nSulphur; mixed with sufficient Confection of Senna, to form an\r\nelectuary. Make this into pills, of the size of peas, and give a young\r\nchild two or three, as the case may be. Taking three pills, every night,\r\nwill generally relieve constipation in an adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nON ACCIDENTS AND ANTIDOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen serious accidents occur, medical aid should be immediately\r\nprocured. Till that can be done, the following directions may be useful.\r\n\r\nWhen a child has any thing in its throat, first try, with the finger, to\r\nget the article up. If this cannot be done, push it down into the\r\nstomach, with a smooth elastic stick. If the article be a pin, sharp\r\nbone, glass, or other cutting substance, give an emetic which will\r\nimmediately operate.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a common cut, bind the lips of the wound together, with a\r\nrag, and put nothing else on. If the cut be large, and so situated that\r\nrags will not bind it together, use sticking plaster, cut in strips and\r\nlaid obliquely across the cut. Sometimes it is needful to take a stitch,\r\nwith a needle and thread, on each lip of the wound, and draw the two\r\nsides together.\r\n\r\nIf an artery be cut, it must be immediately tied up, or the person will\r\nbleed to death. The blood from an artery is of a bright red color, and\r\nspirts out, in regular jets, at each beat of the heart. Take up the\r\nbleeding end of the artery, and hold it, or tie it up, till a surgeon\r\ncomes. When the artery cannot be found, and in all cases of bad cuts on\r\nany of the limbs, apply compression; when it can be done, tie a very\r\ntight bandage above the wound, if it be below the heart, and _below_ if\r\nthe wound be above the heart. Put a stick into the band, and twist it as\r\ntight as can be borne, till surgical aid be obtained.\r\n\r\nBathe bad bruises in hot water, or hot spirits, or a decoction of bitter\r\nherbs. _Entire rest_, is the remedy for sprains. Bathing in warm water,\r\nor warm whiskey is very useful. A sprained leg should be kept in a\r\nhorizontal position, on a bed or sofa.\r\n\r\nWhen a leg is broken, tie it to the other leg, to keep it still; and,\r\nif possible, get a surgeon, before the limb swells. Bind a broken arm to\r\na piece of shingle, and keep it still, till it is set.\r\n\r\nIn case of a blow on the head, or a fall, causing insensibility, use a\r\nmustard paste on the back of the neck and pit of the stomach, and rub\r\nthe body with spirits. After the circulation is restored, bleeding is\r\noften necessary; but it is very dangerous to attempt it before.\r\n\r\nIn cases of bad burns, where the skin is taken off, the great aim should\r\nbe, _to keep the injured part from the air_. For this purpose, sprinkle\r\non flour, or apply a liniment, made of linseed oil and lime-water, in\r\nequal quantities. Sweet-oil, on cotton, is good, and with laudanum,\r\nalleviates pain: but many skins cannot bear the application of raw\r\ncotton, which is sometimes very good. When a dressing is put on, do not\r\nremove it, as it will be sure to protract the cure, by admitting the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIn case of drowning, lay the person in a warm bed, or on blankets, on\r\nthe right side, with the head raised, and a little inclined forward.\r\nClear the mouth with the fingers, and cautiously apply hartshorn to the\r\nnose. Raise the heat of the body, by bottles of warm water, applied to\r\nthe pit of the stomach, armpits, groins, and soles of the feet. Apply\r\nfriction to the whole body, with warm hands and cloths dipped in warm\r\nspirits of camphor. Endeavor to produce the natural action of the lungs,\r\nby introducing the nose of a bellows into one nostril and closing the\r\nother, at the same time pressing on the throat, to close the gullet.\r\nWhen the lungs are thus inflated, press gently on the breast and belly,\r\nand continue the process, for a long time. Cases have been known, where\r\nefforts have been protracted eight or ten hours, without effect, and\r\nthen have proved successful. Rolling the body on a barrel, suspending it\r\nby the heels, giving injections of tobacco, and many other practices,\r\nwhich have been common, are highly injurious. After signs of life\r\nappear, give small quantities of wine, or spirits and water.\r\n\r\nIn cases of poisoning, from _corrosive sublimate_, beat up the whites\r\nof twelve eggs, mix them in two quarts of water, and give a tumbler full\r\nevery three minutes, till vomiting is produced. This is the surest\r\nremedy. When this is not at hand, fill the stomach, in like manner, with\r\nany mucilaginous substance, such as gum and water, flaxseed, or\r\nslippery-elm-bark tea. Flour and water, or sugar and water, in great\r\nquantities, are next best; and if none of these be at hand, give copious\r\ndraughts of water alone.\r\n\r\nIn case of poisoning from _arsenic_, _cobalt_, or any such mineral,\r\nadminister, as soon as possible, large quantities of lime-water and\r\nsugared-water, of warm, or even of cold water, or of flaxseed tea, or\r\nsome other mucilaginous drink, to distend the stomach and produce\r\nimmediate vomiting, and thereby eject the poison.\r\n\r\nIf opium, or any of its preparations, has been taken, in dangerous\r\nquantities, induce vomiting, without a moment's unnecessary delay, by\r\ngiving, immediately, in _a small quantity_ of water, ten grains of\r\nipecac, and ten grains of sulphate of zinc, (white vitriol, which is the\r\nmost prompt emetic known,) and repeat the dose every fifteen minutes,\r\ntill the stomach is entirely emptied. Where white vitriol is not at\r\nhand, substitute three or four grains of blue vitriol, (sulphate of\r\ncopper.) When the stomach is emptied, but not before, give, every ten\r\nminutes, alternately, a cup of acid drink, and a cup of very strong\r\ncoffee, made by pouring a pint of boiling water on a quarter of a pound\r\nof ground burnt coffee, and letting it stand ten minutes, and then\r\nstraining it. Continue these drinks, till the danger is over. Dash cold\r\nwater on the head, apply friction to the body, and keep the person in\r\nconstant motion, to prevent sleep.\r\n\r\nIf any kind of acid be taken, in poisonous quantities, give strong\r\npearlash-water. If ley, or pearlash, or any alkali be taken, give\r\nsweet-oil; or, if this be wanting, lamp-oil; or, if neither be at hand,\r\ngive vinegar, freely.\r\n\r\nIn case of stupefaction, from the fumes of charcoal, or from entering a\r\nwell, limekiln, or coal mine, expose the person to cold air, lying on\r\nhis back, dash cold water on the head and breast, and rub the body with\r\nspirits of camphor, vinegar, or Cologne water. Apply mustard paste to\r\nthe pit of the stomach, and use friction on the hands, feet, and whole\r\nlength of the back bone. Give some acid drink, and, when the person\r\nrevives, place him in a warm bed, in fresh air. Be prompt and\r\npersevering.\r\n\r\nIn case of bleeding at the lungs, or stomach, or throat, give a\r\nteaspoonful of dry salt, and repeat it often. For bleeding at the nose,\r\npour cold water on the back of the neck, keeping the head elevated.\r\n\r\nIf a person be struck with lightning, throw pailfuls of cold water on\r\nthe head and body, and apply mustard poultices on the stomach, with\r\nfriction of the whole body, and inflation of the lungs. When no other\r\nemetic can be found, pounded mustard seed, taken a teaspoonful at a\r\ntime, will answer. The ground mustard is not so effectual, but will do.\r\n\r\nIn case of fire, wrap a woollen blanket about you, to protect from the\r\nfire. If the staircases are on fire, tie the corners of the sheets\r\ntogether, very firmly, fasten one end to the bedstead, draw it to the\r\nwindow, and let yourself down. Never read in bed, lest you fall asleep,\r\nand the bed be set on fire. If your clothes get on fire, never run, but\r\nlie down, and roll about till you can reach a bed or carpet to wrap\r\nyourself in, and thus put out the fire. Keep young children in woollen\r\ndresses, to save them from the risk of fire.\r\n\r\nIn thunderstorms, shut the doors and windows. The safest part of a room,\r\nis its centre; and where there is a featherbed in the apartment, that\r\nwill be found the most secure resting-place.\r\n\r\nA lightning rod, if it be well pointed, and run deep into the earth, is\r\na certain protection to a circle around it, whose diameter equals the\r\nheight of the rod above the highest chimney. But it protects _no\r\nfurther_ than this extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nON DOMESTIC AMUSEMENTS AND SOCIAL DUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever the laws of body and mind are properly understood, it will be\r\nallowed, that every person needs some kind of recreation; and that, by\r\nseeking it, the body is strengthened, the mind is invigorated, and all\r\nour duties are more cheerfully and successfully performed.\r\n\r\nChildren, whose bodies are rapidly growing, and whose nervous system is\r\ntender and excitable, need much more amusement, than persons of mature\r\nage. Persons, also, who are oppressed with great responsibilities and\r\nduties, or who are taxed by great intellectual or moral excitement, need\r\nrecreations which secure physical exercise, and draw off the mind from\r\nabsorbing interests. Unfortunately, such persons are those who least\r\nresort to amusements, while the idle, gay, and thoughtless, seek those\r\nwhich are needless, and for which useful occupation would be a most\r\nbeneficial substitute.\r\n\r\nAs the only legitimate object of amusements, is, to prepare mind and\r\nbody for the proper discharge of duty, any protracting of such as\r\ninterfere with regular employments, or induce excessive fatigue, or\r\nweary the mind, or invade the proper hours for repose, must be sinful.\r\n\r\nIn deciding what should be selected, and what avoided, the following\r\nrules are binding. In the first place, no amusements, which inflict\r\nneedless pain, should ever be allowed. All tricks which cause fright, or\r\nvexation, and all sports, which involve suffering to animals, should be\r\nutterly forbidden. Hunting and fishing, for mere sport, can never be\r\njustified. If a man can convince his children, that he follows these\r\npursuits to gain food or health, and not for amusement, his example may\r\nnot be very injurious. But, when children see grown persons kill and\r\nfrighten animals, for sport, habits of cruelty, rather than feelings of\r\ntenderness and benevolence, are induced.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, we should seek no recreations, which endanger life,\r\nor interfere with important duties. As the only legitimate object of\r\namusements, is to promote health, and prepare for more serious duties,\r\nselecting those which have a directly opposite tendency, cannot be\r\njustified. Of course, if a person feel that the previous day's\r\ndiversions have shortened the hours of needful repose, or induced a\r\nlassitude of mind or body, instead of invigorating them, it is certain\r\nthat an evil has been done, which should never be repeated.\r\n\r\nA third rule, is, to avoid those amusements, which experience has shown\r\nto be so exciting, and connected with so many temptations, as to be\r\npernicious in tendency, both to the individual and to the community. It\r\nis on this ground, that horse-racing and circus-riding are excluded. Not\r\nbecause there is any thing positively wrong, in having men and horses\r\nrun, and perform feats of agility, or in persons looking on for the\r\ndiversion; but because experience has shown so many evils connected with\r\nthese recreations, that they should be relinquished. So with theatres.\r\nThe enacting of characters, and the amusement thus afforded, in itself\r\nmay be harmless; and possibly, in certain cases, might be useful: but\r\nexperience has shown so many evils to result from this source, that it\r\nis deemed wrong to patronize it. So, also, with those exciting games of\r\nchance, which are employed in gambling.\r\n\r\nUnder the same head, comes _dancing_, in the estimation of the great\r\nmajority of the religious world. Still, there are many intelligent,\r\nexcellent, and conscientious persons, who hold a contrary opinion. Such\r\nmaintain, that it is an innocent and healthful amusement, tending to\r\npromote ease of manners, cheerfulness, social affection, and health of\r\nmind and body; that evils are involved only in its excess; that, like\r\nfood, study, or religious excitement, it is only wrong, when not\r\nproperly regulated; and that, if serious and intelligent people would\r\nstrive to regulate, rather than banish, this amusement, much more good\r\nwould be secured.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, it is objected, not that dancing is a sin, in itself\r\nconsidered, for it was once a part of sacred worship; not that it would\r\nbe objectionable, if it were properly regulated; not that it does not\r\ntend, when used in a proper manner, to health of body and mind, to grace\r\nof manners, and to social enjoyment: all these things are conceded. But\r\nit is objected to, on the same ground as horse-racing, card-playing, and\r\ntheatrical entertainments; that we are to look at amusements as they\r\n_are_, and not as they _might_ be. Horseraces might be so managed, as\r\nnot to involve cruelty, gambling, drunkenness, and every other vice. And\r\nso might theatres and cards. And if serious and intelligent persons,\r\nundertook to patronize these, in order to regulate them, perhaps they\r\nwould be somewhat raised from the depths, to which they are now sunk.\r\nBut such persons, know, that, with the weak sense of moral obligation\r\nexisting in the mass of society, and the imperfect ideas mankind have of\r\nthe proper use of amusements, and the little self-control, which men, or\r\nwomen, or children, practise, these will not, in fact, be\r\nthus-regulated. And they believe dancing to be liable to the same\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nAs this recreation is actually conducted, it does not tend to produce\r\nhealth of body or mind, but directly the contrary. If young and old went\r\nout to dance together, in the open air, as the French peasants do, it\r\nwould be a very different sort of amusement, from that which is\r\nwitnessed, in a room, furnished with many lights, and filled with\r\nguests, both expending the healthful part of the atmosphere, where the\r\nyoung collect, in their tightest dresses, to protract, for several\r\nhours, a kind of physical exertion, which is not habitual to them.\r\nDuring this process, the blood is made to circulate more swiftly than\r\nordinary, in circumstances where it is less perfectly oxygenized than\r\nhealth requires; the pores of the skin are excited by heat and\r\nexercise; the stomach is loaded with indigestible articles, and the\r\nquiet, needful to digestion, withheld; the diversion is protracted\r\nbeyond the usual hour for repose; and then, when the skin is made the\r\nmost highly susceptible to damps and miasms, the company pass from a\r\nwarm room to the cold night-air. It is probable, that no single\r\namusement can be pointed out, combining so many injurious particulars,\r\nas this, which is so often defended as a healthful one. Even if parents,\r\nwho train their children to dance, can keep them from public balls,\r\n(which is seldom the case,) dancing in private parlors is subject to\r\nnearly all the same mischievous influences.\r\n\r\nAs to the claim of social benefits,--when a dancing-party occupies the\r\nparlors, and the music begins, most of the conversation ceases; while\r\nthe young prepare themselves for future sickness, and the old look\r\nsmilingly on.\r\n\r\nAs to the claim for ease and grace of manners,--all that is gained, by\r\nthis practice, can be better secured, by Calisthenics, which, in all its\r\nparts, embraces a much more perfect system, both of healthful exercise,\r\ngraceful movement, and pleasing carriage.\r\n\r\nThe writer was once inclined to the common opinion, that dancing was\r\nharmless, and might be properly regulated; and she allowed a fair trial\r\nto be made, under her auspices, by its advocates. The result was, a full\r\nconviction, that it secured no good effect, which could not be better\r\ngained another way; that it involved the most pernicious evils to\r\nhealth, character, and happiness; and that those parents were wise, who\r\nbrought up their children with the full understanding that they were\r\nneither to learn nor to practise the art. In the fifteen years, during\r\nwhich she has had the care of young ladies, she has never known any\r\ncase, where learning this art, and following the amusement, did not have\r\na bad effect, either on the habits, the intellect, the feelings, or the\r\nhealth. Those young ladies, who are brought up with less exciting\r\nrecreations, are uniformly likely to be the most contented and most\r\nuseful, while those, who enter the path to which this diversion leads,\r\nacquire a relish and desire for high excitement, which make the more\r\nsteady and quiet pursuits and enjoyments of home, comparatively\r\ntasteless. This, the writer believes to be generally the case, though\r\nnot invariably so; for there are exceptions to all general rules.\r\n\r\nIn reference to these exciting amusements, so liable to danger and\r\nexcess, parents are bound to regard the principle, which is involved in\r\nthe petition, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" Would it not be\r\ninconsistent, to teach this prayer, to the lisping tongue of childhood,\r\nand then send it to the dancing-master, to acquire a love for a\r\ndiversion, which leads to constant temptations that so few find strength\r\nto resist?\r\n\r\nIt is encouraging, to those who take this view of the subject, to find\r\nhow fast the most serious and intelligent portion of the community is\r\ncoming to a similar result. Twenty-five years ago, dancing was\r\nuniversally practised by the young, as a matter of course, in every part\r\nof the Nation. Now, in those parts of the Country, where religion and\r\nintelligence are most extensively diffused, it is almost impossible to\r\nget up a ball, among the more refined classes of the community. The\r\namusement is fast leaving this rank in society, to remain as a resource\r\nfor those, whose grade of intelligence and refinement does not relish\r\nmore elevated recreations. Still, as there is great diversity of\r\nopinion, among persons of equal worth and intelligence, a spirit of\r\ncandor and courtesy should be practised, on both sides. The sneer at\r\nbigotry and narrowness of views, on one side, and the uncharitable\r\nimplication of want of piety, or sense, on the other, are equally\r\nillbred and unchristian. Truth, on this subject, is best promoted, not\r\nby ill-natured crimination and rebuke, but by calm reason, generous\r\ncandor, forbearance, and kindness.\r\n\r\nThere is another species of amusement, which a large portion of the\r\nreligious world have been accustomed to put under the same condemnation\r\nas the preceding. This is novel-reading. The confusion and difference of\r\nopinion on this subject, have arisen from a want of clear and definite\r\ndistinctions. Now, as it is impossible to define what are novels and\r\nwhat are not, so as to include one class of fictitious writings and\r\nexclude every other, it is impossible to lay down any rule respecting\r\nthem. The discussion, in fact, turns on the use of those works of\r\nimagination, which belong to the class of narratives. That this species\r\nof reading, is not only lawful, but necessary and useful, is settled by\r\nDivine examples, in the parables and allegories of Scripture. Of course,\r\nthe question must be, what kind of fabulous writings must be avoided,\r\nand what allowed. In deciding this, no specific rules can be given; but\r\nit must be a matter to be regulated by the nature and circumstances of\r\neach case. No works of fiction, which tend to throw the allurements of\r\ntaste and genius around vice and crime, should ever be tolerated; and\r\nall that tend to give false views of life and duty, should also be\r\nbanished. Of those, which are written for mere amusement, presenting\r\nscenes and events that are interesting and exciting, and having no bad\r\nmoral influence, much must depend on character and circumstances. Some\r\nminds are torpid and phlegmatic, and need to have the imagination\r\nstimulated: such would be benefitted by this kind of reading. Others\r\nhave quick and active imaginations, and would be as much injured. Some\r\npersons are often so engaged in absorbing interests, that any thing\r\ninnocent, which will for a short time draw off the mind, is of the\r\nnature of a medicine; and, in such cases, this kind of reading is\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nThere is need, also, that some men should keep a supervision of the\r\ncurrent literature of the day, as guardians, to warn others of danger.\r\nFor this purpose, it is more suitable for _editors_, _clergymen_, and\r\n_teachers_, to read indiscriminately, than for any other class of\r\npersons; for they are the guardians of the public weal, in matters of\r\nliterature, and should be prepared to advise parents and young persons\r\nof the evils in one direction and the good in another. In doing this,\r\nhowever, they are bound to go on the same principles which regulate\r\nphysicians, when they visit infected districts,--using every precaution\r\nto prevent injury to themselves; having as little to do with pernicious\r\nexposures, as a benevolent regard to others will allow; and faithfully\r\nemploying all the knowledge and opportunities, thus gained, for warning\r\nand preserving others. There is much danger, in taking this course, that\r\nmen will seek the excitement of the imagination, for the mere pleasure\r\nit affords, under the plea of preparing to serve the public, when this\r\nis neither the aim nor the result.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of such works, by the young, as a general rule,\r\nthey ought not to be allowed to any, except those of a dull and\r\nphlegmatic temperament, until the solid parts of education are secured,\r\nand a taste for more elevated reading is acquired. If these stimulating\r\ncondiments in literature be freely used, in youth, all relish for more\r\nsolid reading, will, in a majority of cases, be destroyed. If parents\r\nsucceed in securing habits of cheerful and implicit obedience, it will\r\nbe very easy to regulate this matter, by prohibiting the reading of any\r\nstory-book, until the consent of the parent is obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is not unfrequently the case, that advocates for dancing, and the\r\nother more exciting amusements, speak as if those, who were more strict\r\nin these matters, were aiming to deprive the young of all diversions;\r\njust as if, when cards, theatres, and dancing, are cut off, nothing\r\nremains but serious and severe duties. Perhaps there has been some just\r\nground of objection to the course often pursued by parents, in\r\nneglecting to provide agreeable and suitable substitutes, for the\r\namusements denied; but, there is a great abundance of safe, healthful,\r\nand delightful, recreations, which all parents may secure for their\r\nchildren. Some of these will here be pointed out.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful and important, is, the cultivation of flowers and\r\nfruits. This, especially for the daughters of a family, is greatly\r\npromotive of health and amusement. It is with the hope, that many young\r\nladies, whose habits are now so formed, that they can never be induced\r\nto a course of active domestic exercise, so long as their parents are\r\nable to hire domestics, may yet be led to an employment, which will tend\r\nto secure health and vigor of constitution, that so much space is given,\r\nin this work, to directions for the cultivation of fruits and flowers.\r\nIt would be a most desirable improvement, if all female schools could be\r\nfurnished with suitable grounds, and instruments, for the cultivation of\r\nfruits and flowers, and every inducement offered, to engage the young\r\nladies in this pursuit. No father, who wishes to have his daughters grow\r\nup to be healthful women, can take a surer method to secure this end.\r\nLet him set apart a portion of his yard and garden, for fruits and\r\nflowers, and see that the soil is well prepared and dug over, and all\r\nthe rest may be committed to the care of the children. These would need\r\nto be provided with a light hoe and rake, a dibble, or garden trowel, a\r\nwatering-pot, and means and opportunities for securing seeds, roots,\r\nbuds, and grafts, all which might be done at a trifling expense. Then,\r\nwith proper encouragement, and by the aid of such directions as are\r\ncontained in this work, every man, who has even half an acre, could\r\nsecure a small Eden around his premises.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this amusement, children can also be led to acquire many\r\nuseful habits. Early rising would, in many cases, be thus secured; and\r\nif they were required to keep their walks and borders free from weeds\r\nand rubbish, habits of order and neatness would be induced. Benevolent\r\nand social feelings could also be cultivated, by influencing children to\r\nshare their fruits and flowers with friends and neighbors, as well as\r\nto distribute roots and seeds to those, who have not the means of\r\nprocuring them. A woman or a child, by giving seeds, or slips, or roots,\r\nto a washerwoman, or a farmer's boy, thus exciting them to love and\r\ncultivate fruits and flowers, awakens a new and refining source of\r\nenjoyment in minds, which have few resources more elevated than mere\r\nphysical enjoyments. Our Saviour directs, in making feasts, to call, not\r\nthe rich, who can recompense again, but the poor, who can make no\r\nreturns. So children should be taught to dispense their little\r\ntreasures, not alone to companions and friends, who will probably return\r\nsimilar favors; but to those who have no means of making any return. If\r\nthe rich, who acquire a love for the enjoyments of taste, and have the\r\nmeans to gratify it, would aim to extend, among the poor, the cheap and\r\nsimple enjoyment of fruits and flowers, our Country would soon literally\r\n\"blossom as the rose.\"\r\n\r\nIf the ladies of a neighborhood would unite small contributions, and\r\nsend a list of flower-seeds and roots to some respectable and honest\r\nflorist, who would not be likely to turn them off with trash, they could\r\ndivide these among themselves, so as to secure an abundant variety, at a\r\nvery small expense. A bag of flower-seeds, which can be obtained, at\r\nwholesale, for four cents, would abundantly supply a whole neighborhood;\r\nand, by the gathering of seeds, in the Autumn, could be perpetuated.\r\n\r\nAnother very elevating and delightful recreation, for the young, is\r\nfound in _music_. Here, the writer would protest against the common\r\npractice, in many families, of having the daughters learn to play on the\r\npiano, whether they have a taste and an ear for music, or not. A young\r\nlady, who cannot sing, and has no great fondness for music, does nothing\r\nbut waste time, money, and patience, in learning to play on the piano.\r\nBut all children can be taught to sing, in early childhood, if the\r\nscientific mode of teaching music, in schools, could be introduced, as\r\nit is in Prussia, Germany, and Switzerland. Then, young children could\r\nread and sing music, as easily as they can read language; and might take\r\nany tune, dividing themselves into bands, and sing off, at sight, the\r\nendless variety of music which is prepared. And if parents of wealth\r\nwould take pains to have teachers qualified for the purpose, as they may\r\nbe at the Boston Academy, and other similar institutions, who should\r\nteach all the young children in the community, much would be done for\r\nthe happiness and elevation of the rising generation. This is an\r\namusement, which children relish, in the highest degree; and which they\r\ncan enjoy, at home, in the fields, and in visits abroad.\r\n\r\nAnother domestic amusement, is, the collecting of shells, plants, and\r\nspecimens in geology and mineralogy, for the formation of cabinets. If\r\nintelligent parents would procure the simpler works which have been\r\nprepared for the young, and study them, with their children, a _taste_\r\nfor such recreations would soon be developed. The writer has seen young\r\nboys, of eight and ten years of age, gathering and cleaning shells from\r\nrivers, and collecting plants, and mineralogical specimens, with a\r\ndelight, bordering on ecstasy; and there are few, if any, who, by proper\r\ninfluences, would not find this a source of ceaseless delight and\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nAnother resource, for family diversion, is to be found in the various\r\ngames played by children, and in which the joining of older members of\r\nthe family is always a great advantage to both parties. All medical men\r\nunite, in declaring that nothing is more beneficial to health, than\r\nhearty laughter; and surely our benevolent Creator would not have\r\nprovided risibles, and made it a source of health and enjoyment to use\r\nthem, if it were a sin so to do. There has been a tendency to\r\nasceticism, on this subject, which needs to be removed. Such commands,\r\nas forbid _foolish_ laughing and jesting, \"_which are not convenient_;\"\r\nand which forbid all idle words, and vain conversation, cannot apply to\r\nany thing, except what is foolish, vain, and useless. But jokes,\r\nlaughter, and sports, when used in such a degree as tends only to\r\npromote health, social feelings, and happiness, are neither vain,\r\nfoolish, nor \"not convenient.\" It is the excess of these things, and not\r\nthe moderate use of them, which Scripture forbids. The prevailing temper\r\nof the mind, should be cheerful, yet serious; but there are times, when\r\nrelaxation and laughter are proper for all. There is nothing better for\r\nthis end, than that parents and older persons should join in the sports\r\nof childhood. Mature minds can always make such diversions more\r\nentertaining to children, and can exert a healthful moral influence over\r\ntheir minds; and, at the same time, can gain exercise and amusement for\r\nthemselves. How lamentable, that so many fathers, who could be thus\r\nuseful and happy with their children, throw away such opportunities, and\r\nwear out soul and body, in the pursuit of gain or fame!\r\n\r\nAnother resource for children, is in the exercise of mechanical skill.\r\nFathers, by providing tools for their boys, and showing them how to make\r\nwheelbarrows, carts, sleds, and various other articles, contribute both\r\nto the physical, moral, and social, improvement of their children. And\r\nin regard to little daughters, much more can be done, in this way, than\r\nmany would imagine. The writer, blessed with the example of a most\r\ningenious and industrious mother, had not only learned, before the age\r\nof twelve, to make dolls, of various sorts and sizes, but to cut and fit\r\nand sew every article, that belongs to a doll's wardrobe. This, which\r\nwas done for mere amusement, secured such a facility in mechanical\r\npursuits, that, ever afterward, the cutting and fitting of any article\r\nof dress, for either sex, was accomplished with entire ease.\r\n\r\nWhen a little girl first begins to sew, her mother can promise her a\r\nsmall bed and pillows, as soon as she has sewed a patch quilt for them;\r\nand then a bedstead, as soon as she has sewed the sheets and cases for\r\npillows; and then a large doll to dress, as soon as she has made the\r\nunder garments; and thus go on, till the whole contents of the\r\nbaby-house are earned by the needle and skill of its little owner. Thus,\r\nthe task of learning to sew, will become a pleasure; and every new toy\r\nwill be earned by useful exertion. A little girl can be taught, by the\r\naid of patterns prepared for the purpose, to cut and fit all articles\r\nnecessary for her doll. She can also be provided with a little wash-tub,\r\nand irons, to wash and iron, and thus keep in proper order a complete\r\nminiature domestic establishment.\r\n\r\nBesides these recreations, there are the enjoyments secured in walking,\r\nriding, visiting, and many others which need not be recounted. Children,\r\nif trained to be healthful and industrious, will never fail to discover\r\nresources of amusement; while their guardians should lend their aid to\r\nguide and restrain them from excess.\r\n\r\nThere is need of a very great change of opinion and practice, in this\r\nNation, in regard to the subject of social and domestic duties. Many\r\nsensible and conscientious men, spend all their time, abroad, in\r\nbusiness, except, perhaps, an hour or so at night, when they are so\r\nfatigued, as to be unfitted for any social or intellectual enjoyment.\r\nAnd some of the most conscientious men in the Country, will add, to\r\ntheir professional business, public or benevolent enterprises, which\r\ndemand time, effort, and money; and then excuse themselves for\r\nneglecting all care of their children, and efforts for their own\r\nintellectual improvement, or for the improvement of their families, by\r\nthe plea, that they have no time for it. All this, arises from the want\r\nof correct notions of the binding obligation of our social and domestic\r\nduties. The main object of life, is not to secure the various\r\ngratifications of appetite or taste, but to _form such a character_, for\r\nourselves and others, as will secure the greatest amount of present and\r\nfuture happiness. It is of far more consequence, then, that parents\r\nshould be intelligent, social, affectionate, and agreeable, at home, and\r\nto their friends, than that they should earn money enough to live in a\r\nlarge house, and have handsome furniture. It is far more needful, for\r\nchildren, that a father should attend to the formation of their\r\ncharacter and habits, and aid in developing their social, intellectual,\r\nand moral nature, than it is, that he should earn money to furnish them\r\nwith handsome clothes, and a variety of tempting food.\r\n\r\nIt will be wise for those parents, who find little time to attend to\r\ntheir children, or to seek amusement and enjoyment in the domestic and\r\nsocial circle, because their time is so much occupied with public cares\r\nor benevolent objects, to inquire, whether their first duty is not to\r\ntrain up their own families, to be useful members of society. A man, who\r\nneglects the mind and morals of his children, to take care of the\r\npublic, is in great danger of coming under a similar condemnation, to\r\nthat of him, who, neglecting to provide for his own household, has\r\n\"denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.\"\r\n\r\nThere are husbands and fathers, who conscientiously subtract time from\r\ntheir business, to spend at home, in reading with their wives and\r\nchildren, and in domestic amusements which at once refresh and improve.\r\nThe children of such parents will grow up with a love of home and\r\nkindred, which will be the greatest safeguard against future\r\ntemptations, as well as the purest source of earthly enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThere are families, also, who make it a definite object to keep up\r\nfamily attachments, after the children are scattered abroad; and, in\r\nsome cases, secure the means for doing this, by saving money, which\r\nwould otherwise have been spent for superfluities of food or dress. Some\r\nfamilies have adopted, for this end, a practice, which if widely\r\nimitated, would be productive of extensive benefit. The method is this.\r\nOn the first day of each month, some member of the family, at each\r\nextreme point of dispersion, takes a folio sheet, and fills a part of a\r\npage. This is sealed and mailed to the next family, who read it, add\r\nanother contribution, and then mail it to the next. Thus the family\r\ncircular, once a month, goes from each extreme, to all the members of a\r\nwidely-dispersed family, and each member becomes a sharer in the joys,\r\nsorrows, plans, and pursuits, of all the rest. At the same time,\r\nfrequent family meetings are sought; and the expense, thus incurred, is\r\ncheerfully met by retrenchments in other directions. The sacrifice of\r\nsome unnecessary physical indulgence, (such, for instance, as the use of\r\ntea and coffee,) will often purchase many social and domestic\r\nenjoyments, a thousand times more elevating and delightful, than the\r\nretrenched luxury.\r\n\r\nThere is no social duty, which the Supreme Lawgiver more strenuously\r\nurges, than hospitality and kindness to strangers, who are classed with\r\nthe widow and the fatherless, as the special objects of Divine\r\ntenderness. There are some reasons, why this duty peculiarly demands\r\nattention from the American people.\r\n\r\nReverses of fortune, in this land, are so frequent and unexpected, and\r\nthe habits of the people are so migratory, that there are very many in\r\nevery part of the Country, who, having seen all their temporal plans and\r\nhopes crushed, are now pining among strangers, bereft of wonted\r\ncomforts, without friends, and without the sympathy and society, so\r\nneedful to wounded spirits. Such, too frequently, sojourn long and\r\nlonely, with no comforter but Him who \"knoweth the heart of a stranger.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever, therefore, new comers enter a community, inquiry should\r\nimmediately be made, whether they have friends and associates, to render\r\nsympathy and kind attentions; and, when there is any need for it, the\r\nministries of kind neighborhood should immediately be offered. And it\r\nshould be remembered, that the first days of a stranger's sojourn, are\r\nthe most dreary, and that civility and kindness are doubled in value, by\r\nbeing offered at an early period.\r\n\r\nIn social gatherings, the claims of the stranger are too apt to be\r\nforgotten; especially, in cases where there are no peculiar attractions\r\nof personal appearance, or talents, or high standing. Such a one should\r\nbe treated with attention, _because he is a stranger_; and when\r\ncommunities learn to act more from principle, and less from selfish\r\nimpulse, on this subject, the sacred claims of the stranger will be less\r\nfrequently forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe most agreeable hospitality, to visiters, who become inmates of a\r\nfamily, is, that which puts them entirely at ease. This can never be the\r\ncase, where the guest perceives that the order of family arrangements is\r\nessentially altered, and that time, comfort, and convenience are\r\nsacrificed, for his accommodation.\r\n\r\nOffering the best to visiters, showing a polite regard to every wish\r\nexpressed, and giving precedence to them, in all matters of comfort and\r\nconvenience, can be easily combined with the easy freedom which makes\r\nthe stranger feel at home; and this is the perfection of hospitable\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nON THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no point of domestic economy, which more seriously involves the\r\nhealth and daily comfort of American women, than the proper construction\r\nof houses. There are five particulars, to which attention should be\r\ngiven, in building a house; namely, economy of labor, economy of money,\r\neconomy of health, economy of comfort, and good taste. Some particulars\r\nwill here be pointed out, under each of these heads.\r\n\r\nThe first, respects _economy of labor_. In deciding upon the size and\r\nstyle of a house, the health and capacity of the housekeeper, and the\r\nprobabilities of securing proper domestics, ought to be the very first\r\nconsideration. If a man be uncertain as to his means for hiring service,\r\nor if he have a feeble wife, and be where properly-qualified domestics\r\nare scarce, it is very poor economy to build a large house, or to live\r\nin a style which demands much labor. Every room in a house adds to the\r\nexpense involved in finishing and furnishing it, and to the amount of\r\nlabor spent in sweeping, dusting, cleaning floors, paint, and windows,\r\nand taking care of, and repairing, its furniture. Double the size of a\r\nhouse, and you double the labor of taking care of it, and so, _vice\r\nversa_. There is, in this Country, a very great want of calculation and\r\neconomy, in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of rooms, and the proper supply of conveniences, are\r\nother points, in which, economy of labor and comfort is often\r\ndisregarded. For example, a kitchen will be in one story, a sitting-room\r\nin another, and the nursery in a third. Nothing is more injurious, to a\r\nfeeble woman, than going up and down stairs; and yet, in order to gain\r\ntwo large parlors, to show to a few friends, or to strangers, immense\r\nsacrifices of health, comfort, and money, are made. If it be possible,\r\nthe nursery, sitting-parlor, and kitchen, ought always to be on the same\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe position of wells and cisterns, and the modes of raising and\r\ncarrying water, are other particulars, in which, economy of labor and\r\ncomfort is sadly neglected. With half the expense usually devoted to a\r\nsideboard or sofa, the water used from a well or cistern can be so\r\nconducted, as that, by simply turning a cock, it will flow to the place\r\nwhere it is to be used.\r\n\r\nA want of economy, in labor and in money, is often seen in the shape and\r\narrangement of houses, and in the style of ornaments and furniture. A\r\n_perfect square_, encloses more rooms, at less expense, than any other\r\nshape; while it has less surface exposed to external cold, and can be\r\nmost easily warmed and ventilated. And the farther a house is removed\r\nfrom this shape, the more the expense is increased. Wings and kitchens\r\nbuilt out, beyond a house, very much increase expense, both in building\r\nand warming them.\r\n\r\nPiazzas and porticoes are very expensive; and their cost would secure\r\nfar more comfort, if devoted to additional nursery or kitchen\r\nconveniences. Many kinds of porticoes cost as much as one additional\r\nroom in the house. Houses can be so constructed, that one staircase will\r\nanswer for both kitchen and parlour use, as may be seen in the engraving\r\non page 269, (Fig. 27.) This saves the expense and labor usually devoted\r\nto a large hall and front staircase.\r\n\r\nMuch money is often worse than wasted, by finical ornaments, which are\r\nfast going out of fashion. One of the largest, most beautiful, and\r\nagreeable, houses, the writer was ever in, was finished with doors,\r\nwindows, and fireplaces, in even a plainer style than any given in the\r\nsubsequent drawings.\r\n\r\nThe position of fireplaces has much to do with economy of expense in\r\nwarming a house. Where the fireplace is in an outer wall, one third of\r\nthe heat passes out of doors, which would be retained in the house, if\r\nthe chimney were within the rooms. A house, contrived like the one\r\nrepresented in the engraving on page 272, (Fig. 32,) which can be heated\r\nby a stove or chimney at X, may be warmed with less fuel than one of any\r\nother construction.[R]\r\n\r\n_Economy of health_ is often disregarded, by placing wells, cisterns,\r\nand privies, so that persons, in the perspiration of labor, or the\r\ndebility of disease, are obliged to go out of doors in all weathers.\r\nFigure 35, on page 276, shows the proper arrangement of such\r\nconveniences. The placing of an outside door, for common use, in a\r\nsitting-room, as is frequent at the West and South, is detrimental to\r\nhealth. In such cases, children, in their sports, or persons who labor,\r\nare thrown into perspiration, by exercise, the door is thrown open, a\r\nchill ensues, and fever, bowel complaints, or bilious attacks, are the\r\nresult. A long window, extending down to the floor, which can be used as\r\na door, in Summer, and be tightly closed, at the bottom, in Winter,\r\nsecures all the benefits, without the evils, of an outside door.\r\n\r\nConstructing houses, without open fireplaces in chambers, or any other\r\nmode of ventilation, is another sad violation of the economy of health.\r\nFeeble constitutions in children, and ill health to domestics, are often\r\ncaused by this folly.\r\n\r\nThe _economy of comfort_ is often violated, by arrangements made for\r\ndomestics. Many a woman has been left to endure much hard labor and\r\nperplexity, because she chose to have money spent on handsome parlors\r\nand chambers, for company, which should have been devoted to providing a\r\ncomfortable kitchen and chambers for domestics. Cramping the\r\nconveniences and comfort of a family, in order to secure elegant rooms,\r\nto show to company, is a weakness and folly, which it is hoped will\r\nevery year become less common.\r\n\r\nThe construction of houses with reference to _good taste_, is a\r\ndesirable, though less important, item. The beauty of a house depends\r\nvery much upon propriety of proportions, color, and ornament. And it is\r\nalways as cheap, and generally cheaper, to build a house in agreement\r\nwith the rules of good taste, than to build an awkward and\r\nill-proportioned one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plans of Houses and Domestic Conveniences._\r\n\r\nThe following plans are designed chiefly for persons in moderate\r\ncircumstances, and have especial reference to young housekeepers.\r\n\r\nEvery year, as the prosperity of this Nation increases, good domestics\r\nwill decrease, and young mothers are hereafter to be called to\r\nsuperintend and perform all branches of domestic business, to nurse\r\nchildren, direct ignorant domestics, attend the sick, entertain company,\r\nand fulfil all other family duties; and this, too, in a majority of\r\ncases, with delicate constitutions, or impaired health. Every man,\r\ntherefore, in forming plans for a future residence, and every woman who\r\nhas any influence in deciding such matters, ought to make these\r\nprobabilities the chief basis of their calculations.[S]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.\r\n\r\nGround-plan.\r\n\r\n_a_, Porch.\r\n_b_, Parlor, 15 by 16 feet.\r\n_c_, Dining-room, 15 by 16 feet.\r\n_d, d_, Small Bedrooms.\r\n_e_, Stairs.\r\n_f, f, f_, Closets.\r\n_g_, Pantry.\r\n_h_, Store-closet.\r\n_i, i, i_, Fireplaces.\r\n_j_, Kitchen.\r\n_k_, Bedpress.\r\n_z_, Cellar door.\r\n\r\nScale of Feet.]\r\n\r\nThe plan, exhibited in Figures 17, and 18, is that of a cottage, whose\r\nchief exterior beauty is its fine proportions. It should be painted\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nFig. 17, is the _elevation_, or the front view of the exterior. Fig. 18,\r\nis the ground-plan, in which, an entire break in the wall, represents a\r\ndoor, and a break with a line across it, a window. When a cross x is put\r\nby a door, it indicates into which room the door swings, and where the\r\nhinges should be put, as the comfort of a fireside very much depends on\r\nthe way in which the doors are hung. A scale of measurement is given at\r\nthe bottom of the drawings, by which, the size of all parts can be\r\nmeasured. The ten small divisions, are each one foot. The longest\r\ndivisions are ten feet each.\r\n\r\nIn the ground-plan, (Fig. 18,) _a_, is the porch, which projects enough\r\nto afford an entrance to the two adjacent rooms, and thus avoids the\r\nevil of an outside door to a sitting-room. If a door be wanted in these\r\nrooms, the front windows can be made to extend down to the floor, so as\r\nto serve as doors in Summer, and be tightly closed in Winter. The\r\nparlor, _b_, has the bedpress, _k_, and the closet, _f_, adjoining it.\r\nFigure 19 is intended to represent this side of the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nScale of Feet for the Doors.]\r\n\r\nThe two large doors, in the centre, open into the bedpress, and one of\r\nthe smaller ones into the closet, _f_. The other, can either be a false\r\ndoor, in order to secure symmetry, or else a real one, opening into the\r\nkitchen, _j_.\r\n\r\nA room, thus arranged, can be made to serve as a genteel parlor, for\r\ncompany, during the day, when all these doors can be closed. At night,\r\nthe doors of the bedpress being opened, it is changed to an airy\r\nbedroom, while the closets, _f, f_, serve to conceal all accommodations\r\npertaining to a bedroom. The bedpress is just large enough to receive a\r\nbed; and under it, if need be, might be placed a trucklebed, for young\r\nchildren. The eating-room, _c_, has the small bedroom, _d_, adjoining\r\nit, which, by leaving the door open, at night, will be sufficiently airy\r\nfor a sleeping-room. The kitchen, _j_, has a smaller bedroom, _d_,\r\nattached to it, which will hold a narrow single bed for a domestic; and,\r\nif need be, a narrow trucklebed under it, for a child. The staircase to\r\nthe garret, can either be placed in the eating-room, or in the small\r\nentry. A plan for back accommodations is shown in Fig. 35, (page 276.)\r\nThese should be placed in the rear of the kitchen, so as not to cover\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nA house like this, will conveniently accommodate a family of six or\r\neight persons; but some economy and contrivance will be needed, in\r\nstoring away articles of dress and bedclothing. For this end, in the\r\nbedpress, _k_, of the parlor, _b_, (Fig. 18,) a wide shelf may be\r\nplaced, two feet from the ceiling, where winter bedding, or folded\r\nclothing, can be stowed, while a short curtain in front, hung from the\r\nwall, will give a tidy look, and keep out dust. Under this shelf, if\r\nneed be, pegs can be placed, to hold other articles; and a curtain be\r\nhung from the edge of the shelf, to conceal and protect them. Both the\r\nclosets, _f, f_, should have shelves and drawers. The garret can have a\r\nwindow inserted in the roof, and thus be made serviceable for storage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nFigure 20 represents a fireplace and mantelpiece, in a style\r\ncorresponding with the doors.\r\n\r\nSuch a cottage as this, could be built for from five hundred to nine\r\nhundred dollars, according as the expense of labor in the place, and the\r\nexcellence of the materials and labor, may vary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nFigures 21 and 22, show the elevation and ground-plan of a cottage, in\r\nwhich the rooms are rather more agreeably arranged, than in the former\r\nplan. The elevation, (Fig. 21,) has a piazza, running across the whole\r\nfront. This would cost nearly two hundred dollars; and, for this sum,\r\nanother story might be added. An architect told the writer, that he\r\ncould build the two-story house, (Fig. 23 and 24,) without a piazza,\r\nfor the same sum, as this cottage, _with_ one. This shows the poor\r\neconomy of these appendages.\r\n\r\nThe ground-plan, (Fig. 22,) will be understood, from the explanation\r\nappended to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nScale of Feet.\r\n\r\n_a_, Porch.\r\n_b_, Entry.\r\n_c_, Stairs.\r\n_d_, Parlor, 16 by 20 feet.\r\n_e_, Dining-room, 16 by 16 feet.\r\n_f_, Kitchen.\r\n_g, g, g_, Bedpresses.\r\n_h, h, h, h_, Closets.\r\n_i_, Store-closet.\r\n_j_, Back entry and Sink.\r\n_p_, Cellar stairs.\r\n_o, o, o_, Fireplaces.]\r\n\r\nThe parlor, _d_, is designed to have the doors (shown in Fig. 19) placed\r\nat the end, where is the bedpress, _g_. This will make it a handsome\r\nparlor, by day, and yet allow it to be used as a bedroom, at night. The\r\nbedpresses, in the other rooms, can have less expensive doors. A window\r\nis put in each bedpress, to secure proper ventilation. These should be\r\nopened, to air the bed, on leaving it. These can be fitted up with\r\nshelves, pegs, and curtains, as before described. If the elevation of\r\nthe first cottage be preferred to this, as being less expensive, it can\r\nbe used, by altering it a little; thus, instead of the projection for\r\nthe entry, make a slight projection, of the width of one brick, to\r\npreserve the same general outside appearance. Let the windows extend\r\ndown to the floor, and the beauty of symmetry will also be preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nGround-plan.\r\n\r\n_a_, Entry.\r\n_b_, Stairs.\r\n_c_, Parlor, 16 by 20 feet.\r\n_d_, Kitchen, 14 by 14 feet.\r\n_e_, Store-closet.\r\n_f_, Pantry.\r\n_g_, Sinkroom.\r\n_h_, Closet.\r\n_i, i_, Fireplaces.\r\n_n_, Cellar door.\r\n_o_, Oven.\r\n_y_, Furnace.\r\n_z_, Sink.\r\n\r\nScale of Feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nSecond Story.\r\n\r\n_a_, Stairs.\r\n_b_, Passage.\r\n_c, c, c_, Bedrooms.\r\n_d, d, d, d_, Closets.\r\n_e, e_, Fireplaces.\r\n_f_, Nursery.\r\n_g_, Room for young children.]\r\n\r\nThe plans, shown in Fig. 23 and 24, are designed for families, where\r\nmost domestic labor is to be done without the aid of domestics. The\r\nparlor, _c_, is for a sitting-room, and for company. The room, _d_, is\r\nthe eating-room; where, also, the ironing and other nicer family work\r\ncan be done. In the small room, _g_, either an oven and boiler, or a\r\ncooking-stove, can be placed. The elevation, shown in Fig. 25, is\r\ndesigned for the front of this house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nFigures 27 and 28, are plans of a two-story house, on a larger scale,\r\nwith a concealed staircase, for front and back use. The elevation, Fig.\r\n26, is designed for this plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.\r\n\r\nGround-plan.\r\n\r\n_b, b_, Entry.\r\n_c_, Stairs.\r\n_d_, Parlor, 16 by 20 feet.\r\n_e_, Dining-room, 15 by 16 feet.\r\n_f_, Kitchen, 15 by 16 feet.\r\n_g, g, g_, Closets.\r\n_h_, Store-closet.\r\n_i_, Back entry.\r\n_j_, Pantry.\r\n_k, k, k_, Fireplaces.\r\n_x_, Cellar stairs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.\r\n\r\nSecond Story.\r\n\r\n_a, a, a, a_, Bedrooms.\r\n_b_, Stairs.\r\n_c, c, c_, Closets.\r\n_d_, Passage.\r\n_e, e, e_, Fireplaces.\r\n_y_, Garret stairs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.\r\n\r\nGround-floor.\r\n\r\n_b_, Entry.\r\n_c_, Parlor, 17 by 17 feet.\r\n_d_, Dining-room, 13 by 15 feet.\r\n_e_, Parlor or Bedroom, 17 by 17 feet.\r\n_f_, Kitchen, 19 by 17 feet.\r\n_g_, Stairs.\r\n_h_, Store-closet.\r\n_i, i, i_, Closets.\r\n_n, n, n, n_, Fireplaces.\r\n_o_, Folding-doors.\r\n_p_, Pegs for over-garments.\r\n_z_, Cellar stairs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.\r\n\r\nSecond Story.\r\n\r\n_a, a, a, a, a_, Bedrooms.\r\n_b_, Stairs.\r\n_c_, Passage.\r\n_d, d, d, d_, Closets.\r\n_e, e, e, e_, Fireplaces.]\r\n\r\nFigures 29 and 30, are plans for a larger house, which can have either\r\nof the elevations, Fig. 25 or 26, adapted to it. These also have a\r\nconcealed staircase, for front and back use. If a nursery, or bedroom,\r\nis wished, on the ground-floor, the back parlor, _e_, can be taken; in\r\nwhich case, the closets, _i_, _i_, are very useful. To prevent noise\r\nfrom reaching the front parlor, two sets of folding-doors, each side of\r\nthe passage, _o_, could be placed. With this arrangement, these rooms\r\ncould be used, sometimes as two parlors, opening into each other, by\r\nfolding doors, and at other times, as a nursery and parlor. In this\r\nplan, the storeroom, _h_, and china-closet, _i_, between the kitchen and\r\neating-room, are a great convenience.\r\n\r\nFigures 31 and 32, present the plan of a Gothic cottage, which secures\r\nthe most economy of _labor_ and _expense_, with the greatest amount of\r\n_convenience and comfort_, which the writer has ever seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nThe elevation, (Fig. 31,) exhibits the front view. It has a recess in\r\nthe central part, under which, is the door, with a window on each side\r\nof it. This forms a piazza; and into this, and a similar one at the back\r\nof the house, the two centre parlors open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the house, (see Fig. 32,) are the two parlors, _b_ and\r\n_c_; the back one to be used as an eating-room. At X, can be placed,\r\neither a chimney, with doors on each side of the fireplace, or, (which\r\nis the most agreeable,) folding-doors, which can be thrown open in\r\nSummer, thus making a large saloon, through the house, from one piazza\r\nto the other. In this case, the parlors are warmed by a large stove, set\r\nnear the folding-doors, which would easily warm both parlors and one or\r\ntwo adjacent rooms. In Winter, the outside doors, opening to the\r\npiazzas, should be fastened and calked, and the side entry, at _d_, be\r\nused. At _e_, is the nursery, with the bedpress, _g_, which, being\r\nclosed by day, makes a retired parlor for the mother. At _n_, is the\r\nchildren's playroom and sleeping-room, adjoining the mother's room. At\r\n_k_, is the kitchen, adjacent to the eating-room, with the storeroom,\r\n_e_, and the closets, _m_, _m_, one for the eating-room, and one for the\r\nkitchen utensils. At _i_, is a parlor, which can be used for a study or\r\nlibrary, by the master of the family; while the adjacent bedpress, _j_,\r\nrenders it a convenient lodging-room, for guests. Another lodging-room,\r\nis at _h_; and in the attic, is space enough for several comfortable\r\nlodging-rooms. A window in the roof, on the front and back, like the one\r\non Wadsworth's Cottage, (Fig. 33,) could be placed over the front door,\r\nto light the chambers in the attic. A double roof in the attic, with a\r\ncurrent of air between, secures cool chambers. The closets are marked\r\n_o_, and the fireplaces _p_. The stairs to the attic are at _q_. By this\r\narrangement, the housekeeper has her parlor, sleeping-room, nursery, and\r\nkitchen, on the same floor, while the rooms with bedpresses, enable her\r\nto increase either parlors or lodging-rooms, at pleasure, without\r\ninvolving the care of a very large and expensive house.\r\n\r\nFigure 33, is the representation of a cottage, built by Daniel\r\nWadsworth, Esq., in the vicinity of Hartford, Connecticut; and is on a\r\nplan, which, though much smaller, is very similar to the plan\r\nrepresented in Fig. 32. It serves to show the manner in which the\r\n_roofs_ should be arranged, in Fig. 31, which, being seen exactly in\r\nfront, does not give any idea of the mode of this arrangement. The\r\nelevation of Wadsworth's cottage, could be taken for the ground-plan\r\nshown in Fig. 32, if it be preferred to the other.\r\n\r\nBoth this cottage, and all the other plans, require a woodhouse, and the\r\nconveniences connected with it, which are represented in Fig. 35, (page\r\n276.) For these Gothic cottages, an appendage of this sort should be in\r\nkeeping with the rest, having windows, like those in the little\r\nSummer-house in the drawing, and battlements, as on the top of the wings\r\nof the barn. The ornaments on the front of the cottage, and the pillars\r\nof the portico, made simply of the trunks of small trees, give a\r\nbeautiful rural finish, and their expense is trifling. In this picture,\r\nthe trees could not be placed as they are in reality, because they would\r\nhide the buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\nIn arranging yards and grounds, the house should be set back, as in the\r\ndrawing of Wadsworth's cottage; and, instead of planting shade-trees in\r\nstraight lines, or scattering them about, as single trees, they should\r\nbe arranged in clusters, with large openings for turf, flowers, and\r\nshrubbery, which never flourish well under the shade and dropping of\r\ntrees. This also secures spots of dark and cool shade, even when trees\r\nare young.\r\n\r\nIn arranging shade-trees tastefully around such a place, a large cluster\r\nmight be placed on each side of the gate; another on the circular\r\ngrass-plot, at the side of the house; another at a front corner; and\r\nanother at a back corner. Shrubbery, along the walks, and on the\r\ncircular plot, in front, and flowers close to the house, would look\r\nwell. The barn, also, should have clusters of trees near it; and\r\noccasional single trees, on the lawn, would give the graceful ease and\r\nvariety seen in nature.\r\n\r\nFigure 34, represents the accommodations for securing water with the\r\nleast labor. It is designed for a well or cistern under ground. The\r\nreservoir, R, may be a half hogshead, or something larger, which may be\r\nfilled once a day, from the pump, by a man, or boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.\r\n\r\n_P_, Pump. _L_, Steps to use when pumping. _R_, Reservoir. _G_,\r\nBrickwork to raise the Reservoir. _B_, A large Boiler. _F_, Furnace,\r\nbeneath the Boiler. _C_, Conductor of cold water. _H_, Conductor of hot\r\nwater. _K_, Cock for letting cold water into the Boiler. _S_, Pipe to\r\nconduct cold water to a cock over the kitchen sink. _T_, Bathing-tub,\r\nwhich receives cold water from the Conductor, _C_, and hot water from\r\nthe Conductor, _H_. _W_, Partition separating the Bathing-room from the\r\nWash-room. _Y_, Cock to draw off hot water. _Z_, Plug to let off the\r\nwater from the Bathing-tub into a drain.]\r\n\r\nThe conductor, C, should be a lead pipe, which, instead of going over\r\nthe boiler, should be bent along behind it. From S, a branch sets off,\r\nwhich conducts the cold water to the sink in the kitchen, where it\r\ndischarges with a cock. H, is a conductor from the lower part of the\r\nboiler, made of copper, or some metal not melted by great heat; and at\r\nY, a cock is placed, to draw off hot water. Then the conductor passes to\r\nthe bathing-tub, where is another cock. At Z, the water is let off from\r\nthe bathing-tub. By this arrangement, great quantities of hot and cold\r\nwater can be used, with no labor in carrying, and with very little labor\r\nin raising it.\r\n\r\nIn case a cistern is built above ground, it can be placed as the\r\nreservoir is, and then all the labor of pumping is saved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.\r\n\r\n_A_, Boiler and furnace.\r\n_B_, Bathing-room.\r\n_C_, Reservoir.\r\n_D_, Pump.\r\n_E_, Wash-form.\r\n_F_, Sink.\r\n_G_, Kitchen.\r\n_H_, Woodpile.\r\n_I_, Large doors.\r\n_i_,_i_, Bins for coal and ashes.\r\n_O_, Window.\r\n_P_, _P_, Privies.\r\n_T_, Bathing-tub.\r\n_V_, Door.]\r\n\r\nFig. 35, is the plan of a building for back-door accommodations. At _A_,\r\n_C_, _D_, _E_, are accommodations shown in Fig. 34. The bathing-room is\r\nadjacent to the boiler and reservoir, to receive the water. The privy,\r\n_P_, _P_, should have two apartments, as indispensable to healthful\r\nhabits in a family. A window should be placed at _O_, and a door, with\r\nsprings or a weight to keep it shut, should be at _V_. Keeping the\r\nwindow open, and the door shut, will prevent any disagreeable effects in\r\nthe house. At _G_, is the kitchen, and at _F_, the sink, which should\r\nhave a conductor and cock from the reservoir. _H_, is the place for\r\nwood, where it should in Summer be stored for Winter. A bin, for coal,\r\nand also a brick receiver, for ashes, should be in this part. Every\r\nwoman should use her influence to secure all these conveniences; even if\r\nit involves the sacrifice of the piazza, or \"the best parlor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.\r\n\r\nFront View.\r\n\r\nSide View.]\r\n\r\nFig. 36, is a latticed portico, which is cheap, and answers all the\r\npurposes of a more expensive one. It should be solid, overhead, to turn\r\noff the rain, and creepers should be trained over it. A simple latticed\r\narch, over a door, covered with creepers, is very cheap, and serves\r\ninstead of an expensive portico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.\r\n\r\n_C_, Parlor ceiling.\r\n_K_, Kitchen ceiling.]\r\n\r\nFig. 37, represents a _sliding closet_, or _dumb waiter_, a convenience\r\nwhich saves much labor, when the kitchen is in the basement. The two\r\nclosets should be made wide, and broad enough to receive a common\r\nwaiter. The chain, or rope, which passes over the wheels, should branch,\r\nat _X_, so as to keep the closet from rubbing in its movements, when the\r\ndishes are not set exactly in the middle, or are of unequal weights. By\r\nthis method, almost every thing needed to pass between the kitchen and\r\nparlor can be sent up and down, without any steps. If the kitchen is not\r\ndirectly under the eating-room, the sliding closet can be placed in the\r\nvicinity of one or both. Where the place is not wide enough for two\r\nclosets like these, they can be made wider than they are long, say one\r\nfoot and six inches long, and three feet wide. A strip of wood, an inch\r\nbroad, should be fastened on the front and back of the shelves, to\r\nprevent the dishes from being broken when they are set on carelessly.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, which so much improves the appearance of a house and\r\nthe premises, as painting or whitewashing the tenements and fences. The\r\nfollowing receipts for whitewashing, answer the same purpose for wood,\r\nbrick, and stone, as oil-paint, and are much cheaper. The first, is the\r\nreceipt used for the President's house, at Washington, improved by\r\nfurther experiments. The second, is a cheaper one, which the writer has\r\nknown to succeed, in a variety of cases, lasting as long, and looking as\r\nwell, as white oil-paint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Receipt._\r\n\r\nTake half a bushel of unslacked lime, and slack it with boiling water,\r\ncovering it, during the process. Strain it, and add a peck of salt,\r\ndissolved in warm water; three pounds of ground rice, boiled to a thin\r\npaste, put in boiling hot; half a pound of powdered Spanish whiting; and\r\na pound of clear glue, dissolved in warm water. Mix, and let it stand\r\nseveral days. Heat it in a kettle, on a portable furnace, and apply it\r\nas hot as possible, with a painter's or whitewash-brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Another._\r\n\r\nMake whitewash, in the usual way, except that the water used should be\r\nhot, and nearly saturated with salt. Then stir in four handfuls of fine\r\nsand, to make it thick like cream. Coloring matter can be added to\r\nboth, making a light stone-color, a cream-color, or a light buff, which\r\nare most suitable for buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[R] Many houses are now heated, by a furnace in the cellar, which\r\nreceives pure air from out of doors, heats it, and sends it into several\r\nrooms, while water is evaporated to prevent the air from becoming dry.\r\nThe most perfect one the writer has seen, is constructed by Mr. Fowler,\r\nof Hartford. This method secures well-ventilated rooms, and is very\r\neconomical, where several rooms are to be warmed.\r\n\r\n[S] Those, who are amateurs in architecture, in judging of these\r\ndesigns, must take into consideration, that this is a work on domestic\r\n_economy_, and that matters of taste, have necessarily been made\r\nsubordinate to points, involving economy of health, comfort, and\r\nexpense. Still, it is believed, that good taste has been essentially\r\npreserved, in most of these designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nON FIRES AND LIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shallow fireplace saves wood, and gives out more heat than a deeper\r\none. A false back, of brick, may be put up in a deep fireplace. Hooks,\r\nfor holding up the shovel and tongs, a hearth-brush and bellows, and\r\nbrass knobs to hang them on, should be furnished to every fireplace. An\r\niron bar, across the andirons, aids in keeping the fire safe, and in\r\ngood order. Steel furniture is more genteel, and more easily kept in\r\norder, than that made of brass.\r\n\r\nUse green wood, for logs, and mix green and dry wood for the fire; and\r\nthen the woodpile will last much longer. Walnut, maple, hickory, and\r\noak, wood, are best, chestnut or hemlock is bad, because it snaps. Do\r\nnot buy a load, in which there are many crooked sticks. Learn how to\r\nmeasure and calculate the solid contents of a load, so as not to be\r\ncheated. Have all your wood split, and piled under cover, for Winter.\r\nHave the green wood logs in one pile, dry wood in another, oven-wood in\r\nanother, kindlings and chips in another, and a supply of charcoal to use\r\nfor broiling and ironing, in another place. Have a brick bin, for ashes,\r\nand never allow them to be put in wood. When quitting fires, at night,\r\nnever leave a burning stick across the andirons, nor on its end, without\r\nquenching it. See that no fire adheres to the broom or brush; remove all\r\narticles from the fire, and have two pails, filled with water, in the\r\nkitchen, where they will not freeze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stoves and Grates._\r\n\r\nRooms, heated by stoves, should always have some opening for the\r\nadmission of fresh air, or they will be injurious to health. The dryness\r\nof the air, which they occasion, should be remedied, either by placing a\r\nvessel, filled with water, on the stove, or by hooking a long and narrow\r\npan, filled with water, in front of the grate; otherwise, the lungs or\r\neyes may be injured. A large number of plants in a room, prevents this\r\ndryness of the air. Openings for pipes, through floors, partitions, or\r\nfireboards, should be surrounded by tin, to prevent their taking fire.\r\nLengthening a pipe, will increase its draught.\r\n\r\nFor those, who use _anthracite coal_, that which is broken or screened,\r\nis best for grates, and the nut-coal, for small stoves. Three tons are\r\nsufficient, in the Middle States, and four tons in the Northern, to keep\r\none fire through the Winter. That which is bright, hard, and clean, is\r\nbest; and that which is soft, porous, and covered with damp dust, is\r\npoor. It will be well to provide two barrels of charcoal, for kindling,\r\nto every ton of anthracite coal. Grates, for _bituminous_ coal, should\r\nhave a flue nearly as deep as the grate; and the bars should be round,\r\nand not close together. The better draught there is, the less coal-dust\r\nis made. Every grate should be furnished with a poker, shovel, tongs,\r\nblower, coal-scuttle, and holder for the blower. The latter may be made\r\nof woollen, covered with old silk, and hung near the fire.\r\n\r\nCoal-stoves should be carefully put up, as cracks, in the pipe,\r\nespecially in sleeping rooms, are dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Lights._\r\n\r\nLamps are better than candles, as they give a steadier light, and do not\r\nscatter grease, like tallow candles. The best oil, is clear, and nearly\r\ncolorless. Winter-strained oil should be used in cold weather. Lard is a\r\ngood substitute for oil, for astral and other large lamps. It is\r\ncheaper, burns clearer, and has a less disagreeable smell. It will not\r\nburn so well in small lamps, as in large ones. Melt it every morning, in\r\nan old pitcher, kept for the purpose. Oil, long kept, grows thick, and\r\ndoes not burn well. It is therefore best not to buy it in large\r\nquantities. It should never be left standing in lamps, for several days,\r\nas this spoils it, and often injures the lamps. Camphine is a kind of\r\noil manufactured in New York, which does not smell disagreeably, nor\r\nmake grease-spots, and gives a brighter light than the best oil. Cleanse\r\nthe insides of lamps and oil-cans, with pearlash-water. Be careful to\r\ndrain them well, and not to let any gilding, or bronze, be injured by\r\nthe pearlash-water coming in contact with it. Put one tablespoonful of\r\npearlash to one quart of water.\r\n\r\nThe care of lamps requires so much attention and discretion, that many\r\nladies choose to do this work, themselves, rather than trust it with\r\ndomestics. To do it properly, provide the following things:--An old\r\nwaiter, to hold all the articles used; a lamp-filler, with a spout,\r\nsmall at the end, and turned up to prevent oil from dripping; a ball of\r\nwickyarn, and a basket to hold it; a lamp-trimmer, made for the purpose,\r\nor a pair of _sharp_ scissors; a small soap-cup and soap; some pearlash,\r\nin a broad-mouthed bottle; and several soft cloths, to wash the\r\narticles, and towels, to wipe them. If every thing, after being used, is\r\ncleansed from oil, and then kept neatly, it will not be so unpleasant a\r\ntask, as it usually is, to take care of lamps.\r\n\r\nWash the shade of an astral lamp, once a week, and the glass chimney\r\noftener. Take the lamp to pieces, and cleanse it, once a month. Keep dry\r\nfingers, in trimming lamps. To raise the wick of an astral lamp, turn it\r\nto the right; to lower it, turn it to the left. Trim it, after it has\r\nbeen once used; and, in lighting it, raise it to the proper height, as\r\nsoon as may be, or it will either smoke, or form a crust. Renew the\r\nwick, when only an inch and a half long. Close-woven wicks are better\r\nthan those which are loose. Dipping wicks in vinegar, makes them burn\r\nclearer than they otherwise would. Plain shades do not injure the eyes,\r\nlike cut ones; and prints and pictures appear better by them, than by\r\nthe others. Lamps should be lighted with a strip of folded or rolled\r\npaper, kept on the mantelpiece. Weak eyes should always be shaded from\r\nthe lights. Small screens, made for the purpose, should be kept at hand.\r\nA person with weak eyes, can use them, safely, much longer, when they\r\nare shaded from the glare of the light, than if they are not so. Fill\r\nthe entry-lamp, every day, and cleanse and fill night-lanterns, twice a\r\nweek, if used often. Provide small, one-wicked lamps, to carry about;\r\nand broad-bottomed lamps, for the kitchen, as these are not easily\r\nupset.\r\n\r\nA good night-lamp is made, with a small one-wicked lamp and a roll of\r\ntin to set over it. Have some holes made in the bottom of this cover,\r\nand it can then be used to heat articles. Very cheap floating tapers,\r\ncan be bought, to burn in a teacup of oil through the night.\r\n\r\nWickyarn, drawn repeatedly through melted wax, till stiff and smooth,\r\nmakes a good taper, for use in sealing letters. It can be twined in\r\nfanciful forms, and kept on the writing-table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To make Candles._\r\n\r\nThe nicest candles, are run in moulds. For this purpose, melt together\r\none quarter of a pound of white wax, one quarter of an ounce of camphor,\r\ntwo ounces of alum, and ten ounces of suet or mutton tallow. Soak the\r\nwicks, in lime-water and saltpetre, and, when dry, fix them in the\r\nmoulds, and pour in the melted tallow. Let them remain one night, to\r\ncool, then warm them, a little, to loosen them, draw them out, and, when\r\nhard, put them in a box, in a dry and cool place.\r\n\r\nTo make dipped candles, cut the wicks of the right length, double them\r\nover rods, and twist them. They should first be dipped in lime-water, or\r\nvinegar, and dried. Melt the tallow in a large kettle, filling it to\r\nthe top with hot water, when the tallow is melted. Put in wax, and\r\npowdered alum, to harden them. Keep the tallow hot, over a portable\r\nfurnace, and fill up the kettle, with hot water, as fast as the tallow\r\nis used up. Lay two long strips of narrow board, on which to hang the\r\nrods; and set flat pans under, on the floor, to catch the grease. Take\r\nseveral rods at once, and wet the wicks in the tallow; and, when cool,\r\nstraighten and smooth them. Then dip them, as fast as they cool, until\r\nthey become of the proper size. Plunge them obliquely, and not\r\nperpendicularly; and when the bottoms are too large, hold them in the\r\nhot grease, till a part melts off. Let them remain one night, to cool;\r\nthen cut off the bottoms, and keep them in a dry, cool place. Cheap\r\nlights are made, by dipping rushes in tallow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nON WASHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, which tends more effectually to secure good washing,\r\nthan a full supply of all conveniences; and among these, none is more\r\nimportant, than an abundance of warm and cold water: but, if this be\r\nobtained, and heated, at a great expense of time and labor, it will be\r\nused in stinted measure. The accommodations described on page 275, (Fig.\r\n34,) are very convenient in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Articles to be provided for Washing._\r\n\r\nA plenty of soft water is a very important item. When this cannot be\r\nhad, ley or soda can be put in hard water, to soften it; care being used\r\nnot to put in so much, as to injure the hands and clothes. Two\r\nwash-forms are needed; one for the two tubs in which to put the suds,\r\nand the other for blueing and starching-tubs. Four tubs, of different\r\nsizes, are necessary; also, a large _wooden_ dipper, (as metal is apt\r\nto rust;) two or three pails; a grooved wash-board; a clothes-line,\r\n(sea-grass, or horse-hair is best;) a wash-stick to move clothes, when\r\nboiling, and a wooden fork to take them out. Soap-dishes, made to hook\r\non the tubs, save soap and time. Provide, also, a clothes-bag, in which\r\nto boil clothes; an indigo-bag, of double flannel; a starch-strainer, of\r\ncoarse linen; a bottle of ox-gall for calicoes; a supply of starch,\r\nneither sour nor musty; several dozens of clothes-pins, which are cleft\r\nsticks, used to fasten clothes on the line; a bottle of dissolved gum\r\nArabic; two clothes-baskets; and a brass or copper kettle, for boiling\r\nclothes, as iron is apt to rust. A closet, for keeping all these things,\r\nis a great convenience. It may be made six feet high, three feet deep,\r\nand four feet wide. The tubs and pails can be set on the bottom of this,\r\non their sides, one within another. Four feet from the bottom, have a\r\nshelf placed, on which to put the basket of clothes-pins, the line,\r\nsoap-dishes, dipper, and clothes-fork. Above this, have another shelf,\r\nfor the bottles, boxes, &c. The shelves should reach out only half way\r\nfrom the back, and nails should be put at the sides, for hanging the\r\nwash-stick, clothes-bag, starch-bag, and indigo-bag. The\r\nironing-conveniences might be kept in the same closet, by having the\r\nlower shelf raised a little, and putting a deep drawer under it, to hold\r\nthe ironing-sheets, holders, &c. A lock and key should be put on the\r\ncloset. If the mistress of the family requests the washerwoman to notify\r\nher, when she is through, and then ascertains if all these articles are\r\nput in their places, it will prove useful. Tubs, pails, and all hooped\r\nwooden ware, should be kept out of the sun, and in a cool place, or they\r\nwill fall to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Common Mode of Washing._\r\n\r\nAssort the clothes, and put them in soak, the night before. Never pour\r\nhot water on them, as it sets the dirt. In assorting clothes, put the\r\nflannels in one lot, the colored clothes in another, the coarse white\r\nones in a third, and the fine clothes in a fourth lot. Wash the fine\r\nclothes in one tub of suds; and throw them, when wrung, into another.\r\nThen wash them, in the second suds, turning them wrong side out. Put\r\nthem in the boiling-bag, and boil them in strong suds, for half an hour,\r\nand not much more. Move them, while boiling, with the clothes-stick.\r\nTake them out of the boiling-bag, and put them into a tub of water, and\r\nrub the dirtiest places, again, if need be. Throw them into the\r\nrinsing-water, and then wring them out, and put them into the\r\nblueing-water. Put the articles to be stiffened, into a clothes-basket,\r\nby themselves, and, just before hanging out, dip them in starch,\r\nclapping it in, so as to have them equally stiff, in all parts. Hang\r\nwhite clothes in the sun, and colored ones, (wrong side out,) in the\r\nshade. Fasten them with clothes-pins. Then wash the coarser white\r\narticles, in the same manner. Then wash the colored clothes. These must\r\nnot be soaked, nor have ley or soda put in the water, and they ought not\r\nto lie wet long before hanging out, as it injures their colors.\r\nBeef's-gall, one spoonful to two pailfuls of suds, improves calicoes.\r\nLastly, wash the flannels, in suds as hot as the hand can bear. Never\r\nrub on soap, as this shrinks them in spots. Wring them out of the first\r\nsuds, and throw them into another tub of hot suds, turning them wrong\r\nside out. Then throw them into hot blueing-water. Do not put blueing\r\ninto suds, as it makes specks in the flannel. Never leave flannels long\r\nin water, nor put them in cold or lukewarm water. Before hanging them\r\nout, shake and stretch them. Some housekeepers have a close closet, made\r\nwith slats across the top. On these slats, they put their flannels, when\r\nready to hang out, and then burn brimstone under them, for ten minutes.\r\nIt is but little trouble, and keeps the flannels as white as new. Wash\r\nthe colored flannels, and hose, after the white, adding more hot water.\r\nSome persons dry woollen hose on stocking-boards, shaped like a foot and\r\nleg, with strings to tie them on the line. This keeps them from\r\nshrinking, and makes them look better than if ironed. It is also less\r\nwork, than to iron them properly.\r\n\r\nBedding should be washed in long days, and in hot weather. Pound\r\nblankets in two different tubs or barrels of hot suds, first well mixing\r\nthe soap and water. Rinse in hot suds; and, after wringing, let two\r\npersons shake them thoroughly, and then hang them out. If not dry, at\r\nnight, fold them, and hang them out the next morning. Bedquilts should\r\nbe pounded in warm suds; and, after rinsing, be wrung as dry as\r\npossible. Bolsters and pillows can be pounded in hot suds, without\r\ntaking out the feathers, rinsing them in fair water. It is usually best,\r\nhowever, for nice feathers, to take them out, wash them, and dry them on\r\na garret floor. Cotton comforters should have the cases taken off and\r\nwashed. Wash bedticks, after the feathers are removed, like other\r\nthings. Empty straw beds once a year.\r\n\r\nThe following cautions, in regard to calicoes, are useful. Never wash\r\nthem in very warm water; and change the water, when it appears dingy, or\r\nthe light parts will look dirty. Never rub on soap; but remove grease\r\nwith French chalk, starch, magnesia, or Wilmington clay. Make starch for\r\nthem, with coffee-water, to prevent any whitish appearance. Glue is good\r\nfor stiffening calicoes. When laid aside, not to be used, all stiffening\r\nshould be washed out, or they will often be injured. Never let calicoes\r\nfreeze, in drying. Some persons use bran-water, (four quarts of\r\nwheat-bran to two pails of water,) and no soap, for calicoes; washing\r\nand rinsing in the bran-water. Potato-water is equally good. Take eight\r\npeeled and grated potatoes to one gallon of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soda-Washing._\r\n\r\nA very great saving in labor is secured, by _soda-washing_. There have\r\nbeen mistakes made in receipts, and in modes of doing it, which have\r\ncaused a prejudice against it; but if the soap be rightly made, and\r\nrightly used, _it certainly saves one half the labor and time of\r\nordinary washing_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Receipt for Soda-Soap._\r\n\r\nTake eight pounds of bar-soap, eight pounds of coarse soda, (the\r\nsub-carbonate,) ten gallons of soft water, boiled two hours, stirring it\r\noften. This is to be cooled, and set away for use. In washing, take a\r\npound of this soap, to the largest pail of water, and heat till it\r\nboils. Having previously soaked the white clothes, in _warm_, not _hot_,\r\nwater, put them in this boiling mixture, and let them boil _one hour and\r\nno more_. Take them out, draining them well, and put them in a tub, half\r\nfull of soft water. Turn them wrong side out; rub the soiled places,\r\ntill they look clean; then put them into blue rinsing-water, and wring\r\nthem out. They are then ready to hang out. Some persons use another\r\nrinsing-water. The colored clothes and flannels must not be washed in\r\nthis way. The fine clothes may be first boiled in this water; it may\r\nthen be used for coarser clothes; and afterward, the brown towels, and\r\nother articles of that nature, may be boiled in the same water. After\r\nthis, the water which remains, is still useful, for washing floors; and\r\nthen, the suds is a good manure to put around plants.\r\n\r\nIt is best to prepare, at once, the whole quantity of water to be used.\r\nTake out about one third, and set it by; and every time a fresh supply\r\nof clothes is put in, use a portion of this, to supply the waste of a\r\nformer boiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modes of Washing Various Articles._\r\n\r\n_Brown Linens_, or _Muslins_, of tea, drab, or olive, colors, look best,\r\nwashed in hay-water. Put in hay enough, to color the water like new\r\nbrown linen. Wash them first in lukewarm, fair water, without soap,\r\n(removing grease with French chalk,) then wash and rinse them in the\r\nhay-water.\r\n\r\n_Nankeens_ look best, washed in suds, with a teacup of ley added for\r\neach pailful. Iron on the wrong side. Soak new nankeens in ley, for one\r\nnight, and it sets the color perfectly.\r\n\r\n_Woollen Table-Covers_ and _Woollen Shawls_, may be washed thus: Remove\r\ngrease as before directed. If there be stains in the articles, take them\r\nout with spirits of hartshorn. Wash the things in two portions of hot\r\nsuds, made of white soap. Do not wring them, but fold them and press the\r\nwater out, catching it in a tub, under a table. Shake, stretch, and dry,\r\nneither by the sun nor a fire, and do not let them freeze, in drying.\r\nSprinkle them three hours before ironing, and fold and roll them tight.\r\nIron them heavily on the wrong side. _Woollen yarn_, should be washed in\r\nvery hot water, putting in a teacupful of ley, and no soap, to half a\r\npailful of water. Rinse till the water comes off clear.\r\n\r\n_New Black Worsted and Woollen Hose_, should be soaked all night, and\r\nwashed in hot suds, with beef's-gall, a tablespoonful to half a pail of\r\nwater. Rinse till no color comes out. Iron on the wrong side.\r\n\r\n_To Cleanse Gentlemen's Broadcloths._ The common mode, is, to shake, and\r\nbrush the articles, and rip out linings and pockets; then to wash them\r\nin strong suds, adding a teacupful of ley, using white soap for light\r\ncloth; rolling and then pressing, instead of wringing, them; when dry,\r\nsprinkling them, and letting them lie all night; and ironing on the\r\nwrong side, or with a thin dark cloth over the article, until\r\n_perfectly_ dry. But a far better way, which the writer has repeatedly\r\ntried, with unfailing success, is the following: Take one beef's-gall,\r\nhalf a pound of salaeratus, and four gallons of warm water. Lay the\r\narticle on a table, and scour it thoroughly, in every part, with a\r\nclothes-brush, dipped in this mixture. The collar of a coat, and the\r\ngrease-spots, (previously marked by stitches of white thread,) must be\r\nrepeatedly brushed. Then, take the article, and rinse it up and down in\r\nthe mixture. Then, rinse it up and down in a tub of soft cold water.\r\nThen, without wringing or pressing, hang it to drain and dry. Fasten a\r\ncoat up by the collar. When perfectly dry, it is sometimes the case,\r\nwith coats, that nothing more is needed. In other cases, it is necessary\r\nto dampen the parts, which look wrinkled, with a sponge, and either pull\r\nthem smooth, with the fingers, or press them with an iron, having a\r\npiece of bombazine, or thin woollen cloth, between the iron and the\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To manufacture Ley, Soap, Starch, and other Articles used in Washing._\r\n\r\n_To make Ley._ Provide a large tub, made of pine or ash, and set it on a\r\nform, so high, that a tub can stand under it. Make a hole, an inch in\r\ndiameter, near the bottom, on one side. Lay bricks, inside, about this\r\nhole, and straw over them. To every seven bushels of ashes, add two\r\ngallons of unslacked lime, and throw in the ashes and lime in alternate\r\nlayers. While putting in the ashes and lime, pour on boiling water,\r\nusing three or four pailfuls. After this, add a pailful of cold soft\r\nwater, once an hour, till all the ashes appear to be well soaked. Catch\r\nthe drippings, in a tub, and try its strength with an egg. If the egg\r\nrise so as to show a circle as large as a ten cent piece, the strength\r\nis right; if it rise higher, the ley must be weakened by water; if not\r\nso high, the ashes are not good, and the whole process must be repeated,\r\nputting in fresh ashes, and running the weak ley through the new ashes,\r\nwith some additional water. _Quick-ley_ is made by pouring one gallon of\r\nboiling soft water on three quarts of ashes, and straining it. Oak ashes\r\nare best.\r\n\r\n_To make Soft-Soap._ Save all drippings and fat, melt them, and set them\r\naway, in cakes. Some persons keep, for soap-grease, a half barrel, with\r\nweak ley in it, and a cover over it. To make soft-soap, take the\r\nproportion of one pailful of ley to three pounds of fat. Melt the fat,\r\nand pour in the ley, by degrees. Boil it steadily, through the day, till\r\nit is ropy. If not boiled enough, on cooling, it will turn to ley and\r\nsediment. While boiling, there should always be a little oil on the\r\nsurface. If this does not appear, add more grease. If there is too much\r\ngrease, on cooling, it will rise, and can be skimmed off. Try it, by\r\ncooling a small quantity. When it appears like gelly, on becoming cold,\r\nit is done. It must then be put in a cool place and often stirred.\r\n\r\n_To make cold Soft-Soap_, melt thirty pounds of grease, put it in a\r\nbarrel, add four pailfuls of strong ley, and stir it up thoroughly. Then\r\ngradually add more ley, till the barrel is nearly full, and the soap\r\nlooks _about right_.\r\n\r\n_To make Potash-Soap_, melt thirty-nine pounds of grease, and put it in\r\na barrel. Take twenty-nine pounds of light ash-colored potash, (the\r\n_reddish_-colored will spoil the soap,) and pour hot water on it; then\r\npour it off into the grease, stirring it well. Continue thus, till all\r\nthe potash is melted. Add one pailful of cold water, stirring it a great\r\ndeal, every day, till the barrel be full, and then it is done. This is\r\nthe cheapest and best kind of soap. It is best to sell ashes and buy\r\npotash. The soap is better, if it stand a year before it is used;\r\ntherefore make two barrels at once.\r\n\r\n_To make Hard White Soap_, take fifteen pounds of lard, or suet; and,\r\nwhen boiling, add, slowly, five gallons of ley, mixed with one gallon of\r\nwater. Cool a small portion; and, if no grease rise, it is done: if\r\ngrease do rise, add ley, and boil till no grease rises. Then add three\r\nquarts of fine salt, and boil it; if this do not harden well, on\r\ncooling, add more salt. Cool it, and if it is to be perfumed, melt it\r\nnext day, put in the perfume, and then run it in moulds, or cut it in\r\ncakes. _Common Hard Soap_, is made in the same way, by using common fat.\r\n\r\n_To manufacture Starch_, cleanse a peck of unground wheat, and soak it,\r\nfor several days, in soft water. When quite soft, remove the husks, with\r\nthe hand, and the soft parts will settle. Pour off the water, and\r\nreplace it, every day, with that which is fresh, stirring it well. When,\r\nafter stirring and settling, the water is clear, it is done. Then\r\nstrain off the water, and dry the starch, for several days, in the sun.\r\nIf the water be permitted to remain too long, it sours, and the starch\r\nis poor. If the starch be not well dried, it grows musty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nON STARCHING, IRONING, AND CLEANSING.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To prepare Starch._ Take four tablespoonfuls of starch; put in as much\r\nwater; and rub it, till all lumps are removed. Then, add half a cup of\r\ncold water. Pour this into a quart of boiling water, and boil it for\r\nhalf an hour, adding a piece of spermaceti, or a lump of salt, or sugar,\r\nas large as a hazelnut. Strain it, and put in a very little blueing.\r\nThin it with hot water.\r\n\r\n_Glue and Gum-Starch._ Put a piece of glue, four inches square, into\r\nthree quarts of water, boil it, and keep it in a bottle, corked up.\r\nDissolve four ounces of gum Arabic, in a quart of hot water, and set it\r\naway, in a bottle, corked. Use the glue for calicoes, and the gum for\r\nsilks and muslins, both to be mixed with water, at discretion.\r\n\r\n_Beef's-Gall._ Send a junk-bottle to the butcher, and have several\r\ngall-bladders emptied into it. Keep it salted, and in a cool place. Some\r\npersons perfume it; but fresh air removes the unpleasant smell which it\r\ngives, when used for clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Directions for Starching Muslins and Laces._\r\n\r\nMany ladies clap muslins, then dry them, and afterwards sprinkle them.\r\nThis saves time. Others clap them, till nearly dry, then fold and cover,\r\nand then iron them. Iron wrought muslins on soft flannel, and on the\r\nwrong side.\r\n\r\n_To do up Laces, nicely_, sew a clean piece of muslin around a long\r\nbottle, and roll the lace on it; pulling out the edge, and rolling it\r\nso that the edge will turn in, and be covered, as you roll. Fill the\r\nbottle with water, and then boil it, for an hour, in a suds made with\r\nwhite soap. Rinse it in fair water, a little blued; dry it in the sun;\r\nand, if any stiffening is wished, use thin starch, or gum Arabic. When\r\ndry, fold and press it, between white papers, in a large book. It\r\nimproves the lace, to wet it with sweet-oil, after it is rolled on the\r\nbottle, and before boiling in the suds. _Blond laces_ can be whitened,\r\nby rolling them on a bottle, in this way, and then setting the bottle in\r\nthe sun, in a dish of cold suds made with white soap, wetting it\r\nthoroughly, and changing the suds, every day. Do this, for a week or\r\nmore; then rinse, in fair water; dry it on the bottle, in the sun; and\r\nstiffen it with white gum Arabic. Lay it away in loose folds. _Lace\r\nveils_ can be whitened, by laying them in flat dishes, in suds made with\r\nwhite soap; then rinsing, and stiffening them with gum Arabic,\r\nstretching them, and pinning them on a sheet, to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nON IRONING.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Articles to be provided for Ironing._\r\n\r\nA settee, or settle, made so that it can be used for an ironing-table,\r\nis a great convenience. It may be made of pine, and of the following\r\ndimensions: length, five feet and six inches; width of the seat, one\r\nfoot and nine inches; height of the seat, one foot and three inches;\r\nheight of the sides, (or arms of the seat,) two feet and four inches;\r\nheight of the back, five feet and three inches. The back should be made\r\nwith hinges, of the height of the sides or arms, so that it can be\r\nturned down, and rest on them, and thus become an ironing-table. The\r\nback is to be fastened up, behind, with long iron hooks and staples. The\r\nseat should be made with two lids, opening into two boxes, or\r\npartitions, in one of which, can be kept the ironing-sheets and holders,\r\nand in the other, the other articles used in ironing. It can be stained\r\nof a cherry-color; put on casters, so as to move easily; and be\r\nprovided with two cushions, stuffed with hay and covered with dark\r\nwoollen. It thus serves as a comfortable seat, for Winter, protecting\r\nthe back from cold.\r\n\r\nWhere a settee, of this description, is not provided, a large\r\nironing-board, made so as not to warp, should be kept, and used only for\r\nthis purpose, to be laid, when used, on a table. Provide, also, the\r\nfollowing articles: A woollen ironing-blanket, and a linen or cotton\r\nsheet, to spread over it; a large fire, of charcoal and hard wood,\r\n(unless furnaces or stoves are used;) a hearth, free from cinders and\r\nashes, a piece of sheet-iron, in front of the fire, on which to set the\r\nirons, while heating; (this last saves many black spots from careless\r\nironers;) three or four holders, made of woollen, and covered with old\r\nsilk, as these do not easily take fire; two iron rings, or iron-stands,\r\non which to set the irons, and small pieces of board to put under them,\r\nto prevent scorching the sheet; linen or cotton wipers; and a piece of\r\nbeeswax, to rub on the irons when they are smoked. There should be, at\r\nleast, three irons for each person ironing, and a small and large\r\nclothes-frame, on which to air the fine and coarse clothes.\r\n\r\nA bosom-board, on which to iron shirt-bosoms, should be made, one foot\r\nand a half long, and nine inches wide, and covered with white flannel. A\r\nskirt-board on which to iron frock-skirts, should be made, five feet\r\nlong, and two feet wide at one end, tapering to one foot and three\r\ninches wide, at the other end. This should be covered with flannel; and\r\nwill save much trouble, in ironing nice dresses. The large end may be\r\nput on the table, and the other, on the back of a chair. Both these\r\nboards should have cotton covers, made to fit them; and these should be\r\nchanged and washed, when dirty. These boards are often useful, when\r\narticles are to be ironed or pressed, in a chamber or parlor. Provide,\r\nalso, a press-board, for broadcloth, two feet long, and four inches wide\r\nat one end, tapering to three inches wide, at the other.\r\n\r\nA fluting-iron, called, also, a patent Italian iron, saves much labor,\r\nin ironing ruffles neatly. A crimping-iron, will crimp ruffles\r\nbeautifully, with very little time or trouble. Care must be used, with\r\nthe latter, or it will cut the ruffles. A trial should be made, with old\r\nmuslins; and, when the iron is screwed in the right place, it must be so\r\nkept, and not altered without leave from the housekeeper. If the lady of\r\nthe house will provide all these articles, see that the fires are\r\nproperly made, the ironing-sheets evenly put on and properly pinned, the\r\nclothes-frames dusted, and all articles kept in their places, she will\r\ndo much towards securing good ironing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Sprinkling, Folding, and Ironing._\r\n\r\nWipe the dust from the ironing-board, and lay it down, to receive the\r\nclothes, which should be sprinkled with clear water, and laid in\r\nseparate piles, one of colored, one of common, and one of fine articles,\r\nand one of flannels. Fold the fine things, and roll them in a towel, and\r\nthen fold the rest, turning them all right side outward. The colored\r\nclothes should be laid separate from the rest, and ought not to lie long\r\ndamp, as it injures the colors. The sheets and table linen should be\r\nshaken, stretched, and folded, by two persons. Iron lace and needlework\r\non the wrong side, and carry them away, as soon as dry. Iron calicoes\r\nwith irons which are not very hot, and generally on the right side, as\r\nthey thus keep clean for a longer time. In ironing a frock, first do the\r\nwaist, then the sleeves, then the skirt. Keep the skirt rolled, while\r\nironing the other parts, and set a chair, to hold the sleeves, while\r\nironing the skirt, unless a skirt-board be used. In ironing a shirt,\r\nfirst do the back, then the sleeves, then the collar and bosom, and then\r\nthe front. Iron silk on the wrong side, when quite damp, with an iron\r\nwhich is not very hot. Light colors are apt to change and fade. Iron\r\nvelvet, by turning up the face of the iron, and after dampening the\r\nwrong side of the velvet, draw it over the face of the iron, holding it\r\nstraight, and not biased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nON WHITENING, CLEANSING, AND DYEING.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Whiten Articles, and Remove Stains from them._\r\n\r\nWet white clothes in suds, and lay them on the grass, in the sun. Lay\r\nmuslins in suds made with white soap, in a flat dish; set this in the\r\nsun, changing the suds, every day. Whiten tow-cloth, or brown linen, by\r\nkeeping it in ley, through the night, laying it out in the sun, and\r\nwetting it with fair water, as fast as it dries.\r\n\r\nScorched articles can often be whitened again, by laying them in the\r\nsun, wet with suds. Where this does not answer, put a pound of white\r\nsoap in a gallon of milk, and boil the article in it. Another method,\r\nis, to chop and extract the juice from two onions, and boil this with\r\nhalf a pint of vinegar, an ounce of white soap, and two ounces of\r\nfuller's earth. Spread this, when cool, on the scorched part, and, when\r\ndry, wash it off, in fair water. _Mildew_ may be removed, by dipping the\r\narticle in sour buttermilk, laying it in the sun, and, after it is\r\nwhite, rinsing it in fair water. Soap and chalk are also good; also,\r\nsoap and starch, adding half as much salt as there is starch, together\r\nwith the juice of a lemon. Stains in linen can often be removed, by\r\nrubbing on soft soap, then putting on a starch paste, and drying in the\r\nsun, renewing it several times. Wash off all the soap and starch, in\r\ncold, fair water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mixtures for Removing Stains and Grease._\r\n\r\n_Stain-Mixture._ Half an ounce of oxalic acid, in a pint of soft water.\r\nThis can be kept in a corked bottle, and is infallible in removing\r\niron-rust, and ink-stains. It is very poisonous. The article must be\r\nspread with this mixture over the steam of hot water, and wet several\r\ntimes. This will also remove indelible ink. The article must be washed,\r\nor the mixture will injure it.\r\n\r\n_Another Stain-Mixture_ is made, by mixing one ounce of sal ammoniac,\r\none ounce of salt of tartar, and one pint of soft water.\r\n\r\n_To remove Grease._ Mix four ounces of fuller's earth, half an ounce of\r\npearlash, and lemon-juice enough to make a stiff paste, which can be\r\ndried in balls, and kept for use. Wet the greased spot with cold water,\r\nrub it with the ball, dry it, and then rinse it with fair cold water.\r\nThis is for _white_ articles. For silks, and worsteds, use French chalk,\r\nwhich can be procured of the apothecaries. That which is soft and white,\r\nis best. Scrape it on the greased spot, and let it lie for a day and\r\nnight. Then renew it, till the spot disappears. Wilmington clay-balls,\r\nare equally good. Ink-spots can often be removed from white clothes, by\r\nrubbing on common tallow, leaving it for a day or two, and then washing,\r\nas usual. Grease can be taken out of wall-paper, by making a paste of\r\npotter's clay, water and ox-gall, and spreading it on the paper. When\r\ndry, renew it, till the spot disappears.\r\n\r\nStains on floors, from _soot_, or _stove-pipes_, can be removed, by\r\nwashing the spot in sulphuric acid and water. Stains, in colored silk\r\ndresses, can often be removed, by pure water. Those made by acids, tea,\r\nwine, and fruits, can often be removed, by spirits of hartshorn, diluted\r\nwith an equal quantity of water. Sometimes, it must be repeated, several\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n_Tar_, _Pitch_, and _Turpentine_, can be removed, by putting the spot in\r\nsweet-oil, or by spreading tallow on it, and letting it remain for\r\ntwenty-four hours. Then, if the article be linen or cotton, wash it, as\r\nusual; if it be silk or worsted, rub it with ether, or spirits of wine.\r\n\r\n_Lamp-Oil_ can be removed, from floors, carpets, and other articles, by\r\nspreading upon the stain a paste, made of fuller's earth or potter's\r\nclay, and renewing it, when dry, till the stain is removed. If gall be\r\nput into the paste, it will preserve the colors from injury. When the\r\nstain has been removed, carefully brush off the paste, with a soft\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\n_Oil-Paint_ can be removed, by rubbing it with _very pure_ spirits of\r\nturpentine. The impure spirit leaves a grease-spot. _Wax_ can be\r\nremoved, by scraping it off, and then holding a red-hot poker near the\r\nspot. _Spermaceti_ may be removed by scraping it off, then putting a\r\npaper over the spot, and applying a warm iron. If this does not answer,\r\nrub on spirits of wine.\r\n\r\n_Ink-Stains_, in carpets and woollen table-covers, can be removed, by\r\nwashing the spot in a liquid, composed of one teaspoonful of oxalic acid\r\ndissolved in a teacupful of warm (not hot) water, and then rinsing in\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\n_Stains on Varnished Articles_, which are caused by cups of hot water,\r\ncan be removed, by rubbing them with lamp-oil, and then with alcohol.\r\nInk-stains can be taken out of mahogany, by one teaspoonful of oil of\r\nvitriol mixed with one tablespoonful of water, or by oxalic acid and\r\nwater. These must be brushed over quickly, and then washed off with\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cleansing Various Articles._\r\n\r\n_Silk Handkerchiefs_ and _Ribands_ can be cleansed, by using French\r\nchalk to take out the grease, and then sponging them, on both sides,\r\nwith lukewarm fair water. Stiffen them with gum Arabic, and press them\r\nbetween white paper, with an iron not very hot. A tablespoonful of\r\nspirits of wine to three quarts of water, improves it.\r\n\r\n_Silk Hose_, or _Silk Gloves_, should be washed in warm suds made with\r\nwhite soap, and rinsed in cold water; they should then be stretched and\r\nrubbed, with a hard-rolled flannel, till they are quite dry. Ironing\r\nthem, very much injures their looks. _Washleather_ articles should have\r\nthe grease removed from them, by French chalk, or magnesia; they should\r\nthen be washed in warm suds, and rinsed in cold water. _White Kid\r\nGloves_ should have the grease removed from them, as above directed.\r\nThey should then be brushed, with a soft brush, and a mixture of\r\nfuller's earth and magnesia. In an hour after, rub them with flannel,\r\ndipped in bran and powdered whiting. _Colored or Hoskin's gloves_ can be\r\ncleansed, very nicely, by _pure_ spirits of turpentine, put on with a\r\nwoollen cloth, and rubbed from wrist to fingers. Hang them for several\r\ndays in the air, and all the unpleasant smell will be removed.\r\n_Gentlemen's white gloves_ should be washed with a sponge, in\r\nwhite-soapsuds; then wiped, and dried on the hands. _Swan's-down\r\ntippets, and capes_, should be washed in white-soapsuds, squeezing, and\r\nnot rubbing them; then rinse them in two waters, and shake and stretch\r\nthem while drying. _Ostrich feathers_ can also be thus washed. Stiffen\r\nthem, with starch, wet in cold water and not boiled. Shake them in the\r\nair, till nearly dry, then hold them before the fire, and curl them with\r\ndull scissors, giving each fibre a twitch, turning it inward, and\r\nholding it so for a moment.\r\n\r\n_Straw and Leghorn Hats_, can be cleansed, by simply washing them in\r\nwhite-soapsuds. Remove grease, by French chalk, and stains, by diluted\r\noxalic acid, or cream of tartar. The oxalic acid is best, but must be\r\ninstantly washed off. _To whiten them_, drive nails in a barrel, near\r\nits bottom, so that cords can be stretched across. On these cords, tie\r\nthe bonnet, wet with suds, (having first removed the grease, stains, and\r\ndirt.) Then invert the barrel, over a dish of coals, on which roll\r\nbrimstone is slowly burning. Put a chip under one side of the barrel, to\r\nadmit the air. Continue this, till the bonnet is white; then hang it in\r\nthe air, (when the weather is not damp,) till the smell is removed. Then\r\nstiffen it with a solution of isinglass or gum Arabic, put on the\r\ninside, with a sponge. Press the crown, on a block, and the rest on a\r\nboard, on the right side, putting muslin between the iron and straw, and\r\npressing hard. Be careful not to make it too stiff. First, stiffen a\r\nsmall piece, for trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nON COLORING.\r\n\r\n_Precautions and Preparations._\r\n\r\nAll the articles must be entirely free from grease or oil, and also, in\r\nmost cases, from soapsuds. Make light dyes in brass, and dark ones in\r\niron, vessels. Always wet the articles, in fair water, before dyeing.\r\nAlways carefully strain the dye. If the color be too light, dry and then\r\ndip the article again. Stir the article well in the dye, lifting it up\r\noften. Remove any previous color, by boiling in suds, or, what is\r\nbetter, in the soda mixture used for washing.\r\n\r\n_Pink Dye._ Buy a saucer of carmine, at an apothecary's. With it, you\r\nwill find directions for its use. This is cheap, easy to use, and\r\nbeautiful. _Balm blossoms_ and _Bergamot blossoms_, with a little cream\r\nof tartar in the water, make a pretty pink.\r\n\r\n_Red Dye._ Take half a pound of wheat bran, three ounces of powdered\r\nalum, and two gallons of soft water. Boil these in a brass vessel, and\r\nadd an ounce of cream of tartar, and an ounce of cochineal, tied up\r\ntogether in a bag. Boil the mixture for fifteen minutes, then strain it,\r\nand dip the articles. Brazil wood, set with alum, makes another red dye.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Dye._ Fustic, turmeric powder, saffron, barberry-bush,\r\npeach-leaves, or marigold flowers, make a yellow dye. Set the dye with\r\nalum, putting a piece the size of a large hazelnut to each quart of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Light Blue Dye_, for silks and woollens, is made with the 'blue\r\ncomposition,' to be procured of the hat-makers; fifteen drops to a quart\r\nof water. Articles dipped in this, must be thoroughly rinsed. For a\r\n_dark blue_, boil four ounces of copperas in two gallons of water. Dip\r\nthe articles in this, and then in a strong decoction of logwood, boiled\r\nand strained. Then wash them thoroughly in soapsuds.\r\n\r\n_Green Dye._ First color the article yellow; and then, if it be silk or\r\nwoollen, dip it in 'blue composition.' Instead of ironing, rub it with\r\nflannel, while drying.\r\n\r\n_Salmon Color_ is made by boiling arnotto or anotta in soapsuds.\r\n\r\n_Buff Color_ is made by putting one teacupful of potash, tied in a bag,\r\nin two gallons of hot (not boiling) water, and adding an ounce of\r\narnotto, also in a bag, keeping it in for half an hour. First, wet the\r\narticle in strong potash-water. Dry and then rinse in soapsuds. Birch\r\nbark and alum also make a buff. Black alder, set with ley, makes an\r\norange color.\r\n\r\n_Dove and Slate Colors_, of all shades, are made by boiling, in an iron\r\nvessel, a teacupful of black tea, with a teaspoonful of copperas. Dilute\r\nthis, till you get the shade wanted. Purple sugar-paper, boiled, and set\r\nwith alum, makes a similar color.\r\n\r\n_Brown Dye._ Boil half a pound of camwood (in a bag) in two gallons of\r\nwater, for fifteen minutes. Wet the articles, and boil them for a few\r\nminutes in the dye. White-walnut bark, the bark of sour sumach, or of\r\nwhite maple, set with alum, make a brown color.\r\n\r\n_Black Dye._ Let one pound of chopped logwood remain all night in one\r\ngallon of vinegar. Then boil them, and put in a piece of copperas, as\r\nlarge as a hen's egg. Wet the articles in warm water, and put them in\r\nthe dye, boiling and stirring them for fifteen minutes. Dry them, then\r\nwet them in warm water, and dip them again. Repeat the process, till the\r\narticles are black enough. Wash them in suds, and rinse them till the\r\nwater comes off clear. Iron nails, boiled in vinegar, make a black dye,\r\nwhich is good for restoring rusty black silks.\r\n\r\n_Olive Color._ Boil fustic and yellow-oak bark together. The more\r\nfustic, the brighter the olive; the more oak bark, the darker the shade.\r\nSet the light shade with a few drops of oil of vitriol, and the dark\r\nshade with copperas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF PARLORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn selecting the furniture of parlors, some reference should be had to\r\ncorrespondence of shades and colors. Curtains should be darker than the\r\nwalls; and, if the walls and carpets be light, the chairs should be\r\ndark, and _vice versa_. Pictures always look best on light walls.\r\n\r\nIn selecting carpets, for rooms much used, it is poor economy to buy\r\ncheap ones. _Ingrain_ carpets, of close texture, and the _three-ply_\r\ncarpets, are best for common use. _Brussels_ carpets do not wear so long\r\nas the three-ply ones, because they cannot be turned. _Wilton_ carpets\r\nwear badly, and _Venetians_ are good only for halls and stairs.\r\n\r\nIn selecting colors, avoid those in which there are any black threads;\r\nas they are always rotten. The most tasteful carpets, are those, which\r\nare made of various shades of the same color, or of all shades of only\r\ntwo colors; such as brown and yellow, or blue and buff, or salmon and\r\ngreen, or all shades of green, or of brown. All very dark shades should\r\nbe brown or green, but not black.\r\n\r\nIn laying down carpets, it is a bad practice to put straw under them, as\r\nthis makes them wear out in spots. Straw matting, laid under carpets,\r\nmakes them last much longer, as it is smooth and even, and the dust\r\nsifts through it. In buying carpets, always get a few yards over, to\r\nallow for waste in matching figures.\r\n\r\nIn cutting carpets, make them three or four inches shorter than the\r\nroom, to allow for stretching. Begin to cut _in the middle_ of a figure,\r\nand it will usually match better. Many carpets match in two different\r\nways, and care must be taken to get the right one. Sew a carpet on the\r\nwrong side, with double waxed thread, and with the _ball-stitch_. This\r\nis done by taking a stitch on the breadth next you, pointing the needle\r\ntowards you; and then taking a stitch on the other breadth, pointing the\r\nneedle from you. Draw the thread tightly, but not so as to pucker. In\r\nfitting a breadth to the hearth, cut slits in the right place, and turn\r\nthe piece under. Bind _the whole_ of the carpet, with carpet-binding,\r\nnail it with tacks, having bits of leather under the heads. To stretch\r\nthe carpet, use a carpet-fork, which is a long stick, ending with\r\nnotched tin, like saw-teeth. This is put in the edge of the carpet, and\r\npushed by one person, while the nail is driven by another. Cover blocks,\r\nor bricks, with carpeting, like that of the room, and put them behind\r\ntables, doors, sofas, &c., to preserve the walls from injury, by\r\nknocking, or by the dusting-cloth.\r\n\r\nCheap footstools, made of a square plank, covered with tow-cloth,\r\nstuffed, and then covered with carpeting, with worsted handles, look\r\nvery well. Sweep carpets as seldom as possible, as it wears them out. To\r\nshake them often, is good economy. In cleaning carpets, use damp tea\r\nleaves, or wet Indian meal, throwing it about, and rubbing it over with\r\nthe broom. The latter, is very good for cleansing carpets made dingy by\r\ncoal-dust. In brushing carpets in ordinary use, it will be found very\r\nconvenient to use a large flat dust-pan, with a perpendicular handle a\r\nyard high, put on so that the pan will stand alone. This can be carried\r\nabout, and used without stooping, brushing dust into it with a common\r\nbroom. The pan must be very large, or it will be upset.\r\n\r\nWhen carpets are taken up, they should be hung on a line, or laid on\r\nlong grass, and whipped, first on one side, and then on the other, with\r\npliant whips. If laid aside, they should be sewed up tight, in linen,\r\nhaving snuff or tobacco put along all the crevices where moths could\r\nenter. Shaking pepper, from a pepper-box, round the edge of the floor,\r\nunder a carpet, prevents the access of moths.\r\n\r\nCarpets can be best washed on the floor, thus: First shake them; and\r\nthen, after cleaning the floor, stretch and nail them upon it. Then\r\nscrub them in cold soapsuds, having half a teacupful of ox-gall to a\r\nbucket of water. Then wash off the suds, with a cloth, in fair water.\r\nSet open the doors and windows, for two days or more. Imperial Brussels,\r\nVenetian, ingrain, and three-ply, carpets, can be washed thus; but\r\nWilton, and other plush-carpets, cannot. Before washing them, take out\r\ngrease, with a paste, made of potter's clay, ox-gall, and water.\r\n\r\nStraw matting is best for chambers and Summer parlors. The checked, of\r\ntwo colors, is not so good to wear. The best, is the cheapest in the\r\nend. When washed, it should be done with salt water, wiping it dry; but\r\nfrequent washing injures it. Bind matting with cotton binding. Sew\r\nbreadths together like carpeting. In joining the ends of pieces, ravel\r\nout a part, and tie the threads together, turning under a little of each\r\npiece, and then, laying the ends close, nail them down, with nails\r\nhaving kid under their heads.\r\n\r\nIn hanging pictures, put them so that the lower part shall be opposite\r\nthe eye. Cleanse the glass of pictures with whiting, as water endangers\r\nthe pictures. Gilt frames can be much better preserved by putting on a\r\ncoat of copal varnish, which, with proper brushes, can be bought of\r\ncarriage or cabinet-makers. When dry, it can be washed with fair water.\r\nWash the brush in spirits of turpentine.\r\n\r\nCurtains, ottomans, and sofas covered with worsted, can be cleansed, by\r\nwheat-bran, rubbed on with flannel. Dust Venetian blinds with feather\r\nbrushes. Buy light-colored ones, as the green are going out of fashion.\r\nStrips of linen or cotton, on rollers and pulleys, are much in use, to\r\nshut out the sun from curtains and carpets. Paper curtains, pasted on\r\nold cotton, are good for chambers. Put them on rollers, having cords\r\nnailed to them, so that when the curtain falls, the cord will be wound\r\nup. Then, by pulling the cord, the curtain will be rolled up.\r\n\r\nMahogany furniture should be made in the Spring, and stand some months\r\nbefore it is used, or it will shrink and warp. Varnished furniture\r\nshould be rubbed only with silk, except occasionally, when a little\r\nsweet-oil should be rubbed over, and wiped off carefully. For\r\nunvarnished furniture, use beeswax, a little softened with sweet-oil;\r\nrub it in with a hard brush, and polish with woollen and silk rags. Some\r\npersons rub in linseed-oil; others mix beeswax with a little spirits of\r\nturpentine and rosin, making it so that it can be put on with a sponge,\r\nand wiped off with a soft rag. Others, keep in a bottle the following\r\nmixture; two ounces of spirits of turpentine, four tablespoonfuls of\r\nsweet-oil, and one quart of milk. This is applied with a sponge, and\r\nwiped off with a linen rag.\r\n\r\nHearths and jambs, of brick, look best painted over with blacklead,\r\nmixed with soft-soap. Wash the bricks which are nearest the fire with\r\nredding and milk, using a painter's brush. A sheet of zinc, covering the\r\nwhole hearth, is cheap, saves work, and looks very well. A tinman can\r\nfit it properly.\r\n\r\nStone hearths should be rubbed with a paste of powdered stone, (to be\r\nprocured of the stonecutters,) and then brushed with a stiff brush.\r\nKitchen-hearths, of stone, are improved by rubbing in lamp-oil.\r\n\r\nStains can be removed from marble, by oxalic acid and water, or oil of\r\nvitriol and water, left on fifteen minutes, and then rubbed dry. Gray\r\nmarble is improved by linseed-oil. Grease can be taken from marble, by\r\nox-gall and potter's clay wet with soapsuds, (a gill of each.) It is\r\nbetter to add, also, a gill of spirits of turpentine. It improves the\r\nlooks of marble, to cover it with this mixture, leaving it two days, and\r\nthen rubbing it off.\r\n\r\nUnless a parlor is in constant use, it is best to sweep it only once a\r\nweek, and at other times use a whisk-broom and dust-pan. When a parlor\r\nwith handsome furniture is to be swept, cover the sofas, centre table,\r\npiano, books, and mantelpiece, with old cottons, kept for the purpose.\r\nRemove the rugs, and shake them, and clean the jambs, hearth, and\r\nfire-furniture. Then sweep the room, moving every article. Dust the\r\nfurniture, with a dust-brush and a piece of old silk. A painter's brush\r\nshould be kept, to remove dust from ledges and crevices. The dust-cloths\r\nshould be often shaken and washed, or else they will soil the walls and\r\nfurniture when they are used. Dust ornaments, and fine books, with\r\nfeather brushes, kept for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF BREAKFAST AND DINING-ROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn eating-room should have in it a large closet, with drawers and\r\nshelves, in which should be kept all the articles used at meals. This,\r\nif possible, should communicate with the kitchen, by a sliding window,\r\nor by a door, and have in it a window, and also a small sink, made of\r\nmarble or lined with zinc, which will be a great convenience for washing\r\nnice articles. If there be a dumb-waiter, it is best to have it\r\nconnected with such a closet. It may be so contrived, that, when it is\r\ndown, it shall form part of the closet floor.\r\n\r\nA table-rug, or crumb-cloth, is useful to save carpets from injury.\r\nBocking, or baize, is best. Always spread the same side up, or the\r\ncarpet will be soiled by the rug. Table-mats are needful, to prevent\r\ninjury to the table from the warm dishes. Teacup-mats, or small plates,\r\nare useful to save the table-cloths from dripping tea or coffee.\r\nButter-knives, for the butter-plate, and salt-spoons, for salt-dishes,\r\nare designed to prevent those disgusting marks which are made, when\r\npersons use their own knives, to take salt or butter. A sugar-spoon\r\nshould be kept in or by the sugar-dish, for the same purpose.\r\nTable-napkins, of diaper, are often laid by each person's plate, for\r\nuse during the meal, to save the tablecloth and pocket-handkerchief. To\r\npreserve the same napkin for the same person, each member of the family\r\nhas a given number, and the napkins are numbered to correspond, or else\r\nare slipped into ivory rings, which are numbered. A stranger has a clean\r\none, at each meal. Tablecloths should be well starched, and ironed on\r\nthe right side, and always, when taken off, folded in the ironed\r\ncreases. _Doilies_ are colored napkins, which, when fruit is offered,\r\nshould always be furnished, to prevent a person from staining a nice\r\nhandkerchief, or permitting the fruit-juice to dry on the fingers.\r\n\r\nCasters and salt-stands should be put in order, every morning, when\r\nwashing the breakfast things. Always, if possible, provide _fine_ and\r\n_dry_ table-salt, as many persons are much disgusted with that which is\r\ndark, damp, and coarse. Be careful to keep salad-oil closely corked, or\r\nit will grow rancid. Never leave the salt-spoons in the salt, nor the\r\nmustard-spoon in the mustard, as they are thereby injured. Wipe them,\r\nimmediately after the meal.\r\n\r\nFor table-furniture, French china is deemed the nicest, but it is liable\r\nto the objection of having plates, so made, that salt, butter, and\r\nsimilar articles, will not lodge on the edge, but slip into the centre.\r\nSelect knives and forks, which have weights in the handles, so that,\r\nwhen laid down, they will not touch the table. Those with rivetted\r\nhandles last longer than any others. Horn handles (except buckhorn) are\r\nvery poor. The best are cheapest in the end. Knives should be sharpened\r\nonce a month, unless they are kept sharp by the mode of scouring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Setting Tables._\r\n\r\nNeat housekeepers observe the manner in which a table is set more than\r\nany thing else; and to a person of good taste, few things are more\r\nannoying, than to see the table placed askew; the tablecloth soiled,\r\nrumpled, and put on awry; the plates, knives, and dishes thrown about,\r\nwithout any order; the pitchers soiled on the outside, and sometimes\r\nwithin; the tumblers dim; the caster out of order; the butter pitched on\r\nthe plate, without any symmetry; the salt coarse, damp, and dark; the\r\nbread cut in a mixture of junks and slices; the dishes of food set on at\r\nrandom, and without mats; the knives dark or rusty, and their handles\r\ngreasy; the tea-furniture all out of order, and every thing in similar\r\nstyle. And yet, many of these negligences will be met with, at the\r\ntables of persons who call themselves well bred, and who have wealth\r\nenough to make much outside show. One reason for this, is, the great\r\ndifficulty of finding domestics, who will attend to these things in a\r\nproper manner, and who, after they have been repeatedly instructed, will\r\nnot neglect nor forget what has been said to them. The writer has known\r\ncases, where much has been gained by placing the following rules in\r\nplain sight, in the place where the articles for setting tables are\r\nkept.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rules for setting a Table._\r\n\r\n1. Lay the rug square with the room, and also smooth and even; then set\r\nthe table also square with the room, and see that the _legs_ are in the\r\nright position to support the leaves.\r\n\r\n2. Lay the tablecloth square with the table, _right side up_, smooth,\r\nand even.\r\n\r\n3. Put on the teatray (for breakfast or tea) square with the table; set\r\nthe cups and saucers at the front side of the teatray, and the sugar,\r\nslop-bowls, and cream-cup, at the back side. Lay the sugar-spoon or\r\ntongs on the sugar-bowl.\r\n\r\n4. Lay the plates around the table, at equal intervals, and the knives\r\nand forks at regular distances, each in the same particular manner, with\r\na cup-mat, or cup-plate, to each, and a napkin at the right side of each\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n5. If meat be used, set the caster and salt-cellars in the centre of the\r\ntable; then lay mats for the dishes, and place the carving-knife and\r\nfork and steel by the master of the house. Set the butter on two plates,\r\none on either side, with a butter-knife by each.\r\n\r\n6. Set the tea or coffee-pot on a mat, at the right hand of the teatray,\r\n(if there be not room upon it.) Then place the chairs around the table,\r\nand call the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For Dinner._\r\n\r\n1. Place the rug, table, tablecloth, plates, knives and forks, and\r\nnapkins, as before directed, with a tumbler by each plate. In cold\r\nweather, set the plates where they will be warmed.\r\n\r\n2. Put the caster in the centre, and the salt-stands at two oblique\r\ncorners, of the table, the latter between two large spoons crossed. If\r\nmore spoons be needed, lay them on each side of the caster, crossed. Set\r\nthe pitcher on a mat, either at a side-table, or, when there is no\r\nwaiter, on the dining-table. Water looks best in glass decanters.\r\n\r\n3. Set the bread on the table, when there is no waiter. Some take a\r\nfork, and lay a piece on the napkin or tumbler by each plate. Others\r\nkeep it in a tray, covered with a white napkin to keep off flies. Bread\r\nfor dinner is often cut in small junks, and not in slices.\r\n\r\n4. Set the principal dish before the master of the house, and the other\r\ndishes in a regular manner. Put the carving-knife, fork, and steel, by\r\nthe principal dish, and also a knife-rest, if one be used.\r\n\r\n5. Put a small knife and fork by the pickles, and also by any other\r\ndishes which need them. Then place the chairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Waiting at Table._\r\n\r\nA domestic, who waits on the table, should be required to keep the hair\r\nand hands in neat order, and have on a clean apron. A small teatray\r\nshould be used to carry cups and plates. The waiter should announce the\r\nmeal (when ready) to the mistress of the family, then stand by the\r\neating-room door, till all are in, then close the door, and step to the\r\nleft side of the lady of the house. When all are seated, the waiter\r\nshould remove the covers, taking care first to invert them, so as not to\r\ndrop the steam on the tablecloth or guests. In presenting articles, go\r\nto the left side of the person. In pouring water never entirely fill the\r\ntumbler. The waiter should notice when bread or water is wanting, and\r\nhand it without being called. When plates are changed, be careful not to\r\ndrop knives or forks. Brush off crumbs, with a crumb-brush, into a small\r\nwaiter.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no domestic waiter, a light table should be set at the\r\nleft side of the mistress of the house, on which the bread, water, and\r\nother articles not in immediate use, can be placed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Carving and Helping at Table._\r\n\r\nIt is considered an accomplishment for a lady to know how to carve well,\r\nat her own table. It is not proper to stand in carving. The\r\ncarving-knife should be sharp and thin. To carve fowls, (which should\r\nalways be laid with the breast uppermost,) place the fork in the breast,\r\nand take off the wings and legs without turning the fowl; then cut out\r\nthe merry thought, cut slices from the breast, take out the collar bone,\r\ncut off the side pieces, and then cut the carcass in two. Divide the\r\njoints in the leg of a turkey.\r\n\r\nIn helping the guests, when no choice is expressed, give a piece of both\r\nthe white and dark meat, with some of the stuffing. Inquire whether the\r\nguest will be helped to each kind of vegetable, and put the gravy on the\r\nplate, and not on any article of food.\r\n\r\nIn carving a sirloin, cut thin slices from the side next to you, (it\r\nmust be put on the dish with the tenderloin underneath;) then turn it,\r\nand cut from the tenderloin Help the guest to both kinds.\r\n\r\nIn carving a leg of mutton, or a ham, begin by cutting across the\r\nmiddle, to the bone. Cut a tongue across, and not lengthwise, and help\r\nfrom the middle part.\r\n\r\nCarve a forequarter of lamb, by separating the shoulder from the ribs,\r\nand then dividing the ribs. To carve a loin of veal, begin at the\r\nsmaller end and separate the ribs. Help each one to a piece of the\r\nkidney and its fat. Carve pork and mutton in the same way.\r\n\r\nTo carve a fillet of veal, begin at the top, and help to the stuffing\r\nwith each slice. In a breast of veal, separate the breast and brisket,\r\nand then cut them up, asking which part is preferred. In carving a pig,\r\nit is customary to divide it, and take off the head, before it comes to\r\nthe table; as, to many persons, the head is very revolting. Cut off the\r\nlimbs, and divide the ribs. In carving venison, make a deep incision\r\ndown to the bone, to let out the juices; then turn the broad end of the\r\nhaunch towards you, cutting deep, in thin slices. For a saddle of\r\nvenison, cut from the tail towards the other end, on each side, in thin\r\nslices. Warm plates are very necessary, with venison and mutton, and in\r\nWinter, are desirable for all meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF CHAMBERS AND BEDROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery mistress of a family should see, not only that all sleeping-rooms\r\nin her house _can be_ well ventilated at night, but that they actually\r\nare so. Where there is no open fireplace to admit the pure air from the\r\nexterior, a door should be left open into an entry, or room where fresh\r\nair is admitted; or else a small opening should be made in a window,\r\ntaking care not to allow a draught of air to cross the bed. The debility\r\nof childhood, the lassitude of domestics, and the ill-health of\r\nfamilies, are often caused by neglecting to provide a supply of pure\r\nair. Straw matting is best for a chamber carpet, and strips of woollen\r\ncarpeting may be laid by the side of the bed. Where chambers have no\r\nclosets, a _wardrobe_ is indispensable. This is a moveable closet, with\r\ndoors, divided, by a perpendicular partition, into two apartments. In\r\none division, rows of hooks are placed, on which to hang dresses. The\r\nother division is fitted up with shelves, for other uses. Some are made\r\nwith drawers at the bottom for shoes, and such like articles. A low\r\nsquare box, set on casters, with a cushion on the top, and a drawer on\r\none side to put shoes in, is a great convenience in dressing the feet.\r\nAn old champaigne basket, fitted up with a cushion on the lid, and a\r\nvalance fastened to it to cover the sides, can be used for the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nA comfortable couch, for chambers and sitting-rooms, can be made by a\r\ncommon carpenter, at a small expense. Have a frame made (like the\r\nannexed engraving, Fig. 38,) of common stuff, six feet long,\r\ntwenty-eight inches wide, and twelve inches high. It must be made thus\r\nlow, because the casters and cushions will raise it several inches. Have\r\nthe sloping side-piece, _a_, and head-piece, _b_, sawed out of a board;\r\nnail brown linen on them, and stuff them with soft hay or hair. Let\r\nthese be screwed to the frame, and covered with furniture patch. Then\r\nlet slats be nailed across the bottom, as at _c_, _c_, four inches\r\napart. This will cost two or three dollars. Then make a thick cushion,\r\nof hay or straw, with side strips, like a mattress, and lay this for the\r\nunder-cushion. To put over this, make a thinner cushion, of hair, cover\r\nit with furniture-calico, and fasten to it a valance reaching to the\r\nfloor. Then make two square pillows, and cover them with calico, like\r\nthe rest. Both the cushions should be stitched through like mattresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\nThe writer has seen a couch of this kind, in a common parlor, which\r\ncost less than eight dollars, was much admired, and was a constant\r\ncomfort to the feeble mother, as well as many other members of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAnother convenience, for a room where sewing is done in Summer, is a\r\nfancy-jar, set in one corner, to receive clippings, and any other\r\nrubbish. It can be covered with prints, or paintings, and varnished; and\r\nthen looks very prettily.\r\n\r\nThe trunks in a chamber can be improved in looks and comfort, by making\r\ncushions of the same size and shape, stuffed with hay and covered with\r\nchintz, with a frill reaching nearly to the floor.\r\n\r\nEvery bedchamber should have a washstand, bowl, pitcher, and tumbler,\r\nwith a washbucket under the stand, to receive slops. A light screen,\r\nmade like a clothes-frame, and covered with paper or chintz, should be\r\nfurnished for bedrooms occupied by two persons, so that ablutions can be\r\nperformed in privacy. It can be ornamented, so as to look well anywhere.\r\nA little frame, or towel-horse, by the washstand, on which to dry\r\ntowels, is a convenience. A washstand should be furnished with a sponge\r\nor washcloth, and a small towel, for wiping the basin after using it.\r\nThis should be hung on the washstand or towel-horse, for constant use. A\r\nsoap-dish, and a dish for toothbrushes, are neat and convenient, and\r\neach person should be furnished with two towels; one for the feet, and\r\none for other purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is in good taste to have the curtains, bedquilt, valance, and\r\nwindow-curtains, of similar materials. In making featherbeds,\r\nside-pieces should be put in, like those of mattresses, and the bed\r\nshould be well filled, so that a person will not be buried in a hollow,\r\nwhich is not healthful, save in extremely cold weather. Featherbeds\r\nshould never be used, except in cold weather. At other times, a thin\r\nmattress of hair, cotton and moss, or straw, should be put over them. A\r\nsimple strip of broad straw matting, spread over a featherbed, answers\r\nthe same purpose. Nothing is more debilitating, than, in warm weather,\r\nto sleep with a featherbed pressing round the greater part of the body.\r\nPillows stuffed with papers an inch square, are good for Summer,\r\nespecially for young children, whose heads should be kept cool. The\r\ncheapest and best covering of a bed, for Winter, is a _cotton\r\ncomforter_, made to contain three or four pounds of cotton, laid in\r\nbatts or sheets, between covers tacked together at regular intervals.\r\nThey should be three yards square, and less cotton should be put at the\r\nsides that are tucked in. It is better to have two thin comforters, to\r\neach bed, than one thick one; as then the covering can be regulated\r\naccording to the weather.\r\n\r\nFew domestics will make a bed properly, without much attention from the\r\nmistress of the family. The following directions should be given to\r\nthose who do this work.\r\n\r\nOpen the windows, and lay off the bed-covering, on two chairs, at the\r\nfoot of the bed. After the bed is well aired, shake the feathers, from\r\neach corner to the middle; then take up the middle, and shake it well,\r\nand turn the bed over. Then push the feathers in place, making the head\r\nhigher than the foot, and the sides even, and as high as the middle\r\npart. Then put on the bolster and the under sheet, so that the wrong\r\nside of the sheet shall go next the bed, and the _marking_ come at the\r\nhead, tucking in all around. Then put on the pillows, even, so that the\r\nopen ends shall come to the sides of the bed, and then spread on the\r\nupper sheet, so that the wrong side shall be next the blankets, and the\r\nmarked end at the head. This arrangement of sheets is to prevent the\r\npart where the feet lie from being reversed, so as to come to the face,\r\nand also to prevent the parts soiled by the body from coming to the\r\nbedtick and blankets. Then put on the other covering, except the outer\r\none, tucking in all around, and then turn over the upper sheet, at the\r\nhead, so as to show a part of the pillows. When the pillow-cases are\r\nclean and smooth, they look best outside of the cover, but not\r\notherwise. Then draw the hand along the side of the pillows, to make an\r\neven indentation, and then smooth and shape the whole outside. A nice\r\nhousekeeper always notices the manner in which a bed is made; and in\r\nsome parts of the Country, it is rare to see this work properly\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe writer would here urge every mistress of a family, who keeps more\r\nthan one domestic, to provide them with single beds, that they may not\r\nbe obliged to sleep with all the changing domestics, who come and go so\r\noften. Where the room is too small for two beds, a narrow trucklebed\r\nunder another, will answer. Domestics should be furnished with washing\r\nconveniences in their chambers, and be encouraged to keep their persons\r\nand rooms neat and in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Packing and Storing Articles._\r\n\r\nFold a gentleman's coat, thus:--Lay it on a table or bed, the inside\r\ndownward, and unroll the collar. Double each sleeve once, making the\r\ncrease at the elbow, and laying them so as to make the fewest wrinkles,\r\nand parallel with the skirts. Turn the fronts over the back and sleeves,\r\nand then turn up the skirts, making all as smooth as possible.\r\n\r\nFold a shirt, thus:--One that has a bosom-piece inserted, lay on a bed,\r\nbosom downward. Fold each sleeve twice, and lay it parallel with the\r\nsides of the shirt. Turn the two sides, with the sleeves, over the\r\nmiddle part, and then turn up the bottom, with two folds. This makes the\r\ncollar and bosom lie, unpressed, on the outside.\r\n\r\nFold a frock thus:--Lay its front downward, so as to make the first\r\ncreases in folding come in the side breadths. To do this, find the\r\nmiddle of the side breadths by first putting the middle of the front and\r\nback breadths together. Next, fold over the side creases so as just to\r\nmeet the slit behind. Then fold the skirt again, so as to make the\r\nbacks lie together within and the fronts without. Then arrange the\r\nwaist and sleeves, and fold the skirt around them.\r\n\r\nIn packing trunks, for travelling, put all heavy articles at the bottom,\r\ncovered with paper, which should not be printed, as the ink rubs off.\r\nPut coats and pantaloons into linen cases, made for the purpose, and\r\nfurnished with strings. Fill all crevices with small articles; as, if a\r\ntrunk is not full, nor tightly packed, its contents will be shaken\r\nabout, and get injured. A thin box, the exact size of the trunk, with a\r\nlid, and covered with brown linen, is a great convenience, to set\r\ninside, on the top of the trunk, to contain light articles which would\r\nbe injured by tight packing. Have straps, with buckles, fastened to the\r\ninside, near the bottom, long enough to come up and buckle over this\r\nbox. By this means, when a trunk is not quite full, this box can be\r\nstrapped over so tight, as to keep the articles from rubbing.\r\nUnder-clothing packs closer, by being rolled tightly, instead of being\r\nfolded.\r\n\r\nBonnet-boxes, made of light wood, with a lock and key, are better than\r\nthe paper bandboxes so annoying to travellers. Carpet bags are very\r\nuseful, to carry the articles to be used on a journey. The best ones\r\nhave sides inserted, iron rims, and a lock and key. A large silk\r\ntravelling-bag, with a double linen lining, in which are stitched\r\nreceptacles for toothbrush, combs, and other small articles, is a very\r\nconvenient article for use when travelling.\r\n\r\nA bonnet-cover, made of some thin material, like a large hood with a\r\ncape, is useful to draw over the bonnet and neck, to keep off dust, sun,\r\nand sparks from a steam engine. Green veils are very apt to stain\r\nbonnets, when damp.\r\n\r\nIn packing household furniture, for moving, have each box numbered, and\r\nthen have a book, in which, as each box is packed, note down the number\r\nof the box, and the order in which its contents are packed, as this will\r\nsave much labor and perplexity when unpacking. In packing china and\r\nglass, wrap each article, separately, in paper, and put soft hay or\r\nstraw at bottom and all around each. Put the heaviest articles at the\r\nbottom; and on the top of the box, write, \"This side up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF THE KITCHEN, CELLAR, AND STOREROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf parents wish their daughters to grow up with good domestic habits,\r\nthey should have, as one means of securing this result, a neat and\r\ncheerful kitchen. A kitchen should always, if possible, be entirely\r\nabove ground, and well lighted. It should have a large sink, with a\r\ndrain running under ground, so that all the premises may be kept sweet\r\nand clean. If flowers and shrubs be cultivated, around the doors and\r\nwindows, and the yard near them be kept well turfed, it will add very\r\nmuch to their agreeable appearance. The walls should often be cleaned\r\nand whitewashed, to promote a neat look and pure air. The floor of a\r\nkitchen should be painted, or, which is better, covered with an\r\noilcloth. To procure a kitchen oilcloth as cheaply as possible, buy\r\ncheap tow cloth, and fit it to the size and shape of the kitchen. Then\r\nhave it stretched, and nailed to the south side of the barn, and, with a\r\nbrush, cover it with a coat of thin rye paste. When this is dry, put on\r\na coat of yellow paint, and let it dry for a fortnight. It is safest to\r\nfirst try the paint, and see if it dries well, as some paint never will\r\ndry. Then put on a second coat, and at the end of another fortnight, a\r\nthird coat. Then let it hang two months, and it will last, uninjured,\r\nfor many years. The longer the paint is left to dry, the better. If\r\nvarnished, it will last much longer.\r\n\r\nA sink should be scalded out every day, and occasionally with hot ley.\r\nOn nails, over the sink, should be hung three good dish-cloths, hemmed,\r\nand furnished with loops; one for dishes not greasy, one for greasy\r\ndishes, and one for washing pots and kettles. These should be put in the\r\nwash every week. The lady who insists upon this, will not be annoyed by\r\nhaving her dishes washed with dark, musty, and greasy, rags, as is too\r\nfrequently the case.\r\n\r\nUnder the sink should be kept a slop-pail; and, on a shelf by it, a\r\nsoap-dish and two water-pails. A large boiler, of warm soft water,\r\nshould always be kept over the fire, well covered, and a hearth-broom\r\nand bellows be hung near the fire. A clock is a very important article\r\nin the kitchen, in order to secure regularity at meals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Washing Dishes._\r\n\r\nNo item of domestic labor is so frequently done in a negligent manner,\r\nby domestics, as this. A full supply of conveniences, will do much\r\ntoward a remedy of this evil. A swab, made of strips of linen, tied to a\r\nstick, is useful to wash nice dishes, especially small, deep articles.\r\nTwo or three towels, and three dish-cloths, should be used. Two large\r\ntin tubs, painted on the outside, should be provided; one for washing,\r\nand one for rinsing; also, a large old waiter, on which to drain the\r\ndishes. A soap-dish, with hard soap, and a fork, with which to use it, a\r\nslop-pail, and two pails for water, should also be furnished. Then, if\r\nthere be danger of neglect, the following rules for washing dishes,\r\nlegibly written, may be hung up by the sink, and it will aid in\r\npromoting the desired care and neatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rules for Washing Dishes._\r\n\r\n1. Scrape the dishes, putting away any food which may remain on them,\r\nand which it may be proper to save for future use. Put grease into the\r\ngrease-pot, and whatever else may be on the plates, into the slop-pail.\r\nSave tea-leaves, for sweeping. Set all the dishes, when scraped, in\r\nregular piles; the smallest at the top.\r\n\r\n2. Put the nicest articles in the wash-dish, and wash them in hot suds,\r\nwith the swab or nicest dish-cloth. Wipe all metal articles, as soon as\r\nthey are washed. Put all the rest into the rinsing-dish, which should\r\nbe filled with hot water. When they are taken out, lay them to drain on\r\nthe waiter. Then rinse the dish-cloth, and hang it up, wipe the articles\r\nwashed, and put them in their places.\r\n\r\n3. Pour in more hot water, wash the greasy dishes with the dish-cloth\r\nmade for them; rinse them, and set them to drain. Wipe them, and set\r\nthem away. Wash the knives and forks, _being careful that the handles\r\nare never put in water_; wipe them, and then lay them in a knife-dish,\r\nto be scoured.\r\n\r\n4. Take a fresh supply of clean suds, in which, wash the milk-pans,\r\nbuckets, and tins. Then rinse and hang up this dish-cloth, and take the\r\nother; with which, wash the roaster, gridiron, pots, and kettles. Then\r\nwash and rinse the dish-cloth, and hang it up. Empty the slop-bucket and\r\nscald it. Dry metal teapots and tins before the fire. Then put the\r\nfireplace in order, and sweep and dust the kitchen.\r\n\r\nSome persons keep a deep and narrow vessel, in which to wash knives with\r\na swab, so that a careless domestic _cannot_ lay them in the water while\r\nwashing them. This article can be carried into the eating-room, to\r\nreceive the knives and forks, when they are taken from the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kitchen Furniture._\r\n\r\n_Crockery._ Brown earthen pans are said to be best, for milk and for\r\ncooking. Tin pans are lighter, and more convenient, but are too cold for\r\nmany purposes. Tall earthen jars, with covers, are good to hold butter,\r\nsalt, lard, &c. Acids should never be put into the red earthen ware, as\r\nthere is a poisonous ingredient in the glazing, which the acid takes\r\noff. Stone ware is better, and stronger, and safer, every way, than any\r\nother kind.\r\n\r\n_Iron Ware._ Many kitchens are very imperfectly supplied with the\r\nrequisite conveniences for cooking. When a person has sufficient means,\r\nthe following articles are all desirable. A nest of iron pots, of\r\ndifferent sizes, (they should be slowly heated, when new;) a long iron\r\nfork, to take out articles from boiling water; an iron hook, with a\r\nhandle, to lift pots from the crane; a large and small gridiron, with\r\ngrooved bars, and a trench to catch the grease; a Dutch oven, called,\r\nalso, a bakepan; two skillets, of different sizes, and a spider, or flat\r\nskillet, for frying; a griddle, a waffle-iron, tin and iron bake and\r\nbread-pans; two ladles, of different sizes; a skimmer; iron skewers; a\r\ntoasting-iron; two teakettles, one small and one large one; two brass\r\nkettles, of different sizes, for soap-boiling, &c. Iron kettles, lined\r\nwith porcelain, are better for preserves. The German are the best. Too\r\nhot a fire will crack them, but with care in this respect, they will\r\nlast for many years.\r\n\r\nPortable furnaces, of iron or clay, are very useful, in Summer, in\r\nwashing, ironing, and stewing, or making preserves. If used in the\r\nhouse, a strong draught must be made, to prevent the deleterious effects\r\nof the charcoal. A box and mill, for spice, pepper, and coffee, are\r\nneedful to those who use these articles. Strong knives and forks, a\r\nsharp carving-knife, an iron cleaver and board, a fine saw, steelyards,\r\nchopping-tray and knife, an apple-parer, steel for sharpening knives,\r\nsugar-nippers, a dozen iron spoons, also a large iron one with a long\r\nhandle, six or eight flatirons, one of them very small, two iron-stands,\r\na ruffle-iron, a crimping-iron, are also desirable.\r\n\r\n_Tin Ware._ Bread-pans, large and small pattypans, cake-pans, with a\r\ncentre tube to insure their baking well, pie-dishes, (of block-tin,) a\r\ncovered butter-kettle, covered kettles to hold berries, two sauce-pans,\r\na large oil-can, (with a cock,) a lamp-filler, a lantern, broad-bottomed\r\ncandlesticks for the kitchen, a candle-box, a funnel or tunnel, a\r\nreflector, for baking warm cakes, an oven or tin-kitchen, an\r\napple-corer, an apple-roaster, an egg-boiler, two sugar-scoops, and\r\nflour and meal-scoop, a set of mugs, three dippers, a pint, quart, and\r\ngallon measure, a set of scales and weights, three or four pails,\r\npainted on the outside, a slop-bucket, with a tight cover, painted on\r\nthe outside, a milk-strainer, a gravy-strainer, a colander, a\r\ndredging-box, a pepper-box, a large and small grater, a box, in which to\r\nkeep cheese, also a large one for cake, and a still larger one for\r\nbread, with tight covers. Bread, cake, and cheese, shut up in this way,\r\nwill not grow dry as in the open air.\r\n\r\n_Wooden Ware._ A nest of tubs, a set of pails and bowls, a large and\r\nsmall sieve, a beetle for mashing potatoes, a spad or stick for stirring\r\nbutter and sugar, a bread-board, for moulding bread and making\r\npie-crust, a coffee-stick, a clothes-stick, a mush-stick, a meat-beetle\r\nto pound tough meat, an egg-beater, a ladle for working butter, a\r\nbread-trough, (for a large family,) flour-buckets, with lids to hold\r\nsifted flour and Indian meal, salt-boxes, sugar-boxes, starch and\r\nindigo-boxes, spice-boxes, a bosom-board, a skirt-board, a large\r\nironing-board, two or three clothes-frames, and six dozen clothes-pins.\r\n\r\n_Basket Ware._ Baskets, of all sizes, for eggs, fruit, marketing,\r\nclothes, &c.; also chip-baskets. When often used, they should be washed\r\nin hot suds.\r\n\r\n_Other Articles._ Every kitchen needs a box containing balls of brown\r\nthread and twine, a large and small darning needle, rolls of waste-paper\r\nand old linen and cotton, and a supply of common holders. There should\r\nalso be another box, containing a hammer, carpet-tacks, and nails of all\r\nsizes, a carpet-claw, screws and a screw-driver, pincers, gimlets of\r\nseveral sizes, a bed-screw, a small saw, two chisels, (one to use for\r\nbuttonholes in broadcloth,) two awls, and two files.\r\n\r\nIn a drawer, or cupboard, should be placed, cotton table-cloths, for\r\nkitchen use, nice crash towels, for tumblers, marked, T T; coarser\r\ntowels, for dishes, marked, T; six large roller-towels; a dozen\r\nhand-towels, marked, H T; and a dozen hemmed dish-cloths, with loops.\r\nAlso, two thick linen pudding or dumpling-cloths, a gelly-bag, made of\r\nwhite flannel, to strain gelly, a starch-strainer, and a bag for boiling\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nIn a closet, should be kept, arranged in order, the following articles:\r\nthe dust-pan, dust-brush, and dusting-cloths, old flannel and cotton for\r\nscouring and rubbing, sponges for washing windows and looking-glasses, a\r\nlong brush for cobwebs, and another for washing the outside of windows,\r\nwhisk-brooms, common brooms, a coat-broom or brush, a whitewash-brush, a\r\nstove-brush, shoebrushes and blacking, articles for cleaning tin and\r\nsilver, leather for cleaning metals, bottles containing stain-mixtures,\r\nand other articles used in cleansing.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\nA cellar should often be whitewashed, to keep it sweet. It should have a\r\ndrain, to keep it perfectly dry, as standing water, in a cellar, is a\r\nsure cause of disease in a family. It is very dangerous to leave decayed\r\nvegetables in a cellar. Many a fever has been caused, by the poisonous\r\nmiasm thus generated. The following articles are desirable in a cellar:\r\na safe, or moveable closet, with sides of wire or perforated tin, in\r\nwhich cold meats, cream, and other articles should be kept; (if ants be\r\ntroublesome, set the legs in tin cups of water;) a refrigerator, or\r\nlarge wooden box, on feet, with a lining of tin or zinc, and a space\r\nbetween the tin and wood filled with powdered charcoal, having at the\r\nbottom, a place for ice, a drain to carry off the water, and also\r\nmoveable shelves and partitions. In this, articles are kept cool. It\r\nshould be cleaned, once a week. Filtering jars, to purify water, should\r\nalso be kept in the cellar. Fish and cabbages, in a cellar, are apt to\r\nscent a house, and give a bad taste to other articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOREROOM.\r\n\r\nEvery house needs a storeroom, in which to keep tea, coffee, sugar,\r\nrice, candles, &c. It should be furnished with jars, having labels, a\r\nlarge spoon, a fork, sugar and flour-scoops, a towel, and a dish-cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modes of destroying Insects and Vermin._\r\n\r\n_Bed-bugs_ should be kept away, by filling every chink in the bedstead\r\nwith putty, and, if it be old, painting it over. Of all the mixtures for\r\nkilling them, _corrosive sublimate and alcohol_ is the surest. This is a\r\nstrong poison.\r\n\r\n_Cockroaches_ may be destroyed, by pouring boiling water into their\r\nhaunts, or setting a mixture of arsenic, mixed with Indian meal and\r\nmolasses, where they are found. Chloride of lime and sweetened water\r\nwill also poison them.\r\n\r\n_Fleas._ If a dog be infested with these insects, put him in a tub of\r\nwarm soapsuds, and they will rise to the surface. Take them off, and\r\nburn them. Strong perfumes, about the person, diminish their attacks.\r\nWhen caught between the fingers, plunge them in water, or they will\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n_Crickets._ Scalding, and sprinkling Scotch snuff about the haunts of\r\nthese insects, are remedies for the annoyance caused by them.\r\n\r\n_Flies_ can be killed, in great quantities, by placing about the house\r\nvessels, filled with sweetened water and _cobalt_. Six cents worth of\r\ncobalt is enough for a pint of water. It is very poisonous.\r\n\r\n_Musquitoes._ Close nets around a bed, are the only sure protection at\r\nnight, against these insects. Spirit of hartshorn is the best antidote\r\nfor their bite. Salt and water is good.\r\n\r\n_Red_ or _Black Ants_ may be driven away, by scalding their haunts, and\r\nputting Scotch snuff wherever they go for food. Set the legs of closets\r\nand safes in pans of water, and they cannot get at them.\r\n\r\n_Moths._ Airing clothes does not destroy moths, but laying them in a hot\r\nsun does. If articles be tightly sewed up in linen, and fine tobacco be\r\nput about them, it is a sure protection. This should be done in April.\r\n\r\n_Rats and Mice._ A good cat is the best remedy for these annoyances.\r\nEqual quantities of hemlock, (or _cicuta_,) and old cheese, will poison\r\nthem, but this renders the house liable to the inconvenience of a bad\r\nsmell. This evil, however, may be lessened, by placing a dish,\r\ncontaining oil of vitriol poured on saltpetre, where the smell is most\r\nannoying. Chloride of lime and water is also good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nON SEWING, CUTTING, AND MENDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery young girl should be taught to do the following kinds of stitch,\r\nwith propriety. Over-stitch, hemming, running, felling, stitching,\r\nback-stitch and run, buttonhole-stitch, chain-stitch, whipping, darning,\r\ngathering, and cross-stitch.\r\n\r\nIn doing over-stitch, the edges should always be first fitted, either\r\nwith pins or basting, to prevent puckering. In turning wide hems, a\r\npaper measure should be used, to make them even. Tucks, also, should be\r\nregulated by a paper measure. A fell should be turned, before the edges\r\nare put together, and the seam should be over-sewed, before felling. All\r\nbiased or goring seams should be felled. For stitching, draw a thread,\r\nand take up two or three threads at a stitch.\r\n\r\nIn making buttonholes, it is best to have a pair of scissors, made for\r\nthe purpose, which cut very neatly. For broadcloth, a chisel and board\r\nare better. The best stitch is made by putting in the needle, and then\r\nturning the thread around it, near the eye. This is better than to draw\r\nthe needle through, and then take up a loop. A thread should first be\r\nput across each side of the buttonhole, and also a stay-thread, or bar,\r\nat each end, before working it. In working the buttonhole, keep the\r\nstay-thread as far from the edge as possible. A small bar should be\r\nworked at each end. Whipping is done better by sewing _over_, and not\r\nunder. The roll should be as fine as possible, the stitches short, the\r\nthread strong, and in sewing, every gather should be taken up.\r\n\r\nThe rule for _gathering_, in shirts, is, to draw a thread, and then take\r\nup two threads and skip four. In _darning_, after the perpendicular\r\nthreads are run, the crossing threads should interlace, exactly, taking\r\none thread and leaving one, like woven threads.\r\n\r\nThe neatest sewers always fit and baste their work, before sewing; and\r\nthey say they always save time in the end, by so doing, as they never\r\nhave to pick out work, on account of mistakes.\r\n\r\nIt is wise to sew closely and tightly all new garments, which will never\r\nbe altered in shape; but some are more nice than wise, in sewing frocks,\r\nand old garments, in the same style. However, this is the least common\r\nextreme. It is much more frequently the case, that articles, which ought\r\nto be strongly and neatly made, are sewed so that a nice sewer would\r\nrather pick out the threads and sew over again, than to be annoyed with\r\nthe sight of grinning stitches, and vexed with constant rips.\r\n\r\n_Workbaskets._ It is very important to neatness, comfort, and success in\r\nsewing, that a lady's workbasket should be properly fitted up. The\r\nfollowing articles are needful to the mistress of a family: a large\r\nbasket, to hold work; having in it, fastened, a smaller basket, or box,\r\ncontaining a needle-book, in which are needles of every size, both\r\nblunts and sharps, with a larger number of those sizes most used; also,\r\nsmall and large darning-needles, for woollen, cotton, and silk; two\r\ntape-needles, large and small; nice scissors, for fine work; buttonhole\r\nscissors; an emery-bag; two balls of white and yellow wax; and two\r\nthimbles, in case one should be mislaid. When a person is troubled with\r\ndamp fingers, a lump of soft chalk, in a paper, is useful, to rub on the\r\nends of the fingers.\r\n\r\nBesides this box, keep in the basket, common scissors; small shears; a\r\nbag containing tapes, of all colors and sizes, done up in rolls; bags,\r\none, containing spools of white, and another of colored, cotton thread,\r\nand another for silks, wound on spools or papers; a box or bag for nice\r\nbuttons, and another for more common ones; a bag containing silk braid,\r\nwelting cords, and galloon binding. Small rolls of pieces of white and\r\nbrown linen and cotton, are also often needed. A brick pincushion is a\r\ngreat convenience, in sewing, and better than screw-cushions. It is made\r\nby covering half a brick with cloth, putting a cushion on the top, and\r\ncovering it tastefully. It is very useful to hold pins and needles,\r\nwhile sewing, and to fasten long seams when basting and sewing.\r\n\r\n_To make a Frock._ The best way for a novice, is, to get a dress fitted\r\n(not sewed) at the best mantuamaker's. Then take out a sleeve, rip it\r\nto pieces, and cut out a pattern. Then take out half of the waist, (it\r\nmust have a seam in front,) and cut out a pattern of the back and\r\nfore-body, both lining and outer part. In cutting the patterns, iron the\r\npieces, smooth, let the paper be stiff, and, with a pin, prick holes in\r\nthe paper, to show the gore in front, and the depth of the seams. With a\r\npen and ink, draw lines from each pinhole, to preserve this mark. Then\r\nbaste the parts together again, in doing which, the unbasted half will\r\nserve as a pattern. When this is done, a lady of common ingenuity can\r\ncut and fit a dress, by these patterns. If the waist of a dress be too\r\ntight, the seam under the arm must be let out; and in cutting a dress,\r\nan allowance should be made, for letting it out, if needful, at this\r\nseam. The lining of the fore-body must be biased.\r\n\r\nThe linings for the waists of dresses should be stiffened cotton or\r\nlinen. In cutting bias-pieces, for trimming, they will not set well,\r\nunless they are exact. In cutting them, use a long rule, and a lead\r\npencil or piece of chalk. Welting-cords should be covered with\r\nbias-pieces; and it saves time, in many cases, to baste on the\r\nwelting-cord, at the same time that you cover it. The best way to put on\r\nhooks and eyes, is to sew them on double broad tape, and then sew this\r\non the frock-lining. They can then be moved easily, and do not show\r\nwhere they are sewed on.\r\n\r\nIn cutting a sleeve, double it biased. The skirts of dresses look badly,\r\nif not full; and in putting on lining, at the bottom, be careful to have\r\nit a very little fuller than the dress, or it will shrink, and look\r\nbadly. All thin silks look much better with lining, and last much\r\nlonger, as do aprons, also. In putting a lining to a dress, baste it on\r\neach separate breadth, and sew it in at the seams, and it looks much\r\nbetter than to have it fastened only at the bottom. Make notches in\r\nselvedge, to prevent it from drawing up the breadth. Dresses, which are\r\nto be washed, should not be lined.\r\n\r\nFigured silks do not generally wear well, if the figure be large and\r\nsatin-like. Black and plain-colored silks can be tested, by procuring\r\nsamples, and making creases in them; fold the creases in a bunch, and\r\nrub them against a rough surface, of moreen or carpeting. Those which\r\nare poor, will soon wear off, at the creases. Plaids look becoming, for\r\ntall women, as they shorten the appearance of the figure. Stripes look\r\nbecoming, on a large person, as they reduce the apparent size. Pale\r\npersons should not wear blue or green, and brunettes should not wear\r\nlight delicate colors, except shades of buff, fawn, or straw color.\r\nPearl white is not good for any complexion. Dead white and black look\r\nbecoming on almost all persons. It is best to try colors, by\r\ncandle-light, for evening dresses; as some colors, which look very\r\nhandsome in the daylight, are very homely when seen by candle-light.\r\nNever cut a dress low in the neck, as this shows that a woman is not\r\nproperly instructed in the rules of modesty and decorum, or that she has\r\nnot sense enough to regard them. Never be in haste to be first in a\r\nfashion, and never go to the extremes.\r\n\r\nIn buying linen, seek for that which has a round close thread, and is\r\nperfectly white; for, if it be not white, at first, it will never\r\nafterwards become so. Much that is called linen, at the shops, is half\r\ncotton, and does not wear so well as cotton alone. Cheap linens are\r\nusually of this kind. It is difficult to discover which are all linen;\r\nbut the best way, is, to find a lot, presumed to be good, take a sample,\r\nwash it, and ravel it. If this be good, the rest of the same lot will\r\nprobably be so. If you cannot do this, draw a thread, each way, and if\r\nboth appear equally strong, it is probably all linen. Linen and cotton\r\nmust be put in clean water, and boiled, to get out the starch, and then\r\nironed. A long piece of linen, a yard wide, will, with care and\r\ncalculation, make eight shirts. In cutting it, take a shirt of the right\r\nsize, as a guide, in fitting and basting. Bosom-pieces, false collars,\r\n&c. must be cut and fitted, by a pattern which suits the person for whom\r\nthe articles are designed. Gentlemen's night-shirts are made like other\r\nshirts, except that they are longer. In cutting chemises, if the cotton\r\nor linen is a yard wide, cut off small half gores, at the top of the\r\nbreadths, and set them on the bottom. Use a long rule and a pencil, in\r\ncutting gores. In cutting cotton, which is quite wide, a seam can be\r\nsaved, by cutting out two at once, in this manner:--cut off three\r\nbreadths, and, with a long rule and a pencil, mark and cut off the\r\ngores, thus: from one breadth, cut off two gores, the whole length, each\r\ngore one fourth of the breadth, at the bottom, and tapering off to a\r\npoint, at the top. The other two breadths are to have a gore cut off\r\nfrom each, which is one fourth wide at top, and two fourths at bottom.\r\nArrange these pieces right, and they will make two chemises, one having\r\nfour seams, and the other three. This is a much easier way of cutting,\r\nthan sewing the three breadths together, in bag-fashion, as is often\r\ndone. The biased, or goring seams, must always be felled. The sleeves\r\nand neck can be cut according to the taste of the wearer, by another\r\nchemise for a pattern. There should be a lining around the armholes,\r\nand stays at all corners. Six yards, of yard width, will make two\r\nchemises.\r\n\r\nOld silk dresses, quilted for skirts, are very serviceable. White\r\nflannel is soiled so easily, and shrinks so much in washing, that it is\r\na good plan to color it a light dove-color, according to the receipt\r\ngiven on page 301. Cotton flannel, dyed thus, is also good for common\r\nskirts. In making up flannel, back-stitch and run the seams, and then\r\ncross-stitch them open. Nice flannel, for infants, can be ornamented,\r\nwith very little expense of time, by turning up the hem, on the right\r\nside, and making a little vine at the edge, with saddler's silk. The\r\nstitch of the vine is a modification of buttonhole-stitch.\r\n\r\nLong night gowns are best, cut a little goring. It requires five yards,\r\nfor a long nightgown, and two and a half for a short one. Linen\r\nnightcaps wear longer than cotton ones, and do not, like them, turn\r\nyellow. They should be ruffled with linen, as cotton borders will not\r\nlast so long as the cap. A double-quilted wrapper is a great comfort, in\r\ncase of sickness. It may be made of two old dresses. It should not be\r\ncut full, but rather like a gentleman's study-gown, having no gathers or\r\nplaits, but large enough to slip off and on with ease. A double gown, of\r\ncalico, is also very useful. Most articles of dress, for grown persons\r\nor children, require patterns.\r\n\r\n_Bedding._ The best beds, are thick hair mattresses, which, for persons\r\nin health, are good for Winter as well as Summer use. Mattresses may\r\nalso be made of husks, dried and drawn into shreds; also, of alternate\r\nlayers of cotton and moss. The most profitable sheeting, is the Russian,\r\nwhich will last three times as long as any other. It is never perfectly\r\nwhite. Unbleached cotton is good for Winter. It is poor economy to make\r\nnarrow and short sheets, as children and domestics will always slip them\r\noff, and soil the bedtick and bolster. They should be three yards long,\r\nand two and a half wide, so that they can be tucked in all around. All\r\nbed-linen should be marked and numbered, so that a bed can always be\r\nmade properly, and all missing articles be known.\r\n\r\n_Mending._ Silk dresses will last much longer, by ripping out the\r\nsleeves, when thin, and changing the arms, and also the breadths of the\r\nskirt. Tumbled black silk, which is old and rusty, should be dipped in\r\nwater, then be drained for a few minutes, without squeezing or pressing,\r\nand then ironed. Cold tea is better than water. Sheets, when worn thin\r\nin the middle, should be ripped, and the other edges sewed together.\r\nWindow-curtains last much longer, if lined, as the sun fades and rots\r\nthem. Broadcloth should be cut with reference to the way the nap runs.\r\nWhen pantaloons are thin, it is best to newly seat them, cutting the\r\npiece inserted in a curve, as corners are difficult to fit. When the\r\nknees are thin, it is a case of domestic surgery, which demands\r\n_amputation_. This is performed, by cutting off both legs, some distance\r\nabove the knees, and then changing the legs. Take care to cut them off\r\nexactly of the same length, or in the exchange they will not fit. This\r\nmethod brings the worn spot under the knees, and the seam looks much\r\nbetter than a patch and darn. Hose can be cut down, when the feet are\r\nworn. Take an old stocking, and cut it up for a pattern. Make the heel\r\nshort. In sewing, turn each edge, and run it down, and then sew over the\r\nedges. This is better than to stitch and then cross-stitch. Run thin\r\nplaces in stockings, and it will save darning a hole. If shoes are worn\r\nthrough on the sides, in the upper-leather, slip pieces of broadcloth\r\nunder, and sew them around the holes. If, in sewing, the thread kinks,\r\nbreak it off and begin at the other end. In using spool-cotton, thread\r\nthe needle with the end which comes off first, and not the end where you\r\nbreak it off. This often prevents kinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nON THE CARE OF YARDS AND GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authorities consulted in the preparation of this and kindred\r\nchapters, are, Loudon's Encyclopaedia of Gardening, Bridgeman's Young\r\nGardener, Hovey's Magazine of Horticulture, the writings of Judge\r\nBuel,[T] and Downing's Landscape Gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Preparation of Soil._\r\n\r\nIf the garden soil be clayey, and adhesive, put on a covering of sand,\r\nthree inches thick, and the same depth of well-rotted manure. Spade it\r\nin, as deep as possible, and mix it well. If the soil be sandy and\r\nloose, spade in clay and ashes. Ashes are good for all kinds of soil, as\r\nthey loosen those which are close, hold moisture in those which are\r\nsandy, and destroy insects. The best kind of soil, is that, which will\r\nhold water the longest, without becoming hard, when dry.\r\n\r\n_To prepare Soil for Pot-plants_, take one fourth part of common soil,\r\none fourth part of well-decayed manure, and one half of vegetable mould,\r\nfrom the woods, or from a chip-yard. Break up the manure, fine, and sift\r\nit through a lime-screen, (or coarse wire sieve.) These materials must\r\nbe thoroughly mixed. When the common soil which is used, is adhesive,\r\nand, indeed, in most other cases, it is necessary to add sand, the\r\nproportion of which, must depend on the nature of the soil.\r\n\r\n_On the Preparation of a Hot Bed._ Dig a pit, six feet long, five feet\r\nwide, and thirty inches deep. Make a frame, of the same size, with the\r\nback two feet high, the front fifteen inches, and the sides sloped from\r\nthe back to the front. Make two sashes, each three feet by five, with\r\nthe panes of glass lapping like shingles, instead of having cross bars.\r\nSet the frame over the pit, which should then be filled with fresh\r\nhorse-dung, which has not lain long, nor been sodden by water. Tread it\r\ndown, hard, then put into the frame, light, and very rich soil, ten or\r\ntwelve inches deep, and cover it with the sashes, for two or three days.\r\nThen stir the soil, and sow the seeds in shallow drills, placing sticks\r\nby them, to mark the different kinds. Keep the frame covered with the\r\nglass, whenever it is cold enough to chill the plants; but at all other\r\ntimes, admit fresh air, which is indispensable to their health. When the\r\nsun is quite warm, raise the glasses, enough to admit air, and cover\r\nthem with matting or blankets, or else the sun may kill the young\r\nplants. Water the bed at evening, with water which has stood all day,\r\nor, if it be fresh drawn, add a little warm water. If there be too much\r\nheat in the bed, so as to scorch or wither the plants, make deep holes,\r\nwith stakes, and fill them up when the heat is reduced. In very cold\r\nnights, cover the box with straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Planting Flower Seeds._\r\n\r\nBreak up the soil, till it is very soft, and free from lumps. Rub that\r\nnearest the surface, between the hands, to make it fine. Make a circular\r\ndrill, a foot in diameter. For seeds as large as sweet peas, it should\r\nbe half an inch deep. The smallest seeds must be planted very near the\r\nsurface, and a very little fine earth be sifted over them. Seeds are to\r\nbe planted either deeper or nearer the surface, according to their size.\r\nAfter covering them with soil, beat them down with a trowel, so as to\r\nmake the earth as compact as it is after a heavy shower. Set up a stick,\r\nin the middle of the circle, with the name of the plant heavily written\r\nupon it, with a dark lead pencil. This remains more permanent, if white\r\nlead be first rubbed over the surface. Never plant, when the soil is\r\nvery wet. In very dry times, water the seeds at night. Never use very\r\ncold water. When the seeds are small, many should be planted together,\r\nthat they may assist each other in breaking the soil. When the plants\r\nare an inch high, thin them out, leaving only one or two, if the plant\r\nbe a large one, like the Balsam; five or six, when it is of a medium\r\nsize; and eighteen or twenty of the smaller size. Transplanting, retards\r\nthe growth of a plant about a fortnight. It is best to plant at two\r\ndifferent times, lest the first planting should fail, owing to wet or\r\ncold weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Plant Garden Seeds._\r\n\r\nMake the beds a yard wide; lay across them a board, a yard long and a\r\nfoot wide, and, with a stick, make a furrow, on each side of it, one\r\ninch deep. Scatter the seeds in this furrow, and cover them. Then lay\r\nthe board over them and step on it, to press down the earth. When the\r\nplants are an inch high, thin them out, leaving spaces proportioned to\r\ntheir sizes. Seeds of a similar species, such as melons and squashes,\r\nshould not be planted very near to each other, as this causes them to\r\ndegenerate. The same kinds of vegetables should not be planted in the\r\nsame place, for two years in succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Transplanting._\r\n\r\nTransplant at evening, or, which is better, just before a shower. Take a\r\nround stick, sharpened at the point, and make openings to receive the\r\nplants. Set them a very little deeper than they were before, and press\r\nthe soil firmly round them. Then water them, and cover them for three or\r\nfour days, taking care that sufficient air be admitted. If the plant can\r\nbe removed, without disturbing the soil around the root, it will not be\r\nat all retarded, by transplanting. Never remove leaves and branches,\r\nunless a part of the roots be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Re-pot House-Plants._\r\n\r\nRenew the soil, every year, soon after the time of blossoming. Prepare\r\nsoil, as previously directed. Loosen the earth from the pot, by passing\r\na knife around the sides. Turn the plant upside down, and remove the\r\npot. Then remove all the matted fibres at the bottom, and all the earth,\r\nexcept that which adheres to the roots. From woody plants, like roses,\r\nshake off all the earth. Take the new pot, and put a piece of broken\r\nearthen-ware over the hole at the bottom; and then, holding the plant in\r\nthe proper position, shake in the earth, around it. Then pour in water,\r\nto settle the earth, and heap on fresh soil, till the pot is even full.\r\nSmall pots are considered better than large ones, as the roots are not\r\nso likely to rot, from excess of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Laying out of Yards and Gardens._\r\n\r\nIn planting trees, in a yard, they should be arranged in groups, and\r\nnever planted in straight lines, nor sprinkled about, as solitary trees.\r\nThe object of this arrangement, is, to imitate Nature, and secure some\r\nspots of dense shade and some of cleared turf. In yards which are\r\ncovered with turf, beds can be cut out of it, and raised for flowers. A\r\ntrench should be made around, to prevent the grass from running on them.\r\nThese beds can be made in the shape of crescents, ovals, or other\r\nfanciful forms, of which, the figure below is one specimen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\nIn laying out beds, in gardens and yards, a very pretty bordering can be\r\nmade, by planting them with common flax seed, in a line about three\r\ninches from the edge. This can be trimmed, with shears, when it grows\r\ntoo high.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Cultivation of Bulbs, and Tuberous Roots._\r\n\r\nFor planting the _Amaryllis_, take one third part of leaf mould, half as\r\nmuch sand, and the remainder, earth from under fresh grass sods. Plant\r\nthem in May. The bulb should not be set more than half its depth in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe _Anemone_ and _Ranunculus_ are medium, or half-hardy, roots. They\r\nshould be planted in soil which is enriched with cowdung, and the beds\r\nshould be raised only an inch from the walk. They must be planted in\r\nOctober, in drills, two inches deep, the claws of the roots downward,\r\nand be shaded when they begin to bud.\r\n\r\nThe _Crocus_ must be planted in October, two inches deep, and four\r\ninches apart. In measuring the depth, always calculate from the top of\r\nthe bulb.\r\n\r\n_Crown Imperial._ This must be planted in September, three or four\r\ninches deep; and need not be taken up but once in three years.\r\n\r\n_Gladiolus._ Those who have greenhouses, or pits, plant the Gladiolus in\r\nOctober, and preserve it in pots through the Winter. Those who have not\r\nthese conveniences, may plant these bulbs late in April. The earth must\r\nbe composed of one half common soil, one fourth leaf mould, and one\r\nfourth sand. Plant them about an inch deep.\r\n\r\n_Hyacinths_ should be planted in October, eight inches apart, and three\r\nor four inches deep, in a rich soil.\r\n\r\n_Jonquilles_ should be planted in October, two inches deep, in a rich\r\nsoil, and should not be taken up oftener than once in three years.\r\n\r\n_Narcissus._ This should be planted in October, four inches deep;\r\ncovered, through the Winter, with straw and leaves, six inches thick;\r\nand uncovered in the middle of March.\r\n\r\n_Oxalis._ Plant this in September, in a soil, composed of two thirds\r\ncommon earth, and one third leaf mould. The old bulb dies after\r\nblossoming, and is succeeded by a new one.\r\n\r\nPlant _Tulips_, in rich soil, in October, three inches deep.\r\n\r\nPlant _Tuberoses_ late in April, in a rich, sandy soil. They are\r\ndelicate plants, and should be covered, in case of frosts.\r\n\r\n_Daffodils_ should be planted two inches deep.\r\n\r\nWhen bulbs have done flowering, and their leaves begin to decay, they\r\nshould be taken up and dried, and kept in a dry place, till October,\r\nwhen they are to be replanted, taking off the offsets, and putting them\r\nin a bed by themselves.\r\n\r\nBulbs which blossom in water, or are in any other way forced to bloom\r\nout of season, are so much exhausted by it, that it takes them two or\r\nthree years to recover their beauty.\r\n\r\n_Dahlias._ Dig a hole, a foot and a half deep; fill it with very light,\r\nloose, and rich, soil; and drive in a stake, a yard and a half high, to\r\nwhich, to tie the future plants. Then set in the root, so that it shall\r\nbe an inch below the soil, where the sprout starts. When the plants are\r\ntwo feet high, tie them to the stakes, and take off some of the lower\r\nside-shoots. Continue to tie them, as their growth advances. If the\r\nroots are planted in the open borders, without any previous growth, it\r\nshould be done as early as the first of May, and they should be covered\r\nfrom the frosts. When they are brought forward, in pots or hot-beds,\r\nthey should be put out, in the middle of June. It is said, by gardeners,\r\nthat late planting, is better than early, for producing perfect flowers.\r\nIn the Autumn, after the frosts have destroyed the tops, let the roots\r\nremain awhile in the ground, to ripen; then dig them up, and pack them\r\naway, in some place where they will neither mould, from dampness, nor\r\nfreeze. In the Spring, these roots will throw out sprouts, and must then\r\nbe divided, so as to leave a good shoot, attached to a piece of the\r\ntuber or old stem, and each shoot will make a new plant. It is stated,\r\nthat if the shoots themselves, without any root, be planted in light\r\nsoil, covered with a bell-glass, or large tumbler, and carefully\r\nwatered, they will produce plants superior to those with roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Annuals_\r\n\r\nThese are flowers which last only one season. They should be so planted,\r\nthat the tallest may be in the middle of a bed, and the shortest at the\r\nedges; and flowers of a similar color should not be planted adjacent to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of some of the handsomest Annuals, arranged with\r\nreference to their color and height. Those with a star before them, do\r\nbest when sowed in the Autumn. Those with _tr._ after them, are trailing\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIX INCHES TO ONE FOOT HIGH.\r\n\r\n_White._ Ice Plant, Sweet Alyssum, White Leptosiphon, Walker's\r\nSchizopetalon, Blumenbachia insignis, *Candytuft.\r\n\r\n_Yellow._ *Yellow Chryseis or Eschscholtzia, Sanvitalia procumbens,\r\n_tr._, Musk-flowered Mimulus.\r\n\r\n_Rose._ Many-flowered Catchfly, Rose-colored Verbena, _tr._\r\n\r\n_Red._ *Chinese Annual Pink, Virginian Stock, Calandrinia Speciosa.\r\n\r\n_Blue._ Graceful Lobelia, Nemophila insignis, Clintonia pulchella,\r\nClintonia elegans, Nolana atriplicifolia, _tr._, Anagallis indica,\r\nCommelina coelestis, Grove Love, Pimpernel (blue.)\r\n\r\n_Varying Colors._ *Heart's Ease, or Pansy, Dwarf Love in a Mist, *Rose\r\nCampion.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES HIGH.\r\n\r\n_White._ Venus's Looking Glass, Priest's Schizanthus, Sweet-scented\r\nStevia, White Evening Primrose.\r\n\r\n_Yellow._ Drummond's Coreopsis, *New Dark Coreopsis, Golden Hawkweed,\r\nDracopis amplexicaulis, Drummond's Primrose, Cladanthus arabicus,\r\nPeroffsky's Erysimum.\r\n\r\n_Rose._ Drummond's Phlox, Rodanthe, Rose-colored Nonea, Clarkia rosea,\r\nSilene Tenorei, Silene armeria.\r\n\r\n_Red._ Crimson Coxcomb, Silene pendula, Crimson Dew Plant, _tr._\r\n\r\n_Scarlet._ Cacalia coccinea, Flos Adonis, Scarlet Zinnia, Mexican\r\nCuphea.\r\n\r\n_Lilac and Purple._ Clarkia elegans, Clarkia pulchella, *Purple\r\nCandytuft, *Purple Petunia, _tr._, *Crimson Candytuft, Double Purple\r\nJacobaea, Leptosiphon androsaceus, all the varieties of Schizanthus,\r\nVeined Verbena, _tr._, *Purple eternal Flower.\r\n\r\n_Blue._ Ageratum Mexicanum, *Gilia capitata, Spanish Nigella, Blue\r\nEutoca, Dwarf Convolvulus, Didiscus coeruleus.\r\n\r\n_Lilac, Purple_, or _Blue and White._ Collinsia bicolor, Gilia tricolor.\r\n\r\n_Very Dark._ Lotus Jacobaeus, Salpiglossis, Scabious.\r\n\r\n_Colors varying._ German Aster, Balsam, Rocket Larkspur, Ten-week Stock,\r\nPoppy.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTEEN INCHES TO TWO FEET.\r\n\r\n_White._ *White Petunia, _tr._, White Clarkia, Double White Jacobaea,\r\nLove in a Mist.\r\n\r\n_Red._ *Lavatera trimestris, Red Zinnia, Malva miniata.\r\n\r\n_Lilac and Purple._ Globe Amaranthus, Purple Sweet Sultan, Sweet\r\nScabious, Purple Zinnia, Prince's Feather, Large Blue Lupine, *Catchfly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO FEET AND UPWARDS.\r\n\r\n_White._ Winged Ammobium, *White Lavatera, White Sweet Sultan, *New\r\nWhite Eternal Flower, White Helicrysum, *White Larkspur.\r\n\r\n_Yellow._ Golden Bartonia, *Golden Coreopsis, Yellow Sweet Sultan,\r\nAfrican Marigold, Yellow Argemone, French Marigold, Yellow Coxcomb,\r\nYellow Hibiscus.\r\n\r\nThe Malope grandiflora and the Cleome are fine tall annuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climbing Plants._\r\n\r\nThe following are the most beautiful _annual climbers_: Crimson, and\r\nWhite, Cypress Vine; White, and Buff, Thunbergia; Scarlet Flowering\r\nBean; Hyacinth Bean Loasa; Morning Glory; Crimson, and Spotted,\r\nNasturtium; Balloon Vine; Sweet Pea; Tangier Pea; Lord Anson's Pea;\r\nClimbing Cobaea; Pink, and White, Maurandia.\r\n\r\nThe following are the most valuable _perennial climbers_: Sweet-scented\r\nMonthly Honeysuckle; Yellow, White, and Coral, Honeysuckles; Purple\r\nGlycine; Clematis; Bitter Sweet; Trumpet Creeper.\r\n\r\nThe Everlasting Pea is a beautiful perennial climber. The Climbing\r\nCobaea, and Passion Flower, are also beautiful perennials, but must be\r\nprotected in Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Perennials._\r\n\r\nThose who cannot afford every year to devote the time necessary to the\r\nraising of annuals, will do well to supply their borders with\r\nperennials. The following is a list of some of those generally\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nAdonis, yellow; Columbine, all colors; Alyssum, yellow; Asclepias,\r\norange and purple; Bee Larkspur, blue; Perennial Larkspur, all colors;\r\nCardinal Flower, scarlet; Chinese Pink, various colors; Clove Pink;\r\nFoxglove, purple and white; Gentian, purple and yellow; Hollyhock,\r\nvarious colors; *Lily of the Valley; American Phlox, various colors;\r\nScarlet Lychnis; Monkshood, white and blue; *Spirea, white, and pink;\r\n*Ragged Robin, pink; Rudbeckia, yellow, and purple; Sweet William, in\r\nvariety. Those marked with a star cannot be obtained from seed, but must\r\nbe propagated by roots, layers, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Herbaceous Roots._\r\n\r\nThese are such as die to the root, in the Fall, and come up again in the\r\nSpring, such as Paeonies, crimson, white, sweet-scented, and\r\nstraw-colored; Artemisia, of many colors; White and Purple\r\nFleur-de-lis; White, Tiger, Fire, and other Lilies; Little Blue Iris;\r\nChrysanthemums, &c. These are propagated by dividing the roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shrubs._\r\n\r\nThe following are the finest _Shrubs for yards_: Lilacs, (which, by\r\nbudding, can have white and purple on the same tree,) Double Syringas,\r\nDouble Althaeas, Corchorus Japonicus, Snow-berry, Double-flowering\r\nAlmond, Pyrus Japonica, Common Barberry, Burning Bush, Rose Acacia,\r\nYellow Laburnum. The following are the finest Roses: Moss Rose, White,\r\nand Red; Double and Single Yellow Rose, (the last needs a gravelly soil\r\nand northern exposure;) Yellow Multiflora; La Belle Africana; Small\r\nEglantine, for borders; Champney's Blush Rose; Noisette; Greville, (very\r\nfine;) Damask; Blush, White, and Cabbage Roses. Moss Roses, when budded\r\non other rose bushes, last only three years.\r\n\r\n_Shade Trees._ The following are among the finest: Mountain Ash;\r\nAilanthus, or Tree of Heaven, (grows very fast;) Tulip Tree; Linden;\r\nElm; Locust; Maple; Dog Wood; Horse Chestnut; Catalpa; Hemlock; Silver\r\nFir; and Cedar. These should be grouped, in such a manner that trees of\r\ndifferent shades of green, and of different heights, should stand in the\r\nsame group.\r\n\r\nThe Autumn is the best time for transplanting trees. Take as much of the\r\nroot, as possible, especially the little fibres, which should never\r\nbecome dry. If kept long, before they are set out, put wet moss around\r\nthem, and water them. Dig holes, larger than the extent of the roots;\r\nlet one person hold the tree in its former position, and another place\r\nthe roots, carefully, as they were before, cutting off any broken or\r\nwounded root. _Be careful not to let the tree be more than an inch\r\ndeeper than it was before._ Let the soil be soft, and well manured;\r\nshake the tree, as the soil is shaken in, that it may mix well among\r\nthe small fibres. Do not tread the earth down, while filling the hole;\r\nbut, when it is full, raise a slight mound, of, say, four inches, and\r\nthen tread it down. Make a little basin, two inches deep, around the\r\nstem, to hold water, and fill it. Never cut off leaves nor branches,\r\nunless some of the roots are lost. Tie the trees to a stake, and they\r\nwill be more likely to live. Water them often.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the Care of House-Plants._\r\n\r\nThe soil of house-plants should be renewed every year, as previously\r\ndirected. In Winter, they should be kept as dry as they can be without\r\nwilting. Many house-plants are injured by giving them too much water,\r\nwhen they have little light and fresh air. This makes them grow\r\nspindling. The more fresh air, warmth, and light, they have, the more\r\nwater is needed. They ought not to be kept very warm in Winter, nor\r\nexposed to great changes of atmosphere. Forty degrees is a proper\r\ntemperature for plants in Winter, when they have little sun and air.\r\nWhen plants have become spindling, cut off their heads, entirely, and\r\ncover the pot in the earth, where it has the morning sun, only. A new\r\nand flourishing head will spring out. Few house-plants can bear the sun\r\nat noon. When insects infest plants, set them in a closet, or under a\r\nbarrel, and burn tobacco. The smoke kills any insect enveloped in it.\r\nWhen plants are frozen, cold water, and a gradual restoration of warmth,\r\nare the best remedies. Never use very cold water for plants, at any\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[T] His 'Farmers' Companion' was written expressly for the larger series\r\nof 'THE SCHOOL LIBRARY,' issued by the publishers of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nON THE PROPAGATION OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulbous roots are propagated by offsets; some growing on the top, others\r\naround the sides. Many plants are propagated by cutting off twigs, and\r\nsetting them in earth, so that two or three eyes are covered. To do\r\nthis, select a side shoot, ten inches long, two inches of it, being of\r\nthe preceding year's growth, and the rest, the growth of the season when\r\nit is set out. Do this, when the sap is running, and put a piece of\r\ncrockery at the bottom of the shoot, when it is buried. One eye, at\r\nleast, must be under the soil. Water it, and shade it in hot weather.\r\nPlants are also propagated by layers. To do this, take a shoot, which\r\ncomes up near the root, bend it down, so as to bring several eyes under\r\nthe soil, leaving the top above ground. If the shoot be cut half\r\nthrough, in a slanting direction, at one of these eyes, before burying\r\nit, the result is more certain. Roses, honeysuckles, and many other\r\nshrubs, are readily propagated thus. They will generally take root, by\r\nbeing simply buried; but cutting them, as here directed, is the best\r\nmethod. Layers are more certain than cuttings. For all woody plants,\r\nbudding and grafting are favorite methods of propagation. In all such\r\nplants, there is an outer and inner bark; the latter containing the sap\r\nvessels, in which the nourishment of the tree ascends.\r\n\r\nThe success of grafting, or inoculating, consists in so placing the bud\r\nor graft, that the sap vessels of the inner bark shall exactly join\r\nthose of the plant into which they are grafted, so that the sap may pass\r\nfrom one into the other.\r\n\r\nThe following are directions for _budding_, which may be performed at\r\nany time from July to September.\r\n\r\nSelect a smooth place, on the stock into which you are to insert the\r\nbud. Make a horizontal cut, across the rind, through to the firm wood;\r\nand from the middle of this, make a slit downward, perpendicularly, an\r\ninch or more long, through to the wood. Raise the bark of the stock, on\r\neach side of the perpendicular cut, for the admission of the bud, as is\r\nshown in the annexed engraving, (Fig. 40.) Then take a shoot of this\r\nyear's growth, and slice from it a bud, taking an inch below and an\r\ninch above it, and some portion of the wood under it. Then carefully\r\nslip off the woody part, under the bud. Examine whether the eye or gem\r\nof the bud be perfect. If a little hole appears in that part, the bud\r\nhas lost its root, and another must be selected. Insert the bud, so that\r\n_a_, of the bud, shall pass to a, of the stock; then _b_, of the bud,\r\nmust be cut off, to match the cut, b, in the stock, and fitted exactly\r\nto it, as it is this alone which insures success. Bind the parts, with\r\nfresh bass, or woollen yarn, beginning a little below the bottom of the\r\nperpendicular slit, and winding it closely round every part, except just\r\nover the eye of the bud, until you arrive above the horizontal cut. Do\r\nnot bind it too tightly, but just sufficient to exclude air, sun, and\r\nwet. This is to be removed, after the bud is firmly fixed, and begins to\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nSeed-fruit can be budded into any other seed-fruit, and stone-fruit into\r\nany other stone-fruit; but stone and seed-fruits, cannot be thus\r\nmingled.\r\n\r\nRose bushes can have a variety of kinds budded into the same stock.\r\nHardy roots are the best stocks. The branch above the bud, must be cut\r\noff, the next March or April after the bud is put in. Apples and pears,\r\nare more easily propagated by ingrafting, than by budding.\r\n\r\nIngrafting is a similar process to budding, with this advantage; that it\r\ncan be performed on large trees, whereas budding can be applied only on\r\nsmall ones. The two common kinds of ingrafting, are whip-grafting, and\r\nsplit-grafting. The first kind is for young trees, and the other for\r\nlarge ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe time for ingrafting, is from May to October. The cuttings must be\r\ntaken from horizontal shoots, between Christmas and March, and kept in a\r\ndamp cellar. In performing the operation, cut off, in a sloping\r\ndirection, (as seen in Fig. 41,) the tree or limb to be grafted. Then\r\ncut off, in a corresponding slant, the slip to be grafted on. Then put\r\nthem together, so that the inner bark of each shall match, exactly, on\r\none side, and tie them firmly together, with woollen yarn. It is not\r\nessential that both be of equal size; if the bark of each meet together\r\nexactly on _one_ side, it answers the purpose. But the two must not\r\ndiffer much, in size. The slope should be an inch and a half, or more,\r\nin length. After they are tied together, the place should be covered\r\nwith a salve or composition of beeswax and rosin. A mixture of clay and\r\ncowdung will answer the same purpose. This last must be tied on with a\r\ncloth. Grafting is more convenient than budding, as grafts can be sent\r\nfrom a great distance; whereas buds must be taken in July or August,\r\nfrom a shoot of the present year's growth, and cannot be sent to any\r\ngreat distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nThis engraving, (Fig. 42,) exhibits the mode called stock-grafting; _a_,\r\nbeing the limb of a large tree which is sawed off and split, and is to\r\nbe held open by a small wedge, till the grafts are put in. A graft,\r\ninserted in the limb, is shown at _b_, and at _c_, is one not inserted,\r\nbut designed to be put in at _d_, as two grafts can be put into a large\r\nstock. In inserting the graft, be careful to make the edge of the inner\r\nbark of the graft meet exactly the edge of the inner bark of the stock;\r\nfor on this, success depends. After the grafts are put in, the wedge\r\nmust be withdrawn, and the whole of the stock be covered with the thick\r\nsalve or composition before mentioned, reaching from where the grafts\r\nare inserted, to the bottom of the slit. Be careful not to knock or move\r\nthe grafts, after they are put in.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pruning._\r\n\r\nThe following rules for pruning, are from a distinguished\r\nhorticulturist. Prune off all dead wood, and all the little twigs on the\r\nmain limbs. Retrench branches, so as to give light and ventilation to\r\nthe interior of the tree. Select the straight and perpendicular shoots,\r\nwhich give little or no fruit, while those which are most nearly\r\nhorizontal, and somewhat curving, give fruit abundantly, and of good\r\nquality. Superfluous and ill-placed buds may be rubbed off, at any time;\r\nand no buds, pushing out after Midsummer, should be spared. In choosing\r\nbetween shoots to be retained, preserve the lowest placed; and, on\r\nlateral shoots, those which are nearest the origin. When branches cross\r\neach other, so as to rub, remove one or the other. Remove all suckers\r\nfrom the roots of trees or shrubs. Prune after the sap is in full\r\ncirculation, (except in the case of grapes,) as the wounds then heal\r\nbest. Some think it best to prune before the sap begins to run.\r\nPruning-shears, and a pruning-pole, with a chisel at the end, can be\r\nprocured of those who deal in agricultural utensils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thinning._\r\n\r\nAs it is the office of the leaves to absorb nourishment from the\r\natmosphere, they should never be removed, except to mature the wood or\r\nfruit. In doing this, remove such leaves as shade the fruit, as soon as\r\nit is ready to ripen. To do it earlier, impairs the growth. Do it\r\ngradually, at two different times. Thinning the fruit is important, as\r\ntending to increase its size and flavor, and also to promote the\r\nlongevity of the tree. If the fruit be thickly set, take off one half,\r\nat the time of setting. Revise in June, and then in July, taking off all\r\nthat may be spared. One _very large_ apple to every square foot, is a\r\nrule that may be a sort of guide, in other cases. According to this, two\r\nhundred large apples would be allowed to a tree, whose extent is fifteen\r\nfeet by twelve. If any person think this thinning excessive, let him try\r\ntwo similar trees, and thin one as directed, and leave the other\r\nunthinned. It will be found that the thinned tree will produce an equal\r\nweight, and fruit of much finer flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nON THE CULTIVATION OF FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a little attention to this matter, a lady, with the help of her\r\nchildren, can obtain a rich abundance of all kinds of fruit. The writer\r\nhas resided in families, where little boys, of eight, ten, and twelve\r\nyears old, amused themselves, under the direction of their mother, in\r\nplanting walnuts, chestnuts, and hazelnuts, for future time; as well as\r\nin planting and inoculating young fruit-trees, of all descriptions. A\r\nmother, who will take pains to inspire a love for such pursuits, in her\r\nchildren, and who will aid and superintend them, will save them from\r\nmany temptations; and, at a trifling expense, secure to them and herself\r\na rich reward, in the choicest fruits. The information given in this\r\nwork, on this subject, may be relied on, as sanctioned by the most\r\nexperienced nursery-men.\r\n\r\nThe soil, for a nursery, should be rich, well dug, dressed with\r\nwell-decayed manure, free from weeds, and protected from cold winds.\r\nFruit seeds should be planted in the Autumn, an inch and a half or two\r\ninches deep, in ridges four or five feet apart, pressing the earth\r\nfirmly over the seeds. While growing, they should be thinned out,\r\nleaving the best ones a foot and a half apart. The soil should be kept\r\nloose, soft, and free from weeds. They should be inoculated or\r\ningrafted, when of the size of a pipe stem; and in a year after this,\r\nmay be transplanted to their permanent stand. Peach trees sometimes bear\r\nin two years from budding, and in four years from planting, if well\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nIn a year after transplanting, take pains to train the head aright.\r\nStraight, upright branches, produce _gourmands_, or twigs bearing only\r\nleaves. The side branches, which are angular or curved, yield the most\r\nfruit. For this reason, the limbs should be trained in curves, and\r\nperpendicular twigs should be cut off, if there be need of pruning. The\r\nlast of June is the time for this. Grass should never be allowed to grow\r\nwithin four feet of a large tree, and the soil should be kept loose, to\r\nadmit air to the roots. Trees in orchards should be twenty-five feet\r\napart. The soil _under_ the top soil, has much to do with the health of\r\ntrees. If it be what is called _hard-pan_, the trees will deteriorate.\r\nTrees need to be manured, and to have the soil kept open and free from\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\n_Filberts_ can be raised in any part of this Country. _Figs_ can be\r\nraised in the Middle States. For this purpose, in the Autumn, loosen the\r\nroots, on one side, and bend the tree down to the earth, on the other;\r\nthen cover it with a mound of straw, earth, and boards; and early in the\r\nSpring raise it up, and cover the roots. _Currants_ grow well in any but\r\na wet soil. They are propagated by cuttings. The old wood should be\r\nthinned in the Fall, and manure be put on. They can be trained into\r\nsmall trees. _Gooseberries_ are propagated by layers and cuttings. They\r\nare best, when kept from suckers and trained like trees. One third of\r\nthe old wood should be removed every Autumn. _Raspberries_ do best, when\r\nshaded during a part of the day. They are propagated by layers, slips,\r\nand suckers. There is one kind, which bears monthly. _Strawberries_\r\nrequire a light soil and vegetable manure. They should be transplanted\r\nin April or September, and be set eight inches apart, in rows nine\r\ninches asunder, and in beds which are two feet wide, with narrow alleys\r\nbetween them. A part of these plants are _non-bearers_. These have large\r\nflowers, with showy stamens and high black anthers. The _bearers_ have\r\nshort stamens, a great number of pistils, and the flowers are every way\r\nless showy. In blossom-time, pull out all the non-bearers. Some think it\r\nbest to leave one non-bearer to every twelve bearers; but others pull\r\nthem all out. Many beds never produce any fruit, because all the plants\r\nin them are non-bearers. Weeds should be kept from the vines. When the\r\nvines are matted with young plants, the best way is to dig over the\r\nbeds, in cross lines, so as to leave some of the plants standing in\r\nlittle squares, while the rest are turned under the soil. This should be\r\ndone over a second time in the same year.\r\n\r\n_Grapes._ To raise this fruit, manure the soil, and keep it soft, and\r\nfree from weeds. A gravelly or sandy soil, and a south exposure, are\r\nbest. Transplant the vines in the early Spring, or, better, in the Fall.\r\nPrune them, the first year, so as to have only two main branches, taking\r\noff all other shoots, as fast as they come. In November, cut off all of\r\nthese two branches, except four eyes. The second year, in the Spring,\r\nloosen the earth around the roots, and allow only two branches to grow,\r\nand every month, take off all side shoots. When they are very strong,\r\npreserve only a part, and cut off the rest in the Fall. In November, cut\r\noff all the two main stems, except eight eyes. After the second year no\r\nmore pruning is needed, except to reduce the side shoots, for the\r\npurpose of increasing the fruit. All the pruning of grapes, (except\r\nnipping side shoots,) must be done when the sap is not running, or they\r\nwill bleed to death. Train them on poles, or lattices, to expose them to\r\nthe air and sun. Cover tender vines in the Autumn. Grapes are propagated\r\nby cuttings, layers, and seeds. For cuttings, select, in the Autumn,\r\nwell-ripened wood, of the former year, and take five joints for each.\r\nBury them, till April; then soak them, for some hours, and set them out,\r\n_aslant_, so that all the eyes but one shall be covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Preserve Fruit._\r\n\r\nRaspberries and Strawberries can be preserved, in perfect flavor, in the\r\nfollowing manner. Take a pound of nice sifted sugar for each pound of\r\nfruit. Put them in alternate layers, of fruit and sugar, till the jar is\r\nentirely full, then cork it, and seal it air tight.\r\n\r\nCurrants and Gooseberries may be perfectly preserved thus. Gather them,\r\nwhen dry, selecting only the solid ones. Take off the stalks, and put\r\nthem in dry junk-bottles. Set them, _uncorked_, in a kettle of water,\r\nand slowly raise it to boiling heat, in order to drive the air out of\r\nthe bottles. Then take out the bottles, cork them, and seal them air\r\ntight. Keep them in a dry place, where they will not freeze. The success\r\nof this method depends on excluding air and water.\r\n\r\nApples, Grapes, and such like fruit can be preserved, by packing them,\r\nwhen dry and solid, in dry sand or sawdust, putting alternate layers of\r\nfruit and sawdust or sand. Some sawdust gives a bad flavor to the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modes of Preserving Fruit Trees._\r\n\r\nHeaps of ashes, or tanner's bark, around peach trees, prevent the attack\r\nof the worm. The _yellows_, is a disease of peach trees, which is spread\r\nby the pollen of the blossom. When a tree begins to turn yellow, take it\r\naway, with all its roots, before it blossoms again, or it will infect\r\nother trees. Planting tansy around the roots of fruit trees, is a sure\r\nprotection against worms, as it prevents the moth from depositing her\r\negg. Equal quantities of salt and saltpetre, put around the trunk of a\r\npeach tree, half a pound to a tree, improves the size and flavor of the\r\nfruit. Apply this about the first of April, and if any trees have worms\r\nalready in them, put on half the quantity, in addition, in June. To\r\nyoung trees, just set out, apply one ounce, in April, and another in\r\nJune, close to the stem. Sandy soil is best for peaches.\r\n\r\nApple trees are preserved from insects, by a wash of strong ley to the\r\nbody and limbs, which, if old, should be first scraped. Caterpillars\r\nshould be removed, by cutting down their nests in a damp day. Boring a\r\nhole, in a tree infested with worms, and filling it with sulphur, will\r\noften drive them off immediately.\r\n\r\nThe _fire-blight_, or _brulure_, in pear trees, can be stopped, by\r\ncutting off all the blighted branches. It is supposed, by some, to be\r\nowing to an excess of sap, which is remedied by diminishing the roots.\r\n\r\nThe _curculio_, which destroys plums, and other stone fruit, can be\r\nchecked only by gathering up all the fruit that falls, (which contains\r\ntheir eggs,) and destroying it. The _canker-worm_ can be checked, by\r\napplying a bandage around the body of the tree, and every evening\r\nsmearing it with fresh tar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery woman should know how to direct in regard to the proper care of\r\ndomestic animals, as they often suffer from the negligence of domestics.\r\n\r\nThe following information, in reference to the care of a horse and cow,\r\nmay be useful. A stable should not be very light nor very dark; its\r\nfloor should be either plank or soil, as brick or stone pavements injure\r\nthe feet. It should be well cleaned, every morning. A horse, kept in a\r\nstable, should be rubbed and brushed every day. A stable-horse needs as\r\nmuch daily exercise as trotting three miles will give him. Food or drink\r\nshould never be given, when a horse is very warm with exercise, as it\r\ncauses disease. A horse should be fed, three times a day. Hay,\r\nsheaf-oats, shorts, corn-meal, and bran, are the best food for horses.\r\nWhen a horse is travelling, order six quarts of oats in the morning,\r\nfour at noon, and six at night, and direct that neither food nor water\r\nbe given till he is cool.\r\n\r\nKeep a horse's legs free from mud, or disease will often result from\r\nthe neglect. A horse, much used, should be shod as often as once in two\r\nmonths. Fish-oil and strong perfumes, on the skin, keep flies from\r\nannoying a horse. Some horses are made fractious by having the\r\ncheck-rein so tight as to weary the muscles.\r\n\r\nA cow should be watered three times a day, and fed with hay, potatoes,\r\ncarrots, and boiled corn. Turnips and cabbages give a bad taste to the\r\nmilk. Give a handful of salt to a cow, twice a week, and occasionally\r\ngive the same quantity to a horse. Let them drink _pure_ water. A\r\nwell-fed cow gives double the milk that she will if not fed well. A cow\r\nshould go unmilked, for two months before calving, and her milk should\r\nnot be used till four days after. The calf must run with the cow for\r\nfour days, and then be shut from her, except thrice a day, when it\r\nshould take as much food as it wants, and then the cow should be milked\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nHens sit twenty days, and should be well fed and watered, during this\r\ntime. The first food for chickens should be coarse dry meal. Cold and\r\ndamp weather is bad for all young fowls, and they should be well\r\nprotected from it. Pepper-berries are good for fowls which have diseases\r\ncaused by damp and cold weather.\r\n\r\nIn Winter, much fuel may be saved, and comfort secured, by stuffing\r\ncotton into all cracks about the windows and the surbases of rooms, and\r\nby listing the doors. Cover strips of wood with baize, and nail them\r\ntight against a door, on the casing.\r\n\r\nThe following are the causes of smoky chimneys. Short and broad flues,\r\nrunning up straight, as a narrow flue, with a bend in it, draws best.\r\nLarge openings, at the top, draw the wind down, and should be remedied,\r\nby having the summits made tapering. A house higher than a chimney near\r\nit, sometimes makes the chimney smoke, and the evil should be remedied,\r\nby raising the chimney. Too large a throat to the fireplace, sometimes\r\ncauses a chimney to smoke, and can be remedied, by a false back, or by\r\nlowering the front, with sheet iron. Shallow fireplaces give out more\r\nheat, and draw as well, as deep ones.\r\n\r\n_House-cleaning_ should be done in dry warm weather. Several friends of\r\nthe writer maintain, that cleaning paint, and windows, and floors, in\r\n_hard_, _cold_ water, without any soap, using a flannel washcloth, is\r\nmuch better than using warm suds. It is worth trying. In cleaning in the\r\ncommon way, sponges are best for windows, and clean water only should be\r\nused. They should be first wiped with linen, and then with old silk. The\r\noutside of windows should be washed with a long brush, made for the\r\npurpose; and they should be rinsed, by throwing upon them water,\r\ncontaining a little saltpetre.\r\n\r\nWhen inviting company, mention, in the note, the day of the month and\r\nweek, and the hour for coming. Provide a place for ladies to dress their\r\nhair, with a glass, pins, and combs. A pitcher of cold water, and a\r\ntumbler, should be added. When the company is small, it is becoming a\r\ncommon method for the table to be set at one end of the room, the lady\r\nof the house to pour out tea, and the gentlemen of the party to wait on\r\nthe ladies and themselves. When tea is sent round, always send a teapot\r\nof hot water to weaken it, and a slop-bowl, or else many persons will\r\ndrink their tea much stronger than they wish.\r\n\r\nLet it ever be remembered, that the burning of lights and the breath of\r\nguests, are constantly exhausting the air of its healthful principle;\r\ntherefore avoid crowding many guests into one room. Do not tempt the\r\npalate by a great variety of unhealthful dainties. Have a warm room for\r\ndeparting guests, that they may not become chilled before they go out.\r\n\r\nA parlor should be furnished with candle and fire screens, for those who\r\nhave weak eyes; and if, at table, a person sits with the back near the\r\nfire, a screen should be hung on the back of the chair, as it is very\r\ninjurious to the whole system to have the back heated.\r\n\r\nPretty baskets, for flowers or fruits, on centre tables, can be made\r\nthus. Knit, with coarse needles, all the various shades of green and\r\nbrown, into a square piece. Press it with a hot iron, and then ravel it\r\nout. Buy a pretty shaped wicker basket, or make one of stiff millinet,\r\nor thin pasteboard, cut the worsted into bunches, and sew them on, to\r\nresemble moss. Then line the basket, and set a cup or dish of water in\r\nit, to hold flowers, or use it for a fruit-basket. Handsome fireboards\r\nare made, by nailing black foundation-muslin to a frame the size of the\r\nfireplace; and then cutting out flowers, from wall-paper, and pasting\r\nthem on the muslin, according to the fancy.\r\n\r\nIndia rubber, melted in lamp-oil, and brushed over common shoes, keeps\r\nwater out, perfectly. Keep small whisk brooms, wherever gentlemen hang\r\ntheir clothes, both up stairs and down, and get them to use them if you\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nBoil new earthen in bran-water, putting the articles in, when cold. Do\r\nthe same with porcelain kettles. Never leave wooden vessels out of\r\ndoors, as they fall to pieces. In Winter, lift the handle of a pump, and\r\ncover it with blankets, to keep it from freezing.\r\n\r\nBroken earthen and china, can often be mended, by tying it up, and\r\nboiling it in milk. _Diamond cement_, when genuine, is very effectual\r\nfor the same purpose. Old putty can be softened by muriatic acid. Nail\r\nslats across nursery windows. Scatter ashes on slippery ice, at the\r\ndoor; or rather, remove it. Clarify impure water with powdered alum, a\r\nteaspoonful to a barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA volume, entitled the _American Housekeeper's Receipt Book_, prepared\r\nby the author of this work, under the supervision of several experienced\r\nhousekeepers, is designed as a Supplement to this treatise on Domestic\r\nEconomy. The following Preface and Analysis of the Contents will\r\nindicate its design more fully:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preface (for the American Housekeeper's Receipt Book.)_\r\n\r\nThe following objects are aimed at in this work:\r\n\r\n_First_, to furnish an _original_ collection of receipts, which shall\r\nembrace a great variety of simple and well-cooked dishes, designed for\r\nevery-day comfort and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n_Second_, to include in the collection only such receipts as have been\r\ntested by superior housekeepers, and warranted to be _the best_. It is\r\nnot a book made up in _any_ department by copying from other books, but\r\nentirely from the experience of the best practical housekeepers.\r\n\r\n_Third_, to express every receipt in language which is short, simple,\r\nand perspicuous, and yet to give all directions so minutely as that the\r\nbook can be kept in the kitchen, and be used by any domestic who can\r\nread, as a guide in _every one_ of her employments in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, to furnish such directions in regard to small dinner-parties\r\nand evening company as will enable any young housekeeper to perform her\r\npart, on such occasions, with ease, comfort, and success.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_, to present a good supply of the rich and elegant dishes\r\ndemanded at such entertainments, and yet to set forth so large and\r\ntempting a variety of what is safe, healthful, and good, in connexion\r\nwith such warnings and suggestions as it is hoped may avail to promote a\r\nmore healthful fashion in regard both to entertainments and to daily\r\ntable supplies. No book of this kind will sell without an adequate\r\nsupply of the rich articles which custom requires, and in furnishing\r\nthem, the writer has aimed to follow the example of Providence, which\r\nscatters profusely both good and ill, and combines therewith the caution\r\nalike of experience, revelation, and conscience, \"choose ye that which\r\nis good, that ye and your seed may live.\"\r\n\r\n_Sixth_, in the work on Domestic Economy, together with this, to which\r\nit is a Supplement, the writer has attempted to secure, in a cheap and\r\npopular form, for American housekeepers, a work similar to an English\r\nwork which she has examined, entitled the _Encyclopaedia of Domestic\r\nEconomy, by Thomas Webster and Mrs. Parkes_, containing over twelve\r\nhundred octavo pages of closely-printed matter, treating on every\r\ndepartment of Domestic Economy; a work which will be found much more\r\nuseful to English women, who have a plenty of money and well-trained\r\nservants, than to American housekeepers. It is believed that most in\r\nthat work which would be of any practical use to American housekeepers,\r\nwill be found in this work and the Domestic Economy.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, the writer has aimed to avoid the defects complained of by\r\nmost housekeepers in regard to works of this description issued in this\r\ncountry, or sent from England, such as that, in some cases, the receipts\r\nare so rich as to be both expensive and unhealthful; in others, that\r\nthey are so vaguely expressed as to be very imperfect guides; in\r\nothers, that the processes are so elaborate and _fussing_ as to make\r\ndouble the work that is needful; and in others, that the topics are so\r\nlimited that some departments are entirely omitted, and all are\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nIn accomplishing these objects, the writer has received contributions of\r\nthe pen, and verbal communications from some of the most judicious and\r\npractical housekeepers, in almost every section of this country, so that\r\nthe work is fairly entitled to the name it bears of the _American_\r\nHousekeeper's Receipt Book.\r\n\r\nThe following embraces most of the topics contained in this work.\r\n\r\nSuggestions to young housekeepers in regard to style, furniture, and\r\ndomestic arrangements.\r\n\r\nSuggestions in regard to different modes to be pursued both with foreign\r\nand American domestics.\r\n\r\nOn providing a proper supply of family stores, on the economical care\r\nand use of them, and on the furniture and arrangement of a store-closet.\r\n\r\nOn providing a proper supply of utensils to be used in cooking, with\r\ndrawings to illustrate.\r\n\r\nOn the proper construction of ovens, and directions for heating and\r\nmanaging them.\r\n\r\nDirections for securing good yeast and good bread.\r\n\r\nAdvice in regard to marketing, the purchase of wood, &c.\r\n\r\nReceipts for breakfast dishes, biscuits, warm cakes, tea cakes, &c.\r\n\r\nReceipts for puddings, cakes, pies, preserves, pickles, sauces, catsups,\r\nand also for cooking all the various kinds of meats, soups, and\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nThe above receipts are arranged so that the more healthful and simple\r\nones are put in one portion, and the richer ones in another.\r\n\r\nHealthful and favourite articles of food for young children.\r\n\r\nReceipts for a variety of temperance drinks.\r\n\r\nDirections for making tea, coffee, chocolate, and other warm drinks.\r\n\r\nDirections for cutting up meats, and for salting down, corning, curing,\r\nand smoking.\r\n\r\nDirections for making butter and cheese, as furnished by a practical and\r\nscientific manufacturer of the same, of Goshen, Conn., that land of rich\r\nbutter and cheese.\r\n\r\nA guide to a selection of a regular course of family dishes, which will\r\nembrace _a successive variety_, and unite convenience with good taste\r\nand comfortable living.\r\n\r\nReceipts for articles for the sick, and drawings of conveniences for\r\ntheir comfort and relief.\r\n\r\nReceipts for articles for evening parties and dinner parties, with\r\ndrawings to show the proper manner of setting tables, and of supplying\r\nand arranging dishes, both on these, and on ordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nAn outline of arrangements for a family in moderate circumstances,\r\nembracing the systematic details of work for each domestic, and the\r\nproper mode of doing it, as furnished by an accomplished housekeeper.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the different nature of food and drinks, and their relation\r\nto the laws of health.\r\n\r\nSuggestions to the domestics of a family, designed to promote a proper\r\nappreciation of the dignity and importance of their station, and a\r\ncheerful and faithful performance of their duties.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous suggestions and receipts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLOSSARY\r\n\r\nOF SUCH WORDS AND PHRASES AS MAY NOT EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE YOUNG\r\nREADER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Many words, not contained in this GLOSSARY, will be found\r\nexplained in the body of the Work, in the places where they first occur.\r\nFor these, see INDEX.]\r\n\r\n_Academy, the Boston_, an association in Boston, established for the\r\npurpose of promoting the study and culture of the art of music.\r\n\r\n_Action brought by the Commonwealth_, a prosecution conducted in the\r\nname of the public, or by the authority of the State.\r\n\r\n_Alcoholic_, made of, or containing, alcohol, an inflammable liquid,\r\nwhich is the basis of ardent spirits.\r\n\r\n_Alkali_, (plural _alkalies_,) a chemical substance, which has the\r\nproperty of combining with, and neutralizing the properties of, acids,\r\nproducing salts by the combination. Alkalies change most of the\r\nvegetable blues and purples to green, red to purple, and yellow to\r\nbrown. _Caustic alkali_, an alkali deprived of all impurities, being\r\nthereby rendered more caustic and violent in its operation. This term is\r\nusually applied to pure potash. _Fixed alkali_, an alkali that emits no\r\ncharacteristic smell, and cannot be volatilized or evaporated without\r\ngreat difficulty. Potash and soda are called the fixed alkalies. Soda is\r\nalso called a _fossil_, or _mineral_, _alkali_, and potash, the\r\n_vegetable alkali_. _Volatile alkali_, an elastic, transparent,\r\ncolorless, and consequently invisible gas, known by the name of ammonia,\r\nor ammoniacal gas.

She was not a woman of very great intellect; but was deservedly\r\npopular, throughout her reign, being a model of conjugal and maternal\r\nduty, and always intending to do good. She was honored with the title of\r\n'Good Queen Anne', which showed the opinion entertained of her virtues\r\nby the people.\r\n\r\n_Anotta_, _Annotto_, _Arnotta_, or _Rocou_, a soft, brownish-red\r\nsubstance, prepared from the reddish pulp surrounding the seeds of a\r\ntree, which grows in the West Indies, Guiana, and other parts of South\r\nAmerica, called the _Bixa orellana_.

It\r\nderives its name from having been originally used by the Indians, as a\r\nremedy for the poison of their arrows, by mashing and applying it to the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n_Articulating process_, the protuberance, or projecting part of a bone,\r\nby which it is so joined to another bone, as to enable the two to move\r\nupon each other.\r\n\r\n_Asceticism_, the state of an ascetic, or hermit, who flies from society\r\nand lives in retirement, or who practises a greater degree of\r\nmortification and austerity than others do, or who inflicts\r\nextraordinary severities upon himself.\r\n\r\n_Astral lamp_, a lamp, the principle of which was invented by Benjamin\r\nThompson, (a native of Massachusetts, and afterwards Count Rumford,) in\r\nwhich the oil is contained in a large horizontal ring, having, at the\r\ncentre, a burner, which communicates with the ring by tubes. The ring is\r\nplaced a little below the level of the flame, and, from its large\r\nsurface, affords a supply of oil for many hours.\r\n\r\n_Astute_, shrewd.\r\n\r\n_Auld Robin Gray_, a celebrated Scotch song, in which a young woman\r\nlaments her having married an old rich man, whom she did not love, for\r\nthe sake of providing for her poor parents.\r\n\r\n_Auricles_, (from a Latin word, signifying the ear,) the name given to\r\ntwo appendages of the heart, from their fancied resemblance to the ear.\r\n\r\n_Baglivi_, (George,) an eminent physician, who was born at Ragusa, in\r\n1668, and was educated at Naples and Paris. Pope Clement XIV., on the\r\nground of his great merit, appointed him, while a very young man,\r\nProfessor of Anatomy and Surgery in the College of Sapienza, at Rome. He\r\nwrote several works, and did much to promote the cause of medical\r\nscience. He died, A. D. 1706.\r\n\r\n_Bass_, or bass wood, a large forest tree of America, sometimes called\r\nthe lime-tree. The wood is white and soft, and the bark is sometimes\r\nused for bandages, as mentioned in page 343.\r\n\r\n_Beau Nash_, see _Nash_.\r\n\r\n_Bell, Sir Charles_, a celebrated surgeon, who was born in Edinburgh, in\r\nthe year 1778.

His\r\nwritings are very numerous, and have been much celebrated. Among the\r\nmost important of these, to general readers, are, his Illustrations of\r\nPaley's Natural Theology, (which work forms the second and third volumes\r\nof the larger series of 'THE SCHOOL LIBRARY,' issued by the\r\nPublishers of this volume,) and his treatise on 'The Hand, its\r\nMechanism, and Vital Endowments, as evincing Design.'\r\n\r\n_Bergamot_, a fruit, which was originally produced by ingrafting a\r\nbranch of a citron or lemon tree, upon the stock of a peculiar kind of\r\npear, called the bergamot pear.\r\n\r\n_Biased_, cut diagonally from one corner to another of a square or\r\nrectangular piece of cloth. _Bias pieces_, triangular pieces cut as\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Bituminous_, containing _bitumen_, which is an inflammable mineral\r\nsubstance, resembling tar or pitch in its properties and uses.
