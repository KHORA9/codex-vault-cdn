H. KELLOGG, M.D.,\r\nIn the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publishers of this work offer no apology for presenting it to the\r\nreading public, since the wide prevalence of the evils which it exposes\r\nis sufficient warrant for its publication. The subjects with which it\r\ndeals are of vital consequence to the human race; and it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that every effort should be made to dispel the gross\r\nignorance which almost universally prevails, by the wide diffusion,\r\nin a proper manner, of information of the character contained in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nThis book has been written not for the young only, nor for any single\r\nclass of persons, but for all who are old enough to be capable of\r\nunderstanding and appreciating it. The prime object of its preparation\r\nhas been to call attention to the great prevalence of sexual excesses\r\nof all kinds, and the heinous crimes resulting from some forms of sexual\r\ntransgression, and to point out the terrible results which inevitably\r\nfollow the violation of sexual law.\r\n\r\nIn order to make more clear and comprehensible the teachings of nature\r\nrespecting the laws regulating the sexual function, and the evils\r\nresulting from their violation, it has seemed necessary to preface the\r\npractical part of the subject by a concise description of the anatomy\r\nof reproduction. In this portion of the work especial pains has been\r\ntaken to avoid anything like indelicacy of expression, yet it has not\r\nbeen deemed advisable to sacrifice perspicuity of ideas to any prudish\r\nnotions of modesty. It is hoped that the reader will bear in mind that\r\nthe language of science is always chaste in itself, and that it is only\r\nthrough a corrupt imagination that it becomes invested with impurity.\r\nThe author has constantly endeavored to impart information in the most\r\nstraightforward, simple, and concise manner.\r\n\r\nThe work should be judiciously circulated, and to secure this the\r\npublishers will take care to place it in the hands of agents competent\r\nto introduce it with discretion; yet it may be read without injury by\r\nany one who is sufficiently mature to understand it. Great care has\r\nbeen taken to exclude from its pages those accounts of the habits of\r\nvicious persons, and descriptions of the mechanical accessories of vice,\r\nwith which many works upon sexual subjects abound.\r\n\r\nThe first editions of the work were issued with no little anxiety on\r\nthe part of both author and publishers as to how it would be received\r\nby the reading public. It was anticipated that no little adverse\r\ncriticism, and perhaps severe condemnation, would be pronounced by many\r\nwhose education and general mode of thought had been such as to unfit\r\nthem to appreciate it; but it was hoped that persons of more thoughtful\r\nand unbiased minds would receive the work kindly, and would readily\r\nco-operate with the publishers in its circulation. This anticipation\r\nhas been more than realized. Wherever the book has been introduced,\r\nit has met with a warm reception; and of the several thousand persons\r\ninto whose hands the work has been placed, hundreds have gratefully\r\nacknowledged the benefit which they have received from its perusal,\r\nand it is hoped that a large proportion have been greatly benefited.\r\n\r\nThe cordial reception which the work has met from the press everywhere\r\nhas undoubtedly contributed in great measure to its popularity. The\r\ndemand for the work has exhausted several editions in rapid succession,\r\nand has seemed to require its preparation in the greatly enlarged and\r\nin every way improved form in which it now appears. The addition of\r\ntwo whole chapters for the purpose of bringing the subject directly\r\nbefore the minds of boys and girls in a proper manner, adds greatly\r\nto the interest and value of the work, as there seemed to be a slight\r\ndeficiency in this particular in the former editions.\r\n\r\nJ.

470\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks almost without number have been written upon the subject treated\r\nin this work. Unfortunately, most of these works are utterly unreliable,\r\nbeing filled with gross misrepresentations and exaggerations, and\r\nbeing designed as advertising mediums for ignorant and unscrupulous\r\ncharlatans, or worse than worthless patent nostrums. To add to their\r\npower for evil, many of them abound with pictorial illustrations which\r\nare in no way conducive to virtue or morality, but rather stimulate\r\nthe animal propensities and excite lewd imaginations. Books of this\r\ncharacter are usually widely circulated; and their pernicious\r\ninfluence is fully as great as that of works of a more grossly obscene\r\ncharacter. In most of the few instances in which the evident motive\r\nof the author is not of an unworthy character, the manner of presenting\r\nthe subject is unfortunately such that it more frequently than\r\notherwise has a strong tendency in a direction exactly the opposite\r\nof that intended and desired. The writer of this work has endeavored\r\nto avoid the latter evil by adopting a style of presentation quite\r\ndifferent from that generally pursued. Instead of restricting the\r\nreader's attention rigidly to the sexual function in man, his mind is\r\ndiverted by frequent references to corresponding functions in lower\r\nanimals and in the vegetable kingdom. By this means, not only is an\r\nadditional fund of information imparted, but the sexual function in\r\nman is divested of its sensuality. It is viewed as a fact of natural\r\nhistory, and is associated with the innocence of animal life and the\r\nchaste loveliness of flowers. Thus the subject comes to be regarded\r\nfrom a purely physiological standpoint, and is liberated from the gross\r\nanimal instinct which is the active cause of sensuality.\r\n\r\nThere are so many well-meaning individuals who object to the agitation\r\nof this subject in any manner whatever, that it may be profitable to\r\nconsider in this connection some of the principal objections which are\r\nurged against imparting information on sexual subjects, especially\r\nagainst giving knowledge to the young.\r\n\r\nI. _Sexual matters improper to be spoken of to the young._\r\n\r\nThis objection is often raised, it being urged that these matters are\r\n_too delicate_ to be even suggested to children; that they ought to\r\nbe kept in total ignorance of all sexual matters and relations until\r\nnature indicates that they are fit to receive them. It is doubtless\r\ntrue that children raised in a perfectly natural way would have no\r\nsexual thoughts until puberty, at least, and it would be better if it\r\nmight be so; but from facts pointed out in succeeding portions of this\r\nwork, it is certain that at the present time children nearly always\r\ndo have some vague ideas of sexual relations long before puberty, and\r\noften at a very early age. It is thus apparent that by speaking to\r\nchildren of sexual matters in a proper manner, a new subject is not\r\nintroduced to them, but it is merely presenting to them in a true light\r\na subject of which they already have vague ideas; and thus, by\r\nsatisfying a natural curiosity, they are saved from supplying by their\r\nimaginations distorted images and exaggerated conceptions, and from\r\nseeking to obtain the desired information from evil sources whence they\r\nwould derive untold injury.\r\n\r\nWhat reason is there that the subject of the sexual functions should\r\nbe treated with such maudlin secrecy? Why should the function of\r\ngeneration be regarded as something low and beastly, unfit to be spoken\r\nof by decent people on decent occasions? We can conceive of no answer\r\nexcept the worse than beastly use to which the function has been so\r\ngenerally put by man. There is nothing about the sexual organism which\r\nmakes it less pure than the lungs or the stomach. \"Unto the pure all\r\nthings are pure,\" may have been written especially for our times, when\r\nthere is such a vast amount of mock modesty; when so much pretense of\r\nvirtue covers such a world of iniquity and vice. The young lady who\r\ngoes into a spasm of virtuous hysterics upon hearing the word \"leg,\"\r\nis perhaps just the one who at home riots her imagination in voluptuous\r\nFrench novels, if she commits no grosser breach of chastity. The parents\r\nwho are the most opposed to imparting information to the young are often\r\nthose who have themselves indulged in sexual excesses. In the minds\r\nof such persons the sexual organs and functions, and everything even\r\nremotely connected with them, are associated only with ideas of lust\r\nand gross sensuality. No wonder that they wish to keep such topics in\r\nthe dark. With such thoughts they cannot well bear the scrutiny of\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nSexual subjects are not, of course, proper subjects for conversation\r\nat all times, or at any time in a spirit of levity and flippancy.\r\n\r\nII. _Knowledge is dangerous._\r\n\r\nVery true, knowledge is dangerous, but ignorance is more dangerous\r\nstill; or, rather, partial knowledge is more dangerous than a more\r\ncomplete understanding of facts. Children, young people, will not grow\r\nup in innocent ignorance. If, in obedience to custom, they are not\r\nencouraged to inquire of their parents about the mysteries of life,\r\nthey will seek to satisfy their curiosity by appealing to older or\r\nbetter informed companions. They will eagerly read any book which\r\npromises any hint on the mysterious subject, and will embrace every\r\nopportunity, proper or improper--and most likely to be the latter--of\r\nobtaining the coveted information. Knowledge obtained in this\r\nuncertain and irregular way must of necessity be very unreliable. Many\r\ntimes--generally, in fact--it is of a most corrupting character, and\r\nthe clandestine manner in which it is obtained is itself corrupting\r\nand demoralizing. A child ought to be taught to expect all such\r\ninformation from its parents, and it ought not to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nAgain, while it is true that knowledge is dangerous, it is equally true\r\nthat this dangerous knowledge will be gained sometime, at any rate;\r\nand as it must come, better let it be imparted by the parent, who can\r\nadminister proper warnings and cautions along with it, than by any other\r\nindividual. Thus may the child be shielded from injury to which he would\r\notherwise be certainly exposed.\r\n\r\nIII. _Young people should be left to find out these things for\r\nthemselves._\r\n\r\nIf human beings received much of their knowledge through instinct, as\r\nanimals do, this might be a proper course; but man gets his knowledge\r\nlargely by instruction. Young people will get their first knowledge\r\nof sexual matters mostly by instruction from some source. How much\r\nbetter, then, as we have already shown, to let them obtain this\r\nknowledge from the most natural and most reliable source!\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph from Dr. Ware is to the point:--\r\n\r\n\"But putting aside the question whether we ought to hide this subject\r\nwholly from the young if we could, the truth, it is to be feared, is\r\nthat we cannot if we would. Admitting it to be desirable, every man\r\nof experience in life will pronounce it to be impracticable. If, then,\r\nwe cannot prevent the minds of children from being engaged in some way\r\non this subject, may it not be better to forestall evil impressions\r\nby implanting good ones, or at least to mingle such good ones with the\r\nevil as the nature of the case admits? Let us be at least as wise as\r\nthe crafty enemy of man, and cast in a little wheat with his tares;\r\nand among the most effectual methods of doing this is to impart to the\r\nyoung just and religious views of the nature and purposes of the\r\nrelation which the Creator has established between the two sexes.\"\r\n\r\n_When Shall Information Be Given?_--It is a matter of some difficulty\r\nto decide the exact age at which information on sexual subjects should\r\nbe given to the young. It may be adopted as a safe rule, however, that\r\na certain amount of knowledge should be imparted as soon as there is\r\nmanifested a curiosity in this direction. If there is reason to believe\r\nthat the mind of the child is exercised in this direction, even though\r\nhe may have made no particular inquiries, information should not be\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\n_How to Impart Proper Knowledge._--No little skill may be displayed\r\nin introducing these subjects to the mind of the young person in such\r\na way as to avoid arousing his passions and creating sexual excitement.\r\nPerhaps the general plan followed in the first portion of this work\r\nwill be found a very pleasant and successful method if studied\r\nthoroughly and well executed.\r\n\r\nAll information should not be given at once. First obtain the child's\r\nconfidence, and assure him by candor and unreserve that you will give\r\nhim all needed information; then, as he encounters difficulties, he\r\nwill resort for explanation where he knows he will receive satisfaction.\r\nWhen the little one questions, answer truthfully and carefully.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph by Dr. Wilkinson is suggestive:--\r\n\r\n\"When we are little boys and girls, our first inquiries about our\r\n_whence_ are answered by the authoritative dogma of the 'silver spade;'\r\nwe were dug up with that implement. By degrees the fact comes forth.\r\nThe public, however, remains for ages in the silver-spade condition\r\nof mind with regard to the science of the fact; and the doctors foster\r\nit by telling us that the whole subject is a medical property.... There\r\nis nothing wrong in the knowing; and, though the passions might be\r\nstimulated in the first moments by such information, yet in the second\r\ninstance they will be calmed by it; and, ceasing to be inflamed by the\r\nadditional goad of curiosity and imagination, they will cool down under\r\nthe hydropathic influences of science. Well-stated knowledge did never\r\nyet contribute to human inflammation; and we much question whether the\r\nwhole theory of the silver spade be not a mistake; and whether children\r\nshould not be told the truth from the first; that before desire and\r\nimagination are born, the young mind may receive, in its cool innocency,\r\na knowledge of the future objects of powers and faculties which are\r\nto be subject afterward to such strong excitements.\"\r\n\r\nThe experience of hundreds in the circulation of this work has proven\r\nbeyond all chance for question the truth of the foregoing remarks, and\r\noften in a most striking manner. Scores of persons have written us,\r\n\"I would give all I possess in this world could I have had a copy of\r\n'Plain Facts' placed in my hands when I was a lad,\" or, \"Words cannot\r\nexpress the gratitude I would now feel had some kind friend imparted\r\nto me the invaluable information which this book contains; it would\r\nhave saved me a life of wretchedness.\"\r\n\r\nWe have had the satisfaction of knowing in numerous instances that the\r\nvirtue and happiness of whole families have been secured by the timely\r\nwarnings of danger which parents have obtained from this work. We are\r\nglad to be able to feel that it is now thoroughly demonstrated that\r\nintelligent persons who have given this subject thought universally\r\napprove of the objects of the work and the manner of presenting the\r\nsubject adopted in it. Those who at first question the propriety of\r\ndiscussing the subject so freely and thoroughly as is here done, lose\r\ntheir prejudice entirely upon giving the work a careful perusal. In\r\nnumerous instances it has occurred that those who were most decided\r\nin their denunciations have become the most zealous and efficient\r\nagents in its circulation after becoming more fully acquainted with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEX IN LIVING FORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife, in its great diversity of forms, has ever been a subject of the\r\ndeepest interest to rational beings. Poets have sung of its joys and\r\nsorrows, its brilliant phantasies and harsh realities. Philosophers\r\nhave spent their lives in vain attempts to solve its mysteries; and\r\nsome have held and thought that life was nothing more than a stupendous\r\nfarce, a delusion of the senses. Moralists have sought to impress\r\nmankind with the truth that \"life is real,\" and teeming with grave\r\nresponsibilities. Physiologists have busied themselves in observing\r\nthe phenomena of life, and learning, therefrom, its laws. The subject\r\nis certainly an interesting one, and none could be more worthy of the\r\nmost careful attention.\r\n\r\nLiving Beings.--Man possesses life in common with other beings almost\r\ninfinite in number and variety. The hugest beast that roams the forest\r\nor plows the main is no more a living creature than the smallest insect\r\nor microscopic animalculum. The \"big tree\" of California and the tiny\r\nblade of grass which waves at its foot are alike imbued with life. All\r\nnature teems with life. The practiced eye detects multitudes of living\r\nforms at every glance.\r\n\r\nThe universe of life presents the most marvelous manifestations of the\r\ninfinite power and wisdom of the Creator to be found in all his works.\r\nThe student of biology sees life in myriad forms which are unnoticed\r\nby the casual observer. The microscope reveals whole worlds of life\r\nthat were unknown before the discovery of this wonderful aid to human\r\nvision,--whole tribes of living organisms, each of which, though\r\ninsignificant in size, possesses organs as perfect and as useful to\r\nit in its sphere as do animals of greater magnitude. Under a powerful\r\nmagnifying glass, a drop of water from a stagnant pool is found to be\r\npeopled with curious animated forms; slime from a damp rock, or a speck\r\nof green scum from the surface of a pond, presents a museum of living\r\nwonders. Through this instrument the student of nature learns that life\r\nin its lowest form is represented by a mere atom of living matter, an\r\ninsignificant speck of trembling jelly, transparent and structureless,\r\nhaving no organs of locomotion, yet able to move in any direction; no\r\nnerves or organs of sense, yet possessing a high degree of sensibility;\r\nno mouth, teeth, nor organs of digestion, yet capable of taking food,\r\ngrowing, developing, producing other individuals like itself, becoming\r\naged, infirm, and dying,--such is the life history of a living creature\r\nat the lower extreme of the scale of animated being. As we rise higher\r\nin the scale, we find similar little atoms of life associated together\r\nin a single individual, each doing its proper share of the work\r\nnecessary to maintain the life of the individual as a whole, yet\r\nretaining at the same time its own individual life.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend to still higher forms, we find this association of minute\r\nliving creatures resulting in the production of forms of increasing\r\ncomplicity. As the structure of the individual becomes more complex\r\nand its functions more varied, the greater is the number of separate,\r\nyet associated, organisms to do the work.\r\n\r\nIn man, at the very summit of the scale of animate existence, we find\r\nthe most delicate and wonderfully intricate living mechanism of all.\r\nIn him, as in lower, intermediate forms of life, the life of the\r\nindividual is but a summary of the lives of all numberless minute\r\norganisms of which his body is composed. The individual life is but\r\nthe aggregate life of all the millions of distinct individuals which\r\nare associated together in the human organism.\r\n\r\nAnimals and Vegetables.--The first classification of living creatures\r\nseparates them into two great kingdoms, animals and vegetables.\r\nAlthough it is very easy to define the general characteristics of each\r\nof these classes, it is impossible to fix upon any single peculiarity\r\nwhich will be applicable in every case. Most vegetable organisms remain\r\nstationary, while some possess organs of locomotion, and swim about\r\nin the water in a manner much resembling the movements of certain\r\nanimals. Most vegetables obtain their nutriment from the earth and the\r\nair, while animals subsist on living matter. A few plants seem to take\r\norganic matter for food, some even catching and killing small insects.\r\n\r\nIt is found impossible to draw the precise line between animals and\r\nvegetables, for the reason just mentioned. The two kingdoms blend so\r\nintimately that in some cases it is impossible to tell whether a certain\r\nmicroscopic speck of life is an animal or a vegetable. But since these\r\ndoubtful creatures are usually so minute that several millions of them\r\ncan exist in a single drop of water, it is usually of no practical\r\nimportance whether they are animal or vegetable, or sometimes one and\r\nsometimes the other, as they have been supposed to be by some\r\nbiologists.\r\n\r\nAll living creatures are _organized_ beings. Most possess a structure\r\nand an organism more or less complicated; but some of the lowest forms\r\nare merely little masses of a transparent, homogeneous jelly, known\r\nas protoplasm. Some of the smallest of these are so minute that one\r\nhundred millions of them could occupy the space of a cube one-thousandth\r\nof an inch on each side; yet each one runs its course of life as regularly\r\nas man himself, performing its proper functions even more perfectly,\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\nLife Force.--To every thinking mind the question often recurs, What\r\nmakes the fragrant flower so different from the dead soil from which\r\nit grows? the trilling bird, so vastly superior to the inert atmosphere\r\nin which it flies? What subtle power paints the rose, and tunes the\r\nmerry songster's voice? To explain this mystery, philosophers of olden\r\ntime supposed the existence of a certain peculiar force which is called\r\nlife, or vital force, or vitality. This supposition does nothing more\r\nthan furnish a name for a thing unknown, and the very existence of which\r\nmay fairly be doubted. In fact, any attempt to find a place for such\r\na force, to understand its origin, or harmonize its existence with that\r\nof other well-known forces, is unsuccessful; and the theory of a\r\npeculiar vital force, a presiding entity present in every living thing,\r\nvanishes into thin air to give place to the more rational view of the\r\nmost advanced modern scientists, that vital force, so-called, is only\r\na manifestation of the ordinary forces of nature acting through a\r\npeculiar arrangement of matter. In other words, life depends, not upon\r\na peculiar force, but upon a peculiar arrangement of matter, or\r\norganization. It is simply a peculiar manifestation of the force\r\npossessed by atoms exhibited through a peculiar arrangement of atoms\r\nand molecules. This arrangement is what is known as organization; and\r\nbodies which possess it are known as organized or living bodies. The\r\nterm life may be understood as referring to the phenomena which result\r\nfrom organization.\r\n\r\nThat life results from organization, not organization from life, is\r\nmore consonant with the accepted and established facts of science than\r\nthe contrary view. We might adduce numerous facts and arguments in\r\nsupport of this view of the nature of life, but will not do so here,\r\nas we have considered the subject at some length elsewhere.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Science and the Bible,\" pp. 36-46.]\r\n\r\n_Nutrition_ and _reproduction_ are the two great functions of life,\r\nbeing common not only to all animals, but to both animals and plants,\r\nto all classes of living creatures. The object of the first, is the\r\ndevelopment and maintenance of the individual existence; the second\r\nhas for its end the production of new individuals, or the preservation\r\nof the race. Nutrition is a purely selfish process; reproduction is\r\npurely unselfish in its object; though the human species--unlike the\r\nlower animals, which, while less intelligent, are far more true to\r\nnature--too often pervert its functions to the most grossly selfish\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThe subject of nutrition is an important one, and well worthy the\r\nattention of every person who values life. The general disregard of\r\nthis subject is undoubtedly the cause of a very large share of the ills\r\nto which human flesh is heir; but our limited space forbids its\r\nconsideration here, and we shall confine our attention to reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, reproduction is a function common to all animals\r\nand to all plants. Every organized being has the power to reproduce\r\nitself, or to produce, or aid in producing, other individuals like\r\nitself. It is by means of this function that plants and animals increase\r\nor multiply.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the great diversity of characters illustrated in\r\nanimal and vegetable life, and the infinite variety of conditions and\r\ncircumstances under which organized creatures exist, it is not\r\nsurprising that modes of reproduction should also present great\r\ndiversity both in general character and in detail. We shall find it\r\nboth interesting and instructive to consider some of the many different\r\nmodes of reproduction, or generation, observed in different classes\r\nof living beings, previous to entering upon the specific study of\r\nreproduction in man. Before doing thus, however, let us give brief\r\nattention to a theoretical form of generation, which cannot be called\r\nreproduction, known as\r\n\r\nSpontaneous Generation.--By this term is meant the supposed formation\r\nof living creatures directly from dead matter without the intervention\r\nof other living organisms. The theory is, in substance, an old one.\r\nThe ancients supposed that the frogs and other small reptiles so\r\nabundant in the vicinity of slimy pools and stagnant marshes, were\r\ngenerated spontaneously from the mud and slime in which they lived.\r\nThis theory was, of course, abandoned when the natural history of\r\nreptiles became known.\r\n\r\nFor several thousand years the belief was still held that maggots found\r\nin decaying meat were produced spontaneously; but it was discovered,\r\ncenturies ago, that maggots are not formed if the flesh is protected\r\nfrom flies, since they are the larvae, or young, of a species of this\r\ninsect. A relic of the ancient belief in spontaneous generation is still\r\nfound in the supposition that horse-hair snakes, so-called, are really\r\nformed from the hairs of horses. This belief is quite common, but\r\nscience long ago exposed its falsity.\r\n\r\nWhen the microscope was discovered it revealed a whole new world of\r\ninfinitesimal beings which were at first supposed to be of spontaneous\r\norigin; but careful scientific investigation has shown that even these\r\nmere specks of life are not independent of parentage. M. Pasteur and,\r\nmore recently, Prof. Tyndall, with many other distinguished scientists,\r\nhave demonstrated this fact beyond all reasonable chance for question.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, an established law that _every living organism originates\r\nwith some previously existing living being or beings_.\r\n\r\nIt may be queried, If it be true that life is but a manifestation of\r\nthe ordinary forces of matter,--which are common to both dead and living\r\nmatter,--being dependent upon arrangement, then why may it not be that\r\ndead matter may, through the action of molecular laws, and without the\r\nintervention of any living existence, assume those peculiar forms of\r\narrangement necessary to constitute life, as supposed by the advocates\r\nof the theory in question? It is true that some who recognize the fact\r\nthat life is the result of organization maintain the doctrine of\r\n_spontaneous generation_; that is, the production of life without any\r\nagency other than the recognized forces of nature being brought about\r\nsimply by a fortuitous combination of atoms. Although this doctrine\r\ncannot be said to be inconsistent with the theory of life presented,\r\nyet it is by no means a legitimate or necessary result of it; and\r\nobservation proves its falsity.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of all nature, as almost universally admitted by\r\nscientific men, is that life originated through a creative act by the\r\nfirst Great Cause, who gave to certain bodies the requisite arrangement\r\nor organization to enable them to perform certain functions, and\r\ndelegated to them the power to transmit the same to other matter, and\r\nthus to perpetuate life. The Creator alone has the power to originate\r\nlife. Man, with all his wisdom and attainments, cannot discover the\r\nsecret of organization. He may become familiar with its phenomena, but\r\nhe cannot unravel, further, the mystery of life. The power of organizing\r\nis possessed only by the lower class of living or organized bodies,\r\nthose known as vegetable organisms or plants. A grain of wheat, a kernel\r\nof corn, a potato, when placed under favorable conditions, takes the\r\ninert, lifeless particles of matter which lie about it in the earth\r\nand air, and organizes them into living substances like itself.\r\n\r\nTo man and animals the Creator delegated the power to form their own\r\npeculiar structures from the vitalized tissues of plants. Thus, both\r\nanimal and vegetable life is preserved without the necessity of\r\ncontinued acts of creative power, each plant and each animal possessing\r\nthe power not only to preserve its own life, but also to aid, at least,\r\nin the perpetuation of the species. The record of creation in Genesis\r\nharmonizes perfectly with this view, it being represented that God\r\nformed (organized or arranged) man, animals, and vegetable productions\r\nfrom the earth.\r\n\r\nSimplest Form of Generation.--Deep down beneath the waters of the ocean,\r\ncovering its bottom in certain localities, is found a curious slime,\r\nwhich, under the microscope, is seen to be composed of minute rounded\r\nmasses of gelatinous matter, or protoplasm. By watching these little\r\nbodies intently for a few minutes, the observer will discover that each\r\nis a living creature capable of moving, growing, and assuming a variety\r\nof shapes. Continued observation will reveal the fact that these little\r\ncreatures multiply; and a more careful scrutiny will enable him to see\r\n_how_ they increase. Each divides into two equal parts so nearly alike\r\nthat they cannot be distinguished apart. In this case the process of\r\ngeneration is simply the production of two similar individuals from\r\none.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of slime taken from the surface of a stone near the\r\nbottom of an old well, or on the seaside, when placed under the\r\nmicroscope, will sometimes be found to contain large numbers of small,\r\nround, living bodies. Careful watching will show that they also\r\nmultiply by division; but before the division occurs, two cells unite\r\nto form one by a process called _conjugation_. Then, by the division\r\nof this cell, instead of only two cells, a large number of small cells\r\nare formed, each of which may be considered as a bud formed upon the\r\nbody of the parent cell and then separated from it to become by growth\r\nan individual like its parent, and, like it, to produce its kind. In\r\nthis case, we have new individuals formed by the union of two\r\nindividuals which are to all appearance entirely similar in every\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nSex.--Rising higher in the scale of being, we find that, with rare\r\nexceptions, reproduction is the result of the union of two dissimilar\r\nelements. These elements do not, in higher organisms, as in lower forms\r\nof life, constitute the individuals, but are produced by them; and being\r\nunlike, they are produced by special organs, each adapted to the\r\nformation of one kind of elements. The two classes of organs usually\r\nexist in separate individuals, thus giving rise to distinctions of\r\n_sex_; an individual possessing organs which form one kind of elements\r\nbeing called a male, and one possessing organs for the formation of\r\nthe other kind of elements, a female. The sexual differences between\r\nindividuals of the same species are not, however, confined to the sexual\r\norgans. In most classes of plants and animals, other sexual differences\r\nare very great. In some of the lower orders of animals, and in many\r\nspecies of plants, the male and female individuals are so much unlike\r\nthat for a long time after they were well known, no sexual relation\r\nwas discovered.\r\n\r\nHermaphrodism.--An individual possessing both male and female organs\r\nof reproduction is called an _hermaphrodite_. Such a combination is\r\nvery rare among higher animals; but it is by no means uncommon among\r\nplants and the lower forms of animal life. The snail, the oyster, the\r\nearth-worm, and the common tape-worm, are examples of true\r\nhermaphrodites. So-called human hermaphrodites are usually\r\nindividuals in whom the sexual organs are abnormally developed so that\r\nthey resemble those of the opposite sex, though they really have but\r\none sex, which can usually be determined with certainty. Only a very\r\nfew cases have been observed in which both male and female organs were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThere is now living in Germany an individual who bears the name of a\r\nwoman; but learned physicians have decided that the person is as much\r\nman as woman, having the organs of both sexes. What is still more curious,\r\nthis person has the feelings of both sexes, having loved at first a\r\nman, and afterward a woman. There have been observed, also, a very few\r\ninstances of individuals in whom the sexual organs of neither sex were\r\npresent. It thus appears that a person may be of both sexes or of no\r\nsex at all.\r\n\r\nSex in Plants.--To one unacquainted with the mysteries of plant life\r\nand growth, the idea of attaching sexuality to plants seems very\r\nextraordinary; but the botanist recognizes the fact that the\r\ndistinctions of sex are as clearly maintained in the vegetable as in\r\nthe animal kingdom. The sexual organs of the higher orders of plants\r\nare flowers. That part of the flower which produces seeds answers to\r\nthe female; another part, which is incapable of forming seeds, answers\r\nto the male. The fertile and sterile flowers are sometimes produced\r\non separate plants. Very frequently, they are produced upon separate\r\nparts of the same plant, as in the oak, walnut, and many other forest\r\ntrees, and Indian corn. In the latter plant, so familiar to every one,\r\nthe \"tassel\" contains the male flowers, and the part known as the\r\n\"silk,\" with the portion to which it is attached--which becomes the\r\near--the female or fertile flowers. In a large number of species, the\r\nmale and female organs are combined in a single flower, making a true\r\nhermaphrodite.\r\n\r\nSex in Animals.--As previously remarked, individuals of opposite sex\r\nusually differ much more than in the character of their sexual organs\r\nonly. Among higher animals, the male is usually larger, stronger, and\r\nof coarser structure than the female. The same contrast is observed\r\nin their mental characters. With lower animals, especially insects,\r\nthe opposite is often observed. The female spider is many times larger\r\nthan the male. The male ant is small in size when compared with the\r\nfemale. Nevertheless, in all classes of animals the difference in the\r\nstructure and the functions of the sexual organs is the chief\r\ndistinguishing character. These differences are not so great, however,\r\nas they might at first appear. The male and female organs of\r\nreproduction in man and other animals, which seem so dissimilar, when\r\nstudied in the light shed upon this subject by the science of embryology,\r\nare found to be wonderfully alike in structure, differing far more in\r\nappearance than in reality, and being little more than modifications\r\nof one general plan. Every organ to be found in the one sex has an\r\nanalogue in the other which is complete in every particular,\r\ncorresponding in function, in structure, and usually in position.\r\n\r\nOther Sexual Differences.--In this country there is between five and\r\nsix inches difference in height and about twenty pounds difference in\r\nweight between the average man and the average woman, the average man\r\nbeing about five feet, eight inches in height, and weighing one hundred\r\nand forty-five pounds; while the average woman is five feet, two or\r\ntwo and one-half inches in height, and weighs one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five pounds. The relation of the sexes in height and weight\r\nvaries in degree in different countries, but is never changed. The\r\naverage height and weight of American men and women is considerably\r\nabove that of the average human being.\r\n\r\nMen and Women Differ in Form.--The differences in form are so marked\r\nthat it is possible for the skilled anatomist to determine the sex of\r\na human being who has been dead for ages, by an examination of the\r\nskeleton alone. In man, the shoulders are broad, the hips narrow, and\r\nthe limbs nearly straight with the body. In woman, the shoulders are\r\nnarrow and usually rounded, and set farther back, the collar-bone being\r\nlonger and less curved, giving the chest greater prominence; while the\r\nhips are broad.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of these differences is that woman is generally less\r\ngraceful and naturally less skillful in the use of the extremities than\r\nman, and hence less fitted for athletic sports and feats requiring great\r\ndexterity. A girl throws a stone awkwardly, less from want of practice\r\nthan from a natural peculiarity of physical structure. A woman walks\r\nless gracefully than a man, owing to the greater relative breadth of\r\nher hips, requiring a motion of the body together with that of the limbs.\r\nIn consequence of this peculiarity, a woman is less fitted for walking\r\nlong distances.\r\n\r\nModern Mania for Female Pedestrianism.--Nothing could be much more\r\ninhuman than the exhibitions made in satisfying the mania for female\r\npedestrianism which has recently arisen. Not long since, in walking\r\ndown one of the principal streets of Boston, we passed, in going a\r\ndistance of thirty rods, three illuminated placards announcing to the\r\npublic that in as many different public halls four female pedestrians\r\nwere exhibiting their walking talents for the gratification of the\r\ncrowds of bawdy loafers and jockeys who congregated to criticize their\r\nseveral \"points,\" and bet on their walking capacity, as though they\r\nwere horses on a race-course or hounds on a fox hunt.\r\n\r\n3,000 Quarter Miles in 3,000 Quarter Hours.--We visited the halls and\r\nascertained that two of these misguided women were attempting the feat\r\nof walking respectively 2,700 and 3,000 quarter miles in an equal number\r\nof successive quarter hours. This would require almost incessant\r\nexertion for nearly twenty-eight days in one case, and for more than\r\nthirty-one days in the other, without at any time a period of unbroken\r\nrest longer than ten minutes. Such a procedure, in the light of\r\nphysiology, is a greater inhumanity than the most merciless Boston\r\nteamster would inflict upon his dumb brutes. Why does not Mr. Bergh\r\nexercise his function in such cases? We did not wonder that the poor\r\nwomen looked pale and suffering, and trudged along with a limping gait.\r\n\r\nA Female Walking Match.--At another hall we found two women engaged\r\nin a \"walking match.\" The hall was so crowded with spectators--with\r\nvery few exceptions of the male sex--that it was with difficulty the\r\nnarrow track could be kept clear.\r\n\r\nThe sixty hours for which the walk was to be continued had nearly expired,\r\nand the excitement grew more intense each moment. One of the walkers,\r\nwho was a few miles in advance, strode on at a pace almost marvelous,\r\nconstantly stimulated to greater efforts by the coarse shouts of the\r\nmasculine audience, who evidently took the same sort of interest in\r\nthe proceeding that they would in a dog race or a cock fight. The other\r\nwas pale and spiritless, and it seemed with difficulty that she dragged\r\nherself along to keep upon the track until the last. At times she seemed\r\nto be almost fainting, as the result of the long-continued excitement\r\nand fatigue; but she managed to keep going until nine minutes before\r\nthe slow moving clock had measured off the sixty hours, when she became\r\ntoo ill to be longer able to stand, and was carried off the track.\r\n\r\nThe cheers for the winner were as vigorous as though a rebel fort had\r\nbeen captured, a million people emancipated from slavery, or some great\r\nand noble deed of honor or daring had been done; but no one thought\r\nof the injury which had been done the contestant. We turned away in\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans amused themselves with witnessing the\r\ngladiatorial contests of their male slaves; but it was left for\r\ncivilized America to introduce woman into the \"ring\" and make her show\r\nher paces on the race-course. An ungraceful figure she cuts, and a\r\nrepulsive spectacle she presents; and worst of all is the havoc which\r\nshe makes with her health. At the very time that these four female\r\npedestrians were making their disgraceful exhibit in Boston, in another\r\npart of the same city lay a helpless invalid who was once as noted a\r\n\"female walkist\" as any of them, made hopelessly ill by the same\r\ndisregard of the plainest laws of nature.\r\n\r\nThe Male and the Female Brain.--But there are other important physical\r\ndifferences to which we must call attention. Man possesses a larger\r\nbrain than woman, but she makes up the deficiency in size by superior\r\nfineness in quality. The female brain differs from the masculine organ\r\nof mentality in other particulars so marked that one who has given the\r\nsubject attention can determine with perfect ease the probable sex of\r\nthe owner of almost any skull which might be presented to him. This\r\ndifference in the conformation of the skull is undoubtedly due to a\r\ndifference in mental character, which, in turn, depends upon a\r\ndifference in cerebral development. Faculties which are generally\r\nlargely developed in one are usually smaller in the other, and the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\nVital Organs of Man and Woman.--The anatomist also observes an\r\ninteresting difference in the size of the various vital organs. For\r\nexample, while a woman has a heart proportionally smaller than the same\r\norgan in man, she has a larger liver. Thus, while less well fitted for\r\nsevere physical exertion by less circulatory power, she has superior\r\nexcretory powers.\r\n\r\nWoman Less Muscular, More Enduring.--This peculiarity of structure is\r\nperfectly harmonious with the fact which experience has established\r\nso often as to make the matter no longer a question, that woman is less\r\nfitted for severe muscular exertion than man, but possesses in a\r\nsuperior degree the quality known as endurance. With a less robust frame,\r\na more delicately organized constitution, she will endure for months\r\nwhat would kill a robust man in as many weeks. More perfect elimination\r\nof the wastes of the body secures a higher grade of vitality. On no\r\nother hypothesis could we account for the marvelous endurance of the\r\nfeminine part of the civilized portion of the human race, ground down\r\nunder the heel of fashion for ages, \"stayed,\" \"corseted,\" \"laced,\" and\r\nthereby distorted and deformed in a manner that would be fatal to almost\r\nany member of the masculine sex.\r\n\r\nA Pathological Difference.--Most physiologists mention another\r\nparticular in which woman differs materially from man; viz, in\r\nnaturally employing, in respiration, chiefly the upper part of the\r\nlungs, while man breathes chiefly with the lower part of the lungs.\r\nFor several years we have carefully studied this question, and we have\r\nbeen unable to find any physiological or anatomical reason sufficient\r\nto account for this fact, if it be such.\r\n\r\nWhy a Woman Does not Breathe Like a Man.--It is undoubtedly true that\r\nmost women do breathe almost exclusively with the upper part of the\r\nchest; but whether this is a _natural_ peculiarity, or an acquired,\r\nunnatural, and depraved one, is a question which we are decidedly\r\ninclined to answer in harmony with the latter supposition, basing our\r\nconclusion on the following undeniable facts:--\r\n\r\n1. In childhood, and until about the age of puberty, respiration in\r\nthe boy and the girl is exactly the same.\r\n\r\n2. Although there is a change in the mode of respiration in most females,\r\nusually soon after the period of puberty, marked by increased\r\nintercostal respiration and diminished abdominal or deep respiration,\r\nthis change can be accounted for on other than physiological grounds.\r\n\r\n3. We believe the cause of this modification of respiration is the\r\nchange in dress which is usually made about that time. The young girl\r\nis now becoming a woman, and must acquire the art of lacing, wearing\r\na corset, \"stays,\" and sundry other contrivances by means of which to\r\nproduce a \"fine form\" by distorting and destroying all natural grace\r\nand beauty in the \"form divine.\"\r\n\r\n4. We have met a number of ladies whose good fortune and good sense\r\nhad delivered them from the distorting influence of corset-wearing and\r\ntight-lacing, and we have invariably observed that they are as capable\r\nof deep respiration as men, and practice it as naturally.\r\n\r\nWe are thoroughly convinced that this so-called physiological\r\ndifference between man and woman is really a pathological rather than\r\na natural difference, and is due to the evils of fashionable dress,\r\nwhich we have exposed at some length in another work exclusively devoted\r\nto that subject.[2] In short, we believe that the only reason why women\r\ndo not, under ordinary circumstances, breathe as do men, is simply\r\n_because they can not_ breathe naturally.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Evils of Fashionable Dress, and How to Dress\r\nHealthfully.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Reproductive Elements.--As has been previously observed, in all\r\nexcept the very lowest forms of life, two elements are necessary to\r\nthe production of a new individual, or a reproduction of the species--a\r\nmale element and a female element. The special organs by means of which\r\nthese elements are produced, brought together, and developed into the\r\nnew individual in a more or less perfect state, are termed _sexual\r\norgans_, as we have already seen. As an introduction to the specific\r\nstudy of the sexual organs in the human species, let us briefly consider\r\nthe\r\n\r\nSexual Organs of Plants.--As already remarked, flowers are the sexual\r\norgans of plants. Nothing is more interesting in the natural world than\r\nthe wonderful beauty, diversity, and perfect adaptability to various\r\nconditions and functions, which we see in the sexual parts of plants.\r\nAn exceedingly interesting line of study, which has occupied the\r\nattention of many naturalists, is the wonderful perfection displayed\r\nin the adaptability of the male and female parts of plants to each other.\r\nWithout burdening the reader with unnecessary technicalities of detail,\r\nwe will briefly notice the principal parts of vegetable sexual organs\r\nas illustrated in flowers.\r\n\r\nComplete flowers are made up of four parts, two of which, the _stamen_\r\nand _pistil_, are essential, while the other two, the calyx and corolla,\r\nare accessory.\r\n\r\nThe _calyx_ is that part which surrounds the flower at its outer and\r\nlower part. It varies greatly in form and color, but is most frequently\r\nof a green or greenish color.\r\n\r\nJust within the calyx is the _corolla_, which usually forms the most\r\nattractive, showy, and beautiful part of the flower. The beautifully\r\ncolored petals of the rose, geranium, dahlia, and other similar flowers,\r\nform their corollas.\r\n\r\nVegetable Husbands.--Within the cup formed by the calyx and corolla\r\nare placed the _stamens_ and _pistils_ of the flower, the first being\r\nthe male organs proper, and the second the female organs of the flower.\r\n\r\nThe stamen is composed of a stem or filament, at the summit of which\r\nare placed two little sacks called the _anther_, which contain a fine,\r\nmicroscopic dust, the _pollen_, which contains the male reproductive\r\nelement of the flower. This part of the plant corresponds to the male\r\norgan of reproduction in animals. A stamen has been called, not inaptly,\r\na vegetable husband. Some flowers have many stamens, or vegetable\r\nhusbands, which reminds us of the custom in Thibet and some other\r\nEastern countries which allows a woman to have several husbands.\r\n\r\nPolygamous Flowers.--The great naturalist, Linnaeus, whose name was\r\nimmortalized by his careful study and classification of organized life,\r\nmade the number of stamens possessed by various flowers the basis of\r\na systematic classification.\r\n\r\nFor example, a flower having but one stamen was classed as _monandria_,\r\nwhich means, literally, one husband; one having two stamens was\r\nclassified as _diandria_; flowers having a large number of male organs\r\nwere termed _polyandria_, or many husbands.\r\n\r\nThe Female Organ of Flowers.--The _pistil_ occupies the very center\r\nof the flower. It produces and contains in a cell, the female element,\r\ntermed the _ovule_. It is surmounted by the _style_ and the _stigma_.\r\n\r\nA series of plants in which the sexual organs are not visible to the\r\neye are termed _cryptogamia_, which means literally, hidden marriages.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed to study the anatomy of the human sexual apparatus we\r\nshall be constantly struck with the remarkable correspondence between\r\nanimals and vegetables in the structure and functions of the sexual\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nSexual Organs of Animals.--The male reproductive element is called a\r\n_spermatozoon_ or _zoosperm_. The female element is called an _ovum_,\r\nliterally, an egg.\r\n\r\nThe Spermatozoon.--The male reproductive element of animals is formed\r\nby an organ called the _testis_, or _testicle_, of which each male\r\npossesses two. They are elastic, glandular bodies, and are formed\r\nwithin the cavity of the abdomen, near the kidneys, but usually pass\r\nout of the abdominal cavity and descend to their permanent position\r\nbefore birth. The opening in the abdominal wall is usually completely\r\nclosed in a short time; but occasionally it remains open, giving rise\r\nto congenital hernia, an accident in which a loop of intestine follows\r\nthe testicle down into the scrotum, either completely or partially.\r\nIn a few animals, as in the porcupine, the opening is never fully closed,\r\nand the testis remains in the cavity of the body most of the time,\r\npassing out only at certain periods. We also occasionally meet cases\r\nof human beings in which the testes have never descended from their\r\nplace in the abdominal cavity, giving the individuals the appearance\r\nof eunuchs. This condition, however, though an abnormal one, does not\r\nin any way interfere with the function of the organs, as those who happen\r\nto possess it often imagine. We have also met with cases in which the\r\norgans were movable, and could readily be pressed up into the abdominal\r\ncavity, through the unclosed inguinal cavity, which afforded them a\r\npassage downward in the process of development.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, these peculiarities do not affect the functions\r\nof the organs in any appreciable degree, although they not infrequently\r\ngive rise to some apprehension on the part of those subject to them.\r\nThe left testicle is sometimes a little smaller than the right, another\r\nfact which is seized upon by quacks as a means of exciting the fears\r\nof young men who have been addicted to bad habits, although the\r\npeculiarity is generally without important significance.\r\n\r\nThe testicles are connected with the urinary passage by means of two\r\nducts which terminate near the base of the bladder, at which point they\r\nconnect with the urethra. We need not dwell at further length upon the\r\nstructure of the testicles, as this subject receives fuller attention\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nHuman spermatozoa are about 1/600 of an inch in length. Those of\r\nreptiles are very much larger. One of the remarkable features of these\r\nminute elements is their peculiar movements. While alive, the\r\nfilamentous tail is in constant action in a manner strongly resembling\r\nthe movements of the caudal appendage of a tadpole. This wonderful\r\nproperty led the earlier observers to believe that they were true\r\nanimalcula. But they are not to be regarded as such, though one can\r\nscarcely make himself believe otherwise while watching their lively\r\nevolutions, and apparent volitionary movement from one point to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSpermatozoa originate in the testis as cells, which are filled with\r\ngranules. After a time, each granule acquires a long appendage, and\r\nthen the cell has become converted into a bundle of small zoosperms.\r\nDevelopment still continues, until finally the thin pellicle on the\r\noutside of the bundle is ruptured, thus liberating the young\r\nspermatozoa, which speedily complete their full development. The\r\nspermatozoon is pure protoplasm, which is the basis of all life, and\r\nits power of spontaneous motion is due to this fact.\r\n\r\nIn man, the formation of spermatozoa continues with greater or less\r\nrapidity from puberty to old age, though at the two extremes of\r\nexistence they are imperfectly developed. When not discharged from the\r\nbody, they are said to be absorbed. Some physiologists claim that they\r\nare composed of a substance identical with nerve tissue, and that by\r\nabsorption they play a very important part in the development and\r\nmaintenance of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by good authorities that the reproductive element in\r\nman is not so well developed as to be really fit for the reproduction\r\nof the species before the age of twenty-four or twenty-five. After the\r\nage of forty-five or fifty, the reproductive elements deteriorate in\r\nquality, and become again unfitted for vigorous procreation.\r\n\r\nThe fully developed zoosperms are suspended in a transparent,\r\ngelatinous fluid, which, mingled with the secretion of the prostate\r\ngland and other fluids which it meets during its expulsion from the\r\nbody, constitutes the _semen_.\r\n\r\nThe Ovum.--The female element of generation, the ovum, is produced by\r\nan organ called the _ovary_, of which there are two in each individual.\r\nIn size and form, the ovary closely resembles the testicle. Like the\r\nlatter organ, also, it is formed within the body early in the process\r\nof development; but instead of passing outward and downward, as does\r\nthe testicle, it remains within the abdominal cavity, suspended in\r\nplace by ligaments. It is connected with a duct which receives the ovum\r\nas it is discharged, and conveys it to the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe human ovum varies in size from 1/240 to 1/120 of an inch in diameter,\r\nand consists of a single cell. Ova are not formed in such large numbers\r\nas zoosperms. As a general rule, in the human female, a single ovum\r\nis developed and discharged once in about four weeks, during the period\r\nof sexual activity.\r\n\r\nFecundation.--It is often asked, and the question has elicited some\r\ndiscussion, Which is the principal reproductive element; the zoosperm,\r\nor the ovum? The ancients supposed the male element to be the essential\r\nelement, being simply nourished and developed by the female; but modern\r\nresearch in biological science does not sustain this view. Probably\r\nneither one enjoys especial preeminence; for neither can undergo\r\ncomplete development without the other. In very rare cases, the ovum\r\nhas been observed to undergo a certain amount of development of itself;\r\nbut a perfect individual can be produced only by the union of the two\r\nkinds of elements, which process is known as _fecundation_. The instant\r\nthis union occurs, the life of a new individual begins. All the changes\r\nwhich result between that moment and the birth of the individual are\r\nthose of development only. Indeed, the same existence continues from\r\nthe instant of the union of the two elements, not only until birth,\r\nbut through growth, the attainment of maturity, the decline of life,\r\nand even until death.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the different methods by which fecundation\r\nis effected, both in plants and animals, for this is a process common\r\nto both.\r\n\r\nFecundation in Flowers.--The great naturalist, Linnaeus, was the first\r\nto explain the reproductive process in plants. He tells us that \"the\r\nflower forms the theater of their amours; the calyx is to be considered\r\nas the nuptial bed; the corolla constitutes the curtains; the anthers\r\nare the testes; the pollen, the fecundating fluid; the stigma of the\r\npistil, the external genital aperture; the style, the vagina, or the\r\nconductor of the prolific seed; the ovary of the plant, the womb; the\r\nreciprocal action of the stamens on the pistil, the accessory process\r\nof fecundation.\"\r\n\r\nThus marvelous is the analogy between the reproductive organs and their\r\nfunctions in plants and animals. Through this one vital process we may\r\ntrace a close relation between all the forms of life, from the humblest\r\nplant, or even the mere specks of life which form the green scum upon\r\na stagnant pool, to man, the masterpiece of creation, the highest of\r\nall animated creatures. In all the realm of Nature there can be found\r\nno more remarkable evidences of the infinite skill and wisdom of the\r\nCreator of all things.\r\n\r\nIn many instances the action of plants seems almost to be prompted by\r\nintelligence. At the proper moment, the corolla contracts in such a\r\nway as to bring the stamens nearer to the stigma, or in contact with\r\nit, so as to insure fecundation. In some aquatic plants the flowers\r\nelevate themselves above the surface of water while the process of\r\nfecundation is effected; submerging themselves again immediately\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nOther very curious changes occur in flowers of different species during\r\nthe reproductive act. The stigma is observed to become moistened, and\r\neven to become distinctly odorous. Often, too, it becomes intensely\r\ncongested with the juices of the plant, and sometimes even acquires\r\nan uncommon and most remarkable degree of contractility. This is the\r\ncase with the stigma of the tulip and one variety of sensitive plant,\r\nand is in these plants observed to occur not only after the application\r\nof the pollen to the stigma, but when excited by any other means of\r\nstimulation. The flowers of some plants, during and after fecundation,\r\nalso show an increase of heat, in some cases so marked as to be readily\r\ndetected with the thermometer. This is said to be the case with the\r\n_arum_ of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn some plants in which the pistil is longer than the stamens, thus\r\nelevating the stigma above the anthers, the female organ is often\r\nobserved to bend over and depress itself so as to come within reach\r\nof the anthers.\r\n\r\nIn most instances the fecundation of flowers is chiefly effected\r\nthrough a purely mechanical process, though in these cases also we see\r\na wonderful adaptation of parts to conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen the male and female parts of flowers are situated on different\r\nplants, as is the case in the willow, the poplar, the melon vine, and\r\nmany other species, the pollen of the male flower is wafted by the wind\r\nor gentle breeze to the stigma of the female flower, which will usually\r\nbe found at no very great distance, although fertilization may take\r\nplace in this way at very considerable distances. Bees, moths, and many\r\nother species of insects, serve a very important purpose in this work,\r\ntransporting the fertilizing dust upon their wings, antennae,\r\nsucking-tubes, and feet. Small birds, and even the humble snail, which\r\nwould scarcely be credited with any useful function, are also very\r\nserviceable in the same direction. The part performed by insects in\r\nthe reproductive process of many plants is so great that they have been\r\nvery poetically termed \"the marriage priests of flowers.\"\r\n\r\nNature provides for thorough fecundation in these cases by placing the\r\nplants which bear the male and the female flowers near each other. This\r\nfact accounts for the unproductiveness of certain varieties of\r\nstrawberries unless mixed with plants of some other variety, it being\r\nwell known to nursery-men that some varieties produce only the female\r\nparts of flowers.\r\n\r\nModes of Fecundation in Animals.--The modes by which fecundation is\r\neffected in animals are still more various and wonderful than in plants.\r\nIn some of the lower animals, as in most fish and reptiles, both elements\r\nare discharged from the bodies of the parents before coming in contact,\r\nthere being no contact of the two individuals. In this class of animals\r\nthe process is almost wholly analogous to fecundation in those plants\r\nin which the male and female flowers are on different plants or\r\ndifferent parts of the same plant. In the female fish, a large number\r\nof ova are developed at a certain season of the year known as the\r\nspawning season. Sometimes the number reaches many thousands. At the\r\nsame time, the testicles of the male fish, which are contained within\r\nthe abdominal cavity, become distended with developed zoosperms. When\r\nthe female seeks a place to deposit her eggs, the male closely follows;\r\nand as she drops them upon the gravelly bottom, he discharges upon them\r\nthe zoosperms by which they are fecundated. The process is analogous\r\nto some species of frogs. When the female is about to deposit her eggs,\r\nthe male mounts upon her back and rides about until the eggs are all\r\ndeposited, discharging upon them the fertilizing spermatozoa as they\r\nare laid by the female.\r\n\r\nIn higher orders of animals, fecundation takes place within the\r\ngenerative organs of the female by contact between the male and the\r\nfemale organs. To effect this, there are necessitated certain accessory\r\norgans, the _penis_ in the male and the _vagina_ in the female.\r\n\r\nNothing in all the range of nature is more remarkable than the\r\nadaptation of the two varieties of sexual organs in each species. This\r\nnecessary provision is both a powerful means of securing the\r\nperpetuation of the species, and an almost impassable barrier against\r\namalgamation.\r\n\r\nThe act of union, or sexual congress, is called _coitus_ or _copulation_.\r\nIt is accompanied by a peculiar nervous spasm due to excitement of\r\nspecial nerves principally located in the _penis_ in the male, and in\r\nan extremely sensitive organ, the _clitoris_, in the female. The\r\nnervous action referred to is more exhausting to the system than any\r\nother to which it is subject.\r\n\r\nUnion of the Ovum and Zoosperm.--The zoosperms not only come in contact\r\nwith the ovum, but penetrate the thin membrane which incloses its\r\ncontents, and enter its interior, where they disappear, becoming united\r\nwith its substance. In the ova of certain fishes, small openings have\r\nbeen observed through which the spermatozoa find entrance. Whether such\r\nopenings exist in human ova is an undecided question; but it is probable\r\nthat they do.\r\n\r\nCurious Modes of Reproduction.--A peculiar kind of reproduction is\r\nobserved in a variety of polyp, a curious animal which very much\r\nresembles a shrub in appearance. It attaches itself to some solid object,\r\nand then, as it grows, sends out little protuberances resembling buds.\r\nSome of these separate and fall off, swimming about as separate animals.\r\nThese never become like the parent polyp; but they lay eggs, which hatch,\r\nand become stationary polyps like their grandparent, and in their turn\r\nthrow off buds to form swimming polyps. In this case we have two kinds\r\nof generation combined, alternating with each other.\r\n\r\nPlant-lice afford a curious illustration of a similar generation. Males\r\nand females unite and produce eggs. The creatures produced by the\r\nhatching of eggs are neither males nor perfect females. They are\r\n_imperfect females_. They are all alike, so that no sexual union occurs.\r\nInstead of laying eggs, they produce live young like themselves, which\r\nappear to be developed from internal buds similar to the external buds\r\nof the polyp. After this method of reproduction has continued for eight\r\nor ten generations, a few perfect individuals appear, and the first\r\nprocess is repeated.\r\n\r\nThe common honey-bee affords another illustration like the last. A\r\nvirgin queen sometimes lays eggs, which always produce males, or drones.\r\nAfter union with a male, she lays eggs in the royal cells which become\r\nperfect females like herself. She also seems to have the power to lay,\r\nat will, unfecundated eggs, from which drones are produced.\r\n\r\nHuman Beings Are Developed Buds.--It has been very aptly suggested by\r\nan eminent physiologist that the ovum and zoosperm may be correctly\r\nconsidered as internal buds. Thus it would appear that generation is\r\nuniversally a process of budding. A child is but a compound bud, an\r\noffshoot from its parents. This idea is not a mere fancy, but has a\r\nscientific basis. As all the exquisite details of the most beautiful\r\nflower are in essence contained within the tiny bud which first makes\r\nits appearance, so is the developed human being, the full-grown man\r\nor woman, virtually contained within the tiny cell called the ovum after\r\nit has been impregnated or fecundated by the zoosperms. In short, men\r\nand women are blossoms in a strictly scientific sense.\r\n\r\nFecundation in Hermaphrodites.--The process of fecundation in\r\nhermaphrodite animals is very peculiar. In some cases, as in the snail,\r\nthe union of two individuals is usually necessary, though each\r\npossesses both kinds of organs. In other cases, as in the tape-worm,\r\nthe oyster, and numerous other mollusks, a single individual has the\r\npower to fertilize its own ova, thus being wholly independent. Human\r\nhermaphrodites are usually so deformed that fecundation is not effected,\r\nwhich is a fortunate safeguard against the multiplication of such\r\nmonstrosities.\r\n\r\nDevelopment.--After the union of the two elements, known as fecundation\r\nor _conception_, if the conditions are favorable, development occurs,\r\nand the little germ is in due process of time developed into an\r\nindividual which is an exact counterpart of its parents. During this\r\ndevelopmental process, the embryonic being is variously treated by\r\ndifferent classes of animals.\r\n\r\nUnprotected Development.--Most fishes and reptiles discharge their ova\r\nbefore fecundation, or soon after, and pay no further attention to them.\r\nThe fish deposits its eggs in a little hollow scooped out in the gravelly\r\nbed of a stream, or sows them broadcast upon the waters. The turtle\r\nburies its eggs in the sand, and leaves them to be hatched by the sun.\r\nThe ostrich disposes of her eggs in the same way. Many other species\r\nof animals pay no regard to the protection of the germs which are\r\ndestined, if placed under favorable conditions, to become individuals\r\nlike themselves.\r\n\r\nPartial Protection of the Ovum.--There are some exceptions, however,\r\nto this general rule among fishes and reptiles. Even fishes manifest\r\na degree of parental solicitude in certain cases. The male of a species\r\nof South American fish gathers up the eggs after fecundation has taken\r\nplace, and carries them in his mouth until they are hatched. Another\r\nmale fish carries the eggs of his mate in a little pouch upon the lower\r\nand posterior part of his body.\r\n\r\nCertain species of frogs carry their eggs wound about their legs; others\r\nsuspend them from the abdomen. Another variety carries its young upon\r\nits back. Prof. Wyman describes a \"swamp toad\" which patiently takes\r\nthe eggs of his mate, one by one, and fastens them upon her back,\r\nobserving great regularity in arrangement. These several devices are\r\nevidently for the purpose of protecting, in some degree, the young\r\nindividual during the helpless stage of its existence.\r\n\r\nDevelopment in the Higher Animals and Man.--Higher animals are less\r\nprolific, and their development is a more complicated process; hence,\r\ntheir young need greater protection, and, for this reason, the ova,\r\ninstead of being discharged from the body of the female after\r\nfecundation, are retained.[3] As we have seen that a suitable\r\nreceptacle is sometimes provided outside of the body, so now a\r\nreceptacle is needed, and is provided in the interior of the body of\r\nthe female. This receptacle is called\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Curious examples of internal development sometimes occur\r\nin animals which usually deposit eggs. Snakes have been known to produce\r\nboth eggs and living young at the same time. At the annual meeting of\r\nthe American Society for the Advancement of Science, at Detroit, Mich.,\r\nin August, 1875, we had the pleasure of examining a specimen, exhibited\r\nby Prof. Wilder, of a chick which had undergone a considerable degree\r\nof development within the ovary of the hen. It had a head, a rudimentary\r\nbrain, and internal viscera, but no feathers nor limbs. It was, in fact,\r\nan egg hatched before it had been laid. The anomaly excited much\r\ninterest at that time and since among biologists.]\r\n\r\nThe Uterus.--This is a hollow, pear-shaped organ, located in the median\r\nline, just behind the bladder, between it and the rectum. It is\r\nsupported in place by various ligaments and by the juxtaposition of\r\nother organs. Its larger end is directed upward, and communicates upon\r\neach side with a very narrow tube which is prolonged outward on either\r\nside until it nearly touches the ovary of the same side. Its lower and\r\nsmaller end fills the internal extremity of the passage previously\r\ndescribed as the vagina. When an ovum is matured, it escapes from the\r\novary into the narrow tube referred to, called the _Fallopian tube_,\r\nand passes down into the cavity of the uterus. If fecundation does not\r\noccur, it is expelled or absorbed after six to twelve or fourteen days.\r\nIf copulation occurs, however, zoosperms are brought into the cavity\r\nof the uterus, and, coming in contact with the ovum, fecundate it. This\r\nis _conception_. When the natural process is allowed to proceed,\r\ndevelopment occurs.\r\n\r\nUterine Gestation.--This is the term applied to the process last\r\nreferred to. We shall not attempt to describe in detail this most\r\nwonderful and intricate of all living processes; but will sketch only\r\nthe chief points, leaving the reader who would obtain a more complete\r\nknowledge of the subject to consult any one of the numerous\r\nphysiological and obstetrical works which deal with it in a very\r\nexhaustive manner.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ovum is impregnated by the male element, it begins a\r\nprocess of symmetrical division. The first division produces two cells\r\nout of the single one which first existed. By the next division, four\r\nsegments are produced; then eight, sixteen, etc. While this process\r\nis going on, the ovum becomes adherent to the internal wall of the uterus,\r\nand is soon enveloped by its mucous membrane, which grows up about and\r\nincloses it.\r\n\r\nThe Primitive Trace.--When the process of segmentation has advanced\r\nto a certain point, the cells are aggregated together in a compact layer\r\nat the surface. Soon a straight line appears upon this layer, which\r\nis called the _primitive trace_. This delicate line becomes the basis\r\nfor the spinal column; and upon and about it the whole individual is\r\ndeveloped by an intricate process of folding, dividing, and\r\nreduplication of the layer of cells. One end of the line becomes the\r\nhead, and the other becomes the tail. Even man has a caudal appendage\r\nat an early stage of his existence. After a further lapse of time, little\r\nexcrescences, buds, or \"pads,\" appear in the proper positions to\r\nrepresent the arms and legs. After further development the ends split\r\nup into fingers and toes, and by the continued development of the parts,\r\nperfect arms and legs are formed.\r\n\r\nCurious Relation to Lower Animals.--It is a very remarkable fact that\r\nin the lower animals we have numerous examples in which the permanent\r\ncondition of the individual is the same as some one of the stages through\r\nwhich man passes in the process of development. The same author\r\npreviously quoted makes the following interesting statements:--\r\n\r\n\"The webbed feet of the seal and ornithorhynchus typify the period when\r\nthe hands and feet of the human embryo are as yet only partly subdivided\r\ninto fingers and toes. Indeed, it is not uncommon for the 'web' to\r\npersist to some extent between the toes of adults; and occasionally\r\nchildren are born with two or more fingers or toes united to their tips.\r\n\r\n\"With the seal and the walrus, the limbs are protruded but little beyond\r\nthe wrist and ankle. With the ordinary quadrupeds, the knee and elbow\r\nare visible. The cats, the lemurs, and the monkeys form a series in\r\nwhich the limbs are successively freed from the trunk, and in the\r\nhighest apes they are capable of nearly the same movements as the human\r\narm and leg, which, in their development, passed through all these\r\nstages.\"\r\n\r\nSimplicity of Early Structures.--The first structures formed are\r\nexceedingly simple in form. It is only by slow degrees that the great\r\ncomplicity which characterizes many organs is finally attained. For\r\nexample, the heart is at first only a straight tube. By enlargement\r\nand the formation of longitudinal and transverse partitions, the fully\r\ndeveloped organ is finally produced. The stomach and intestines are\r\nalso at first but a simple straight tube. The stomach and large\r\nintestine are formed by dilatation; and by a growth of the tube in length\r\nwhile the ends are confined, the small intestines are formed. The other\r\ninternal organs are successively developed by similar processes.\r\n\r\nThe Stages of Growth.--At first insignificant in size--a simple cell,\r\nthe embryonic human being steadily increases in size, gradually\r\napproximating more and more closely to the human form, until, at the\r\nend of about nine calendar months or ten lunar months, the new\r\nindividual is prepared to enter the world and begin a more independent\r\ncourse of life. The following condensation of a summary quoted by Dr.\r\nAustin Flint, Jr., will give an idea of the size of the developing being\r\nat different periods, and the rate of progress:--\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third week, the embryon is a little less than\r\none-fourth of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the seventh week, it is three-fourths of an inch long.\r\nThe liver, lungs, and other internal organs are partially formed.\r\n\r\nAt the eighth week, it is about one inch in length. It begins to look\r\nsome like a human being, but it is impossible to determine the sex.\r\n\r\nAt the third month, the embryon has attained the length of two to two\r\nand one-half inches. Its weight is about one ounce.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourth month, the embryon is called a fetus. It is\r\nfrom four to five inches long, and weighs five ounces.\r\n\r\nAt the fifth month, the fetus is nearly a foot long, and weighs about\r\nhalf a pound.\r\n\r\nAt the sixth month, the average length of the fetus is about thirteen\r\ninches, and its weight one and a half to two pounds. If born, life could\r\ncontinue a few minutes.\r\n\r\nAt the seventh month, the fetus is from fourteen to fifteen inches long,\r\nand weighs two to three pounds. It is now viable (may live if born).\r\n\r\nAt the eighth month, the length of the fetus is from fifteen to sixteen\r\ninches, and its weight from three to four pounds.\r\n\r\nAt the ninth month, the fetus is about seventeen inches long, and weighs\r\nfrom five to six pounds.\r\n\r\nAt birth, the infant weighs a little more than seven pounds, the usual\r\nrange being from four to ten pounds, though these limits are sometimes\r\nexceeded.\r\n\r\nDuration of Gestation.--The length of time required for the development\r\nof a human being is usually reckoned as about forty weeks. A more precise\r\nstatement places it at about two hundred and seventy-eight days. This\r\nlimit is often varied from. Cases have occurred in which a much longer\r\ntime has been required, and numberless cases have occurred in which\r\nhuman beings have been born several weeks before the expiration of the\r\nusual time, as stated. There is some uncertainty respecting the exact\r\nlength of the period of gestation, which grows out of the difficulty\r\nof determining, in many cases, the exact time when conception takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nUterine Life.--The uterine life of the new individual begins with the\r\nimpregnation of the ovum, which occurs the instant it is brought in\r\ncontact with the zoosperms of the male. While in the uterus, the young\r\nlife is supported wholly by the mother. She is obliged to provide not\r\nonly for her own sustenance, but for the maintenance of her child. And\r\nshe must not only eat for it, but breathe for it as well, since it\r\nrequires a constant and adequate supply of oxygen before birth as much\r\nas afterward.\r\n\r\nHow the Unborn Infant Breathes.--Oxygen and nutriment are both supplied\r\nto it through the medium of an organ called the _placenta_, which is\r\na spongy growth composed almost entirely of blood-vessels, and is\r\ndeveloped upon the inner wall of the uterus, at the point at which the\r\novum attaches itself after fecundation. The growing fetus is connected\r\nwith this vascular organ by means of a sort of cable, called the\r\n_umbilical cord_. The cord is almost entirely composed of blood-vessels\r\nwhich convey the blood of the fetus to the placenta and return it again.\r\nThe fetal blood does not mix with that of the mother, but receives oxygen\r\nand nourishment from it by absorption through the thin walls which alone\r\nseparate it from the mother's blood.\r\n\r\nThe umbilical cord contains no nerves, as there is no nervous connection\r\nbetween the mother and the child. The only way in which the child can\r\nbe influenced by the mother is through the medium of the blood, to\r\nchanges in which it is very susceptible, as we shall see more clearly\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe cord is attached to the body of the child at the point called the\r\n_navel_, being cut off at birth by the _accoucheur_. With the placenta,\r\nit is expelled soon after the birth of the child, and constitutes the\r\nshapeless mass familiarly known as the _after-birth_, by the retention\r\nof which the most serious trouble is occasionally caused.\r\n\r\nParturition.--At the end of the period of development, the young being\r\nis forcibly expelled from the laboratory of nature in which it has been\r\nformed. In other words, it is born; and this process is termed\r\n_parturition_. Though, at first thought, such an act would seem an utter\r\nimpossibility, yet it is a very admirable illustration of nature's\r\nadaptation of means to ends. During the months of gestation, while the\r\nuterus has been enlarging to accommodate its daily increasing contents,\r\nthe generative passages have also been increasing in size and becoming\r\nsoft and distensible, so that a seeming impossibility is in due time\r\naccomplished without physical damage, though possibly not without\r\nintense suffering. However, it is a most gratifying fact that modern\r\nmedical science may do much to mitigate the pains of childbirth. It\r\nis possible, by a proper course of preparation for the expected event,\r\nto greatly lessen the suffering usually undergone; and some ladies\r\nassert that they have thus avoided real pain altogether. Although the\r\ncurse pronounced upon the feminine part of the race, in consequence\r\nof the sin of Eve, implies suffering in the parturient act, yet there\r\nis no doubt that the greater share of the daughters of Eve are, through\r\nthe perverting and degenerating influences of wrong habits and\r\nespecially of modern civilization, compelled to suffer many times more\r\nthan their maternal ancestor. We have sufficient evidence of this in\r\nthe fact that among barbarian women, who are generally less perverted\r\nphysically than civilized women, childbirth is regarded with very\r\nlittle apprehension, since it occasions little pain or inconvenience.\r\nThe same is true of many women among the lower laboring classes. In\r\nshort, while it is true that more or less suffering must always\r\naccompany the parturient act, yet the excessive pain usually attendant\r\nupon the process is the result of causes which can in many cases be\r\nremoved by proper management beforehand and at the time of confinement.\r\n\r\nAfter being relieved of its contents, the uterus and other organs\r\nrapidly return to nearly their original size.\r\n\r\nChanges in the Child at Birth.--In the system of the child a wonderful\r\nchange occurs at the moment of its expulsion into the outer world. For\r\nthe first time, its lungs are filled with air. For the first time they\r\nreceive the full tide of blood. The whole course of the circulation\r\nis changed, and an entirely new process begins. It is surprising in\r\nhow short a space of time changes so marvelous can be wrought.\r\n\r\nNursing.--The process of development is not fully complete at birth.\r\nThe young life is not yet prepared to support itself; hence, still\r\nfurther provision is necessary for it. It requires prepared food suited\r\nto its condition. This is provided by the _mammae_, or breasts, of the\r\nfemale, which are glands for secreting milk. The fully developed gland\r\nis peculiar to the female; but a few instances have been known in which\r\nit has been sufficiently developed to become functionally active in\r\nmen, as well as in young girls, though it is usually inactive even in\r\nwomen until near the close of gestation. It is a curious fact that the\r\nbreasts of a new-born child occasionally contain milk.\r\n\r\nThe first product of the mammae is not the proper milk secretion, but\r\nis a yellowish fluid called _colostrum _. The true milk secretion begins\r\ntwo or three days after delivery.\r\n\r\nThe lacteal secretion is influenced in a very remarkable manner by the\r\nmental conditions of the mother. By sudden emotions of grief or anger,\r\nit has been known to undergo such changes as to produce in the child\r\na fit of indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea, and even convulsions and\r\ndeath. Any medicine taken by the mother finds its way into the milk,\r\nand often affects the delicate system of the infant more than herself.\r\nThis fact should be a warning to those nursing mothers who use\r\nstimulants. Cases are not uncommon in which delicate infants are kept\r\nin a state of intoxication for weeks by the use of alcoholic drinks\r\nby the mother. The popular notion that lager-beer, ale, wine, or alcohol\r\nin any other form, is in any degree necessary or beneficial to a nursing\r\nwoman is a great error which cannot be too often noticed and condemned.\r\nNot only is the mother injured, instead of being benefited by such a\r\npractice, but great injury, sometimes life-long in its consequences,\r\nis inflicted upon the babe at her breast who takes the intoxicating\r\npoison at second hand, and is influenced in a fourfold degree from its\r\nfeebleness and great susceptibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\nHaving now considered the functions and somewhat of the structures of\r\nthe principal organs of reproduction, we may obtain a more definite\r\nidea of the relation of the several organs of each class by a connected\r\nreview of the anatomy of the parts.\r\n\r\nMale Organs.--As previously stated, the external organs of generation\r\nin the male are the _penis_ and the _testicles_, the latter being\r\ncontained in a pouch called the _scrotum_. The penis is the organ of\r\nurination as well as copulation. Its structure is cellular, and it\r\ncontains a vast number of minute coils of blood-vessels which become\r\nturgid with blood under the influence of sexual excitement, producing\r\ndistention and erection of the organ. A canal passes through its entire\r\nlength, called the _urethra_, which conveys both the urine and the\r\nseminal fluid. The organ is protected by a loose covering of integument\r\nwhich folds over the end. This fold is called the _foreskin_ or\r\n_prepuce_.\r\n\r\nThe fluid formed by each testicle is conveyed by the _vas deferens_,\r\na curved tube about two feet in length, to the base of the bladder.\r\nHere the vas deferens joins with another duct which communicates with\r\nan elongated pouch, the _vesicula seminalis_, which lies close upon\r\nthe under side of the bladder. The single tube thus formed, the\r\n_ejaculatory duct_, conveys the seminal fluid to the urethra, from\r\nwhich it is discharged.\r\n\r\nAs the production of seminal fluid is more or less constant in man and\r\nsome animals, while its discharge is intermittent, the vesiculae\r\nseminales serve as reservoirs for the fluid, preserving it until\r\nrequired, or allowing it to undergo absorption. Some claim that the\r\nzoosperms are matured in these organs. They always contain seminal\r\nfluid after the age of puberty. During coition, their contents are\r\nforcibly expelled by a spasmodic contraction of the muscles which\r\nsurround them and the ducts leading from them.\r\n\r\nThe Prostate Gland.--Surrounding the ejaculatory ducts and their\r\nopenings into the urethra at the base of the bladder is the _prostate\r\ngland_, which produces a peculiar secretion which forms a considerable\r\nportion of the seminal fluid, being mingled with the secretion of the\r\ntestes during its ejaculation. This gland sometimes becomes the seat\r\nof somewhat serious disease. In old age it usually becomes somewhat\r\nindurated, and often to such an extent as to seriously affect the health\r\nand comfort of the individual by interference with urination and by\r\noccasioning pain.\r\n\r\nAnterior to this organ, in the urethra, is a curious little pouch, the\r\n_utriculus_, which corresponds to the vagina and uterus in the female.\r\nJust in front of the prostate gland are two small bodies known as\r\nCowper's glands. They secrete a fluid which combines with the seminal\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nFemale Organs.--The _ovaries_, _uterus_, or _womb_, _Fallopian tubes_,\r\nand _vagina_ have already been described in part. The external organs\r\nof the female are included in the term _vulva_ or _pudenda_. The most\r\nsuperficial parts are the _labia_, two thick folds of integument. Just\r\nwithin these are two thinner folds, the _labia minora_ or _nymphae_.\r\nThese, together with the _clitoris_, situated just above, are extremely\r\nsensitive organs, being the chief seat of sexual sense in the female.\r\nAt the lower part is the opening to the vagina, which in the virgin\r\nis usually partially guarded by a thin membrane, the _hymen_. This is\r\nnot always a reliable test of virginity, however, as commonly regarded,\r\nsince it may be destroyed by disease or accident, and may exist even\r\nafter the occurrence of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe vagina extends from the vulva to the lower end of the uterus, which\r\nit incloses, passing between the bladder and the rectum. The lower\r\nextremity of the uterus presents a small opening which leads into its\r\ninterior. Upon either side, at its upper and larger end, is a minute\r\nopening, the mouth of the Fallopian tube. The latter organs extend from\r\nthe uterus outward nearly to the ovaries, toward which they present\r\na number of small filaments, one of which is in contact with each ovary.\r\nThese filaments, together with the interior of the tubes, are covered\r\nwith a peculiar kind of cells, upon which are minute cilia, or hairs,\r\nin constant motion. Very curiously, they all move in the same direction,\r\ntoward the cavity of the uterus. When an ovum escapes from the ovary\r\nin connection with menstruation, it is by these delicate hairs\r\npropelled along a filament of tissue to the Fallopian tube, and thence\r\nby the same means is conveyed to the uterus. It may come in contact\r\nwith the zoosperms at any point between the ovary and the lower orifice\r\nof the uterus, and thus undergo fecundation.\r\n\r\nPuberty.--For a certain period after birth, the sexual organs remain\r\nin a partially developed condition. This period varies in duration with\r\ndifferent animals; in some cases being very brief, in others,\r\ncomprising several years. Upon the attainment of a certain age, the\r\nindividual becomes sexually perfect, and is then capable of the\r\ngenerative act. This period is called puberty. In man, puberty commonly\r\noccurs between the ages of ten and fifteen years, varying considerably\r\nin different climates. In this country, and in other countries of about\r\nthe same latitude, puberty usually occurs at the age of fourteen or\r\nfourteen and one-half years in females, and a few months later in males.\r\nIn cooler climates, as in Norway and Siberia, the change is delayed\r\nto the age of eighteen or nineteen years. In tropical climates it is\r\nhastened, occurring as early as nine or ten years. In warm climates\r\nit is no uncommon thing for a girl to be a mother at twelve; and it\r\nis stated that one of the wives of Mahomet was a mother at ten.\r\n\r\nOther causes besides climate tend to hasten the occurrence of this\r\nchange, as habits, temperament, constitutional tendency, education,\r\nand idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\nHabits of vigorous physical exercise tend to delay the access of puberty.\r\nFor this reason, together with others, country boys and girls generally\r\nmature later than those living in the city by several months, and even\r\na year or two. Anything that tends to excite the emotions hastens\r\npuberty. The excitements of city life, parties, balls, theaters, even\r\nthe competition of students in school, and the various causes of\r\nexcitement to the nervous system which occur in city life, have a\r\ntendency to hasten the occurrence of the change which awakens the sexual\r\nactivities of the system into life. Hence, these influences cannot but\r\nbe considered prejudicial to the best interests of the individual,\r\nmentally, morally, and physically, since it is in every way desirable\r\nthat a change which arouses the passions and gives to them greater\r\nintensity should be delayed rather than hastened.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Diet on Puberty.--The dietary has a not unimportant\r\ninfluence in this respect. Stimulating food, such as pepper, vinegar,\r\nmustard, spices, and condiments generally, together with tea and coffee,\r\nand an excess of animal food, have a clearly appreciable influence in\r\ninducing the premature occurrence of puberty. On this account, if on\r\nno other, should these articles be prohibited to children and youth,\r\nor used very sparingly. Those who advocate the large use of meat by\r\nchildren and youth have not studied this matter closely in all its\r\nbearings. While it is true that children and growing youth require an\r\nabundance of the nitrogenous elements of food which are found\r\nabundantly in beefsteak, mutton, fish, and other varieties of animal\r\nfood, it is also true that in taking those articles of food they take\r\nalong with the nutrient elements properties of a stimulating character,\r\nwhich exert a decidedly detrimental influence upon the susceptible\r\nsystems of children and youth. At the same time, it is possible to obtain\r\nthe same desirable nitrogenous elements in oatmeal, unbolted wheat\r\nflour, peas, beans, and other vegetable productions, which are wholly\r\nfree from injurious properties. We are positive from numerous\r\nobservations on this subject, that a cool, unstimulating, vegetable\r\nor farinaceous diet would deter the development of the sexual organism\r\nfor several months, and perhaps for a year or two.\r\n\r\nWhile it might not be in all cases desirable to do this, it would at\r\nleast be wise to adopt such measures in cases in which the child is\r\nunavoidably exposed to influences which have a tendency to hasten the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nIt is important to add in this connection a word of caution against\r\nthe adoption of a dietary too abstemious in character. It is necessary\r\nthat an abundance of good, wholesome food, rich in the elements of\r\nnutrition, should be taken regularly. There is no doubt that many young\r\nladies have induced conditions of serious disease by actual starvation\r\nof the system. A young woman who attempts to live on strong tea or coffee,\r\nfine-flour bread, and sweet cake, is as certainly starving herself as\r\nthough she were purposely attempting to commit suicide by means of\r\nstarvation, and with as much certainty of the same result.\r\n\r\nBrunettes Naturally Precocious.--It has been observed that in girls\r\nthe occurrence of puberty is earlier in brunettes than in blondes; and\r\nin general it makes its appearance earlier in persons of a nervous or\r\nnervo-bilious temperament than in persons of a lymphatic temperament\r\nor phlegmatic nature.\r\n\r\nCertain nationalities and families are marked by the earlier occurrence\r\nof puberty than in others. In Jews, the change is commonly a year or\r\ntwo in advance of other nationalities in this country. It also occurs\r\nsomewhat sooner in negroes and creoles than in white persons, the\r\nAfrican race seeming to retain something of the precocity occasioned\r\nby the tropical influence of its native clime.\r\n\r\nRemarkable Precocity.--Cases occasionally occur in which puberty makes\r\nits appearance at the age of three or four years. Indeed, a case has\r\nbeen reported in this country in which a female child possessed all\r\nthe characteristics which are usually developed at puberty, from birth.\r\nIn this case the regular periodical changes began at birth.\r\n\r\nPremature Development Occasions Early Decay.--A fact which is of too\r\ngreat importance to allow to pass unnoticed, is that whatever occasions\r\nearly or premature sexual development, also occasions premature decay.\r\nFemales in whom puberty occurs at the age of ten or twelve, by the time\r\ntheir age is doubled, are shriveled and wrinkled with age. At the time\r\nwhen they should be in their prime of health and beauty, they are\r\nprematurely old and broken. Those women who mature late retain their\r\nbeauty and their strength many years after their precocious sisters\r\nhave become old, decrepit, and broken down. Thus, the matrons of thirty\r\nand forty years in colder climates are much more attractive in\r\nappearance than the maidens of sixteen; while quite the reverse is true\r\nin this and other countries where sexual development is unduly\r\nhastened.\r\n\r\nEarly Puberty a Cause for Anxiety.--The unnaturally early appearance\r\nof puberty is a just cause for apprehension, since it usually indicates\r\nan inherent weakness of the constitution. When there are reasons for\r\nfearing its occurrence, active measures should be taken to occasion\r\ndelay if possible. We call especial attention to this point, since there\r\nare many who erroneously suppose the early occurrence of puberty to\r\nbe a sign of superior vigor.\r\n\r\nChanges which Occur at Puberty.--The changes which occur in the two\r\nsexes at this period have been thus described:--\r\n\r\n\"In both sexes, hair grows on the skin covering the _symphysis pubis_,\r\naround the sexual organs, and in the axillae (armpits). In man, the\r\nchest and shoulders broaden, the larynx enlarges, and the voice becomes\r\nlower in pitch from the elongation of the vocal cords; hair grows upon\r\nthe chin, upper lip, and cheeks, and often exists upon the general\r\nsurface of the body more abundantly than in woman.\" The sexual organs\r\nundergo enlargement, and are more frequently excited. The testicles\r\nfirst begin the secretion of the seminal fluid.\r\n\r\n\"In woman, the pelvis and abdomen enlarge, but the whole frame remains\r\nmore slender, the muscles and joints less prominent, the limbs more\r\nrounded and tapering [than in the male]. Locally, both external and\r\ninternal organs undergo a considerable and rapid enlargement. The\r\nmammae enlarge, the ovarian vesicles become dilated, and there is\r\nestablished a periodical discharge of one or more ova, accompanied,\r\nin most cases, by a sanguineous fluid from the cavity of the uterus.\"\r\n\r\nThese changes, so varied and extraordinary, often occur within a very\r\nshort space of time; and as they are liable to serious derangement,\r\nespecially in the female, great care should be taken to secure for the\r\nindividual the most favorable conditions until they are successfully\r\neffected. It is, however, a fact deserving of mention, that many of\r\nthe ills which are developed at this particular period are quite as\r\nmuch the result of previous indiscretions and mismanagement as of any\r\nimmediate cause. A few suggestions with regard to the proper treatment\r\nof individuals at this age may be in place.\r\n\r\n1. Do not allow the boy or girl to be overworked, either mentally or\r\nphysically. Great and important changes are occurring within the body,\r\nand nature should not be overtaxed.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the mind occupied. While excessive labor should be avoided,\r\nidleness should be as carefully shunned. Some light, useful employment\r\nor harmless amusement--better some kind of work--should keep the mind\r\nfully occupied with wholesome subjects.\r\n\r\n3. Abundant exercise out-of-doors is essential for both sexes. Sunshine\r\nand fresh air are as necessary to the development of a human being as\r\nfor the expanding of a flower bud.\r\n\r\n4. Watch carefully the associations of the youth. This should be done\r\nat all times, but especially just at the critical period in question,\r\nwhen the general physical disturbances occurring in the system react\r\nupon the mind and make it peculiarly susceptible to influences,\r\nespecially those of an evil character.\r\n\r\n5. None too much care can be exercised at this important epoch of human\r\nlife, provided it is properly applied; but nothing could be more\r\ndisastrous in its consequences than a weak solicitude which panders\r\nto every whim and gratifies every perverted appetite. _Such_ care is\r\na fatal error.\r\n\r\nMenstruation.--The functional changes which occur in the female are\r\nmuch more marked than those of the male. As already intimated, the\r\nperiodical development and discharge of an ovum by the female, which\r\noccurs after puberty, is accompanied by the discharge of a bloody fluid,\r\nwhich is known as the _flowers_, _menses_, or _catamenia_. The\r\naccompanying symptoms together are termed the process of\r\n_menstruation_, or _being unwell_. This usually occurs, in the human\r\nfemale, once in about four weeks. In special cases, the interval may\r\nbe a week less or a week longer; or the variation may be even greater.\r\nDalton describes the process as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"When the expected period is about to come on, the female is affected\r\nby a certain degree of discomfort and lassitude, a sense of weight in\r\nthe pelvis, and more or less disinclination to society. These symptoms\r\nare in some cases slightly pronounced, in others more troublesome. An\r\nunusual discharge of vaginal mucus then begins to take place, which\r\nsoon becomes yellowish or rusty brown in color, from the admixture of\r\na certain proportion of blood; and by the second or third day, the\r\ndischarge has the appearance of nearly pure blood. The unpleasant\r\nsensations which were at first manifest, then usually subside; and the\r\ndischarge, after continuing for a certain period, begins to grow more\r\nscanty. Its color changes from a pure red to a brownish or rusty tinge,\r\nuntil it finally disappears altogether, and the female returns to her\r\nordinary condition.\"\r\n\r\nThe menstrual function continues active from puberty to about the\r\nforty-fifth year, or during the period of fertility. When it finally\r\ndisappears, the woman is no longer capable of bearing children. The\r\ntime of disappearance is termed the \"change of life,\" or _menopause_.\r\nExceptional cases occur in which this period is greatly hastened,\r\narriving as early as the thirty-fifth year, or even earlier. Instances\r\nhave also been observed in which menstruation continued as late as the\r\nsixtieth year, and even later; but such cases are very rare; and if\r\nprocreation occurs, the progeny is feeble and senile.\r\n\r\nWith rare exceptions, the function is suspended during pregnancy, and\r\nusually, also, during the period of nursing.\r\n\r\nNature of Menstruation.--There has been a great amount of speculation\r\nconcerning the cause and nature of the menstrual process. No entirely\r\nsatisfactory conclusions have been reached, however, except that it\r\nis usually accompanied by the maturation and expulsion from the ovary\r\nof an ovum, which is termed ovulation. But menstruation may occur\r\nwithout ovulation, and, _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nMenstruation is not peculiar to the human female, being represented\r\nin the higher animals by what is familiarly termed the \"rut.\" This is\r\nnot usually a bloody discharge, however, as in the human female, though\r\nsuch a discharge has been observed in the monkey.\r\n\r\nIt has been quite satisfactorily settled that the discharge of the ovum\r\nfrom the ovary generally takes place about the time of the cessation\r\nof the flow. Immediately after the discharge, the sexual desires of\r\nthe female are more intense than at other times. This fact is\r\nparticularly manifest in lower animals. The following remark by Prof.\r\nDalton is especially significant to those who care to appreciate its\r\nbearing:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a remarkable fact, in this connection, that the female of these\r\n[domestic] animals will allow the approaches of the male only during\r\nand immediately after the oestrual period [rut]; that is, just when\r\nthe egg is recently discharged, and ready for impregnation. At other\r\ntimes, when sexual intercourse would be necessarily fruitless, the\r\ninstinct of the animal leads her to avoid it; and the concourse of the\r\nsexes is accordingly made to correspond in time with the maturity of\r\nthe egg and its aptitude for fecundation.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount of fluid lost during the menstrual flow varies greatly with\r\ndifferent individuals. It is estimated at from three ounces to half\r\na pint. In cases of deranged function, it may be much greater than this.\r\nIt is not all blood, however, a considerable portion being mucus. It\r\nis rather difficult to understand why the discharge of so considerable\r\na quantity of blood is required. There is no benefit derived from a\r\nvery copious discharge, as some suppose. Facts seem to indicate that\r\nin general those enjoy the best health who lose but small quantities\r\nof blood in this manner.\r\n\r\nA Critical Period.--As the first occurrence of menstruation is a very\r\ncritical period in the life of a female, and as each recurrence of the\r\nfunction renders her especially susceptible to morbid influences, and\r\nliable to serious derangements, a few hints respecting the proper care\r\nof an individual at these periods may be acceptable.\r\n\r\nImportant Hints.--1. Avoid taking cold. To do this, it is necessary\r\nto avoid exposure; not that a person must be constantly confined in\r\na warm room, for such a course would be the surest way in which to\r\nincrease the susceptibility to cold. Nothing will disturb the menstrual\r\nprocess more quickly than a sudden chilling of the body when in a state\r\nof perspiration, or after confinement in a warm room, by exposure,\r\nwithout sufficient protection, to cold air. A daily bath and daily\r\nexercise in the open air are the best known means of preventing colds.\r\n\r\n2. Intense mental excitement, as well as severe physical labor, is to\r\nbe sedulously avoided during this period. At the time of its first\r\noccurrence, special care should be observed in this direction. Intense\r\nstudy, a fit of anger, sudden grief, or even great merriment, will\r\nsometimes arrest the process prematurely. The feeling of _malaise_\r\nwhich usually accompanies the discharge is by nature intended as a\r\nwarning that rest and quiet are required; and the hint should be\r\nfollowed. Every endeavor should be made to keep the individual\r\ncomfortable, calm, and cheerful. Feelings of apprehension arising from\r\na continual watching of symptoms are very depressing, and should be\r\navoided by occupying the mind in some agreeable manner not demanding\r\nsevere effort, either mental or physical.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that many young women have permanently injured their\r\nconstitutions while at school by excessive mental taxation during the\r\ncatamenial period, to which they were prompted by ambition to excel,\r\nor were compelled by the \"cramming\" system too generally pursued in\r\nour schools, and particularly in young ladies' seminaries. It is not\r\nto be supposed, however, that the moderate amount of sound study\r\nrequired by a correct system of teaching would be injurious to a healthy\r\nyoung woman at any time, and we have no doubt that a very large share\r\nof the injury which has been attributed to over-study during the\r\ncatamenia has been induced by other causes, such as improper dress,\r\nexposure to taking cold, keeping late hours, and improper diet.\r\n\r\nIf there is any class of persons deserving of pity it is that large\r\nclass of girls and young women who are in every large city employed\r\nas clerks, seamstresses, flower makers, and in other taxing and\r\nconfining occupations. In order to keep their situations they are\r\nrequired to be on hand daily, being allowed no opportunity for rest\r\nat the menstrual period. In many cases, too, they are compelled to\r\nremain upon their feet all day behind a counter, or at a work table,\r\neven at periods when a recumbent position is actually demanded by nature.\r\nThere should be less delicacy in relation to this subject on the part\r\nof young women, and more consideration on the part of employers. Here\r\nis a field for philanthropic effort which is well worthy of the best\r\nefforts of any person of influence who will engage in it.\r\n\r\nCustom of Indian Women.--The ease with which Indian women perform the\r\nparturient act is proverbial. They suffer scarcely at all from the pains\r\nof childbirth; and without doubt one reason of this is the preservation\r\nof their sexual health by rest during the menstrual period. At those\r\nseasons they invariably absent themselves from the lodge, and enjoy\r\nabsolute rest. We may readily suppose, from the nature of some of the\r\nMosaic laws, that a custom somewhat similar prevailed among the ancient\r\nHebrew women. If the hardy women of the forest are benefited by rest,\r\ncertainly our more delicate females may be thus benefited. All need\r\na degree of rest; with some it should be absolute.\r\n\r\nThe reckless manner in which some young women treat themselves at the\r\nmenstrual period, is quite appalling to one who is acquainted with the\r\npainful and inveterate character of the evils which arise from such\r\nabuse. It is no uncommon thing for young ladies to attend balls, visit\r\nskating rinks, and otherwise expose themselves to the influences in\r\nevery way the best calculated to do them the most harm at this particular\r\nperiod, observing not the slightest precaution. Such recklessness is\r\nreally criminal; and the sad consequences of physical transgression\r\nare sure to follow. A young lady who allows herself to get wet or chilled,\r\nor gets the feet wet, just prior to or during menstruation, runs the\r\nrisk of imposing upon herself life-long injury. Mothers should look\r\ncarefully after their daughters at these periods, and impress upon them\r\nthe importance of special care.\r\n\r\n3. A third hint, which is applicable to both sexes and at all times,\r\nis the necessity of attending promptly to the demands of nature for\r\nrelief of the bowels and bladder. School-girls are often very negligent\r\nin this respect; and we have seen the most distressing cases of disease\r\nwhich were entirely attributable to this disregard of the promptings\r\nof nature. Obstinate constipation and chronic irritation of the bladder\r\nare common effects. When constipation results, purgatives in the shape\r\nof pills, salts, or \"pleasant purgative pellets,\" are resorted to with\r\nthe certain result of producing only temporary relief, and permanent\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nTo escape these evil consequences, do this: 1. Establish a regular habit\r\nof relieving the bowels daily at a certain hour; 2. Discard laxative\r\nand cathartic drugs of every kind; 3. To aid in securing a regular\r\nmovement of the bowels, make a liberal use of oatmeal, wheat-meal, fruit,\r\nand vegetables, avoiding fine-flour bread, sweetmeats, and condiments;\r\n4. Take daily exercise, as much as possible short of fatigue; if\r\nnecessarily confined indoors, counteract the constipating influence\r\nof sedentary habits by kneading and percussing the bowels with the hands\r\nseveral minutes each day; 5. Never resist the calls of nature a single\r\nmoment, if possible to avoid it. In this case, as in numerous others,\r\n\"delay is dangerous.\" Ladies who desire a sweet breath--and what lady\r\ndoes not--should remember that retained feces are one of the most\r\nfrequent causes of foul breath. The foul odors which ought to pass out\r\nthrough the bowels find their way into the blood and escape at the lungs.\r\nA medical man whose sense of smell is delicate soon learns to know a\r\nconstipated person by the breath. As one says, \"What is more offensive\r\nthan the breath of a costive child?\"\r\n\r\nBoerhaave, a famous old Dutch physician, left to his heirs an elegantly\r\nbound volume in which, he claimed, were written all the secrets of the\r\nscience of physic. After his death, the wonderful book was opened, when\r\nit was found to contain only the following sentence:--\r\n\r\n\"Keep the head cool, the feet warm, and the bowels open.\"\r\n\r\nAn old Scotch physician once gave the following advice to Sir Astley\r\nCooper for the preservation of health:--\r\n\r\n\"Keep in the fear of the Lord, and your bowels open.\"\r\n\r\n4. Perhaps nothing tends more directly to the production of menstrual\r\nderangements--as well as uterine diseases of every sort--than\r\nfashionable modes of dress. We have not space here to give to the subject\r\nthe attention it deserves; it will be found treated of in works devoted\r\nto the subject of dress exclusively. Some of the most glaring evils\r\nare,--\r\n\r\n(1) Unequal distribution of clothing. The trunk, especially the abdomen\r\nand pelvis, is covered with numerous layers of clothing, an extra amount\r\nbeing caused by the overlapping of the upper and lower garments. Very\r\nfrequently, the amount of clothing upon these, the most vital parts,\r\nis excessive. At the same time, the limbs are sometimes almost in a\r\nstate of nudity. A single cotton garment, or at most one of thin flannel,\r\nis the only protection afforded to the limbs beneath the skirts, which\r\noften serve no better purpose than to collect cold air and retain it\r\nin contact with the limbs. A thin stocking is the only protection for\r\nthe ankles, and a thin shoe is the only additional covering afforded\r\nthe feet. Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that a woman catches\r\ncold if she only steps out-of-doors on a chilly or damp day.\r\n\r\n(2) Another glaring fault is in the manner of suspending the skirts.\r\nInstead of being fastened to a waist or suspended so as to give them\r\nsupport from the shoulders, they are hung upon the hips, being drawn\r\ntight at the waist to secure support. By this means, the organs of the\r\npelvis are pressed down out of place. The uterus becomes congested,\r\nand painful menstrual derangements ensue.\r\n\r\n(3) Tight lacing, or compressing the waist with a corset, is a barbarous\r\npractice which produces the same results as the one last mentioned.\r\nReform in all of these particulars is an imperative necessity for every\r\nwoman who desires to secure or retain sexual health.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance that careful attention should be given\r\nto the proper establishment of the menstrual function at the outset\r\nof a woman's life of sexual activity. The first two years will be quite\r\nlikely to have a deciding influence respecting her health during her\r\nwhole future life. If a woman can get through the first two years after\r\npuberty without acquiring any serious uterine or ovarian disease, she\r\nwill stand a good chance of enjoying a good degree of sexual health\r\nduring the balance of her life. The foundation of a great share of the\r\nmany thousands of cases of uterine disease is laid during this period.\r\n\r\nAt this early period the daughter is usually too young to appreciate\r\nthe importance of observing slight deviations from the standard of\r\nhealth, even if she were able to recognize them. Hence it is a duty\r\nwhich no mother should neglect, to inquire into the exact frequency\r\nof the periods, the amount and character of the discharge, and other\r\npoints necessary to ascertain whether or not there is any deviation\r\nfrom the natural condition of health. If there is pain, it is a certain\r\nevidence of something seriously wrong. If there is irregularity in any\r\nparticular, it is a matter well deserving of serious attention.\r\n\r\nMenorrhagia.--This condition is that in which there is a too profuse\r\ndischarge of blood. The system is weakened by the loss, and, so much\r\nso, in many cases, that the individual does not recover her accustomed\r\nstrength before the occurrence of the next period, when she becomes\r\nweakened still more. By a continuance of this periodical loss, the\r\nperson may be reduced to a state of almost utter helplessness. A deathly\r\npallor of the countenance, extreme emaciation, loss of strength, and\r\ngeneral debility mark the effects of the constant drain upon the system.\r\nThousands of young women continue to suffer in this way year after year,\r\nuntil their constitutions are almost hopelessly wrecked, being\r\ndeterred by false notions of modesty or delicacy from consulting a\r\nproper medical adviser and finding relief.\r\n\r\nThe observance of a few simple precautions, and the application of\r\nproper remedies, will check the unnatural loss in most of these cases\r\nvery promptly. In the first place, absolute rest, chiefly in a supine\r\nposition, must be observed not only during the menstrual period, but\r\nfor a few days previous to its commencement. If this does not restrain\r\nthe flow, then cool and even cold compresses may be applied to the lower\r\npart of the abdomen and to the small of the back. In severe cases no\r\nharm will come from the use of an ice-compress, made by inclosing\r\npounded ice between the folds of a towel. Great care must be taken to\r\nmake the hands, arms, feet, and limbs thoroughly warm by the application\r\nof warm bottles and woolen blankets. These measures will scarcely fail\r\nto accomplish the desired end, if employed thoroughly and judiciously.\r\nIt may be well to add just here that the popular fear of using cold\r\nin such cases is groundless. No harm can come so long as the extremities\r\nare kept warm, and the circulation well balanced. The patient must not\r\nbe made chilly, however. It is also of importance that the patient be\r\nkept mentally quiet as well as physically so.\r\n\r\nMuch good will result from these simple measures at the time of the\r\nperiod; but a radical cure can only be effected by removing the cause\r\nof the difficulty. The patient's general health must be improved, and\r\nlocal congestion must be removed. This will be accomplished by\r\nattention to general hygiene, gentle exercise out-of-doors between the\r\nperiods, abundance of good food, tonic baths and other necessary\r\ntreatment if there is derangement of the digestive organs, and daily\r\nhip baths with a local douche. The hip bath should be taken in water\r\nof a temperature of 92 degrees at the beginning. After five minutes\r\nthe temperature may be lowered 5 degrees. After five minutes more, it\r\nmay be lowered a few degrees more. By taking a warm foot bath at 95\r\ndegrees or 100 degrees at the same time, quite a cool bath may be endured\r\nwithout chilling. The bath should be continued 15 minutes to 30 minutes,\r\naccording to the strength of the patient. A shorter bath than this will\r\ndo little good, as the sedative effect will not be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe douche may be taken at the same time with the bath, or before, as\r\nis most convenient. The fountain or syphon syringe should be employed,\r\nand the water used should range from 95 degrees to 105 degrees, as best\r\nsuits the sensations of the patient, being cooled a little toward the\r\nlast. In general, the hot  douche, of a temperature from 100 degrees\r\nto 115 degrees, or even 120 degrees, is not only more agreeable, but\r\nmuch more beneficial.\r\n\r\nBy these simple remedies alone we have successfully treated scores of\r\ncases of this sort. In some cases other remedies may be required, and\r\nin nearly all, accessory remedies can be employed to advantage; but\r\nthe measures described are the main features of the most successful\r\nmode of treatment.\r\n\r\nDysmenorrhoea.--This condition is that in which there is more or less\r\npain and difficulty in connection with the menstrual process. The\r\ncauses are various, as congestion of the uterus, malformation, and\r\ndisplacement or distortion of the organ. Some of these conditions\r\nrequire the attention of a skilled physician to remedy; but all will\r\nbe palliated more or less by a course of treatment similar to that\r\ndescribed for the previous condition. A warm sitz or hip bath just at\r\nthe beginning of the period will often give almost magical relief. The\r\napplication of fomentations over the lower part of the abdomen, and\r\nthe corresponding portion of the spine, or of hot bags, bottles, etc.,\r\nin the same localities, is a measure of great utility. The patient\r\nshould be covered warm in bed, should keep quiet, and great care should\r\nbe used to keep the extremities well warmed. The use of electricity\r\nis a very valuable aid in numerous cases, but this requires the services\r\nof a physician, who should always be employed in severe cases when\r\nwithin reach.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of this form of disease the suffering is so great that\r\nthe constant dread of its periodical repetition becomes a source of\r\ngreat unhappiness, and casts a gloom over the life of an individual\r\nwho would otherwise be as happy as could be desired.\r\n\r\nAmenorrhoea and Chlorosis.--These are serious disorders which require\r\nprompt and vigorous attention. They depend less frequently on disorder\r\nof the sexual organs themselves than upon some disorder of the general\r\nsystem. They usually demand the attention of a competent physician,\r\nand require a more accurate description of their nature and of proper\r\nmodes of treatment than we have space to give here.\r\n\r\nHysteria.--From the most remote ages of medical history this disease\r\nhas been regarded as intimately connected with morbid states of the\r\nfemale organs of generation, especially the uterus. That it is not\r\nexclusively produced by causes of this kind is evidenced by the fact\r\nthat men also sometimes suffer from this curious malady. The phases\r\nwhich it assumes are so numerous that we shall not attempt an accurate\r\ndescription of it; neither is this required, as there are few who are\r\nnot familiar with its peculiar manifestations. It simulates almost\r\nevery disease. Even consumption and other formidable maladies have been\r\nso completely simulated by this disorder as to deceive physicians of\r\nlong experience. We have met cases in which young ladies were supposed\r\nto be in the last stages of pulmonary disease, were apparently gasping\r\nalmost their last breath, panting, coughing, and experiencing the usual\r\nsymptoms which accompany tuberculous disease of the lungs, when, upon\r\nmaking a thorough physical examination of the chest, we could find no\r\nevidence of pulmonary disease. In one case we incurred the everlasting\r\ndispleasure of a young lady by disclosing the real state of affairs;\r\nbut we were repaid in seeing an immediate disappearance of the symptoms,\r\nand complete recovery within six weeks, although the young woman had\r\nbeen considered hopelessly ill by her friends and physicians for six\r\nmonths, and was tenderly watched over, petted, and mourned by friends\r\nas one who must soon fall a victim to fell disease.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of this disease is almost always laid in some\r\nindiscretion by means of which disease of the uterus is induced, and\r\nthe most careful attention to this part of the organism is required.\r\nIt should not be treated as a trivial matter which is wholly the result\r\nof a diseased imagination, and requires only mental treatment, since\r\nit is a real malady, dependent upon morbid states of the system. It\r\nrequires substantial and thorough treatment as much as rheumatism,\r\ndyspepsia, or any other of the numerous diseases to which humanity is\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nPrevention Better than Cure.--We might mention numerous other diseased\r\nconditions which grow out of inattention to the laws of health relating\r\nto the sexual organism; but to dwell longer upon this part of the subject\r\nwould be to depart from the plan of this work, and we must forbear.\r\nThis whole class of maladies is noted for obstinacy in great numbers\r\nof cases when the morbid conditions have existed for a long time. In\r\naddition it should be remarked that some of the most inveterate\r\ndisorders of the nervous system originate in this same manner. The\r\nthousands of ladies who are suffering with spinal irritation, organic\r\ndisease of the spine and other nervous disorders, are witnesses to this\r\nfact. It is apparent, then, that prevention of these serious maladies\r\nby attention to sexual hygiene, especially to the hygiene of\r\nmenstruation at the first establishment of that function, is a matter\r\nof gravest importance. In fact, attention to hygiene is about all that\r\nis required. With this, drugs will be rarely required; without, they\r\nwill be utterly useless.\r\n\r\nExtra-Uterine Pregnancy.--Sometimes the ovum becomes fecundated\r\nbefore reaching the uterus, and, instead of passing onward into that\r\norgan as usual, remains in its position in the Fallopian tube or even\r\non the surface of the ovary. Occasionally an ovum falls into the cavity\r\nof the abdomen instead of passing into the tube. Even in this situation\r\nit may be fecundated. Impregnated ova thus left in abnormal positions,\r\nundergo a greater or lesser degree of development. They commonly result\r\nin the death of the mother.\r\n\r\nTwins.--The human female usually matures but one ovum at each menstrual\r\nperiod, the two ovaries acting alternately. Occasionally two ova are\r\nmatured at once. If fecundation occurs, the result will be a development\r\nof two embryos at the same time. In rare cases, three or even four ova\r\nare matured at once, and by fecundation produce a corresponding number\r\nof embryos. As many as five children have been born alive at one birth,\r\nbut have not lived more than a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of multiple pregnancies may be explained by the\r\nsupposition that ova matured subsequent to the first fecundation are\r\nalso fecundated.\r\n\r\nIn lower animals, the uterus is often divided into two long segments\r\nwhich afford room for the development of a number of young at once.\r\nSome ancient writers make most absurd statements with regard to the\r\nfecundity of females. One declares that the simultaneous birth of seven\r\nor eight infants by the same mother was an ordinary occurrence with\r\nEgyptian women! Other statements still more extravagant are made by\r\nwriters. For example: A traveler in the seventeenth century wrote that\r\nhe saw, in the year 1630, in a church near the Hague, a tablet on which\r\nwas an inscription stating that a certain noted countess gave birth\r\nat once, in the year 1276, to 365 infants, who were all baptized and\r\nchristened, the males being all called John, and the females, Elizabeth.\r\nThey all died on the day of their birth, with their mother, according\r\nto the account, and were buried in the church, where a tablet was erected\r\nto their memory.\r\n\r\nMonsters.--Defects and abnormalities in the development of the embryon\r\nproduce all degrees of deviation from the typical human form. Excessive\r\ndevelopment may result in an extra finger or toe, or in the production\r\nof some peculiar excrescence. Deficiency of development may produce\r\nall degrees of abnormality from the simple harelip to the most frightful\r\ndeficiency, as the absence of a limb, or even of a head. It is in this\r\nmanner that those unfortunate individuals known as hermaphrodites are\r\nformed. An excessive development of some parts of the female generative\r\norgans gives them a great degree of similarity to the external organs\r\nof the male. A deficient development of the male organs renders them\r\nvery similar in form to those of the female. Redundant development of\r\nthe sexual organism sometimes results in the development of both kinds\r\nof organs in the same individual in a state more or less complete. Cases\r\nhave occurred in which it has become necessary, for legal purposes,\r\nto decide respecting the sex of an individual suffering from defective\r\ndevelopment, and it has sometimes been exceedingly difficult to decide\r\nin a given case whether the individual was male or female.\r\n\r\nSuch curious cases as the Carolina twins and Chang and Eng were formerly\r\nsupposed to be the result of the union of two separate individuals.\r\nIt is now believed that they are developed from a single ovum. It has\r\nbeen observed that the primitive trace--described in a previous\r\nsection--sometimes undergoes partial division longitudinally. If it\r\nsplits a little at the anterior end, the individual will have a single\r\nbody with two heads. If a partial division occurs at each end, the\r\nresulting being will possess two heads and two pairs of legs joined\r\nto a single body. More complete division produces a single trunk with\r\ntwo heads, two pairs of arms, and two pairs of legs, as in the case\r\nof the Carolina twins. Still more complete division may result in the\r\nformation of two perfect individuals almost entirely independent of\r\neach other, physiologically, but united by a narrow band, as in the\r\nremarkable Siamese twins, Chang and Eng.\r\n\r\nIn a curious case reported not a great while ago, a partially developed\r\ninfant was amputated from the cheek of a child some time after birth.\r\n\r\nThe precise cause of these strange modifications of development is as\r\nyet, in great degree, a mystery.\r\n\r\nHybrids.--It is a well-known law of biology that no progeny result from\r\nunion of animals of different species. Different varieties of the same\r\nspecies may in some cases form a fertile union, the result of which\r\nis a cross between its two parents, possessing some of the qualities\r\nof each. The mule is the product of such a union between the horse and\r\nthe ass. A curious fact is that the offspring of such unions are\r\nthemselves sterile almost without exception. The reason of this is that\r\nthey do not produce mature elements of generation. In the mule, the\r\nzoosperms are either entirely absent or else very imperfectly\r\ndeveloped; hence the fact that a colt having a mule for its sire is\r\none of the rarest of curiosities, though a few instances have been\r\nreported. This is a wise law of nature to preserve the purity of species.\r\n\r\nLaw of Sex.--If there is a law by which the sex of the developing embryon\r\nis determined, it probably has not yet been discovered. The influence\r\nof the will, the predominant vitality of one or the other of the parents,\r\nand the period at which conception occurs, have all been supposed to\r\nbe the determining cause. A German physician some time since advanced\r\nthe theory that the two testicles and ovaries produce elements of\r\ndifferent sexual character, the right testicle forming zoosperms\r\ncapable of producing only males, and the right ovary producing ova with\r\nthe same peculiarity. The left testis and the left ovary he supposed\r\nto form the female elements. He claimed to have proved his theory by\r\nexperiments upon animals. Even if true, this theory will not be made\r\nof practical importance. It is, in fact, nothing more than a revival\r\nof an old theory held by physicians who flourished more than two\r\nthousand years ago.\r\n\r\nMore recently another German physician has advanced the theory that\r\nthe sex may be controlled at will by observing the time of fecundation.\r\nHe asserts that when fecundation occurs shortly after menstruation,\r\nthe result will be a female; but if impregnation occurs later in the\r\nmonth, and prior to the three or four days preceding the next menstrual\r\nperiod, a male will almost certainly be produced. This theory was\r\nproposed by Prof. Thury of the academy of Geneva, who claims to have\r\nthoroughly tested it in a great variety of ways, and always with an\r\naffirmative result. Dr. Heitzman, of New York, an instructor in\r\npathological histology, and an eminent physiologist, informs us that\r\nhe has thoroughly tested this theory, and finds it to be entirely\r\nreliable. There are numerous facts which seem to corroborate the truth\r\nof this theory, and future investigations may give to it the dignity\r\nof an established physiological fact.\r\n\r\nHeredity.--The phenomena of heredity are among the most interesting\r\nof biological studies. It is a matter of common observation that a child\r\nlooks like its parents. It even happens that a child resembles an uncle\r\nor a grandparent more nearly than either parent. The same peculiarities\r\nare often seen in animals.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this resemblance of offspring to parents and ancestors\r\nhas been made a subject of careful study by scientific men. We shall\r\npresent the most recent theory adopted, which, although it be but a\r\ntheory, presents such an array of facts in its support, and explains\r\nthe phenomena in question so admirably, that it must be regarded as\r\nsomething more than a plausible hypothesis. It is the conception of\r\none of the most distinguished scientists of the age. The theory is known\r\nas the doctrine of _pangenesis_, and is essentially as follows:--\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well known to physiologists that every part of the living\r\nbody is made up of cellular elements which have the power to reproduce\r\nthemselves in the individual, thus repairing the damage resulting from\r\nwaste and injury. Each cell produces cells like itself. It is further\r\nknown that there are found in the body numerous central points of growth.\r\nIn every group of cells is found a central cell from which the others\r\noriginated, and which determines the form of their growth. Every minute\r\nstructure possesses such a center. A simple proof of this fact is found\r\nin the experiment in which the spur of a cock was grafted upon the ear\r\nof an ox. It lived in this novel situation eight years, attaining the\r\nlength of nine inches, and nearly a pound in weight. A tooth has been\r\nmade to grow upon the comb of a cock in a similar manner. The tail of\r\na pig survived the operation of transplanting from its proper position\r\nto the back of the animal, and retained its sensibility. Numerous other\r\nsimilar illustrations might be given.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of pangenesis supposes that these centers of nutrition\r\nform and throw off not only cells like themselves, but very minute\r\ngranules, called gemmules, each of which is capable, under suitable\r\ncircumstances, of developing into a cell like its parent.\r\n\r\nThese minute granules are scattered through the system in great numbers.\r\nThe essential organs of generation, the testicles in the male and the\r\novaries in the female, perform the task of collecting these gemmules\r\nand forming them into sets, each of which constitutes a reproductive\r\nelement, and contains, in rudimentary form, a representative of every\r\npart of the individual, including the most minute peculiarities. Even\r\nmore than this: It is supposed that each ovum and each zoosperm contains\r\nnot only the gemmules necessary to reproduce the individuals who\r\nproduced them, but also a number of gemmules which have been transmitted\r\nfrom the individuals' ancestors.\r\n\r\nIf this theory be true,--and we can see no sound objection to it,--it\r\nis easy to understand all the problems of heredity. The gemmules must\r\nbe very small indeed, but it may be suggested that the molecules of\r\nmatter are smaller still, so this fact is no objection to the theory.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that each spermatozoon, or zoosperm, actually\r\ncontains, in an embryonic condition, every organ and tissue of the\r\nindividual producing it. The same is true of the ovum. In other words,\r\nthe reproductive elements are complete representatives, in miniature,\r\nof the parents, and contain all the elements for producing an offspring\r\npossessing the same peculiarities as the parents. Various modifying\r\ncircumstances sufficiently explain the dissimilarities between\r\nparents and children.\r\n\r\nThis theory is strikingly confirmed by the fact, previously mentioned,\r\nthat in certain cases the ovum alone, a single reproductive element,\r\nmay undergo a degree of development approaching very near to completion.\r\nIt is supposed that fecundation is chiefly necessary to give to the\r\ngemmules the requisite amount of nourishment to insure development.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see hereafter, this matter has a very important bearing\r\nupon several practical questions.\r\n\r\nAnte-Natal Influences.--There can be no manner of doubt that many\r\ncircumstances which it is entirely within the power of the parents to\r\nsupply, exert a powerful influence in molding both the mental and the\r\nphysical characteristics of offspring. By carefully availing himself\r\nof the controlling power given him by a knowledge of this fact, the\r\nstock-raiser is enabled to produce almost any required quality in his\r\nyoung animals. Pigeon fanciers show wonderful skill in thus producing\r\nmost curious modifications in birds. The laws of heredity and\r\ndevelopment are carefully studied and applied in the production of\r\nsuperior horses, cows, dogs, and pigeons; but an application of the\r\nsame principles to the improvement of the human race is rarely thought\r\nof. Human beings are generated in as haphazard and reckless a manner\r\nas weeds are sown by the wind. No account is taken of the possible\r\ninfluence which may be exerted upon the future destiny of the new being\r\nby the physical or mental condition of parents at the moment when the\r\ngerm of life is planted, or by the mental and physical conditions and\r\nsurroundings of the mother while the young life is developing. Indeed,\r\nthe assertion of a modern writer that the poor of our great cities\r\nvirtually \"spawn children,\" with as little thought of influences and\r\nconsequences as the fish that sow their eggs broadcast upon the waters,\r\nis not so great an exaggeration as it might at first sight appear to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nLaw Universal.--Men and women are constantly prone to forget that the\r\ndomain of law is universal. Nothing comes by chance. The revolutions\r\nof the planets, studied by the aid of the telescope, and the gyrations\r\nof the atoms, seen only by the eye of science, are alike examples of\r\nthe controlling influence of law. Notwithstanding this sad ignorance\r\nand disregard of this vitally important subject, the effects of law\r\nare only too clearly manifested in the crowds of wretched human beings\r\nwith which the world is thronged. An old writer sagely remarks, \"It\r\nis the greatest part of our felicity to be well born;\" nevertheless,\r\nit is the sad misfortune of by far the greater portion of humanity to\r\nbe deprived of this inestimable \"felicity.\"\r\n\r\nA Source of Crime.--Who can tell how many of the liars, thieves,\r\ndrunkards, murderers, and prostitutes of our day are less responsible\r\nfor their crimes against themselves, against society, and against\r\nHeaven, than those who were instrumental in bringing them into the\r\nworld? Almost every village has its boy \"who was born drunk,\" a\r\nstaggering, simpering, idiotic representative of a drunken father,\r\nbeastly intoxicated at the very moment when he should have been most\r\nsober.\r\n\r\nAn interesting study of this question has recently been made by Mr.\r\nDugdale, a member of the Prison Association of the State of New York.\r\nWhen visiting the various jails of the State, he found in one six persons\r\ndetained for crimes of various character, between all of whom there\r\nwas a family relation. Upon further inquiry, he found that of the same\r\nfamily there were twenty-nine relatives in the vicinity, seventeen of\r\nwhom were criminals. Still further investigation developed the\r\nfollowing facts:--\r\n\r\nWithin seventy-five years, a family of 1200 persons have sprung from\r\nfive sisters, several of whom were illegitimate, and three of whom were\r\nknown to be unchaste, and who married men whose father was an idle,\r\nthriftless hunter, a hard drinker, and licentious.\r\n\r\nOf this family, the history of but 709 was traced. Of these, the facts\r\nset forth in the following incomplete summary were found to be true:--\r\n\r\n  Paupers, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 280\r\n  Years of pauperism,  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 798\r\n  Criminals, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 140\r\n  Years of infamy, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 750\r\n  Thieves, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  60\r\n  Murderers, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   7\r\n  Prostitutes and adulteresses,  . . . . . . . . . . . 165\r\n  Illegitimate children, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  91\r\n  No. of persons contaminated by syphilitic disease, . 480\r\n  Cost to the State in various ways, . . . . .  $1,308,000\r\n\r\nWithout doubt a complete summary would make this showing still more\r\nappalling, since of the 709 whose histories were traced, it was in many\r\ninstances impossible to determine whether the individuals were guilty\r\nof crime or unchastity or not, even where there were grounds for\r\nsuspicion. Such cases were not included in the summary.\r\n\r\nNo amount of argument on this question could be so conclusive as are\r\nthese simple facts concerning the \"Juke\" family. It is certainly high\r\ntime that our legislators began to awaken to this subject, and consider\r\nwhether it would be an unprofitable experiment to make some attempt\r\nto prevent the multiplication of criminals in this manner. We are not\r\nprepared to offer a plan for securing such an end; but it is very clearly\r\nimportant that something should be done in this direction.\r\n\r\nIt is an established physiological fact that the character of offspring\r\nis influenced by the mental as well as the physical conditions of the\r\nparents at the moment of the performance of the generative act. In view\r\nof this fact, how many parents can regard the precocious--or even\r\nmature--manifestations of sexual depravity in their children without\r\npainful smitings of conscience at seeing the legitimate results of\r\ntheir own sensuality? By debasing the reproductive function to an act\r\nof selfish animal indulgence, they imprinted upon their children an\r\nalmost irresistible tendency to vice. Viewing the matter from this\r\nstand-point, what wonder that licentiousness is rife! that true\r\nchastity is among the rarest of virtues!\r\n\r\nProf. O. W. Holmes remarks on this subject: \"There are people who think\r\nthat everything may be done if the doctor, be he educator or physician,\r\nbe only called in season. No doubt; but _in season_ would often be a\r\nhundred or two years before the child was born, and people never send\r\nso early as that.\" \"Each of us is only the footing up of a double column\r\nof figures that goes back to the first pair. Every unit tells, and some\r\nof them are _plus_ and some _minus_. If the columns don't add up right,\r\nit is commonly because we can't make out all of the figures.\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the throngs of deaf, blind, crippled, idiotic\r\nunfortunates who were \"born so,\" together with a still larger class\r\nof dwarfed, diseased, and constitutionally weak individuals, are the\r\nlamentable results of the violation of some sexual law on the part of\r\ntheir progenitors.\r\n\r\nIf parents would stop a moment to consider the momentous\r\nresponsibilities involved in the act of bringing into existence a human\r\nbeing; if they would reflect that the qualities imparted to the new\r\nbeing will affect its character to all eternity; if they would recall\r\nthe fact that they are about to produce a mirror in which will be\r\nreflected their own characters divested of all the flimsy fabrics which\r\ndeceive their fellow-men, revealing even the secret imaginings of their\r\nhearts,--there would surely be far less of sin, disease, and misery\r\nborn into the world than at the preset day; but we dare not hope for\r\nsuch a reform. To effect it, would require such a revolution in the\r\ncustoms of society, such a radical reform in the habits and characters\r\nof individuals, as nothing short of a temporal millennium would be able\r\nto effect.\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable that some writers have greatly exaggerated the\r\npossible results which may be attained by proper attention to the laws\r\nunder consideration. All cannot be equally beautiful; every child\r\ncannot be a genius; the influence of six thousand years of transgression\r\ncannot be effaced in a single generation; but persevering,\r\nconscientious efforts to comply with every requirement of health,\r\npurity, morality, and the laws of nature, will accomplish wonders in\r\nsecuring healthy children with good dispositions, brilliant intellects,\r\nand beautiful bodies.\r\n\r\nThis is not the proper place to describe in detail a plan to be pursued;\r\nbut the few hints given, if rightly appreciated, may enable those\r\ninterested in the subject to plan for themselves a proper course. In\r\nconcluding the subject, we may summarize its chief points as follows,\r\nfor the purpose of impressing them more fully upon the mind:--\r\n\r\n1. If a child is begotten in lust, its lower passions will as certainly\r\nbe abnormally developed as peas will produce peas, or potatoes produce\r\npotatoes. If the child does not become a rake or a prostitute, it will\r\nbe because of uncommonly fortunate surroundings, or a miracle of divine\r\ngrace. But even then, what terrible struggles with sin and vice, with\r\nfoul thoughts and lewd imaginations--the product of a naturally\r\nabnormal mind--must such an individual suffer! If he is unsuccessful\r\nin the conflict, is he alone to blame? Society, his fellow-men, will\r\ncensure him alone; but He who knoweth all the secrets of human life\r\nwill pass a more lenient judgment on the erring one, and mete out\r\npunishment where it most belongs.\r\n\r\n2. The same remarks apply with equal force to the transmission of other\r\nqualities. If the interest of the parents is only for self, with no\r\nthought for the well-being of the one whose destiny is in their hands,\r\nthey can expect naught but a selfish character, a sordid, greedy\r\ndisposition, in the child.\r\n\r\n3. The influence of the father is, at the outset, as great as that of\r\nthe mother. The unhappy or immoral thoughts of one alone at the critical\r\nmoment when life is imparted, may fix for eternity a foul blot upon\r\na character yet unformed.\r\n\r\n4. If during gestation the mother is fretful, complaining, and\r\nexacting; if she requires to be petted and waited upon; if she gratifies\r\nevery idle whim and indulges every depraved desire and perverted\r\nappetite--as thousands of mothers do--the result will surely be a\r\npeevish, fretful child, that will develop into a morose and irritable\r\nman or woman, imperious, unthankful, disobedient, willful, gluttonous,\r\nand vicious.\r\n\r\nIf such undesirable results would be avoided, the following suggestions\r\nshould be regarded:--\r\n\r\n1. For the beginning of a new life, select the most favorable time,\r\nwhich will be when the bodily health is at its height; when the mind\r\nis free from care and anxiety; when the heart is joyous, cheerful, and\r\nfilled with hope, love, high aspirations, pure and beautiful thoughts.\r\nIf, as one writer says, it is the duty of every human pair engaging\r\nin the reproductive act to bring into existence the most perfect\r\nspecimen of the race of which they are capable, then it becomes a\r\nmonstrous crime to enter into relations which may produce a contrary\r\nresult. This may be a truth hard to accept, but who is prepared to\r\ndispute it on logical or moral grounds?\r\n\r\n2. If a child has been properly conceived, the duty then devolves upon\r\nthe mother to secure its proper development. Is beauty desired, let\r\nthe mother be surrounded with beautiful objects; and let her mind dwell\r\nupon such objects. If an active mind and brilliant intellect are\r\nrequired, the mother should devote considerable time to study and\r\nmental labor of a pleasant nature. The moral nature should be carefully\r\ncultivated, to insure a lovely disposition. No angry words or unhappy\r\nfeelings should be tolerated. Purity of heart and life should be\r\nmaintained. The husband should do his part by supplying favorable\r\nsurroundings, suggesting cheerful thoughts, and aiding mental culture.\r\n\r\n3. After birth, the mother still possesses a molding influence upon\r\nthe development of her child through the lacteal secretion. Every\r\nmother knows how speedily the child will suffer if nursed when she is\r\nexhausted by physical labor or when suffering from nervous excitement,\r\nas anger or grief. These facts show the influence which the mental\r\nstates of the mother exert upon the child even when the act of nursing\r\nis the only physical bond between them.\r\n\r\nIt would be a happy day for the race which should witness the recognition\r\nof the fact that infants, even human beings in embryo, possess rights\r\nwhich are as sacred as those of adult human beings.\r\n\r\nCircumcision.--The fold of integument called the prepuce, which has\r\nbeen previously described, has upon its inner surface a large number\r\nof glands which produce a peculiar secretion. Under certain\r\ncircumstances, and from inattention to personal cleanliness, this\r\nsecretion may accumulate, and then often becomes the cause of\r\nirritation and serious disease. To prevent such disorders, and to\r\ninsure cleanliness, the Jewish law required the removal of the prepuce,\r\nwhich constituted the rite of circumcision. The same practice is\r\nfollowed by several modern nations dwelling in tropical climates; and\r\nit can scarcely be doubted that it is a very salutary one, and has\r\ncontributed very materially to the maintenance of that proverbial\r\nnational health for which the Jews are celebrated. Eminent physicians\r\nhave expressed the opinion that the practice would be a salutary one\r\nfor all men. The maintenance of scrupulous cleanliness, by daily\r\ncleansing, is at least an imperative duty.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, females are also circumcised by removal of the\r\nnymphae. The object is the same as that of circumcision in the male.\r\nThe same evils result from inattention to local cleanliness, and the\r\nsame measure of prevention, daily cleansing, is necessitated by a\r\nsimilar secretion. Local cleanliness is greatly neglected by both sexes.\r\nDaily washing should begin with infancy and continue through life, and\r\nwill prevent much disease.\r\n\r\nCastration.--This operation consists in the removal of the testes of\r\nthe male. It does not at once obliterate the sexual sense, especially\r\nif performed after puberty, but of course renders the individual\r\nimpotent, or incapable of reproduction. Persons upon whom it has been\r\nperformed are called eunuchs. It was a very common custom in ancient\r\ntimes, being usually prompted by the jealousy of rulers, who allowed\r\nno males but eunuchs to associate with their wives and concubines. The\r\neffect upon the male is to render him effeminate in appearance and weak\r\nin mind. If performed before puberty, the growth of the beard is scanty,\r\nand the voice never acquires that deepness of tone natural to the\r\nmasculine voice.\r\n\r\nAn analogous operation, termed _spaying_, is performed upon females,\r\nconsisting in the removal of the ovaries; effects similar to those in\r\nthe male, _sterility_ without entire immediate loss of sexual sense,\r\nbeing the usual result. Spaying is much more rarely performed than\r\ncastration. Both operations are now quite rare, seldom being resorted\r\nto except in surgical cases. Castration is still practiced in some\r\nEastern countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEXUAL RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust in proportion as the perpetuation of the race is more important\r\nthan the existence of any single individual, the organs of reproduction\r\nmay in a certain sense be said to rank higher than any other organs\r\nof the human frame, since to them is intrusted the important duty of\r\nperforming that most marvelous of all vital processes, the production\r\nof human beings. That this high rank in the vital economy is recognized\r\nby nature, is shown by the fact that she has attached to the abuse of\r\nthe generative function the most terrible penalties which can be\r\ninflicted upon a living being. The power of abuse seems to be almost\r\nexclusively confined to man; hence, we find him the only one of all\r\nliving creatures subject to the awful penalties of sexual\r\ntransgression.\r\n\r\nThe _use_ of the reproductive function is perhaps the highest physical\r\nact of which man is capable; its _abuse_ is certainly one of the most\r\ngrievous outrages against nature which it is possible for him to\r\nperpetrate. No observing person can doubt that the sexual relations\r\nof men and women determine in a great degree their happiness or misery\r\nin life. This subject, then, deserves due attention and careful\r\nconsideration. It is of no use to scout it; for it will inevitably\r\nobtrude itself upon us, no matter now sedulously we attempt to avoid\r\nit. It can be rightly considered only with the most perfect candor,\r\nwith the mind unbiased by passion, and prayerfully anxious to know and\r\n_do_ what is right.\r\n\r\nIn the following paragraphs of this section are considered some of the\r\nevils out of which grows much of the sexual suffering of men and women:--\r\n\r\nSexual Precocity.--There are two periods in human life when the sexual\r\ninstincts should be totally dormant; and they are so when nature is\r\nnot perverted. The first is the period reaching from infancy to puberty.\r\nThe second is the period reached in advanced age.\r\n\r\nIf raised strictly in accordance with natural law, children would have\r\nno sexual notions or feelings before the occurrence of puberty. No\r\nprurient speculation about sexual matters would enter their heads.\r\nUntil that period, the reproductive system should lie dormant in its\r\nundeveloped state. No other feeling should be exhibited between the\r\nsexes than that brotherly and sisterly affection which is so admirable\r\nand becoming.\r\n\r\nFortunate, indeed, would it be for humanity if this natural state always\r\nexisted; but it is a lamentable fact that it is rarely seen in modern\r\nhomes. Not infrequently, evidences of sexual passion are manifested\r\nbefore the child has hardly learned to walk. It has been suggested that\r\nthis precocity is nothing remarkable or unnatural, since it is often\r\nseen in little lambs and other young animals. To this it is only\r\nnecessary to reply that the development of the sexual instincts\r\nperfectly corresponds with the longevity of the animal; if short-lived,\r\nlike the sheep, only a short period intervenes between birth and the\r\nattainment of the sexual appetite and virility. If the animal is\r\nintended for long life, as is the case with man, these manifestations\r\nare delayed until a much later period, or should be. Certain insects\r\nperform the sexual act as soon as they acquire their perfect form; but\r\nthey perish as soon as the act is completed.\r\n\r\nAstonishing Ignorance.--It is astonishing how ignorant and indifferent\r\nthe majority of people are upon this subject. A friend related to us\r\nan incident which fairly illustrates the terrible apathy which prevails\r\namong parents. While teaching a country school, he learned that a large\r\nnumber of children, boys and girls, of ages varying from eight to twelve\r\nand fourteen years, were in the habit of collecting together in barns\r\nand other secluded places, and in a state of nudity imitating the \"Black\r\nCrook\" with all possible additional nastiness. Horrified at such a\r\nmonstrous evil, he hastened to inform the parents of the corruption\r\nin their midst. Imagine his astonishment when he was met with an\r\nindifferent laugh and the response, \"Pooh! it's only natural; perfectly\r\nharmless; _just like little pigs!_\" As though pigs were models for human\r\nbeings!\r\n\r\nIt is not pleasant to consider what must have been the moral status\r\nof parents who could hold such views; and it is no wonder that they\r\nshould produce such children. Doubtless they learned, too late, that\r\nthose \"natural\" manifestations were the outgrowth of incipient vices,\r\nplanted and fostered by themselves, which in later years destroyed\r\nshame and gave loose rein to lust.\r\n\r\nOften the manifestation of sexual precocity is less gross, but almost\r\nequally fraught with danger, nevertheless. Dr. Acton, a distinguished\r\nEnglish surgeon whom we shall frequently quote, makes the following\r\nexcellent remarks upon this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"Slight signs are sufficient to indicate when a boy has this unfortunate\r\ntendency. He shows marked preferences. You will see him single out one\r\ngirl, and evidently derive an unusual pleasure (for a boy) in her\r\nsociety. His _penchant_ does not take the ordinary form of a boy's good\r\nnature, but little attentions that are generally reserved for a later\r\nperiod prove that his feeling is different, and sadly premature. He\r\nmay be apparently healthy, and fond of playing with other boys; still\r\nthere are slight, but ominous, indications of propensities fraught with\r\ndanger to himself. His play with the girl is different from his play\r\nwith his brothers. His kindness to her is a little too ardent. He follows\r\nher, he does not know why. He fondles her with a tenderness painfully\r\nsuggestive of a vague dawning of passion. No one can find fault with\r\nhim. He does nothing wrong. Parents and friends are delighted at his\r\ngentleness and politeness, and not a little amused at the early\r\nflirtation. If they were wise, they would rather feel profound anxiety;\r\nand he would be an unfaithful or unwise medical friend who did not,\r\nif an opportunity occurred, warn them that such a boy, unsuspicious\r\nand innocent as he is, ought to be carefully watched and removed from\r\nevery influence calculated to foster his abnormal propensities.\r\n\r\n\"The premature development of the sexual inclination is not alone\r\nrepugnant to all we associate with the term childhood, but is also\r\nfraught with danger to dawning manhood. On the judicious treatment of\r\na case such as has been sketched, it probably depends whether the\r\ndangerous propensity shall be so kept in check as to preserve the boy's\r\nhealth and innocence, or whether one more shattered constitution and\r\nwounded conscience shall be added to the victims of sexual precocity\r\nand careless training. It ought not to be forgotten that in such cases\r\na quasi-sexual power often accompanies these premature sexual\r\ninclinations. Few, perhaps, except medical men, know how early in life\r\na mere infant may experience erections. Frequently it may be noticed\r\nthat a little child, on being taken out of bed in the morning, cannot\r\nmake water at once. It would be well if it were recognized by parents\r\nand nurses that this often depends upon a more or less complete\r\nerection.\"\r\n\r\nWe have been not more disgusted than shocked to see parents, whose\r\nintelligence ought to teach them better, not only winking at, but\r\nactually encouraging, these premature manifestations of passion in\r\ntheir children. They may yet learn, by bitter experience, the folly\r\nof their course, unless they make the discovery in time to avert the\r\ncalamitous results which threaten the future of their children, by\r\ncareful reformatory training.\r\n\r\nInherited Passion.--It is important to inquire the cause of this\r\nprecocity. Said a father of our acquaintance, when remonstrated with\r\nfor encouraging his infant son in a ridiculous flirtation, \"I did just\r\nso when I was of his age.\" In this case the cause was evident. The child\r\nwas only acting out the disposition bequeathed him by his parent. How\r\noften do the secret follies of parents stand out in bold relief in their\r\nchildren. Such a legacy is nothing to be proud of.\r\n\r\nWe again quote from Dr. Acton some observations on the causes of this\r\ndisorder,--for a grave disorder it is,--as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I should specify _hereditary_ predisposition as by no means the least\r\ncommon.... I believe that, as in body and mind, so also in the passions,\r\nthe sins of the father are frequently visited on the children. No man\r\nor woman, I am sure, can have habitually indulged the sexual passions ...\r\nwithout, at least, running the risk of finding that a disposition to\r\nfollow a similar career has been inherited by the offspring. It is in\r\nthis way only that we can explain the early and apparently almost\r\nirresistible propensity in generation after generation indulging\r\nsimilar habits and feelings.\"\r\n\r\nVarious Causes of Sexual Precocity.--Another very powerful\r\npredisposing cause of sexual precocity will be alluded to under the\r\nhead of \"Marital Excesses.\" The irritation caused by worms in the rectum,\r\nby local irritation or uncleanliness, or by irritation of the bladder,\r\nare exciting causes which are not infrequent. The latter cause is\r\nindicated by another symptom, the frequent wetting of the bed at night.\r\nSuch a symptom doubly demands immediate attention.\r\n\r\nThe juvenile parties so common now-a-days, at which little ones of both\r\nsexes, of ages varying from four or five years to ten or twelve, with\r\nwonderful precocity and truthfulness imitate the conduct of their\r\nelders at fashionable dinners, cannot be too much deprecated. Such\r\nassociations of the sexes have a strong tendency to develop prematurely\r\nthe distinctive peculiarities of the sexes. This is well evidenced by\r\nthe fact that on such occasions one of the most common and popular\r\nentertainments is sham marriages. Parents greatly err in encouraging\r\nor allowing their children to engage in amusements of so dangerous a\r\ncharacter. They are productive of no good, and are almost without\r\nexception productive of positive and serious injury.\r\n\r\nModern modes of life, improper clothing, the forcing system of cramming\r\nin schools, the immodest example of older persons, and especially the\r\nirritating, stimulating articles of diet which are daily set before\r\nchildren, as well as older people, undoubtedly have a powerful\r\ninfluence in stimulating the development of the sexual passions. This\r\nsubject is again referred to under the heading, \"Chastity.\"\r\n\r\nObscene books and papers, lewd pictures, and evil communications are\r\ntelling causes which will be further noticed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSenile Sexuality.--As with childhood, old age is a period in which the\r\nreproductive functions are quiescent unless unnaturally stimulated.\r\nSexual life begins with puberty, and, in the female, ends at about the\r\nage of forty-five years, the period known as the _menopause_, or _turn\r\nof life_. At this period, according to the plainest indications of\r\nnature, all functional activity should cease. If this law is\r\ndisregarded, disease, premature decay, possibly local degenerations,\r\nwill be sure to result. Nature cannot be abused with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe generative power of the male is retained somewhat longer than that\r\nof the female, and by stimulation may be indulged at quite an advanced\r\nage, but only at the expense of shortening life, and running the risk\r\nof sudden death. Says Parise, \"One of the most important pieces of\r\ninformation which a man in years can attain is 'to learn to become old\r\nbetimes,' if he wishes to attain old age. Cicero, we are told, was asked\r\nif he still indulged in the pleasures of love. 'Heaven forbid,' replied\r\nhe, 'I have forsworn it as I would a savage and a furious master.'\"\r\n\r\nSome learned physicians place the proper limit of man's functional\r\nactivity at fifty years, if he would not render himself guilty of\r\nshortening his days by sensuality. Other reasons for this course will\r\nappear hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhen the passions have been indulged, and their diminishing vigor\r\nstimulated, a horrid disease, _satyriasis_, not infrequently seizes\r\nupon the imprudent individual, and drives him to the perpetration of\r\nthe most loathsome crimes and excesses. Passions cultivated and\r\nencouraged by gratification through life will thus sometimes assert\r\na total supremacy in old age.\r\n\r\nMarriage.--The scope and plan of this work will allow of but the\r\nbriefest possible consideration of this subject upon which volumes have\r\nbeen written, much to no purpose other than the multiplication of books.\r\nWe shall devote no space to consideration of the origin of the\r\ninstitution, its expediency, or varied relations, as these topics are\r\nforeign to the character of this work.\r\n\r\nThe primary object of marriage was, undoubtedly, the preservation of\r\nthe race, though there are other objects which, under special\r\ncircumstances, may become paramount even to this. These latter we\r\ncannot consider, as only the relations of the reproductive functions\r\nin marriage come properly within our province.\r\n\r\nThe first physiological question to be considered is concerning the\r\nproper age for marriage.\r\n\r\nTime to Marry.--Physiology fixes with accuracy the earliest period at\r\nwhich marriage is admissible. This period is that at which the body\r\nattains complete development, which is not before twenty in the female,\r\nand twenty-four in the male. Even though the growth may be completed\r\nbefore these ages, ossification of the bones is not fully effected,\r\nso that development is incomplete.\r\n\r\nAmong most modern nations, the civil laws fixing the earliest date of\r\nmarriage seem to have been made without any reference to physiology,\r\nor with the mistaken notion that puberty and nubility are identical.\r\nIt is interesting to note the different ages established by different\r\nnations for the entrance of the married state. The degenerating Romans\r\nfixed the ages of legal marriage at thirteen for females, and fifteen\r\nfor males. The Grecian legislator, Lycurgus, placed the ages at\r\nseventeen for the female, and thirty-seven for the male. Plato fixed\r\nthe ages at twenty and thirty years. In Prussia, the respective ages\r\nare fifteen and nineteen; in Austria, sixteen and twenty; in France,\r\nsixteen and eighteen, respectively.\r\n\r\nSays Mayer, \"In general, it may be established that the normal epoch\r\nfor marriage is the twentieth year for women, and the twenty-fourth\r\nfor men.\"\r\n\r\nApplication of the Law of Heredity.--A moment's consideration of the\r\nphysiology of heredity will disclose a sufficient reason why marriage\r\nshould be deferred until the development of the body is wholly complete.\r\nThe matrimonial relation implies reproduction. Reproduction is\r\neffected through the union of the ovum with the zoosperm. These elements,\r\nas we have already seen, are complete representatives of the\r\nindividuals producing them, being composed--as supposed--of minute\r\ngemmules which are destined to be developed into cells and organs in\r\nthe new being, each preserving its resemblance to the cell within the\r\nparent which produced it. The perfection of the new being, then, must\r\nbe largely dependent on the integrity and perfection of the sexual\r\nelements. If the body is still incomplete, the reproductive elements\r\nmust also be incomplete; and, in consequence, the progeny must be\r\nequally immature.\r\n\r\nEarly Marriage.--The preceding paragraph contains a sufficient reason\r\nfor condemning early marriage; that is, marriage before the ages\r\nmentioned. It is probable that even the ages of twenty and twenty-four\r\nare too early for those persons whose development is uncommonly slow.\r\nBut there are other cogent reasons for discountenancing early marriages,\r\nalso drawn from the physiology of reproduction, to say nothing of the\r\nmany reasons which might be urged on other grounds.\r\n\r\n1. During the development of the body, all its energies are required\r\nin perfecting the various tissues and organs. There is no material to\r\nbe spared for any foreign purpose.\r\n\r\n2. The reproductive act is the most exhaustive of all vital acts. Its\r\neffect upon an undeveloped person is to retard growth, weaken the\r\nconstitution, and dwarf the intellect.\r\n\r\n3. The effects upon the female are even worse than those upon the male;\r\nfor, in addition to the exhaustion of nervous energy, she is compelled\r\nto endure the burdens and pains of child-bearing when utterly\r\nunprepared for such a task, to say nothing of her unfitness for the\r\nother duties of a mother. With so many girl-mothers in the land, is\r\nit any wonder that there are so many thousands of unfortunate\r\nindividuals who never seem to get beyond childhood in their\r\ndevelopment? Many a man at forty years is as childish in mind, and as\r\nimmature in judgment, as a well-developed lad of eighteen would be.\r\nThey are like withered fruit plucked before it was ripe; they can never\r\nbecome like the mellow and luscious fruit allowed to mature properly.\r\nThey are unalterably molded; and the saddest fact of all is that they\r\nwill give to their children the same imperfections; and the children\r\nwill transmit them to another generation, and so the evil will go on\r\nincreasing, unless checked by extinction.\r\n\r\nMutual Adaptation.--Another question of very great importance is that\r\nof the mutual adaptation of the individuals. To this question we can\r\ndevote but a very brief consideration, and that will be more of the\r\nnature of criticism than of a set of formal rules for governing\r\nmatrimonial alliances.\r\n\r\nA writer of some note, whose work on this and kindred subjects has had\r\nquite an extensive circulation, advocates with great emphasis the\r\ntheory that parties contemplating marriage should in all cases select\r\nfor partners individuals as nearly like themselves as possible. Exact\r\nduplicates would, in his opinion, make the most perfect union\r\nattainable. To make his theory practicable, he is obliged to fall back\r\nupon phrenology; and directs that a man seeking a wife, or a woman\r\nseeking a husband, should obtain a phrenological chart of his head and\r\nthen send it around until a counterpart is found. If the circle of one's\r\nacquaintance is so fortunate as to contain no one cursed with the same\r\npropensities or idiosyncrasies as himself, the newspapers are to be\r\nbrought into requisition as a medium of advertising.\r\n\r\nIf so strange a doctrine as this were advocated by an obscure individual\r\nin some secluded hamlet, or found only in the musty volumes of some\r\nforgotten author, it surely would be unworthy of notice; but coming\r\nas it does from a quite popular writer, and being coupled with a great\r\namount of really valuable truth, it is sufficiently important to\r\ndeserve refutation. A brief glance at the practical working of the\r\ntheory will be a sufficient exposure of its falsity.\r\n\r\nAccording to this rule, a man or woman of large combativeness should\r\nselect a partner equally inclined to antagonism; then we should\r\nhave--what? the elements of a happy, contented, harmonious life? No;\r\ninstead, either a speedy lawsuit for divorce, or a continual domestic\r\nbroil, the nearest approach to a mundane purgatory possible. The\r\nselfish, close-fisted, miserly money-catcher must marry a woman\r\nequally sordid and stingy. Then together they could hoard up, for moths\r\nand rust to destroy, or for interested relatives to quarrel over, the\r\npictorial greenback and the glittering dollar, each scrimping the other\r\ndown to the finest point above starvation and freezing, and finally\r\ndying, to be forgotten as soon as dead by their fellow-men, and sent\r\namong the goats at the great assizes. A shiftless spendthrift must\r\nchoose for a helpmeet (?) an equally slovenly, thriftless wife. A man\r\nwith a crotchet should select a partner with the same morbid fancy.\r\nA man whose whole mental composition gravitates behind his ears, must\r\nfind a mate with the same animal disposition. An individual whose mental\r\norganization is sadly unbalanced, is advised to seek for a wife a woman\r\nwith the same deficiencies and abnormalities.\r\n\r\nAny one can see at a glance the domestic disasters which such a plan\r\nof proceeding would entail. Men and women of unbalanced temperaments\r\nwould become more unbalanced. An individual of erroneous tendencies,\r\ninstead of having the constant check of the example and admonitions\r\nof a mate of opposite tendencies, would be, by constant example,\r\nhastened onward in his sinful ways. Thus, to all but a very small\r\nproportion of humanity, the married state would be one of infelicity\r\nand degeneration.\r\n\r\nAnd what would be the progeny of such unions? The peculiarities and\r\npropensities of the parents, instead of being modified and perhaps\r\nobliterated in the children by corresponding differences in character,\r\nwould be doubly exaggerated. The children of selfish parents would be\r\nthieves; those of spendthrifts, beggars; those of crotchety parents,\r\nmonomaniacs; those born of sensual parents, beastly debauchees. A few\r\ngenerations of such a degenerating process would either exterminate\r\nthe race or drive it back to Darwin's ancestral ape.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred, from our strictures upon the theory mentioned,\r\nthat we would advocate the opposite course, that is, the contraction\r\nof marriage by individuals of wholly dissimilar tastes, aims, and\r\ntemperaments. Such alliances would doubtless be quite as wretched in\r\ntheir results as those of an opposite character. It is with this as\r\nwith nearly all other subjects; the true course lies between the two\r\nextremes. Parties who are negotiating a life partnership should be\r\ncareful to assure themselves that there exists a sufficient degree of\r\ncongeniality of temperament to make such close and continued\r\nassociation agreeable.\r\n\r\nDisparity of Age.--Both nature and custom seem to indicate that the\r\nhusband should be a little older than the wife. Several reasons might\r\nbe given for this; but we need not mention them. When, however, the\r\ndifference of ages reaches such an extreme as thirty, forty, even fifty\r\nor more years, nature is abused, good taste is offended, and even\r\nmorality is shocked. Such ill-sorted alliances are disastrous to both\r\nparties, and scarcely more to one than the other. An old man who forms\r\na union with a young girl scarce out of her teens--or even younger--can\r\nscarcely have any very elevated motive for his action, and he certainly\r\nexposes himself to the greatest risk of sudden death, while insuring\r\nhis premature decay. A king once characterized such a course as \"the\r\npleasantest form of suicide.\" It is doubtless suicidal, but we suspect\r\nthere are some phases of such an unnatural union which are not very\r\nenjoyable.\r\n\r\nOne reason of the great danger of such marriages to the old is the\r\nexhaustive effects of the sexual act. As previously noted, in some\r\nanimals it causes immediate death. Dr. Acton makes the following\r\npertinent remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"So serious, indeed, is the paroxysm of the nervous system produced\r\nby the sexual spasm, that its immediate effect is not always unattended\r\nwith danger, and men with weak hearts have died in the act. Every now\r\nand then we learn that men are found dead on the night of their wedding.\"\r\n\r\n\"However exceptional these cases are, they are warnings, and should\r\nserve to show that an act which _may_ destroy the weak should not be\r\ntampered with, even by the strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are old men who marry young wives, and who pay the penalty by\r\nbecoming martyrs to paralysis, softening of the brain, and driveling\r\nidiocy.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gardner quotes the Abbe Maury, as follows: \"I hold as certain that\r\nafter fifty years of age a man of sense ought to renounce the pleasures\r\nof love. Each time that he allows himself this gratification is _a\r\npellet of earth thrown upon his coffin_.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gardner further says: \"Alliances of this sort have taken place in\r\nevery epoch of humanity, from the time of the patriarchs to the present\r\nday,--alliances repugnant to nature,--between men bordering on\r\ndecrepitude and poor young girls, who are sacrificed by their parents\r\nfor position, or who sell themselves for gold. There is in these\r\nmonstrous alliances something which we know not how to brand\r\nsufficiently energetically, in considering the reciprocal relations\r\nof the pair thus wrongfully united, and the lot of the children which\r\nmay result from them. Let us admit, for an instant, that the marriage\r\nhas been concluded with the full consent of the young girl, and that\r\nno external pressure has been exerted upon her will--as is generally\r\nthe rule--it will none the less happen that reflection and experience\r\nwill tardily bring regrets, and the sharper as the evil will be without\r\nremedy; but if compulsion, or what is often the same thing, _persuasion_,\r\nhad been employed to obtain the consent which the law demands, the\r\nresult would have been more prompt and vehement. From this moment the\r\ncommon life becomes odious to the unhappy victim, and _culpable hopes_\r\nwill arise in her desolate heart, so heavy is the chain she carries.\r\nIn fact, the love of the old man becomes ridiculous and horrid to her,\r\nand we cannot sufficiently sympathize with the unfortunate person whose\r\nduty [?] it is to submit to it. If we think of it an instant, we shall\r\nperceive a repulsion, such as is only inspired by the idea of incest....\r\nSo what do we oftenest observe? Either the woman violently breaks the\r\ncursed bands, or she resigns herself to them; and then she seeks to\r\nfill up the void in her soul by adulterous amours. Such is the somber\r\nperspective of the sacrilegious unions which set at defiance the most\r\nrespectable instincts, the most noble desires, and the most legitimate\r\nhopes. Such, too, are the terrible chastisements reserved for the\r\nthoughtlessness or foolish pride of these dissolute gray-beards, who\r\nprodigalize the last breath of their life in search of depraved\r\nvoluptuousness.\"\r\n\r\nThe parents, the perpetrators of such an outrage against nature, are\r\nnot the only sufferers. Look at the children which they bring into the\r\nworld! Let Dr. Gardner speak again:--\r\n\r\n\"Children, the issue of old men, are habitually marked by a serious\r\nand sad air spread over their countenances, which is manifestly very\r\nopposite to the infantile expression which so delights one in the little\r\nchildren of the same age engendered under other conditions. As they\r\ngrow up, their features take on more and more the senile character;\r\nso much so that every one remarks it, and the world regards it as a\r\nnatural thing. The old mothers pretend that it is an old head on young\r\nshoulders. They predict an early death to these children, and the event\r\nfrequently justifies the horoscope. Our attention has for many years\r\nbeen fixed upon this point, and we can affirm that the greater part\r\nof the offspring of these connections are weak, torpid, lymphatic, if\r\nnot scrofulous, and do not promise a long career.\"\r\n\r\nIn old age the seminal fluid becomes greatly deteriorated. Even at the\r\nbest, its component elements could only represent decrepitude and\r\ninfirmity, degeneration and senility. In view of such facts, says Dr.\r\nActon,--\r\n\r\n\"We are, therefore, forced to the conclusion that the children of old\r\nmen have an inferior chance of life; and facts daily observed confirm\r\nour deductions. Look but at the progeny of such marriages; what is its\r\nvalue? As far as I have seen, it is the worst kind--spoilt childhood,\r\nfeeble and precocious youth, extravagant manhood, early and premature\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nUnions of an opposite character to those just considered, wherein a\r\nyoung man marries a woman much older than himself, are more rare than\r\nthose of the other class. They are, perhaps, less deplorable in their\r\nphysical effects, but still highly reprehensible. They are seldom\r\nprompted by pure motives, and can be productive of no good. Children\r\nresulting from such unions are notably weak, unbalanced, and sorry\r\nspecimens of humanity.\r\n\r\nWe have scarcely referred to the domestic misery which may result from\r\nthese disgraceful unions. If a young girl is brought home by a widower\r\nto preside over his grown-up daughters, perhaps old enough to be her\r\nmother, all the elements are provided for such a domestic hell as could\r\nonly be equaled by circumstances precisely similar. If children are\r\nborn, neither father nor mother is fit to act the part of a parent to\r\nthem. The father, by reason of his age, is fitful, uncertain, and\r\nchildish; to-day too lenient, to-morrow too exacting. The mother is\r\npettish, childish, indulgent, impatient, and as unskilled in\r\ngovernment as unfit for motherhood. In the midst of all this misrule,\r\nthe child grows up undisciplined, uncultivated, unsubdued; a misery\r\nto his parents, a disgrace to his friends, a dishonor to himself.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do with him? and what will he do with me?\" was the question\r\nasked by a girl of eighteen whose parents were urging her to marry an\r\nold man; and every young woman would do well to propound it under similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWere we disposed to define more specifically the conditions necessary\r\nto secure the most harmonious matrimonial unions, it would be useless\r\nto do so; for unions of this sort never have been, and never will\r\nbe--with rare exceptions--formed in accordance with a prescribed\r\nmethod independent of any emotional bias. Nor is it probable that such\r\na plan would result in remedying, in any appreciable degree, existing\r\nevils. It is a fact too patent to be ignored that a very large share\r\nof the unhappiness in the world arises from ill-mated marriages; but\r\nit is also true that nearly the whole of this unhappiness might be\r\naverted if the parties themselves would endeavor to lessen the\r\ndifferences between them by mutual approximation.\r\n\r\nCourtship.--We cannot well avoid devoting a few paragraphs to a part\r\nof the subject so important as this, especially as it affords an\r\nopportunity for pointing out some evils too patent and too perilous\r\nto be ignored.\r\n\r\nCourting, in the sense in which we use the word, is distinctly an\r\nAmerican custom. The social laws of other civilized countries are such\r\nas to preclude the possibility of the almost unrestrained association\r\nof the sexes in youth which we see in this country. We do not offer\r\nthis fact as an argument in favor of foreign social customs, by any\r\nmeans, although in this one particular they often present great\r\nadvantages, since in the majority of instances other evils as great\r\nor even greater are encouraged. We mention the fact simply for the\r\npurpose of bringing into bold relief the evils of the characteristic\r\nAmerican looseness in this particular.\r\n\r\nA French matron would be horrified at the idea of a young man asking\r\nher daughter to accompany him alone on an evening ride, to a lecture,\r\nconcert, or other place of amusement, and much more should he ask the\r\nprivilege of sitting up all night in the parlor with the light turned\r\ndown, after the rest of the family had retired. Among respectable people\r\nin France such liberties are not tolerated; and a young man who should\r\npropose such things would be dismissed from the house instantly, and\r\nwould be regarded as unfit for association with virtuous people. If\r\na young man calls upon a young lady for the purpose of making her\r\nacquaintance, he sees both her and her mother, or an aunt or older sister.\r\nHe never sees her alone. If he invites her to ride, or to accompany\r\nhim to an entertainment of any sort, he must always invite her lady\r\nfriend also; she goes along at any rate. There is afforded no chance\r\nfor solitary moonlight strolls or rides, nor any other of the similar\r\nopportunities made so common by American courting customs. We are no\r\nadvocates of the formal modes of contracting matrimonial alliances\r\ncommon among many nations, and illustrations of which we find at all\r\nages of the world. For example, among the ancient Assyrians it was a\r\ncustom to sell wives to the highest bidder, at auction, the sums\r\nreceived for the handsomer one being given to the less favored ones\r\nas a dowry, to secure a husband for every woman. The same custom\r\nprevailed in Babylon in ancient times, and has been practiced in modern\r\ntimes in Russia. At St. Petersburg, not many years ago, an annual sale\r\nof wives was held on Whit Sunday, after the same plan followed by the\r\nAssyrians.\r\n\r\nAmong the early Jews it seems to have been the custom for parents to\r\nselect wives for their sons. In the case of Isaac, this important matter\r\nwas intrusted to an old and experienced servant, who was undoubtedly\r\nconsidered much more competent to select a wife for the young man than\r\nhe was himself. The same custom has been handed down even to the present\r\ntime among some oriental nations. In many cases the parties are not\r\nallowed to see each other until after the wedding ceremony is completed.\r\nThe Hungarians often betroth their children while they are yet in their\r\ncradles, as did the Mexicans and Brazilians of the last century. In\r\nsome countries it has even been customary to betroth girls\r\nconditionally before they were born. The primitive Moravians seem to\r\nhave adhered to the ancient Jewish custom in some degree, though making\r\nthe selection of a wife a matter of chance. The old people did all the\r\ncourting there was done, which was not much. When a young man desired\r\na wife, a helpmeet was selected for him by casting lots among the\r\nmarriageable young ladies of the community, and the young man was\r\nobliged to abide by the decision, it being supposed that Providence\r\ncontrolled the selection. We are not prepared to say that the young\r\nman ran any greater risk of getting an uncongenial or undesirable life\r\ncompanion by this mode of selection than by the more modern modes in\r\nvogue among us.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, we do not present these customs as illustrations\r\nof what might be considered a proper mode of conducting the preliminary\r\nsteps of matrimonial alliances. On the contrary, we unhesitatingly\r\npronounce them decidedly objectionable on moral grounds if not on\r\nothers, and we can readily see that such unions must have been in many\r\ncases exceedingly unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn various other countries, marriage customs quite the opposite from\r\nthose described have been in vogue. In Irving's \"Knickerbocker's\r\nHistory of New York,\" a somewhat humorous account is given of a custom\r\nwhich has prevailed in some parts of this country as well as others,\r\neven within the memory of persons living at the present day, and is,\r\nindeed, said to be not yet altogether obsolete in Finland. The author,\r\nin dwelling upon the social customs of the early Dutch settlers of New\r\nYork, describes \"a singular custom prevalent among them, commonly known\r\nby the name of _bundling_,--a superstitious rite observed by the young\r\npeople of both sexes, with which they usually terminated their\r\nfestivities, and which was kept up with religious strictness by the\r\nmore bigoted part of the community. This ceremony was likewise, in those\r\nprimitive times, considered as an indispensable preliminary to\r\nmatrimony, their courtships commencing where ours usually finish,--by\r\nwhich means they acquired that intimate acquaintance with each other's\r\ngood qualities before marriage, which has been pronounced by\r\nphilosophers the sure basis of a happy union. Thus early did this\r\ncunning and ingenious people display a shrewdness of making a bargain,\r\nwhich has ever since distinguished them.\"\r\n\r\n\"To this sagacious custom, therefore, do I chiefly attribute the\r\nunparalleled increase of the Yanokie or Yankee race; for it is a certain\r\nfact, well authenticated by court records and parish registers, that,\r\nwherever the practice of bundling prevailed, there was an amazing\r\nnumber of sturdy brats annually born into the State, without the license\r\nof the law, or the benefit of clergy.\"\r\n\r\nLong Courtships.--Chiefly for the reasons presented in the preceding\r\nparagraphs, we are opposed to long courtships and long engagements.\r\nThey are productive of no good, and are not infrequently the occasion\r\nof much evil. There may be circumstances which render a prolonged\r\nengagement necessary and advisable; but, in general, they are to be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, hasty marriages are still more to be deprecated,\r\nespecially when, as is too commonly the case, the probability is so\r\ngreat that passion is the actuating motive far more than true love.\r\nMarriage is a matter of most serious consequences, and deserving of\r\nthe most careful deliberation. Too often matrimony is entered upon\r\nwithout any more substantial assurance of happiness as the result than\r\nthe individual has of securing a valuable prize who buys a ticket in\r\na lottery scheme. In the majority of cases, young people learn more\r\nof each other's real character within six weeks after marriage than\r\nthey discovered during as many months of courting. To every young man\r\nand woman we say, Look well before you leap; consider well, carefully,\r\nand prayerfully. A leap in the dark is a fearful risk, and will be far\r\nmore likely to land you in a domestic purgatory than anywhere else.\r\nDo not be dazzled by a handsome face, an agreeable address, a brilliant\r\nor piquant manner. Choose, rather, modesty, simplicity, sincerity,\r\nmorality, qualities of heart and mind, rather than exterior\r\nembellishments.\r\n\r\n\"It is folly,\" suggests a friend, \"to give advice on these subjects,\r\nfor no one will follow advice on this point, no matter how sensible\r\nand reasonable he may be on all other subjects. The emotions carry the\r\nindividual away, and the reason loses control.\" This is all too true,\r\nin nearly all cases. We believe in affection. The emotions have their\r\npart to act. We have no sympathy with the theories of those who will\r\nhave all marriages made by rule. But reason must be allowed a voice\r\nin the matter; and although there may be a time when the overwhelming\r\nforce of the emotions may force the reason and judgment into the\r\nbackground, there has been a time previous when the judgment might have\r\nheld control. Let every young man and woman be most scrupulously careful\r\nhow he allows emotional excitement to gain the ascendency. When once\r\nreason is stifled, the individual is in a most precarious situation.\r\nIt is far better and easier to prevent the danger than to escape from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFlirtation.--We cannot find language sufficiently emphatic to express\r\nproper condemnation of one of the most popular forms of amusement\r\nindulged in at the present day in this country, under the guise of\r\ninnocent association of the sexes. By the majority of people,\r\nflirtation is looked upon as harmless, if not useful, as some even\r\nconsider, claiming that the experience gained by such associations is\r\nvaluable to young persons, by making them familiar with the customs\r\nof society and the ways of the world. We have not the slightest\r\nhesitation in pronouncing flirtation as pernicious in the extreme. It\r\nexerts a malign influence alike upon the mental, the moral, and the\r\nphysical constitution of those who indulge it. The young lady who has\r\nbecome infatuated with a passion for flirting, courting the society\r\nof young men simply for the pleasure derived from their attentions,\r\nis educating herself in a school which will totally unfit her for the\r\nenjoyment of domestic peace and happiness should she have all the\r\nconditions necessary for such enjoyment other than those which she\r\nherself must furnish. More than this, she is very likely laying the\r\nfoundation for lifelong disease by the dissipation, late hours, late\r\nsuppers, evening exposures, fashionable dressing, etc., the almost\r\ncertain accompaniments of the vice we are considering. She is surely\r\nsacrificing a life of real true happiness for the transient\r\nfascinations of unreal enjoyment, pernicious excitement.\r\n\r\nIt may be true, and undoubtedly is the case, that the greater share\r\nof the guilt of flirtation lies at the door of the female sex; but there\r\ndo exist such detestable creatures as male flirts. In general, the male\r\nflirt is a much less worthy character than the young lady who makes\r\na pastime of flirtation. He is something more than a flirt. In nine\r\ncases out of ten, he is a rake as well. His object in flirting is to\r\ngratify a mean propensity at the expense of those who are pure and\r\nunsophisticated. He is skilled in the arts of fascination and intrigue.\r\nSlowly he winds his coils about his victim, and before she is aware\r\nof his real character, she has lost her own.\r\n\r\nSuch wretches ought to be punished in a purgatory by themselves, made\r\nseven times hotter than for ordinary criminals. Society is full of these\r\nlecherous villains. They insinuate themselves into the drawing-rooms\r\nof the most respectable families; they are always on hand at social\r\ngatherings of every sort. They haunt the ball-room, the theater, and\r\nthe church, when they can forward their infamous plans by seeming to\r\nbe pious. Not infrequently they are well supplied with a stock of pious\r\ncant, which they employ on occasion to make an impression. They are\r\nthe sharks of society, and often seize in their voracious maws the\r\nfairest and brightest ornaments of a community. The male flirt is a\r\nmonster. Every man ought to despise him; and every woman ought to spurn\r\nhim as a loathsome social leper.\r\n\r\nYouthful Flirtations.--Flirting is not confined to young men and women.\r\nThe contagion extends to little boys and girls, whose heads ought to\r\nbe as empty of all thoughts of sexual relations as the vacuum of an\r\nair-pump of air. The intimate association of young boys and girls in\r\nour common schools, and, indeed, in the majority of educational\r\ninstitutions, gives abundant opportunity for the fostering of this kind\r\nof a spirit, so prejudicial to healthful mental and moral development.\r\nEvery educator who is alive to the objects and interests of his\r\nprofession knows too well the baneful influence of these premature and\r\npernicious tendencies. Many times has the teacher watched with a sad\r\nheart the withering of all his hopes for the intellectual progress of\r\na naturally gifted scholar by this blighting influence. The most\r\ndangerous period for boys and girls exposed to temptations of this sort\r\nis that just following puberty, or between the ages of twelve and\r\neighteen or twenty. This period, a prominent educator in one of our\r\nWestern States once denominated, not inappropriately, \"the agonizing\r\nperiod of human puppyhood.\" If this critical period is once safely\r\npassed, the individual is comparatively safe; but how many fail to pass\r\nthrough the ordeal unseared!\r\n\r\nThe most painful phase of this subject is the tacit--even, in many cases,\r\nactive--encouragement which too many parents give their children in\r\nthis very direction, seemingly in utter ignorance of the enormity of\r\nthe evil which they are winking at or fostering. Parents need\r\nenlightenment on this subject, and need to be aroused to the fact that\r\nit is one of the most momentous questions that can arise in the rearing\r\nand training of children.\r\n\r\nPolygamy.--One hundred years ago the discussion of the public propriety\r\nor impropriety of a plurality of wives would have been impossible.\r\nPolygamy had not obtained a foothold as an institution in any civilized\r\nland. Being well known as not uncommon among certain heathenish and\r\nbarbarous tribes, it was looked upon as a heathenish and debasing\r\ninstitution, the outgrowth of ignorance and gross sensuality, and a\r\nrelic of a sensual age. Now, this is no longer true. Even in this, the\r\nmost enlightened of all lands, where there are most ample facilities\r\nfor culture, for moral and mental development, polygamy holds up its\r\nhideous head in defiance of all the laws of God and man. It is true\r\nthat the perpetrators of this foul crime against humanity and Heaven\r\nhave been driven by the indignation of outraged decency to seek a\r\nlurking place in the far-off wilderness of the Western territories;\r\nyet the foul odors from this festering sore are daily becoming more\r\nand more putrescent, and in spite of the distance, are contaminating\r\nthe already not overstrict morals of the nation.\r\n\r\nNo better evidence of the blighting, searing effect of this gross social\r\ncrime could be found than the fact that not only is polygamy coming\r\nto be winked at as something not so very bad after all, but men from\r\nwhom we have a right to expect something better are coming forward in\r\nits defense.\r\n\r\nWe have just been perusing a work written for the express purpose of\r\njustifying and advocating polygamy, which was written by an evangelical\r\nclergyman. He was evidently not willing to own his work, however, since\r\nhis name is carefully excluded from the title-page, and his publisher\r\nput under an oath of secrecy. The arguments which he makes in favor\r\nof polygamy are chiefly the following:--\r\n\r\n1. That it is approved by the Bible.\r\n\r\n2. That a robust man requires more than one woman to satisfy his sexual\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n3. That there are more women than men; and since every woman has a right\r\nto have a husband, the only way all can be supplied is to allow several\r\nwomen, two or more, according to the capacity of the man, or as they\r\ncan agree, to form a marriage partnership with one man.\r\n\r\n4. That the great men of all ages have been polygamists in fact, if\r\nnot by open profession.\r\n\r\n5. That monogamy is a relic of the paganism of the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans, with whom it originated.\r\n\r\n6. That it is the only proper and effective cure for the \"social evil,\"\r\nand all its attendant vices and dire diseases.\r\n\r\nAs this work has had quite a circulation, bearing the imprint of a\r\nwell-known Boston publisher, and has not received any answer that we\r\nare aware of, we deem it worth while to give these arguments, which\r\nare very strongly presented, at least a brief passing notice. We will\r\nconsider them in the order in which we have stated them.\r\n\r\n1. We deny most emphatically the assertion that polygamy is either\r\ntaught or approved by the Bible. It was tolerated in a people who had\r\nlong been in the darkness of Egyptian bondage, but never approved.\r\nIndeed, the inspired writers have evidently taken pains to give\r\nnumerous examples of the evils growing out of that violation of the\r\nlaw of God and Nature.\r\n\r\n2. The second argument is based upon the asserted fact that man\r\nnaturally possesses stronger sexual demands than woman; that these\r\ndemands are imperative; and that it is not only impossible, but in the\r\nhighest degree injurious, to restrain them.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true as a fact affirmed by constant observation that men\r\nhave stronger passions than women, in general, and that many men demand\r\nof their wives a degree of sexual indulgence which is the cause of\r\nserious injury to them, and even impossible for them to grant without\r\ndoing themselves the greatest wrong, it is by no means proven either\r\nthat these demands are imperative, that they are natural, or that they\r\nare not injurious to the man as well as the woman, much less beneficial\r\nto either. On the contrary, there is as great a weight of evidence as\r\ncould be required that restraint, self-control, and moderation in the\r\nexercise of the sexual instinct is in the highest degree beneficial\r\nto man, as well as to woman, and necessary for his highest development.\r\n\r\n3. While it is true that there are a few more adult women than men,\r\nthe difference is not sufficiently great to require the introduction\r\nof polygamy as a remedy for enforced celibacy. At any rate this would\r\nbe unnecessary until all bachelors had been provided with wives, when\r\nthere would be found no necessity for further provision, since there\r\nare large numbers of women who are utterly unfit to marry, who would\r\nbe injured by so doing, and would only serve to degenerate the race,\r\nbesides making themselves more wretched than they already are.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a well-known fact that more males than females are born,\r\nthe preponderance of adult females being caused by a greater mortality\r\namong male children, together with the losses from accidents and war.\r\nBy a correct observance of the laws of health, together with the\r\nabolition of wars, the disparity in relative numbers of the sexes would\r\ndisappear. Indeed, it might happen that men would be in the\r\npreponderance.\r\n\r\nStill again, it is only in a few very populous and long-settled\r\ncommunities that there are more women than men, as in the States of\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, and a few others of the Eastern States,\r\nand a few countries of Europe. In all newly settled countries the\r\nreverse is true. The inquiry naturally arises, What shall be done under\r\nthese circumstances? Shall a woman be allowed more than one husband,\r\nas is actually the case in some countries? \"Oh! no;\" our polygamist\r\nreplies, \"A woman is not capable of loving more than one man, and is\r\nnot even able to satisfy the sexual demands of a single husband; so,\r\nof course, a plurality of husbands is out of the question. A man is\r\ncapable of loving any number of women, being differently constituted\r\nfrom a woman; and so the same rule does not apply.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer evidently confounds love with lust. He will grant unstinted\r\nreign to the lusts of man, but requires woman to be restrained, offering\r\nas an apology for such a manifest unfair and unphilosophical\r\ndiscrimination that \"man is differently constituted from a woman,\r\nsexually, requiring more active exercise of the sexual functions,\" a\r\nconclusion which could be warranted only by the selection, as a typical\r\nspecimen of the male part of humanity, of a man with an abnormal\r\ndevelopment of the animal propensities.\r\n\r\nA correct understanding and application of the laws of sexual hygiene\r\nwould effectually sweep away every vestige of argument based on this\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n4. In proof of the propriety of polygamy, as well as of its necessity,\r\nthe author referred to cites the well-known fact that Plato, Aristotle,\r\nBacon, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Burns, Byron, Augustus, Webster,\r\nand numerous others of the noted men of all ages have been incontinent\r\nmen. The fact that these men were guilty of crime does not in the least\r\ndegree detract from the enormity of the sin. It is equally true that\r\nmany great men have been addicted to intemperance and other crimes.\r\nAlexander was a Sodomite as well as a lecherous rake. Does this fact\r\nafford any proof that those crimes are virtues instead of vices? Such\r\nargument is hardly worthy of serious refutal, since it stultifies\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n5. The fact that monogamy was practiced among the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans is in no way derogatory of it as an institution. Even if it could\r\nbe shown that it originated with those nations, still this would in\r\nno way detract from its value or respectability. Do not we owe much\r\nto those grand old pagans who laid the foundation for nearly all the\r\nmodern sciences, and established better systems of political economy,\r\nand better schools for uniform culture of the whole individual, than\r\nany the world has seen since? But monogamy did not originate with the\r\nGreeks, neither was it invented by the Romans, nor by any other nation.\r\nIt originated with the great Originator of the human race. It is an\r\ninstitution which has come down to us, not from Greece or Rome, but\r\nfrom Paradise.\r\n\r\nIf it was so important that man should have more than one woman to supply\r\nhis sexual demands, why was the Creator so short-sighted as to make\r\nbut one Eve? It would have been as easy to remove two or three or half\r\na dozen ribs from Adam's side as one; and as the whole world had yet\r\nto be populated, a plurality of wives would certainly have accelerated\r\nthe process. Surely, if polygamy was ever required or excusable, it\r\nought to have been allowed at the start.\r\n\r\nAgain, when Noah went into the ark, taking with him an assortment of\r\nall species of animals, he took some kinds by pairs and some by sevens,\r\nfrom which we might suspect, at least, that he observed the laws of\r\nnature respecting polygamous and monogamous animals. But he took only\r\none wife for himself, and only one for each of his sons. Why not two\r\nor half a dozen instead? Polygamy would certainly have accelerated the\r\nrepopulation of the earth most wonderfully; but Noah was monogamous.\r\nTo say, in view of such facts, that monogamy originated with the\r\npaganism of ancient Greece and Rome, is blasphemy.\r\n\r\n6. The argument that polygamy will cure the \"social evil\" is exactly\r\nequivalent to the argument that the removal of all restraint from the\r\nsale and manufacture of intoxicating drinks, thus making them cheap\r\nand common, is the best remedy for intemperance. An equally good\r\nargument might be made for the cure of theft, murder, and every other\r\nvice and crime, by a similar plan. Such reasoning is the veriest\r\nsophistry. None but a biased mind could produce such flimsy arguments.\r\n\r\nBut we forbear. We have already given this subject more attention than\r\nit is worthy of, though we have failed to characterize the vice of\r\npolygamy as it deserves. We leave this for the reader.\r\n\r\nPolyandry.--Perhaps we should add a word or two respecting this custom,\r\nwhich seems to be a still greater outrage against nature than that of\r\npolygamy, being the possession of a plurality of husbands by one woman.\r\nThis practice is in vogue in several countries at the present time,\r\nbeing very common in Thibet, where it is not an unusual thing for a\r\nwoman in marrying the eldest of a family of brothers to include in the\r\ncontract all of the other brothers as well. Polyandry was also common\r\namong the ancient Medes. Indeed, the Medes practiced both polygamy and\r\npolyandry. A man was not considered respectable unless he had at least\r\nseven wives; neither were women considered worthy of general esteem\r\nunless they had as many as five husbands. In that country, the fact\r\nthat a woman was already married was in no degree a barrier to subsequent\r\nmarriages, even while the husband was living, and without the trouble\r\nof a divorce. Those who maintain the propriety of polygamy would do\r\nwell to consider the historic facts respecting the opposite practice.\r\nThere appear to be as good grounds for believing one to have a basis\r\nin the human constitution as the other.\r\n\r\nDivorce.--Another of the crying evils of the day, and one which menaces\r\nin a most alarming manner the most sacred interests of society, is the\r\nfacility with which divorces may be obtained. In some States the laws\r\nregulating divorce are so notoriously loose that scores and even\r\nhundreds of people visit the States referred to every year with no other\r\nobject than to obtain a dissolution of the bonds of matrimony. The\r\neffect of this looseness in the laws is to encourage hasty,\r\ninconsiderate marriages, and to make escape from an uncongenial partner\r\nso easy that the obligation to cultivate forbearance and to acquire\r\nmutual adaptation which may not at first exist, is wholly overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Bible rule for divorce, laid down by the Great Teacher, is little\r\nregarded in these degenerate days. He made adultery the only legitimate\r\ncause for divorce; yet we now see married people breaking asunder their\r\nsolemn marriage ties on the occurrence of the most trivial difficulties.\r\nIf a couple become tired of each other and desire a change, all they\r\nhave to do is to forward the fee to a New York or Chicago lawyer, and\r\nthey will receive back in a short time the legal papers duly signed,\r\ngranting them the desired annulment of their vows.\r\n\r\nAlthough countenanced by human laws, there can be no doubt that this\r\nshameless trifling with a divine institution is regarded by High Heaven\r\nas the vilest abomination. In no direction is there greater need of\r\nreformatory legislation than in this. The marriage contract should be\r\nrecognized in our laws as one which cannot be made and broken so lightly\r\nas it now is. It should be annulled only for the most serious offenses.\r\nThe contrary course now pursued so frequently is most detrimental to\r\nmorals. Our divorce laws virtually offer a premium for unchastity.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently we see among the advertisements in the newspapers\r\nnotices like the following: \"The undersigned is prepared to furnish\r\ndivorces to parties desiring the same at moderate rates, in short time,\r\nand without publicity. ---- ----.\"\r\n\r\nThe animus of these advertisements is fraud. The parties so engaged\r\nare the vilest scoundrels; and that they are allowed to continue to\r\nply their nefarious vocation is a foul blot upon the enlightened\r\ncivilization of a so-called Christian country. A publisher who will\r\ninsert such a notice in his journal, would advertise a brothel if he\r\ndared. While there is so much interest in the suppression of obscene\r\nliterature, we would suggest that the proper authorities should direct\r\ntheir attention to the suppression of unlawful divorces, and the proper\r\npunishment of the villains engaged in forwarding this nefarious\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nWho May not Marry.--Many writers devote much space in laying down rules\r\nwhich are to be implicitly followed by those seeking life partners.\r\nWe have attempted nothing of the sort, both from its impracticability,\r\nand from the fact that such rules are never followed; and if the attempt\r\nshould be made to follow the prescribed rules, we are not sure that\r\nmore good than harm would be the result. Hence, we shall content\r\nourselves with calling attention to a few facts of great importance\r\nrespecting the conditions which imperatively forbid marriage, and\r\nwhich cannot be violated without the certain entailment of great\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n_1. Persons suffering with serious disease of a character communicable\r\nto others by contagion or by hereditary transmission._\r\n\r\nMany people wonder why it is that diseases are so much more numerous\r\nand varied in modern times than in the earlier ages of the race. There\r\nhas been an evident increase within a few centuries. While there are,\r\nundoubtedly, numerous influencing causes, one which cannot be\r\noverlooked is the hereditary transmission of disease, which preserves\r\nthose disorders which already exist, and adds new ones which originate\r\nfrom new exciting causes. By this means, the human race is undoubtedly\r\nbeing weakened, human life shortened, and diseases multiplied. Compare\r\nthe average age of human beings of the present day, less than forty\r\nyears, with the longevity of the early members of the race, who lived\r\nmore than as many score of years. Some mighty deteriorating influence\r\nhas been at work; and we hazard nothing in the assertion that the\r\nmarriage of diseased persons and kindred violations of the laws of human\r\nhygiene have been not unimportant factors in producing this most\r\nappalling diminution in the length of human life.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases which are most certain to be transmitted are\r\npulmonary tuberculosis, or consumption, syphilis, cancer, leprosy,\r\nepilepsy, and some other nervous disorders, some forms of skin disease,\r\nand insanity. The list might be extended; but these are the more common.\r\nPersons suffering with these disorders have no right to marry, for at\r\nleast four reasons:--\r\n\r\n(1) It is a sin against the offspring of such unions, who have a right\r\nto be born well, but are forced to come into the world with weakly\r\nconstitutions, diseased frames, and the certainty of premature death.\r\nThe children of consumptive and syphilitic parents rarely survive\r\ninfancy. If they do, it is only to suffer later on, as they surely will,\r\nand, perhaps, to communicate the same destructive diseases to other\r\nhuman beings; but these diseases rarely extend beyond the third\r\ngeneration, the line becoming extinct. The most heart-rending\r\nspectacles we have ever met have been the children of parents suffering\r\nwith the diseases mentioned. Their appearance is characteristic; no\r\nphysician of experience can fail to detect the sins of a profligate\r\nparent in a syphilitic child. Every feature indicates the presence of\r\na blighting curse.\r\n\r\nThere are those who assert that a man who has suffered with disease\r\nof the character last mentioned may marry after the lapse of two or\r\nthree years from the disappearance of the active symptoms of the malady.\r\nSuch assertions we consider as most dangerous and pernicious. The\r\nindividuals who make them are well acquainted with the fact that of\r\nall diseases this is the most difficult to eradicate when once the\r\nsystem has become thoroughly infected by it. Not only three years but\r\nthirty years may elapse after active symptoms disappear, yet the\r\ndisease may break out again in a new and still more serious and\r\ncomplicated form. It may even lie entirely dormant or latent in the\r\nsystem of the parent during his lifetime, but break out in all its\r\nterrible destructiveness in his children. A man or woman who has once\r\nsuffered with this fell disease is contaminated for life; and it is\r\na crime for such an one to entail upon innocent, unoffending human\r\nbeings such a terrible legacy. Such a person has no right to marry;\r\nor if married, has no right to perpetuate the results of his sins in\r\noffspring. It is _never safe_ to say to a man who has once been infected\r\nthat he is cured. If a cure ever takes place, it is exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\n(2) It is a crime against the race. One of the primary objects of\r\nmarriage is reproduction. As members of the human race, it is the duty\r\nof parents to produce a high type of human beings, at least to do all\r\nin their power to produce healthy offspring. If they cannot do this,\r\nand are aware of the fact, they are guilty of abuse of the reproductive\r\nfunction in bringing sickly offspring into the world to suffer.\r\n\r\n(3) It is injurious to the contracting parties themselves. If a person\r\nhas a communicable disease, as syphilis, leprosy, and some bad forms\r\nof skin disease, the disease will certainly be communicated to the wife\r\nor husband, and so a double amount of suffering will be entailed. The\r\ndread disease, consumption, rightly called the scourge of civilization,\r\nis now well known to be communicable. A few years ago we were consulted\r\nby an old gentleman, a native of Canada, who was suffering with\r\npulmonary disease. We inquired respecting the history of the malady.\r\nSaid he, \"Doctor, it may seem strange, but I believe I _inherited_\r\nconsumption from my wife, who died of consumption a few years ago.\"\r\nExcepting the wrong use of the term inherit, we were not prepared to\r\ndispute the old gentleman's ideas respecting the origin of his disease.\r\nLiving in close association for years with his wife, who was slowly\r\ndying with disease of the lungs, it was quite possible for him to have\r\nreceived the disease from her. So many cases of this kind have been\r\nreported that it is now generally believed by medical men that\r\nconsumption is communicable from one person to another by the reception\r\ninto the system of the well person of the exhalations from the lungs\r\nof the person affected.\r\n\r\nAnother point worthy of mention here is the well-known fact that the\r\nintimate association of married people modifies even the physical form\r\nof both. Almost every one has noticed how much alike in appearance\r\nmarried people who have lived many years together come to be. This\r\nphysical change undoubtedly extends further than to the features only.\r\nThe whole constitution is modified.\r\n\r\nA remarkable illustration of this fact is found in the frequent\r\nobservation that the children of a woman by a second husband often\r\nresemble in appearance the first husband much more than their own father.\r\nIt has been observed that the children of negro women, even by husbands\r\nof pure negro blood, are much lighter in color than usual if she has\r\nhad a child by a white man previously.\r\n\r\nThe same fact is observed in lower animals. In England, some years ago,\r\na cross was effected between a male zebra and several young mares. Not\r\nonly the hybrid colts resulting from this union, but all the colts\r\nafterward foaled by the same mares, from other horses, were striped\r\nlike the zebra.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, it is evident that the system of the woman,\r\nat least, may be profoundly affected in a similar manner by\r\nconstitutional weaknesses, as well as by other individual\r\npeculiarities possessed by her husband.\r\n\r\nNo person suffering with a contagious or infectious disease has any\r\nright to communicate the same to another. Indeed, it is the moral duty\r\nof every person so affected to do all in his power for the protection\r\nof others from the same cause of suffering.\r\n\r\n_2. Persons having a marked hereditary tendency to disease must not\r\nmarry those having a similar tendency._\r\n\r\nEvery physician knows only too well the powerful influence of\r\nhereditary causes in determining the length of human life. Persons,\r\none or both of whose parents have died of consumption, are very likely\r\nto die of the same disease, and frequently at about the same age. The\r\nchildren of such parents are commonly feeble and puny, and die early\r\nif they survive infancy. When both parents possess the consumptive\r\ntendency, the chance for life in the offspring is very poor indeed.\r\nThe same may be said of those suffering with cancer, epilepsy, insanity,\r\netc. Persons with a strong tendency to any one of the diseases mentioned\r\nshould in no case marry. If there is but a slight morbid tendency,\r\nmarriage may be admissible, but only with a partner possessing robust\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n_3. Should cousins marry?_\r\n\r\nWriters have devoted a good deal of attention to this subject, and we\r\nhave been shown statistics, reports of imbecile asylums, etc., for the\r\npurpose of proving that the marriage of cousins results in the\r\nproduction of idiots, and other defectives; but the results of more\r\ncareful examinations of the subject invalidate the views heretofore\r\nheld, and it must be acknowledged that when both parties are healthy\r\nthere is no more liability of mental incompetency in the children of\r\ncousins, than in the offspring of persons more remotely related. It\r\nmust be added, however, that there are other reasons why the marriage\r\nof cousins is not to be generally recommended. Besides the fact that\r\nthe feeling existing between cousins is often only that which is felt\r\nby brothers and sisters for each other, there is the still more\r\nimportant fact that on account of the blood relation, unions of this\r\nkind are more apt than others to bring together persons having similar\r\nmorbid tendencies.\r\n\r\n_4. Persons having serious congenital deformities should not marry._\r\n\r\nThe reason for this rule is obvious. Persons suffering with serious\r\ncongenital defects, as natural blindness, deafness, deformity of the\r\nlimbs, or defective development of any part, will be more or less likely\r\nto transmit the same deformities or deficiencies to their children.\r\nThere are, of course, cases of natural blindness, as well as of\r\ndisability in other respects, to which this rule does not apply, the\r\nnatural process of development not being seriously defective. It has\r\neven been observed that there is a slight tendency to the reproduction\r\nin the offspring, of deformity which has been artificially produced\r\nin the parents, and has existed for a long time.\r\n\r\nMany ancient nations observed this rule. Infants born cripples were\r\nstrangled at birth or left to die. A Spartan king was once required\r\nby his people to pay a heavy fine for taking a wife who was inferior\r\nin size.\r\n\r\n_5. Criminals should not marry._\r\n\r\nIt has been satisfactorily shown by thorough and scientific\r\ninvestigation that criminals often receive their evil proclivities\r\nfrom their parents. What are known as the criminal classes, which are\r\nresponsible for the greater part of the crime committed, are constantly\r\nand greatly on the increase. There is no doubt but that inheritance\r\nis largely responsible for the continued increase of crime and\r\ncriminals. A drunkard begets in his child a thirst for liquor, which\r\nis augmented by the mother's use of ale or lager during gestation and\r\nnursing, and the child enters the world with a natural taste for\r\nintoxicants. A thief transmits to his offspring a secretive, dishonest,\r\nsneaking disposition; and the child comes into the world ticketed for\r\nthe State prison by the nearest route. So with other evil tendencies.\r\nBy legislation or by some other means, measures should be speedily\r\nadopted for the prevention of this rapid increase of criminals, if there\r\nis any feasible plan which can be adopted. We offer no suggestion on\r\nthis point, but it is one well worthy of the consideration of\r\nphilanthropic statesmen.\r\n\r\n_6. Persons who are greatly disproportionate in size should not marry._\r\n\r\nWhile good taste would suggest the propriety of this rule, there are\r\nimportant physiological reasons for its observance. While the lack of\r\nphysical adaptitude may be the occasion of much suffering and\r\nunhappiness in such unions, especially on the part of the wife, being\r\neven productive of most serious local disease, and sometimes of\r\nsterility, it is in childbirth that the greatest risk and suffering\r\nis incurred. More might be said on this point, but this is sufficient\r\nfor those who are willing to profit by a useful hint.\r\n\r\n_7. Persons between whom there is great disparity of age should not\r\nmarry._\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this have already been given at length, and we will\r\nnot repeat. In general, the husband should be older than the wife, from\r\ntwo to five years. The husband may often be ten or twelve years the\r\nsenior of the wife; but when more than that, the union is not likely\r\nto be a profitable or happy one, if it is not absolutely productive\r\nof suffering and unhappiness. The ancient Greeks required that the\r\nhusband should be twenty years older than the wife; but this custom\r\nwas no more reasonable than that of another nation which required that\r\nonly old and young should marry, so that the sobriety of the old might\r\nrestrain the frivolity of the young.\r\n\r\n_8. Persons who are extremely unlike in temperament should not marry._\r\n\r\nPersons who are so unlike in temperament and tastes as to have no mutual\r\nenjoyments, no congeniality of feeling, will be incompatible as husband\r\nand wife, and the union of such persons will be anything but felicitous.\r\nNo definite rule can be laid down; but those seeking a companion for\r\nlife would do well to bear this caution in mind, at the same time\r\nremembering that too great similarity of character, especially when\r\nthere are prominent defects, is equally undesirable.\r\n\r\n_9. Marriage between widely different races is unadvisable._\r\n\r\nWhile there is no moral precept directly involved in marriage between\r\nwidely different nations, as between whites and blacks or Indians,\r\nexperience shows that such marriages are not only not conducive to\r\nhappiness, but are detrimental to the offspring. It has been proven\r\nbeyond room for question that mulattoes are not so long-lived as either\r\nblacks or whites.\r\n\r\n_10. Persons who are unable to sustain themselves or a family should\r\nnot marry._\r\n\r\nBoth moral and social obligations--if the two obligations may exist\r\nindependently--forbid marriage to a young man who is scarcely able to\r\nprovide for himself, much less to support a wife and a family. The theory\r\nadvocated by some that two can live almost as cheaply as one, so that\r\na saving will be made by a union of two in marriage, is a most fallacious\r\none. There may be occasional exceptions, but in general, young people\r\nwho marry with this idea in their heads find that they have reasoned\r\nnot wisely. It will not be disputed that a married couple may live upon\r\nwhat is often spent foolishly by a young man; but a young man can be\r\neconomical if he will; and if he does not learn economy before marriage,\r\nit is likely that he never will learn it.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of paupers, to beget pauper children and foist them upon\r\nthe community for support, is an outrage against society. We believe\r\nit is not improper to speak out plainly upon this subject, and in no\r\nuncertain tone, notwithstanding the popular prejudice which cries,\r\n\"Hush, be quiet; don't interfere with individual rights, don't disturb\r\nthe peace of society,\" whenever anything is said which has a bearing\r\non a regard for propriety in matters relating to one of the most ancient,\r\nthe most sacred, and the most abused of all divinely appointed human\r\ninstitutions. We have never been able to account for this strange\r\naverseness to the consideration of this phase of the matrimonial\r\nquestion, and the determined effort often made to ignore it whenever\r\nit is broached. We purpose to speak out, notwithstanding the feeling\r\nreferred to, since we believe this to be a crying evil; and we have\r\nno fears but that we shall have the hearty indorsement of every\r\nindividual who can so far lay aside his prejudices as to allow his native\r\ncommon sense a fair chance to influence his judgment.\r\n\r\nIn the country of Iceland, a land which is scarcely more than\r\nsemi-civilized, if a young man wishes to marry, the first thing to be\r\nconsidered is his pecuniary situation. Before he can take to himself\r\na wife, he must appear before the proper authority and present evidence\r\nthat he is able to support a wife and family in addition to providing\r\nfor himself. Even the barbarous natives of Patagonia show an equal\r\ndegree of good sense, the chief of each tribe requiring that every young\r\nman who wishes to marry shall first prove himself competent to provide\r\nfor a family, having attained the requisite degree of proficiency in\r\nhunting and fishing, and having possessed himself of at least two horses\r\nand the necessary equipments.\r\n\r\nIn this country,--a civilized, so-called Christian country, blessed\r\nwith all the enlightenment of the nineteenth century, what do we see?\r\nInstead of any regulation of the sort, the utmost indifference to such\r\nclearly important considerations. If young people profess to love each\r\nother and wish to marry, no one of their friends thinks of asking, \"How\r\nare they going to live after they are married? Has the young man a trade?\r\nHas the young lady been so educated as to be self-sustaining if\r\nnecessary? Has the young man a home or the wherewithal to obtain one?\r\nHas he a good situation, with prospects of being able to support his\r\nwife comfortably and provide for a family?\" These, or similar questions\r\nare sometimes asked, but little respect is paid to them by any one,\r\nleast of all by the young people themselves, who ought to be most\r\ninterested. The minister never inquires respecting the propriety of\r\nthe wedding at which he is to officiate, and invokes the blessings of\r\nHeaven upon a union which, for aught he knows, may be the grossest\r\nviolation of immutable laws, Heaven-implanted in the constitution of\r\nthe human race. The friends tender their congratulations and wishes\r\nof \"much joy,\" when in three cases out of four the conditions are such\r\nthat a preponderance of grief is an inevitable certainty, and \"much\r\njoy\" an utter impossibility.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions to all general rules; but it is a fact of which\r\nalmost any one may convince himself that a man or a woman seldom rises\r\nmuch higher than the level reached at marriage. If a young man has no\r\ntrade then, it is more than probable that he will never be master of\r\none. If he has not fitted himself for a profession, he will most likely\r\nnever attain to such a rank in society. He will, in all probability,\r\nbe a common laborer, living \"from hand to mouth,\" with nothing laid\r\nby for a rainy day.\r\n\r\nA wag says that a young couple just married, and for the first time\r\nawakened to the full consciousness of the fact that they must provide\r\nfor themselves or starve, held the following dialogue: Husband. \"Well,\r\nwife, what are we going to do? How shall we live?\" Wife. \"Oh, my dear,\r\nwe shall get along very well, I am sure; you love me, don't you?\" H.\r\n\"Certainly, dear, but we cannot live on love.\" W. \"We can live on bread\r\nand water; so long as we have each other, it doesn't matter much what\r\nwe have to eat.\" \"That's so, my dear; well, you furnish the bread, and\r\nI will skirmish around after the water.\" This exact dialogue may never\r\nhave taken place; but the circumstances which might have called it out\r\nhave occurred thousands of times. How many times has a dependent woman\r\nwho had hastily married an improvident husband awakened at the end of\r\na short honeymoon to find that she had only a limber stick or a broken\r\nreed to lean upon, instead of a self-reliant, independent,\r\nself-sustaining man, able to provide for her the comforts of a home\r\nand to protect her from the rudeness and suffering of privation and\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nIn our estimation it is as much a sin for a man to assume the obligation\r\nof caring for a wife and family when he has no reasonable grounds for\r\nbelieving himself able to do so, as for a man to go in debt a few hundreds\r\nor thousands of dollars, and agree to pay the same when required, though\r\nperfectly well aware that he will probably be unable to do so. Hence\r\nwe say again, with emphasis, the improvident should not marry; and we\r\nshall insist upon urging this truth, notwithstanding the fact that the\r\nvery class of persons referred to are usually of all classes the most\r\nanxious to enter the matrimonial state at the earliest possible moment,\r\nand the most certain to bring into the world large families of children\r\nstill more improvident than themselves.\r\n\r\n_11. Do not marry a person whose moral character will not bear the\r\nclosest scrutiny._\r\n\r\nBy this we do not mean that absolute perfection should be required,\r\nas this would interdict marriage altogether; but we wish to warn every\r\nyoung man against marrying a young woman who treats lightly or\r\ncontemptuously matters which should be treated with profound respect;\r\nwho uses the name of Deity flippantly or rudely; who treats her parents\r\ndisrespectfully; who never cares to talk of subjects of a spiritual\r\nnature; who is giddy, gay, dressy, thoughtless, fickle. Such a young\r\nwoman will never make a loving, patient, faithful, helpful wife.\r\n\r\nWe wish also to warn every young woman against choosing for a husband\r\na man who has a strong leaning toward infidelity; who does not believe\r\nin human responsibility; who makes a mock of religion; who is addicted\r\nto profanity; who is either grossly intemperate or given to moderate\r\ntippling, be it ever so little, so long as he does not believe in and\r\npractice total abstinence; who uses tobacco; who is a jockey, a fop,\r\na loafer, a scheming dreamer, or a speculator; who is known to be\r\nunchaste, or who has led a licentious life.\r\n\r\nThe man who has no love for his Maker will be likely to have little\r\nfor his wife and children. He who does not acknowledge his\r\nresponsibility to a higher power will soon forget his obligations to\r\nthe wife he has promised to love and cherish. The man who is not willing\r\nto sacrifice the gratification afforded by such pernicious habits as\r\ndram-drinking and tobacco-using to insure the comfort and happiness\r\nof his wife and children, is too selfish to make any woman a kind\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThere is no greater error abroad than that held by not a few that \"a\r\nreformed rake makes the best husband.\" The man whose affections have\r\nbeen consumed in the fires of unhallowed lust is incapable of giving\r\nto a pure-minded woman the love that she expects and deserves. A person\r\ncannot pass through the fire unscathed. The scars burned into the\r\ncharacter by the flames of concupiscence are as deep and lasting as\r\nthose inflicted upon the body, and even more so. Only \"in the\r\nregeneration\" will the marks and scars of the reformed reprobate be\r\nwholly effaced.\r\n\r\nWe willingly grant that there have been numerous instances in which\r\nnoble women have by years of patient effort reformed their erring\r\nhusbands, restoring them to the paths of virtue and sobriety from which\r\nthey had wandered. We do not deny that it can be done again; but we\r\ndo not hesitate to say that the experiment is a most perilous one for\r\nany woman to undertake, and one which not more than one woman in a\r\nhundred can bring to a successful termination. The hazard is terrible.\r\nPerhaps it is on this very account that many young women run the risk;\r\nbut they rarely understand what they are doing. The woman who marries\r\na drunkard will, ten chances to one, die a heart-broken drunkard's wife,\r\nor follow her husband to a drunkard's grave. It is never safe for a\r\nwoman to marry a man who has been for years an habitual drunkard, since\r\nhe may relapse at any time; and the man who has only indulged moderately\r\nshould be thoroughly reformed and tested before the chances are taken\r\n\"for better or worse.\" Let him prove himself well first. A proposition\r\nto reform on condition of marriage should be dismissed with disdain.\r\nIf a young man will not determine to do right because it is right, his\r\nmotives are sordid; and the probability is very great that so soon as\r\nsome stronger incentive appeals to his selfishness, he will forget his\r\nvows and promises and relapse into his former vices.\r\n\r\nDo Not Be in a Hurry.--In conclusion, perhaps we could give no more\r\nimportant advice than this: _Do not be in a hurry to marry._ There is\r\nlittle danger that this advice will do harm, for ten illustrations of\r\nthe evil results of hasty marriage are seen to one in which the opposite\r\nmistake is made. It rarely happens that a marriage made without\r\nconsideration and due deliberation on the part of both parties is a\r\nhappy one in its results. There are exceptional cases in which this\r\nkind of matrimonial alliances result very satisfactorily; but these\r\ncases are quite exceptional. The business of selecting a partner for\r\nlife, one who is expected to sustain the closest relation possible\r\nbetween human beings, who must be prepared to share in another's sorrows\r\nas well as joys, to sympathize with another's aspirations and\r\nappreciate another's motives and sentiments,--such a task is certainly\r\none of the most serious of an individual's life and ought to be entered\r\nupon with calmness, deliberation, and unbiased judgment and entire\r\nself-control. When making a decision which must affect seriously an\r\nindividual's whole life-time, passion, caprice, and all motives\r\ncalculated to bias the judgment, should be laid aside. The happiness\r\nand usefulness of a whole life-time may be marred by a word. There is\r\ntoo much pending to be in a hurry.\r\n\r\nA certain philosopher once \"compared a man about to marry to one who\r\nwas about to put his hand into a sack in which were ninety-nine serpents\r\nand one eel; the moral of which is that there are ninety-nine chances\r\nto one against a fortunate selection.\" If this is true of a man about\r\nto marry, it is probably equally true that a woman under the same\r\ncircumstances has nine hundred and ninety-nine chances against, for\r\none in favor of, a fortunate selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHASTITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\" \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust\r\nafter her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\"\r\n\r\nIn these two scriptures we have a complete definition of unchastity.\r\nThe seventh commandment, with the Saviour's commentary upon it, places\r\nclearly before us the fact that chastity requires purity of thought\r\nas well as of outward acts. Impure thoughts and unchaste acts are alike\r\nviolations of the seventh commandment. As we shall see, also,\r\nunchastity of the mind is a violation of natural law as well as of moral\r\nlaw, and is visited with physical punishment commensurate to the\r\ntransgression.\r\n\r\nMental Unchastity.--It is vain for a man to suppose himself chaste who\r\nallows his imagination to run riot amid scenes of amorous associations.\r\nThe man whose lips delight in tales of licentiousness, whose eyes feast\r\nupon obscene pictures, who is ever ready to pervert the meaning of a\r\nharmless word or act into uncleanness, who finds delight in reading\r\nvivid portrayals of acts of lewdness,--such a one is not a virtuous\r\nman. Though he may never have committed an overt act of unchastity,\r\nif he cannot pass a handsome female in the street without, in\r\nimagination, approaching the secrets of her person, he is but one grade\r\nabove the open libertine, and is as truly unchaste as the veriest\r\ndebauchee.\r\n\r\nMan may not see these mental adulteries, he may not perceive these\r\nfilthy imaginings; but One sees and notes them. They leave their hideous\r\nscars upon the soul. They soil and mar the mind; and as the record of\r\neach day of life is photographed upon the books in Heaven, they each\r\nappear in bold relief, in all their innate hideousness.\r\n\r\nO purity! how rare a virtue! How rare to find a face which shows no\r\ntrace of sensuality! One turns with sadness from the thought that human\r\n\"forms divine\" have sunk so low. The standard of virtue is trailing\r\nin the dust. Men laugh at vice, and sneer at purity. The bawdy laugh,\r\nthe ribald jest, the sensual glance, the obscene song, the filthy tale,\r\nsalute the eyes and ears at every street corner, in the horse-car, on\r\nthe railroad train, in the bar-room, the lecture hall, the workshop.\r\nIn short, the works and signs of vice are omnipresent.\r\n\r\nFoul thoughts, once allowed to enter the mind, stick like the leprosy.\r\nThey corrode, contaminate, and infect like the pestilence; naught but\r\nAlmighty power can deliver from the bondage of concupiscence a soul\r\nonce infected by this foul blight, this moral contagium.\r\n\r\nMental Uncleanness.--It is a wide-spread and deadly error, that only\r\noutward acts are harmful; that only physical transgression of the laws\r\nof chastity will produce disease. We have seen all the effects of\r\nbeastly abuse result from mental sin alone.\r\n\r\n\"I have traced serious affections and very great suffering to this cause.\r\nThe cases may occur at any period of life. We meet with them frequently\r\namong such as are usually called, or think themselves, continent young\r\nmen. There are large classes of persons who seem to think that they\r\nmay, without moral guilt, excite their own feelings or those of others\r\nby loose or libidinous conversation in society, provided such impure\r\nthoughts or acts are not followed by masturbation or fornication. I\r\nhave almost daily to tell such persons that physically, and in a\r\nsanitary point of view, they are ruining their constitutions. There\r\nare young men who almost pass their lives in making carnal acquaintances\r\nin the street, but just stop short of seducing girls; there are others\r\nwho haunt the lower classes of places of public amusement for the\r\npurpose of sexual excitement, and live, in fact, a thoroughly immoral\r\nlife in all respects except actually going home with prostitutes. When\r\nthese men come to me, laboring under the various forms of impotence,\r\nthey are surprised at my suggesting to them the possibility of the\r\nimpairment of their powers being dependent upon these previous vicious\r\nhabits.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Acton.]\r\n\r\n\"Those lascivious _day-dreams_ and amorous reveries, in which young\r\npeople--and especially the idle and the voluptuous, and the sedentary\r\nand the nervous--are exceedingly apt to indulge, are often the sources\r\nof general debility, effeminacy, disordered functions, premature\r\ndisease, and even premature death, without the actual exercise of the\r\ngenital organs! Indeed, this unchastity of thought--this adultery of\r\nthe mind--is the beginning of immeasurable evil to the human\r\nfamily.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Graham.]\r\n\r\nAmativeness.--Certain phrenologists contend that the controlling\r\ncenter of the sexual passion is the cerebellum, or little brain, which\r\nis situated at the lower and back part of the head. They apparently\r\nlove to dwell upon the theme, and ride their hobby upon all possible\r\noccasions, often in the most disgusting manner, and always leaving the\r\nimpression that they must be themselves suffering from perversion of\r\nthe very function of which they speak.\r\n\r\nThere may be some doubt whether the function called amativeness is\r\nlocated in the cerebellum at all; at least, it is perfectly certain\r\nthat amativeness is not the exclusive function of the cerebellum. Says\r\nCarpenter, the learned physiologist, \"The seat of the sexual sensation\r\nis no longer supposed to be in the cerebellum generally; but probably\r\nin its central portion, or some part of the medulla oblongata.\"\r\n\r\nThe cerebellum is intimately connected with the principal vital organs;\r\nhence, if it is largely developed, the individual will possess a\r\nwell-developed physical organism and a good degree of constitutional\r\nvigor. He will have vigorous health, and probably strong sexual powers;\r\nnot, however, as a special function, but for the same reason that he\r\nwill have a good digestion.\r\n\r\nTo the majority of mankind, apparently, amativeness, or sexual love,\r\nmeans lust. The faculty has been lowered and debased until it might\r\nalmost be considered practically synonymous with sensuality. The first\r\nstep toward reform must be a recognition of a higher and purer relation\r\nthan that which centers every thought upon the gratification of the\r\nanimal in human nature. If one may judge from the facts which now and\r\nthen come to the surface in society, it would appear that the\r\nopportunity for sensual gratification had come to be, in the world at\r\nlarge, the chief attraction between the sexes. If to these observations\r\nwe add the filthy disclosures constantly made in police courts and\r\nscandal suits, we have a powerful confirmation of the opinion. Even\r\nministers, who ought to be \"ensamples to the flock,\" are rather \"blind\r\nleaders of the blind,\" and fall into the same ditch with the rest.\r\n\r\nThis perversion of a natural instinct, and these sudden lapses from\r\nvirtue which startle a small portion of community and afford a filthy\r\nkind of pleasure to the other part, are but the outgrowths of mental\r\nunchastity. \"Filthy dreamers,\" before they are aware, become filthy\r\nin action. The thoughts mold the brain, as certainly as the brain molds\r\nthe thoughts. Rapidly down the current of sensuality is swept the\r\nindividual who yields his imagination to the contemplation of\r\nlascivious themes. Before he knows his danger, he finds himself deep\r\nin the mire of concupiscence. He may preserve a fair exterior; but\r\ndeception cannot cleanse the slime from his putrid soul. How many a\r\nchurch-member carries under a garb of piety a soul filled with\r\nabominations, no human scrutiny can tell. How many pulpits are filled\r\nby \"whited sepulchers,\" only the Judgment will disclose.\r\n\r\nUnchaste Conversation.--\"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth\r\nspeaketh.\" \"Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give\r\naccount thereof in the day of Judgment.\" \"By thy words thou shalt be\r\ncondemned.\" Matt. 12: 34, 36, 37. In these three brief sentences, Christ\r\npresents the whole moral aspect of the subject of this paragraph. To\r\nany one who will ponder well his weighty words, no further remark is\r\nnecessary. Let filthy talkers but consider for a moment what a multitude\r\nof \"idle,\" unclean words are waiting for account in the final day; and\r\nthen let them consider what a load of condemnation must roll upon their\r\nguilty souls when strict justice is meted out to every one before the\r\nbar of Omnipotence, and in the face of all the world--of all the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal habit among boys and young men of relating filthy\r\nstories, indulging in foul jokes, making indecent allusions, and\r\nsubjecting to lewd criticism every passing female, is a most abominable\r\nsin. Such habits crush out pure thoughts; they annihilate respect for\r\nvirtue; they make the mind a quagmire of obscenity; they lead to overt\r\nacts of lewdness.\r\n\r\nBut boys and youths are not alone in this. More often than otherwise,\r\nthey gain from older ones the phraseology of vice. And if the sin is\r\nloathsome in such youthful transgressors, what detestable enormity\r\nmust characterize it in the old.\r\n\r\nAnd women, too, are not without their share in this accursed thing,\r\nthis ghost of vice, which haunts the sewing-circle and the parlor as\r\nwell as the club-room. They do not, of course, often descend to those\r\nblack depths of vulgarity to which the coarser sex will go, but couch\r\nin finer terms the same foul thoughts, and hide in loose insinuations\r\nmore smut than words could well express. Women who think themselves\r\nrare paragons of virtue can find no greater pleasure than in the\r\ndiscussion of the latest scandal, speculations about the chastity of\r\nMrs. A. or Mr. B., and gossip about the \"fall\" of this man's daughter\r\nor the amorous adventures of that woman's son.\r\n\r\nMasculine purity loves to regard woman as chaste in mind as well as\r\nin body, to surround her with conceptions of purity and impregnable\r\nvirtue; but the conclusion is irresistible that those who can gloat\r\nover others' lapses from virtue, and find delight in such questionable\r\nentertainments as the most recent case of seduction, or the newest\r\nscandal, have need to purify their hearts and re-enforce their waning\r\nchastity. Nevertheless, a writer says, and perhaps truly, that \"the\r\nwomen comprise about all the real virtue there is in the world.\"\r\nCertainly if they were one-half as bad as the masculine portion of\r\nhumanity, the world would be vastly worse than it is.\r\n\r\nCauses of Unchastity.--Travelers among the North American Indians have\r\nbeen struck with the almost entire absence of that abandonment to vice\r\nwhich might be expected in a race uninfluenced by the moral restraints\r\nof Christianity. When first discovered in their native wilds, they were\r\nfree from both the vices and the consequent diseases of civilization.\r\nThis fact points unmistakably to the conclusion that there must be\r\nsomething in the refinements and perversions of civilized life which\r\nis unfavorable to chastity, notwithstanding all the restraints which\r\nreligion and the conventionalisms of society impose. Can we find such\r\ninfluences? Yes; they abound on every hand and leave their blight in\r\nmost unwelcome places, oft unsuspected, even, till the work of ruin\r\nis complete.\r\n\r\nEarly Causes.--The earliest of all causes is hereditary predisposition.\r\nAs we have shown, a child conceived in lust can no more be chaste by\r\nnature than a negro can be a Caucasian. But back of this there is a\r\ndeeper cause, as we shall see, one that affects parents as well as\r\noffspring. Between infancy and puberty, are in operation, all those\r\ninfluences mentioned under \"Sexual Precocity.\"\r\n\r\nThe frequent custom of allowing children of the opposite sex to sleep\r\ntogether, even until eight or ten years of age, or longer, is a dangerous\r\none. We have known of instances in which little boys of seven or eight\r\nhave been allowed to sleep with girls of fourteen or sixteen, in some\r\nof which most shameful lessons were taught, and by persons who would\r\nnot be suspected of such an impropriety. In one instance a little boy\r\nof eight, occupying the same bed with three girls several years older,\r\nwas used for illustration by the older girl in instructing the younger\r\nones in the _modus operandi_ of reproduction. The sexes should be\r\ncarefully separated from each other at least as early as four or five\r\nyears of age, under all circumstances which could afford opportunity\r\nfor observing the physical differences of the sexes, or in any way serve\r\nto excite those passions which at this tender age should be wholly\r\ndormant.\r\n\r\nDiet vs. Chastity.--From earliest infancy to impotent old age, under\r\nthe perverting influence of civilization, there is a constant\r\nantagonism between diet and purity. Sometimes--rarely we hope--the\r\nhelpless infant imbibes the essence of libidinous desires with its\r\nmother's milk, and thence receives upon its forming brain the stamp\r\nof vice. When old enough to take food in the ordinary way, the infant's\r\ntender organs of digestion are plied with highly seasoned viands,\r\nstimulating sauces, animal food, sweetmeats, and dainty tidbits in\r\nendless variety. Soon, tea and coffee are added to the list. Salt,\r\npepper, ginger, mustard, condiments of every sort, deteriorate his\r\ndaily food. If, perchance, he does not die at once of indigestion, or\r\nwith his weakened forces fall a speedy victim to the diseases incident\r\nto infancy, he has his digestive organs impaired for life at the very\r\noutset of his existence.\r\n\r\nExciting stimulants and condiments weaken and irritate his nerves and\r\nderange the circulation. Thus, indirectly, they affect the sexual\r\nsystem, which suffers through sympathy with the other organs. But a\r\nmore direct injury is done. Flesh, condiments, eggs, tea, coffee,\r\nchocolate, and all stimulants, have a powerful influence directly upon\r\nthe reproductive organs. They increase the local supply of blood; and\r\nthrough nervous sympathy with the brain, the passions are aroused.\r\n\r\nOvereating, eating between meals, hasty eating, eating indigestible\r\narticles of food, late suppers, react upon the sexual organs with the\r\nutmost certainty. Any disturbance of the digestive function\r\ndeteriorates the quality of the blood. Poor blood, filled with crude,\r\npoorly digested food, is irritating to the nervous system, and\r\nespecially to those extremely delicate nerves which govern the\r\nreproductive function. Irritation provokes congestion; congestion\r\nexcites sexual desires; excited passions increase the local\r\ndisturbance; and thus each reacts upon the other, ever increasing the\r\ninjury and the liability to future damage.\r\n\r\nThus, these exciting causes continue their insidious work through youth\r\nand more mature years. Right under the eyes of fathers and mothers they\r\nwork the ruin of their children, exciting such storms of passion as\r\nare absolutely uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nClerical Lapses.--Our most profound disgust is justly excited when we\r\nhear of laxity of morals in a clergyman. We naturally feel that one\r\nwhose calling is to teach his fellow-men the way of truth, and right,\r\nand purity, should himself be free from taint of immorality. But when\r\nwe consider how these ministers are fed, we cannot suppress a momentary\r\ndisposition to excuse, in some degree, their fault. When the minister\r\ngoes out to tea, he is served with the richest cake, the choicest jellies,\r\nthe most pungent sauces, and the finest of fine-flour bread-stuffs.\r\nLittle does the indulgent hostess dream that she is ministering to the\r\ninflammation of passions which may imperil the virtue of her daughter,\r\nor even her own. Salacity once aroused, even in a minister, allows no\r\nroom for reason or for conscience. If women wish to preserve the virtue\r\nof their ministers, let them feed them more in accordance with the laws\r\nof health. Ministers are not immaculate.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for the dangers to chastity arising from this source, is\r\npointed out in the article on \"Continence.\"\r\n\r\nTobacco and Vice.--Few are aware of the influence upon morals exerted\r\nby that filthy habit, tobacco-using. When acquired early, it excites\r\nthe undeveloped organs, arouses the passions, and in a few years\r\nconverts the once chaste and pure youth into a veritable volcano of\r\nlust, belching out from its inner fires of passion torrents of obscenity\r\nand the sulphurous fumes of lasciviousness. If long-continued, the\r\nfinal effect of tobacco is emasculation; but this is only the necessary\r\nconsequence of previous super-excitation. The lecherous day-dreams in\r\nwhich many smokers indulge, are a species of fornication for which even\r\na brute ought to blush, if such a crime were possible for a brute. The\r\nmental libertine does not confine himself to bagnios and women of the\r\ntown. In the foulness of his imagination, he invades the sanctity of\r\nvirtue wherever his erotic fancy leads him.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that we have made a grave charge against tobacco, and we\r\nhave not hesitated to state the naked truth; yet we do not think we\r\nhave exaggerated, in the least, the pernicious influence of this foul\r\ndrug. As much, or nearly as much, might be said against the use of liquor,\r\non the same grounds.\r\n\r\nBad Books.--Another potent enemy of virtue is the obscene literature\r\nwhich has flooded the land for many years. Circulated by secret agencies,\r\nthese books have found their way into the most secluded districts.\r\nNearly every large school contains one of these emissaries of evil men\r\nand their Satanic master. Some idea of the enormity and extent of this\r\nevil may be gained from the following quotations from a published letter\r\nof Mr. Anthony Comstock, who has been for some time employed by the\r\nYoung Men's Christian Association in suppressing the traffic by\r\narresting the publishers and destroying their goods:--\r\n\r\n\"I have succeeded in unearthing this hydra-headed monster in part, as\r\nyou will see by the following statement, which, in many respects, might\r\nbe truthfully increased in quantity. These I have seized and\r\ndestroyed:--\r\n\r\n\"Obscene photographs, stereoscopic and other pictures, more than one\r\nhundred and eighty-two thousand; obscene books and pamphlets, more than\r\nfive tons; obscene letter-press in sheets, more than two tons; sheets\r\nof impure songs, catalogues, handbills, etc., more than twenty-one\r\nthousand; obscene microscopic watch and knife charms, and finger-rings,\r\nmore than five thousand; obscene negative plates for printing\r\nphotographs and stereoscopic views, about six hundred and twenty-five;\r\nobscene engraved steel and copper plates, three hundred and fifty;\r\nobscene lithographic stones destroyed, twenty; obscene wood-cut\r\nengravings, more than five hundred; stereotype plates for printing\r\nobscene books, more than five tons; obscene transparent playing-cards,\r\nnearly six thousand; obscene and immoral rubber articles, over thirty\r\nthousand; lead molds for manufacturing rubber goods, twelve sets, or\r\nmore than seven hundred pounds; newspapers seized, about four thousand\r\nsix hundred; letters from all parts of the country ordering these goods,\r\nabout fifteen thousand; names of dealers in account-books seized, about\r\nsix thousand; lists of names in the hands of dealers, that are sold\r\nas merchandise to forward circulars or catalogues to, independent of\r\nletters and account-books seized, more than seven thousand; arrest of\r\ndealers since Oct. 9, 1871, more than fifty.\"\r\n\r\n\"These abominations are disseminated by these men first obtaining the\r\nnames and addresses of scholars and students in our schools and colleges,\r\nand then forwarding circulars. They secure thousands of names in this\r\nway, either by sending for a catalogue of schools, seminaries, and\r\ncolleges, under a pretense of sending a child to attend these places,\r\nor else by sending out a circular purporting to be getting up a directory\r\nof all the scholars and students in schools and colleges in the United\r\nStates, or of taking the census of all the unmarried people, and\r\noffering to pay five cents per name for lists so sent. I need not say\r\nthat the money is seldom or never sent, but I do say that these names,\r\ntogether with those that come in reply to advertisements, are sold to\r\nother parties; so that when a man desires to engage in this nefarious\r\nbusiness, he has only to purchase a list of these names, and then your\r\nchild, be it son or daughter, is liable to have thrust into its hands,\r\nall unknown to you, one of these devilish catalogues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since the destruction of the stereotype plates of old books, secret\r\ncirculars have been discovered of a notice to dealers that twelve new\r\nbooks are in course of preparation, and will soon be ready for\r\ndelivery.\"\r\n\r\nSays Hon. C. L. Merriam, as quoted by Dr. Lewis: \"We find that the\r\ndealers in obscene literature have organized circulating libraries,\r\nwhich are under the charge of the most vicious boys in the schools,\r\nboys chosen and paid by the venders, and who circulate among the\r\nstudents, at ten cents a volume, any of the one hundred and forty-four\r\nobscene books heretofore published in New York City.\"\r\n\r\nLargely through the influence of Mr. Comstock, laws have been enacted\r\nwhich promise to do much toward checking this extensive evil, or at\r\nleast causing it to make itself less prominent. Our newspapers still\r\nabound with advertisements of various so-called medical works,\r\n\"Marriage Guides,\" etc., which are fruits of the same \"upas-tree\" that\r\nMr. Comstock has labored so faithfully to uproot.\r\n\r\nIt is a painful fact, however, that the total annihilation of every\r\nfoul book which the law can reach will not effect the cure of this evil,\r\nfor our modern literature is full of the same virus. It is necessarily\r\npresented in less grossly revolting forms, half concealed by beautiful\r\nimagery, or embellished by wit; but yet, there it is, and no law can\r\nreach it. The works of our standard authors in literature abound in\r\nlubricity. Popular novels have doubtless done more to arouse a prurient\r\ncuriosity in the young, and to excite and foster passion and immorality,\r\nthan even the obscene literature for the suppression of which such\r\nactive measures have recently been taken. The more exquisitely painted\r\nthe scenes of vice, the more dangerously enticing. Novel-reading has\r\nled thousands to lives of dissoluteness.\r\n\r\nIdleness.--This evil is usually combined with the preceding. To\r\nmaintain purity, the mind must be occupied. If left without occupation,\r\nthe vacuity is quickly filled with unchaste thoughts. Nothing can be\r\nworse for a child than to be reared in idleness. His morals will be\r\ncertain to suffer. Incessant mental occupation is the only safeguard\r\nagainst unchastity. Those worthless fops who spend their lives in\r\n\"killing time\" by lounging about bar-rooms, loafing on street corners,\r\nor strutting up and down the boulevard, are anything but chaste. Those\r\nequally worthless young women who waste their lives on sofas or in\r\neasy-chairs, occupied only with some silly novel, or idling away life's\r\nprecious hours in reverie--such creatures are seldom the models of\r\npurity one would wish to think them. If born with a natural propensity\r\ntoward sin, such a life would soon engender a diseased, impure\r\nimagination, if nothing worse.\r\n\r\nDress and Sensuality.--There are two ways in which fashionable dress\r\nleads to unchastity; viz., 1. By its extravagance; 2. By its abuse of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nHow does extravagance lead to unchastity? By creating the temptation\r\nto sin. It affects not those gorgeously attired ladies who ride in fine\r\ncarriages, and live in brown-stone fronts, who are surrounded with all\r\nthe luxuries that wealth can purchase--fine apparel is no temptation\r\nto such. But to less favored--though not less worthy--ones, these\r\nmagnificent displays of millinery goods and fine trappings are most\r\npowerful temptations. The poor seamstress, who can earn by diligent\r\ntoil hardly enough to pay her board bill, has no legitimate way by which\r\nto deck herself with the finery she admires. Plainly dressed as she\r\nmust be if she remains honest and retains her virtue, she is scornfully\r\nignored by her proud sisters. Everywhere she finds it a generally\r\nrecognized fact that \"dress makes the lady.\" On the street, no one steps\r\naside to let her pass, no one stoops to regain for her the package that\r\nslips from her weary hands. Does she enter a crowded car, no one offers\r\nher a seat, though she is trembling with fatigue, while the showily\r\ndressed woman who follows her is accommodated at once. She marks the\r\ndifference; she does not pause to count the cost, but barters away her\r\nself-respect, to gain the respect, or deference, of strangers.\r\n\r\nHow Young Women Fall.--It has been authoritatively stated that there\r\nare, in our large cities, hundreds of young women who, being able to\r\nearn barely enough to buy food and fuel and pay the rent of a dismal\r\nattic, take the advice offered by their employers, \"Get some gentleman\r\nfriend to dress you for your company.\" Others spend all their small\r\nearnings to keep themselves \"respectably\" dressed, and share the board\r\nand lodgings of some young _roue_ as heartless as incontinent. Persons\r\nunaccustomed to city life, and thousands of people in the very heart\r\nof our great metropolis, have no conception of the frightful prevalence\r\nof this kind of prostitution. Young women go to our large cities as\r\npure as snow. They find no lucrative employment. Daily contact with\r\nvice obtunds their first abhorrence of it. Gradually it becomes\r\nfamiliar. A fancied life of ease presents allurements to a hard-worked\r\nsewing-girl. Fine clothes and comfortable lodgings increase the\r\ntemptation. She yields, and barters her body for a home without the\r\ntrouble of a marriage ceremony.\r\n\r\nWealthy women could do more to cure the \"social evil\" by adopting plain\r\nattire than all the civil authorities by passing license laws or\r\nregulating ordinances. Have not Christian women a duty here? A few years\r\nago, some Nashville ladies made a slight move in the right direction,\r\nas indicated in the following paragraph; but we have not heard that\r\ntheir example has been followed:--\r\n\r\n\"The lady members of the first Baptist Church, of Nashville, Tenn.,\r\nhave agreed that they will dispense with all finery on Sunday, wearing\r\nno jewels but consistency, and hereafter appear at church in plain\r\ncalico dresses.\"\r\n\r\nA more radical reform would have been an extension of the salutary\r\nmeasure to all other days of the week as well as Sunday; though we see\r\nno reason for restricting the material of clothing to calico, which\r\nmight, indeed, be rather insufficient for some seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nFashion and Vice.--Let us glance at the second manner in which dress\r\nlends its influence to vice, by obstructing the normal functions of\r\nthe body. 1. Fashion requires a woman to compress her waist with bands\r\nor corsets. In consequence, the circulation of the blood toward the\r\nheart is obstructed. The venous blood is crowded back into the delicate\r\norgans of generation. Congestion ensues, and with it, through reflex\r\naction, the unnatural excitement of the animal propensities. 2. The\r\nmanner of wearing the clothing, suspending several heavy garments from\r\nthe hips, increases the same difficulty by bringing too large a share\r\nof clothing where it is least needed, thus generating unnatural local\r\nheat. 3. The custom of clothing the feet and limbs so thinly that they\r\nare exposed to constant chilling, by still further unbalancing the\r\ncirculation, adds another element to increase the local mischief.\r\n\r\nAll of these causes combined, operating almost constantly,--with\r\nothers that might be mentioned,--produce permanent local congestions,\r\nwith ovarian and uterine derangements. The latter affections have long\r\nbeen recognized as the chief pathological condition in hysteria, and\r\nespecially in that peculiar form of disease known as _nymphomania_,\r\nunder the excitement of which a young woman, naturally chaste and modest,\r\nmay be impelled to the commission of the most wanton acts. The\r\npernicious influence of fashionable dress in occasioning this disorder\r\ncannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nReform in Dress Needed.--The remedy for these evils, the only way to\r\nescape them, is reformation. The dress must be so adjusted to the body\r\nthat every organ will be allowed free movement. No corset, band, belt,\r\nor other means of constriction, should impede the circulation. Garments\r\nshould be suspended from the shoulders by means of a waist, or proper\r\nsuspenders. The limbs should be as warmly clad as any other portion\r\nof the body. How best to secure these requirements of health may be\r\nlearned from several excellent works on dress reform, any of which can\r\nbe readily obtained of the publishers of this work or their agents.\r\n\r\nFashionable Dissipation.--The influence of so important an agent for\r\nevil in this direction as fashionable dissipation, cannot be ignored.\r\nBy fashionable dissipation we mean that class of excesses in the\r\nindulgence in which certain classes, usually the more wealthy or\r\naristocratic, pride themselves. Among this class of persons a man who\r\nis known to be a common drunkard would not be recognized; such a person\r\nwould be carefully shunned; yet a total abstainer would be avoided with\r\nalmost equal care, and would be regarded as a fanatic or an extremist\r\nat least. With persons of this class, wine-drinking is considered\r\nnecessary as a matter of propriety. Along with wine are taken the great\r\nvariety of highly seasoned foods, spices, and condiments in profusion,\r\nwith rich meats and all sorts of delicacies, rich desserts, etc., which\r\ncan hardly be considered much less harmful than stimulants of a more\r\ngenerally recognized character.\r\n\r\nThese indulgences excite that part of the system which generally needs\r\nrestraint rather than stimulation. A participant, an ex-governor,\r\nrecently described to us a grand political dinner given in honor of\r\na noted American citizen, which began at 5 P.M., and continued until\r\nnearly midnight, continuous courses of foods, wines, etc., being served\r\nfor nearly six hours. Similar scenes have been enacted in a score of\r\nour large cities for the same ostensible purpose. Knowing that public\r\nmen are addicted to such gormandizing on numerous occasions, we do not\r\nwonder that so many of them are men of loose morals.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of luxury is toward demoralization. Rome never became\r\ndissipated and corrupt until her citizens became wealthy, and adopted\r\nluxurious modes of living. Nothing is much more conducive to sound\r\nmorals than full occupation of the mind with useful labor. Fashionable\r\nidleness is a foe to virtue. The young man or the young woman who wastes\r\nthe precious hours of life in listless dreaming, or in that sort of\r\nsenseless twaddle which forms the bulk of the conversation in some\r\ncircles, is in very great danger of demoralization. Many of the usages\r\nand customs of fashionable society seem to open the door to vice, and\r\nto insidiously, and at first unconsciously, lead the young and\r\ninexperienced away from the paths of purity and virtue. There is good\r\nevidence that the amount of immorality among what are known as the\r\nhigher classes is every year increasing. Every now and then a scandal\r\nin high life comes to the surface; but the great mass of corruption\r\nis effectually hidden from the general public. Open profligacy is of\r\ncourse frowned upon in all respectable circles; and yet wealth and\r\naccomplishments will cover a multitude of sins.\r\n\r\nThis freedom allowed to the vile and vicious is one of the worst features\r\nof fashionable society. Such persons carry about them a moral\r\natmosphere more deadly than the dreaded upas-tree.\r\n\r\nRound Dances.--Whatever apologies may be offered for other forms of\r\nthe dance as means of exercise under certain restrictions, employed\r\nas a form of calisthenics, no such excuse can be framed in defense of\r\n\"round dances,\" especially of the waltz. In addition to the associated\r\ndissipation, late hours, fashionable dressing, midnight feasting,\r\nexposures through excessive exertions and improper dress, etc., it can\r\nbe shown most clearly that dancing has a direct influence in stimulating\r\nthe passions and provoking unchaste desires, which too often lead to\r\nunchaste acts, and are in themselves violations of the requirements\r\nof strict morality, and productive of injury to both mind and body.\r\n\r\nSaid the renowned Petrarch, \"The dance is the spur of lust--a circle\r\nof which the devil himself is the center. Many women that use it have\r\ncome dishonest home, most indifferent, none better.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot do better than to quote on this subject from a little work\r\nentitled, \"The Dance of Death,\" the author of which has given a great\r\namount of attention to this subject, and presents its evils in a very\r\nforcible light, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"A score of forms whirl swiftly before us under the softened gaslight.\r\nI say a score of _forms_--but each is double--they would have made two\r\nscore before the dancing began. Twenty floating visions--each male and\r\nfemale. Twenty women, knit and growing to as many men, undulate, sway,\r\nand swirl giddily before us, keeping time with the delirious melody\r\nof piano, harp, and violin.\r\n\r\n\"But draw nearer--let us see how this miracle is accomplished. Do you\r\nmark yonder couple who seem to excel the rest in grace and ardor. Let\r\nus take this couple for a sample. He is stalwart, agile, mighty; she\r\nis tall, supple, lithe, and how beautiful in form and feature! Her head\r\nrests upon his shoulder, her face is upturned to his; her naked arm\r\nis almost around his neck; her swelling breast heaves tumultuously\r\nagainst his; face to face they whirl, his limbs interwoven with her\r\nlimbs; with strong right arm about her yielding waist, he presses her\r\nto him till every curve in the contour of her lovely body thrills with\r\nthe amorous contact. Her eyes look into his, but she sees nothing; the\r\nsoft music fills the room, but she hears nothing; swiftly he whirls\r\nher from the floor or bends her frail body to and fro in his embrace.\r\n\r\n\"With a last, low wail the music ceases. Her swooning senses come back\r\nto life. Ah, must it be! Yes; her companion releases her from his embrace.\r\nLeaning wearily upon his arm, the rapture faded from her eye, the flush\r\ndying from her cheek--enervated, limp, listless, worn out--she is led\r\nto a seat, there to recover from her delirium and gather her energies\r\nas best she may in the space of five minutes, after which she must yield\r\nher body to a new embrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now tell me, friend of mine, did you not recognize an old\r\nacquaintance in the lady we have been watching so closely? No! Then\r\nbelieve me; she is no other than the 'pure and lovely girl' you so much\r\nadmired earlier in the evening, the so desirable wife, the angel who\r\nwas to 'haunt your dreams.'\"\r\n\r\nThe author just quoted publishes in his little work a letter from a\r\nwoman of great ability and strength of mind, of unblemished character\r\nand national reputation, written in response to his request for her\r\nopinion of the dance. The statements made in this remarkable letter\r\nare so clear and convincing that every parent ought to read it. We quote\r\nthe chief portions as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"'I will venture to lay bare a young girl's heart and mind by giving\r\nyou my own experience in the days when I waltzed.\r\n\r\n\"'In those times I cared little for Polka or Varsovienne, and still\r\nless for the old-fashioned \"Money Musk\" or \"Virginia Reel,\" and\r\nwondered what people could find to admire in those \"slow dances.\" But\r\nin the soft floating of the waltz I found a strange pleasure, rather\r\ndifficult to intelligibly describe. The mere anticipation fluttered\r\nmy pulse, and when my partner approached to claim my promised hand for\r\nthe dance, I felt my cheeks glow a little sometimes, and I could not\r\nlook him in the eyes with the same frank gayety as heretofore.\r\n\r\n\"'But the climax of my confusion was reached when, folded in his warm\r\nembrace, and giddy with the whirl, a strange, sweet thrill would shake\r\nme from head to foot, leaving me weak and almost powerless, and really\r\nalmost obliged to depend for support upon the arm which encircled me.\r\nIf my partner failed from ignorance, lack of skill, or innocence, to\r\narouse these, to me, most pleasurable sensations, I did not dance with\r\nhim the second time.\r\n\r\n\"'I am speaking openly and frankly, and when I say that I did not\r\nunderstand what I felt, or what were the real and greatest pleasures\r\nI derived from this so-called dancing, I expect to be believed. But\r\nif my cheeks grew red with uncomprehended pleasure then, they grow pale\r\nwith shame to-day when I think of it all. It was the physical emotions\r\nengendered by the contact of strong men that I was enamored of--not\r\nof the dance, nor even of the men themselves.\r\n\r\n\"'Thus I became abnormally developed in my lowest nature. I grew bolder,\r\nand from being able to return shy glances at first, was soon able to\r\nmeet more daring ones, until the waltz became to me and whomsoever\r\ndanced with me, one lingering, sweet, and purely sensual pleasure,\r\nwhere heart beat against heart, hand was held in hand, and eyes looked\r\nburning words which lips dared not speak.\r\n\r\n\"'All this while no one said to me, You do wrong; so I dreamed of sweet\r\nwords whispered during the dance, and often felt while alone a thrill\r\nof joy indescribable yet overpowering when my mind would turn from my\r\nstudies to remember a piece of temerity of unusual grandeur on the part\r\nof one or another of my cavaliers.\r\n\r\n\"'Girls talk to each other. I was still a school girl, although mixing\r\nso much with the world. We talked together. We read romances that fed\r\nour romantic passions on seasoned food, and none but ourselves knew\r\nwhat subjects we discussed. Had our parents heard us, they would have\r\nconsidered us on the high road to ruin.\r\n\r\n\"'Yet we had been taught that it was right to dance; our parents did\r\nit, our friends did, and we were permitted. I will say also that all\r\nthe girls with whom I associated, with the exception of one, had much\r\nthe same experience in dancing; felt the same strangely sweet emotions,\r\nand felt that almost imperative necessity for a closer communion than\r\nthat which even the freedom of a waltz permits, without knowing exactly\r\nwhy, or even comprehending what.\r\n\r\n\"'Married now, with home and children around me, I can at least thank\r\nGod for the experience which will assuredly be the means of preventing\r\nmy little daughters from indulging in any such dangerous pleasure. But,\r\nif a young girl, pure and innocent in the beginning, can be brought\r\nto feel what I have confessed to have felt, what must be the experience\r\nof a married woman? _She_ knows what every glance of the eye, every\r\nbend of the head, every close clasp means, and knowing that,\r\nreciprocates it, and is led by swifter steps and a surer path down the\r\ndangerous, dishonorable road.\r\n\r\n\"'I doubt if my experience will be of much service, but it is the candid\r\ntruth, from a woman who, in the cause of all the young girls who may\r\nbe contaminated, desires to show just to what extent a young mind may\r\nbe defiled by the injurious effects of round dances. I have not\r\nhesitated to lay bare what are a young girl's most secret thoughts,\r\nin the hope that people will stop and consider, at least, before handing\r\ntheir lilies of purity over to the arms of any one who may choose to\r\nblow the frosty breath of dishonor on their petals.'\"\r\n\r\nMuch more might be added on this important subject, would the limits\r\nof this work allow; but this must suffice. We beg the reader to consider\r\ncarefully and prayerfully the facts presented before deciding that\r\ndancing is so harmless as many persons suppose.\r\n\r\nPhysical Causes of Unchastity.--Some of the physical causes of impurity\r\nin women have been previously referred to, since it is through physical\r\ninjuries that unhealthful clothing exerts its influence. Too little\r\nis generally known of the intimate connection between physical and\r\nmental conditions. Doubtless, many vices originate in physical\r\nimperfections. Indeed, when the full bearing of physical influences\r\nupon the mind is allowed, it is difficult to avoid pleading extenuating\r\ncircumstances in the cases of the greatest share of transgressors of\r\nboth moral and civil laws. This principle is especially applicable to\r\nsexual relations.\r\n\r\nIn males, one of the most general physical causes of sexual excitement\r\nis _constipation_. The vesicula seminalis, in which the seminal fluid\r\nis stored, is situated, as will be remembered, at the base of the bladder.\r\nIt thus has the bladder in front, and the rectum behind. In constipation,\r\nthe rectum becomes distended with feces, effete matter which should\r\nhave been promptly evacuated instead of being allowed to accumulate.\r\nThis hardened mass presses upon the parts most intimately concerned\r\nin the sexual act, causing excessive local excitement. When this\r\ncondition is chronic, as in habitual constipation, the unnatural\r\nexcitement often leads to most serious results. One of these is the\r\nproduction of a horrible disease, _satyriasis_, the nature of which\r\nhas been previously indicated.\r\n\r\n_Constipation_ in females has the same tendency, though the dangers\r\nare not quite so great. The irritation is sufficient, however, to lead\r\nto excitement of the passions.\r\n\r\n_Intestinal worms_ often produce the same result in children.\r\n\r\n_Local uncleanliness_ is another very frequent cause which is often\r\noverlooked. The natural local secretions quickly become a source of\r\ngreat irritation if not removed by daily washing. Certain anatomical\r\npeculiarities sometimes exist in the male which greatly aggravate this\r\ndifficulty, and for which circumcision, or an equivalent operation,\r\nis the remedy.\r\n\r\n_Irritation of the bladder_, producing incontinence of urine, is\r\nanother enemy to chastity. It should receive prompt attention and\r\ntreatment. In children, this irritability is indicated by wetting of\r\nthe bed at night. In cases of this kind, allow the child little drink\r\nin the latter portion of the day. See that the bladder is emptied just\r\nbefore he goes to bed. Wake him once or twice during the night, and\r\nhave him urinate. Use all possible means to remove the cause of\r\nirritation by giving him plenty of out-of-door exercise and a very\r\nsimple, though nutritious, diet. Avoid meat, eggs, and condiments.\r\n\r\nModern Modes of Life.--Aside from all of the causes already enumerated,\r\nthere are many other conditions and circumstances, the result of modern\r\nhabits of living, that tend directly toward the excitement of\r\nsensuality. Superheated rooms, sedentary employments, the development\r\nof the mental and nervous organizations at the expense of the muscular,\r\nthe cramming system in schools, too long confinement of school-children\r\nin a sitting position, the allowance of too great freedom between the\r\nsexes in the young, the demoralizing influence of most varieties of\r\npublic amusement, balls, church fairs, and other like influences too\r\nnumerous to mention, all tend in the one direction, that of abnormal\r\nexcitation and precocious development of the sexual functions.\r\n\r\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that for one conforming to modern modes\r\nof living, eating, sleeping, and drinking, absolute chastity is next\r\nto an absolute impossibility. This would certainly be true without a\r\nspecial interposition of Providence; but Providence never works\r\nmiracles to obviate the results of voluntary sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinence differs from chastity in being entire restraint from sexual\r\nindulgence under all circumstances, while chastity is only restraint\r\nfrom unlawful indulgence. As we have both physical and mental chastity,\r\nso continence should be both mental and physical. Many of the\r\nobservations on the subject of \"Chastity\" apply with equal force to\r\ncontinence. The causes of incontinence are the same as those of\r\nunchastity. The same relation also exists between mental and physical\r\ncontinence as between mental and physical chastity.\r\n\r\nThe subject of continence evidently has a somewhat wider scope than\r\nthat of chastity, as generally understood; but as we have considered\r\nthe latter subject so fully, we shall devote less space to this, leaving\r\nthe reader to make the application of such preceding remarks as reason\r\nmay suggest to him are equally appropriate here.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to consider the various circumstances under which\r\nabsolute continence is expedient, or desirable, or morally required,\r\nwe will proceed at once to examine the question, Is continence harmful?\r\n\r\nContinence not Injurious.--It has been claimed by many, even by\r\nphysicians,--and with considerable show of reason,--that absolute\r\ncontinence, after full development of the organs of reproduction, could\r\nnot be maintained without great detriment to health. It is needless\r\nto enumerate all the different arguments employed to support this\r\nposition, since they are, with a few exceptions, too frivolous to\r\ndeserve attention. We shall content ourselves chiefly with quotations\r\nfrom acknowledged authorities, by which we shall show that the popular\r\nnotions upon this subject are wholly erroneous. Their general\r\nacceptance has been due, without doubt, to the strong natural bias in\r\ntheir favor. It is an easy matter to believe what agrees well with one's\r\npredilections. A bare surmise, on the side of prejudice, is more telling\r\nthan the most powerful logic on the other side.\r\n\r\n\"We know that this opinion is held by men of the world, and that many\r\nphysicians share it. This belief appears to us to be erroneous, without\r\nfoundation, and easily refuted.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Mayer.]\r\n\r\nThe same writer claims \"that no peculiar disease nor any abridgment\r\nof the duration of life can be ascribed to such continence.\" He proves\r\nhis position by appealing to statistics, and shows the fallacy of\r\narguments in support of the contrary view. He further says:--\r\n\r\n\"It is determined, in our opinion, that the commerce of the sexes has\r\nno necessities that cannot be restrained without peril.\"\r\n\r\n\"A part has been assigned to _spermatic plethora_ in the etiology of\r\nvarious mental affections. Among others, priapism has been attributed\r\nto it. In our opinion, this malady originates in a disturbance of the\r\ncerebral nerve power; but it is due much less to the retention of sperm\r\nthan to its exaggerated loss; much less to virtuous abstinence than\r\nto moral depravity.\"\r\n\r\nThere has evidently been a wide-spread deception upon this subject.\r\n\"Health does not absolutely require that there should ever be an\r\nemission of semen, from puberty to death, though the individual live\r\na hundred years; and the frequency of involuntary nocturnal emissions\r\nis an indubitable proof that the parts, at least, are suffering under\r\na debility and morbid irritability utterly incompatible with the\r\ngeneral welfare of the system.\"\r\n\r\nDoes not Produce Impotence.--It has been declared that strict\r\ncontinence would result in impotency. The falsity of this argument is\r\nclearly shown by the following observations:--\r\n\r\n\"There exists no _greater error_ than this, nor one more opposed to\r\nphysiological truth. In the first place, I may state that I have, after\r\nmany years' experience, never seen a single instance of atrophy of the\r\ngenerative organs from this cause. I have, it is true, met the complaint,\r\nbut in what class of cases does it occur? It arises, in all instances,\r\nfrom the exactly opposite cause, abuse; the organs become worn out,\r\nand hence arises atrophy. Physiologically considered, it is not a fact\r\nthat the power of secreting semen is annihilated in well-formed adults\r\nleading a healthy life and yet remaining continent. No continent man\r\nneed be deterred by this apocryphal fear of atrophy of the testes, from\r\nliving a chaste life. It is a device of the unchaste--a lame excuse\r\nfor their own incontinence, unfounded on any physiological law.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Acton.]\r\n\r\nThe truth of this statement has been amply confirmed by experiments\r\nupon animals.\r\n\r\nThe complaint is made by those whose lives have been far otherwise than\r\ncontinent, that abstinence occasions suffering, from which indulgence\r\ngives relief. The same writer further says that when such a patient\r\nconsults a medical man, \"he should be told--and the result would soon\r\nprove the correctness of the advice--that attention to diet, gymnastic\r\nexercise, and self-control, will, most effectually relieve the\r\nsymptoms.\"\r\n\r\nDifficulty of Continence.--Some there are who urge that self-denial\r\nis difficult; that the natural promptings are imperious. From this they\r\nargue that it cannot but be right to gratify so strong a passion. \"The\r\nadmitted fact that continence, even at the very beginning of manhood,\r\nis frequently productive of distress, is often a struggle hard to be\r\nborne--still harder to be completely victorious in--is not to be at\r\nall regarded as an argument that it is an _evil_.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nBut if rigid continence is maintained from the first, the struggle with\r\nthe passions will not be nearly so severe as after they have once been\r\nallowed to gain the ascendency. On this point, the following remarks\r\nare very just:--\r\n\r\n\"At the outset, the sexual necessities are not so uncontrollable as\r\nis generally supposed, and they can be put down by the exercise of a\r\nlittle energetic will. There is, therefore, as it appears to us, as\r\nmuch injustice in accusing nature of disorders which are dependent upon\r\nthe genital senses, badly directed, as there would be in attributing\r\nto it a sprain or a fracture accidentally produced.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Mayer.]\r\n\r\nHelps to Continence.--As already indicated, and as every individual\r\nwith strong passions knows, the warfare with passion is a serious one\r\nif one determines to lead a continent life. He needs the help of every\r\naid that he can gain. Some of these may be named as follows:--\r\n\r\n_The Will_.--A firm determination must be formed to lead a life of\r\npurity; to quickly quench the first suggestions of impurity; to harbor\r\nno unchaste desire; to purge the mind of carnal thoughts; in short,\r\nto cleave fast to mental continence. Each triumph over vicious thoughts\r\nwill strengthen virtue; each victory won will make the next the easier.\r\nSo strong a habit of continence may be formed that this alone will be\r\na bulwark against vice.\r\n\r\n_Diet_.--He who would keep in subjection his animal nature must\r\ncarefully guard the portal to his stomach. The blood is made of what\r\nis eaten. Irritating food will produce irritating blood. Stimulating\r\nfoods or drinks will surely produce a corresponding quality of blood.\r\nIrritating, stimulating blood will irritate and stimulate the nervous\r\nsystem, and especially the delicate nerves of the reproductive system,\r\nas previously explained. Only the most simple and wholesome food should\r\nbe eaten, and that only in such moderate quantities as are required\r\nto replenish the tissues. The custom of making the food pungent and\r\nstimulating with condiments is the great, almost the sole, cause of\r\ngluttony. It is one of the greatest hindrances to virtue. Indeed, it\r\nmay with truth be said that the devices of modern cookery are most\r\npowerful allies of unchastity and licentiousness. This subject is\r\nparticularly deserving of careful, candid, and studious attention, and\r\nonly needs such investigation to demonstrate its soundness.\r\n\r\n_Exercise_.--Next to diet as an aid to continence, perhaps of equal\r\nimportance with it, is exercise, both physical and mental. It is a trite\r\nproverb, the truth of which every one acknowledges, that \"Satan finds\r\nsome mischief still for idle hands to do,\" and it is equally true that\r\nhe always has an evil thought in readiness--speaking figuratively--to\r\ninstill into an unoccupied mind. A person who desires to be pure and\r\ncontinent in body and mind must flee idleness as he would the devil\r\nhimself; for the latter is always ready to improve upon the advantages\r\nafforded by an idle moment, an hour given to reverie.\r\n\r\nWe have the strongest testimony from the most eminent physicians in\r\nregard to the efficacy of exercise in overcoming abnormal sexual\r\ndesires. Mr. Acton relates the following statement made to him by a\r\ngentleman who has become distinguished in his profession:--\r\n\r\n\"'You may be surprised, Mr. Acton,' said he, 'by the statement I am\r\nabout to make to you, that before my marriage I lived a perfectly\r\ncontinent life. During my university career, my passions were very\r\nstrong, sometimes almost uncontrollable, but I have the satisfaction\r\nto think that I mastered them; it was, however, by great efforts. I\r\nobliged myself to take violent physical exertion; I was the best oar\r\nof my year, and when I felt particularly strong sexual desire, I sallied\r\nout to take my exercise. I was victorious always, and I never committed\r\nfornication. You see in what vigorous health I am; it was exercise alone\r\nthat saved me.'\"\r\n\r\nSays Carpenter, on the same subject, in a textbook for medical students,\r\n\"'Try the effect of close mental application to some of those ennobling\r\npursuits to which your profession introduces you, in combination with\r\nvigorous bodily exercise, before you assert that the appetite is\r\nunrestrainable, and act upon that assertion.'\"\r\n\r\nWalking, riding, rowing, and gymnastics are among the best modes of\r\nphysical exercise for sedentary persons; but there is no better form\r\nof exercise than working in the garden. The cultivation of small fruits,\r\nflowers, and other occupations of like character, really excel all\r\nother modes of physical exercise for one who can engage in them with\r\nreal pleasure. Even though distasteful at first, they may become very\r\nattractive and interesting if there is an honest, persevering desire\r\nto make them so. The advantages of exercises of this kind are evident.\r\n1. They are useful as well as healthful. While they call into action\r\na very large number of muscles by the varied movements required, the\r\nexpenditure of vital force is remunerated by the actual value of the\r\nproducts of the labor; so that no force is wasted. 2. The tillage of\r\nthe soil and the dressing of vines and plants bring one in constant\r\ncontact with nature in a manner that is elevating and refining, or at\r\nleast affords the most favorable opportunities for the cultivation of\r\nnobility and purity of mind, and elevated principles.\r\n\r\nExercise carried to such excess as to produce exhaustion is always\r\ninjurious. The same is true of mental labor as of physical exercise.\r\nPlenty of sleep, and regular habits of retiring and rising, are\r\nimportant. Dozing is bad at any time; for it is a condition in which\r\nthe will is nearly dormant, though consciousness still lingers, and\r\nthe imagination is allowed to run wild, and often enough it will run\r\nwhere it ought not. Late study, or late hours spent in any manner, is\r\na sure means of producing general nervous irritability and sexual\r\nexcitement through reflex influence.\r\n\r\n_Bathing_.--A daily bath with cool or tepid water, followed by vigorous\r\nrubbing of the skin with a coarse towel and then with the dry hand,\r\nis a most valuable aid. The hour of first rising is generally the most\r\nconvenient time. How to take different kinds of baths is explained in\r\nother works devoted to the subject.[10] General and local cleanliness\r\nare indispensable to general and local health.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See \"Uses of Water\" and \"The Household Manual.\"]\r\n\r\n_Religion_.--After availing himself of all other aids to continence,\r\nif he wishes to maintain purity of mind as well as physical\r\nchastity--and one cannot exist long without the other--the individual\r\nmust seek that most powerful and helpful of all aids, divine grace.\r\nIf, in the conflict with his animal nature, man had only to contend\r\nwith the degrading influences of his own propensities, the battle would\r\nbe a serious one, and it is doubtful whether human nature alone--at\r\nleast in any but rare cases,--would be able to gain the victory; but,\r\nin addition to his own inherent tendencies to evil, man is assailed\r\nat every point by unseen agencies that seek to drag him down and spoil\r\nhis soul with lust. These fiendish influences are only felt, not seen,\r\nfrom which some argue that they do not exist. Such casuists must find\r\nenormous depths for human depravity. But who has not felt the cruel\r\npower of these unseen foes? Against them, there is but one safe,\r\nsuccessful weapon, \"the blood of Christ which cleanseth from all sin.\"\r\n\r\nThe struggling soul, beset with evil thoughts, will find in prayer a\r\nsalvation which all his force of will, and dieting, and exercising,\r\nwill not, alone, insure him. Yet prayer alone will not avail. Faith\r\nand works must always be associated. All that one can do to work out\r\nhis own salvation, he must do; then he can safely trust in God to do\r\nthe rest, even though the struggle seems almost a useless one; for when\r\nthe soul has been long in bondage to concupiscence, the mind a hold\r\nof foul and lustful thoughts, a panorama of unchaste imagery, these\r\nhateful phantoms will even intrude themselves upon the sanctity of\r\nprayer and make their victim mentally unchaste upon his knees. But\r\nChrist can pity even such; and even these degraded minds may yet be\r\npure if with the psalmist they continue to cry, with a true purpose\r\nand unwavering trust, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew\r\na right spirit within me.\" \"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;\r\nwash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first suggestion of an evil thought, send up a mental prayer\r\nto Him whose ear is always open. Prayer and impurity are as incompatible\r\nas oil and water. The pure thoughts that sincere prayer will bring,\r\ndisplace the evil promptings of excited passion. But the desire for\r\naid must be sincere. Prayer will be of no avail while the mind is half\r\nconsenting to the evil thought. The evil must be loathed, spurned,\r\ndetested.\r\n\r\nIt would seem almost unnecessary to suggest the impropriety of\r\nresorting to prayer alone when sexual excitability has arisen from a\r\nculpable neglect to remove the physical conditions of local excitement\r\nby the means already mentioned. Such physical causes must be well looked\r\nafter, or every attempt to reform will be fruitless. God requires of\r\nevery individual to do for himself all that he is capable of doing;\r\nto employ every available means for alleviating his sufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARITAL EXCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a generally prevalent opinion that the marriage ceremony\r\nremoves all restraint from the exercise of the sexual functions. Few\r\nseem to even suspect that the seventh commandment has any bearing upon\r\nsexual conduct within the pale of matrimony. Yet if we may believe the\r\nconfessions and statements of men and women, legalized prostitution\r\nis a more common crime than illicit commerce of the sexes. So common\r\nis the popular error upon this subject, and so strongly fortified by\r\nprejudice is it, that it is absolutely dangerous for a writer or speaker\r\nto express the truth, if he knows it and has a disposition to do so.\r\nAny attempt to call attention to true principles is mocked at, decried,\r\nstigmatized, and, if possible, extinguished. The author is vilified,\r\nand his work is denounced, and relegated to the ragman. Extremist,\r\nfanatic, ascetic, are the mildest terms employed concerning him, and\r\nhe escapes with rare good fortune if his chastity or virility is not\r\nassailed.\r\n\r\nWe are not going to run any such risks, and so shall not attempt to\r\nenunciate or maintain any theory. We shall content ourselves with\r\nplainly stating established physiological facts by quotations from\r\nstandard medical authors, leaving each reader to draw conclusions and\r\nconstruct a practical formula for himself.\r\n\r\nObject of the Reproductive Functions.--Man, in whatever condition we\r\nfind him, is more or less depraved. This is true as well of the most\r\ncultivated and refined ladies and gentlemen of the great centers of\r\ncivilization, as of the misshapen denizens of African jungles, or the\r\nscarcely human natives of Australia and Terra del Fuego. His appetites,\r\nhis tastes, his habits, even his bodily functions are perverted. Of\r\ncourse, there are degrees of depravity, and varieties of perversion.\r\nIn some respects, savages approach more nearly to the natural state\r\nthan civilized man, and in other particulars, the latter more nearly\r\nrepresents man's natural condition; but in neither barbarism nor\r\ncivilization do we find man in his primitive state.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this universal departure from his original normal\r\ncondition,--the causes of which we need not here trace, since they are\r\nimmaterial in the consideration of this question,--when we wish to\r\nascertain with certainty the functions of certain organs of the human\r\nbody, we are obliged to compare them with the corresponding organs of\r\nlower animals, and study the functions of the latter. It is by this\r\nmethod of investigation that most of the important truths of physiology\r\nhave been developed; and the plan is universally acknowledged to be\r\na proper and logical one.\r\n\r\nThen if we wish to ascertain, with certainty, the true function of the\r\nreproductive organs in man, we must pursue the course above indicated;\r\nin other words, study the function of reproduction in lower animals.\r\nWe say _lower animals_, because man is really an animal, a member of\r\nthe great animal kingdom, though not a beast--at least he should not\r\nbe a beast, though some animals in human form approach very closely\r\nto the line that separates humanity from brutes. We are brought, then,\r\nfor a solution of this problem, to a consideration of the question,\r\nWhat is the object of the reproductive act in those members of the animal\r\nkingdom just below man in the scale of being? Let science tell us, for\r\nzoologists have made a careful study of this subject for centuries.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following paragraphs from one of the most distinguished\r\nand reliable of modern physiologists;[11] the facts which he states\r\nbeing confirmed by all other physiologists:--\r\n\r\n\"Every living being has a definite term of life, through which it passes\r\nby the operation of an invariable law, and which, at some regularly\r\nappointed time, comes to an end.... But while individual organisms are\r\nthus constantly perishing and disappearing from the stage, the\r\nparticular kind, or species, remains in existence.... This process,\r\nby which new organisms make their appearance, to take the place of those\r\nwhich are destroyed, is known as the process of _reproduction_ or\r\n_generation_.\r\n\r\n\"The ovaries, as well as the eggs which they contain, undergo, at\r\nparticular seasons, a periodical development, or increase in growth....\r\nAt the approach of the generative season, in all the lower animals,\r\na certain number of the eggs, which were previously in an imperfect\r\nand inactive condition, begin to increase in size and become somewhat\r\naltered in structure.\"\r\n\r\n\"In most fish and reptiles as well as in birds, this regular process\r\nof maturation and discharge of eggs takes place but once in a year.\r\nIn different species of quadrupeds it may take place annually,\r\nsemi-annually, bi-monthly, or even monthly; but in every instance it\r\nrecurs at regular intervals, and exhibits accordingly, in a marked\r\ndegree, the periodic character which we have seen to belong to most\r\nof the other vital phenomena.\"\r\n\r\n\"In most of the lower orders of animals there is a periodical\r\ndevelopment of the testicles in the male, corresponding in time with\r\nthat of the ovaries in the female. As the ovaries enlarge and the eggs\r\nripen in the one sex, so in the other the testicles increase in size,\r\nas the season of reproduction approaches, and become turgid with\r\nspermatozoa. The accessory organs of generation, at the same time,\r\nshare the unusual activity of the testicles, and become increased in\r\nvascularity and ready to perform their part in the reproductive\r\nfunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Each of the two sexes is then at the same time under the influence\r\nof a corresponding excitement. The unusual development of the genital\r\norgans reacts upon the entire system, and produces a state of peculiar\r\nactivity and excitability, known as the condition of 'erethism.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a remarkable fact, in this connection, that the female of these\r\nanimals will allow the approaches of the male only during and\r\nimmediately after the oestral period; that is, just when the egg is\r\nrecently discharged, and ready for impregnation. At other times, when\r\nsexual intercourse would be necessarily fruitless, the instinct of the\r\nanimal leads her to avoid it; and the concourse of the sexes is\r\naccordingly made to correspond in time with the maturity of the egg\r\nand its aptitude for fecundation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The egg, immediately upon its discharge from the ovary, is ready for\r\nimpregnation. If sexual intercourse happens to take place about that\r\ntime, the egg and the spermatic fluid meet in some part of the female\r\ngenerative passages, and fecundation is accomplished.... If, on the\r\nother hand, coitus do not take place, the egg passes down to the uterus\r\nunimpregnated, loses its vitality after a short time, and is finally\r\ncarried away with the uterine secretions.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is easily understood, therefore, why sexual intercourse should be\r\nmore liable to be followed by pregnancy when it occurs about the\r\nmenstrual epoch than at other times.... Before its discharge, the egg\r\nis immature, and unprepared for impregnation; and after the menstrual\r\nperiod has passed, it gradually loses its freshness and vitality.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Dalton.]\r\n\r\nThe law of periodicity, as it affects the sexual activity of males of\r\nthe human species, is indicated in the following remarks by the same\r\nauthor:--\r\n\r\n\"The same correspondence between the periods of sexual excitement in\r\nthe male and female, is visible in many of the animals [higher mammals],\r\nas well as in fish and reptiles. This is the case in most species which\r\nproduce young but once a year, and at a fixed period, as the deer and\r\nthe wild hog. In other species, on the contrary, such as the dog, the\r\nrabbit, the guinea-pig, etc., where several broods of young are\r\nproduced during the year, or where, as in the human subject, the\r\ngenerative epochs of the female recur at short intervals, so that the\r\nparticular period of impregnation is comparatively indefinite, the\r\ngenerative apparatus of the male is almost always in a state of full\r\ndevelopment; and is excited to action at particular periods, apparently\r\nby some influence derived from the condition of the female.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts presented in the foregoing quotations from Dr. Dalton may\r\nbe summarized as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The sexual function is for the purpose of producing new individuals\r\nto take the place of those who die, and thus preserve the species from\r\nbecoming extinct.\r\n\r\n2. In the animal kingdom generally, the reproductive function is\r\n_necessarily_ a periodical act, dependent upon the development of the\r\nreproductive organs of both the male and the female at stated periods.\r\n\r\n3. In those exceptional cases in which the organs of the male are in\r\na state of constant development, sexual congress occurs, in lower\r\nanimals, only at those periods when the periodical development occurs\r\nin the female.\r\n\r\n4. Fecundation of the female element can only take place about the time\r\nof periodical development in the female.\r\n\r\n5. The desire for sexual congress naturally exists in the female only\r\nat or immediately after the time of periodical development.\r\n\r\n6. The constant development of the sexual organs in human males is a\r\ncondition common to all animals in which development occurs in the\r\nfemale at short intervals, and is a provision of nature to secure a\r\nfruitful union when the female is in readiness, but not an indication\r\nfor constant or frequent use.\r\n\r\n7. The time of sexual congress is always determined by the condition\r\nand desires of the female.\r\n\r\nAn additional fact, as stated by physiologists, is that, under normal\r\nconditions, the human female experiences sexual desire immediately\r\nafter menstruation more than at any other time. It has, indeed, been\r\nclaimed that at this period only does she experience the true sexual\r\ninstinct unless it is abnormally excited by disease or otherwise.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts the following conclusions must evidently be drawn:--\r\n\r\n1. The fact that in all animals but the human species the act can be\r\nperformed only when reproduction is possible, proves that in the animal\r\nkingdom in general the sole object of the function is reproduction.\r\nWhether man is an exception, must be determined from other\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n2. The fact that the males of other animals besides man in which the\r\nsexual organs are in a state of constant development do not exercise\r\nthose organs except for the purpose of reproduction, is proof of the\r\nposition that the constant development in man is not a warrant for their\r\nconstant use.\r\n\r\n3. The general law that the reproductive act is performed only when\r\ndesired by the female, is sufficient ground for supposing that such\r\nshould be the case with the human species also.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of writers of note are given in the following quotations:--\r\n\r\n\"The approach of the sexes is, in its purest condition, the result of\r\na natural instinct, the end of which is the reproduction of the species.\r\nStill, however, we are far from saying that this ultimate result is,\r\nin any proportion of cases, the actual thought in the minds of the\r\nparties engaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"The very lively solicitations which spring from the genital sense,\r\nhave no other end than to insure the perpetuity of the race.\"[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Dr. Gardner.]\r\n\r\n\"Observation fully confirms the views of inductive philosophy; for it\r\nproves to us that coitus, exercised otherwise than under the\r\ninspirations of honest instinct, is a cause of disease in both sexes,\r\nand of danger to the social order.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Mayer.]\r\n\r\n\"It is incredible that the act of bringing men into life, that act of\r\nhumanity, without contradiction of the most importance, should be the\r\none of which there should have been the least supposed necessity for\r\nregulation, or which has been regulated the least beneficially.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Dunoyer.]\r\n\r\n\"But it may be said that the demands of nature are, in the married state,\r\nnot only legal, but should be physically right. So they are, when our\r\nphysical life is right; but it must not be forgotten that few live in\r\na truly physical rectitude.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Gardner.]\r\n\r\n\"Among cattle, the sexes meet by common instinct and common will; it\r\nis reserved for the human animal to treat the female as a mere victim\r\nto his lust.\"[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Quarterly Review.]\r\n\r\n\"He is an ill husband that _uses his wife as a man treats a harlot_,\r\nhaving no other end but pleasure. Concerning which our best rule is,\r\nthat although in this, as in eating and drinking, there is an appetite\r\nto be satisfied, which cannot be done without pleasing that desire,\r\nyet since that desire and satisfaction were intended by nature for other\r\nends, they should never be separated from those ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a sad truth that many married persons, thinking that the\r\nflood-gates of liberty are set wide open, without measures or\r\nrestraints (so they sail in the channel), have felt the final rewards\r\nof intemperance and lust by their unlawful using of lawful permissions.\r\nOnly let each of them be temperate, and both of them modest.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Jeremy Taylor.]\r\n\r\nSays another writer very emphatically, \"It is a common belief that a\r\nman and woman, because they are legally united in marriage, are\r\nprivileged to the unbridled exercises of amativeness. This is wrong.\r\nNature, in the exercise of her laws, recognizes no human enactments,\r\nand is as prompt to punish any infringement of her laws in those who\r\nare legally married, as in those out of the bonds. Excessive indulgence\r\nbetween the married produces as great and lasting evil effects as in\r\nthe single man or woman, and is nothing more or less than legalized\r\nprostitution.\"\r\n\r\nResults of Excesses.--The sad results of excessive indulgences are seen\r\non every hand. Numerous ailments attributed to overwork,\r\nconstitutional disease, or hereditary predisposition, know no other\r\ncause and need no other explanation.\r\n\r\n_Effects upon Husbands_.--No doubt the principal blame in this matter\r\nproperly falls upon the husband; but it cannot be said that he is the\r\ngreatest sufferer; however, his punishment is severe enough to clearly\r\nindicate the enormity of the transgression, and to warn him to a\r\nreformation of his habits. The following is a quotation from an eminent\r\nmedical authority:--\r\n\r\n\"But any warning against sexual dangers would be very incomplete if\r\nit did not extend to the excesses so often committed by married persons\r\nin ignorance of their ill effects. Too frequent emissions of the\r\nlife-giving fluid, and too frequent excitement of the nervous system\r\nare, as we have seen, in themselves most destructive. The result is\r\nthe same within the marriage bond as without it. The married man who\r\nthinks that because he is a married man he can commit no excess, however\r\noften the act of sexual congress is repeated, will suffer as certainly\r\nand as seriously as the unmarried debauchee who acts on the same\r\nprinciple in his indulgences--perhaps more certainly from his very\r\nignorance, and from his not taking those precautions and following\r\nthose rules which a career of vice is apt to teach the sensualist. Many\r\na man has, until his marriage, lived a most continent life; so has his\r\nwife. As soon as they are wedded, intercourse is indulged in night after\r\nnight, neither party having any idea that these repeated sexual acts\r\nare excesses which the system of neither can bear, and which to the\r\nman, at least, are absolute ruin. The practice is continued till health\r\nis impaired, sometimes permanently, and when a patient is at last\r\nobliged to seek medical advice, he is thunderstruck at learning that\r\nhis sufferings arise from excesses unwittingly committed. Married\r\npeople often appear to think that connection may be repeated as\r\nregularly and almost as often as their meals. Till they are told of\r\nthe danger, the idea never enters their heads that they are guilty of\r\ngreat and almost criminal excess; nor is this to be wondered at, since\r\nthe possibility of such a cause of disease is seldom hinted at by the\r\nmedical man they consult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some go so far as to believe that indulgence may increase these powers,\r\njust as gymnastic exercises augment the force of the muscles. This is\r\na popular error; and requires correction. Such patients should be told\r\nthat the shock on the system each time connection is indulged in, is\r\nvery powerful, and that the expenditure of seminal fluid must be\r\nparticularly injurious to organs previously debilitated. It is by this\r\nand similar excesses that premature old age and complaints of the\r\ngenerative organs are brought on.\"\r\n\r\n\"The length to which married people carry excesses is perfectly\r\nastonishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since my attention has been particularly called to this class of\r\nailments, I feel confident that many of the forms of indigestion,\r\ngeneral ill health, hypochondriasis, etc., so often met with in adults,\r\ndepend upon sexual excesses.... That this cause of illness is not more\r\ngenerally acknowledged and acted on, arises from the natural delicacy\r\nwhich medical men must feel in putting such questions to their patients\r\nas are necessary to elicit the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the body alone which suffers from excesses committed in\r\nmarried life. Experience every day convinces me that much of the languor\r\nof mind, confusion of ideas, and inability to control the thoughts,\r\nof which some married men complain, arise from this cause.\"[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Acton.]\r\n\r\nThe debilitating effects of excessive sexual indulgence arise from two\r\ncauses; viz., the loss of the seminal fluid, and the nervous excitement.\r\nWith reference to the value of the spermatic fluid, Dr. Gardner\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n\"The sperm is the purest extract of the blood.... Nature, in creating\r\nit, has intended it not only to communicate life, but also to nourish\r\nthe individual life. In fact, the re-absorption of the fecundating\r\nliquid impresses upon the entire economy new energy, and a virility\r\nwhich contributes to the prolongation of life.\"\r\n\r\nTestimony of a French Physician.--A French author of considerable\r\nnote,[19] remarks on the same subject:--\r\n\r\n\"Nothing costs the economy so much as the production of semen and its\r\nforced ejaculation. It has been calculated that an ounce of semen was\r\nequivalent to forty ounces of blood.... Semen is the essence of the\r\nwhole individual. Hence, Fernel has said, 'Totus homo semen est.' It\r\nis the balm of life.... That which gives life is intended for its\r\npreservation.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Parise.]\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned, perhaps, whether physiology will sustain to the\r\nfullest extent all the statements made in the last quotation; but\r\nperhaps physiology does not appreciate so fully as does pathology the\r\nworth of the most vital of all fluids, and the fearful results which\r\nfollow its useless expenditure.\r\n\r\nContinence of Trainers.--\"The moderns who are training are well aware\r\nthat sexual indulgence wholly unfits them for great feats of strength,\r\nand the captain of a boat strictly forbids his crew anything of the\r\nsort just previous to a match. Some trainers have gone so far as to\r\nassure me that they can discover by a man's style of pulling whether\r\nhe has committed such a breach of discipline over night, and have not\r\nscrupled to attribute the occasional loss of matches to this\r\ncause.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Acton.]\r\n\r\nA Cause of Throat Disease.--The disease known as \"_clergyman's sore\r\nthroat_\" is believed by many eminent physicians to have its chief origin\r\nin excessive venery. It is well known that sexual abuse is a very potent\r\ncause of throat diseases. This view is supported by the following from\r\nthe pen of the learned Dr. X. Bourgeois:--\r\n\r\n\"We ought not, then, to be surprised that the physiological act,\r\nrequiring so great an expenditure of vitality, must be injurious in\r\nthe highest degree, when it is reiterated abusively. To engender is\r\nto give a portion of one's life. Does not he who is prodigal of himself\r\nprecipitate his own ruin? A peculiar character of the diseases which\r\nhave their origin in venereal excesses and masturbation is chronicity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Individual predispositions, acquired or hereditary, engender for each\r\na series of peculiar ills. In some, the debility bears upon the\r\npulmonary organs. Hence results the dry cough, prolonged hoarseness,\r\nstitch in the side, spitting of blood, and finally phthisis. How many\r\nexamples are there of young debauchees who have been devoured by this\r\ncruel disease!... It is, of all the grave maladies, the one which\r\nvenereal abuses provoke the most frequently. Portal, Bayle, Louis, say\r\nthis distinctly.\"\r\n\r\nA Cause of Consumption.--This fatal disease finds a large share of its\r\nvictims among those addicted to sexual excesses, either of an illicit\r\nnature or within the marriage pale, for the physical effects are\r\nessentially identical. This cause is especially active and fatal with\r\nsedentary persons, but is sufficiently powerful to undermine the\r\nconstitution under the most favorable circumstances, as the following\r\ncase illustrates:--\r\n\r\nThe patient was a young man of twenty-two, large, muscular, and well\r\ndeveloped, having uncommonly broad shoulders and a full chest. His\r\noccupation had been healthful, that of a laborer. Had had cough for\r\nseveral months, and was spitting blood. Examination of lungs showed\r\nthat they were hopelessly diseased. There was no trace of consumption\r\nin the family, and the only cause to which the disease could be\r\nattributed was excessive sexual indulgence, which he confessed to have\r\npracticed for several years.\r\n\r\nEffects on Wives.--If husbands are great sufferers, as we have seen,\r\nwives suffer still more terribly, being of feebler constitution, and\r\nhence less able to bear the frequent shock which is suffered by the\r\nnervous system. Dr. Gardner places this evil prominent among the causes\r\n\"the result of which we see deplored in the public press of the day,\r\nwhich warns us that the American race is fast dying out, and that its\r\nplace is being filled by emigrants of different lineage, religion,\r\npolitical ideas, and education.\"\r\n\r\nThe same author remarks further on the results of this with other causes\r\nwhich largely grow out of it:--\r\n\r\n\"It has been a matter of common observation that the physical status\r\nof the women of Christendom has been gradually deteriorating; that\r\ntheir mental energies were uncertain and spasmodic; that they were\r\nprematurely care-worn, wrinkled, and enervated; that they became\r\nsubject to a host of diseases scarcely ever known to the professional\r\nmen of past times, but now familiar to, and the common talk of, the\r\nmatrons, and often, indeed, of the youngest females in the community.\"\r\n\r\nSo prevalent are these maladies that Michelet says with truth that the\r\npresent is the \"age of womb diseases.\"\r\n\r\nEvery physician of observation and experience has met many cases\r\nillustrative of the serious effects of the evil named. Some years ago,\r\nwhen acting as assistant physician in a large dispensary in an Eastern\r\ncity, a young woman applied for examination and treatment. She\r\npresented a great variety of nervous symptoms, prominent among which\r\nwere those of mild hysteria and nervous exhaustion, together with\r\nimpaired digestion and violent palpitation of the heart. In our\r\ninquiries respecting the cause of these difficulties, we learned that\r\nshe had been married but about six months. A little careful questioning\r\nelicited the fact that sexual indulgence was invariably practiced every\r\nnight, and often two or three times, occasionally as many as four times\r\na night. We had the key to her troubles at once, and ordered entire\r\ncontinence for a month. From her subsequent reports I learned that her\r\nhusband would not allow her to comply with the request, but that\r\nindulgence was much less frequent than before. The result was not all\r\nthat could be desired, but there was marked improvement. If the husband\r\nhad been willing to \"do right,\" entire recovery would have taken place\r\nwith rapidity.\r\n\r\nAnother case came under our observation in which the patient, a man,\r\nconfessed to having indulged every night for twenty years. We did not\r\nwonder that at forty he was a complete physical wreck.\r\n\r\nThe Greatest Cause of Uterine Disease.--Dr. J. R. Black remarks as\r\nfollows on this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"Medical writers agree that one of the most common causes of the many\r\nforms of derangement to which woman is subject consists in excessive\r\ncohabitation. The diseases known as menorrhagia, dysmenorrhoea,\r\nleucorrhoea, amenorrhoea, abortions, prolapsus, chronic inflammations\r\nand ulcerations of the womb, with a yet greater variety of sympathetic\r\nnervous disorders, are some of the distressing forms of these\r\nderangements. The popular way of accounting for many of these ills is\r\nthat they come from colds or from straining lifts. But if colds and\r\ngreat strain upon the parts in question develop such diseases, why are\r\nthey not seen among the inferior animals? The climatic alternations\r\nthey endure, the severe labor some of them are obliged to perform, ought\r\nto cause their ruin; or else in popular phrase, 'make them catch their\r\ndeaths from cold.'\"\r\n\r\nLegalized Murder.--A medical writer of considerable ability presents\r\nthe following picture, the counterpart of which almost any one can\r\nrecall as having occurred within the circle of his acquaintance;\r\nperhaps numerous cases will be recalled by one who has been especially\r\nobserving:--\r\n\r\n\"A man of great vital force is united to a woman of evenly-balanced\r\norganization. The husband, in the exercise of what he is pleased to\r\nterm his 'marital rights,' places his wife, in a short time, on the\r\nnervous, delicate, sickly list. In the blindness and ignorance of his\r\nanimal nature, he requires prompt obedience to his desires; and,\r\nignorant of the law of right in this direction, thinking that it is\r\nher duty to accede to his wishes, though fulfilling them with a sore\r\nand troubled heart, she allows him passively, never lovingly, to\r\nexercise daily and weekly, month in and month out, the low and beastly\r\nof his nature, and eventually, slowly but surely, to kill her. And this\r\nman, who has as surely committed murder as has the convicted assassin,\r\nlures to his net and takes unto him another wife, to repeat the same\r\nprogramme of legalized prostitution on his part, and sickness and\r\npremature death on her part.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Gerrish, in a little work from which we take the liberty to quote,\r\nspeaks as follows on this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"One man reckless of his duty to the community, marries young, with\r\nmeans and prospects inadequate to support the family which is so sure\r\nto come ere long. His ostensible excuse is love; his real reason the\r\ngratification of his carnal instincts. Another man, in exactly similar\r\ncircumstances, but too conscientious to assume responsibilities which\r\nhe cannot carry, and in which failure must compromise the comfort and\r\ntax the purses of people from whom he has no right to extort luxuries,\r\nforbears to marry; but, feeling the passions of his sex, and being\r\nimbued with the prevalent errors on such matters, resorts for relief\r\nto unlawful coition. At the wedding of the former, pious friends\r\nassemble with their presents and congratulations, and bid the legalized\r\nprostitution Godspeed. Love shields the crime, all the more easily\r\nbecause so many of the rejoicing guests have sinned in precisely the\r\nsame way. The other man has no festival gathering.... Society applauds\r\nthe first and frowns on the second; but, to my mind, the difference\r\nbetween them is not markedly in favor of the former.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hear a good deal said about certain crimes against nature, such\r\nas pederasty and sodomy, and they meet with the indignant condemnation\r\nof all right-minded persons. The statutes are especially severe on\r\noffenders of this class, the penalty being imprisonment between one\r\nand ten years, whereas fornication is punished by imprisonment for not\r\nmore than sixty days and a fine of less than one hundred dollars. But\r\nthe query very pertinently arises just here as to whether the use of\r\nthe condom and defertilizing injections is not equally a crime against\r\nnature, and quite as worthy of our detestation and contempt. And,\r\nfurther, when we consider the brute creation, and see that they, guided\r\nby instinct, copulate only when the female is in proper physiological\r\ncondition and yields a willing consent, it may be suggested that\r\ncongress between men and women may, in certain circumstances, be a crime\r\nagainst nature, and one far worse in its results than any other. Is\r\nit probable that a child born of a connection to which the woman objects\r\nwill possess that felicitous organization which every parent should\r\nearnestly desire and endeavor to bestow on his offspring? Can the\r\nunwelcome fruit of a rape be considered, what every child has a right\r\nto be, a pledge of affection? Poor little Pip, in 'Great Expectations,'\r\nspoke as the representative of a numerous class when he said, 'I was\r\nalways treated as if I had insisted on being born, in opposition to\r\nthe dictates of reason, religion and morality, and against the\r\ndissuading arguments of my best friends.' We enjoin the young to honor\r\nfather and mother, never thinking how undeserving of respect are those\r\nwhose children suffer from inherited ills, the result of the\r\nselfishness and carelessness of their parents in begetting them.\r\n\r\n\"These accidental pregnancies are the great immediate cause of the\r\nenormously common crime of abortion, concerning which the morals of\r\nthe people are amazingly blunted. The extent of the practice may be\r\nroughly estimated by the number of standing advertisements in the\r\nfamily newspapers, in which feticide is warranted safe and secret. It\r\nis not the poor only who take advantage of such nefarious opportunities;\r\nbut the rich shamelessly patronize these professional and cowardly\r\nmurderers of defenseless infancy. Madame Restell, who recently died\r\nby her own hand in New York, left a fortune of a million dollars, which\r\nshe had accumulated by producing abortions.\"\r\n\r\nA husband who has not sunk in his carnality too far below the brute\r\ncreation will certainly pause a moment, in the face of such terrible\r\nfacts, before he continues his sensual, selfish, murderous course.\r\n\r\nIndulgence during Menstruation.--The following remarks which our own\r\nprofessional experience has several times confirmed, reveal a still\r\nmore heinous violation of nature's laws:--\r\n\r\n\"To many it may seem that it is unnecessary to caution against\r\ncontracting relationships at the period of the monthly flow, thinking\r\nthat the instinctive laws of cleanliness and delicacy were sufficient\r\nto refrain the indulgence of the appetites; but they are little\r\ncognizant of the true condition of things in this world. Often have\r\nI had husbands inform me that they had not missed having sexual\r\nrelations with their wives once or more times a day for several years;\r\nand scores of women with delicate frames and broken-down health have\r\nrevealed to me similar facts, and I have been compelled to make personal\r\nappeals to the husbands.\"[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Gardner.]\r\n\r\nThe following is an important testimony by an eminent physician[22]\r\nupon the same point:--\r\n\r\n\"Females whose health is in a weak state ... become liable, in\r\ntransgressing this law, to an infectious disorder, which, it is\r\ncommonly supposed, can only originate or prevail among disreputable\r\ncharacters; but Dr. Bumstead and a number of other eminent authorities\r\nbelieve and teach that gonorrhoea may originate among women entirely\r\nvirtuous in the ordinary sense of the term. That excessive venery is\r\nthe chief cause that originates this peculiar form of inflammation,\r\nhas long been the settled opinion of medical men.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Dr. J. R. Black.]\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely possible that such enormity could be committed by\r\nany human being, at least by civilized men, and in the face of the\r\ninjunctions of Moses to the Jews, to say nothing of the evident\r\nindecency of the act. The Jews still maintain their integrity to the\r\nobservance of this command of their ancient lawgiver.\r\n\r\n\"Reason and experience both show that sexual relations at the menstrual\r\nperiod are very dangerous to both man and woman, and perhaps also for\r\nthe offspring, should there chance to be conception.\"[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Mayer.]\r\n\r\nThe woman suffers from the congestion and nervous excitement which\r\noccur at the most inopportune moment possible. Man may suffer physical\r\ninjury, though there are no grounds for the assertions of Pliny that\r\nthe menstrual blood is so potent for evil that it will, by a mere touch,\r\nrust iron, render a tree sterile, make dogs mad, etc., or that of\r\nParacelsus that \"of it the devil makes spiders, fleas, caterpillars,\r\nand all the other insects that people the air.\"\r\n\r\nEffects upon Offspring.--That those guilty of the transgression should\r\nsuffer, seems only just; but that an innocent being who had no part\r\nin the sin--no voice in the time or manner of its advent into the\r\nworld--that such a one should suffer equally, if not more bitterly,\r\nwith the transgressors themselves, seems anything but just. But such\r\nis nature's inexorable law, that the iniquities of the parents shall\r\nbe visited upon the children; and this fact should be a most powerful\r\ninfluence to prevent parental transgression, especially in this\r\ndirection, in which the dire consequences fall so heavily and so\r\nimmediately upon an innocent being.\r\n\r\nSays Acton, \"The ill effects of marital excesses are not confined to\r\noffending parties. No doubt can exist that many of the obscure cases\r\nof sickly children, born of apparently healthy parents, arise from this\r\ncause; and this is borne out by investigations amongst animals.\"\r\n\r\nBreeders of stock who wish to secure sound progeny will not allow the\r\nmost robust stallion to associate with mares as many times during the\r\nwhole season as some of these salacious human males perform a similar\r\nact within a month. One reason why the offspring suffer is that the\r\nseminal fluid deteriorates very rapidly by repeated indulgence. The\r\nspermatozoa do not have time to become maturely developed. Progeny\r\nresulting from such immature elements will possess the same deficiency.\r\nHence the hosts of deformed, scrofulous, weazen, and idiotic children\r\nwhich curse the race, and testify to the sensuality of their progenitors.\r\nAnother reason is the physical and nervous exhaustion which the parents\r\nbring upon themselves, and which totally unfits them to beget sound,\r\nhealthy offspring.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this evil may often be traced in a large family of\r\nchildren, nearly all of whom show traces of the excesses of their\r\nparents. It commonly happens, too, that such large families are on the\r\nhands of poor men who cannot earn enough to give them sufficient food\r\nand comfortable clothing, with nothing whatever to provide for their\r\neducation. The overburdened mother has her strength totally exhausted\r\nby the excessive demands upon her system incident to child-bearing,\r\nso that she is unable to give her children that culture and training\r\nwhich all children need. More than as likely as not she feels that they\r\nwere forced upon her, and hence she cannot hold for them all that tender\r\nsympathy and affection a mother should feel. The little ones grow up\r\nignorant and often vicious; for want of home care drives them to the\r\nstreet. Thus does one evil create another.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a question which deserves some attention, whether it\r\nis not a sin for parents to bring into the world more children than\r\nthey can properly care for. If they can rear and educate three children\r\nproperly, the same work would be only half done for six; and there are\r\nalready in the world a sufficiency of half-raised people. From this\r\nclass of society the ranks of thieves, drunkards, beggars, vagabonds,\r\nand prostitutes, are recruited. Why should it be considered an improper\r\nor immoral thing to limit the number of children according to the\r\ncircumstances of the parents? Ought it not to be considered a crime\r\nagainst childhood and against the race to do otherwise? It is seriously\r\nmaintained by a number of distinguished persons that man \"is in duty\r\nbound to limit the number of his children as well as the sheep on his\r\nfarm; the number of each to be according to the adequacy of his means\r\nfor their support.\"\r\n\r\nIndulgence during Pregnancy.--Transgressions of this sort are followed\r\nby the worst results of any form of marital excess. The mother suffers\r\ndoubly, because laden with the burden of supporting two lives instead\r\nof one. But the results upon the child are especially disastrous. During\r\nthe time when it is receiving its stock of vitality, while its plastic\r\nform is being molded, and its various organs acquiring that integrity\r\nof structure which makes up what is called constitutional\r\nvigor,--during this most critical of all periods in the life of the\r\nnew being, its resources are exhausted and its structure depraved--and\r\nthus constitutional tendencies to disease produced--by the unnatural\r\ndemands made upon the mother.\r\n\r\nEffect upon the Character.--Still another terrible consequence results\r\nfrom this practice so contrary to nature. The delicate brain, which\r\nis being molded, with the other organs of the body, receives its cast\r\nlargely from those mental and nervous sensations and actions of the\r\nmother which are the most intense. One of the most certain effects of\r\nsexual indulgence at this time is to develop abnormally the sexual\r\ninstinct in the child. Here is the key to the origin of much of the\r\nsexual precocity and depravity which curse humanity. Sensuality is born\r\nin the souls of a large share of the rising generation. What wonder\r\nthat prostitution flourishes in spite of Christianity and civil law?\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that all medical testimony concurs in\r\nforbidding indulgence during gestation. The same reasons require its\r\ninterdiction during the nursing period. The fact that fecundation would\r\nbe impossible during pregnancy, and that during this period the female,\r\nnormally, has no sexual desire, are other powerful arguments in favor\r\nof perfect continence at this time.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following from a work on health by Dr. J. R. Black:--\r\n\r\n\"Coition during pregnancy is one of the ways in which the predisposition\r\nis laid for that terrible disease in children, epilepsy. The unnatural\r\nexcitement of the nervous system in the mother by such a cause cannot\r\noperate otherwise than by inflicting injury upon the tender germ in\r\nher womb. This germ, it must be remembered, derives every quality it\r\npossesses from the parents, as well as every particle of matter of which\r\nit is composed. The old notion of anything like spontaneity in the\r\ndevelopment of the qualities of a new being is at variance with all\r\nthe latest facts and inductions concerning reproduction. And so is that\r\nof a creative fiat. The smallest organic cell, as well as the most\r\ncomplicated organism, in form and quality, is wholly dependent upon\r\nthe laws of derivation.\r\n\r\n\"These laws are competent to explain, however subtle the ultimate\r\nprocess may be, the great diversities of human organization and\r\ncharacter. Impressions from without, the emotions, conduct, and play\r\nof the organic processes within, are never alike from day to day, or\r\nfrom hour to hour; and it is from the aggregate of these in the parents,\r\nbut especially of those in the mother immediately before and after\r\nconception, that the quality of the offspring is determined. Suppose,\r\nthen, that there is every now and then an unnatural, excited, and\r\nexhausted state of the nervous system produced in the mother by\r\nexcessive cohabitation, is it any wonder that the child's nervous\r\nsystem, which derives its qualities from those of its parents, should\r\ntake its peculiar stamp from that of the parent in whom it lives, moves,\r\nand has its being?\r\n\r\n\"In the adult, epilepsy is frequently developed by excessive venery;\r\nand the child born with such a predisposition will be exceedingly liable\r\nto the disease during its early years when the nervous system is\r\nnotoriously prone to deranged action from very slight disturbing\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\"The infringement of this law regulating intercourse during pregnancy\r\nalso reacts injuriously upon the mental capacity of the child, tending\r\nto give it a stupid, animalized look; and, there is also good reason\r\nto believe, aids in developing the idiotic condition.\"\r\n\r\nA Selfish Objection.--The married man will raise the plea that\r\nindulgence is to him a necessity. He has only to practice the principles\r\nlaid down for the maintenance of continence to entirely remove any such\r\nnecessity should there be the slightest semblance of a real demand.\r\nAgain, what many mistake for an indication of the necessity for\r\nindulgence, to relieve an accumulation of semen, is in fact, to state\r\nthe exact truth, but a call of nature for a movement of the bowels.\r\nHow this may occur, has already been explained, as being due to the\r\npressure of the distended rectum upon the internal organs of generation\r\nsituated at the base of the bladder. It is for this reason, chiefly,\r\nthat a good share of sexual excesses occur in the morning.\r\n\r\nBut, aside from all other considerations, is it not the most supreme\r\nselfishness for a man to consider only himself in his sexual relations,\r\nmaking his wife wholly subservient to his own desires? As a learned\r\nprofessor remarks, in speaking of woman, \"Who has a right to regard\r\nher as a therapeutic agent?\"\r\n\r\nBrutes and Savages More Considerate.--It is only the civilized,\r\nChristianized (?) male human being who complains of the restraint\r\nimposed upon him by the laws of nature. The untutored barbarian, even\r\nsome of the lowest of those who wear the human form, together with nearly\r\nall of the various classes of lower animals, abstain from sexual\r\nindulgence during pregnancy. The natives of the Gold Coast and many\r\nother African tribes regard it as a shameful offense to cohabit during\r\ngestation. In the case of lower animals, even when the male desires\r\nindulgence, the female resents any attempt of the sort by the most\r\nvigorous resistance.\r\n\r\nAre not these wholesome lessons for that portion of the human race which\r\nprofesses to represent the accumulated wisdom, intelligence, and\r\nrefinement of the world? Those who need reproof on this point may\r\nreflect that by a continuance of the evil practice they are placing\r\nthemselves on a plane even below the uncouth negro who haunts the\r\njungles of Southern Africa.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following from the pen of a talented professor in a\r\nwell-known medical college:--\r\n\r\n\"I believe we cannot too strenuously insist upon this point--that\r\nsexual intercourse should never be undertaken with any other object\r\nthan procreation, and never then unless the conditions are favorable\r\nto the production of a new being who will be likely to have cause to\r\nthankfully bless his parents for the gift of life. If this rule were\r\ngenerally observed, we should have no broken-nosed Tristram Shandys\r\ncomplaining of the carelessness of their fathers in begetting\r\nthem.\"[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Dr. Gerrish.]\r\n\r\nWhat May Be Done?--But what is the practical conclusion to be drawn\r\nfrom all the foregoing? What _should_ people do? what _may_ they do?\r\nDr. Gardner offers the following remarks, which partially answer the\r\nquestions:--\r\n\r\n\"We have shown that we can 'DO RIGHT' without prejudice to health by\r\nthe exercise of continence. Self-restraint, the ruling of the passions,\r\nis a virtue, and is within the power of all well-regulated minds. Nor\r\nis this necessarily perpetual or absolute. The passions may be\r\nrestrained within proper limitations. He who indulges in lascivious\r\nthoughts may stimulate himself to frenzy; but if his mind were under\r\nproper control, he would find other employment for it, and his body,\r\nobedient to its potent sway, would not become the master of the man.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are the \"proper limitations,\" every person must decide for himself\r\nin view of the facts which have been presented. If he find that the\r\nanimal in his nature is too strong to allow him to comply with what\r\nseems to be the requirements of natural law, let him approximate as\r\nnearly to the truth as possible. \"Let every man be fully persuaded in\r\nhis own mind,\" and act accordingly, not forgetting that this is a matter\r\nwith serious moral bearings, and, hence, one in which conscience should\r\nbe on the alert. It is of no use to reject truth because it is\r\nunpalatable. There can be nothing worse for a man than to \"know the\r\ntruth and do it not.\"\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to say that there is a wide diversity of opinion among\r\nmedical men on this subject. A very few hold that the sexual act should\r\nnever be indulged except for the purpose of reproduction, and then only\r\nat periods when reproduction will be possible. Others, while equally\r\nopposed to the excesses, the effects of which have been described, limit\r\nindulgence to the number of months in the year.\r\n\r\nRead, reflect, weigh well the matter, then fix upon a plan of action,\r\nand, if it be in accordance with the dictates of better judgment, do\r\nnot swerve from it.\r\n\r\nIf the suggestion made near the outset of these remarks, in comparing\r\nthe reproductive function in man and animals--viz., that the seasons\r\nof sexual approach should be governed by the inclination of the\r\nfemale--were conscientiously followed, it would undoubtedly do away\r\nwith at least three-fourths of the excesses which have been under\r\nconsideration. Before rejecting the hint so plainly offered by nature,\r\nlet every man consider for a moment whether he has any other than purely\r\nselfish arguments to produce against it.\r\n\r\nEarly Moderation.--The time of all others when moderation is most\r\nimperatively demanded, yet least likely to be practiced, is at the\r\nbeginning of matrimonial life. Many a woman dates the beginning of a\r\nlife of suffering from the first night after marriage; and the mental\r\nsuffering from the disgusting and even horrible recollections of that\r\nnight, the events of which were scarred upon her mind as well as upon\r\nher body, have made her equally as wretched mentally as bodily.\r\n\r\nA learned French writer, in referring to this subject, says, \"The\r\nhusband who begins with his wife by a rape is a lost man. He will never\r\nbe loved.\"\r\n\r\nWe quote the following very sensible words from Dr. Napheys:--\r\n\r\n\"It sometimes happens that marriage is consummated with difficulty.\r\nTo overcome this, care, management, and forbearance should always be\r\nemployed, and anything like precipitation and violence avoided.\"\r\n\r\nCases have come under our care of young wives who have required months\r\nof careful treatment to repair the damage inflicted on their wedding\r\nnight. A medical writer has reported a case in which he was called upon\r\nto testify in a suit for divorce, which is an illustration of so gross\r\na degree of sensuality that the perpetrator certainly deserved most\r\nsevere punishment. The victim, a beautiful and accomplished young lady,\r\nto please her parents, was married to a man much older than herself,\r\nriches being the chief attraction. She at once began to pine, and in\r\na very few months was a complete wreck. Emaciated, spiritless, haggard,\r\nshe was scarcely a shadow of her former self. The physician who was\r\ncalled in, upon making a local examination, found those delicate organs\r\nin a state of most terrible laceration and inflammation. The bladder,\r\nrectum, and other adjacent organs, were highly inflamed, and sensitive\r\nin the highest degree. Upon inquiring respecting the cause, he found\r\nthat from the initial night she had been subjected to the most excessive\r\ndemands by her husband, \"day and night.\" The tortures she had undergone\r\nhad been terrific; and her mind trembled upon the verge of insanity.\r\nShe entered suit for divorce on the charge of cruelty, but was defeated,\r\nthe judge ruling that the law has no jurisdiction in matters of that\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nIn another somewhat similar case which came to our knowledge, a young\r\nwife was delivered from the lecherous assaults of her husband--for they\r\nwere no better--by the common sense of her neighbor friends, who\r\ngathered in force and insisted upon their discontinuance. It is only\r\nnow and then that cases of this sort come to the surface. The majority\r\nof them are hidden deep down in the heart of the poor, heart-broken\r\nwife, and too often they are hidden along with the victim in an early\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF CONCEPTION:\r\nITS EVILS AND DANGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evil considered in the preceding section is by far the greatest\r\ncause of those which will be dwelt upon in this. Excesses are habitually\r\npracticed through ignorance or carelessness of their direct results,\r\nand then to prevent the legitimate result of the reproductive act,\r\ninnumerable devices are employed to render it fruitless. To even\r\nmention all of these would be too great a breach of propriety, even\r\nin this plain-spoken work; but accurate description is unnecessary,\r\nsince those who need this warning are perfectly familiar with all the\r\nfoul accessories of evil thus employed. We cannot do better than to\r\nquote from the writings of several of the most eminent authors upon\r\nthis subject. The following paragraphs are from the distinguished Mayer,\r\nwho has already been frequently quoted:--\r\n\r\n\"The numerous stratagems invented by debauch to annihilate the natural\r\nconsequences of coition, have all the same end in view.\"\r\n\r\nConjugal Onanism.--\"The soiling of the conjugal bed by the shameful\r\nmaneuvers to which we have made allusion, is mentioned for the first\r\ntime in Gen. 38:6, and following verses: 'And it came to pass, when\r\nhe [Onan] went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the\r\nground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. And the thing\r\nwhich he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew him.'\r\n\r\n\"Hence the name of _conjugal onanism_.\r\n\r\n\"One cannot tell to what great extent this vice is practiced, except\r\nby observing its consequences, even among people who fear to commit\r\nthe slightest sin, to such a degree is the public conscience perverted\r\nupon this point. Still, many husbands know that nature often succeeds\r\nin rendering nugatory the most subtle calculations, and reconquers the\r\nrights which they have striven to frustrate. No matter; they persevere,\r\nnone the less, and by the force of habit they poison the most blissful\r\nmoments of life, with no surety of averting the result that they fear.\r\nSo, who knows if the infants, too often feeble and weazen, are not the\r\nfruit of these in themselves incomplete _procreations_, and disturbed\r\nby preoccupations foreign to the generic act? Is it not reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the creative power, not meeting in its disturbed functions\r\nthe conditions necessary for the elaboration of a normal product, the\r\nconception might be from its origin imperfect, and the being which\r\nproceeded therefrom, one of those monsters which are described in\r\ntreatises on teratology?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see, now, what are the consequences to those given to this\r\npractice of conjugal onanism.\r\n\r\n\"We have at our disposition numerous facts which rigorously prove the\r\ndisastrous influence of abnormal coitus to the woman, but we think it\r\nuseless to publish them. All practitioners have more or less observed\r\nthem, and it will only be necessary for them to call upon their memories\r\nto supply what our silence leaves. 'However, it is not difficult to\r\nconceive,' says Dr. Francis Devay, 'the degree of perturbation that\r\na like practice should exert upon the genital system of woman by\r\nprovoking desires which are not gratified. A profound stimulation is\r\nfelt through the entire apparatus; the uterus, fallopian tubes, and\r\novaries enter into a state of orgasm, a storm which is not appeased\r\nby the natural crisis; a nervous super-excitation persists. There\r\noccurs, then, what would take place if, presenting food to a famished\r\nman, one should snatch it from his mouth after having thus violently\r\nexcited his appetite. The sensibilities of the womb and the entire\r\nreproductive system are teased for no purpose. It is to this cause,\r\ntoo often repeated, that we should attribute the multiple neuroses,\r\nthose strange affections which originate in the genital system of woman.\r\nOur conviction respecting them is based upon a great number of\r\nobservations. Furthermore, the normal relations existing between the\r\nmarried couple undergo unfortunate changes; this affection, founded\r\nupon reciprocal esteem, is little by little effaced by the repetition\r\nof an act which pollutes the marriage bed; from thence proceed certain\r\nhard feelings, certain deep impressions which, gradually growing,\r\neventuate in the scandalous ruptures of which the community rarely know\r\nthe real motive.'\r\n\r\n\"If the good harmony of families and their reciprocal relations are\r\nseriously menaced by the invasion of these detestable practices, the\r\nhealth of women, as we have already intimated, is fearfully injured.\r\nA great number of neuralgias appear to us to have no other cause. Many\r\nwomen that we have interrogated on this matter have fortified this\r\nopinion. But that which to us has passed to the condition of\r\nincontestable proof, is the prevalence of uterine troubles, of\r\nenervation among the married, hysterical symptoms which are met with\r\nin the conjugal relation as often as among young virgins, arising from\r\nthe vicious habits of the husbands in their conjugal intercourse....\r\nStill more, there is a graver affection, which is daily increasing,\r\nand which, if nothing arrests its invasion, will soon have attained\r\nthe proportions of a scourge; we speak of the degeneration of the womb.\r\nWe do not hesitate to place in the foremost rank, among the causes of\r\nthis redoubtable disease, the refinements of civilization, and\r\nespecially the artifices introduced in our day in the generic act. When\r\nthere is no procreation, although the procreative faculties are excited,\r\nwe see these pseudo-morphoses arise. Thus it is noticed that polypi\r\nand schirrus [cancer] of the womb are common among prostitutes. And\r\nit is easy to account for the manner of action of this pathogenetic\r\ncause, if we consider how probable it is that the ejaculation and\r\ncontact of the sperm with the uterine neck, constitutes, for the woman,\r\nthe crisis of the genital function, by appeasing the venereal orgasm\r\nand calming the voluptuous emotions under the action of which the entire\r\neconomy is convulsed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may, we trust, be pardoned for remarking upon the artifices imagined\r\nto prevent fecundation that there is in them an immense danger, of\r\nincalculable limits. We do not fear to be contradicted or taxed with\r\nexaggeration in elevating them into the proportions of a true\r\ncalamity.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from an eminent physician[25] who for many years\r\ndevoted his whole attention to the diseases of women and lectured upon\r\nthe subject in a prominent medical college:--\r\n\r\n\"It is undeniable that all the methods employed to prevent pregnancy\r\nare physically injurious. Some of these have been characterized with\r\nsufficient explicitness, and the injury resulting from incomplete\r\ncoitus to both parties has been made evident to all who are willing\r\nto be convinced. It should require but a moment's consideration to\r\nconvince any one of the harmfulness of the common use of cold ablutions\r\nand astringent infusions and various medicated washes. Simple and often\r\nwonderfully salutary as is cold water to a diseased limb, festering\r\nwith inflammation, yet few are rash enough to cover a gouty toe,\r\nrheumatic knee, or erysipelatous head with cold water.... Yet, when\r\nin the general state of nervous and physical excitement attendant upon\r\ncoitus, when the organs principally engaged in this act are congested\r\nand turgid with blood, do you think you can with impunity throw a flood\r\nof cold or even lukewarm water far into the vitals in a continual stream?\r\nOften, too, women add strong medicinal agents, intended to destroy by\r\ndissolution the spermatic germs, ere they have time to fulfill their\r\nnatural destiny. These powerful astringents suddenly corrugate and\r\nclose the glandular structure of the parts, and this is followed,\r\nnecessarily, by a corresponding reaction, and the final result is\r\ndebility and exhaustion, signalized by leucorrhoea, prolapsus, and\r\nother diseases.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, of the use of intermediate tegumentary coverings, made of\r\nthin rubber or gold-beater's skin, and so often relied upon as absolute\r\npreventives, Madame de Stael is reputed to have said, 'They are cobwebs\r\nfor protection, and bulwarks against love.' Their employment certainly\r\nmust produce a feeling of shame and disgust utterly destructive of the\r\ntrue delight of pure hearts and refined sensibilities. They are\r\nsuggestive of licentiousness and the brothel, and their employment\r\ndegrades to bestiality the true feelings of manhood and the holy state\r\nof matrimony. Neither do they give, except in a very limited degree,\r\nthe protection desired. Furthermore, they produce (as alleged by the\r\nbest modern French writers, who are more familiar with the effect of\r\ntheir use than we are in the United States) certain physical lesions\r\nfrom their irritating presence as foreign bodies, and also, from the\r\nchemicals employed in their fabrication, and other effects inseparable\r\nfrom their employment, ofttimes of a really serious nature.\r\n\r\n\"I will not further enlarge upon these instrumentalities. Sufficient\r\nhas been said to convince any one that to trifle with the grand functions\r\nof our organism, to attempt to deceive and thwart nature in her highly\r\nordained prerogatives--no matter how simple seem to be the means\r\nemployed--is to incur a heavy responsibility and run a fearful risk.\r\nIt matters little whether a railroad train is thrown from the track\r\nby a frozen drop of rain or a huge bowlder lying in the way, the result\r\nis the same, the injuries as great. Moral degradation, physical\r\ndisability, premature exhaustion and decrepitude are the result of\r\nthese physical frauds, and force upon our conviction the adage, which\r\nthe history of every day confirms, that 'honesty is the best policy.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Dr. Gardner.]\r\n\r\nWithin the last ten years we have had under treatment many hundred cases\r\nof ladies suffering from ailments of a character peculiar to the sex;\r\nand in becoming acquainted with the history of individual cases we have,\r\nin many instances, found that the real cause of the disease which had\r\nsapped the vitality and undermined the constitution slowly but surely\r\nuntil cheerful health and freshness had given place to suffering,\r\ndebility, and, in many cases, most deplorable melancholy, was the very\r\ncrime against nature mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. The effects\r\nof these sins against nature are frequently not felt for years after\r\nthe cause has been at work, and even then are seldom attributed to the\r\ntrue cause. In some instances we have known persons to suffer on for\r\nmany years without having once suspected that the cause of their\r\nsufferings was a palpable violation of nature's laws. Uterine diseases\r\nthus induced are among the most obstinate of diseases of this class,\r\nbeing often of long standing, and hence of a very serious character.\r\nDr. Wm. Goodell of Philadelphia has recently called attention to the\r\nfact that the prevention of conception is one of the most common causes\r\nof prolapsus of the ovaries, a very common and painful disease. Not\r\ninfrequently, too, other organs, particularly the bladder, become\r\naffected, either through sympathy or in consequence of the congested\r\ncondition of the contiguous parts.\r\n\r\nA difficulty which we have often met with has been the inability to\r\nconvince those who have been guilty of the practices referred to, of\r\nthe enormity of the sin against both soul and body. In spite of all\r\nwarnings, perhaps supplemented by sufferings, the practice will often\r\nbe continued, producing in the end the most lamentable results. Too\r\noften it is the case that this reluctance to obey the dictates of\r\nNature's laws is the result of the unfeeling and unreasonable demands\r\nof a selfish husband.\r\n\r\nShaker Views.--The Shakers do not, as many suppose, believe wholly in\r\ncelibacy. They believe in marriage and reproduction regulated by the\r\nnatural law. They, also, would limit population, but not by interfering\r\nwith nature; rather, by following nature's indications to the very\r\nletter. They believe \"that no animals should use their reproductive\r\npowers and organs for any other than the simple purpose of procreation.\"\r\nRecognizing the fact that this is the law among lower animals, they\r\ninsist upon applying it to man. Thus they find no necessity for the\r\nemployment of those abominable contrivances so common among those who\r\ndisregard the laws of nature. Who will not respect the purity which\r\nmust characterize sexual relations so governed? Such a method for\r\nregulating the number of offspring is in immense contrast with that\r\nof the Oneida Community, which opens the door to the unstinted\r\ngratification of lust, separates the reproductive act entirely from\r\nits original purpose, and makes it the means of mere selfish, sensual,\r\nbeastly--worse than brutish--gratification.\r\n\r\nThose who are acquainted with the history of the founder of this\r\ncommunity are obliged to look upon him as a scheming sensualist who\r\nwell knows the truth, but deliberately chooses a course of evil, and\r\nbeguiles into his snares others as sensual as himself. The abominations\r\npracticed among the members of the community which he has founded are\r\nrepresented by those who have had an inside view of its workings as\r\ntoo foul to mention. It seems almost wonderful that Providence does\r\nnot lay upon this gigantic brothel his hand of vengeance as in ancient\r\ntimes he did upon Sodom, which could hardly have been more sunken in\r\ninfamy than is this den of licentiousness. It is, indeed, astonishing\r\nthat it should be tolerated in the midst of a country which professes\r\nto regard virtue and respect the marriage institution. We are glad to\r\nnote that popular opinion is calling loudly for the eradication of this\r\nfoul ulcer. Only a short time ago a convention of more than fifty\r\nministers met at Syracuse, N. Y., for the express purpose of considering\r\nways and means for the removal of this blot \"by legal measures or\r\notherwise.\" We sincerely wish them success; and it appears to us that\r\nthe people in that vicinity would be justified should they rise _en\r\nmasse_ and purge their community of an evil so heinous, in case no civil\r\nauthority can be induced to do the work of expurgation.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Just as this edition is going to press we receive the\r\ngratifying information that the younger members of the Community have\r\nbecome disgusted with their sensual life and announced that their\r\nformer vile practices will be discontinued. Mr. Noyes with a few\r\nfollowers has sought refuge in Canada.--J. H. K.]\r\n\r\nMoral Bearings of the Question.--Most of the considerations presented\r\nthus far have been of a physical character, though occasional\r\nreferences to the moral aspect of the question have been made. In a\r\ncertain sense--and a true one--the question is wholly a moral one; for\r\nwhat moral right have men or women to do that which will injure the\r\nintegrity of the physical organism given them, and for which they are\r\naccountable to their Creator? Surely none; for the man who destroys\r\nhimself by degrees, is no less a murderer than he who cuts his throat\r\nor puts a bullet through his brain. The crime is the same--being the\r\nshortening of human life--whether the injury is done to one's self or\r\nto another. In this matter, there are at least three sufferers; the\r\nhusband, the wife, and the offspring, though in most cases, doubtless,\r\nthe husband is the one to whom the sin almost exclusively belongs.\r\n\r\nUnconsidered Murders.--But there is a more startling phase of this\r\nmoral question. It is not impossible to show that actual violence is\r\ndone to a human life.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously shown that in the two elements, the ovum of the\r\nfemale, and the spermatozoon of the male, are, in rudimentary form,\r\nall the elements which go to make up the \"human form divine.\" Alone,\r\nneither of these elements can become anything more than it already is;\r\nbut the instant that the two elements come in contact, fecundation takes\r\nplace, and the individual life begins. From that moment until maturity\r\nis reached, years subsequently, the whole process is only one of\r\ndevelopment. Nothing absolutely new is added at any subsequent moment.\r\nIn view of these facts, it is evident that at the very instant of\r\nconception the embryonic human being possesses all the right to life\r\nit ever can possess. It is just as much an individual, a distinct human\r\nbeing, possessed of soul and body, as it ever is, though in a very\r\nimmature form. That conception may take place during the reproductive\r\nact cannot be denied. If, then, means are employed with a view to prevent\r\nconception immediately after the accomplishment of the act, or at any\r\nsubsequent time, if successful, it would be by destroying the delicate\r\nproduct of the conception which had already occurred, and which, as\r\nbefore observed, is as truly a distinct individual as it can ever\r\nbecome--certainly as independent as at any time previous to birth.\r\n\r\nIs it immoral to take human life? Is it a sin to kill a child? Is it\r\na crime to strangle an infant at birth? Is it a murderous act to destroy\r\na half-formed human being in its mother's womb? Who will dare to answer\r\n\"No,\" to one of these questions? Then, who can refuse assent to the\r\nplain truth that it is equally a murder to deprive of life the most\r\nrecent product of the generative act?\r\n\r\nWho can number the myriads of murders that have been perpetrated at\r\nthis early period of existence? Who can estimate the load of guilt that\r\nweighs upon some human souls? and who knows how many brilliant lights\r\nhave been thus early extinguished? how many promising human plantlets\r\nthus ruthlessly destroyed in the very act of germinating? It is to be\r\nhoped that in the final account the extenuating influence of ignorance\r\nmay weigh heavily in the scale of justice against the damning testimony\r\nof these \"unconsidered murders.\"\r\n\r\nThe Charge Disputed.--It will be urged that these early destructions\r\nare not murders. Murder is an awful word. The act itself is a terrible\r\ncrime. No wonder that its personal application should be studiously\r\navoided; the human being who would not shrink from such a charge would\r\nbe unworthy of the name of human--a very brute. Nevertheless, it is\r\nnecessary to look the plain facts squarely in the face, and shrink not\r\nfrom the decision of an enlightened conscience. We quote the following\r\nportions of an extract which we give in full elsewhere; it is from the\r\nsame distinguished authority[27] whom we have frequently quoted:--\r\n\r\n\"There is, in fact, no moment after conception when it can be said that\r\nthe child has not life, and the crime of destroying human life is as\r\nheinous and as sure before the period of 'quickening' has been attained,\r\nas afterward. But you still defend your horrible deed by saying: 'Well,\r\nif there be, as you say, this mere animal life, equivalent at the most\r\nto simple vitality, there is no mind, no soul destroyed, and, therefore,\r\nthere is no crime committed.' Just so surely as one would destroy and\r\nroot out of existence all the fowls in the world by destroying all the\r\neggs in existence, so certain is it that you do by your act destroy\r\nthe animal man in the egg and the soul which animates it.... Murder\r\nis always sinful, and murder is the willful destruction of a human being\r\nat any period of its existence, from its earliest germinal embryo to\r\nits final, simple, animal existence in aged decrepitude and complete\r\nmental imbecility.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Gardner.]\r\n\r\nDifficulties.--Married people will exclaim, \"What shall we do?\"\r\nDelicate mothers who have already more children on their hands than\r\nthey can care for, whose health is insufficient to longer endure the\r\npains and burdens of pregnancy, but whose sensual husbands continue\r\nto demand indulgence, will echo in despairing tones, while\r\nacknowledging the truth, \"What shall _we_ do?\" We will answer the\r\nquestion for the latter first.\r\n\r\nMr. Mill, the distinguished English logician, in his work on \"The\r\nSubjection of Woman,\" thus represents the erroneous view which is\r\npopularly held of the sexual relations of the wife to the husband: \"The\r\nwife, however brutal a tyrant she may be chained to--though she may\r\nknow that he hates her, though it may be his daily pleasure to torture\r\nher, and though she may feel it impossible not to loathe him--he can\r\nclaim from her and enforce the lowest degradation of a human being,\r\nthat of being made the instrument of an animal function contrary to\r\nher inclinations.\"\r\n\r\nWoman's Rights.--A woman does not, upon the performance of the marriage\r\nceremony, surrender all her personal rights. The law recognizes this\r\nfact if her husband beats her, or in any way injures her by physical\r\nforce, or even by neglect. Why may she not claim protection from other\r\nmaltreatment as well? or, at least, why may she not refuse to lend\r\nherself to beastly lust? She remains the proprietor of her own body,\r\nthough married; and who is so lost to all sense of justice, equity,\r\nand even morality, as to claim that she is under any moral obligation\r\nto allow her body to be abused?\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of this work was published, we have many times\r\nbeen appealed to by suffering wives in the most pathetic terms. In many\r\ninstances the poor wife was suffering with local disease of a serious\r\ncharacter, making sexual approaches in the highest degree painful as\r\nwell as repugnant; yet notwithstanding this, the demands of the husband\r\nfor the gratification of his bestial passions were, in many instances,\r\nin no degree lessened by a knowledge of the facts in the case.\r\n\r\nIn cases like these it is often a very delicate and exceedingly\r\ndifficult task to point out the duty of the suffering wife and mother.\r\nThe duty of the husband is very plain, and to him the wise physician\r\nwill appeal in a manner which cannot fail to arouse him to a sense of\r\nhis duty if there is yet left unconsumed by the fires of lust even a\r\nvestige of genuine manhood.\r\n\r\nWhat to Do.--Now to the question as asked by the first parties--married\r\npeople who together seek for a solution of the difficulties arising\r\nfrom an abandonment of all protectives against fecundation. The true\r\nremedy, and the natural one, is doubtless to be found in the suggestion\r\nmade under the heads of \"Continence\" and \"Marital Excesses.\" By a course\r\nof life in accordance with the principles there indicated, all of these\r\nevils and a thousand more would be avoided. There would be less sensual\r\nenjoyment, but more elevated joy. There would be less animal love, but\r\nmore spiritual communion; less grossness, more purity; less\r\ndevelopment of the animal, and a more fruitful soil for the culture\r\nof virtue, holiness, and all the Christian graces.\r\n\r\n\"But such a life would be impossible this side of Heaven.\" A few who\r\nclaim to have tried the experiment think not. The Shakers claim to\r\npractice, as well as teach, such principles; and with the potent aids\r\nto continence previously specified, it might be found less difficult\r\nin realization than in thought.\r\n\r\nA Compromise.--There will be many, the vast majority, perhaps, who will\r\nnot bring their minds to accept the truth which nature seems to teach,\r\nwhich would confine sexual acts to reproduction wholly. Others,\r\nacknowledging the truth, declare \"the spirit willing\" though \"the flesh\r\nis weak.\" Such will inquire, \"Is there not some compromise by means\r\nof which we may escape the greater evils of our present mode of life?\"\r\nSuch may find in the following facts suggestions for a \"better way,\"\r\nif not the _best_ way, though it cannot be recommended as wholly free\r\nfrom dangers, and though it cannot be said of it that it is not an\r\n_unnatural_ way:--\r\n\r\n\"Menstruation in woman indicates an aptitude for impregnation, and this\r\ncondition remains for a period of six or eight days after the entire\r\ncompletion of the flow. During this time only can most women conceive.\r\nAllow twelve days for the onset of the menses to pass by, and the\r\nprobabilities of impregnation are very slight. This act of continence\r\nis healthful, moral, and irreproachable.\"[28]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Gardner.]\r\n\r\nIt should be added to the above that the plan suggested is not absolutely\r\ncertain to secure immunity from conception. The period of abstinence\r\nshould certainly extend from the beginning of menstruation to the\r\nfourteenth day. To secure even reasonable safety, it is necessary to\r\npractice further abstinence for three or four days previous to the\r\nbeginning of the flow.\r\n\r\nMany writers make another suggestion which would certainly be\r\nbeneficial to individual health; viz., that the husband and wife should\r\nhabitually occupy separate beds. Such a practice would undoubtedly\r\nserve to keep the sexual instincts in abeyance. Separate apartments,\r\nor at least the separation of the beds by a curtain, are recommended\r\nby some estimable physicians, who suggest that such a plan would enable\r\nboth parties to conduct their morning ablutions with proper\r\nthoroughness and without sacrificing that natural modesty which\r\noperates so powerfully as a check upon the excessive indulgence of the\r\npassions. Many will think the suggestion a good one and will make a\r\npractical application of it. Sleeping in single beds is reputed to be\r\na European custom of long standing among the higher classes.\r\n\r\nThis subject cannot be concluded better than by the following\r\nquotations from an excellent and able work entitled, \"The Ten Laws of\r\nHealth\"[29]:--\r\n\r\n\"The obvious design of the sexual desire is the reproduction of the\r\nspecies.... The gratification of this passion, or indeed of any other,\r\nbeyond its legitimate end, is an undoubted violation of natural law,\r\nas may be determined by the light of nature, and by the resulting moral\r\nand physical evils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those creatures not gifted with erring reason, but with unerring\r\ninstinct, and that have not the liberty of choice between good and evil,\r\ncohabit only at stated periods, when pleasure and reproduction are\r\nalike possible. It is so ordered among them that the means and the end\r\nare never separated; and as it was the all-wise Being who endowed them\r\nwith this instinct, without the responsibility resulting from the power\r\nto act otherwise, it follows that it is HIS LAW, and must, therefore,\r\nbe the true copy for all beings to follow having the same functions\r\nto perform, and for the same end. The mere fact that men and women have\r\nthe power and liberty of conforming or not conforming to this copy does\r\nnot set them free from obedience to a right course, nor from the\r\nconsequences of disobedience.\"\r\n\r\n\"The end of sexual pleasure being to reproduce the species, it follows,\r\nfrom the considerations just advanced, that when the sexual function\r\nis diverted from its end, reproduction, or if the means be used when\r\nthe end is impossible, harm or injury should ensue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the number is not small of those who think there is nothing\r\nwrong in an unlimited indulgence of the sexual propensity during\r\nmarried life. The marriage vow seems to be taken as equivalent to the\r\nfreest license, about which there need be no restraint. Yet, if there\r\nis any truth in the law in reference to the enjoyment of the means only\r\nwhen the end is possible, the necessity of the limitation of this\r\nindulgence during married life is clearly as great as for that of any\r\nother sensual pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"A great majority of those constituting the most highly civilized\r\ncommunities, act upon the belief that anything not forbidden by sacred\r\nor civil law is neither sinful nor wrong. They have not found\r\ncohabitation during pregnancy forbidden; nor have they ever had their\r\nattention drawn to the injury to health and organic development, which\r\nsuch a practice inflicts. Hence, a habitual yielding to inclination\r\nin this matter has determined their life-long behavior.\r\n\r\n\"The infringement of this law in the married state does not produce\r\nin the husband any very serious disorder. Debility, aches, cramps, and\r\na tendency to epileptic seizures, are sometimes seen as the effects\r\nof great excess. An evil of no small account is the steady growth of\r\nthe sexual passion by habitual unrestraint. It is in this way that what\r\nis known as libidinous blood is nursed as well among those who are\r\nstrictly virtuous, in the ordinary meaning of the term, as among those\r\nwho are promiscuous in their intercourse.\r\n\r\n\"The wife and the offspring are the chief sufferers by the violation\r\nof this law among the married. Why this is so, may in part be accounted\r\nfor by the following consideration: Among the animal kind it is the\r\nfemale which decides when the approaches of the male are allowable.\r\nWhen these are untimely, her instinctive prompting leads her to resist\r\nand protect herself with ferocious zeal. No one at all acquainted with\r\nthe remarkable wisdom nature invariably displays in all her operations,\r\nwill doubt that the prohibition of all sexual intercourse among animals\r\nduring the period of pregnancy must be for a wise and good purpose.\r\nAnd, if it serves a wise and good purpose with them, why should an\r\nopposite course not serve an unwise and bad purpose with us? Our bodies\r\nare very much like theirs in structure and in function; and in the mode\r\nand laws that govern reproduction there is absolutely no difference.\r\nThe mere fact that we possess the power to act otherwise than they do\r\nduring that period, does not make it right.\r\n\r\n\"Human beings having no instinctive prompting as to what is right and\r\nwhat is wrong, cohabitation, like many other points of the behavior,\r\nis left for reason or the will to determine; or, rather, as things now\r\nare to unreason; for reason is neither consulted nor enlightened as\r\nto what is proper and allowable in the matter. Nature's rule, by\r\ninstinct, makes it devolve upon the female to determine when the\r\napproaches of the male are allowable.\r\n\r\n\"But some may say that she is helpless in the matter. No one dare to\r\napproach her without consent before marriage; and why should man not\r\nbe educated up to the point of doing the same after marriage? She is\r\nneither his slave, nor his property; nor does the tie of marriage bind\r\nher to carry out any unnatural requirement.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: J. R. Black, M.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANTICIDE AND ABORTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew but medical men are aware of the enormous proportions which have\r\nbeen assumed by these terrible crimes during the present century. That\r\nthey are increasing with fearful rapidity and have really reached such\r\na magnitude as to seriously affect the growth of civilized nations,\r\nand to threaten their very existence, has become a patent fact to\r\nobserving physicians. The crime itself differs little, in reality, from\r\nthat considered in the last section, the prevention of conception. It\r\nis, in fact, the same crime postponed till a later period.\r\n\r\nWe quote the following eloquent words on this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"Of all the sins, physical and moral against man and God, I know of\r\nnone so utterly to be condemned as the very common one of the destruction\r\nof the child while yet in the womb of the mother. So utterly repugnant\r\nis it that I can scarcely express the loathing with which I approach\r\nthe subject. Murder!--murder in cold blood, without cause, of an\r\nunknown child; one's nearest relative; in fact, part of one's very\r\nbeing; actually having, not only one's own blood in its being, but that\r\nblood momentarily interchanging! Good God! Does it seem possible that\r\nsuch depravity can exist in a parent's breast--in a mother's heart!\r\n\r\n\"'Tis for no wrong that it has committed that its sweet life is so\r\ncruelly taken away. Its coming is no disgrace; its creation was not\r\nin sin, but--its mother 'don't want to be bothered with any more brats;\r\ncan hardly take care of what she has got; is going to Europe in the\r\nspring.'\r\n\r\n\"We can forgive the poor deluded girl--seduced, betrayed,\r\nabandoned--who, in her wild frenzy, destroys the mute evidence of her\r\nguilt. We have only sympathy and sorrow for her. But for the married\r\nshirk who disregards her divinely-ordained duty, we have nothing but\r\ncontempt, even if she be the lordly woman of fashion, clothed in purple\r\nand fine linen. If glittering gems adorn her person, within there is\r\nfoulness and squalor.\"[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Gardner.]\r\n\r\nNot a Modern Crime.--Although this crime has attained remarkable\r\nproportions in modern times, it is not a new one by any means, as the\r\nfollowing paragraph will suffice to show:--\r\n\r\n\"Infanticide and exposure were also the custom among the Romans, Medes,\r\nCanaanites, Babylonians, and other Eastern nations, with the exception\r\nof the Israelites and Egyptians. The Scandinavians killed their\r\noffspring from pure fantasy. The Norwegians, after having carefully\r\nswaddled their children, put some food into their mouths, placed them\r\nunder the roots of trees or under the rocks to preserve them from\r\nferocious beasts. Infanticide was also permitted among the Chinese,\r\nand we saw, during the last century, vehicles going round the streets\r\nof Pekin daily to collect the bodies of the dead infants. To-day there\r\nexist foundling hospitals to receive children abandoned by their\r\nparents. The same custom is also observed in Japan, in the isles of\r\nthe Southern Ocean, at Otaheite, and among several savage nations of\r\nNorth America. It is related of the Jaggers of Guinea, that they devour\r\ntheir own children.\"[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Burdach.]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks practiced infanticide systematically, their laws at one time\r\nrequiring the destruction of crippled or weakly children. Among all\r\nthe various nations, the general object of the crime seems to have been\r\nto avoid the trouble of rearing the children, or to avoid a surplus,\r\nobjects not far different from those had in view by those who practice\r\nthe same crimes at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the child after the mother has felt its movements\r\nis termed infanticide; before that time it is commonly known as abortion.\r\nIt is a modern notion that the child possesses no soul or individual\r\nlife until the period of quickening, an error which we have already\r\nsufficiently exposed. The ancients, with just as much reason, contended\r\nthat no distinct life was present until after birth. Hence it was that\r\nthey could practice without scruple the crime of infanticide to prevent\r\ntoo great increase of population. \"Plato and Aristotle were advocates\r\nof this practice, and these Stoics justified this monstrous practice\r\nby alleging that the child only acquired a soul at the moment when it\r\nceased to have uterine life and commenced to respire. From hence it\r\nresulted that, the child not being animated, its destruction was no\r\nmurder.\"\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of this crime will be indicated by the following\r\nobservations from the most reliable sources:--\r\n\r\n\"We know that in certain countries abortion is practiced in a manner\r\nalmost public, without speaking of the East, where it has, so to speak,\r\nentered into the manners of the country. We see it in America, in a\r\ngreat city like New York, constituting a regular business and not\r\nprevented, where it has enriched more than one midwife.\"\r\n\r\n\"England does not yield to Germany or France in the frequency of the\r\ncrime of infanticide.\"[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Jardien.]\r\n\r\n\"Any statistics attainable are very incomplete. False certificates are\r\ndaily given by attending physicians. Men, if they are only rich enough,\r\ndie of 'congestion of the brain,' not 'delirium tremens;' and women,\r\nsimilarly situated, do not die from the effects of abortion, but of\r\n'inflammation of the bowels,' etc.\"\r\n\r\n\"Infanticide, as it is generally considered (destroying a child after\r\nquickening), is of very rare occurrence in New York, whereas abortions\r\n(destroying the embryo before quickening) are of daily habit in the\r\nfamilies of the best informed and most religious; among those abounding\r\nin wealth, as well as among the poor and needy.\"[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Gardner.]\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps only medical men will credit the assertion that the frequency\r\nof this form of destroying human life exceeds all others by at least\r\nfifty per cent, and that not more than one in a thousand of the guilty\r\nparties receive any punishment by the hand of civil law. But there is\r\na surer mode of punishment for the guilty mother in the self-executing\r\nlaws of nature.\"[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Black.]\r\n\r\n\"From a very large verbal and written correspondence in this and other\r\nStates, I am satisfied that we have become _a nation of murderers_.\"[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Reamy.]\r\n\r\nSaid a distinguished clergyman of Brooklyn in a sermon, \"Why send\r\nmissionaries to India when child-murder is here of daily, almost hourly,\r\noccurrence; aye, when the hand that puts money into the\r\ncontribution-box to-day, yesterday or a month ago, or to-morrow, will\r\nmurder her own unborn offspring?\r\n\r\n\"The Hindoo mother, when she abandons her babe upon the sacred Ganges,\r\nis, contrary to her heart, obeying a supposed religious law, and you\r\ndesire to convert her to your own worship of the Moloch of Fashion and\r\nLaziness and love of Greed. Out upon such hypocrisy!\"\r\n\r\nWriters tell us that it has even become the boast of many women that\r\nthey \"know too much to have babies.\"\r\n\r\nSays the learned Dr. Storer, \"Will the time come, think ye, when\r\nhusbands can no longer, as they now frequently do, commit the crime\r\nof rape upon their unwilling wives, and persuade them or compel them\r\nto allow a still more dreadful violence to be wreaked upon the children\r\nnestling within them--children fully alive from the very moment of\r\nconception, that have already been fully detached from all organic\r\nconnection with their parent, and only re-attached to her for the\r\npurposes of nutriment and growth, and to destroy whom 'is a crime of\r\nthe same nature, both against our Maker and society, as to destroy an\r\ninfant, a child, or a man?'\"[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: \"Is It I?\"]\r\n\r\nSays another well-known author, \"Ladies boast to each other of the\r\nimpunity with which they have aborted, as they do of their expenditures,\r\nof their dress, of their success in society. There is a fashion in this,\r\nas in all other female customs, good and bad. The wretch whose account\r\nwith the Almighty is heaviest with guilt too often becomes a\r\nheroine.\"[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: A Woman's Thoughts about Women.]\r\n\r\nCauses of the Crime.--Many influences may combine to cause the mother\r\nruthlessly to destroy her helpless child: as, to conceal the results\r\nof sin; to avoid the burdens of maternity; to secure ease and freedom\r\nto travel, etc., or even from a false idea that maternity is vulgar;\r\nbut it is true, beyond all question, that the primary cause of the sin\r\nis far back of all these influences. The most unstinted and scathing\r\ninvectives are used in characterizing the criminality of a mother who\r\ntakes the life of her unborn babe; but a word is seldom said of the\r\none who forced upon her the circumstances which gave the unfortunate\r\none existence. Though doctors, ministers, and moralists have said much\r\non this subject, and written more, it is reasonable to suppose that\r\nthey will never accomplish much of anything in the direction of reform\r\nuntil they recognize the part the man acts in all of these sad cases,\r\nand begin to demand reform where it is most needed, and where its\r\nachievement will effect the most good. As was observed in the remarks\r\nupon the subject of \"Prevention of Conception,\" this evil has its origin\r\nin \"marital excesses,\" and in a disregard of the natural law which makes\r\nthe female the sole proprietor of her own body, and gives to her the\r\nright to refuse the approaches of the male when unprepared to receive\r\nthem without doing violence to the laws of her being.\r\n\r\nThe Nature of the Crime.--\"The married and well-to-do, who by means\r\nof medicines and operations produce abortions at early periods of\r\npregnancy, have no excuse except the pretense that they do not consider\r\nit murder until the child quickens.\r\n\r\n\"No, not murder, you say, for 'there has not been any life in the child.'\r\nDo not attempt to evade, even to man, a crime which cannot be hidden\r\nfrom the All-seeing. The poor mother has not herself felt the life of\r\nthe child perhaps, but that is a quibble only of the laws of man, founded\r\nindeed upon the view, now universally recognized as incorrect, that\r\nthe child's life began when its movements were first strong enough to\r\nbe perceptible. There is, in fact, no moment after conception when it\r\ncan be said that the child has not life, and the crime of destroying\r\nhuman life is as heinous and as sure before the period of 'quickening'\r\nhas been attained as afterward. But you still defend your horrible deed\r\nby saying, 'Well, if there be, as you say, this mere animal life,\r\nequivalent at the most to simple vitality, there is no mind, no soul\r\ndestroyed, and therefore, there is no crime committed.' Just so surely\r\nas one would destroy and root out of existence all the fowl in the world\r\nby destroying all the eggs in existence, so certain is it that you do\r\nby your act destroy the animal man in the egg, and the soul which\r\nanimates it. When is the period that intelligence comes to the infant?\r\nAre its feeble first strugglings any evidence of its presence? Has it\r\nany appreciable quantity at birth? Has it any valuable, useful quantity\r\neven when a year old? When, then, is it, that destruction is harmless\r\nor comparatively sinless? While awaiting your metaphysical answer, I\r\nwill tell you when it is sinful. Murder is always sinful, and murder\r\nis the willful destruction of a human being at any period of its\r\nexistence, from its earliest germinal embryo to its final, simple,\r\nanimal existence in aged decrepitude and complete mental\r\nimbecility.\"[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Gardner.]\r\n\r\n\"There are those who would fain make light of this crime by attempting\r\nto convince themselves and others that a child, while in embryo, has\r\nonly a sort of vegetative life, not yet endowed with thought, and the\r\nability to maintain an independent existence. If such a monstrous\r\nphilosophy as this presents any justification for such an act, then\r\nthe killing of a newly-born infant, or of an idiot, may be likewise\r\njustified. The destruction of the life of an unborn human being, for\r\nthe reason that it is small, feeble, and innocently helpless, rather\r\naggravates than palliates the crime. Every act of this kind, with its\r\njustification, is obviously akin to that savage philosophy which\r\naccounts it a matter of no moment, or rather a duty, to destroy feeble\r\ninfants, or old, helpless fathers and mothers.\"[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Black.]\r\n\r\nInstruments of Crime.--\"The means through which abortions are effected\r\nare various. Sometimes it is through potent drugs, extensively\r\nadvertised in newspapers claiming to be moral!--the advertisements so\r\nadroitly worded as to convey under a caution the precise information\r\nrequired of the liability of the drug to produce miscarriages.\r\nSometimes the information is conveyed through secret circulars; but\r\nmore commonly the deed is consummated by professed abortionists, who\r\nadvertise themselves as such through innuendo, or through gaining this\r\nkind of repute by the frequent commission of the act. Not a few women,\r\ndeterred by lingering modesty or some sense of shame, attempt and\r\nexecute it upon themselves, and then volunteer to instruct and\r\nencourage others to go and do likewise.\"[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Black.]\r\n\r\nResults of this Unnatural Crime.--It is the universal testimony of\r\nphysicians that the effects of abortion are almost as deadly upon the\r\nmother as upon the child. The amount of suffering is vastly greater;\r\nfor that of the child, if it suffer at all, is only momentary, in general,\r\nwhile the mother is doomed to a life of suffering, of misery, if she\r\nsurvives the shock of the terrible outrage against her nature. It has\r\nbeen proved by statistics that the danger of immediate death is _fifteen\r\ntimes as great as in natural childbirth_. A medical author of note\r\nasserts that a woman suffers more injury from one abortion than she\r\nwould from twenty normal births. Says Dr. Gardner on this point:--\r\n\r\n\"We know that the popular idea is that women are worn out by the toil\r\nand wear connected with the raising of large families, and we can\r\nwillingly concede something to this statement; but it is certainly far\r\nmore observable that the efforts at the present day, made to avoid\r\npropagation, are ten thousand-fold more disastrous to the health and\r\nconstitution, to say nothing of the demoralization of mind and heart,\r\nwhich cannot be estimated by red cheeks or physical vigor.\"\r\n\r\nAn Unwelcome Child.--But suppose the mother does not succeed in her\r\nattempts against the life of her child, as she may not; what fearful\r\nresults may follow! Who can doubt that the murderous intent of the\r\nmother will be stamped indelibly upon the character of the unwelcome\r\nchild, giving it a natural propensity for the commission of murderous\r\ndeeds?\r\n\r\nThen again--sickening thought--suppose the attempts to destroy the\r\nchild are unsuccessful, resulting only in horrid mutilation of its\r\ntender form; when such a child is born, what terrible evidences may\r\nit bear in its crippled and misshapen body of the cruel outrage\r\nperpetrated upon it! That such cases do occur is certain from the\r\nfollowing narrative, which we might confirm by others similar in\r\ncharacter:--\r\n\r\n\"A lady, determined not to have any more children, went to a professed\r\nabortionist, and he attempted to effect the desired end by violence.\r\nWith a pointed instrument the attempt was again and again made, but\r\nwithout the looked-for result. So vigorously was the effort made, that,\r\nastonished at no result being obtained, the individual stated that\r\nthere must be some mistake, that the lady could not be pregnant, and\r\nrefused to perform any further operations. Partially from doubt and\r\npartially from fear, nothing further was attempted; and in due process\r\nof time the woman was delivered of an infant, shockingly mutilated,\r\nwith one eye entirely put out, and the brain so injured that this\r\notherwise robust child was entirely wanting in ordinary sense. This\r\npoor mother, it would seem, needs no future punishment for her sin.\r\nTen years face to face with this poor idiot, whose imbecility was her\r\ndirect work--has it not punished her sufficiently?\"\r\n\r\nThe Remedy.--Whether this gigantic evil can ever be eradicated, is\r\nexceedingly doubtful. To effect its cure would be to make refined\r\nChristians out of brutal sensualists; to emancipate woman from the\r\nenticing, alluring slavery of fashion; to uproot false ideas of life\r\nand its duties,--in short, to revolutionize society. The crime is\r\nperpetrated in secret. Many times no one but the criminal herself is\r\ncognizant of the evil deed. Only occasionally do cases come near enough\r\nto the surface to be dimly discernible; hence the evident inefficiency\r\nof any civil legislation. But the evil is a desperate one, and is\r\nincreasing; shall no attempt be made to check the tide of crime and\r\nsave the sufferers from both physical and spiritual perdition? An\r\neffort should be made, at least. Let every Christian raise the note\r\nof warning. From every Christian pulpit let the truth be spoken in terms\r\ntoo plain for misapprehension. Let those who are known to be guilty\r\nof this most revolting crime be looked upon as murderers, as they are;\r\nand let their real moral status be distinctly shown.\r\n\r\nAll of these means will do something to effect a reform; but the radical\r\ncure of the evil will only be found in the principles suggested in the\r\nsection devoted to the consideration of \"Marital Excesses.\" The\r\nadoption of those principles and strict adherence to them would\r\neffectually prevent the occurrence of circumstances which are the\r\noccasion of abortions and infanticides.\r\n\r\nMurder by Proxy.--\"There is, at the present time, a kind of infanticide,\r\nwhich, although it is not so well known, is even more dangerous, because\r\ndone with impunity. There are parents who recoil with horror at the\r\nidea of destroying their offspring, although they would greatly desire\r\nto be disembarrassed of them, who yet place them without remorse with\r\nnurses who enjoy the sinister reputation of never returning the\r\nchildren to those who have intrusted them to their care. These\r\nunfortunate little beings are condemned to perish from inanition and\r\nbad treatment.\r\n\r\n\"The number of these innocent victims is greater than would be imagined,\r\nand very certainly exceeds that of the marked infanticides sent by the\r\npublic prosecutor to the Court of the Assizes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL EVIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllicit intercourse has been a foul blot upon humanity from the earliest\r\nperiods of history. At the present moment, it is a loathsome ulcer\r\neating at the heart of civilization, a malignant leprosy which shows\r\nits hideous deformities among the fairest results of modern culture.\r\nOur large cities abound with dens of vice whose _habitues_ shamelessly\r\npromenade the most public streets and flaunt their infamy in the face\r\nof every passer-by. In many large cities, especially in those of\r\nContinental Europe, these holds of vice are placed under the\r\nsupervision of the law by the requirement that every keeper of a house\r\nof prostitution must pay for a license; in other words, must buy the\r\nright to lead his fellow-men \"down to the depths of hell.\"\r\n\r\nIn smaller cities, as well as in large ones, in fact, from the great\r\nmetropolis down to the country village, the haunts of vice are found.\r\nEvery army is flanked by bands of courtesans. Wherever men go, loose\r\nwomen follow, penetrating even to the wildness of the miner's camp,\r\nfar beyond the verge of civilization.\r\n\r\nBut brothels and traveling strumpets do not fully represent the vast\r\nextent of this monster evil. There is a class of immoral women--probably\r\nexceeding in numbers the grosser class just referred to--who consider\r\nthemselves respectable; indeed, who are considered very respectable.\r\nFew are acquainted with their character. They live in elegant style\r\nand mingle in genteel society. Privately, they prosecute the most\r\nunbounded licentiousness, for the purpose of gain, or merely to gratify\r\ntheir lewdness. \"Kept mistresses\" are much more numerous than common\r\nprostitutes.\r\n\r\nThe numerous scandal and divorce suits which expose the infidelity of\r\nhusbands and wives, are sufficient evidence that illicit commerce is\r\nnot confined to the unmarried; but so many are the facilities for\r\ncovering and preventing the results of sins of this description it is\r\nimpossible to form any just estimate of their frequency. The\r\nincontinence of husbands and the unchastity of wives will only appear\r\nin their enormity at that awful day when every one shall \"stand before\r\nthe judgment-seat\" and hear the penalty of his guilty deeds.\r\n\r\nUnchastity of the Ancients.--We are prone to believe that the present\r\nis the most licentious age the world has ever known; that in the\r\nnineteenth century the climax of evil has been reached; that the\r\nlibidinous blood of all the ages has culminated to produce a race of\r\nmen more carnal than all predecessors. It is a sickening thought that\r\nany previous epoch could have been more vile than this; but history\r\npresents facts which disclose in ancient times periods when lust was\r\neven more uncontrolled than now; when vice was universal; and when\r\nvirtue was a thing unknown. A few references to historical facts will\r\nestablish this point. We do not make these allusions in any way to\r\njustify the present immorality, but to show the part which vice has\r\nacted in the overthrow of nations.\r\n\r\nFrom the sacred record we may judge that before the flood a state of\r\ncorruption prevailed which was even greater and more general than any\r\nthat has ever since been reached; only eight persons were fit to survive\r\nthe calamity which swept into eternity that lustful generation with\r\ntheir filthy deeds.\r\n\r\nBut men soon fell into vice again, for we find among the early Assyrians\r\na total disregard of chastity. Her kings reveled in the grossest\r\nsensuality.\r\n\r\nNo excess of vice could surpass the licentiousness of the Ptolemies,\r\nwho made of Alexandria a bagnio, and all Egypt a hot-bed of vice.\r\nHerodotus relates that \"the pyramid of Cheops was built by the lovers\r\nof the daughter of this king; and that she never would have raised this\r\nmonument to such a height except by multiplying her prostitutions.\"\r\nHistory also relates the adventures of that queenly courtesan,\r\nCleopatra, who captivated and seduced by her charms two masters of the\r\nworld, and whose lewdness surpassed even her beauty.\r\n\r\nTyre and Sidon, Media, Phoenicia, Syria, and all the Orient, were sunk\r\nin sensuality. Fornication was made a part of their worship. Women\r\ncarried through the streets of the cities the most obscene and revolting\r\nrepresentations. Among all these nations a virtuous woman was not to\r\nbe found; for, according to Herodotus, the young women were by the laws\r\nof the land \"obliged, once in their lives, to give themselves up to\r\nthe desires of strangers in the temple of Venus, and were not permitted\r\nto refuse anyone.\"[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Bourgeois.]\r\n\r\nSt. Augustine speaks of these religious debaucheries as still practiced\r\nin his day in Phoenicia. They were even continued until Constantine\r\ndestroyed the temples in which they were prosecuted, in the fourth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks the same corruptions prevailed in the worship of\r\nBacchus and Phallus, which was celebrated by processions of half-nude\r\ngirls \"performing lascivious dances with men disguised as satyrs.\" In\r\nfact, as X. Bourgeois says, \"Prostitution was in repute in Greece.\"\r\nThe most distinguished women were courtesans, and the wise Socrates\r\nwould be justly called, in modern times, a libertine.\r\n\r\nThe abandonment to lust was, if possible, still more complete in the\r\ntimes of the Roman emperors. Rome astonished the universe \"by the\r\nboldness of its turpitudes, after having astonished it by the splendor\r\nof its triumphs.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Caesar was such a rake that he has been said to have \"merited\r\nto be surnamed every woman's husband.\" Antony and Augustus were equally\r\nnotorious. The same sensuality pervaded the masses as reigned in the\r\ncourts, and was stimulated by the erotic poems of Ovid, Catullus, and\r\nother poets of the time.\r\n\r\nTiberius displayed such ingenuity in inventing refinements in\r\nimpudicity that it was necessary to coin new words to designate them.\r\nCaligula committed the horrid crime of incest with all his sisters,\r\neven in public. His palace was a brothel. The Roman empress, Messalina,\r\ndisguised herself as a prostitute and excelled the most degraded\r\ncourtesans in her monstrous debaucheries. The Roman emperor Vitellius\r\nwas accustomed to take an emetic after having eaten to repletion, to\r\nenable him to renew his gluttony. With still grosser sensuality he\r\nstimulated his satiated passions with philters and various aphrodisiac\r\nmixtures.\r\n\r\nNero, the most infamous of the emperors, committed rapes on the stage\r\nof the public theaters of Rome, disguised as a wild beast.\r\n\r\nIf this degraded voluptuousness had been confined to royalty, some\r\nrespect might yet be entertained for the virtue of the ancients; but\r\nthe foul infection was not restrained within such narrow bounds. It\r\ninvaded whole empires until they fell in pieces from very rottenness.\r\nWhat must have been the condition of a nation that could tolerate such\r\na spectacle as its monarch riding through the streets of its metropolis\r\nin a state of nudity, drawn by women in the same condition? Such a deed\r\ndid Heliogabalus in Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, virtue was almost as scarce in France as\r\nin ancient Greece. Nobles held as mistresses all the young girls of\r\ntheir domains. About every fifth person was a bastard. Just before the\r\nRevolution, chastity was such a rarity that a woman was actually obliged\r\nto apologize for being virtuous!\r\n\r\nIn these disgusting facts we find one of the most potent agents in\r\neffecting the downfall of the nations. Licentiousness sapped their\r\nvitality and weakened their prowess. The men who conquered the world\r\nwere led captive by their own beastly passions. Thus the Assyrians,\r\nthe Medes, the Grecians, the Romans, successively fell victims to their\r\nlusts, and gave way to more virtuous successors. Even the Jews, the\r\nmost enlightened people of their age, fell more than once through this\r\nsame sin, which was coupled with idolatry, of which their seduction\r\nby the Midianites is an example.\r\n\r\nSurely, modern times present no worse spectacles of carnality than\r\nthese; and will it be claimed that anything so vile is seen among\r\ncivilized nations at the present day? But though there may be less\r\ngrossness in the sensuality of to-day, the moral turpitude of men may\r\nbe even greater than that of ancient times. Enlightened Christianity\r\nhas raised the standard of morality. Christ's commentary upon the\r\nseventh commandment requires a more rigorous chastity than ancient\r\nstandards demanded, even among the Jews; for had not David, Solomon,\r\nand even the pious Jacob more wives than one? Consequently, a slight\r\nbreach of chastity now requires as great a fall from virtue as a greater\r\nlapse in ages past, and must be attended with as severe a moral penalty.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how universal is the \"social evil,\" that it is a vice almost\r\nas old as man himself, which shows how deeply rooted in his perverted\r\nnature it has become. The inquiry arises, What are the causes of so\r\nmonstrous a vice? so gross an outrage upon nature's laws? so withering\r\na blight upon the race?\r\n\r\nCauses of the \"Social Evil.\"--A vice that has become so great an evil,\r\neven in these enlightened times, as to defy the most skillful\r\nlegislation, which openly displays its gaudy filthiness and mocks at\r\nvirtue with a lecherous stare, must have its origin in causes too\r\npowerful to be ignored.\r\n\r\nLibidinous Blood.--In no other direction are the effects of heredity\r\nto be more distinctly traced than in the transmission of sensual\r\npropensities. The children of libertines are almost certain to be rakes\r\nand prostitutes. History affords numerous examples in illustration of\r\nthis fact. The daughter of Augustus was as unchaste as her father, and\r\nher daughter was as immoral as herself. The sons of David showed evident\r\ntraces of their father's failing. Witness the incest of Amnon, and the\r\nvoluptuousness of Solomon, who had seven hundred wives and three\r\nhundred concubines. Solomon's son was, likewise, a noted polygamist,\r\nof whom the record says, \"He desired many wives.\" His son's son\r\nmanifested the same propensity in taking as many wives as the\r\ndebilitated state of his kingdom enabled him to support. But perhaps\r\nwe may be allowed to trace the origin of this libidinous propensity\r\nstill further back. A glance at the genealogy of David will show that\r\nhe was descended from Judah through Pharez, who was the result of an\r\nincestuous union between Judah and his daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nIs it unreasonable to suppose that the abnormal passion which led David\r\nto commit the most heinous sin of his life in his adultery with\r\nBath-sheba and subsequently procuring the death of her husband, was\r\nreally an hereditary propensity which had come down to him through his\r\nancestors, and which, under more favorable circumstances, was more\r\nfully developed in his sons? The trait may have been kept dormant by\r\nthe active and simple habits of his early years, but asserted itself\r\nin full force under the fostering influence of royal idleness and luxury.\r\nIn accordance with the known laws of heredity, such a tendency would\r\nbe the legitimate result of such a combination of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe influence of marital excesses, and especially sexual indulgence\r\nduring pregnancy, in producing vicious tendencies in offspring, has\r\nbeen fully dwelt upon elsewhere in this work, and will not be\r\nreconsidered here, it being only necessary to call attention to the\r\nsubject. Physiology shows conclusively that thousands of parents whose\r\nsons have become libertines and their daughters courtesans, have\r\nthemselves implanted in their characters the propensity which led to\r\ntheir unchastity.\r\n\r\nGluttony.--As a predisposing cause, the influence of dietetic habits\r\nshould rank next to heredity. It is an observed fact that \"all\r\nlibertines are great eaters or famous gastronomists.\" The exciting\r\ninfluence upon the genital organs of such articles as pepper, mustard,\r\nginger, spices, truffles, wine, and all alcoholic drinks, is well known.\r\nTea and coffee directly excite the animal passions through their\r\ninfluence upon the nerve centers controlling the sexual organs. When\r\nchildren are raised upon such articles, or upon food with which they\r\nare thoroughly mingled, what wonder that they occasionally \"turn out\r\nbad\"? How many mothers, while teaching their children the principles\r\nof virtue in the nursery, unwittingly stimulate their passions at the\r\ndinner table until vice becomes almost a physical necessity!\r\n\r\nNothing tends so powerfully to keep the passions in abeyance as a simple\r\ndiet, free from condiments, especially when coupled with a generous\r\namount of exercise.\r\n\r\nThe influence of tobacco in leading to unchastity has been referred\r\nto in another connection. This is assuredly a not uncommon cause. When\r\na boy places the first cigar or quid of tobacco to his lips, he takes--if\r\nhe has not previously done so--the first step in the road to infamy;\r\nand if he adds wine or beer, he takes a short cut to the degradation\r\nof his manhood by the loss of virtue.\r\n\r\nPrecocious Sexuality.--The causes of a too early development of sexual\r\npeculiarities, as manifested in infantile flirtations and early signs\r\nof sexual passion, were dwelt upon quite fully in a previous connection,\r\nand we need not repeat them here. Certain it is that few things can\r\nbe more dangerous to virtue than the premature development of those\r\nsentiments which belong only to puberty and later years. It is a most\r\nunnatural, but not uncommon, sight to see a girl of tender age evincing\r\nall those characters which mark the wanton of older years.\r\n\r\nMan's Lewdness.--It cannot be denied that men are in the greatest degree\r\nresponsible for the \"social evil.\" The general principle holds true\r\nhere as elsewhere that the supply is regulated by the demand. If the\r\npatrons of prostitution should withdraw their support by a sudden\r\nacquisition of virtue, how soon would this vilest of traffics cease!\r\nThe inmates of brothels would themselves become continent, if not\r\nvirtuous, as the result of such a spasm of chastity in men.\r\n\r\nAgain, the ranks of fallen women, which are rapidly thinned by loathsome\r\ndiseases and horrid deaths, are largely recruited from that class of\r\nunfortunates for whose fall faithless lovers or cunning, heartless\r\nlibertines are chiefly responsible. The weak girl who, through too much\r\ntrust, has been deceived and robbed of her dearest treasure, is disowned\r\nby relatives, shunned by her acquaintances, and turned out upon a cold\r\nworld without money, without friends, without a character. What can\r\nshe do? Respectable employment she cannot find, for rumor follows her.\r\nThere seems to be but one door open, the one which she herself so\r\nunintentionally opened. In despair, she enters the \"open road to hell,\"\r\nand to her first sad error adds a life of shame. Meanwhile, the villain\r\nwho betrayed her still maintains his standing in society, and plies\r\nhis arts to win another victim. Is there not an unfair discrimination\r\nhere? Should not the seducer be blackened with an infamy at least as\r\ndeep as that which society casts on the one betrayed?\r\n\r\nFashion.--The temptation of dress, fine clothing, costly jewelry, and\r\nall the extravagances with which rich ladies array themselves, is in\r\nmany cases too powerful for the weakened virtue of poor seamstresses,\r\noperatives, and servant girls, who have seen so much of vice as to have\r\nlost that instinctive loathing for it which they may have once\r\nexperienced. Thinking to gain a life of ease, with means to gratify\r\ntheir love of show, they barter away their peace of mind for this world,\r\nall hope for the next, and only gain a little worthless tinsel, the\r\nscorn of their fellow-creatures, and a host of loathsome diseases.\r\n\r\nLack of Early Training.--It is needless to demonstrate a fact so well\r\nestablished as that the future character of an individual depends very\r\nlargely upon his early training. If purity and modesty are taught from\r\nearliest infancy, the mind is fortified against the assaults of vice.\r\nIf, instead, the child is allowed to grow up untrained, if the seeds\r\nof vice which are sure to fall sooner or later in the most carefully\r\nkept ground are allowed to germinate, if the first buds of evil are\r\nallowed to grow and unfold instead of being promptly nipped, it must\r\nnot be considered remarkable that in later years rank weeds of sin\r\nshould flourish in the soul and bear their hideous fruit in shameless\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nNeglect to guard the avenues by which evil may approach the young mind,\r\nand to erect barriers against vice by careful instruction and a chaste\r\nexample, leaves many innocent souls open to the assaults of evil, and\r\nan easy prey to lust. If children are allowed to get their training\r\nin the street, at the corner grocery, or hovering around saloons, they\r\nwill be sure to develop a vigorous growth of the animal passions. The\r\nfollowing extract is from the writings of one whose pen has been an\r\ninestimable blessing to American youth:--\r\n\r\n\"Among the first lessons which boys learn of their fellows are\r\nimpurities of language; and these are soon followed by impurities of\r\nthought.... When this is the training of boyhood, it is not strange\r\nthat the predominating ideas among young men, in relation to the other\r\nsex, are too often those of impurity and sensuality.... We cannot be\r\nsurprised, then, that the history of most young men is, that they yield\r\nto temptation in a greater or less degree and in different ways. With\r\nmany, no doubt, the indulgence is transient, accidental, and does not\r\nbecome habitual. It does not get to be regarded as venial. It is never\r\nyielded to without remorse. The wish and the purpose are to resist;\r\nbut the animal nature bears down the moral. Still, transgression is\r\nalways followed by grief and penitence.\r\n\r\n\"With too many, however, it is to be feared, it is not so. The mind\r\nhas become debauched by dwelling on licentious images, and by\r\nindulgence in licentious conversation. There is no wish to resist. They\r\nare not overtaken by temptation, for they seek it. With them the\r\ntransgression becomes habitual, and the stain on the character is deep\r\nand lasting.\"[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Ware.]\r\n\r\nSentimental Literature.--In another connection, we have referred\r\nparticularly to the bawdy, obscene books and pictures which are\r\nsecretly circulated among the youth of both sexes, and to their\r\ncorrupting influence. The hope is not entirely a vain one that this\r\nevil may be controlled; but there seems no possible practicable remedy\r\nfor another evil which ultimately leads to the same result, though by\r\nless gross and obscene methods. We refer to the sentimental literature\r\nwhich floods the land. City and school libraries, circulating libraries,\r\nand even Sunday-school libraries, are full of books which, though they\r\nmay contain good moral teaching, contain, as well, an element as\r\nincompatible with purity of morals as is light with midnight darkness.\r\nWriters for children and youth seem to think a tale of \"courtship, love,\r\nand matrimony\" entirely indispensable as a medium for conveying their\r\nmoral instruction. Some of these \"religious novels\" are actually more\r\npernicious than the fictions of well-known novelists who make no\r\npretense to having religious instruction a particular object in view.\r\nSunday-school libraries are not often wholly composed of this class\r\nof works, but any one who takes the trouble to examine the books of\r\nsuch a library will be able to select the most pernicious ones by the\r\nexternal appearance. The covers will be well worn and the edges begrimed\r\nwith dirt from much handling. Children soon tire of the shallow sameness\r\nwhich characterizes the \"moral\" parts of most of these books, and skim\r\nlightly over them, selecting and devouring with eagerness those\r\nportions which relate the silly narrative of some love adventure. This\r\nkind of literature arouses in children premature fancies and queries,\r\nand fosters a sentimentalism which too often occasions most unhappy\r\nresults. Through their influence, young girls are often led to begin\r\na life of shame long before their parents are aware that a thought of\r\nevil has ever entered their minds.\r\n\r\nThe following words from the pen of a forcible writer[43] present this\r\nmatter in none too strong a light:--\r\n\r\n\"You may tear your coat or break a vase, and repair them again; but\r\nthe point where the rip or fracture took place will always be evident.\r\nIt takes less than an hour to do your heart a damage which no time can\r\nentirely repair. Look carefully over your child's library; see what\r\nbook it is that he reads after he has gone to bed, with the gas turned\r\nupon the pillow. Do not always take it for granted that a book is good\r\nbecause it is a Sunday-school book. As far as possible, know _who_ wrote\r\nit, who illustrated it, who published it, who sold it.\r\n\r\n\"It seems that in the literature of the day the ten plagues of Egypt\r\nhave returned, and the frogs and lice have hopped and skipped over our\r\nparlor tables.\r\n\r\n\"Parents are delighted to have their children read, but they should\r\nbe sure as to what they read. You do not have to walk a day or two in\r\nan infested district to get the cholera or typhoid fever; and one wave\r\nof moral unhealth will fever and blast the soul forever. Perhaps,\r\nknowing not what you did, you read a bad book. Do you not remember it\r\naltogether? Yes! and perhaps you will never get over it. However strong\r\nand exalted your character, never read a bad book. By the time you get\r\nthrough the first chapter you will see the drift. If you find the marks\r\nof the hoofs of the devil in the pictures, or in the style, or in the\r\nplot, away with it.\r\n\r\n\"But there is more danger, I think, from many of the family papers,\r\npublished once a week, in those stories of vice and shame, full of\r\ninfamous suggestions, going as far as they can without exposing\r\nthemselves to the clutch of the law. I name none of them; but say that\r\non some fashionable tables there lie 'family newspapers' that are the\r\nvery vomit of the pit.\r\n\r\n\"The way to ruin is cheap. It costs three dollars to go to Philadelphia;\r\nsix dollars to Boston; thirty-three dollars to Savannah; but, by the\r\npurchase of a bad paper for ten cents you may get a through ticket to\r\nhell, by express, with few stopping places, and the final halting like\r\nthe tumbling of the lightning train down the draw-bridge at\r\nNorwalk--sudden, terrific, deathful, never to rise.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: T. De Witt Talmage.]\r\n\r\nPoverty.--The pressing influence of poverty has been urged as one cause\r\nof prostitution. It cannot be denied that in many cases, in large cities,\r\nthis may be the immediate occasion of the entrance of a young girl upon\r\na life of shame; but it may still be insisted that there must have been,\r\nin such cases, a deficiency in previous training; for a young woman,\r\neducated with a proper regard for purity, would sooner sacrifice life\r\nitself than virtue. Again, poverty can be no excuse, for in every city\r\nthere are made provisions for the relief of the needy poor, and none\r\nwho are really worthy need suffer.\r\n\r\nIgnorance.--Perhaps nothing fosters vice more than ignorance.\r\nProstitutes come almost entirely from the more ignorant classes, though\r\nthere are, of course, many exceptions. Among the lowest classes, vice\r\nis seen in its grossest forms, and is carried to the greatest lengths.\r\nIntellectual culture is antagonistic to sensuality. As a general rule,\r\nin proportion as the intellect is developed, the animal passions are\r\nbrought into subjection. It is true that very intellectual men have\r\nbeen great libertines, and that the licentious Borgias and Medicis of\r\nItaly encouraged art and literature; but these are only apparent\r\nexceptions, for who knows to what greater depths of vice these\r\nindividuals might have sunk had it not been for the restraining\r\ninfluence of mental culture?\r\n\r\nSays Deslandes, \"In proportion as the intellect becomes enfeebled, the\r\ngenerative sensibility is augmented.\" The animal passions seem to\r\nsurvive when all higher intelligence is lost. We once saw an\r\nillustration of this fact in an idiot who was brought before a medical\r\nclass in a clinic at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The patient had been\r\nan idiot from birth, and presented the most revolting appearance,\r\nseemingly possessing scarcely the intelligence of the average dog; but\r\nhis animal propensities were so great as to be almost uncontrollable.\r\nIndeed, he showed evidences of having been a gross debauchee, having\r\ncontracted venereal disease of the worst form. The general prevalence\r\nof extravagant sexual excitement among the insane is a well-known fact.\r\n\r\nDisease.--Various diseases which cause local irritation and congestion\r\nof the reproductive organs are the causes of unchastity in both sexes,\r\nas previously explained. It not unfrequently happens that by constantly\r\ndwelling upon unchaste subjects until a condition of habitual\r\ncongestion of the sexual organs is produced, young women become seized\r\nwith a furor for libidinous commerce which nothing but the desired\r\nobject will appease, unless active remedial measures are adopted under\r\nthe direction of a skillful physician. This disease, known as\r\n_nymphomania_, has been the occasion of the fall of many young women\r\nof the better classes who have been bred in luxury and idleness, but\r\nwere never taught even the first lessons of purity or self-control.\r\nConstipation, piles, worms, pruritis of the genitals, and some other\r\nless common diseases of the urinary and genital systems, have been\r\ncauses of sexual excitement which has resulted in moral degradation.\r\n\r\nResults of Licentiousness.--Apparently as a safeguard to virtue,\r\nnature has appended to the sin of illicit sexual indulgence, as\r\npenalties, the most loathsome, deadly, and incurable diseases known\r\nto man. Some of these, as _gonorrhea_ and _chancroid_, are purely local\r\ndiseases; and though they occasion the transgressor a vast amount of\r\nsuffering, they may be cured and leave no trace of their presence except\r\nin the conscience of the individual. Such a result, however, is by no\r\nmeans the usual one. Most frequently, the injury done is more or less\r\npermanent; sometimes it amounts to loss of life or serious mutilation,\r\nas in cases we have seen. And one attack secures no immunity from\r\nsubsequent ones, as a new disease may be contracted upon every exposure.\r\n\r\nBy far the worst form of venereal disease is _syphilis_, a malady which\r\nwas formerly confounded with the two forms of disease mentioned, but\r\nfrom which it is essentially different. At first, a very slight local\r\nlesion, of no more consequence--except from its significance--than a\r\nsmall boil, it rapidly infects the general system, poisoning the whole\r\nbody, and liable forever after to develop itself in any one or more\r\nof its protean forms. The most loathsome sight upon which a human eye\r\ncan rest is a victim of this disease who presents it well developed\r\nin its later stages. In the large Charity Hospital upon Blackwell's\r\nIsland, near New York City, we have seen scores of these unfortunates\r\nof both sexes, exhibiting the horrid disease in all its phases. To\r\ndescribe them would be to place before our readers a picture too\r\nrevolting for these pages. No pen can portray the woebegone faces, the\r\nhopeless air, of these degraded sufferers whose repentance has come,\r\nalas! too late. No words can convey an adequate idea of their sufferings.\r\nWhat remorse and useless regrets add to the misery of their wretched\r\nexistence as they daily watch the progress of a malignant ulceration\r\nwhich is destroying their organs of speech, or burrowing deep into the\r\nrecesses of the skull, penetrating even to the brain itself! Even the\r\nbones become rottenness; foul running sores appear on different\r\nportions of the body, and may even cover it entirely. Perhaps the nose,\r\nor the tongue, or the lips, or an eye, or some other prominent organ,\r\nis lost. Still the miserable sufferer lingers on, life serving only\r\nto prolong the torture. To many of them, death would be a grateful\r\nrelease, even with the fires of retributive justice before their eyes;\r\nfor hell itself could scarcely be more awful punishment than that which\r\nthey daily endure.\r\n\r\nThousands of Victims.--The venturesome youth need not attempt to calm\r\nhis fears by thinking that these are only exceptional cases, for this\r\nis not the truth. In any city, one who has an experienced eye can\r\nscarcely walk a dozen blocks on busy streets without encountering the\r\nwoeful effects of sexual transgression. Neither do these results come\r\nonly from long-continued violations of the laws of chastity. The very\r\nfirst departure from virtue may occasion all the worst effects\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nEffects of Vice Ineradicable.--Another fearful feature of this\r\nterrible disease is that when once it invades the system its eradication\r\nis impossible. No drug, no chemical, can antidote its virulent poison\r\nor drive it from the system. Various means may smother it, possibly\r\nfor a life-time; but yet it is not cured, and the patient is never safe\r\nfrom a new outbreak. Prof. Bumstead, an acknowledged authority on this\r\nsubject, after observing the disease for many years, says that \"he never\r\nafter treatment, however prolonged, promises immunity for the\r\nfuture.\"[44] Dr. Van Buren, professor of surgery at Bellevue Hospital\r\nMedical College, New York, bears the same testimony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Venereal Disease.]\r\n\r\nProf. Van Buren also says that he has often seen the disease occur upon\r\nthe lips of young ladies who were entirely virtuous, but who were\r\nengaged to men who had contracted the disease and had communicated it\r\nto them by the act of kissing. Virtuous wives have not infrequently\r\nhad their constitutions hopelessly ruined by contracting the disease\r\nfrom husbands who had themselves been inoculated either before or after\r\nmarriage, by illicit intercourse. Several such unfortunate cases have\r\nfallen under our observation, and there is reason to believe that they\r\nare not infrequent.\r\n\r\nThe Only Hope.--The only hope for one who has contracted this disease\r\nis to lead a life of perfect continence ever after, and by a most careful\r\nlife, by conforming strictly to the laws of health, by bathing and\r\ndieting, he may possibly avoid the horrid consequences of the later\r\nstages of the malady. Mercury will not cure, nor will any other poison,\r\nas before remarked.\r\n\r\nThe following strong testimony on this subject we quote from an\r\nadmirable pamphlet by Prof. Fred. H. Gerrish, M.D.:--\r\n\r\n\"The diseases dependent upon prostitution are appallingly frequent,\r\na distinguished surgeon recently declaring that one person in twenty\r\nin the United States has syphilis, a malady so ineradicable that a\r\nprofound observer has remarked that 'a man who is once thus poisoned\r\nwill die a syphilitic, and, in the day of Judgment, he will be a\r\nsyphilitic ghost.' Prof. Gross says: 'What is called scrofula, struma,\r\nor tuberculosis, is, I have long been satisfied from careful\r\nobservation of the sick and a profound study of the literature of the\r\nsubject, in a great majority of cases, if not invariably, merely\r\nsyphilis in its more remote stages.' Though there are doubtless many\r\nof us who believe that a not inconsiderable proportion of scrofulous\r\nand phthisical cases are clearly due to other causes than syphilis,\r\nwe must admit that this statement contains a very large element of\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\nHereditary Effects of Venereal Disease.--The transgressor is not the\r\nonly sufferer. If he marries, his children, if they survive infancy,\r\nwill in later years show the effects of their father's sin, exhibiting\r\nthe forms of the disease seen in its later stages. Scrofula, consumption,\r\ncancer, rickets, diseases of the brain and nerves, decay of the bones\r\nby caries or necrosis, and other diseases, arise in this way.\r\n\r\nBut it generally happens that the child dies before birth, or lingers\r\nout a miserable existence of a few days or weeks thereafter. A most\r\npitiable sight these little ones are. Their faces look as old as\r\nchildren of ten or twelve. Often their bodies become reduced before\r\ndeath to the most wretched skeletons. Their hollow, feeble cry sends\r\na shudder of horror through the listener, and impresses indelibly the\r\nterrible consequences of sexual sin. Plenty of these scrawny infants\r\nmay be seen in the lying-in hospitals.\r\n\r\nNo one can estimate how much of the excessive mortality of infants is\r\nowing to this cause.\r\n\r\nIn children who survive infancy, its blighting influence may be seen\r\nin the notched, deformed teeth, and other defects; and very often it\r\nwill be found, upon looking into the mouth of the child, that the soft\r\npalate, and perhaps the hard palate as well, is in a state of ulceration.\r\nThere is more than a suspicion that this disease may be transmitted\r\nfor several generations, perhaps remaining latent during the life-time\r\nof one, and appearing in all its virulence in the next.\r\n\r\nMan the Only Transgressor.--Man is the only animal that abuses his\r\nsexual organization by making it subservient to other ends than\r\nreproduction; hence he is the only sufferer from this foul disease,\r\nwhich is one of the penalties of such abuse. Attempts have been made\r\nto communicate the disease to lower animals, but without success, even\r\nthough inoculation was practiced.\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Foul Disease.--Where or when the disease originated, is\r\na mystery. It is said to have been introduced into France from Naples\r\nby French soldiers. That it originated spontaneously at some time can\r\nscarcely be doubted, and that it might originate under circumstances\r\nof excessive violation of the laws of chastity is rendered probable\r\nby the fact that gonorrhea, or an infectious disease exactly resembling\r\nit, is often caused by excessive indulgence, from which cause it not\r\ninfrequently occurs in the newly married, giving rise to unjust\r\nsuspicion of infidelity on both sides.\r\n\r\nRead the following from a noted French physician:--\r\n\r\n\"The father, as well as the mother, communicates the syphilitic virus\r\nto the children. These poor little beings are attacked sometimes at\r\ntheir birth; more often it is at the end of a month or two, before these\r\nmorbid symptoms appear.\r\n\r\n\"I recall the heart-rending anguish of a mother whom I assisted at her\r\nfifth confinement. She related to me her misfortune: 'I have already\r\nbrought into the world four children. Alas! they all died during the\r\nfirst months of their existence. A frightful eruption wasted them away\r\nand killed them. Save me the one that is about to be born!' cried she,\r\nin tears. The child that I delivered was sickly and puny. A few days\r\nafter its birth, it had purulent ophthalmia; then, crusted and\r\nulcerated pustules, a few at first, numerous afterward, covered the\r\nentire surface of the skin. Soon this miserable little being became\r\nas meager as a skeleton, hideous to the sight, and died. Having\r\nquestioned the husband, he acknowledged to me that he had had\r\nsyphilis.\"[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Bourgeois.]\r\n\r\nCure of the \"Social Evil.\"--With rare exceptions, the efforts of civil\r\nlegislation have been directed toward controlling or modifying this\r\nvice, rather than extirpating it.\r\n\r\nAmong other devices adopted with a view to effect this, and to mitigate\r\nin some degree the resulting evils, the issuing of licenses for brothels\r\nhas been practiced in several large cities. One of the conditions of\r\nthe license makes it obligatory upon the keepers of houses of ill-repute\r\nand their inmates to submit to medical examination at stated intervals.\r\nBy this means, it is expected to detect the cases of foul disease at\r\nthe outset, and thus to protect others by placing the infected\r\nindividuals under restraint and treatment. It will be seen that for\r\nmany reasons such examinations could not be effective; but, even if\r\nthey were, the propriety of this plan of dealing with the vice is\r\nexceedingly questionable, as will appear from the following\r\nconsiderations:--\r\n\r\n1. The moment that prostitution is placed under the protection of law\r\nby means of a license, it at once loses half its disrepute, and becomes\r\nrespectable, as do gambling and liquor-selling under the same\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n2. Why should so vile a crime as fornication be taken under legal\r\nprotection more than stealing or the lowest forms of gambling? Is it\r\nnot a lesser crime against human nature to rob a man of his money by\r\ntheft or by deceit and trickery than to snatch from him at one fell\r\nswoop his health, his virtue, and his peace of mind? Why not as well\r\nhave laws to regulate burglary and assassination, allowing the\r\nperpetrators of those crimes to ply their chosen avocations with\r\nimpunity under certain prescribed restrictions; if robbery, for\r\ninstance, requiring the thief to leave his victim money enough to make\r\nhis escape to another country; or, if murder, directing the assassin\r\nto allow his intended victim time to repeat a sufficient number of _Ave\r\nMarias_ to insure his safe transit through purgatory or to pay a priest\r\nfor doing the same? Such a course would not be inconsistent with the\r\npolicy which legalizes that infamous traffic in human souls,\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\n3. By the use of certain precautionary measures the fears of many will\r\nbe allayed, so that thousands whose fear of the consequences of sin\r\nwould otherwise have kept them physically virtuous, at least,\r\nerroneously supposing that the cause for fear has been removed, will\r\nrush madly into a career of vice, and will learn only too late the folly\r\nof their course.\r\n\r\nPrevention the Only Cure.--Those who have once entered upon a career\r\nof sensuality are generally so completely lost to all sense of purity\r\nand right that there is little chance for reforming them. They have\r\nno principle to which to appeal. The gratification of lust so degrades\r\nthe soul and benumbs the higher sensibilities that a votary of\r\nvoluptuousness is a most unpromising subject for reformatory efforts.\r\nThe old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is\r\nstrikingly exemplified in this case. The remedy must be applied before\r\nthe depths have been reached. It was well said by a celebrated physician\r\nto a young man beginning a life of vice, \"You are entering upon a career\r\nfrom which you will never turn back.\"\r\n\r\nEarly Training.--The remedy, to be effective, must be applied early,\r\nthe earlier the better. Lessons on chastity may be given in early\r\ninfancy. The remedy may be applied even further back than this; children\r\nmust be virtuously generated. The bearing of this point will be fully\r\nappreciated in connection with the principles established in the\r\npreceding pages of this work, and which have already been sufficiently\r\nelucidated.\r\n\r\nChildren should be early taught to reverence virtue, to abhor lust;\r\nand boys should be so trained that they will associate with the name\r\nof woman only pure, chaste, and noble thoughts. Few things are more\r\ndeeply injurious to the character of woman, and more conducive to the\r\nproduction of foul imaginations in children, than the free discussion\r\nof such subjects as the \"Beecher scandal\" and like topics. The\r\ninquisitive minds and lively imaginations of childhood penetrate the\r\nrotten mysteries of such foul subjects at a much earlier age than many\r\npersons imagine. The inquiring minds of children will be occupied in\r\nsome way, and it is of the utmost importance that they should be early\r\nfilled with thoughts that will lead them to noble and pure actions.\r\n\r\nTeach Self-Control.--One important part of early training is the\r\ncultivation of self-control, and a habit of self-denial, whenever right\r\ndemands it. Another most essential part of a child's moral training\r\nis the cultivation of right motives. To present a child no higher\r\nmotives for doing right than the hope of securing some pleasant reward,\r\nor the fear of suffering some terrible punishment, is the surest way\r\nto make of him a supremely selfish man, with no higher aim than to secure\r\ngood to himself, no matter what may become of other people. And if he\r\ncan convince himself that the pleasure he will secure by the commission\r\nof a certain act will more than counterbalance the probable risk of\r\nsuffering, he will not hesitate to commit it, leaving wholly out of\r\nthe consideration the question, Is it right? or noble? or pure? A love\r\nof right for its own sake is the only solid basis upon which to build\r\na moral character. Children should not be taught to do right in order\r\nto avoid a whipping, or imprisonment in a dark closet,--a horrid kind\r\nof punishment sometimes resorted to,--or even to escape \"the lake of\r\nfire and brimstone.\" Neither should they be constantly coaxed to\r\nright-doing by promised rewards,--a new toy, a book, an excursion, nor\r\neven the pleasures of Heaven. All of these incentives are selfish, and\r\ninvariably narrow the character and belittle life when made the _chief_\r\nmotives of action. But rather begin at the earliest possible moment\r\nto instill into the mind a love for right, and truth, and purity, and\r\nvirtue, and an abhorrence for their contraries; then will he have a\r\nworthy principle by which to square his life; then will he be safe from\r\nthe assaults of passion, of vice, of lust. A mind so trained stands\r\nupon an eminence from which all evil men and devils combined cannot\r\ndisplace it so long as it adheres to its noble principles.\r\n\r\nMental Culture.--The cultivation of the physical organization must not\r\nbe neglected. Healthful mental discipline should receive equal\r\nattention. By healthful mental discipline is not meant that kind of\r\nsuperficial \"cramming\" and memorizing which constitute the training\r\nof the average school, but sound culture; a directing of the mind from\r\nfacts to underlying principles; a development of the reasoning powers\r\nso as to bring the emotions and passions into subjection; the\r\nacquirement of the power to concentrate the mind, one of the best\r\nmethods of cultivating self-control,--these are some of the objects\r\nand results of sound culture of the mind.\r\n\r\nTo supply the mind with food for pure thoughts, the child should be\r\nearly inspired with a love for nature. The perceptives should be trained,\r\nthe child taught to observe closely and accurately. The study of the\r\nnatural sciences is a most valuable means of elevating the mind above\r\ngrossness and sensuality. To be successful in this direction, parents\r\nmust cultivate a love for the same objects themselves. Take the little\r\nones into the country, if they are not so fortunate as to live there,\r\nand in the midst of nature's glories, point their impressible minds\r\nupward to the Author of all the surrounding loveliness. Gather flowers\r\nand leaves and call attention to the peculiarities and special beauties\r\nof each, and thus arouse curiosity and cultivate habits of close\r\nobservation and attention.\r\n\r\nEarly Associations.--As children grow older, watch their associations.\r\nWarn them of evil influences and evil practices. Make home so attractive\r\nthat they will enjoy it better than any other place. Cultivate music;\r\nits mellowing, harmonizing, refining influence is too great to be\r\nprudently withheld. Children naturally love music; and if they cannot\r\nhear it at home, they will go where they can hear it. Supply attractive\r\nbooks of natural history, travels, interesting and instructive\r\nbiographies, and almost any other books but love-sick novels, and\r\nsentimental religious story-books. Guard against bad books and bad\r\nassociates as carefully as though they were deadly serpents, for they\r\nare, indeed, the artful emissaries of the \"old serpent\" himself. A taste\r\nonce formed for reading light literature destroys the relish for solid\r\nreading; and usually the taste, once lost, is never regained. The\r\nfascination of bad companionship once formed around a person is broken\r\nwith the greatest difficulty. Hence the necessity for watching for the\r\nvery beginnings of evil and promptly checking them.\r\n\r\nThe mind should be thus fortified against the trifles and follies of\r\nfashionable life. It should be elevated into a sphere far above that\r\noccupied by those who pass their time in fashionable drawing-rooms in\r\nsilly twaddle, with thrumming a piano, with listless day-dreaming, or\r\nin the gratification of perverted tastes and depraved instincts in any\r\nother of the ways common to fashionable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLITARY VICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf illicit commerce of the sexes is a heinous sin, self-pollution, or\r\nmasturbation, is a crime doubly abominable. As a sin against nature,\r\nit has no parallel except in sodomy (see Gen. 19:5, Judges 19:22). It\r\nis the most dangerous of all sexual abuses, because the most extensively\r\npracticed. The vice consists in any excitement of the genital organs\r\nproduced otherwise than in the natural way. It is known by the terms,\r\nself-pollution, self-abuse, masturbation, onanism, manustupration,\r\nvoluntary pollution, solitary or secret vice, and other names\r\nsufficiently explanatory. The vice is the more extensive because there\r\nare no bounds to its indulgence. Its frequent repetition fastens it\r\nupon the victim with a fascination almost irresistible. It may be begun\r\nin earliest infancy, and may continue through life.\r\n\r\nEven though no warning may have been given, the transgressor seems to\r\nknow, instinctively, that he is committing a great wrong, for he\r\ncarefully hides his practice from observation. In solitude he pollutes\r\nhimself, and with his own hand blights all his prospects for both this\r\nworld and the next. Even after being solemnly warned, he will often\r\ncontinue this worse than beastly practice, deliberately forfeiting his\r\nright to health and happiness for a moment's mad sensuality.\r\n\r\nAlarming Prevalence of the Vice.--The habit is by no means confined\r\nto boys; girls also indulge in it, though, it is to be hoped, to a less\r\nfearful extent than boys, at least in this country. A Russian physician,\r\nquoted by an eminent medical professor in New York, states that the\r\nhabit is universal among girls in Russia. It seems impossible that such\r\na statement should be credible; and yet we have not seen it contradicted.\r\nIt is more than probable that the practice is far more nearly universal\r\neverywhere than even medical men are willing to admit. Many young men\r\nwho have been addicted to the vice, have, in their confessions, declared\r\nthat they found it universal in the schools in which they learned the\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nDr. Gardner speaks of it as \"the secret cause of much that is perverting\r\nthe energies and demoralizing the minds of many of our fairest and\r\nbest.\" He further says:--\r\n\r\n\"Much of the worthlessness, lassitude, and physical and mental\r\nfeebleness attributable to the modern woman are to be ascribed to these\r\nhabits as their initial cause.\" \"Foreigners are especially struck with\r\nthis fact as the cause of much of the physical disease of our young\r\nwomen. They recognize it in the physique, in the sodden, colorless\r\ncountenance, the lack-luster eye, in the dreamy indolence, the general\r\ncarriage, the constant demeanor indicative of distrust, mingled\r\nboldness and timidity, and a series of anomalous combinations which\r\nmark this genus of physical and moral decay.\"\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the vice is practiced by an individual is in some\r\ncases appalling. Three or four repetitions of the act daily are not\r\nuncommon; and the following from Dr. Copland is evidence of much deeper\r\ndepravity:--\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that the individual who has once devoted himself\r\nto this moloch of the species becomes but too frequently its slave to\r\nan almost incredible degree. A patient who was sent to London for my\r\nadvice confessed that he had practiced this vice seven or eight times\r\ndaily from the age of thirteen until twenty-four; and he was then\r\nreduced to the lowest state of mental weakness, associated with various\r\nbodily infirmities; indeed, both mental power and physical existence\r\nwere nearly extinguished.\"\r\n\r\nTestimony of Eminent Authors.--Says a medical writer, \"In my opinion,\r\nneither the plague, nor war, nor small-pox, nor similar diseases, have\r\nproduced results so disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of\r\nonanism; it is the destroying element of civilized societies, which\r\nis constantly in action, and gradually undermines the health of\r\na nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sin of self-pollution, which is generally considered to be that\r\nof Onan, is one of the most destructive evils ever practiced by fallen\r\nman. In many respects it is several degrees worse than common whoredom,\r\nand has in its train more awful consequences, though practiced by\r\nnumbers who would shudder at the thought of criminal connection with\r\na prostitute.\"[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Dr. Adam Clarke.]\r\n\r\n\"However revolting to the feelings it may be to enter upon such a subject,\r\nit cannot be passed over in silence without a great violation of duty.\r\nUnhappily, it has not been hitherto exhibited in the awful light in\r\nwhich it deserves to be shown. _The worst of it is that it is seldom\r\nsuspected._ There are many pale faces and languid and nervous feelings\r\nattributed to other causes, when all the mischief lies here.\"[47]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Sir W. C. Ellis.]\r\n\r\nWe scarcely need add further evidence of the fearful extent of this\r\nevil, but will conclude with the following:--\r\n\r\n\"The pernicious and debasing practice of masturbation is a more common\r\nand extensive evil with youth of both sexes than is usually supposed.\"\r\n\"A great number of the evils which come upon the youth at and after\r\nthe age of puberty, arise from masturbation, persisted in, so as to\r\nwaste the vital energies and enervate the physical and mental powers\r\nof man.\" \"Many of the weaknesses commonly attributed to growth and the\r\nchanges in the habit by the important transformation from adolescence\r\nto manhood, are justly referable to this practice.\"[48]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Boston Medical and Surgical Journal.]\r\n\r\nNot a Modern Vice.--That this vice is not entirely a modern one is proved\r\nby the fact that in many ancient writings directions are given for\r\ntreating its effects. Even Moses seems to have recognized disorders\r\nof this class. Hippocrates and others devoted considerable attention\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nVictims of all Ages.--The ages at which the habit may be practiced\r\ninclude almost the whole extent of human life. We have seen it in infants\r\nof only three or four years, and in old men scarcely less than sixty,\r\nin both extremes marked by the most unmistakable and lamentable\r\nconsequences. Cases have been noted in which the practice was begun\r\nas early as two years of age. It is common among African boys at nine\r\nand ten years of age, according to Dr. Copland.\r\n\r\nUnsuspected Rottenness.--Parents who have no suspicion of the evil,\r\nwho think their children the embodiment of purity, will find by careful\r\nobservation and inquiry,--though personal testimony cannot be relied\r\nupon,--that in numerous instances their supposed virtuous children are\r\nold in corruption. Such a revelation has brought dismay into many a\r\nfamily, only too late in some cases.\r\n\r\nNot long since a case came under our care which well illustrates the\r\napathy and blindness of parents with respect to this subject. The\r\nparents of a young man whose mind seemed to be somewhat disordered,\r\nsent word to us through a friend respecting his condition, asking advice.\r\nWe suspected from the symptoms described the real cause of the disease,\r\nand urged prompt attention to the case. In a short time the young man\r\nwas placed under our immediate care without encouragement of a cure,\r\nand we gave the case still closer study. The characteristic symptoms\r\nof disease from self-abuse were marked, but the father was positive\r\nthat no influence of that kind could have been at work. He had watched\r\nhis son narrowly from infancy, and did not believe it possible for him\r\nto have been guilty. In addition, the young man had long been remarkable\r\nfor his piety, and he did not believe there could be any possibility\r\nof his being guilty of so gross a crime.\r\n\r\nA short time sufficed, however, to secure the indisputable evidence\r\nof the fact by his being caught in the act by his nurse.\r\n\r\nThis young man was a sad example of what havoc is made with the \"human\r\nform divine\" by this debasing vice. Once a bright boy, kind,\r\naffectionate, active, intelligent, the pride of a loving mother and\r\nthe hope of a doting father, his mind had sunken to driveling idiocy.\r\nHis vacant stare and expressionless countenance betokened almost\r\ncomplete imbecility. If allowed to do so, he would remain for hours\r\nin whatever position his last movement left him. If his hand was raised,\r\nit remained extended until placed in a position of rest by his attendant.\r\nOnly with the utmost difficulty could he be made to rise in the morning,\r\nto eat, drink, or walk. Only by great efforts could he be aroused from\r\nhis lethargy sufficiently to answer the most simple question. The\r\ninstinctive demands of decency in regarding the calls of nature were\r\nnot respected. In short, the distinguishing characteristics of a human\r\nbeing were almost wholly obliterated, leaving but a physical semblance\r\nof humanity; a mind completely wrecked, a body undergoing dissolution\r\nwhile yet alive, a blasted life, no hope for this world, no prospect\r\nfor the next. In the insane asylums of the country may be seen hundreds\r\nof these poor victims in all stages of physical and mental\r\ndemoralization.\r\n\r\nCauses of the Habit.--It is needless to recapitulate all the causes\r\nof unchastity which have previously been quite fully dwelt upon, nearly\r\nall of which are predisposing or exciting causes of solitary as well\r\nas of social vice. Sexual precocity, idleness, pernicious literature,\r\nabnormal sexual passions, exciting and irritating food, gluttony,\r\nsedentary employment, libidinous pictures, and many abnormal\r\nconditions of life, are potent causes in exciting the vile practice;\r\nbut by far the most frequent causes are evil associations, wicked or\r\nignorant nurses, and local disease, or abnormality. These latter we\r\nwill consider more particularly, as they have not been so fully dwelt\r\nupon elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEvil Associations.--A child may have been reared with the greatest care.\r\nFrom infancy he may have been carefully shielded from all pernicious\r\ninfluences, so that at the age of ten or twelve, when he is for the\r\nfirst time sent away to school, he may be free from vice; but when he\r\nassociates with his fellow-students, he soon finds them practicing a\r\nhabit new to him, and being unwarned, he speedily follows their filthy\r\nexample and quickly becomes fascinated with the vice. Thousands have\r\ntaken their first lessons in this debasing habit at school. Teachers\r\nand scholars testify that it is often practiced even in school hours,\r\nalmost under the teacher's eyes; but where the infection most quickly\r\nspreads is in the sleeping apartments, where more than one occupy the\r\nsame bed, or where several sleep in the same room.\r\n\r\nNothing is more indispensable to purity of body and of morals than a\r\nprivate sleeping room and single bed for each student. Such an\r\narrangement would protect the youth from the reception of much evil,\r\nand would allow an opportunity for privacy which every young man or\r\nyouth needs for his spiritual as well as physical benefit. Not the least\r\nbenefit of the latter class is the opportunity for a thorough cleansing\r\nof the whole body every morning, which is almost as indispensable to\r\npurity of morals as cleanliness of body. The same suggestion is fully\r\nas applicable to the sleeping arrangements of girls. The exceptional\r\ncases in which this plan would not be the best are very few indeed.\r\n\r\nCorruption in Schools.--Says Dr. Acton, \"I cannot venture to print the\r\naccounts patients have given me of what they have seen or even been\r\ndrawn into at schools. I would fain hope that such abominations are\r\nthings of the past.\" The entrance of a single corrupt boy into a school\r\nwhich may have been previously pure--though such schools must be\r\nextremely rare--will speedily corrupt almost the entire membership.\r\nThe evil infection spreads more rapidly than the contagion of small-pox\r\nor yellow fever, and it is scarcely less fatal.\r\n\r\nThis danger exists not in public or city schools alone, but in the most\r\nselect and private schools. A father who had kept his two sons under\r\nthe care of a private governess for several years, and then placed them\r\nin a small school taught by a lady, and composed of a few small children\r\nfrom the most select families, was greatly astonished when informed\r\nby a physician that his sons showed symptoms of the effects of\r\nself-abuse. He was totally incredulous; but an investigation showed\r\nthat they had already practiced the vile habit for several years, having\r\nlearned it of an infantile school-mate.\r\n\r\nWe were acquainted with one instance in which a primary school in a\r\nsecluded and select community was nearly broken up by the introduction\r\nof this vile habit through a corrupt student. Many a watchful teacher\r\nhas seen the light of growing intelligence suddenly dim and wane in\r\nthe eye of his favorite student just when he was giving the most promise\r\nof developing unusual talents in literature, mathematics, or some one\r\nof the natural or physical sciences, and has been compelled to watch\r\nthe devastating influence of this deadly upas tree that often claims\r\nthe best and fairest human flowers as its victims.\r\n\r\nWicked Nurses.--In those cases in which the habit is acquired at a very\r\nearly age, the work of evil is usually wrought by the nurse, perhaps\r\nthrough ignorance of the effects of the habit. Incredible as it seems,\r\nit is proved by numerous instances that it is not an uncommon habit\r\nfor nurses to quiet small children by handling or titillating their\r\ngenital organs. They find this a speedy means of quieting them, and\r\nresort to it regardless or ignorant of the consequences.\r\n\r\nNot an Uncommon Case.--Prof. Lusk, of Bellevue Hospital College, New\r\nYork, related to his medical class in our hearing a case which came\r\nunder his observation in which all of the children in a large family\r\nhad been taught the habit by a wicked nurse for the purpose of keeping\r\nthem quiet after they were put to bed. The vileness that would lead\r\na person to thus rob childhood of its innocence, and blast its prospects\r\nfor this life and the next, is base enough for the commission of almost\r\nany crime. Indeed, the crime could hardly have been a worse one had\r\nthe nurse referred to in the above case in cold blood cut the throats\r\nof those innocent children; perhaps it might have been better for the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nA gentleman once declared that if he should detect a person teaching\r\nthis crime to his child he would shoot him on the spot; and if homicide\r\nis allowable under any circumstances, it seems to us it would be\r\nextenuated by such an aggravation. If occasional bad associations will\r\nwork an immense damage to the youthful character, what terrible injury\r\nmay be wrought by an agent of sin, an instructor in vice, who is within\r\nthe household, who presides in the nursery, and exerts a constant\r\ninfluence! No one can estimate it.\r\n\r\nActon remarks on this point, \"I need hardly point out how very dangerous\r\nthis is. There seems hardly any limit to the age at which a young child\r\ncan be initiated into these abominations, or to the depth of degradation\r\nto which it may fall under such hideous teaching. Books treating of\r\nthis subject are unfortunately too full of accounts of the habits of\r\nsuch children.\"\r\n\r\nIn not a few instances the \"hired man\" has been the means of\r\ncommunicating to innocent little boys the infamous knowledge which,\r\nfortunately, they had not acquired in babyhood. With no knowledge of\r\nthe evil they are committing, they begin the work of physical damnation\r\nwhich makes a hell of life and leads to endless death.\r\n\r\nThe \"hired girl\" is often an equally efficient agent for evil in the\r\ninstruction of little girls in this debasing vice. Some time ago, the\r\nvery intelligent parents of a bright family of children were awakened\r\nto the importance of this subject from the perusal of the first edition\r\nof this work, and upon investigation were horrified to find that their\r\noldest child a promising daughter of ten, was already a victim to the\r\nvile practice, having been initiated by a \"hired girl.\" After using\r\nin vain every means he could bring to bear upon the case, the father\r\nbrought her to us, and with tears in his eyes gave his story. After\r\ntelling of his unsuccessful attempts to effect a reform, he declared\r\nthat he would far prefer to place his daughter in the grave than to\r\nsee her grow up a wretched victim of this vice. We were most happy to\r\nbe able, after a few weeks' treatment, to restore her to her parents,\r\nas we hope, permanently reformed. Not a few such cases are constantly\r\ncoming to the attention of the medical profession.\r\n\r\nThe Instructor in Vice.--Are these lines perused by any one who has\r\never taught another this vice so vile, and so certainly followed by\r\npenalties so terrible--penalties not upon the instigator but upon the\r\nhapless victim? let such a person clothe himself in sackcloth and ashes,\r\nand do penance for the remainder of his life. The only way in which\r\nhe can hope to atone even in some small degree for such a heinous crime,\r\nis by doing all in his power to warn those in danger against this sin.\r\nWhen all men receive their just deserts, what will be the punishment\r\nof such a one who has not, by thorough repentance and a life spent in\r\ntrying to undo the work of ruin so foully wrought, in some measure\r\ndisburdened himself of the consequences of his act!\r\n\r\nSending children very early to bed before they are weary, \"to get them\r\nout of the way,\" or for punishment, is a grave error, as this may give\r\nrise to the vice. Confining children alone in a room by themselves is\r\nan equally reprehensible practice, as it favors the commission of the\r\nact, at least, and may afford a favorable opportunity for its discovery.\r\nAllowing children to form a habit of seeking solitude is an evil of\r\nthe same nature.\r\n\r\nLocal Disease.--In the male, a tight or long foreskin is a frequent\r\ncause of the habit. The constant contact of the prepuce with the most\r\nsensitive part of the organ increases its sensibility. The secretion\r\nis retained, and accumulates, often becoming hardened. In this manner\r\nirritation is set up, which occasions uncomfortable feelings, and\r\nattracts the hands to the part. Owing to the great degree of excitement\r\ndue to irritation, but a slight provocation is necessary to arouse\r\nvoluptuous sensations, and then the terrible secret is revealed. The\r\nchild readily discovers how to reproduce the same, and is not slow to\r\ncommit a frequent repetition of the act; and thus the habit is formed.\r\n\r\nAn Illustrative Case.--A case in which the vice originated in this\r\nmanner was recently under our observation. The patient was a man of\r\nconsiderable intellectual power and some culture, but showed\r\nunmistakable signs of his early indiscretion. He stated that although\r\nhe mingled quite freely with other boys of his age, he obtained no\r\nknowledge of the habit from others. He often heard allusions which he\r\ndid not understand, and of which he did not, fortunately, discover the\r\nmeaning. But he was afflicted with congenital _phimosis_, the prepuce\r\nbeing so tight that retraction was impossible. This, together with\r\nurinal irritation,--which occasioned nocturnal incontinence of\r\nurine,--constipation, and highly seasoned food, produced so much local\r\nirritation as to occasion frequent erections, and an increased\r\nsecretion. He soon noticed that there was an accumulation of hardened\r\nsecretion beneath the foreskin, and in attempting to remove this, he\r\naccidentally provoked voluptuous sensations. He speedily abandoned\r\nhimself to the habit, often repeating it several times a day. Beginning\r\nat the age of twelve years, he continued it for three or four years.\r\n\r\nSoon after acquiring the habit, he became aware of its tendencies,\r\nthrough reading books upon the subject, but he found himself so\r\ncompletely enslaved that abstinence seemed impossible. One resolution\r\nto reform after another was formed, only to be speedily broken. His\r\nunwholesome diet, habitual constipation, and especially the\r\nunfortunate organic difficulty in his genital organs, produced an\r\nalmost constant priapism, which was only relieved, and then but\r\ntemporarily, by the act of pollution. His sedentary habits increased\r\nthe difficulty to an extreme degree.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, his constitution, naturally weak, was being gradually\r\nundermined. He suffered from constant headache, heart-burn, pains in\r\nthe back and limbs, weakness, and lassitude. Yet he attributed none\r\nof these ailments to the true cause. After the lapse of three or four\r\nyears thus spent, and after repeated ineffectual attempts, by a\r\npowerful effort of the will, by the aid of prayer, and by adopting a\r\nmore wholesome diet, he succeeded in getting the mastery of his vice.\r\nBut the local difficulties still continued in a great degree, and under\r\nparticularly aggravating circumstances occasioned a relapse at long\r\nintervals. After a time, the local difficulties grew less and less,\r\nand enabled him to gain a complete victory over the habit, though the\r\nresults of previous sin still remained, for which he desired treatment.\r\n\r\nThis case will serve as a fair illustration of many of similar character,\r\nin which the child accidentally makes the discovery which leads him\r\nto work his own ruin.\r\n\r\nOther Physical Causes.--Constipation, piles, irritable bladder,\r\nfissure of the anus, local uncleanliness, and pruritis of the genital\r\norgans, will produce the habit in both males and females in the manner\r\ndescribed. Sleeping on feather beds increases the local congestion,\r\nand thus favors the exciting influences of any of the above-named causes.\r\nIt may, perhaps, itself be the exciting cause.\r\n\r\nWe once treated a patient who was affected with stone in the bladder,\r\nand who asserted that the constant irritation which he suffered in the\r\nend of the penis was only relieved by friction. This might readily be\r\nthe cause of masturbation, though in this case the vice had been\r\nacquired many years before, and was still continued in spite of all\r\nefforts to reform.\r\n\r\nLying upon the back or upon the abdomen frequently leads to self-abuse\r\nby provoking sexual excitement. Certain kinds of exercises, as climbing,\r\nin particular, have been attended by the same results. It is said that\r\nchildren sometimes experience genital excitement amounting to pleasure\r\nas the result of whipping.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Stimulants.--The use of stimulants of any kind is a\r\nfruitful cause of the vice. Tea and coffee have led thousands to\r\nperdition in this way. The influence of tobacco is so strongly shown\r\nin this direction that it is doubtful if there can be found a boy who\r\nhas attained the age of puberty and has acquired the habit of using\r\ntobacco, who is not also addicted to this vile practice. Candies, spices,\r\ncinnamon, cloves, peppermint, and all strong essences, powerfully\r\nexcite the genital organs and lead to the same result.\r\n\r\nIt should be further added that there is evidence that a powerful\r\npredisposition to this vice is transmitted to the children of those\r\nwho have themselves been guilty of it.\r\n\r\nSigns of Self-Abuse.--The net which this vice weaves around its victims\r\nis so strong, and its meshes are so elaborately interwoven with all\r\nhis thoughts, his habits, and his very being, when it has been long\r\nindulged, that it is important to be able to detect it when first\r\nacquired, as it may then be much more easily overcome than at any\r\nsubsequent period. It is often no easy matter to do this, as the victim\r\nwill resort to all manner of cunning devices to hide his vice, and will\r\nnot scruple to falsify concerning it, when questioned. To be able to\r\naccomplish this successfully, requires a careful study, first, of the\r\nsigns by which those who indulge in the practice may be known, and,\r\nsecondly, of the habits of the individuals.\r\n\r\nIn considering the subject it will be found that there are two classes\r\nof signs, as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Those which may arouse suspicion, but any one of which, taken singly,\r\nwould not be an evidence of the practice.\r\n\r\n2. Those which may be regarded as positive. Several suspicious signs\r\ntogether may constitute a positive sign. Under these two heads, we will\r\nconsider the signs of this vile habit.\r\n\r\nIt is well to bear in mind the fact that one or two suspicious signs\r\nare not evidence of the disease. It is likewise well to remember that\r\nthe habit may be found where least looked for, and where one would have\r\na right to expect perfect purity. Prejudice must be allowed no voice\r\nupon either side. A writer has said that every young person under\r\npuberty ought to be suspected of the disease. We can hardly indorse\r\nthis remark, in full, but it would be at least wise for every guardian\r\nof children to criticize most carefully their habits and to quickly\r\ndetect the first indications of sinful practices. Parents must not\r\nthink that _their_ children, at least, are too good to engage in such\r\nsinful abuses. It is most probable that their children are very like\r\nthose of their neighbors; and any amount of natural goodness is not\r\na protection against this insidious vice when it presents itself as\r\na harmless pleasure to the unwarned and ignorant child.\r\n\r\nSuspicious Signs.--The following symptoms, occurring in the mental and\r\nphysical character and habits of a child or young person, may well give\r\nrise to grave suspicions of evil, and should cause parents or guardians\r\nto be on the alert to root it out if possible:--\r\n\r\n1. _General debility_, coming upon a previously healthy child, marked\r\nby emaciation, weakness, an unnatural paleness, colorless lips and gums,\r\nand the general symptoms of exhaustion, when it cannot be traced to\r\nany other legitimate cause, as internal disease, worms, grief, overwork,\r\npoor air or poor food, and when it is not speedily removed by change\r\nof air or appropriate remedial measures, may safely be attributed to\r\nsolitary vice, no matter how far above natural suspicion the individual\r\nmay be. Mistakes will be rare indeed when such a judgment is pronounced\r\nunder the circumstances named.\r\n\r\n2. _Early symptoms of consumption_--or what are supposed to be such--as\r\ncough, and decrease in flesh, with short breathing and soreness of the\r\nlungs--or muscles of the chest--are not infrequently, solely the result\r\nof this vice. That such is the case may be considered pretty surely\r\ndetermined if physical examination of the lungs reveals no organic\r\ndisease of those organs. But it should be remembered that solitary vice\r\nis one of the most frequent causes of early consumption. Several cases\r\nwhich strikingly prove this have fallen under our own observation.\r\n\r\n3. _Premature and defective development_ is a symptom closely allied\r\nto the two preceding. When it cannot be traced to such natural causes\r\nas overstudy, overwork, lack of exercise, and other influences of a\r\nsimilar nature, it should be charged to self-abuse. The early exercise\r\nof the genital organs hastens the attainment of puberty, in many cases,\r\nespecially when the habit is acquired early, but at the same time saps\r\nthe vital energies so that the system is unable to manifest that\r\nincreased energy in growth and development which usually occurs at this\r\nperiod. In consequence, the body remains small, or does not attain that\r\ndevelopment which it otherwise would. The mind is dwarfed as well as\r\nthe body. Sometimes the mind suffers more than the body in lack of\r\ndevelopment, and sometimes the reverse is true. This defective\r\ndevelopment is shown, in the physical organization of males, in the\r\nfailure of the voice to increase in volume and depth of tone as it\r\nshould; in deficient growth of the beard; in failure of the chest to\r\nbecome full and the shoulders broad. The mind and character show the\r\ndwarfing influence by failure to develop those qualities which\r\nespecially distinguish a noble manhood. In the female, defective\r\ndevelopment is shown by menstrual derangements, by defective growth\r\neither in stature, or as shown in unnatural slimness, and in a failure\r\nto develop the graces and pleasing character which should distinguish\r\nearly womanhood. Such signs deserve careful investigation, for they\r\ncan only result from some powerfully blighting influence.\r\n\r\n4. _Sudden change in disposition_ is a sign which may well arouse\r\nsuspicion. If a boy who has previously been cheerful, pleasant, dutiful,\r\nand gentle, suddenly becomes morose, cross, peevish, irritable, and\r\ndisobedient, be sure that some foul influence is at work with him. When\r\na girl, naturally joyous, happy, confiding, and amiable, becomes\r\nunaccountably gloomy, sad, fretful, dissatisfied, and unconfiding, be\r\ncertain that a blight of no insignificant character is resting upon\r\nher. Make a careful study of the habits of such children; and if there\r\nis no sudden illness to account for the change in their character, it\r\nneed not require long deliberation to arrive at the true cause, for\r\nit will rarely be found to be anything other than solitary indulgence.\r\n\r\n5. _Lassitude_ is as unnatural for a child as for a young kitten. A\r\nhealthy child will be active, playful, full of life and animal spirits.\r\nIf a young child manifests indisposition to activity, a dislike for\r\nplay, lifelessness and languor, suspect his habits, if there is no other\r\nreasonable cause to which to attribute his unnatural want of childish\r\nsprightliness.\r\n\r\n6. In connection with the preceding symptom will generally be found,\r\ninstead of that natural brilliance of expression in the eyes and\r\ncountenance, an unnatural dullness and vacantness altogether foreign\r\nto childhood. This is a just ground for suspicion.\r\n\r\n7. _Sleeplessness_ is another symptom of significance. Sound sleep is\r\nnatural for childhood; and if sleeplessness be not occasioned by\r\ndietetic errors, as eating indigestible food, eating between meals,\r\nor eating late suppers, it may justly be a cause for suspicion of evil\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n8. _Failure of mental capacity_ without apparent cause should occasion\r\nsuspicion of evil practices. When a child who has previously learned\r\nreadily, mastered his lessons easily, and possessed a retentive memory,\r\nshows a manifest decline in these directions, fails to get his lessons,\r\nbecomes stupid, forgetful, and inattentive, he has probably become the\r\nvictim of a terrible vice, and is on the road to speedy mental as well\r\nas physical ruin. Watch him.\r\n\r\n9. _Fickleness_ is another evidence of the working of some\r\ndeteriorating influence, for only a weak mind is fickle.\r\n\r\n10. _Untrustworthiness_ appearing in a child should attract attention\r\nto his habits. If he has suddenly become heedless, listless, and\r\nforgetful, so that he cannot be depended upon, though previously not\r\nso, lay the blame upon solitary indulgence. This vice has a wonderful\r\ninfluence in developing untruthfulness. A child previously honest,\r\nunder its baneful influence will soon become an inveterate liar.\r\n\r\n11. _Love of solitude_ is a very suspicious sign. Children are naturally\r\nsociable, almost without exception. They have a natural dread of being\r\nalone. When a child habitually seeks seclusion without a sufficient\r\ncause, there are good grounds for suspecting him of sinful habits. The\r\nbarn, the garret, the water-closet, and sometimes secluded places in\r\nthe woods, are the favorite resorts of masturbators. They should be\r\ncarefully followed and watched, unobserved.\r\n\r\n12. _Bashfulness_ is not infrequently dependent upon this cause. It\r\nwould be far from right to say that every person who is excessively\r\nmodest or timid is a masturbator; but there is a certain timorousness\r\nwhich seems to arise from a sense of shame or fear of discovery that\r\nmany victims of this vice exhibit, and which may be distinguished from\r\nnatural modesty by a little experience. One very common mode of\r\nmanifestation of this timidity is the inability to look a superior,\r\nor any person who is esteemed pure, in the eye. If spoken to, instead\r\nof looking directly at the person to whom he addresses an answer, the\r\nmasturbator looks to one side, or lets his eyes fall upon the ground,\r\nseemingly conscious that the eye is a wonderful tell-tale of the secrets\r\nof the mind.\r\n\r\n13. _Unnatural boldness_, in marked contrast with the preceding sign,\r\nis manifested by a certain class of victims. It can be as easily\r\ndistinguished, however, as unnatural timidity. The individual seems\r\nto have not the slightest appreciation of propriety. He commits openly\r\nthe most uncouth acts, if he does not manifest the most indecent\r\nunchastity of manner. When spoken to, he stares rudely at the person\r\naddressing him, often with a very unpleasant leer upon his countenance.\r\nIn some few cases there seems to be a curious combination of conditions.\r\nWhile mentally fearful, timid, and hesitating, the individual finds\r\nhimself, upon addressing a person, staring at him in the most ungainly\r\nmanner. He is conscious of his ill manners, but is powerless to control\r\nhimself. This sign is one which could hardly be of use to any except\r\na very close observer, however, as few can read upon the countenance\r\nthe operations of the mind.\r\n\r\n14. _Mock piety_--or perhaps we should more properly designate it as\r\nmistaken piety--is another peculiar manifestation of the effects of\r\nthis vicious practice. The victim is observed to become transformed,\r\nby degrees, from a romping, laughing child, full of hilarity and frolic,\r\nto a sober and very sedate little--Christian, the friends think, and\r\nthey are highly gratified with the piety of the child. Little do they\r\nsuspect the real cause of the solemn face; not the slightest suspicion\r\nhave they of the foul orgies practiced by the little sinner. By the\r\naid of friends he may soon add hypocrisy to his other crimes, and find\r\nin assumed devotion a ready pretense for seeking solitude. Parents will\r\ndo well to investigate the origin of this kind of religion in their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n15. _Easily frightened_ children are abundant among young masturbators,\r\nthough all easily frightened persons are not vicious. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the vice greatly exaggerates natural fear, and creates\r\nan unnatural apprehensiveness. The victim's mind is constantly filled\r\nwith vague forebodings of evil. He often looks behind him, looks into\r\nall the closets, peeps under the bed, and is constantly expressing fears\r\nof impending evil. Such movements are the result of a diseased\r\nimagination, and they may justly give rise to suspicion.\r\n\r\n16. _Confusion of ideas_ is another characteristic of the devotee of\r\nthis artful vice. If he attempts to argue, his points are not clearly\r\nmade. He may be superficially quick and cute, but is incapable of deep\r\nthought, or abstruse reasoning; is often very dull of apprehension.\r\nIdeas are not presented in logical order, but seem to fall out\r\npromiscuously, and fairly represent the condition of a disordered brain.\r\nAttempts at joking are generally failures, as the jest is sure to be\r\ninappropriate or vulgar, and no one but himself sees any occasion for\r\nlaughter except at his stupidity. Such individuals are not scarce.\r\n\r\n17. Boys in whom the habit has become well developed sometimes manifest\r\na decided aversion to the society of girls; but this is not nearly so\r\noften the case as some authors seem to indicate. It would rather appear\r\nthat the opposite is more often true. Girls usually show an increasing\r\nfondness for the society of boys, and are very prone to exhibit marked\r\nevidences of real wantonness.\r\n\r\n18. _Round shoulders_ and a stooping posture in sitting are\r\ncharacteristics of young masturbators of both sexes. Whenever a child\r\nseats himself, the head and shoulders droop forward, giving to the spine\r\na curved appearance.\r\n\r\n19. _Weak backs, pains in the limbs, and stiffness of the joints_, in\r\nchildren, are familiar signs of the habit. To the first of these\r\nconditions is due the habitual stooping posture assumed by these\r\nchildren. The habit referred to is not the only cause of these\r\nconditions, but its causative occurrence is sufficiently frequent to\r\ngive it no small importance as a suspicious indication.\r\n\r\n20. _Paralysis_ of the lower extremities, coming on without apparent\r\ncause, is not infrequently the result of solitary indulgence, even in\r\nvery small children. We have seen several cases in which this condition\r\nwas traced to the habit of masturbation, in children under six years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n21. The _gait_ of a person addicted to this vice will usually betray\r\nhim to one who has learned to distinguish the peculiarities which almost\r\nalways mark the walk of such persons. In a child, a dragging, shuffling\r\nwalk is to be suspected. Boys, in walking rapidly, show none of that\r\nelasticity which characterizes a natural gait, but walk as if they had\r\nbeen stiffened in the hips, and as though their legs were pegs attached\r\nto the body by hinges. The girl wriggles along in a style quite as\r\ncharacteristic, though more difficult to detect with certainty, as\r\nfemales are often so \"affected\" in their walk. Unsteadiness of gait\r\nis an evidence seen in both sexes, especially in advanced cases.\r\n\r\n22. _Bad positions_ in bed are evidences which should be noticed. If\r\na child lies constantly upon its abdomen, or is often found with its\r\nhands about the genitals, it may be at least considered in a fair way\r\nto acquire the habit if it has not already done so.\r\n\r\n23. _Lack of development of the breasts_ in females, after puberty,\r\nis a common result of self-pollution. Still it would be entirely unsafe\r\nto say that every female with small mammary glands had been addicted\r\nto this vice, especially at the present time when a fair natural\r\ndevelopment is often destroyed by the constant pressure and heat of\r\n\"pads.\" But this sign may well be given a due bearing.\r\n\r\n24. _Capricious appetite_ particularly characterizes children\r\naddicted to secret vice. At the commencement of the practice, they\r\nalmost invariably manifest great voracity for food, gorging themselves\r\nin the most gluttonous manner. As the habit becomes fixed, digestion\r\nbecomes impaired, and the appetite is sometimes almost wanting, and\r\nat other times almost unappeasable.\r\n\r\n25. One very constant peculiarity of such children is their extreme\r\nfondness for unnatural, hurtful, and irritating articles. Nearly all\r\nare greatly attached to salt, pepper, spices, cinnamon, cloves, vinegar,\r\nmustard, horse-radish, and similar articles, and use them in most\r\ninordinate quantities. A boy or girl who is constantly eating cloves\r\nor cinnamon, or who will eat salt in quantities without other food,\r\ngives good occasion for suspicion.\r\n\r\n26. _Eating clay, slate-pencils, plaster, chalk,_ and other\r\nindigestible articles is a practice to which girls who abuse themselves\r\nare especially addicted. The habit sometimes becomes developed to such\r\na wonderful extent that the victims almost rival the clay-eaters of\r\nthe Amazon in gratifying their propensity.\r\n\r\n27. Disgust for simple food is one of the traits which a victim of this\r\nvice is sure to possess. He seems to loathe any food which is not\r\nrendered hot and stimulating with spices and other condiments, and\r\ncannot be induced to eat it.\r\n\r\n28. _The use of tobacco_ is good presumptive evidence that a boy is\r\nalso addicted to a practice still more filthy. Exceptions to this rule\r\nare very rare indeed, if they exist, which we somewhat doubt. The same\r\ninfluences which would lead a boy to the use of tobacco would also lead\r\nhim to solitary vice, and each sin would serve to exaggerate the other.\r\n\r\n29. _Unnatural paleness_ and colorless lips, unless they can be\r\notherwise accounted for, may be attributed to secret sin. The face is\r\na great tell-tale against this class of sinners. Justice demands,\r\nhowever, that an individual should be given the benefit of a doubt so\r\nlong as there is a chance for the production of these symptoms by any\r\nother known cause, as overwork, mental anxiety, or dyspepsia.\r\n\r\n30. _Acne_, or _pimples_, on the face are also among the suspicious\r\nsigns, especially when they appear upon the forehead as well as upon\r\nother portions of the face. Occasional pimples upon the chin are very\r\ncommon in both sexes at puberty and for a few years afterward, but are\r\nwithout significance, except that the blood may be somewhat gross from\r\nunwholesome diet or lack of exercise.\r\n\r\n31. _Biting the finger nails_ is a practice very common in girls\r\naddicted to this vice. In such persons there will also be found, not\r\ninfrequently, slight soreness or ulceration at the roots of the nails,\r\nand warts, one or more, upon one or both the first two fingers of the\r\nhand--usually the right.\r\n\r\n32. The eyes often betray much. If, in addition to want of luster and\r\nnatural brilliancy, they are sunken, present red edges, are somewhat\r\nsore, perhaps, and are surrounded by a dark ring, the patient,\r\nespecially if a child, should be suspected and carefully watched. It\r\nshould be observed, however, that dyspepsia, debility from any cause,\r\nand especially loss of sleep, will produce some or all of these signs,\r\nand no one should be accused of the vice upon the evidence of these\r\nindications alone, neither could he be justly suspected so long as his\r\nsymptoms could be accounted for by legitimate causes.\r\n\r\n33. An habitually moist, cold hand, is a suspicious circumstance in\r\na young person who is not known to be suffering from some constitutional\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n34. _Palpitation of the heart_, frequently occurring, denotes a\r\ncondition of nervous disturbance which has some powerful cause, and\r\nwhich may often be found to be the vice in question.\r\n\r\n35. _Hysteria_ in females may be regarded as a suspicious circumstance\r\nwhen frequently occurring on very slight occasions, and especially if\r\nthere is no hereditary tendency to the disease.\r\n\r\n36. _Chlorosis_, or _green sickness_, is very often caused by the unholy\r\npractice under consideration. It is very commonly attributed, when\r\noccurring in young women, to menstrual derangements; but it is only\r\nnecessary to remember that these menstrual irregularities are in many\r\ncases the result of the same habit, as has been already pointed out.\r\n\r\n37. _Epileptic fits_ in children are not infrequently the result of\r\nvicious habits.\r\n\r\n38. _Wetting the bed_ is an evidence of irritation which may be\r\nconnected with the practice; it should be looked after.\r\n\r\n39. _Unchastity of speech_ and fondness for obscene stories betray a\r\ncondition of mind which does not exist in youth who are not addicted\r\nto this vice.\r\n\r\nAs previously remarked, no single one of the above signs should be\r\nconsidered as conclusive evidence of the habit in any individual; but\r\nany one of them may, and should, arouse suspicion and watchfulness.\r\nIf the habit really exists, but a short time will elapse before other\r\nsigns will be noticed, and when several point in the same direction,\r\nthe evidence may be considered nearly, if not quite, conclusive. But\r\npersistent watching will enable the positive signs to be detected\r\nsooner or later, and then there can no longer be doubt. It is, of course,\r\nnecessary to give the individual no suspicion that he is being watched,\r\nas that would put him so effectually on his guard as, possibly, to defy\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\nPositive Signs.--The absolutely positive signs of solitary vice are\r\nvery few. Of course the most certainly positive of all is detection\r\nin the act. Sometimes this is difficult, with such consummate cunning\r\ndo the devotees of this Moloch pursue their debasing practice. If a\r\nchild is noticed to seek a certain secluded spot with considerable\r\nregularity, he should be carefully followed and secretly watched, for\r\nseveral days in succession if need be. Many children pursue the practice\r\nat night after retiring. If the suspected one is observed to become\r\nvery quickly quiet after retiring, and when looked at appears to be\r\nasleep, the bedclothes should be quickly thrown off under some pretense.\r\nIf, in the case of a boy, the penis is found in a state of erection,\r\nwith the hands near the genitals, he may certainly be treated as a\r\nmasturbator without any error. If he is found in a state of excitement,\r\nin connection with the other evidences, with a quickened circulation\r\nas indicated by the pulse, or in a state of perspiration, his guilt\r\nis certain, even though he may pretend to be asleep; no doubt he has\r\nbeen addicted to the vice for a considerable time to have acquired so\r\nmuch cunning. If the same course is pursued with girls, under the same\r\ncircumstances, the clitoris will be found congested, with the other\r\ngenital organs, which will also be moist from increased secretion.\r\nOther conditions will be as nearly as possible the same as those in\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\nStains upon the night shirt or sheets, occurring before puberty, are\r\ncertain evidences of the vice in boys, as they are subject, before that\r\ntime, to no discharge which will leave a stain resembling that from\r\nthe seminal fluid, except the rare one from piles. In the very young,\r\nthese stains do not occur; but when the habit is acquired before puberty,\r\na discharge resembling semen takes place before the ordinary period.\r\nOf course, the stains from urine will be easily distinguished from\r\nothers. The frequent occurrence of such stains after puberty is a\r\nsuspicious circumstance. A discharge in some respects similar may occur\r\nin girls.\r\n\r\nBefore puberty, the effect of the vice upon the genital organs is to\r\ncause an unnatural development, in both sexes, of the sensitive\r\nportions. When this is marked, it is pretty conclusive evidence of the\r\nvice. In girls, the vagina often becomes unnaturally enlarged, and\r\nleucorrhoea is often present. After puberty, the organs usually\r\ndiminish in size, and become unnaturally lax and shrunken.\r\n\r\nAll of these signs should be thoroughly mastered by those who have\r\nchildren under their care, and if not continually watching for them,\r\nwhich would be an unpleasant task, such should be on the alert to detect\r\nthe signs at once when they appear, and then carefully seek for others\r\nuntil there is no longer any doubt about the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF SECRET VICE.\r\n\r\nThe physician rarely meets more forlorn objects than the victims of\r\nprolonged self-abuse. These unfortunate beings he meets every day of\r\nhis life, and listens so often to the same story of shameful abuse and\r\nretributive suffering that he dreads to hear it repeated. In these cases,\r\nthere is usually a horrid sameness--the same cause, the same inevitable\r\nresults. In most cases, the patient need not utter a word, for the\r\nphysician can read in his countenance his whole history, as can most\r\nother people at all conversant with the subject.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the greatest completeness consistent with necessary\r\nbrevity, we will describe the effects observed in males and those in\r\nfemales under separate heads, noticing the symptoms of each morbid\r\ncondition in connection with its description.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS IN MALES.\r\n\r\nWe shall describe, first, the local effects, then the general effects,\r\nphysical and mental.\r\n\r\nLocal Effects.--Excitement of the genital organs produces the most\r\nintense congestion. No other organs in the body are capable of such\r\nrapid and enormous engorgement. When the act is frequently repeated,\r\nthis condition becomes permanent in some of the tissues, particularly\r\nin the mucous membrane lining the urethra. This same membrane continues\r\ninto and lines throughout the bladder, kidneys, and all the urinary\r\norgans, together with the vesiculae seminales, the ejaculatory ducts,\r\nthe vasa deferentia, and the testes. In consequence of this continuity\r\nof tissue, any irritation affecting one part is liable to extend to\r\nanother, or to all the rest. We mention this anatomical fact here as\r\na help to the understanding of the different morbid conditions which\r\nwill be noticed.\r\n\r\n_Urethral Irritation_.--The chronic congestion of the urethra after\r\na time becomes chronic irritability. The tissue is unusually sensitive,\r\nthis condition being often indicated by a slight smarting in urination.\r\nIt often extends throughout the whole length of the urethra, and becomes\r\nso intense that the passage of a sound, which would occasion little\r\nif any sensation in a healthy organ, produces the most acute pain, as\r\nwe have observed in numerous instances, even when the greatest care\r\nwas used in the introduction of the instrument.\r\n\r\nShooting pains are often felt in the organ, due to this irritation.\r\nPain is in some cases most felt at the root, in others, at the head.\r\nIt often darts from one point to another. Just before and just after\r\nurination the pain is most severe.\r\n\r\n_Stricture_.--Long-continued irritation of the mucous membrane of the\r\nurethra produces, ultimately, inflammation and swelling of the same\r\nin some portion of its extent. This condition may become permanent,\r\nand then constitutes real stricture, a most serious disease. More often\r\nthe swelling is but transient, being due to some unusual excess, and\r\nwill subside. Sometimes, also, a temporary stricture is produced by\r\nspasmodic contraction of the muscular fibers surrounding the urethra,\r\nwhich is excited by the local irritation. This kind of stricture is\r\noften met in the treatment of spermatorrhoea.\r\n\r\nEnlarged Prostate.--This painful affection is a frequent result of the\r\nchronic irritation in the urethra, which the gland surrounds, the\r\nmorbid action being communicated to it by its proximity. A diseased\r\naction is set up which results in enlargement and hardening. It is felt\r\nas a hard body just anterior to the anus, and becomes by pressure the\r\nsource of much additional mischief. Sometimes the disease progresses\r\nto dangerous ulceration. It is attended by heat, pressure, and pain\r\nbetween the anus and the root of the penis.\r\n\r\nUrinary Diseases.--The same congestion and irritability extend to the\r\nbladder and thence to the kidneys, producing irritation and\r\ninflammation of those organs. Mucus is often formed in large\r\nquantities; sometimes much is retained in the bladder. Earthy matter\r\nis deposited, which becomes entangled in the mucus, and thus a\r\nconcretion or stone is produced, occasioning much suffering, and\r\nperhaps death.\r\n\r\nWe saw, not long since, a case of this kind. The patient was nearly\r\nsixty years of age, and had practiced masturbation from childhood. In\r\nconsequence of his vice, a chronic irritation of the urethra had been\r\nproduced, which was followed by enlargement of the prostate, then by\r\nchronic irritation of the bladder and the formation of stone. His\r\nsufferings were most excruciating whenever he attempted to urinate,\r\nwhich was only accomplished with the greatest difficulty and suffering.\r\n\r\nOne of the unpleasant results of irritation of the lining membrane of\r\nthe bladder is inability to retain the urine long, which requires\r\nfrequent urination and often causes incontinence of urine.\r\n\r\n_Priapism_.--This same morbid sensitiveness may produce priapism, or\r\ncontinuous and painful erection, one of the most \"terrible and\r\nhumiliating conditions,\" as Dr. Acton says, to which the human body\r\nis subject. The horrid desperation of patients suffering under this\r\ncondition is almost inconceivable. It is, fortunately, rare, in its\r\nmost severe forms; but hundreds suffer from it to a most painful degree\r\nas one of the punishments of transgression of nature's laws; and a most\r\nterrible punishment it is.\r\n\r\n_Piles, Prolapsus of Rectum, etc._--As the result of the straining\r\ncaused by stricture, piles, prolapsus of the rectum, and fissure of\r\nthe anus are not infrequently induced, as the following case observed\r\nat Charity Hospital, New York, illustrates:--\r\n\r\nThe patient had a peculiar deformity of the genital organs,\r\n_hypospadias_, which prevented sexual intercourse, in consequence of\r\nwhich he gave himself up to the practice of self-abuse. He had become\r\nreduced to the most deplorable condition of both mind and body, and\r\npresented a most woebegone countenance. In addition to his general\r\nailments, he suffered from extreme prolapsus of the rectum and a most\r\npainful anal fissure. His condition was somewhat bettered by skillful\r\nsurgical treatment.\r\n\r\n_Extension of Irritation_.--Serious and painful as are the affections\r\nalready noticed, those which arise from the extension of the congestion\r\nand irritation of the urethra to those other organs most intimately\r\nconnected with the function of generation are still more dreadful in\r\nthemselves, and far more serious in their consequences. The irritation\r\nextends into the ejaculatory ducts, thence backward into the seminal\r\nvesicles, and downward through the vasa deferentia to the testes. These\r\norgans become unnaturally excited, and their activity is increased.\r\nThe testicles form an abnormal amount of spermatozoa; the seminal\r\nvesicles secrete their peculiar fluid too freely. From these two\r\nsources combined, the vesicles become loaded with seminal fluid, and\r\nthis condition gives rise to a great increase of sexual excitement.\r\n\r\nIn cases of long standing, the irritation of the urethra at the openings\r\nof the ejaculatory ducts, a point just in front of the bladder, advances\r\nto inflammation and ulceration. Here is now established a permanent\r\nsource of irritation, by which the morbid activity of the testes and\r\nseminal vesicles is kept up and continually increased. This condition\r\nis indicated by frequent twitchings of the ejaculatory and compressor\r\nmuscles in the perineum. It is also indicated by a burning sensation\r\nat the root of the penis after urination, which, in severe cases,\r\namounts to very serious pain.\r\n\r\n_Atrophy, or Wasting of the Testes_.--The first result of the\r\nirritation communicated to the testes, is, as already remarked,\r\nincreased activity; but this is attended by swelling in some cases,\r\nmore or less pain, tenderness, and, after a time, diminution in size.\r\n\r\nThis degenerative process likewise affects the seminal fluid, which\r\nbecomes more or less deteriorated and incapable of producing healthy\r\noffspring, even while it retains the power of fecundating the ovum,\r\nwhich it also ultimately loses if the disease is not checked by proper\r\ntreatment, when the individual becomes hopelessly impotent, a happy\r\nresult for the race, for it prevents the possibility of his imparting\r\nto another being his debilitated constitution.\r\n\r\n_Varicocele_.--This morbid condition consists in a varicose state of\r\nthe spermatic veins. It is almost always found upon the left side, owing\r\nto an anatomical peculiarity of the spermatic vein of that side. It\r\nhas been supposed to be a result of masturbation and its effects, but\r\nis certainly caused otherwise in many cases. It is not infrequently\r\nfound in these patients; but Prof. Bartholow contends that even in such\r\ncases we should \"consider its presence, in general, as accidental.\"\r\nAtrophy of the left testicle is often produced by the pressure of the\r\ndistended veins; but this does not produce impotence. It occasionally\r\noccurs simultaneously on both sides, and greatly aggravates the effects\r\nof self-abuse, if it is not itself an effect of the vice.\r\n\r\nNocturnal Emissions.--Seminal emissions during sleep, usually\r\naccompanied by erotic dreams, are known as nocturnal pollutions or\r\nemissions, and are often called _spermatorrhoea_, though there is some\r\ndisagreement respecting the use of the latter term. Its most proper\r\nuse is when applied to the entire group of symptoms which accompany\r\ninvoluntary seminal losses.\r\n\r\nThe masturbator knows nothing of this disease so long as he continues\r\nhis vile practice; but when he resolves to reform, and ceases to defile\r\nhimself voluntarily, he is astonished and disgusted to find that the\r\nsame filthy pollutions occur during his sleep without his voluntary\r\nparticipation. He now begins to see something of the ruin he has wrought.\r\nThe same nightly loss continues, sometimes being repeated several times\r\nin a single night, to his infinite mortification and chagrin. He hopes\r\nthe difficulty will subside of itself, but his hope is vain; unless\r\nproperly treated, it will probably continue until the ruin which he\r\nvoluntarily began is completed.\r\n\r\nThis disease is the result of sexual excesses of any kind; it is common\r\nin married men who have abused the marriage relation, when they are\r\nforced to temporary continence from any cause. It also occurs in those\r\naddicted to mental unchastity, though they may be physically continent.\r\nIt is not probable that it would ever occur in a person who had been\r\nstrictly continent and had not allowed his mind to dwell upon libidinous\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\nExciting Causes.--The exciting causes which serve to perpetuate this\r\ndifficulty are chiefly two; viz., local irritation and lewd thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe first cause is usually chiefly located in the urethra, and\r\nespecially at the mouths of the ejaculatory ducts. Distention of the\r\nseminal vesicles with a superabundance of seminal fluid also acts as\r\na source of irritation. Constipation, worms, and piles have an\r\nirritative influence which is often very seriously felt.\r\n\r\nUnchaste thoughts act detrimentally in a two-fold way. They first\r\nstimulate the activity of the testes, thus increasing the overloading\r\nof the seminal vesicles. Lascivious thoughts during wakefulness are\r\nthe chief cause of lascivious dreams.\r\n\r\nEmissions do not usually occur during the soundest sleep, but during\r\nthat condition which may be characterized as dozing, which is most often\r\nindulged in early in the morning after the soundest sleep is passed.\r\nThis fact has an important bearing upon treatment, as will be seen\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nAt first, the emissions are always accompanied by dreams, the patient\r\nusually awaking immediately afterward; but after a time they take place\r\nwithout dreams and without awaking him, and are unaccompanied by\r\nsensation. This denotes a greatly increased gravity of the complaint.\r\n\r\nCertain circumstances greatly increase the frequency of the emissions,\r\nand thus hasten the injury which they are certain to accomplish if not\r\nchecked; as, neglect to relieve the bladder and bowels at night, late\r\nsuppers, stimulating foods and drinks, and anything that will excite\r\nthe genital organs. Of all causes, amorous or erotic thoughts are the\r\nmost powerful. Tea and coffee, spices and other condiments, and animal\r\nfood have a special tendency in this direction. Certain positions in\r\nbed also serve as exciting or predisposing causes; as sleeping upon\r\nthe back or abdomen. Feather beds and pillows and too warm covering\r\nin bed are also injurious for the same reason.\r\n\r\nIn frequency, emissions will vary in different persons from an\r\noccasional one at long and irregular intervals to two or three a week,\r\nor several--as many as four in one case we have met--in a single night.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of an emission will depend somewhat upon the\r\nfrequency of occurrence and the condition of the individual. If very\r\ninfrequent, and occurring in a comparatively robust person, after the\r\nseminal vesicles have become distended with seminal fluid, the\r\nimmediate effect of an emission may be a sensation of temporary relief.\r\nThis circumstance has led certain persons to suppose that emissions\r\nare natural and beneficial. This point will receive attention shortly.\r\n\r\nIf the emissions are more frequent, or if they occur in a person of\r\na naturally feeble constitution, the immediate effect is lassitude,\r\nlanguor, indisposition and often inability to perform severe mental\r\nor physical labor, melancholy, amounting often to despair and even\r\nleading to suicide, and an exaggeration of local irritation, and of\r\nall the morbid conditions to be noticed under the head of \"General\r\nEffects.\" Headache, indigestion, weakness of the back and knees,\r\ndisturbed circulation, dimness of vision, and loss of appetite, are\r\nonly a few of these.\r\n\r\nAre Occasional Emissions Necessary or Harmless?--That an individual\r\nmay suffer for years an involuntary seminal loss as frequently as once\r\na month without apparently suffering very great injury, seems to be\r\na settled fact with physicians of extensive experience, and is well\r\nconfirmed by observation; yet there are those who suffer severely from\r\nlosses no more frequent than this. But when seminal losses occur more\r\nfrequently than once a month, they will certainly ultimate in great\r\ninjury, even though immediate ill effects are not noticed, as in\r\nexceptional cases they may not be. If argument is necessary to sustain\r\nthis position, as it hardly seems to be, we would refer to the fact\r\nthat seminal losses do not occur in those who are, and always have been,\r\ncontinent both mentally and physically, when such rare individuals can\r\nbe found. They occur the most rarely in those who the most nearly\r\napproach the standard of perfect chastity; so that whenever they occur,\r\nthey may be taken as evidence of some form of sexual excess. This fact\r\nclearly shows that losses of this kind are not natural.\r\n\r\nEmission not Necessary to Health.--If it be argued that an occasional\r\nemission is necessary to relieve the overloaded seminal vesicles, we\r\nreply, the same argument has been used as an apology for unchastity;\r\nbut it is equally worthless in both instances. It might be as well argued\r\nthat vomiting is a necessary physiological and healthful act, and\r\nshould occur with regularity, because a person may so overload his\r\nstomach as to make the act necessary as a remedial measure. Vomiting\r\nis a diseased action, a pathological process, and is occasioned by the\r\nvoluntary transgression of the individual. Hence, it is as unnecessary\r\nas gluttony, and must be wasteful of vitality, even though rendered\r\nnecessary under some circumstances. So with emissions. If a person\r\nallows his mind to dwell upon unchaste subjects, indulges in erotic\r\ndreams, and riots in mental lasciviousness, he may render an emission\r\nalmost necessary as a remedial effort. Nevertheless, he will suffer\r\nfrom the loss of the vital fluid just the same as though he had not,\r\nby his own concupiscence, rendered it in some degree necessary. And\r\nas it would have been infinitely better for him to have retained and\r\ndigested food in his stomach instead of ejecting it--provided it were\r\nwholesome food--so it would have been better for him to have retained\r\nin his system the seminal fluid, which would have been disposed of by\r\nthe system and probably utilized to very great advantage in the repair\r\nof certain of the tissues.\r\n\r\nEminent Testimony.--An eminent English physician, Dr. Milton, who has\r\ntreated many thousands of cases of this disease, remarks in a work upon\r\nthe subject as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Anything beyond one emission a month requires attention. I know this\r\nstatement has been impugned, but I am quite prepared to abide by it.\r\nI did not put it forward till I considered I had quite sufficient\r\nevidence in my hands to justify me in doing so.\"\r\n\r\n\"An opinion prevails, as most of my readers are aware, among medical\r\nmen, that a few emissions in youth do good instead of harm. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how an unnatural evacuation can do good, except\r\nin the case of unnatural congestion. I have, however, convinced myself\r\nthat the principle is wrong. Lads never really feel better for\r\nemissions; they very often feel decidedly worse. Occasionally they may\r\nfancy there is a sense of relief, but it is very much the same sort\r\nof relief that a drunkard feels from a dram. In early life the stomach\r\nmay be repeatedly overloaded with impunity, but I suppose few would\r\ncontend that overloading was therefore good. The fact is that emissions\r\nare invariably more or less injurious; not always visibly so in youth,\r\nnor susceptible of being assessed as to the damage inflicted by any\r\ngiven number of them, but still contributing, each in its turn, a mite\r\ntoward the exhaustion and debility which the patient will one day\r\ncomplain of.\"\r\n\r\nDiurnal Emissions.--As the disease progresses, the irritation and\r\nweakness of the organs become so great that an erection and emission\r\noccur upon the slightest sexual excitement. Mere proximity to a female,\r\nor the thought of one, will be sufficient to produce a pollution,\r\nattended by voluptuous sensations. But after a time the organs become\r\nso diseased and irritable that the slightest mechanical irritation,\r\nas friction of the clothing, the sitting posture, or riding horseback,\r\nwill produce a discharge which may or may not be attended by sensation\r\nof any kind. Frequently a burning or more or less painful sensation\r\noccurs; erection does not take place. Even straining at stool will\r\nproduce the discharge, or violent efforts to retain the feces when there\r\nis unnatural looseness.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the discharge may vary from a few drops to one or two\r\ndrams, or even more. The character of the discharge is of considerable\r\nimportance. When it occurs under the circumstances last described, viz.,\r\nwithout erection or voluptuous sensations, it may be of a true seminal\r\ncharacter, or it may contain no spermatozoa. This point can be\r\ndetermined by the microscope alone. The discharge is the result of\r\nsexual excitement or irritation, nevertheless, and indicates a most\r\ndeplorable condition of the genital organs. The patient is sometimes\r\nunnecessarily frightened by it, and often exaggerates the amount of\r\nthe losses, and the symptoms arising from them. However, when a single\r\nnocturnal emission occasions such detrimental results, what must be\r\nthe effect of repeated discharges occurring several times a day, or\r\nevery time an individual relieves his bowels, urinates, or entertains\r\nan unvirtuous thought! If the losses were always seminal, the work of\r\nruin would soon be complete; fortunately, those discharges which are\r\nthe most frequent are only occasionally of a true seminal character.\r\nIt is not true, however, as has been claimed by some writers, one at\r\nleast, that they are never seminal, as we have proved by repeated\r\nmicroscopic examinations.\r\n\r\nCause of Diurnal Emissions.--The causes of these discharges are\r\nspasmodic action of the muscles involved in ejaculation, which is\r\noccasioned by local irritation, and pressure upon the seminal vesicles\r\nby the distended rectum or bladder. They denote a condition of debility\r\nand irritation which may well occasion grave alarm.\r\n\r\nIn occasional instances, the internal irritation reaches such a height\r\nthat blood is discharged with the seminal fluid.\r\n\r\nInternal Emissions.--As the disease progresses, external discharges\r\nfinally cease, in some cases, or partially so, and the individual is\r\nencouraged by that circumstance to think that he is recovering. He soon\r\ndiscovers his error, however, for he continues to droop even though\r\nthe discharges apparently cease altogether. This seems a mystery until\r\nsome medical friend or a medical work calls his attention to the fact\r\nthat the discharges now occur internally instead of externally, the\r\nseminal fluid passing back into the bladder and being voided with the\r\nurine. An examination of the urine reveals the presence of cloudy matter\r\nappearing much like mucus, or a whitish sediment. A microscopic\r\nexamination shows this matter to be composed largely of zoosperms,\r\nwhich decides its origin.\r\n\r\nAn Important Caution.--It is necessary, however, to caution the reader\r\nnot to pronounce every whitish sediment or flocculent matter found in\r\nthe urine to be a seminal discharge, for the great majority are of a\r\ndifferent character. They are, most frequently, simply mucus or\r\nphosphates from the bladder. Seminal fluid cannot be distinguished from\r\nmucus by any other than a careful microscopic examination. A microscope\r\nof good quality and capable of magnifying at least one hundred and fifty\r\ndiameters is required, together with considerable skill in the operator.\r\nQuacks have done an immense amount of harm by frightening patients into\r\nthe belief that they were suffering from discharges of this kind when\r\nthere was, in fact, nothing more than a copious deposit of phosphates,\r\nwhich is not at all infrequent in nervous people, especially after\r\neating.\r\n\r\nWhen the condition described does really exist, however, the patient\r\ncannot make too much haste to put himself under the care of a competent\r\nphysician for treatment. If there is even a reasonable suspicion that\r\nit may exist, he should have his urine carefully examined by one\r\ncompetent to criticize it intelligently.\r\n\r\nBy many authors, the term spermatorrhoea is confined entirely to this\r\nstage of the disease.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the forcible interruption of ejaculation has been the\r\ncause of this unfortunate condition in many cases. Such a proceeding\r\nis certainly very hazardous.\r\n\r\nOne more caution should be offered; viz., that the occasional presence\r\nof spermatozoa in the urine is not a proof of the existence of internal\r\nemissions, as a few zoosperms may be left in the urethra after a\r\nvoluntary or nocturnal emission, and thus find their way into the urine\r\nas it is discharged from the bladder.\r\n\r\nImpotence.--In the progress of the disease a point is finally reached\r\nwhen the victim not only loses all desire for the natural exercise of\r\nthe sexual function, but when such an act becomes impossible. This\r\ncondition may have been reached even before all of the preceding\r\nsymptoms have been developed. Ultimately it becomes impossible to\r\nlonger practice the abominable vice itself, on account of the great\r\ndegeneration and relaxation of the organs. The approach of this\r\ncondition is indicated by increasing loss of erectile power, which is\r\nat first only temporary, but afterward becomes permanent. Still the\r\ninvoluntary discharges continue, and the victim sees himself gradually\r\nsinking lower and lower into the pit which his own hands have dug. The\r\nmisery of his condition is unimaginable; manhood lost, body a wreck,\r\nand death staring him in the face.\r\n\r\nThis is a brief sketch of the local effects of the horrid vice of\r\nself-abuse. The description has not been at all overdrawn. We have yet\r\nto consider the general effects, some of which have already been\r\nincidentally touched upon in describing nocturnal emissions, with\r\ntheir immediate results.\r\n\r\nGeneral Effects.--The many serious effects which follow the habit of\r\nself-abuse, in addition to those terrible local maladies already\r\ndescribed, are the direct results of two causes in the male; viz.,\r\n\r\n1. Nervous exhaustion;\r\n\r\n2. Loss of the seminal fluid.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to which one of these was the cause\r\nof the effects observed in these cases. Some have attributed all the\r\nevil to one cause, and some to the other. That the loss of semen is\r\nnot the only cause, nor, perhaps, the chief source of injury, is proved\r\nby the fact that most deplorable effects of the vice are seen in children\r\nbefore puberty, and also in females, in whom no seminal discharge nor\r\nanything analogous to it occurs. In these cases, it is the nervous shock\r\nalone which works the evil.\r\n\r\nAgain, that the seminal fluid is the most highly vitalized of all the\r\nfluids of the body, and that its rapid production is at the expense\r\nof a most exhaustive effort on the part of the vital forces, is well\r\nattested by all physiologists. It is further believed by some eminent\r\nphysicians that the seminal fluid is of great use in the body for\r\nbuilding up and replenishing certain tissues, especially those of the\r\nnerves and brain, being absorbed after secretion. Though this view is\r\nnot coincided in by all physiologists, it seems to be supported by the\r\nfollowing facts:--\r\n\r\n1. The composition of the nerves and that of spermatozoa is nearly\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\n2. Men from whom the testes have been removed before puberty, as in\r\nthe case of eunuchs, are never fully developed as they would otherwise\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nThe nervous shock accompanying the exercise of the sexual\r\norgans--either natural or unnatural--is the most profound to which the\r\nsystem is subject. The whole nervous system is called into activity;\r\nand the effects are occasionally so strongly felt upon a weakened\r\norganism that death results in the very act. The subsequent exhaustion\r\nis necessarily proportionate to the excitement.\r\n\r\nIt need not be surprising, then, that the effects of the frequent\r\noperation of two such powerful influences combined should be so\r\nterrible as they are found to be.\r\n\r\n_General Debility_.--Nervous exhaustion and the loss of the vivifying\r\ninfluence of the seminal fluid produce extreme mental and physical\r\ndebility, which increases as the habit is practiced, and is continued\r\nby involuntary emissions after the habit ceases. If the patient's\r\nhabits are sedentary, and if he had a delicate constitution at the start,\r\nhis progress toward the grave will be fearfully rapid, especially if\r\nthe habit were acquired young, as it most frequently is by such boys,\r\nthey being generally precocious. Extreme emaciation, sallow or\r\nblotched skin, sunken eyes, surrounded by a dark or blue color, general\r\nweakness, dullness, weak back, stupidity, laziness, or indisposition\r\nto activity of any kind, wandering and illy defined pains, obscure and\r\noften terrible sensations, pain in back and limbs, sleeplessness, and\r\na train of morbid symptoms too long to mention in detail, attend these\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\n_Consumption_.--It is well recognized by the medical profession that\r\nthis vice is one of the most frequent causes of consumption. At least\r\nsuch would seem to be the declaration of experience, and the following\r\nstatistical fact adds weight to the conclusion:--\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Smith read a paper before a learned medical association a few years\r\nsince in which he pointed out the startling fact that in one thousand\r\ncases of consumption five hundred and eighteen had suffered from some\r\nform of sexual abuse, and more than four hundred had been addicted to\r\nmasturbation or suffered from nocturnal emissions.\"[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Acton.]\r\n\r\n\"Most of those who early become addicted to self-pollution are soon\r\nafterward the subjects, not merely of one or more of the ailments\r\nalready noticed, but also of enlargements of the lymphatic and other\r\nglands, ultimately of _tubercular deposits in the lungs_ and other\r\nviscera, or of scrofulous disease of the vertebrae or bones, or of other\r\nstructures, more especially of the joints.\"[50]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Copland.]\r\n\r\nMany young men waste away and die of symptoms resembling consumption\r\nwhich are solely the result of the loathsome practice of self-abuse.\r\nThe real number of consumptives whose disease originates in this manner\r\ncan never be known.\r\n\r\n_Dyspepsia_.--Indigestion is frequently one of the first results.\r\nNervous exhaustion is always felt by the stomach very promptly. When\r\ndyspepsia is once really established, it reacts upon the genital organs,\r\nincreasing their irritability as well as that of all the rest of the\r\nnervous system. Now there is no end to the ills which may be suffered;\r\nfor an impaired digestion lays the system open to the inroads of almost\r\nany and every malady.\r\n\r\n_Heart Disease_.--Functional disease of the heart, indicated by\r\nexcessive palpitation on the slightest exertion, is a very frequent\r\nsymptom. Though it unfits the individual for labor, and causes him much\r\nsuffering, he would be fortunate if he escaped with no disease of a\r\nmore dangerous character.\r\n\r\n_Throat Affections_.--There is no doubt that many of the affections\r\nof the throat in young men and older ones which pass under the name\r\nof \"clergyman's sore throat\" are the direct results of masturbation\r\nand emissions.\r\n\r\nDr. Acton cites several cases in proof of this, and quotes the following\r\nletter from a young clergyman:--\r\n\r\n\"When I began the practice of masturbation, at the age of sixteen, I\r\nwas in the habit of exercising my voice regularly. The first part in\r\nwhich I felt the bad effects of that habit was in the organs of\r\narticulation. After the act, the voice wanted tone, and there was a\r\ndisagreeable feeling about the throat which made speaking a source of\r\nno pleasure to me as it had been. By-and-by, it became painful to speak\r\nafter the act. This arose from a feeling as if a morbid matter was being\r\nsecreted in the throat, so acrid that it sent tears to the eyes when\r\nspeaking, and would have taken away the breath if not swallowed. This,\r\nhowever, passed away in a day or two after the act. In the course of\r\nyears, when involuntary emissions began to impair the constitution,\r\nthis condition became permanent. The throat always feels very delicate,\r\nand there is often such irritability in it, along with this feeling\r\nof the secretion of morbid matter, as to make it impossible to speak\r\nwithout swallowing at every second or third word. This is felt even\r\nin conversation, and there is a great disinclination to attempt to speak\r\nat all. In many instances in which the throat has been supposed to give\r\nway from other causes, I have known this to be the real one. May it\r\nnot be that the general irritation always produced by the habit referred\r\nto, shows itself also in this organ, and more fully in those who are\r\nrequired habitually to exercise it?\"\r\n\r\n_Nervous Diseases_.--There is no end to the nervous affections to which\r\nthe sufferer from this vice is subject. Headaches, neuralgias, symptoms\r\nresembling hysteria, sudden alternations of heat and cold, irregular\r\nflushing of the face, and many other affections, some of the more\r\nimportant of which we will mention in detail, are his constant\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n_Epilepsy_.--This disease has been traced to the vile habit under\r\nconsideration in so many cases that it is now very certain that in many\r\ninstances this is its origin. It is of frequent occurrence in those\r\nwho have indulged in solitary vice or any other form of sexual excess.\r\nWe have seen several cases of this kind.\r\n\r\nFailure of Special Senses.--Dimness of vision, amaurosis, spots before\r\nthe eyes, with other forms of ocular weakness, are common results of\r\nthis vice. The same degeneration and premature failure occur in the\r\norgans of hearing. In fact, sensibility of all the senses becomes in\r\nsome measure diminished in old cases.\r\n\r\nSpinal Irritation.--Irritation of the spinal cord, with its resultant\r\nevils, is one of the most common of the nervous affections originating\r\nin this cause. Tenderness of the spine, numerous pains in the limbs,\r\nand spasmodic twitching of the muscles, are some of its results.\r\nParalysis, partial or complete, of the lower limbs, and even of the\r\nwhole body, is not a rare occurrence. We have seen two cases in which\r\nthis was well marked. Both patients were small boys and began to excite\r\nthe genital organs at a very early age. In one, the paralytic condition\r\nwas complete when he was held erect. The head fell forward, the arms\r\nand limbs hung down helpless, the eyes rolled upward, and the saliva\r\ndribbled from his mouth. When lying flat upon his back, he had\r\nconsiderable control of his limbs. In this case, a condition of priapism\r\nseems to have existed almost from birth, owing to congenital phimosis.\r\nHis condition was somewhat improved by circumcision. In the other case,\r\nin which phimosis also existed, there was paralysis of a few of the\r\nmuscles of the leg, which produced club-foot. Circumcision was also\r\nperformed in this case and the child returned in a few weeks completely\r\ncured, without any other application, though it had previously been\r\ntreated in a great variety of ways without success, all the usual\r\nremedies for club-foot proving ineffectual. Both of these cases\r\nappeared in the clinic of Dr. Sayre at Bellevue Hospital, and were\r\noperated upon by him.\r\n\r\nWe have recently observed several cases of spinal disease which could\r\nbe traced to no origin but masturbation. Two patients were small boys,\r\nnaturally quite intelligent. They manifested all the peculiarities of\r\nloco-motor ataxia in older persons, walking with the characteristic\r\ngait. The disease was steadily progressing in spite of all attempts\r\nto stay it. An older brother had died of the same malady, paralysis\r\nextending over the whole body, and finally preventing deglutition, so\r\nthat he really starved to death.\r\n\r\nInsanity.--That solitary vice is one of the most common causes of\r\ninsanity, is a fact too well established to need demonstration here.\r\nEvery lunatic asylum furnishes numerous illustrations of the fact.\r\n\"Authors are universally agreed, from Galen down to the present day,\r\nabout the pernicious influence of this enervating indulgence, and its\r\nstrong propensity to generate the very worst and most formidable kinds\r\nof insanity. It has frequently been known to occasion speedy, and even\r\ninstant, insanity.\"[51]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Arnold.]\r\n\r\n\"Religious insanity,\" so-called, may justly be attributed to this cause\r\nin a great proportion of cases. The individual is conscience-smitten\r\nin view of his horrid sins, and a view of his terrible condition--ruined\r\nfor both worlds, he fears--goads him to despair, and his weakened\r\nintellect fails; reason is dethroned, and he becomes a hopeless lunatic.\r\nHis friends, knowing nothing of the real cause of his mysterious\r\nconfessions of terrible sin, think him over-conscientious, and lay the\r\nblame of his insanity upon religion, when it is solely the result of\r\nhis vicious habits, of which they are ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the victim falls into a profound melancholy from which\r\nnothing can divert him. He never laughs, does not even smile. He becomes\r\nmore and more reserved and taciturn, and perhaps ends the scene by\r\ncommitting suicide. This crime is not at all uncommon with those who\r\nhave gone the whole length of the road of evil. They find their manhood\r\ngone, the vice in which they have so long delighted is no longer possible,\r\nand, in desperation, they put an end to the miserable life which nature\r\nmight lengthen out a few months if not thus violently superseded.\r\n\r\nIf the practice is continued uninterruptedly from boyhood to manhood,\r\nimbecility and idiocy are the results. Demented individuals are met\r\nin no small numbers inside of hospitals and asylums, and outside as\r\nwell, who owe to this vice their awful condition. Plenty of half-witted\r\nmen whom one meets in the every-day walks of life have destroyed the\r\nbetter half of their understanding by this wretched practice.\r\n\r\nA Victim's Mental Condition Pictured.--The mental condition of a victim\r\nof this vice cannot be better described than is done in the following\r\nparagraphs by one himself a victim, though few of these unfortunate\r\nindividuals would be able to produce so accurate and critical a portrait\r\nof themselves as is here drawn by M. Rousseau, as quoted by Mr. Acton:--\r\n\r\n\"One might say that my heart and my mind do not belong to the same person.\r\nMy feelings, quicker than lightning, fill my soul; but instead of\r\nilluminating, they burn and dazzle me. I feel everything. I see nothing.\r\nI am excited, but stupid; I cannot think except in cold blood. The\r\nwonderful thing is that I have sound enough tact, penetration, even\r\n_finesse_, if people will wait for me. I make excellent impromptus at\r\nleisure; but at the moment I have nothing ready to say or do. I should\r\nconverse brilliantly by post, as they say the Spaniards play at chess.\r\nWhen I read of a Duke of Savoy who turned back after starting on his\r\njourney to say, 'In your teeth! you Paris shop-keeper!' I said, 'That\r\nis like me!'\"\r\n\r\n\"But not only is it a labor to me to express, but also to receive, ideas.\r\nI have studied men, and I think I am a tolerably good observer; yet\r\nI can see nothing of what I do see. I can hardly say that I see anything\r\nexcept what I recall; I have no power of mind but in my recollection.\r\nOf all that is said, of all that is done, of all that passes in my\r\npresence, I feel nothing, I appreciate nothing. The external sign is\r\nall that strikes me. But after a while it all comes back to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS IN FEMALES.\r\n\r\nLocal Effects.--The local diseases produced by the vice in females are,\r\nof course, of a different nature from those seen in males, on account\r\nof the difference in organization. They arise, however, in the same\r\nway, congestions at first temporary ultimately becoming permanent and\r\nresulting in irritation and various disorders.\r\n\r\nLeucorrhoea.--The results of congestion first appear in the mucous\r\nmembrane lining the vagina, which is also injured by mechanical\r\nirritation, and consists of a catarrhal discharge which enervates the\r\nsystem. By degrees the discharge increases in quantity and virulence,\r\nextending backward until it reaches the sensitive womb.\r\n\r\nContact with the acrid, irritating secretions of the vagina produces\r\nsoreness of the fingers at the roots of the nails, and also frequently\r\ncauses warts upon the fingers. Hence the value of these signs, as\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\nUterine Disease.--Congestion of the womb is also produced by the act\r\nof abuse; and as the habit is continued, it also becomes permanent.\r\nThis congestion, together with the contact of the acrid vaginal\r\ndischarge, finally produces ulceration upon the neck, together with\r\nother diseases.\r\n\r\nAnother result of congestion is all kinds of menstrual derangements\r\nafter puberty, the occurrence of which epoch is hastened by the habit.\r\nProlapsus and various displacements are produced in addition to\r\nmenstrual irregularities.\r\n\r\nCancer of the Womb.--Degeneration of this delicate organ also occurs\r\nas the result of the constant irritation and congestion, and is often\r\nof a malignant nature, occasioning a most painful death.\r\n\r\nSterility.--Sterility, dependent on a total loss of sexual desire and\r\ninability to participate in the sexual act, is another condition which\r\nis declared by medical authors to be most commonly due to previous\r\nhabits of self-abuse. In consequence of overexcitement the organs\r\nbecome relaxed.\r\n\r\nAtrophy of Mammae.--Closely connected with other local results is the\r\ndeficient development of the breasts when the vice is begun before or\r\nat puberty, and atrophy if it is begun or continued after development\r\nhas occurred. As previously remarked, this is not the sole cause of\r\nsmall mammae, but it is one of the great causes.\r\n\r\nPruritis.--This is an affection not infrequent in these subjects.\r\nContinued congestion produces a terrible itching of the genitals, which\r\nincreases until the individual is in a state of actual frenzy, and the\r\ndisposition to manipulate the genitals becomes irresistible, and is\r\nindulged even in the presence of friends or strangers, and though the\r\npatient be at other times a young woman of unexceptionable modesty.\r\nIn cases of this kind, great hypertrophy of the organ of greatest\r\nsensibility has been observed, and in some cases amputation of the part\r\nhas been found the only cure.\r\n\r\nGeneral Effects.--The general effects in the female are much the same\r\nas those in the male. Although women suffer no seminal loss, they suffer\r\nthe debilitating effects of leucorrhoea, which is in some degree\r\ninjurious in the same manner as seminal losses in the male. But in\r\nfemales the greatest injury results from the nervous exhaustion which\r\nfollows the unnatural excitement. Nervous diseases of every variety\r\nare developed. Emaciation and debility become more marked even than\r\nin the male, and the worst results are produced sooner, being hastened\r\nby the sedentary habits of these females, generally. Insanity is more\r\nfrequently developed than in males. Spinal irritation is so frequent\r\na result that a recent surgical author has said that \"spinal irritation\r\nin girls and women is, in a majority of cases, due to self-abuse.\"[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Davis.]\r\n\r\nA Common Cause of Hysteria.--This, too, is one of the most frequent\r\ncauses of hysteria, chorea, and epilepsy among young women, though not\r\noften recognized.\r\n\r\nA writer, quoted several times before in this work, remarks as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"This is not a matter within the scope of general investigation; truth\r\nis not to be expected from its _habitues_; parents are deceived\r\nrespecting it, believing rather what they wish than what they fear.\r\nEven the physician can but suspect, till time develops more fully by\r\nhysterias, epilepsies, spinal irritations, and a train of symptoms\r\nunmistakable even if the finally extorted confession of the poor victim\r\ndid not render the matter clear. Marriage does, indeed, often arrest\r\nthis final catastrophe, and thus apparently shifts the responsibility\r\nupon other shoulders, and to the 'injurious effects of early\r\nmarriages,' to the 'ills of maternity,' are ascribed the results of\r\nprevious personal abuse.\r\n\r\n\"For statistics and further information on this all-important subject,\r\nwe must refer the reader to the opinions of physicians who have the\r\ncharge of our retreats for the insane, lunatic asylums, and the like;\r\nto the discriminating physicians of the families of the upper\r\nclasses--stimulated alike by food, drinks, scenes where ease is\r\npredominant, where indolence is the habit and novel-reading is the\r\noccupation--for further particulars on a subject here but barely\r\nalluded to.\"[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Gardner.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS UPON OFFSPRING.\r\n\r\nIf sterility does not result, children are liable to be \"delicate, puny,\r\ndecrepit, or subject to various congenital maladies, especially of the\r\nnervous system, to idiocy from deficient development of the brain, to\r\nhydrocephalus, to epilepsy, convulsions, palsy. The scrofulous\r\ndiathesis, tubercular and glandular maladies, diseases of the\r\nvertebrae and of the joints, softening of the central portions of the\r\nbrain, and tuberculous formations in the membranes, palsy and\r\nconvulsions, chorea, inflammations of the membranes or substance of\r\nthe brain or spinal cord, and numerous other affections to which infants\r\nand children are liable, very commonly result from the practice of\r\nself-pollution by either of the parents previous to marriage. But the\r\nevil does not always stop at this epoch of existence, it often extends\r\nthroughout the life of the offspring, or it appears only with puberty\r\nand mature age.\"\r\n\r\nToo frequently, the victim of self-abuse, when he finds himself\r\nsuffering from the first results of his sin, neglects to adopt any\r\nmeasures for the cure of the disease. Not understanding its inveterate\r\ncharacter, he labors under the delusion that it will cure itself in\r\ntime. This is a fatal mistake. The diseased conditions induced by this\r\nvice never improve themselves. Their constant tendency is to increase\r\nin virulence and inveteracy. The necessity of taking prompt measures\r\nfor relief is too apparent to need especial emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SELF-ABUSE AND ITS EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nAfter having duly considered the causes and effects of this terrible\r\nevil, the question next in order for consideration is, How shall it\r\nbe cured? When a person has, through ignorance or weakness, brought\r\nupon himself the terrible effects described, how shall he find relief\r\nfrom his ills, if restoration is possible? To the answer of these\r\ninquiries, most of the remaining pages of this work will be devoted.\r\nBut before entering upon a description of methods of _cure_, a brief\r\nconsideration of the subject of _prevention_ of the habit will be in\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF SECRET VICE.\r\n\r\nFor the rising generation, those yet innocent of the evil practices\r\nso abundant in this age of sensuality, how the evil habit may be\r\nprevented is the most important of all questions connected with this\r\nsubject. This topic should be especially interesting to parents, for\r\neven those who are themselves sensual have seen enough of the evils\r\nof such a life to wish that their children may remain pure. There are,\r\nindeed, rare exceptions to this rule, for we sometimes learn of parents\r\nwho have deliberately led their own children into vice, as though they\r\ndesired to make them share their shame and damnation.\r\n\r\nCultivate Chastity.--From earliest infancy all of those influences and\r\nagencies which cultivate chastity should be brought into active\r\nexercise. These we need not repeat here, having previously dwelt upon\r\nthem so fully. The reader is recommended to re-peruse the portion of\r\nthe work devoted to this subject, in connection with the present section.\r\nIf parents have themselves indulged in this vice, they should use\r\nspecial care that all of the generative and gestative influences\r\nbrought to bear upon their children are the purest possible, so that\r\nthey may not inherit a predisposition to sin in this direction.\r\n\r\nSpecial care should be exercised to avoid corrupt servants and\r\nassociates. Every servant not known to be pure should be suspected until\r\nproof of innocence has been established. They should be especially\r\ninstructed of the evil arising from manipulation of the genitals even\r\nin infants, as they may do immense harm through simple ignorance.\r\n\r\nTimely Warning.--But, in spite of chaste surroundings and all other\r\nfavorable circumstances, if the child is left in ignorance of his danger,\r\nhe may yet fall a victim to the devices of servants or corrupt playmates,\r\nor may himself make a fatal discovery. Hence arises the duty of warning\r\nchildren of the evil before the habit has been formed. This is a duty\r\nthat parents seldom perform even when they are not unaware of the danger.\r\nThey in some way convince themselves that their children are pure, at\r\nleast, even if others are corrupt. It is often the most difficult thing\r\nin the world for parents to comprehend the fact that _their_ children\r\nare not the best children in the world, perfect paragons of purity and\r\ninnocence. There is an unaccountable and unreasonable delicacy on the\r\npart of parents about speaking of sexual subjects to their children.\r\nIn consequence, their young, inquisitive minds are left wholly in\r\nignorance unless, perchance, they gain information from some vile\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nObjections are raised against talking to children or young persons\r\nabout matters in any degree pertaining to the sexual organs or functions.\r\nSome of the more important of them are considered in the introduction\r\nto this work, and we need not repeat here.\r\n\r\nThe little one should be taught from earliest infancy to abstain from\r\nhandling the genitals, being made to regard it as a very improper act.\r\nWhen the child becomes old enough to understand and reason, he may be\r\nfurther informed of the evil consequences; then, as he becomes older,\r\nthe functions of the organs may be explained with sufficient fullness\r\nto satisfy his natural craving for knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf this course were pursued, how many might be saved from ruin! It is,\r\nof course, necessary that the parents shall themselves be acquainted\r\nwith the true functions of the organs before they attempt to teach any\r\none else, especially children. Many parents might receive benefit from\r\nbeing obliged to \"study up;\" for it is a lamentable fact, the ill effects\r\nof which are every day seen, that a great many people have spent a very\r\nlarge portion of their lives without ever ascertaining the true\r\nfunction of the reproductive organs, though living in matrimony for\r\nmany years. Some of the consequences of this ignorance have been\r\nportrayed in previous pages.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! why did not some kind friend tell me of the harm I was doing myself?\"\r\nhas been the exclamation of many an unfortunate sufferer from this vice.\r\nA warning voice should be raised to save those who are ignorantly\r\nworking their own destruction. Parents, teachers, ministers, all who\r\nhave access to the youth, should sound the note of alarm in their ears,\r\nthat if possible they may be saved from the terrible thralldom pictured\r\nby a writer in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n\"The waters have gone over me. But out of the black depths, could I\r\nbe heard, I would cry to all those who have set a foot in the perilous\r\nflood. Could the youth look into my desolation, and be made to\r\nunderstand what a dreary thing it is when a man shall feel himself going\r\ndown a precipice with open eyes and passive will--to see his destruction\r\nand have no power to stop it, and yet to feel it all the way emanating\r\nfrom himself; to perceive all goodness emptied out of him, and yet not\r\nbe able to forget a time when it was otherwise; to bear about with him\r\nthe spectacle of his own self-ruin; could he feel the body of death\r\nout of which I cry hourly with feebler and feebler outcry to be\r\ndelivered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCURATIVE TREATMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF SELF-ABUSE.\r\n\r\nWhen the habit and its effects are of very short duration, a cure is\r\nvery readily accomplished, especially in the cases of children and\r\nfemales, as in them the evils begun are not continued in the form of\r\ninvoluntary pollutions. In cases of longer standing in males, the task\r\nis more difficult, but still the prospect of recovery is very favorable,\r\nprovided the cooperation of the patient can be secured; without this,\r\nlittle can be done. But in these cases the patient may as well be told\r\nat the outset that the task of undoing the evil work of years of sin\r\nis no easy matter. It can only be accomplished by determined effort,\r\nby steady perseverance in right doing, and in the application of\r\nnecessary remedies. Those who have long practiced the vice, or long\r\nsuffered severely from its effects, have received an injury which will\r\ninevitably be life-long to a greater or lesser extent in spite of all\r\nthat can be done for them. Yet such need not despair, for they may\r\nreceive inestimable benefit by the prevention of greater damage, which\r\nthey are sure to suffer if the disease is allowed to go unchecked.\r\n\r\nCure of the Habit.--The preliminary step in treatment is always to cure\r\nthe vice itself if it still exists. The methods adopted for this purpose\r\nmust differ according to the age of the individual patient.\r\n\r\n_In children_, especially those who have recently acquired the habit,\r\nit can be broken up by admonishing them of its sinfulness, and\r\nportraying in vivid colors its terrible results, if the child is old\r\nenough to comprehend such admonitions. In addition to faithful warnings,\r\nthe attention of the child should be fully occupied by work, study,\r\nor pleasant recreation. He should not be left alone at any time, lest\r\nhe yield to temptation. Work is an excellent remedy; work that will\r\nreally make him very tired, so that when he goes to bed he will have\r\nno disposition to defile himself. It is best to place such a child under\r\nthe care of a faithful person of older years, whose special duty it\r\nshall be to watch him night and day until the habit is thoroughly\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nIn younger children, with whom moral considerations will have no\r\nparticular weight, other devices may be used. Bandaging the parts has\r\nbeen practiced with success. Tying the hands is also successful in some\r\ncases; but this will not always succeed, for they will often contrive\r\nto continue the habit in other ways, as by working the limbs, or lying\r\nupon the abdomen. Covering the organs with a cage has been practiced\r\nwith entire success. A remedy which is almost always successful in small\r\nboys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis.\r\nThe operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering\r\nan anaesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have\r\na salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with\r\nthe idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases. The soreness\r\nwhich continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it\r\nhad not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and\r\nnot resumed. If any attempt is made to watch the child, he should be\r\nso carefully surrounded by vigilance that he cannot possibly transgress\r\nwithout detection. If he is only partially watched, he soon learns to\r\nelude observation, and thus the effect is only to make him cunning in\r\nhis vice.\r\n\r\n_In adults_, or youths, a different plan must be pursued. In these cases,\r\nmoral considerations, and the inevitable consequences to health of body\r\nand mind, are the chief influences by which a reform is to be effected,\r\nif at all. These considerations may be urged with all possible eloquence\r\nand earnestness, but should not be exaggerated. The truth is terrible\r\nenough. If there are any special influences which may be brought to\r\nbear upon a particular individual,--and there always will be something\r\nof this sort owing to peculiarities of temperament or\r\ncircumstances,--these should be promptly employed and applied in such\r\na manner as to secure for them their full bearing.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the most must be done by the individual himself. All\r\nthat others can do for him is to surround him with favoring\r\ncircumstances and arouse him to a proper sense of his real condition\r\nand danger. If this can be thoroughly accomplished, there is much reason\r\nto hope; but if the individual has become so lost to all sense of purity,\r\nall aspirations toward good and noble objects, that he cannot be made\r\nto feel the need of reformation, his case is hopeless.\r\n\r\n_How May a Person Help Himself?_--The following suggestions will be\r\nfound useful in fighting the battle with vice and habit:--\r\n\r\n1. Begin by a resolution to reform, strengthened by the most solemn\r\nvows.\r\n\r\n2. Resolve to reform _now_; not to-morrow or next week, but this very\r\nminute. Thousands have sunk to perdition while resolving to indulge\r\n\"only this once.\"\r\n\r\n3. Begin the work of reform by purging the mind. If a lewd thought enters\r\nthe mind, dispel it at once. Cultivate a loathing for concupiscence.\r\nNever harbor such ideas for an instant, for they will surely lead to\r\nthe overt act. If, perchance, the physical sin should not be committed,\r\nthe thought itself is sin, and it leaves a physical as well as a moral\r\nscar almost as deep and hideous as that inflicted by the grosser crime.\r\n\r\n4. As a help to purity of mind, whenever impure thoughts enter,\r\nimmediately direct the mind upon the purest object with which you are\r\nacquainted. Flee from the special exciting cause, if there is one, and\r\nengage in some active labor or other exercise that will divert the mind\r\ninto another channel.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid solitude, for then it is that temptation comes, and you are\r\nmost likely to fail. Avoid equally all other causes which may lead to\r\nthe act.\r\n\r\n6. Strictly comply with all the rules laid down for the cultivation\r\nof chastity and the maintenance of continence.\r\n\r\n7. Above all, seek for grace and help from the Source of all spiritual\r\nstrength in every time of temptation, relying upon the promise, \"Seek,\r\nand ye shall find.\"\r\n\r\nHopeful Courage.--An individual who will earnestly set himself about\r\nthe work of purifying his mind and redeeming his body, if he will\r\nconscientiously adopt, and perseveringly apply, the remedies pointed\r\nout, _may be sure of success_. There can be no possible chance for\r\nfailure. Triumph is certain. Patience may be tried and faith tested,\r\nbut unwavering trust in God and nature, and an executed determination\r\nto do all on his part, will bring to every such one certain recovery.\r\nThere may be some scars left, a few traces of the injury wrought; but\r\nthe deliverance will be none the less triumphant. Faith and\r\nperseverance will work wonders.\r\n\r\nGeneral Regimen and Treatment.--After long abuse of the sexual organs,\r\nand in many cases after a short course of sin, the whole system becomes\r\ndeteriorated; digestion is impaired, the muscles are weakened, the\r\ncirculation is unbalanced, the nerves are irritable, the\r\nbrain--especially the back and lower portion of it--is congested, the\r\nskin is torpid, the bowels are inactive, the general health is deranged\r\nin almost every particular. All of these morbid conditions serve to\r\nkeep up the very difficulty which has produced and is increasing them.\r\nAny curative effort, to be effective, then, must be directed to these\r\nas well as to local conditions; and it is pretty certainly established\r\nthat local remedies or applications alone will rarely accomplish any\r\nappreciable good, at least of a permanent character.\r\n\r\nMany of the observations on treatment are equally applicable to both\r\nsexes; but particular directions have been especially adapted to males,\r\nand chiefly with the cure of seminal emissions as the object in view.\r\nThis remark will explain any seeming lack of completeness.\r\n\r\nMental and Moral Treatment.--The greatest impediment to recovery is\r\nusually found in the mind of the patient. His hopeless despair,\r\nmelancholy, sullen apathy in many cases, want of energy, and fickleness\r\nof mind, thwart all attempts that are made for him. In other cases,\r\nthe want of willpower, or neglect to exercise the will in controlling\r\nthe thoughts, completely counteracts all that can be done for him. He\r\nmust be made to understand this well, and then all possible means must\r\nbe employed to attract his attention from himself, from brooding over\r\nhis ills. Occupy him, interest him, or teach him to occupy and interest\r\nhimself. The enthusiastic study of some one of the natural sciences\r\nis a most excellent auxiliary in effecting this.\r\n\r\nThe thing of first importance is that the patient should obtain command\r\nof his thoughts; by this means, he can do more for himself than all\r\nthe doctors can do for him. \"But I cannot control my thoughts,\" says\r\nthe patient. A young man said to me, \"O doctor, you don't know how I\r\nfeel. I despise myself; I hate myself; I often feel inclined to kill\r\nmyself. My mind is always full of abominable images; my thoughts run\r\naway with me and I cannot help myself.\" The tears ran down his face\r\nin streams as he told me of his slavery. He solemnly affirmed that he\r\nhad never performed the act of self-pollution but once in his life:\r\nand yet for years he had been a constant sufferer from nocturnal\r\nemissions until his manhood was nearly lost, evidently the result of\r\nthe mental onanism which he had practiced without imagining the\r\npossibility of harm.\r\n\r\nBut it is not true that control of the thoughts is impossible. Thoughts\r\nare the result of the action of the brain; and the action of the brain\r\nmay be controlled as well as the movements of a voluntary muscle. It\r\nmay be more difficult, especially when the resolution is weakened, as\r\nit is by this vice; but so long as there are left any remnants of will\r\nand reason, control is possible. To strengthen the will must be one\r\nof the objects of mental treatment, and exercise is the method by which\r\nit may be accomplished. The thing for a sufferer to say, is not, \"I\r\ncan't,\" but, \"I can and I will control my thoughts.\" Suggestions which\r\nwill aid in accomplishing this have already been given under the heading,\r\n\"Cure of the Habit.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot forbear to add a word further respecting the worth of religion\r\nin aiding these sufferers. If there is any living creature who needs\r\nthe help of true religion, of faith in God, in Christ, and in the\r\nefficacy of prayer, it is one of these. If there is any poor mortal\r\nwho can not afford to be deprived of the aid of a sympathizing Saviour,\r\nit is one who has enervated his will, degraded his soul, and depraved\r\nhis body by the vile habit of self-abuse. A compassionate Redeemer will\r\nsuccor even these defiled ones, if they truly \"hunger and thirst\" after\r\npurity, and if they set about the work of reforming themselves in good\r\nearnest, and with right motives.\r\n\r\nExercise.--Physical exercise is a most powerful aid to pure thoughts.\r\nWhen unchaste ideas intrude, engage at once in something which will\r\ndemand energetic muscular exercise. Pursue the effort until fatigued,\r\nif necessary, making, all the while, a powerful mental effort to control\r\nthe mind. Of course, evil thoughts will not be expelled by thinking\r\nof them, but by displacing them by pure thoughts. Exercise aids this\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\nExercise is also essential to balance the circulation, and thus relieve\r\ncongestion of internal organs. Sedentary persons especially need\r\nsystematic exercise. No single form of exercise is so excellent as\r\nwalking. Four or five miles a day are none too many to secure a proper\r\namount of muscular exercise. Gymnastics, the \"health-lift,\" \"Indian\r\nclubs,\" \"dumb-bells,\" rowing, and other forms of exercise are all good;\r\nbut none of them should be carried to excess. Ball-playing is likely\r\nto be made a source of injury by exciting, in vigorous competition,\r\ntoo violent and spasmodic action.\r\n\r\nDaily exercise should be taken to the extent of fatigue. It is better\r\nthat those who are still strong enough should have some regular\r\nemployment which will secure exercise. Those who prefer may secure\r\nexercise and recreation in the pursuit of some study that involves\r\nnecessary physical exertion; as, botany, geology, or entomology. The\r\ncollection of natural-history specimens is one of the most pleasant\r\ndiversions, and may be made very useful as well.\r\n\r\nPleasant companionship is essential to the best progress of these\r\npatients, especially in their walks, as much more exercise may be taken\r\nwithout an unpleasant sense of fatigue with a cheerful companion than\r\nwhen alone. Solitude should be avoided at all times as much as possible.\r\n\r\nDiet.--So much has already been said upon the relation of diet to\r\nchastity and its influence upon the sexual organs that it is unnecessary\r\nto add many remarks here. Nothing could be more untrue than the\r\nstatement made by some authors that the nature of the diet is of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nThe science of physiology teaches that our very thoughts are born of\r\nwhat we eat. A man that lives on pork, fine-flour bread, rich pies and\r\ncakes, and condiments, drinks tea and coffee and uses tobacco, might\r\nas well try to fly as to be chaste in thought. He will accomplish wonders\r\nif he remains physically chaste; but to be mentally virtuous would be\r\nimpossible for him without a miracle of grace.\r\n\r\nOne whose thoughts have been so long trained in the filthy ruts of vice\r\nthat they run there automatically, and naturally gravitate\r\ndownward--such a one must exercise especial care to secure the most\r\nsimple, pure, and unstimulating diet.\r\n\r\nThe following precautions are necessary to be observed in relation to\r\ndiet:--\r\n\r\n1. _Never overeat_. If too much food is taken at one meal, fast the\r\nnext meal to give the system a chance to recover itself and to serve\r\nas a barrier against future transgressions of the same kind. Gluttony\r\nis fatal to chastity; and overeating will be certain to cause emissions,\r\nwith other evils, in one whose organs are weakened by abuse.\r\n\r\n2. _Eat but twice a day_, or, if supper is eaten, let it be very light,\r\nand of the most simple food, as fruit, or fruit and bread. Nothing should\r\nbe eaten within four or five hours of bed-time, and it is much better\r\nto eat nothing after three o'clock. The ancients ate but two meals a\r\nday; why should moderns eat three or four? If the stomach contains\r\nundigested food, the sleep will be disturbed, dreams will be more\r\nabundant, and emissions will be frequent. A most imperative rule of\r\nlife should be, \"Never go to bed with a loaded stomach.\" The violation\r\nof this rule is the great cause of horrid dreams and nightmare.\r\n\r\n3. _Discard all stimulating food_. Under this head must be included,\r\nspices, pepper, ginger, mustard, cinnamon, cloves, essences, all\r\ncondiments, salt, pickles, etc., together with animal food of all kinds,\r\nnot excepting fish, fowl, oysters, eggs, and milk. It is hardly to be\r\nexpected that all who have been accustomed to use these articles all\r\ntheir lives will discard them wholly at once, nor, perhaps, that many\r\nwill ever discard them entirely; but it would be better for them to\r\ndo so, nevertheless. The only ones which should be tolerated under any\r\ncircumstances should be lean beef or mutton, salt in very moderate\r\nquantities, and a moderate use of milk. Use as little of these as\r\npossible--_the less the better_.\r\n\r\n4. _Stimulating drinks_ should be abstained from with still greater\r\nstrictness. Wine, beer, tea, and coffee should be taken under no\r\ncircumstances. The influence of coffee in stimulating the genital\r\norgans is notorious. Chocolate should be discarded also. It is\r\nrecommended by some who suppose it to be harmless, being ignorant of\r\nthe fact that it contains a poison practically identical with that of\r\ntea and coffee.\r\n\r\nHot drinks of all kinds should be avoided.\r\n\r\nTobacco, another stimulant, though not a drink, should be totally\r\nabandoned at once.\r\n\r\n5. In place of such articles as have been condemned, eat fruits, grains,\r\nand vegetables. There is a rich variety of these kinds of food, and\r\nthey are wholesome and unstimulating. Graham flour, oatmeal, and ripe\r\nfruit are the indispensables of a dietary for those who are suffering\r\nfrom sexual excesses.\r\n\r\nFurther remarks upon diet, with a few useful recipes for preparing\r\nhealthful food, will be found in works devoted to the subject of\r\ndiet.[54] The patient must carefully comply with all the rules of a\r\nhealthy diet if he would be sure of recovery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: See \"Healthful Cookery,\" _Good Health_ Publishing\r\nCompany, Battle Creek, Mich.]\r\n\r\nSleeping.--It is from accidents which happen during sleep that the\r\ngreat majority of sufferers complain; hence there is no little\r\nimportance attaching to this subject. The following suggestions\r\npresent in a very brief manner some of the more practical ideas\r\nconnected with this part of the subject:--\r\n\r\n1. From seven to nine hours' sleep are required by all persons. The\r\nrule should be, Retire early and sleep until rested; Early rising is\r\nnot beneficial unless it has been preceded by abundant sleep.\r\n\r\n2. Arise immediately upon waking in the morning if it is after four\r\no'clock. A second nap is generally unrefreshing and is dangerous, for\r\nemissions most frequently occur at this time.\r\n\r\n3. If insufficient sleep is taken at night, sleep a few minutes just\r\nbefore dinner. Half an hour's rest at this time is remarkably\r\nrefreshing; and even fifteen minutes spent in sleep will be found very\r\nreviving. Do not sleep after dinner, as a pollution will be very likely\r\nto occur, and, as a rule, after-dinner naps are unrefreshing and\r\nproductive of indigestion.\r\n\r\n4. Never go to bed with the bowels or bladder loaded. The bladder should\r\nbe emptied just before retiring. It is also a good plan to form the\r\nhabit of rising once or twice during the night to urinate.\r\n\r\n5. The position in sleeping is of some importance. Sleeping upon the\r\nback or upon the abdomen favors the occurrence of emissions; hence,\r\nit is preferable to sleep on one side. If supper has been taken, the\r\nright side is preferable, as that position will favor the passage of\r\nfood from the stomach into the intestines in undergoing digestion.\r\n\r\nVarious devices are employed, sometimes with advantage, to prevent the\r\npatient from turning upon his back while asleep. The most simple is\r\nthat recommended by Acton, and consists in tying a knot in the middle\r\nof a towel and then fastening the towel about the body in such a way\r\nthat the knot will come upon the small of the back. The unpleasant\r\nsensations arising from pressure of the knot, if the sleeper turn upon\r\nhis back, will often serve as a complete preventive. Others fasten a\r\npiece of wood upon the back for a similar purpose. Still others practice\r\ntying one hand to the bedpost. None of these remedies should be depended\r\nupon, but they may be tried in connection with other means of treatment.\r\n\r\n6. Soft beds and pillows must be carefully avoided. Feather-beds should\r\nnot be employed when possible to find a harder bed; the floor, with\r\na single folded blanket beneath the sleeper, would be preferable. Soft\r\npillows heat the head, as soft beds produce heat in other parts. A hair\r\nmattress, or a bed of corn husks, oat straw, or excelsior--covered with\r\ntwo or three blankets or a quilted cotton mattress--makes a very healthy\r\nand comfortable bed.\r\n\r\n7. Too many covers should be avoided with equal care. The thinnest\r\npossible covering in summer, and the lightest consistent with comfort\r\nin winter, should be the rule. Sleeping too warm is a frequent exciting\r\ncause of nocturnal losses.\r\n\r\n8. Thorough ventilation of the sleeping-room, both while occupied and\r\nduring the day-time, must not be neglected. It should be located in\r\na position to admit the sunshine during the morning hours. It is a good\r\nplan to keep in it a number of house plants, as they will help to purify\r\nthe air, besides adding to its cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n9. If wakeful at night, instead of lying in bed trying to go to sleep,\r\nget up at once, open the bed, air the sheets, remove the night clothing\r\nand walk about the room for a few minutes, rubbing the body briskly\r\nwith the bare hand at the same time. A tepid sponge bath, followed by\r\na vigorous rubbing kept up until really tired, will conduce to sleep\r\nin many cases. Sometimes a change of bed, or pulling the bed to pieces\r\nand arranging it again, is just the thing needed to bring sleep.\r\n\r\n10. One of the most effectual panaceas for certain varieties of\r\nsleeplessness is going to bed at peace with all the world, and with\r\na conscience void of offense toward God as well as man.\r\n\r\nDreams.--This is a subject of much interest to those suffering from\r\nnocturnal pollutions, for these occurrences are almost always\r\nconnected with dreams of a lascivious nature.\r\n\r\nIn perfectly natural sleep, there are no dreams; consciousness is\r\nentirely suspended. In the ordinary stage of dreaming, there is a\r\npeculiar sort of consciousness, many of the faculties of the mind being\r\nmore or less active while the power of volition is wholly dormant.\r\nCarpenter describes another stage of consciousness between that of\r\nordinary dreaming and wakefulness, a condition \"in which the dreamer\r\nhas a consciousness that he is dreaming, being aware of the\r\nunreliability of the images which present themselves before his mind.\r\nHe may even make a voluntary and successful effort to prolong them if\r\nagreeable, or to dissipate them if unpleasing; thus evincing a certain\r\ndegree of that directing power, the entire want of which is\r\ncharacteristic of the true state of dreams.\"\r\n\r\nCan Dreams Be Controlled?--Facts prove that they can be, and to a\r\nremarkable extent. A large share of emissions occur in the state\r\ndescribed by Dr. Carpenter, in which a certain amount of control by\r\nthe will is possible. This is the usual condition of the mind during\r\nmorning naps; and if a person resolutely determines to combat unchaste\r\nthoughts whenever they come to him, whether asleep or awake, he will\r\nfind it possible to control himself not only during this semi-conscious\r\nstate, but even during more profound sleep.\r\n\r\nThe following case, related by an eminent London surgeon,[55]\r\nillustrates what may be done by strong resolution; the patient was an\r\nItalian gentleman of very great respectability.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Acton.]\r\n\r\n\"He had been inconvenienced five years before with frequent emissions,\r\nwhich totally unnerved him. He determined resolutely that the very\r\ninstant the image of a woman or any libidinous idea presented itself\r\nto his imagination, _he would wake_; and to insure his doing so, dwelt\r\nin his thoughts on his resolution for a long time before going to sleep.\r\nThe remedy, applied by a vigorous will, had the most happy results.\r\nThe idea, the remembrance of its being a _danger_, and the determination\r\nto wake, closely united the evening before, were never dissociated even\r\nin sleep, and he awoke in time; and this reiterated precaution, repeated\r\nduring some evenings, absolutely cured the complaint.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other cases of the same kind have been recorded. Doubtless the\r\nplan would be found successful in many cases when coupled with a proper\r\nregimen.\r\n\r\nA still greater control is exerted over the thoughts during sleep by\r\ntheir character during hours of wakefulness. By controlling the mind\r\nduring entire consciousness, it will also be controlled during\r\nunconsciousness or semi-consciousness.\r\n\r\nDr. Acton makes the following very appropriate remarks on this\r\nsubject:--\r\n\r\n\"Patients will tell you that they _cannot_ control their dreams. This\r\nis not true. Those who have studied the connection between thoughts\r\nduring waking hours and dreams during sleep know that they are closely\r\nconnected. The _character_ is the same sleeping or waking. It is not\r\nsurprising that, if a man has allowed his thoughts during the day to\r\nrest upon libidinous subjects, he should find his mind at night full\r\nof lascivious dreams--the one is a consequence of the other, and the\r\nnocturnal pollution is a natural consequence, particularly when\r\ndiurnal indulgence has produced an irritability of the generative\r\norgans. A will which in our waking hours we have not exercised in\r\nrepressing sexual desires, will not, when we fall asleep, preserve us\r\nfrom carrying the sleeping echo of our waking thought farther than we\r\ndared to do in the day-time.\"\r\n\r\nBathing.--A daily bath is indispensable to health under almost all\r\ncircumstances; for patients of this class, it is especially necessary.\r\nA general bath should be taken every morning immediately upon rising.\r\nGeneral _cold bathing_ is not good for any person, especially in the\r\nmorning, though some may tolerate it remarkably well, being of\r\nexceptionally hardy constitutions; but the advice to try \"cold bathing\"\r\noften given to sufferers from seminal weakness, is very pernicious,\r\nfor most of them have been reduced so low in vitality by their disease\r\nthat they cannot endure such violent treatment.\r\n\r\nSun baths, electric baths, spray, plunge, and other forms of bath, are\r\nof greatest value to those suffering from the effects of indiscretions.\r\nThese are described, with additional observations concerning\r\ntemperature of baths, etc., etc., in works devoted to this subject.\r\n\r\nImprovement of General Health.--Patients suffering from emissions and\r\nother forms of seminal weakness are almost always dyspeptic, and most\r\nof them present other constitutional affections which require careful\r\nand thorough treatment according to the particular indications of the\r\ncase. The wise physician will not neglect these if he desires to cure\r\nhis patient and make his recovery as complete as possible.\r\n\r\nProstitution as a Remedy.--Said a leading physician in New York to us\r\nwhen interrogated as to his special treatment of spermatorrhoea, \"When\r\na young man comes to me suffering from nocturnal emissions, I give him\r\ntonics and _send him to a woman_.\" That this is not an unusual method\r\nof treatment, even among regular physicians, is a fact as true as it\r\nis deplorable. There are hundreds of young men whose morals have been\r\nruined by such advice. Having been educated to virtuous habits, at least\r\nso far as illicit intercourse is concerned, they resist all temptations\r\nin this direction, even though their inclinations are very strong; but\r\nwhen advised by a physician to commit fornication as a remedial measure,\r\nthey yield their virtue, far too readily sometimes, and begin a life\r\nof sin from which they might have been prevented. There are good grounds\r\nfor believing that many young men purposely seek advice from physicians\r\nwhom they know are in the habit of prescribing this kind of remedy.\r\n\r\nFew know how commonly this course is recommended, and not by quacks,\r\nbut by members of the regular profession. A medical friend informed\r\nus that he knew a case in which a country physician advised a young\r\nman of continent habits to go to a neighboring large city and spend\r\na year or so with prostitutes, which advice he followed. Of his\r\nsubsequent history we know nothing; but it is most probable that, like\r\nmost other young men who adopt this remedy, he soon contracted diseases\r\nwhich rendered his condition ten times worse than at first, without\r\nat all improving his former state. In pursuing this course, one form\r\nof emission is only substituted for another, at the best; but more than\r\nthis, an involuntary result of disease is converted into a voluntary\r\nsin of the blackest character, a crime in which two participate, and\r\nwhich is not only an outrage upon nature, but against morality as well.\r\n\r\nA final argument against this course is that it is not a remedy and\r\ndoes not effect a cure of the evil, as will be shown by the following\r\nmedical testimonies:--\r\n\r\n\"The vexed question of connection is one which may be decided out of\r\nhand.... _It has no power of curing bad spermatorrhoea_; it may cause\r\na diminution in the number of emissions, but this is only a delusion;\r\nthe semen is still thrown off; the frame still continues to be\r\nexhausted; the genital organs and nervous system generally are still\r\nharassed by the incessant tax, and the patient is all the while laying\r\nthe foundation of impotence.\"[56]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Milton.]\r\n\r\n\"In all solemn earnestness I protest against such false treatment. It\r\nis better for a youth to live a continent life.\" \"There is a terrible\r\nsignificance in the wise man's words, 'None that go to her return again,\r\nneither take they hold of the paths of life.'\"[57] This hazardous and\r\nimmoral mode of treatment is the result of the common opinion that\r\nemissions are necessary and natural, which we have previously shown\r\nto be a falsity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Acton.]\r\n\r\nMarriage.--Another class of practitioners, with more apparent regard\r\nfor morality, recommend matrimony as the sure panacea for all the ills\r\nof which the sufferers from self-abuse complain, with the possible\r\nexception of actual impotence. Against this course several objections\r\nmay be urged; we offer the following:--\r\n\r\n1. It is not a remedy, since, as in the case of illicit intercourse,\r\n\"legalized prostitution\" is only a substitution of one form of\r\nemissions for another, the ill effects of which do not differ\r\nappreciably.\r\n\r\n2. If it were a remedy, it would not be a justifiable one, for its use\r\nwould necessitate an abuse of the marriage relation, as elsewhere\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n3. As another reason why the remedy would not be a _proper_, even if\r\na _good_, one, it may well be asked, What right has a man to treat a\r\nwife as a vial of medicine? Well does Mr. Acton inquire, \"What has the\r\nyoung girl, who is thus sacrificed to an egotistical calculation, done\r\nthat she should be condemned to the existence that awaits her? Who has\r\nthe right to regard her as a therapeutic agent, and to risk thus lightly\r\nher future prospects, her repose, and the happiness of the remainder\r\nof her life?\"\r\n\r\nIn cases in which seminal emissions occur frequently, the most reliable\r\nwriters upon this subject, Copland, Acton, Milton, and others, advise,\r\nwith reference to marriage, \"that the complaint should be removed\r\nbefore the married life is commenced.\" Independent of the\r\nconsiderations already presented, the individual affected in this\r\nmanner and contemplating marriage should carefully consider the\r\npossible and probable effects upon offspring, the legitimate result\r\nof marriage; these have been already described, and need not be\r\nrecapitulated.\r\n\r\nLocal Treatment.--While it is true that general treatment alone is\r\noccasionally successful in curing the diseases under consideration,\r\nand that local treatment alone is very rarely efficient, it is also\r\ntrue that in many cases skillful local treatment is required to\r\nsupplement the general remedies employed. While there has been a\r\ntendency on the part of the profession generally to depend wholly upon\r\ngeneral treatment, on the part of a less numerous body of specialists\r\nthere has been an opposite tendency to depend wholly, or nearly so,\r\nupon local measures. Both extremes are evidently wrong.\r\n\r\nThe object of local treatment for the relief of emissions, especially,\r\nis to remove the local cause of irritation, which, as previously shown,\r\nis one of the most active exciting causes of seminal losses. To effect\r\nthis, both internal and external applications are useful. We will now\r\nconsider some of these agents.\r\n\r\n_Cool Sitz Bath_.--The cool or cold sitz bath is one of the most\r\nefficacious of all remedies. It should be taken daily, and may often\r\nbe repeated, with benefit, several times a day. Its effect is to relieve\r\nthe local congestion, and thus allay the irritability of the affected\r\nparts. When but one bath is taken daily, it should be just before\r\nretiring at night. Full directions for this and other baths are given\r\nin works devoted to the subject of bathing.\r\n\r\n_Ascending Douche_.--This is also a very useful means of allaying\r\nirritation, especially the reflex excitability which is often present\r\nin the muscles in the vicinity of the perineum and prostate gland, and\r\nwhen there is pain and fullness in these parts.\r\n\r\n_Abdominal Bandage_.--This may be worn nights to very great advantage\r\nby most patients. It not only allays the irritability of the nerve\r\ncenters which are closely connected with the genital apparatus, but\r\nserves to keep the bowels in a healthy condition. It should not be\r\napplied so continuously as to produce a very profuse eruption on the\r\nskin. If such a symptom should appear, discontinue the bandage for a\r\ntime. When worn during the day-time, it should be changed once in three\r\nor four hours. It is generally best to wear it only nights.\r\n\r\n_Wet Compress_.--This is an application to be made to the lower part\r\nof the spine for the purpose of allaying the excessive heat and\r\nirritation which often exist there. It may also be worn nights, as it\r\nin some degree prevents the danger arising from sleeping upon the back.\r\n\r\n_Hot and Cold Applications to the Spine_.--These are powerful remedies\r\nunder appropriate conditions. Hot applications relieve congestion of\r\nthe genital organs and allay irritation. Cold applications are useful\r\nwhen a condition of debility and relaxation is present. Alternate\r\napplications of heat and cold are very valuable, when skillfully\r\napplied, as a means of allaying reflex excitability and promoting\r\nhealthy action. These applications are especially useful in cases in\r\nwhich there is heat and pain in the lower portion of the back. Their\r\neffects are greatly enhanced by administering a foot or leg bath at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n_Local Fomentations_.--When great local irritation exists, with\r\nconsiderable pain and spasmodic muscular action, the application of\r\nhot fomentations to the perineum will be found the most effectual means\r\nof giving relief. The hot douche and hot sitz bath are useful under\r\nthe same circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, alternate hot and cold applications are more effectual\r\nin allaying local irritation than hot fomentations alone.\r\n\r\n_Local Cold Bathing_.--The genital organs should be daily bathed in\r\ncold water just before retiring. Simply dashing water upon the parts\r\nfor two or three minutes is insufficient; more prolonged bathing is\r\nnecessary. A short application of cold occasions a strong and sudden\r\nreaction which increases local congestion; hence, the bath should be\r\ncontinued until the sedative effect is fully produced, which will\r\nrequire at least fifteen minutes. The water must be cold; about 60\r\ndegrees is the best temperature. Ice should be used to cool the water\r\nin warm weather. It should be applied thoroughly, being squeezed from\r\na sponge upon the lower part of the abdomen and allowed to run down.\r\n\r\n_Enemata_.--The use of the enema is an important means of aiding\r\nrecovery, but it has been much abused, and must be employed with caution.\r\nWhen the bowels are very costive, relieve them before retiring by a\r\ncopious injection of tepid water. The \"fountain syringe\" is the best\r\ninstrument to employ.\r\n\r\nUseful as is the syringe when needed, nothing could be much worse than\r\nbecoming dependent upon it. The bowels must be made to act for\r\nthemselves without such artificial assistance, by the use of proper\r\nfood, especially graham flour and oatmeal, and the avoidance of hot\r\ndrinks, milk, sugar, and other clogging and constipating articles; by\r\nwearing the abdominal bandage; by thorough kneading and percussion of\r\nthe abdomen several times daily for five minutes at a time; by taking\r\none or two glasses of cold water half an hour before breakfast every\r\nmorning; and by plenty of muscular exercise daily. The enema should\r\nbe used occasionally, however, rather than allow the bowels to continue\r\ncostive, and to avoid severe straining at stool.\r\n\r\nA small, cold enema taken just before retiring, and retained, will often\r\ndo much to allay local irritation.\r\n\r\n_Electricity_.--Probably no single agent will accomplish more than\r\nthis remedy when skillfully applied. It needs to be carefully used,\r\nand cannot be trusted in the hands of those not acquainted with the\r\nphysical properties of the remedy and scientific methods of applying\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Internal Applications_.--Complete and rapid success greatly depends\r\nupon skillful internal treatment, in a large number of cases. We are\r\naware that there is considerable prejudice, in certain quarters,\r\nagainst internal treatment; but having had the opportunity of observing\r\nthe effects of careful treatment applied in this way, and having put\r\nto the test of practical experience this method, we feel justified in\r\nrecommending that which is approved on both theoretical and practical\r\ngrounds; for it is rational to suppose that proper treatment applied\r\ndirectly to the seat of disease must be at least equally efficacious\r\nwith methods less direct.\r\n\r\nAs heretofore explained, in the more severe cases the urethra is found\r\nin a very irritable condition. It is hyper-sensitive, especially in\r\nthat portion just in front of the bladder, where the ejaculatory ducts\r\nopen into it. We have also seen how this condition is one of the chief\r\nexciting causes of emissions. The remedies described for allaying this\r\nirritation are all excellent and indispensable; but there is another\r\nmethod of great value. This consists in the passage of a suitable\r\ninstrument, a sound or bougie of proper size, two or three times a week.\r\nBy the aid of this means, the abnormal irritation will often diminish\r\nwith magical rapidity. The passage of the instrument of course needs\r\nto be done with great delicacy, so as to avoid increasing the\r\nirritation; hence it should not be attempted by a novice. Lack of skill\r\nin catheterism is doubtless the reason why some have seemed to produce\r\ninjury rather than benefit by this method of treatment, they not\r\nrecognizing the fact asserted by Prof. Gross in his treatise on surgery,\r\nthat skillful catheterism is one of the most delicate operations in\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\n_Use of Electricity_.--The use of electricity in connection with that\r\nof the sound adds greatly to its utility. By means of the metallic\r\ninstrument, also, electricity may be applied directly to the point of\r\ngreatest irritation; and its soothing effect is sometimes really\r\nwonderful, as the following case will show:--\r\n\r\nThe patient, a man of unusual physical development, was suffering from\r\nnocturnal emissions and diminished sexual power, the result of early\r\nindiscretions and marital excesses. One of his most unpleasant symptoms\r\nwas severe pain in the portion of the urethra near the openings of the\r\nejaculatory ducts. After he had been suffering more than usual for a\r\nfew days, we applied the faradaic electric current in the manner\r\nindicated above, for about fifteen minutes. At the end of that time\r\nthe pain was entirely removed, though considerable suffering had been\r\ncaused by the passage of the instrument, so sensitive was the congested\r\nmembrane. The pain did not return again for two or three weeks, though\r\ntreatment was necessarily suspended on account of absence.\r\n\r\nIn another case, that of a young man, a student, at the beginning of\r\ntreatment emissions occurred nightly, and sometimes as many as four\r\nin a single night, according to his statement, which we had no reason\r\nto doubt. Under the influence of these local applications, combined\r\nwith other measures of treatment and a measurably correct regimen, the\r\nnumber of emissions was in a few weeks reduced to one in two or three\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nNumerous other cases nearly as remarkable might be detailed if it were\r\nnecessary to do so. In quite a considerable number of cases in which\r\nwe have employed this plan of treatment, the results have been uniformly\r\nexcellent. A very slight increase of irritation sometimes occurs at\r\nfirst, but this quickly subsides.\r\n\r\nThe galvanic as well as the faradaic current is to be used under proper\r\ncircumstances. The application of electricity to the nerve centers by\r\nmeans of central galvanization, and also general and local external\r\nfaradization, are necessary methods to be employed in electrical\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n_Circumcision_.--In cases of phimosis, in which irritation is produced\r\nby retained secretions, division of the prepuce, or circumcision, is\r\nthe proper remedy. These cases are not infrequent, but the exciting\r\ncause of much of the difficulty is often overlooked. The same remedy\r\nis often useful in cases of long prepuce.\r\n\r\nWhen the glans penis is unusually tender and sensitive, this condition\r\nwill usually be removed by the daily washing with soap and water\r\nnecessary for cleanliness. If this does not suffice, or if there are\r\nslight excoriations caused by acrid secretions, apply, in addition,\r\na weak solution of tannin in glycerine once a day.\r\n\r\n_Impotence_.--Loss of sexual power arising from any form of sexual\r\nexcess, should be treated on the same general plan laid down for the\r\ntreatment of emissions and other weaknesses. Cold to the spine, and\r\nshort, but frequent, local cold applications, are among the most useful\r\nremedies; but, probably, electricity, discreetly used, is by far the\r\nmost valuable of all remedies. It should be applied both internally\r\nand externally.\r\n\r\nThe use of cantharides and other aphrodisiac remedies to stimulate the\r\nsexual organs is a most pernicious practice. The inevitable result is\r\nstill greater weakness. They should never be used under any\r\ncircumstances whatever. On the contrary, everything of a stimulating\r\ncharacter must be carefully avoided, even in diet.\r\n\r\n_Varicocele_.--Patients suffering from this difficulty should wear a\r\nproper suspensory bag, as the continued pressure of the distended veins\r\nupon the testes, if unsupported, will ultimately cause degenerative\r\nchanges and atrophy. A surgical operation, consisting of the removal\r\nof a portion of the skin of the scrotum, is proper if the patient desires\r\nan operation; no other operation is advisable.\r\n\r\nThe wearing of a suspensory bag is also advisable for those whose\r\ntesticles are unusually pendulous.\r\n\r\nDrugs, Rings, etc.--If drugs, _per se_, will cure invalids of any class,\r\nthey are certainly worthless in this class of patients. The whole\r\nmateria medica affords no root, herb, extract, or compound that alone\r\nwill cure a person suffering from emissions. Thousands of unfortunates\r\nhave been ruined by long-continued drugging. One physician will purge\r\nand salivate the patient. Another will dose him with phosphorus,\r\nquinine, or ergot. Another feeds him with iron. Another plies him with\r\nlupuline, camphor, and digitaline. Still another narcotizes him with\r\nopium, belladonna, and chloral. Purgatives and diuretics are given by\r\nanother, and some will be found ready to empty the whole pharmacopoeia\r\ninto the poor sufferer's stomach if he can be got to open his mouth\r\nwide enough.\r\n\r\nThe way that some of these poor fellows are blistered, and burned, and\r\ncauterized, and tortured in sundry other ways, is almost too horrible\r\nto think of; yet they endure it, often willingly, thinking it but just\r\npunishment for their sins, and perhaps hoping to expiate them by this\r\ncruel penance. By these procedures, the emissions are sometimes\r\ntemporarily checked, but the patient is not cured, nevertheless, and\r\nthe malady soon returns.\r\n\r\nThe employment of rings, pessaries, and numerous other mechanical\r\ndevices for preventing emissions, is entirely futile. No dependence\r\ncan be placed upon them. Some of these contrivances are very ingenious,\r\nbut they are all worthless, and time and money spent upon them are thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nQuacks.--The victims of self-abuse fall an easy prey to the hordes of\r\nharpies, fiends in human shape, who are ready at every turn to make\r\ncapital out of their misfortunes. From no other class of persons do\r\nquacks and charlatans derive so rich a harvest as from these erring\r\nones. It is not uncommon to find a man suffering from seminal weakness\r\nwho has paid to sundry parties hundreds of dollars for \"specifics\" which\r\nthey advertised as \"sure cures.\" We have seen and treated scores of\r\nthese patients, but never yet met a single case that had received\r\nbenefit from patent medicines.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers are full of the advertisements of these heartless\r\nvillains. They advertise under the guise of \"clergymen,\" charitable\r\ninstitutions, \"cured invalids,\" and similar pretenses. Usually they\r\noffer for sale some pill or mixture which will be a _sure cure_, in\r\nproof of which they cite the testimonials of numerous individuals who\r\nnever lived, or, at least, never saw either them or their filthy\r\ncompounds; or, they promise to send free a recipe which will be a certain\r\ncure. Here is a specimen recipe which was sent by a \"reverend\" gentleman\r\nwho claims to be a returned missionary from South America so intent\r\non doing good that he charges nothing for his invaluable information:--\r\n\r\n  Extract of Corrossa apimis,\r\n    \"     \"  Selarmo umbelifera,\r\n  Powdered Alkermes latifolia,\r\n  Extract of Carsadoc herbalis.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable recipe is warranted to cure all the evils arising from\r\nself-abuse, with no attention to diet and no inconvenience of any kind,\r\nto prevent consumption and insanity, and to cure venereal diseases.\r\nIt is also declared to be a perfectly \"_safe_\" remedy for all female\r\ndifficulties, which means that it will aid nefarious purposes.\r\n\r\nAlong with the recipe comes the suggestion that the druggist may not\r\nbe able to furnish all the ingredients in a perfectly pure state, and\r\nso, for the accommodation of suffering humanity, this noble\r\nphilanthropist has taken infinite pains to secure them direct from\r\nSouth America, and has them put up in neat little packages which he\r\nwill send, post-paid, for the trifle of $3.50, just one cent _less_\r\nthan actual cost. Then he tells what purports to be the history of his\r\nown nastiness, with a generous spicing of pious cant, and closes with\r\na benediction on all who have fallen into the same slough, and\r\nespecially those who will send for his fabulous foreign weeds to help\r\nthem out.\r\n\r\nA young man sees the advertisement of a book which will be sent free,\r\npostage paid, if he will only send his address. The title of the book\r\nbeing of some such character as \"Manhood Regained,\" or \"Nervous\r\nDebility,\" he imagines it may suit his case, and sends his name. Return\r\nmail brings the book, which is a wretched jargon of confused terms and\r\nappalling descriptions of the effects of self-abuse, with the most\r\nshameful exaggerations of the significance of the most trivial symptoms.\r\nThe ignorant youth reads what he supposes to be a description of his\r\nown case, and is frightened nearly to death. He is most happily relieved,\r\nhowever, to find that the generous publishers of the book have a remedy\r\nwhich is just adapted to his case, but which is so precious that it\r\ncannot be afforded at less than $50.00 for a sufficient quantity to\r\neffect a cure. He willingly parts with his hard-earned dollars, and\r\ngets, in return, some filthy mixture that did not cost a shilling.\r\n\r\nAnother trap set is called an \"Anatomical Museum.\" The anatomical part\r\nof the exhibition consists chiefly of models and figures calculated\r\nto excite the passions to the highest pitch. At stated intervals the\r\nproprietor, who is always a \"doctor,\" and by preference a German,\r\ndelivers lectures on the effects of masturbation, in which he resorts\r\nto every device to excite the fears and exaggerate the symptoms of his\r\nhearers, who are mostly young men and boys. Thus he prepares his victim,\r\nand when he once gets him within his clutches, he does not let him go\r\nuntil he has robbed him of his last dollar.\r\n\r\nWe might present almost any number of illustrations of the ways in which\r\nthese human sharks pursue their villainy. If there were a dungeon deep,\r\ndark, and dismal enough for the punishment of such rascals, we should\r\nfeel strongly inclined to petition to have them incarcerated in it.\r\nThey defy all laws, civil as well as moral, but are cunning enough to\r\nkeep outside of prison bars; and thus they wax rich by robbery, and\r\nthrive by deceit. A terrible recompense awaits them at the final\r\nsettlement, though they escape so easily now.\r\n\r\nClosing Advice.--We cannot finish this chapter without a few closing\r\nwords of advice to those who are suffering in any way from the results\r\nof sexual transgression. We are especially anxious to call attention\r\nto a few points of practical and vital interest to all who are suffering\r\nin the manner indicated.\r\n\r\n1. Give the matter prompt attention. Do not delay to adopt curative\r\nmeasures under the delusive idea that the difficulty will disappear\r\nof itself. Thousands have procrastinated in this way until their\r\nconstitutions have been so hopelessly undermined as to make treatment\r\nof little value. The intrinsic tendency of this disease is to continue\r\nto increase. It progresses only in one direction. It never \"gets well\r\nof itself,\" as some have imagined that it may do. Something must be\r\ndone to effect a cure; and the longer treatment is delayed, the more\r\ndifficult the case will become.\r\n\r\n2. Set about the work of getting well with a fixed determination to\r\npersevere, and never to give over the struggle until success is attained,\r\nno matter how difficult may be the obstacles to be surmounted. Such\r\nan effort will rarely be unsuccessful. One of the greatest impediments\r\nto recovery from diseases of this class is the vacillating dispositions\r\nof nearly all patients suffering from disorders of this character. Make\r\nup your mind what course of treatment to pursue, then adhere to it\r\nrigidly until it has received a thorough trial. Do not despair if no\r\nvery marked results are seen in a week, a month, or even a longer period.\r\nThe best remedies are among those which operate the most slowly.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid watching for symptoms. Ills are greatly exaggerated by\r\ndwelling upon them. One can easily imagine himself getting worse when\r\nhe is really getting better. Indeed, one can make himself sick by\r\ndwelling upon insignificant symptoms. Fix upon a course to pursue for\r\nrecovery, firmly resolve to comply with every requirement necessary\r\nto insure success, and then let the mind be entirely at rest respecting\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n4. Never consult a quack. The newspapers abound with lying\r\nadvertisements of remedies for diseases of this character. Do not waste\r\ntime and money in corresponding with the ignorant, unprincipled\r\ncharlatans who make such false pretensions. Do not consult traveling\r\ndoctors. Physicians of real merit have plenty of business at home. They\r\nare not obliged to go abroad in order to secure practice. Persons who\r\nresort to this course are, without exception, pretentious quacks.\r\nConsult only some well-known and reliable physician in whom you have\r\nconfidence. If your physician treats the matter lightly, and advises\r\nmarriage as a means of cure, you will not judge him harshly if you decide\r\nthat although he may be thoroughly competent to treat other diseases,\r\nhe is ignorant of the nature and proper treatment of this. It is an\r\nunfortunate fact that there are many physicians who are not thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the nature of spermatorrhoea and the proper mode of\r\ntreating the disease; hence the importance of making a judicious\r\nselection in choosing a medical adviser. If possible, employ one whom\r\nyou know to have treated successfully numerous similar cases, and give\r\nhim your entire confidence. It is far better to consult your family\r\nphysician than to trust yourself in the hands of some one whom you do\r\nnot know, and especially one who makes great pretensions to knowledge.\r\n\r\n5. Do not despair of ever recovering from the effects of past\r\ntransgression, and plunge into greater depths of sin. Persevering,\r\nskillful treatment will cure almost every case. Even the worst cases\r\ncan be greatly benefited if the earnest co-operation of the patient\r\ncan be secured. This is indispensable, and the patient should be so\r\ninstructed at the outset of a course of treatment.\r\n\r\n6. Every sufferer from sexual disease must make up his mind to live,\r\nduring the remainder of his life, as closely in accord with the laws\r\nof life and health as circumstances under his control will allow him\r\nto do. One who pursues this course, with a genuine regard for principle\r\nand a love for right, may confidently expect to receive the reward of\r\nobedience for his faithfulness. We would recommend such to obtain and\r\nstudy the best works upon hygiene, put in practice every new truth as\r\nsoon as learned, and become missionaries of the saving truths of hygiene\r\nto others who are suffering from the same cause as themselves, or who\r\nmay be in danger of falling into the same evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER FOR BOYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoys, this chapter is for you. It is written and printed purposely for\r\nyou. If you do not read another word in the book, read these few pages\r\nif you are old enough to do so. Read each line carefully and thoughtfully.\r\nYou may not find anything to make you laugh--possibly you may: but you\r\nwill be certain to find something of almost inestimable value to you\r\nin every line.\r\n\r\nWho are Boys?--Boys are scarce now-a-days. In the days of Methuselah,\r\nmale human beings were still boys when nearly a century old; twenty-five\r\nyears ago boys were still such until well out of their \"teens\"; now\r\nthe interval between infancy and the age at which the boy becomes a\r\nyoung man is so brief that boyhood is almost a thing of the past. The\r\nhappy period of care-free, joyous innocence which formerly intervened\r\nbetween childhood and early manhood is now almost unobservable. Boys\r\ngrow old too fast. They learn to imitate the vices and the manners of\r\ntheir seniors before they reach their teens, and are impatient to be\r\ncounted as men, no matter how great may be their deficiencies, their\r\nunfitness for the important duties and responsibilities of life. The\r\nconsequence of this inordinate haste and impatience to be old, is\r\npremature decay. Unfortunately the general tendency of the young\r\nmembers of the rising generation is to copy the vices of their elders,\r\nrather than the virtues of true manliness. A strong evidence of this\r\nfact, if there were no other, is the unnaturally old-looking faces which\r\nso many of our boys present. At the present time the average boy of\r\ntwelve knows more of vice and sin than the youth of twenty of the past\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much for these human mushrooms, which may be not inaptly\r\ncompared to toadstools which grow up in a single night and almost as\r\nspeedily decay, that we write, but for the old-fashioned boys, the few\r\nsuch there may be, those who have not yet learned to love sin, those\r\nwhose minds are still pure and uncontaminated. Those who have already\r\nbegun a course of vice and wickedness we have little hope of reforming;\r\nbut we are anxious to offer a few words of counsel and warning which\r\nmay possibly help to save as brands plucked from a blazing fire, those\r\nwhose moral sense is yet alive, who have quick and tender consciences,\r\nwho aspire to be truly noble and good.\r\n\r\nWhat are Boys for?--This question was answered with exact truthfulness\r\nby a little boy, who, when contemptuously accosted by a man with the\r\nremark, \"What are you good for?\" replied, \"Men are made of such as we.\"\r\nBoys are the beginnings of men. They sustain the same relation to men\r\nthat the buds do to full-blown flowers. They are still more like the\r\nsmall green apples which first appear when the blossoms drop from the\r\nbranches, compared with the ripe, luscious fruit which in autumn bends\r\nthe heavy-laden boughs almost to breaking. Often, like the young apples,\r\nboys are green; but this is only natural, and should be considered no\r\ndisgrace to the boys. If they grow up naturally they will ripen with\r\nage, like the fruit, developing at each successive stage of life\r\nadditional attractions and excellent qualities.\r\n\r\nBoys the Hope of the World.--A nation's most valuable property is its\r\nboys. A nation which has poor, weakly, vicious boys will have still\r\nweaker, more vicious and untrustworthy men. A country with noble,\r\nvirtuous, vigorous boys, is equally sure of having noble, pious, brave,\r\nand energetic men. Whatever debases, contaminates, or in any way\r\ninjures the boys of a country, saps and undermines the very foundation\r\nof the nation's strength and greatness. Save the boys from vice and\r\ncrime, give them good training, physically, mentally, and morally, and\r\nthe prosperity of the nation is assured.\r\n\r\nMan the Masterpiece.--When a skillful artist perfects a work of art,\r\na painting, a drawing, a statue, or some other work requiring great\r\ntalent and exceeding all his other efforts, it is called his masterpiece.\r\nSo man is the noblest work of God, the masterpiece of the Almighty.\r\nNumerous anecdotes are told of the sagacity of dogs, horses, elephants\r\nand other animals, of their intelligence and ingenious devices in\r\novercoming obstacles, avoiding difficulties, etc. Our admiration and\r\nwonder are often excited by the scarcely less than human wisdom shown\r\nby these lowly brothers of the human race. We call them noble animals;\r\nbut they are only noble brutes, at best. Compared with man, even in\r\nhis most humble form, as seen in the wild savage that hunts and devours\r\nhis prey like a wild beast, a lion or a tiger, they are immeasurably\r\ninferior. And in his highest development, man civilized, cultivated,\r\nChristianized, learned, generous, pious, certainly stands at the head\r\nof all created things.\r\n\r\nBoys, do you love what is noble, what is pure, what is grand, what is\r\ngood? You may each, if you will, become such yourselves. Let us consider\r\nfor a moment\r\n\r\nHow a Noble Character is Ruined.--A noble character is formed by the\r\ndevelopment of the good qualities of an individual. A bad character\r\nis formed by the development of bad traits, or evil propensities. In\r\nother words, sin is the cause of the demoralization of character, the\r\ndebasing of the mind, the loss of nobility of which we see so much around\r\nus in the world. Sin is the transgression of some law. There are two\r\nkinds of sins: those which are transgressions of the moral law, and\r\nthose which are transgressions of physical laws. Both classes of sins\r\nare followed by penalties. If a person violates the laws of health,\r\nhe is just as certain to suffer as though he tells a falsehood, steals,\r\nmurders, or commits any other crime. Perfect obedience to all of\r\nnature's laws, including of course all moral laws, is necessary to\r\nperfect health and perfect nobleness of character. The nature of these\r\nlaws and the results of transgression will be understood after we have\r\ntaken a hasty glance at\r\n\r\nThe Marvelous Human Machine which we call the body. All the inventions\r\nand devices ever constructed by the human hand or conceived by the human\r\nmind, no matter how delicate, how intricate and complicated, are simple,\r\nchildish toys compared with that most marvelously wrought mechanism,\r\nthe human body. Let us proceed to take this wonderful machine in pieces\r\nand study its various parts and the manner in which they are put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe Two Objects of Human Existence.--The objects of this wonderfully\r\nformed mechanism are two: 1. The maintenance of an individual life;\r\n2. The production of similar individuals which shall also have the power\r\nof maintaining individual lives. The same may be said of every plant\r\nthat grows, and every animal. Each tree, plant, and shrub has some\r\nuseful service to perform while it lives, in addition to the production\r\nof seed from which other plants may grow. For example, the object of\r\nthe majestic oak which towers high and broadly spreads its leafy\r\nbranches is not to produce acorns merely, but to give place for birds\r\nto build their nests, to present an inviting shade for cattle, and to\r\nafford protection in a variety of ways to numerous living creatures\r\nwhich need such aid. The same may be said of all vegetable growths,\r\neach particular plant having its peculiar purposes to fulfill, and all\r\ntogether acting as purifiers of the air for the benefit of man and lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe principle is equally true as applied to lower animals, as is\r\nevidenced by the numerous ways in which domestic animals are utilized.\r\nIndeed, it seems that the prime purpose of life, not only with all lowly\r\nliving creatures, as plants and animals, but with man as well, is to\r\nlive and act as individuals. But the important function of reproduction,\r\nor producing other similar individuals, though incidental, is\r\nnecessary to the perpetuation of the race or species.\r\n\r\nIn order that an individual human being may live and develop, it is\r\nnecessary that he should eat, drink, digest, and assimilate, and that\r\nhe should be able to move about, to perceive,--that is, to hear, see,\r\nfeel, smell, taste, determine weight and distinguish temperature,--to\r\nthink, and to express ideas in language. In order to keep his vital\r\nmachinery in order, it is necessary that the body should also be able\r\nto repair injuries which may occur in consequence of wear or accident,\r\nand to remove out of the way wornout material which would otherwise\r\nobstruct the working of the delicate machinery of which his body is\r\nconstructed. Each of these functions requires special organs and\r\napparatuses to carry on the work; and these we will now briefly\r\nconsider:--\r\n\r\nThe Nutritive Apparatus.--This consists of organs for the purpose of\r\ntaking in food or nourishment, digesting it, and distributing it\r\nthroughout the body wherever it is needed. These are chiefly the mouth\r\nand teeth for receiving and chewing the food, the stomach and intestines\r\nfor digesting and absorbing it, and the heart and blood-vessels for\r\ndistributing it to the body.\r\n\r\nThe Moving Apparatus.--For the purpose of producing motion, we have\r\nthe muscles and the bones, by which the food is received, masticated,\r\nand swallowed, the blood circulated, the body moved about from place\r\nto place, and speech, expression, respiration, and many other important\r\nfunctions performed.\r\n\r\nThe Thinking and Feeling Apparatus.--The brain and nerves afford the\r\nmeans of thinking and feeling, also giving rise to all the activities\r\nof the body by the production of nerve force. To aid the brain and nerves,\r\nwe have special organs provided, termed the organs of special sense;\r\nas the eye for sight, the ear for hearing, the nose for the detection\r\nof odors, the tongue for tasting, the skin and the mucous membrane for\r\nthe sense of touch.\r\n\r\nThe Purifying Apparatus.--Waste matter accumulates in the body so\r\nrapidly that it is necessary to have abundant and efficient means to\r\nremove the same, and prevent death by obstruction. This work is\r\nperformed by the lungs, liver, kidneys, skin, and mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nEach organ and tissue possesses the power to repair itself. Animal heat,\r\nwhich is also necessary to life, is not produced by any special set\r\nof organs, but results incidentally from the various other processes\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThe Reproductive Apparatus.--As there is a stomach to digest, a brain\r\nto think, a pair of lungs to breathe, etc., so there are special organs\r\nfor reproducing the species or producing new individuals. These organs\r\nhave been carefully described in the preceding portion of this volume,\r\nso that we do not need to repeat the description here. Unlike all the\r\nother organs of the body, they are intended for use only after full\r\ndevelopment or manhood has been attained; consequently, they are only\r\npartially developed in childhood, becoming perfected as the person\r\nbecomes older, especially after about the age of fourteen to eighteen,\r\nwhen puberty occurs. The lungs, the stomach, the muscles, and other\r\norgans must be used constantly from the earliest period of infancy,\r\nhence they are developed sufficiently for efficient use at birth. The\r\nfact that the sexual or reproductive organs are only fully developed\r\nlater on in life, is sufficient evidence that they are intended for\r\nuse only when the body has become fully mature and well developed.\r\n\r\nHow a Noble Character and a Sound Body Must Be Formed.--By obeying all\r\nthe laws which relate to the healthy action of the body and the mind,\r\na noble character and a healthy body may be formed. Any deviation from\r\nright will be sure to be followed by suffering. A boy who carefully\r\nheeds the advice of good and wise parents, who avoids bad company, who\r\nnever indulges in bad habits of any sort, who cultivates purity, honesty,\r\nand manliness, is certain to grow up into a noble, lovely youth, and\r\nto become an intelligent, respected, virtuous man.\r\n\r\nThe Down-Hill Road.--In every large city, and in small ones too, even\r\nin little villages, we can scarcely step upon the street without being\r\npained at meeting little boys who have perhaps scarcely learned to speak\r\ndistinctly, but whose faces show very plainly that they have already\r\ntaken several steps down the steep hillside of vice. All degrees of\r\nwickedness are pictured on the faces of a large proportion of the boys\r\nwe meet upon the streets, loitering about the corners, loafing in hotels,\r\ngroceries, and about bar-room doors. Everywhere we meet small faces\r\nupon which sin and vice are as clearly written as though the words were\r\nactually spelled out. Lying, swearing, smoking, petty stealing, and\r\nbrazen impudence are among the vices which contaminate thousands and\r\nthousands of the boys who are by-and-by to become the _men_ of this\r\ncountry, to constitute its legislators, its educators, its supporters,\r\nand its protectors. Is it possible that such boys can become good,\r\nuseful, noble, trustworthy men? Scarcely. If the seeds of noxious weeds\r\ncan be made to produce useful plants or beautiful flowers, or if a barren,\r\nworthless shrub can be made to bear luscious fruit, then may we expect\r\nto see these vicious boys grow up into virtuous, useful men.\r\n\r\nBut the vices mentioned are not the worst, the traces of which we see\r\nstamped upon the faces of hundreds of boys, some of whom, too, would\r\nscorn to commit any one of the sins named. There is another vice, still\r\nmore terrible, more blighting in its effects, a vice which defiles,\r\ndiseases, and destroys the body, enervates, degrades, and finally\r\ndethrones the mind, debases and ruins the soul. It is to this vice that\r\nwe wish especially to call attention. It is known as\r\n\r\nSelf-Abuse.--Secret vice, masturbation, and self-pollution are other\r\nnames applied to this same awful sin against nature and against God.\r\nWe shall not explain here the exact nature of the sin, as very few boys\r\nare so ignorant or so innocent as to be unacquainted with it. To this\r\nsin and its awful consequences we now wish to call the attention of\r\nall who may read these lines.\r\n\r\nA Dreadful Sin.--The sin of self-pollution is one of the vilest, the\r\nbasest, and the most degrading that a human being can commit. It is\r\nworse than beastly. Those who commit it place themselves far below the\r\nmeanest brute that breathes. The most loathsome reptile, rolling in\r\nthe slush and slime of its stagnant pool, would not bemean itself thus.\r\nIt is true that monkeys sometimes have the habit, but only when they\r\nhave been taught it by vile men or boys. A boy who is thus guilty ought\r\nto be ashamed to look into the eyes of an honest dog. Such a boy naturally\r\nshuns the company of those who are pure and innocent. He cannot look\r\nwith assurance into his mother's face. It is difficult for any one to\r\ncatch his eye, even for a few seconds. He feels his guilt and acts it\r\nout, thus making it known to every one. Let such a boy think how he\r\nmust appear in the eyes of the Almighty. Let him only think of the angels,\r\npure, innocent, and holy, who are eye-witnesses of his shameful\r\npractices. Is not the thought appalling? Would he dare commit such a\r\nsin in the presence of his father, his mother, or his sisters? No, indeed.\r\nHow, then, will he dare to defile himself in the presence of Him from\r\nwhose all-seeing eye nothing is hid?\r\n\r\nThe Bible utters the most solemn warnings against sexual sins. The\r\ninhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by fire and brimstone\r\nfor such transgressions. Onan was struck dead in the act of committing\r\na vileness of this sort. For similar vices the wicked inhabitants of\r\nPalestine were destroyed, and their lands given to the Hebrews. For\r\na single violation of the seventh commandment, one of the most notable\r\nBible characters, David, suffered to the day of his death. Those who\r\nimagine that this sin is not a transgression of the seventh commandment\r\nmay be assured that this most heinous, revolting, and unnatural vice\r\nis in every respect more pernicious, more debasing, and more immoral\r\nthan what is generally considered as violation of the commandment which\r\nsays, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" and is itself a most flagrant\r\nviolation of the same commandment.\r\n\r\nThose who imagine that they \"have a right to do as they please with\r\nthemselves,\" so long as no one else is immediately affected, must learn\r\nthat we are not our own masters; we belong to our Creator, and are\r\naccountable to God not only for the manner in which we treat our\r\nfellow-men, but for how we treat ourselves, for the manner in which\r\nwe use the bodies which he has given us. The man who commits suicide,\r\nwho takes his own life, is a murderer as much as he who kills a\r\nfellow-man. So, also, he who pollutes himself in the manner we are\r\nconsidering, violates the seventh commandment, although the crime is in\r\nboth cases committed against himself. Think of this, ye youth who defile\r\nyourselves in secret and seek to escape the punishment of sin. In Heaven\r\na faithful record of your vile commandment-breaking is kept, and you\r\nmust meet it by-and-by. You are fixing your fate for eternity; and each\r\ndaily act in some degree determines what it shall be. Are you a victim\r\nof this fascinating vice, stop, repent, reform, before you are forever\r\nruined, a mental, moral, and physical wreck.\r\n\r\nSelf-Murderers.--Of all the vices to which human beings are addicted,\r\nno other so rapidly undermines the constitution and so certainly makes\r\na complete wreck of an individual as this, especially when the habit\r\nis begun at an early age. It wastes the most precious part of the blood,\r\nuses up the vital forces, and finally leaves the poor victim a most\r\nutterly ruined and loathsome object. If a boy should be deprived of\r\nboth hands and feet and should lose his eyesight, he would still be\r\ninfinitely better off than the boy who for years gives himself up to\r\nthe gratification of lust in secret vice. For such a boy to become a\r\nstrong, vigorous man is just as impossible as it would be to make a\r\nmammoth tree out of a currant bush. Such a man will necessarily be\r\nshort-lived. He will always suffer from the effects of his folly, even\r\nthough he shall marry. If he has children--he may become\r\nincapable--they will be quite certain to be puny, weak, scrofulous,\r\nconsumptive, rickety, nervous, depraved in body and mind, or otherwise\r\ndeprived of the happiness which grows out of the possession of \"a sound\r\nmind in a sound body.\"\r\n\r\nLet us notice a little more closely the terrible effects resulting from\r\nthis most unnatural and abominable vice.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Boys Dwarfs.--How many times have we seen boys who were born\r\nwith good constitutions, with force and stamina sufficient to develop\r\nthem into large, vigorous men, become puny dwarfs. At the time when\r\nthey ought to begin to grow and develop more rapidly than ever before,\r\ntheir growth is checked and they cease to develop. They are, in fact,\r\nstunted, dwarfed, like a plant which has a canker-worm eating away at\r\nits roots. Indeed, there is a veritable canker-worm sapping their\r\nvitality, undermining their constitutions, and destroying their\r\nprospects for time and for eternity. Anxious friends may attribute the\r\nunhappy change to overwork, overstudy, or some similar cause; but from\r\na somewhat extended observation we are thoroughly convinced that the\r\nvery vice which we are considering is the viper which blights the\r\nprospects and poisons the existence of many of these promising boys.\r\n\r\nA boy who gives himself up to the practice of secret vice at an early\r\nage, say as early as seven to ten years of age, is certain to make himself\r\na wreck. Instead of having a healthy, vigorous body, with strong muscles\r\nand a hardy constitution, he will be weak, scrawny, sickly, always\r\ncomplaining, never well, and will never know anything about that joyous\r\nexuberance of life and animal spirits which the young antelope feels\r\nas it bounds over the plain, or the vigorous young colt as it frisks\r\nabout its pasture, and which every youth ought to feel.\r\n\r\nScrawny, Hollow-Eyed Boys.--Boys ought to be fresh and vigorous as\r\nlittle lambs. They ought to be plump, rosy, bright-eyed, and sprightly.\r\nA boy who is pale, scrawny, hollow-eyed, dull, listless, has something\r\nthe matter with him. Self-abuse makes thousands of just such boys every\r\nyear; and it is just such boys that make vicious, shiftless, haggard,\r\nunhappy men. This horrible vice steals away the health and vitality\r\nwhich are needed to develop the body and the mind; and the lad that\r\nought to make his mark in the world, that ought to become a distinguished\r\nstatesman, orator, clergyman, physician, or author, becomes little\r\nmore than a living animal, a mere shadow of what he ought to have been.\r\n\r\nOld Boys.--Often have we felt sad when we have heard fond mothers\r\nspeaking in glowing terms of the old ways of their sons, and rather\r\nglorying that they looked so much older than they were. In nine cases\r\nout of ten these old-looking boys owe their appearance to this vile\r\nhabit; for it is exceedingly common, and its dreadful effects in\r\nshriveling and dwarfing and destroying the human form are too plainly\r\nperceptible, when present, to be mistaken. Oh! this dreadful curse!\r\nWhy will so many of our bright, innocent boys pollute themselves with\r\nit!\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Idiots.--Reader, have you ever seen an idiot? If you have,\r\nthe hideous picture will never be dissipated from your memory. The\r\nvacant stare, the drooping, drooling mouth, the unsteady gait, the\r\nsensual look, the emptiness of mind,--all these you will well remember.\r\nDid you ever stop to think how idiots are made? It is by this very vice\r\nthat the ranks of these poor daft mortals are being recruited every\r\nday. Every visitor to an insane asylum sees scores of them; ruined in\r\nmind and body, only the semblance of a human being, bereft of sense,\r\nlower than a beast in many respects, a human being hopelessly lost to\r\nhimself and to the world!--oh, most terrible thought!--yet once pure,\r\nintelligent, active, perhaps the hope of a fond mother, the pride of\r\na doting father, and possibly possessed of natural ability to become\r\ngreatly distinguished in some of the many noble and useful walks of\r\nlife; now sunk below the brute through the degrading, destroying\r\ninfluence of a lustful gratification.\r\n\r\nBoys, are you guilty of this terrible sin? have you even once in this\r\nway yielded to the tempter's voice? Stop, consider, think of the awful\r\nresults, repent, confess to God, reform. Another step in that direction\r\nand you may be lost, soul and body. You cannot dally with the tempter.\r\nYou must escape now or never. Don't delay.\r\n\r\nYoung Dyspeptics.--If we leave out of the consideration the effects\r\nof bad food and worse cookery, there is in our estimation no other cause\r\nso active in occasioning the early breaking down of the digestive organs\r\nof our American boys. A boy of ten or twelve years of age ought to have\r\na stomach capable of digesting anything not absolutely indigestible;\r\nbut there are to-day thousands and thousands of boys of that age whose\r\nstomachs are so impaired as to be incapable of digesting any but the\r\nmost simple food. The digestion being ruined, the teeth soon follow\r\nsuit. Hardly one boy in a dozen has perfectly sound teeth. With a bad\r\nstomach and bad teeth, a foundation for disease is laid which is sure\r\nto result in early decay of the whole body.\r\n\r\nIn this awful vice do we find a cause, too, for the thousands of cases\r\nof consumption in young men. At the very time when they ought to be\r\nin their prime, they break down in health and become helpless invalids\r\nfor life, or speedily sink into an early grave.\r\n\r\nUpon their tombstones might justly be graven, \"Here lies a\r\nself-murderer.\" Providence is not to blame; nor is climate, weather,\r\noverwork, overstudy, or any other even seemingly plausible cause, to\r\nbe blamed. Their own sins have sunk them in mental, moral, and physical\r\nperdition. Such a victim literally dies by his own hand, a veritable\r\nsuicide. Appalling thought! It is a grand thing to die for one's\r\nprinciples, a martyr to his love of right and truth. One may die\r\nblameless who is the victim of some dire contagious malady which he\r\ncould not avoid; even the poor, downcast misanthrope whose hopes are\r\nblighted and whose sorrows multiplied, may possibly be in some degree\r\nexcused for wishing to end his misery with his life; but the wretched\r\nbeing who sheds his life-blood by the disgusting maneuvers of\r\nself-pollution--what can be said to extenuate _his_ guilt? His is a\r\ndouble crime. Let him pass from the memory of his fellow-men. He will\r\nperish, overwhelmed with his own vileness. Let him die, and return to\r\nthe dust from which he sprang.\r\n\r\nThe Race Ruined by Boys.--The human race is growing steadily weaker\r\nyear by year. The boys of to-day would be no match in physical strength\r\nfor the sturdy youths of a century ago who are now their grandparents.\r\nAn immense amount of skillful training enables now and then one to\r\naccomplish some wonderful feat of walking, rowing, or swimming, but\r\nwe hear very little of remarkable feats of labor accomplished by our\r\nmodern boys. Even the country boys of to-day cannot endure the hard\r\nwork which their fathers accomplished at the same age; and we doubt\r\nnot that this growing physical weakness is one of the reasons why so\r\nlarge a share of the boys whose fathers are farmers, and who have been\r\nreared on farms, are unwilling to follow the occupation of their fathers\r\nfor a livelihood. They are too weakly to do the work required by an\r\nagricultural life, even by the aid of the numerous labor-saving\r\ninventions of the age.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that is undermining the health of the race and sapping the\r\nconstitutions of our American men? No doubt much may be attributed to\r\nthe unnatural refinements of civilization in several directions; but\r\nthere can be no doubt that vice is the most active cause of all. Secret\r\nsin and its kindred vices yearly ruin more constitutions than hard work,\r\nsevere study, hunger, cold, privation, and disease combined.\r\n\r\nBoys, the destiny of the race is in your hands. You can do more than\r\nall the doctors, all the scientists and most eminent political men in\r\nthe world, to secure the prosperity and future greatness of the nation,\r\nby taking care of yourselves, by being pure, noble, true to yourselves\r\nand to the demands of high moral principle.\r\n\r\nCases Illustrating the Effects of Self-Abuse.--The land is full of poor\r\nhuman wrecks who have dashed in pieces their hopes for this world, and\r\ntoo often for the next also, against this hideous rock which lies hidden\r\nin the pathway of every young man who starts out upon life's stormy\r\nvoyage. Gladly would we draw the veil and cover them with all their\r\ndreadful deformities with the mantle of charity from the gaze of their\r\nfellow-beings; but their number is so great that this could scarcely\r\nbe done, and the lesson to be learned from their sad fate is such a\r\ngrave one, and so needful for the good of the generation of young men\r\nwho are just encountering the same dangers, that we cannot resist the\r\npromptings of duty to present a few examples of the effects of vice\r\nin men and boys that have fallen under our own observation. We have\r\nseen hundreds of cases of this sort; have treated many scores of persons\r\nfor the effects of the terrible crime which we are seeking to sound\r\na warning against, and the number of cases we might describe would fill\r\na volume; but we will select only a very few.\r\n\r\nTwo Young Wrecks.--Charles and Oscar B---- were the sons of a farmer\r\nin a Western State, aged respectively ten and twelve years. They\r\npossessed well-formed heads, and once had beautiful faces, and were\r\nas bright and sprightly as any little boys of their age to be found\r\nanywhere. Their father was proud of them, and their fond mother took\r\ngreat pleasure in building bright prospects for her darling sons when\r\nthey should attain maturity and become competent to fill useful and\r\nhonorable positions in the world. Living in a rapidly-growing Western\r\ncommunity, they had every prospect of growing up to honorable\r\nusefulness, a comfort to their parents, a blessing to the world, and\r\ncapable of enjoying life in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly certain manifestations appeared which gave rise to grave\r\napprehensions on the part of the parents. It was observed that the elder\r\nof the little boys no longer played about with that nimbleness which\r\nhe had formerly shown, but seemed slow and stiff in his movements.\r\nSometimes, indeed, he would stagger a little when he walked. Soon, also,\r\nhis speech became affected in some degree; he mumbled his words and\r\ncould not speak distinctly. In spite of all that could be done, the\r\ndisease continued, increasing slowly in all its symptoms from week to\r\nweek. Soon the hands, also, became affected, so that the little boy\r\ncould not feed himself. The mind now began to fail. The bright eyes\r\nbecame vacant and expressionless. Instead of the merry light which used\r\nto shine in them, there was a blank, idiotic stare.\r\n\r\nImagine the grief and anguish of the poor mother! No one but a mother\r\nwho has been called to pass through a similar trial could know how to\r\nsympathize with such a one. Her darling son she saw daily becoming a\r\nprey to a strange, incurable malady, with no power even to stay the\r\nprogress of the terrible disease.\r\n\r\nBut there was still greater grief in store for her. Within a year or\r\ntwo the younger son began to show symptoms of the same character, and\r\nin spite of all that was done, rapidly sank into the same helpless state\r\nas his brother. As a last resort, the mother took her boys and came\r\na long journey to place her sons under our care. At that time they were\r\nboth nearly helpless. Neither could walk but a few steps. They reeled\r\nand staggered about like drunken men, falling down upon each other and\r\ngoing through the most agonizing contortions in their attempts to work\r\ntheir way from one chair to another and thus about the room. Their heads\r\nwere no longer erect, but drooped like wilted flowers. On their faces\r\nwas a blank, imbecile expression, with a few traces of former\r\nintelligence still left. The mouth was open, from the drooping of the\r\nlower jaw, and the saliva constantly dribbled upon the clothing.\r\nAltogether, it was a spectacle which one does not care to meet every\r\nday; the impression made was too harrowing to be pleasant even from\r\nits interest from a scientific point of view.\r\n\r\nWe at once set to work to discover the cause of this dreadful condition,\r\nsaying to ourselves that such an awful punishment should certainly be\r\nthe result of some gross violation of nature's laws somewhere. The most\r\ncareful scrutiny of the history of the parents of the unfortunate lads\r\ngave us no clue to anything of an hereditary character, both parents\r\nhaving come of good families, and having been always of sober, temperate\r\nhabits. The father had used neither liquor nor tobacco in any form.\r\nThe mother could give no light on the matter, and we were obliged to\r\nrest for the time being upon the conviction which fastened itself upon\r\nus that the cases before us were most marked illustrations of the\r\nresults of self-abuse begun at a very early age. The mother thought\r\nit impossible that our suspicions could be correct, saying that she\r\nhad watched her sons with jealous care from earliest infancy and had\r\nseen no indications of any error of the sort. But we had not long to\r\nwait for confirmation of our view of the case, as they were soon caught\r\nin the act, to which it was found that they were greatly addicted, and\r\nthe mystery was wholly solved.\r\n\r\nEvery possible remedy was used to check the terrible disease which was\r\npreying upon the unfortunate boys, but in vain. At times the symptoms\r\nwould be somewhat mitigated, and the most sanguine hopes of the fond,\r\nwatching mother would be excited, but in vain. The improvement always\r\nproved to be but temporary, and the poor sufferers would speedily\r\nrelapse into the same dreadful condition again, and gradually grew\r\nworse. At last, the poor mother was obliged to give up all hope, in\r\nutter despair watching the daily advances of the awful malady which\r\ninch by inch destroyed the life, the humanity, the very mind and soul\r\nof her once promising sons. Sadly she took them back to her Western\r\nhome, there to see them suffer, perhaps for years before death should\r\nkindly release them, the terrible penalty of sin committed almost\r\nbefore they had arrived at years of responsibility.\r\n\r\nHow these mere infants learned the vice we were never able to determine.\r\nWe have no doubt that opportunities sufficient were presented them,\r\nas the parents seemed to have very little appreciation of danger from\r\nthis source. Had greater vigilance been exercised, we doubt not that\r\nthe discovery of the vice at the beginning would have resulted in the\r\nsalvation of these two beautiful boys, who were sacrificed upon the\r\naltar of concupiscence. Two or three years after we first saw the cases,\r\nwe heard from them, and though still alive, their condition was almost\r\ntoo horrible for description. Three or four similar cases have come\r\nto our knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoys, are you guilty? Think of the fearful fate of these boys, once\r\nas joyous and healthy as you. When you are tempted to sin, think of\r\nthe fearful picture of the effects of sin which they present. Have you\r\never once dared to commit this awful sin? Stop, never dare to do the\r\nthing again. Take a solemn vow before God to be pure. Your fate may\r\nbe as sad, your punishment as terrible. No one can tell what the results\r\nmay be. Absolute purity is the only safe course.\r\n\r\nA Prodigal Youth.--A. M., son of a gentleman of wealth in Ohio, early\r\nacquired the evil practice which has ruined so many bright lads. He\r\nwas naturally an intelligent and prepossessing lad, and his father gave\r\nhim as good an education as he could be induced to acquire, affording\r\nhim most excellent opportunities for study and improvement. But the\r\nvile habit which had been acquired at an early age speedily began its\r\nblighting influence. It destroyed his taste for study and culture. His\r\nmind dwelt upon low and vile subjects. He grew restless of home\r\nrestraint and surroundings, and finally left the parental roof.\r\nWandering from city to city he grew rapidly worse, sinking into deeper\r\ndepths of vice, until finally he became a base, besotted, wretched\r\ncreature. Broken down in health by his sins, he could no longer enjoy\r\neven the worst sensual pleasures, and with no taste for or capability\r\nof appreciating anything higher he was most wretched indeed. The poor\r\nfellow now fell into the hands of quacks. His kind father sent him money\r\nin answer to his pitiful appeals for help, and he went anxiously from\r\none to another of the wretched villains who promise relief to such\r\nsufferers but only rob them of their money and leave them worse than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAt last, in total despair of everything else, the poor fellow came to\r\nus. He seemed quite broken-hearted and penitent for his sins, and really\r\nappeared to want to lead a better life if he could only be made well\r\nagain. We faithfully pointed out to him the dreadful wickedness of his\r\ncourse, and the fact that a cure could only be effected by the most\r\nimplicit obedience to all of nature's laws during his whole future life.\r\nIndeed, we were obliged to inform him of the sad fact that he could\r\nnever be as well as before, that he must always suffer in consequence\r\nof his dreadful course of transgression. We gave him a most earnest\r\nexhortation to begin the work of reform where alone it could be\r\neffectual, by reforming his heart, and the tears which coursed down\r\nhis sin-scarred cheeks seemed to indicate true penitence and a real\r\ndesire to return to the paths of purity and peace.\r\n\r\nEarnestly we labored for this young man, for months, employing every\r\nmeans in our power to lift him from the slough of sin and vice upon\r\nthe solid pathway of virtue and purity again. Gradually the hard lines\r\non his face seemed to lessen in intensity. The traces of vice and crime\r\nseemed to be fading out by degrees. We began to entertain hopes of his\r\nultimate recovery. But alas! in an evil moment, through the influence\r\nof bad companions, he fell, and for some time we lost sight of him.\r\nA long time afterward we caught a glimpse of his bloated, sin-stained\r\nface, just as he was turning to skulk away to avoid recognition. Where\r\nthis poor human wreck is now leading his miserable existence we cannot\r\nsay, but have no doubt he is haunting the dens of iniquity and sin in\r\nthe cities, seeking to find a little momentary pleasure in the\r\ngratification of his appetites and passions. A hopeless wreck, with\r\nthe lines of vice and crime drawn all over his tell-tale countenance,\r\nhe dares not go home, for he fears to meet the reproachful glance of\r\nhis doting mother, and the scornful looks of his brothers and sisters.\r\nWe never saw a more thoroughly unhappy creature. He is fully conscious\r\nof his condition; he sees himself to be a wreck, in mind, in body, and\r\nknows that he is doomed to suffer still more in consequence of his vices.\r\nHe has no hope for this world or the next. His mother gave him earnest,\r\npious instructions, which he has never forgotten, though he has long\r\ntried to smother them. He now looks forward with terror to the fate\r\nwhich he well knows awaits all evil-doers, and shudders at the thought,\r\nbut seems powerless to enter the only avenue which affords a chance\r\nof escape. He is so tormented with the pains and diseased conditions\r\nwhich he has brought upon himself by vice that he often looks to\r\nself-destruction as a grateful means of escape; but then comes the awful\r\nforeboding of future punishment, and his hand is stayed. Ashamed to\r\nmeet his friends, afraid to meet his Maker, he wanders about, an exile,\r\nan outcast, a hopeless wreck.\r\n\r\nYoung man, youth, have you taken the first step on this evil road? If\r\nso, take warning by the fate of this young man. At once \"cease to do\r\nevil and learn to do well,\" before, like him, you lose the power to\r\ndo right, before your will is paralyzed by sin so that when you desire\r\nto do right, to reform, your will and power to execute your good\r\ndeterminations will fail to support your effort.\r\n\r\nBarely Escaped.--L. R. of H----, a young man of about twenty-five years\r\nof age, presented himself for treatment, a few years ago, for the\r\nconsequence of self-abuse. Having been taught the habit by evil\r\ncompanions when just emerging into manhood, he had indulged his\r\npassions without restraint for several years, not knowing the evil\r\nconsequences until he began to suffer the effects of sin. Then, being\r\nwarned by his own experience and by the fortunate thoughtfulness of\r\nan intelligent friend who surmised his condition and told him\r\nfaithfully of the terrible results of the vile habit, he made a manly\r\neffort to reform and claimed to have wholly broken the habit. To his\r\ngreat grief he found, however, that the years in which he had devoted\r\nhimself to sin had wrought sad havoc in his system. In many ways his\r\nhealth was greatly deranged and his once powerful constitution was\r\nbroken down. The sexual organs themselves were greatly diseased, so\r\nmuch so that a serious and painful surgical operation was necessary.\r\nWith shame and mortification he looked upon his past life and saw what\r\na hideous work of evil he had wrought. His vileness stood out before\r\nhim in a vivid light, and he felt ashamed to meet the gaze of his fellows.\r\n\r\nAfter performing the necessary surgical operation upon this poor\r\nunfortunate, we dealt faithfully with him, pointing out to him the way\r\nby which he might with proper effort in some degree redeem himself by\r\na life-long struggle against every form of impurity. He felt, and\r\nrightly, that the task was a most severe one. He well knew that the\r\nstamp of sin was on his countenance, and in his mind. Thoughts long\r\nallowed to run upon vile subjects, forming filthy pictures in the\r\nimagination, are not easily brought back to the channel of purity and\r\nvirtue. The mind that has learned to love to riot in impure dreams,\r\ndoes not readily acquire a love for the opposite. But he determined\r\nto make a brave and earnest effort, and we have every reason to believe\r\nthat he has, in a measure at least, succeeded. But, if so, he has made\r\na narrow escape. A few more years of sin, and his rescue would have\r\nbeen impossible; both mind and body would have been sunk so deep in\r\nthe mire of concupiscence that none but Almighty power could have saved\r\nhim from utter destruction. Thousands of boys and young men are to-day\r\nstanding on the slippery brink of that awful precipice from which but\r\nvery few are snatched away. Soon they will plunge headlong over into\r\nthe abyss of debasement and corruption from whence they will never\r\nescape. Oh that we had the power to reach each one of these unfortunate\r\nyouth before it is too late, and to utter in their ears such warnings,\r\nto portray before them such pictures of the sure results of a course\r\nof sin, that they might be turned back to the paths of chastity and\r\nvirtue before they have become such mental, moral, and physical wrecks\r\nas we every day encounter in the walks of life. But not one in a thousand\r\ncan be reached when they have gone so far in sin. When they have ventured\r\nonce, they can rarely be checked in their downward course until great\r\nharm has been wrought which it will require the work of years to undo.\r\nThe young man we have referred to made indeed a narrow escape, but no\r\none can safely run such a risk. Even he must suffer all his life the\r\nconsequences of a few years of sin.\r\n\r\nA Lost Soul.--M. M., of ----, was the son of a mechanic in humble\r\ncircumstances. He was an only child, and his parents spared no pains\r\nto do all in their power to insure his becoming a good and useful man.\r\nGood school advantages were given him, and at a proper age he was put\r\nto learn a trade. He succeeded fairly, and their hopes of his becoming\r\nall that they could desire were great, when he suddenly began to\r\nmanifest peculiar symptoms. He had attended a religious revival and\r\nseemed much affected, professing religion and becoming a member of a\r\nchurch. To the exercises of his mind on the subject of religion his\r\nfriends attributed his peculiar actions, which soon became so strange\r\nas to excite grave fears that his mind was seriously affected. At times\r\nhe was wild, showing such unmistakable evidences of insanity that even\r\nhis poor mother, who was loth to believe the sad truth, was forced to\r\nadmit that he was deranged.\r\n\r\nAfter a few months a change came over him which encouraged his friends\r\nto think that he was recovering. He became quiet and tractable, never\r\nmanifesting the furious symptoms before observed. But the deception\r\nwas only temporary, for it was soon evident that the change was simply\r\nthe result of the progress of the disease and denoted the failure of\r\nthe mental powers and the approach of imbecility. In this condition\r\nwas the young man when he came under our care. We felt strongly impressed\r\nfrom our first examination of the case that it was one of sexual abuse;\r\nbut we were assured by his friends in the most emphatic manner that\r\nsuch was an impossibility. It was claimed that the most scrupulous care\r\nhad been bestowed upon him, and that he had been so closely watched\r\nthat it was impossible that he should have been guilty of so gross a\r\nvice. His friends were disposed to attribute his sad condition to\r\nexcessive exercise of mind upon religious subjects.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this view of the case, we set a close watch upon\r\nhim, and within a week his nurse reported that he had detected him in\r\nthe act of self-pollution, when he confessed the truth, not yet being\r\nso utterly devoid of sense as to have lost his appreciation of the\r\nsinfulness of the act. When discovered, he exclaimed, \"I know I have\r\nmade myself a fool,\" which was the exact truth. At this time the once\r\nbright and intelligent youth had become so obtuse and stupid that he\r\nappeared almost senseless. His face wore an idiotic expression which\r\nwas rarely lighted up by a look of intelligence. It was only by the\r\ngreatest exertion that he could be made to understand or to respond\r\nwhen spoken to. In whatever position he was placed, whether lying,\r\nsitting, or standing, no matter how constrained or painful, he would\r\nremain for hours, staring vacantly, and fixed and immovable as a statue.\r\nHis countenance was blank and expressionless except at rare intervals.\r\nHis lips were always parted, and the saliva ran from the corners of\r\nhis mouth down upon his clothing. The calls of nature were responded\r\nto involuntarily, soiling constantly his clothing and bedding in a most\r\ndisgusting manner, and requiring the constant attention of a nurse to\r\nkeep him in anything like a wholesome condition.\r\n\r\nWe did what we could to relieve this poor victim of unhallowed lust,\r\nbut soon became convinced that no human arm could save from utter ruin\r\nthis self-destroyed soul. At our suggestion the young man was removed\r\nto be placed in an institution devoted to the care of imbeciles and\r\nlunatics. The last we heard of the poor fellow he was still sinking\r\ninto lower depths of physical and mental degradation,--a soul utterly\r\nlost and ruined. How many thousands of young men who might have been\r\nuseful members of society, lawyers, clergymen, statesmen, scientists,\r\nhave thus sunk into the foul depths of the quagmire of vice, to rise\r\nno more forever! Oh, awful fate! The human eye never rests upon a sadder\r\nsight than a ruined soul, a mind shattered and debased by vice.\r\n\r\nThe Results of One Transgression.--The following case is a good\r\nillustration of the fact that a long course of transgression is not\r\nnecessary to occasion the most serious results. A young man from an\r\nEastern State who visited us for treatment was suffering with the usual\r\nconsequences of self-abuse, but he asserted in the most emphatic manner\r\nthat he had never committed the act of self-pollution but once in his\r\nlife. He had, however, after that one vile act, allowed his mind to\r\nrun upon vile thoughts, giving loose rein to his imagination, and in\r\nconsequence he found himself as badly off, suffering with the very same\r\ndisorders, as those who had practiced the vice for some time.\r\n\r\nNot the slightest dallying with sin is safe. The maintenance of perfect\r\npurity and chastity of body and mind is the only right and safe course.\r\nBy a few months' treatment the young man recovered his health in a great\r\nmeasure, and, marrying an estimable young lady, settled down happily\r\nin life. Many tears of remorse and repentance did he shed over that\r\none sinful act, and bitterly did he reproach the evil companion who\r\ntaught him to sin; but he was fortunate enough to escape without\r\nsuffering the worst effects of sin, and is now living happily.\r\n\r\nA Hospital Case.--One of the most wretched creatures we ever saw among\r\nthe many sufferers from sexual excesses whom we have met, was a man\r\nof about thirty years of age whom we found in the large Charity Hospital\r\non Blackwell's Island, New York City. In consequence of long indulgence\r\nin the soul-and-body destroying habit, he had brought upon himself not\r\nonly the most serious and painful disease of the sexual organs\r\nthemselves, but disease of the bladder and other adjacent organs. He\r\nwas under severe and painful treatment for a long time without benefit,\r\nand finally a surgical operation was performed, but with the result\r\nof affording only partial relief.\r\n\r\nAn Old Offender.--Never were we more astonished than at the depth of\r\ndepravity revealed to us by the confessions of a patient from a distant\r\ncountry who was upwards of sixty years of age and was yet a victim of\r\nthe vile habit to which he had become addicted when a youth. The stamp\r\nof vice was on his face, and was not hidden by the lines made by advancing\r\nage. The sufferings which this ancient sinner endured daily in\r\nconsequence of his long course of sin were sometimes fearful to behold;\r\nand yet he continued the habit in spite of all warnings, advice, and\r\nevery influence which could be brought to bear upon him. So long had\r\nhe transgressed, he had lost his sense of shame and his appreciation\r\nof the vileness of sin, and it was impossible to reform him by any means\r\nwhich could be brought to bear upon him. He left us still a sufferer,\r\nthough somewhat relieved, and, we have every reason to believe, as vile\r\na sinner as ever. Undoubtedly, before this time his worthless life is\r\nended, and he has gone down into a sinner's grave, hoary with vice.\r\nA terrible end.\r\n\r\nThe Sad End of a Young Victim.--C. L., a young man residing in a large\r\nSouthern city, was the youngest son of parents who were in moderate\r\ncircumstances, but appreciated the value of education, and were anxious\r\nto give their children every advantage possible for them to receive.\r\nWith this end in view, the young man was sent to college, where he did\r\nwell for a time, being naturally studious and intelligent; but after\r\na brief period he began to drop behind his classes. He seemed moody\r\nand obtuse. He could not complete his tasks even by the most severe\r\napplication. It seemed impossible for him to apply himself. The power\r\nof concentration appeared to be lost. Soon he was seized by fits of\r\ngloominess from which he did not seem to have power to free himself.\r\nHis strength began to fail to such a degree that he could hardly drag\r\nhimself to his meals, and at last he was almost confined to his room.\r\nHe became greatly emaciated. The failure of his mental powers seemed\r\nto keep pace with the wasting of his body, so that it was soon evident\r\nthat he must abandon all hope of pursuing his studies for some time\r\nat least. His case being brought to our notice, we gave him every\r\nattention possible, and spared no effort to rescue him from his\r\ncondition. We readily perceived the cause of his troubles, but for a\r\nlong time he did not acknowledge the truth. At last he confessed that\r\nhe had sinned for years in the manner suspected, and was suffering the\r\nconsequences. A knowledge of his guilt weighed upon him and haunted\r\nhim day and night. He promised to reform; but if he did, it was too\r\nlate, for the wasting disease which was fastened upon him continued.\r\nAt his mother's request he returned to his home, and a few weeks later\r\nwe received the awful intelligence that he had ended his miserable life\r\nby blowing out his brains with a pistol. Thus tragically ended the\r\ncareer of this young man, who might, with the advantages afforded him,\r\nhave become a useful member of society. In total despair of this life\r\nor the next, he rashly ended his probation, and with his own hand\r\nfinished the work of destruction which he had himself begun. No words\r\ncan tell the grief of his stricken mother; but, fortunately, she was\r\nspared the knowledge of the whole truth, else would her sorrow have\r\nbeen too great to bear.\r\n\r\nFrom Bad to Worse.--C. E., a young man from the West, was sent to us\r\nby his father with the request that we would do what we could to save\r\nhim. His father's letter intimated that the son had been a source of\r\ngrief to him, but he hoped that he had repented of his prodigal course,\r\nand was really determined to reform. Though scarcely more than twenty\r\nyears of age, the young man's face wore an aspect of hardness, from\r\nfamiliarity with vice, that we have rarely seen. He was reduced to a\r\nmere skeleton by the vice which he made no secret of, and was so weak\r\nthat he could scarcely walk a rod. It seemed as if every organ in his\r\nbody was diseased, and that he had so squandered his vital resources\r\nthat he had no power to rally from his wretched condition even should\r\nhe carry out the determination to reform which he announced. However,\r\nwe gave him the best counsel and advice within our power, and placed\r\nhim under treatment. After a few weeks it was evident that nature was\r\nstill willing to respond to his endeavors to reform, by vigorous efforts\r\nto restore him to a condition of comparative health. Thus he was\r\nsnatched, as it appeared, from the very jaws of death. Under these\r\ncircumstances it would seem that the most hardened criminal would\r\nreform, at least for a season, and lead a life of rectitude; but so\r\nutterly depraved was this poor wretch that no sooner did he find that\r\nhe was not liable to die immediately than he began at once again his\r\ncareer of sin. By long indulgence his moral sense had become, apparently,\r\nobliterated. He seemed to be utterly without the restraint imposed by\r\nconscience. In less than a month he was detected in the crime of theft,\r\nhaving stolen a watch from a fellow-patient. Upon his arrest,\r\nstimulated by the hope of in some degree mitigating his punishment,\r\nhe confessed to have been carrying on a series of petty thieving for\r\nweeks before he was finally detected, having scores of stolen articles\r\nin his possession. The last time we saw the wretched fellow he was being\r\nled away in irons to prison. We have since heard that he continues in\r\nhis downward career, having served out his time in prison, and will\r\nundoubtedly end his life in a felon's cell unless he is shrewd enough\r\nto escape his just deserts. Having lost all desire to do right, to be\r\nnoble, pure, and good, all efforts to reform and restore him to the\r\npath of rectitude were fruitless. It was only the fear of impending\r\ndeath that caused him to pause for a few days in his criminal course.\r\nYoung man, take warning by this sad case; enter not the pathway of vice.\r\nA course of vice once entered upon is not easily left. A youth who once\r\ngives himself up to sin, rarely escapes from going headlong to\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nAn Indignant Father.--A case came to our knowledge through a gentleman\r\nwho brought his daughter to us for treatment for the effects of\r\nself-abuse, of a father who adopted a summary method of curing his son\r\nof the evil practice. Having discovered that the lad was a victim of\r\nthe vile habit, and having done all in his power by punishment, threats,\r\nand representations of its terrible effects, but without inducing him\r\nto reform, the father, in a fit of desperation, seized the sinful boy\r\nand with his own hand performed upon him the operation of castration\r\nas he would have done upon a colt. The boy recovered from the operation,\r\nand was of course effectually cured of his vile habit. The remedy was\r\nefficient, though scarcely justifiable. Even a father has no right thus\r\nto mutilate his own son, though we must confess that the lad's chances\r\nfor becoming a useful man are fully as good as they would have been\r\nhad he continued his course of sin.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with Life.--T. A. was a young man of promise, the son of\r\nambitious parents, proud-spirited, and without respect for religion.\r\nWhile still quite young he enlisted in the service of the government,\r\nand after a time rose to the position of an officer in the U. S. army.\r\nHaving in boyhood acquired the habit of self-abuse, he had stimulated\r\nhis passions without restraint, and was readily led still farther\r\nastray by the evil companions with whom he was surrounded. He indulged\r\nhis passions in every way and on every occasion when he found\r\nopportunity, and speedily began to feel the effects of his vices. Before\r\nhe was fully aware of his condition, he found himself being literally\r\ndevoured by the vilest of all diseases, which only those who transgress\r\nin this manner suffer. The disease made rapid advances and speedily\r\nreduced him to a condition of almost absolute helplessness. He was\r\nobliged to obtain a furlough; but his vital forces were so nearly\r\nexhausted that he did not rally even under skillful treatment; and when\r\nhis furlough expired, he was still in the same pitiable condition.\r\nGetting it extended for a time, he by accident came under our care,\r\nand by the aid of very thorough treatment he was in a measure improved,\r\nthough the progress of the disease was simply stayed. When apprized\r\nof his real condition, he exhibited much agitation, walking nervously\r\nabout his room, and finally exclaimed that he was utterly disgusted\r\nwith life anyway, and after a few weeks or months more of suffering\r\nhe should blow his brains out and end his misery. He had no fears of\r\ndeath, he said, and we presume that he could not imagine it possible\r\nthat there was any greater suffering in store for him than he already\r\nendured. We pitied the poor fellow from the bottom of our heart. He\r\nhad natural qualities which ought to have made him distinguished. He\r\nmight have risen high in the world of usefulness. Now he was compelled\r\nto look back upon a short life of squandered opportunities, a pathway\r\nstained with vice, memories of vile debaucheries which had wasted his\r\nyouth and broken his constitution. Wretched was he indeed.\r\nNotwithstanding his vileness he was not lost to shame, for his greatest\r\nfear was that his friends might ascertain the real cause of his\r\nsufferings, to conceal which he was obliged to resort to all sorts of\r\nsubterfuges. As soon as he was able to travel he left us, being obliged\r\nto report to his superior officers, and we have heard nothing of him\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nScores of similar cases we might recount in detail, but we have not\r\nhere the space. These will suffice to give to the young reader an idea\r\nof the terrible results of this awful vice which are suffered by its\r\nvictims. We have not dared to portray on these pages one-half the misery\r\nand wretchedness which we have seen as the results of self-abuse and\r\nthe vices to which it leads. The picture is too terrible for young eyes\r\nto behold. We most sincerely hope that none of our readers will ever\r\nhave to suffer as we have seen boys and young men do, languishing in\r\nmisery as the result of their own transgressions of the laws of chastity.\r\nWe will now devote the remaining pages of this chapter to the\r\nconsideration of some of the causes of the vice, the avenues that lead\r\nto the awful sin which we are considering, and the terrible consequences\r\nwhich attend it.\r\n\r\nBad Company.--The influence of evil companionship is one of the most\r\npowerful agents for evil against which those who love purity and are\r\nseeking to elevate and benefit their fellow-men have to contend. A bad\r\nboy can do more harm in a community than can be counteracted by all\r\nthe clergymen, Sabbath-school teachers, tract-distributers, and other\r\nChristian workers combined. An evil boy is a pest compared with which\r\nthe cholera, small-pox, and even the plague, are nothing. The damage\r\nwhich would be done by a terrific hurricane sweeping with destructive\r\nforce through a thickly settled district is insignificant compared with\r\nthe evil work which may be accomplished by one vicious lad.\r\n\r\nNo community is free from these vipers, these agents of the arch-fiend.\r\nEvery school, no matter how select it may be, contains a greater or\r\nless number of these young moral lepers. Often they pursue their work\r\nunsuspected by the good and pure, who do not dream of the vileness pent\r\nup in the young brains which have not yet learned the multiplication\r\ntable and scarcely learned to read. We have known instances in which\r\na boy of seven or eight years of age has implanted the venom of vice\r\nin the hearts and minds of half a score of pure-minded lads within a\r\nfew days of his first association with them. This vice spreads like\r\nwild-fire. It is more \"catching\" than the most contagious disease, and\r\nmore tenacious, when once implanted, than the leprosy.\r\n\r\nBoys are easily influenced either for right or for wrong, but especially\r\nfor the wrong; hence it is the duty of parents to select good companions\r\nfor their children, and it is the duty of children to avoid bad company\r\nas they would avoid carrion or the most loathsome object. A boy with\r\na match box in a powder magazine would be in no greater danger than\r\nin the company of most of the lads who attend our public schools and\r\nplay upon the streets. It is astonishing how early children, especially\r\nboys, will sometimes learn the hideous, shameless tricks of vice which\r\nyearly lead thousands down to everlasting death. Often children begin\r\ntheir course of sin while yet cradled in their mother's arms, thus early\r\ntaught by some vile nurse. Boys that fight and swear, that play upon\r\nthe streets and disobey their parents, may be wisely shunned as unfit\r\nfor associates. In many instances, too, boys whose conduct is in other\r\nrespects wholly faultless sometimes indulge in vice, ignorant of its\r\nreal nature and consequences. At the first intimation of evil on the\r\npart of a companion, a boy who is yet pure should flee away as from\r\na deadly serpent or a voracious beast. Do not let the desire to gratify\r\na craving curiosity deter you from fleeing at once from the source of\r\ncontamination. Under such circumstances do not hesitate a moment to\r\nescape from danger. If an evil word is spoken or an indecent act of\r\nany sort indulged in by a companion, cut the acquaintance of such a\r\nboy at once. Never allow yourself to be alone with him a moment. On\r\nno account be induced to associate with him. He will as surely soil\r\nand besmear with sin your moral garments as would contact with the most\r\nfilthy object imaginable your outer garments.\r\n\r\nIt were better for a boy never to see or associate with a lad of his\r\nown age than to run any risk of being corrupted before he is old enough\r\nto appreciate the terrible enormity of sin and the awful consequences\r\nof transgression. It should be recollected also that not only young\r\nboys but vicious youths and young men are frequently the instructors\r\nin vice. It is unsafe to trust any but those who are known to be pure.\r\n\r\nBad Language.--We have often been astonished at the facility with which\r\nchildren acquire the language of vice. Often we have been astounded\r\nto hear little boys scarcely out of their cradles, lisping the most\r\nhorrible oaths and the vilest epithets. The streets and alleys in our\r\nlarge cities, and in smaller ones too in a less degree, are nurseries\r\nof vice, in which are reared the criminals that fill our jails, prisons,\r\nwork-houses, school-ships, and houses of correction. Many a lad begins\r\nhis criminal education by learning the language of vice and sin. At\r\nfirst he simply imitates the evil utterances of others; but soon he\r\nlearns the full significance of the obscene and filthy language which\r\nhe hears and repeats, and then he rapidly progresses in the downward\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nA boy that indulges in the use of foul language will not long be chaste\r\nin acts. It is a safe rule to be followed by those who wish to grow\r\nup pure and unsullied by sin, untainted by vice, that those who use\r\nbad language are persons to avoid, to keep away from. Even those who\r\nare well fortified against vice, who have been faithfully warned of\r\nits consequences and fully appreciate its dangers, cannot be safely\r\ntrusted to associate with vile talkers. The use of bad language by old\r\nand young is an evil which is of the very greatest moment. It is too\r\noften ignored; too little is said about it; far too often it is\r\ndisregarded as of little consequence, and persons who are really not\r\nbad at heart thoughtlessly encourage the evil by listening to and\r\nlaughing at obscene and ribald jokes, and impure language which ought\r\nto make a virtuous man blush with shame to hear.\r\n\r\nBoys, if you want to be pure, if you wish to be loved by a pure mother,\r\nan innocent sister, and when you are grown to manhood to be worthy of\r\nthe confidence of a pure, virtuous wife, keep your lips pure; never\r\nlet a vile word or an indecent allusion pass them. Never, under any\r\ncircumstances, give utterance to language that you would blush to have\r\nyour mother overhear. If you find yourself in the company of persons\r\nwhose language will not bear this test, escape as soon as possible,\r\nfor you are in danger; your sense of what is right and proper in speech\r\nis being vitiated; you are being damaged in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nBad Books.--A bad book is as bad as an evil companion. In some respects\r\nit is even worse than a living teacher of vice, since it may cling to\r\nan individual at all times. It may follow him to the secrecy of his\r\nbed-chamber, and there poison his mind with the venom of evil. The\r\ninfluence of bad books in making bad boys and men is little appreciated.\r\nFew are aware how much evil seed is being sown among the young everywhere\r\nthrough the medium of vile books. It is not only the wretched volumes\r\nof obscenity of which so many thousands have been seized and destroyed\r\nby Mr. Comstock which are included under the head of bad books, and\r\nwhich corrupt the morals of the young and lead them to enter the road\r\nto infamy, but the evil literature which is sold in \"dime and nickel\r\nnovels,\" and which constitutes the principal part of the contents of\r\nsuch papers as the _Police Gazette_, the _Police News_, and a large\r\nproportion of the sensational story books which flood the land, and\r\ntoo many of which find their way into town and circulating libraries\r\nand even Sunday-school libraries, which are rarely selected with the\r\ncare that ought to be exercised in the selection of reading matter for\r\nthe young.\r\n\r\nBad books often find their way even where evil companions would not\r\nintrude; and undoubtedly effect a work of evil almost as great as is\r\nwrought by bad associations.\r\n\r\nLook out, boys, for the tempter in this guise. If a companion offers\r\nyou a book the character of which is suspicious, take it home to your\r\nfather, your mother, or some reliable older friend, for examination.\r\nIf it is handed you with an air of secrecy, or if a promise to keep\r\nit hidden from others is required, have nothing to do with it. You might\r\nbetter place a coal of fire or a live viper in your bosom than to allow\r\nyourself to read such a book. The thoughts that are implanted in the\r\nmind in youth will stick there through life, in spite of all efforts\r\nto dislodge them. Hundreds of men who have been thus injured when young,\r\nbut have by some providence escaped a life of vice and shame, look back\r\nwith most intense regret to the early days of childhood, and earnestly\r\nwish that the pictures then made in the mind by bad books might be\r\neffaced. Evil impressions thus formed often torture minds during a\r\nwhole lifetime. In the most inopportune moments they will intrude\r\nthemselves. When the individual desires to place his mind undividedly\r\nupon sacred and elevated themes, even at the most solemn moments of\r\nlife, these lewd pictures will sometimes intrude themselves in spite\r\nof his efforts to avoid them. It is an awful thing to allow the mind\r\nto be thus contaminated; and many a man would give the world, if he\r\npossessed it, to be free from the horrible incubus of a defiled\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nVile Pictures.--Obscene and lascivious pictures are influences which\r\nlead boys astray too important to be unnoticed. Evil men, agents of\r\nthe arch-fiend, have adopted all sorts of devices for putting into the\r\nhands of the boys and youths of the rising generation pictures\r\ncalculated to excite the passions, to lead to vice. Thousands of these\r\nvile pictures are in circulation throughout the country in spite of\r\nthe worthy efforts of such philanthropists as Mr. Anthony Comstock and\r\nhis co-laborers. In almost every large school there are boys who have\r\na supply of these infamous designs and act as agents in scattering the\r\nevil contagion among all who come under their influence.\r\n\r\nUnder the guise of art, the genius of some of our finest artists is\r\nturned to pandering to this base desire for sensuous gratification.\r\nThe pictures which hang in many of our art galleries that are visited\r\nby old and young of both sexes often number in the list views which\r\nto those whose thoughts are not well trained to rigid chastity can be\r\nonly means of evil. A plea may be made for these paintings in the name\r\nof art; but we see no necessity for the development of art in this\r\nparticular direction, when nature presents so many and such varied\r\nscenes of loveliness in landscapes, flowers, beautiful birds, and\r\ngraceful animals, to say nothing of the human form protected by\r\nsufficient covering to satisfy the demands of modesty.\r\n\r\nMany of the papers and magazines sold at our news-stands and eagerly\r\nsought after by young men and boys are better suited for the parlors\r\nof a house of ill-repute than for the eyes of pure-minded youth. A\r\nnews-dealer who will distribute such vile sheets ought to be dealt with\r\nas an educator in vice and crime, an agent of evil, and a recruiting\r\nofficer for hell and perdition.\r\n\r\nEvil Thoughts.--No one can succeed long in keeping himself from vicious\r\nacts whose thoughts dwell upon unchaste subjects. Only those who are\r\npure in heart will be pure and chaste in action. The mind must be\r\neducated to love and dwell upon pure subjects in early life, as by this\r\nmeans only can the foundation be laid for that purity of character which\r\nalone will insure purity of life. When the mind once becomes\r\ncontaminated with evil thoughts, it requires the work of years of\r\nearnest effort to purge it from uncleanness. Vile thoughts leave scars\r\nwhich even time will not always efface. They soil and deprave the soul,\r\nas vile acts do the body. God knows them, if no human being does, and\r\nif harbored and cherished they will tell against the character in the\r\nday of Judgment as surely as will evil words and deeds.\r\n\r\nInfluence of Other Bad Habits.--Evil practices of any sort which lower\r\nthe moral tone of an individual, which lessen his appreciation of and\r\nlove for right and purity and true nobility of soul, encourage the\r\ndevelopment of vice. A boy who loves purity, who has a keen sense of\r\nwhat is true and right, can never become a vicious man. Profanity,\r\nfalsehood, and deception of every sort, have a tendency in the direction\r\nof vice.\r\n\r\nThe use of highly seasoned food, of rich sauces, spices and condiments,\r\nsweetmeats, and in fact all kinds of stimulating foods, has an undoubted\r\ninfluence upon the sexual nature of boys, stimulating those organs into\r\ntoo early activity, and occasioning temptations to sin which otherwise\r\nwould not occur. The use of mustard, pepper, pepper-sauce, spices, rich\r\ngravies, and all similar kinds of food, should be carefully avoided\r\nby young persons. They are not wholesome for either old or young; but\r\nfor the young they are absolutely dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe use of beer, wine, hard cider, and tobacco, is especially damaging\r\nto boys on this account. These stimulants excite the passions and\r\nproduce a clamoring for sensual gratification which few boys or young\r\nmen have the will power or moral courage to resist. Tobacco is an\r\nespecially detrimental agent. The early age at which boys now begin\r\nthe use of tobacco may be one of the reasons why the practice of secret\r\nvice is becoming so terribly common among boys and young men. We never\r\nthink a boy or young man who uses tobacco safe from the commission of\r\nsome vile act.\r\n\r\nThe use of tea and coffee by boys is also a practice which should be\r\ninterdicted. All wise physicians forbid the use of these narcotic\r\ndrinks, together with that of tobacco, and always with benefit to those\r\nwho abstain. In France the government has made a law forbidding the\r\nuse of tobacco by students in the public schools. In Germany a still\r\nmore stringent law has been made, which forbids the use of tobacco by\r\nboys and young men. These laws have been made on account of the serious\r\ninjury which was evidently resulting from the use of the filthy weed\r\nto both the health and the morals of the young men of those countries.\r\nThere is certainly an equal need for such a law in this country.\r\n\r\nClosing Advice to Boys and Young Men.--One word more and we must close\r\nthis chapter, which we hope has been read with care by those for whom\r\nit is especially written. Let every boy who peruses these pages remember\r\nthat the facts here stated are true. Every word we have verified, and\r\nwe have not written one-half that might be said upon this subject. Let\r\nthe boy who is still pure, who has never defiled himself with vice,\r\nfirmly resolve that with the help of God he will maintain a pure and\r\nvirtuous character. It is much easier to preserve purity than to get\r\nfree from the taint of sin after having been once defiled. Let the boy\r\nwho has already fallen into evil ways, who has been taught the vile\r\npractice the consequences of which we have endeavored to describe, and\r\nwho is already in the downward road,--let him resolve now to break the\r\nchain of sin, to reform at once, and to renounce his evil practice\r\nforever. The least hesitancy, the slightest dalliance with the demon\r\nvice, and the poor victim will be lost. Now, this moment, is the time\r\nto reform. Seek purity of mind and heart. Banish evil thoughts and shun\r\nevil companions; then with earnest prayer to God wage a determined\r\nbattle for purity and chastity until the victory is wholly won.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest safeguards for a boy is implicit trust and\r\nconfidence in his parents. Let him go to them with all his queries\r\ninstead of to some older boyish friend. If all boys would do this, an\r\nimmense amount of evil would be prevented. When tempted to sin, boys,\r\nthink first of the vileness and wickedness of the act; think that God\r\nand pure angels behold every act, and even know every thought. Nothing\r\nis hid from their eyes. Think then of the awful results of this terrible\r\nsin, and fly from temptation as from a burning house. Send up a prayer\r\nto God to deliver you from temptation, and you will not fall. Every\r\nbattle manfully and successfully fought will add new strength to your\r\nresolution and force to your character. Gaining such victories from\r\nday to day you will grow up to be a pure, noble, useful man, the grandest\r\nwork of God, and will live a happy, virtuous life yourself, and add\r\nto the happiness of those around you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER FOR GIRLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have written this chapter especially for girls, and we sincerely\r\nhope that many will read it with an earnest desire to be benefited by\r\nso doing. The subject of which we have to write is a delicate one, and\r\none which, we regret exceedingly, needs to be written about. But our\r\nexperience as a physician has proven to us again and again that it is\r\nof the utmost importance that something be said, that words of warning\r\nshould be addressed particularly to the girls and maidens just emerging\r\ninto womanhood, on a subject which vitally concerns not only their own\r\nfuture health and happiness, but the prosperity and destiny of the race.\r\nProbably no one can be better fitted to speak on this subject than the\r\nphysician. A physician who has given careful attention to the health\r\nand the causes of ill-health of ladies, and who has had opportunities\r\nfor observing the baneful influence exerted upon the bodies and minds\r\nof girls and young women by the evil practices of which it is our purpose\r\nhere to speak, can better appreciate than can others the magnitude of\r\nthe evil, and is better prepared to speak upon the subject\r\nunderstandingly and authoritatively. Gladly would we shun the task\r\nwhich has been pressed upon us, but which we have long avoided, were\r\nit not for the sense of the urgent need of its performance of which\r\nour professional experience has thoroughly convinced us. We cannot keep\r\nour lips closed when our eyes are witnesses to the fact that thousands\r\nof the fairest and best of our girls and maidens are being beguiled\r\ninto everlasting ruin by a soul-destroying vice which works unseen,\r\nand often so insidiously that its results are unperceived until the\r\nwork of ruin is complete.\r\n\r\nThe nature of our subject necessitates that we should speak plainly,\r\nthough delicately, and we shall endeavor to make our language\r\ncomprehensible by any one old enough to be benefited by the perusal\r\nof this chapter. We desire that all who read these pages may receive\r\nlasting benefit by so doing. The subject is one upon which every girl\r\nought to be informed, and to which she should give serious attention,\r\nat least sufficiently long to become intelligent concerning the evils\r\nand dangers to which girls are exposed from this source.\r\n\r\nGirlhood.--Nothing is so suggestive of innocence and purity as the\r\nsimple beauty of girlhood when seen in its natural freshness, though\r\ntoo seldom, now-a-days, is it possible to find in our young girls the\r\nnatural grace and healthy beauty which were common among the little\r\nmaidens of a quarter of a century ago. The ruddy cheeks and bright eyes\r\nand red lips which are indicative of a high degree of healthy vigor\r\nare not so often seen to-day among the small girls in our public schools\r\nand passing to and fro upon the streets. The pale cheeks, languid eyes,\r\nand almost colorless lips which we more often see, indicate weakly\r\nconstitutions and delicate health, and prophesy a short and suffering\r\nlife to many. Various causes are at work to produce this unfortunate\r\ndecline; and while we hope that in the larger share of cases, bad diet,\r\nimproper clothing, confinement in poorly ventilated rooms with too\r\nlittle exercise, and similar causes, are the active agents, we are\r\nobliged to recognize the fact that there is in far too many cases another\r\ncause, the very mention of which makes us blush with shame that its\r\nexistence should be possible. But of this we shall speak again\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nReal girls are like the just opening buds of beautiful flowers. The\r\nbeauty and fragrance of the full-blossomed rose scarcely exceed the\r\ndelicate loveliness of the swelling bud which shows between the\r\nsections of its bursting calyx the crimson petals tightly folded\r\nbeneath. So the true girl possesses in her sphere as high a degree of\r\nattractive beauty as she can hope to attain in after-years, though of\r\na different character. But genuine girls are scarce. Really natural\r\nlittle girls are almost as scarce as real boys. Too many girls begin\r\nat a very early age to attempt to imitate the pride and vanity manifested\r\nby older girls and young ladies. It is by many supposed that to be\r\nladylike should be the height of the ambition of girls as soon as they\r\nare old enough to be taught respecting propriety of behavior, which\r\nis understood to mean that they must appear as unnatural as possible\r\nin attempting to act like grown-up ladies. Many mothers who wish their\r\ndaughters to be models of perfection, but whose ideas of perfect\r\ndeportment are exceedingly superficial in character, dress up their\r\nlittle daughters in fine clothing, beautiful to look at, but very far\r\nfrom what is required for health and comfort, and then continually\r\nadmonish the little ones that they must keep very quiet and \"act like\r\nlittle ladies.\" Such a course is a most pernicious one. It fosters pride\r\nand vanity, and inculcates an entirely wrong idea of what it is to be\r\nladylike,--to be a true lady, to be true to nature as a girl. Such\r\nartificial training is damaging alike to mind and body; and it induces\r\na condition of mind and of the physical system which is very conducive\r\nto the encouragement of dangerous tendencies.\r\n\r\nHow to Develop Beauty and Loveliness.--All little girls want to be\r\nbeautiful. Girls in general care much more for their appearance than\r\ndo boys. They have finer tastes, and greater love for whatever is lovely\r\nand beautiful. It is a natural desire, and should be encouraged. A pure,\r\ninnocent, beautiful little girl is the most lovely of all God's\r\ncreatures. All are not equally beautiful, however, and cannot be; but\r\nall may be beautiful to a degree that will render them attractive. Let\r\nall little girls who want to be pretty, handsome, or good-looking, give\r\nattention and we will tell them how. Those who are homely should listen\r\nespecially, for all may become good-looking, though all cannot become\r\nremarkably beautiful. First of all, it is necessary that the girl who\r\nwishes to be handsome, to be admired, should be good. She must learn\r\nto love what is right and true. She must be pure in mind and act. She\r\nmust be simple in her manners, modest in her deportment, and kind in\r\nher ways.\r\n\r\nSecond in importance, though scarcely so, is the necessity of health.\r\nNo girl can long be beautiful without health; and no girl who enjoys\r\nperfect health can be really ugly in appearance. A healthy countenance\r\nis always attractive. Disease wastes the rounded features, bleaches\r\nout the roses from the cheeks and the vermilion from the lips. It\r\ndestroys the luster of the eye and the elasticity of the step. Health\r\nis essential to beauty. In fact, if we consider goodness as a state\r\nof moral health, then health is the one great requisite of beauty.\r\n\r\nHealth is obtained and preserved by the observance of those natural\r\nlaws which the Creator has appointed for the government of our bodies.\r\nThe structure of these bodies we may do well to study for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThe Human Form Divine.--Go with us to one of the large cities, and we\r\nwill show you one of the most marvelous pieces of mechanism ever\r\ninvented, a triumph of ingenuity, skill, and patient, persevering labor\r\nfor many years. This wonderful device is a clock which will run more\r\nthan one hundred years. It is so constructed that it indicates not only\r\nthe time of day, the day of the month and year, itself making all the\r\nnecessary changes for leap year, but shows the motions of the earth\r\naround the sun, together with the movements and positions of all the\r\nother planets, and many other marvelous things. When it strikes at the\r\nend of each hour, groups of figures go through a variety of curious\r\nmovements most closely resembling the appearance and actions of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nThe maker of this remarkable clock well deserves the almost endless\r\npraise which he receives for his skill and patience; for his work is\r\ncertainly wonderful; but the great clock, with its curious and\r\ncomplicated mechanism, is a coarse and bungling affair when compared\r\nwith the human body. The clock doubtless contains thousands of delicate\r\nwheels and springs, and is constructed with all the skill imaginable;\r\nand yet the structure of the human body is infinitely more delicate.\r\nThe clock has no intelligence; but a human being can hear, see, feel,\r\ntaste, touch, and think. The clock does only what its maker designed\r\nto have it do, and can do nothing else. The human machine is a living\r\nmechanism; it can control its own movements, can do as it will, within\r\ncertain limits. What is very curious indeed, the human machine has the\r\npower to mend itself, so that when it needs repairs it is not necessary\r\nto send it to a shop for the purpose, but all that is required is to\r\ngive nature an opportunity and the system repairs itself.\r\n\r\nA Wonderful Process.--We have not space to describe all the wonderful\r\nmechanism of this human machine, but must notice particularly one of\r\nits most curious features, a provision by which other human beings,\r\nliving machines like itself, are produced. All living creatures possess\r\nthis power. A single potato placed in the ground becomes a dozen or\r\nmore, by a process of multiplying. A little seed planted in the earth\r\ngrows up to be a plant, produces flowers, and from the flowers come\r\nother seeds, not one, but often a great many, sometimes hundreds from\r\na single seed. Insects, fishes, birds, and all other animals, thus\r\nmultiply. So do human beings, and in a similar manner. The organs by\r\nwhich this most marvelous process is carried on in plants and animals,\r\nincluding also human beings, are called sexual organs. Flowers are the\r\nsexual organs of plants. And flowers are always the most fragrant and\r\nthe most beautiful when they are engaged in this wonderful and curious\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nHuman Buds.--A curious animal which lives near the seashore, in shallow\r\nwater, attached to a rock like a water plant, puts out little buds which\r\ngrow awhile and then drop off, and after a time become large individuals\r\nlike the parent, each in turn producing buds like the one from which\r\nit grew. Human beings are formed by a similar process. Human buds are\r\nformed by an organ for the purpose possessed only by the female sex,\r\nand these, under proper circumstances, develop into infant human beings.\r\nThe process, though so simply stated, is a marvelously complicated one,\r\nwhich cannot be fully explained here; indeed, it is one of the mysteries\r\nwhich it is beyond the power of human wisdom fully to explain.\r\n\r\nThe production of these human buds is one of the most important and\r\nsacred duties of woman. It is through this means that she becomes a\r\nmother, which is one of the grandest and noblest functions of womanhood.\r\nIt is the motherly instinct that causes little girls to show such a\r\nfondness for dolls, a perfectly natural feeling which may be encouraged\r\nto a moderate degree without injury.\r\n\r\nHow Beauty is Marred.--As already remarked, mental, moral, and physical\r\nhealth are the requisites for true beauty, and to secure these,\r\nobedience to all the laws of health is required. The most beautiful\r\nface is soon marred when disease begins its ravages in the body. The\r\nmost beautiful character is as speedily spoiled by the touch of moral\r\ndisease, or sin. The face is a mirror of the mind, the character; and\r\na mind full of evil, impure thoughts is certain to show itself in the\r\nface in spite of rosy cheeks and dimples, ruby lips and bewitching\r\nsmiles. The character is written on the face as plainly as the face\r\nmay be pictured by an artist on canvas.\r\n\r\nTo be more explicit, the girl who disregards the laws of health, who\r\neats bad food, eats at all hours or at unseasonable hours, sits up late\r\nat night, attends fashionable parties and indulges in the usual means\r\nof dissipation there afforded, dancing, wine, rich suppers, etc., who\r\ncarefully follows the fashions in her dress, lacing her waist to attain\r\nthe fashionable degree of slenderness, wearing thin, narrow-toed\r\ngaiters with French heels, and insufficiently clothing the limbs in\r\ncold weather, and who in like manner neglects to comply with the\r\nrequirements of health in other important particulars, may be certain\r\nthat sooner or later, certainly at no distant day, she will become as\r\nunattractive and homely as she can wish not to be. Girls and young ladies\r\nwho eat largely of fat meat, rich cakes and pies, confectionery, iced\r\ncreams, and other dietetic abominations, cannot avoid becoming sallow\r\nand hollow-eyed. The cheeks may be ever so plump and rosy, they will\r\ncertainly lose their freshness and become hollow and thin. Chalk and\r\nrouge will not hide the defect, for everybody will discover the fraud,\r\nand will of course know the reason why it is practiced.\r\n\r\nA Beauty-Destroying Vice.--But by far the worst enemy of beauty and\r\nhealth of body, mind, and soul, we have not yet mentioned. It is a sin\r\nconcerning which we would gladly keep silence; but we cannot see so\r\nmany of our most beautiful and promising girls and young ladies annually\r\nbeing ruined, often for this world and the next alike, without uttering\r\nthe word of warning needed.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, the function of maternity, which is the object of\r\nthe sexual system in woman, when rightly exercised is the most sacred\r\nand elevated office which a woman can perform for the world. The woman\r\nwho is a true mother has an opportunity of doing for the race more than\r\nall other human agencies combined. The mother's influence is the\r\ncontrolling influence in the world. The mother molds the character of\r\nher children. She can make of their plastic minds almost what she will\r\nif she is herself prepared for the work. On the other hand, misuse or\r\nabuse of the sexual organism is visited in girls and women, as in boys\r\nand men, with the most fearful penalties. Nothing will sooner deprive\r\na girl or young lady of the maidenly grace and freshness with which\r\nnature blesses woman in her early years than secret vice. We have the\r\ngreatest difficulty in making ourself believe that it is possible for\r\nbeings designed by nature to be pure and innocent, in all respects free\r\nfrom impurity of any sort, to become so depraved by sin as to be willing\r\nto devote themselves to so vile and filthy a practice. Yet the frequency\r\nwith which cases have come under our observation which clearly indicate\r\nthe alarming prevalence of the practice, even among girls and young\r\nwomen who would naturally be least suspected, compels us to recognize\r\nthe fact. The testimony of many eminent physicians whose opportunities\r\nfor observation have been very extensive shows that the evil is\r\nenormously greater than people generally are aware. Instructors of the\r\nyouth, of large experience, assert the same. Nor is the evil greater\r\nin America than in some other countries. One writer declares that the\r\nvice is almost universal among the girls of Russia, which may be due\r\nto the low condition in which the women of that country are kept.\r\n\r\nTerrible Effects of Secret Vice.--The awful effects of this sin against\r\nGod and nature, this soul-and-body-destroying vice, become speedily\r\nvisible in those who are guilty of it. The experienced eye needs no\r\nconfession on the part of the victim to read the whole story of sinful\r\nindulgence and consequent disease. The vice stamps its insignia upon\r\nthe countenance; it shows itself in the walk, in the changed disposition\r\nand the loss of healthy vigor. It is not only impossible for a victim\r\nof this sinful practice to hide from the all-seeing eye of God the\r\nvileness perpetrated in secret, but it is also useless to attempt to\r\nhide from human eyes the awful truth.\r\n\r\nHeadache, side-ache, back-ache, pains in the chest, and wandering pains\r\nin various parts of the body,--these are but a few of the painful\r\nailments from which girls who are guilty of this sin suffer. Many of\r\nthe tender spines which cause great solicitude on the part of parents\r\nand physicians, who fear that disease of the spine is threatening the\r\nlife of a loved daughter, not infrequently originate in this way. Much\r\nof the hysteria which renders wretched the lives of thousands of young\r\nladies and the fond friends who are obliged to care for and attend them,\r\narises from sexual transgression of the kind of which we are speaking.\r\nThe blanched cheeks, hollow, expressionless eyes, and rough, pimply\r\nskins of many school-girls are due to this cause alone. We do not mean\r\nby this to intimate that every girl who has pimples upon her face is\r\nguilty of secret vice; but this sin is undoubtedly a very frequent cause\r\nof the unpleasant eruption which so often appears upon the foreheads\r\nof both sexes. It would be very unjust, however, to charge a person\r\nwith the sin unless some further evidence than that of an eruption on\r\nthe face was afforded.\r\n\r\nThe inability to study, to apply themselves in any way except when\r\nstimulated by something of a very exciting character, which many girls\r\nexhibit, is in a large proportion of cases due to the practice of which\r\nwe are writing. Often enough the effects which are attributed to\r\noverstudy are properly due to this debasing habit. We have little faith\r\nin the great outcry made in certain quarters about the damaging effects\r\nof study upon the health of young ladies. A far less worthy cause is\r\nin many cases the true one, to which is attributable the decline in\r\nhealth at a critical period when all the vital forces of the system\r\nare necessarily called into action to introduce the activity of a new\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nHundreds of girls break down in health just as they are entering\r\nwomanhood. At from twelve to eighteen years of age the change naturally\r\noccurs which transforms the girl into a woman by the development of\r\nfunctions previously latent. This critical period is one through which\r\nevery girl in health ought to pass with scarcely any noticeable\r\ndisturbance; and if during the previous years of life the laws of health\r\nwere observed, there would seldom be any unusual degree of suffering\r\nat this time. Those who have before this period been addicted to the\r\nvile habit of which we are writing, will almost invariably show at this\r\ntime evidences of the injury which has been wrought. The unnatural\r\nexcitement of the organs before the period of puberty, lays the\r\nfoundation for life-long disease. When that critical epoch arrives,\r\nthe organs are found in a state of congestion often bordering on\r\ninflammation. The increased congestion which naturally occurs at this\r\ntime in many cases is sufficient to excite most serious disease. Here\r\nis the beginning of a great many of the special diseases which are the\r\nbane and shame of the sex. Displacements of various sorts, congestions,\r\nneuralgia of the ovaries, leucorrhoea, or whites, and a great variety\r\nof kindred maladies, are certain to make their appearance at this period\r\nor soon after in those who have previously been guilty of self-abuse.\r\nIf the evil influences already at work are augmented by tight lacing,\r\nimproper dressing of the extremities, hanging heavy skirts upon the\r\nhips, and fashionable dissipation generally, the worst results are sure\r\nto follow, and the individual is certain to be a subject for the doctors\r\nfor a good portion of her life.\r\n\r\nA talented writer some time since contributed to a popular magazine\r\nan article entitled, \"The Little Health of Women,\" which contained many\r\nexcellent hints respecting the influences at work to undermine the\r\nhealth and destroy the constitutions of American women; but he did not\r\neven hint at this potent cause, which, we firmly believe, is responsible\r\nfor a far greater share of the local disease and general poor health\r\nof girls, young women, and married ladies, than has been generally\r\nrecognized. These are startling facts, but we are prepared to\r\nsubstantiate them.\r\n\r\nRemote Effects.--Not all of the effects of the vice appear in girlhood,\r\nnor even during early life. Not infrequently it is not until the girl\r\nhas grown up to be a wife and mother that she begins to appreciate fully\r\nthe harm that has been wrought. At this time, when new demands are made\r\nupon the sexual organism, when its proper duties are to be performed,\r\nthere is a sudden failure; new weaknesses and diseases make their\r\nappearance, new pains and sufferings are felt, which no woman who has\r\nnot in some way seriously transgressed the laws of health will suffer.\r\nIn not a few instances it is discovered that the individual is wholly\r\nunfitted for the duties of maternity. Often, indeed, maternity is\r\nimpossible, the injury resulting from the sins committed being so great\r\nas to render the diseased organism incapable of the functions required.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of cases these peculiar difficulties, morbid\r\nconditions, and incapacities are attributed to overwork, overstudy,\r\n\"taking cold,\" \"getting the feet wet,\" or some other cause wholly\r\ninadequate to account for the diseased conditions present, although\r\nin many instances it may be true that some such unfortunate circumstance\r\nmay be the means of precipitating the effects of previous sin upon\r\norgans already relaxed, debilitated, and thus prepared readily to take\r\non disease.\r\n\r\nCauses which Lead Girls Astray.--The predisposing causes of sexual\r\nvices have already been dwelt upon so fully in this volume that we shall\r\ndevote little space to the subject here. We may, however, mention a\r\nfew of the causes which seem to be most active in leading to the\r\nformation of evil habits among girls.\r\n\r\nVicious Companions.--Girls are remarkably susceptible to influence by\r\nthose of their own age. A vicious girl who makes herself agreeable to\r\nthose with whom she associates can exert more influence over many of\r\nher companions than can any number of older persons. Even a mother\r\nrarely has that influence over her daughter that is maintained by the\r\ngirl whom she holds as her bosom friend. The close friendships which\r\nare often formed between girls of the same age are often highly\r\ndetrimental in character. Each makes a confidant of the other, and thus\r\nbecomes estranged from the only one competent to give counsel and advice,\r\nand the one who of all others is worthy of a young girl's\r\nconfidence,--her mother.\r\n\r\nFrom these unfortunate alliances often arise most deplorable evils.\r\nVicious companions not infrequently sow the seeds of evil habits far\r\nand wide, contaminating all who come within their influence.\r\n\r\nWhom to Avoid.--A girl will always do well to avoid a companion who\r\nis vain, idle, silly, or frivolous. Girls who have these evil\r\ncharacteristics are very likely to have others also which are worse.\r\nA girl who is rude in her manners, careless in her habits, irreverent\r\nand disobedient to parents and teachers, is always an unsafe companion.\r\nNo matter how pretty, witty, stylish, or aristocratic she may be, she\r\nshould be shunned. Her influence will be withering, debasing, wherever\r\nfelt. A girl may be gay and thoughtless without being vicious; but the\r\nchances are ten to one that she will become sinful unless she changes\r\nher ways.\r\n\r\nSentimental Books.--The majority of girls love to read, but,\r\nunfortunately, the kind of literature of which they are chiefly fond\r\nis not of a character which will elevate, refine, or in any way benefit\r\nthem. Story books, romances, love tales, and religious novels\r\nconstitute the chief part of the reading matter which American young\r\nladies greedily devour. We have known young ladies still in their teens\r\nwho had read whole libraries of the most exciting novels.\r\n\r\nThe taste for novel-reading is like that for liquor or opium. It is\r\nnever satiated. It grows with gratification. A confirmed novel-reader\r\nis almost as difficult to reform as a confirmed inebriate or opium-eater.\r\nThe influence upon the mind is most damaging and pernicious. It not\r\nonly destroys the love for solid, useful reading, but excites the\r\nemotions, and in many cases keeps the passions in a perfect fever of\r\nexcitement. The confessions of young women who were to all appearance\r\nthe most circumspect in every particular, and whom no one mistrusted\r\nto be capable of vile thoughts, have convinced us that this evil is\r\nmore prevalent than many, even of those who are quite well informed,\r\nwould be willing to admit.\r\n\r\nBy reading of this kind, many are led to resort to self-abuse for the\r\ngratification of passions which over-stimulation has made almost\r\nuncontrollable. Some have thus been induced to sin who had never been\r\ninjured by other influences, but discovered the fatal secret themselves.\r\nMothers cannot be too careful of the character of the books which their\r\ndaughters read. Every book, magazine, and paper should be carefully\r\nscrutinized, unless its character is already well known, before it is\r\nallowed to be read. In our opinion, some of the literature which passes\r\nas standard, which is often found on parlor center-tables and in family\r\nand school libraries, such as Chaucer's poems, and other writings of\r\na kindred character, is unfit for perusal by inexperienced and\r\nunsophisticated young ladies. Some of this literature is actually too\r\nvile for any one to read, and if written to-day by any poet of note\r\nwould cause his works to be committed to the stove and the rag-bag in\r\nspite of his reputation.\r\n\r\nVarious Causes.--Bad diet, the use of stimulating and exciting articles\r\nof food, late suppers, confectionery and dainties,--all these have a\r\nvery powerful influence in the wrong direction by exciting functions\r\nwhich ought to be kept as nearly latent as possible. The use of tea\r\nand coffee by young ladies cannot be too strongly condemned. Improper\r\ndress, by causing local congestion, often predisposes to secret vice\r\nby occasioning local excitement. Probably a greater cause than any of\r\nthose last mentioned is too great familiarity with the opposite sex.\r\nThe silly letters which girls sometimes allow themselves to receive\r\nfrom the boys and young men of their acquaintance, and which they\r\nencourage by letters of a similar character, must be condemned in the\r\nmost thorough manner. Upon receiving such a letter a pure-minded girl\r\nwill consider herself insulted; and has just reason for so doing. The\r\nchildish flirtations which girls and boys sometimes indulge in often\r\nlead to evils of a most revolting character.\r\n\r\nModesty Woman's Safeguard.--True modesty and maidenly reserve are the\r\nbest guardians of virtue. The girl who is truly modest, who encourages\r\nand allows no improper advances, need have no fear of annoyance from\r\nthis source. She is equally safe from temptation to sin which may come\r\nto her in secret, when no human eye can behold. Maidenly modesty is\r\none of the best qualities which any young lady can possess. A young\r\nwoman who lacks modesty, who manifests boldness of manner and\r\ncarelessness in deportment, is not only liable to have her virtue\r\nassailed by designing and unscrupulous men, but is herself likely to\r\nfall before the temptation to indulge in secret sin, which is certain\r\nto present itself in some way sooner or later.\r\n\r\nThis invaluable protection is speedily lost by the girl who abandons\r\nherself to secret vice. The chances are very great, also, that by\r\ndegrees her respect for and love of virtue and chastity will diminish\r\nuntil she is open to temptations to indulge in less secret sin; and\r\nthus she travels down the road of vice until she finds herself at last\r\nan inmate of a brothel or an outcast wanderer, rejected by friends,\r\nand lost to virtue, purity, and all that a true woman holds most dear.\r\n\r\nA Few Sad Cases.--Although we do not believe it right to harrow the\r\nfeelings of those who have sinned and suffered with a rehearsal of sad\r\ncases when no good can be accomplished by such accounts, we deem it\r\nbut just that those who are not yet entangled in the meshes of vice\r\nshould have an opportunity of knowing the actual results of sin, and\r\nprofiting by the sad experience of others. It is for this purpose that\r\nwe shall mention a few cases which have come under our observation,\r\ntaking care to avoid mentioning any facts which might lead to\r\nidentification, as the facts we shall use were, many of them, received\r\nin strict confidence from those who were glad to unburden their hearts\r\nto some one, but had never dared to do so, even to their friends.\r\n\r\nA Pitiful Case.--Several years ago we received a letter from a young\r\nwoman in an Eastern State in which she described her case as that of\r\nan individual who had early become addicted to secret vice and had\r\ncontinued the vile habit until that time, when she was about thirty-two\r\nyears of age. In spite of the most solemn vows to reform, she still\r\ncontinued the habit, and had become reduced to such a miserable\r\ncondition that she would almost rather die than live. She sent with\r\nher letter photographs representing herself at twenty and at that time,\r\nso that we might see the contrast. It was indeed appalling to see what\r\nchanges sin had wrought. Her face, once fair and comely, had become\r\nactually haggard with vice. Purity, innocence, grace, and modesty were\r\nno longer visible there. The hard lines of sin had obliterated every\r\ntrace of beauty, and produced a most repulsive countenance. Though\r\ngreatly depraved and shattered by sin and consequent disease in body\r\nand mind, she still had some desire to be cured, if possible, and made\r\na most pitiful appeal for help to escape from her loathsome condition.\r\nWe gave her the best counsel we could under the circumstances, and did\r\nall in our power to rescue her from her living death; but whether in\r\nany degree successful we cannot tell, as we have never heard from the\r\npoor creature since.\r\n\r\nWe have often wished since that we might but show those two pictures\r\nto every girl who has been tempted to sin in this way, to all who have\r\never yielded to this awful vice. The terrible contrast would certainly\r\nproduce an impression which no words can do. We sent them back to their\r\nwretched original, however, by her request, and so cannot show the\r\nactual pictures; but when any who read these lines are tempted thus\r\nto sin we beg them to think of these two pictures, and by forming a\r\nvivid image of them in the mind drive away the disposition to do wrong.\r\n\r\nA Mind Dethroned.--A young lady who had received every advantage which\r\ncould be given her by indulgent parents, and who naturally possessed\r\nmost excellent talents, being a fine musician, and naturally so bright\r\nand witty as to be the life of every company in which she moved, suddenly\r\nbegan to show strange symptoms of mental unsoundness. She would\r\nsometimes be seized with fits of violence during which it was with great\r\ndifficulty that she could be controlled. Several times she threatened\r\nthe lives of her nurses, and even on one occasion attempted to execute\r\nher threat, the person's life being saved by mere accident. Everything\r\nwas done for her that could be done, but the mania increased to such\r\na degree of violence that she was sent to an asylum for the insane.\r\nHere she remained for months before she became sufficiently tractable\r\nto be taken to her home and cared for by friends. Too close application\r\nto study was the cause at first assigned for her mental disorder, but\r\na careful investigation of the case revealed the fact that the terrible\r\nsin which has ruined the minds of so many promising young men and\r\nbrilliant young women was the cause that led to the sad result in this\r\ncase also. The punishment of sin, especially of sexual sins, is indeed\r\nterrible; but the sin is a fearful one, and the penalty must be equal\r\nto the enormity of the crime. Not all young women who indulge thus will\r\nbecome insane, but any one who thus transgresses may be thus punished.\r\nThere is no safety but in absolute purity.\r\n\r\nA Penitent Victim.--A young woman who had been ill for years, and whose\r\nphysicians had sought in vain to cure her various ailments, until her\r\nparents almost despaired of her ever being anything but a helpless\r\ninvalid, came to us for treatment, resolved upon making a last effort\r\nfor health. She had grown up in utter ignorance of the laws of health\r\nand of the results of the vice of which we are writing; and having been\r\nearly taught the sin, she had indulged it for a number of years with\r\nthe result of producing a most terribly diseased condition of the sexual\r\norgans, which had baffled the skill of all the physicians who had\r\nattended her, none of whom had ever been made acquainted with the true\r\ncause of the difficulties. When apprized of the real facts in the case,\r\nthat she was alone responsible for the sad condition into which she\r\nhad fallen, her eyes were opened to see the wickedness and vileness\r\nof her course. She bitterly bemoaned her past life, and heartily\r\nrepented of her sins. Of the sincerity of her repentance she gave\r\nevidence in the earnest efforts which she put forth to help herself.\r\nShe spared no pains to do well all required on her part, and was soon\r\nrewarded by feeling that her diseases were being removed and health\r\nwas returning. Still, she was constantly reminded of her former sins.\r\nWhen the will was off its guard, during sleep, the mind, long indulged\r\nin sin, would revert to the old channels and riot in vileness. Unchaste\r\ndreams made her often dread to sleep, as she awoke from these\r\nunconscious lapses enervated, weak, and prostrated as though she had\r\nactually transgressed. But though often thus almost disheartened she\r\ncontinued the struggle, and was finally rewarded by gaining a perfect\r\nvictory over her mind, sleeping as well as waking, and recovering her\r\nhealth sufficiently to enable her to enjoy life and make herself very\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nNot a few similar cases have come under our observation; and it seems\r\nto us that the pain, anguish, and remorse suffered by these poor victims,\r\nought to be a warning to those who have never entered the sinful road.\r\nWhat a terrible thing it is for a pure and lovely being, designed by\r\nGod to fulfill a high, holy, and sacred mission in the world, to become\r\na victim to such a filthy vice! No girl of sense would in her right\r\nmind raise her hand to dash in pieces a beautiful vase, to destroy a\r\nlovely painting, or a beautiful piece of statuary. A girl who would\r\ndo such a thing would be considered insane and a fit subject for a\r\nmad-house. Yet is not the human body, a girl's own beautiful,\r\nsymmetrical form, infinitely better, more valuable and more sacred,\r\nthan any object produced by human art? There can be but one answer.\r\nHow, then, is it possible for her thus to defile and destroy herself?\r\nIs it not a fearful thing? a terrible vice?\r\n\r\nA Ruined Girl.--One of the most remarkable cases of disease resulting\r\nfrom self-abuse which ever came under our observation was that of a\r\nyoung lady from a distant Western State whose adopted parents, after\r\nconsulting many different physicians for a peculiar disease of the\r\nbreast, placed her under our care. We found her a good-looking young\r\nwoman about seventeen years of age, rather pale and considerably\r\nemaciated, very nervous and hysterical, and suffering with severe pain\r\nin the left breast, which was swollen to nearly double the natural size,\r\nhot, tense, pulsating, and extremely tender to the touch. Occasionally\r\nshe would experience paroxysms in which she apparently suffered\r\nextremely, being sometimes semi-conscious, and scarcely breathing for\r\nhours. We suspected the cause of these peculiar manifestations at the\r\noutset, but every suggestion of the possibility of the suspected cause\r\nwas met with a stout denial and a very deceptive appearance of innocent\r\nignorance on the subject. All treatment was unavailing to check the\r\ndisease. Though sometimes the symptoms seemed to be controlled, a\r\nspeedy relapse occurred, so that no progress toward a cure was made.\r\nFinally our conviction that our first impression respecting the case\r\nwas correct became so strong that we hesitated no longer to treat it\r\nas such. By most vigilant observation we detected evidences of the\r\nsoul-corrupting vice which we considered unmistakable, and then the\r\nyoung woman who had pretended such profound ignorance of the matter\r\nconfessed to an extent of wickedness which was perfectly appalling.\r\nEvery paroxysm was traced to an unusual excess of sinful indulgence.\r\nSo hardened was she by her evil practices that she seemed to feel no\r\nremorse, and only promised to reform when threatened with exposure to\r\nher parents unless she immediately ceased the vile practice. In less\r\nthan ten days the mysterious symptoms which had puzzled many physicians\r\ndisappeared altogether. The swollen, tender breast was no larger than\r\nthe other, and was so entirely restored that she was able to strike\r\nit a full blow without pain.\r\n\r\nSo great was the depravity of this girl, however, that she had no notion\r\nof making a permanent reform. She even boasted of her wickedness to\r\na companion, and announced her intention to continue the practice. We\r\nsent her home, and apprized her parents of the full facts in the case,\r\nfor which we received their deepest gratitude, though their hearts were\r\nnearly broken with grief at the sad revelation made to them.\r\nNotwithstanding their most earnest efforts in her behalf, the wretched\r\ngirl continued her downward career, and a year or two after we learned\r\nthat she had sunk to the very lowest depths of shame.\r\n\r\nOnce this now wretched, disgraced creature was an attractive, pure,\r\ninnocent little girl. Her adopted father lavished upon her numerous\r\npresents, and spent hundreds of dollars to obtain her recovery to health.\r\nYet through this awful vice she was ruined utterly, and rendered so\r\nwholly perverse and bad that she had no desire to be better, no\r\ndisposition to reform. God only knows what will be her sad end. May\r\nnone who read these lines ever follow in her footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe Danger of Boarding-Schools.--Some years ago a young lady came under\r\nour medical care who had suffered for some time from a serious nervous\r\ndifficulty which had baffled the skill of all the physicians who had\r\nhad charge of her case, and which occasioned her a great amount of\r\nsuffering, making it necessary that she should be confined to her bed\r\nmost of the time, the disease being aggravated by exercise, and the\r\npatient having been much weakened by its long continuance.\r\n\r\nAll the remedies usually successful in such cases were employed with\r\nlittle or no effect, and we were feeling somewhat perplexed concerning\r\nthe case, when the young lady sent for us one day and upon our going\r\nto her room in answer to her call she immediately burst into tears and\r\nacknowledged that she had been addicted to the habit of self-abuse and\r\nthat she was still suffering from involuntary excitement during sleep.\r\nHaving been placed in a boarding-school when quite young, she had there\r\nlearned the vile habit, and had practiced it without knowing anything\r\nof the ill effects or really appreciating its sinfulness. When she\r\nlearned, some years after, that the habit was a most pernicious vice\r\nand of a character to bring destruction to both soul and body of one\r\naddicted to it, she endeavored to free herself from its shackles; but\r\nshe found herself too securely bound for escape. It seemed, indeed,\r\nan utter impossibility. Her thoughts had long been allowed to run in\r\nsentimental channels, and now they would do so in spite of the most\r\nearnest efforts to the contrary, during her waking hours; and in sleep,\r\nwhile the will power was not active, the imagination would run riot\r\nuncontrolled, leaving her, upon awaking, exhausted, enervated, and\r\nalmost desperate with chagrin. Knowing that she was daily suffering\r\nfor her transgressions, she was filled with remorse and regret, and\r\nwould have given all to undo the past; but, alas! she could not, and\r\ncould only suffer with patience until relief could be secured. Her love\r\nfor sentimental literature occasioned another battle for her to fight;\r\nfor she could scarcely resist the temptation daily offered her to while\r\naway some of the weary hours with such stories of love and sentiment\r\nas she had been accustomed to enjoy. But she fought the battle earnestly,\r\nand finally succeeded in conquering the evil tendencies of her mind\r\nboth while awake and when asleep; and from that time she began to make\r\nslow progress toward recovery. The last we saw of her she was doing\r\nwell, and hoped in time to arrive at a very comfortable state of health.\r\n\r\nA Desperate Case.--A little girl about ten years of age was brought\r\nto us by her father, who came with his daughter to have her broken of\r\nthe vile habit of self-abuse into which she had fallen, having been\r\ntaught it by a German servant girl. Having read an early copy of this\r\nwork, the father had speedily detected the habit, and had adopted every\r\nmeasure which he could devise to break his child of the destructive\r\nvice which she had acquired, but in vain. After applying various other\r\nmeasures without success, it finally became necessary to resort to a\r\nsurgical operation, by which it is hoped that she was permanently cured,\r\nas we have heard nothing to the contrary since, and as the remedy seemed\r\nto be effectual. It was a severe remedy, and may seem a harsh one, but\r\nevery other means utterly failed, and the father insisted upon the\r\nperformance of the operation as a trial. This little girl, naturally\r\ntruthful and honest, had, through the influence of this blighting vice,\r\nbeen made crafty and deceptive. She would tell the most astonishing\r\nfalsehoods to free herself from the charge of guilt or to avoid\r\npunishment. The gentleman, her father, felt so deeply upon the subject\r\nand was so thoroughly awake to the consequences of the sin, that he\r\ndeclared he would take his daughter away into the wilderness and leave\r\nher to die, if need be, rather than allow her to grow up to womanhood\r\nwith this vile blight upon her, and run the risk of her contaminating\r\nwith the same vice his other, younger children. He felt so deeply that\r\nthe tears coursed down his cheeks as he talked, and we were most happy\r\nto be of service to him in aiding his daughter to overcome the\r\nfascinating vice. She seemed willing to try to help herself, but was\r\nunable to break the bonds of sin without the extraordinary help which\r\nshe received.\r\n\r\nWe might continue this rehearsal of cases to an almost indefinite length,\r\nbut we must soon bring this chapter to a close. Those described are\r\nonly a few examples of the many we are constantly meeting. None have\r\nbeen overdrawn; much has been omitted for the sake of delicacy which\r\nthe exposure of the whole truth would have required us to present. We\r\nsincerely hope that these examples may be a warning to those who have\r\nnever marred their purity of character by an unchaste act. To those\r\nwho may have already sinned in this manner let the words come with double\r\nforce and meaning. Do you value life, health, beauty, honor, virtue,\r\npurity? Then for the sake of all these, abandon the evil practice at\r\nonce. Do not hesitate for a moment to decide, and do not turn back after\r\ndeciding to reform.\r\n\r\nA Last Word.--Girls, as one who has only your best interests in view,\r\nand who would do you good, we beg of you to give heed one moment to\r\nthe important matter which we have been presenting before you. It is\r\nof no frivolous character. It is one of the most important subjects\r\nto which your attention can be called. Only those who are utterly\r\nignorant of the dangers which surround them in the world, or who are\r\nalready hardened in sin, will treat this matter lightly or scornfully.\r\nIf you are still pure and possess a character unsoiled by sin, thank\r\nGod that you have been preserved until now, and humbly petition him\r\nto enable you to remain as pure and unsullied as you now are. Cultivate\r\nall of the heavenly graces. Make your dear mother your confidant in\r\nall your perplexities and trials. Go to her for information on all\r\nsubjects upon which you find yourself ignorant. Let no foreign\r\ninfluence beguile away your confidence from her who is most worthy of\r\nyour love and respect, and who is best prepared to instruct you on all\r\nsubjects, no matter how delicate. Trust in God for help to resist evil\r\nunder every guise. Flee from temptation under whatever form it may\r\nappear. Thus may you escape the suffering, the sorrow, and the remorse,\r\nwhich is endured sooner or later by all who enter the road of sin, no\r\nmatter how short a time they may travel therein.\r\n\r\nTo those who have already fallen, who have been led astray either\r\nignorantly or through weakness in yielding to temptation, we will say,\r\nTurn from your evil way at once. Misery, sorrow, anguish, and\r\neverlasting ruin stare you in the face. Perdition is before you. You\r\nneed not think to escape the punishment that others suffer, for there\r\nis no way of escape. The penalty will surely come. Make haste to return\r\nto the paths of purity before it is too late to mend the past. It may\r\ntake years of pure and upright living to repair the evil already done;\r\nbut do not hesitate to begin at once. With the help of God, resolve\r\nto become pure again. God can cleanse you from all unrighteousness.\r\nHe can enable you to chase from your mind and heart every impure thought\r\nand unclean desire. Through his grace you can successfully battle with\r\ntemptation and redeem the black record of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW WORDS TO BOYS AND GIRLS.\r\n\r\nOf the last two preceding chapters one was devoted exclusively to advice\r\nand instruction to boys, the other being written expressly for girls.\r\nNow we have a few words in conclusion for boys and girls together. It\r\nis of the greatest importance that our boys and girls should be in every\r\nway improved as much as possible. They are to become the men and women\r\nof the next generation, when their fathers and mothers have retired\r\nfrom active life. Twenty years from to-day the world will be just what\r\nthe present boys and girls shall make it. Boys who are chaste, honest,\r\nobedient, and industrious, will become useful and noble men, husbands,\r\nand fathers. Girls who are pure, innocent, and dutiful, will become\r\nhonored and lovely women, wives, and mothers.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls are placed in families together, and thus are evidently\r\ndesigned by nature to associate together, to obtain their education\r\nand preparation for life together. When secluded wholly from each\r\nother's society, both suffer a loss. But while this is true, it is also\r\ntrue that certain evils may and often do grow out of the association\r\nof the two sexes of young people, so serious in character that many\r\nwise and good men and women have felt that the sexes should be reared\r\nand educated apart as much as possible. These evils are the result of\r\ntoo intimate and improper associations of boys and girls. Associations\r\nof this sort must be most sedulously avoided. Boys and girls who are\r\nin school together must be extremely careful to avoid too close\r\nassociations. On all occasions a modest reserve should be maintained\r\nin the deportment of the young of both sexes toward each other. Too\r\nearly friendships formed often lead to hasty marriages, before either\r\nparty is prepared to enter into the married state, and before the\r\njudgment has been sufficiently developed to make either capable of\r\nselecting a suitable partner for life. These facts are usually learned\r\nwhen it is too late for the information to be of any value.\r\n\r\nParents and teachers are especially responsible for guarding these\r\nearly associations and giving timely warning when needed. The youth\r\nshould always be ready to take advice on this subject, for with their\r\ninexperience they cannot know their wants so well as do their elders.\r\nNothing is more disgusting to persons of sound sense than youthful\r\nflirtations. Those misguided persons who encourage these indiscretions\r\nin young people do an immense amount of injury to those whom they ought\r\nto be prepared to benefit by wise counsel. We have seen promising young\r\npeople made wretched for life through the influence of one of these\r\nmischief-makers, being most unhappily mated, and repenting too late\r\nof a hasty marriage for which they were utterly unprepared.\r\n\r\nYoung persons often labor under the erroneous impression that in order\r\nto be agreeable they must talk \"small talk;\" this literally means,\r\n\"silly twaddle,\" which disgusts everybody, and yet which all seek to\r\nimitate. Whenever the two sexes meet in society or elsewhere, as at\r\nall other times, the conversation should be turned upon subjects of\r\nreal interest, which admit of the exercise of sound sense and will be\r\na means of culture. Such associations do not result in injury to any\r\none, and may be the means of much profit; but nothing is more execrable\r\nthan the frivolous, silly, often absolutely senseless observations\r\nwhich make up the great bulk of the conversation of young people in\r\nfashionable society.\r\n\r\nThe most ready means of disclosing the superficial character of the\r\nminds of a large share of the young persons who move in fashionable\r\ncircles is to introduce some topic requiring depth of thought and sound\r\njudgment. Such a subject will usually produce either an instant lull\r\nin the conversation or a display of ignorance which cannot fail to\r\nreveal the shallowness of the speaker's intellect. It is this\r\nsuperficial class of minds that most easily fall victims to a sickly\r\nsentimentalism, which readily leads to digressions from the pathway\r\nof rigid virtue.\r\n\r\nA boy who has the elements of true manliness in him will carry a\r\ngentlemanly bearing wherever he goes. In all his deportment, and\r\nespecially in his conduct toward the opposite sex, he will act the\r\ngentleman; and the boy whose gentility is genuine will manifest the\r\nsame kind deference toward his mother and sisters as toward other ladies\r\nand girls. So also the young lady who is a lady at heart, will never\r\nallow herself to forget the rules of propriety, whether she is in the\r\ncompany of her father and brothers, or that of other gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAll the rules of etiquette are worth little compared with the one simple\r\nrule which is applicable to both sexes and all ages,--\"Have the heart\r\nright, and then act natural.\" One so governed will not go very far astray\r\nunder any circumstances; but it is of the greatest importance that the\r\nheart be right. To make it such is, indeed, the great business of life.\r\n\r\n\"BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PAGE.\r\n\r\nAbortion, 271\r\n\r\n    \"
