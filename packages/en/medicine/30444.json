It has been\r\ncarefully revised and enlarged with the addition of much new matter. The\r\nobject of the author in publishing the work in its present form is to\r\nprovide, in addition to a text-book for the architect, a treatise which\r\nshall enable the public to form their own judgment as to the relative\r\nmerits of the baths that compete for their patronage. The principles,\r\nherein enunciated, upon which good baths should be built, will be easily\r\ngrasped by the ordinary reader; and the detailed plans and instructions\r\nwill, it is hoped, supply such information as will enable the designer\r\nof baths to cope with the exigencies of any and every case with which he\r\nmay be confronted.\r\n\r\n  37, NORFOLK STREET,\r\n  STRAND, LONDON.\r\n  _March 1890._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n                                                           PAGE\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                1\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF A PUBLIC BATH                   9\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE GENERAL DISPOSITION OF PLAN OF PUBLIC BATHS            17\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  A DETAILED CONSIDERATION OF FEATURES PECULIAR TO THE BATH  32\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  HEATING AND VENTILATION                                    59\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  WATER-FITTINGS AND APPLIANCES                              87\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  LIGHTING, DECORATING, AND FURNISHING                      102\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  THE TURKISH BATH IN THE HOUSE                             118\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  THE BATH IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, ETC.         134\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  THE TURKISH BATH FOR HORSES                               141\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIG.

Certain it is that the latter cause has\r\ndone much--very much--injury.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that one of the chief obstacles to the progress of\r\nthe bath in this country, is that little or nothing has been written or\r\nsaid about its proper design, construction, and working, and that no\r\nfull inquiry has been made into the best possible method of supplying\r\nheat to the bathers. As a consequence, we have had, and still have,\r\nplaced before the public, and meeting with undeserved success, \"Turkish\r\nbaths\" which are such only in name--unhealthy, ill-ventilated cellars,\r\nwhere the air, deteriorated at the outset by the heating apparatus,\r\nstagnates in the sudatory chambers, and becomes loaded with the\r\nexhalations and emanations of the bathers, and not unfrequently charged\r\nwith a nauseating and disgusting odour. What wonder that we so often\r\nhear persons remark that they have tried the bath, but neither enjoyed\r\nit nor did it agree with them! The damaging effect of \"baths\" of this\r\ntype on the prospects of the true bath is incalculable.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of enlightenment, however, thousands, convinced of the\r\nvalue and benefit of the bathing, periodically attend these miserable\r\nsubstitutes for properly-planned, hygienically-heated, and\r\neffectively-ventilated Turkish baths. Viewing any self-evident\r\nshortcomings as irremediable evils, ignorant of the true principles of\r\nbath construction, and knowing little or nothing of the physiological\r\naction of the bath, they have neither the means of ascertaining, nor the\r\npower to detect, the genuine article from the harmful substitute. With\r\nthe public the best bath will be the most elaborate and most flashily\r\ndecorated, and the moth-and-candle principle comes into play with\r\nstriking semblance to the original type.\r\n\r\nSo much has been written and said about the arrangement, design, and\r\nworking of the baths of the ancient Romans, and of the Oriental nations\r\nof to-day, that it will be superfluous and unnecessary here to enter\r\nupon the subject, fascinating though it be to any one interested in the\r\nbuilding of modern baths. An intelligent study of old plans, and of the\r\nwritings of those who have given their attention to the elucidation of\r\nthe special purposes to which the various apartments of the Roman\r\n_Thermæ_ were devoted, serves in no small degree to a complete\r\nunderstanding of the problems involved in the perfecting of the bath in\r\nmodern times. So also with regard to the Hammam of the East, an\r\nacquaintance with its plan and working is equally instructive. But to\r\nfully elucidate the history of thermo-therapeutic architecture would\r\nrequire a volume of itself, since the many questions that present\r\nthemselves to the student of ancient baths cannot be properly understood\r\nwithout considerable and lengthy description. Those desirous of studying\r\nthe subject of the design of ancient and Oriental baths will find many\r\nworks within easy reach. In his 'Manual of the Turkish Bath,' the late\r\nDavid Urquhart has given a most complete account of Eastern baths; and\r\nin Sir Erasmus Wilson's 'Eastern or Turkish Bath,' will be found a\r\npopular account of the sumptuous baths of antiquity, which will serve as\r\nan introduction to further researches with the aid of more abstruse\r\nworks, such as Wollaston's 'Thermæ Romano-Britannicæ,' Cameron's 'Baths\r\nof the Romans,' and particularly the careful description of the Pompeian\r\n_Balneæ_ in Sir William Gell's 'Pompeiana.' In the admirable works of\r\nSamuel Lysons, the Gloucestershire antiquary, will be found interesting\r\naccounts of the remains of old Roman baths in this country; and in\r\nDaremberg and Saglio's 'Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et\r\nRomaines,' is a most capable essay on ancient _Balneæ_. In Eastern\r\ntravellers' books, desultory descriptions of the Oriental bath will be\r\nfound; and in Owen Jones's work on the Palace of the Alhambra, at\r\nGranada, plans and sections are given of the elegant little bath that\r\nthe Moorish builders erected therein.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this work, and for the sake of brevity and\r\nconvenience, I have thought fit to adopt the following terms from the\r\nold Roman vocabulary, to designate the apartments of the modern bath. I\r\nrespectively term the first, second, and third hot rooms, the\r\n_Tepidarium_, _Calidarium_, and _Laconicum_. Although the exact nature\r\nof the ancient Roman _laconicum_ is still a question in debate, I have\r\nchosen to employ the term to designate herein the hottest of the hot.\r\nThe washing room I call the _Lavatorium_; the cooling room, the\r\n_Frigidarium_; and the separate dressing room, the _Apodyterium_.\r\n\r\nThe modern \"Turkish bath\" is rather a revival of the Roman bath, than\r\nthat of the East. Among the Orientals, the air of the sudorific chambers\r\nis charged more or less heavily with vapour. In the ancient Roman bath,\r\nthe atmosphere must have been more or less dry. And it has been decided\r\nby physiologists and physicians of the hydropathic school, that the air\r\nof the bath cannot be too free of all moisture. With a perfectly dry\r\natmosphere a high degree of heat can be borne, and the dryness moreover\r\nis conducive to perspiration. This absolute need for a dry atmosphere\r\nin the bath will be found fully explained in an admirable work by Dr.\r\nW.B. Hunter, M.D., entitled 'The Turkish Bath: its Uses and Abuses.' But\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that the type of bath employed at the present\r\nday resembles, in point of dryness of atmosphere, that of ancient Rome,\r\nthe name of Turkish bath, originally given to it by Mr. Urquhart, has\r\nheld good, and must now be accepted as the correct modern designation.\r\n\r\nNeither the term \"Turkish,\" however, nor the designation \"hot-air\" bath,\r\nconvey to the uninitiated any idea of the true principle of \"the bath,\"\r\nas I shall hereinafter call it for brevity's sake. More properly it is a\r\n\"_heat_ bath\"--a _thermal cure_. In the ordinary hot-air bath, the\r\nheated air is simply a medium; and, as I have endeavoured to explain in\r\nthe body of this little work, the heat is best supplied to the body of\r\nthe bather by direct radiation. By the \"Turkish bath,\" therefore, I\r\nwould be understood to mean a method of supplying pure heat--not\r\nnecessarily hot air--to the surface of the human body for hygienic,\r\nremedial, and curative purposes.[1]\r\n\r\nIn the following pages, however, I have, in this respect, treated of the\r\nsubject from the broadest point of view, and have explained the method\r\nof designing the _hot-air bath_ pure and simple, looking upon the\r\nconvected and radiating heat principles as both good of their kind, and\r\nperfectly admissible modes of applying heat to the human frame. I have\r\nadhered to this plan throughout, because, even supposing that it were\r\nshown conclusively to-morrow, that the principle of heating by\r\nconvection is absolutely wrong, baths of this type would, owing to the\r\nslow march of improvement in this country, still be built and require to\r\nbe planned. Moreover, it has been in the past, and still is, the\r\ngenerally accepted idea that the Turkish bath is a hot-air bath pure and\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nMedical men of eminence who have studied the question have thought fit\r\nto retain the term \"hot air\" in descriptions of the Turkish bath. In\r\ndeference to their opinion I may hereinafter, in places, speak of the\r\n_hot-air bath_. The arguments put forward in favour of radiant heat,\r\nwith a comparatively cool atmosphere, in the sudorific chambers, are,\r\nfor the most part, the result of my own experience and study.\r\n\r\nI treat of my subject in two sections, dealing with public and private\r\nbaths respectively. Chapters II. to VII. are devoted to the elucidation\r\nof the principles to be observed in the building of public baths, either\r\nfor true public purposes or as commercial speculations. It is\r\nunnecessary to speak of these two classes of baths under separate heads:\r\nwhat is required of the one is required of the other. The only\r\ndifference is that one is the property of the people, and may be\r\nrequired to be designed in a block of buildings containing other kinds\r\nof baths; and the other is owned by a company of persons or by a single\r\nindividual as the case may be, and is generally an establishment\r\ncomplete in itself.\r\n\r\nIt is not to the credit of the English nation that so little has been\r\ndone in connection with Turkish bath building for the people. The\r\nattention given to the question of supplying bath-houses of any kind is\r\nof the most meagre character. The provisions of the Public Baths and\r\nWash-houses Act are entirely inadequate. In these matters the German\r\nnation is far ahead of us. Fortunately for the general health, the\r\nEnglishman is renowned for his morning \"tub.\" But the cold tub is merely\r\na tonic bath, and the Turkish bath cleanses both the inward and outward\r\nman, besides constituting a most perfect tonic. The cleanliness of the\r\nvast body of the English depends on the warm shallow bath, an\r\nineffective means at the best, and, often, when taken at a high\r\ntemperature, fraught with a real danger to certain constitutions. Used,\r\nas customary, without a tonic application of cold water, it is eminently\r\nconducive to cold-catching. But one cannot blame the average Englishman\r\nfor his neglect of the health-giving habit of scientific bathing, unless\r\nhe sees the advantage of, and has means to afford, a Turkish bath in his\r\nown house. He looks in vain for an appropriate, comfortable, and\r\nattractive bath-house provided for him by the Legislature, and he\r\ndislikes the thought of the impure atmosphere and odours of the\r\nso-called \"Turkish baths\" provided by enterprising business men. He can\r\ndo nothing but fall back on his warm water bath and cold morning tub.\r\n\r\nIn the second section, comprised in Chapters VIII. to X., I have dealt\r\nwith private baths, including the bath in the house and mansion, in\r\ninstitutions of one kind and another, and in connection with training\r\nstables. In the chapter on the bath in the private house, will be found\r\nplans of baths of several types, from the smallest and least expensive\r\nto the most elaborate and costly.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that this little work may lead to some attention being\r\nbestowed on the question of providing public Turkish baths worthy of the\r\ncountry; that it may add a stimulus to the building of high-class baths\r\nas commercial speculations; and that, from its pages, those desirous of\r\nexperiencing the luxury of a model Turkish bath in their own homes, may\r\nlearn the best methods of its design and construction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Germans, with more perception and accuracy than\r\nourselves, term the therapeutic agent that we called the Turkish bath,\r\nthe \"Roman-Irish bath\"--the _Römisch-irische Bäder_. Both the ancient\r\nRoman bath and the old Irish \"sweating-house,\" gave out radiant heat\r\nfrom the walls to the bather, and did not depend on the supplying of hot\r\nair.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF A PUBLIC BATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid unnecessary expense in working and management, a\r\npublic Turkish bath should be convenient and _compact_ in plan. It\r\nshould be as perfect as possible in regard to heating and ventilation,\r\nin order to insure patronage; and, for the same reason, it should be\r\nmade a thing of beauty. A badly-ventilated, inconvenient, and\r\nill-adorned bath does harm, both to the bather and the cause. It is its\r\nown enemy, and harmful also to all other baths; whereas every\r\nably-designed bath has in itself the elements of success, and assists\r\nexisting institutions by increasing the number of converts to the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nA good bath does not necessarily mean an elaborate and expensive one,\r\nbut primarily one where the heating and ventilation are on the latest\r\nand most approved principles, and where the shampooing and washing rooms\r\nare kept sweet and clean, the bathing appliances effective, and the\r\ncooling rooms ample, and supplied with an abundance of fresh air. This\r\nis not the result of sumptuousness and elaboration, but of pure applied\r\nscience. Amplitude of space, however, facilitates its attainment, as it\r\nis difficult to render a cramped bath beneficial and attractive.\r\n\r\nBy an attractive bath, I would be understood to mean one in which the\r\nvisitor will feel interest in the design; where pleasant objects are\r\npresented to his eye, both in the sudorific chambers and in the cooling\r\nrooms. Artistic decorations have here a commercial value. The bath\r\nrequiring time, the bather is compelled to pass some hours in the\r\nvarious apartments, and it is therefore highly desirable that his\r\nsurroundings be rendered pleasant and entertaining. In a Turkish bath,\r\nas in other architectural matters, this is not the result of a prodigal\r\nexpenditure on costly decorations and fittings, but rather of a careful\r\narrangement of necessary and desirable features, and a knowledge of the\r\nmethods of obtaining piquancy of effect by their distribution on the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the modern bath is modified from that of the Ancients\r\nand Orientals to suit the accepted form of practice in this country, so\r\nthat the order of the different processes through which the bather\r\npasses governs the disposition of the various apartments. The chief\r\nobject to be attained is to induce a more or less vigorous perspiration\r\nby the application of heat. This heat is now generally applied through\r\nthe medium of the air, which is raised to a high temperature by being\r\npassed over and in contact with the heated surfaces of stoves of various\r\ndesigns, or by direct radiation from hot metal or firebrick.\r\nTheoretically, the generally-adopted method of applying the heat to the\r\nbather might be greatly improved, but practically it has been found the\r\nbest. Into these questions, however, I shall enter when treating of the\r\nheating and ventilating of the bath. For the present, it will suffice to\r\nsay that the chief object to be attained in the bath is the supplying of\r\nan abundance of _pure hot air_ to the various sudorific chambers, and\r\nthe rapid withdrawal of the foul air and exhalations.\r\n\r\nSince the disposition of the various apartments is governed by the\r\nmethods of bathing in vogue, it will be necessary to first give the\r\nreader a brief account of the various processes undergone by the bather.\r\nThe object of the profuse perspiration to be attained is twofold--(1) To\r\ncleanse the blood of impurities; and (2) to loosen the dead scales of\r\nthe epidermis, or scarf-skin, that spreads itself everywhere over the\r\ntrue skin or cuticle. Besides this, however, physiologists tell us that\r\nthe heat itself has a beneficial effect on the body in other ways, and\r\nis, in cases of disease, a most powerful curative and remedial agent.\r\nThis latter fact explains the necessity for the high temperatures\r\nemployed, as mere perspiration could be attained with a comparatively\r\nlow degree of heat.\r\n\r\nThe course of treatment to be undergone by the bather, as given by Sir\r\nErasmus Wilson, is--(1) Exposure of the naked body to hot dry air. (2)\r\nAblution with warm and cold water. (3) Cooling and drying the skin. In\r\naddition to these, however, there should be added the process of\r\n\"massage\" or shampooing before washing.\r\n\r\nThe perspiration is attained in the various hot rooms--the _Tepidarium_,\r\n_Calidarium_, and _Laconicum_. The nature of these apartments--which I\r\nshall hereinafter consider in detail--must be determined by the\r\npretensions of the establishment.\r\n\r\nPerspiration having been induced, the bather submits to the kneading of\r\nthe muscles of the trunk and limbs by the shampooer. For this operation,\r\nwhich restores tone and vigour to the muscular and nervous system, a\r\nseparate and distinct apartment should, in high class baths, be\r\nprovided. Vigorous friction with a coarse glove succeeds the shampooing.\r\nThis detaches the dead portions of the epidermis, and is an operation\r\ngenerally practised in the _Lavatorium_--a washing room adjoining the\r\nshampooing room. In the same place the bather receives copious ablutions\r\nwith warm water. The less robust conclude the cleansing process with a\r\ndouche, needle, spray, or shower bath, graduated from warm to cold; and\r\nthe strong bather, by plunging into a bath of cold water, the object of\r\nwhich is to contract and close the sweat-glands and pores of the skin\r\nthat have been swelled and opened by the high temperatures of the\r\ncalorific apartments. For these purposes a small room, with the various\r\nappliances named, and a large chamber containing a more or less ample\r\nplunge bath, must be provided. In small baths, provision for both these\r\noperations is made in one general shampooing and washing room, where the\r\nbather is \"massed,\" rubbed down, washed, and takes the plunge or shower\r\nbath. The plunge may, if thought advantageous, be placed partly in the\r\ncool apartment and partly in the hot rooms, in which case, the bather\r\ndives under a glazed partition of some sort, which, furnished with an\r\nindia-rubber flap dangling in the water, prevents the hot air of the\r\nsudatorium from entering the cooling rooms.\r\n\r\nThe above description gives an outline of the cleansing and hygienic\r\nprocesses, and of the nature of the requirements of those portions of\r\nthe bath devoted to their attainment. I have named them first as being\r\nthe most indispensable portion of the necessary suite of rooms, since\r\nthe bath may exist if it be merely in the form of an old Irish\r\n\"sweating-house,\" or a somewhat similar construction of the North\r\nAmerican Indian; but without the heated chamber and its appurtenances\r\nthere can be no bath.\r\n\r\nThe next important features to be considered are the dressing and\r\ncooling rooms. Before entering the bath rooms proper, the bather must\r\ndivest himself of his clothing, and assume the bathing garment. The\r\ndressing room or _Apodyterium_, and the cooling room or _Frigidarium_,\r\nare generally made one and the same; but they may, with advantage, be\r\ndesigned as separate and distinct apartments, the provision for dressing\r\nand undressing consisting of a room or rooms with small dressing-boxes\r\naround it. The frigidarium will then be a simple apartment designed for\r\nthe economical reception of the reposing couches, it being absolutely\r\nessential that the bather rest awhile, after the bath, to allow the body\r\nto gradually assume its normal temperature. Neglect of this precaution\r\nmay cause a renewal of perspiration, and possibly a \"cold.\"\r\n\r\nIf a combined apodyterium and frigidarium be adopted, it must be fitted\r\nwith a number of divans to accommodate a given number of persons, or be\r\ndivided into smaller spaces with dwarf screens, each space receiving a\r\npair of couches. The divisions may be effected by more or less elaborate\r\nand ornamental wooden partitions. In ladies' baths more privacy must be\r\nobserved. Each lady bather should have a private dressing and reposing\r\nroom, even if only formed by dwarf wooden partitions.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement may be designed whereby the bather enters first a room\r\nfitted with a number of dressing-boxes, and then passes through the\r\nfrigidarium on his way to the hot rooms, whence he returns after his\r\nbath. Where the establishment is on a large scale, the arrangement may\r\nlead the bather first to a room fitted with dressing-boxes, then to the\r\nhot rooms, and finally, by way of the plunge bath, into a commodious and\r\nseparate cooling room.\r\n\r\nSubsidiary to the cooling and dressing rooms should be others for the\r\nattendants, manager, and also for the hairdresser and chiropodist, or,\r\nat any rate, some sort of provision made for them. A pay office, with\r\ncounter and a set of lockers for the receipt of the bather's watch,\r\nmoney, and other valuables, should be the first object that one meets on\r\nentering from the vestibule connecting the establishment with the\r\nstreet. In connection with this office may be the manager's room, and\r\nprovision for the supply of refreshments. If the bath be the property of\r\na company, a board room may be required. As on entering a bath the\r\nvisitor must immediately divest himself of his boots and shoes, in order\r\nthat he may not pollute apartments that are devoted to the attainment of\r\nthat cleanliness which is next to godliness, a raised step must be\r\nprovided at the entrance to the apodyterium to warn him to enter unshod,\r\nor a portion of the combined cooling and dressing room may be divided\r\noff by similar means. Provision for the boots and shoes must be in the\r\nform of a set of pigeon-holes near the entrance, where, also, racks for\r\ncoats and hats must be placed.\r\n\r\nThe hair-dressing room and accommodation for the chiropodist--if he does\r\nnot practise his art at the couch of the bather--must adjoin the\r\nfrigidarium, as also should the attendants' room. A lavatory must be\r\nplaced in the frigidarium when used as the dressing room. Closet\r\naccommodation should be accessible from the same apartment, but should\r\nbe perfectly cut off from it by means of a passage or lobby. The\r\ngreatest care should be taken to prevent these conveniences from\r\nbecoming offensive. Returning from the bath, the sense of smell is\r\npeculiarly sensitive, and the slightest odour is detected. The worst\r\nposition for the closets is near the door by which the bather leaves the\r\nlavatorium. Defects in this point may ruin an otherwise excellent bath.\r\nIf the cooling rooms and hot rooms be on separate floors, the closets\r\nmay be designed off a landing on the staircase. In the separate\r\naccommodation for attendants and shampooers the same caution must be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAdjoining, under, or partly under, the laconicum must be placed the\r\nheating apparatus in its chamber, with stokery and provision for fuel,\r\n&c. The stokery should be large, light, and properly ventilated, and the\r\nattendants should be able easily to communicate with the stoker. Of the\r\narrangements for heating and supplying the water to the lavatorium I\r\nshall speak in another chapter. Laundry, linen and towel rooms, and a\r\ndrying room must be provided. They are important necessities, and should\r\nnot be cramped in dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL DISPOSITION OF PLAN OF PUBLIC BATHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the process of the bath determines the position of the various\r\napartments in relation to one another, the exact disposition of the plan\r\nmust be governed by the shape of the ground to be covered, the nature of\r\nthe site and surroundings, and--if the bath be constructed in an\r\nexisting building--the amount of space allotted to it. The _relative_\r\nposition of chamber to chamber of the sudatorium, and of the latter to\r\nthe cooling rooms, must remain more or less constant; but the angle of\r\nconnection with each other, their shape, proportions, and floor levels,\r\nmust, together with the positions of the subsidiary apartments, be\r\ndetermined by the exigencies of the site, and considerations of\r\nconvenience and economy. Frequently, the architect will be called upon\r\nto design a bath in a given space in the lower floors of some existing\r\nbuilding. He may be given the ground or basement floor to make the most\r\nof as best he can. His plan is thus considerably hampered. If the site\r\nincludes the basement and ground floor of an ordinary house, he may\r\narrange the offices and cooling and dressing rooms on the ground floor;\r\nand the hot rooms, shampooing room, and bath rooms, in the basement.\r\nWhere possible, the hot rooms should be pushed out beyond the back wall\r\nof the houses, and lighted from the top. In cities, the hot rooms will\r\noften have to be in the actual basement. Where space is valuable a whole\r\nhouse may be given up to baths if the floors be made fire and heat\r\nproof. The basement may be devoted to hot rooms and shampooing rooms,\r\nthe ground floor to offices and dressing rooms, and the first floor to\r\ncooling rooms. Ladies' baths, again, can be arranged on the floors\r\nabove, and both baths can be heated from one apparatus. In a bath where\r\nthree floors are available, the first floor may be devoted to extra\r\ncooling and dressing rooms. In inexpensive sites the bath may be all on\r\none level. This is the most convenient arrangement, but in large cities\r\nis generally too costly. The Hammam and Savoy baths, in London, are,\r\nhowever, all on one level, the former being practically all above\r\nground, and the latter constructed in the basement of an existing\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe London Hammam was the first public Turkish bath erected in this\r\ncountry, and owes its existence to the fervid zeal of the late David\r\nUrquhart. It was erected in 1862, from the designs of the late Somers\r\nClarke. The bath rooms proper are modelled on the Eastern plan, and have\r\nquite an Oriental effect, with the stars of stained glass sparkling in\r\nthe sombre domed tepidarium. In this bath the office is arranged in the\r\nold building in Jermyn Street, adjoining which is the combined\r\nfrigidarium and apodyterium, a structure of wood, originally intended as\r\na temporary building only. This is covered with an open-timbered roof,\r\nand divided into nave and aisles by cut-wood posts, and lighted by a\r\nclerestory. These posts form the divisions of the divans, which are\r\nseparated from one another by ornamented wood partitions worked in an\r\nEastern manner. Connected by double doors with this apartment are the\r\nhot rooms. The main room--a very moderately-heated tepidarium--is a\r\nsquare on plan, with splayed angles, over which rises a dome of\r\nbrickwork. On either side of this square, and connected with it by the\r\nhorseshoe arches supporting the dome, are transept-like apartments, used\r\nas portions of the tepidarium, similar adjuncts existing at the ends and\r\njoining on the one hand the frigidarium, and on the other a heated\r\nsmoking saloon, which occupies a position corresponding to that of a\r\nLady-chapel in this very ecclesiastical-looking plan. On either side of\r\nthis saloon are two calidaria. A drying room and laundry are arranged\r\nover the smoking saloon, and w.c.'s, &c., are placed at the end of the\r\nlatter apartment. In the splayed angles supporting the dome are doors\r\nleading to four apartments--two used as hot rooms of different\r\ntemperatures, and the others as a washing-room and a shampooer's\r\nwaiting room. Under the dome there is an extensive platform of marble\r\nslabs, beneath which is the douche room, reached by a short flight of\r\nsteps. The plunge bath is placed, partly in the tepidarium, and partly\r\nin the frigidarium, with an arrangement to prevent the transmission of\r\nthe hot air, such as I have herein before explained. In the centre of\r\nthe frigidarium is a little marble fountain. One of the divans is\r\npartitioned off for the accommodation of the chiropodist. A gallery is\r\nprovided for the hairdresser, and connected with a shop in Jermyn\r\nStreet. The ground sloping considerably, a descent of a few steps has to\r\nbe made to reach the frigidarium from the street. A refreshment bar is\r\nplaced in the frigidarium. The manager's room is on the second floor,\r\nadjoining the old building, and has a window overlooking the\r\nfrigidarium.\r\n\r\nThe Hammam was the first public Turkish bath erected in this country,\r\nand the Savoy (Fig. 1) is one of the latest and largest, and also on one\r\nlevel. It was designed by Mr. C. J. Phipps, F.S.A., to suit the basement\r\nof an existing building. Entering from Savoy Hill, a short passage\r\nconducts to a staircase leading to the vestibule, where are provided\r\nrails for hats and coats. The counter of the ticket-office is placed at\r\nthe entrance to the frigidarium, and near this office is the committee\r\nroom--the bath being the property of a private company. In vaults\r\nprojecting under the street, provision is made for an engine and dynamo.\r\nThe frigidarium serves also as the apodyterium, and is cut up into\r\ndivans by ornamental wood partitions. Connected with it is a saloon for\r\nthe hairdresser and chiropodist, and an attendants' room. A lavatory is\r\nprovided in a recess. Access is gained to the hot rooms through double\r\ndoors. The plunge bath is placed partly in the hot rooms and partly in\r\nthe frigidarium. The tepidarium is divided by arcades into miniature\r\nnave and aisles. Two subdivisions at the end of the tepidarium lead to\r\nthe calidarium, adjoining which is the heating apparatus, fitted with\r\ntwo of Messrs. Constantine's \"Convoluted\" stoves. Access to the stokery\r\nis gained by a passage at the end of the tepidarium. The shampooing\r\nroom is placed off the cooler end of the tepidarium, dwarf walls\r\nseparating it from the latter apartment, as also from the lavatorium.\r\nHere, there are six marble basins, corresponding with the six marble\r\nslabs in the shampooing room. A small chamber is screened off the\r\nlavatorium to accommodate the douche and spray. A passage leads from the\r\ndouche room to the attendants' room, by way of the laundry. Off this\r\npassage, and approached by doors from two of the divans, are the w.c.'s,\r\n&c., for the bathers' use. Provision for the supply of refreshments is\r\nmade at the back of the office. This bath is designed in an Eastern\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\n--PLAN-OF THE-SAVOY-TURKISH-BATHS--\r\n\r\nTurkish Baths, Savoy Hill, London.]\r\n\r\nIn the generality of modern baths, the frigidarium forms also the\r\napodyterium. This arrangement is economical of space, and has been\r\nfound, in practice, the most convenient for bathers; but there is much\r\nto be said in favour of a separate and distinct cooling room, such as\r\nthat at the Camden Town Turkish Baths. Erected from the designs of Mr.\r\nH. H. Bridgman, F.R.I.B.A., these baths are specially noteworthy for\r\ntheir spacious frigidarium and ample plunge bath. Entering from the\r\nstreet, a corridor conducts to a short flight of stairs leading to the\r\noffice. Adjoining this is an apodyterium, fitted with two ranges of\r\ndressing-boxes, one above the other, a gallery forming the floor of the\r\nupper tier. From hence a short staircase leads to the door of the\r\ntepidarium, at right angles to which is the calidarium. Adjoining the\r\ntepidarium is a combined shampooing and washing room, a door in which\r\nopens into a chamber containing a plunge bath of quite exceptional\r\ndimensions. A staircase leads to the door of the lofty and spacious\r\ncooling room. This is lighted from the top, and contains a fireplace, a\r\nfeature usually omitted in cooling rooms, and really superfluous, though\r\nadding greatly to cheerfulness of aspect in the winter. From this\r\nfrigidarium the bather can return to his dressing-box by way of a lobby.\r\nThus he makes a complete round, and does not meet the incoming bathers\r\non the staircase to the tepidarium.\r\n\r\nThe latest built elaborate commercial baths in London are those of\r\nMessrs. Nevill in Northumberland Avenue (Fig. 2). They were designed by\r\nMr. Robert Walker, F.R.I.B.A., and comprise both ladies' and gentlemen's\r\nbaths, though, as at the old Pompeian _Balneæ_, the former set are\r\nungallantly cramped into a very small space. They occupy a corner site,\r\nand the entrance to the gentlemen's bath is formed at the rounded angle.\r\nIn the vestibule is the usual cashier's office, and provision for hats\r\nand coats. From the vestibule the combined cooling and dressing room is\r\nentered, after passing the boot room on the left and the refreshment bar\r\non the right. Between the boot room and the staircase is the\r\nhairdresser's room. Dwarf wooden partitions divide the cooling room. Off\r\na landing on the staircase are a lavatory and w.c.'s and toilet-table.\r\nThe staircase leads to the first floor--where are provided extra\r\ncouches--and to the bath rooms in the basement. The first floor is\r\npractically a gallery. In the basement are three hot rooms, the\r\ntepidarium being an elegant apartment elaborately adorned with marbles\r\nand rich faïence. A heated smoking room adjoins the second hot room.\r\nThere are in this bath three shampooing rooms--an arrangement conducing\r\ngreatly to privacy. A douche room and plunge bath are provided in the\r\nangle of the building. Vaults under the street are utilised as a\r\nlaundry, attendants' room, meter room, and engineer's shop, and as\r\nstore-rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.\r\n\r\nTurkish Baths, Northumberland Avenue, Charing Cross.]\r\n\r\nThe ladies' baths partly adjoin the gentlemen's, and are partly\r\nseparated by an area. They are entered from the side street. On the\r\nground floor is the pay-office and cooling room. Additional couches are\r\nprovided on the first floor, where is also an attendants' room. In the\r\nbasement are three hot rooms and two shampooing rooms. A washing room,\r\nshower bath, and plunge bath adjoin the shampooing rooms. The hottest\r\nrooms of both sets of these baths are within a few feet of each other.\r\nEach, however, has its separate and distinct furnace. A passage formed\r\nby the area allows access to the stokery and furnace chambers.\r\n\r\nIn Messrs. Nevill's baths at London Bridge the cooling rooms, &c., are\r\nin the basement, and the bath rooms proper in a sub-basement.\r\n\r\nBartholomew's baths at Leicester Square are an excellent example of a\r\ncompactly-arranged double set of baths. The various apartments are\r\ndesigned one above the other on different floors, the area of the\r\nbuilding being limited. On the ground floor, as usual, are the pay\r\noffice and a combined cooling and dressing room, and an attendant's\r\nroom. In the basement are the bath rooms, arranged _en suite_--first a\r\nshampooing and washing room, containing, also, in a very compact manner,\r\nthe plunge and shower baths; next is the tepidarium; then the smaller\r\nsecond hot room; and, lastly, the smallest hot room of a very high\r\ntemperature. The heating chamber is placed adjoining this. The principle\r\nof its construction is that generally adopted in the baths erected under\r\nthe late Mr. Bartholomew's direction, viz. a furnace with a coil of thin\r\niron flue-pipes, radiating, in a measure, a certain amount of heat\r\ndirectly into the hot rooms. The bath rooms are divided from one another\r\nby glazed wood partitions, as distinct from the solid walls dividing\r\nbaths like the Hammam and Savoy. A consideration of these two methods of\r\ndividing the hot rooms, does not, however, concern us here. A staircase\r\nfrom the entrance vestibule leads to the ladies' baths on the second and\r\nthird floors, where also are manager's and other private rooms.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, baths may be divided into two classes, viz. those in\r\nwhich the various apartments are arranged _en suite_, and those\r\nirregularly planned. Where possible the former arrangement is\r\npreferable, as, with the hot rooms in a line, the circulation of air is\r\nfacilitated. Fig. 11 is a section of a set of hot rooms arranged _en\r\nsuite_; and the baths at Figs. 24 and 25, in Chapter VIII., are planned\r\non this principle.\r\n\r\nAs I have said above, where a basement and ground floor are available,\r\nand a little space can be gained at the back of the existing building,\r\nthe office, cooling and dressing rooms can be arranged on the ground\r\nfloor, and the bath rooms proper on the basement level, but with light\r\nand air above. If the site be an ordinary narrow-fronted town house,\r\nand the bath an unassuming one, the plan may be arranged after the\r\nmanner of Mr. Joseph Burton's baths (Fig. 3), in the Euston Road,\r\nLondon. Here a pair of ordinary town dwelling-houses are pressed into\r\nthe service of the bath. The basement and ground floors are devoted to\r\nthe baths, the upper floors forming a private hotel. On one side are the\r\ngentlemen's, and on the other, the ladies' baths. Entering the former,\r\nwe find a space on the ground floor, fronting the street, serving as an\r\noffice. Adjoining this is a range of dressing-boxes, and further on a\r\ncooling room, excellently lighted by a large window forming the whole\r\nend of the apartment. From this little frigidarium a marble staircase\r\nleads to the door of the tepidarium, formed at basement level at the\r\nback of the houses. This chamber is lighted by means of a ceiling-light\r\nconstructed in the form of a small, flat dome, with stained-glass stars\r\nset therein. A marble seat runs round the whole of this chamber. On one\r\nside of the staircase is placed the calidarium, and, on the other, the\r\ncombined shampooing room and lavatorium, a door from the latter forming\r\nan exit for the visitor who has completed his bath. At one end of the\r\nshampooing room is a chamber containing the cold plunge bath and needle\r\nbath. A door from hence leads to a staircase conducting to the\r\nfurnace-chamber. A laundry is provided at the head of these stairs. The\r\nfurnace-chamber is placed under the further end of the calidarium. The\r\nbaths for ladies are arranged on a very similar plan. The gentlemen's\r\nbaths are among the earliest erected in this country, and still form a\r\nmost compact and convenient institution. They were designed by Mr.\r\nJames Schofield. The illustration shows the ladies' baths. The ceilings\r\nof the hot rooms are not indicated on the section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.\r\n\r\nTurkish Baths, Euston Road, London.]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the baths mentioned in this chapter are the property of\r\nprivate individuals or companies. The number of baths provided in this\r\ncountry under Act of Parliament or by civic corporations is so small,\r\nand their size and design so insignificant, that it would be waste of\r\nspace to describe them here. They are unworthy of the nation. One of the\r\nbest is the pretty little bath provided on the first floor of the public\r\nbath-house recently erected by the Corporation of Stockport. The fine\r\nnew baths at Bath erected from designs by Major Davis, the city\r\narchitect, do not include a Turkish bath. It must be admitted that some\r\nslight increase in the amount of attention paid by corporate bodies to\r\nbath-building is latterly to be noticed, and a few years may possibly\r\nsee a great advance in this direction. That this may indeed be so should\r\nbe our sincere hope, since the lack of fine public baths is a standing\r\ndisgrace to a nation that prides itself upon its cleanliness.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, considerable attention has been bestowed upon the design of\r\nthe Turkish bath, many excellent baths having been built in the more\r\ncomplete bath-houses of the Empire. Well-arranged Turkish baths are to\r\nbe found in the baths at Nuremberg, Hanover, and Bremen, the latter\r\nplanned with both a first and second class frigidarium to the one set of\r\nbath rooms. The plan, however, has nothing to recommend it, and in this\r\ncountry would be useless. The Nuremberg bath is handsomely planned, and\r\nhas a spacious frigidarium. It is placed in a building comprising\r\nladies' and gentlemen's swimming baths, shallow baths, and a Russian\r\nbath. In many of the hydropathic establishments (_Kurbäder_) of Germany,\r\nwill be found excellent Turkish baths. A sumptuous double set of bath\r\nrooms is provided in the _Friedrichsbad_ in Baden-Baden, which was\r\nerected at a cost of about 100,000_l._ The Turkish baths are placed on\r\nthe ground floor, and in other floors are provided baths of every kind.\r\nEach set of rooms for the ladies' and gentlemen's Turkish baths\r\ncomprises undressing room and cooling room, two sudorific chambers,\r\nshampooing room, douche room with cold plunge bath, and a separate\r\nchamber with warm plunge. Adjoining the shampooing room are the warm and\r\nhot rooms of the Russian bath. Between the two sets of bath rooms is\r\nplaced a handsome circular swimming-bath, and adjoining, the\r\n_Wildbad_--a deep, full bath of warm mineral water.\r\n\r\nOne of the most elaborate Turkish baths erected, in modern times, is\r\nthat on the Praterstern, at Vienna, which cost, in round numbers,\r\n125,000_l._ The building comprises ladies' and gentlemen's Turkish and\r\nRussian baths, and includes a residential block for those taking a\r\ncourse of baths. The whole of the arrangements are on a most sumptuous\r\nscale. The cooling room of the gentlemen's baths measures no less than\r\n35.3 metres long, and 10.5 broad. There are both warm and cold plunge\r\nbaths, besides a fine circular _piscina_, in a circular domed chamber.\r\nSimilar provisions are made for the ladies on a smaller scale. Though\r\nplain and somewhat heavy in external design, the building internally is\r\nresplendent with tiles, marble, and ornamental woodwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA DETAILED CONSIDERATION OF FEATURES PECULIAR TO THE BATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say anything more as to the subsidiary\r\napartments of a Turkish bath. Such adjuncts as the entrance hall and\r\nvestibule, the pay office, refreshment department, laundry and\r\ndrying-rooms, hairdressing and attendants' rooms, and other minor\r\nprovisions, are obviously simple matters, requiring little or no\r\ndetailed explanation. Sufficient has already been said about them to\r\nenable the architect, assisted by the drawings given, to design them\r\nwith convenience and economy. The features peculiar to the bath are\r\nthose requiring careful consideration. It is upon the design of the hot\r\nrooms, the cooling rooms, and the washing rooms that the success or\r\nnon-success of a new bathing establishment depends, and too much study\r\ncannot be given to these apartments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUDORIFIC CHAMBERS.\r\n\r\nThese are now generally required in a suite of three--\"first, second,\r\nand third hot.\" The first is the tepidarium, and must be by far the\r\nlargest of the three, since in it the greater number of bathers will\r\nassemble at one time. The last must be the hottest room--the\r\nlaconicum--and need only be a very small one, as but few bathers use\r\nit, and that, generally, for a very short time. The second hot room\r\nshould be about midway, in size and temperature, between the first and\r\nthe third. Of a given area allotted to the hot rooms, from one-half to\r\ntwo-thirds may be devoted to the tepidarium, and from one-third to\r\none-half to the super-heated rooms, always remembering that it is well\r\nto err on the side of providing a large and roomy tepidarium. Of the\r\nspace allowed for the smaller rooms, one-quarter to one-third may be\r\ngiven to the hottest, and the remaining space to the second hot-room,\r\nor calidarium.\r\n\r\nThe hot rooms, it should be remembered, are strictly bath rooms, and\r\nmust be treated as such; that is to say, the whole of the floors, walls,\r\nceilings, partitions, and fittings, must be capable of being frequently\r\ncleansed with water. The choice of materials to be employed for lining\r\nthe walls, &c., is therefore limited. And in two ways. For not only must\r\nthey be of this washable nature, but they must be of a character to\r\nresist the influence of the heat. Happily, this is an age of\r\nglazed-ware and vitrified goods of every description. Glazed and\r\nfire-burnt bricks and tiles, terracottas, faïence, and pottery\r\ngenerally, are now so extensively manufactured that there is little\r\nexcuse for not constructing a bath throughout of materials at once\r\nwashable and unaffected by high temperatures. Still, in baths where\r\nrigid economy must be studied, and lowness of cost is the great object,\r\n_plaster_ may be placed upon the walls of the hot rooms, and in its way\r\nwill answer admirably, and be fairly washable. It has even one\r\nadvantage--it does not become unbearably hot to the touch, should the\r\nbather lean against the walls, whereas, with a highly glazed surface the\r\nwalls become burning hot, and need lining with a dado of felt or other\r\nnon-conducting substance. And since this latter method overcomes the\r\nobjection named, the best possible material for lining the walls is\r\nglazed brickwork. In cases where elaboration is desired, they may be\r\nlined with marbles and faïence. With a judicious selection of colours,\r\nhowever, a very pleasing appearance can be given by the employment of\r\nsimple glazed brickwork, and at a very moderate cost.\r\n\r\nThe flooring in cheap baths is admirably formed by simple unglazed tile\r\npavement over concrete. A slight roughness is very agreeable to the\r\nfeet. Glazed tiles are inadmissible, as they become too hot for the\r\nnaked feet; and if the slightest moisture come upon them they are\r\nrendered dangerously slippery. In elaborate baths, marble, and marble\r\nmosaics may be used, but the surface must not be too smooth. In\r\nproviding floorings, the greatest care should be taken to avoid anything\r\nliable to become slippery to the tread.\r\n\r\nFloors of ordinary-sized baths, where the soil is reliable, may be of 6\r\nin. of concrete, with mosaics or tiles laid in cement. The benches for\r\nreclining and shampooing must be built up from this with half-brick\r\nrisers and glazed fronts, having weathered marble slabs with rounded\r\nnosings, as illustrated at Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nThe ceilings of the fire and heat-proof floors, which, when there are\r\nother apartments above, _must_ be provided over the hot rooms, may be of\r\nplaster. But the heat at the ceiling level is very great, and the\r\nplaster here rapidly darkens and blackens, and in this state looks\r\nanything but attractive in a place where the mere suspicion of\r\nuncleanliness is nauseating. If employed (and this remark also applies\r\nto plaster on walls), it should be used in the simplest manner possible,\r\nwithout the slightest attempt at modelling the surface. Enamelled iron\r\nmay be used, with effect, for ceilings. The little laconicum is best\r\ncovered with a flat vault, the soffit being of glazed bricks, and the\r\nspringing being brought down below the main ceiling level.\r\n\r\nFire-proof floors over hot rooms may be of any design that is also\r\nheat-proof. The main point is to have a sufficient thickness of\r\nconcrete, and the iron joists and cross girders well buried therein.\r\nOrdinary floors may be rendered heat-proof by partially filling the\r\nspace between ceiling and floorboards with sawdust or sheets of\r\nslag-wool laid on boarding nailed to fillets on the joists. The sawdust\r\nshould be filled up to the top of the joists; over this a layer of thick\r\nfelt, and the boarding above. This, however, is only a makeshift when\r\ncompared with a solid floor of concrete.\r\n\r\nWhen the hot rooms are in a basement in the open, they may be\r\ntop-lighted, and the ceiling above need not be a heavy fire-proof\r\nconstruction. A sufficient air space, however, must be provided between\r\nthe ceiling and roof, to prevent irradiation of heat--a remark that\r\napplies also to anything in the shape of a window in the sudatorium. It\r\nmust be double, or look into an area covered with pavement lights. In\r\nthe case of a top-lighted room there must be a ceiling-light and a\r\nskylight.\r\n\r\nWhere the hot rooms are constructed quite above ground, consideration\r\nmust be given to the prevention of loss of heat by radiation. This may\r\nbe effected by providing thick hollow walls, the cavity being often\r\nusefully employed for the extraction of the vitiated air.\r\n\r\nHeat permeating other apartments and neighbouring premises is a frequent\r\nsource of trouble to the builder of a Turkish bath, but is always the\r\nresult of want of study of the subject on the part of the designer. The\r\nevil may be successfully combated if it be resolved that no hot room,\r\nshampooing room, or lavatorium shall be constructed without a thick\r\nconcrete floor above, and that the furnace chamber be perfectly and\r\ncompletely insulated. Should the walls of the hot rooms adjoin\r\napartments to which it is urgently necessary that the heat should be\r\nprevented from being transmitted, they may be rendered heat-proof by\r\nbuilding them hollow and filling the cavity with soot.\r\n\r\nDouble doors and lobbies must be employed to prevent the transmission of\r\nthe heated air to rooms where its presence would be injurious. To keep\r\nthe hot air of the bath-rooms from the cooling-rooms, &c., should be the\r\ngreat aim of the architect. Many baths are rendered quite repulsive by\r\nwhat I may perhaps term the \"sudorific smell\" that assails the nostrils\r\nof the visitor entering the vestibule.\r\n\r\nThe space allotted to the sudatory chambers may be divided into the\r\nvarious rooms, either by glazed brick walls or by framed and glazed\r\npartitions; or again, they may be formed by a combination of solid\r\nbrickwork and glazed woodwork. Any piers in these rooms must be of\r\nbrickwork, iron columns being inadmissible. Masonry, too, must be\r\ndiscarded throughout, or used with caution. Some stones--such as red\r\nMansfield--become black with exposure to the heat, and others fare still\r\nworse. The employment of porous and absorbent materials must be guarded\r\nagainst throughout this portion of the bath, as it should be remembered\r\nthat effete matters, particles of waste tissue, and possibly the germs\r\nof disease, are continually being given off by the perspiring bathers,\r\nand must be prevented from finding a lodgment.\r\n\r\nThe best woods for use in the hot rooms are close-grained and free from\r\nessential oils. Mahogany is excellently adapted for the purpose, and so,\r\nalso, is teak. Pitch pine must be discarded altogether. Deal, when\r\nemployed, should be perfectly seasoned, and may then give trouble from\r\nthe exudation of turpentine.\r\n\r\nThe partitions, and the doorways in them, must be so placed as to govern\r\nthe flow of hot air. So long as the main divisions be planned with this\r\nend in view, the separate rooms may be divided and broken up as the\r\narchitect may fancy. But the constant flow of the heated air from the\r\ninlet in the hottest room towards the lavatorium must not be interfered\r\nwith by recesses, nooks, and corners, or anything that would cause the\r\ncurrent to stagnate. And here we may see the practical advantage\r\npossessed by a bath where the hot rooms are _en suite_, and in a line\r\nwith one axis. For here the air sweeps uninterruptedly through the\r\ndifferent chambers without eddying around corners and stagnating in\r\nrecesses far out of the main stream.\r\n\r\nThe doorways in the partitions should not be too lofty. They should not\r\nbe hung with doors, as anything necessary in this way will be amply\r\nsupplied by depending curtains.\r\n\r\n_Glazing_ in the hot rooms requires care. The glass will expand\r\nconsiderably with the heat, and, what is more, if the furnace fire die\r\nout rapidly at any time, will contract and fracture. This difficulty,\r\nhowever, is the result of bad management, and does not concern the\r\narchitect, unless, indeed, it be the result of improper fixing. Even\r\nmoderate-sized sheets of glass should be carefully fixed in chamois\r\nleather with screwed beading, _putty_ being wholly inadmissible. The\r\nsheets of glass should not be of too large dimensions. Rolled glass will\r\nbe found the cheapest in the end, as inferior qualities, where\r\nhomogeneity of texture is wanting, will crack and split in all\r\ndirections. Lead glazing should be altogether discarded.\r\n\r\nNo provision for draining the hot rooms is necessary, as they must, when\r\nin use, be kept free from moisture. The floor may, however, if thought\r\ndesirable, be laid with an imperceptible fall the way the water would be\r\nswept when cleansing--viz. towards the lavatorium.\r\n\r\nAs the best position for a bather to assume in the sudatorium is one\r\napproaching to the horizontal, a bath cannot be considered complete\r\nunless a liberal number of marble-slabbed benches be provided. These\r\nshould run round the solid walls, the risers of the benches being formed\r\nof brickwork--glazed, faced with tiles, or plastered--and white marble\r\nslabs set thereon. These slabs cannot be less than 24 in. wide, and must\r\nbe of the ordinary seat height--not lower. In the risers must be\r\nprovided a liberal number of \"hit-and-miss\" ventilator gratings, the\r\nvitiated air finding its way from the space beneath the slabs in the way\r\ndesigned, which may be into surrounding areas, into hollow walls, or\r\ninto a flue or flues running the whole height of the building.\r\n\r\nThe air at the floor line and that at the ceiling level being of vastly\r\ndifferent temperatures, it follows that an arrangement might be designed\r\nwhereby the benches might be stepped in three or four rows, and, by\r\nascending, the bather could select any temperature he might choose. Such\r\nan arrangement was often employed in the baths of the ancient Romans,\r\nand has been tried in modern institutions; but it should be avoided. The\r\nexpirations from the lungs and the exudations from the bodies of the\r\nbathers _fall_, and it therefore follows that all below the first tier\r\nwould be breathing air polluted by those above them. The system,\r\ntherefore, stands condemned.\r\n\r\nAs regards height, the sudorific chambers should not be too lofty, or\r\nthey cannot, on the ordinary hot-air plan, be heated with due economy.\r\nThe vastness of the old Roman tepidarium would have been impracticable\r\nunder this system; but with the heat radiating direct from the walls and\r\nthe floors, there was no difficulty. It is far better to have a\r\ncomparatively low chamber with a constant stream of freshly-heated air\r\npassing through it, than a lofty one with a sluggish current. From 10 to\r\n15 or 16 ft. may be taken as moderate extremes of height in a public\r\nbath. The small third hot room will be less lofty if the heating-chamber\r\nbe placed under it; for by raising the floor of the laconicum a few\r\nfeet, so as to necessitate ascending to it by a few steps from the level\r\nof the tepidarium, one can more economically construct the furnace\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThis latter, which I have more particularly described and illustrated in\r\nthe chapter on heating and ventilation, should, if the system adopted be\r\non the ordinary hot-air principle, be so placed that an abundant supply\r\nof fresh pure cold air can be obtained for the furnace, which, when\r\nheated, can be delivered into the hottest room above, not less than 5\r\nft. from the level of the floor of that chamber, and, also, where a\r\nsmoke flue of ample section can be constructed. The heated air may be\r\ndelivered through the gratings in the walls of the laconicum, or a shaft\r\nof glazed brickwork, of rectangular section, may be constructed against\r\nthe end wall and coped at the required level--5 ft. or more above the\r\nfloor line. Should the exigencies of the site separate the furnace\r\nchamber from immediate connection with the hottest room, the heated air\r\nmust be conducted from the former to the latter by means of a large\r\nshaft or shafts of glazed brickwork. Similar means may have to be\r\nemployed to bring the cold air to the heating-chamber, and at the mouth\r\nof this shaft some provision must be made for filtering the air before\r\nit is brought into contact with the heating surfaces of the furnace.\r\n\r\nHorizontal and inclined flues for conducting hot or cold air may be\r\ncarried from point to point on rolled iron joists having tooled York\r\nslabs set thereon, the flues being constructed of 4-1/2 in. brickwork\r\nwith glazed face internally, and covered with tooled York slabs.\r\nProvision must be made, in such flues, for effective cleansing, by means\r\nof iron air-tight doors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAVATORIUM AND SHAMPOOING ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe lavatorium and shampooing room now engage our attention. In\r\nelaborate baths they may, for the sake of effect, be distinct\r\napartments, while, where strict economy must be studied, they may be\r\ncomprised in one room; and where, again, space is extremely valuable,\r\nthe plunge bath and douche may be also included. If the first\r\narrangement be adopted, the shampooing room must be connected with the\r\ntepidarium, and the lavatorium placed next. Where the combination\r\napartment is used, it will take the position of the shampooing room.\r\nPractically, the combination arrangement is the best. It is putting the\r\nbather to needless and undesirable trouble to require him to move from\r\none apartment to another during the washing process.\r\n\r\nThe suite of washing and shampooing rooms may be arranged in either one\r\nof the following ways, according to the pretensions and requirements of\r\nthe establishment:--(1) A shampooing room, a lavatorium, a douche room,\r\nand a plunge bath chamber; (2) a combined shampooing and washing room,\r\nand a combined douche and plunge bath chamber; (3) several small\r\ncombined shampooing and washing rooms, a douche room, and a plunge bath\r\nchamber; (4) an apartment comprising shampooing slabs, washing basins,\r\ndouche, &c., and a plunge bath.\r\n\r\nA single shampooing room does not present a very complicated problem to\r\nthe designer. The chief object to be borne in mind is that the\r\nshampooers require \"elbow-room,\" and their patient in a convenient\r\nposition to allow of their practising their art. As this is no light\r\ntask--if properly performed--it becomes of urgent moment that the\r\napartment should be no less perfectly ventilated than a sudorific\r\nchamber. In a vitiated atmosphere, no shampooer can work well for a\r\nprolonged period, and, moreover, pure air is as necessary for the\r\nbathers when in these places, as when they are in the hot rooms.\r\n\r\nThe shampooing benches may be similar in description and size to those\r\nin the hot rooms. A width of 2 ft. is an ample provision, since the\r\nshampooer can more conveniently work with the bather as near him as\r\npossible. The benches may be constructed in a similar manner to those\r\nbefore described. They must be arranged on plan so that the shampooer\r\nhas ample room, whilst at the same time space is not extravagantly\r\nwasted. The benches must be topped with white marble slabs. They may run\r\nround the wall, or be placed at right angles to them; or, again, if\r\nfound more convenient, they may be altogether isolated. Similar means of\r\nventilating the shampooing and washing rooms as the hot rooms must be\r\nprovided. The vitiated air must be extracted at the floor level, as the\r\ntemperature here must be maintained considerably above that of respired\r\nair.\r\n\r\nMovable wooden-framed marble-topped benches may be substituted for\r\nthose of a permanent type; but the plan has nothing to recommend it\r\nexcept lowness of cost.\r\n\r\nThe separate lavatorium need not be so large as its adjoining shampooing\r\nroom, as here the bathers will not recline, but sit or stand before\r\nwashing-basins, to which must be conducted the flow pipes of hot water,\r\nand branches from the cold water supply pipe. These basins--which may be\r\nof glazed earthenware if solid marble cannot be afforded--should be\r\nlarge and capacious. Of water-fittings I shall speak under the head of\r\n\"Appliances.\"\r\n\r\nIn a combined shampooing and washing room the benches and basins will be\r\nrequired together. The basins may be fixed under a hole in the marble\r\nslabs, or affixed to the walls, as may be convenient. Whilst arranging\r\nthe position of the benches with regard to the room, and the basins with\r\nregard to the benches, it will be as well to remember the postures that\r\nthe bather assumes whilst being shampooed--viz. 1st, sitting; 2nd, on\r\nthe back; 3rd, reverse. The basin must be so placed with respect to the\r\nslab that the shampooer may, without altering his position, take water\r\nfrom the basin with his handbowl, and pour it over the bather. A\r\nshampooer cannot well work with less than 5 ft. 6 in. between his slab\r\nand that of his adjoining fellow, when the slabs are at right angles to\r\nthe wall and the adjoining shampooer is also working in the same space\r\nbetween the two benches. Where the room is long and a row of benches are\r\nplaced at right angles to the wall, the shampooers have each their\r\nseparate space to work in. Each one can then manage in 4 ft., and the\r\nslabs can be set out 6 ft. from centre to centre. Where the long sides\r\nof the slabs are against the walls and the basins are sunk into the\r\nslabs, there must be at least 7 ft. 6 in. from basin to basin. In the\r\ncase of slabs at right angles to the walls, the basins are best placed\r\nbetween the slabs.\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent plan to provide a slight screen in one corner of the\r\nwashing room, behind which the entering bather may, if he chooses, have\r\na warm spray from a large rose before proceeding to the hot rooms.\r\n\r\nIn ladies' baths it is well to provide private shampooing recesses by\r\nmeans of partitions of sufficient height, which may be of wood and\r\nobscure glass. In this way any shampooing room may be rendered more\r\nprivate. Upright marble slabs will often be found useful in dividing the\r\nbenches.\r\n\r\nThe walls and ceilings of the apartments now under consideration may, so\r\nlong as there be a dado of glazed ware, be lined in the same way as the\r\nhot rooms. But as regards flooring, still more care is required to\r\nprevent slipperiness. The soap and water that will be plentifully spilt\r\naround, renders this precaution needful. Moreover, provision must be\r\nmade for drainage.\r\n\r\nThe flooring may be of rough tile mosaic, or simple tiles. Marble is too\r\nslippery, and glazed tiles are wholly inadmissible. Marble mosaics,\r\nroughly set, may be employed. The fall to which the floor is laid must\r\nbe determined by the position of the gullies.\r\n\r\nThe drainage system of a hot-air bath is a most important consideration.\r\nIn a place where the occupants are, literally, _breathing at every\r\npore_, it is obvious that too much care cannot be taken to prevent all\r\npossible odours, and the slightest suspicion of an escape of deleterious\r\nsewer gases. The traps employed in the washing rooms should be of the\r\nbest possible design and material, and proof against the evil known as\r\n\"siphoning.\" The gullies above them are best placed adjoining one of the\r\nventilators in the walls, at the floor level, as then a current of air\r\nsweeps over them and up the extraction flues. It is not always that an\r\nopportunity is afforded to cut off the waste water from the drainage;\r\nwhere the bath rooms are above ground, however, this should be done if\r\npracticable. Where possible, an excellent plan is to construct a culvert\r\nunder the basement floor. In this the whole of the pipes can be\r\nplaced--the soil-pipes, the lavatorium and plunge bath wastes, &c., and\r\naccess gained to them by a manhole. By this means a cut-off could be\r\neffected between waste-pipes and the sewerage system. The culvert itself\r\ncould be ventilated by connecting it with an extraction flue. This is\r\nall costly; but the builder of a Turkish bath will do well to be\r\nprepared to lay out a liberal sum to perfect the system of drainage of\r\nthe establishment, and in the end, when the public have appreciated the\r\nattention bestowed, he will thank his architect for having impressed\r\nupon him the necessity for this extra expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOUCHE ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe douche room should be a small chamber adjoining the lavatorium, and\r\nfitted with a circular needle bath with shower or douche above, and any\r\nother kind of spray bath that may be required. It should not be a dark,\r\ncold, uninviting hole. For this reason, and also because a corner is\r\nadmirably adapted to receive an appliance of the shape of a needle bath,\r\nit is better, often, to fit it up in an angle of the lavatorium. But of\r\nthese additions I shall have much to say anon, as one of the most\r\nimportant points about a bath is the arrangement of the water-fittings.\r\nNeedle baths will be found indicated, on the plans given in these pages,\r\nby an incompleted circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLUNGE BATH.\r\n\r\nThough, according to medical authorities, this does not form a\r\n_necessary_ appendage to the hot-air bath, it is yet a feature that\r\n_must_ be provided in the least pretentious of public establishments.\r\nEver since, and long before, Cicero observed, in a letter to his brother\r\nQuintus, \"Latiorem piscinam voluissem ubi jactata brachia non\r\noffenderentur,\" men who have taken the hot-air bath have loved the ample\r\nplunge. But although it should be sufficiently large for any bather to\r\ntake a dive, and for an expert to take a true \"header,\" it is a vast\r\nmistake to overdo it, and construct a small swimming bath, out of all\r\nproportion with the other features of the establishment. One does not\r\nlook for such an adjunct: it is a great expense to keep up, requires a\r\nlot of space, and tempts many to stay too long in the cold water. All\r\npurposes will be served by a bath which will allow the bather to swim\r\nwithout touching the sides with his hands, and to dive along under\r\nwater without danger of striking his head at the other end before he\r\nrises to the surface. Wherever possible, the bath should be quite 25 ft.\r\nin length and at least 7 ft. wide. In inferior institutions it may be as\r\nnarrow as 4 ft. and proportionately shorter; but in such a bath one can\r\nonly flounder about, and healthy bathers will go elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn deciding the position of the plunge bath there is one point to be\r\nstrongly guarded against, and that is, that it be not stowed away in a\r\ndamp, cold-looking, cellar-like place. Such a position may be all very\r\nwell when the proprietor wishes to conceal dirty water; but from every\r\nother point of view it is highly objectionable. The wise man will bring\r\nhis bath forward into the lightest possible position, where its clear,\r\nlimpid waters will look enticing instead of repelling. For preference,\r\nit should be placed where the bather will take it naturally, _en route_\r\nto the frigidarium, as at the Charing Cross baths, previously\r\nillustrated. In baths all on one level, it is convenient to place the\r\nbath partly in the lavatorium and partly in the frigidarium; but, to\r\nmost persons, the necessity for passing under the inevitable partition\r\nand flap spoils the full enjoyment of the plunge. If placed within the\r\nfrigidarium, and approached by a door from the lavatorium, some sort of\r\na screen should be provided over the bath, as, at times, the apparition\r\nappearing at the above door, in full view of the occupants of the\r\ncooling-room, is somewhat ludicrous.\r\n\r\nThe demands of decency must be borne constantly in mind by the architect\r\nof a Turkish bath. If the bather, on leaving the plunge bath, finds\r\nhimself in the frigidarium, he must ascend the steps under hanging\r\ntowels. The arrangement that will be found the most convenient--a direct\r\nimportation from the East--is to suspend a hoop from the ceiling, and\r\nfrom this hang cords attached to towels. The hoop can be swung by an\r\nattendant over the end of the bath, and in it the bather can dry himself\r\nand be wrapped in towels before proceeding to his couch.\r\n\r\nWhether the plunge bath be placed in a separate chamber, in the\r\nlavatorium, or partly in the frigidarium, its construction will remain\r\nessentially the same. If not in shape and size, in other respects it is\r\na small swimming bath. The weight and pressure of the water must be\r\nremembered. A good foundation must be prepared for the bath, with a\r\nthick layer of concrete passing well under the side walls and covering\r\nthe whole floor. The side walls should be built of concrete and lined\r\nwith white glazed bricks. In certain soils, the excavation for the bath\r\nmay be puddled with advantage, but if properly constructed, this should\r\nbe unnecessary. The bottom of the bath need not be flat, as the most\r\neconomical method of constructing a plunge bath is to make its deepest\r\npart about two-thirds of its length from the end at which the bather\r\nenters. This may be about 4 ft. 6 in. in depth from bottom to\r\nwater-line. From this point the floor will slope towards either end,\r\ngradually towards the entering end, and more rapidly towards the exit.\r\nAt either end, where the depth of water should be about 3 ft, must be\r\nprovided steps for ascent and descent. If the bath be not more than 6\r\nft. wide, these should occupy the whole width, and be of marble or slabs\r\nof some cheaper material on brick bearers, or they may be built solid.\r\nA coping of marble, stone, or purpose-made bricks must be placed on the\r\nside walls; and, if the bath be in the cooling room, this may\r\nadvantageously be raised several inches to protect from splashing. On\r\nthe coping may be required metal standards and a neat hand-railing. A\r\nwater-supply pipe and screw-down tap, an overflow and a waste-pipe will\r\nbe needed, all of which I have more particularly specified hereinafter.\r\n\r\nThe plunge bath is at times a source of two difficulties--it may leak,\r\nand it may be below the level of drain. The first evil is the result of\r\nan error in design, or of bad workmanship; the latter is unavoidable.\r\nThe following method of constructing a plunge bath has been adopted with\r\nperfect success:--On the bed of concrete prepared for its floor, erect\r\nside walls of concrete, and on the floors and walls thus formed spread\r\ntwo distinct layers of asphalt, covering all and running up to the\r\nunderside of coping. Against the sides build half-brick walls in cement,\r\nwith glazed face, and lay the floor with glazed bricks flat. The general\r\nprinciples of this construction I show in the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nWhere the bath is lower than the drain, all that can be done is to drain\r\nout as much as possible and pump the remaining water from a \"sump\"\r\nprovided in a suitable position. By raising the plunge bath chamber a\r\nfew feet, the bottom of bath may, in some cases, be just kept above the\r\ndrain level; but steps must then be placed between it and the\r\nwashing-room, and steps in such places are dangerous, being very liable\r\nto become slippery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Plunge Bath.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIGIDARIUM OR COOLING ROOM, AND DRESSING ACCOMMODATION FOR BATHERS.\r\n\r\nDressing and cooling accommodation in a public bath may be provided in\r\none of the following ways:--1. A separate frigidarium and distinct\r\ndressing room, arranged (_a_) in direct communication with one another,\r\nor (_b_) connected by a lobby, corridor, or ante-room;--2. A combination\r\napartment arranged (_a_) with dressing-boxes around the walls, and\r\ncouches in the centre, or _vice versâ_; (_b_) with Oriental divans;\r\n(_c_) with couches screened off in pairs or singly by dwarf wood\r\nscreens; (_d_) with a few private dressing-boxes, a few couches, and a\r\nfew lounges, and easy cushioned chairs; and (_e_) as a simple room with\r\ncouches placed therein, by the side of which the bather will undress,\r\nand on which he will recline after his bath.\r\n\r\nThe first of these arrangements may be admirably adapted to\r\nunpretentious establishments, where, however, it is wished to employ\r\nseparate rooms; the second (1, _b_) is only suitable for elaborate baths\r\nof the highest class, in which it may be adopted with excellent and with\r\npractical results. Of the combination arrangements (_a_) has little to\r\nrecommend it; (_b_) is expensive and extravagant of space, though it may\r\nbe made very effective in appearance and very pleasing and comfortable;\r\n(_c_) is suitable for ladies' baths; (_d_) is very practicable, and\r\ngives the apartment a pleasant, homely look; and (_e_) is best for cheap\r\nbaths, being the simplest arrangement possible, wholly unsuited,\r\nhowever, to establishments of any pretension.\r\n\r\nIf the plan include a separate cooling room, it is nothing more than a\r\nspacious, cheerful apartment, designed with a view to the reception of\r\ncouches, and the usual accessories designed in connection with it--the\r\nrefreshment room, hairdresser and chiropodist's saloon. If this separate\r\ncooling room be provided, a distinct apodyterium, with little\r\ndressing-boxes, must be designed. If the bath be small and easily\r\nmanaged, curtains may be employed to screen those undressing; but if it\r\nbe a large establishment, with a number of bathers constantly dressing\r\nand undressing, doors must be provided, and these must be under lock and\r\nkey in charge of an attendant. Each dressing-box must be fitted with a\r\nseat, rack, and shelf; and looking-glasses, toilet-tables, and\r\nlavatories for general use must be placed in the room, which must be\r\ndesigned in direct connection with the frigidarium.\r\n\r\nThis should be spacious, light, lofty, and perfectly ventilated, the\r\nvitiated air being here extracted at the ceiling level, since the\r\ntemperature at which the apartment will be kept is an ordinary\r\none--_over_ that of the exterior air when the weather is cold, and\r\n_under_ when it is at all hot.\r\n\r\nWhere the cooling room and dressing room do not immediately adjoin, the\r\nmeans of communication should be carefully studied, so that it may be\r\nfree from cross draughts of cold air, and so that it may be dignified\r\nand room-like--not a mere passage. It may have the air of an ante-room,\r\nbut must not be crossed by entering bathers who have not divested\r\nthemselves of their boots or shoes. Slamming doors should be avoided,\r\nhaving regard to the exposed condition of the bathers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the theoretical and sentimental advantages of separate\r\ncooling and dressing-rooms, a combined frigidarium and apodyterium seems\r\nto have found favour latterly.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would gladly enter a protest against the employment of the\r\ncombined cooling and dressing room as a decidedly uncleanly habit. It is\r\ncertainly not pleasant to know that, having obtained perfect physical\r\ncleanliness, both inwardly and outwardly, one must return to couches\r\nwhereon previous bathers may, as likely as not, have, however\r\ntemporarily, deposited more or less of their underclothing or\r\nsuperimposed raiment. But economy of construction is nowadays a question\r\nthat must be considered at every step, and the combination apartment\r\nsaves both space and materials, and is also economical as regards\r\nattendance. Moreover, it must be confessed that a cooling room provided\r\nwith elegant and spacious divans, wherein the bather dresses and\r\nundresses, may be made very pleasing to the eye and withal comfortable\r\nand convenient. The dressing-boxes, too, of the separate apodyterium are\r\nnot conducive to the general sense of comfort.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the plan of a combined cooling and dressing room it is\r\nnecessary to first decide as to how the apartment will be\r\nfurnished--viz. which of the plans above mentioned shall be adopted.\r\nThis is much a matter of individual taste, though, as I have said above,\r\nthe divan is to be preferred in many cases. It is often well to provide\r\na cooling room of what may be called the \"picturesque\" order, or the\r\nreverse of stiff formality. By this I mean such an arrangement as 2,\r\n_d_. The bather can then choose between reclining in semi-privacy or in\r\nthe open, or, again, resting in an easy chair. With a handsome plunge\r\nbath and a pretty little fountain, such rooms may be rendered very\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the plan adopted, it must, I repeat, be carefully thought\r\nout previously, and not left as an afterthought. The size of the\r\nreclining couch will be found to be the governing feature. This should\r\nbe 6 ft. 6 in. long by 2 ft. 6 in. wide, or 6 ft. by 2 ft., according as\r\nluxury or economy is the end in view. Next to this must be considered\r\nthe space allowed for each bather to dress in, and also the routes for\r\nbathers and attendants. Four feet between the couches is a sufficient\r\nspace where couches are screened off in pairs.\r\n\r\nCouches may be arranged in pairs or singly. _Two pairs_ of couches\r\nscreened off with only a small space between of 4 ft. or so is an\r\nobjectional arrangement. It is difficult to explain why this is so; but\r\nthe bather who has made one of four strangers thus closely penned up\r\nwill appreciate the objection. An arrangement of four couches must\r\nexpand into a spacious divan.\r\n\r\nAt Fig. 5 are shown different ways of arranging couches in the\r\nfrigidarium. A shows the objectionable arrangement spoken of; B is the\r\ncomfortable, spacious divan; C the method of placing couches in pairs;\r\nand D is a private couch suitable for ladies' baths.\r\n\r\nThe floor of a cooling room must be boarded. In a bath where cost is\r\nsubordinate to excellence, a parquetry floor may be provided, and mats\r\nemployed, as cleaner than fixed carpets. The walls and ceilings may be\r\ntreated in any manner that may be chosen--plastered, papered, or\r\ndecorated with colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\nMethods of arranging Couches in Cooling Room.]\r\n\r\nAny shaped room may be adopted as a combined frigidarium and apodyterium\r\nso long as it fulfils the essential points--i.e. that it be spacious,\r\ncapable of easy and perfect ventilation, and of being kept cool, light,\r\nand cheerful. In the cooling room the bather will often stay longer than\r\nin any other apartment, and no pains should be spared to render it\r\nhealthy, comfortable, and attractive. The hygienic points to be attended\r\nto are, that there be an abundant supply of fresh cool air and an\r\neffective withdrawal of vitiated air; for the _cold-air bath_ in the\r\ncooling room is, in its way, as all-important as the bath of hot air.\r\nThe freshness of the air is of equally vital importance, as much of the\r\n_invigorating_ effect of the bath--that effect which to the minds of the\r\nuninformed is _weakening_--results from submitting the heated skin to\r\nvolumes of cold air.[2] In arranging any screens or screen walls in the\r\ncooling room, therefore, regard must be had to the method of\r\nventilation, that there be no stagnant corners and recesses. The scheme\r\nof ventilation must be decided by the nature of the apartment and its\r\nposition. In most cases the air is best admitted through the windows,\r\nfitted with fanlights falling backwards from the top, and extracted by a\r\npowerful self-acting exhaust at the ceiling level. In some positions\r\nextraction flues will have to be built, and, in others, flues of large\r\narea must conduct to the source from which the fresh air is drawn. Under\r\ncertain circumstances perfect ventilation will not be obtainable without\r\nthe aid of a powerful blowing fan-wheel driven by a motor of some sort,\r\nand running so as to exhaust the vitiated air. The means does not so\r\nmuch matter so long as the end be gained, and an ample supply of cool\r\nair obtained. A warm, close \"cooling room\" is worse than useless. In\r\nsuch places the bather will break out into renewed perspiration, and lie\r\nperspiring for hours, and become greatly weakened thereby, with a good\r\nchance of taking a chill on leaving the establishment.\r\n\r\nCooling rooms will always remain sufficiently _warm_ in all weathers if\r\nthey be in any ordinary relation to the heated apartments; but in the\r\nheight of summer care is required to keep them sufficiently cool. Where\r\nsimple, everyday precautions will not suffice, the air itself must be\r\ncooled, either by passing it through a cold chamber or over ice-boxes in\r\ninlet tubes, or through a water-spray. Only in exceptional cases,\r\nhowever, is it necessary to resort to such measures, as, contrary to the\r\nteachings of theorists, it has been found in practice that the proper\r\ntemperature for the cooling room of a hot-air bath varies in different\r\nstates of the weather, and should not remain constant all the year\r\nround.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Not _draughts_. The ancient Romans, it is curious to note,\r\nwould walk in the open air after the bath; and both the _Frigidarium_ of\r\nthe Romans and the _Mustaby_ of the Turks were, and are, open to the\r\nheavens.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHEATING AND VENTILATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many questions that merit attention and study in connection with\r\nthe Turkish bath, all sink into insignificance by the side of that of\r\nthe _heating_ and the _nature of the heat_ supplied in the sudatory\r\nchambers. Other things being equal, it is, after all, the _heating_ that\r\ndistinguishes one bath from another on the score of excellence. The\r\nheating of the \"bath\" is the Alpha and Omega of the whole matter.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways in which heat may be applied to the body--by direct\r\nradiation, as from the sun or an open fire; and by convection, as\r\nthrough a volume of air.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Roman bathers, with floors below them which rested upon\r\n_pilæ_, or little pillars of brick or tile, around which the flames and\r\nhot gases from the furnace played, and surrounded by heated, hollow\r\nwalls, evidently submitted themselves to the action of a heat that must\r\nhave been of a purely radiating character.\r\n\r\nSo, also, in a less perfect manner, the Turks, who employ flues running\r\nbeneath the floors, and the Moors, who adopt stoves visible to the\r\nbathers.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, radiant heat in a bath is vastly superior to that which\r\nis transmitted to the body through the medium of the air. Its virtues\r\nhave been extolled by David Urquhart and other eminent authorities on\r\nthe bath. \"There is a difference,\" says Mr. Urquhart, \"between radiating\r\nand transmitted caloric.... I cannot pretend to treat of this great\r\nsecret of nature; to work out this problem a Liebig is required. This I\r\ncan say, that such heat is more endurable than common heat. There is a\r\nliveliness about it which transmitted heat lacks. You are conscious of\r\nan electrical action. It is to transmitted heat what champagne is to\r\nflat beer.... Let us drop, if you please, the word 'bath': it is 'heat.'\r\nLet us away with that absurdity 'hot-air': it is the application of heat\r\nto the human frame.\" Elsewhere this writer has pointed out that the\r\nterms _thermæ_, _sèjac_, and _hammâm_--the names given to the bath by\r\nthe Romans, Moors, and Orientals proper--mean _heat_, and not \"hot-air\"\r\nor \"hot-air bath.\"\r\n\r\nMy own studies, observations, and experience lead me to the conclusion\r\nthat the direction in which we shall improve the \"Turkish bath\" will be\r\nin the way of providing sudatories that shall give off pure, radiant\r\nheat in such a manner that the whole surface of the body may be sensible\r\nof a degree of heat, while the lungs may breathe comparatively cool\r\nair--air that has not passed over the sides of a fiery furnace and been\r\nsuddenly raised to an enormous temperature, but which has received its\r\nheat by a gentle and gradual process of warming. Under this system the\r\nheat of which we are sensible is as the gentle Zephyr to rude Boreas or\r\nthe biting eastern winds. If we go into a kiln of brickwork, such as is\r\nemployed in firing clay goods, after the charge has been removed and\r\nall fumes and odours have disappeared, we shall note the soft and balmy\r\nnature of the heat that radiates directly from the walls and vaulting.\r\nWe are, to all practical intents and purposes, _in a Roman laconicum_.\r\nThe thick walls have been highly charged with caloric during the firing\r\nof the bricks or other articles. They have absorbed vast quantities of\r\nheat, and are now giving off the same to the enclosed air and to\r\nourselves standing within. In the old Roman bath the walls were charged\r\nwith caloric by means of innumerable earthen tubes lining the sides of\r\nthe laconicum, and covered with a peculiar plaster. But in both cases\r\nthe nature of the resultant heat is identical. It radiates to one from\r\nall sides. There is no acrid biting of the face such as one feels in the\r\nworst type of _hot-air_ baths; no unpleasant fulness or aching of the\r\nhead; and no panting or palpitating. Such is the \"bath\" of pure radiant\r\nheat, a thing totally distinct from, and altogether of a different genus\r\nto, the bath of heated air. And one might be pardoned for the enthusiasm\r\nwhich would lead one to suggest that it is only in the supplying of this\r\nkind of radiant heat in the modern bath that true and rapid progress can\r\nbe expected, and possibly that not until this great or\r\npartial--according as the system of radiation and convection pertains in\r\nexisting baths--revolution has been effected, will the bath, at present\r\nused by the few, become the custom of the many. Some day, peradventure,\r\nthis hypothetical method of employing pure radiant heat may be rendered\r\npossible and practicable, and we may be placed in a bath where we shall\r\nreceive great heat whilst breathing a comparatively cool atmosphere,\r\nand thus receive a measure of that electrical invigoration we experience\r\nwhen, in some sheltered bathing cove, we have exposed our bodies to the\r\nfiercest rays of the morning sun whilst yet we breathe the fresh, cool,\r\nozone-laden air.\r\n\r\nTill modern invention, however, has provided us with this desideratum in\r\nthe heating of the bath, we must be satisfied with existing methods. And\r\nunless something really practical is perfected, it is far wiser to rely\r\nupon the system of heating by convection through the air--the principle,\r\ngenerally adopted, of continuously passing large quantities of\r\nfreshly-heated air through the sudatory chambers; exposing, however, the\r\nheating apparatus, so that a maximum of radiant heat may be obtained;\r\nand carefully guarding against injuring the air whilst raising its\r\ntemperature. If only existing baths were in perfect harmony with this\r\nprinciple, one would have little cause for complaint, and might the more\r\nleisurely await the perfecting of the true radiating principle of\r\nheating, which I am satisfied is the one upon which we must base all our\r\nhopes for the future of the \"Turkish\" bath.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes, it will suffice if the method of heating and\r\nventilating a bath on the hot-air principle be explained. This I shall\r\nnow do, and subsequently give plans and instructions for methods of\r\nheating and ventilating on systems where, by the exposure of the heating\r\nsurfaces of furnaces, a large proportion of radiant heat is thrown into\r\nthe hot-rooms.\r\n\r\nThe necessary appliances, and arrangements for the heating and\r\nventilation of a bath on the ordinary hot-air principle comprise a\r\nfurnace in its chamber, with flues or shafts supplying cold, and drawing\r\noff the heated air, and a stokery with provisions for firing and storing\r\ncoke, &c. Too often the stokery is unscrupulously cramped, and the life\r\nof the stoker thereby rendered anything but pleasant. Its design is a\r\nsimple matter, and perhaps for this reason neglected. The arrangement\r\nand construction of the furnace chamber requires care, and the selection\r\nof a stove or furnace great judgment. As regards the latter feature, the\r\nmost important point to consider is the nature of the heating or\r\nradiating surfaces. What will raise the air to the required temperature,\r\nwithout in the process depriving it in any way of its vitalising\r\nelements, and without adulterating it with either smoke and fumes from\r\nleakage, or with particles of foreign matter given off from the material\r\nemployed in its construction?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing really better as a radiating surface than ordinary\r\nfirebrick. From this material a soft heat is given off, differing in\r\nquality from that obtained from iron. An iron furnace, however, requires\r\nless thought in design, gives less trouble in fitting up, and is cheap,\r\neconomical, and expeditious. Stoves, therefore, with an iron radiating\r\nsurface, have been largely adopted in the past, in spite of the\r\nobjection that, when super-heated, particles of metal are thrown into\r\nthe air of the hot rooms. Of iron furnaces there are many placed before\r\nthe public; but though all are doubtless suited to ordinary\r\nrequirements, there are few that are capable of creditably fulfilling\r\nthe conditions indispensable for the hygienic heating of the air of a\r\nTurkish bath.\r\n\r\nThese conditions may be summarised as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. A maximum of heating-surface, with a minimum of grate space.\r\n\r\n2. Perfect immunity from the danger of leakage from the furnace into the\r\nhot-air chamber or conduit.\r\n\r\n3. Freedom from the defect of liability to overheat the air.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to adulterate the air by throwing off matter from the\r\nheating surfaces.\r\n\r\nSuch primary essentials must be constantly borne in mind by the designer\r\nof furnaces for the Turkish bath. Their importance must be obvious to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOf the many iron stoves, Messrs. Constantine's \"Convoluted\" stove has\r\nbeen adopted the most frequently, as an eminently practical furnace for\r\nthe effective heating of the sudatory chambers. The appearance of this\r\nstove is familiar to all architects, and it will be unnecessary, in\r\nthese pages, to minutely describe its construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.\r\n\r\nView of a small Furnace Chamber, with portion of wall broken away to\r\nshow the \"Convoluted\" Stove.]\r\n\r\nThe method of constructing a furnace suitable for a small public bath\r\nis, however, shown at Fig. 6. The excavations for stokery and heating\r\nchamber being completed, and the position of the furnace determined a\r\nsolid foundation of concrete must be prepared, upon which the brickwork\r\nto support the stove must be laid. At the same time, the foundations for\r\nwalls of furnace chamber, stokery, coke store, and the side walls for\r\nthe horizontal cold-air conducting flues will be prepared. These latter\r\nmust then be built in half-brick with glazed interior face, and the\r\nfurnace inclosed in similar work, as shown in perspective sketch. The\r\nflues must be covered with York stone slabs 3 in. thick, up to within\r\nthree inches or so of the convolutions of the stove, at which distance\r\nthe side walls of the furnace must be erected, the back one similarly,\r\nand the front one round the four projecting doors, which are,\r\nrespectively, the ash-pit door, the fire door, and two doors for\r\ncleansing the horizontal smoke-box and interior of convolutions. The\r\nfurnace walls must be continued up to a few inches above the bend of\r\niron smoke flue, and then--if, as shown, the furnace be small--covered\r\nwith a 4-in. York slab in one piece. If the furnace be large, a flat\r\nbrick arch must form the covering, as at Fig. 8, where this arch\r\nsupports the flooring of the laconicum. The openings for the admission\r\nof the heated air into the conduit leading into the hot rooms may be\r\neither directly above, as shown in the last-named illustration, or in\r\nthe side, as in Fig. 6, with inclined flues. As a rule, it is more\r\neconomical, in heating on the principle now under consideration, to\r\nplace the furnace below the level of the hot rooms; but if desirable to\r\nplace both on one level, the back wall of the furnace chamber becomes\r\nthe party wall of the laconicum, and it must be stopped short of the\r\nceiling, and the air debouched over it.\r\n\r\nIn cheap baths the interior face of furnace chamber may be of stock\r\nbrickwork; but best glazed work should be adopted in good ones. All hot\r\nand cold-air ducts should be similarly lined with glazed ware. In\r\nfirst-class work the floors of horizontal and inclined flues should be\r\nof white glazed tiles set in cement. Manholes must be provided for\r\ncleaning when necessary. Every portion of furnace chamber, flues,\r\nshafts, and conduits for hot and cold air must be \"get-at-able\" either\r\nby means of manholes or by long brushes. Air-tight doors must be\r\nindicated on the plans wherever this necessity demands them.\r\n\r\nThe iron smoke-pipe from furnace must be conducted to the smoke flue,\r\nand the connection between furnace chamber and flue hermetically sealed.\r\nThe walls for a small furnace chamber need not be more than 4-1/2 in.\r\nthick. Large furnaces require walls one-brick thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\n\r\nAn Air Filter.]\r\n\r\nThe cold-air flues leading from either side of the furnace must be\r\nconducted to their respective inlets. If possible, at least two inlets\r\nshould be provided, facing different ways: this with regard to the\r\npossibility of certain winds drawing the air out where it is wanted to\r\nenter. The openings should be vertical, like windows, and, in cities,\r\nfurnished with a solid frame and casement, fitted with louvres of plate\r\nglass with polished edges. Between the rebate and the casement it is a\r\ngood plan to leave a space of an inch and a half for a movable\r\nstretcher-frame holding several layers of \"cheese-cloth\" to filter the\r\nair. The construction of such an air filter is shown at Fig. 7. The\r\nglass louvres keep out the wet, and throw off coarse particles of\r\nfalling soot; and the provision of a movable stretcher permits the\r\ncloths to be frequently changed for clean ones--a very important point,\r\nthough little heeded, if not, perhaps, wholly ignored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.\r\n\r\nPlans and Section of a Furnace Chamber, &c., for a Bath on the ordinary\r\nHot-air Principle.]\r\n\r\nThe position of air intake is a matter of great importance, especially\r\nin large towns. It evidently is bad to draw a supply of air from the\r\nbottom of an area. Even the position shown in Fig. 8 is not good: the\r\nshaft should be carried higher. The best places for the intakes are\r\nwhere there is always a current of pure air blowing, and away from smoky\r\nchimneys. Theoretically, it would seem that the higher the level of\r\nintake the better; but in cities, by going high we get among the\r\nbelching chimney-tops, even if we escape the stagnation below. Moreover,\r\na high inlet with a strong wind tending to exhaust the air in the shaft\r\nmight find the architect with the cold air sweeping through his bath,\r\nand all the heated air rushing up the supply-shaft. A large\r\n\"lobster-back\" automatically turning _towards_ the wind, would in many\r\ncases prevent such a disastrous result. Even in low-level intakes, as I\r\nhave said, trouble will sometimes arise from the same cause. This may be\r\nremedied by providing more than one inlet, so that only the one facing\r\nthe current of air will be employed, the other being closed, which could\r\nbe effected by fixing the glass louvres, spoken of above, on pivots, and\r\nconnecting them with a rod and adjustable rack. It would be a very\r\nsimple matter to make the wind itself automatically open and shut the\r\nlouvres.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the heating and ventilation of the hot rooms requires most\r\ncareful study, and the particular scheme to be adopted in any new bath\r\nmust be well considered with respect to the restrictions of the site. At\r\nFig. 8, I have endeavoured to show how to make the best of what is\r\nperhaps a bad job: the site only admits of ventilation at a back area,\r\nit is impossible to construct flues anywhere else, and the fresh air\r\nmust be drawn from the same area. On the ground floor are cooling and\r\ndressing rooms; the bath rooms are in the basement and the furnace in a\r\nsub-basement, reached from a passage at the end of the stairs for the\r\nbather. Two convoluted stoves are shown in a vault; three air-inlets are\r\nprovided, and the foul air is drawn up into the smoke flues, two in\r\nnumber, which, above, could join one another. Let us follow the air in\r\nits passage through the bath. Entering at the intakes, any coarse\r\nimpurities are thrown off by the smooth louvres, and the tendency of\r\nfiner particles to rush in is checked by the stretched canvas\r\ncheese-cloths. Thus deprived of its actually visible impurities, the air\r\npasses through a longer or shorter conduit of glazed brickwork until it\r\nreaches the horizontal flues running to beneath the furnace walls, along\r\nwhich it is rapidly drawn, and, ascending between the walls and heating\r\nsurfaces and between the two adjacent heating surfaces, absorbs the\r\nradiating heat and enters the laconicum by way of the rectangular shaft\r\nconstructed above the vault spanning the two stoves.\r\n\r\nQuestions of temperature I will omit for the present. The air, on\r\npassing through the laconicum, will be practically pure, as it is in\r\nsuch great bulk compared with the number of occupants of this\r\nhighly-heated chamber, and it will not be absolutely necessary to\r\nprovide ventilators. These should commence in the calidarium, and\r\nshould, in the scheme of ventilation here considered, be so disposed\r\nthat the nearer they are to the lavatorium and shampooing-room, the more\r\nfrequent will they become. The object of this disposition of outlets for\r\nvitiated air is, that the cross currents thus created may not interfere\r\nwith the main flow from the heating chamber to the lavatorium. Were too\r\nmany ventilators to be placed near the hotter end of the sudatorium,\r\nthis stream would be diverted. Too much of the freshly-heated air would\r\nflow out at these points, and the onward movement of the air would be\r\nenfeebled. There would then be difficulty in maintaining the temperature\r\nin the tepidarium and lavatorium.\r\n\r\nIn passing onward through the various rooms, two changes are wrought in\r\nthe air: it loses so much of the caloric with which it is charged for\r\nevery foot it travels, and it becomes laden with the exhalations from\r\nthe lungs of the bathers. A large proportion of carbonic acid is thrown\r\ninto the air, and as the normal temperature of the human body remains,\r\nin a healthy person, at about 98° Fahr., and rises but a few points even\r\nwhen submitted to the action of heat, these exhalations, in addition to\r\nbeing heavier than air, are very much below the average temperature of a\r\nsudatory chamber. Consequently they fall, and must be extracted at the\r\nfloor level.\r\n\r\nThe total area of the outlets for vitiated air should be about equal to\r\nthe area of the narrowest part of the shaft that conducts the fresh, hot\r\nair from the heating chamber. Thus, supposing the latter to be 5\r\nsuperficial feet, and the size of outlet ventilators a clear 12 in. by 3\r\nin., there may be 20 ventilators disposed round the bath-rooms, say 4 in\r\nthe calidarium, 7 in the tepidarium, and 9 in the combined shampooing\r\nroom and lavatorium.\r\n\r\nIn the diagrams at Figs. 8 and 9 the foul-air conduit is the space\r\ncomprised under the marble-topped benches running round the hot rooms.\r\nAt the end of the laconicum they enter flues, which I have shown as\r\nrunning side by side with the smoke flues.\r\n\r\nOther methods of heating the air, besides those mentioned, include coils\r\nof iron flue-pipes in a brick chamber--a principle that has been\r\nfrequently adopted in the past--and plain cylindrical iron radiating\r\nstoves, such as employed at the Hammam in Jermyn Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.\r\n\r\nSection of Hot Room, showing Foul-air Conduit.]\r\n\r\nIn the latter plan, however, a great expense is created by the large\r\nnumber of furnace-fires to be kept constantly burning. An exposed stove\r\nin a hot room, has, moreover, the objection to its use that it re-heats\r\nthe air in the bath, which should never on any account be done.\r\n\r\nIf the iron stove-pipe system is adopted, a furnace similar to the one\r\nshown at Fig. 10 must be provided, and after an additional few feet of\r\nbrick flue the iron pipe would commence and turn back upon itself much\r\nas the flue in the fire-brick furnace. Proper supports must be\r\nprovided, and the pipes must be stout and jointed together with\r\nexpansion joints, otherwise considerable difficulty will be found in\r\nkeeping a long length of flue pipe perfectly free from leakage. Furnaces\r\non this principle may be designed so that they throw a certain amount of\r\nradiant heat direct into the hot-rooms, and they possess this advantage\r\nover a mere stove, that they warm the air more gradually. The furnace\r\nshould be built adjoining the laconicum, the partition wall being of\r\n4-1/2-inch glazed brickwork, having a large number of small openings\r\nmade therein by leaving void spaces as described further on for the\r\nfireclay heating apparatus. Behind this wall the iron flue-pipe should\r\nbe placed, turning back upon itself, as described above, for perhaps\r\nhalf-a-dozen times, and ending in the vertical brick flue. The furnace\r\nitself should be of fire-clay, and so designed that its utmost heating\r\npower may be economically employed in warming the incoming air, which\r\nshould pass over the furnace and iron flues, through the holes in\r\npartition wall, and thus into the hot rooms. The flue, if of wrought\r\niron, should be rectangular in section, but if of cast-iron it should be\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe most economical way of obtaining a high temperature in a small,\r\ninexpensive, and unpretentious private bath is by means of a common\r\nlaundry stove, with a longer or shorter length of iron flue in the\r\napartment. This is the cheapest and quickest method of raising the\r\ntemperature of a room for sudorific purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.\r\n\r\nA Fireclay Heating Apparatus.]\r\n\r\nTo turn to methods of heating from a radiating surface of firebrick, at\r\nFig. 10 I have given the plan, elevation, and sections of a fireclay\r\nheating apparatus. It is constructed wholly of fireclay--fireclay\r\nbricks, quarries, and cement. In the main it consists of a long flue of\r\nfirebricks and slabs, which coils backwards and forwards over itself\r\ntill the desired amount of radiating surface is gained. Between the\r\ncoils are spaces for super-heating the air already warmed by passing\r\nover the actual furnace and into the warm air chamber, the air passing\r\nthrough by means of perforated bricks. The illustration shows a simple\r\nfurnace; but it would be an easy matter to improve upon this by\r\nproviding iron air-tight doors lined with fireclay, for cleansing flues\r\nand air-chambers. The example given is only suited to heat a small\r\npublic bath. For a large set of hot rooms, a compound apparatus could be\r\nconstructed by placing an additional furnace in a sub-basement, the one\r\non the level of the sudatory supplying radiant heat, and the lower one\r\nhot air. Two such apparatus might be placed one behind the other, end to\r\nend, or might form the _sides_ of the laconicum; the last plan, however,\r\nbeing the least to be recommended, as in such positions they would not\r\ndirectly radiate their heat into the adjoining hot rooms.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of such a furnace as that shown is that it supplies\r\nradiant heat of a most exhilarating kind, besides a proportion of heated\r\nair, and from a fireclay surface, the employment of which renders it\r\nabsolutely impossible to overheat the air, or to contaminate it by\r\ndeleterious particles resulting from the decomposition of metal.\r\nMoreover, the stoking of this class of furnace requires less arduous\r\nattention than an iron stove. Its disadvantage is that, should the\r\ntemperature of the bath be allowed to fall markedly, it requires some\r\ntime for the extra heat to be made up again. Inasmuch, however, as fires\r\nat public baths must be kept banked up overnight, this is not a matter\r\nof importance. It is this very slowness of increase in temperature that\r\nconstitutes the safeguard against that overheated air, the presence of\r\nwhich we can, with practice, detect by the smell in so many baths. The\r\ndifficulties involved in the construction of a furnace of this nature\r\nrelate to the prevention of cracking and consequent escape of sulphurous\r\nfumes and carbon into the air. The very simplicity of the construction\r\nof the flues and air-chambers constitutes the chief danger, as the\r\nchances are that, unless the architect stands by and sees every joint\r\nmade, the work will be done badly. Absolutely faultless workmanship must\r\nbe employed throughout, and the fireclay materials must be literally of\r\nthe very best and soundest description. Every single joint must be\r\nperfectly made with fireclay cement or paste. The fireclay bricks, &c.,\r\nmust be selected with regard to the amount of indestructible silica in\r\nthe clay, consistent with hardness and toughness. Homogeneity of\r\nmaterial must be obtained, having regard to expansion and contraction.\r\nThe same material used for the bricks, &c., worked into a paste, must be\r\nemployed for the joints.\r\n\r\nThe design for a furnace on the principle shown at Fig. 10 must be\r\nprepared with constant regard to expansion and contraction in heating\r\nand cooling. Should this warning be disregarded, fractures will result.\r\nIt will be seen, upon reference to the plans, that the block of flues\r\nand air spaces is left quite free, to allow of any expansion, the\r\nconnection with the smoke-shaft being by means of an iron flue-pipe,\r\nwhich, being provided in considerable length before passing through the\r\nparty-wall of laconicum and stokery, by its flexible nature permits any\r\nslight movement in a vertical direction. If an \"expansion\" joint were\r\nprovided, there would be a sufficient length of iron pipe if it passed\r\ndirect from the junction with the heating apparatus into the stokery. So\r\nmuch of the iron flue as is in the laconicum must be coated with\r\nasbestos or some composition, or the heating will not be wholly by\r\nfirebrick. The junction of iron flue and heating apparatus is shown by a\r\ncast-iron cap sliding over a projecting rim of fireclay, moulded into\r\nthe last quarry cover, similar to the way in which cast-iron mouthpieces\r\nare fitted to retorts.\r\n\r\nThis heating apparatus is shown visible in the laconicum, but if thought\r\ndesirable it could be screened by a wall of glazed bricks--9 in. and\r\nmiss 4-1/2 in. The 4-1/2 by 3 in. holes can be arranged in diamond\r\npatterns. This screen wall, however, cuts off a large quantity of\r\nradiant heat.\r\n\r\nThe first flue past the actual furnace--shown with ordinary dead-plate,\r\nraking fire-bars, ashpit, fire-door, and ashpit door for regulating\r\ndraught--has walls 4-1/2 in. thick; above, smaller bricks, 3 in. wide;\r\nbut in a larger apparatus, 9 in. and 4-1/2 in. respectively would be\r\nrequired. The quarries between flues and air spaces are 24 in. by 24 in.\r\nby 3 in., with rebated joints. Larger covers would be more liable to\r\ncrack at any provocation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to heating by means of furnaces, steam-heating may be\r\nemployed, if found, as in many cases it would be, convenient and\r\neconomical. The chief disadvantage of this method of heating Turkish\r\nbaths, is the constant danger, however slight, of bursting a pipe in\r\nthe heating coil, which, by immediately filling the highly-heated\r\natmosphere with vapour, might prove most disastrous to the occupants of\r\nthe hot rooms, who would be seriously scalded. Nevertheless, the\r\nprinciple has been largely employed in the heating of the most recent\r\nTurkish baths in Germany.\r\n\r\nIf adopted it may be either on the hot-air or radiating plan, as in\r\nheating by means of furnaces. In the first method the fresh air is\r\nintroduced into a chamber containing a coil of steam-pipes, and passes\r\nthence into the laconicum by a shaft or conduit, as in the case of air\r\nheated by a stove. In the second method, steam radiators--compact\r\nbatteries of pipes--must be placed in recesses in the hot rooms, fresh\r\nair being introduced over them. The steam-pipes employed should be of\r\nthe \"small bore\" type, about 5/8 inch internal diameter, and of wrought\r\niron or copper. In order to ensure as far as possible against the danger\r\nof explosion, the system of pipes should be tested, when fixed, by\r\nsevere hydraulic pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a great advantage, in point of ease and economy, to be\r\nable to warm a building, drive machinery, and heat Turkish and Russian\r\nbaths from one boiler, which can readily be done, very ordinary\r\npressures of steam giving sufficient heat to keep the radiators of the\r\nrequisite temperature. But the nature of the heating accomplished by\r\nmeans of steam-pipes is very inferior to that from large radiating\r\nsurfaces of firebrick.\r\n\r\nThe average temperatures of a public bath should range from about 110°\r\nin the shampooing rooms to 250°-260° in the hottest part of the\r\nlaconicum, taking the readings of the thermometer at a level of 6 ft. 6\r\nin. above floor-line. Between the entrance of the heated air and its\r\npoint of furthest travel in the shampooing rooms, the bather should be\r\nable to select any temperature that may be most agreeable to him, and as\r\nmany find by experience that a certain degree of heat is best suited to\r\nthemselves, it shows attention to the _habitués_ of the bath, if the hot\r\nrooms are carefully maintained at the same uniform temperatures\r\nthroughout the year. This may be 110°-120° in the shampooing rooms, 140°\r\nin the tepidarium, 180° in the calidarium, and 250° in the laconicum.\r\nThese must be the maxima of the average temperatures of each room at 6\r\nft. 6 in. above the floor. In a pure atmosphere the highest temperatures\r\nare comfortable, but in a foul one they become insupportable.\r\n\r\nIn a good bath, where there is a rapid and continuous flow of air, there\r\nwill be comparatively little difference between the temperature at say 4\r\nft., 6 ft., and 8 ft. above the floor. In badly-ventilated rooms, where\r\nthe air stagnates, there will be a considerable difference. And here we\r\nmay note a serious objection to the heating of a bath by convection; for\r\nwhile the head may be in a high degree of heat the feet are in\r\ncomparatively cool air, whereas, if possible, it should be just the\r\nreverse. In convected heat, this of course applies in its entirety, as\r\nwhere so-called radiant heat is employed the evil is not quite so\r\nmarked. And here, too, we may note the admirable nature of the Roman\r\nsystem of heating, where the floors radiated the majority of the heat,\r\nand the walls a slightly less amount. The fresh air under the ancient\r\nsystem must have entered through the cooler rooms, and being drawn\r\ntowards the _calidarium_ found its exit through the ceilings, at times\r\nby way of the regulating device mentioned by Vitruvius. Thus the ancient\r\nbather would not suffer the inconvenience that accrues to the bather in\r\nthe modern hot-air bath, whose head, when he is standing upright, is in\r\na considerably higher temperature than any other portion of his body.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of a bath should not be regulated by the firing of the\r\nfurnace. This should be regularly stoked, and kept at one uniform\r\nheat-giving condition. Bad firing and forced firing may crack the stove\r\nshould it be of iron, and the air may be overheated. The temperature\r\nshould be regulated by means of the hit-and-miss ventilators at the\r\nfloor level. Fanlights between the various hot rooms, with screw-rod\r\nadjustment, serve as a means for regulating their relative temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe heating power of furnaces must be studied. Having calculated the\r\ncubical contents of the rooms to be heated, and given the heating power\r\nof the stove or apparatus to be employed per cwt. of metal or\r\nsuperficial foot of radiating surface, we arrive at the necessary size.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Constantine give the following tables to show the heating power\r\nof the \"Convoluted\" stove. The figures give the requisite size of stove\r\nto raise the air to about the relative temperatures I have mentioned\r\nbefore, and with ordinary firing.\r\n\r\n  Weight of    Sq. ft. of        Area capable\r\n   metal.    heating surface.     of heating.\r\n    ---            ---                ---\r\n    cwt.         sq. ft.           cub. ft.\r\n\r\n     14             35                                               500\r\n     20             55                1,200\r\n     22             69                2,000\r\n     34            119                3,500\r\n     36            139                5,000\r\n     45            180                8,000\r\n     50            231               12,000\r\n     56            296               16,000\r\n\r\nWhen different kinds of heating apparatus are employed, their heating\r\npower must be carefully ascertained and calculations entered into, or it\r\nmay be found necessary to resort to the costly and humiliating process\r\nof dragging out the stove or pulling down the furnace and refitting a\r\nlarger one. This point is worth attention. Such mistakes are not\r\nunfrequently made.\r\n\r\nAs regards the amount of air that should flow through the hot rooms, an\r\nallowance of 40 cubic feet per head per minute should be the minimum, if\r\npurity of atmosphere is to be maintained. In a bath, the importance of\r\nperfect ventilation cannot possibly be over estimated, as not only has\r\nthe respired air from the lungs to be removed, but also the deleterious\r\nexhalations from the skin which are produced by perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe allowance of 40 cubic feet per head per minute should not, if\r\nproperly distributed, cause an unpleasant draught in any part of the hot\r\nrooms; for it must be remembered that even in a highly-heated atmosphere\r\na waft of air of the same temperature is felt to be cold. The main thing\r\nto be studied in this provision of a large volume of air is that the\r\ncold inlet be ample, and the passage from this intake to the point\r\nwhere the air is debouched into the laconicum equally roomy and\r\nunobstructed. The rapidity of flow will depend upon the means provided\r\nfor the extraction of the foul air. With large horizontal flues, and a\r\ncapacious and tall shaft, the so-called natural system of ventilation\r\nwill be as effective as could be desired. Greater extraction power is\r\ngained if in the brick stack a smoke-pipe can be placed running up the\r\nwhole height. In many cases mechanical ventilation could be employed\r\nwith the greatest benefit. A powerful air-propeller fixed at the end of\r\na system of horizontal flues under the floors of the hot rooms, and\r\nrunning so as to exhaust, would do away with all the objectionable\r\nodours and nastiness of many baths.\r\n\r\nThe purity or foulness of the air in the hot rooms forms all the\r\ndifference between a good bath and a bad one, which latter is infinitely\r\nworse than no bath at all. There exist, at the present time, scores of\r\nbaths where the odours of the sudatory chambers are nauseating. Such\r\nfoulness arises from stagnation of the air. There is no continuous flow,\r\nand the respirations and exhalations of the bathers are not removed. A\r\nsystem of ventilation may be pointed out, but it is on the wrong\r\nprinciple, and does not act. There is no change of air. The atmosphere\r\nof such places becomes pestilential.\r\n\r\nOwing to the expansion by heat, a relatively greater volume of air\r\nenters the laconicum than the cold intake. This fact, however, does not\r\npractically affect the arrangements for ventilation, &c. Theoretically,\r\nhowever, it would seem to demand that the shaft conducting from furnace\r\nto hot rooms should be of greater sectional area than that to the\r\nfurnace from the intake--about one-third larger--and that the total area\r\nof outlets for the escape of vitiated air should be about midway between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nThe whole principle of the ventilation of the hot rooms of a Turkish\r\nbath resolves itself, primarily, into the fact that we have to\r\ncontinually remove _the bottom layer of air_. The provision of the\r\nfoul-air conduits below the floor level is equivalent to providing a\r\nsuspended floor with a hollow space under. This is just the reverse of\r\nthe principle of ventilating rooms of ordinary temperature, where we\r\nrequire to constantly remove the top layer, and often actually do so\r\nwhen we provide false ceilings to passages, &c.\r\n\r\nThe ventilators placed at the floor level of the hot rooms should be\r\nactually so, and not 3 in. or 6 in. above. Long, wide gratings 6 in.\r\ndeep are preferable to those of deeper and narrower design. In theory,\r\nindeed, the whole circumference of the hot rooms should be lined round\r\nwith gratings, thus making the sudatorium like a lidless box inverted,\r\ninto which hot air is thrown and escapes all round the bottom edges.\r\n\r\nThere is one point about the circulation of air in a set of hot rooms\r\nthat requires considerable attention, and that is the _back-flow_ along\r\nthe floor. In any bath where hot air is supplied, if the bather will\r\nhold his linen \"check\" across the top of the doorway between the rooms\r\nhe will find that the air is flowing from the laconicum to the\r\nshampooing room. If, however, the sheet be held across the lower\r\nportion of the doorway, he will find that there is a current of air\r\nsetting in an opposite direction--from the shampooing room to the\r\nlaconicum. This is shown at Fig. 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.\r\n\r\nLongitudinal Section of Sudatory Chambers.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the diagram that the bather is really in this\r\nback-flow when he is standing between and in a line with the doors of\r\nthe hot rooms. All the air appears to be travelling along the top of the\r\nbath, and the bather reclining on the marble-topped benches would seem\r\nto be bathed in air that has passed along the top of the bath, round the\r\nshampooing rooms, and back along the floor. In reality, however, it is\r\nonly from door to door that the currents exist exactly as shown at the\r\ndiagram, Fig. 11, there being a secondary circulating process in each\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThis circulation of air will exist in any bath heated on the modern\r\nsystem--that is to say, where freshly-heated air is passed in in\r\nsufficient quantity. It is a natural result, and tends to distribute the\r\nheat more equally. The back-flow is only objectionable when a door is\r\nopened direct from the heated shampooing rooms to a cooler apartment, as\r\nthe plunge bath chamber. The bather standing in a line between the\r\ndoorways may then feel a cold draught. To guard against this, double\r\ndoors, with a small lobby between, should be provided to any means of\r\ncommunication with a cold chamber.\r\n\r\nA set of hot rooms could be constructed so that the bather would be in\r\nthe top current of air that flows from the heating apparatus. By\r\nreference to Fig. 11 the reader will understand that by the provision of\r\na platform or grating midway between the floor and ceiling this end\r\nwould be attained.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the sudatorium must be perfectly free from vapour.\r\n\"Perfect dryness of the air,\" says Mr. Urquhart, \"is indispensable to\r\nthe enduring of a high temperature.... This dryness is further requisite\r\nfor electrical isolation. With vapour in the chamber an atmosphere is\r\ncreated injurious to health and conducive to disease. It is the very\r\ncondition in which low, putrid, and typhus fevers flourish. The\r\nelectrical spark will not ignite in such an atmosphere, and the magnet\r\nwill lose its attractive power. We all know the difference of our own\r\nsensations on a dry and on a damp day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWATER FITTINGS AND APPLIANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe water-fittings of a Turkish bath include a boiler of some form for\r\nheating the water, a cold-water cistern, and a hot-water tank;\r\nsupply-pipes, flow and return pipes, and branch pipes; lavatorium\r\nfittings, comprising bowls, basins, and cocks; douche room fittings, as\r\nthe \"needle\" bath, shower, douche, spray, and \"wave\" baths; a warm\r\nshower-bath for bathers entering the bath, or desiring such a shower at\r\nintervals; and the fittings of the plunge bath. In addition to this\r\nthere may be required a drinking fountain in the tepidarium, and an\r\nornamental fountain in the frigidarium; lavatories in various positions;\r\nand, possibly, fittings and appliances for the laundry.\r\n\r\nPremising an ample supply of pure water, it must be brought into the\r\nbuilding through a water-meter to the cold water cistern, which should\r\nbe at a sufficiently high level to obtain a good \"head.\" This cistern\r\nmust be capacious and properly connected, on the ordinary circulating\r\nprinciple, with a hot water tank and boiler. Of suitable boilers there\r\nare several in the market, of many and varied designs. Simplicity of\r\nconstruction should be the guide to a selection. The boiler will perhaps\r\nits most conveniently placed in the stokery, and have be separate\r\nfurnace and flue, any scheme for combining the heating of the hot rooms\r\nand of the water being out of the question. In small baths, however, the\r\nhot-water tank may, for economy's sake, be placed near the ceiling in\r\nthe laconicum. Where waste steam can be obtained, a water super-heater,\r\nwith steam coil, may be employed with advantage; but in the majority of\r\ncases the ordinary circulating system will be found the most suitable.\r\n\r\nThe supply-pipes must be of large section, and indeed, the whole scheme\r\nof water-fitting should be liberal. It must be remembered that, in\r\naddition to the wants of the lavatorium and douche room, plunge, &c.,\r\nthere will be a large amount of water required for laundry purposes, if\r\nwashing be done upon the premises.\r\n\r\nThe cold supply cistern may, by the exigencies of the case, be kept down\r\nas low as the ceiling of the bath-rooms, and be placed over some\r\nsubsidiary apartment. This does not give much pressure of water. For all\r\npurposes it is best to have the cistern at a minimum height of about 20\r\nft. above the draw-off taps and valves of the various bathing\r\nappliances. This will ensure a good head of water, and make the douche a\r\nformidable affair.\r\n\r\nThe pipes, unions, tees, valves, and cocks should all be of the best\r\ndescription in so important a work as the fitting-up of a public bath.\r\nOrdinary bungling plumbing is here out of place. Lead piping should be\r\ndiscarded for all but very cheap work, and iron employed in its stead,\r\nwith proper screwed joints, angles, and tees. Should there be\r\nsufficient means, _copper_ piping should be employed for anything under\r\n1 in. internal diameter, and gunmetal should be used for unions, &c.,\r\nand for cocks and valves.\r\n\r\nHandsome, large, and well-made water-fittings conduce, in no small\r\ndegree, to the effect of a bath. There should be no attempt at hiding\r\naway of pipes, &c. They should be made features of the bath, and be\r\ndesigned with care and neatly finished. Every pipe, joint, and\r\nconnection should be prearranged, and the means of fixing and supporting\r\nthe same carefully designed. Boxings, and the like, should be discarded,\r\nand everything frankly exhibited. The day for mysterious plumbing has\r\ngone by. There is some beauty even in a pipe.\r\n\r\nTo consider the fittings, we will commence with the lavatorium. Branches\r\nfrom the hot and cold water supply pipes must be conducted to each\r\nshampooer's basin. These may be finished separately, with independent\r\nnozzles, as at Fig. 12; or the pipes may be connected with the valve\r\nshown at Fig. 13, about 18 in. above the basin, the outlet of the valve\r\nbeing fitted with a foot or 15 in. of indiarubber hose. In the latter\r\ncase the pipes and valve would stand some 9 in. from the wall, and\r\ndepend from the horizontal supply pipes, which in their turn could be\r\ncarried on wrought-iron brackets affixed to the wall, or be hung by iron\r\nties, as indicated by dotted lines at Fig. 16. The _internal_\r\ndiameter--the measurement given in all the figures--of these branch\r\npipes to taps over shampooing basins should be 3/4 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.\r\n\r\nA Shampooing Basin.]\r\n\r\nCocks and valves for the purposes of the Turkish bath are best of the\r\n\"gland\" pattern. They should have bold handles. Those of the screw-down\r\ntype are useless, except as stop-cocks. Roundways should be used, and,\r\nto insure freedom of running, the turning part should be equal to the\r\ninner diameter of the pipes. The whole should be of gunmetal, and, if\r\nthe pipes to be used be of iron, screwed at the end. Fig. 13 shows the\r\ntype of valve to be employed to regulate the temperature of water for\r\nshower baths, &c. To be useful, as well as bold and effective in\r\nappearance, the handles should be large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.\r\n\r\nValve for Regulating Temperature of Water.]\r\n\r\n_In every case_, the cold water must be placed on the right hand, and\r\nthe hot on the left.\r\n\r\nThe earthenware basin is provided to hold water mixed to the required\r\ntemperature. A waste and overflow are not shown in the illustration, but\r\nthey should be provided. The basin is best wide and shallow--shallower\r\nthan shown. There should be no overhanging ledge to catch the\r\nshampooer's hand-basin; for this reason I have shown, at Fig. 12, the\r\nbasin sunk into the marble slab, instead of the marble being on top, as\r\nordinary. The copper hand-basin is provided for the shampooer to take\r\nwater from the earthenware basin and throw over the shampooing slab, or\r\nover the bather. In addition, a wooden, copper-banded soap-bowl must be\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nShould there be a row of shampooing basins and benches, the horizontal\r\nsupply-pipes must be continued along the wall, and branches dropped to\r\neach basin. The basins are most conveniently placed when raised somewhat\r\nhigher than the benches. In the illustration given, I have shown how to\r\narrange horizontal foul-air flues under the basins. In other cases the\r\nfixing of the basins will be much simpler. For pure lavatorium purposes\r\nthese basins, cocks, &c., are all the water-fittings to be considered;\r\nbut in an apartment combining the purposes of douche room--and perhaps a\r\nplunge bath chamber--as well as a washing and massage room, more or less\r\nof the fittings about to be described will have to be accommodated.\r\n\r\nThe tonic appliances for treating the bather subsequently to the\r\nshampooing, the soaping, and the cleansing, are various. The most useful\r\nis the simple shower bath, with a very large rose, and amply supplied\r\nwith water through a regulating valve. It is employed for thoroughly\r\ncleansing the bather before he enters the plunge, whose waters are for\r\nthe common use of all. In many small baths its place is efficiently\r\ntaken by an ordinary hand rose or spray of the kind shown at Fig. 15.\r\nThe shower proper is usually fixed above the \"needle\" bath, as at Fig.\r\n14, or formed by a continuation of the \"backbone\" of the needle. It is\r\nbest to have separate regulating valves for the needle and shower, as at\r\nFig. 16; but at Fig. 14 it is shown with a branch from the pipe\r\nconducting to the needle, and with stop cocks. The needle-bath is a\r\nskeleton-like structure having a large hollow backbone and branching\r\nribs. The water ascends the backbone, and, passing into the ribs,\r\nsquirts out of small holes punctured in their internal circumferences.\r\nThe bather stands in the centre of the apparatus, with the ribs\r\nencircling him. The ribs should be of 1/2-in. copper piping, the\r\nbackbone and lesser supports being of iron, 2-1/2 and 1-1/2 in. diameter\r\nrespectively. In a convenient position for the attendant must be placed\r\nthe regulating valve.\r\n\r\nA more elaborate contrivance may be made, which will include needle,\r\nshower, ascending shower, spinal douche, and back shower; but this\r\nshould be left for hydropathic institutions and invalids. Simplicity in\r\nthese matters should be the great desideratum. The above-named\r\nadditions, however, may be briefly described. At Fig. 14 I have\r\nindicated the position of ascending shower. It would be connected with\r\nthe pipe supplying needle and shower, and have a stop-cock. The spinal\r\ndouche is a little nozzle behind the shower proper, and should have\r\nsimilar connection with the supply-pipe. The back shower or spinal\r\nspray would be a rose placed about half-way up the iron backbone, and be\r\nconnected in the same manner. Avoid these complications in a bath for\r\nhealthy persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.\r\n\r\nA Needle Bath.]\r\n\r\nThe needle bath is best left exposed, but it may be enclosed in a metal\r\nshield if desired. This bath may be placed in one of three\r\npositions--(1) in the shampooing room, (2) in a separate chamber, (3) in\r\nthe plunge bath chamber. It is most conveniently placed where the bather\r\npasses it _en route_ from the washing room to the plunge. For this\r\nappliance a good head of water is absolutely essential, as with a low\r\npressure it is very ineffective. The illustration shows the bath\r\nstanding on iron shoes. If fixed in a corner, as ordinarily, it can be\r\nsecured to the wall by such cramps or brackets as may be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.\r\n\r\nSpray, Wave, and Douche Baths.]\r\n\r\nBesides the needle and shower, as above, the tonic bathing appliances\r\nmay include an ordinary horizontal douche that can be pointed in any\r\ndirection, a spray, or large rose, and a \"wave.\" These three appliances\r\nmay be placed together as at Fig. 15. They are connected to the pipes\r\nfrom the regulating valves by means of a foot or so of flexible hose. To\r\nthis is secured a tapering copper pipe. The douche has a gunmetal\r\nnozzle. It is directed against the back and spine, but must not be used\r\nupon the head or chest. With a good head of water this is a most\r\npowerful appliance, feeling more like a rod of some solid substance\r\npressing against one than a stream of water. The \"wave\" is formed by a\r\ncopper spreader. The spray is simply a large rose, 6 in. or 8 in.\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.\r\n\r\nRegulating Valves for Needle, Douche, &c.]\r\n\r\nIt may be found convenient to arrange the valves for the whole of the\r\nabove-mentioned appliances together, as at Fig. 16. Each pair of hot and\r\ncold handles are here brought together. These handles should be long, so\r\nas to admit of easy regulating of the temperature of the water; they\r\nmay well be 9 in. in length. The douche, wave, and spray should be kept\r\nas close as possible to the handles that regulate their temperature.\r\n\r\nI would repeat the caution that it is very necessary to beware of\r\ncomplications in these water-fittings and appliances. Some of the more\r\n\"fussy\" contrivances--as, for example, the elaborated needle bath as\r\nabove described--require so much regulating, and so many valves and\r\nstop-cocks, that it is quite an undertaking for the attendant to set\r\nthem going. Simplicity in design and construction should be observed in\r\nthis work: the pipes as few as need be; the valves as simple as\r\npossible; and the whole put together in a manner that will permit of\r\ntheir being easily examined and repaired.\r\n\r\nI have before hinted at the desirability of making some sort of\r\nprovision whereby the bather may, on entering the bath, have a warm\r\nspray or shower, of any temperature that may be agreeable to him. In\r\nhigh class baths this feature should always be provided, as it is a\r\ngreat luxury, and, moreover, to certain constitutions a necessity, thus\r\nto be able to take such a shower before entering the hot rooms, or at\r\nsuch intervals during the sojourn in these apartments as may be desired.\r\nThe proper position for this shower-bath requires some consideration.\r\nWere it only for the entering bather that it should be provided, it\r\nwould be best placed in a lobby near the entrance to the hot rooms; but\r\nas the occupants of the hot rooms may frequently desire some such\r\nshower, it must be arranged with regard to this fact. It should be\r\nconvenient for the entering bathers and for those in the bath. A small\r\nchamber entered by doors from the lobby to the tepidarium, and also from\r\nthe tepidarium itself, would be convenient. At times it may be placed in\r\na nook off the shampooing room. Wherever it be placed, the apparatus\r\nprovided for the purpose of the shower must be such as can be managed by\r\nthe bather himself, so as not to take up the time of the attendants; and\r\nfor this reason it must be capable of easy regulation, and free from\r\nliability of scalding the user, unless through gross carelessness. A\r\nvalve with one handle only must be employed, as, unless the bather has\r\nhad some practice, it is difficult to obtain this immunity from danger\r\nof scalding when two handles are used. A valve such as that shown at\r\nFig. 17 should be employed. This valve must be so designed as to supply\r\ncold, tepid, and hot water _in regular gradation_--not intermittently,\r\nas do some valves of this description. It must be so placed that any one\r\ntaking the shower may, whilst beneath the rose, be able to easily reach\r\nthe handle. The rose should not be less than 6 in. or 7 in. diameter.\r\nFig. 12 illustrates the complete fitting up of this bather's\r\nshower-bath.\r\n\r\nIn hydropathic establishments it might be an improvement to add a small\r\nfoot-bath, formed by a sinking of about 6 in. in the floor, and filled\r\nwith hot water; for physiologists tell us it is bad for invalids to\r\nenter the hot rooms with cold feet. Supply pipes, a waste, and overflow\r\nwould have to be provided for this bath, and a marble seat might be\r\nplaced round it. A marble coping and mosaic flooring would render it\r\npleasing in appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.\r\n\r\nBather's Shower Bath.]\r\n\r\nI have hereinbefore, at Fig. 4, given plan and sections of a plunge\r\nbath, and shown its water-fittings. The overflow and waste run into\r\ncast-iron drainpipes, which should be employed till outside the\r\nbuilding. On the end of the overflow pipe is screwed a gunmetal rose\r\nwith leather packing, the screw-holes being drilled into the flange of\r\npipe. For the waste I have shown a \"disc\" valve of gunmetal. This is\r\nsimilarly screwed to flange of pipe, and with leather packing. The valve\r\nis opened and closed by a movable rod. If _fixed_, it might catch the\r\ntoes of the swimmer, and for this reason it would perhaps be best to set\r\nthe valve itself back in a recess. Instead of this valve, an ordinary\r\n4-in., 5-in., or 6-in. \"plug\" waste could be employed, but it is rather\r\nclumsy on such a scale. When practicable, a screw-down valve, with wheel\r\nand spindle outside the bath, is the best means of letting out the waste\r\nwater. The supply-pipe should be connected with the main supply just\r\nafter the water meter. The valve should be of the \"screw-down\" pattern,\r\neither with a thumbscrew, wheel and spindle, or a key.\r\n\r\nIn coast towns, where a _sea-water_ plunge may be employed, a little\r\nrose on a bracket should be provided in a convenient position, for\r\ncleansing the hair from salt water.\r\n\r\nOf the lavatory fittings in the cooling room, and of the \"sanitary\"\r\nwater-fittings, it is unnecessary to speak, except to say that, in a\r\nplace devoted to the attainment of cleanliness, plumbing of this nature\r\nshould be as perfect as possible.\r\n\r\nA drinking fountain is a desirable feature in the tepidarium of a bath\r\nof any pretension. It should be placed at the coolest end of the room,\r\naffixed to a wall, and provided with a supply-pipe, waste, and tap of\r\nsome sort. The bowl is best formed of glazed earthenware.\r\n\r\nIf an ornamental fountain be required in the frigidarium, it should be\r\nof terra-cotta or modelled glazed ware, and must be provided with\r\nsupply-pipe, waste, and means of regulating the jet of water. A fountain\r\nis a very desirable addition to a cooling room, as it is restful to the\r\near, and may be made pleasant to the eye by means of flowers and plants\r\narranged around and upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLIGHTING, DECORATING, AND FURNISHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight and shade being the soul of all ornamental effect, we may well\r\nconsider first the methods of lighting the bath. As a rule, much\r\nartificial light will be required. The hot rooms, being often in a\r\nbasement, are as a rule but feebly illumined from areas and the like.\r\nSeeing that purity of atmosphere in these apartments is of so vital\r\nimportance, the method of artificial lighting adopted should not be such\r\nas impregnates the air with obnoxious and harmful, if unnoticeable,\r\nfumes. Gas, for this reason, used in the ordinary manner, is\r\nobjectionable, as the ventilation being by means of low-level exits for\r\nthe foul air, the products of combustion must of necessity pass by and\r\nenvelop persons below the burners, though, of course, in a diluted\r\nstate. Should, therefore, gas-lighting be employed in a sudatory\r\nchamber, it should for preference be on one of those systems whereby the\r\nburner is cut off from the atmosphere of the room, and provision made\r\nfor carrying off the fumes. Happily, the use of electric lighting is at\r\nlast increasing with marked rapidity; and the incandescent light is\r\nadmirably adapted for all purposes of the Turkish bath. Where it can\r\npossibly be adopted it is a great addition to a bath.\r\n\r\nFor cooling room purposes gas is not so objectionable, except that it is\r\nheating, and assists in vitiating the atmosphere. But inasmuch as the\r\nfumes in this case will ascend with the general body of air, the\r\nobjection to gas is much lessened in these apartments. Nevertheless, the\r\nelectric light is the illuminant to be coveted.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the lighting in the cooling room should be toned and\r\nsoftened. It is not a place for brilliant general illumination, but\r\nrather for a soft light pervading the whole, and auxiliary lights where\r\nrequired, such as near couches, &c.--a system, in fact, diametrically\r\nopposed to sun-burner illumination. Nothing more objectionable of its\r\nkind can well be imagined than a glaring light in the ceiling of a\r\ncooling room. It would be found intolerable.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes, the greatest amount of light required in any\r\npart of a frigidarium is that at the heads of the couches, where it must\r\nbe of such strength as will admit of comfortable reading. One\r\ngas-burner, or one small incandescent lamp, to every two couches is a\r\nfair allowance. If effect be desired, there is, of course, much in the\r\ndistribution of the illuminating agent that affects for good or evil,\r\nand the placing and the relative powers of the lamps or burners must be\r\nconsidered. The dominant point of light might be a prettily-designed\r\nlantern with a few brilliant points of colour in it, depending from a\r\nchain over a fountain, throwing its rays downwards on to the falling\r\nwaters, and _not_ in the eyes of those bathers who may be reclining upon\r\nthe couches.\r\n\r\nThroughout the bath, in either natural or artificial lighting, by\r\nwindows or lamps, it should be the aim not to throw strong light in the\r\neyes of the bather--a principle of universal application, but especially\r\nto be regarded in a place where, more often than not, the occupants of\r\nthe various apartments are reclining, _face upwards_, on benches or\r\ncouches. In the hot rooms, as in the cooling room, little general\r\nillumination is required. A bright artificial light in such places seems\r\nespecially painful to the eyes. What light, therefore, may be provided\r\nin the sudatory chambers, should be as diffused as possible, the\r\nadditional lights for the few who practise reading in these apartments\r\nbeing so arranged as not to be objectionable to the majority of bathers.\r\nThe lights should be shaded so as to throw their rays downwards in a\r\nvery small compass.\r\n\r\nConsiderably more light is required in the lavatoria and shampooing\r\nrooms. In scheming the plan of bath rooms in a basement, where daylight\r\ncan only be obtained at one point, it is desirable, if practicable, to\r\narrange the shampooing room so that it may enjoy the benefit of this\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nFor effect, the scale of lighting in the bath rooms may be a rather dark\r\nlaconicum, and a gradually-increased amount of light from thence to the\r\nshampooing room. The plunge-bath chamber should be well lighted, but not\r\nabove the tone of the frigidarium, or the bather will feel to be going\r\nfrom cheerfulness to comparative gloom, which would be unpleasant. A\r\nbright, warm light should be that in the plunge-bath chamber, with\r\nperhaps an ornamental lamp over the bath itself; and if the\r\nintermediary staircase--should there be such a feature--be lighted on a\r\nlower scale, the effect on entering the frigidarium will be a cheerful\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECORATING.\r\n\r\nUnder this heading, I would speak of the means of obtaining effect in a\r\nbath, of the materials to be employed, and of the design of features--of\r\nthe effect of the whole and the proportions of its parts, rather than of\r\nanything implying the _laying on_ of so-called ornament.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of a bath is _interior architecture_ as distinct from\r\nthat involving external work. Much of this, moreover, can often only be\r\nseen by artificial light. These two restrictions point to the\r\nemployment, for the most part, of surface decoration, rather than of\r\nmodelling--of tiles, mosaics, marbles, in place of mouldings, cornices,\r\nand pilasters.\r\n\r\nThere are three features of the bath that are fit subjects for handsome\r\ndesigning, and they are the frigidarium, the tepidarium, and the plunge\r\nbath. There is an excuse for elaborating the first two, in that these\r\nare the apartments in which the bather remains the longest time; and as\r\nfor the plunge, it is in itself an object capable of giving a very\r\npleasing effect. Over-elaboration--in respect to added ornament--in the\r\nhot rooms, however, gives an air of incongruity. Simplicity, with good\r\nproportions, seems here the most pleasing. The general effect of the hot\r\nrooms should be light, a statement which is wholly in harmony with what\r\nI have said on their lighting, though it may not at first sight appear\r\nto be so. The tone of the ceilings and walls and floors should be light,\r\nthe darkest portions being a dado. A generally dark and heavy tone of\r\ncolouring is very oppressive in a sudatory chamber. Keep them light:\r\nlight ceilings of plaster for cheap baths, and of lightly decorated,\r\nlarge, thin tiles, or lightly-tinted enamelled iron, for more expensive\r\nestablishments; light walls of white, ivory, cream, or buff glazed\r\nbricks, without startling bands of a vulgar, as distinct from a really\r\nbold, contrast; and mosaic floors of a light filling-in and not too dark\r\npattern. The risers to marble-topped benches may be of another tone, but\r\nnot too dark; and, in place of a dado of bare glazed bricks, it is\r\nperhaps best to stretch Indian matting to keep the bather from the\r\nburning wall, as at Fig. 20. This will necessitate fillets affixed to\r\nplugs in the brickwork. Woodwork looks best dark and polished, affording\r\nan agreeable contrast to the lighter materials.\r\n\r\nBright points of colour may be obtained by stained glass in\r\nceiling-lights or windows, and at night by coloured glass shades over\r\nlamps, &c.\r\n\r\nThe use of iron joists with glazed brick arches between is not to be\r\nrecommended for the ceilings of the hot rooms. To say the least, it is a\r\nheavy-looking arrangement. Enamelled iron may be made to look very well\r\nif affixed in sheets of delicate tint with light patterns, and affixed\r\nwith \"buttons\" with enamelled heads to the fireproof floors, as at Fig.\r\n18. Large thin tiles make an admirable ceiling for small baths. They\r\nmay be fixed with ornamental wood fillets, or made with screw-holes and\r\naffixed to ceiling joists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.\r\n\r\nSection and Plan of an Enamelled Iron Ceiling.]\r\n\r\nGlazed brickwork for the walls of hot rooms, &c., should be specified to\r\nbe executed with an extra neat joint, and should bond to less than 12\r\nin. to the foot; otherwise the effect of the unwieldy mortar joints is\r\nclumsy. This applies equally to walling and to arches and vaults. Work\r\nwhich may pass as fair in ordinary cases, looks coarse and rough in the\r\nglazed interior walls of a bath. In selecting glazed bricks there is\r\nsome difficulty in obtaining really delicate tints; much of the work\r\nproduced is unfortunately of a very crude colouring.\r\n\r\nOne portion of the tepidarium, and other bath rooms, admits of being\r\nrendered very attractive; and that is the flooring. Mosaic work is\r\nalways pleasing, if it be designed with taste and executed artistically.\r\nMarble and tile mosaics are both good, the former admitting of a\r\nrichness of effect quite its own, and the latter of brilliant colouring.\r\nIn designing marble-mosaic floors, however, one may well fight shy of\r\nincluding that senseless, purposeless description which is nowadays so\r\noften employed as a filling-in between borders. I refer to the\r\nheterogeneous jumble of every colour mixed without regard to one\r\nanother, and giving at a distance a dirty grey tone, and near at hand an\r\neffect like a gravel walk covered with faded cherry-blossom--to be\r\nflattering. Despite the fact that this method of design is of antique\r\norigin, and has a real classical designation, I cannot but think that it\r\nis to be avoided, and that fillings-in should be made with tesseræ of\r\none tint, or that mosaic should be abandoned altogether.\r\n\r\nGiven the means, it is easy to render a set of bath rooms elaborate,\r\nwith faïence and modelled glazed ware, marbles and painted encaustic\r\ntiles, and many other suitable but expensive materials; but for my own\r\npart I prefer to see comparative simplicity in a sudatory chamber,\r\nthough by this I do not mean monastic severity of style.\r\n\r\nThe general air of the frigidarium requires some consideration. It\r\nshould have an effect of its own, quite distinct from anything else. It\r\nshould have something of the conservatory in it. It should be richly\r\ncarpeted, have much woodwork about it, and be pleasant with plants and\r\nladen with the murmur of falling waters. It should be light, certainly;\r\ncheerful, cool, and airy looking; and as lofty as possible within reason\r\nand common sense. The ceiling should be of a light tone. A lantern-light\r\nwhere the light may come in, rather than be seen, and where the vitiated\r\nair may go out, is a pleasant and useful addition.\r\n\r\nPoints for emphasising with a view to ultimate effect are the stairs to\r\nhot rooms--if a staircase be needed--the divans or screens for couches,\r\nand an ornamental fountain as above described. The staircase may be\r\nrendered attractive with bowl newels, and perhaps white marble treads to\r\nthe stairs. The divans may be rendered things of beauty by designing\r\nornamental, open-work wood partitions, in either an Oriental style or\r\notherwise. It is not easy to make small dwarf partitions, enclosing a\r\ncouple of couches, look handsome. As a rule, they are of a flimsy and\r\ngimcrack order of architecture. They should be made as solid as\r\npossible. For effect there is nothing better than prettily-designed\r\ndivans.\r\n\r\nAs regards style, I do not see why one method of design should be more\r\nsuited than another for the bath. Having become popularly known as the\r\n\"Turkish\" bath, an Eastern or Saracenic style has been often adopted in\r\nthe past. And, inasmuch as such style is essentially an interior style\r\nof architecture, there is something to be said on this score. It is,\r\nmoreover, a style in which surface decoration pertains rather than\r\nmodelled work, or, at least, the modelling is in very low relief. There\r\nis yet ample scope for the display of skill in the design of a bath in\r\nan Oriental style, as hitherto such attempts have only been made in a\r\nhalf-hearted manner; and in many smaller commercial baths the unskilful\r\nuse of the style has vulgarised it to no small extent.[3]\r\n\r\nConsidering that the old Romans brought the bath to a great pitch of\r\nexcellence--far, very far, I should be inclined to say, in advance of\r\nour present knowledge of the subject--their style of architecture would\r\nseem fitted to its design at this day; and for large public baths,\r\nlarger than any yet erected in this country, one can imagine that a very\r\ninteresting design could be made in the Roman style, founded on a study\r\nof the old baths, and, for the sake of the interest attaching to them,\r\nreproducing many of the original mosaics, pictures, details, &c., of the\r\npublic baths of the time of the Empire. In a like manner in the Moorish\r\nstyle one could obtain a very elegant effect by a careful study of old\r\nbaths in Eastern countries,[4] drawing, perhaps, some inspiration from\r\nthe courts of the palaces of the Moors, with their pleasant retired air,\r\nfor the frigidarium. I have often thought, when looking at the late Owen\r\nJones' splendid model at the Crystal Palace, what an admirable\r\nfrigidarium the Court of the Lions would make, with its spacious\r\ncentral area, and retired nooks suitable for couches, and its pretty\r\nsparkling fountain and green plants, its brilliant colouring, and\r\ngeneral cheerfulness of effect. Similarly, in a Roman style, a Pompeian\r\ncourt seems suggestive of the arrangement of a fine frigidarium, with\r\nits _cubicula_ for couches, and its central area and fountain.\r\n\r\nThe above are but theoretical suggestions as to what might be done\r\nshould the bath make such progress in this country as may necessitate\r\nthe provision of handsome public baths for the people. In everyday\r\npractice there is not a great field for elaborate designing in baths.\r\nAlthough only the Roman and Eastern styles have been mentioned, there\r\ncan be no manner of reason why an architect should not design his bath\r\nin whatsoever style he may please.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the plunge bath as a feature capable of being rendered\r\na thing of beauty. This is in reference as much to its plan as to the\r\nmaterials of the sides and floor, &c. There is no reason why a plunge\r\nshould always be a plain oblong on plan. It may be of any of the shapes\r\nindicated at Fig. 19. Many bathers, especially in warm weather, like to\r\nstay some minutes in the plunge, and not go straight through; they may\r\nlike to swim up and down the bath, and thus require room to turn, and a\r\nkeyhole plan, such as at A, is suitable, and especially useful where the\r\nbather has to return to the end of bath he entered. Another shape is\r\nshown at B. In ladies' baths still more margin for novel planning is\r\nallowable, as here the true dive seldom pertains. A delicate semi-oval\r\nplan, such as that at D, which is much after the pattern of the Roman\r\nbath recently discovered at Box, could be employed; or a plain, circular\r\nbath with steps around, such as that of the Pompeian _Balneum_, shown at\r\nC; or, again, such a plan as that at E, after the classic one at Bognor\r\nin Sussex. For inspirations as to the plans of plunge baths, we cannot\r\ndo better than refer direct to the old Roman remains, either in Italy\r\nitself, or in Great Britain and other provinces and colonial\r\ndependencies of the old Empire. The Romans were fully alive to the\r\npossibilities of the plunge bath as a subject for artistic design, and\r\noften produced baths of great beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.\r\n\r\nPlans of Plunge Baths.]\r\n\r\nThe flooring and sides of these baths should be of a light tint, and\r\nthere should always be more or less pure white. Nothing really is better\r\nthan plain white glazed bricks, with neat joints. With this bottom the\r\nwater always looks clean when it is clean, and shows contamination when\r\nit exists. Marble-mosaic floorings should be chiefly of white tesseræ,\r\nany simple patterns being executed in light tints. Delicate tints, such\r\nas strawberry, pea green, and peacock blue, look well through the water.\r\nThe floor of the plunge bath may thus be made very pretty. The sides are\r\nbest of glazed brickwork, neatly executed, and coping and treads of\r\nsteps of so-called white marble.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURNISHING.\r\n\r\nThe work of the upholsterer in fitting up a Turkish bath comprises the\r\ncomplete furnishing of the cooling room with couches, lounges, ottomans,\r\ncarpets, mats, and any chairs and tables that may be required, besides\r\nthe usual furniture common to all rooms. In the sudatory chambers may be\r\nrequired easy chairs of peculiar construction, with stretched canvas\r\nseats; in some cases movable wooden benches in lieu of fixed\r\nmarble-topped ones; and any carpeting, matting, felt for benches,\r\ncurtains (if any), and Indian matting for dadoes. These are the\r\nprincipal requirements that need consideration, the remaining furnishing\r\nof subordinate apartments being, of course, of commonplace and ordinary\r\ndescription. The refreshment department requires possibly a\r\ncoffee-maker, refrigerator, ice-box, and shelf fittings; but, as a\r\ngeneral rule, no arrangements for actual cooking.\r\n\r\nThe cooling room couches are usually made 6 ft. by 2 ft.; but 6 ft. 6\r\nin. by 2 ft. 6 in. is a more liberal allowance. They should be made of\r\npolished wood, strongly framed, stuffed with horsehair and covered with\r\na red Turkey twill, as at A, Fig. 21. Where divans are adopted, on the\r\nEastern model, the benches must be framed of wood, permanently fixed,\r\nand covered with mattresses kept in their places by a wooden fillet, as\r\nFig. 20. Above the couch thus formed it is well to stretch a dado of\r\nIndian matting, affixed above to a moulded rail.\r\n\r\nThe carpets employed in the cooling room should be soft to the tread.\r\nNothing, of course, equals a Persian or Turkey carpet, and one or the\r\nother should be provided when their cost can be afforded. A rich carpet\r\nadds greatly to the effect of the room. In cases where a polished wood\r\nfloor is adopted and shown, soft durable matting or strips of carpet\r\nmust be placed along any routes, such as from and to the hot rooms and\r\nthe boot-room, by the sides of couches, to lounges and tables,\r\n&c.--anywhere, in fact, where the bather may require to tread. Anything\r\nin the nature of fastenings likely, by any possibility, to injure the\r\nfeet, must be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nA table or two for books, papers, magazines, &c., should be provided in\r\nthe cooling room. The provision of lounges, &c., must depend upon the\r\ndesign of the room, and whether nooks or angles are available for their\r\naccommodation. Little wooden or metal tripod tables must be placed by\r\nthe heads of the couches (Fig. 21, B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.\r\n\r\nSection of Benches in Hot Rooms and in Cooling Room Divans.]\r\n\r\nThe chairs in the hot rooms must be designed upon some such lines as at\r\nC and D, whereat are shown an iron, and a wooden, framed chair. Beechen\r\nframes are best, and the seat formed of rather closely-woven canvas\r\nfixed at top and bottom and hanging in a curve. A few of these seats\r\nshould always be provided in the hot rooms. Movable wooden _benches_ are\r\nconstructed of beech, oak, or well-seasoned yellow deal, as at E. The\r\nhead end is best raised as shown. Very carefully-seasoned wood should be\r\nemployed, for all joinery purposes, in the hot rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the boot room, the pigeon-holes must not be forgotten, and a\r\ncushioned seat, perhaps, for taking off boots and shoes. A shelf or\r\nshelves for linen checks is useful in this position.\r\n\r\nSometimes the floor of the calidarium is carpeted all over, but _strips_\r\nof matting or carpet are better. The hot laconicum is best carpeted\r\nthroughout. The tepidarium should have strips of carpet where the\r\nbathers must necessarily tread. In some baths it is the custom to\r\nprovide, instead of carpet, felt sandals for use in the hot rooms. For\r\nsimilar reasons to the carpeting--the non-conduction of heat--fine white\r\nfelting is sometimes placed in strips along the marble benches, as at\r\nFig. 20. Of the Indian matting for a portion of the walls above the\r\nbenches, I have already spoken.\r\n\r\nIn the shampooing rooms, little blocks of wood shaped as at E, Fig. 5,\r\nare required as head-rests. They should be about 12 by 5 by 4 in., and\r\nhollowed to fit the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.\r\n\r\nFurniture of a Turkish Bath.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I do not know of any building--bath or otherwise, civil or\r\ndomestic--in this country where the true spirit of Oriental colour\r\ndecoration has been grasped. One of the chief principles which seems to\r\nhave been missed is that in real Saracenic art the colours are employed\r\nin very small portions only, and no colour becomes insubordinate to the\r\ngeneral effect.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Here is a branch of architectural design absolutely\r\nunstudied. Few architects visit the East, and none enter the baths\r\nthere, either in Egypt, Turkey, or Morocco. The ordeal of the true\r\nOriental shampooing doubtless deters the few who might be curious about\r\nthese buildings.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE BATHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Turkish bath in the house may be designed on any scale, from a\r\nsingle room heated to the required temperature by a common laundry\r\nstove, to an elaborate suite of apartments, providing all that is found\r\nin the public bath, and even added luxuries. It may be an addition to an\r\nexisting building or a feature designed at one and the same time as the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many expedients for producing perspiration by\r\nheated air much simpler than by the special construction of a suite of\r\nbath rooms; but as they will be familiar to all studying the subject of\r\nbaths, I will pass them over here as mere makeshifts. For although there\r\nis something to be said in their favour, in that the head is free and\r\none can breathe cooler air, there are serious objections to their use,\r\nas the lamps employed _burn the air_, and there is also an absence of\r\nthat rapid aërial circulation which is so much to be desired. Besides\r\nthe actual objections to their use, more or less inconvenience attends\r\nthe employment of the sheet and lamp (or cabinet and lamp) baths, and\r\nthere is little of the luxury of a true sudatorium about the\r\nextemporised bath, admirable as it may be as a hydropathic expedient.\r\n\r\nThe bath in the house may consist of one of the following\r\narrangements:--(1) A single room used as a sudatory chamber and for\r\nwashing; (2) a hot room and a washing room; (3) a combined hot room and\r\nwashing room, and a cooling room; (4) a cooling room, washing room, and\r\nhot room; or (5) a suite of chambers of such extent as to provide every\r\npossible luxury, such as even the old Roman gentlemen would have\r\ncoveted. Where there is no second room the bather must use his bed room\r\nas a cooling and reposing room, as he must also in the cases where only\r\na washing room and a hot room are provided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.\r\n\r\nPlan of Mr. Urquhart's Small Private Bath and of the Hot Room at Sir\r\nErasmus Wilson's Bath at Richmond Hill.]\r\n\r\nFor a simple sudatory chamber, where washing operations are also\r\nconducted, all that is required is a room with brick walls and fire- and\r\nheat-proof floor and ceiling, with an adjoining lobby, a flue to conduct\r\nsmoke from a simple stove, and a sunk washing tank or _lavatrina_.\r\nAllowance must be made for a couch opposite the stove. Fig. 22 (A)\r\nshows the simplest form of a bath room possible; it is that which Mr.\r\nUrquhart constructed, and has described in his 'Manual of the Turkish\r\nBath.' It was erected by him to show how cheaply an effective bath room\r\nmight be built, the whole arrangement, with water fittings and building\r\nof three of its walls, only costing 37_l._\r\n\r\nThe room or rooms forming the Turkish bath in a private house should be\r\ncut off by a lobby from the other apartments of the house, with\r\ncarefully-fitting self-closing doors at either end; and in the case of\r\nan elaborate bath, another little lobby with double doors and heavy\r\ncurtains, should be placed between the cooling room and the two bathing\r\nrooms, as at Fig. 24. The air of the hot rooms should, of course, be\r\nperfectly and absolutely cut off from that of the house.\r\n\r\nThe position of the bath in a house will depend upon the size of the\r\nbath and the house and its situation. In town houses, where the bath\r\nconsists of only a washing and a hot room, the first floor will be the\r\nmost convenient. Where a cooling room is provided, the ground floor is\r\nas handy as anywhere; and this position allows of the easier\r\nconstruction of the heating apparatus. In the country, the bath is best\r\nbuilt away from the house, connected by a short lobby, which may be\r\nutilised for boots, &c., as at Fig. 24. The main difficulties to be\r\novercome are the heating of the bath, and the non-conduction of heat to\r\nplaces where it is not wanted.\r\n\r\nThe heating apparatus of a private bath may be, for the simplest, a\r\ncommon laundry stove, as at Fig. 22 (A) and at Fig. 23; for bigger\r\nbaths, a small convoluted stove, as at Fig. 24; or a furnace of\r\nfirebrick with an iron flue, as at B, Fig. 22--a plan of the hot room\r\n(15 ft. by 12 ft.) of the bath which Sir Erasmus Wilson built at\r\nRichmond Hill. For elaborate baths, a small furnace wholly constructed\r\nof fireclay, such as that of which I have given complete plans in the\r\nchapter on \"Heating and Ventilation,\" would be the best. A furnace of\r\nthis description is shown in the design for an elaborate private bath,\r\nat Fig. 25. Should the bath be heated regularly every day, a firebrick\r\nfurnace is certainly the best, as such furnaces retain their heat a long\r\ntime. It should be \"banked\" at night. A bath only required at times, and\r\nquickly, is best heated with a thin iron stove. A portable iron stove\r\nand a long length of iron flue will rapidly raise the temperature. The\r\nsimple baths illustrated at Figs. 22 (A) and 23, are therefore very\r\nconvenient and effective. The principle of heating by the transmission\r\nto the hot rooms of freshly-heated air is also a very convenient one for\r\nprivate purposes, as on this system the bath may be on an upper floor,\r\nand yet have its heating apparatus conveniently stowed away below, as at\r\nFig. 24. A small furnace chamber, such as that at Fig. 6, _ante_, must\r\nbe constructed, and a hot-air flue of large section built up to the hot\r\nroom. If the bath be on the ground floor, the construction of any form\r\nof heating apparatus is rendered easier.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the transmission of heat to other apartments of the house,\r\nthe precautions hereinbefore mentioned must be observed. Hollow walls\r\nmust be provided round the heated chambers, to prevent loss of heat on\r\nthe external side, and the transmission of heat through internal walls.\r\nThe floors above and below should--if not of solid fireproof\r\nconstruction--be formed as described in the section dealing with the\r\ndesign of the sudorific chambers, with puggings of slag-wool, asbestos,\r\nsawdust, or materials having similar properties. Windows should be\r\ndouble. Wherever possible, concrete floors should be provided to the hot\r\nrooms and washing rooms, so that they may be covered with tiles or\r\nmosaics, and on account of the spilling of water. It should be needless\r\nto point out the necessity of having most careful regard to safety from\r\nfire by the stoves or furnaces.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation of private baths should receive as much careful\r\nattention as those for public use. The hollow external walls may often\r\nbe used with advantage for the extraction of the vitiated air, which\r\nmust be let into the cavity at the floor level. If the bath be\r\nconstructed on the ground floor, with nothing beneath, the system of\r\ncarrying off the vitiated air by horizontal conduits--recommended for\r\npublic baths--should be employed, as in the accompanying design for a\r\nlarge private bath, where the whole of the foul air is drawn into one\r\nvertical shaft of sufficiently wide section. Much that I have said on\r\nthe heating and ventilation, and, indeed, on many matters in connection\r\nwith the design of public baths, applies in the case of the private one,\r\nand the reader is therefore referred to preceding pages for many hints\r\nas to its construction.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying figures I have endeavoured to explain the\r\narrangement and construction of private baths, from those formed by\r\nconverting existing rooms into bath rooms, to an elaborate and complete\r\ndesign. Fig. 22 (A) is a plan of Mr. Urquhart's cheap private bath, an\r\napartment only measuring 11 ft. by 16 ft., yet forming an effective\r\nsudatory chamber, with simple iron stove, couch, seat, and sunk tank or\r\nlavatrina. On this principle I have arranged the plans of the baths\r\nadapted to existing rooms in a house, shown at Fig. 23. One plan shows a\r\nhot room built on to an existing ordinary bath room. A doorway is formed\r\nin the old external wall, and the new chamber constructed with hollow\r\nwalls, with glazed bricks internally. An extra room would, of course, be\r\nthus formed on the floor below. A fireproof floor would be provided, and\r\nthe pipes from iron stove conducted to old fireplace in bath room, which\r\nwould become the lavatorium, and undressing room if necessary. A\r\ndouble-doored lobby is formed in the latter apartment, and the slipper\r\nbath used as ordinarily. It will be seen that by appropriating the\r\nadjoining bed room, a frigidarium is obtained, by taking away the\r\nflue-pipe to a new chimney, and knocking a doorway through the old\r\npartition wall, thus making a complete set of bath rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.\r\n\r\nMethods of constructing Turkish Baths in existing Houses.]\r\n\r\nThe other plan, given at Fig. 23, shows an existing room divided into a\r\ncombined hot room and washing room, and a cooling room. Three of the\r\nwalls being ordinary external walls, the hot room is lined with lath and\r\nplaster on quartering, leaving an air-space between to prevent loss of\r\nheat by absorption and radiation. One or two of the spaces between the\r\nquarters should be formed into lath and plaster flues, for the\r\nwithdrawal of the vitiated air, being connected below with the hot room,\r\nand above lead into the open air. A pugged partition and double-doored\r\nlobby separate the rooms. Space is left in the hot room for a\r\nfull-length couch opposite the radiating stove, which has a metal screen\r\naround to protect the more adjacent walls from the heat. A lavatrina is\r\nprovided, as shown at the enlarged section. A nook is formed for a\r\nshower. This recess could be fitted with enamelled iron screen and hood,\r\nas at the end of elaborate slipper-baths. A couple of couches, lavatory,\r\nand toilet table are compactly arranged in the little frigidarium.\r\n\r\nWhere these plain iron radiating stoves are employed, the fresh air\r\nshould be admitted as near the stove as possible, and if the inlet be\r\nconnected with a space formed round the stove by a sheet-iron jacket,\r\nthe air will enter the room at a considerably raised temperature. The\r\ntemperature of the incoming air in a bath where the heat radiates\r\ndirectly from the stove or furnace to the body of the bather, is not a\r\nmatter of such vital importance as it is in cases where the heat is\r\ntransmitted through the agency of the air itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\n\r\nA complete Private Turkish Bath.]\r\n\r\nCost of construction being now so constant a factor in every\r\nconsideration, I have been led to give the above plans and descriptions\r\nof cheaply-formed baths as suggestions for the adaptation of other\r\nrooms. But plans of more elaborate baths are occasionally required, and\r\nat Fig. 24 I give the plan and cross section of a bath constructed as an\r\nappendage to, and at one and the same time as, the house. In this plan\r\nall necessaries are liberally provided for, but there is no extravagant\r\noutlay on elaboration of features and decoration. It is arranged on the\r\nfirst floor of a projecting wing off the main building. The frigidarium\r\nis cut off from the corridor or landing of the house by a lobby, which\r\nprovides a w.c. and a space for boots and shoes and linen and towels.\r\nBetween the frigidarium and bath rooms is a double-doored lobby of a\r\nkind that is very useful in both public and private baths. Hung with\r\nheavy curtains over the inner face of either door, it forms a perfect\r\npreventive against the entry of the air of the hot rooms into the\r\ncooling room. Between the combined tepidarium and lavatorium and the\r\nlaconicum is a glazed partition with a doorway, fitted with a curtain if\r\nnecessary. The walls are 18 in.--9 in. and 4-1/2 in., with 4-1/2 in.\r\ncavity, used for ventilation. The bath rooms are lined with glazed\r\nbrickwork. The floor is of fireproof, iron and concrete, construction.\r\nEnamelled iron sheets are screwed to the ceiling joists in the hot\r\nrooms, and pugging placed over. Under the laconicum is the stokery and\r\nfurnace chamber, fitted with a small convoluted stove, a hot-air shaft\r\nleading to the bath room. Fresh air comes to the stove by horizontal\r\nflues from either side of the building. The windows in the bath rooms\r\nare double. In the laconicum are two felt-covered wooden benches, as at\r\nFig. 21 (E), _ante_, and a similar bench occupies one side of\r\nlavatorium, opposite which is the lavatrina, 18 in. deep, partly sunk\r\ninto the floor and partly raised. The shower should be placed over this.\r\nIn the frigidarium are two couches, hooks for clothes, lavatory, and\r\ntoilet tables, &c. This would be a very effective plan for a comfortable\r\nprivate bath.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary \"slipper,\" \"length,\" or \"shallow\" bath is out of place in\r\nthe rooms of a Turkish bath; but where the bath has to be adapted with\r\neconomy to an existing bath room, as at Fig. 23, and in cases where,\r\nsay, some members of a family take the Turkish bath and others the\r\nordinary warm bath, it may remain as at the last-named figure, and serve\r\nthe purposes of a lavatrina. The lavatrina, as designed in the plan of\r\nthe large Turkish bath appended, however, is the most convenient\r\napparatus to facilitate the orthodox method of lathering and washing\r\noneself in this style of bathing, as distinct from the ordinary method\r\nof immersion in a large body of water; and as the former manner is the\r\nmost economical of water, it is unnecessary, in providing a Turkish bath\r\nin a house, to make any increased provision for the supply of hot and\r\ncold water over and above that which would be allowed for an ordinary\r\nslipper-bath.\r\n\r\nIn a private bath the lavatorium will also serve the purpose of a\r\ntepidarium. This chamber should therefore be as large as possible. In it\r\nmay be required a shampooing slab, and, possibly, a small plunge bath,\r\nin addition to the lavatrina, reclining-bench, and what water fittings\r\nare to be provided. All that will be required are hot and cold water\r\ntaps over the edge of the lavatrina, which should also have a waste and\r\noverflow. Having to be worked by the bather himself, the shower\r\narrangement should be such as shown at Fig. 17, _ante_. This will serve\r\nall purposes, unless a douche and a needle are desired, when the\r\nregulating valve of this appliance must be placed conveniently within\r\nthe bather's reach while standing in the bath.\r\n\r\nThe private bather, unless he can afford to engage a bath-man, must look\r\nupon shampooing as a _luxury_ but not a _necessity_ of the bath. Dr. W.\r\nJ. Fleming, in a lecture on the \"Physiology of Turkish Baths,\" read\r\nbefore the Glasgow Physiological Society some years back, said that the\r\naccessories of shampooing, &c., are, despite the popular opinion to the\r\ncontrary, non-essential. A shampooing slab--which must be of marble--is\r\ntherefore not a necessary provision in any but very elaborate private\r\nbaths.\r\n\r\nA complete private bath must contain the _piscina_, or plunge. Unless\r\nspace and expense be no object, this cannot well be made capable of\r\naffording a vigorous dive; but endeavours should be made to secure a\r\nbath of such dimensions as will admit of a refreshing immersion of the\r\nwhole body. It will be constructed and fitted exactly as a small public\r\nplunge bath.\r\n\r\nThe frigidarium of a private bath should be as pleasant, cheerful, and\r\ncomfortable as possible. It should be a cosy place where the bather may\r\nrecline and cool, and smoke and read, or otherwise divert himself to his\r\nheart's content. If so preferred, it might be arranged like an Eastern\r\ndivan; or it might be a simple, homely room, fitted with one or two\r\ncomfortable couches. A fireplace may here be a desirable feature, for\r\nappearance sake, during the winter months. The room should be _really_\r\nventilated--viz. well supplied with pure, fresh air, and with effective\r\nmeans of withdrawing the vitiated atmosphere, since, as I have pointed\r\nout in the chapters on public baths, the cooling process is, in its way,\r\nas important as the heating, it being essential that the bather should\r\nexpose the whole surface of his skin to volumes of pure cool air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.\r\n\r\nDESIGN FOR A PRIVATE TURKISH BATH\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL SECTION.]\r\n\r\nAt Fig. 25, pages 130 and 131, I give plans of a large private Turkish\r\nbath. It is such a building as would be a most desirable and pleasing\r\naddition to a country mansion; and considering the money prodigally\r\nlavished over the appurtenances of the modern mansion house, it is\r\nindeed surprising that more has not been attempted in the way of\r\nappending a feature that is at once a talisman of health, a cure for\r\ndisease, and an untold luxury. The public bath may be a blessing, but\r\nfor comfort and luxury it cannot compare with the well-appointed private\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Design for a Private Turkish Bath.]\r\n\r\nThe design I give as a suggestion, to be modified and adapted to any\r\nstyle of design. The building could be connected to the house by a\r\ncorridor, or by a glazed _xystos_, either abutting on to the main wall\r\nof house or a little detached. Off the lobby to the frigidarium are\r\nrecesses for boots and for linen. The frigidarium--about 15 ft.\r\nsquare--has benches fitted up like one side of a divan, bay windows with\r\nspace for plants and flowers, lavatory and toilet-table, and an\r\nornamental fountain. A lobby separates this apartment from the bath\r\nrooms, and off it are a w.c. and a towel closet, which latter could be\r\nsupplied with hot air. The combined lavatorium and tepidarium--14 ft.\r\nsquare--is a domed chamber, with semicircular recesses containing the\r\nplunge bath and lavatrina. A shampooing bench is shown. A marble dado\r\nsurrounds the walls, and marble corbels are provided to pendentives of\r\ndome--which could be of brick or terracotta and concrete--and marble\r\nspringers to horse-shoe arches. The shower is placed over the lavatrina.\r\nPlenty of space is left for a bench or chair in this chamber. Adjoining\r\nis the laconicum with a firebrick furnace, after the nature of that of\r\nwhich I have before given full detailed drawings. The vitiated air is\r\ndrawn through flues in the floor, to a shaft on the opposite side to the\r\nchimney. The stokery and coke-store adjoin the laconicum. Fresh air\r\nwould be admitted to the furnace as explained in the detailed\r\ndescription of the furnace illustrated at Fig. 10. If there were no\r\navailable supply of water from house, a boiler and tank could be placed\r\nin the stokery, and a cistern on the flat roof. The flat roof, if of\r\niron and concrete, would form an abutment to dome. If thought desirable,\r\nthe same flat roof could be carried over the combined tepidarium and\r\nlavatorium. An air space should be left between the masonry of dome and\r\ncovering of copper or other material. The lights should be double\r\nglazed. With the radiating stove there is no objection to the loftiness\r\nof the dome. This bath could be perfectly ventilated and supplied with\r\npure heat of a most hygienic character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE BATH IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bath for the hydropathic establishment will generally be required in\r\nconnection with, and--what is of greater moment--_in harmony with_,\r\nother baths, such as medicated baths, Russian or vapour baths, and the\r\nordinary douche, wave, spray, and needle baths, which, where the Turkish\r\nbath is included, may often be efficiently administered with the\r\nappliances usually provided in the shampooing and washing room.\r\nMoreover, if the establishment include the pumilio-pine treatment, or\r\nsystem of pine-therapeutics, there will be required rooms or halls for\r\nthe inhalation of dry pine and pinal vapour. The nature of the\r\ncommunication between these different baths, as the medicated, Russian,\r\n&c., and the Turkish bath, and their relative positions, must be\r\ncarefully studied. It should be compact and the various passages and\r\ncorridors as short as possible, these passages and corridors being\r\nprovided with means for maintaining them at a suitable, and uniformly\r\nequable, temperature. This latter point we do not find so carefully\r\nstudied in hydropathic establishments as its importance would warrant.\r\nThe consequence is that, in passing backwards and forwards to and from\r\nthe different bath rooms, the delicate invalid contracts a serious\r\nchill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.\r\n\r\nPlan of the Baths at the Hôtel Mont Dore, Bournemouth.]\r\n\r\nI give herewith, at Fig. 26, a plan of the baths at the Hôtel Mont Dore,\r\nat Bournemouth, which, though not confessedly a hydropathic institution,\r\nhas yet a fine bathing establishment of the hydropathic type, as well\r\nas complete arrangements for the administration of the pine cure. These\r\nbaths include a Turkish bath, with three hot rooms, a shampooing room,\r\nand cooling room, connected by an anteroom with the suite of\r\nmiscellaneous bath rooms of the gentlemen's department. The latter\r\ncomprise a room for the tonic water baths, such as the needle, douche,\r\nsitz, hip, and wave; a room or \"hall\" for the inhalation of pine vapour,\r\nwhilst in a bath of condensed steam; and a room for the administration\r\nof the Mont Dore cure, consisting of the application of pulverised Mont\r\nDore water, or spray, to the eye, nose, or ear, as may be required, this\r\nroom being also used for the inhalation of dry pine. In addition are a\r\nrange of slipper baths, in comfortably fitted bath rooms, for the\r\npurposes of electric and medicated baths, such as those of pine extract,\r\nsulphur, iodine, &c., &c., and for ordinary hot and cold spring-water\r\nand salt-water baths. In connection are arranged dressing and reposing\r\nrooms, besides necessary subsidiary apartments. A somewhat similar suite\r\nof rooms is arranged for ladies on the other side of the block. There is\r\nno separate Turkish bath, however; certain days of the week are set\r\napart exclusively for ladies' use. The steam boilers, which supply the\r\nsteam to the vapour baths and pine-vapour baths, and the water super\r\nheaters, as well as the hotel lift and pumping machinery, are arranged\r\nin a basement under the stairs, anteroom, tepidarium, and shampooing\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the compact little Turkish bath, which was arranged\r\nunder the direction of the late Mr. Charles Bartholomew, is in direct\r\ncommunication with the other baths, allowing the bather to pass from the\r\nhot rooms, or shampooing room, to medicated or pine bath, or _vice\r\nversâ_. In designing the plan of baths of the type of those at the Mont\r\nDore, this intercommunication between the various baths is the point to\r\nbe most carefully studied. Direct communication is required between the\r\nTurkish, and the Russian, bath, inhalation hall, and medicated baths, as\r\nsome methods of treatment render this an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nIn a small establishment the hydropathic appliances are movable, and\r\nused in ordinary bath rooms, the Turkish bath being the only feature\r\nrequiring special design.\r\n\r\nA true hydropathic establishment of any size should be provided with two\r\nTurkish baths, one for ladies and one for gentlemen, as the power and\r\nefficiency of the treatment may depend upon the regularity and\r\npersistency with which it is carried out. Where there is only one bath,\r\nit has to be set apart on different days for the use of ladies and\r\ngentlemen, and it is evident that the benefit of a course of baths may\r\nbe greatly lessened by the occasional unreadiness of the bath. Two\r\nsuites of rooms should, therefore, be provided. It may be that they will\r\nbe most economically constructed and worked if arranged side by side, so\r\nthat they may have their furnaces together, and be stoked with economy.\r\n\r\nWhere, as in country establishments, there is plenty of room, it is\r\noften convenient to arrange the Turkish and other baths on the ground\r\nfloor adjoining the main building, a corridor of connection being\r\nplaced, if necessary. It should be remembered, however, that invalids\r\nhave to be taken--often carried or wheeled in movable chairs--to the\r\nbaths, and allowance should therefore be made for the passage of such a\r\nwheeled chair from the top story, by way of a lift, to the door of the\r\nbaths.\r\n\r\nIn a large establishment, a full complement of rooms should be provided\r\nfor the Turkish bath--viz. three hot rooms, a washing and shampooing\r\nroom, and a cooling room. They will, of course, be on a small scale; but\r\nthe whole number should be provided. A plunge bath should also be added,\r\nbut in small hydropathics may be dispensed with altogether.\r\n\r\nFor hydropathic purposes the lavatorium is generally required to have\r\nrather more elaborate water-fittings than other baths. The needle bath\r\nshould include the ascending shower, the back shower, and the spinal\r\ndouche--a small nozzle behind the rose of the vertical shower. The\r\nregulating appliances for these various showers, sprays, &c., should be\r\nbrought together, and conveniently placed for the attendant. A very\r\ningenious appliance, suitable for a hydropathic bath, is a thermometer\r\nregulating valve, which indicates the temperature of the water being\r\nsupplied to the bather. The waters mix in a ball, into which is inserted\r\nthe bulb of a sensitive thermometer, which rises and falls as the hot or\r\ncold handles are turned.\r\n\r\nIf the shampooing and washing room of the Turkish bath is to be used for\r\nthe administration of the tonic water baths to other bathers besides\r\nthose taking the Turkish bath, it must be made of ample dimensions. So,\r\nalso, if the cooling room is to be used as a reposing room for other\r\nbathers, it must be made of large size.\r\n\r\nPerfect ventilation is of paramount importance in baths used for the\r\ntreatment of disease. Purity of atmosphere in the hot rooms is a vital\r\nnecessity, and so also is it in the miscellaneous bath rooms of a\r\nhydropathic establishment.\r\n\r\nUnreadiness is a great vice in the Turkish bath appended to these\r\ninstitutions. Hot rooms beneath their proper temperature, and lukewarm\r\nwater, are unpardonable delinquencies, either in the early morning, in\r\nthe evening, or during the day. For this reason I would recommend a\r\nfurnace of fireclay, as it retains its heat for a long time, and is not\r\nsubject to the rapid changes of iron stoves.\r\n\r\nMuch of that which I have said with respect to the hydropathic bath will\r\napply to the design of the bath for hospital and asylum purposes. Here,\r\nhowever, efficiency is all that is required, and everything need be but\r\nof the plainest description. The conditions and exigencies of each case\r\nmust determine the size, position, and nature of the suite of bath\r\nrooms. All that has been said upon the subject of the design and\r\nconstruction of the bath must be studied, and the principles, herein\r\ngiven, applied to the peculiar circumstances. So also in regard to\r\nTurkish baths for hotels, and for residential blocks of buildings, and\r\nfor clubs.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide field for activity in Turkish bath building, in the\r\nincreased provision of baths in hospitals, asylums, and public and\r\nprivate institutions of one kind and another; and also in hotels,\r\n\"flats,\" and clubs. The hydropathic establishments have long adopted\r\nthe Turkish bath as a powerful remedial and curative agent in perfect\r\nharmony with the principles of the Water Cure. But it is only\r\noccasionally that such provision has been made in hospitals and asylums;\r\nand although within the last few years noticeable innovations have been\r\nmade in this respect, the subject has heretofore been greatly neglected.\r\nSeeing, too, the immense extent to which co-operative living has\r\ndeveloped, and the consequent enormous increase in size of large hotels,\r\nresidential blocks, &c., I cannot but think that the builders of such\r\ntenements could with advantage turn their attention to the supplying of\r\nsmall Turkish baths for the visitors and residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKISH BATH FOR HORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimals of many kinds, including horses, dogs, cows, sheep, and pigs,\r\nhave been experimented upon with regard to the bath, and with much\r\nsuccess. But for practical purposes all we need here consider is the\r\ndesign of the bath for horses, since a bath for a horse will evidently\r\nbe suitable for a cow, and might not be wholly beneath the dignity of a\r\npig. It is, after all, only in connection with the training of horses\r\nthat anything of practical importance has been accomplished in this\r\ndirection. Several Turkish baths for horses have been erected in this\r\ncountry in connection with hospitals for horses, attached to large\r\nbusinesses, and appended to training stables. In the development of\r\nrace-horses the treatment has, according to the opinion of several\r\nauthorities, been found eminently beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe bath must be arranged in connection, and in direct communication\r\nwith the stables. It may consist, as Fig. 27--a plan of a bath built for\r\nthe Great Northern Railway Company's hospital for horses--of a washing,\r\nand two hot, rooms. An airy shed will do for a place for the animals to\r\ncool, and in fine weather they will derive more benefit from being\r\nturned out in the open. In the plan given it will be seen that the horse\r\nis led through the washing room into the first hot room. Without\r\nturning round, he may be led into the second hot room and thence into\r\nthe washing room again. In the hot rooms, which are heated by a\r\nconvoluted stove, are stocks, wherein, if restive, the animal can be\r\nsecured. A similar arrangement is made in the washing room, where, after\r\nundergoing the sweating process, the horse is groomed down, an operation\r\nthat should be performed in part with an iron _strigil_, much after the\r\npattern of those employed upon their own bodies by the ancient Romans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.\r\n\r\nPlan of the Great Northern Railway Company's Turkish Bath for Horses.]\r\n\r\nThese equine Turkish baths need be very inexpensive and simply\r\nconstructed, though, where it is desired to do the thing well, glazed\r\nbricks should, for the sake of cleanliness, be used for lining the\r\nwalls. All that will be required in the washing rooms is a couple of\r\ndraw-off taps with hot and cold water, some pails, a scraper, and\r\nwash-leather. On leaving the sudatory chamber, the horse should first be\r\nwell scraped with the scraper, carefully sponging, or dousing him, if\r\nnecessary, with warm water. Buckets of hot, tepid, and cold water should\r\nthen be thrown over him, and having been well rubbed down with the\r\nleather, he should then be covered with a cotton sheet, and his legs\r\nbandaged with cotton bands, the sheets, &c., being gradually removed\r\nafter an interval of about a quarter of an hour, and the animal turned\r\ninto a shed, or into the open, to cool.\r\n\r\nTHE
