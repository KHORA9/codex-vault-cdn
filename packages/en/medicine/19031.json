Numerous facts are on record, of human food, contaminated with\r\npoisonous ingredients, having been vended to the public; and the annals\r\nof medicine record tragical events ensuing from the use of such food.\r\n\r\nThe eager and insatiable thirst for gain, is proof against prohibitions\r\nand penalties; and the possible sacrifice of a fellow-creature's life,\r\nis a secondary consideration among unprincipled dealers.\r\n\r\nHowever invidious the office may appear, and however painful the duty\r\nmay be, of exposing the names of individuals, who have been convicted of\r\nadulterating food; yet it was necessary, for the verification of my\r\nstatement, that cases should be adduced in their support; and I have\r\ncarefully avoided citing any, except those which are authenticated in\r\nParliamentary documents and other public records.\r\n\r\nTo render this Treatise still more useful, I have also animadverted on\r\ncertain material errors, sometimes unconsciously committed through\r\naccident or ignorance, in private families, during the preparation of\r\nvarious articles of food, and of delicacies for the table.\r\n\r\nIn stating the experimental proceedings necessary for the detection of\r\nthe frauds which it has been my object to expose, I have confined myself\r\nto the task of pointing out such operations only as may be performed by\r\npersons unacquainted with chemical science; and it has been my purpose\r\nto express all necessary rules and instructions in the plainest\r\nlanguage, divested of those recondite terms of science, which would be\r\nout of place in a work intended for general perusal.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Treatise will be fully answered, if the views here\r\ngiven should induce a single reader to pursue the object for which it\r\nis published; or if it should tend to impress on the mind of the Public\r\nthe magnitude of an evil, which, in many cases, prevails to an extent so\r\nalarming, that we may exclaim with the sons of the Prophet,\r\n\r\n     \"_THERE IS DEATH IN THE POT._\"\r\n\r\nFor the abolition of such nefarious practices, it is the interest of all\r\nclasses of the community to co-operate.\r\n\r\nFREDRICK ACCUM.\r\n\r\nLONDON.\r\n1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD           _Page_ 13\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF WATER EMPLOYED IN DOMESTIC ECONOMY       33\r\n\r\n_Characters of Good Water_ 37\r\n\r\n_Chemical Constitution of the Waters used in Domestic Economy and\r\nthe Arts_                                                             40\r\n\r\n_Rain Water_                                                          40\r\n_Snow Water_                                                          41\r\n_Spring Water_                                                        42\r\n_River Water_                                                         44\r\n\r\n_Substances usually contained in Common Water, and Tests by which\r\nthey are detected_                                                    48\r\n\r\n_Method of ascertaining the Quantity of each of the different\r\nSubstances usually contained in Common Water_                         54\r\n\r\n_Deleterious Effects of keeping Water for Domestic Economy, in\r\nLeaden Reservoirs_                                                    60\r\n\r\n_Method of detecting Lead, when contained in common Water_            69\r\n\r\n\r\nADULTERATION OF WINE                                                  74\r\n\r\n_Method of detecting the Deleterious Adulterations of Wine_           86\r\n\r\n_Specific Differences, and Component Parts of Wine_                   89\r\n\r\n_Easy process of ascertaining the Quantity of Brandy contained in\r\nvarious sorts of Wine_                                                92\r\n\r\n_Tabular View, exhibiting the Per Centage of Brandy or Alcohol\r\ncontained in various kinds of Wine and other fermented Liquors_       94\r\n\r\n_Constitution of Home-made Wines_                                     96\r\n\r\n\r\nADULTERATION OF BREAD                                                 98\r\n\r\n_Method of detecting the Presence of Alum in Bread_                  108\r\n\r\n_Easy Method of judging of the Goodness of Bread-Corn and\r\nBread-Flour_                                                         110\r\n\r\n\r\nADULTERATION OF BEER                                                 113\r\n\r\n_List of Druggists and Grocers, prosecuted and convicted for\r\nsupplying illegal Ingredients to Brewers for Adulterating Beer_      119\r\n\r\n_Porter_                                                             121\r\n\r\n_Strength and Specific Differences of different kinds of Porter_     125\r\n\r\n_List of Publicans prosecuted and convicted for adulterating Beer\r\nwith illegal Ingredients, and for mixing Table Beer with their\r\nStrong Beer_                                                         129\r\n\r\n_Illegal Substances used for adulterating Beer_                      131\r\n\r\n_Ingredients seized at various Breweries and Brewers' Druggists,\r\nfor adulterating Beer_                                               136\r\n\r\n_List of Brewers prosecuted and convicted for adulterating Strong\r\nBeer with Table Beer_                                                143\r\n\r\n_Old, or Entire Beer;

and their successful example has called forth, from among the\r\nretail dealers, a multitude of competitors in the same iniquitous\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nTo such perfection of ingenuity has this system of adulterating food\r\narrived, that spurious articles of various kinds are every where to be\r\nfound, made up so skilfully as to baffle the discrimination of the most\r\nexperienced judges.\r\n\r\nAmong the number of substances used in domestic economy which are now\r\nvery generally found sophisticated, may be distinguished--tea, coffee,\r\nbread, beer, wine, spiritous liquors, salad oil, pepper, vinegar,\r\nmustard, cream, and other articles of subsistence.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it would be difficult to mention a single article of food which\r\nis not to be met with in an adulterated state; and there are some\r\nsubstances which are scarcely ever to be procured genuine.\r\n\r\nSome of these spurious compounds are comparatively harmless when used\r\nas food; and as in these cases merely substances of inferior value are\r\nsubstituted for more costly and genuine ingredients, the sophistication,\r\nthough it may affect our purse, does not injure our health. Of this kind\r\nare the manufacture of factitious pepper, the adulterations of mustard,\r\nvinegar, cream, &c. Others, however, are highly deleterious; and to this\r\nclass belong the adulterations of beer, wines, spiritous liquors,\r\npickles, salad oil, and many others.\r\n\r\nThere are particular chemists who make it a regular trade to supply\r\ndrugs or nefarious preparations to the unprincipled brewer of porter or\r\nale; others perform the same office to the wine and spirit merchant; and\r\nothers again to the grocer and the oilman. The operators carry on their\r\nprocesses chiefly in secresy, and under some delusive firm, with the\r\nostensible denotements of a fair and lawful establishment.\r\n\r\nThese illicit pursuits have assumed all the order and method of a\r\nregular trade; they may severally claim to be distinguished as an _art\r\nand mystery_; for the workmen employed in them are often wholly ignorant\r\nof the nature of the substances which pass through their hands, and of\r\nthe purposes to which they are ultimately applied.\r\n\r\nTo elude the vigilance of the inquisitive, to defeat the scrutiny of the\r\nrevenue officer, and to ensure the secresy of these mysteries, the\r\nprocesses are very ingeniously divided and subdivided among individual\r\noperators, and the manufacture is purposely carried on in separate\r\nestablishments. The task of proportioning the ingredients for use is\r\nassigned to one individual, while the composition and preparation of\r\nthem may be said to form a distinct part of the business, and is\r\nentrusted to another workman. Most of the articles are transmitted to\r\nthe consumer in a disguised state, or in such a form that their real\r\nnature cannot possibly be detected by the unwary. Thus the extract of\r\n_coculus indicus_, employed by fraudulent manufacturers of malt-liquors\r\nto impart an intoxicating quality to porter or ales, is known in the\r\nmarket by the name of _black extract_, ostensibly destined for the use\r\nof tanners and dyers. It is obtained by boiling the berries of the\r\ncoculus indicus in water, and converting, by a subsequent evaporation,\r\nthis decoction into a stiff black tenacious mass, possessing, in a high\r\ndegree, the narcotic and intoxicating quality of the poisonous berry\r\nfrom which it is prepared. Another substance, composed of extract of\r\nquassia and liquorice juice, used by fraudulent brewers to economise\r\nboth malt and hops, is technically called _multum_.[1]\r\n\r\nThe quantities of coculus indicus berries, as well as of black extract,\r\nimported into this country for adulterating malt liquors, are enormous.\r\nIt forms a considerable branch of commerce in the hands of a few\r\nbrokers: yet, singular as it may seem, no inquiry appears to have been\r\nhitherto made by the officers of the revenue respecting its application.\r\nMany other substances employed in the adulteration of beer, ale, and\r\nspiritous liquors, are in a similar manner intentionally disguised; and\r\nof the persons by whom they are purchased, a great number are totally\r\nunacquainted with their nature or composition.\r\n\r\nAn extract, said to be innocent, sold in casks, containing from half a\r\ncwt. to five cwt. by the brewers' druggists, under the name of\r\n_bittern_, is composed of calcined sulphate of iron (copperas), extract\r\nof coculus indicus berries, extract of quassia, and Spanish liquorice.\r\n\r\nIt would be very easy to adduce, in support of these remarks, the\r\ntestimony of numerous individuals, by whom I have been professionally\r\nengaged to examine certain mixtures, said to be perfectly innocent,\r\nwhich are used in very extensive manufactories of the above description.\r\nIndeed, during the long period devoted to the practice of my\r\nprofession, I have had abundant reason to be convinced that a vast\r\nnumber of dealers, of the highest respectability, have vended to their\r\ncustomers articles absolutely poisonous, which they themselves\r\nconsidered as harmless, and which they would not have offered for sale,\r\nhad they been apprised of the spurious and pernicious nature of the\r\ncompounds, and of the purposes to which they were destined.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I have known cases in which brandy merchants were not\r\naware that the substance which they frequently purchase under the\r\ndelusive name of _flash_, for strengthening and clarifying spiritous\r\nliquors, and which is held out as consisting of burnt sugar and\r\nisinglass only, in the form of an extract, is in reality a compound of\r\nsugar, with extract of capsicum; and that to the acrid and pungent\r\nqualities of the capsicum is to be ascribed the heightened flavour of\r\nbrandy and rum, when coloured with the above-mentioned matter.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the ale-brewer has been supplied with ready-ground\r\ncoriander seeds, previously mixed with a portion of _nux vomica_ and\r\nquassia, to give a bitter taste and narcotic property to the beverage.\r\n\r\nThe retail venders of mustard do not appear to be aware that mustard\r\nseed alone cannot produce, when ground, a powder of so intense and\r\nbrilliant a colour as that of the common mustard of commerce. Nor would\r\nthe powder of real mustard, when mixed with salt and water, without the\r\naddition of a portion of pulverised capsicum, keep for so long a time as\r\nthe mustard usually offered for sale.\r\n\r\nMany other instances of unconscious deceptions might be mentioned, which\r\nwere practised by persons of upright and honourable minds.\r\n\r\nIt is a painful reflection, that the division of labour which has been\r\nso instrumental in bringing the manufactures of this country to their\r\npresent flourishing state, should have also tended to conceal and\r\nfacilitate the fraudulent practices in question; and that from a\r\ncorrespondent ramification of commerce into a multitude of distinct\r\nbranches, particularly in the metropolis and the large towns of the\r\nempire, the traffic in adulterated commodities should find its way\r\nthrough so many circuitous channels, as to defy the most scrutinising\r\nendeavour to trace it to its source.\r\n\r\nIt is not less lamentable that the extensive application of chemistry to\r\nthe useful purposes of life, should have been perverted into an\r\nauxiliary to this nefarious traffic. But, happily for the science, it\r\nmay, without difficulty, be converted into a means of detecting the\r\nabuse; to effect which, very little chemical skill is required; and the\r\ncourse to be pursued forms the object of the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe baker asserts that he does not put alum into bread; but he is well\r\naware that, in purchasing a certain quantity of flour, he must take a\r\nsack of _sharp whites_ (a term given to flour contaminated with a\r\nquantity of alum), without which it would be impossible for him to\r\nproduce light, white, and porous bread, from a half-spoiled material.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale mealman frequently purchases this spurious commodity,\r\n(which forms a separate branch of business in the hands of certain\r\nindividuals,) in order to enable himself to sell his decayed and\r\nhalf-spoiled flour.\r\n\r\nOther individuals furnish the baker with alum mixed up with salt, under\r\nthe obscure denomination of _stuff_. There are wholesale manufacturing\r\nchemists, whose sole business is to crystallise alum, in such a form as\r\nwill adapt this salt to the purpose of being mixed in a crystalline\r\nstate with the crystals of common salt, to disguise the character of\r\nthe compound. The mixture called _stuff_, is composed of one part of\r\nalum, in minute crystals, and three of common salt. In many other trades\r\na similar mode of proceeding prevails. Potatoes are soaked in water to\r\naugment their weight.\r\n\r\nThe practice of sophisticating the necessaries of life, being reduced to\r\nsystematic regularity, is ranked by public opinion among other\r\nmercantile pursuits; and is not only regarded with less disgust than\r\nformerly, but is almost generally esteemed as a justifiable way to\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nIt is really astonishing that the penal law is not more effectually\r\nenforced against practices so inimical to the public welfare. The man\r\nwho robs a fellow subject of a few shillings on the high-way, is\r\nsentenced to death; while he who distributes a slow poison to a whole\r\ncommunity, escapes unpunished.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged by some, that, under so vast a system of finance as\r\nthat of Great Britain, it is expedient that the revenue should be\r\ncollected in large amounts; and therefore that the severity of the law\r\nshould be relaxed in favour of all mercantile concerns in proportion to\r\ntheir extent: encouragement must be given to large capitalists; and\r\nwhere an extensive brewery or distillery yields an important\r\ncontribution to the revenue, no strict scrutiny need be adopted in\r\nregard to the quality of the article from which such contribution is\r\nraised, provided the excise do not suffer by the fraud.\r\n\r\nBut the principles of the constitution afford no sanction to this\r\npreference, and the true interests of the country require that it should\r\nbe abolished; for a tax dependent upon deception must be at best\r\nprecarious, and must be, sooner or later, diminished by the irresistible\r\ndiffusion of knowledge. Sound policy requires that the law should be\r\nimpartially enforced in all cases; and if its penalties were extended to\r\nabuses of which it does not now take cognisance, there is no doubt that\r\nthe revenue would be abundantly benefited.\r\n\r\nAnother species of fraud, to which I shall at present but briefly\r\nadvert, and which has increased to so alarming an extent, that it loudly\r\ncalls for the interference of government, is the adulteration of drugs\r\nand medicines.\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of the most potent drugs and chemical preparations used in\r\npharmacy, are vended in a sophisticated state by dealers who would be\r\nthe last to be suspected. It is well known, that of the article Peruvian\r\nbark, there is a variety of species inferior to the genuine; that too\r\nlittle discrimination is exercised by the collectors of this precious\r\nmedicament; that it is carelessly assorted, and is frequently packed in\r\ngreen hides; that much of it arrives in Spain in a half-decayed state,\r\nmixed with fragments of other vegetables and various extraneous\r\nsubstances; and in this state is distributed throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nBut as if this were not a sufficient deterioration, the public are often\r\nserved with a spurious compound of mahogany saw-dust and oak wood,\r\nground into powder mixed with a proportion of good quinquina, and sold\r\nas genuine bark powder.\r\n\r\nEvery chemist knows that there are mills constantly at work in this\r\nmetropolis, which furnish bark powder at a much cheaper rate than the\r\nsubstance can be procured for in its natural state. The price of the\r\nbest genuine bark, upon an average, is not lower than twelve shillings\r\nthe pound; but immense quantities of powder bark are supplied to the\r\napothecaries at three or four shillings a pound.\r\n\r\nIt is also notorious that there are manufacturers of spurious rhubarb\r\npowder, ipecacuanha powder,[2] James's powder; and other simple and\r\ncompound medicines of great potency, who carry on their diabolical trade\r\non an amazingly large scale. Indeed, the quantity of medical\r\npreparations thus sophisticated exceeds belief. Cheapness, and not\r\ngenuineness and excellence, is the grand desideratum with the\r\nunprincipled dealers in drugs and medicines.\r\n\r\nThose who are familiar with chemistry may easily convince themselves of\r\nthe existence of the fraud, by subjecting to a chemical examination\r\neither spirits of hartshorn, magnesia, calcined magnesia, calomel, or\r\nany other chemical preparation in general demand.\r\n\r\nSpirit of hartshorn is counterfeited by mixing liquid caustic ammonia\r\nwith the distilled spirit of hartshorn, to increase the pungency of its\r\nodour, and to enable it to bear an addition of water.\r\n\r\nThe fraud is detected by adding spirit of wine to the sophisticated\r\nspirit; for, if no considerable coagulation ensues, the adulteration is\r\nproved. It may also be discovered by the hartshorn spirit not producing\r\na brisk effervescence when mixed with muriatic or nitric acid.\r\n\r\nMagnesia usually contains a portion of lime, originating from hard water\r\nbeing used instead of soft, in the preparation of this medicine.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the purity of magnesia, add to a portion of it a little\r\nsulphuric acid, diluted with ten times its bulk of water. If the\r\nmagnesia be completely soluble, and the solution remains transparent, it\r\nmay be pronounced _pure_; but not otherwise. Or, dissolve a portion of\r\nthe magnesia in muriatic acid, and add a solution of sub-carbonate of\r\nammonia. If any lime be present, it will form a precipitate; whereas\r\npure magnesia will remain in solution.\r\n\r\nCalcined magnesia is seldom met with in a pure state. It may be assayed\r\nby the same tests as the common magnesia. It ought not to effervesce at\r\nall, with dilute sulphuric acid; and, if the magnesia and acid be put\r\ntogether into one scale of a balance, no diminution of weight should\r\nensue on mixing them together. Calcined magnesia, however, is very\r\nseldom so pure as to be totally dissolved by diluted sulphuric acid;\r\nfor a small insoluble residue generally remains, consisting chiefly of\r\nsilicious earth, derived from the alkali employed in the preparation of\r\nit. The solution in sulphuric acid, when largely diluted, ought not to\r\nafford any precipitation by the addition of oxalate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe genuineness of calomel may be ascertained by boiling, for a few\r\nminutes, one part, with 1/32 part of muriate of ammonia in ten parts of\r\ndistilled water. When carbonate of potash is added to the filtered\r\nsolution, no precipitation will ensue if the calomel be pure.\r\n\r\nIndeed, some of the most common and cheap drugs do not escape the\r\nadulterating hand of the unprincipled druggist. Syrup of buckthorn, for\r\nexample, instead of being prepared from the juice of buckthorn berries,\r\n(_rhamnus catharticus_,) is made from the fruit of the blackberry\r\nbearing alder, and the dogberry tree. A mixture of the berries of the\r\nbuckthorn and blackberry bearing alder, and of the dogberry tree, may be\r\nseen publicly exposed for sale by some of the venders of medicinal\r\nherbs. This abuse may be discovered by opening the berries: those of\r\nbuckthorn have almost always four seeds; of the alder, two; and of the\r\ndogberry, only one. Buckthorn berries, bruised on white paper, stain it\r\nof a green colour, which the others do not.\r\n\r\nInstead of worm-seed (_artemisia santonica_,) the seeds of tansy are\r\nfrequently offered for sale, or a mixture of both.\r\n\r\nA great many of the essential oils obtained from the more expensive\r\nspices, are frequently so much adulterated, that it is not easy to meet\r\nwith such as are at all fit for use: nor are these adulterations easily\r\ndiscoverable. The grosser abuses, indeed, may be readily detected. Thus,\r\nif the oil be adulterated with alcohol, it will turn milky on the\r\naddition of water; if with expressed oils, alcohol will dissolve the\r\nvolatile, and leave the other behind; if with oil of turpentine, on\r\ndipping a piece of paper in the mixture, and drying it with a gentle\r\nheat, the turpentine will be betrayed by its smell. The more subtile\r\nartists, however, have contrived other methods of sophistication, which\r\nelude all trials. And as all volatile oils agree in the general\r\nproperties of solubility in spirit of wine, and volatility in the heat\r\nof boiling water, &c. it is plain that they may be variously mixed with\r\neach other, or the dearer sophisticated with the cheaper, without any\r\npossibility of discovering the abuse by any of the before-mentioned\r\ntrials. Perfumers assert that the smell and taste are the only certain\r\ntests of which the nature of the thing will admit. For example, if a\r\nbark should have in every respect the appearance of good cinnamon, and\r\nshould be proved indisputably to be the genuine bark of the cinnamon\r\ntree; yet if it want the cinnamon flavour, or has it but in a low\r\ndegree, we reject it: and the case is the same with the essential oil of\r\ncinnamon. It is only from use and habit, or comparisons with specimens\r\nof known quality, that we can judge of the goodness, either of the drugs\r\nthemselves, or of their oils.\r\n\r\nMost of the arrow-root, the fecula of the Maranta arudinacea, sold by\r\ndruggists, is a mixture of potatoe starch and arrow-root.\r\n\r\nThe same system of adulteration extends to articles used in various\r\ntrades and manufactures. For instance, linen tape, and various other\r\nhousehold commodities of that kind, instead of being manufactured of\r\nlinen thread only, are made up of linen and cotton. Colours for\r\npainting, not only those used by artists, such as ultramarine,[3]\r\ncarmine,[4] and lake;[5] Antwerp blue,[6] chrome yellow,[7] and Indian\r\nink;[8] but also the coarser colours used by the common house-painter\r\nare more or less adulterated. Thus, of the latter kind, white lead[9] is\r\nmixed with carbonate or sulphate of barytes; vermilion[10] with red\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nSoap used in house-keeping is frequently adulterated with a\r\nconsiderable portion of fine white clay, brought from St. Stephens, in\r\nCornwall. In the manufacture of printing paper, a large quantity of\r\nplaster of Paris is added to the paper stuff, to increase the weight of\r\nthe manufactured article. The selvage of cloth is often dyed with a\r\npermanent colour, and artfully stitched to the edge of cloth dyed with a\r\nfugitive dye. The frauds committed in the tanning of skins, and in the\r\nmanufacture of cutlery and jewelry, exceed belief.\r\n\r\nThe object of all unprincipled modern manufacturers seems to be the\r\nsparing of their time and labour as much as possible, and to increase\r\nthe quantity of the articles they produce, without much regard to their\r\nquality. The ingenuity and perseverance of self-interest is proof\r\nagainst prohibitions, and contrives to elude the vigilance of the most\r\nactive government.\r\n\r\nThe eager and insatiable thirst for gain, which seems to be a leading\r\ncharacteristic of the times, calls into action every human faculty, and\r\ngives an irresistible impulse to the power of invention; and where lucre\r\nbecomes the reigning principle, the possible sacrifice of even a fellow\r\ncreature's life is a secondary consideration. In reference to the\r\ndeterioration of almost all the necessaries and comforts of existence,\r\nit may be justly observed, in a civil as well as a religious sense, that\r\n\"_in the midst of life we are in death_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _The Times_, May 18, 1818. The King _v._ Richard Bowman. The\r\ndefendant was a brewer, living in Wapping-street, Wapping, and was\r\ncharged with having in his possession a drug called _multum_, and a\r\nquantity of copperas.\r\n\r\nThe articles were produced by Thomas Gates, an excise officer, who had,\r\nafter a search, found them on the defendant's premises. The Court\r\nsentenced the defendant to pay a fine of 200_l._\r\n\r\nThe King _v._ Luke Lyons. The defendant is a brewer, and was brought up\r\nunder an indictment charging him with having made use of various\r\ndeleterious drugs in his brewery, among which were capsicum, copperas,\r\n&c. The defendant was ordered to pay the fines of 20_l._ upon the first\r\ncount, 200_l._ upon the third, and 200_l._ upon the seventh count in the\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\nThe King _v._ Thomas Evans. The charge against this defendant was, that\r\nhe had in his possession forty-seven barrels of stale unpalatable beer.\r\nOn, the 11th of March, John Wilson, an excise officer, went to the\r\nstorehouse, and found forty-seven casks containing forty-three barrels\r\nand a half of sour unwholesome beer. Several samples of the beer were\r\nproduced, all of them of a different colour, and filled with sediment. A\r\nfine of 30_l._ was ordered to be paid by the defendant.\r\n\r\n[2] Of this root, several varieties are imported. The white sort, which\r\nhas no wrinkles, and no perceptible bitterness in taste, and which,\r\nthough taken in a large dose, has scarcely any effect at all, after\r\nbeing pulverised by fraudulent druggists, and mixed with a portion of\r\nemetic tartar, is sold, at a low price, for the powder of genuine\r\nipecacuanha root.\r\n\r\n[3] Genuine ultramarine should become deprived of its colour when thrown\r\ninto concentrated nitric acid.\r\n\r\n[4] Genuine carmine should be totally soluble in liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\n[5] Genuine madder and carmine lakes should be totally soluble by\r\nboiling in a concentrated solution of soda or potash.\r\n\r\n[6] Genuine Antwerp blue should not become deprived of its colour when\r\nthrown into liquid chlorine.\r\n\r\n[7] Genuine chrome yellow should not effervesce with nitric acid.\r\n\r\n[8] The best Indian ink breaks, splintery, with a smooth glossy\r\nfracture, and feels soft, and not gritty, when rubbed against the teeth.\r\n\r\n[9] Genuine white lead should be completely soluble in nitric acid, and\r\nthe solution should remain transparent when mingled with a solution of\r\nsulphate of soda.\r\n\r\n[10] Genuine vermilion should become totally volatilised on being\r\nexposed to a red heat; and it should not impart a red colour to spirit\r\nof wine, when digested with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS\r\n\r\nON THE\r\n\r\nEffect of different Kinds of Waters\r\n\r\nIN THEIR APPLICATION TO\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE ARTS;\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ASCERTAINING THEIR PURITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt requires not much reflection to become convinced that the waters\r\nwhich issue from the recesses of the earth, and form springs, wells,\r\nrivers, or lakes, often materially differ from each other in their taste\r\nand other obvious properties. There are few people who have not observed\r\na difference in the waters used for domestic purposes and in the arts;\r\nand the distinctions of _hard_ and _soft_ water are familiar to every\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nWater perfectly pure is scarcely ever met with in nature.\r\n\r\nIt must also be obvious, that the health and comfort of families, and\r\nthe conveniences of domestic life, are materially affected by the supply\r\nof good and wholesome water. Hence a knowledge of the quality and\r\nsalubrity of the different kinds of waters employed in the common\r\nconcerns of life, on account of the abundant daily use we make of them\r\nin the preparation of food, is unquestionably an object of considerable\r\nimportance, and demands our attention.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced by the foreign matters which water may contain, are\r\nmore considerable, and of greater importance, than might at first be\r\nimagined. It cannot be denied, that such waters as are _hard_, or loaded\r\nwith earthy matter, have a decided effect upon some important functions\r\nof the human body. They increase the distressing symptoms under which\r\nthose persons labour who are afflicted with what is commonly called\r\ngravel complaints; and many other ailments might be named, that are\r\nalways aggravated by the use of waters abounding in saline and earthy\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe purity of the waters employed in some of the arts and manufactures,\r\nis an object of not less consequence. In the process of brewing malt\r\nliquors, soft water is preferable to hard. Every brewer knows that the\r\nlargest possible quantity of the extractive matter of the malt is\r\nobtained in the least possible time, and at the smallest cost, by means\r\nof soft water.\r\n\r\nIn the art of the dyer, hard water not only opposes the solution of\r\nseveral dye stuffs, but it also alters the natural tints of some\r\ndelicate colours; whilst in others again it precipitates the earthy and\r\nsaline matters with which it is impregnated, into the delicate fibres of\r\nthe stuff, and thus impedes the softness and brilliancy of the dye.\r\n\r\nThe bleacher cannot use with advantage waters impregnated with earthy\r\nsalts; and a minute portion of iron imparts to the cloth a yellowish\r\nhue.\r\n\r\nTo the manufacturer of painters' colours, water as pure as possible is\r\nabsolutely essential for the successful preparation of several delicate\r\npigments. Carmine, madder lake, ultramarine, and Indian yellow, cannot\r\nbe prepared without perfectly pure water.\r\n\r\nFor the steeping or raiting of flax, soft water is absolutely necessary;\r\nin hard water the flax may be immersed for months, till its texture be\r\ninjured, and still the ligneous matter will not be decomposed, and the\r\nfibres properly separated.\r\n\r\nIn the culinary art, the effects of water more or less pure are\r\nlikewise obvious. Good and pure water softens the fibres of animal and\r\nvegetable matters more readily than such as is called _hard_. Every cook\r\nknows that dry or ripe pease, and other farinaceous seeds, cannot\r\n_readily_ be boiled soft in hard water; because the farina of the seed\r\nis not perfectly soluble in water loaded with earthy salts.\r\n\r\nGreen esculent vegetable substances are more tender when boiled in soft\r\nwater than in hard water; although hard water imparts to them a better\r\ncolour. The effects of hard and soft water may be easily shown in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nLet two separate portions of tea-leaves be macerated, by precisely the\r\nsame processes, in circumstances all alike, in similar and separate\r\nvessels, the one containing hard and the other soft water, either hot or\r\ncold, the infusion made with the soft water will have by far the\r\nstrongest taste, although it possesses less colour than the infusion\r\nmade with the hard water. It will strike a more intense black with a\r\nsolution of sulphate of iron, and afford a more abundant precipitate,\r\nwith a solution of animal jelly, which at once shews that soft water has\r\nextracted more tanning matter, and more gallic acid, from the\r\ntea-leaves, than could be obtained from them under like circumstances by\r\nmeans of hard water.\r\n\r\nMany animals which are accustomed to drink soft water, refuse hard\r\nwater. Horses in particular prefer the former. Pigeons refuse hard water\r\nwhen they have been accustomed to soft water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF GOOD WATER.\r\n\r\nA good criterion of the purity of water fit for domestic purposes, is\r\nits softness. This quality is at once obvious by the touch, if we only\r\nwash our hands in it with soap. Good water should be beautifully\r\ntransparent; a slight opacity indicates extraneous matter. To judge of\r\nthe perfect transparency of water, a quantity of it should be put into a\r\ndeep glass vessel, the larger the better, so that we can look down\r\nperpendicularly into a considerable mass of the fluid; we may then\r\nreadily discover the slightest degree of muddiness much better than if\r\nthe water be viewed through the glass placed between the eye and the\r\nlight. It should be perfectly colourless, devoid of odour, and its\r\ntaste soft and agreeable. It should send out air-bubbles when poured\r\nfrom one vessel into another; it should boil pulse soft, and form with\r\nsoap an uniform opaline fluid, which does not separate after standing\r\nfor several hours.\r\n\r\nIt is to the presence of common air and carbonic acid gas that common\r\nwater owes its taste, and many of the good effects which it produces on\r\nanimals and vegetables. Spring water, which contains more air, has a\r\nmore lively taste than river water.\r\n\r\nHence the insipid or vapid taste of newly boiled water, from which these\r\ngases are expelled: fish cannot live in water deprived of those elastic\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\n100 cubic inches of the New River water, with which part of this\r\nmetropolis is supplied, contains 2,25 of carbonic acid, and 1,25 of\r\ncommon air. The water of the river Thames contains rather a larger\r\nquantity of common air, and a smaller portion of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nIf water not fully saturated with common air be agitated with this\r\nelastic fluid, a portion of the air is absorbed; but the two chief\r\nconstituent gases of the atmosphere, the oxygen and nitrogen, are not\r\nequally affected, the former being absorbed in preference to the latter.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Dalton, in agitating water with atmospheric air,\r\nconsisting of 79 of nitrogen, and 21 of oxygen, the water absorbs 1/64\r\nof 79/100 nitrogen gas = 1,234, and 1/27 of 21/100 oxygen gas = 778,\r\namounting in all to 2,012.\r\n\r\nWater is freed from foreign matter by distillation: and for any chemical\r\nprocess in which accuracy is requisite, distilled water must be used.\r\n\r\nHard waters may, in general, be cured in part, by dropping into them a\r\nsolution of sub-carbonate of potash; or, if the hardness be owing only\r\nto the presence of super-carbonate of lime, mere boiling will greatly\r\nremedy the defect; part of the carbonic acid flies off, and a neutral\r\ncarbonate of lime falls down to the bottom; it may then be used for\r\nwashing, scarcely curdling soap. But if the hardness be owing in part to\r\nsulphate of lime, boiling does not soften it at all.\r\n\r\nWhen spring water is used for washing, it is advantageous to leave it\r\nfor some time exposed to the open air in a reservoir with a large\r\nsurface. Part of the carbonic acid becomes thus dissipated, and part of\r\nthe carbonate of lime falls to the bottom. Mr. Dalton[11] has observed\r\nthat the more any spring is drawn from, the softer the water becomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE WATERS USED IN DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE\r\nARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rain Water_,\r\n\r\nCollected with every precaution as it descends from the clouds, and at a\r\ndistance from large towns, or any other object capable of impregnating\r\nthe atmosphere with foreign matters, approaches more nearly to a state\r\nof purity than perhaps any other natural water. Even collected under\r\nthese circumstances, however, it invariably contains a portion of common\r\nair and carbonic acid gas. The specific gravity of rain water scarcely\r\ndiffers from that of distilled water; and from the minute portions of\r\nthe foreign ingredients which it generally contains, it is very _soft_,\r\nand admirably adapted for many culinary purposes, and various processes\r\nin different manufactures and the arts.\r\n\r\nFresh-fallen _snow_, melted without the contact of air, appears to be\r\nnearly free from air. Gay-Lussac and Humboldt, however, affirm, that it\r\ncontains nearly the usual proportion of air.\r\n\r\nWater from melted _ice_ does not contain so much air. _Dew_ has been\r\nsupposed to be saturated with air.\r\n\r\nSnow water has long laid under the imputation of occasioning those\r\nstrumous swellings in the neck which deform the inhabitants of many of\r\nthe Alpine vallies; but this opinion is not supported by any\r\nwell-authenticated indisputable facts, and is rendered still more\r\nimprobable, if not entirely overturned, by the frequency of the disease\r\nin Sumatra[12], where ice and snow are never seen.\r\n\r\nIn high northern latitudes, thawed snow forms the constant drink of the\r\ninhabitants during winter; and the vast masses of ice which float on the\r\npolar seas, afford an abundant supply of fresh water to the mariner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spring Water_,\r\n\r\nIncludes well-water and all others that arise from some depth below the\r\nsurface of the earth, and which are used at the fountain-head, or at\r\nleast before they have run any considerable distance exposed to the air.\r\nIndeed, springs may be considered as rain water which has passed through\r\nthe fissures of the earth, and, having accumulated at the bottom of\r\ndeclivities, rises again to the surface forming springs and wells. As\r\nwells take their origin at some depth from the surface, and below the\r\ninfluence of the external atmosphere, their temperature is in general\r\npretty uniform during every vicissitude of season, and always several\r\ndegrees lower than the atmosphere. They differ from one another\r\naccording to the nature of the strata through which they issue; for\r\nthough the ingredients usually existing in them are in such minute\r\nquantities as to impart to the water no striking properties, and do not\r\nrender it unfit for common purposes, yet they modify its nature very\r\nconsiderably. Hence the water of some springs is said to be _hard_, of\r\nothers _soft_, some _sweet_, others _brackish_, according to the nature\r\nand degree of the inpregnating ingredients.\r\n\r\nCommon springs are insensibly changed into mineral or medicinal springs,\r\nas their foreign contents become larger or more unusual; or, in some\r\ninstances, they derive medicinal celebrity from the absence of those\r\ningredients usually occurring in spring-water; as, for example, is the\r\ncase with the Malvern spring, which is nearly pure water.\r\n\r\nAlmost all spring-waters possess the property termed _hardness_ in a\r\ngreater or less degree; a property which depends chiefly upon the\r\npresence of super-carbonate, or of sulphate of lime, or of both; and the\r\nquantity of these earthy salts varies very considerably in different\r\ninstances. Mr. Dalton[13] has shewn that one grain of sulphate of lime,\r\ncontained in 2000 grains of water, converts it into the hardest spring\r\nwater that is commonly met with.\r\n\r\nThe waters of deep wells are usually much harder than those of springs\r\nwhich overflow the mouth of the well; but there are some exceptions to\r\nthis rule.\r\n\r\nThe purest springs are those which occur in primitive rocks, or beds of\r\ngravel, or filter through sand or silicious strata. In general, large\r\nsprings are purer than small ones: and our old wells contain finer water\r\nthan those that are new, as the soluble parts through which the water\r\nfilters in channels under ground become gradually washed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_River Water_,\r\n\r\nIs a term applied to every running stream or rivulet exposed to the air,\r\nand always flowing in an open channel. It is formed of spring water,\r\nwhich, by exposure, becomes more pure, and of running land or surface\r\nwater, which, although turbid from particles of the alluvial soil\r\nsuspended in it, is otherwise very pure. It is purest when it runs over\r\na gravelly or rocky bed, and when its course is swift. It is generally\r\nsoft, and more free from earthy salts than spring water; but it usually\r\ncontains less common air and carbonic acid gas; for, by the agitation of\r\na long current, and exposed to the temperature of the atmosphere, part\r\nof its carbonic acid gas is disengaged, and the lime held in solution by\r\nit is in part precipitated, the loss of which contributes to the\r\nsoftness of the water. Its specific gravity thereby becomes less, the\r\ntaste not so harsh, but less fresh and agreeable; and out of a hard\r\nspring is often made a stream of sufficient purity for most of the\r\npurposes where a soft water is required.\r\n\r\nThe water called in this metropolis _New River Water_, contains a minute\r\nportion of muriate of lime, carbonate of lime, and muriate of soda.\r\n\r\nSome streams, however, that arise from clean silicious beds, and flow in\r\na sandy or stony channel, are from the outset remarkably pure; such as\r\nthe mountain lakes and rivulets in the rocky districts of Wales, the\r\nsource of the beautiful waters of the Dee, and numberless other rivers\r\nthat flow through the hollow of every valley. Switzerland has long been\r\ncelebrated for the purity and excellence of its waters, which pour in\r\ncopious streams from the mountains, and give rise to the finest rivers\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nSome rivers, however, that do not take their rise from a rocky soil, and\r\nare indeed at first considerably charged with foreign matter, during a\r\nlong course, even over a richly cultivated plain, become remarkably pure\r\nas to saline contents; but often fouled with mud containing much animal\r\nand vegetable matter, which are rather suspended than held in true\r\nsolution. Such is the water of the river Thames, which, taken up at\r\nLondon at low water mark, is very soft and good; and, after rest, it\r\ncontains but a very small portion of any thing that could prove\r\npernicious, or impede any manufacture. It is also excellently fitted for\r\nsea-store; but it then undergoes a remarkable spontaneous change, when\r\npreserved in wooden casks. No water carried to sea becomes putrid sooner\r\nthan that of the Thames. But the mode now adopted in the navy of\r\nsubstituting iron tanks for wooden casks, tends greatly to obviate this\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nWhoever will consider the situation of the Thames, and the immense\r\npopulation along its banks for so many miles, must at once perceive the\r\nprodigious accumulation of animal matters of all kinds, which by means\r\nof the common sewers constantly make their way into it. These matters\r\nare, no doubt, in part the cause of the putrefaction which it is well\r\nknown to undergo at sea, and of the carburetted and sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen gases which are evolved from it. When a wooden cask is opened,\r\nafter being kept a month or two, a quantity of carburetted and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen escapes, and the water is so black and offensive\r\nas scarcely to be borne. Upon racking it off, however, into large\r\nearthen vessels, and exposing it to the air, it gradually deposits a\r\nquantity of black slimy mud, becomes clear as crystal, and remarkably\r\nsweet and palatable.\r\n\r\nIt might, at first sight, be expected that the water of the Thames,\r\nafter having received all the contents of the sewers, drains, and water\r\ncourses, of a large town, should acquire thereby such impregnation with\r\nforeign matters, as to become very impure; but it appears, from the most\r\naccurate experiments that have been made, that those kinds of impurities\r\nhave no perceptible influence on the salubrious quality of a mass of\r\nwater so immense, and constantly kept in motion by the action of the\r\ntides.\r\n\r\nSome traces of animal matter may, however, be detected in the water of\r\nthe Thames; for if nitrate of lead be dropped into it,[14] \"you will\r\nfind that it becomes milky, and that a white powder falls to the bottom,\r\nwhich dissolves without effervescence in nitric acid. It is, therefore,\r\n(says Dr. Thomson) a combination of oxide of lead with some animal\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTANCES USUALLY CONTAINED IN COMMON WATER, AND TESTS BY WHICH THEY\r\nARE DETECTED.\r\n\r\nTo acquire a knowledge of the general nature of common water, it is only\r\nnecessary to add to it a few chemical tests, which will quickly indicate\r\nthe presence or absence of the substances that may be expected.\r\n\r\nAlmost the only salts contained in common waters are the carbonates,\r\nsulphates, and muriates of soda, lime, and magnesia; and sometimes a\r\nvery minute portion of iron may also be detected in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nFill a wine-glass with distilled water, and add to it a few drops of a\r\nsolution of soap in alcohol, the water will remain transparent.\r\n\r\nThis test is employed for ascertaining the presence of earthy salts in\r\nwaters. Hence it produces no change when mingled with distilled or\r\nperfectly pure water; but when added to water containing earthy salts, a\r\nwhite flocculent matter becomes separated, which speedily collects on\r\nthe surface of the fluid. Now, from the quantity of flocculent matter\r\nproduced, in equal quantities of water submitted to the test, a\r\ntolerable notion may be formed of the degrees of hardness of different\r\nkinds of water, at least so far as regards the fitness of the water for\r\nthe ordinary purposes of domestic economy. This may be rendered obvious\r\nin the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nFill a number of wine-glasses with different kinds of pump or well\r\nwater, and let fall into each glass a few drops of the solution of soap\r\nin alcohol. A turbidness will instantly ensue, and a flocculent matter\r\ncollect on the surface of the fluid, if the mixture be left undisturbed.\r\nThe quantity of flocculent matter will be in the ratio of the quantity\r\nof earthy salts contained in the water.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the action of this test is not discriminative, with\r\nregard to the chemical nature of the earthy salt present in the water.\r\nIt serves only to indicate the _presence_ or _absence_ of those kinds of\r\nsubstances which occasion that quality in water which is usually called\r\n_hardness_, and which is always owing to salts with an earthy base.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to know the nature of the different acids and earths\r\ncontained in the water, the following test may be employed.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nAdd about twenty drops of a solution of oxalate of ammonia, to half a\r\nwine-glass of the water; if a white precipitate ensues, we conclude that\r\nthe water contains lime.\r\n\r\nBy means of this test, one grain of lime may be detected in 24,250 of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIf this test occasion a white precipitate in water taken fresh from the\r\npump or spring, and not after the water has been boiled and suffered to\r\ngrow cold, the lime is dissolved in the water by an excess of carbonic\r\nacid; and if it continues to produce a precipitate in the water which\r\nhas been concentrated by boiling, we then are sure that the lime is\r\ncombined with a fixed acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nTo detect the presence of iron, add to a wine-glassful of the water a\r\nfew drops of an infusion of nut-galls; or better, suffer a nut-gall to\r\nbe suspended in it for twenty-four hours, which will cause the water to\r\nacquire a blueish black colour, if iron be present.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nAdd a few grains of muriate of barytes, to half a wine-glass of the\r\nwater to be examined; if it produces a turbidness which does not\r\ndisappear by the admixture of a few drops of muriatic acid, the presence\r\nof sulphuric acid is rendered obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nIf a few drops of a solution of nitrate of silver occasions a milkiness\r\nwith the water, which vanishes again by the copious addition of liquid\r\nammonia, we have reason to believe that the water contains a salt, one\r\nof the constituent parts of which is muriatic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nIf lime water or barytic water occasions a precipitate which again\r\nvanishes by the admixture of muriatic acid, then carbonic acid is\r\npresent in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nIf a solution of phosphate of soda produces a milkiness with the water,\r\nafter a previous addition to it of a similar quantity of neutral\r\ncarbonate of ammonia, we may then expect magnesia. The application of\r\nthis test is best made in the following manner:\r\n\r\nConcentrate a quantity of the water to be examined to about 1/20 part of\r\nits bulk, and drop into about half a wine-glassful, about five grains of\r\nneutral carbonate of ammonia. No magnesia becomes yet precipitated if\r\nthis earth be present; but on adding a like quantity of phosphate of\r\nsoda, the magnesia falls down, as an insoluble salt. It is essential\r\nthat the carbonate of ammonia be neutral.\r\n\r\nThis test was first pointed out by Dr. Wollaston.\r\n\r\nThe presence of oxygen gas loosely combined in water may readily be\r\ndiscovered in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nFill a vial with water, and add to it a small quantity of green sulphate\r\nof iron. If the water be entirely free of oxygen, and if the vessel be\r\nwell stopped and completely filled, the solution is transparent; but if\r\notherwise, it soon becomes slightly turbid, from the oxide of iron\r\nattracting the oxygen, and a small portion of it, in this more highly\r\noxidated state, leaving the acid and being precipitated. Or, according\r\nto a method pointed out by Driessen, the water is to be boiled for two\r\nhours in a flask filled with it, and immersed in a vessel of water kept\r\nboiling, with the mouth of the flask under the surface of the water: it\r\nis to be inverted in quicksilver, taking care that no air-bubble adheres\r\nto the side of the flask, and being tinged with infusion of litmus, a\r\nlittle nitrous gas is to be introduced: if the oxygen gas has been\r\nsufficiently expelled from the water, the purple colour of the litmus\r\ndoes not change; while, if oxygen be present, it immediately becomes\r\nred.[16]\r\n\r\nIf we examine the different waters which are used for the ordinary\r\npurposes of life, and judge of them by the above tests, we shall find\r\nthem to differ considerably from each other. Some contain a large\r\nquantity of saline and earthy matters, whilst others are nearly pure.\r\nThe differences are produced by the great solvent power which water\r\nexercises upon most substances. Wells should never be lined with bricks,\r\nwhich render soft water hard; or, if bricks be employed, they should be\r\nbedded in and covered with cement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE RELATIVE QUANTITY OF EACH OF THE DIFFERENT\r\nSUBSTANCES USUALLY CONTAINED IN COMMON WATER.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the quantity of earthy and saline matter contained in\r\nwater, the following is the most simple and easy method.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nPut any measured quantity of the water into a platina, or silver\r\nevaporating basin, the weight of which is known, and evaporate the water\r\nupon a steam bath, at a temperature of about 180°, nearly to dryness;\r\nand, lastly, remove the basin to a sand bath, and let the mass be\r\nevaporated to perfect dryness. The weight of the platina basin being\r\nalready known, we have only to weigh it carefully. When the solid saline\r\ncontents of the water is attached to it, the increase of weight gives\r\nthe quantity of solid matter contained in a given quantity of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nPour upon the saline contents a quantity of distilled water equal to\r\nthat in which the obtained salts were originally dissolved. If the whole\r\nsaline matter become dissolved in this water, there is reason to believe\r\nthat the saline matter has not been altered during the evaporation of\r\nthe water. But if a portion remain undissolved, as is usually the case,\r\nthen we may conclude that some of the salts have mutually decomposed\r\neach other, when brought into a concentrated state by the evaporation,\r\nand that salts have been formed which did not originally exist in the\r\nwater before its evaporation.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that almost the only salts contained in common\r\nwaters, are the carbonates, sulphates, and muriates, of soda, lime, and\r\nmagnesia; and sometimes a very minute portion of iron. Having determined\r\nthe different acids and bases present, in the manner stated at p. 49, we\r\nmay easily ascertain the relative weight of each.\r\n\r\nThe following formula suggested by Dr. Murray,[17] is fully as accurate\r\na means of analysing waters as any other, and it is easy of execution.\r\nThe weight of the saline ingredients of a given quantity of water being\r\ndetermined, we may proceed to the accurate analysis of it in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nMeasure out a determinate volume of the water (as 500 or 1000 cubic\r\ninches,) and evaporate it gradually, in an unglazed open vessel defended\r\nfrom dust, to one third of its original bulk; then divide this\r\nevaporated liquid into three equal portions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nDrop into the first portion, muriate of barytes; wash the precipitate,\r\ncollect it, dry it at a red heat upon platina foil, and weigh it; digest\r\nit in nitric acid, dry it, and weigh it again. The loss of weight\r\nindicates the quantity of carbonate of barytes which the precipitate\r\ncontained. The residual weight is sulphate of barytes; the carbonic acid\r\nin the water is equivalent to 0,22 of the weight of the carbonate of\r\nbarytes; the sulphuric acid to 0,339 of the weight of the sulphate of\r\nbarytes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nPrecipitate the second portion of the concentrated water, by the\r\naddition of nitrate of silver; wash the precipitate, dry it, and fuse it\r\non a piece of foil platina, previously weighed. By weighing the foil\r\ncontaining the fused chloride of silver, the weight of the precipitate\r\nmay be ascertained. The fourth part of this weight is equivalent to the\r\nweight of the muriatic acid contained in the portion of water\r\nprecipitated.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nPrecipitate the third portion of the water by the addition of oxalate of\r\nammonia; wash and dry the precipitate; expose it to a red heat, on a\r\nplatina foil, or in a capsule of platina; pour on it some dilute\r\nsulphuric acid; digest for some time, then evaporate to dryness, expose\r\nthe capsule to a pretty strong heat, and, lastly, weigh the sulphate of\r\nlime thus produced: 0.453 of its weight indicate the quantity of lime in\r\nthe portion of water precipitated.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nAdd to the same third portion of the water thus freed from lime, a\r\nportion of a solution of neutral carbonate of ammonia, and then add\r\nphosphoric acid, drop by drop, as long as any precipitate falls down.\r\nWash the precipitate, dry it, and expose it to a red heat in a platina\r\ncapsule: it is phosphate of magnesia. 0.357 of the weight of this salt\r\nis equivalent to the weight of the magnesia contained in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nIf the water contain a minute portion of iron, a quantity of it equal to\r\none of the three preceding portions, must be taken and mixed with a\r\nsolution of benzoate of ammonia. The precipitate being washed, dried,\r\nand exposed to a red heat, and weighed, nine-tenths of its weight\r\nindicate the weight of protoxide of iron contained in the water.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the quantity of all the substances contained in the water\r\nwill be ascertained, except there be any soda. To know the amount of it,\r\nthe following method, pointed out by Dr. Murray, answers very well.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nEvaporate a portion of the water to one third of its bulk. Precipitate\r\nthe carbonic and sulphuric acids by the addition of muriate of barytes,\r\ntaking care not to add any excess of the tests.\r\n\r\nPrecipitate the lime by oxalate of ammonia, and the magnesia by\r\ncarbonate of ammonia and phosphoric acid. (Page 52.) Then evaporate the\r\nliquid thus treated to dryness. A quantity of common salt will remain:\r\nlet this be exposed to a red heat; 0.4 of its weight indicate the sodium\r\ncontained in the bulk of water employed; and 0.4 sodium are equivalent\r\nto 0.53 of soda.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly requisite to mention some other substances that\r\noccasionally make their appearance in the waters used for domestic\r\npurposes. A fine divided sand is a common constituent, which is easily\r\nobtained in a separate state. We have only to evaporate a portion of the\r\nwater to dryness, and redissolve the saline residue in distilled water.\r\nThe silicious sand remains undissolved, and betrays itself by its\r\ninsolubility in acids, and its easy fusibility into a transparant glass,\r\nwith soda, before the blow-pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF KEEPING WATER FOR DOMESTIC ECONOMY IN LEADEN\r\nRESERVOIRS.\r\n\r\nThe deleterious effect of lead, when taken into the stomach, is at\r\npresent so universally known, that it is quite unnecessary to adduce\r\nany argument in proof of its dangerous tendency.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were, upwards of 2000 years ago, as well aware of the\r\npernicious quality of this metal as we are at the present day; and\r\nindeed they appeared to have been much more apprehensive of its effects,\r\nand scrupulous in the application of it to purposes of domestic economy.\r\n\r\nTheir precautions may have been occasionally carried to an unnecessary\r\nlength. This was the natural consequence of the imperfect state of\r\nexperimental knowledge at that period. When men were unable to detect\r\nthe poisonous matters--to be over scrupulous in the use of such water,\r\nwas an error on the right side.\r\n\r\nThe moderns, on the other hand, in part, perhaps, from an ill-founded\r\nconfidence, and inattention to a careful and continued examination of\r\nits effects, have fallen into an opposite error.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the mode of preserving water intended for\r\nfood or drink in leaden reservoirs, is exceedingly improper; and\r\nalthough pure water exercises no sensible action upon metallic lead,\r\nprovided air be excluded, the metal is certainly acted on by the water\r\nwhen air is admitted: this effect is so obvious, that it cannot escape\r\nthe notice of the least attentive observer.\r\n\r\nThe white line which may be seen at the surface of the water preserved\r\nin leaden cisterns, where the metal touches the water and where the air\r\nis admitted, is a carbonate of lead, formed at the expense of the metal.\r\nThis substance, when taken into the stomach, is highly deleterious to\r\nhealth. This was the reason which induced the ancients to condemn leaden\r\npipes for the conveyance of water; it having been remarked that persons\r\nwho swallowed the sediment of such water, became affected with disorders\r\nof the bowels.[18]\r\n\r\nLeaden water reservoirs were condemned in ancient times by Hyppocrates,\r\nGalen, and Vitruvius, as dangerous: in addition to which, we may depend\r\non the observations of Van Swieten, Tronchin, and others, who have\r\nquoted numerous unhappy examples of whole families poisoned by water\r\nwhich had remained in reservoirs of lead. Dr. Johnston, Dr. Percival,\r\nSir George Baker, and Dr. Lamb, have likewise recorded numerous\r\ninstances where dangerous diseases ensued from the use of water\r\nimpregnated with lead.\r\n\r\nDifferent potable waters have unequal solvent powers on this metal. In\r\nsome places the use of leaden pumps has been discontinued, from the\r\nexpense entailed upon the proprietors by the constant want of repair.\r\nDr. Lamb[19] states an instance where the proprietor of a well ordered\r\nhis plumber to make the lead of a pump of double the thickness of the\r\nmetal usually employed for pumps, to save the charge of repairs; because\r\nhe had observed that the water was so hard, as he called it, that it\r\ncorroded the lead very soon.\r\n\r\nThe following instance is related by Sir George Baker:[20]\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman was the father of a numerous offspring, having had\r\none-and-twenty children, of whom eight died young, and thirteen survived\r\ntheir parents. During their infancy, and indeed _until they had quitted\r\nthe place of their usual residence, they were all remarkably unhealthy_;\r\nbeing particularly subject to disorders of the stomach and bowels. The\r\nfather, during many years, was paralytic; the mother, for a long time,\r\nwas subject to colics and bilious obstructions.\r\n\r\n\"After the death of the parents, the family sold the house which they\r\nhad so long inhabited. The purchaser found it necessary to repair the\r\npump. This was made of lead; which, upon examination was found to be so\r\ncorroded, that several perforations were observed in the cylinder, in\r\nwhich the bucket plays; and the cistern in the upper part was reduced to\r\nthe thinness of common brown paper, and was full of holes, like a\r\nsieve.\"\r\n\r\nI have myself seen numerous instances where leaden cisterns have been\r\ncompletely corroded by the action of water with which they were in\r\ncontact: and there is, perhaps, not a plumber who cannot give testimony\r\nof having experienced numerous similar instances in the practice of his\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nI have been frequently called upon to examine leaden cisterns, which had\r\nbecome leaky on account of the action of the water which they contained;\r\nand I could adduce an instance of a legal controversy having taken place\r\nto settle the disputes between the proprietors of an estate and a\r\nplumber, originating from a similar cause--the plumber being accused of\r\nhaving furnished a faulty reservoir; whereas the case was proved to be\r\nowing to the chemical action of the water on the lead. Water containing\r\na large quantity of common air and carbonic acid gas, always acts very\r\nsensibly on metallic lead.\r\n\r\nWater, which has no sensible action, in its natural state, upon lead,\r\nmay acquire the capability of acting on it by heterogeneous matter,\r\nwhich it may accidentally receive. Numerous instances have shewn that\r\nvegetable matter, such as leaves, falling into leaden cisterns filled\r\nwith water, imparted to the water a considerable solvent power of action\r\non the lead, which, in its natural state it did not possess. Hence the\r\nnecessity of keeping leaden cisterns clean; and this is the more\r\nnecessary, as their situations expose them to accidental impurities. The\r\nnoted saturnine colic of Amsterdam, described by Tronchin, originated\r\nfrom such a circumstance; as also the case related by Van Swieten,[21]\r\nof a whole family afflicted with the same complaint, from such a\r\ncistern. And it is highly probable that the case of disease recorded by\r\nDr. Duncan,[22] proceeded more from some foulness in the cistern, than\r\nfrom the solvent power of the water. In this instance the officers of\r\nthe packet boat used water for their drink and cooking out of a leaden\r\ncistern, whilst the sailors used the water taken from the same source,\r\nexcept that theirs was kept in wooden vessels. The consequence was, that\r\nall the officers were seized with the colic, and all the men continued\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\nThe carelessness of the bulk of mankind, Dr. Lambe very justly observes,\r\nto these things, \"is so great, that to repeat them again and again\r\ncannot be wholly useless.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the great majority of persons who daily use water kept in\r\nleaden cisterns receive no sensible injury, yet the apparent salubrity\r\nmust be ascribed to the great slowness of its operation, and the\r\nminuteness of the dose taken, the effects of which become modified by\r\ndifferent causes and different constitutions, and according to the\r\npredisposition to diseases inherent in different individuals. The\r\nsupposed security of the multitude who use the water with impunity,\r\namounts to no more than presumption, in favour of any individual, which\r\nmay or may not be confirmed by experience.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the morbid susceptibility of impressions which\r\ndistinguish certain habits, there is, besides, much variety in the\r\noriginal constitution of the human frame, of which we are totally\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\n\"The susceptibility or proneness to disease of each individual, must be\r\nesteemed peculiar to himself. Confiding to the experience of others is a\r\nground of security which may prove fallacious; and the danger can with\r\ncertainty be obviated only by avoiding its source. And considering the\r\nvarious and complicated changes of the human frame, under different\r\ncircumstances and at different ages, it is neither impossible nor\r\nimprobable that the substances taken into the system at one period, and\r\neven for a series of years, with apparent impunity may, notwithstanding,\r\nat another period, be eventually the occasion of disease and of death.\r\n\r\n\"The experience of a single person, or of many persons, however\r\nnumerous, is quite incompetent to the decision of a question of this\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"The pernicious effects of an intemperate use of spiritous liquors is\r\nnot less certain because we often see habitual drunkards enjoy a state\r\nof good health, and arrive at old age: and the same may be said of\r\nindividuals who indulge in vices of all kinds, evidently destructive to\r\nlife; many of whom, in spite of their bad habits, attain to a vigorous\r\nold age.\"[23]\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of these remarks, we adduce the following account of the\r\neffect of water contaminated by lead, given by Sir G. Baker:\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable case on the subject that now occurs to my memory,\r\nis that of Lord Ashburnham's family, in Sussex; to which, spring water\r\nwas supplied, from a considerable distance, in leaden pipes. In\r\nconsequence, his Lordship's servants were every year tormented with\r\ncolic, and some of them died. An eminent physician, of Battle, who\r\ncorresponded with me on the subject, sent up some gallons of that water,\r\nwhich were analysed by Dr. Higgins, who reported that the water had\r\ncontained more than the common quantity of carbonic acid; and that he\r\nfound in it lead in solution, which he attributed to the carbonic acid.\r\nIn consequence of this, Lord Ashburnham substituted wooden for leaden\r\npipes; and from that time his family have had no particular complaints\r\nin their bowels.\"\r\n\r\n_Richmond, Sept. 27, 1802._\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DETECTING LEAD, WHEN CONTAINED IN WATER.\r\n\r\nOne of the most delicate tests for detecting lead, is water impregnated\r\nwith sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which instantly imparts to the fluid\r\ncontaining the minutest quantity of lead, a brown or blackish tinge.\r\n\r\nThis test is so delicate that distilled water, when condensed by a\r\nleaden pipe in a still tub, is affected by it. To shew the action of\r\nthis test, the following experiments will serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nPour into a wine-glass containing distilled water, an equal quantity of\r\nwater impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas: no change will take\r\nplace; but if a 1/4 of a grain of acetate of lead (sugar of lead of\r\ncommerce), or any other preparation of lead, be added, the mixture will\r\ninstantly turn brown and dark-coloured.\r\n\r\nTo apply this test, one part of the suspected water need merely to be\r\nmingled with a like quantity of water impregnated with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen. Or better, a larger quantity, a gallon for example, of the\r\nwater may be concentrated by evaporation to about half a pint, and then\r\nsubmitted to the action of the test.\r\n\r\nAnother and more efficient mode of applying this test, is, to pass a\r\ncurrent of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the suspected water in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTake a bottle (_a_) or Florence flask, adapt to the mouth of it a cork\r\nfurnished with a glass tube (_b_), bent at right angles; let one leg of\r\nthe tube be immersed in the vial (_c_) containing the water to be\r\nexamined; as shewn in the following sketch. Then take one part of\r\nsulphuret of antimony of commerce, break it into pieces of half the size\r\nof split pease, put it into the flask, and pour upon it four parts of\r\ncommon concentrated muriatic acid (spirit of salt of commerce).\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen gas will become disengaged from the materials in\r\nabundance, and pass through the water in the vial (_c_). Let the\r\nextrication of the gas be continued for about five minutes; and if the\r\nminutest quantity of lead be present, the water will acquire a\r\ndark-brown or blackish tinge. The extrication of the gas is facilitated\r\nby the application of a gentle heat.\r\n\r\nThe action of the sulphuretted hydrogen test, when applied in this\r\nmanner, is astonishingly great; for one part of acetate of lead may be\r\ndetected by means of it, in 20000 parts of water.[24]\r\n\r\nAnother test for readily detecting lead in water, is sulphuretted\r\nchyazate of potash, first pointed out as such by Mr. Porret. A few drops\r\nof this re-agent, added to water containing lead, occasion a white\r\nprecipitate, consisting of small brilliant scales of a considerable\r\nlustre.\r\n\r\nSulphate of potash, or sulphate of soda, is likewise a very delicate\r\ntest for detecting minute portions of lead. Dr. Thomson[25] discovered,\r\nby means of it, one part of lead in 100000 parts of water; and this\r\nacute Philosopher considers it as the most unequivocal test of lead that\r\nwe possess. Dr. Thomson remarks that \"no other precipitate can well be\r\nconfounded with it, except sulphate of barytes; and there is no\r\nprobability of the presence of barytes existing in common water.\"\r\n\r\nCarbonate of potash, or carbonate of soda, may also be used as agents to\r\ndetect the presence of lead. By means of these salts Dr. Thomson was\r\nenabled to detect the presence of a smaller quantity of lead in\r\ndistilled water, than by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen. But the\r\nreader must here be told, that the use of these tests cannot be\r\nentrusted to an unskilful hand; because the alkaline carbonates throw\r\ndown also lime and magnesia, two substances which are frequently found\r\nin common water; the former tests, namely, water impregnated with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas, and nascent sulphuretted hydrogen, are\r\ntherefore preferable.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely essential that the water impregnated with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, when employed as a test for detecting very minute quantities\r\nof lead, be fresh prepared; and if sulphate of potash, or sulphate of\r\nsoda, be used as tests, they should be perfectly pure. Sulphate of\r\npotash is preferable to sulphate of soda. It is likewise advisable to\r\nact with these tests upon water concentrated by boiling. The water to\r\nwhich the test has been added does sometimes appear not to undergo any\r\nchange, at first; it is therefore necessary to suffer the mixture to\r\nstand for a few hours; after which time the action of the test will be\r\nmore evident.

All\r\npersons moderately conversant with the subject, are aware, that a\r\nportion of alum is added to young and meagre red wines, for the purpose\r\nof brightening their colour; that Brazil wood, or the husks of\r\nelderberries and bilberries,[27] are employed to impart a deep rich\r\npurple tint to red Port of a pale, faint colour; that gypsum is used to\r\nrender cloudy white wines transparent;[28] that an additional\r\nastringency is imparted to immature red wines by means of oak-wood\r\nsawdust,[29] and the husks of filberts; and that a mixture of spoiled\r\nforeign and home-made wines is converted into the wretched compound\r\nfrequently sold in this town by the name of _genuine old Port_.\r\n\r\nVarious expedients are resorted to for the purpose of communicating\r\nparticular flavours to insipid wines. Thus a _nutty_ flavour is produced\r\nby bitter almonds; factitious Port wine is flavoured with a tincture\r\ndrawn from the seeds of raisins; and the ingredients employed to form\r\nthe _bouquet_ of high-flavoured wines, are sweet-brier, oris-root,\r\nclary, cherry laurel water, and elder-flowers.\r\n\r\nThe flavouring ingredients used by manufacturers, may all be purchased\r\nby those dealers in wine who are initiated in the mysteries of the\r\ntrade; and even a manuscript recipe book for preparing them, and the\r\nwhole mystery of managing all sorts of wines, may be obtained on payment\r\nof a considerable fee.\r\n\r\nThe sophistication of wine with substances not absolutely noxious to\r\nhealth, is carried to an enormous extent in this metropolis. Many\r\nthousand pipes of spoiled cyder are annually brought hither from the\r\ncountry, for the purpose of being converted into factitious Port wine.\r\nThe art of manufacturing spurious wine is a regular trade of great\r\nextent in this metropolis.\r\n\r\n\"There is, in this city, a certain fraternity of chemical operators, who\r\nwork underground in holes, caverns, and dark retirements, to conceal\r\ntheir mysteries from the eyes and observation of mankind. These\r\nsubterraneous philosophers are daily employed in the transmutation of\r\nliquors; and by the power of magical drugs and incantations, raising\r\nunder the streets of London the choicest products of the hills and\r\nvalleys of France. They can squeeze Bourdeaux out of the sloe, and draw\r\nChampagne from an apple. Virgil, in that remarkable prophecy,\r\n\r\n     _Incultisque ruhens pendebit sentibus uva._\r\n\r\n                                        Virg. Ecl. iv. 29.\r\n\r\n     The ripening grape shall hang on every thorn.\r\n\r\nseems to have hinted at this art, which can turn a plantation of\r\nnorthern hedges into a vineyard. These adepts are known among one\r\nanother by the name of _Wine-brewers_; and, I am afraid, do great\r\ninjury, not only to her Majesty's customs, but to the bodies of many of\r\nher good subjects.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the recipes employed in the manufacture of\r\nspurious wine:\r\n\r\n     To make _British Port Wine_.[31]--\"Take of British grape wine, or\r\n     good cyder, 4 gallons; of the juice of red beet root two quarts;\r\n     brandy, two quarts; logwood 4 ounces; rhatany root, bruised, half a\r\n     pound: first infuse the logwood and rhatany root in brandy, and a\r\n     gallon of grape wine or cyder for one week; then strain off the\r\n     liquor, and mix it with the other ingredients; keep it in a cask\r\n     for a month, when it will be fit to bottle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _British Champagne._--\"Take of white sugar, 8 pounds; the whitest\r\n     brown sugar, 7 pounds, crystalline lemon acid, or tartaric acid, 1\r\n     ounce and a quarter, pure water, 8 gallons; white grape wine, two\r\n     quarts, or perry, 4 quarts; of French brandy, 3 pints.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Put the sugar in the water, skimming it occasionally for two\r\n     hours, then pour it into a tub and dissolve in it the acid; before\r\n     it is cold, add some yeast and ferment. Put it into a clean cask\r\n     and add the other ingredients. The cask is then to be well bunged,\r\n     and kept in a cool place for two or three months; then bottle it\r\n     and keep it cool for a month longer, when it will be fit for use.\r\n     If it should not be perfectly clear after standing in the cask two\r\n     or three months, it should be rendered so by the use of isinglass.\r\n     By adding 1 lb. of fresh or preserved strawberries, and 2 ounces of\r\n     powdered cochineal, the PINK _Champagne may be made_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Southampton Port._[32]--\"Take cyder, 36 gallons; elder wine, 11\r\n     gallons; brandy, 5 gallons; damson wine, 11 gallons; mix.\"\r\n\r\nThe particular and separate department in this factitious wine trade,\r\ncalled _crusting_, consists in lining the interior surface of empty\r\nwine-bottles, in part, with a red crust of super-tartrate of potash, by\r\nsuffering a saturated hot solution of this salt, coloured red with a\r\ndecoction of Brazil-wood, to crystallize within them; and after this\r\nsimulation of maturity is perfected, they are filled with the compound\r\ncalled Port wine.\r\n\r\nOther artisans are regularly employed in staining the lower extremities\r\nof bottle-corks with a fine red colour, to appear, on being drawn, as if\r\nthey had been long in contact with the wine.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of an astringent extract, to produce, from spoiled\r\nhome-made and foreign wines, a \"genuine old Port,\" by mere admixture; or\r\nto impart to a weak wine a rough austere taste, a fine colour, and a\r\npeculiar flavour; forms one branch of the business of particular\r\nwine-coopers: while the mellowing and restoring of spoiled white wines,\r\nis the sole occupation of men who are called _refiners of wine_.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that a crystalline crust is formed on the interior\r\nsurface of bottles, for the purpose of misleading the unwary into a\r\nbelief that the wine contained in them is of a certain age. A\r\ncorrespondent operation is performed on the wooden cask; the whole\r\ninterior of which is stained artificially with a crystalline crust of\r\nsuper-tartrate of potash, artfully affixed in a manner precisely similar\r\nto that before stated. Thus the wine-merchant, after bottling off a\r\npipe of wine, is enabled to impose on the understanding of his\r\ncustomers, by taking to pieces the cask, and exhibiting the beautiful\r\ndark coloured and fine crystalline crust, as an indubitable proof of the\r\nage of the wine; a practice by no means uncommon, to flatter the vanity\r\nof those who pride themselves in their acute discrimination of wines.\r\n\r\nThese and many other sophistications, which have long been practised\r\nwith impunity, are considered as legitimate by those who pride\r\nthemselves for their skill in the art of _managing_, or, according to\r\nthe familiar phrase, _doctoring_ wines. The plea alleged in exculpation\r\nof them, is, that, though deceptive, they are harmless: but even\r\nadmitting this as a palliation, yet they form only one department of an\r\nart which includes other processes of a tendency absolutely criminal.\r\n\r\nSeveral well-authenticated facts have convinced me that the adulteration\r\nof wine with substances deleterious to health, is certainly practised\r\noftener than is, perhaps, suspected; and it would be easy to give some\r\ninstances of very serious effects having arisen from wines contaminated\r\nwith deleterious substances, were this a subject on which I meant to\r\nspeak. The following statement is copied from the Monthly Magazine for\r\nMarch 1811, p. 188.\r\n\r\n\"On the 17th of January, the passengers by the Highflyer coach, from the\r\nnorth, dined, as usual, at Newark. A bottle of Port wine was ordered; on\r\ntasting which, one of the passengers observed that it had an unpleasant\r\nflavour, and begged that it might be changed. The waiter took away the\r\nbottle, poured into a fresh decanter half the wine which had been\r\nobjected to, and filled it up from another bottle. This he took into the\r\nroom, and the greater part was drank by the passengers, who, after the\r\ncoach had set out towards Grantham, were seized with extreme sickness;\r\none gentleman in particular, who had taken more of the wine than the\r\nothers, it was thought would have died, but has since recovered. The\r\nhalf of the bottle of wine sent out of the passengers' room, was put\r\naside for the purpose of mixing negus. In the evening, Mr. Bland, of\r\nNewark, went into the hotel, and drank a glass or two of wine and water.\r\nHe returned home at his usual hour, and went to bed; in the middle of\r\nthe night he was taken so ill, as to induce Mrs. Bland to send for his\r\nbrother, an apothecary in the town; but before that gentleman arrived,\r\nhe was dead. An inquest was held, and the jury, after the fullest\r\nenquiry, and the examination of the surgeons by whom the body was\r\nopened, returned a verdict of--_Died by Poison._\"\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous adulteration of wine is by some preparations of lead,\r\nwhich possess the property of stopping the progress of acescence of\r\nwine, and also of rendering white wines, when muddy, transparent. I have\r\ngood reason to state that lead is certainly employed for this purpose.\r\nThe effect is very rapid; and there appears to be no other method known,\r\nof rapidly recovering ropy wines. Wine merchants persuade themselves\r\nthat the minute quantity of lead employed for that purpose is perfectly\r\nharmless, and that no atom of lead remains in the wine. Chemical\r\nanalysis proves the contrary; and the practice of clarifying spoiled\r\nwhite wines by means of lead, must be pronounced as highly deleterious.\r\n\r\nLead, in whatever state it be taken into the stomach, occasions terrible\r\ndiseases; and wine, adulterated with the minutest quantity of it,\r\nbecomes a slow poison. The merchant or dealer who practises this\r\ndangerous sophistication, adds the crime of murder to that of fraud, and\r\ndeliberately scatters the seeds of disease and death among those\r\nconsumers who contribute to his emolument. If to debase the current\r\ncoin of the realm be denounced as a capital offence, what punishment\r\nshould be awarded against a practice which converts into poison a liquor\r\nused for sacred purposes.\r\n\r\nDr. Watson[33] relates, that the method of adulterating wine with lead,\r\nwas at one time a common practice in Paris.\r\n\r\nDr. Warren[34] states an instance of thirty-two persons having become\r\nseverely ill, after drinking white wine that had been adulterated with\r\nlead. One of them died, and one became paralytic.\r\n\r\nIn Graham's Treatise on Wine-Making,[35] under the article of _Secrets_,\r\nbelonging to the mysteries of vintners, p. 31, lead is recommended to\r\nprevent wine from becoming acid. The following lines are copied from Mr.\r\nGraham's work:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_To hinder Wine from turning._\r\n\r\n    \"Put a pound of melted lead, in fair water, into your cask, pretty\r\n    warm, and stop it close.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_To soften Grey Wine._\r\n\r\n    \"Put in a little vinegar wherein litharge has been well steeped, and\r\n    boil some honey, to draw out the wax. Strain it through a cloth, and\r\n    put a quart of it into a tierce of wine, and this will mend it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancients knew that lead rendered harsh wines milder, and preserved\r\nit from acidity, without being aware that it was pernicious: it was\r\ntherefore long used with confidence; and when its effects were\r\ndiscovered, they were not ascribed to that metal, but to some other\r\ncause.[36] When the Greek and Roman wine merchants wished to try whether\r\ntheir wine was spoiled, they immersed in it a plate of lead;[37] if the\r\ncolour of the lead were corroded, they concluded that their wine was\r\nspoiled. Wine may become accidentally impregnated with lead.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that bottles in which wine has been kept, are usually\r\ncleaned by means of shot, which by its rolling motion detaches the\r\nsuper-tartrate of potash from the sides of the bottles. This practice,\r\nwhich is generally pursued by wine-merchants, may give rise to serious\r\nconsequences, as will become evident from the following case:[38]\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman who had never in his life experienced a day's illness, and\r\nwho was constantly in the habit of drinking half a bottle of Madeira\r\nwine after his dinner, was taken ill, three hours after dinner, with a\r\nsevere pain in the stomach and violent bowel colic, which gradually\r\nyielded within twelve hours to the remedies prescribed by his medical\r\nadviser. The day following he drank the remainder of the same bottle of\r\nwine which was left the preceding day, and within two hours afterwards\r\nhe was again seized with the most violent colliquative pains, headach,\r\nshiverings, and great pain over the whole body. His apothecary becoming\r\nsuspicious that the wine he had drank might be the cause of the\r\ndisease, ordered the bottle from which the wine had been decanted to be\r\nbrought to him, with a view that he might examine the dregs, if any were\r\nleft. The bottle happening to slip out of the hand of the servant,\r\ndisclosed a row of shot wedged forcibly into the angular bent-up\r\ncircumference of it. On examining the beads of shot, they crumbled into\r\ndust, the outer crust (defended by a coat of black lead with which the\r\nshot is glazed) being alone left unacted on, whilst the remainder of the\r\nmetal was dissolved. The wine, therefore, had become contaminated with\r\n_lead and arsenic_, the shot being a compound of these metals, which no\r\ndoubt had produced the mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST FOR DETECTING THE DELETERIOUS ADULTERATIONS OF WINE.\r\n\r\nA ready re-agent for detecting the presence of lead, or any other\r\ndeleterious metal in wine, is known by the name of the _wine test_. It\r\nconsists of water saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, acidulated\r\nwith muriatic acid. By adding one part of it, to two of wine, or any\r\nother liquid suspected to contain lead, a dark coloured or black\r\nprecipitate will fall down, which does not disappear by an addition of\r\nmuriatic acid; and this precipitate, dried and fused before the blowpipe\r\non a piece of charcoal, yields a globule of metallic lead. This test\r\ndoes not precipitate iron; the muriatic acid retains iron in solution\r\nwhen combined with sulphuretted hydrogen; and any acid in the wine has\r\nno effect in precipitating any of the sulphur of the test liquor. Or a\r\nstill more efficacious method is, to pass a current of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen gas through the wine, in the manner described, p. 70, having\r\npreviously acidulated the wine with muriatic acid.\r\n\r\nThe wine test sometimes employed is prepared in the following\r\nmanner:--Mix equal parts of finely powdered sulphur and of slacked\r\nquick-lime, and expose it to a red heat for twenty minutes. To\r\nthirty-six grains of this sulphuret of lime, add twenty-six grains of\r\nsuper-tartrate of potassa; put the mixture into an ounce bottle, and\r\nfill up the bottle with water that has been previously boiled, and\r\nsuffered to cool. The liquor, after having been repeatedly shaken, and\r\nallowed to become clear, by the subsidence of the undissolved matter,\r\nmay then be poured into another phial, into which about twenty drops of\r\nmuriatic acid have been previously put. It is then ready for use. This\r\ntest, when mingled with wine containing lead or copper, turns the wine\r\nof a dark-brown or black colour. But the mere application of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas to wine, acidulated by muriatic acid, is a far\r\nmore preferable mode of detecting lead in wine.\r\n\r\nM. Vogel[39] has lately recommended acetate of lead as a test for\r\ndetecting extraneous colours in red wine. He remarks, that none of the\r\nsubstances that can be employed for colouring wine, such as the berries\r\nof the Vaccinium Mirtillus (bilberries), elderberries, and Campeach\r\nwood, produce with genuine red wine, a greenish grey precipitate, which\r\nis the colour that is procured by this test by means of genuine red\r\nwines.\r\n\r\nWine coloured with the juice of the bilberries, or elderberries, or\r\nCampeach wood, produces, with acetate of lead, a deep blue precipitate;\r\nand Brazil-wood, red saunders, and the red beet, produce a colour which\r\nis precipitated red by acetate of lead. Wine coloured by beet root is\r\nalso rendered colourless by lime water; but the weakest acid brings back\r\nthe colour. As the colouring matter of red wines resides in the skin of\r\nthe grape, M. Vogel prepared a quantity of skins, and reduced them to\r\npowder. In this state he found that they communicated to alcohol a deep\r\nred colour: a paper stained with this colour was rendered red by acids\r\nand green by alkalies.\r\n\r\nM. Vogel made a quantity of red wine from black grapes, for the purpose\r\nof his experiments; and this produced the genuine greyish green\r\nprecipitate with acetate of lead. He also found the same coloured\r\nprecipitate in two specimens of red wine, the genuineness of which could\r\nnot be suspected; the one from Chateau-Marguaux, and the other from the\r\nneighbourhood of Coblentz.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES, AND COMPONENT PARTS OF WINE.\r\n\r\nEvery body knows that no product of the arts varies so much as wine;\r\nthat different countries, and sometimes the different provinces of the\r\nsame country, produce different wines. These differences, no doubt, must\r\nbe attributed chiefly to the climate in which the vineyard is\r\nsituated--to its culture--the quantity of sugar contained in the grape\r\njuice--the manufacture of the wine; or the mode of suffering its\r\nfermentation to be accomplished. If the grapes be gathered unripe, the\r\nwine abounds with acid; but if the fruit be gathered ripe, the wine will\r\nbe rich. When the proportion of sugar in the grape is sufficient, and\r\nthe fermentation complete, the wine is perfect and generous. If the\r\nquantity of sugar be too large, part of it remains undecomposed, as the\r\nfermentation is languid, and the wine is sweet and luscious; if, on the\r\ncontrary, it contains, even when full ripe, only a small portion of\r\nsugar, the wine is thin and weak; and if it be bottled before the\r\nfermentation be completed, part of the sugar remains undecomposed, the\r\nfermentation will go on slowly in the bottle, and, on drawing the cork,\r\nthe wine sparkles in the glass; as, for example, Champagne. Such wines\r\nare not sufficiently mature. When the must is separated from the husk of\r\nthe red grape before it is fermented, the wine has little or no colour:\r\nthese are called _white_ wines. If, on the contrary, the husks are\r\nallowed to remain in the must while the fermentation is going on, the\r\nalcohol dissolves the colouring matter of the husks, and the wine is\r\ncoloured: such are called _red_ wines. Hence white wines are often\r\nprepared from red grapes, the liquor being drawn off before it has\r\nacquired the red colour; for the skin of the grape only gives the\r\ncolour. Besides in these principal circumstances, wines vary much in\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nAll wines contain one common and identical principle, from which their\r\nsimilar effects are produced; namely, _brandy_ or _alcohol_. It is\r\nespecially by the different proportions of brandy contained in wines,\r\nthat they differ most from one another. When wine is distilled, the\r\nalcohol readily separates. The spirit thus obtained is well known under\r\nthe name of _brandy_.\r\n\r\nAll wines contain also a free acid; hence they turn blue tincture of\r\ncabbage, red. The acid found in the greatest abundance in grape wines,\r\nis tartaric acid. Every wine contains likewise a portion of\r\nsuper-tartrate of potash, and extractive matter, derived from the juice\r\nof the grape. These substances deposit slowly in the vessel in which\r\nthey are kept. To this is owing the improvement of wine from age. Those\r\nwines which effervesce or froth, when poured into a glass, contain also\r\ncarbonic acid, to which their briskness is owing. The peculiar flavour\r\nand odour of different kinds of wines probably depend upon the presence\r\nof a _volatile oil_, so small in quantity that it cannot be separated.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASY METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE QUANTITY OF BRANDY CONTAINED IN VARIOUS\r\nSORTS OF WINE.\r\n\r\nThe strength of all wines depends upon the quantity of alcohol or brandy\r\nwhich they contain. Mr. Brande, and Gay-Lussac, have proved, by very\r\ndecisive experiments, that all wines contain brandy or alcohol ready\r\nformed. The following is the process discovered by Mr. Brande, for\r\nascertaining the quantity of spirit, or brandy, contained in different\r\nsorts of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nAdd to eight parts, by measure, of the wine to be examined, one part of\r\na concentrated solution of sub-acetate of lead: a dense insoluble\r\nprecipitate will ensue; which is a combination of the test liquor with\r\nthe colouring, extractive, and acid matter of the wine. Shake the\r\nmixture for a few minutes, pour the whole upon a filtre, and collect the\r\nfiltered fluid. It contains the brandy or spirit, and water of the wine,\r\ntogether with a portion of the sub-acetate of lead. Add, in small\r\nquantities at a time, to this fluid, warm, dry, and pure sub-carbonate\r\nof potash (_not salt of tartar, or sub-carbonate of potash of\r\ncommerce_), which has previously been freed from water by heat, till the\r\nlast portion added remains undissolved. The brandy or spirit contained\r\nin the fluid will become separated; for the sub-carbonate of potash\r\nabstracts from it the whole of the water with which it was combined; the\r\nbrandy or spirit of wine forming a distinct stratum, which floats upon\r\nthe aqueous solution of the alkaline salt.

Of such, we have in this country the gooseberry, the currant,\r\nthe elderberry, the cherry, &c. which ferment well, and affords what are\r\ncalled _home-made wines_.\r\n\r\nThey differ chiefly from foreign wines in containing a much larger\r\nquantity of acid. Dr. Macculloch[42] has remarked that the acid in\r\nhome-made wines is principally the malic acid; while in grape wines it\r\nis the tartaric acid.\r\n\r\nThe great deficiency in these wines, independent of the flavour, which\r\nchiefly originates, not from the juice, but from the seeds and husks of\r\nthe fruits, is the excess of acid, which is but imperfectly concealed by\r\nthe addition of sugar. This is owing, chiefly, as Dr. Macculloch\r\nremarks, to the tartaric acid existing in the grape juice in the state\r\nof super-tartrate of potash, which is in part decomposed during the\r\nfermentation, and the rest becomes gradually precipitated; whilst the\r\nmalic acid exists in the currant and gooseberry juice in the form of\r\nmalate of potash; which salt does not appear to suffer a decomposition\r\nduring the fermentation of the wine; and, by its greater solubility, is\r\nretained in the wine. Hence Dr. Macculloch recommends the addition of\r\nsuper-tartrate of potash, in the manufacture of British wines. They also\r\ncontain a much larger proportion of mucilage than wines made from\r\ngrapes. The juice of the gooseberry contains some portion of tartaric\r\nacid; hence it is better suited for the production of what is called\r\n_English Champagne_, than any other fruit of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Dried bilberries are imported from Germany, under the fallacious\r\nname of _berry-dye_.\r\n\r\n[28] The gypsum had the property of clarifying wines, was known to the\r\nancients. \"The Greeks and Romans put gypsum in their new wines, stirred\r\nit often round, then let it stand for some time; and when it had\r\nsettled, decanted the clear liquor. (_Geopon_, lib. vii. p. 483, 494.)\r\nThey knew that the wine acquired, by this addition, a certain sharpness,\r\nwhich it afterwards lost; but that the good effects of the gypsum were\r\nlasting.\"\r\n\r\n[29] Sawdust for this purpose is chiefly supplied by the ship-builders,\r\nand forms a regular article of commerce of the brewers' druggists.\r\n\r\n[30] Tatler, vol. viii. p. 110, edit. 1797. 8vo.\r\n\r\n[31] Dr. Reece's Gazette of Health, No. 7.\r\n\r\n[32] Supplement to the Pharmacopoeias, p. 245.\r\n\r\n[33] Chemical Essays, vol. viii. p. 369.\r\n\r\n[34] Medical Trans. vol. ii. p. 80.\r\n\r\n[35] This book, which has run through many editions, may be supposed to\r\nhave done some mischief.--In the Vintner's Guide, 4th edit. 1770, p. 67,\r\na lump of sugar of lead, of the size of a walnut, and a table-spoonful\r\nof sal enixum, are directed to be added to a tierce (forty-two gallons)\r\nof muddy wine, _to cure it of its muddiness_.\r\n\r\n[36] Beckman's History of Inventions, vol. i. p. 398.\r\n\r\n[37] Pliny, lib. xiv. cap. 20.\r\n\r\n[38] Philosophical Magazine, 1819, No. 257, p. 229.\r\n\r\n[39] Journ.

This is by far the best treatise published in\r\nthis country on the Manufacture of Home-made Wines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Bread._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the sophistications of the articles of food most commonly\r\npractised in this metropolis, where the goodness of bread is estimated\r\nentirely by its whiteness. It is therefore usual to add a certain\r\nquantity of alum to the dough; this improves the look of the bread very\r\nmuch, and renders it whiter and firmer. Good, white, and porous bread,\r\nmay certainly be manufactured from good wheaten flour alone; but to\r\nproduce the degree of whiteness rendered indispensable by the caprice of\r\nthe consumers in London, it is necessary (unless the very best flour is\r\nemployed,) that the dough should be _bleached_; and no substance has\r\nhitherto been found to answer this purpose better than alum.\r\n\r\nWithout this salt it is impossible to make bread, from the kind of flour\r\nusually employed by the London bakers, so white, as that which is\r\ncommonly sold in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nIf the alum be omitted, the bread has a slight yellowish grey hue--as\r\nmay be seen in the instance of what is called _home-made bread_, of\r\nprivate families. Such bread remains longer moist than bread made with\r\nalum; yet it is not so light, and full of eyes, or porous, and it has\r\nalso a different taste.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of alum requisite to produce the required whiteness and\r\nporosity depends entirely upon the genuineness of the flour, and the\r\nquality of the grain from which the flour is obtained. The mealman makes\r\ndifferent sorts of flour from the same kind of grain. The best flour is\r\nmostly used by the biscuit bakers and pastry cooks, and the inferior\r\nsorts in the making of bread. The bakers' flour is very often made of\r\nthe worst kinds of damaged foreign wheat, and other cereal grains mixed\r\nwith them in grinding the wheat into flour. In this capital, no fewer\r\nthan six distinct kinds of wheaten flour are brought into market. They\r\nare called fine flour, seconds, middlings, fine middlings, coarse\r\nmiddlings, and twenty-penny flour. Common garden beans, and pease, are\r\nalso frequently ground up among the London bread flour.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by several bakers, on whose testimony I can rely,\r\nthat the small profit attached to the bakers' trade, and the bad\r\nquality of the flour, induces the generality of the London bakers to use\r\nalum in the making of their bread.\r\n\r\nThe smallest quantity of alum that can be employed with effect to\r\nproduce a white, light, and porous bread, from an inferior kind of\r\nflour, I have my own baker's authority to state, is from three to four\r\nounces to a sack of flour, weighing 240 pounds. The alum is either mixed\r\nwell in the form of powder, with a quantity of flour previously made\r\ninto a liquid paste with water, and then incorporated with the dough; or\r\nthe alum is dissolved in the water employed for mixing up the whole\r\nquantity of the flour for making the dough.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the baker intends to convert five bushels, or a sack\r\nof flour, into loaves with the least adulteration practised. He pours\r\nthe flour into the kneading trough, and sifts it through a fine wire\r\nsieve, which makes it lie very light, and serves to separate any\r\nimpurities with which the flour may be mixed. Two ounces of alum are\r\nthen dissolved in about a quart of boiling water, and the solution\r\npoured into _the seasoning-tub_. Four or five pounds of salt are\r\nlikewise put into the tub, and a pailful of hot-water. When this mixture\r\nhas cooled down to the temperature of about 84°, three or four pints of\r\nyeast are added; the whole is mixed, strained through the seasoning\r\nsieve, emptied into a hole in the flour, and mixed up with the requisite\r\nportion of it to the consistence of a thick batter. Some dry flour is\r\nthen sprinkled over the top, and it is covered up with cloths.\r\n\r\nIn this situation it is left about three hours. It gradually swells and\r\nbreaks through the dry flour scattered on its surface. An additional\r\nquantity of warm water, in which one ounce of alum is dissolved, is now\r\nadded, and the dough is made up into a paste as before; the whole is\r\nthen covered up. In this situation it is left for a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe whole is then intimately kneaded with more water for upwards of an\r\nhour. The dough is cut into pieces with a knife, and penned to one side\r\nof the trough; some dry flour is sprinkled over it, and it is left in\r\nthis state for about four hours. It is then kneaded again for\r\nhalf-an-hour. The dough is now cut into pieces and weighed, in order to\r\nfurnish the requisite quantity for each loaf. The loaves are left in the\r\noven about two hours and a half. When taken out, they are carefully\r\ncovered up, to prevent as much as possible the loss of weight.[43]\r\n\r\nThe following account of making a sack, of five bushels of flour into\r\nbread, is taken from Dr. P. Markham's Considerations on the Ingredients\r\nused in the Adulteration of Bread Flour, and Bread, p. 21:\r\n\r\n     5 bushels of flour,\r\n     8 ounces of alum,[44]\r\n     4 lbs. of salt,\r\n     1/2 a gallon of yeast, mixed with about\r\n     3 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                    lbs.\r\n     The whole quantity of bread-flour obtained }\r\n     from the bushel of wheat, weighs           }    48\r\n\r\n                                lbs.\r\n         Fine pollard          4-1/4\r\n         Coarse pollard        4\r\n         Bran                  2-3/4\r\n                               ------                11\r\n                                                     --\r\n     The whole together                              59\r\n\r\n     To which add the loss of weight in }\r\n     manufacturing a bushel of wheat    }             2\r\n                                                     --\r\n         Produces the original weight                61\r\n                                                     --\r\n\r\nThe theory of the bleaching property of alum, as manifested in the\r\npanification of an inferior kind of flour, is by no means well\r\nunderstood; and indeed it is really surprising that the effect should be\r\nproduced by so small a quantity of that substance, two or three ounces\r\nof alum being sufficient for a sack of flour.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments in which I have been employed, with the assistance of\r\nskilful bakers, I am authorised to state, that without the addition of\r\nalum, it does not appear possible to make white, light, and porous\r\nbread, such as is used in this metropolis, unless the flour be of the\r\nvery best quality.\r\n\r\nAnother substance employed by fraudulent bakers, is subcarbonate of\r\nammonia. With this salt, they realise the important consideration of\r\nproducing light and porous bread, from spoiled, or what is technically\r\ncalled _sour flour_. This salt which becomes wholly converted into a\r\ngaseous state during the operation of baking, causes the dough to swell\r\nup into air bubbles, which carry before them the stiff dough, and thus\r\nit renders the dough porous; the salt itself is, at the same time,\r\ntotally volatilised during the operation of baking. Thus not a vestige\r\nof carbonate of ammonia remains in the bread. This salt is also largely\r\nemployed by the biscuit and ginger-bread bakers.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are likewise largely, and perhaps constantly, used by\r\nfraudulent bakers, as a cheap ingredient, to enhance their profit. The\r\npotatoes being boiled, are triturated, passed through a sieve, and\r\nincorporated with the dough by kneading. This adulteration does not\r\nmaterially injure the bread. The bakers assert, that the bad quality of\r\nthe flour renders the addition of potatoes advantageous as well to the\r\nbaker as to the purchaser, and that without this admixture in the\r\nmanufacture of bread, it would be impossible to carry on the trade of a\r\nbaker. But the grievance is, that the same price is taken for a potatoe\r\nloaf, as for a loaf of genuine bread, though it must cost the baker\r\nless.\r\n\r\nI have witness, that five bushels of flour, three ounces of alum, six\r\npounds of salt, one bushel of potatoes boiled into a stiff paste, and\r\nthree quarts of yeast, with the requisite quantity of water, produce a\r\nwhite, light, and highly palatable bread.\r\n\r\nSuch are the artifices practised in the preparation of bread,[45] and it\r\nmust be allowed, on contrasting them with those sophistications\r\npractised by manufacturers of other articles of food, that they are\r\ncomparatively unimportant. However, some medical men have no hesitation\r\nin attributing many diseases incidental to children to the use of eating\r\nadulterated bread; others again will not admit these allegations: they\r\npersuade themselves that the small quantity of alum added to the bread\r\n(perhaps upon an average, from eight to ten grains to a quartern loaf,)\r\nis absolutely harmless.\r\n\r\nDr. Edmund Davy, Professor of Chemistry, at the Cork Institution, has\r\ncommunicated the following important facts to the public concerning the\r\nmanufacture of bread.\r\n\r\n\"The carbonate of magnesia of the shops, when well mixed with flour, in\r\nthe proportion of from twenty to forty grains to a pound of flour,\r\nmaterially improves it for the purpose of making bread.\r\n\r\n\"Loaves made with the addition of carbonate of magnesia, rise well in\r\nthe oven; and after being baked, the bread is light and spongy, has a\r\ngood taste, and keeps well. In cases when the new flour is of an\r\nindifferent quality, from twenty to thirty grains of carbonate of\r\nmagnesia to a pound of the flour will considerably improve the bread.\r\nWhen the flour is of the worst quality, forty grains to a pound of flour\r\nseem necessary to produce the same effect.\r\n\r\n\"As the improvement in the bread from new flour depends upon the\r\ncarbonate of magnesia, it is necessary that care should be taken to mix\r\nit intimately with the flour, previous to the making of the dough.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Davy made a great number of comparative experiments with other\r\nsubstances, mixed in different proportions with new bread flour. The\r\nfixed alkalies, both in their pure and carbonated state, when used in\r\nsmall quantity, to a certain extent were found to improve the bread made\r\nfrom new flour; but no substance was so efficacious in this respect as\r\ncarbonate of magnesia.\r\n\r\n\"The greater number of his experiments were performed on the worst new\r\n_seconds_ flour Mr. Davy could procure. He also made some trials on\r\n_seconds_ and _firsts_ of different quality. In some cases the results\r\nwere more striking and satisfactory than in others; but in every\r\ninstance the improvement of the bread, by carbonate of magnesia, was\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Davy observes, that a pound of carbonate of magnesia would be\r\nsufficient to mix with two hundred and fifty-six pounds of new flour, or\r\nat the rate of thirty grains to the pound. And supposing a pound of\r\ncarbonate of magnesia to cost half-a-crown, the additional expense would\r\nbe only half a farthing in the pound of flour.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Davy conceives that not the slightest danger can be apprehended\r\nfrom the use of such an innocent substance, as the carbonate of\r\nmagnesia, in such small proportion as is necessary to improve bread from\r\nnew flour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DETECTING THE PRESENCE OF ALUM IN BREAD.\r\n\r\nPour upon two ounces of the suspected bread, half a pint of boiling\r\ndistilled water; boil the mixture for a few minutes, and filter it\r\nthrough unsized paper. Evaporate the fluid, to about one fourth of its\r\noriginal bulk, and let gradually fall into the clear fluid a solution of\r\nmuriate of barytes. If a _copious_ white precipitate ensues, which does\r\nnot disappear by the addition of _pure_ nitric acid, the presence of\r\nalum may be suspected. Bread, made without alum, produces, when assayed\r\nin this manner, merely a very slight precipitate, which originates from\r\na minute portion of sulphate of magnesia contained in all common salt of\r\ncommerce; and bread made with salt freed from sulphate of magnesia,\r\nproduces an infusion with water, which does not become disturbed by the\r\nbarytic test.\r\n\r\nOther means of detecting all the constituent parts of alum, namely, the\r\nalumine, sulphuric acid, and potash, so as to render the presence of the\r\nalum unequivocal, will readily suggest itself to those who are familiar\r\nwith analytical chemistry; namely: one of the readiest means is, to\r\ndecompose the vegetable matter of the bread, by the action of chlorate\r\nof potash, in a platina crucible, at a red heat, and then to assay the\r\nresiduary mass--by means of muriate of barytes, for sulphuric acid; by\r\nammonia, for alumine; and by muriate of platina, for potash[46]. The\r\nabove method of detecting the presence of alum, must therefore be taken\r\nwith some limitation.\r\n\r\nThere is no unequivocal test for detecting in a _ready manner_ the\r\npresence of alum in bread, on account of the impurity of the common salt\r\nused in the making of bread. If we could, in the ordinary way of bread\r\nmaking, employ common salt, absolutely free from foreign saline\r\nsubstances, the mode of detecting the presence of alum, or at least one\r\nof its constituent parts, namely, the sulphuric acid, would be very\r\neasy. Some conjecture may, nevertheless, be formed of the presence, or\r\nabsence, of alum, by assaying the infusion of bread in the manner\r\nstated, p. 109, and comparing the assay with the results afforded by an\r\ninfusion of home-made or household bread, known to be genuine, and\r\nactually assayed in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASY METHOD OF JUDGING OF THE GOODNESS OF BREAD CORN, AND BREAD-FLOUR.\r\n\r\nMillers judge of the goodness of bread corn by the quantity of bran\r\nwhich the grain produces.\r\n\r\nSuch grains as are full and plump, that have a bright and shining\r\nappearance, without any shrivelling and shrinking in the covering of\r\nthe skin, are the best; for wrinkled grains have a greater quantity of\r\nskin, or bran, than such as are sound or plump.\r\n\r\nPastry-cooks and bakers judge of the goodness of flour in the manner in\r\nwhich it comports itself in kneading. The best kind of wheaten flour\r\nassumes, at the instant it is formed into paste by the addition of\r\nwater, a very gluey, ductile, and elastic paste, easy to be kneaded, and\r\nwhich may be elongated, flattened, and drawn in every direction, without\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\nFor the following fact we are indebted to Mr. Hatchet.\r\n\r\n\"Grain which has been heated or burnt in the stack, may in the following\r\nmanner be rendered fit for being made into bread:\r\n\r\n\"The wheat must be put into a vessel capable of holding at least three\r\ntimes the quantity, and the vessel filled with boiling water; the grain\r\nshould then be occasionally stirred, and the hollow decayed grains,\r\nwhich float, may be removed. When the water has become cold, or in about\r\nhalf an hour, it is drawn off. Then rince the corn with cold water, and,\r\nhaving completely drained it, spread it thinly on the floor of a kiln,\r\nand thus thoroughly dry it, stirring and turning it frequently during\r\nthis part of the process.\"[47]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] The sack of marketable flour is by law obliged to weigh 240 pounds,\r\nwhich is the produce of five bushels of wheat, and is upon an average\r\nsupposed to make eighty quartern loaves of bread; and consequently\r\nsixteen of such loaves are made from each bushel of good wheat. It is\r\nadmitted, however, that two or three loaves more than the above quantity\r\ncan be made from the sack of flour, when it is the _genuine produce_ of\r\n_good wheat_; that is, in the proportion of about sixteen and a half\r\nloaves from each bushel of sound grain, and, it may be presumed, sixteen\r\nfrom a bushel of medium corn. The expense, in London, of making the sack\r\nof flour into bread, and disposing of it, is about nine shillings.\r\n\r\nA bushel of wheat, upon an average, weighs sixty-one pounds; when\r\nground, the meal weighs 60-3/4 lbs.; which, on being dressed, produces\r\n46-3/4 lbs. of flour, of the sort called _seconds_; which alone is used\r\nfor the making of bread in London and throughout the greater part of\r\nthis country; and of pollard and bran 12-3/4 lbs., which quantity, when\r\nbolted, produces 3 lbs. of fine flour, this, when sifted, produces in\r\ngood second flour 1-1/4 lb.\r\n\r\n[44] Whilst correcting this sheet for the press, the printer transmits\r\nto me the following lines:\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday last, George Wood, a baker, was convicted before T. Evance,\r\nEsq. Union Hall, of having in his possession a quantity of alum for the\r\nadulteration of bread, and fined in the penalty of 5_l._ and costs,\r\nunder 55 Geo.

The beverage may, in fact, be\r\nneither more nor less than a compound of the most deleterious\r\nsubstances; and it is also clear that all ranks of society are alike\r\nexposed to the nefarious fraud. The proofs of this statement will be\r\nshewn hereafter.[48]\r\n\r\nThe author[49] of a Practical Treatise on Brewing, which has run\r\nthrough eleven editions, after having stated the various ingredients for\r\nbrewing porter, observes, \"that however much they may surprise, however\r\npernicious or disagreeable they may appear, he has always found them\r\nrequisite in the brewing of porter, and he thinks they must invariably\r\nbe used by those who wish to continue the taste, flavour, and appearance\r\nof the beer.[50] And though several Acts of Parliament have been passed\r\nto prevent porter brewers from using many of them, yet the author can\r\naffirm, from experience, he could never produce the present flavoured\r\nporter without them.[51] The intoxicating qualities of porter are to be\r\nascribed to the various drugs intermixed with it. It is evident some\r\nporter is more heady than other, and it arises from the greater or less\r\nquantity of stupifying ingredients. Malt, to produce intoxication, must\r\nbe used in such large quantities as would very much diminish, if not\r\ntotally exclude, the brewer's profit.\"\r\n\r\nThe practice of adulterating beer appears to be of early date. By an\r\nAct so long ago as Queen Anne, the brewers are prohibited from mixing\r\n_cocculus indicus_, or any unwholesome ingredients, in their beer, under\r\nsevere penalties: but few instances of convictions under this act are to\r\nbe met with in the public records for nearly a century. To shew that\r\nthey have augmented in our own days, we shall exhibit an abstract from\r\ndocuments laid lately before Parliament.[52]\r\n\r\nThese will not only amply prove, that unwholesome ingredients are used\r\nby fraudulent brewers, and that very deleterious substances are also\r\nvended both to brewers and publicans for adulterating beer, but that the\r\ningredients mixed up in the brewer's enchanting cauldron are placed\r\nabove all competition, even with the potent charms of Macbeth's witches:\r\n\r\n     \"Root of hemlock, digg'd i' the dark,\r\n       +       +       +       +       +\r\n       +       +       +       +       +\r\n     For a charm of pow'rful trouble,\r\n     Like a hell-broth boil and bubble;\r\n     Double, double, toil and trouble,\r\n     Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.\"\r\n\r\nThe fraud of imparting to porter and ale an intoxicating quality by\r\nnarcotic substances, appears to have flourished during the period of the\r\nlate French war; for, if we examine the importation lists of drugs, it\r\nwill be noticed that the quantities of cocculus indicus imported in a\r\ngiven time prior to that period, will bear no comparison with the\r\nquantity imported in the same space of time during the war, although an\r\nadditional duty was laid upon this commodity. Such has been the amount\r\nbrought into this country in five years, that it far exceeds the\r\nquantity imported during twelve years anterior to the above epoch. The\r\nprice of this drug has risen within these ten years from two shillings\r\nto seven shillings the pound.\r\n\r\nIt was at the period to which we have alluded, that the preparation of\r\nan extract of cocculus indicus first appeared, as a new saleable\r\ncommodity, in the price-currents of _brewers'-druggists_. It was at the\r\nsame time, also, that a Mr. Jackson, of notorious memory, fell upon the\r\nidea of brewing beer from various drugs, without any malt and hops. This\r\nchemist did not turn brewer himself; but he struck out the more\r\nprofitable trade of teaching his mystery to the brewers for a handsome\r\nfee. From that time forwards, written directions, and recipe-books for\r\nusing the chemical preparations to be substituted for malt and hops,\r\nwere respectively sold; and many adepts soon afterwards appeared every\r\nwhere, to instruct brewers in the nefarious practice, first pointed out\r\nby Mr. Jackson. From that time, also, the fraternity of\r\nbrewers'-chemists took its rise. They made it their chief business to\r\nsend travellers all over the country with lists and samples exhibiting\r\nthe price and quality of the articles manufactured by them for the use\r\nof brewers only. Their trade spread far and wide, but it was amongst the\r\ncountry brewers chiefly that they found the most customers; and it is\r\namongst them, up to the present day, as I am assured by some of these\r\noperators, on whose veracity I can rely, that the greatest quantities of\r\nunlawful ingredients are sold.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Parliament[53] prohibits chemists, grocers, and druggists,\r\nfrom supplying illegal ingredients to brewers under a heavy penalty, as\r\nis obvious from the following abstract of the Act.\r\n\r\n\"No druggist, vender of, or dealer in drugs, or chemist, or other\r\nperson, shall sell or deliver to any licensed brewer, dealer in or\r\nretailer of beer, knowing him to be such, or shall sell or deliver to\r\nany person on account of or in trust for any such brewer, dealer or\r\nretailer, any liquor called by the name of or sold as colouring, from\r\nwhatever material the same may be made, or any material or preparation\r\nother than unground brown malt for darkening the colour of worts or\r\nbeer, or any liquor or preparation made use of for darkening the colour\r\nof worts or beer, or any molasses, honey, vitriol, quassia, cocculus\r\nIndian, grains of paradise, Guinea pepper or opium, or any extract or\r\npreparation of molasses, or any article or preparation to be used in\r\nworts or beer for or as a substitute for malt or hops; and if any\r\ndruggist shall offend in any of these particulars, such liquor\r\npreparation, molasses, &c. shall be forfeited, and may be seized by any\r\nofficer of excise, and the person so offending shall for each offence\r\nforfeit 500_l._\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of druggists and grocers, prosecuted by the\r\nCourt of Excise, and convicted of supplying unlawful ingredients to\r\nbrewers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Druggists and Grocers, prosecuted and convicted from 1812 to\r\n1819, for supplying illegal Ingredients to Brewers for adulterating\r\nBeer._[54]\r\n\r\nJohn Dunn and another, druggists, for selling adulterating ingredients\r\nto brewers, verdict 500_l._\r\n\r\nGeorge Rugg and others, druggists, for selling adulterating ingredients\r\nto brewers, verdict 500_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Hodgkinson and others, for selling adulterating ingredients to\r\nbrewers, 100_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hiscocks and others, for selling adulterating ingredients to a\r\nbrewer, 200_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nG.

Of late years it has been brewed from mixtures of pale and\r\nbrown malt.\r\n\r\nThese, at some establishments, are mashed separately, and the worts from\r\neach are afterwards mixed together. The proportion of pale and brown\r\nmalt, used for brewing porter, varies in different breweries; some\r\nemploy nearly two parts of pale malt and one part of brown malt; but\r\neach brewer appears to have his own proportion; which the intelligent\r\nmanufacturer varies, according to the nature and qualities of the malt.\r\nThree pounds of hops are, upon an average, allowed to every barrel,\r\n(thirty-six gallons) of porter.\r\n\r\nWhen the price of malt, on account of the great increase in the price of\r\nbarley during the late war, was very high, the London brewers discovered\r\nthat a larger quantity of wort of a given strength could be obtained\r\nfrom pale malt than from brown malt. They therefore increased the\r\nquantity of the former and diminished that of the latter. This produced\r\nbeer of a paler colour, and of a less bitter flavour. To remedy these\r\ndisadvantages, they invented an artificial colouring substance, prepared\r\nby boiling brown sugar till it acquired a very dark brown colour; a\r\nsolution of which was employed to darken the colour of the beer. Some\r\nbrewers made use of the infusion of malt instead of sugar colouring. To\r\nimpart to the beer a bitter taste, the fraudulent brewer employed\r\nquassia wood and wormwood as a substitute for hops.\r\n\r\nBut as the colouring of beer by means of sugar became in many instances\r\na pretext for using illegal ingredients, the Legislature, apprehensive\r\nfrom the mischief that might, and actually did, result from it, passed\r\nan Act prohibiting the use of burnt sugar, in July 1817; and nothing but\r\nmalt and hops is now allowed to enter into the composition of beer: even\r\nthe use of isinglass for clarifying beer, is contrary to law.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the beer-colouring Act been repealed, than other persons\r\nobtained a patent for effecting the purpose of imparting an artificial\r\ncolour to porter, by means of brown malt, specifically prepared for that\r\npurpose only. The beer, coloured by the new method, is more liable to\r\nbecome spoiled, than when coloured by the process formerly practised.\r\nThe colouring malt does not contain any considerable portion of\r\nsaccharine matter. The grain is by mere torrefaction converted into a\r\ngum-like substance, wholly soluble in water, which renders the beer\r\nmore liable to pass into the acetous fermentation than the common brown\r\nmalt is capable of doing; because the latter, if prepared from good\r\nbarley, contains a portion of saccharine matter, of which the patent\r\nmalt is destitute.\r\n\r\nBut as brown malt is generally prepared from the worst kind of barley,\r\nand as the patent malt can only be made from good grain, it may become,\r\non that account, an useful article to the brewer (at least, it gives\r\ncolour and body to the beer;) but it cannot materially economise the\r\nquantity of malt necessary to produce good porter. Some brewers of\r\neminence in this town have assured me, that the use of this mode of\r\ncolouring beer is wholly unnecessary; and that porter of the requisite\r\ncolour may be brewed better without it; hence this kind of malt is not\r\nused in their establishments. The quantity of gum-like matter which it\r\ncontains, gives too much ferment to the beer, and renders it liable to\r\nspoil. Repeated experiments, made on a large scale, have settled this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH AND SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PORTER.\r\n\r\nThe strength of all kinds of beer, like that of wine, depends on the\r\nquantity of spirit contained in a given bulk of the liquor.\r\n\r\nThe reader need scarcely be told, that of no article there are more\r\nvarieties than of porter. This, no doubt, arises from the different mode\r\nof manufacturing the beer, although the ingredients are the same. This\r\ndifference is more striking in the porter manufactured among country\r\nbrewers, than it is in the beer brewed by the eminent London porter\r\nbrewers. The totality of the London porter exhibits but very slight\r\ndifferences, both with respect to strength or quantity of spirit, and\r\nsolid extractive matter, contained in a given bulk of it. The spirit may\r\nbe stated, upon an average, to be 4,50 per cent. in porter retailed at\r\nthe publicans; the solid matter, is from twenty-one to twenty-three\r\npounds per barrel of thirty-six gallons. The country-brewed porter is\r\nseldom well fermented, and seldom contains so large a quantity of\r\nspirit; it usually abounds in mucilage; hence it becomes turbid when\r\nmixed with alcohol. Such beer cannot keep, without becoming sour.\r\n\r\nIt has been matter of frequent complaint, that ALL the porter\r\nnow brewed, is not what porter was formerly. This idea may be true with\r\nsome exceptions. My professional occupations have, during these\r\ntwenty-eight years, repeatedly obliged me to examine the strength of\r\nLondon porter, brewed by different brewers; and, from the minutes made\r\non that subject, I am authorised to state, that the porter now brewed by\r\nthe eminent London brewers, is unquestionably stronger than that which\r\nwas brewed at different periods during the late French war. Samples of\r\nbrown stout with which I have been obligingly favoured, whilst writing\r\nthis Treatise, by Messrs. Barclay, Perkins, and Co.--Messrs. Truman,\r\nHanbury, and Co.--Messrs. Henry Meux and Co.--and other eminent brewers\r\nof this capital--afforded, upon an average, 7,25 per cent. of alcohol,\r\nof 0,833 specific gravity; and porter, from the same houses, yielded\r\nupon an average 5,25 per cent. of alcohol, of the same specific\r\ngravity;[55] this beer received from the brewers was taken from the\r\nsame store from which the publicans are supplied.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless singular to observe, that from fifteen samples of\r\nbeer of the same denominations, procured from different retailers, the\r\nproportions of spirit fell considerably short of the above quantities.\r\nSamples of brown stout, procured from the retailers, afforded, upon an\r\naverage, 6,50 per cent. of alcohol; and the average strength of the\r\nporter was 4,50 per cent. Whence can this difference between the beer\r\nfurnished by the brewer, and that retailed by the publican, arise? We\r\nshall not be at a loss to answer this question, when we find that so\r\nmany retailers of porter have been prosecuted and convicted for mixing\r\ntable beer with their strong beer; this is prohibited by law, as becomes\r\nobvious by the following words of the Act.[56]\r\n\r\n\"If any common or other brewer, innkeeper, victualler, or retailer of\r\nbeer or ale, shall mix or suffer to be mixed any strong beer, ale, or\r\nworts, with table beer, worts, or water, in any tub or measure, he shall\r\nforfeit 50_l._\" The difference between strong and table beer, is thus\r\nsettled by Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"All beer or ale[57] above the price of eighteen shillings per barrel,\r\nexclusive of ale duties now payable (viz. ten shillings per barrel,) or\r\nthat may be hereafter payable in respect thereof, shall be deemed strong\r\nbeer or ale; and all beer of the price of eighteen shillings the barrel\r\nor under, exclusive of the duty payable (viz. two shillings per barrel)\r\nin respect thereof, shall be deemed table beer within the meaning of\r\nthis and all other Acts now in force, or that may hereafter be passed in\r\nrelation to beer or ale or any duties thereon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Publicans prosecuted and convicted from 1815 to 1818, for\r\nadulterating Beer with illegal Ingredients, and for mixing Table Beer\r\nwith their Strong Beer._[58]\r\n\r\nWilliam Atterbury, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing table beer with strong beer, 40_l._\r\n\r\nRichard Dean, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing table beer with strong beer, 50_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Jay, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for mixing\r\ntable beer with strong beer, 50_l._\r\n\r\nJames Atkinson, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing table beer with strong beer, 20_l._\r\n\r\nSamuel Langworth, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing table beer with strong beer, 50_l._\r\n\r\nHannah Spencer, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing table beer with strong beer, 150_l._\r\n\r\n---- Hoeg, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for mixing\r\ntable beer with strong beer, 5_l._\r\n\r\nRichard Craddock, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing table beer with strong beer, 100_l._\r\n\r\nJames Harris, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nreceiving stale beer, and mixing it with strong beer, 42_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nThomas Scoons, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing stale beer with strong beer, verdict 200_l._\r\n\r\nDiones Geer and another, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c.\r\nand for mixing strong and table beer, verdict 400_l._\r\n\r\nCharles Coleman, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing strong and table beer, 35_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nWilliam Orr, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for mixing\r\nstrong and table beer, 50_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Gardiner, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for\r\nmixing strong and table beer, 100_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Morris, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for mixing\r\nstrong and table beer, 20_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Harbur, for using salt of steel, salt, molasses, &c. and for mixing\r\nstrong and table beer, 50_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Corrie, for mixing strong beer with table beer.\r\n\r\nJohn Cape, for mixing strong beer with table beer.\r\n\r\nJoseph Gudge, for mixing strong beer with small beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLEGAL SUBSTANCES USED FOR ADULTERATING BEER.\r\n\r\nWe have stated already (p. 113) that nothing is allowed by law to enter\r\ninto the composition of beer, but malt and hops.\r\n\r\nThe substances used by fraudulent brewers for adulterating beer, are\r\nchiefly the following:\r\n\r\nQuassia, which gives to beer a bitter taste, is substituted for hops;\r\nbut hops possesses a more agreeable aromatic flavour, and there is also\r\nreason to believe that they render beer less liable to spoil by keeping;\r\na property which does not belong to quassia. It requires but little\r\ndiscrimination to distinguish very clearly the peculiar bitterness of\r\nquassia in adulterated porter. Vast quantities of the shavings of this\r\nwood are sold in a half-torrefied and ground state to disguise its\r\nobvious character, and to prevent its being recognised among the waste\r\nmaterials of the brewers. Wormwood[59] has likewise been used by\r\nfraudulent brewers.\r\n\r\nThe adulterating of hops is prohibited by the Legislature.[60]\r\n\r\n\"If any person shall put any drug or ingredient whatever into hops to\r\nalter the colour or scent thereof, every person so offending, convicted\r\nby the oath of one witness before one justice of peace for the county or\r\nplace where the offence was committed, shall forfeit 5_l._ for every\r\nhundred weight.\"\r\n\r\nBeer rendered bitter by quassia never keeps well, unless it be kept in a\r\nplace possessing a temperature considerably lower than the temperature\r\nof the surrounding atmosphere; and this is not well practicable in large\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe use of boiling the wort of beer with hops, is partly to communicate\r\na peculiar aromatic flavour which the hop contains, partly to cover the\r\nsweetness of undecomposed saccharine matter, and also to separate, by\r\nvirtue of the gallic acid and tannin it contains, a portion of a\r\npeculiar vegetable mucilage somewhat resembling gluten, which is still\r\ndiffused through the beer. The compound thus produced, separates in\r\nsmall flakes like those of curdled soap; and by these means the beer is\r\nrendered less liable to spoil. For nothing contributes more to the\r\nconversion of beer, or any other vinous fluid, into vinegar, than\r\nmucilage. Hence, also, all full-bodied and clammy ales, abounding in\r\nmucilage, and which are generally ill fermented, do not keep as perfect\r\nale ought to do. Quassia is, therefore, unfit as a substitute for hops;\r\nand even English hops are preferable to those imported from the\r\nContinent; for nitrate of silver and acetate of lead produce a more\r\nabundant precipitate from an infusion of English hops, than can be\r\nobtained from a like infusion by the same agents from foreign hops.\r\n\r\nOne of the qualities of good porter, is, that it should bear _a fine\r\nfrothy head_, as it is technically termed: because professed judges of\r\nthis beverage, would not pronounce the liquor excellent, although it\r\npossessed all other good qualities of porter, without this requisite.\r\n\r\nTo impart to porter this property of frothing when poured from one\r\nvessel into another, or to produce what is also termed a _cauliflower\r\nhead_, the mixture called _beer-heading_, composed of common green\r\nvitriol (sulphate of iron,) alum, and salt, is added. This addition to\r\nthe beer is generally made by the publicans.[61] It is unnecessary to\r\ngenuine beer, which of itself possesses the property of bearing a strong\r\nwhite froth, without these additions; and it is only in consequence of\r\ntable beer being mixed with strong beer, that the frothing property of\r\nthe porter is lost. From experiments I have tried on this subject, I\r\nhave reason to believe that the sulphate of iron, added for that\r\npurpose, does not possess the power ascribed to it. But the publicans\r\nfrequently, when they fine a butt of beer, by means of isinglass,\r\nadulterate the porter at the same time with table beer, together with a\r\nquantity of molasses and a small portion of extract of gentian root, to\r\nkeep up the peculiar flavour of the porter; and it is to the molasses\r\nchiefly, which gives a spissitude to the beer, that the frothing\r\nproperty must be ascribed; for, without it, the sulphate of iron does\r\nnot produce the property of frothing in diluted beer.\r\n\r\nCapsicum and grains of paradise, two highly acrid substances, are\r\nemployed to give a pungent taste to weak insipid beer. Of late, a\r\nconcentrated tincture of these articles, to be used for a similar\r\npurpose, and possessing a powerful effect, has appeared in the\r\nprice-currents of brewers' druggists. Ginger root, coriander seed, and\r\norange peels, are employed as flavouring substances chiefly by the ale\r\nbrewers.\r\n\r\nFrom these statements, and the seizures that have been made of illegal\r\ningredients at various breweries, it is obvious that the adulterations\r\nof beer are not imaginary. It will be noticed, however, that some of the\r\nsophistications are comparatively harmless, whilst others are effected\r\nby substances deleterious to health.\r\n\r\nThe following list exhibits some of the unlawful substances seized at\r\ndifferent breweries and at chemical laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Illegal Ingredients, seized from 1812 to 1818, at various\r\nBreweries and Brewers' Druggists._[62]\r\n\r\n1812, July.

The\r\nrevenue suffers, because a larger quantity of beer is sold as strong\r\nbeer; that is, at a price exceeding the price of table beer, without the\r\nstrong beer duty being paid. In the next place, the brewer suffers,\r\nbecause the retailer gets table or mild beer, and retails it as strong\r\nbeer.\" The following are the words of the Act, prohibiting the brewers\r\nmixing table beer with strong beer.\r\n\r\n\"If any common brewer shall mix or suffer to be mixed any strong beer,\r\nor strong worts with table beer or table worts, or with water in any\r\nguile or fermenting tun after the declaration of the quantity of such\r\nguile shall have been made; or if he shall at any time mix or suffer to\r\nbe mixed strong beer or strong worts with table beer worts or with\r\nwater, in any vat, cask, tub, measures or utensil, not being an entered\r\nguile or fermenting tun, he shall forfeit 200 pounds.\"[64]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the persons who commit this offence, Mr. Carr,[65] the\r\nSolicitor of the Excise, observes, that \"they are generally brewers who\r\ncarry on the double trade of brewing both strong and table beer. It is\r\nalmost impossible to prevent them from mixing one with the other; and\r\nfrauds of very great extent have been detected, and the parties punished\r\nfor that offence. One brewer at Plymouth evaded duties to the amount of\r\n32,000 pounds; and other brewers, who brew party guiles of beer,\r\ncarrying on the two trades of ale and table beer brewers, where the\r\ntrade is a victualling brewer, which is different from the common\r\nbrewer, he being a person who sells only wholesale; the victualling\r\nbrewer being a brewer and also a seller by retail.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the neighbourhood of London,\" Mr. Carr continues, \"more\r\nparticularly, I speak from having had great experience, from the\r\ninformations and evidence which I have received, that the retailers\r\ncarry on a most extensive fraud upon the public, in purchasing stale\r\ntable beer, or the bottoms of casks. There are a class of men who go\r\nabout and sell such beer at table-beer price to public victuallers, who\r\nmix it in their cellars. If they receive beer from their brewers which\r\nis mild, they purchase stale beer; and if they receive stale beer, they\r\npurchase common table beer for that purpose; and many of the\r\nprosecutions are against retailers for that offence.\" The following may\r\nserve in proof of this statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Brewers prosecuted and convicted from 1813 to 1819, for\r\nadulterating Strong Beer with Table Beer._[66]\r\n\r\nThomas Manton and another, brewers, for mixing strong and table beer,\r\nverdict 300_l._\r\n\r\nMark Morrell and another, brewers, for mixing strong and table beer,\r\n20_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nRobert Jones and another, brewers, for mixing strong and table beer,\r\nverdict 125_l._\r\n\r\nRobert Stroad, brewer, for mixing strong and table beer, 200_l._ and\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cobbett, brewer, mixing strong and table beer, 100_l._ and\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nThomas Richard Withers, brewer, for mixing strong and table beer, 75_l._\r\nand costs.\r\n\r\nJohn Cowel, brewer, for mixing table beer with strong, 50_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nJohn Mitchell, brewer, for mixing table beer with strong, absconded.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lloyd and another, brewers, for mixing table beer with strong,\r\n25_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nJames Edmunds and another, brewers, for mixing table beer with strong,\r\nfor a long period, verdict 600_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Hoffman, brewer, for mixing strong and table beer, and using\r\nmolasses, 130_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nSamuel Langworth, brewer, for mixing strong with stale table beer,\r\n10_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nHannah Spencer, brewer, for mixing strong with stale table beer, verdict\r\n150_l._\r\n\r\nJoseph Smith and others, brewers, for mixing strong and table beer.\r\n\r\nPhilip George, brewer, for mixing strong and table beer, verdict 200_l._\r\n\r\nJoshua Row, brewer, for mixing strong and table beer, verdict 400_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Drew, jun. and another, for mixing strong beer with table, 50_l._\r\nand costs.\r\n\r\nJohn Cape, brewer, for mixing strong and table beer, 250_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nJohn Williams and another, brewers, for mixing strong and table beer,\r\nverdict 200_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD, OR ENTIRE; AND NEW, OR MILD BEER.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to state, that every publican has two sorts of beer sent\r\nto him from the brewer; the one is called _mild_, which is beer sent out\r\nfresh as it is brewed; the other is called _old_; that is, such as is\r\nbrewed on purpose for keeping, and which has been kept in store a\r\ntwelve-month or eighteen months. The origin of the beer called\r\n_entire_, is thus related by the editor of the Picture of London:\r\n\"Before the year 1730, the malt liquors in general used in London were\r\nale, beer, and two-penny; and it was customary to call for a pint, or\r\ntankard, of half-and-half, _i.e._ half of ale and half of beer, half of\r\nale and half of two-penny. In course of time it also became the practice\r\nto call for a pint or tankard of _three-threads_, meaning a third of\r\nale, beer, and two-penny; and thus the publican had the trouble to go to\r\nthree casks, and turn three cocks, for a pint of liquor. To avoid this\r\ninconvenience and waste, a brewer of the name of Harwood conceived the\r\nidea of making a liquor, which should partake of the same united\r\nflavours of ale, beer, and two-penny; he did so, and succeeded, calling\r\nit _entire_, or entire butt, meaning that it was drawn entirely from one\r\ncask or butt; and as it was a very hearty and nourishing liquor, and\r\nsupposed to be very suitable for porters and other working people, it\r\nobtained the name of _porter_.\" The system is now altered, and porter is\r\nvery generally compounded of two kinds, or rather the same liquor in two\r\ndifferent states, the due admixture of which is palatable, though\r\nneither is good alone. One is _mild_ porter, and the other _stale_\r\nporter; the former is that which has a slightly bitter flavour; the\r\nlatter has been kept longer. This mixture the publican adapts to the\r\npalates of his several customers, and effects the mixture very readily,\r\nby means of a machine, containing small pumps worked by handles. In\r\nthese are four pumps, but only three spouts, because two of the pumps\r\nthrow out at the same spout: one of these two pumps draws the mild, and\r\nthe other the stale porter, from the casks down in the cellar; and the\r\npublican, by dexterously changing his hold works either pump, and draws\r\nboth kinds of beer at the same spout. An indifferent observer supposes,\r\nthat since it all comes from one spout, it is entire butt beer, as the\r\npublican professes over his door, and which has been decided by vulgar\r\nprejudice to be only good porter, though the difference is not easily\r\ndistinguished. I have been informed by several eminent brewers, that of\r\nlate, a far greater quantity is consumed of mild than of stale beer.\r\n\r\nThe entire beer of the modern brewer, according to the statement of C.\r\nBarclay,[67] Esq. \"consists of some beer brewed expressly for the\r\npurpose of keeping: it likewise contains a portion of returns from\r\npublicans; a portion of beer from the bottoms of vats; the beer that is\r\ndrawn off from the pipes, which convey the beer from one vat to another,\r\nand from one part of the premises to another. This beer is collected and\r\nput into vats. Mr. Barclay also states that it contains a certain\r\nportion of brown stout, which is twenty shillings a barrel dearer than\r\ncommon beer; and some bottling beer, which is ten shillings a barrel\r\ndearer;[68] and that all these beers, united, are put into vats, and\r\nthat it depends upon various circumstances, how long they may remain in\r\nthose vats before they become perfectly bright. When bright, this beer\r\nis sent out to the publicans, for their _entire_ beer, and there is\r\nsometimes a small quantity of mild beer mixed with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe present entire beer, therefore, is a very heterogeneous mixture,\r\ncomposed of all the waste and spoiled beer of the publicans--the bottoms\r\nof butts--the leavings of the pots--the drippings of the machines for\r\ndrawing the beer--the remnants of beer that lay in the leaden pipes of\r\nthe brewery, with a portion of brown stout, bottling beer, and mild\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nThe old or _entire_ beer we have examined, as obtained from Messrs.\r\nBarclay's, and other eminent London brewers, is unquestionably a good\r\ncompound; but it does no longer appear to be necessary, among fraudulent\r\nbrewers, to brew beer on purpose for keeping, or to keep it twelve or\r\neighteen months. A more easy, expeditious, and economical method has\r\nbeen discovered to convert any sort of beer into entire beer, merely by\r\nthe admixture of a portion of sulphuric acid. An imitation of the age of\r\neighteen months is thus produced in an instant. This process is\r\ntechnically called to bring beer _forward_, or to make it _hard_.\r\n\r\nThe practice is a bad one. The genuine, old, or entire beer, of the\r\nhonest brewer, is quite a different compound; it has a rich, generous,\r\nfull-bodied taste, without being acid, and a vinous odour: but it may,\r\nperhaps, not be generally known that this kind of beer always affords a\r\nless proportion of alcohol than is produced from mild beer. The practice\r\nof bringing beer _forward_, it is to be understood, is resorted to only\r\nby fraudulent brewers.[69]\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the brewer has too large a stock of old beer on his\r\nhands, recourse is had to an opposite practice of converting stale,\r\nhalf-spoiled, or sour beer, into mild beer, by the simple admixture of\r\nan alkali, or an alkaline earth. Oyster-shell powder and subcarbonate of\r\npotash, or soda, are usually employed for that purpose. These substances\r\nneutralise the excess of acid, and render sour beer somewhat palatable.\r\nBy this process the beer becomes very liable to spoil.\r\n\r\nIt is the worst expedient that the brewer can practise: the beer thus\r\nrendered _mild_, soon loses its vinous taste; it becomes vapid; and\r\nspeedily assumes a muddy grey colour, and an exceedingly disagreeable\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nThese sophistications may be considered, at first, as minor crimes\r\npractised by fraudulent brewers, when compared with the methods employed\r\nby them for rendering beer noxious to health by substances absolutely\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nTo increase the intoxicating quality of beer, the deleterious vegetable\r\nsubstance, called _cocculus indicus_, and the extract of this poisonous\r\nberry, technically called _black extract_, or, by some, _hard multum_,\r\nare employed. Opium, tobacco, nux vomica, and extract of poppies, have\r\nalso been used.\r\n\r\nThis fraud constitutes by far the most censurable offence committed by\r\nunprincipled brewers; and it is a lamentable reflection to behold so\r\ngreat a number of brewers prosecuted and convicted of this crime; nor is\r\nit less deplorable to find the names of druggists, eminent in trade,\r\nimplicated in the fraud, by selling the unlawful ingredients to brewers\r\nfor fraudulent purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Brewers prosecuted and convicted from 1813 to 1819, for\r\nreceiving and using illegal Ingredients in their Brewings._[70]\r\n\r\nRichard Gardner, brewer, for using adulterating ingredients, 100_l._,\r\njudgment by default.\r\n\r\nStephen Webb and another, brewers, for using adulterating ingredients,\r\nand mixing strong and table beer, verdict 500_l._\r\n\r\nHenry Wyatt, brewer, for using adulterating ingredients, verdict 400_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Harbart, retailer, for receiving adulterating ingredients, verdict\r\n150_l._\r\n\r\nPhilip Blake and others, brewers, for using adulterating ingredients,\r\nand mixing strong and table beer, verdict 250_l._\r\n\r\nJames Sneed, for receiving adulterating ingredients, 25_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nJohn Rewell and another, brewers, ditto, verdict 100_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Swain and another, ditto, for using adulterating ingredients,\r\nverdict 200_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Ing, brewer, ditto, stayed on defendant's death.\r\n\r\nJohn Hall, ditto, for receiving adulterating ingredients, 5_l._ and\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nJohn Webb, retailer, for using adulterating ingredients.\r\n\r\nRalph Fogg and another, brewers, for receiving and using adulterating\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\nJohn Gray, brewer, for using adulterating ingredients, 300_l._ and\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nRichard Bowman, for using liquid in bladder, supposed to be extract of\r\ncocculus, 100_l._\r\n\r\nRichard Bowman, brewer, for ditto, 100_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nSeptimus Stephens, brewer, for ditto, verdict 50_l._\r\n\r\nJames Rogers and another, brewer, for ditto, 220_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nGeorge Moore, brewer, for using colouring, 300_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nJohn Morris, for using adulterating ingredients.\r\n\r\nWebb and Ball, for using ginger, Guinea pepper, and brown powder, (name\r\nunknown), 1st 100_l._ 2nd 500_l._\r\n\r\nHenry Clarke, for using molasses, 150_l._\r\n\r\nKewell and Burrows, for using cocculus india, multum, &c. 100_l._\r\n\r\nAllatson and Abraham, for using cocculus india, multum, and porter\r\nflavour, 630_l._\r\n\r\nSwain and Sewell, for using cocculus india, Guinea-opium, &c. 200_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Ing, for using cocculus india, hard colouring, and honey, _dead_.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dean, for using molasses, 50_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Cowell, for using Spanish-liquorice, and mixing table beer with\r\nstrong beer, 50_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Mitchell, for using cocculus india, vitriol, and Guinea pepper,\r\n_left the country_.\r\n\r\nLloyd and Man, for using extract of cocculus, 25_l._\r\n\r\nJohn Gray, for using ginger, hartshorn shavings, and molasses, 300_l._\r\n\r\nJon Hoffman, for using molasses, Spanish juice, and mixing table with\r\nstrong beer, 130_l._\r\n\r\nRogers and Boon, for using extract of cocculus, multum, porter flavour,\r\n&c. 220_l._\r\n\r\n---- Betteley, for using wormwood, coriander seed, and Spanish juice,\r\n200_l._\r\n\r\nWilliam Lane, brewer, for using wormwood instead of hops, 5_l._ and\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat a minute portion of an unwholesome ingredient, daily taken in beer,\r\ncannot fail to be productive of mischief, admits of no doubt; and there\r\nis reasons to believe that a small quantity of a narcotic substance (and\r\ncocculus indicus is a powerful narcotic[71]), daily taken into the\r\nstomach, together with an intoxicating liquor, is highly more\r\nefficacious than it would be without the liquor. The effect may be\r\ngradual; and a strong constitution, especially if it be assisted with\r\nconstant and hard labour, may counteract the destructive consequences\r\nperhaps for many years; but it never fails to shew its baneful effects\r\nat last. Independent of this, it is a well-established fact, that porter\r\ndrinkers are very liable to apoplexy and palsy, without taking this\r\nnarcotic poison.\r\n\r\nIf we judge from the preceding lists of prosecutions and convictions\r\nfurnished by the Solicitor of the Excise[72], it will be evident that\r\nmany wholesale brewers, as well as retail dealers, stand very\r\nconspicuous among those offenders. But the reader will likewise notice,\r\nthat there are no convictions, in any instance, against any of the\r\neleven great London porter brewers[73] for any illegal practice. The\r\ngreat London brewers, it appears, believe that the publicans alone\r\nadulterate the beer. That many of the latter have been convicted of this\r\nfraud, the Report of the Board of Excise amply shews.--See p. 129.\r\n\r\nThe following statement relating to this subject, we transcribe from a\r\nParliamentary document:[74]\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins being asked, whether he believed that any of the inferior\r\nbrewers adulterated beer, answered, \"I am satisfied there are some\r\ninstances of that.\"\r\n\r\n_Question._--\"Do you believe publicans do?\" _Answer._--\"I believe they\r\ndo.\" _Q._--\"To a great extent?\" _A._--\"Yes.\" _Q._--\"Do you believe they\r\nadulterate the beer you sell them?\" _A._--\"I am satisfied there are\r\nsome instances of that.\"--Mr. J. Martineau[75] being asked the following\r\n\r\n_Question._[76]--\"In your judgment is any of the beer of the metropolis,\r\nas retailed to the publican, mixed with any deleterious ingredients?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer._--\"In retailing beer, in some instances, it has been.\"\r\n\r\n_Question._--\"By whom, in your opinion, has that been done?\"\r\n\r\n_Answer._--\"In that case by the publicans who vend it.\"\r\n\r\nOn this point, it is but fair, to the minor brewers, to record also the\r\nanswers of some officers of the revenue, when they were asked whether\r\nthey considered it more difficult to detect nefarious practices in large\r\nbreweries than in small ones.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Rogers being thus questioned in the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons,[77] \"Supposing the large brewers to use deleterious or any\r\nillegal ingredients to such an amount as could be of any importance to\r\ntheir concern, do you think it would, or would not, be more easy to\r\ndetect it in those large breweries, than in small ones?\" his answer was,\r\n\"more difficult to detect it in the large ones:\" and witness being asked\r\nto state the reason why, answered, \"Their premises are so much larger,\r\nand there is so much more strength, that a cart load or two is got rid\r\nof in a minute or two.\" Witness \"had known, in five minutes, twenty\r\nbarrels of molasses got rid of as soon as the door was shut.\"\r\n\r\nAnother witness, W. Wells, an excise officer,[78] in describing the\r\ncontrivances used to prevent detection, stated, that at a brewer's, at\r\nWestham, the adulterating substances \"were not kept on the premises, but\r\nin the brewer's house; not the principal, but the working brewers; it\r\nnot being considered, when there, as liable to seizure: the brewer had a\r\nvery large jacket made expressly for that purpose, with very large\r\npockets; and, on brewing mornings, he would take his pockets full of the\r\ndifferent ingredients. Witness supposed that such a man's jacket,\r\nsimilar to what he had described, would convey quite sufficient for any\r\nbrewery in England, as to _cocculus indicus_.\"\r\n\r\nThat it may be more difficult for the officers of the excise to detect\r\nfraudulent practices in large breweries than in small ones, may be true\r\nto a certain extent: but what eminent London porter brewer would stake\r\nhis reputation on the chance of so paltry a gain, in which he would\r\ninevitably be at the mercy of his own man? The eleven great porter\r\nbrewers of this metropolis are persons of so high respectability, that\r\nthere is no ground for the slightest suspicion that they would attempt\r\nany illegal practices, which they were aware could not possibly escape\r\ndetection in their extensive establishments. And let it be remembered,\r\nthat none of them have been detected for any unlawful practices,[79]\r\nwith regard to the processes of their manufacture, or the adulteration\r\nof their beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DETECTING THE ADULTERATION OF BEER.\r\n\r\nThe detection of the adulteration of beer with deleterious vegetable\r\nsubstances is beyond the reach of chemical analysis. The presence of\r\nsulphate of iron (p. 134) may be detected by evaporating the beer to\r\nperfect dryness, and burning away the vegetable matter obtained, by the\r\naction of chlorate of pot-ash in a red-hot crucible. The sulphate of\r\niron will be left behind among the residue in the crucible, which when\r\ndissolved in water, may be assayed, for the constituent parts of the\r\nsalt, namely, iron and sulphuric acid: for the former, by tincture of\r\ngalls, ammonia, and prussiate of potash; and for the latter, by muriate\r\nof barytes.[80]\r\n\r\nBeer, which has been rendered fraudulently _hard_ (see p. 148) by the\r\nadmixture of sulphuric acid, affords a white precipitate (sulphate of\r\nbarytes), by dropping into it a solution of acetate or muriate of\r\nbarytes; and this precipitate, when collected by filtering the mass, and\r\nafter having been dried, and heated red-hot for a few minutes in a\r\nplatina crucible, does not disappear by the addition of nitric, or\r\nmuriatic acid. Genuine old beer may produce a precipitate; but the\r\nprecipitate which it affords, after having been made red-hot in a\r\nplatina crucible, instantly becomes re-dissolved with effervescence by\r\npouring on it some pure nitric or muriatic acid; in that case the\r\nprecipitate is malate (not sulphate) of barytes, and is owing to a\r\nportion of malic acid having been formed in the beer.\r\n\r\nBut with regard to the vegetable materials deleterious to health, it is\r\nextremely difficult, in any instance, to detect them by chemical\r\nagencies; and in most cases it is quite impossible, as in that of\r\ncocculus indicus in beer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE QUANTITY OF SPIRIT CONTAINED IN PORTER, ALE,\r\nOR OTHER KINDS OF MALT LIQUORS.\r\n\r\nTake any quantity of the beer, put it into a glass retort, furnished\r\nwith a receiver, and distil, with a gentle heat, as long as any spirit\r\npasses over into the receiver; which may be known by heating from time\r\nto time a small quantity of the obtained fluid in a tea-spoon over a\r\ncandle, and bringing into contact with the vapour of it the flame of a\r\npiece of paper. If the vapour of the distilled fluid catches fire, the\r\ndistillation must be continued until the vapour ceases to be set on\r\nfire by the contact of a flaming body. To the distilled liquid thus\r\nobtained, which is the spirit of the beer, combined with water, add, in\r\nsmall quantities at a time, pure subcarbonate of potash (previously\r\nfreed from water by having been exposed to a red heat,) till the last\r\nportion of this salt added, remains undissolved in the fluid. The spirit\r\nwill thus become separated from the water, because the subcarbonate of\r\npotash abstracts from it the whole of the water which it contained; and\r\nthis combination sinks to the bottom, and the spirit alone floats on the\r\ntop. If this experiment be made in a glass tube, about half or\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in diameter, and graduated into 50 or 100\r\nequal parts, the relative per centage of spirit in a given quantity of\r\nbeer may be seen by mere inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Alcohol contained in Porter, Ale, and other kinds of Malt\r\nLiquors._[81]\r\n\r\n     One hundred parts, by Measure,      Parts of Alcohol,\r\n          contained.                        by Measure.\r\n\r\n     Ale, home-brewed                           8,30\r\n     Ale, Burton, three Samples                 6,25\r\n     Ale, Burton[82]                            8,88\r\n     Ale, Edinburgh[82]                         6,20\r\n     Ale, Dorchester[82]                        5,50\r\n     Ale, common London-brewed,     }\r\n             six samples            }           5,82\r\n     Ale, Scotch, three samples                 5,75\r\n     Porter, London, eight samples              4,00\r\n     Ditto, Ditto[83]                           4,20\r\n     Ditto, Ditto[83]                           4,45\r\n     Ditto, Ditto, bottled.                     4,75\r\n     Brown Stout, four samples                  5\r\n     Ditto, Ditto[83]                           6,80\r\n     Small Beer, six samples                    0,75\r\n     Ditto, Ditto[84]                           1,28\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] See pages 119, &c.\r\n\r\n[49] Child, on Brewing Porter, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[50] Child, on Brewing Porter, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[51] Ibid. p. 16.\r\n\r\n[52] \"Minutes of the Committee of the House of Commons, to whom the\r\npetition of several inhabitants of London and its vicinity, complaining\r\nof the high price and inferior quality of beer, was referred, to examine\r\nthe matter thereof, and to report the same, with their observations\r\nthereupon, to the House.

In proof of this\r\nstatement, it is only necessary to consult the London newspapers (the\r\nTimes and the Courier) from March to July 1818; which show to what\r\nextent this nefarious traffic has been carried on; and they report also\r\nthe prosecutions and convictions of numerous individuals who have been\r\nguilty of the fraud. The following are some of those prosecutions and\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nHATTON GARDEN.--On Saturday an information came to be heard at\r\nthis office, before Thomas Leach, Esq. the sitting magistrate, against a\r\nman of the name of Edmund Rhodes, charged with having, on the 12th of\r\nAugust last, dyed, fabricated, and manufactured, divers large\r\nquantities, viz. one hundred weight of sloe leaves, one hundred weight\r\nof ash leaves, one hundred weight of elder leaves, and one hundred\r\nweight of the leaves of a certain other tree, in imitation of tea,\r\ncontrary to the statute of the 17th of Geo. III.[85] whereby the said\r\nEdmund Rhodes had, for every pound of such leaves so manufactured,\r\nforfeited the sum of 5_l._ making the total of the penalties amount to\r\n2,000_l._ The second count in the information charged the said Rhodes\r\nwith having in his possession the above quantity of sloe, ash, elder,\r\nand other leaves, under the like penalty of 2,000_l._ The third count\r\ncharged him with having, on the said 12th of August last, in his\r\npossession, divers quantities, exceeding six pounds weight of each\r\nrespective kind of leaves; viz. fifty pounds weight of green sloe\r\nleaves, fifty pounds weight of green leaves of ash, fifty pounds weight\r\nof green leaves of elder, and fifty pounds weight of the green leaves of\r\na certain other tree; not having proved that such leaves were gathered\r\nwith the consent of the owners of the trees and shrubs from which they\r\nwere taken, and that such leaves were gathered for some other use, and\r\nnot for the purpose of manufacturing the same in imitation of tea;\r\nwhereby he had forfeited for each pound weight, the sum of 5_l._\r\namounting in the whole to 1,000_l._; and, in default of payment, in each\r\ncase, subjected himself to be committed to the house of correction for\r\nnot more than twelve months, nor less than six months.\r\n\r\nMr. Denton, who appeared for the defendant, who was absent, said that he\r\nwas a very poor man, with a family of five children, and was only the\r\nservant of the real manufacturer, and an ignorant man from the country,\r\nput into the premises to carry on the business, without knowing what the\r\nleaves were intended for. By direction of Mr. Mayo, who conducted the\r\nprosecution, several barrels and bags, filled with the imitation tea,\r\nwere then brought into the office, and a sample from each handed round.\r\nTo the eye they seemed a good imitation of tea.\r\n\r\nThe defendant was convicted in the penalty of 500_l._ on the second\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against Palmer._--This was an action by the\r\nAttorney-General against the defendant, Palmer, charging him with\r\nhaving in his possession a quantity of sloe-leaves and white-thorn\r\nleaves, fabricated into an imitation of tea.\r\n\r\nMr. Dauncey stated the case to the jury, and observed that the\r\ndefendant, Mr. Palmer, was a grocer. It would appear that a regular\r\nmanufactory was established in Goldstone-street. The parties by whom the\r\nmanufactory was conducted, was a person of the name of Proctor, and\r\nanother person named J. Malins. They engaged others to furnish them with\r\nleaves, which, after undergoing a certain process, were sold to and\r\ndrank by the public as tea. The leaves, in order to be converted into an\r\narticle resembling black tea, were first boiled, then baked upon an iron\r\nplate; and, when dry, rubbed with the hand, in order to produce that\r\ncurl which the genuine tea had. This was the most wholesome part of the\r\noperation; for the colour which was yet to be given to it, was produced\r\nby logwood. The green tea was manufactured in a manner more destructive\r\nto the constitution of those by whom it was drank. The leaves, being\r\npressed and dried, were laid upon sheets of copper, where they received\r\ntheir colour from an article known by the name of Dutch pink. The\r\narticle used in producing the appearance of the fine green bloom,\r\nobservable on the China tea, was, however, decidedly a dead poison! He\r\nalluded to verdigris, which was added to the Dutch pink in order to\r\ncomplete the operation. This was the case which he had to bring before\r\nthe jury; and hence it would appear, that, at the moment they were\r\nsupposing they were drinking a pleasant and nutritious beverage, they\r\nwere, in fact, in all probability, drinking the produce of the hedges\r\nround the metropolis, prepared for the purposes of deception in the most\r\nnoxious manner. He trusted he should be enabled to trace to the\r\npossession of the defendant eighty pounds weight of the commodity he had\r\nbeen describing.\r\n\r\nThomas Jones deposed, that he knew Proctor, and was employed by him at\r\nthe latter end of April, 1817, to gather black and white thorn leaves.\r\nSloe leaves were the black thorn. Witness also knew John Malins, the son\r\nof William Malins, a coffee-roaster; he did not at first know the\r\npurpose for which the leaves were gathered, but afterwards learnt they\r\nwere to make imitation tea. Witness did not gather more than one hundred\r\nand a half weight of these leaves; but he employed another person, of\r\nthe name of John Bagster, to gather them. He had two-pence per pound for\r\nthem. They were first boiled, and the water squeezed from them in a\r\npress. They were afterwards placed over a slow-fire upon sheets of\r\ncopper to dry; while on the copper they were rubbed with the hand to\r\ncurl them. At the time of boiling there was a little _verdigris_ put\r\ninto the water (this applied to green tea only.) After the leaves were\r\ndried, they were sifted, to separate the thorns and stalks. After they\r\nwere sifted, more verdigris and some Dutch pink were added. The\r\nverdigris gave the leaves that green bloom observable on genuine tea.\r\n\r\nThe black tea went through a similar course as the green, except the\r\napplication of Dutch pink: a little verdigris was put in the boiling,\r\nand to this was added a small quantity of logwood to dye it, and thus\r\nthe manufacture was complete. The drying operation took place on sheets\r\nof iron. Witness knew the defendant, Edward Palmer; he took some of the\r\nmixture he had been describing, to his shop. The first time he took some\r\nwas in May, 1817. In the course of that month, or the beginning of June,\r\nhe took four or five seven-pound parcels; when he took it there, it was\r\ntaken up to the top of the house. Witness afterwards carried some to\r\nRussell-street, which was taken to the top of the house, about one\r\nhundred weight and three quarters; from this quantity he carried\r\nfifty-three pounds weight to the house of the defendant's porter, by the\r\ndesire of Mr. Malins; it was in paper parcels of seven pounds each.\r\n\r\nJohn Bagster proved that he had been employed by Malins and Proctor, to\r\ngather sloe and white-thorn leaves: they were taken to Jones's house,\r\nand from thence to Malins' coffee-roasting premises; witness received\r\ntwo-pence per pound for them; he saw the manufacturing going on, but did\r\nnot know much about it: witness saw the leaves on sheets of copper, in\r\nGoldstone-street.\r\n\r\nThis was the case for the Crown.--Verdict for the Crown, 840_l._\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against John Prentice._--This was an information\r\nsimilar to the last, in which the defendant submitted to a verdict for\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against Lawson Holmes._--In this case the\r\ndefendant submitted to a verdict for the Crown.\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against John Orkney._--Thomas Jones proved that\r\nthe defendant was a grocer, and in the month of May last he carried to\r\nhis shop seven pounds of imitation tea, by the order of John Malins,\r\nfor which he received the money, viz. 15_s._ 9_d._ or 2_s._ 3_d._ per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nThe jury found a verdict for the Crown.--Penalties 70_l._\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against James Gray._--The defendant submitted to a\r\nverdict for the Crown.--Penalties 120_l._\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against H. Gilbert, and Powel._--These defendants\r\nsubmitted to a verdict.--Penalties 140_l._\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against William Clarke._--This defendant also\r\nsubmitted to a verdict for the Crown.\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against George David Bellis._--This defendant\r\nsubmitted to a verdict for the Crown.\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against John Horner._--The defendant in this case\r\nwas a grocer; it was proved by Jones that he received twenty pounds of\r\nimitation tea.--Verdict for the Crown.--Penalties 210_l._\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against William Dowling._--This was a grocer.\r\nJones proved that he delivered seven pounds of imitation tea at Mr.\r\nDowling's house, and received the money for it, namely 15_s._\r\n9_d._--Penalties 70_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DETECTING THE ADULTERATIONS OF TEA.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of tea may be evinced by comparing the botanical\r\ncharacters of the leaves of the two respective trees, and by submitting\r\nthem to the action of a few chemical tests.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the tea-leaf is slender and narrow, as shewn in this\r\nsketch, the edges are deeply serrated, and the end or extremity is\r\nacutely pointed. The texture of the leaf is very delicate, its surface\r\nsmooth and glossy, and its colour is a lively pale green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe sloe-leaf (and also the white-thorn leaf,) as shewn in this sketch,\r\nis more rounded, and the leaf is obtusely pointed. The serratures or\r\njags on the edges are not so deep, the surface of the leaf is more\r\nuneven, the texture not so delicate, and the colour is a dark olive\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese characters of course can be observed only after the dried leaves\r\nhave been suffered to macerate in water for about twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of some sorts of tea may differ in size, but the shape is the\r\nsame in all of them; because all the different kinds of tea imported\r\nfrom China, are the produce of one species of plant, and the difference\r\nbetween the green and souchong, or black tea, depends chiefly upon the\r\nclimate, soil, culture, age, and mode of drying the leaves.\r\n\r\nSpurious black tea,[86] slightly moistened, when rubbed on a sheet of\r\nwhite paper, immediately produces a blueish-black stain; and speedily\r\naffords, when thrown into cold water, a blueish-black tincture, which\r\ninstantly becomes reddened by letting fall into it, a drop or two of\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nTwo ounces of the suspected leaves, should be infused in half-a-pint of\r\ncold, soft water, and suffered to stand for about an hour. Genuine tea\r\nproduces an amber-coloured infusion, which does not become reddened by\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nAll the samples of spurious green tea (nineteen in number) which I have\r\nexamined, were coloured with carbonate of copper (a poisonous\r\nsubstance,) and not by means of verdigris, or copperas.[87] The latter\r\nsubstances would instantly turn the tea black; because both these\r\nmetallic salts being soluble in water, are acted on by the astringent\r\nmatter of the leaves, whether genuine or spurious, and convert the\r\ninfusion into ink.\r\n\r\nTea, rendered poisonous by carbonate of copper, speedily imparts to\r\nliquid ammonia a fine sapphire blue tinge. It is only necessary to shake\r\nup in a stopped vial, for a few minutes, a tea-spoonful of the suspected\r\nleaves, with about two table-spoonsful of liquid ammonia, diluted with\r\nhalf its bulk of water. The supernatant liquid will exhibit a fine blue\r\ncolour, if the minutest quantity of copper be present.\r\n\r\nGreen tea, coloured with carbonate of copper, when thrown into water\r\nimpregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, immediately acquires a black\r\ncolour. Genuine green tea suffers no change from the action of these\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nThe presence of copper may be further rendered obvious, by mixing one\r\npart of the suspected tea-leaves, reduced to powder, with two or three\r\nparts of nitrate of potash, (or with two parts of chlorate of potash,)\r\nand projecting this mixture by small portions at a time, into a platina,\r\nor porcelain-ware crucible, kept red-hot in a coal fire; the whole\r\nvegetable matter of the tea leaves will thus become destroyed, and the\r\noxide of copper left behind, in combination with the potash, of the\r\nnitrate of potash (or salt-petre,) or with the muriate of potash, if\r\nchlorate of potash has been employed.\r\n\r\nIf water, acidulated with nitric acid, be then poured into the crucible\r\nto dissolve the mass, the presence of the copper may be rendered\r\nmanifest by adding to the solution, liquid ammonia, in such quantity\r\nthat the pungent odour of it predominates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] Also, 2 Geo.

Britan. vol. xviii. p. 331. 1797. See also the\r\nHistory of the Tea Plant, p. 48; and p. 167 of this Treatise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Counterfeit Coffee._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fraud of counterfeiting ground coffee by means of pigeon's beans and\r\npease, is another subject which, not long ago, arrested the attention of\r\nthe public: and from the numerous convictions of grocers prosecuted for\r\nthe offence, it is evident that this practice has been carried on for a\r\nlong time, and to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe following statement exhibits some of the prosecutions, instituted by\r\nthe Solicitor of the Excise, against persons convicted of the fraud of\r\nmanufacturing spurious, and adulterating genuine coffee.\r\n\r\nAlexander Brady, a grocer, (_See p. 182_) prosecuted and convicted of\r\nselling _sham-coffee_, said, \"I have sold it for twenty years.\" Some of\r\nthe persons prosecuted by the Solicitor of the Excise for this fraud, we\r\nmight, at first sight, be inclined to believe, were inconscious that the\r\nadulterating of genuine coffee with spurious substances was illegal; but\r\nthis ignorance affords no excuse, as the Act of the 43 Geo. III. cap.\r\n129, explicitly states: \"If after the first day of September, 1803, any\r\nburnt, scorched, or roasted pease, beans, or other grain, or vegetable\r\nsubstance or substances prepared or manufactured for the purpose of\r\nbeing in imitation of or in any respect to resemble coffee or cocoa, or\r\nto serve as a substitute for coffee or cocoa, or alleged or pretended by\r\nthe possessor or vender thereof so to be, _shall be made_, or kept for\r\nsale, or shall be _offered_ or _exposed to sale_, or shall be _found_ in\r\nthe custody or possession of any _dealer_ or dealers in or _seller_ or\r\nsellers of _coffee_, or if any burnt, scorched, or roasted pease, beans,\r\nor other grain, or vegetable substance or substances not being coffee,\r\nshall be called by the preparer, manufacturer, possessor, or vender\r\nthereof, by the name of _English_ or _British_ coffee, or _any other\r\nname_ of coffee, or by the name of _American_ cocoa, or _English_ or\r\n_British_ cocoa, or any other name of cocoa, the same respectively shall\r\nbe forfeited, together with the packages containing the same, and shall\r\nand may be seized by any officer or officers of Excise; and the person\r\nor persons preparing, manufacturing, or selling the same, or having the\r\nsame in his, her, or their custody or possession, or the dealer or\r\ndealers in or seller or sellers of coffee or cocoa, in whose custody\r\nthe same shall be found, shall forfeit and lose the sum of one hundred\r\npounds.\"\r\n\r\n_The Attorney-General against William Malins._--This was an information\r\nfiled by the Attorney-General against the defendant, charging him, he\r\nbeing a dealer in coffee, with having in his possession a large quantity\r\nof imitation coffee, made from scorched pease and beans, resembling\r\ncoffee, and intended to be sold as such, contrary to the statute of the\r\n43d of the King, whereby he became liable to pay a fine of 100_l._\r\n\r\nJ. Lawes deposed that he had lived servant with the defendant; he\r\nconstantly roasted pease and beans, and ground them into powder. When so\r\nground, the powder very much resembled coffee. Sometimes the sweepings\r\nof the coffee were thrown in among the pease and beans. Witness carried\r\nout this powder to several grocers in different parts of the town.\r\n\r\nThomas Jones lived with the defendant. His occupation was roasting and\r\ngrinding pease and beans. They looked, when ground, the same as coffee.\r\nWitness had seen Mr. John Malins sweep up the refuse coffee, and mix it\r\nwith the pease and beans. He had taken out this mixture to grocers.\r\n\r\nJ. Richardson, an excise-officer, deposed, that, in December 1817, he\r\nwent to the premises of the defendant, and there seized four sacks, five\r\ntubs, and nine pounds in paper, of a powder made to resemble coffee. The\r\nquantity ground was 1,567 pounds; it had all the appearance of coffee;\r\nand a little coffee being mixed with it, any common person might be\r\ndeceived. He also seized two sacks, containing 279 pounds of whole pease\r\nand beans roasted. Among the latter were some grains of coffee. The\r\nwitness here produced samples of the articles seized.\r\n\r\nJohn Lawes deposed, that the articles exhibited were such as he was in\r\nthe habit of manufacturing while in Mr. Malins' employment.\r\n\r\nThe jury found a verdict for the Crown.--Penalty 100_l._\r\n\r\n_The King against Chaloner._--Mr. Chaloner, a dealer in tea and coffee,\r\nwas charged on the oaths of Charles Henry Lord and John Pearson, both\r\nExcise officers, with having in his possession, on the 17th of March,\r\nnine pounds of spurious coffee, consisting of burnt pease, beans, and\r\ngravel or sand, and a portion of coffee, and with selling some of the\r\nsame; also with having in his possession seventeen pounds of vegetable\r\npowder, and an article imitating coffee, which contained not a particle\r\nof genuine coffee.\r\n\r\nThe defendant was convicted in the penalty of 90_l._\r\n\r\n_The King against Peether._--This was an information against Mr. Thomas\r\nPeether, tea and coffee dealer, charging him with having in his\r\npossession a quantity of imitation coffee (or vegetable powder) on the\r\n25th of April last.\r\n\r\nThe case being proved by the evidence of several witnesses, the\r\ndefendant was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._\r\n\r\n_The King against Topping._--This was an information against Mr. John\r\nLewis Topping, a dealer in tea and coffee, charging him with having\r\nthirty-seven pounds of vegetable powder in his possession. The article\r\nseized was produced to the commissioners of the Excise.\r\n\r\nThe defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._\r\n\r\n_The King against Samuel Hallett._--The defendant, Hallett, a grocer and\r\ndealer in tea and coffee, was charged with having seven pounds of\r\nimitation coffee in his possession.\r\n\r\nCharles Henry Lord, an officer of the Excise, being sworn, stated, that\r\nhe and Spencer, an officer, went, on the 28th of February last, to the\r\nshop of the defendant, and asked for an ounce of coffee, at three\r\nhalfpence per ounce. He received the same, and having paid for it, left\r\nthe shop. He examined the article, and found it was part coffee, and\r\npart imitation coffee, or what the defendant called vegetable powder,\r\nwhich is nothing more nor less than burnt pease and beans ground in a\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nSpencer, the officer of the Excise, corroborated the above evidence, and\r\nstated, that the sham-coffee seized at the defendant's house was shown\r\nto Mr. Joseph Hubbard, grocer, and tea and coffee dealer, in\r\nHigh-street, in the Borough of Southwark.\r\n\r\nMr. Hubbard being sworn, stated, that he had examined the sham-coffee\r\nseized by the officers in the defendant's shop. The one ounce purchased\r\nby Lord, he knew to be nothing else than black pigeon's beans; there was\r\nno coffee amongst it.\r\n\r\nThe defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._\r\n\r\n_The King against Fox._--Mr. Edward Fox, grocer, and dealer in tea and\r\ncoffee, was charged with having a large quantity of sham-coffee in his\r\npossession, and with selling the same for genuine coffee.\r\n\r\nHenry Spencer, an officer of the Excise, stated, that on the 21st of\r\nFebruary he and Lord, another officer, went to the defendant's shop and\r\npurchased an ounce of coffee, for which he paid three halfpence. They\r\nexamined it, and he was satisfied it was not genuine coffee; they\r\npurchased another ounce (which he produced to the commissioners of the\r\nExcise, who examined it); they were convinced it consisted partly of\r\ncoffee and beans and pease.\r\n\r\nThe defendant, in his defence said, that the poor people wanted a\r\nlow-price article; and by mixing the vegetable powder and coffee\r\ntogether, he was able to sell it at three halfpence an ounce; he had\r\nsold it for years; he did it as a matter of accommodation to the poor,\r\nwho could not give a higher price; he did not sell it for genuine\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n_Commissioner._--\"Then you have been defrauding the public for many\r\nyears, and injuring the revenue by your illicit practices: the poor have\r\nan equal right to be supplied with as genuine an article as the rich.\"\r\n\r\nHe was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._\r\n\r\n_The King against Brady._--The defendant, Mr. Alexander Brady, grocer,\r\nand dealer in tea and coffee, was charged with having, on the 28th of\r\nFebruary last, in his possession eighteen pounds of sham-coffee, and\r\nselling the same for genuine coffee.\r\n\r\nLord and Pearson, Excise officers, stated, that they purchased an ounce\r\nof coffee of the defendant, on the 28th of February, and upon examining\r\nit they discovered that it was made up of pease and beans, ground with a\r\nsmall quantity of coffee. They also found eighteen pounds of vegetable\r\npowder mixed with coffee, in a state prepared for sale, wrapped in\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nOne of the commissioners tasted some of the eighteen pounds of\r\nsham-coffee produced by the officers, and declared that it was a most\r\ninfamous stuff, and unfit for human food.\r\n\r\n_Defendant._--\"Why, I have sold it for twenty years.\"\r\n\r\n_Commissioner._--\"Then you have been for twenty years acting most\r\ndishonestly, defrauding the revenue; and the health of the poor must\r\nhave suffered very much by taking such an unwholesome article. Your\r\nhaving dealt in this article so long aggravates your case; you have for\r\ntwenty years been selling burnt beans and pease for genuine coffee.--You\r\nare convicted in the penalty of 50_l._\"\r\n\r\n_The King against Bowser._--The excise officers stated, that on the 28th\r\nof February they went to his shop: he was a grocer, dealer in tea and\r\ncoffee; they seized seven pounds and a half of vegetable powder, which\r\ncontained very little coffee, if any; and also a quarter of a pound of\r\ncoffee mixed with vegetable powder.\r\n\r\nThe defendant pleaded guilty to the charge, and prayed the court to\r\nmitigate the penalty. He was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._\r\n\r\n_The King against Thomas Owen._--The defendant, an extensive dealer in\r\ntea and coffee, appeared to an information charging him with having in\r\nhis possession, and selling, a quantity of deleterious ingredients, and\r\nmixing them with coffee.\r\n\r\nCharles Henry Lord deposed, that on the 26th of February, he found, at\r\nthe shop of the defendant, nineteen pounds of a composition consisting\r\nof beans and pease ground, and prepared so as to imitate coffee. He also\r\ndiscovered two pounds and a half of a mixture of coffee and vegetable\r\npowder. On the same day he proceeded to another shop of the defendant,\r\nand he there found five pounds more of the same stuff.\r\n\r\nSamples of the composition, in its mixed and unmixed state, were\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawes addressed the commissioners on behalf of the defendant, in\r\nmitigation of punishment; for he did not mean to deny the offence. His\r\nclient was a very young man, and had been most unfortunate in business.\r\nHe was not aware until lately of the existence of any law by which it\r\ncould be punished.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners observed, that they had a double duty to perform,\r\nnamely, to protect the revenue from fraud, and to prevent the public\r\nfrom being imposed upon and injured by ingredients served to them\r\ninstead of the food they intended to purchase. The fraud upon the\r\nrevenue was, in the estimation of the court, the least part of the\r\noffence. Under all the circumstances, however, the court was inclined to\r\nbe lenient to the defendant.\r\n\r\nHe was convicted in the penalty of 50_l._ for each quantity of\r\nsham-coffee.\r\n\r\nMr. Greely and Mr. William Dando were fined 20_l._ each; and Mr. Hirling\r\nand Mr. Terry were fined 90_l._ each for selling spurious coffee.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of ground coffee, with pease and beans, is beyond the\r\nreach of chemical analysis; but it may, perhaps, not be amiss on this\r\noccasion to give to our readers a piece of advice given by a retired\r\ngrocer to a friend, at no distant period:--\"Never, my good fellow,\" he\r\nsaid, \"purchase from a grocer any thing which passes through his mill.\r\nYou know not what you get instead of the article you expect to\r\nreceive--coffee, pepper, and all-spice, are all mixed with substances\r\nwhich detract from their own natural qualities.\"--Persons keeping mills\r\nof their own can at all times prevent these impositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Brandy, Rum, and Gin._\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the Excise laws at present existing in this country, the various\r\ndegrees of strength of brandy, rum, arrack, gin, whiskey, and other\r\nspiritous liquors, chiefly composed of little else than spirit of wine,\r\nare determined by the quantity of alcohol of a given specific gravity\r\ncontained in the spiritous liquors of a supposed unknown strength. The\r\ngreat public importance of this subject in this country, where the\r\nconsumption of spiritous liquors adds a vast sum to the public revenue,\r\nhas been the means of instituting many very interesting series of\r\nexperiments on this subject. The instrument used for that purpose by the\r\nCustoms and officers of Excise, is called _Sikes_'s hydrometer,[88]\r\nwhich has now superseded the instrument called _Clark_'s hydrometer,\r\nheretofore in use.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity or strength of the legal standard spirit of the\r\nExcise, is technically called _proof_ or _proof spirit_. \"This liquor\r\n(not being spirit sweetened, or having any ingredient dissolved in it,\r\nto defeat the strength thereof,) at the temperature of 57° Faht. weighs\r\nexactly 12/13th parts of an equal measure of distilled water;\" and with\r\nthis spirit the strength of all other spiritous liquors are compared\r\naccording to law.\r\n\r\nThe strength of spirit stronger than _proof_ or _over proof_, as it is\r\ntermed by the revenue officers, is indicated by the bulk of water\r\nnecessary to reduce a given volume of it, to the legal standard spirit,\r\ndenominated _proof_--namely; if one gallon of water be required to bring\r\ntwenty gallons of brandy, rum, or any other spirit, to proof, that\r\nspirit is said to be _1 to 20 over proof_. If one gallon of water be\r\nrequired to bring 15, 10, 5, or 2 gallons of the liquor to _proof_, it\r\nis said to be 1 to 15, 1 to 10, 1 to 5, and 1 to 2, _over proof_.\r\n\r\nThe strength of brandy, rum, arrack, gin, or other spiritous liquors,\r\nweaker than _proof_, or under _proof_, is estimated by the quantity of\r\nwater which would be necessary to abstract or bring the spirit up to\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nThus, if from twenty gallons of brandy one gallon of water must be\r\nabstracted to bring it to proof, it is said to be 1 in 20 under proof.\r\nIf from 15, 10, 5, or 2 gallons of the liquor, 1 gallon of water must be\r\nabstracted to bring it to proof, it is said to be 1 in 15, 1 in 10, 1 in\r\n5, and 1 in 2 under proof.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to understand this absurd language, which is in use\r\namongst the officers of Excise and dealers in spirit, in order to know\r\nwhat is meant in commerce by the strength of spiritous liquors of\r\ndifferent denominations. And hence, for the business of the exciseman, a\r\ntable has been constructed, expressing the strength or specific gravity\r\nof mixtures of different proportions of spirit and water, at different\r\ndegrees of temperature; and according to this table the duty on spirit\r\nis now levied.\r\n\r\nBrandy and rum is seizable, if sold by, or found in the possession of,\r\nthe dealer, unless it possesses a certain strength.[89] The following\r\nare the words of the Act:\r\n\r\n\"No distiller, rectifier,[90] compounder or dealer, shall serve or send\r\nout any foreign spirits, of a lower strength than that of 1 in 6 under\r\nhydrometer proof,[91] nor have in his possession any foreign spirits\r\nmixed together, except shrub, cherry or raspberry brandy, of lower\r\nstrength than as aforesaid, upon pain of such spirits being forfeited;\r\nand such spirits, with the casks and vessels containing the same, may be\r\nseized by any officer of Excise.\"\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, a ready check against the frauds of the dishonest\r\ndealers, in spiritous liquors. If the spirit merchant engages to deliver\r\na liquor of a certain strength, the hydrometer is by far the most easy\r\nand expeditious check that can be adopted to guard against frauds of\r\nreceiving a weaker liquor for a stronger one; and to those individuals\r\nwho are in the habit of purchasing large quantities of brandy, rum, or\r\nother spiritous liquors, the hydrometer renders the greatest service.\r\nFor it is by no means an uncommon occurrence to meet with brandy, rum,\r\nand other spiritous liquors, of a specific gravity very much below the\r\npretended strength which the liquor ought to possess.\r\n\r\nThe following advice, given to his readers,[92] by the author of a\r\nTreatise on Brewing and Distilling, may serve to put the unwary on their\r\nguard against some of the frauds practised by mercenary dealers.\r\n\r\n\"It is a custom among retailing distillers, which I have not taken\r\nnotice of in this directory, to put one-third or one-fourth part of\r\nproof molasses brandy, proportionably, to what rum they dispose of;\r\nwhich cannot be distinguished, but by an extraordinary palate, and does\r\nnot at all lessen the body or proof of the goods; but makes them about\r\ntwo shillings a gallon cheaper; and must be well mixed and incorporated\r\ntogether in your retailing cask; but you should keep some of the best\r\nrum, not adulterated, to please some customers, whose judgment and\r\npalate must be humoured.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you are to draw a sample of goods to shew a person that has\r\njudgment in the proof, do not draw your goods into a phial to be tasted,\r\nor make experiment of the strength thereof that way, because the proof\r\nwill not hold except the goods be exceedingly strong; but draw the\r\npattern of goods rather into a glass from the cock, to run very small,\r\nor rather draw off a small quantity into a little pewter pot and pour it\r\ninto your glass, extending your pot as high above the glasses as you can\r\nwithout wasting it, which makes the goods carry a better head\r\nabundantly, than if the same goods were to be put and tried in a phial.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be so prudent as to make a distinction of the persons you have\r\nto deal with; what goods you sell to gentlemen for their own use, who\r\nrequire a great deal of attendance, and as much for time of payment, you\r\nmust take a considerably greater price than of others; what goods you\r\nsell to persons where you believe there is a manifest, or at least some\r\nhazard of your money, you may safely sell for more than common profit;\r\nwhat goods you sell to the poor, especially medicinally, (as many of\r\nyour goods are sanative,) be as compassionate as the cases require.\"\r\n\r\n\"All brandies, whether French, Spanish, or English; being proof goods,\r\nwill admit of one point of _liquor_[93] to each gallon, to be made up\r\nand incorporated therewith in your cask, for retail, or selling smaller\r\nquantities; and all persons that insist upon having proof goods, which\r\nnot one in twenty understands, you must supply out of what goods are not\r\nso reduced, though at a higher price.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the advice given by Mr. Shannon.\r\n\r\nThe mode of judging by the taste of spiritous liquors is deceitful. A\r\nfalse strength is given to a weak liquor, by infusing in it acrid\r\nvegetable substances, or by adding to it a tincture of grains of\r\nparadise and Guinea pepper. These substances impart to weak brandy or\r\nrum, an extremely hot and pungent taste.\r\n\r\nBrandy and rum is also frequently sophisticated with British molasses,\r\nor sugar-spirit, coloured with burnt sugar.\r\n\r\nThe flavour which characterises French brandy, and which is owing to a\r\nsmall portion of a peculiar essential oil contained in it, is imitated\r\nby distilling British molasses-spirit over wine lees;[94] but the\r\nspirit, prior to being distilled over wine lees, is previously\r\ndeprived, in part, of its peculiar disagreeable flavour, by\r\nrectification over fresh burnt charcoal and quick-lime. Other\r\nbrandy-merchants employ a spirit obtained from raisin wine, which is\r\nsuffered to pass into an incipient ascescency. The spirit thus procured\r\npartakes strongly of the flavour which is characteristic to foreign\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\nOak saw-dust, and a spiritous tincture of raisin stones, are likewise\r\nused to impart to new brandy and rum a _ripe taste_, resembling brandy\r\nor rum long kept in oaken casks, and a somewhat oily consistence, so as\r\nto form a durable froth at its surface, when strongly agitated in a\r\nvial. The colouring substances are burnt sugar, or molasses; the latter\r\ngives to imitative brandy a luscious taste, and fulness _in the mouth_.\r\nThese properties are said to render it particularly fit for the retail\r\nLondon customers.\r\n\r\nThe following is the method of compounding or _making up_, as it is\r\ntechnically called, _brandy_[95] for retail:\r\n\r\n                                                 Gallons\r\n     \"To ten puncheons of brandy                    1081\r\n     Add flavoured raisin spirit                     118\r\n     Tincture of grains of paradise                    4\r\n     Cherry laurel water                               2\r\n     Spirit of almond cakes                            2\r\n                                                 -------\r\n                                                    1207\r\n\r\n\"Add also 10 handfuls of oak saw-dust; and give it _complexion_ with\r\nburnt sugar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DETECTING THE ADULTERATIONS OF BRANDY, RUM, AND MALT SPIRIT.\r\n\r\nThe false strength of brandy or rum is rendered obvious by diluting the\r\nsuspected liquor with water; the acrimony of the capsicum, and grains of\r\nparadise, or pepper, may then be readily discovered by the taste.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of brandy with British molasses, or sugar-spirit,\r\nbecomes evident by rubbing a portion of the suspected brandy between\r\nthe palms of the hands; the spirit, as it evaporates, leaves the\r\ndisagreeable flavour which is peculiar to all British spirits. Or the\r\nliquor may be deprived of its alcohol, by heating a portion in a spoon\r\nover a candle, till the vapour ceases to catch fire on the approach of a\r\nlighted taper. The residue thus obtained, of genuine French brandy,\r\npossesses a vinous odour, still resembling the original flavour of the\r\nbrandy, whilst the residue, produced from sophisticated brandy, has a\r\npeculiarly disagreeable smell, resembling gin, or the breath of habitual\r\ndrunkards.\r\n\r\nArrack is coarsely imitated by adding to rum a small quantity of\r\npyroligneous acid and some flowers (acid) of benzoe. The compound thus\r\nproduced, however, must be pronounced a bad one. The author of a very\r\npopular Cookery Book,[96] directs two scruples of benzoic acid to be\r\ndissolved in one quart of rum, to make \"_mock arrack_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMALT SPIRIT.\r\n\r\nMalt spirit, or gin, the favourite liquor of the lower order of people,\r\nwhich is characterised by the peculiar flavour of juniper berries, over\r\nwhich the raw spirit is distilled, is usually obtained from a mixture of\r\nmalt and barley: sometimes both molasses and corn are employed,\r\nparticularly if there be a scarcity of grain. But the flavour of\r\nwhiskey, which is made from barley and oats, is owing to the malted\r\ngrain being dried with peat, the smoke of which gives it the\r\ncharacteristic taste.\r\n\r\nThe malt distiller is not allowed to furnish, under a heavy penalty, any\r\ncrude or raw spirit to the rectifier or manufacturer of gin, of a\r\ngreater strength than seven per cent. over proof. The rectifier who\r\nreceives the spirit from the malt distiller is not allowed, under a\r\ncertain penalty, to sweeten the liquor with sugar or other substances;\r\nnor is he permitted to send out the spirit to his customers but of a\r\ncertain strength, as is obvious from the following words of the Act:\r\n\r\n\"No rectifier or compounder shall sell or send out any British brandy,\r\nBritish rectified spirits, British compounds, or other British spirits,\r\nof greater strength than that of one in five under hydrometer proof[97]:\r\nand if he shall sell and send out any such spirits of a greater strength\r\nthan that of one in five under hydrometer proof, such spirits, with the\r\ncasks or vessels containing the same, shall be forfeited, and may be\r\nseized by any officer of Excise; and he shall also forfeit treble the\r\nvalue of such spirit, or 50_l._ at the election of the King's\r\nattorney-general, or the person who shall sue for the same; the single\r\nvalue of such spirits to be estimated at the highest London Price.[98]\"\r\n\r\nIf we examine gin, as retailed, we shall soon be convinced that it is a\r\ncustom, pretty prevalent amongst dealers, to weaken this liquor\r\nconsiderably with water, and to sweeten it with sugar. This fraud may\r\nreadily be detected by evaporating a quantity of the liquor in a\r\ntable-spoon over a candle, to dryness; the sugar will thus be rendered\r\nobvious, in the form of a gum-like substance, when the spirit is\r\nvolatilised.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty gallons of genuine gin, as obtained from the\r\nwholesale manufactories, are usually _made up_ by fraudulent retailers,\r\ninto a saleable commodity, with fourteen gallons of water and twenty-six\r\npounds of sugar. Now this dilution of the liquor produces a turbidness;\r\nbecause the oil of juniper and other flavouring substances which the\r\nspirit holds in solution, become precipitated by virtue of the water,\r\nand thus cause the liquor to assume an opaline colour: and the spirit\r\nthus weakened, cannot readily be rendered clear again by subsidence.\r\nSeveral expedients are had recourse to, to clarify the liquor in an\r\nexpeditious manner; some of which are harmless; others are criminal,\r\nbecause they render the liquor poisonous.\r\n\r\nOne of the methods, which is innocent, consists in adding to the\r\nweakened liquor, first, a portion of alum dissolved in water, and then a\r\nsolution of sub-carbonate of potash. The whole is stirred together, and\r\nleft undisturbed for twenty-four hours. The precipitated alumine thus\r\nproduced from the alum, by virtue of the sub-carbonate of potash, acts\r\nas a strainer upon the milky liquor, and carries down with it the finely\r\ndivided oily matter which produced the blue colour of the diluted\r\nliquor. Roach, or Roman alum, is also employed, without any other\r\naddition, for clarifying spiritous liquors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_To reduce unsweetened Gin._[99]\r\n\r\n     \"A tun of fine gin                     252 gallons\r\n     \"Water                                  36\r\n                                          -----\r\n     \"Which added together make             288 gallons\r\n\r\n     \"The _doctor is now put_ on,\r\n     and it is further reduced\r\n     with water                              19\r\n                                          -----\r\n     \"Which gives        Total              307 gallons of gin.\r\n\r\n\"This done, let 1 lb. of alum be just covered with water, and dissolved\r\nby boiling; rummage the whole well together, and pour in the alum, and\r\nthe whole will be fine in a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_To prepare and sweeten British Gin._[100]\r\n\r\n\"Get from your distiller an empty puncheon or cask, which will contain\r\nabout 133 gallons. Then take a cask of clear rectified spirits, 120\r\ngallons, of the usual strength as rectifiers sell their goods at, put\r\nthe 120 gallons of spirits into your empty cask.\r\n\r\n\"Then take a quarter of an ounce of oil of vitriol, half an ounce of\r\noil of almonds, a quarter of an ounce of oil of turpentine, one ounce of\r\noil of juniper berries, half a pint of spirit of wine, and half a pound\r\nof lump sugar. Beat or rub the above in a mortar. When well rubbed\r\ntogether, have ready prepared half a gallon of lime water, one gallon of\r\nrose water; mix the whole in either a pail, or cask, with a stick, till\r\nevery particle shall be dissolved; then add to the foregoing,\r\ntwenty-five pounds of sugar dissolved in about nine gallons of rain or\r\nThames water, or water that has been boiled, mix the whole well\r\ntogether, and stir them carefully with a stick in the 133 gallons cask.\r\n\r\n\"To _force down_ the same, take and boil eight ounces of alum in three\r\nquarts of water, for three quarters of an hour; take it from the fire,\r\nand dissolve by degrees six or seven ounces of salt of tartar. When the\r\nsame is milk-warm pour it into your gin, and stir it well together, as\r\nbefore, for five minutes, the same as you would a butt of beer newly\r\nfined. Let your cask stand as you mean to draw it. At every time you\r\npurpose to sweeten again, that cask must be well washed out; and take\r\ngreat care never to shake your cask all the while it is drawing.\"\r\n\r\nAnother method of fining spiritous liquors, consists in adding to it,\r\nfirst, a solution of sub-acetate of lead, and then a solution of alum.\r\nThis practice is highly dangerous, because part of the sulphate of lead\r\nproduced, remains dissolved in the liquor, which it thus renders\r\npoisonous. Unfortunately, this method of clarifying spiritous liquors, I\r\nhave good reason to believe, is more frequently practised than the\r\npreceding method, because its action is more rapid; and it imparts to\r\nthe liquor a fine _complexion_, or great refractive power; hence some\r\nvestiges of lead may often be detected in malt spirit.\r\n\r\nThe weakened spirit is then sweetened with sugar, and, to cover the raw\r\ntaste of the malt spirit, _false strength_ is given to it with grains of\r\nparadise, Guinea pepper, capsicum, and other acrid and aromatic\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DETECTING THE PRESENCE OF LEAD IN SPIRITOUS LIQUORS.\r\n\r\nThe presence of lead may be detected in spiritous liquors, as stated on\r\npages 70 and 86. The cordial called shrub frequently exhibits vestiges\r\nof copper. This contamination, I have been informed, is accidental, and\r\noriginates from the metallic vessels employed in the manufacture of the\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE QUANTITY OF ALCOHOL IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF\r\nSPIRITOUS LIQUORS.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of real alcohol in any spiritous liquors may readily be\r\nascertained by simple distillation, which process separates the alcohol\r\nfrom the water and foreign matters contained in the liquor. Put any\r\nquantity of brandy, rum, or malt spirit diluted with about one-fourth\r\nits bulk of water, into a retort fitted to a capacious receiver, and\r\ndistil with a gentle heat. The strongest spirit distils over first into\r\nthe receiver, and the strength of the obtained products decreases, till\r\nat last it contains so much water as no longer to be inflammable by the\r\napproach of a lighted taper, when held in a spoon over a candle (see p.\r\n160.) If the process be continued, the distilled product becomes milky,\r\nscarcely spiritous to the smell, and of an acidulous taste. The\r\ndistilling operation may then be discontinued. If the first, fourth or\r\nthird part of the distilled product has been set apart, it will be\r\nfound a moderately strong alcohol, and the remainder one more diluted.\r\nIf the whole distilled spirit be mixed with perfectly dry subcarbonate\r\nof potash, the alcohol will float at the top of the potash, as stated,\r\np. 161; it will separate into two distinct fluids. If the decanted\r\nalcohol be redistilled carefully with a very gentle heat, over a small\r\nportion of dry quick lime, or muriate of lime, it will be obtained\r\nextremely pure, and of a specific gravity of about 825, at 60° of\r\ntemperature. Its flavour will vary according to the kind of spiritous\r\nliquor from which it is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table exhibiting the Per Centage of Alcohol (of 825 specific gravity)\r\ncontained in various kinds of spiritous Liquors._[101]\r\n\r\n                                                         Proportion of\r\n                                                       Alcohol per Cent.\r\n                                                          by Measure.\r\n\r\nBrandy, Cogniac, average proportion of 4 samples               52,75\r\nDitto, Bourdeaux, ditto    ditto                               54,50\r\nDitto, Cette                                                   53,00\r\nDitto, Naples, average of 3 samples                            53,25\r\nDitto, Spanish average of 6 samples                            52,28\r\nRum                                                            53,68\r\nDitto, Leeward, average of 9 samples                           53,00\r\nScotch Whiskey, average of 6 samples                           53,50\r\nIrish   Ditto,  average of 4 samples                           54,25\r\nArrack, Batavia                                                49,50\r\nDutch Geneva                                                   52,25\r\nGin (Hodges's,[102]) 3 samples, procured from retail dealers   48,25\r\nDitto (Ditto,)[102] procured from the manufacturer             52,35\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] George III. c. xxviii.

In one poisonous sample\r\nwhich it fell to my lot to investigate, the evil had been caused by the\r\nsophistication of the anotta, employed for colouring cheese. This\r\nsubstance was found to contain a portion of red lead; a method of\r\nsophistication which has lately been confirmed by the following fact,\r\ncommunicated to the public by Mr. J. W. Wright, of Cambridge.[103]\r\n\r\n\"As a striking example of the extent to which adulterated articles of\r\nfood may be unconsciously diffused, and of the consequent difficulty of\r\ndetecting the real fabricators of them, it may not be uninteresting to\r\nrelate to your readers, the various steps by which the fraud of a\r\npoisonous adulteration of cheese was traced to its source.\r\n\r\n\"Your readers ought here to be told, that several instances are on\r\nrecord, that Gloucester and other cheeses have been found contaminated\r\nwith red lead, and that this contamination has produced serious\r\nconsequences. In the instance now alluded to, and probably in all other\r\ncases, the deleterious mixture had been caused ignorantly, by the\r\nadulteration of the anotta employed for colouring the cheese. This\r\nsubstance, in the instance I shall relate, was found to contain a\r\nportion of red lead; a species of adulteration which subsequent\r\nexperiments have shewn to be by no means uncommon. Before I proceed\r\nfurther to trace this fraud to its source, I shall briefly relate the\r\ncircumstance which gave rise to its detection.\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman, who had occasion to reside for some time in a city in the\r\nWest of England, was one night seized with a distressing but\r\nindescribable pain in the region of the abdomen and of the stomach,\r\naccompanied with a feeling of tension, which occasioned much\r\nrestlessness, anxiety, and repugnance to food. He began to apprehend the\r\naccess of an inflammatory disorder; but in twenty-four hours the\r\nsymptoms entirely subsided. In four days afterwards he experienced an\r\nattack precisely similar; and he then recollected, that having, on both\r\noccasions, arrived from the country late in the evening, he had ordered\r\na plate of toasted Gloucester cheese, of which he had partaken heartily;\r\na dish which, when at home, regularly served him for supper. He\r\nattributed his illness to the cheese. The circumstance was mentioned to\r\nthe mistress of the inn, who expressed great surprise, as the cheese in\r\nquestion was not purchased from a country dealer, but from a highly\r\nrespectable shop in London. He, therefore, ascribed the before-mentioned\r\neffects to some peculiarity in his constitution. A few days afterwards\r\nhe partook of the same cheese; and he had scarcely retired to rest, when\r\na most violent cholic seized him, which lasted the whole night and part\r\nof the ensuing day. The cook was now directed henceforth not to serve up\r\nany toasted cheese, and he never again experienced these distressing\r\nsymptoms. Whilst this matter was a subject of conversation in the house,\r\na servant-maid mentioned that a kitten had been violently sick after\r\nhaving eaten the rind cut off from the cheese prepared for the\r\ngentleman's supper. The landlady, in consequence of this statement,\r\nordered the cheese to be examined by a chemist in the vicinity, who\r\nreturned for answer, that the cheese was contaminated with lead! So\r\nunexpected an answer arrested general attention, and more particularly\r\nas the suspected cheese had been served up for several other customers.\r\n\r\n\"Application was therefore made by the London dealer to the farmer who\r\nmanufactured the cheese: he declared that he had bought the anotta of a\r\nmercantile traveller, who had supplied him and his neighbours for years\r\nwith that commodity, without giving occasion to a single complaint. On\r\nsubsequent inquiries, through a circuitous channel, unnecessary to be\r\ndetailed here at length, on the part of the manufacturer of the cheese,\r\nit was found, that as the supplies of anotta had been defective and of\r\ninferior quality, recourse had been had to the expedient of colouring\r\nthe commodity with vermilion. Even this admixture could not be\r\nconsidered deleterious. But on further application being made to the\r\ndruggist who sold the article, the answer was, that the vermilion had\r\nbeen mixed with a portion of red lead; and the deception was held to be\r\nperfectly innocent, as frequently practised on the supposition, that\r\nthe vermilion would be used only as a pigment for house-painting. Thus\r\nthe druggist sold his vermilion in the regular way of trade, adulterated\r\nwith red lead to increase his profit, without any suspicion of the use\r\nto which it would be applied; and the purchaser who adulterated the\r\nanotta, presuming that the vermilion was genuine, had no hesitation in\r\nheightening the colour of his spurious anotta with so harmless an\r\nadjunct. Thus, through the circuitous and diversified operations of\r\ncommerce, a portion of deadly poison may find admission into the\r\nnecessaries of life, in a way which can attach no criminality to the\r\nparties through whose hands it has successively passed.\"\r\n\r\nThis dangerous sophistication may be detected by macerating a portion of\r\nthe suspected cheese in water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\nacidulated with muriatic acid; which will instantly cause the cheese to\r\nassume a brown or black colour, if the minutest portion of lead be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[103] Repository of Arts, vol. viii. No. 47, p. 262.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Counterfeit Pepper._\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack pepper is the fruit of a shrubby creeping plant, which grows wild\r\nin the East Indies, and is cultivated, with much advantage, for the sake\r\nof its berries, in Java and Malabar. The berries are gathered before\r\nthey are ripe, and are dried in the sun. They become black and\r\ncorrugated on the surface.\r\n\r\nThis factitious pepper-corns have of late been detected mixed with\r\ngenuine pepper, is a fact sufficiently known.[104] Such an adulteration\r\nmay prove, in many instances of household economy, exceedingly vexatious\r\nand prejudicial to those who ignorantly make use of the spurious\r\narticle. I have examined large packages of both black and white pepper,\r\nby order of the Excise, and have found them to contain about 16 per\r\ncent. of this artificial compound. The spurious pepper is made up of\r\noil cakes (the residue of lintseed, from which the oil has been\r\npressed,) common clay, and a portion of Cayenne pepper, formed in a\r\nmass, and granulated by being first pressed through a sieve, and then\r\nrolled in a cask. The mode of detecting the fraud is easy. It is only\r\nnecessary to throw a sample of the suspected pepper into a bowl of\r\nwater; the artificial pepper-corns fall to powder, whilst the true\r\npepper remains whole.\r\n\r\nGround pepper is very often sophisticated by adding to a portion of\r\ngenuine pepper, a quantity of pepper dust, or the sweepings from the\r\npepper warehouses, mixed with a little Cayenne pepper. The sweepings are\r\nknown, and purchased in the market, under the name of P. D. signifying\r\npepper dust. An inferior sort of this vile refuse, or the sweepings of\r\nP. D. is distinguished among venders by the abbreviation of D. P. D.\r\ndenoting, dust (dirt) of pepper dust.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of pepper, and the making and selling commodities in\r\nimitation of pepper, are prohibited, under a severe penalty. The\r\nfollowing are the words of the Act:[105]\r\n\r\n\"And whereas commodities made in imitation of pepper have of late been\r\nsold and found in the possession of various dealers in pepper, and other\r\npersons in Great Britain; be it therefore enacted, that from and after\r\nthe said 5th day of July, 1819, if any commodity or substance shall be\r\nprepared by any person in imitation of pepper, shall be mixed with\r\npepper, or sold or delivered as and for, or as a substitute for, pepper,\r\nor if any such commodity or substance, alone or mixed, shall be kept for\r\nsale, sold, or delivered, or shall be offered or exposed to sale, or\r\nshall be in the custody or possession of any dealer or seller of pepper,\r\nthe same, together with all pepper with which the same shall be mixed,\r\nshall be forfeited, with the packages containing the same, and shall and\r\nmay be seized by any officer of excise; and the person preparing,\r\nmanufacturing, mixing as aforesaid, selling, exposing to sale, or\r\ndelivering the same, or having the same in his, her, or their custody or\r\npossession, shall forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE PEPPER.\r\n\r\nThe common white pepper is factitious, being prepared from the black\r\npepper in the following manner:--The pepper is first steeped in sea\r\nwater and urine, and then exposed to the heat of the sun for several\r\ndays, till the rind or outer bark loosens; it is then taken out of the\r\nsteep, and, when dry, it is rubbed with the hand till the rind falls\r\noff. The white fruit is then dried, and the remains of the rind blown\r\naway like chaff. A great deal of the peculiar flavour and pungent hot\r\ntaste of the pepper is taken off by this process. White pepper is always\r\ninferior in flavour and quality to the black pepper.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a sort of native white pepper, produced on a species\r\nof the pepper plant, which is much better than the factitious, and\r\nindeed little inferior to the common black pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[104] Thomson's Annals of Chemistry, 1816; also Repository of Arts, vol.\r\ni. 1816, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[105] George III. c. 53, § 21, 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Cayenne Pepper._\r\n\r\n\r\nCayenne pepper is an indiscriminate mixture of the powder of the dried\r\npods of many species of capsicum, but especially of the capsicum\r\nfrutescens, or bird pepper, which is the hottest of all.\r\n\r\nThis annual plant, a native of South America, is cultivated in large\r\nquantities in our West-India islands, and even frequently in our\r\ngardens, for the beauty of its pods, which are long, pointed, and\r\npendulous, at first of a green colour, and, when ripe, of a bright\r\norange red. They are filled with a dry loose pulp, and contain many\r\nsmall, flat, kidney-shaped seeds. The taste of capsicum is extremely\r\npungent and acrimonious, setting the mouth, as it were, on fire.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which its pungency depends, is soluble in water and in\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes adulterated with red lead, to prevent it becoming\r\nbleached on exposure to light. This fraud may be readily detected by\r\nshaking up part of it in a stopped vial containing water impregnated\r\nwith sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which will cause it speedily to assume a\r\ndark muddy black colour. Or the vegetable matter of the pepper may be\r\ndestroyed, by throwing a mixture of one part of the suspected pepper and\r\nthree of nitrate of potash (or two of chlorate of potash) into a red-hot\r\ncrucible, in small quantities at a time. The mass left behind may then\r\nbe digested in weak nitric acid, and the solution assayed for lead by\r\nwater impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Pickles._\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetable substances, preserved in the state called pickles, by means of\r\nthe antiseptic power of vinegar, whose sale frequently depends greatly\r\nupon a fine lively green colour; and the consumption of which, by\r\nsea-faring people in particular, is prodigious, are sometimes\r\nintentionally coloured by means of copper. Gerkins, French beans,\r\nsamphires, the green pods of capsicum, and many other pickled vegetable\r\nsubstances, oftener than is perhaps expected, are met with impregnated\r\nwith this metal. Numerous fatal consequences are known to have ensued\r\nfrom the use of these stimulants of the palate, to which the fresh and\r\npleasing hue has been imparted according to the deadly _formulæ_ laid\r\ndown in some modern cookery books, such as boiling the pickles with\r\nhalf-pence, or suffering them to stand for a considerable period in\r\nbrazen vessels.\r\n\r\nDr. Percival[106] has given an account of \"a young lady who amused\r\nherself, while her hair was dressing, with eating samphire pickles\r\nimpregnated with copper. She soon complained of pain in the stomach;\r\nand, in five days, vomiting commenced, which was incessant for two days.\r\nAfter this, her stomach became prodigiously distended; and, in nine days\r\nafter eating the pickles, death relieved her from her suffering.\"\r\n\r\nAmong many recipes which modern authors of cookery books have given for\r\nimparting a green colour to pickles, the following are particularly\r\ndeserving of censure; and it is to be hoped that they will be suppressed\r\nin future editions of the works.\r\n\r\n\"_To Pickle Gerkins._[107]--\"Boil the vinegar in a bell-metal or copper\r\npot; pour it boiling hot on your cucumbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"_To make greening._[108]--\"Take a bit of verdigris, the bigness of a\r\nhazel-nut, finely powdered; half-a-pint of distilled vinegar, and a bit\r\nof alum powder, with a little bay salt. Put all in a bottle, shake it,\r\nand let it stand till clear. Put a small tea-spoonful into codlings, or\r\nwhatever you wish to green.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. E. Raffald[109] directs, \"to render pickles green, boil them with\r\nhalfpence, or allow them to stand for twenty-four hours in copper or\r\nbrass pans.\"\r\n\r\nTo detect the presence of copper, it is only necessary to mince the\r\npickles, and to pour liquid ammonia, diluted with an equal bulk of\r\nwater, over them in a stopped phial: if the pickles contain the minutest\r\nquantity of copper, the ammonia assumes a blue colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106] Medical Transactions, vol. iv. p. 80.\r\n\r\n[107] The Ladies' Library, vol. ii. p. 203.\r\n\r\n[108] Modern Cookery, or the English Housewife--2d edition, p. 94.\r\n\r\n[109] The English Housekeeper, p. 352, 354.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Vinegar._\r\n\r\n\r\nVinegar, as prepared in this country, from malt, should be of a pale\r\nbrown colour, perfectly transparent, of a pleasant, somewhat pungent,\r\nacid taste, and fragrant odour, but without any acrimony. From the\r\nmucilaginous impurities which malt vinegar always contains, it is apt,\r\non exposure to air, to become turbid and ropy, and at last vapid. The\r\ninconvenience is best obviated by keeping the vinegar in bottles\r\ncompletely filled and well corked; and it is of advantage to boil it in\r\nthe bottles a few minutes before they are corked.\r\n\r\nVinegar is sometimes largely adulterated with sulphuric acid, to give it\r\nmore acidity. The presence of this acid is detected, if, on the addition\r\nof a solution of acetate of barytes, a white precipitate is formed,\r\nwhich is insoluble in nitric acid, after having been made red-hot in the\r\nfire. (See p. 159.) With the same intention, of making the vinegar\r\nappear stronger, different acrid vegetable substances are infused in it.\r\nThis fraud is difficult of detection; but when tasted with attention,\r\nthe pungency of such vinegar will be found to depend rather on acrimony\r\nthan acidity.\r\n\r\nDistilled vinegar, which is employed for various purposes of domestic\r\neconomy, is frequently distilled, not in glass, as it ought to be, but\r\nin common stills with a pewter pipe, whence it cannot fail to acquire a\r\nmetallic impregnation.\r\n\r\nOne ounce, by measure, should dissolve at least thirteen grains of white\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nIt should not form a precipitate on the addition of a solution of\r\nacetate of barytes, or of water saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\nThe former circumstance shews, that it is adulterated with sulphuric\r\nacid; and the latter indicates a metal.\r\n\r\nThe metallic impregnation is best rendered obvious by sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, in the manner stated, page 69. The distilled vinegar of\r\ncommerce usually contains tin, and not lead, as has been asserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Cream._\r\n\r\n\r\nCream is often adulterated with rice powder or arrow root. The former is\r\nfrequently employed for that purpose by pastry cooks, in fabricating\r\ncreams and custards, for tarts, and other kinds of pastry. The latter is\r\noften used in the London dairies. Arrow-root is preferable to rice\r\npowder; for, when converted with milk into a thick mucilage by a gentle\r\nebullition, it imparts to cream, previously diluted with milk, a\r\nconsistence and apparent richness, by no means unpalatable, without\r\nmaterially impairing the taste of the cream.\r\n\r\nThe arrow-root powder is mixed up with a small quantity of cold skimmed\r\nmilk into a perfect, smooth, uniform mixture; more milk is then added,\r\nand the whole boiled for a few minutes, to effect the solution of the\r\narrow-root: this compound, when perfectly cold, is mixed up with the\r\ncream. From 220 to 260 grains, (or three large tea-spoonfuls) of\r\narrow root are added to one pint of milk; and one part of this solution\r\nis mixed with three of cream. It is scarcely necessary to state that\r\nthis sophistication is innocuous.\r\n\r\nThe fraud may be detected by adding to a tea-spoonful of the\r\nsophisticated cream a few drops of a solution of iodine in spirit of\r\nwine, which instantly produces with it a dark blue colour. Genuine cream\r\nacquires, by the addition of this test, a faint yellow tinge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Confectionery._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of sugar plums, comfits, and other kinds of\r\nconfectionery, especially those sweetmeats of inferior quality,\r\nfrequently exposed to sale in the open streets, for the allurement of\r\nchildren, the grossest abuses are committed. The white comfits, called\r\nsugar pease, are chiefly composed of a mixture of sugar, starch, and\r\nCornish clay (a species of very white pipe-clay;) and the red sugar\r\ndrops are usually coloured with the inferior kind of vermilion. The\r\npigment is generally adulterated with red lead. Other kinds of\r\nsweetmeats are sometimes rendered poisonous by being coloured with\r\npreparations of copper. The following account of Mr. Miles[110] may be\r\nadvanced in proof of this statement.\r\n\r\n\"Some time ago, while residing in the house of a confectioner, I\r\nnoticed the colouring of the green fancy sweetmeats being done by\r\ndissolving sap-green in brandy. Now sap-green itself, as prepared from\r\nthe juice of the buckthorn berries, is no doubt a harmless substance;\r\nbut the manufacturers of this colour have for many years past produced\r\nvarious tints, some extremely bright, which there can be no doubt are\r\neffected by adding preparations of copper.\r\n\r\n\"The sweetmeats which accompany these lines you will find exhibit\r\nvestiges of being contaminated with copper.--The practice of colouring\r\nthese articles of confectionery should, therefore, be banished: the\r\nproprietors of which are not aware of the deleterious quality of the\r\nsubstances employed by them.\"\r\n\r\nThe foreign conserves, such as small green limes, citrons, hop-tops,\r\nplums, angelica roots, &c. imported into this country, and usually sold\r\nin round chip boxes, are frequently impregnated with copper.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration of confitures by means of clay, may be detected by\r\nsimply dissolving the comfits in a large quantity of boiling water. The\r\nclay, after suffering the mixture to stand undisturbed for a few days,\r\nwill fall to the bottom of the vessel; and on decanting the clear fluid,\r\nand suffering the sediment to become dry gradually, it may be obtained\r\nin a separate state. If the adulteration has been effected by means of\r\nclay, the obtained precipitate, on exposure to a red heat in the bowl of\r\na common tobacco-pipe, acquires a brick hardness.\r\n\r\nThe presence of copper may be detected by pouring over the comfits\r\nliquid ammonia, which speedily acquires a blue colour, if this metal be\r\npresent. The presence of lead is rendered obvious by water impregnated\r\nwith sulphuretted hydrogen, acidulated with muriatic acid (see p. 69,)\r\nwhich assumes a dark brown or black colour, if lead be present.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[110] Philosoph. Mag. No. 258, vol. 54. 1819, p. 317.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Catsup._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article is very often subjected to one of the most reprehensible\r\nmodes of adulteration ever devised. Quantities are daily to be met with,\r\nwhich, on a chemical examination, are found to abound with copper.\r\nIndeed, this condiment is often nothing else than the residue left\r\nbehind after the process employed for obtaining distilled vinegar,\r\nsubsequently diluted with a decoction of the outer green husk of the\r\nwalnut, and seasoned with all-spice, Cayenne pepper, pimento, onions,\r\nand common salt.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of copper which we have, more than once, detected in this\r\nsauce, used for seasoning, and which, on account of its cheapness, is\r\nmuch resorted to by people in the lower walks of life, has exceeded the\r\nproportion of lead to be met with in other articles employed in domestic\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe following account of Mr. Lewis[111] on this subject, will be\r\nsufficient to cause the public to be on their guard.\r\n\r\n\"Being in the habit of frequently purchasing large quantities of pickles\r\nand other culinary sauces, for the use of my establishment, and also for\r\nforeign trade, it fell lately to my lot to purchase from a manufacturer\r\nof those commodities a quantity of walnut catsup, apparently of an\r\nexcellent quality; but, to my great surprise, I had reason to believe\r\nthat the article might be contaminated with some deleterious substance,\r\nfrom circumstances which happened in my business as a tavern keeper, but\r\nwhich are unnecessary to be detailed here; and it was this that induced\r\nme to make inquiry concerning the compounding of the suspected articles.\r\n\r\n\"The catsup being prepared by boiling in a copper, as is usually\r\npractised, the outer green shell of walnuts, after having been suffered\r\nto turn black on exposure to air, in combination with common salt, with\r\na portion of pimento and pepper-dust, in common vinegar, strengthened\r\nwith some vinegar extract, left behind as residue in the still of\r\nvinegar manufacturers; I therefore suspected that the catsup might be\r\nimpregnated with some copper. To convince myself of this opinion. I\r\nboiled down to dryness a quart of it in a stone pipkin, which yielded\r\nto me a dark brown mass. I put this mass into a crucible, and kept it in\r\na coal fire, red-hot, till it became reduced to a porous black charcoal;\r\non urging the heat with a pair of bellows, and stirring the mass in the\r\ncrucible with the stem of a tobacco-pipe, it became, after two hours'\r\nexposure to an intense heat, converted into a greyish-white ash; but no\r\nmetal could be discriminated amongst it. I now poured upon it some aqua\r\nfortis, which dissolved nearly the whole of it, with an effervescence;\r\nand produced, after having been suffered to stand, to let the insoluble\r\nportion subside, a bright grass-green solution, of a strong metallic\r\ntaste; after immersing into this solution the blade of a knife, it\r\nbecame instantly covered with a bright coat of copper.\r\n\r\n\"The walnut catsup was therefore evidently strongly impregnated with\r\ncopper. On informing the manufacturer of this fact, he assured me that\r\nthe same method of preparing the liquor was generally pursued, and that\r\nhe had manufactured the article in a like manner for upwards of twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"Such is the statement I wish to communicate; and if you will allow it a\r\nplace in your Literary Chronicle, it may perhaps tend to put the unwary\r\non their guard against the practice of preparing this sauce by boiling\r\nit in a copper, which certainly may contaminate the liquor, and render\r\nit poisonous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[111] Literary Chronicle, No. 24, p. 379.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Custard._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the cherry laurel, _prunus lauro-cerasus_, a poisonous\r\nplant, have a nutty flavour, resembling that of the kernels of\r\npeach-stones, or of bitter almonds, which to most palates is grateful.\r\nThese leaves have for many years been in use among cooks, to communicate\r\nan almond or kernel-like flavour to custards, puddings, creams,\r\n_blanc-mange_, and other delicacies of the table.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted, that the laurel poison in custards and other\r\narticles of cookery is, on account of its being used in very small\r\nquantities, quite harmless. To refute this assertion, numerous instances\r\nmight be cited; and, among them, a recent one, in which four children\r\nsuffered most severely from partaking of custard flavoured with the\r\nleaves of this poisonous plant.\r\n\r\n\"Several children at a boarding-school, in the vicinity of Richmond,\r\nhaving partaken of some custard flavoured with the leaves of the cherry\r\nlaurel, as is frequently practised by cooks, four of the poor innocents\r\nwere taken severely ill in consequence. Two of them, a girl six years of\r\nage, and a boy of five years old, fell into a profound sleep, out of\r\nwhich they could not be roused.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the various medical exertions used, the boy remained in\r\na stupor ten hours; and the girl nine hours; the other two, one of which\r\nwas six years old, a girl, and a girl of seven years, complained of\r\nsevere pains in the epigastric region. They all recovered, after three\r\ndays' illness. I am anxious to communicate to you this fact, being\r\nconvinced that your publication is read at all the scholastic\r\nestablishments in this part of the country. I hope you will allow these\r\nlines a corner in your Literary Chronicle, where they may contribute to\r\nput the unwary on their guard, against the deleterious effects of\r\nflavouring culinary dishes with that baneful herb, the Cherry Laurel.\r\n\r\n\"I am, with respect, your's, Sir,\r\n     \"THOMAS LIDIARD.\"[112]\r\n\r\nWhat person of sense or prudence, then, would trust to the discretion of\r\nan ignorant cook, in mixing so dangerous an ingredient in his puddings\r\nand creams? Who but a maniac would choose to season his victuals with\r\npoison?\r\n\r\nThe water distilled from cherry laurel leaves is frequently mixed with\r\nbrandy and other spiritous liquors, to impart to them the flavour of the\r\ncordial called _noyeau_, (see also page 195.)\r\n\r\nThis fluid, though long in frequent use as a flavouring substance, was\r\nnot known to be poisonous until the year 1728; when the sudden death of\r\ntwo women, in Dublin, after drinking some of the common distilled cherry\r\nlaurel water, demonstrated its deleterious nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] Literary Chronicle, No. 22, p. 348.--1819.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Anchovy Sauce._\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral samples which we have examined of this fish sauce have been\r\nfound contaminated with lead.\r\n\r\nThe mode of preparation of this fish sauce, consists in rubbing down the\r\nbroken anchovy in a mortar: and this triturated mass, being of a dark\r\nbrown colour, receives, without much risk of detection, a certain\r\nquantity of Venetian red, added for the purpose of colouring it, which,\r\nif genuine, is an innocent colouring substance; but instances have\r\noccurred of this pigment having been adulterated with orange lead, which\r\nis nothing else than a better kind of minium, or red oxide of lead. The\r\nfraud may be detected, as stated p. 229.\r\n\r\nThe conscientious oilmen, less anxious with respect to colour,\r\nsubstitute for this poison the more harmless pigment, called Armenian\r\nbole.\r\n\r\nThe following recipe for making this fish sauce is copied from Gray's\r\nSupplement to the Pharmacopoeias, p. 241.\r\n\r\n\"Anchovies, 2 lbs. to 4 lbs. and a half; pulp through a fine hair sieve;\r\nboil the bones with common salt, 7 oz. in water 6 lbs.; strain; add\r\nflour 7 oz. and the pulp of the fish; boil; pass the whole through the\r\nsieve; colour with Venetian red to your fancy. It should produce one\r\ngallon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Lozenges._\r\n\r\n\r\nLozenges, particularly those into the composition of which substances\r\nenter that are not soluble in water, as ginger, cremor tartar, magnesia,\r\n&c., are often sophisticated. The adulterating ingredient is usually\r\npipe-clay, of which a liberal portion is substituted for sugar. The\r\nfollowing detection of this fraud was lately made by Dr. T. Lloyd.[113]\r\n\r\n\"Some ginger lozenges having lately fallen into my hands, I was not a\r\nlittle surprised to observe, accidentally, that when thrown into a coal\r\nfire, they suffered but little change. If one of the lozenges was laid\r\non a shovel, previously made red-hot, it speedily took fire; but,\r\ninstead of burning with a blaze and becoming converted into a charcoal,\r\nit took fire, and burnt with a feeble flame for scarcely half a minute,\r\nand there remained behind a stony hard substance, retaining the form of\r\nthe lozenge. This unexpected result led me to examine these lozenges,\r\nwhich were bought at a respectable chemist's shop in the city; and I\r\nsoon became convinced, that, in the preparation of them, a considerable\r\nquantity of common pipe-clay had been substituted for sugar. On making a\r\ncomplaint about this fraud at the shop where the article was sold, I was\r\ninformed that there were two kinds of ginger lozenges kept for sale, the\r\none at three-pence the ounce, and the other at six-pence per ounce; and\r\nthat the article furnished to me by mistake was the cheaper commodity:\r\nthe latter were distinguished by the epithet _verum_, they being\r\ncomposed of sugar and ginger only; but the former were manufactured\r\npartly of white Cornish clay, with a portion of sugar only, with ginger\r\nand Guinea pepper. I was likewise informed, that of Tolu lozenges,\r\npeppermint lozenges and ginger pearls, and several other sorts of\r\nlozenges, two kinds were kept; that the _reduced_ articles, as they were\r\ncalled, were manufactured for those very clever persons in their own\r\nconceit, who are fond of haggling, and insist on buying better bargains\r\nthan other people, shutting their eyes to the defects of an article, so\r\nthat they can enjoy the delight of getting it cheap; and, secondly for\r\nthose persons, who being but bad paymasters, yet, as the manufacturer,\r\nfor his own credit's sake, cannot charge more than the usual price of\r\nthe articles, he thinks himself therefore authorised to adulterate it in\r\nvalue, to make up for the risk he runs, and the long credit he must\r\ngive.\"\r\n\r\nThe comfits called ginger pearls, are frequently adulterated with clay.\r\nThese frauds may be detected in the manner stated, page 225.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[113] Literary Gazette, No. 146.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Olive Oil._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis commodity is sometimes contaminated with lead, because the fruit\r\nwhich yields the oil is submitted to the action of the press between\r\nleaden plates; and it is, moreover, a practice (particularly in Spain)\r\nto suffer the oil to become clear in leaden cisterns, before it is\r\nbrought to market for sale. The French and Italian olive oil is usually\r\nfree from this impregnation.\r\n\r\nOlive oil is sometimes mixed with oil of poppy seeds: but, by exposing\r\nthe mixture to the freezing temperature, the olive oil freezes, while\r\nthat of the poppy seeds remains fluid; and as oils which freeze with\r\nmost difficulty are most apt to become rancid, olive oil is deteriorated\r\nby the mixture of poppy oil.\r\n\r\nGood olive oil should have a pale yellow colour, somewhat inclining to\r\ngreen; a bland taste, without smell; and should congeal at 38°\r\nFahrenheit. In this country, it is frequently met with rancid.\r\n\r\nThe presence of lead is detected by shaking, in a stopped vial, one part\r\nof the suspected oil, with two or three parts of water impregnated with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. This agent will render the oil of a dark brown or\r\nblack colour, if any metal, deleterious to health, be present. The\r\npractice of keeping this oil in pewter or leaden cisterns, as is often\r\nthe case, is objectionable; because the oil acts upon the metal. The\r\ndealers in this commodity assert, that it prevents the oil from becoming\r\nrancid: and hence some retailers often suffer a pewter measure to remain\r\nimmersed in the oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Mustard._\r\n\r\n\r\nGenuine mustard, either in powder, or in the state of a paste ready for\r\nuse, is perhaps rarely to be met with in the shops. The article sold\r\nunder the name of _genuine Durham mustard_, is usually a mixture of\r\nmustard and common wheaten flour, with a portion of Cayenne pepper, and\r\na large quantity of bay salt, made with water into a paste, ready for\r\nuse. Some manufacturers adulterate their mustard with radish-seed and\r\npease flour.\r\n\r\nIt has often been stated, that a fine yellow colour is given to mustard\r\nby means of turmeric. We doubt the truth of this assertion. The presence\r\nof the minutest quantity of turmeric may instantly be detected, by\r\nadding to the mustard a few drops of a solution of potash, or any other\r\nalkali, which changes the bright yellow colour, to a brown or deep\r\norange tint.\r\n\r\nTwo ounces and a half of Cayenne pepper, 1-1/2 lbs. of bay salt, 8 lbs.\r\nof mustard flour, and 1-1/2 lbs. of wheaten flour, made into a stiff\r\npaste, with the requisite quantity of water, in which the bay-salt is\r\npreviously dissolved, forms the so-called _genuine Durham mustard_, sold\r\nin pots. The salt and Cayenne pepper contribute materially to the\r\nkeeping of ready-made mustard.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore nothing deleterious in the usual practice of\r\nadulterating this commodity of the table. The fraud only tends to\r\ndeteriorate the quality and flavour of the genuine article itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adulteration of Lemon Acid._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known to every one, that the expressed juice of lemons is\r\nextremely apt to spoil, on account of the sugar, mucilage, and\r\nextractive matter which it contains; and hence various means have been\r\npractised, with the intention of rendering it less perishable, and less\r\nbulky. The juice has been evaporated to the consistence of rob; but this\r\nalways gives an unpleasant empyreumatic taste, and does not separate the\r\nforeign matters, so that it is still apt to spoil when agitated on board\r\nof ship in tropical climates. It has been exposed to frost, and part of\r\nthe water removed under the form of ice; but this is liable to all the\r\nformer objections; and, besides, where lemons are produced in sufficient\r\nquantity, there is not a sufficient degree of cold. The addition of a\r\nportion of spirit to the inspissated juice, separates the mucilage, but\r\nnot the extractive matter and the sugar. By means, however, of\r\nseparating the foreign matters associated with it, in the juice, by\r\nchemical processes unnecessary to be detailed here, citric acid is now\r\nmanufactured, perfectly pure, and in a crystallised form, and is sold\r\nunder the name of concrete lemon acid. In this state it is extremely\r\nconvenient, both for domestic and medicinal purposes. One drachm, when\r\ndissolved in one ounce of water, is equal in strength to a like bulk of\r\nfresh lemon juice. To communicate the lemon flavour, it is only\r\nnecessary to rub a lump of sugar on the rind of a lemon to become\r\nimpregnated with a portion of the essential oil of the fruit, and to add\r\nthe sugar to the lemonade, negus, punch, shrub, jellies or culinary\r\nsauces, prepared with the pure citric acid.\r\n\r\nFraudulent dealers often substitute the cheaper tartareous acid, for\r\ncitric acid. The negus and lemonade made by the pastry-cooks, and the\r\nliquor called punch, sold at taverns in this metropolis, is usually made\r\nwith tartareous acid.\r\n\r\nTo discriminate citric acid from tartareous acid, it is only necessary\r\nto add a concentrated solution of the suspected acid, to a concentrated\r\nsolution of muriate of potash, taking care that the solution of the acid\r\nis in excess. If a precipitate ensues, the fraud is obvious, because\r\ncitric acid does not produce a precipitate with a solution of muriate\r\nor potash.\r\n\r\nOr, by adding to a saturated solution of tartrate of potash, a saturated\r\nsolution of the suspected acid, in excess, which produces with it an\r\nalmost insoluble precipitate in minute granular crystals. Pure citric\r\nacid produces no such effect when added in excess to tartrate of\r\npotash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Mushrooms._\r\n\r\n\r\nMushrooms have been long used in sauces and other culinary preparations;\r\nyet there are numerous instances on record of the deleterious effects of\r\nsome species of these _fungi_, almost all of which are fraught with\r\npoison.[114] Pliny already exclaims against the luxury of his countrymen\r\nin this article, and wonders what extraordinary pleasure there can be in\r\neating such dangerous food.[115]\r\n\r\nBut if the palate must be indulged with these treacherous luxuries, or,\r\nas Seneca calls them, \"voluptuous poison,\"[116] it is highly necessary\r\nthat the mild eatable mushrooms, should be gathered by persons skilful\r\nenough to distinguish the good from the false, or poisonous, which is\r\nnot always the case; nor are the characters which distinguish them\r\nstrongly marked.\r\n\r\nThe following statement is published by Mr. Glen, surgeon, of\r\nKnightsbridge:\r\n\r\n\"A poor man, residing in Knightsbridge, took a walk in Hyde Park, with\r\nthe intention of gathering some mushrooms. He collected a considerable\r\nnumber, and, after stewing them, began to eat them. He had finished the\r\nwhole, with the exception of about six or eight, when, about eight or\r\nten minutes from the commencement of his meal, he was suddenly seized\r\nwith a dimness, or mist before his eyes, a giddiness of the head, with a\r\ngeneral trembling and sudden loss of power;--so much so, that he nearly\r\nfell off the chair; to this succeeded loss of recollection: he forgot\r\nwhere he was, and all the circumstances of his case. This deprivation\r\nsoon went off, and he so far rallied as to be able, though with\r\ndifficulty, to get up, with the intention of going to Mr. Glen for\r\nassistance--a distance of about five hundred yards: he had not proceeded\r\nmore than half way, when his memory again failed him; he lost his road,\r\nalthough previously well acquainted with it. He was met by a friend, who\r\nwith difficulty learned his state, and conducted him to Mr. Glen's\r\nhouse. His countenance betrayed great anxiety: he reeled about, like a\r\ndrunken man, and was greatly inclined to sleep; his pulse was low and\r\nfeeble. Mr. Glen immediately gave him an emetic draught. The poison had\r\nso diminished the sensibility of the stomach, that vomiting did not take\r\nplace for near twenty minutes, although another draught had been\r\nexhibited. During this interval his drowsiness increased to such a\r\ndegree, that he was only kept awake by obliging him to walk round the\r\nroom with assistance; he also, at this time, complained of distressing\r\npains in the calves of his legs.--Full vomiting was at length produced.\r\nAfter the operation of the emetic, he expressed himself generally\r\nbetter, but still continued drowsy. In the evening Mr. Glen found him\r\ndoing well.\"\r\n\r\nThe following case is recorded in the Medical Transactions, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n\"A middle-aged man having gathered what he called champignons, they were\r\nstewed, and eaten by himself and his wife; their child also, about four\r\nyears old, ate a little of them, and the sippets of bread which were put\r\ninto the liquor. Within five minutes after eating them, the man began to\r\nstare in an unusual manner, and was unable to shut his eyes. All\r\nobjects appeared to him coloured with a variety of colours. He felt a\r\npalpitation in what he called his stomach; and was so giddy, that he\r\ncould hardly stand. He seemed to himself swelled all over his body. He\r\nhardly knew what he did or said; and sometimes was unable to speak at\r\nall. These symptoms continued in a greater or less degree for\r\ntwenty-four hours; after which, he felt little or no disorder. Soon\r\nafter he perceived himself ill, one scruple of white vitriol was given\r\nhim, and repeated two or three times, with which he vomited plentifully.\r\n\r\n\"The woman, aged thirty-nine, felt all the same symptoms, but in a\r\nhigher degree. She totally lost her voice and her senses, and was either\r\nstupid, or so furious that it was necessary she should be held. The\r\nwhite vitriol was offered to her, of which she was capable of taking but\r\nvery little; however, after four or five hours, she was much recovered:\r\nbut she continued many days far from being well, and from enjoying her\r\nformer health and strength. She frequently fainted for the first week\r\nafter; and there was, during a month longer, an uneasy sense of heat and\r\nweight in her breast, stomach, and bowels, with great flatulence. Her\r\nhead was, at first waking, much confused; and she often experienced\r\npalpitations, tremblings, and other hysteric affections, to all which\r\nshe had ever before been a stranger.\r\n\r\n\"The child had some convulsive agitations of his arms, but was otherwise\r\nlittle affected. He was capable of taking half a scruple of ipecacuanha,\r\nwith which he vomited, and was soon perfectly recovered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM CATSUP.\r\n\r\nThe edible mushroom is the basis of the sauce called mushroom catsup; a\r\ngreat proportion of which is prepared by gardeners who grow the fungi.\r\nThe mushrooms employed for preparing this sauce are generally those\r\nwhich are in a putrefactive state, and not having found a ready sale in\r\nthe market; for no vegetable substance is liable to so rapid a\r\nspontaneous decomposition as mushrooms. In a few days after the fungus\r\nhas been removed from the dung-bed on which it grows, it becomes the\r\nhabitation of myriads of insects; and, if even the saleable mushroom be\r\nattentively examined, it will frequently be found to swarm with life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[114] Fungi plerique veneno turgent.

Ep. 95.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Soda Water._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beverage called soda water is frequently contaminated both with\r\ncopper and lead; these metals being largely employed in the construction\r\nof the apparatus for preparing the carbonated water,[117] and the great\r\nexcess of carbonic acid which the water contains, particularly enables\r\nit to act strongly on the metallic substances of the apparatus; a truth,\r\nof which the reader will find no difficulty in convincing himself, by\r\nsuffering a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gas to pass through the\r\nwater.--See p. 70.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[117] Some manufacturers have been hence induced to construct the\r\napparatus for manufacturing soda water wholly either of earthenware or\r\nof glass. Mr. Johnston, of Greek Street, Soho, was the first who pointed\r\nout to the public the absolute necessity of this precaution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food poisoned by Copper Vessels._\r\n\r\n\r\nMany kinds of viands are frequently impregnated with copper, in\r\nconsequence of the employment of cooking utensils made of that metal. By\r\nthe use of such vessels in dressing food, we are daily liable to be\r\npoisoned; as almost all acid vegetables, as well as sebaceous or pinguid\r\nsubstances, employed in culinary preparations, act upon copper, and\r\ndissolve a portion of it; and too many examples are met with of fatal\r\nconsequences having ensued from eating food which had been dressed in\r\ncopper vessels not well cleaned from the oxide of copper which they had\r\ncontracted by being exposed to the action of air and moisture.\r\n\r\nThe inexcusable negligence of persons who make use of copper vessels has\r\nbeen productive of mortality, so much more terrible, as they have\r\nexerted their action on a great number of persons at once. The annals of\r\nmedicine furnish too many examples in support of this assertion, to\r\nrender it necessary to insist more upon it here.\r\n\r\nMr. Thiery, who wrote a thesis on the noxious quality of copper,\r\nobserves, that \"our food receives its quantity of poison in the kitchen\r\nby the use of copper pans and dishes. The brewer mingles poison in our\r\nbeer, by boiling it in copper vessels. The sugar-baker employs copper\r\npans; the pastry-cook bakes our tarts in copper moulds; the confectioner\r\nuses copper vessels: the oilman boils his pickles in copper or brass\r\nvessels, and verdigris is plentifully formed by the action of the\r\nvinegar upon the metal.\r\n\r\n\"Though, after all, a single dose be not mortal, yet a quantity of\r\npoison, however small, when taken at every meal, must produce more fatal\r\neffects than are generally apprehended; and different constitutions are\r\ndifferently affected by minute quantities of substances that act\r\npowerfully on the system.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of a tract, entitled, \"Serious Reflections on the Dangers\r\nattending the Use of Copper Vessels,\" asserts that a numerous and\r\nfrightful train of diseases is occasioned by the poisonous effects of\r\npernicious matter received into the stomach insensibly with our\r\nvictuals.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnston[118] gives an account of the melancholy catastrophe of\r\nthree men being poisoned, after excruciating sufferings, in consequence\r\nof eating food cooked in an unclean copper vessel, on board the Cyclops\r\nfrigate; and, besides these, thirty-three men became ill from the same\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe following case[119] is related by Sir George Baker, M. D.\r\n\r\n\"Some cyder, which had been made in a gentleman's family, being thought\r\ntoo sour, was boiled with honey in a brewing vessel, the rim of which\r\nwas capped with lead. All who drank this liquor were seized with a bowel\r\ncolic, more or less violently. One of the servants died very soon in\r\nconvulsions; several others were cruelly tortured a long time. The\r\nmaster of the family, in particular, notwithstanding all the assistance\r\nwhich art could give him, never recovered his health; but died\r\nmiserably, after having almost three years languished under a most\r\ntedious and incurable malady.\"\r\n\r\nToo much care and attention cannot be taken in preserving all culinary\r\nutensils of copper, in a state unexceptionably fit for their destined\r\npurpose. They should be frequently tinned, and kept thoroughly clean,\r\nnor should any food ever be suffered to remain in them for a longer time\r\nthan is absolutely necessary to their preparation for the table. But the\r\nsure preventive of its pernicious effect, is, to banish copper utensils\r\nfrom the kitchen altogether.\r\n\r\nThe following wholesome advice on this subject is given to cooks by the\r\nauthor of an excellent cookery book.[120]\r\n\r\n\"Stew-pans and soup-kettles should be examined every time they are used;\r\nthese, and their covers, must be kept perfectly clean and well tinned,\r\nnot only on the inside, but about a couple of inches on the outside; so\r\nmuch mischief arises from their getting out of repair; and, if not kept\r\nnicely tinned, all your work will be in vain; the broths and soups will\r\nlook green and dirty, and taste bitter and poisonous, and will be\r\nspoiled both for the eye and palate, and your credit will be lost; and\r\nas the health, and even the life, of the family depends upon this; the\r\ncook may be sure her employer had rather pay the tin-man's bill than\r\nthe doctor's.\"\r\n\r\nThe senate of Sweden, in the year 1753, prohibited copper vessels, and\r\nordered that none but such as were made of iron should be used in their\r\nfleet and armies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[118] Johnston's Essay on Poison, p. 102.\r\n\r\n[119] Medical Transactions, vol. i. p. 213.\r\n\r\n[120] Apicius Redivivus, p. 91.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Food Poisoned by Leaden Vessels._\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of food used in domestic economy, are liable to become\r\nimpregnated with lead.\r\n\r\nThe glazing of the common cream-coloured earthen ware, which is composed\r\nof an oxide of lead, readily yields to the action of vinegar and saline\r\ncompounds; and therefore jars and pots of this kind of stone ware, are\r\nwholly unfit to contain jellies of fruits, marmalade, and similar\r\nconserves. Pickles should in no case be deposited in cream-coloured\r\nglazed earthenware.\r\n\r\nThe custom which still prevails in some parts of this country of keeping\r\nmilk in leaden vessels for the use of the dairy, is very improper.\r\n\r\n\"In Lancashire[121] the dairies are furnished with milk-pans made of\r\nlead: and when Mr. Parks expostulated with some individuals on the\r\ndanger of this practice, he was told that _leaden_ milk-pans throw up\r\nthe cream much better than vessels of any other kind.\r\n\r\n\"In some parts of the north of England it is customary for the\r\ninn-keepers to prepare mint-salad by bruising and grinding the vegetable\r\nin a large wooden bowl with a _ball of lead_ of twelve or fourteen\r\npounds weight. In this operation the mint is cut, and portions of the\r\nlead are ground off at every revolution of the ponderous instrument. In\r\nthe same county, it is a common practice to have brewing-coppers\r\nconstructed with the bottom of copper and the whole sides of lead.\"\r\n\r\nThe baking of fruit tarts in cream-coloured earthenware, and the salting\r\nand preserving of meat in leaden pans, are no less objectionable. All\r\nkinds of food which contain free vegetable acids, or saline\r\npreparations, attack utensils covered with a glaze, in the composition\r\nof which lead enters as a component part. The leaden beds of presses for\r\nsqueezing the fruit in cyder countries, have produced incalculable\r\nmischief. These consequences never follow, when the lead is combined\r\nwith tin; because this metal, being more eager for oxidation, prevents\r\nthe solution of the lead.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the various unsuspected means by which the poisons of\r\nlead and copper gain admittance into the human body, a very common but\r\ndangerous instance presents itself: namely, the practice of painting\r\ntoys, made for the amusement of children, with poisonous substances,\r\nviz. red lead, verdigris, &c. Children are apt to put every thing,\r\nespecially what gives them pleasure, into their mouths; the painting of\r\ntoys with colouring substances that are poisonous, ought therefore to be\r\nabolished; a practice which lies the more open to censure, as it is of\r\nno real utility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] Park's Chemical Essays, vol. v. p.
