Physicians who prescribe Pharmacopeial or National\r\nFormulary drugs or preparations, therefore, are more likely to obtain a\r\ngood and constant quality than if they prescribe unofficial articles,\r\ni.e., articles that have no legalized standard. Hence medical men are\r\ninterested in knowing what drugs and preparations are included in these\r\ntwo books of standards. Both the Pharmacopeia and the National\r\nFormulary, however, contain a vast amount of technical information, of\r\nvalue to pharmacists but of little interest to physicians. The Journal\r\nof the American Medical Association in 1907 issued the \"Physicians'\r\nManual of the U.S. Pharmacopeia and National Formulary,\" a book designed\r\nto meet the needs of physicians in this respect. The fact that this book\r\ndid meet a real need is evidenced by the continued demand for it.\r\n\r\nThe present \"Epitome of the U.S. Pharmacopeia and National Formulary\"\r\ntakes the place of that book, but is based on the new (the ninth)\r\nrevision of the Pharmacopeia and the new (the fourth) edition of the\r\nNational Formulary. It has been prepared under the direction of a\r\ncommittee appointed by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the\r\nAmerican Medical Association. The aim has been to include all the matter\r\nin the Pharmacopeia and National Formulary which is likely to be of\r\ninterest to physicians. This, it is believed, consists of the official\r\ntitles and their abbreviations; synonyms; brief definitions; when\r\nnecessary, concise descriptions of the physical properties; and dosage.\r\nSince both the Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary include many\r\ndrugs and preparations which are irrational, superfluous or worthless,\r\nin many cases the medical members of the committee have added brief\r\ncomments to aid a discriminating selection of therapeutic agents.\r\n\r\nIn this epitome drugs are arranged alphabetically by Pharmacopeial or\r\nNational Formulary titles; preparations of drugs are placed under the\r\ndrugs themselves. Thus Tinctura Digitalis is placed not among the Ts,\r\nbut among the Ds under Digitalis. Names of drugs are in black-face type;\r\nnames of preparations are in light-face italics. An index is added to\r\nassist in ready reference.\r\n\r\nStatements of composition refer in some cases to percentage by volume,\r\nin others to percentage by weight, and in still others to percentage by\r\nweight-volume--that is, the weight of a given chemical contained (or the\r\nweight of a given vegetable drug represented by extractives) in 100 Cc.\r\nof the preparation. It has not been thought worth while to indicate\r\nwhether the statement in each case is by volume, weight or\r\nweight-volume, since the differences are too small to have any\r\ntherapeutic importance. Statements of alcoholic content refer to\r\npercentage by volume and are approximate only. In a few instances in\r\nwhich the quantity of alcohol in a dose is small, or in which the\r\npreparation is intended for external use, the alcohol content is not\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nDOSAGE statements, when followed by the letters \"U.S.P.\" or \"N.F.,\" are\r\ntaken from these books, respectively, and are understood to be the\r\naverage adult doses. In some cases in which this statement was felt to\r\nbe inadequate or unsatisfactory, further suggestions as to dosage have\r\nbeen added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text of this edition is the same as that of the first, except that a\r\nfew typographical errors which were in the first edition have been\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nThe new edition differs from the first in the following particulars:\r\n\r\nIn the first edition, a star indicates that the drug is included in the\r\nsecond (1916) edition of Useful Drugs. To bring the present edition up\r\nto date, the star (*) here indicates that the drug is included in the\r\nfifth (1921) edition of Useful Drugs.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the opinion expressed by some that a more complete\r\nindex would be helpful, the index to the second edition has been\r\nmaterially extended. It is hoped that this will help to familiarize\r\nthose who purchase the book with its contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLES OF METRIC AND APOTHECARIES' WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\r\n\r\n\r\nMETRIC MEASURES OF WEIGHT\r\n\r\n  1 Milligram (1 mg.) = 0.001 gram.\r\n  1 Centigram = 0.01 gram.\r\n  1 Decigram = 0.1 gram.\r\n  1 Gram (1 Gm.) = 1.[A]\r\n  1 Decagram = 10 grams.\r\n  1 Hektogram = 100 grams.\r\n  1 Kilogram (1 kg.) = 1000 grams.[B]\r\n\r\n  A: The weight of 1 cubic centimeter of water at 4 C.\r\n\r\n  B: The weight of 1 cubic decimeter of water at 4 C.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETRIC FLUID MEASURE\r\n\r\n  1 Milliliter (1 cubic centimeter, 1 Cc.) = 0.001 cubic decimeter.\r\n  1 Centiliter (10 Cc.) = 0.01 cubic decimeter.\r\n  1 Deciliter (100 Cc.) = 0.1 cubic decimeter.\r\n  1 Liter (1000 Cc.) = 1 cubic decimeter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARIES' WEIGHT\r\n\r\n  20 Grains = 1 scruple.\r\n  3 Scruples = 1 drachm.\r\n  8 Drachms = 1 ounce.\r\n  12 Ounces = 1 pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOTHECARIES' FLUID MEASURE\r\n\r\n  60 Minims = 1 fluidrachm.\r\n   8 Fluidrachms = 1 fluidounce.\r\n  16 Fluidounces = 1 pint.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIVALENTS OF APOTHECARIES' WEIGHT IN METRIC\r\n\r\n  1 Grain  = 0.06479895 Gm.\r\n  1 Drachm = 3.8879369 Gm.\r\n  1 Ounce  = 31.1034956 Gm.\r\n  1 Pound  = 373.241948 Gm.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIVALENTS OF APOTHECARIES' FLUID MEASURE IN METRIC\r\n\r\n  1 Minim = 0.06161 Cc.\r\n  1 Fluidrachm = 3.6966 Cc.\r\n  1 Fluidounce = 29.573 Cc.\r\n  1 Pint = 473.17 Cc.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIVALENTS OF METRIC WEIGHT IN APOTHECARIES'\r\n\r\n     0.001 Gm.

Acac.), Syrup of Acacia, U.S.P._--Acacia (10%) in\r\nsugar and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ACETA, VINEGARS.=--A vinegar is a solution of vegetable principles\r\neither in diluted acetic acid or in a mixture of diluted acetic acid and\r\nalcohol. For Acetum Aromaticum, see under =Oleum Lavandulae=; for Acetum\r\nOpii and Acetum Scillae, see under =Opium= and =Scilla=, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n=*Acetanilidum (Acetanil.), Acetanilid, U.S.P.= (Acetanilide,\r\nAntifebrin).--C{6}H{5}NH.CH{3}CO.\r\n\r\n     A white, odorless, crystalline powder, with a slightly burning\r\n     taste. Slightly soluble in water (1:190), very soluble in alcohol\r\n     (1:3.4) and in chloroform (1:3.7). Incompatible with spirit of\r\n     nitrous ether and forms pasty masses when triturated with chloral\r\n     or antipyrin.\r\n\r\n  ACTION AND USES: Analgesic, antipyretic and, in excessive\r\n  doses, a cardiac depressant. Used particularly to\r\n  relieve headache and neuralgic pains. A habit-forming\r\n  drug. If used over a long period of time, it may produce\r\n  a severe anemia.\r\n\r\n  DOSAGE: 0.2 Gm. or 3 grains (U.S.P.) in powders\r\n  which may be placed in capsules, or tablets which should\r\n  be crushed before swallowing. It is well to begin with 0.1\r\n  Gm. or about 1-1/2 grains, and to repeat cautiously.\r\n\r\n_Pulvis Acetanilidi Compositus (Pulv. Acetanil. Co.), Compound\r\nAcetanilid Powder, N.F._--Acetanilid (70%), caffeine (10%) and sodium\r\nbicarbonate (20%).\r\n\r\n  USES: Irrational acetanilid preparation. The caffeine\r\n  does not diminish the toxicity, nor does the bicarbonate\r\n  increase the solubility of acetanilid, as was at one time\r\n  supposed.\r\n\r\n  DOSAGE: 0.3 Gm. or 5 grains (N.F.).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Acetonum (Aceton.), Acetone, U.S.P.= (Dimethyl-Ketone).\r\n\r\n     A colorless liquid, with an ethereal odor and a pungent sweetish\r\n     taste. Miscible with water, alcohol, ether and chloroform.\r\n\r\n  ACTION AND USES: Pharmaceutic solvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=*Acetphenetidinum (Acetphen.), Acetphenetidin, U.S.P.\r\n(Phenacetin).=--C{6}H{4}(OC{2}H{5}).NH.CH{3}CO.\r\n\r\n     White, odorless, slightly bitter, crystalline scales or powder.\r\n     Very slightly soluble in water (1:1310), soluble in alcohol (1:15)\r\n     and in chloroform (1:14).\r\n\r\n  ACTION AND USES: Analgesic, antipyretic and, in excessive\r\n  doses, a cardiac depressant. Used particularly for\r\n  the relief of headache and neuralgic pains and in the treatment\r\n  of mild fevers. A habit-forming drug.

Pharmacy and Chemistry of\r\nthe American Medical Association.\r\n\r\nThis list was compiled for the purpose of aiding the movement toward the\r\nelimination of the mass of useless or superfluous drugs now in books on\r\nmateria medica. It is particularly fitted to serve as a text for\r\nteachers of materia medica and therapeutics.\r\n\r\nMany state medical examining boards are limiting their examinations on\r\ntherapeutics to this list of drugs.\r\n\r\nIn this book the properties--pharmacologic action, therapeutic uses and\r\ndosage, and methods of administration--are briefly but practically\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nCloth, flexible cover, 4-1/2 by 7-1/2 inches, 176 pages. Price,\r\npostpaid, 60 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION\r\n535 North Dearborn Street\r\nCHICAGO",
